Travis S.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",2,12,,2.0,4/14/2013,"We sat on the patio which had some great ambiance, and even though it was a bit chilly out, the outdoor heaters kept the temperature great. Unfortunately we literally waited for 10 minutes after we were seated before anyone greeted us, and that was after one of our party went back inside to tell someone we were there.  Drinks came very slowly, although the server was witty about their poor service. The sampler platter was kind of slow in coming too, although I thought pretty much everything on it was pretty good. Artichoke dip was fantastic, but could have come with more chips. The deep dish pizza was fairly good as advertised. The last negative was that a manager opened the sliding glass panel next to us leading into the indoor dining area. I assume this was because it was getting stuffy inside, but it created a draft at our table of air rushing into the restaurant that was quite unpleasant. We were not asked at all if this bothered us. Another of our party paid so I couldn't be too unhappy, but I probably wouldn't come back on my own dime."
Jane L.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,105,51,4.0,3/1/2014,"I've always loved BJs and their heavenly pizookis.  I've been here a few times with my friends and always enjoyed the food. I usually get the jambalaya and a mini pizooki. The food is always delicious and cooked well. And the pizooki is just amazing!! Warm gooey cookie with cold ice cream....I'm dying.  The service is good. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. The waiters usually seem busy but for the most part friendly.  Overall, the food here is pretty good and won't disappoint. And their pizookis are soooo good.  Recommend:  Pizooki  Jambalaya"
Amy L.,"Irvine, CA",7,154,,1.0,4/7/2014,"Don't get takeout here - horrible service + food. 1. They messed up by order - I ordered the deep dish and they gave me a regular pizza 2. Horrible service + wait. The head waitress / greeter person ignored me, rolled her eyes at me, and even turned her back on me when I tried to ask if my order was done. Then the waitresses kept saying oh yeah we'll get it and then coming back and forgetting that they had ever talked to me. 3. Horrible food - very, very cold. It felt like they had just warmed up an old pizza they had laying around. Horrific experience. Maybe people can try out dining in, but definitely avoid their take-out."
Kay R.,"Santa Monica, CA",128,179,54,5.0,8/19/2013,"Usually it's hard to give chain restaurant great reviews but I had an great experience here.  My boyfriend and I wander around Westwood at least twice a month since he loves to go there to get his hair cut. Usually, we have brunch before but we were rushing so we just decided to grab lunch here.  We ordered the bacon/ranch deep dish with sampler beer.  Super good!  My boyfriend and I decided to come here instead of CPK bc he loves their deep dish.  I agree that it is completely worth the calorie bombing.  Paired with some great beer as well.  We shared a small pizza and our total came out to like $23!  That small pizza was definitely enough for two people to share and probably one slice too many but we managed ;-). The service was also really great.  The host was very nice and we were seated next to the window.  Everything came out right away and the waitress was very attentive. Will definitely come back here to binge on pizza and beer.  With Diddy Reese right across the street, it's just win-win."
Marissa D.,"Azusa, CA",66,3,2,1.0,6/3/2015,Don't come here unless you want to pay for overpriced food and bad service. They got my take out order wrong AND they charged me extra for THEIR mistake. I definitely will not be coming back here.
Jennifer I.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,24,6,3.0,6/3/2015,"After a bad day all I wanted was a pizookie. So I hopped in the car at 9:30pm and went to my local BJ's in Westwood. After searching for parking I made it inside and was seated pretty quickly. They unfortunately did not have vanilla ice cream :( so I drank some water and left. I'm giving 3 stars because this place is ""meh"" I wasn't expecting much only a delicious sweet treat which I didn't get."
Marjorie U.,"West Los Angeles, CA",245,476,12992,4.0,1/6/2010,"If you like pizza that is not greasy and a good German Wheat & Rye for Harvest Hefeweizen beer then u gotta check out this place. The only thing I don't like about this branch is parking.  I really like their BJ 'S CLASSIC COMBO. This a deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. U should also try their New England-style clam chowder. It's all about the clams not the potato and it's not too thick. Last night I got so stuffed that I decided not to order my favorite dessert which is called, ""PIZOOKIE."" A freshly baked cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Your choice of Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut. I normally order half chocolate chunk and half white chocolate macadamia nut. This place gets really crowded so I suggest u show up late at night."
Felicia T.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,276,192,1.0,3/5/2015,"What's happened to this place? Perhaps my tolerance level for horrendous service has lowered as I get older, or we were unlucky to be stuck with a miserable waitress, but I won't be returning to this location. Granted the food was expected, but the service left a very bad taste in our mouths.  We went during the Christmas break, so the UCLA kids were out, we found parking outside, the restaurant was only about 30% full. We were seated at a booth, almost immediately. All good start.  Then it went downhill from there, there was no redeeming the evening. Our waitress (Kathy i think was her name) has got to be the most miserable waitress we've ever had the pleasure interacting, in our years of dining out. She clearly didn't want to be there and seemed to have a personal hostility against us. We asked for water and iced tea. We didn't get them until the appetizer came (she never even walked by, so we had to flag another waiter who brought our drinks for us). She didn't drop off the appetizer (someone else from the kitchen brought out our Carnitas Fries and Chile Verde). The fries were good, and the chile verde tangy, tart, a bit spicy. No problem with the food. The main courses came out - deep dish BBQ chicken pizza and Jambalaya- this time carried over by another gentleman, who also ended up removing the appetizer plate. He asked us how it was, and for us to enjoy the entrees. By this time, our drinks were empty, but our waitress hasn't once come back to check up on us. In the meantime, she has refilled drinks for the other patrons around us. At this point I got self conscious and started thinking if she was maybe not fond of Asians (moi). But she works by UCLA for god's sakes, and not Podunk, Ohio, so Asians are not uncommon.  The host refilled our drinks for us, he also asked how we found the food. Both were dishes we've had before and so we liked them fine. The jambalaya this evening was a couple notches spicier than other times, and they sprinkled chipotle peppers all around the plate, so it was rather intrusive (good for presentation, I guess).  We managed to flag her down for our 3rd round of refill, at which point,we wanted the remaining half of the pizza to go and asked for our check. She didn't bother asking how the food went, etc. This is the kicker: she had the audacity to smile so widely when dropping off the check, and on it, was a big hand-drawn smiley face, a ""Thanks"" and her name. Unreal. We gave her a 15% tip in cash and took off. I'd have given less but it was the holidays, and i didn't want to be chased down for what she'd definitely argue to be great service. Her negative energy tells me she'd stoop that low.  Management needs to get a better handle on who they hire, but with the place being constantly busy when school is in, and their ""who cares if our service sucks, these kids only care about their beers"" attitude, i guess they don't feel the need to try at all. I've had way better service at iHop."
Kira L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,442,164,4.0,12/28/2011,"I frequent this BJ's quite a bit. It's a large enough restaurant, and the service has always been good. I've never had problems here. In fact, most of the time, the service is great.  Their pizza is deep dish, so if you don't like that... obviously, don't order it. I like it once  in awhile, and BJ's always serves it fresh, hot, and just the right amount of crispy. I usually get the BJ's Favorite, which has enough meat and veggies, with a side of ranch sauce. Yes, I'm a fatty.  Their appetizers are pretty good too. Spinach Artichoke Dip is a favorite. Ahi Poke is so-so. Pizookie is always fun and delicious to eat. HOT cookie with COLD ice cream. Yum. Best way to finish a meal at BJ's.  They have a decent beer selection, and a few TV's, so you can watch sports while you eat. It's a pretty good place to eat dinner. I think it gets crowded on weekend nights, but weekdays are pretty chill."
Kevin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,13,,3.0,4/25/2014,"Never order delivery from them, in my experience they either get lost or forget your order. That said, if you plan on going there, it's pretty good stuff.  Appetizers are good, as is the pizza.  Service is generally good but not outstanding."
Amanda K.,"Santa Monica, CA",164,184,11,4.0,2/7/2015,"Best deep dish pizza ever. Pizookies are instant top 3 dessert in the f****** world. Other than that, all food is meh."
Karina T.,"New York, NY",57,95,326,4.0,4/7/2012,"4 stars for the red velvet pizookie. I know it has like 203948023948 calories but still, totally worth it! It's right across from Diddy Riese and basically it's the same thing as what they serve, but you'll get it without waiting in a long line. I like the chicken lettuce wrap here too! You'll get seated pretty quickly but the BJ's here is pretty small compared to the other ones around town."
Turk M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",111,64,266,4.0,12/19/2013,"I love the food, the service is always good, but the noise level is always aggravating and the constant sports on the screens everywhere totally annoying."
Nila C.,"Glendale, CA",26,113,48,4.0,10/29/2013,"The food is ecellent. Sometimes you wait too long, though. Service is very good. The dining room is nice with many big screen TV. The prices are resonable. I highly recommend it."
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,1.0,4/28/2013,"Geez what a terrible BJ's. The service was very rushed and blah, the pizza was undercooked (as BJ's is known for their wonderful crispy yet fluffy pizza crust, this place didn't get it at all), and the pizookies were too freaking gooey thus undercooked! What the hell!!! No wonder this BJ's was empty. I'm still a fan of BJ's, just hate this location."
Alice W.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,11,14,2.0,7/3/2013,"The best part about BJ's is the food... So good! This location in Westwood doesn't really have the happy hour specials like other BJ's aka there are no specials on drinks. The happy hour they have include half off mini pizza's (so 5-6$ for a 6in deep dish pizza) and 2$ off appetizers. Service is a little slow and not the best. We came in later around 11pm and happy hour starts at 10pm (I called earlier to check), and when we got there, the waitress told us that this particular location had no happy hour at all, but after speaking to her manager, they let us have the happy hour specials. Then our order was wrong so it twice as long as it did to come out. The place is not too big either, one of the smaller BJ's I've seen. It is a bit pricey too, even at happy hour specials... but the food was GOOD (Two stars for food!). We tried... Hand Tossed Gourmet Five Meat Pizza - This pizza was so good! 14'' of deliciousness... The crust was crisp and so fresh and the cheese was perfect. All the meats had so much flavor. This was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. A bit pricey though. About $20 for this thin crusted pizza. Piranha Pale Ale Nachos -- this was a ""shareable"" appetizer and they do mean ""shareable"". It was huge! Normally $9.95 but we got $2 off for the appetizer. It was really good, and way too much. On the menu it said the whole thing was over 2000 calories. This plate is enough for 4 people. Wish there was more cheese of it though."
Cindy T.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,19,6,1.0,11/27/2012,"One word: Terrible. Note: This is an extremely long review, and I apologize for all the space it takes up. If you don't feel like reading all of this (it really is quite tedious), let me just summarize for you: Don't ever eat here. The service is awful, the quality of the food is mediocre, and it's simply not worth the money and wait. For those who do want to read about my experience: I went to this particular BJ's for the first time for my birthday earlier this month, and I left feeling extremely disappointed. I've eaten at BJ's a couple times before (in my hometown of Elk Grove) so I had similar expectations for this location... And they were by no means met. We get there around 8 pm on a Saturday night, and there's a crowd of people outside waiting for a table, which is nothing out of the ordinary for a BJ's restaurant. The host said that the wait would be approximately 30-45 minutes, which we were fine with. Our group was composed of 5 people, so we figured we could keep each other entertained for a half hour. But what we COULDN'T do, however, is keep ourselves entertained for an hour and a half, which was the time we actually had to wait! Every time we went in to check our position, the host would apologize and tell us that we would be the next table seated! Horrible. We honestly should've left at this point but instead we decided to wait it out. We finally got our table, and were seated in the center of the room. The place was loud and packed with people, and it didn't help that the UCLA v. WSU game was on that night. Naturally, a friendly waitress came by, apologized for the wait, and handed us menus and took our orders. One of my friends and I got our own personal pizzas, while my other three friends decided to share a large. Someone also ordered a pizookie, and the waitress said she'd put in the order midway through the meal so that it'd arrive right when we finished eating. The wait for our food was ridiculous - it was 30 minutes! We asked our waiter (sometime during the wait we got a new server - I'm guessing the waitress ended her shift) how long it was going to take, and he kept on repeating that the pizza was nearly done and that the chefs just needed to put it on the plate... By that point we were ravenous. After about 20 minutes in I was getting impatient, and couldn't help myself from continuously glancing at the food that was laid out on the counter above the stoves. (You know, where the cooks place the food after it's done cooking and is ready to be served.) I noticed that there were several plates of food just sitting there for the last 10 minutes... And yup, you guessed it - when we finally got our food, one of those plates turned out to be my pizza. Needless to say, the pizza definitely did not live up to expectation. Even in the midst of my hunger I was definitely put off by the quality and taste, which was only average. It was soggy at the bottom and lukewarm everywhere else. I had to hold up the tip or else the toppings would fall off! We all finished our food in 10 minutes or less - you can imagine how hungry we were. One of my friends asked for a birthday pizookie for me, which arrived in about 10 minutes. However, my friend's pizookie never arrived! We notified our waiter, and he said that the order was never put in and that he'd get it started right away... Which meant more waiting.  We waited a bit more, but all the guys were starting to get pissed off (not surprisingly). We asked our waiter where the pizookie was, and he rudely responded and told us they were working on it. After 10 minutes passed, we decided that we'd rather just leave than wait for the pizooki. We called our waiter over and told him to cancel it, to which he replied sharply, ""You want to just cancel it? It's already made. It's almost here now. You can, but the cook is about to put it on the plate. He's probably putting it on the plate right now as we speak. You sure you want to cancel it? Because you can, but just know that it's pretty much done."" Wait, what? Did our waiter just give us attitude? We agreed to wait for the pizooki, but in our minds this was the last straw. There was no way in hell we were ever going here again. It came out a couple minutes later, but of course the warmth and sweetness of enjoying a warm ice cream topped pizookie had long evaporated.  Horrible place, horrible quality, horrible service. Everything was just horrible. I miss the Elk Grove location. :("
Greg S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/29/2016,"Slow service.  Understaffed.  Lukewarm pizza. Party of 6 immediately seated, but two hours later still waiting on a to go order and our bill.  To go burger was COLD.  Apparently had been sitting for a while.  Manager that came on duty was nice but pretty much passed along blame to earlier manager.  This isn't my first time with the same experience, but first time taking the time to write a review."
Cindy S.,"San Francisco, CA",201,129,293,5.0,9/2/2010,"Okay, I hate to say this, but the salad I had at BJ's the other day was actually comparable to - or even better than - what I've tried at my absolute favorite, Urth Caffe. (Yes, I said it! :)) I never really have salad cravings, but that day in particular was strange. With the 100 degree weather and whatnot. So I remembered I saw an ad for the (old) ""new"" Santa Fe salad in the BJ's menu with a ginormous picture of greens, avocados, grated cheese, corn, tomatoes, tortilla chip strips, etc etc. It just looked YUMMY!!!  Bf got his usual pasta and I ordered my Santa Fe with blackened chicken. It was...simply put - ridiculously, mind-blowingly, omg-what-is-this - amazing! Pretty much, it tasted like the insides of a fresh taco poured over lettuce and avocado slices. Sounds plain, but it was actually the PERFECT blend. I'm not usually a salad type of girl, but I know a good salad when I eat one. And this is the jackpot. (Bf REALLY doesn't like salad, but even he thought it was amazing. Can't argue w/ that!) Lunch that day was long and silent with me so engulfed in my delicious salad. All I remember saying was ""I can't. stop. eating!!!"" Just try it - you'll see what I mean. I wouldn't lie to you, my fellow Yelp friends :)"
Monica R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,11,,5.0,4/13/2015,"This place is my favorite, very friendly people and nice service , definately recommended.A+++"
