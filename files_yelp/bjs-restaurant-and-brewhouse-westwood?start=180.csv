Anthony N.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,593,2353,2.0,8/16/2012,"I really like BJ's.  *blush* But their servicing sucks...literally and figuratively...ironic huh? Especially this one... I love when BJ's does the 2 for $20 deal!  Its so much freaking food!  Choice of soup or salad, any pizza on the menu, and a pizookie!  I literally take a whole pizza home every time.   I like their tortilla soup.  But their pizookie is what makes me come back every time.  Darn them. I'm a masochist cause I guess I'm into bad BJ's. Show me yo teeth."
Shawn K.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,23,,1.0,9/14/2014,"At this location my Wife and her friends like this place ( they drink a pitcher of beer for starters so yeah they would like anything after that ) but since I was driving... just food for me. The food looked good but it did not smell good. The food did not taste good. The food was not even hot! It was like the chicken tenders and potato wedges were reheated from another persons plate ( hopefully and most likely not ) and reserved, dried out and cold. The service seemed good. We were seated fairly quick. Jake our waiter seemed nice and helpful. I understand the manger wanted feed back about the rejected food but after the second question I almost vomited his food back as a answer, maybe I shoulda let him try my food. (Next time I think I'll offer the manger a bite before I make a demand which I usually don't... I would have just walked out but the ladies were kinda enjoying themselves) The manger did comp my food and we paid for ladies portion.  This is not the first time I ate there but it will be the last time for me.    Beer and desserts is what your looking for by all means."
N A.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,25,,1.0,8/17/2014,"Terrible Service at this location. Messed up the order , forgot to bring the drinks and also forgot the little girl's bazookie cake on her birthday which I specifically requested. Manager came to apologize for the continuous issues but than bought the 'apetizer' onion strings to the last. They were cooked in 'rancid' overused oil and we left them as  it is.  I am never going again in this location. There are better places to go..terrible service and food"
Vivi T.,"Long Beach, CA",455,406,1196,3.0,1/16/2011,"I'm usually a fan of BJ's, but I'm not too fond of this one.  It's really small, so if you're going for dinner, you can count on waiting for at least 20 minutes.  The tables are so close to each other, so it's really loud.  But I don't blame them because everything seems cramped in Westwood anyway.  My favorite dishes at BJ's are the pan pizzas and the large stuffed potatoes.  You can get a specialty pizza or you can pick your own toppings.  Doesn't really matter to me because I think the crust is what makes it so good.  I like the veggie stuffed potato.  It's definitely the biggest potato I have ever seen.  I always am only able to eat half of one because it's so big!!!  The food is a good deal for the quality that you're getting.  Get a pizza to share with the table and then get your own potato :).  And of course, you cannot go to BJ's without getting a delicious pizookie.  Oh man.  Pizookie is definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  A hot, gooey cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Mannn.  I'm craving it right now!!!  OMNOMNOM I don't drink, so I can't comment on the brewery, but my friends do love the variety of the drinks menu. The food here is good but several things drive me away from it.  The crowdedness that I mentioned is the main reason.  The service is nothing to write home about either.  The waiters are always all over the place.  I know that they're busy, but they do not refill drinks until you ask them to (and they still take forever to come back) and they can be rude when you ask them to split the check.  I've never been here for lunch, so maybe it'll be less crowded then.  I'll have to try that!"
Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",159,539,1108,3.0,7/1/2013,"Nothing remarkable about anything I had here.  Tried a porter, which was fine, not bad, but not interesting.  The food I had was just on the small plate menu.  Again nothing remarkable or interesting.  Just sort of bland ho hum corporate Sysco type food.  Service was good but in an awful hurry to give us a check rather than sell us another beer."
Tamara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,28,,1.0,7/24/2013,"Ugh, what a terrible waste of time and money.  A few office mates took me out for a belated birthday lunch and I chose BJ's only because of the pizookie (it's been years since I had one). We waited so long for our (totally disappointing) food that our 1-hour lunch break was over by the time we got it. I asked for the pizookie anyway, right when we got our food (I was told it takes about 7 minutes). We finished eating, they cleared the table, and we sat there for another 10 minutes before they brought it out. It was ridiculously tiny compared to the good old days. Never thought I'd say this: it was DISGUSTING. I scooped it up with excitement only to get gross, RAW, RUNNY cookie dough. I'm not talking deliciously chewy soft-baked cookie dough, I mean raw. And runny. I wanted to spit it out. We had to send it back and leave in a hurry. Never coming back to this location or possibly any BJ's, ever."
samanta a.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,150,1.0,1/20/2016,I really like this place but after we gave a chance to this restaurant so many times this time the manger bring us the appetizer him self last time the pizza was cold the other time they bring the appetizer after pizza and this time that was my mother birthday I order dessert at the first place and at the end she came to are table and we was shook we pay the bill and the manger came ask us every thing was ok and my husband told him what happen and manger ask a server she said I forgot . So we all was passed off and we never go back .  And her name was Kaitlin are server was not good at all and for sure she receive a 0$ tip that she was deserve .
Nora N.,"Pasadena, CA",93,150,18,1.0,12/7/2012,"I have been to this BJs location many times. This last time was a horrible experience...  Started off okay, hostess was friendly. After being seated, I ordered a burger but they were all out of burgers, on a Tuesday night at 8pm..  I charged my order to a hand tossed pizza. They were out of that as well! Waiter tells me someone in their ordering department screwed up.. Knowing this, he should have let us know prior to ordering what they are out instead of asking me to change my order twice!  Our drinks (Pepsi and water, including refills) were brought to our table flat, no ice! So strange. Anyway the food wasn't good - we ordered a pizzokie which was burnt on top! Such a restaurant fail in every aspect. We couldn't believe it. Won't be back to this location. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that provide MUCH better food & service. Step-up your game managers..."
Erlich B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,61,20,2.0,1/18/2013,"BJ's is never my first choice of restaurants, but I inevitably end up here now and again. However, my previous visit might be the last. It wasn't terribly crowded when I went, but they seated my party of 2 upstairs by ourselves -- strange. I think the waiters were in between shifts ( I hope) because the service was terrible. The waiter barely made eye contact, but whatever, I'm here for the food. Unfortunately, the burger I ordered was substituted with a char burnt rubber sole. Seriously, someone's walking around with only one Chuck Taylor.  I can't fathom ever having an enjoyable dining experience here. I don't think the employees like their jobs either. I recommend you eat elsewhere."
Stacey T.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,42,3,3.0,12/19/2014,Came here for a work holiday lunch.  The organizer pre-ordered the food so our food came out fairly quickly.  Servers were attentive.  Food was just okay.
Paggi S.,"Northridge, CA",2,25,4,2.0,1/12/2013,No Martinis n cocktails on menu Worst strawberry Mocktail I drank Dry chicken wings Cramped Immature Waiters The worst of all the BJs I have been to :-|
Mary K M.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",33,17,9,1.0,1/8/2015,Didn't even make it to be seated. Guy wants to save all of the booths for other people who come in. All five. Ok.
Elizabeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",415,65,15,3.0,7/12/2011,"It's a bit on the pricey side but pretty a-okay. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps to share with my friend as an appetizer. The chicken was pretty nicely seasoned, but the hot chinese mustard sauce was super overwhelming! It might have also been because I am not a fan of hot mustard sauce, wasabi, and sauces of that sort. It was good with the sesame soy sauce. Also, it was a healthy choice! So if you're looking for something yum and good for you, this is fit for you! For the main course, my friend and I shared a small southwestern pizza. Since we are relatively small girls who were saving some space for dessert, the small ended up being alot so we to-goed the leftover two slices. But the pizza was pleasant. Of course, no deep dish pizza in California can compare to the OG deep dish pizzas of Chicago but it was okay.  But I would say the dessert was the best part of our meal! I usually don't have much of a sweet tooth but the red velvet pizookie was YUMMILICIOUS! the cookie was hot and soft, and complimented the vanilla ice cream very nicely. It was a nice change from the normal chocolate chip cookie."
Jacob S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",129,113,8,2.0,5/3/2014,"I am giving two stars, because I enjoy the food, but I gotta take 3 stars out because of their service. It seems like they are always under-staff. There is only ONE girl that always does a great job serving us, the rest of the staff always mess up our order. We used to go there every week, and every week they mess up our order. Food is pretty darn good, but the service is horrible."
Jennifer H.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,1/10/2015,"I would not recommend this restaurant. I definitely did not expect high quality service because this is just an ordinary American restaurant, but the service here was really odd and bizarre. It was really weird. I just could not understand how this could happen. I will not go into detail because it's a really long story. I would say, if you want to spend a good time, do not go here, but if you must, go at your own risk.  Food was just average, the type of food you can get at any typical average American restaurant. It took really long for the appetizer to come out. Waited for about 30~40 minutes, I think. Talked to the manager, and when I was leaving, the manager and the servers kind of mocked in our back. I heard the laugh.  I mean, have the decency to at least wait until the customers are out and cannot hear it or just do it in front of our faces without being fake nice. But for those who do go to this restaurant, I hope you have a good experience. Just don't expect much. I know people have different experiences at restaurants. Thank you for reading!"
Hilary L.,"Brooklyn, NY",534,8,,1.0,3/2/2012,"I'VE GOTTEN FOOD POISONING TWO TIMES AT THIS LOCATION. Don't worry I'm not stupid--I don't choose to eat here so that I could get sick again. Of the four times I've come here, only the first was by choice. Other times were work-related, etc. Think about it though--that's a 50% poison rate. And I'm not the only one who's been sick here. Likewise, the service was awful. Contrary to what a waiter would be doing, we were the ones waiting on him.  The first time I got sick from this restaurant, I had ordered the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta, sometime last January. This time around, I got the mini deep dish classic combo pizza, which I found a little peculiar that it was served on a plate instead of in the dish it was prepared in, as deep dish pizzas usually are. But I figured--maybe it's because it's a mini. And I figured, I'm getting neither pasta nor seafood. What can possibly go wrong? I STAND CORRECTED. Don't get me wrong, I've always loved BJ's--but it was thanks to this location that I now can't stand pasta--I even feel a little sick sometimes when I think about it, even though I used to love it."
Alex I.,"Beverly Hills, CA",62,123,50,4.0,9/28/2014,Deep dish heaven  vegetable pie is bomb. And the highlight...... PAZOOKI!!! Desert heaven.
Nina F.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",428,250,415,3.0,3/14/2014,"I came here a while ago with a friend to go to BJ's. Funny thing , in New York we have a BJ's wholesale supermarket. lol            Anywhoo , our server was very nice he saw us seated and took care of us right away. The booth we sat in was clean, and no foreign objects were attached to my seat, which was good.           I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered a burger with jalapeno s and guacamole. By the time our food came, I looked at my food and thought: ""I made the right choice.""  After I ate my food, I thought : ""Maybe I made the wrong choice. ""  I had literally no seasoning to my food. Me visiting here I would of thought that's how they do it over here, but I can't believe that, it's impossible. I didn't dare complain about lack of seasoning, I just added some lime and I was good. My friend looked like she was really enjoying her burger. -____- the main event? When our table was cleared off to bring a enormous pizooki. We ordered the chocolate chip cookie with all the fixings on top. It was awesome. Our server was attentive and sweet. But he put his number on the receipt and a smile face, which I thought was distasteful.       My rating is for the cleanliness of the place, and the pizookie, and I guess the service, because it makes me feel that if customers at his table were not attractive, would he still treat them just as nice?"
Alice W.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,213,30,3.0,2/15/2013,"3.5 stars.  You can't really go wrong with BJs (deep dish pizza and delicious shareables, hello!) Their food is awesome, hands down. I love going to any/all BJs. 4 stars for their food.  The only complaint I have about this one in particular is the space. It's small. There is a dining area upstairs, but that also feels dark and cramped. If you dine downstairs, and close enough to the kitchen, you will smell greasy. I have to knock off half a star for this because it actually makes me feel really uncomfortable smelling all that oil/grease from the kitchen."
Riana C.,"San Francisco, CA",243,196,14,2.0,7/11/2012,"Considering this was the first BJ's I ever went to, where I first fell in love with the Great White pizza, and where my boyfriend and I had our first date 4 years ago...I wish I could write this BJ's a nice review. However, the service and management is such a disappointment. This place does get 2 stars, however, because service can be hit or miss. Sometimes, you can get decent service if you're really lucky and its not busy. Although, an empty restaurant still doesn't guarantee decent nor attentive service at this BJ's location. After one unbelievably dreadful visit, I decided to write a little review about my experience to BJ's through their official website. I said nothing nasty, just saying that I will be a returning customer since I am a huge fan of the Great White pizza, but that I really wish service would be more courteous, attentive, and pleasant. The manager of this specific location called me just a day after leaving a VM asking to chat about my experience. I called back a day after and we chatted about the experience. Again, nothing nasty was said nor exchanged and since we stated that we'll be back again, the manager politely offered a gift card and asked for the address to mail it to. I was stoked! However, it has been over 2 months and I have yet to receive such ""giftcard"". I've been in Westwood for over 4 years now, and I will be moving out. I wanted to visit BJ's one last time, but it really looks like this location doesn't value their customers. It really is unfortunate since the Westwood community, particularly UCLA students and employees really do enjoy this pizza treat."
