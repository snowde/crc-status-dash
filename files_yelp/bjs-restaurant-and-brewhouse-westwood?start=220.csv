Dominique M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1969,373,2503,4.0,5/18/2011,Pretty darn good food and I love that ahi poke... I give this place 4 stars because the person who took my order nicely brought over my food to gypsy cafe across the street... Now that is good customer service!
Vivienne N.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,92,74,3.0,3/17/2012,"PIZZA:  I'm not a deep-dish pizza connoisseur, but I actually don't think their pizza or their crust ""is the best"" (as they tout on their take-out boxes and menus). To date, I've had their pizza three times, and not once have I been impressed. The flavor of the bread is a bit off, and there is just too much of it. I'd prefer a crispier crust, and more toppings/filling.   - 2 stars APPETIZERS: are alright. I've had the Ahi (Tuna) Poke once, which I would recommend if you're looking for something light. Today I tried the calamari, which was as mediocre as their pizza.  - 2 stars DESSERT: Of course, go for the pizookie. Crispy crust, with gooey, chocolate-y center topped with vanilla ice cream. But although I find myself loving it in small portions, it's just way too saccharine in large portions.   - Up to 3 stars OVERALL:  For UCLA students, a nice place to grab dinner and a pizookie for a birthday or date--although a bit on the pricier side. Sadly, mediocre food and pizza, though."
Eugi H.,"Los Angeles, CA",732,1274,127,3.0,8/23/2011,"This is one of the most popular restaurants in Westwood, so you can expect about an hour wait at dinner time during the school year. I remember many birthday dinners here. Food is ok, not amazing, but tasty. Their known for their pizza, which is good but not something to right home about. Their bruschetta is pretty tasty though! And their burgers are HUGE - 1/2 pound patties. =X Pizookies are amazing of course. Service is mediocre, slow even when they place is only half full. Overall, just ok."
Brian W.,"West Los Angeles, CA",296,1703,4,2.0,4/24/2010,"It's almost like any other BJ's I've been to... except the wait at dinner time is horrible. They said 20 minutes, they buzzed us around 25 or 30 minutes ""by accident"", then by the time they buzzed us again it was almost 25 minutes after that. Ouch. Food's not bad, pizzas are pretty decent, and the pizookie is not a bad substitute for Diddy Riese when the line at Diddy Riese is totally insane (like today)... and the beer and yes, even the berry cider are pretty good. But... can't get over the line. Ugh."
Zac F.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,12,,4.0,9/11/2013,BJ's crust alone warrants a high rating.  It's deep dish -- sort of.  It's more flaky than a standard deep dish thick crust.  What I mean to say is it's flakiness and buttery goodness will blow your mind.  Their pazookie (giant cookie in a skillet-like pan topped with ice-cream) is amazing and will make you fat.
Tom H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,1,1.0,7/2/2015,"This place left me traumatized, this is what I wrote to corporate but I guess from their silence they don't care: Hello, I've always supported your business for the good it has done promoting craft beer. I must say, however, your UCLA Westwood branch needs a good whipping! First, the greeter, who seamed to mean well, did not even know if the BJ beers were brewed on premises, nor did he express any sincere interest in the subject, I could tell from the way he promoted the ""session IPA"". My wife and I ordered beer. My wife's nut brown was OK, but my ""Imperial Stout"" was poor example. It had a malty sweetness in the beginning, but was insipid. It had a good amount of alcahol though. It was either an attempt not to ""scare"" the customer, a brew by people who don't know/ like the style. Or a first attempt at brewing the beer on a system that the brewers had not yet found little ways to adopt there existing equipment to, or scimping on ingredients. Second, my wife's Bacon Cheese Burger arrived first but very room temp! The french fries were shreds and not conventional as she ordered! Later my wife told me there was a long black hair in it, so she had to attempt to sterilize her pallet with beer and wash her mouth out!!!!!! Third my pizza was horrible!!! I specifically ordered the 15$ deep dish brewhouse, not the 20$!!! It was just above warm, and really under cooked, the vegetables were raw, the cheese and pepperoni were not caramelized and the ""sausages"" were little flavorless prepackaged crumbles (soy!?!) !! It reminded me of some wishy washy limp wristed  vegan pizza that the cook was trying to doctor up to please complaining omnivores!!!!  I lived in Chicago for a whole year and never had a piece of crap like that! I probaly just would have left a negative Yelp comment like everyone else, but at over 60$ I have to make this count, actually, the only reason I didn't complain in person is because I was urged not to and wasn't told about the hair until later!"
Davis T.,"Irvine, CA",560,207,10,5.0,3/24/2012,"BJs. in Westwood.  A good place to get a nice dinner and perhaps watch a game. As with all BJs, there pizzas are quite nice and the pizookies are the best. The place is small, so try to come early to get a nice seat."
Gigi K.,"Orange County, CA",10,185,22,4.0,7/30/2012,"I went to BJ's for an early dinner tonight and had a very positive dining experience! We were seated on the second level, which was a little bit quieter and away from everybody else..very nice after a day of school and work. Our waitress was very pleasant: cheerful, positive, and very quick and helpful. She brought out our drinks quickly and kept them refilled the entire meal without us even having to ask. Additionally, the food came out fast and was very tasty. I ordered the ""Healthier Option"" of mahi-mahi with a rice/pineapple/pepper medley. The meal was satisfying and had the right amount of flavoring and fish. I left very happy.  Some of my favorite dishes: Lettuce shrimp wraps (off the appetizer menu) Ahi Tuna Salad..mm yum!"
Aang A.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,82,14,4.0,5/12/2011,"THe manager john kane, is great.  makes it totally worth going."
Kim V.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,7,7,5.0,5/4/2014,We came for dinner on a weekend the service was great. We got our food so quickly. I had the shrimp scampi and my husband has the cherry chipotle glazed salmon both were delish. Definitely going to come back.
L J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,37,18,2.0,1/12/2014,"Started out good but it did not last.  Had to request water 4 times 2x from Mark our waiter, 1x from the manager & finally Jake the food runner got the water.  After getting us our beers our waiter ignored us. When we needed something we had to flag him down.  The lack of service really overshadowed the whole experience."
Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,205,5,1.0,9/19/2013,How do you just have one bathroom stall for men in a location this big.  I come here for happy hour with friends and I literally have to wait 15 minutes in a long queue just to wash my hands.  Expand the bathroom at least.
Andrew M.,"San Mateo, CA",198,362,13,3.0,6/2/2011,"A typical BJ's. Onto the food! Seared Ahi (appetizer, small bites) = Forgettable. Pass. Gourmet Mac and Cheese = Forgettable. Watery. Not very cheesy. Pass. Avocado Egg Rolls (appetizer) = amazing. Maybe I was just hungry and its true that its a heart attack on a plate, but MAN is this thing delicious. Come with tamarind sauce that tastes good, but could be a little less watery. BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich = Wasn't feeling a burger, so I decided to go with pulled pork. I love pulled pork. And was it good here? Yes, but a little salty. Then again, I love salty. I would get again. BJ's Abbey Normal = surprisingly legit ale. Just hoppy enough, and has a full bodied finish. Went very nice with my pulled pork. Good vibe, good service, decent food (now I know what to avoid). Would come again."
Christy M.,"San Fernando, CA",16,19,3,5.0,9/24/2013,"Great service, celebrated my birthday with my family Maria served our table and she was amazing very attentive and I got a free pazooki for my birthday. Wait was an hour long but since we were a big group we got a table in less than 5 minutes! Second time there and havent been disappointed yet. Keep it up"
Quinton P.,"Westwood, CA",6,34,,1.0,3/26/2014,"Half of our parties orders were wrong.  The waitress then returned with one of the dishes and said ""Can you point out the onions?"" (As if we were trying to pull something). When we did, she disappeared for the second time and did not return with the corrected dish until we called the manager over.  They offered us a free desert as if more bad food was a solution to the fact that half our party had already finished their meal before the others were served.  A complete disaster.  There are so many other places to eat in Westwood.  We won't be back."
Danielle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,685,118,1.0,5/27/2009,"After having a stunning dinner salad for $5.95 at Senor Fred in Sherman Oaks, it made me realize even further how pathetic my $5.25 dinner salad at BJ's was. The dinner salad at Senor Fred had fresh mixed baby field greens plus tons of chopped tomato, chopped cucumber, carrot shreds and tasty balsamic vinaigrette.  Senor Fred loaded on the veggies.  The salad was filling and almost spoiled my meal. In contrast, the BJ's dinner salad was iceberg lettuce and barely anything else (2 disgusting translucent, water logged cucumber slices and a few greasy croutons).  BJ's probably spent 25 cents on my salad.  Senior Fred probably spent $2 on my salad.  That's the difference between a good restaurant and a slop house.  And I forgot to mention why all I had was a dinner salad (and part of my friend's diseased potato):  the waitress gave me incorrect info about my entree when I was ordering.  When it arrived, it was something totally different than she told me it would be so I couldn't have it.  The dinner salad which should have been only $2.95 as an add on, turned into $5.25 (I was penalized for sending back my entree even though the waitress described it wrong due to lack of knowledge)."
Arman P.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,19,,3.0,9/24/2011,"I used to be fan of Bjs, however this Bjs in Westwood is not serving it's customer correctly. Last time I was there, o had to wait for 45 min till the server come an take my order. They are so slow. The quality of the food compare to the price is not that good.  If you want to spend some times with friends, it's a ok restaurant since the bears are ok. However I don't recommend to take your date there"
Vanessa F.,"Culver City, CA",583,365,224,4.0,12/27/2010,"One phrase: ""LUNCH SPECIALS"" I'm not sure what's on the lunch special menu anymore or if they've changed but I remember coming here A LOT with the bf to get these things bc they were such a great deal.  I also really liked their tomato bisque that was included so why the hell not for less than $10. Depp dish pizza's are not as good as at Uno's in SD/Chi-town...I'm not quite sure why I used to order them so much... @_@ They have a decent selection of beers here & they are always coming up with new seasonal beers that can be fun to taste.  I also think their happy hour deals are decent...but I would def pick palomino's happy hour over BJs. Pazooki's are always a treat although I think I've exhausted my sweet tooth here so I rarely order them anymore...but if you've never had them then you should definitely get white chocolate mac nut cookie w/ vanilla bean!! YUM The line at this particular location can get really long so call ahead to make sure the wait is bearable...or if all else fails, order take out!"
Jamie Y.,"New York, NY",2,62,59,3.0,3/24/2014,I got the chocolate chunk Pizookie and it was amazinggggggg
Margaret R.,"Santa Clara, CA",186,1012,34,3.0,10/1/2009,"The food is alright, which was expected. We got three medium pizzas (bj fav, buffalo chicken and southwestern). All were okay - heavy and flavorful. They were expensive at $20 each...can't I get three med pizzas at Pizza Hut for $15 total? Service was EXTREMELY slow. We were sitting there for thirty min before our waitress came to take our orders after we had already asked 5 waiters that passed by to do so. And then we waited another hour before the food came. This place is busy with all the college students. We got out appetizer comped bc of the slow service but I think the waitress was upset that we requested it. However, we did feel the experience was better bc of the comp. The pizookie is delicious, but just go to Diddy Reese's across the street..."
