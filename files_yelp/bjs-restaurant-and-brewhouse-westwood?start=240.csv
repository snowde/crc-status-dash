KK -.,"San Mateo, CA",77,304,125,2.0,3/13/2012,"This place is really very ""meh."" Yes, I know it is a chain restaurant and there should not be high expectations held...but come on! I enjoy the restaurant when I dine there in Orange County - can't Los Angeles provide me the same experience? Guess not. The girls and I decided to come here during Dank Restaurant Deals week for Westwood and UCLA students. I also have still never ventured to BJ's in Westwood before, either so I thought it would be good to play it safe with a place that I am familiar with.  Apparently, BJ's gets very busy every day of the week. There were multiple parties waiting outside because it is VERY small inside. I wasn't used to this particluar size of the restaurant since the other BJ's that I've been to are quite roomy. We were given a wait time of about 35-45 minutes, which kind of stunk since we were hungry but we were already there. What are girls to do while they wait for their table? SHOP, OF COURSE! We hit up a store nearby to kill time since it was cramped inside and outside. About 35 minutes later, we come back to BJ's because it was the time that the hostess had originally told us to return. However, when we arrived, not only were the waitresses unhelpful and ignoring us, but when we finally were able to grab her attention, she told us another 15 minutes. Understandable, there are people who are still hanging at their tables even though they're done with their meals and have paid...but the two hostesses at the stand ignored us for a good 5+ minutes...and we were standing right in front of them.  After about 20 MORE minutes, we were seated...at a table that was open for quite a while, we realized. Onto ordering... The girls had been raving about the hand-crafted root beer and how delicious it tasted. I had never tried it before whenever I had gone to a BJ's but I decided to play it safe and have water. I should have ordered my own root beer, because when I tried my friend's drink, it was absolutely FRESH and AMAZING! It wasn't carbonated like your typical root beer and didn't taste like it was filled with preservatives. This root beer was light and didn't burn your throat like the initial taste of soda. Awesome. For food, I decided to go with the BBQ Beef Sandwich with a side of shoe-string thin fries. This dish was honestly just very plain. The sandwich came with tender Angus roast beef in BBQ sauce, melted provolone cheese on a toasted garlic cheese French roll topped with our crunchy, sweet onion strings. The roll was a bit too crunchy... yet soggy and I definitely didn't taste any garlic cheesiness. Sad. The Angus beef was actually tasty - it was thinly sliced and the proportion of the BBQ was nice.  All in all, the sandwich as a whole was just very MEH. It definitely wasn't the greatest BBQ sandwich that I have ever had but I wasn't expecting it to begin with.. My friends ordered mini pizzas and really enjoyed it. I should have gone with a mini pizza, too. Sad life.  It took forever to get seated, forever to get our food, and forever to get our bill...then forever for them to take the bill. SIGH."
Elaine W.,"New York, NY",260,205,65,3.0,12/29/2011,"A solid BJ's location. Can get pretty full at peak hours so be prepared to wait, sometmes a very long time... Food is pretty standard; I'm not really a fan of their deep dish pizzas (they are only okay, honestly, but I guess it's a decent alternative to what you can get at CPK), but they have lots of other options. Plus their pizookie is pretty delicious!"
Kord E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,1.0,2/17/2013,F*ck this place.....and that is the kindest way i can put it. Walked in....was ingored by the hostess and the manager....stood there for about five minutes directly in front of the front desk. They sat people and answered phones. White couple walks through the door after us and they are greeted and put on list instantly. We left and went to california pizza kitchen down the street and had the best dining experience we ever had(no joke). Will not set foot in another bjs.
Andrew K.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,22,3,3.0,7/8/2013,Deep Dish Pizza is good. Beer selection is weak. The BJs IPA is not a good sample of that genre. Great for family night though.
John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,34,21,4.0,3/2/2011,"Still don't know whether this is an acronym or someone's initials...  The lunch specials at BJ's are a great reason to go.  All you can eat soup and salad for under $10 with tip and tax included - and you can mix and match the soups and salads you get.  I really like the tomato bisque or clam chowder.  Dinner, usually expect a wait and the prices are steeper.   The wait staff here is always very attentive and cheerful as well."
Shelly K.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",2,14,,2.0,9/17/2012,"Wow.. how do I start.. The wait was over 45 minutes long and when they sat our group, we had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks. The sampler was terribly flat and was overall a disappointment. The only positive was running to an old friend as we were leaving."
Jessica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,211,82,3.0,1/27/2011,Love me some avocado rolls!!!!  Chicken pasta: its good at first when it's nice and hot. But they don't give you enough sauce.
Allen K.,"Manhattan, NY",43,115,278,2.0,4/21/2013,"Traditional American food, but nothing spectacular about the food. The nice thing about this place is they have a lot of variety on the menu---pizza, burgers, salad, pasta, etc. It's roomy inside with a lot of seating, so it's good place to meet up with co-workers or bigger groups. If you're hanging out with friends on a Friday night and you're looking for a place to get dinner, go eat somewhere less boring."
Steven L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2013,"DO NOT EAT HERE. * Bad Food  -I was FOOD POISONED by the Jalepeno Burger I ordered. It was like some BRIDESMAID shit, no joke. Additionally, it tasted stale and flavorless.  * Terrible Service   -Service is incredibly slow. Our waiter, ALEX, was non-attentive. He was not available when we needed to reorder off the menu, nor was he prompt when we were ready for the bill. Not only this, he forgot to bring us utensils after our food was served, even after he said ""I'll bring you some utensils."" DO NOT PATRON THIS PLACE."
Char M.,"Long Beach, CA",223,490,142,3.0,2/3/2011,The hostess cleaned a table off for us and sat us right away... Our server was Jin and he was awesome!  He was very welcoming and was a hoot to talk to...the table near us wasn't so happy because he spent most of his time talking to us...but we didn't mind...the area this place is in is unbelievable...they literally have anything and everything you could ask for within walking distance...definitely check it out...I'd highly recommend walking across the street to Diddy Reese and treating yourself to an ice cream sandwich...you seriously can't go wrong!
Fippy D.,"La Jolla, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/1/2012,"Food was ok.  Service was horrible.   A woman named Alex introduced herself with a ""hello"" and ""today is my first day.""  What a way to greet a party...  I kept an open mind, she was at least polite. Drinks came fast enough.  When placing order, I asked for the atlantic salmon, which comes with soup or salad.  I chose the clam chowder.  My sister ordered a fish dish as well, and the menu said that it also comes with a side salad or cup of soup.  Alex confidently told my sister that it does not.  This got my attention, because I've read the menu.  But, I let it go. Alex accidentally left a menu on the table, so I took a look at it.  We were right, my sister's dish came with soup or salad. Eventually drink refills came from another server, so Alex must've gotten slammed or overwhelmed.  We flag down this server and mention that one of the meals came with soup or salad, and would like to order it.  We order a salad, no problem. So the main dishes come, no soup or salad.  The server (different from Alex) comes and we tell her.  She comes back with the salad and soup. So, we eat our salad and soup while our main dish sits on the table and gets cold. Food was typical. Nothing special, but it tasted good.  Alex comes by in the MIDDLE of our meal and asks if we want dessert.  We kind of looked at each other as if to say ""uh, we're not even there yet..."" and said, ""Maybe later."" Later never came. Alex never came back to take a dessert order.  My niece and nephew usually like dessert, but said F it because they waited for so long.  We waited close to 25 minutes from the time we were done eating until we got the check. It's been a while since i've had crap service anywhere, so I guess I was due. Alex was nice enough, but she needs more training/experience before her managers throw her on the floor on a Saturday night."
Paolo M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,25,,1.0,5/24/2013,"Have had a bad experience with food several times, most recent, dirty cups, and the cookie desert trio had raw cookie dough on all three cookies how do you mess that up, horrible"
Monica V.,"Ventura, CA",54,108,89,5.0,9/3/2013,I'm sooo American. Pizza and beer are my favorite meal of all time so this place is perfect for me. Pizookies are one of my favorite desserts - warm cookie any flavor you want (and you can mix flavors) plus a huge heaping of ice cream! It's so good. Beer isn't bad either. I like their deep dish pizzas. Great place to eat!
Vivian A.,"Glendale, CA",77,4,2,1.0,2/9/2014,"I was greeted by two servers sprinting to the front desk. Eager service? No. Fighting for tables. When asked to sit at a booth we were told that ""she was kinda busy."" We were one of five parties at the entire restaurant.  Our waitress got our orders wrong the first time. The second time there was a hair in our food.  The worst part of all was the manager who didn't bother to comp our meal or even stop by for a simple table visit.  We were looking forward to a pazookie but our waitress brought the check over without even asking. Then she walked back to the POS and continued texting.  All in all, save your money. The worst hookah lounge will give you better service. If you know Westwood then you'll know what this means."
Rebecca L.,"Solana Beach, CA",3,26,2,5.0,2/8/2014,"This is the best BJs I've been to, and I've been to a lot of them. My server Ana was very personable and took great care of us, the whole vibe is excellent. In the past we've had Zoe as our server - professional and fun. Food esp Pazookies rock. My go-to spot in Westwood."
David J.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",7,50,17,2.0,12/12/2013,"True, as you get older, Westwood gets more confusing, and we stumbled into BJs mostly because we could get a fast beer and a seat. But Lord, thank God the college years are over. Cut-rate food at inflated priced. Four birthday parties. But the staff!!  If the waitress was any perkier she'd explode. And the signature dish is a pizookie?  If you're feeling down about being forty, this place will make you thank God for aging."
Bella S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/29/2015,"Unpleasant experience, rude manager. If you have a special event planned, do not bother coming here. We had a club event here, which I had called and planned for two weeks in advance. I was told by the manager over the phone that I would be able to come 30 mins earlier to rearrange the tables and set up for the event at 7pm. We got there at 6:30, settled down and started rearranging tables. And the waitress who was helping us called me over and literally told me to go to this manager who was on his computer, instead of him coming to talk to me. It was just a really rude thing to do to start with. And he didn't even look up when I went over, and told me that we were bothering other guests. He asked us to leave the restaurant until 7, and it was 6:50! Can you believe me?! We had professionals coming and I was so upset that we had to tell them that we got kicked out. It's like a time-out for 10 mins! When I compromised and asked if we could just stay downstairs in the restaurant, he said 'there's no way u can sit anywhere without disturbing the guests'. Hello? We are guests too and what are we doing that's so disturbing?  I was planning on going to this restaurant for all our following events because of the location and food, but I will not come back here again."
Kikuchiyo S.,"Long Beach, CA",90,247,59,2.0,2/3/2013,"This place unfortunately kept us waiting way way way way way too long. I came here last night with my family because were were hanging at diddy's across the street. So I thought that I wanted to just get an appetizer at Bj's. We were greeted and sat immediately upon coming inside the restaurant, so that was fast. And in the beginning our server was really good but he had to go home and was switched with another waitress. I don't believe it was the waitresses fault but we waited for at least 45 minutes before we saw our pizza come out. By that time I had already comforted and reassured my wife and son more than a dozen times that our food was coming, and to not lose heart its coming. My son was just starving, 45 minutes is a long time to wait anywhere, our waitress was really nice about it though but still that just ruined our whole experience here."
Ry T.,"San Francisco, CA",582,1509,1898,3.0,8/5/2010,"This chain restaurant is located across the street from Mr. Noodle, the other place we were thinking of trying.  We could see the long line across the street at Diddy Riese.   The staff's pretty friendly here.  It's small for a BJ's and they have a few booths.  Jr. yelper ordered a clam chowder and was brought a broccoli cheddar soup instead.  I think it was the mgr who brought the soup and then asked if we wanted the soup (comp) otherwise they'd have to toss it.  So, Jr Yelper 2 accepted it and ate it while telling me it has a lot of cheese.  I tried a spoonful and found it to be quite good. JY #1 had the clam chowder which was OK. The Caesar salad, $9, wasn't as good as the one we had at CA Pizza Kitchen but it was decent and easily shared by 3 w/entree.  Jr. Yelper #1 liked the French dip sandwich w/fries.  The skinny fries are processed, previously frozen and tasted like Burger King fries.   The BJ Burger $9 was good, according to hubby.  Jr. Yelper #2 had the grilled chix pasta, $9.95 and really liked it.  Both JY's had leftovers for the next day.  The fried calamari app, $8.75 was good, but I like the ones at Bucca di Beppo's better.  Milk is $2.25/glass and sodas $2.55.  Lots of UCLA kids with family dine here."
Jeremiah H.,"Santa Maria, CA",87,15,15,4.0,9/30/2013,"Heard a lot of hype about this place. Nice big spot tucked away, something you don't notice until your right next to it. Parking was across the street for five bucks. Probably could have hit the meter, but said screw it case we decided to do something else. City life, haha. Walked in and there's literally one or two tables open, usually a good sign of good food. Quickly greeted an seated, plus #2. Drinks and other info right off the bat, server was on point today. Heard a lot about their signature pizzas, but didn't wanna break the bank so bad, so I stuck with a burger. Felt fancy so got a salad too, haha. Without getting into it too much, the food was great. Service was really good too. A lil more than what I like to spend at burger spot such as itself, but we are in Westwood after all, haha. End of the day, highly recommended if you got a few more bucks than the average starving student. Enjoy ;)"
