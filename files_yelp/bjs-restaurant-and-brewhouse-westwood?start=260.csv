Emanuel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,259,2,3.0,8/21/2011,"I've known BJ's for years. It's a staple in Westwood, next to the Fox Theatre.  The wife and I went here with a few friends. Got here early enough to get a booth. There was a big wait when we left. We only got dessert, which the waitress didn't seem to thrilled about. Pazookies, of course. Good thing is that they now serve a gluten-free one. This made the wife very happy. BJ's are all over LA, and this isn't so different than the rest. Go to this one if you're craving sweets and the Didi Reese across the street is too packed for you."
Jody S.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,263,224,3.0,8/28/2014,"This BJ's is convenient in the heart of Westwood. We were able to get a table for the group right away.  Our waitress was very attentive. I feel bad for the workers who have to come up and down those flight of stairs to get to the customers on the 2nd floor. My favorite is the Gourmet Five Meat deep dish pizza so of course I got this again.  I told my coworkers about the promo I saw running for the 2 for $22 deal but unfortunately we were told that they aren't running this deal here at this time.  I know I saw it just the other day and everyone had to order a different meal. We were also told this is more of an express type of location, so they didn't serve the Rib eye or ribs. =|  We were able to get back to work just in time. However, to my frustration, I received an email later saying specifically that the promo I was interested in was at that location.  This isn't my first choice of the BJ's chain as it has a different menu but it's okay if you want a quick lunch meal with large portions."
Michele P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/21/2015,We were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes.  At 30 mins. We checked in and were told it would be 20 more minutes.  At 50 mins. We checked in to be told there were 2 parties in front of us.  We watched 4 parties get tables and spoke to the manager.  We were told we would get the next table.  Then we watched as another party of 4 get sat before us.  Did I mention the pager we were given never went off.  And we were told by the hostess our name was called (an absolute lie).  At this point the kids are hungry and we have no choice but to eat here tonight.  I will never come back here again.
Lea V.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,180,1,3.0,12/15/2013,This is a solid restaurant for pizza. It can get incredibly loud though. Parking is bad as it is for all of the great spots in Westwood. College punks present.
Grace P.,"San Francisco, CA",105,106,16,3.0,5/25/2010,"A good place for big groups.  Everything is bigger---Deep dish pizza and huge pizookie!   I got their bbq chicken sandwich with thin fries. mm I loveeeee barbeque and just ate the leftovers right now. Even better! They have a huge selection of beers, never tried them though.  There can be a wait on the weekends.  I would come here for their pizookie and hardy food.  A solid 3 stars."
Hank M.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,21,,1.0,3/29/2012,"This was without doubt the absolute worst corporate establishment that I have foolishly stepped foot into since arriving to the United States six-months ago.  The staff was too friendly, too young and eager which almost made up for their total incompetence as we suffered through a pathetically humiliating experience.  I had a better looking meal served through the hole of a dilapidated wooden shack on a dead-end dirt road off the Trans-Siberian highway."
Matt F.,"San Bernardino, CA",120,28,6,4.0,6/2/2011,"In the heart of Westwood, this is the place to have great Pizza.  Can't say much more about BJ's that's not been said but I've not yet been disappointed by them.   Service at this location is generally great, rarely do I have hiccups.  When ever there's an issue the servers and manager are there to take care of us. Love the seasonal beers offered from time to time."
Steve L.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,1190,17,2.0,3/7/2009,"Ditto to everyone who mentions that the location makes this BJ's kind of a bomb.  A bunch of college kids trying to be cool, but unfortunately not quite old enough to order beer yet... What didn't help was that going last night there was a table full of high school kids who must have been out for a dance.   Waitress had this annoying habit of speaking really slow, made it feel like we were in nursery school.  Then again, maybe that's because it's in Bruin country.   The food and beer were good.  Sucks that we didn't get to try the Belgian beer as they didn't offer it in a pitcher... The pizookie definitely gives Diddy Riese a run for their money.  This evening we opted for the pizookie.  If only Diddy Riese microwaved their cookies for a quick moment to warm them up... it'd be a pretty close race. For the college kids... the lure of free food abounds.  Looked like those waiting were given little slivers of free pizza.  Back in the day, may have been worth it to keep sitting on the waiting list, and keep getting free food...."
Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,3.0,11/6/2014,"if this place served real booze, i'd give it 5 stars!! but this location does NOT and it's TINIER than all the other BJ's i've been to!!! but the service/food/vibe is the same as all the others....."
Kristie W.,"Monrovia, CA",6,28,3,2.0,8/26/2013,"Went here for lunch the other day. It wasn't really crowded as the lunch crowd had already come and gone. The waitress informed me twice that she would bring water and both times she forgot. When my salad was brought to me by the runner, I had asked him for a glass of ice water which was delivered immediately. My salad was blah. Just a salad. I had ordered the shrimp tacos. Big mistake. Came with 2 tacos but only had 1 piece of shrimp in each taco. Definitely not worth the money. Though this is a chain, doesn't seem to be consistent with the other BJ's."
Natalia K.,"San Francisco, CA",458,181,52,5.0,5/3/2010,"The menu here is enormous and can understandably be a little overwhelming so here are some of my recommendations: Best Beer: Jeremiah Red Best Pizza: Buffalo Chicken Best Salad: BBQ Chicken Chop Best Pasta: Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta Best Burger: California Burger Best Brunch item: California Scramble (the French Toast is a close second) Best Pizookie: Peanut Butter Parking in Westwood can be difficult, so I recommend parking in the Broxton Parking Garage 1 block south of BJ's. If you enter before 6pm you get two hours free. *Also it isn't really fair for other reviewers to deduct stars for there being a long wait. BJ's is popular for a reason and they can't control how many people decided to come dine here. If you go out for dinner on a Saturday night around 7pm it shouldn't be a shock that you'll most likely have to wait."
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,127,21,3.0,1/25/2011,"I prefer the BJ's restaurant back at home, this one is a little crowded and if you come with 4 or more people make sure to call ahead or you'll be stuck waiting outside for the longest time. I usually like to get ribs , but this place doesn't have them what a bummer. So if I go here I usually get one of the deep dish pizzas which are pretty good. Pricey for pizza , but worth it on some occasions. It's ok at least the pazookies are good enough to make up for the rest !"
Karen E.,"Pasadena, CA",74,222,4,3.0,4/9/2011,"We went to BJs for a co-worker's birthday last week. We got there right before the lunch rush so we were able to get a large booth for our party. Our waiter was ok. He brought our drinks but then took forever to come back to take our food order. I think he was in charge of too tables, which isn't his fault but still inconvenient.  Half of us got our food and the other half had to wait like 15 mins for their food to arrive. Which was ackward since people generally don't like to eat when others are still waiting. The lunch specials are very decently priced for the amount of food we received. It tasted pretty good too. I had a sandwich and a soup. By then end of my meal I felt pretty stuffed.  We had the pizookie (4 of them actually). They were delicious! Overall I would come back but I do hope there's more servers around next time."
Ariella N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,112,,4.0,4/7/2013,"Biiiig party on a Sunday night. The food was good but the service I felt was a bit iffy, and no, we were not welcomed with your slogan...lies. Small appetizers are bombbb. Did not have pizza, instead settled for fish and chips because that can never go wrong :) Pizookie was ammmmazing! Excep for the fact that I barely got to eat any of it, cause someone decided to give me the smallest slice that I ordered...rude much. Still bitter."
Teresa S.,"Orange County, CA",447,191,197,4.0,2/7/2011,"I'm glad we stopped in.  My friend and I were on our way home from Magic Mountain when I mentioned stopping off for a Diddy Riese ice cream sandwhich.  So we pulled off the freeway and parked right in front of BJ's and decided to eat first.  Since there were only the two of us, we we taken before some other people waiting (who gave us stink eye for it) and were sat upstairs.  I didn't even know that little nook existed.   Jin was our server and he was AWESOME!  if you're like me there are only 2 main things that make my experience at a restaurant good....the food and the service.  I could care less if the decor is amazing....and here the food is consistently good.  But that night the service was the crowning glory for me.  He was efficient and a blast to talk to.  We left full and content.  Since we have alot of BJ's restaurants nearby, we passed on the famous and wonderful Pizzookie for Diddy Riese.  Though any other time we'd for sure go for the pizzookie!   Special shout out to our awesome server Jin!!"
Shane M.,"Nashville, TN",420,21,,1.0,6/24/2010,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while, because it stands out as my worst restaurant experience - ever. I was with a small group - 3 other people. We came in, sat down, and were handed menu's. It took us 30 minutes to get drinks, and about 45 minutes to order. It wasn't really busy, but our waitress seemed busy texting. We ordered our food after about an hour. It came an hour later. I'm not sure what was going on here. But it was an amusingly bad experience. It was bad enough, that I got past being mad, and now Iaugh about it."
Annie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,128,,3.0,4/26/2011,"Have been twice - first time it was frusterating, slow service, waiters switching shifts in-between our meals and forgetting to put an order from our table in, had to beg for drink refills etc. (and begging for a refill for an alcoholic beverage is like unheard of right?) Second time was really good - attentive waiter, great buffalo chicken pizza and fish tacos mmmm. I get its a brewery and all but can we step up the wine list? Who wants to drink a 6 dollar glass of barefoot wine? Thats borderline obscene. They sell barefoot at 711."
Neil T.,"Portland, OR",0,67,5,1.0,4/17/2012,Came here for lunch.  Seated promptly - but waited 15 minutes without ever seeing a server!!   The placed did not seem that busy either.  We left so cannot comment on the food.
Julia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,66,93,2.0,1/28/2013,"The food is pretty inconsistent. It can be pretty good, or it can be really bad. I used to love BJ's but lately it's been getting worse. Last time I ordered the Santa Fe salad with salmon. The salad was 50% croutons and the salmon was disgustingly salty. It tasted like pure salt. I seriously could not eat that thing, I'm not being picky here it was really a salt overload. If I do come back it'd be only for the pizookie!"
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,,1.0,9/22/2012,"I've come here many times but will NEVER return.  I had a large group for my birthday and it was a terrible experience.  First, since large groups have automatic gratuity, the waitress had absolutely NO incentive to give good service, and it showed.  It took forever to flag her down to order anything, and she disappeared for a good 15 minutes straight when we were trying to order our food. Then they started bringing things to our table that we did not order (including an entire pizza and a couple drinks), and acted rudely when we explained we hadn't ordered those things.  Later, my friend had ordered a side salad, but they brought him the entree size.  When he explained he only wanted the smaller size, the busboy just said he would leave the entree size at our table and we could ""figure it out"" later.  Of course, no side salad ever came, but we were charged for the full entree size! When it came time to pay the bill, things got really bad.  Having a large group is complicated (and of course, they don't provide any ability to have separate checks), and we were confused by how much money we apparently owed.  After having everyone at the table go through the receipt line by line, we realized we were charged for an entire pizza, a pitcher of beer, and two pints that we never ordered OR received.  When we pointed this out, the waitress was rude to us, took the receipt we had which had all our notes on how much each person owed and which items they got, and brought us a new receipt that was about $20 less.  So we had to repeat the entire process again.  At this point, because the waitress kept disappearing, it had already taken well over half an hour just to figure out the check!  We were fed up with the process, and finally agreed to just pay the check as is, because we just wanted to leave. After we signed our receipts, the waitress told us that we were $24 over.  We were so tired of being in that awful place that we didn't even care about them overcharging us.  We left, and when I was walking down the street, the waitress came running after me.  Apparently, even though she never came to our table, she had no problem finding me in the street.  She then told me we were actually $24 UNDER, so I had to go back in and pay the remaining $24.  She then cracked a dumb joke about me having to pay on my own birthday, as if that was going to make me feel any better about the whole experience. I will NEVER come back to this BJs, and probably not any BJs.  I had a good birthday tradition going for three years, but it's over now.  I can't believe how much money we had to pay for terrible service (no choice because it's automatic gratuity!) and mediocre food (which, by the way, is one of the cheapest and easiest foods to make).  It was embarrassing for me and my friends, and we all had to pay way more than we should have just to leave that awful place.  Oh, and to cap it all off, the birthday pizookie is now about the size of a thimble.  It used to be wayyy bigger. So we had awful service, were charged way too much, were forced to give an 18% tip on an inflated bill, and spent almost an hour just trying to settle the check.  What a terrible way to celebrate a birthday.  I wouldn't even go back if they gave me a free pizza. EDIT: I called and spoke with the manager, who was very nice and understanding.  Truthfully, he said all the right things, and I am appreciative.  I liked BJs before, so maybe I will give them another chance someday, but not anytime soon."
