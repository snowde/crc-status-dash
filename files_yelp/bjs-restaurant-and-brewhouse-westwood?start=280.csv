Shawn D.,"Woodland, CA",2,41,10,2.0,9/7/2012,"I guess you could call this place a brewhouse. I suppose their beer could be brewed by their company, but there was no proof to that. The beer was mediocre at best. The ahi poke I had for dinner was good. Too many TVs all over the place."
V. V.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,48,6,3.0,4/14/2013,I like that they write the calorie content of all their food. What I don't like IS the calorie content of all their food - good luck getting a meal under 850 calories!
Cynthia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",514,61,6,4.0,4/12/2012,I had the seared ahi tuna salad and it was AH MAZING !!! I should have snapped a pictures!!!!!!!!! darn it!  a little slow on the service but the food was great!
Tomaso G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,62,16,2.0,8/14/2012,Brian our server did a good job.  Greeter cutie tho was copping an attitute.  not a smile. no half decent welcome.  directed us four big guys to the small booth??? she must have been on crack.  asked for a tbl instead.  the burger waz tasty but cold.  very dissapointed.  there was a piece of wax paper stuck to the patty. good thing coworker noticed it so i yanked it out.  brian apologized but it wasn't all his fault.   i really tried to like this joint but just something like this seems to ruin the experience.  will not visit this place again. Piece out!
Rika M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",0,27,,2.0,10/29/2012,"Eeks. I like BJ's in general, but unfortunately, this location really lacks in service. The food wasn't that hot when served, and the drinks were meh. Wasn't that crowded but we felt rushed through our meal, and our check was dropped mid- entre, after asking us if we wanted dessert. We might have kept drinking/paying, but oh well."
San K.,"Westwood, CA",9,133,1,5.0,7/17/2012,Great lunch specials! Can get a personal pizza and a salad for $7 plus tax and tip. Not bad!
Tiffany B.,"Boston, MA",854,264,802,2.0,9/27/2010,"If you are looking for happy hour, avoid this place because they don't have it. This BJ's is a half-assed BJ's & by that, I mean that it is just a restaurant with no bar & pre-mixed drinks.  Service: The service is really friendly & our waitress was really nice. She recommended my friend a drink & then later found out that they were out. She also told us that the drinks my friend ordered were premixed, so it's not like I'm not sprouting this information out of my butt. Prices: Normal prices you'd expect from an American restaurant. Food: The food is average, nothing absolutely delicious, but it's BJs. Their appetizers are probably the best things on their menu. I got the Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps. Quite difficult to eat without it spilling all over the place, but it wasn't bad. I really think that these menu items should be renamed to ""Thai inspired"" or ""Thai styled"" instead of just ""Thai"" because it's not very ""Thai"" at all.  Avocado eggrolls were pretty good. They're really similar to the ones from the Cheesecake Factory although their dipping sauces differ. My friend thought her drink tasted more ""fruit punchy"" than an alcoholic beverage, so she requested for a little more vodka in her drink. That's when our waitress informed us that the drinks are premixed & they don't have any vodka available to adjust the drink. Major disappointment. Environment: 1.5 story restaurant as the room up top is fit for a party of maybe 15+ people. There's no bar. I don't think I can get over that & I don't even drink. There's no bar...there's no happy bar. WHAT IS THIS? It's not BJ's! It's a restaurant with BJ's menu, but not the same environment!  Not returning here."
Leonel V.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,33,3,2.0,1/26/2011,"Got the shrimp scampi, it was 14.95 and there was more than enough to feed me. Its enough to share with another person but the meal itself wasn't very appealing. Given how expensive and bland the meal was, I'd rather just go to In-N-Out at 11:30 pm."
Bonnie S.,"San Francisco, CA",49,208,176,3.0,1/22/2011,"I came here with a large group of friends, so we made a reservation ahead of time. However, we still had to wait at least 30 minutes for seating, which was annoying. Luckily, this BJ's is conveniently located in Westwood, so there were a lot of other places nearby to browse. Really nice environment.  Although service was great, the food was quite average. I ordered an Angel Hair Toscana, which was a bit bland and dry, as if it were overcooked. The portions are huge, and I was unable to finish it, but it wasn't that great anyway so I didn't take it out. I think it really depends on what you order though. My friend ordered Jambalaya, which was tasty. Overall, their pastas are very unflattering but their deep dish pizzas are better. Their portions are huge but not relaly delicately cooked, which is expected for such large portions. It's best to come here when you haven'e eaten all day."
Erin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",581,496,144,4.0,1/14/2012,"BJ's opens at 11.  I got there at 10:20am. Sigh..  Returned at 11:03, got seated, and stared at the menu for a long ass time. I was so famished, I couldn't decide what to get because I wanted to eat EVERYTHING. Our waiter was very patient with us and kept periodically checking on us in case we decided on anything LOL - spinach and artichoke dip: I can never get over how good this is. Not sure if it's just good at BJ's but just .. generally: this appetizer is ALWAYS a good choice. - california burger: I LOVE ME A GOOD BURGER, AND THIS ONE WAS GOOOOOOOOOOOD. sourdough bread, medium rare, avocado, grilled chilis (i think), cilantro.. I guess sourdough burgers are more like a sandwich, but it was super tasty. DEF REC THIS ONE. - small pizza (half Mediterranean, half great white): did you know you can order pizzas half and half (as long as it's not a mini sized one)?? Anyway, the mediterranean one is NOT GOOD AT ALL. I'm not usually a fan of medi food, but my friend wanted it, so I gave it a try. Olives were WAY too salty, feta cheese too sour, and mehhh not my fave. As for the Great White, I can now officially announce that it is too salty for me to ever order again. Alas, the first time it was so delightful, the 2nd time I thought it was just a bad day, but 3rd time confirms it. Never again. - beer in a 750ml bottle: it was some kind of Belgian ale. It was really light and kind of fruity, and just overall wtver. I should have just ordered one of their standard house brews. It was reallllllllly foamy, too. So strange. - classic pazookie: did you know they have mini pazookies? Just one scoop of ice cream and one kind of cookie. It's small but enough for you to enjoy the warm gooey goodness of a pazookie :D"
Michael L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,6,4.0,12/20/2009,"Good:  - Delicious deep dish pizza.  - Surprisingly good salmon and pasta dishes.  - Pretty tasty (if overpriced) brunch items on weekends. Love the California scramble - an omelette with avocado sliced in.  - Delicious microbrews! If you like Guiness, definitely give their porter a try.  - Great for big groups... and they always show Chargers games on the big screen. :) Bad:  - There can be long waits for dinner, especially if school is in session. They usually give out free pizza samples on nights with long waits, though.  - Not a fan of the sandwiches - the ""angus beef"" burgers always taste overcooked and the cold cut sandwiches are way pricey. When To Go:   - You want to enjoy great-tasting pizza and delicious beer with your friends. Tips:  - ""Four toppings OR MORE"" is a price category. So a pizza with 4 toppings costs the same as a pizza with 18 toppings - and yes, I've ordered a pizza with 18 toppings. :)  - They will still make chili cheese fries if you ask for it. You can also add bacon on this.  - You can order chili cheese (+bacon) onion strings (aka, a DEATH BLOSSOM), which are FANTASTIC.  - Free mini-pizookie (pizza-sized cookie with ice cream) on your birthday. Parking: Go the other side of Broxton (half a block east of the Broxton/Weyburn intersection) and go to the parking building on the left. It's free for 2 hours if you get in before 6pm, $3 flat rate after. If you show up after 6pm, you can also try the parking lot on the right, which is the same price but easier to leave (sometimes there's a wait getting out of the parking structure). Bottomline: Hands down, the tastiest pizza and beer in Westwood - though a little pricier than the alternatives."
Mark B.,"Lafayette, CA",10,54,5,3.0,12/25/2010,"It's never a good sign when you visit an empty restaurant on Xmas Eve in Los Angeles.  This is because the ratio of Jews:Open Restaurants on Christmas in Los Angeles is really high.  For you liberal arts majors, this means there are a lot of hungry Jews (yours truly included) and not a lot of dining options.  As you may have surmised, we walked in the place and I didn't see many members of the tribe.  In fact, I was wondering if they were already closing up for the evening (wishful thinking). The Deep Dish pizza might taste good if: a) you've never had Deep Dish Pizza; b) you've only had frozen Deep Dish Pizza, or c) you haven't eaten in ten days.  Is there a sauce shortage in Los Angeles that hasn't hit the newspapers?  Maybe it's me but I really like to have some sauce on my pizzas. On the brighter side, the chopped salads were chopped. The appetizers were the kind of appetizers that really fill you up and make you feel lousy midway through your meal.  Since I had only eaten an Oatmeal cookie that morning (I thought Jews were supposed to fast on Christmas), I was famished and grabbed a few of the appetizers ... about five to ten minutes before they grabbed me. The Berries Beer was quite tasty (yes, I'm in touch with my feminine side) and the desserts were good.  We also had a ton of leftovers (no surprise there) but what good are they when they taste lousy."
Eric T.,"New York, NY",68,166,86,3.0,11/17/2009,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place. I really do think it has some of the better bar-style food in West LA, but it's the service that really takes it down a notch. They have a few flat screens that aren't well placed, but you can still follow whatever game is on at the time. BJ's is a solid chain that I can rely on for cheesy, chewy, thick, deep dish pizzas. I've been ordering the BBQ chicken pizza since I was a kid and it's always been solid. The spinach and artichoke pizza is good as well, which can also be found in dip and calzone form. If you like doughy bread, the pizzas and calzones are for you. The also have a good line of starters: nachos, spring rolls, chicken tenders, etc...  For a sandwich, the turkey cobb is solid, again with the doughy, cheese bread, bacon and bleu cheese sauce.   Their list of microbrews has been the same for years and offers a great variety from a light blonde ale to the dark porter and stout. The Piranha Pale Ale is a past favorite. They recently started brewing their own root beer which is made without high fructose corn syrup and actually tastes very good. Free refills on this too.  The pizookie (deep dish cookie) desserts are easily the best item on the menu. Save room. They have many flavors available, but I always go with the classic chocolate chip cookie with scoops of ice cream on top. It's very very good. They seem to have UCLA students staffing the place and the service is slow and many times I have had my food served incorrectly. However, if you make no substitutions or alterations you should be fine.  BJ's is always a safe option when I am in unfamiliar territory, loooking for some bar food. Rarely will I go there if I find myself hungry in Westwood."
Chanh H.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,68,,3.0,3/17/2012,"Had lunch here with my gf.  Nothing special.  Service was good, but i figure that was more a result of the emptiness of the restaurant.  Had the cheeseburger deep dish pizza.  Wasn't good, but I can't really fault them because it did taste like a cheeseburger pizza..."
Kris P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,43,1,3.0,8/20/2012,"Food is pretty good, standard chain-restaurant fare.  Headed toward Cheesecake Factory territory though with almost too many choices it's like sensory overload trying to make a decision looking at the menu."
N M.,"London, United Kingdom",10,63,8,1.0,12/5/2009,"One of BJs company's core values is ""never lose a customer"" (it says so on their registers). Well apparently whenever it gets busy at this location the managers throw that right out the window!  We were booted from the place with no food or drinks because the rest of our party had been there for ""too long."" Even when the rest of the group took off shortly after we got there, they wouldn't let us continue to order and eat, and made ZERO attempt to find any kind of solution to the problem. They cancelled the orders we'd given to the waiter and basically said, ""better luck next time!"" The real bummer was that I had been seriously craving one particular pizza all day after thinking about it for weeks (yes, when you catch me daydreaming I'm usually thinking about food), but I was so put off by the way they treated us that I didn't even want to order it to go.  When will I finally get the satisfaction of my (2nd) favorite pesto pizza (see Upper Crust in Boston)??!!?!?!?!! I guess the search continues. Anyway, to be honest I understand the situation they were in--busy night, need the tables. But if your company is BUILT on keeping your customers happy this was the worst way to show it. The managers should make an effort to make things right, NOT be the ones who kick out well-paying and good-tipping customers who just want the satisfaction of some good pizza and cider. Compared to the other locations the customer service here SUCKS. Oh, and in case you need more reasons, there's always a wait and parking's impossible. So there."
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",631,19,3,1.0,10/7/2011,"i had a party to attend nearby, and BJ's was the place my friends chose to grab late night food. i don't expect MUCH from chain restaurants, but having been in the restaurant business for years, i do have basic standards that i'm surprised (some) other people lack.  we were greeted half-heartedly by a random server (no hostess), but our actual server was rather friendly. i ordered from the kids menu since i knew the portion of any entree i ordered would be super-sized. i wanted pasta. we also ordered a few beers and a couple glasses of wine. then our server disappeared. literally. we were checked on by another random server, whom we realized took over our table (or all of them) without an introduction that he was our new server (pretty standard). i counted my table of 4, another party of 8, another table of 4 next to us, and a couple in a booth nearby for a revolving staff of 4 on the floor, plus the manager, who was actually the only person running the food in and out of kitchen. when we (were finally able to grab our 2nd server and) asked for the check, the 3rd random server we were able to grab when he, too, disappeared, THREW us a pen when the one we were originally given was empty....  at this point... we're still watching the manager do everyone else's work, on top of his own. we looked around and found his staff (both on and off duty) huddling over a corner booth laughing at whatever was so funny on a cell phone.  flabbergasted, we finish our drinks and got the heck out of there. 3 out of 4 of us in my party being hospitality vets... we're embarrassed for this location.  if management cares... this was Thursday, September 29 -- my card was swiped at 11:21pm."
Courtney L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,136,6,4.0,12/23/2010,"I'm a creature of habit.  Being a UCLA undergrad, I spent a lot of time in Westwood, and I tended to eat at the same restaurants again and again and again.  This was one of them.  I also usually ate the same thing every time = the halibut fish tacos.  (They are AMAZING by the way).  Eventually, I realized that I should try other things as well.   I tried the pizza.  Delicious. I tried the avocado egg rolls.  One of the best appetizers I've ever had. I tried their beers.  Great. I'm a pescetarian (the only meat I eat is seafood), so I cannot vouch for any of the meat dishes, but my boyfriend loves the chicken fettuccine Alfredo, and a lot of my friends love the BBQ chicken pizza and the Cobb salad. Anyway, I've liked every single thing I've tried, and I don't think I've ever met anyone who has been disappointed. And, let's be honest...with a name like ""BJ's,"" it's gotta be good!"
Nok S.,"Cypress, CA",41,61,,3.0,1/23/2011,"Small compared to other BJ's. If you seat at the top, please be careful with your utensils. Easily to fall down from the holes and can drop on customers or the staffs. Imagine your knife or fork falling down onto someone's head. Don't think it'd be a pretty site but luckily the hospital is close by. Good place to go for celebration or special occasion with your boss since there aren't that many special places around Westwood."
Hannah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,4.0,11/14/2013,"Sports bar setting with one of LA's best desserts! The famous pizzokie is a freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top that's big enough to share.  For the entree, the pizzas are hand tossed and everything tastes extremely fresh.  You'll find quite good business and really friendly service.  may be a bit pricier but it's not too bad as a solid lunch place.  More so, the location is key: lot's a parking and places to walk off the food coma."
