Hazel A.,"Union City, CA",54,112,1,4.0,7/7/2010,"One of my fave places to go in L.A., why? Have dinner here, cross the street and get some Diddy Riese! This is also, one of the smallest BJ's I've seen, but I haven't had a dull moment here.  The first time I ever tried the beer sampler was here, and I got pretty tipsy -- but that's because I'm not that big on beer, so I ended up chugging most of my beers to keep it down.  I really like the blonde beer they have to offer, it's really great. Pizookie's are bomb, but when i have to choose between diddy riese and bj's I always have a hard time choosing.  I guess my advice would be just get the pizookie and get a dozen diddy riese cookies to go for later."
B E.,"San Gabriel, CA",48,31,29,1.0,12/8/2012,This BJ's is tiny and has horrendous service. I asked the hostess to put my name down and she said 'in a minute'. Asked again 5 minutes later and same response. 10 minutes after that we were finally sat and waited another 20 minutes to be greeted and ended up walking out. Horrendous...
nova z.,"Mission Hills, CA",183,42,3,3.0,10/25/2010,"If you're looking for steak that is cooked well and not that pricey like other places.. Service was good, not great. Server was not as bright as would've originally thought.  The atmosphere was friendly,"
Loren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,2.0,3/21/2013,Spent over $13 for a personal hand tossed crust pizza.  was not delicious at all. Overpriced and not good. Seriously.
Amber B.,"Playa Vista, CA",1794,501,221,2.0,7/23/2009,"What more can really be said about BJ's? It's a chain, with mediocre food overall. I used to eat and drink here all the time in college - back when it was just a stumble away from my apartment so I could binge on all the beer I wanted and not have to worry about how I was going to make it home. This location also made for a popular meeting spot for all kinds of UCLA club/group activities - I remember holding a Hapa Club Welcome Back dinner here at least once. Back then I would stuff myself silly with pizookies (Are they even that great? They have ZERO appeal to me now), the potato wedges, the pizzas, burgers and of course it was all about the beer sampler! You actually get a good amount of beer for what you're paying. Flash forward a couple years to now. For some reason we receive about 1,000 ""Guest Appreciation Cards"" at my office good for either $5, $10, or $500. Even with the promise of basically unlimited free meals until the expiration date I didn't make it over to BJ's until one day before the end of the promo. Showed up for lunch and I think the only really positive thing I have to say about this last visit is that we were seated immediately and we had an excellent table upstairs with a view of the floor below so we could people watch...oh and our waiter, Blake, was real sweet.  So, my lunch companion's wedge salad and baked potato came out within a few minutes...yet I sat there for a good 10-15 minutes longer with nothing in front of me but my lemon water. Finally my cheddar broccoli soup came out, but not my BBQ chicken salad. I tried to eat the soup but in all honestly it was disgusting. It tasted like burned cheese for one thing AND there was wayyyyy too much cheese thrown on top. The cheese-to-broccoli ratio was atrocious. I don't even think I found a solid piece of broccoli in the entire bowl. I tried to stomach the soup because I was so hungry but I just couldn't do it. It took another 10 minutes for my salad to arrive and it was just meh...not very much chicken in it at all. So after a very dissatisfying lunch I still managed to walk away not feeling TOO bummed - I only had to shell out about 5 bucks to cover the tip!"
Tien N.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,75,,3.0,12/7/2010,"This BJs is alright but could be much better. Since this is the closest BJs to where I live I tend to frequent this place.  the good things about this place: - People watching, a lot of times some very cute girls will come in. A meal + eye candy = an experience - the TVs are usually put onto a sporting event - A diddy reese across the street the bad things: - parking, like most of westwood sucks major ***** - There's no bar, so to have a beer me and my friends had to sit down at a table and look like we were eating. This wouldn't be so bad except for the fact there was a family with two kids about 7 & 9 looking anxious to eat and all I could think to myself is ""wow are we major A-holes for taking up this table to drink some beer while a family awaits a table to have a dinner.""  - Very small, and I mean small. My apt while I was attending school was larger than this place. all in all if you want your BJs casual dining fix, this place is good for it, just don't go in expecting to be seated at a bar and be careful you might elbow the guy next to you feeding his girlfriend a slice of pizza."
Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,62,39,3.0,9/21/2010,"In my mind, BJ's is more of a birthday celebration place than anything else.  My roomie wanted to go out for dinner, so we decided to walk down the street to BJ's on a whim last night. We shared a wedge salad, a bowl of clam chowder, and the BBQ pulled pork sliders.  The clam chowder tasted pretty good, but it's not like the clam chowder I'm used to.  It seemed to be thickened with corn starch, like a Chinese chicken corn soup, and it wasn't creamy and opaque like all the other clam chowder I've ever had.  Didn't taste too bad and had lots of clam chunks, but my roomie and I agreed that it tasted more like a potato soup. I liked the sliders.  The dish comes with four baby sandwiches, which is a nice upgrade from the three that every other restaurant serves.  We asked for more BBQ sauce, but only because we love to dip.  The thin cut fries are nice and crunchy!  They give a good ketchup-to-fry ratio.  Like I said, we love to dip. I'm giving three stars, but I think this location deserves to be bumped down a half star for the service.  We sat next to a table where an off-duty server was sitting and having a meal.  Our server seemed to be more interested in hearing what her friend was ordering and chatting with her than checking in on us.  Not to mention, we felt rushed into ordering before we had really decided on what we wanted.  I'm sure this was an off night, since the other times I've been here service has been fine.  Maybe when I come here for another birthday dinner I'll be able to add another star."
Don R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,61,,3.0,5/27/2013,Jeremiah red and margarita pizza for a nice happy hour retreat. The portebello deep dish was great too. Poor parking availability.
Willis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,127,8,3.0,9/14/2010,"Not saying this place is bad, but I've never liked going to BJ's.  I've been to this located 5 times.  I've ordered, their fish n' chips, buffalo chicken pizza, a burger, a pizza and pasta shared, and another pizza. Overall their choice really isn't that much, there's just nothing special about it.  The pizza I guess is t heir special point.  Maybe cuz I've eaten at better deep dish pizza, so BJ is only decent.  Overall their pizza is good, but nothing I would crave for, there's a lot better out there.  It's a bit overpriced imo for all their food. I would come here for group outings, otherwise I wouldn't ever choose to come here."
Brandon A.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,198,133,3.0,10/7/2009,"#104 I always seem to end up at BJ's when I'm home in LA and out with a particular group of friends. Why? I guess it's a neutral choice with the multitude of menu items, and it's also in the neighborhood ... and, they serve that delicious chocolate chip pazookie. Recently, I had the chance to try one of their new pizza menu items - the Southwestern: chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro. It tasted much better than what I was expecting - sort of like a spicy supreme pizza with chicken and no olives. I haven't tried any of their brews yet because I usually order their root beer. IIRC, it's made by them also. I'd suggest trying it if you're a root beer fan. The aforementioned pazookie is awesome. Each spoonful of warm chocolate chip cookie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top = yum. I have noticed that service tends to be slow here. On this visit, I only remember our server coming to our table three times during the entire meal - once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and once to deliver our check. I guess that leaves something to be desired. But then again, most of the servers are college students running their hustle. On average, it's probably one of the most popular restaurants in Westwood so plan ahead if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday evening."
Cynthia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,91,6,3.0,12/10/2010,"I ate here as part of a large group on a Thursday night.  We were seated in the upstairs area, and despite the semi-private location the restaurant's loud volume was still very obvious.  We started with shared appetizers, namely, the ""Best Beginnings"" plate of spinach-and-artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, and ""Santa Fe spring rolls,"" of which I tried and enjoyed the avocado egg rolls most.  The table also had a few pitchers of berry-flavored cider and pale ale, enabling my first taste of cider.  I had the pulled pork sandwich (served with coleslaw and thick-cut fries).  Not amazing, but tasty.  Half of the table decided to share some deep-dish pizzas, including the cheeseburger pizza which, not surprisingly, they said tasted like a cheeseburger on top of pizza. For dessert, we shared giant pizookies, which are huge cookies baked in pizza pans and served with ice cream on top.  Ours had four cookie flavors - chocolate, chocolate chip, peanut butter, and white chocolate macadamia nut.  Straightforward and satisfying, though definitely something I could easily make at home."
Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,4.0,5/28/2010,"Best pizza in Westwood. The rest of the food is not bad, but there's no reason to try it. Just go with any pizza. They also have their own microbrews. For dessert, the pizookie is great. Though I usually skip it in favor of a certain place across the street..."
Yiwen S.,"Evanston, IL",590,483,1344,3.0,5/27/2010,"pizookie!!!! the restaurant food itself is pretty average, but this dessert alone warrants 3 stars. and since west la is warm 80% of the year, ice cream + cookie crust always makes for a great and refreshing treat. the only thing that prevents me from giving the pizookies 4 stars is the fact that diddy reese is right across the street and has ice cream cookie sandwiches for much cheaper. bj's is really great for hosting large parties. been here for a few birthdays and celebratory dinners. get the deep dish pizzas and the large pizookie because they're super sized and easy to share among 10+ people. they have an extensive collection of beers if you're into that."
Evan S.,"Northridge, CA",51,55,,4.0,10/22/2010,"Very good Chicago-style pizza, and also very good microbrewed beer. I love this place mainly because it is the only place in Southern California where I can find a decent Chicago-style pizza. There used to be four places down here, but they have all closed, and as far as I know, BJ's is now the only place in the southland with a true Chicago pizza. The beer here is also pretty damned good and at a decent price. Beer and pizza were made to go together like peanut butter and chocolate, so...works for me. I'm not normally a big drinker, but the beer is just too good here to pass up. The appetizers are excellent - I've tried several on my visits, and every one was delicious. I have only been to the BJ's in Westwood, though there are others. The atmosphere here is open, fairly loud, and lots of people (lots of college students from UCLA)."
Rachel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,175,4,3.0,1/8/2012,"Food is always good here, service is fast and friendly. Wish the restaurant was a little bigger but what do you expect in Westwood. Will be back when I'm craving the avocado rolls :)"
Liz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,187,12,4.0,5/24/2011,"I've lived in Westwood for almost 3 years and just went to BJ's for the first time and let me say that it was long overdue. I'm always interested in places that are open later because I usually get off work late. BJ's is a great option instead of Bossa Nova or whatever other late night spots there are. Definitely save room for a Pizookie, they are DELICIOUS. Ordering an appetizer was the best bet in my opinion, the burgers and pizzas and entrees are HUGE. My friends burger came served on texas style garlic toast, so good but sooooo bad! Not a gourmet restaurant by any stretch of the imagination but a great late night option on this side of town."
Farnaaz T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,,5.0,11/11/2010,Love it Love it Love it...It has GLUTEN FREE PIZZA.  The service is Great..they know about gluten contamination. They are helpful. The restaurant is cozy and the food taste great and it is well worth the money. Like I said LOVE IT!  IT  HAS GLUTEN FREE PIZZA AND IT IS YUMMMMYY!!!!
Jenny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,112,9,2.0,12/2/2009,"My first experience at BJ's could have easily been my last. We had ordered a ""mini"" pizza and was served a medium instead. I remember looking at it and thinking, ""Damn... That's a pretty nice sized 'mini' pizza."" But didn't think much of it then. It wasn't till we received the check that we realized they had charged us for a medium. We called over our waitress (who, btw, spent all her time gossiping and bitching to another waitress instead of taking care of her tables) and asked her if what we were eating was a ""mini"" sized pizza. She gave us one of those ""Are you kidding me?"" condescending looks, and replied ""You ordered a medium."" After politely explaining that we had wanted only a mini because we had ordered 2 other dishes as well, she called her manager over. He strutted over and scoffed at our concern, obviously thinking that we were trying to pull some trick to get some free food. He sneered at us, emphasizing that the sizes were on the menu and that it was ridiculous that we would think that their medium pizza was a mini. I explained that I had never been to that restaurant before and wasn't familiar with the sizes, and assumed that the waitress had given us the size we had asked for to begin with. AND that the sizes were not on the menu. And if I'm mistaken and they were, they may not have been in a place noticeable enough. Anyway, point being.... The service was awful and the manager a complete jerk. He eventually gave us the pizza for the price of the mini - But made it a point to scoff in our faces about it. The food wasn't bad. In fact, I'd give it a 3.5 star rating if it wasn't for the unpleasant experience cause by the management. No matter who's right or wrong in the situation, nobody managing a business should handle any situation in such an immature and disrespectful manner. Anyway, check it out if you're in the area and are in dire need of some pizza. The nachos aren't worth the price. You can get better at Barney's Beanery.  The calamari's not crispy and just not tasty at all... But the pizzas are decent for bar food."
Paula C.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",76,5,,1.0,8/13/2014,"The waitress Brian was so rude. He was nice at first when we arrived but I got there on my 1 hr. Lunch and asked how long it was going to take. He said 10 mins. If I would've known that in reality it was going to take 25 mins. I would've simply walked out and just gotten subway instead but anyway, I got frustrated because not only did the food arrive late, I didn't get to eat any of it, or any food anymore until I got home! I was frustrated at this point, so I left the restaurant as soon as the food arrived. I was in such a hurry to get out of there that I didn't notice I didn't tip the rude waitress, I only noticed when he opened the guest presenter to check if there was any tip as soon as I had handed the check. After he noticed I hadn't tipped him, he started making faced at me! I can't even believe that such a thing existed! Who would expect for them to get attitude problems from a waitress at a restaurant after they messed the whole day for you! Anyway, NEVER going back there EVER again!!! Definitely do not recommend this restaurant (or Brian) unless you don't care about the waitress making faces at you and treating you rudely, specially if you're on your break and want to stop by for a burger!"
Geoff L.,"San Francisco, CA",188,186,626,3.0,7/1/2008,"The pizza is quite good, but not the best. The pizookie is a really tasty dessert that everyone loves. The appetizers are good. Everything is a little overpriced. It's oftentimes loud, so it's not a great venue for an intimate dinner by any means, but I've gone to a couple birthday dinners there and it's been great. The thing I like most about BJ's is the beer sampler. For $8.50, you get to taste 7 different beers ranging from light to dark. I have a decent tolerance, but I'm always beyond tipsy by the time I finish. BJ's is a great place to go to dinner with friends before heading out to all two of the bars in Westwood, but besides that, they churn out the same pretty-good-but-not-great product for a little more than it's worth. ""A-OK"" as the 3-star rating says."
