Karrie H.,"Playa del Rey, CA",19,51,2,1.0,9/2/2009,"I've been to 3-4 different BJ's locations (West Covina and Irvine among them) and never had a problem, so I was excited to come visit my local BJs in Westwood Village. I saw that the Yelp reviews were pretty lackluster, but I chalked it up to people not liking chain restaurants and went anyway. Unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment and I won't be coming here again. I know their food is supposed to be better than this! The biggest issue was the very ""meh"" food. Two of the pasta dishes ordered in our group were completely flavorless and dry. Mine in particular - the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta - was supposed to have a creamy Chardonnay wine sauce. There WAS sauce in my pasta, but it was surrounded by a huge ring of sauceless pasta. Even when I tossed it all together, the pasta was just barely wet with very bland sauce. The strawberry lemonade was also overpoweringly sweet. I love my sweet drinks and especially strawberry lemonade (I will down the stuff at Red Robin!) but this was terrible. I made it through halfway before asking for an extra cup of ice to water it down with. I ended up pouring ALL of the extra ice in to dilute half a cup of lemonade, and even then it was too strong. We also ordered three pizookies for the table and one of them came out with a minimal amount of ice cream, most of which was melted all over the cookie (which means it must have been standing around longer than the rest, which had more ice cream and were not as melted). They also brought out the wrong drink and the wrong food order, although they immediately rectified it as soon as we pointed it out to them. Not a big deal, but it just added up to a lot of bad things. Nitpicky things aside, it was the ridiculously bland pasta that ensures me that I will never return to this BJ's again. I will give other locations a try before I give up on this chain entirely though - I still have hope! Pros- Call ahead seating means we were seated immediately at 7:00pm on a weekday evening, exciting menu, $5 parking lot across the street since Westwood parking is a nightmare Cons- Flavorless/bland pasta, strawberry lemonade too sweet"
Derek P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,,1.0,9/16/2012,"This place is the worst restaurant I've ever been to in LA.  The beer is mediocre, the pizza is absolutely miserable and the service is even worse.  If you think this is good Chicago style (deep dish) pizza, you are sadly mistaken.  Give yourself a hug from me because I feel a great deal of pity for you.  I will not be returning"
Loran H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",6,95,14,2.0,10/29/2009,"I really don't get why some people love this place... I'm assuming it's because they haven't branched out and tried other non-chain restaurants who serve the same type of food, but better.  There is nothing particularly remarking about the menu, other than that it's big.  Some of the pizzas are alright, but they tend to be greasy.  Went here last night with some friends from college who were ""in the mood for BJ's"", whatever that means.   Allow me to say something about the beer.  It's just OK.  Sure, it's better than bud light, but I think the main reason that people like BJ's beer, is because for most people it's the only place that they try styles other than your awful bottom-fermenting-bullsh*t lagers of American megabreweries.  PEOPLE!  Please stop by BevMo or Beverage Warehouse and pick up real, good craft brews that are exemplary of their styles, this beer is much better.  Or check out Father's Office, the Daily Pint, Library Alehouse, just go to some beer bar that has a decent list.  If you think you like beer, but don't know much about it, go look for a place that has a bunch of beers you've never heard of, those are the good ones! Whew, ok, I'm done ranting about beer.  Just know, there are much better restaurants of this style out there for roughly the same price."
Meredith D.,"Larchmont, NY",32,68,,4.0,8/23/2009,"I'm a fan of any restaurant that can take all my loves of bad for you food like hamburgers, pizzas and decadent desserts and combine them in one large menu. BJ's of course is that place with tons of things to order and a different take on each. With a full drink menu, including quite an impressive list of wines given that BJ's is kind of like an Applebee's or Cheesecake factory (aka. Chains), a concoction of liquor filled drinks and of course beers (to compliment the sports playing on the flat screen TVs) you'll never go thirsty here. Add to this their extensive menu of pages upon pages of different appetizers, salads, soups, pizza's and of course hamburgers. Their pizzas are classic Chicago deep dish style and while I'm not sure I can speak with any authority on classic Chicago deep dish pizzas I found these to be rich and yummy. The crust and dough almost melted in my mouth along with the cheese (which was a little too salty for my taste and where they lost that desired last star) and tomato sauce. Their wedge french fries are large, in charge and perfectly seasoned to make you want to keep eating even when your stomach may scream to stop. And speaking of stomach's talking, yours should most certainly ask for the pizookie dessert, a trademark of the BJ's franchise. With a huge recently cooked cookie (of the chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, oreo or peanut butter variety--your choice) ice cream and flavorful adds on on the very top you'll be in sweet heaven, literally. So save room because this dessert is huge, meant to be shared but definitely fulfilling after only a few bites. Go with friends after a night out, as they stay open late and enjoy what drunk eating or merely late munchies can be satisfied here."
raheela k.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,93,10,4.0,8/4/2010,"I know there's a stigma surrounding chain restaurants such as BJ's. But i've gotta say - I like this place. Sometimes you just want to go to a place that has good beer (though I don't drink beer - but the pear and berry ciders are good.) Plus, it gives you the sports bar atmosphere and good food. The pizzas are solid. Not the best - but solid. The chicken wings are amazing. I love that they're not smothered in the sauce. And sometimes all you want are some good chicken wings. Plus the service at this particular BJ's is great. I know it's Westwood and parking blah blah - just go early and use the free lot."
Ariel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,14,7,1.0,8/19/2011,I'm sorry. This restaurant totally disappointed with the service. If I could give it negative 3 stars I would. I went with a group and it was a fail. We had to ask for water at least 9 times 7 of which went ignored. Our pizookies were confused and some orders weren't taken. Overall a fail. If you can avoid this BJ's please do.
Carol S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",4996,730,2,4.0,2/26/2010,"I always get the same things: bruschetta, lettuce wraps, cobb salad, grilled chicken pasta, great white pizza, pizookie (not all at once).  I also love their handcrafted beers.  Good spot to watch the game."
Trish C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,90,47,1.0,5/5/2012,"A ROACH FELL IN MY DAD'S FOOD! GROSS!!! But, I do like other BJ's Restaurant chains, but this one is poorly managed and dirty."
Mike M.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,16,6,4.0,6/29/2012,Quality food on a consistent basis for fair prices. I am a regular here for a reason.
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,35,11,3.0,9/21/2010,"One can't really go wrong by going to this restaurant. Its an overall good place to spend time with friends, drink some beer, and eat pizza. During my visit, I ordered a classic and mediterranean pizza. Food: The pizza itself was pretty good, but I don't feel that it was exceptional in taste. The restaurant seemed to try too hard with the mediterranean pizza, piling on tons of toppings.  Price: The price is a little more on the expensive side. I was not entirely satisfied with the price-pizza size ratio. In comparison to other pizza joints, BJs is very pricey...Although one can easily write it off to the fact BJs is a ""gourmet pizza shop.""  Environment: This joint is extremely well created, having a sports bar feel. It is great to have a classy get together with friends or perhaps even a date. Service was excellent with our waiter coming in to see if everything was well and if our cups needed to be refilled. Overall, a good restaurant."
Matthew P.,"Manhattan, NY",69,47,16,4.0,2/13/2009,"I don't consider myself a restaurant snob, and I am certainly no foodie, but for some reason I was hell bent on avoiding this place.   I was picturing a glorified TGI Fridays or Garfields (aw, remember Garfields?), filled with undergrads whose proximity to the place made it seem more appealing than it actually was.   I think the main reason for my apprehension was that I remember the restaurant/bars  in my college town and the excitement of Being-An-Adult-at-a-Restaurant-Unaccompanied.  That was fun at 18, but it's a high that wears off pretty fast.  Which is to say, the fun of ""yay, no parents!"" has turned into ""shouldn't someone be looking after those kids?""  Turns out, BJs is pretty much exactly what I expected, crowd-wise, but it was still kind of awesome.   They've got an extensive beer menu, not too expensive.  Not a lot of vegan options, but first of all: - what self respecting vegan would allow themselves to be dragged here, anyway? and second of all,  - the greasy-delicious seasoned fries were plenty serviceable at taking the edge off a couple especially flavorful pints of stout on an empty stomach. The waitress was sweet and pretty and friendly (and I am a sucker for good service.) Actually, every customer at every table almost without exception was fresh-faced and wholesome-hot.  It was like a sports bar in Desperate Housewives.  Thanks, Los Angeles!! I'm not sure I'd go back -- I'm just not really a beer and fries kind of guy, and Native Foods is right around the corner -- but I will happily admit that, while my impression of this place was pretty much dead-on -- it's a sports bar with a lot of undergrads -- I was wrong about it.  It made for a fun evening."
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,3.0,9/15/2007,"This place saved me from starvation so many times with their delivery pizza. It's a BJ's like any other so I don't know how useful this review is going to be for you. I'll give it a shot anyway.  Food: The pizzas are expensive but utterly satisfying. The BBQ is an obvious choice, especially with all those carmelized onions on top. There's also an alfredo pizza. I think I'm the only person I know who actually likes this, but if you are a fan of alfredo or white sauce, this is an interesting variation. As for the pasta, I'd recommend the cajun and the grilled chicken for the less adventurous. Same goes for the sandwiches. Just order anything BBQ or cajun and you'll be golden. Dessert? Pizookie of course! Atmosphere: Not as loud as other BJs I've been to. There's a small seating area upstairs which is a nice place to study if you're lucky enough to be escorted there.  Service: They'll often tell you there's a wait like they're trying to make it seem busier than it actually is. I've really never had to wait to get in here though.  Synopsis: It's greasy food and kind of overpriced, but at least what you're getting is delicious and filling."
Johnson N.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,377,258,4.0,1/13/2010,"Ahhh yes... the memories.  There's nothing like hanging out with an old friend at an old spot where good beer flows so freely.   Current Promo: $3.95 for 12oz house beer I got a Blonde and my friend got their Hef.  Both are quite good (I've had both before).  Upon tasting it for the first time after a year or two, it was... music to my... lips?  Deeeeelish!  Loooove the Blondes there...  The service was very good too.  She tended to our needs very frequently, checking up on us, making sure we were good.  I definitely appreciated the quality experience.   Oh... and I miss Westwood!  Go Bruins!  hehe"
Sam P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2013,The service I got from the waitress was great. My food on the other hand was not. I waited over 30 minutes for my Spicy Jalapeño Burger with no onions.  When I received my burger t had extra onion. I had it replaced where they gave me a burger with no seasoning. Very disappointed.
Lauren R.,"San Antonio, TX",38,118,10,2.0,3/11/2011,"Upon walking in the door I was accosted by the smell of rotting milk. Seriously, I don't know what made it smell so bad in there. Even the s*it smells in the bathroom were a relief compared to the way the dining area reeked. It was so bad it pretty much ruined my dinner, either that or it was my realization that my entree was 1000+ calories. Yuck."
Yihan N.,"Rancho Park, Los Angeles, CA",19,104,175,4.0,2/1/2014,"pretty good , I love that BBQ chicken soooooo much！and cheese mushroom is juicy as yummy . But the free water tastes weird ..."
Megan S.,"Santa Monica, CA",61,286,,3.0,2/27/2009,"Oh lordy.  My grad school program takes people here for recruiting, so every September thru March, I eat here once a month.  It's a great place to go with a big group, with decent service and a good selection of food and beer.  After eating here literally dozens of times, here's a rundown: 1. Full meal must include (no more and no less) appetizers, pizza, and beer.  And Pizookie for dessert.  Don't waste your stomach space with salads or pastas or random salmon entrees--the pizza here is so massive you need to save room! 2. Order avocado eggrolls.  They are amazing: fried, and avocado--the best things in life.  3. In fact, you should get at least 2 orders of avocado eggrolls.  They really are good. 4. Best pizza flavors: Barbecue chicken and BJ's favorite.  Worst flavors: Buffalo chicken and Mediterranean (the toppings feel too ""light"" for the pizza). 5. Best pizookie flavor: OREO.  If you like cookies and cream ice cream, you will never want to eat anything else. 6. The beers are pretty much all good.  A handy beer sampler is available on the menu! 7. Ok fine, you wanted a salad? The BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent. I've always been in groups of 20+, and the wait staff has generally been great with getting our orders right, bringing drinks, and changing the TV channels so we can watch our favorite sports teams.  The food is ridiculously heavy and greasy, so eating here will definitely be a caloric splurge.  The pizza claims to be Chicago style, but it's more like a generic deep dish, with generous toppings, not too much sauce, and a nice chewy crust that's crispy around the edges.  I might have given this place 4 stars, except that I always feel slightly ill after eating here (probably because I have no self control)."
Ryan B.,"Calabasas, CA",29,21,,4.0,9/6/2012,If anyone come to california we take them here..... only for the pizookies!!! The whole place has a very classy sports bar/ restaurant atmosphere! there is so much to choose from on the menu its like a book!!! The food is average. can never go wrong going here for dinner!! but when dessert comes around make sure to order the pizookie!!! (Chocolate Chip) Yum!! Service has never been terrible. i've had really great service one night and average the next.Its a gamble like most places!!
Sam M.,"Singapore, Singapore",17,127,42,3.0,12/25/2009,"Came here a while back when I was visiting a friend at UCLA. BJ's has the standard and hearty fare that a hungry tummy craves but don't come with a tummy that's TOO hungry because there is always a line here. But you can walk around while you wait because they give you one of those buzzer things that buzz when your table's ready. I had the BBQ beef sandwich while my friend had a stuffed potato. I really like the potato wedges here and that was probably my favorite part of the meal. The BBQ was full of BBQ sauce but in the end, it was just alright. My friend's stuffed potato looked amazing but then once you start eating, all the stuffing is at the top, and once you've eaten the cheesey topping on the top, what's left is a baked potato that hasn't got much else to it. For sweets, we got a pizookie that was half chocolate chip, half peanut butter. Warm with melty vanilla ice cream. Mmm! Food we had was a bit ""ehh"" but the pizookie is always yummy. Definitely sticking to the pizzas next time."
Sara P.,"West Los Angeles, CA",28,288,,3.0,12/24/2009,"Solid three stars.  They have big, comfy booths, a good selection of beers and microbrews. it's great for big groups. i think the most delicious items on the menu are the deep dish pizzas. the medium is enough for 3 grown men to share. their salads are also good, too. things that haven't been so good - sandwiches (burned chicken breast, etc), soups (taste like canned) and fries (not my favorite).  there can be a wait on the weekends and on friday nights. ps: free mini pizookie on your birthday!!!!"
