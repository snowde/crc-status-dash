Peter L.,"East Lansing, MI",24,59,11,3.0,12/19/2009,"This place is good if you're in the mood for some deep dish pizza.  I've been here a couple times (mostly with large groups) and the pizzas are pretty consistent...the crusts are thick and chewy and they have a good amount of toppings.  They also serve a lot of other dishes, such as burgers, pastas, sandwiches, etc., but I've never tried them.  I probably would stick with the pizza though... Pizza recommendations: BBQ chicken, Sweet Pig and BJ's Favorite"
Ema S.,"Culver City, CA",144,166,52,2.0,10/20/2008,"small, slow service, and too many people.  I have never been a huge fan of BJ's but this one is the worst one i have been to. NO BAR! they usually have a bar you can hang out at while you wait for your drinks. Yup not at this one. The food isn't great either. The pizza is ok...but nothing i cant get at Von's and cook it myself."
Nicole B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,35,,4.0,5/27/2012,"Not thrilled with the parking, but it's great otherwise. The food is always delicious, the staff is always nice, and the fact that you can get a table pretty quickly is fantastic. Overall 4 stars."
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,1.0,4/20/2009,This is the smallest BJ's I have been too and it was so jam packed like sardines in a can I couldn't tell and wouldn't believe this place had a bar like the other BJ's I have gone too. Would I return? Nope Sorry this place is a no go in Westwood
Marie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,96,31,3.0,1/16/2012,"This BJs is definitely a go-to eat-out place for UCLA students in Westwood.  That being said, the wait can be a little long at times.  They don't take reservations unless you have at least 8 people in your party.  Overall, the food's okay and the service is good.   I don't really like their pizzas too much, but they have a ton of other options on the menu!  Their appetizers are all really good, but my favs are the spinach & artichoke dip, thai shrimp lettuce wraps (a little spicy - yummy!), and avocado egg rolls.  I also like their gourmet mac & cheese and chicken teriyaki dishes."
Steve F.,"Worcester, MA",2,20,8,4.0,5/17/2012,"Grear beer bar. The local beer is definatly some of the best in the area. For sports, get a table up by the bar. The cente screen is viewable feom every seat. The food is standrad pub fair with one exception, the personal pan pizza is awesome."
Natalie D.,"Carmichael, CA",0,27,5,4.0,5/16/2012,Get the calamari and the boneless chicken wings. Seems like a bad combination but it was HEAVENLY!
Eric F.,"San Francisco, CA",145,48,1,4.0,11/30/2009,"Visiting UCLA friends for me often involves a trip to BJ's.  Very well... The beer is serious business.  The menu even recommends you a beer to go with whatever dish you're having.  The night's decision: Porter + California Burger. The burger is serious business.  Pretty sure the beer gave my taste buds a nice warmup for the burger, but whatever happened, I'm not complaining.  It had the consistency of a melt rather, but all the flavors came together very nicely.  I.  Wanted. Seconds. The pizookie is serious business.  But it's also really just a giant fatty cookie with ice cream.  Indulge once if you'd like.  It's lovely.  But if you're feeling cheap, you're not missing much if you head across the street to Diddy Reise."
Partha K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,12,,1.0,5/13/2012,Had a business lunch here. Service was beyond pathetic and they weren't running at full capacity. It looked like they couldn't care less. Our drinks were not refilled even once and took ages to bring a simple house salad. This restaurant has no place being in a prime Westwood spot.
Tina M.,"Irvine, CA",125,505,26,2.0,3/25/2009,"Overrated. Pizookie's are good but I can't help but feel the ""I can make this at home"" thing. Everything else here is ""meh."" I may be biased though as I'm not a huge fan of that whole American/family food thing (Burgers, Pizza, etc)... though I like burgers... just not like this... Have not tried the beer (last time I went was before I was 21) but next time I will. Buffalo wings, if I can recall correctly, were pretty good."
esther n.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,136,6,1.0,4/4/2009,"Thought this would be a decent enough place to eat at after watching a long boring movie. The wait wasn't bad for a Friday night. Then, fter we'd been seated, one of the servers tripped and spilled a container of red sauce, which splattered all over the table, my hair, my jacket, and my dinner companions. They brought over the manager, who offered to dry-clean my hoodie (which I declined, because, um, it's a hoodie). She then offered to comp the drinks we'd ordered, and we were okay with that. Too bad they forgot to do even that in the end. To top it off, the pizza we ordered took forever to arrive. Also, they gave us napkins for us to wipe the table with, but didn't really check to make sure all the damage had been cleaned up. When the 4th member of our dinner party arrived, he sat in the empty chair, and it was only when we got up to leave that he realized he'd gotten red sauce all over his wool sweater. We asked for the manager and she offered to pay for HIS dry cleaning. I hope he remembers to let them reimburse him.  Thanks for letting me vent! Needless to say, going to this BJ's is a mistake I won't be making again."
Anna S.,"San Jose, CA",174,362,164,3.0,8/29/2009,"The service at this BJ's beats the BJ's I eat at back home in Cupertino. The waiter was attentive and the food was pretty good. My dinner date and I tried the California Club flatbread which turned out great. They forgot the applewood smoked bacon though...so they gave us a bowl of the bacon bits. =[ I was hoping they would take it back and bake it again with the bacon, but thought that was asking for too much considering we ate 1/4 of it already when we finally realized the missing bacon. I ordered the fish tacos which were bland, but great with the given sauces. It was a light entree because I didn't feel like eating something heavy. The date ordered a burger which was decent. We finished off with a pizookie, cookies and cream style. Never disappoints."
Carlos R.,"North Hollywood, CA",74,335,35,3.0,12/25/2010,"i didn't like the bj's but that doesn't take away from the good service and quality of food. both which were satisfactory.  i just don't like the set up of the place, it's awkward all around and the parking situation sucks. great from people working off campus and students cause they could just walk on over.  i missed out on that holiday ale =/"
Karina G.,"San Jose, CA",161,289,26,2.0,7/16/2009,"I used to love eating here - but after spending one summer working on campus with a bunch of people who wanted to eat here 4x's a week - let's say it gets old fast. 5 years after that summer and I still haven't gotten over my aversion for BJ's pizza. The only reason I'll come inside is for a pizookie and even that only happens once a year. EDIT:: Wait, I still come here for beer."
Rani N.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,15,,4.0,3/2/2012,"This was actually my first visit to BJ's. Not sure why. It always struck me as the typical American restaurant, which serves everything from pasta and pizza to tacos and burgers. A way better version of Friday's, Chili's.... Typically, you can find a thing or two you'd like on their menus, and once you do, you stick to it because you know everything else is not going to be as good.   I went there for a late lunch and it wasn't very crowded. In the past, i had stayed away because of the long wait. I ended up having the California Chicken sandwich with crispy thin fries and BJ's Jeremiah Red beer. The  sandwich was good, but it was mostly the avocado and chipotle mayo that did the trick, not the chicken itself. The beer was the standout for me, so I'm glad I tried it. I think I would go there again in the future, probably to catch a basketball game and to try their pizzas."
Nam L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,73,,3.0,2/15/2010,"Man the wait for this place is horrible!  That's why they have delivery! As a UCLA student, BJ's is on the list of places to eat at westwood before you graduate.  Just remember to be prepared for a WAIT.  An EPIC wait! The pizza is fine, though in a previous visit to BJ's my pizza was burnt.  The steak is alright and the drinks are fine."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, CA",3007,3154,4803,3.0,8/31/2010,"familiar bj's chain restaurant...just a smaller location...bruins school is out!...a fifteen-minute hike down from temporary home in birch in de neve plaza, ucla...crowded, but seated quickly...noise levels higher...a pitcher of beer first....nice large pitchers...an order of flatbread sausage pizza and another forgettable appetizer...just small bites to save room for beer!...bj's perfect for beers and standard pizza...two appetizers and two large pitchers total $sixty-nine...perfect de-stresser!"
Xuan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,250,229,3.0,8/22/2009,"I came here one night because I didn't know where else to go.  To be honest, nothing else looked good so I thought I'd give this place a shot.  I ordered the one of their stuffed potatoes, a cider, and a white chocolate chip and macademia nut pazookie. The potato wasn't the most awesome thing on earth.  Which is sad thing, I think.  It had all the elements necessary for fantastic salty engorgement: potato + cheeeeeeeese.  I kind of shrugged the whole thing off as.... a-ok.  Not godawful but it didn't seem like I was having a revelation either. The cider was great.  I really loved it.  It was smooth, fruity, and not too carbonated.  I'm not much of a beer person, so it was nice to have this alternative available to me. The pazookie is where it's at.  Hot, melty, gooey goodness in a tiny deep dish plate.  Now, to those who are not in the know... it would seem like the pazookie is large enough for sharing between 2 people.  So not true.  I swear you'll be dueling to the death with your spoons and forks for the last bite. So, I can understand the negativity when it comes to the food in general.  I would say don't come here for dinner.  This place is just right for an after-dinner drink and dessert."
Manuel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,4.0,5/11/2012,Being Italian I'm pretty picky about pizza. I tried the Chicago style here for the first time and I was pretty impressed. It reminds me of the very breaded pizza an aunt of mine does in Italy and it's a nice twist from the classical.
Kat L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",312,456,40,1.0,9/22/2008,"Okay I use to LOVE this place.  This was before BJ's started popping up everywhere.  I will still give them credit for the great pizookie... but I hate this location now. I had the most horrid service this one time.  While I had a break from classes, I popped over with a friend to catch lunch.  Okay, you all know that we don't have that much time between classes.  The service was great in the beginning and then our server left... and nothing.  I sat right in front of the cash register and no one helped us.  Eventually we got our bill and food packed.  I was in a hurry to get back onto campus for classes, but they just didn't care.  It wasn't like they were busy, they were just lazy! I kept trying to get someone to come take it but they were all nowhere to be found or taking a break.  Eventually I got up and stood at the cashier area/front desk and waited.  The manager rang me up.  I took a comment card filled it full of nasty comments and handed it straight to her. They of course eventually sent me a letter of apology and gift card... but it was too late... I don't like BJ's anymore and I am so over the fad.  My sister had to drag me back to use the gift card almost 4 years later."
