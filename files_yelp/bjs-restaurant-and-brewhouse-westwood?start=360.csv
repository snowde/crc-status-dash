Sienna K.,"Philadelphia, PA",105,153,21,4.0,5/31/2008,"Me: Hi. Can you seat us somewhere with the view of the upcoming Lakers game?  Hostess: Oh, don't worry. If I have any say in this, every television will be turned onto the Lakers game. Come on now, it's the LAKERS.  ...It's so good to be home.  *** My friends and I were visiting a friend of ours at UCLA, and we chose here so we could 1) be in Westwood 2) eat something other than greasy bar food 3) watch the Game 4 of the Western Conference Championships.  And while I wouldn't eat here if it weren't for the exact combination of the three reasons listed above, I have to admit that eating here wasn't as painful as I'd imagined, and actually did enjoy my time here.  I mean, it's a BJ's-- it's like the TGIFs of pizzas with a funnier name.   You've probably already been to a BJ's and don't need my words telling you how the pizza tastes (satisfyingly mediocre; insulting if you're a pizza purist, damn good if you're pizza ignorant, and simply edible if you're somewhere in between). The salads and pastas tastes exactly like every other salad/pasta at every other chain restaurant.  The only thing really note-worthy about the chain is that they have their signature beers, which aren't so bad considering the prices. As someone who ordered the Piranha (hoppy American pale ale), there are better and worse beers out there, but it's at least worth a drink. But do skip out on the ciders, unless you enjoy ciders that taste like Smirnoff Ice.  Anyways, here are the Westwood location specific notes:  -No bar (though they still serve alcohol) -Mixed drinks (hey, my friend ordered it, not me!) named after UCLA and USC (Seriously, is this what the great SoCal rivalry has turned into? The Bruin-ita versus the Trojan-tini?) -A much younger crowd (Duh. Right around campus) -Super awesome staff that was patient with us even though we finished our food by the first quarter -Kinda disgusting bathrooms with no toilet paper  So... it's like a 3 star place, but the one extra star is because the Lakers won the game and are going to the Finals. But seriously, as someone who is more used to getting snide comments whenever she shouts ""MVP"" during a Lakers game, I really loved the fact that every TV was turned onto the game, so many people were decked out in yellow and purple, and that even the waiters would stop and stare whenever Kobe made his beautiful fade aways. It makes me sad that I won't be in LA for the Finals... though... I am sort of excited at the prospects of trash talking with the Boston folks in New York. Bring it on, Massholes. Bring it on."
Sarah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,494,23,2.0,6/17/2009,"I've never been to another BJ's but I've done it all here... takeout, small tables, and a party.  The party was most disappointing.  There were about 20 of us, we all had to pay $15 to cover the food and renting the upstairs, and I only managed to get a single slice of pizza and a bit of salad.  Maybe we had too many guys eating more than their share, I dunno.  But no one was satisfied.  That brings me to my next complaint, it's too expensive for what you get.  Pizzas are small, food is just ok.  As someone else said, you can make the Pizookie at home.   BJ's is just okay.  Everyone can find something they like on the menu, which is why it's always packed.  My only real reason to go is if we have a picky eater who won't agree to any other place in the Village.  Even Chili's is more worthwhile and less crowded."
Omo O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,43,,1.0,10/9/2013,"NOT COMING BACK!!! The food is not that great anymore. I agree with the others, its going no where but down the hill..."
Daniel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,82,,3.0,2/14/2011,"I just got a Yelp account and I couldn't believe that this place only had three stars. This is my favorite place to eat. Period. Nothing else even comes close. I have been here over 50 times in my life, on occasions ranging from my birthday (three times), to dates with my girlfriend, to celebrate my college acceptance, and EVERY single time, I have been greeted with great food and exceptional service. Just for the sake of informing others, I will note a few of the more testing situations and how they were resolved.  Once, for my birthday, I came with a part of 10. We called ahead for a table and they said that it would be about one hour. We arrived in an hour, yet we still waited about 20 minutes to get seated. This was frustrating, yet understandable because we were a large party and the location is very small. Another time, my family and I placed our order and waited for about 20 minutes. The food arrived, but my pizza had not yet arrived. The MANAGER OF THE STORE then came out to tell me that they messed up with my pizza and that I would be getting it in 10 minutes (not a long wait..). Oh, and he gave it to us on the house! The line can be long, so call ahead! It is a great BJs location in a cute part of Los Angeles. My favorite 3-course meal here is the chicken wings, the Blackened Chicken Pizza, and the chocolate chip pizookie. It is very unhealthy, but SO good! Go to this BJs, and you won't regret it as long as you call ahead. EDIT: Sadly, I have decided to drop two stars from my rating, because, over the previous year, this BJ's has deteriorated into a place that I can no longer recognize. First off, they redid the interior so that there are now only two lengthy booths - the others only seat four people comfortably.  Secondly, they changed the recipe of the pizza, so that the tasteless, bland, crust now takes up LITERALLY half of the slice. What used to be my favorite pizza is now one of my absolutely least favorite. Please, BJ's, change the recipe back. This new one is AWFUL compared to the old one.  The previous three visits have been so poor (every time) that I am likely not going to return for some time. It's a shame, but I cannot eat that new disgrace of a pizza."
Kim l.,"Santa Clara, CA",595,1236,897,3.0,2/28/2009,"Step sis had her bday party at BJs last night. There were about 22 guest and they had the food set up buffet style. It was all you can drink sodas, all you can eat salad and all you can eat pizza(choice of 4 different types of pizzas). Our sodas and salads were replenished at a decent rate, however they took a long time to bring out new pizzas, so we were sitting there for a while waiting...and the longer we waited the less hungry we got. Maybe that's their system, to make us wait a long time between the pizzas so that people eat less. The salad was ok, my soda was soda and I must say the pizza's were delicious. This is the order I would rate the pizzas, 1.Great white 2.buffalo chicken 3.bbq chicken 4.artichoke spinach. All in all the food was good, service was ok, and the price was very reasonable ($16.50 each including tax and tip)."
Sydnee S.,"Sacramento, CA",32,23,3,5.0,6/3/2011,"my roommates and i ordered pizza on two separate delivery orders in the same night, and BOTH times the delivery guy forgot our ranch dressing. i know this seems like an extremely minor detail, but i think we can all agree that ranch dressing is clutch for BJs pizza. We excused the first mistake, but after we realized the same delivery guy forgot our ranch dressing on not one, but TWO orders, in THE SAME night, we had to call back. So we called back. We spoke to the hostess and the manager about the situation. BOTH were super cool about the situation...especially the hostess ( i think her name is Michelle). They ended up sending the delivery guy back with 6 ramekins of ranch. Although this was a nice gesture from BJs management, when the delivery guy came back, he KICKED  our door and then basically threw the ranch ramekins in our faces without saying a word or making eye contact. It was extremely disrespectful. I wish I would have caught his name. So we called back...again. We spoke to the manager (John), again, and he was SO AWESOME. He was extremely apologetic and understanding about the entire situation, and even after I explained we wanted nothing out of it, he demanded we give him our address so he could send us a gift card to make up for it. The take-away: I am really impressed with the way the general management handled the situation. He totally turned the entire situation around. He is the ONLY reason I will ever give this BJs service ever again."
Susan V.,"Pasadena, CA",81,202,10,2.0,3/2/2009,"I was hungry and wanted my food right away. It ttok about an hour to get my food, so I was seriously raging! It wasnt busy in there at all. On top of it, the waiter made me feel bad about getting a refill on my refillable soups..it was only my second round -- geesh! Okay food, bad, slow service = bad review."
Ryan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,410,33,4.0,11/10/2008,"Thumbs Up! I vouch for the deep dish pepperoni pizza, pizookie party platters, and alliteration!"
sarah beth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",405,339,95,5.0,12/23/2007,pizzookie gets a five. (white choc macadmia nut). Fam was talking up this dish but thought how good can a cookie dessert in a chain restaurant be? I'm not sure I even wanted to know how right they were. Now the rest of my life is just time in between pizzookies.... UPDATE- 5 days later. Just realized the origins of the term pizzookie is pizza + cookie. Oh!
John C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,40,,2.0,8/15/2011,"I, being a pasta fan, tried the spaghetti. I ordered a large spaghetti with marinara sauce. The portion was big, but I handled it easily. I was highly disappointed with the noodles though. The noodles wasn't soft, I found them quite hard. The sauce was nothing special, just regular. The waiter was nice though, and kept on checking on us. I'm giving a two star just for service. I suggest that if your a marinara fan, try someplace else."
Allison L.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,174,1,4.0,1/26/2007,"Okay, BJs is a chain with a name that will make you giggle. They have really good, deep dish (don't giggle at that) pizzas and their pizooki is AMAZING. A big ol' warm cookie straight from the oven with ice cream on top? Simple, but brilliant idea. They are also big on the beer scene (hence the brewhouse in the name) and even do a beer sampler. Now it's story time: my brother and I came here for dinner a short time after he had turned 21. He was very excited to order booze, but sadly, our waitress didn't card him. I had convinced him to do the beer sampler under the guise that as a new ""legal drinker"", he would need to know his beer.  Like a champ, he downed those little shot glasses and was halfway through his sampler before our pizza had arrived. So let's not lie: the kid was drunk. And it was amazing. He started yelling (he thought he was talking at a normal volume), threw his credit card at our waitress when the bill came and nearly fell down the stairs as we were leaving (we were seated on the second floor). In his haste, he left his credit card (and unsigned bill) behind and our waitress had to literally chase him down the street. All-in-all, an amazing night with the brother. =)"
Christopher T.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,224,95,3.0,7/8/2008,"Great place to grab a burger, salad, or a pizza when in westwood out for a flick!  Its always slammed in the evenings on weekends as its seconds from UCLA. The service is usually pretty good. Expect to wait for a table. Come to think of it I don't think I have ever not waited at least 20 minutes for a table here.  Parking kind of sucks, typical westwood. Free lot (2 hrs free entering before 6 pm) is your best bet."
Patty F.,"Saratoga, CA",185,177,,3.0,6/15/2010,"omg how did i let myself get so behind on reviews!! aahhhh so came here for game 4 which is pretty depressing considering we dropped like 35 bucks to watch celtic's bench own the lakers but whatevs, can't blame that on bj's...also, the only reason we came is because barney's doesn't let in ppl under 21 AT 6PM cuz there's a game...LAMMMEEE ""cries""  the reviews here have kept me away from this place but necessity forced me in....""sigh"" the buffalo wings here are AMAZING! i'm a fried chicken sorta gal so i LOVE that the wings here are fried crispy and the sauce is served on the side so yay!!!! this was honestly one of the best wings i've had and saved the rating of this place. i'll be honest, we just had 2 orders of this haha. also got the chocolate chunk pizookie, which was kind of a let down. how do you screw up warm cookie and ice cream you say? with an undercooked cookie! i love gooey cookies but what i had still tasted like dough. bleh x.x and considering diddy riese is literally across the street and bj's is famous for them, it was just super disappointing. i will say though that i had excellent service. i almost wish i didn't cuz i felt guilty dragging my dinner out so long to watch the game but oh well =D bottom line: pretty overrated but the wings partially make up for it"
sara n.,"San Diego, CA",11,140,,4.0,4/7/2011,"We had a very nice server, and the food was delish. I had the angle hair pasta that was delicious, and we split the gooey cookie thing at the end that was awesome."
Sophia Y.,"Hoboken, NJ",5,2,,4.0,6/29/2011,"I've been here a few times now and it's always so delicious! Unfortunately everything's over 1000 calories so if you're going to BJ's... Plan to indulge!  As an east coaster at heart, I'm not a fan of their pizzas but their sandwiches are so amazing! Both pieces of the breads are drenched with butter and seasonings, and the sizes of these sandwiches are very big.  I recommend: - california club sandwich - classic burger - thin cut fries - party pizookie However, I don't recommend the turkey club sandwich. Very average-tasting... Also there are obviously a lot of people dressed in Bruin attire, so I go there wearing my Trojan gear with pride ;)"
Fran B.,"Lacey, WA",34,277,,2.0,6/28/2013,"small, food was awful, small deep dish with mushrooms, even I left it behind in the box, service was good, waitress nice, but thanks goodness I was not hungry. the other bj's in Torrance and culver city are great, this one........ only go if someone else is buying;"
Yulree C.,"Los Angeles, CA",548,278,38,3.0,5/17/2008,"I've tried BJ's deep dish pizza three times. 2 out of the 3, the pizza was perfect - hot, a combination of crunchy and soft, warm tomato sauce with various toppings. The other one time the pizza was a little too soft.  Rootbeer on tap is very yummy. Add icecream and you get dessert. :) As for the pizookie or brownie - they are both good, but I always find it way too sweet. Everything else I've tried was very mediocre, if not bad. Their appetizer platter was an unappetizing, reheated frozen platter. Their soups were very salty and tasted like it was from a can. Their pasta was okay. Very college bar vibe. Wait can be long. Good for groups, not dates."
G L.,"San Jose, CA",1,29,,4.0,3/19/2011,I love the pizzas at BJ and the rest of the food is pretty awesome as well. Prices are pretty reasonable. Try their beer sampler!
Diana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,186,19,2.0,4/21/2008,"Waited an hour and a half here for a stinkin' BJ's Burger which was very bland. The bread was dry and tasteless (so much for ""garlic bread"") and the beef wasn't anything to die for.. actually it just sucked. Not worth the wait. Also, the location was horrible and it was just way too small. Maybe they would get more costumers if they relocated to a bigger place, plus hire more waiters/waitresses AND new chefs. An extra star because our waiter actually TRIED to accommodate us with the other 10** tables he had to wait. **I was exaggerating."
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,4.0,11/17/2010,Just about everything on the menu is amazing. I always get the blackened chicken sandwich.  This is the 4th different B.J's I have been to and has the best service. All the others in the South Bay suck badly.
