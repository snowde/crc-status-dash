terra d.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,605,29,3.0,11/28/2009,"BJs is alright, but probably nothing i'd crave. try the pizza, though :)"
Niccolo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,57,8,2.0,11/11/2010,"Service is good, but the calamari tasted like rubber, and the bacon cheeseburger didn't have enough flavor."
David K.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,125,294,4.0,3/15/2006,"the one in westwood is a great hangout.  the servers have a great attitude and are very friendly which totally makes up for the mediocre food.  but, come on... do you really go to a brewery for food?  you go there for beer.  so... let's talk about beer.  my choices are hefeweizen and bj's blonde.  both are light and crisp... goes well with everything.  i'd stay away from the piranha unless you like a bitter after-taste to your beer. bj's famous pizza shouldn't be your first choice to accompany your beer, unless you like the really ""deep dish"" spongey taste.  instead, get the spinach dip. it's a popular choice in the westwood area so expect a line at night.  there's only one reason, why i give this place a four star instead of the three it deserves... ""PIZOOKIE""."
Jodi Triplett T.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,51,,3.0,1/18/2011,"It's crowded (like no more than one person can walk past a table at a time crowded), you always have to wait to get a table, there's only one bathroom per gender, and it's really, really loud.  But the beer samplers are great, the appetizer platters are first rate, and the pizza is outrageously good.  A once a year place to spend your caloric tab on good beer and bar food."
Julie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",616,428,42,2.0,9/20/2007,"Pathetic excuse for ""deep-dish"" pizza. It's more like chewy bread in a deep pan with crappy cheese haphazardly melted over it.  The only reason to give this place more than one star is that it's open until midnight during the week if you're in Westwood and absolutely starving and need food/beer. Plus, I've heard the pizooki is amazing, though I haven't tried it. And their chicken fingers are surprisingly crispy but not greasy. But stay away from the pizza. Better to get a frozen pizza and bake it, because this is crap."
Evan J.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",169,243,143,4.0,3/25/2007,"All hail the PIZOOKIE!  If you haven't tried one, you must make an effort to get over there and try it.  I'm also a big fan of the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  Beyond that, I would agree that this is a chain and feels like it.  The Westwood location is usually filled with the requisite UCLA crowd but the staff is nice and the food is consistently good.  CPK is certainly a better choice for most things, but the Pizookie is out of this world."
Perry K.,"Oakland, CA",77,166,2,4.0,10/26/2008,"I agree with some of the reviews; the wait is excruciating slow.  But gotta give it to the manager there, (I think it was him), he tried to alleviate it by bringing out some free pizza.  You can complain all day, but you know that the food there is great.  I guess what my point is that they are trying their best, give them some credit.  I never had to ask for napkins, utensils, or my water to be refilled; for how busy they are, give them some credit.  They have the best buffalo wings, I think.   I didn't realize how much more tastier they are if you don't dowse the wings entirely in buffalo sauce.  At BJ's they drizzle the sauce on and give you the rest on the side.  So if one  decides later to dowse their wings with sauce; they can do so.  Someone else actually wrote that they can duplicate BJ's pizza at a supermarket...I would like to see that."
Clare N.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,28,2,4.0,11/30/2010,"I LOVE their salmon!!!  I also love their tacos!!  and their blue bruin martini is pretty good!  This place is usually packed, kind of loud.  About 90% of the times I've gone, we've had to wait like 5 minutes to get seated which isn't bad at all. I would go here just go eat out."
Diana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,44,13,4.0,8/14/2007,"BJ's is not a fantastic restaurant, but it earns four stars for several reasons: 1. Everyone in my picky family can find something on the menu that he or she will enjoy (and that is really saying something). 2. They serve the best chicken wings I've found since moving to L.A. 3. They have big booths that can accommodate several people. 4. You can park in the lot on Broxton and walk there, eat, and return to your car in under two hours so parking is free. 5. I've never had the pizza or the pizookie, but apparently they are excellent. 6. I must reiterate -- the chicken wings rock."
Laura S.,"Westwood, CA",20,41,,3.0,9/7/2007,"Thumbs up for the food. (Their fries here are killer!) Lunch deal, salad and half a sandwich for under $10 was great.  I had so much food I could hardly move after lunch. Bad review for the service though.  Maybe our waitress was having a bad day and the host had a stick up his bum but last time I checked people should smile when they work in food service. We had to have waited almost 20 minutes to order anything.  Then we got to sit and watch our food wait for us on the line while the waitress played over by the computers talking to the other staff while they also let their food get cold. So this place is 50/50 if you can handle horrible service to get good food for a good price I really recommend you try this place out, but don't say I didn't warn you!"
phil p.,"Pasadena, CA",129,47,45,5.0,11/11/2008,"Two phrases sum this place up;  GOOD PIZZA AND GOOD BEER The environment is very brewery oriented and you get the feel of being in the backroom of some ale distillery (though sadly i've never been in the back of one). The pizza is very good, better than anything you could ever ever order and that's saying a lot (*thinking of papa johns). The beer menu is very well organized and the staff for the most part are familiar with the different kinds of offerings they have and can direct you if you are unfamiliar *get the heffeweizen and you'll be fine :) Good place for a bday dinner, vent session, or just hungry for beer and pizza with friends!"
Marc C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/1/2011,"A favorite for me and my family for Sunday afternoon dinners.  It's pretty busy most of the time, hard to get a table, but Sunday afternoon is the time to go.  The staff and manager always greets us with a smile and remembers us.  We never feel rushed to get out, the food is always delivered hot and in a decent time.  Can't go wrong. Definitely recommend the deep dish pizza and the piezookies.  And the beer."
Shelly M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,11,13,4.0,4/19/2008,"Long wait, but worth it if it's for a friend's bday.   I think they give out a free pizzookie for the b-day person.  Very nice of them.  It tasted so good. I like their BBQ chicken pizza.  YuMmm.  Other pizza toppings weren't great.  The next to best was the Hawaiian topping one.  =) Try to go when there's lesser crowd."
Anastasia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,22,,5.0,2/4/2011,One of my favorite restaurants! This is a great place for bigger groups. I like my order so much that I get the same thing every time I go: BBQ Chicken Deep Dish Pizza and a Pizookie for dessert. The cookie is baked just the right amount. It's served hot out of the oven with ice cream on top. May not sound like much but I promise it's delicious.
Helen C.,"Irvine, CA",134,779,,1.0,12/31/2006,"Much ado was made when a BJ's opened up in my rolle-polle hometown where palettes generally hover somewhere near bland.  So I shouldnt have been all that surprised to learn the food at this chain caters to a certain stripe.  Not to say the food is awful, but it's definitely nothing special.  The deep dish pizza is nothing more than an exalted deep dish from Pizza Hut.   If I had to choose between those two, I'd take Pizza Hut for two reasons: (1) BJ's charges far more for essentially the same product, and (2) my pizza from BJ's came to the table lukewarm!  Bleh.  If a pizza joint can't even manage to produce an oven-hot piping pizza, then that's where we part company."
Peter B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",9,70,,2.0,2/9/2007,"First off, I only come here for lunch, because this is the neighborhood I work in. Here are the reasons I don't like this BJ's location. 1 -  You have to look at your food come up before you receive it, so you know exactly how long it has sat there before they bring it to you. 2 -  I have gotten cold food here twice. 3 - The ambiance of the place is horrible and the place always seems crowded even if it isn't. 4 - Their beers mock me because I can't drink them at lunch."
Joey M.,"Corvallis, OR",10,102,,4.0,7/12/2010,"Every time I'm near UCLA I try to stop here, get a deep dish pizza, and then go across the street for dessert at Diddy Riese. I recommend the deep dish pizza, and I get it every time. I've had a couple of the appetizers here and they were just OK - nothing special. The 4/5 is mainly because of the pizza and location. Service has also been good each visit."
Beth F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,4.0,1/18/2010,"My husband and I stop in here for lunch after his appointments at UCLA Medical Center. Its a great deal, and we can both enjoy a sit down lunch for under $20 (if neither of us has a beer).  I do wish there were a couple more selections on the lunch menu...basically, there is nothing that falls into the ""good"" calorie count, but the smaller portions make up for it. Plus, its BJ's...if we wanted to be that healthy, we would go to Good Earth down the street. My guy is in a wheelchair, and BJ's never makes a fuss about seating him. The waitresses are always super sweet and efficient.  And I could live off of their tomato bisque."
Ev T.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,117,36,3.0,12/4/2009,"I've probably been to BJ's about 50 times. last time I ordered a mini pizza. When I got the bill, they charged me for a medium. I asked the waitress if it could be corrected and she brought over the manager. When the manager arrived at our table, he just ridiculed us for not knowing their pizza measurements, as if we worked there (or was intentionally trying to rip them off). That just shows you the quality of a place right there. Also, waitresses go missing on the regular so make sure you ration your beverage because a refill might not be coming any time soon. Other than that , the Parana Ale is great, the pizookies are incredible, the service is tired. I don't know if it's the abundance of college kids that hit this place that just wears them down or what."
Jenny B.,"Boston, MA",2,12,,4.0,11/25/2010,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has great food.  The menu is extensive, but almost a little overwhelming.  It is a good place for people who like different kinds of food.  There are really good salads and the pizookie (freshly baked cookie with ice cream) is amazing.  The seating is a little tight in places.  But it is definitely a good place to eat."
