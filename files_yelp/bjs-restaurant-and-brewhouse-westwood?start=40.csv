Kevin P.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",566,864,156,3.0,4/28/2016,"It's a great place for lunch or an early dinner before you catch a movie- it gets SUPER busy though, but it's worth calling about 30 minutes ahead to save a table. Their menu changes frequently, but as long as their pizza stays the same I'll be happy! They have decent mixed drinks, the service is really good here, and it doesn't take too long to get food, but as expected the busier it is the slower the food comes. Their lunch special is really good and reasonably priced - $8 for a personal 1 topping pizza and a wedge? Sounds good to me because the combo is filling and tastes great :D I probably come here once a month and never think twice about coming. Enjoy."
S R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,45,,5.0,6/12/2017,A great local spot for good vibes and good pizza. The staff is caring and helpful. Osvaldo is a waiter that is super kind and makes you and your friends feel welcome like a good local restaurant should.
Bruce H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,69,,5.0,6/24/2017,"While I know BJ's is a pizza joint their prime rib dinner is delicious. It comes with nice salad, two sides and their famous dessert. While it is always hard to go to a pizza place and not get pizza they have found something with the prime rib. Also, gentleman who greeted us was very friendly as was waiter. I had been here a year or two back and it was very disappointing kudos to management for turning this place around!"
Luke L.,"San Gabriel, CA",21,1279,8732,2.0,2/22/2015,"*Difficult parking (Broxton Avenue Public Parking is your best bet - $3 flat rate after 6 PM) *Pricey food (believe it or not, but healthier salads like BJ's Enlightened Entrees are actually more expensive than BJ's Specialty Salads - I am basically paying more for healthier food -_-) *Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad With Grilled Chicken Breast (Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette. $12.95): I wasn't impressed - tasted pretty stale and overshadowed by strawberry vinaigrette dressing. Conclusion: I guess there's really only one thing to order at BJ - Chicago deep-dish pizza."
Megan J.,"Riverside, CA",39,221,529,3.0,6/9/2015,"I have come to this BJ's many times and I came here yesterday for the first time in awhile. BJ's is A-OK.  Food: As a beverage I normally get their house brewed root beer and I enjoy this. For a meal, I usually get a small deep dish cheese and pepperoni pizza. I do like their pizzas. They're pretty good, but can be pretty greasy sometimes. Occasionally I will get a pizookie and I LOVE them. They are so good.  Service: The service is usually pretty good. It is sometimes lacking, but generally our server is on top of it enough so that we have a pleasant experience. Our server yesterday was good. He took my husband's allergy to onions and garlic seriously. He refilled drinks when they were low. He manicured unwanted or items that were finished off of the table. He was very good.  Ambiance: BJ's is a very chill environment that you can relax in. It is a great place to come to if you're with a group, want to get a couple beers, food and hang out to watch a game or something.  BJ's isn't necessarily my first choice of restaurants that I would go to, but it is usually pretty good and does the trick."
Sandra S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,38,,1.0,11/9/2016,"Such a horrible experience, I'm a big fan of Bj's restaurant in general, I went to this location with my friends for the first/last time after we voted yesterday, I hated it and I have a reasons for that. 1.The restaurant is very ugly and disgusting 2. The restaurant was full (over 60 people) and just 2 waitress 3. They served our dinner before appetizers which I never seen that in my whole life 4. My drink glass was empty for 20 min and the waitress just passed by ignoring that 5. I ordered clam chowder soup and I got something very deep and super salty which doesn't look like the soup at all. 6.Ladies room was very dirty and smelly and they didn't do anything about it when my friend mentioned 7.The waitress keep interrupting us with this paragraph (You need to move your cars if you park in the street, it's about towing) Stay away from this location, you will wasting your time and money."
Jordan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,9,1,2.0,11/27/2016,"I was very disappointed with this place. For starters, the service was bad. It took awhile for anyone to notice us sitting down when there were only like 6 other people in the restaurant.  The server was pretty out of it and served us our food before ever giving us silverware. The food itself was pretty underwhelming too. The soup/salad were very average and the pizza was flat out bad. You could tell the pan crust was pre-made and the toppings/cheese were pretty flavorless. It was Domino's quality at best, which is pretty terrible for a sit down place. I came for the 2 for $25 special so the prices weren't bad, but if you don't have any deals the place is pretty overpriced as well. I don't see myself ever coming here again."
Angela G.,"Oxnard, CA",7,16,11,1.0,3/29/2017,"When I first started coming to this BJ's, 3 years ago, it was great, service and quality of food; however, the past few times that I have gone the flavor is lacking and the service is poor. When ordering fries, they are soggy and taste like old oil, the quinoa is basically raw in other dishes, and the rest have no seasoning and look as if it was just thrown together after being nuked in a microwave. As for the service, they are slow. I used to be able to eat there on my lunch break. I would also suggest not ordering to go or pick up, when I have I paid full price for the meal and end up getting less than what I would have dining in. By all means I'm not saying don't enjoy a meal by this chain, I'm just saying don't go to this one."
Cvetelina O.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",37,3,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Worst service ever, my food was lacking flavor, my friend's spaghetti with meatballs were super spicy, our waitress had time to chat with her coworkers but not pay attention to her tables!!!"
Mayra C.,"Inglewood, CA",3,18,4,5.0,3/29/2017,"Stopped by for lunch with coworkers. Food was good, plenty tables but we did stop by at 11:30, the place was full by the time we left. Not too loud and wasn't rushed out."
Joe K.,"Los Angeles, CA",600,164,13,4.0,11/14/2016,"I like this spot! My berry cider was good, I liked my salmon dinner. My sister had the brussel sprouts which were good. For a chain in westwood, I'd definitely come back. We were in a rush and the service was attentive and helpful. The ribs and fries looked good. I'll have to come back and try them!"
Justme G.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,38,1,1.0,5/16/2017,"First of all I had to give one star to give my review of this place. Second I would NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN. 5/15/2017 my daughter is a heart patient at UCLA RONALD REAGAN HOSPITAL. She has been in the hospital for 1-1/2 mos. and she was given a 2hr pass just to get out and feel the sun on her and to get a little relief, so we decided to take her to this so-called restaurant. When we arrived we were greeted by a non feeling type of a so called person by the name of Kimberly, now my daughter is in a wheelchair and we were told that there was no where to place the wheelchair, she could not find a place to put the wheelchair and she stated that if it's in the walk way it's afire hazard. Right after she finally seated us a couple came in with a double stroller that was as big as the wheelchair and was blocking the walkway and NOTHING WAS SAID TO THEM ABOUT IT BEING A FIRE HAZARD.  People with a disability is NOT WELCOMED AT BJ'S. We spent close to $200.00 for a party of 6. WE TOTALLY FELT DISCRIMINATION ON KIMBERLY's part total RACISM AT ITS BEST. They tried to cheat us on the check but we caught it. We were charged for a root beer float which no one ordered. We ordered one root beer soda and when the desert arrived we put some of the ice cream in the root beer soda and they tried their dampest to charge us for a float...TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Before we left I had to let ""KIMBERLY"" know that she was wrong and that she will be reported then she tried her best to act like she didn't know what I was talking about. NO ONE FROM CORPORATE HAS CONTACTED US AS OF YET...BE WARNED IF YOU ARE BLACK BE CAREFUL"
M D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,27,9,2.0,8/19/2016,"Haven't had a pizza by them in a while so I was looking forward to their delivery, unfortunately it was a big disappointment with a huge mass of dough that tasted like a reheated store bought pizza.  Nor a fan and a waste of money"
Carlos G.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,40,50,1.0,8/5/2016,"Wow. Where do I start?  I ended up at BJ's because my vehicle GPS directed me to a non existent Chili's restaurant. So after being turned away at a nearby closed California Pizza Kitchen, I decided to try BJ's. This place was busy and we were quickly seated. Only a three or four minute wait and our server arrived to take our drink order.  When our drinks arrived we ordered and we were off to a great start. We ordered flat bread nachos for an appetizer. My salad arrived in a timely manner. Then 15 min later our dinner. This is where everything went down hill. My baked potato was overcooked. It was brown on the inside. It had a smokey taste. I was confused. Was it supposed to be brown? Surely the cooks would not send this out like this. It was cut open by the cook. He would have seen it. The server confirmed it was burnt and she offered another side. I had already finished my steak. Which was also overcooked. I had to keep adding A-1 sauce to the steak to moisten it up so I could eat it. I didn't want to complain to the server because she was very busy and I didn't want my friends to feel uncomfortable about me complaining again. We finished up and asked for our check and then out of the blue our flat bread nachos arrived. Of course we turned them away and were told we wouldn't be charged for them. All I asked for was some kind of discount for the burnt  baked potato. The server said i could have a free desert in its place. So I ordered the three cookie ice cream plate. But after 15 long minutes it hadn't arrived. We asked for our check. 10 minutes later no check yet but our  ice cream did arrive.   I said I didn't want it anymore and I asked for my check again.  I just wanted to leave. I was tired of waiting. The server said she would give us the desert and take it off our check. (It was supposed to be free) On our check the appetizer read ""free"" which we never received and turned away and our desert was taken off the ticket. Wow. What a bad experience. I still did not get credit for my baked potato. My friends wanted to leave a small tip but I insisted on a 15% tip to the server. I usually leave 20% tips. I don't think she was to blame for the under staffing and the terrible cooks. She was really trying. I am sure other patrons left her little to no tips because of mismanagement here at this location. The funny thing is my friend ordered the exact steak I ordered and said it was the worst steak he had ever had at a restaurant. He didn't want to complain because he thought the server could use a break.  He saw another table sending their food back."
Jimmy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,9,2.0,3/15/2016,"Been living in Westwood for a while but first time to BJs. The online menu and the pricing wasn't attractive enough. And the first time here might be the last. I came here at Sunday 5:50pm looking for a table for two, but it was full and loud. Considering the noisy environment and needing to wait for 20+ minutes, we quickly decided to make it a takeout. What you see on the menu is sooo not what you get. I ordered a shrimp and asparagus penne and what I received was this small portion that can't even cover the bottom of the box. The taste of the shrimp was fine, but the penne tasted like can food while there is like only one asparagus and rough as bark. The only good thing is the box was the bread. That's it. I will avoid this place and make better use of my money."
Miranda L.,"Tokyo, Japan",59,539,331,3.0,7/23/2015,"Okay location with a major service problem. The menu is somewhat limited compared to other BJ's locations in LA, so some choices you find elsewhere don't exist here. That being said, I still recommend the Deep Dish Pizza, French Dip, Buffalo Chicken Tenders, and of course the Pizookie. The issue here is with the service, which is regularly inconsistent. Normally the staff is just overworked and handling too many tables to give proper attention to you. But more than once (including my most recent visit) the server was just slow, and I watched my food linger under the heat lamp for far too long before it came to the table. Always fairly busy, usually with students. It can get very noisy too!"
Kaitlyn N.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,7,3,5.0,9/4/2016,"This was my first time at BJ's and I have to say the service here was spectacular.  My waiter, Trevor, memorized all 12 of our customized and very specific orders and got them completely correct when the food came out. While the restaurant itself was a little bit packed, the service and the food overrided any negative about the place. I'm not sure if the same goes for other BJ's, but if you're in the Westwood area and on a budget with your friends I would definitely recommend this place!"
Tatiana V.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,246,137,5.0,1/6/2017,"Came here today to treat a colleague out for lunch and I must say, while the food is average, loved our attentive and friendly service! I believe her name was Kayla (blonde young woman) and she was amazing and got us in and out in under 40 minutes."
Bhavika P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/5/2017,"The food was okay but the service was very bad . We sat right next to the counter where the servers put their orders in. My waiter kept talking with his coworker, while we kept waiting to ask him for the bill . He kept glancing but did not make a move . The manager a female, who was passing by asked if we wanted a box . I couldn't hear since there is a TV under us . Since she was far I asked her for a bill and a box . She rudely told me that she just asked that with an attitude . Me and my friend were so shocked with that reaction. A manager of a restaurant, should not act like that with any guest ."
Michelle T.,"Portland, ME",173,507,227,2.0,8/8/2014,"3-stars for the mahi mahi taco's I ordered, but 2-stars for just about everything else. The tortilla chips that came on the side. TERRIBLE. Stale, greasy, and according to my dining companions, ""smells and tastes like crayons.""  Hm. For $13, I think i could probably find something tastier elsewhere with a better bang for my buck, but BJ's was convenient, had no wait, and one of my friends LOVES this place.  Service was alright. Our waitress was prompt and nice enough, but you could tell she did NOT love her job. She just seemed real depressed. :( Poor girl.  Don't think I'll be back to BJ's in the near future, but even if I did, it wouldn't be the end of the world."
