Janani S.,"Irvine, CA",536,318,2,4.0,4/16/2009,"went here tuesday night in a group of 15 to celebrate my roomie's acceptance into USC's MBA program :) although our reservations were at 845, they weren't able to seat us until about 910ish. but they gave us 2 full appetizer combo trays to make up for it. very appreciated. food is standard BJs - good prices, yummy blackened chicken pizza (why did they take it off the menu??!), fabulous cider and AMAZING pizookies.  yum yum yum. :)"
Robby T.,"New York, NY",151,243,,4.0,10/17/2005,You can't deny that a thick slice of BJ's pizza and a sampler set of microbrewed beers will put a smile on your face...and a warmth in your stomach.   Tatanka Stout is wicked 8.1% if I remember correctly.  And it's strong enough to hold up to BJ's food.
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,3.0,7/6/2007,"A conversation about nachos: N:  Hon, if I get the nachos will you split them with me? P:  Nah, they always make me feel sick. N:  Me too P:  Why do you always order them then? N:  Because they are SOOOOO good Well, last night I ordered the veggie burger instead and darn, I should have ordered the glorious delicious nachos...even though I feel sick after I eat them.  The burger was OK, just your standard garden burger....but the bun was gross and so were the two slices of cheese that they put on top.  They did give you a lot of fixins to put on the burger....lettuce, onions, pickles....yum.  The fries were really great.  I got a wedge salad minus the bacon which was quite tasty.  Really crisp and fresh.  Paul got some type of chili meat burger...it was huge, he liked it.  But I left feeling sad.....I always order the Santa Fe Salad and the Brewhouse Nachos....so delicious....I should have known better and stuck to what I know tastes great!   The place has a great vibe though....big tables and booths, really friendly waitstaff.....prompt service, food always comes out pretty quickly.  This was my first time eating at this location....there are plenty of places in Westwood Village that are much better....but, this one is ok!"
K S.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,7,,2.0,1/5/2013,"After calling 3 times to place a take out order and being placed on hold for over 5 minutes each time, my order was given to me incomplete. The staff, especially the manager, were completely overwhelmed.  If you want food from here, go at an off time so that if you are eating in you can get a table and hopefully have better service and if you are ordering take-out, you can get someone to actually help you when you get there to pick it up and hopefully they will give you what you ordered."
Bruce C.,"Irvine, CA",0,24,,2.0,11/10/2012,10 bucks for a calzone that's the size of my palm? No way.
Jamar H.,"Gardena, CA",86,35,15,4.0,7/28/2010,"Not too bad. Food was great, and there wasn't too long of a wait. Beer was amazing, cold and crisp. Definitely  spot to hit!"
Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1086,1074,1299,4.0,1/6/2008,"The Pizza at the Westwood location was very good. Hot, fresh ingredients and decent service. A little pricey but the pizza was very satisfying . The beer was good on tap ( I liked the lite ale ) . I will defiantely go back again."
Abe S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,26,1.0,11/29/2012,this place is wort of the worst!  for 15 bucks you get a bunch of dough and not much of a deep dish pizza!  avoid at all cost.
Tushar A.,"Seattle, WA",2,6,,4.0,9/1/2010,I am surprised that the average rating is only 3 stars for BJs. This is probably because most UCLA students dont write reviews while at school... just guessing :) I really like their Pizza. I just eat (or used to eat) 3-4 varieties of vegetarian pizzas they have in rotation and pizzokie in the end :) I gave them one star less coz of the long waiting times which btw contradicts the not-so-excellent rating.
James B.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,5,,2.0,7/1/2010,"Most of the actual food here is not very good. The pizza is not as good as most other restaurants. The sandwiches, salads, and some of the other food here is not as good as other BJ's restaurants that I've been to. It's in a decent location for UCLA students and you basically can't go wrong with beers, so that's why I give it two stars. If you're able, go to the BJ's at the Westfield mall in Culver City right off the 405. It's much better, plus you'll have the mall to explore (which you might need because occassionally the wait can be pretty long)."
Epicurean _.,"City Center, WA",0,58,5,4.0,8/5/2012,"main course: I got the barbeque chicken pizza, which was too salty. drink: Had some beers here--they had some heffeweizens and lagers to choose from, which I like. The seared ahi salad was excellent, seriously an aaamaazzzing salid, which is why there are four stars for this review. dessert: The pizookie was pretty good, probably gained 10 lbs. from it. The service was great."
Dr K.,"Rosemead, CA",180,663,248,3.0,12/30/2007,"Food was ok.  Nothing special.  I heard the rootbeer was great, but the A&W tap rootbeer is way better.  It's probably good if you like to drink. The pisscookie is pretty good, but I know how to make it myself so it's not that special :P."
Jenn L.,"Long Beach, CA",99,86,1,2.0,7/15/2007,"Generally the food isn't bad here (not great either, but satisfying in that chain-restaurant way). I love me some Jeremiah red and their other microbrews, but unfortunately, this place is blacklisted because we got the WORST service I've ever had in a restaurant here. I'm convinced that our waiter was coked up. He took our drink orders three times, our food order two times, the food took insanely long and he promised us a free pizookie and never brought it out. The manager wasn't any help.  We've gotten consistently bad service here on the last three visits. The food gets 3.5 stars, the beer gets 4 stars."
R U.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,53,1,4.0,1/20/2008,"It is what it is. If you're expecting fine cuisine, you'll be in for a disappointment. The food is fine. I've had both pizza and burgers here. The portions are large and the price is about right. This is a much better alternative to Chili's. Like almost all restaurants on that street, the place is small. If you're going there during the lunch hour rush, you can expect to wait at least 15 minutes for a table for 4 or more."
Paul F.,"Lakewood, CA",331,372,140,4.0,6/7/2008,"This is the first BJ's I'd ever eaten at.  A friend and I would go here after class (UCLA extension). They have really good deep dish pizza.  Their beers are just OK, nothing that really stands out.  I will say that I don't care for their here-weizen beer, it's just doesn't taste right to me.  I learned to drink weizen (wheat) beers in Germany, so I'm a little picky. Because this is walking distance from UCLA, it can get REALLY busy, even late into the evening. Service is surprisingly good even when they are busy. There is some street parking, but good luck finding a spot.  There are several pay lots around the area, usually geared to students at UCLA, so expect to pay around $10."
Woger W.,"Allentown, PA",48,267,,2.0,5/24/2010,"Time to edit this.  I still keep going here despite the food.  Why?  It's a fun place and full of college students having a good time.  But the food is average at best and sometimes a lot worse and the carpet sure could use a nice shampoo, it smells like an old casino in there.  Good times."
O K.,"San Francisco, CA",24,292,36,3.0,11/16/2007,"I had never heard of a ""pizzookie"" until I came to Los Angeles. I don't know if they really have them in northern California. Anyway, the pizzookie was good. Nice sugar load at 11 PM. I love the sensation of cold ice cream with hot things!!!!! Especially big cookies! Still, apple pie a la mode beats pizzookie. EDIT I actually ate at BJ's for the first time. The pizza was decent; really really deep-dish, which is not really my thing, but the crust was nice as it had crispy cheese on it. We tried the blackened chicken and the barbeque chicken. Talk about RICH. And then, everyone got a personal pizzookie. I had the half Oreo, half peanut butter. It's cool because you can order everything in halves so you can try a bunch of different flavors. The nice thing about the Oreo pizzookie is that it comes with oreo mousse on top (a sort of glorified whip cream). That was pretty darn tasty. I love the soft, half-baked texture of the cookie too... now if only it came with a magic calorie eraser! Guess I'll have to go run tomorrow. That's what exercise is for, so you can eat at restaurants like BJ's and not feel TOO guilty."
Elizabeth h.,"Beverly Hills, CA",20,33,,3.0,4/17/2012,"pizookie, pizookie , pizookie , ok maybe they are great , but you still have to get through the dinner to have them....  all the entrees are disappointing at best , test as they only have a defroster  in the back, .....Please can somebody cook something in the back!!!"
Jesse B.,"Los Angeles, CA",325,259,49,3.0,12/20/2008,"""OMG THE PIZOOKIE'S LYKE THE BEST THING EVERRRRR!!!!"" the food is here is pretty much total trash but its a fun dining experience adn that dessert pizookie thing (a giant cookie with a massive amount of vanilla ice cream smothered on top) is borderline divine."
Lindsay H.,"Santa Clara, CA",229,348,308,2.0,2/6/2009,"I normally love BJ's, but the fact that this one is in Westwood makes it quite unappealing... it's always full of obnoxious undergrads who are overcrowding tables because more and more people keep joining their party. And what's worse, the place seems to be entirely employed by students as well. This means they're more concerned with socializing with their friends who've come to visit than they are serving or seating you. I'm a fan of the late nite happy hour, and just this place being open late in general, but the truth is that the later you come, the more annoying it gets. I always get super slow service at this BJ's, and am still saddened that they don't have a full bar at this location. I love BJ's, but this one in particular is pretty bad."
