Alex C.,"Alameda, CA",3,23,,3.0,5/2/2010,"The dinner was just ok.  I got a pasta, which I know isn't exactly what BJ's is known for, but none the less, the pasta was rather dry, however it was very filling so that was good.  The food came out fast, which was pretty cool since I was pretty hungry, and the service was pretty good.  We had two servers and the both were very friendly and attentive. We also got a pitcher of the hef, which I feel at other BJ's it taste better, but the beer was still good and quenching so no complaints there. All in all, a pretty decent meal, nothing uber spectacular."
Di L.,"Culver City, CA",182,275,307,3.0,9/13/2011,"Considering the fact that LA has only like a billion different restaurants of all types of cuisines, I consider myself to be SOO over chain restaurants.  More often than not, you really get the authentic flavor of certain cuisines in mom and pops shops. So I prefer to try new places when I eat out. BUT...since an ex-coworker came to visit and she hasn't been at BJ's for quite awhile, I figured, why not.  Location wise...well it's in Westwood, so there's a lot of traffic from the folks at UCLA, ahem, like myself.  So it's busy, especially during lunch time.  Parking wise, there's a structure down the street on Broxton so no worries on that.  The restaurant is a good size and there's an upstairs seating level.  And the food...well it was ok.  Not bad or fantastic.  I ordered the lunch special - salad & chicken Alfredo flat bread pizza.  The good thing is that it's just the perfect portion without feeling like you overstuffed yourself (i.e. Korean BBQ).  Salad was kind of bland, but at least it wasn't over dressed.  I also tried a piece of my co-worker's chicken tenders - which I admit was pretty yummy and freshly fried. but was everything worth 500 or so calories? eh, i rather splurge on some of Santana's carne asada fries in SD (or something along those lines).  but at least our waitress was pleasant, so that was nice."
Annie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,163,5,4.0,8/9/2009,I don't care that BJ's is a chain restaurant because their deep dish Chicago style pizzas are still damned good.
Armen O.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,,3.0,5/3/2012,"Only thing thats worth going to this place for is pizookie. If you get tired of Diddy riese in westwood and want a warm cookie with some ice cream on top, this is bomb. Other than that, the food isn't really that good, and the service is mediocre."
Karen O.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",2,13,,2.0,3/24/2012,"Salmon was charred, rice came out of a box mix. Not a lot of fresh food. Vegetable pasta had stringy, tough vegetables in it. The food here is not very good. Good beer selections."
Ben K.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",0,17,,1.0,12/21/2008,"Americans love to be fat You might be insulted by that, but as far as I'm concerned, that's the only thing I've actually gotten out of my experience at BJ's People love to read harsh, evil,  cunning reviews so prepare for happiness 1st: Atmosphere and Vibe This is actually the only reason why this gets a star at all. The feeling makes things fun, you just want to get up and dance, people are yelling and laughing, television screens are a bit loud, just happy. I was thinking to myself, oh, now this can't be that bad I WAS DANG WRONG Part 2: The food I ordered two dishes, one was the usual deep dish pizza, and potato skins. Potato Skins: This chef has to be the most lazy guy on EArth. These were deep fried quartered potatoees, hollowed a bit to be ""skins"" They had this really bad ranch sauce in the middle, that had to be from Vons or something like that, and then they dumped so shredded cheese on there.  They didn't even bother to melt the cheese, how lazy can you get? Just fling the thing into the broiler for a bit, then take it out THAT'S SO DANG EASY. That is literally the most simple rule in cooking.... MELT YOUR CHEESE. This was lazy, and honestly, pretty nasty. Deep Dish Pizza: Crust was not that bad, i admit it wasn't that bad, but the rest was sloppily made. Too much sauce caused everything to slip off like a dead salamander on a log, which is extremely unappetizing. It was okay, but not good enough to be a signature dish Part 3 Conclusion Alin all, a very bad restaurant.. I don't see this lasting for another year at this rate, but as long as americans like pizza and beer this will last. nothing more then that"
varesa c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,53,4.0,11/17/2009,"BJ's is always good. I often come here with my friends since everyone loves the all-around American food. Also try their pazookie, I love it!"
John H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,11,,3.0,1/19/2010,"Parking is Westwood is miserable. The service was pretty good, food was alright, and the beer of course was awesome. I would go again although I wish they had ample parking."
Ju P.,"Cypress, CA",143,38,,3.0,9/3/2011,ok pizza. great pizookies. ok price. had to wait for quite a bit before we could finally get our pizza.
Hannah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,212,190,4.0,2/20/2009,"i really like bj's, but can only handle it every few months because the portions are HUGE and everything is really rich and fatty. i've tried a lot of food here and the winners are: -spinach & artichoke dip (it's the best out there) -any kind of pizza (the crust will blow your mind) -broccoli cheddar soup and ceasar salad (you can get a soup/salad deal for cheap & still have enough food to take home to eat later or give to some homeless dude) -any kind of baked potato (they're gigantic -- beware) their pastas are pretty bland, so i stay away from those. i've had the chicken club sandwich before but it wasn't anything special. can't remember how the burgers are...the first time i had one, i had a really bad cold so i couldn't really taste food, but the texture was nice i suppose. fish & chips are okay, but nothing like you'll get in england!  one downside is the long wait (often 20-30 minutes to even get a table), but bj's is open late so i always go after normal dinner hours, when the wait isn't so bad. still, i'm always surprised at how many people are eating there at 11pm. i'd keep some pepto bismol on hand to help yourself recover from how rich the food is. the good news is that i've never eaten anything here that was even remotely bad...just some stuff i wouldn't eat again. oh, and the pizookies are great especially if you have a coupon!! and you get a free one if it's your birthday!"
dawson s.,"Los Angeles, CA",2015,386,616,2.0,7/29/2006,"I'm sorry to say this was mediocre at best ..   We ducked in today for lunch after snooping around at Secret Stash because The Beer recalled having some sort of orgasmic dessert experience at another one of their locations. We were seated at one of the few tables upstairs (which was awkward but all that was available) and ordered the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer. Despite the sauce being too sweet (even for me) they were very yummy (but then, I'm of the mind that you could deep fry a leather shoe and it would be good). They were a lot like the ones at Cheesecake Factory, but with the addition of bacon (I'm also of the mind that everything is better with bacon). He ordered the Roast Beef Dip and I had the BBQ Chicken Salad. After a long wait for the egg rolls, the main courses were up (literally and figuratively), and our server rushed us thru them so she could clear the plate and make room on the table. He said the roast beef was bland and rubbery and the roll was soggy on the inside and over crisped on the outside. The battered fries and horseradish creme were much better, but not enough to salvage the meal. As for my salad, had there actually been any bbq chicken in it, it might have been great. It was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce with a few kernels of corn, some black beans, jicama, tomatoes, and a few chunks of bland grilled chicken. Had they tossed half the lettuce, added more of the remaining ingredients and actually included some BBQ chicken, it would have been a worthy meal of a salad.   Food aside, we both had the Blonde brew which wasn't bad on a warm day if you're in the mood for a pale ale. Sadly, we were so bummed with our food and service, we passed on their signature Pizookie dessert (a giant deep dish baked cookie topped with ice cream). The Beer didn't even want to finish his fries ... never a good sign.  We would have been better off at Le Pain Quotidien or CPK - both next door - and so would you."
Peggy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,604,43,4.0,10/30/2006,"food is okay. beer is okay. service is okay. ambiance is okay.  nothing too special. why the four stars?  because their chicken wings are PLENTY special.  Pizookies are awesome as well.  for pizza, i prefer CPK (or for deep dish i go for zachary's in berkeley) but BJs got the variety and chicken wings!!"
Jennifer C.,"Santa Monica, CA",42,173,7,3.0,4/22/2007,"I don't care how mediocre the food is, the pizookie makes up for it all.  It is SOOOOOO yummy! Okay - I actually think the pizza is fine, it's like old school pizza hut greasy and super thick.  I like that you can ask for extra sauce and actually get it.  Once we got mozzarella sticks that came out STILL FROZEN and the manager was really nice and gave us a $25 gift card.  The food really is just decent but I've always had great service and the pizookies are sooooo yummy."
Tracy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,26,2,4.0,10/8/2009,"Being one of the few restaurants within walking distance of UCLA, this branch of BJ's is usually crowded with an assortment of co-eds and their visiting parents.  The menu is no different from any other BJ's, and I felt the food was prepared just as well as I've had at other locations.  I had the fresh basil and italian sausage flatbread appetizer pizza as my entree and was pleasantly surprised, as I have only had their regular deep dish pizza before.  Two of my friends raved about the minestrone, and the last member of our group said his pizza was pretty good.  This location seems to run out of their berry cider whenever I'm there, but luckily this time there was enough left for me.  We ended up staying at our table way after we paid the bill and we never felt rushed by the waitstaff, which was nice.  And the best part is if you didn't gorge yourself on a pizookie, Diddy Riese is right across the street!"
Pamela M.,"Los Angeles, CA",415,589,156,4.0,7/30/2006,"Go for the Pizzookie! Once my friend and I each ordered a pizzookie to go since we did not want to share, this is a lot of cookie and ice cream for one person normally at least 2 people if not more share a pizzookie. It is soo good that it's tough to share and ever since then I have often been tempted to just order a whole pizzookie for myself as my main meal but I am always convinced by my friends that it would not be a good idea.  I also like their chicken Caesar sand which and seasoned fries and recently had their wedge salad which I though was quite tasty! lettuce, bacon and blue cheese dressing!"
lily c.,"Sacramento, CA",39,136,6,3.0,11/30/2006,"i know at least two people who have gotten food poisoning after eating at this location. and the restaurant ambience is seriously lacking... unless you're seated in a booth, you'll have to yell across the table to be heard during peak dinner times.  this gets three stars only because bj's (as a chain) is still good. pick another branch if you can."
Procter F.,"Santa Monica, CA",13,209,6,3.0,1/9/2009,Went here for lunch the other day and tried their half pound burger which consisted of a perfectly cooked patty between two slices of sourdough bread. Their menu was very extensive and people around me really seemed to be enjoying everything. For lunch this place is definitely worth it.
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,107,,5.0,3/21/2006,"Oh how I love their huge baked potatoes.  I could eat one every day if the BJ's was closer, less crowded, and had more convenient parking.  :)  Aside from the potatoes, the great tasting sandwiches (with potato wedges) and the thick slices of pizza have always been great as well.  Of course, the pizookies are a must eat...but it's always a toss-up since Diddy Riese is right across the street."
T M.,"San Jose, CA",11,346,22,4.0,8/14/2007,"The service is alright.  I went their for lunch and their sandwiches aren't big, but tall and are really filling.  The pizookie was really good though.  I would definitely come back to try their other foods."
Nikhil B.,"San Jose, CA",33,118,4,4.0,10/16/2007,"Classic BJ's... good pizza, great beer. Always save room for the pizookie!"
