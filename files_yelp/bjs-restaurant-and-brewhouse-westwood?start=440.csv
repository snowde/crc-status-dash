Ai M.,"Bellflower, CA",100,2017,4020,3.0,10/20/2008,Chicken pot stickers and garlic cheese bread are good.  I like the cheese and tomato pizza.  I love the sweet onion strings.  I'm a fan of potato skins but I was too full of appetizers to finish it.  Santa Fe spring rolls are okay.
Scott A.,"Santa Monica, CA",2166,866,30,5.0,4/22/2007,"One of the best pizzas. I'm not much of a pizza person, but this pizza is good. Try the great white or BJ's favorite. There are two salads that are really good too, but I forgot what they are called. They are famous for the pizookies, but I have never tried that. You won't be disappointed with this place. I like how you can order a pizza half-half here. Try ordering a pizza and salad to share with a friend."
L J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,70,1,2.0,1/11/2011,"This place has a pretty good selection of beer, but beyond that, don't come here for the food. It's got a familiar Cheesecake menu, but the food is just so so. The french dip was a bit sad, and the bread lacking the to be expected crispness of a real french baguette. The app platter was an assortment of the same sort of fried looking food you can find anywhere, nothing special. The waitress was super perky and super excited to serve, and provided super above average service. The restaurant is loud, so it's not a great place to carry on a conversation, unless you shout above the din of whichever game is being broadcast on the multiple screens situation at various obtrusive angles around the restaurant. [5 stars for the staff that have to climb up those damn stairs and serve on the second floor.]"
Nick K.,"Seattle, WA",662,257,188,4.0,1/3/2009,"OMG, the wait!  Sometimes it's only a few minutes, but sometimes its as much as an hour.  Now they introduced a call ahead service, but they haven't advertised it much.  The wait is long, but the food is delicious.  BJ's is probably my favorite of the casual dining college crowd franchise restaurants (TGIF, Chili's, etc.), most because they offer excellent brews.  It's too bad this location got rid of their brewing equipment, and they only have their barrels for show now.  Regardless... give me a baked potato or burger and a beer, and I'm so happy!"
Kitkat N.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,19,,4.0,4/8/2009,Bj's rarely ever fails me. It's pizza is delicious I have not tried the pasta yet so yeah. but the pizookie is a must try. if you haven't you just haven't lived in California yet. order the buffalo chicken pizza.
Cathleya G.,"Berkeley, CA",169,578,11,3.0,10/17/2005,"There is no better way to describe BJ's than AVERAGE.  Average food, yucky salads, average beers.  One thing I do love here is the soups.  Minestrone and Clam Chowder are both wonderful here.  I know, wierd right?  The clam chowder is so generously chock full of clams.  Despite the food, the atmosphere (especially in westwood) is great for dinner with friends before a night at bars."
milla p.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,18,,3.0,3/2/2010,"Almost always a wait.  Love the pizookies and the berry burst cider.  The food is ok, but know that this location is catered to UCLA students, so be aware of the frat-like atmosphere. Oh, and parking sucks in westwood."
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,208,,3.0,10/3/2005,"BJ's was a favorite in the UCLA days...especially when they didn't scan those fake IDs.  But in retrospect, their food really isn't great.  Salads are below average and the pizzas (one of their specialties) are super greasy.  I would only really go there for appetizers (they do have a good spinach/artichoke dip) and their own brewed beer...the beer sampler is really the way to go.  It can be a good place to watch a game and drink some beer in a chill atmosphere."
Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",202,202,49,2.0,2/17/2008,The wait is always too long and the food isn't as great as everyone says. I always get this exceptionally strange waiter and there never seems to be enough tables. Don't go unless you're prepared to wait at least half an hour.
Tami R.,"New York, NY",204,289,2,3.0,1/11/2007,"It's a UCLA favorite, but last night, even thogh we scored by getting a booth, I was less impressed than in general.. their potstickers were good, but who serves buffalo wings with the buffalo sauce on the side??? And the i do not reccomend the Oreo Pizzookie... I thought i liked it last time, but this time it was a bit off too sweet or something... my date defintiely wished i had let him order a Chocolate Chunk one."
Nicole D.,"Bedford, TX",119,122,29,3.0,2/6/2007,"I've been here several times, and the only thing I've ordered every time is Harvest Hefeweissen. The pizza is yummy, the appetizers are yummy...I can't say I've ever had bad food from here. The wait sucks sometimes, but once I get seated I've always had a good experience. Nothing amazing, but nothing awful either. Good spot to go if you're bored and in the mood for beer and pizza."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, CA",136,1486,5781,4.0,2/16/2007,MMMM... loaded veggie stuffed potato and PIZOOKIE!! yum! Pizza wasnt that great... but after eating the pizookie thats all I could think about... yum. I want one right now!
Mike C.,"West Hollywood, CA",49,555,106,3.0,1/17/2007,"For lunch, it gets 4 stars and for dinner 2 stars. Dinner is a mess and a madhouse. It's packed, you're not getting in, and the service and food goes downhill. Sometimes in the summer when UCLA isn't in session dinner can be okay, but for the  most part you're screwed. Why not go to the million other places in Westwood for dinner? Lunch is great here! It's relaxed, the service gets nicer, the food somehow tastes a bit better, and the atmosphere is smooth. You can have a normal conversation without worrying. The food here is decent. Pizzas aren't so good, burgers and sandwiches are good enough. They're hearty and hit the spot. Pizookies are also highly recommended. Prices aren't too bad for what you get, especially in LA."
Amy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",429,532,155,3.0,5/17/2007,"The only time I've been to Bj's is for the pizookie, which is a giant gooey hot cookie, baked in a shallow pizza tin, and topped with vanilla ice cream. Minus 2 stars for not having anything else that appears to be remotely edible."
kyla h.,"Santa Cruz, CA",6,9,,4.0,10/25/2007,"I love BJ's. Who doesn't love BJ's? Its packed every night with college kids lining up to get their fill of BJ's. Frankly, I can see why and its not just the name, rife with innuendo as it may be. The food is dece and the pale ale is delicious!"
five s.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,112,20,2.0,9/7/2009,"The service is really nice, but expect to wait for a REALLY long time! I've been here three times; once for a birthday party that had reservations we waited over an hour from the time they gave us. Also this place has very little for vegans."
Samantha T.,"Oakland, CA",45,149,18,2.0,8/19/2008,"Eh, BJ's... I want to like this place better because whenever I go here, the food is decent as expected of all BJ's, but the servers are always hounding me. As soon as I sit down, they ask me what I want to eat, I just sat down and I have not even opened a menu. I look outside and there is no one waiting, so I just ask for another minute. Now when I actually want to order, there is no one in sight, I am trying to wave some one down, but only the hostess out front is still in view of the restaurant. When the server finally came back, and they took my order, they started doing that thing I get when I go get my hair done, bugging me to order additional items. It wasn't a simple ""would you like fries with that?"" but a ""would you like fries with that? oh no? how about onion rings? no? how about an appetizer? do you think you'll want to order dessert early?"" and on and on in that matter where I felt pressured to order food that I did not even want. That being said, I enjoyed my chicken club sandwich with wedge salad. The dressing was a bit too sweet, but how bad could it be with blue cheese and bacon? The sandwich was still warm, the avocado, bacon and chicken was nice combination. The food was to be expected from any BJ's but the service made me felt as if I was at a used car lot."
hank c.,"Cerritos, CA",103,151,,4.0,7/17/2006,this is the original BJ's for me. i remember the first time i went -- it was the first time i ever really had ALE so that was an experience in itself. then i got wasted so the pizza tasted real damn good. then by the end of the night when my buzz wore off -- we had the pizooki dessert and i was in heaven. good times!
gepeto p.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,21,,1.0,9/19/2009,"Disappointed again.  Chain or no chain, where's the quality? Homemade rootbeer?  Not good at all.  Asked for water, and got straight out of the bathroom sink tasting tap water (most places at least filter the tap water)- I couldn't drink it, it almost made me sick, literally!  There was a long wait for everything- 20 minutes from the time we ordered our drinks until the time the arrived, and then 15 minutes after our drinks to place our first order lol..  How can a place like this even have a wait (or a store front for that matter)?  The service as a whole is not all that impressive, from the entrance/waiting list to the waitress to the food, this place was a borderline dump.  I had the honey chicken salad.  It turned my stomache.  The chicken strips were at least fried correctly, but the salad was soggy and cheap tasting, saturated with a deep mayonaise tasting honey dijon sauce.  The ""works"" deep dish pizza wasn't too bad, but we honeslty could have gotten much better from Papa Johns.  Should have went with CPK just across the street.  The Pizookie was okay, but Diddy's is way better (and cheaper)."
Belle n.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/1/2009,omfg. i love bjs! they have yummy pizza and salad ever (:  yumyumyum!
