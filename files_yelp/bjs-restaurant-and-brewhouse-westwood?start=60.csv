Brandon C.,"Dallas, TX",126,120,2,1.0,1/6/2017,Giving a 1 star review is giving way too much credit. We placed our order and my wife specifically said no mushrooms.  When you are pregnant you can't eat mushrooms.  Obviously BJ's staff do not listen. We waited for our pizza. We look at the food ready to be served and there is our pizza.  After 7 minutes sitting under the food warmer the waiter decided to bring our pizza and when it arrived FULL of mushrooms.  It's one thing to pick 1-2 mushrooms off but when it was loaded we had to tell them we could not eat it. Needless to say we will never go back.
Dana E.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,31,4,5.0,1/2/2017,"Enjoyed watching the Rose bowl game here. You have to order the deep dish pizza here because that's what they're known for. I had the classic combo sausage, pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms and it did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and attentive, though it was not very busy."
James W.,"West Hollywood, CA",2665,1908,8066,4.0,2/25/2015,"Great meal! I kind of dig the casual brewhouse vibe of this place. Service was fast and friendly. The menu looked delicious. 1. Spicy pepper burger: Delicious! Juicy and the crunchy fried peppers made it great. Oh, and the super buttery buns didn't hurt. You have a choice of thick or thin fries on the side. I went with the thin, which was a good choice. Crispy. 2. Blackened chicken salad: My friend really enjoyed it. I tried the chicken with the cranberries and blueberries in the salad and it was decent. The table next to us had a deep dish pizza that looked phenomenal. I also wanted to try the dessert baked cookies with ice cream, but today was gym day. Dessert for another day!"
Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",59,282,167,5.0,4/25/2016,We have gone to the one in Vegas and thought why not try this location. Not as big of course but our waitress was very nice and the food was delicious ;) we'll be going back for sure!
Joey T.,"Simi Valley, CA",217,455,77,2.0,6/8/2015,"BJ's. Goes right in the same category as Cheesecake factory, chilies, and similar restaurants with big menus and TVs and anything you could want.  Normally I think that BJs is a little better than it's direct competitors. However the BJs in in Westwood is not up to snuff with other BJs. It's smaller, and the service was not nearly as good. It seems like they were trying real hard, but with the NBA game on it took us FOREVER to get a table. The food took a long time to come out. Some people got the wrong dishes, some people had cold food. It seemed like they were having a real rough night.  I got a french dip and it was okay. I wish there was not globs of aoli on it because it kinda took over, and the fries were cold, but aside from that it was okay. Just a tad more than I wish I would have paid.  As always the atmosphere during the sports game was fun, and the pazookies are to die for. I really should have just eaten somewhere else and came in for a cookie."
Leon P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,49,17,4.0,12/8/2016,"Great place and environment! The service was good. The food was great. Used their ""buy one entree get one entree free (dine-in only)"" coupon via online. I ordered a Parmesan Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes as one entree while the other entree was a Spicy Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya."
Angelina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,18,2,2.0,4/13/2017,"This place is inconsistent AF. I go to lunch here sometimes because it is a 1-minute walk from my office. The food doesn't blow my mind but I don't have any complaints. I stick to the same stuff all the time, tortilla soup, salad, burgers, pizookie. The problem at the Westwood location is that sometimes the service is amazing: they refill your water before you run out, they ask if you need more of anything, and best of all they actually acknowledge you when you come in. Today was not like that. After seating down for about 7 minutes and having 3 of the servers give me really odd looks, I finally got someone to take my order. No ""hello"" or a smile. Then someone else brought my food and I didn't see the waiter again for a good 45 minutes. I got the unlimited soup and salad, which means I get refills but I was never offered one. I had to ask someone else for the soup to go and the check. They gave me a cup of the soup, no bag, no napkins, no spoon, and no  toppings (what's tortilla soup without the tortilla chips on top?!). I would say I'm disappointed but my experience says service is bound to get worse. I will reserve my trips to BJs to other locations."
Mac M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,3.0,12/3/2016,Was here last night with friends. Cool vibes with Giant TV all over the place. But its annoying to have been asked multiple times for the same thing by the server. Calamari is not that good though. In house beer or bud-light is your only the choice.
Abby B.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,7,5,1.0,11/10/2016,I've been to several BJ locations in the area and this is by far the worst I one I have been to. I attempted to give it a second try and was underwhelmed. I can get over bad service but the food here is just not good. Food is both undercooked and overlooked. Their fries were probably the worst I have ever had. Not coming back to this location.
Susana K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,11,3,3.0,5/23/2017,"Came in for dinner with my kids, super busy and the food was cold. The only good thing about this place was the service."
Erick A.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/23/2016,"Probably the worst customer service I've ever encountered.  It took them 10 minutes to seat us even though there were clearly many tables open and many workers were clearly not occupied --- rather they were: one was watching the game, another was texting away, and another two were laughing it up.  It then took 15 minutes to get our drinks and 20 more for our actual food to come out... this would be understandable if they were actually busy but they had plenty of empty tables and it was not busy whatsoever. Ridiculous."
Nikki R.,"Los Angeles, CA",258,133,323,2.0,4/3/2015,"The food was so gross that a microwaved frozen meal would've been better. The restaurant was empty yet we still had to wait for an hour for our food. Way overpriced for the subpar quality. Only go to BJs for the pizookies, which are expensive but taste delicious at least.  If you're looking for a nice place to go out and eat, keep searching because this is definitely not worth your time and money."
Daisy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/11/2016,"12 stars if I could. My son's football team (Taft High School) hosted a fund raiser here. From the manager,   Matthew Burin, to the hosts, and servers, everyone was all the way on! The food was really good. It totally hit the spot. After a couple of glasses of wine, excellent company and remarkable service from the staff I was ready to call it a night. Thank you to the BJ'S team for helping in making the fundraiser a success. Matthew you are a gem. Loved meeting you and I'll be back soon for another Bazooki lol"
Bonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,516,615,3.0,4/1/2014,"BJ's offers a good variety of items, but we typically stick to the deep dish pizza. Two people can share a small deep dish special. It may LOOK small, but it will definitely fill you up. Don't be a fatty. They also offer a nice variety of beer :)"
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,315,569,4.0,3/22/2015,"I'm going to give it a four for MY experience but in terms of food definitely a 3. As always we start with parking! Read yelp and basically discovered parking is horrendous, but to my surprise it's not AS bad as you would think. It's not a private lot so you're going to end up paying but like most people said it's a flat rate after 6 or by the hour in lots/garages during the day. You can also do meters but if you think you're gonna stay longer than 2 hours might be better not to.  I went before 6 on a Saturday and found a small lot right behind Whole Foods that cost 5 bucks. There was a parking garage across the street that was 3 bucks flat after 6. There's a lot more garages than I expected. But honestly if I can just find parking relatively close to my location I'm pretty dang happy.  I joined 3 other ladies that night and for the most part enjoyed it. Company definitely makes up for lack of food quality.   This was my first time at this location and I kind of enjoyed being on the top floor, it felt a bit more intimate for us.  The food was okay to me. I got a pasta instead of a pizza for the first time and it was meh...  I'm a die hard deep dish fan and actually really enjoy those pizzas but I decided to try the chicken Alfredo.  It was okay. I just wasn't blown away, there wasn't anything great about the sauce or the chicken, but I was content.   Service was okay. Nice guy. Got switched to a woman half way, wasn't as great but wouldn't complain that much. Now the reason I say 4 stars for us, or else this would be a basic 3 star review, is because we ordered 2 pizookies. One came out fine but the other took so long that our friends had already eaten theirs. Turns out the order was made incorrectly twice, but the chef came out to our table personally apologized for the mistake and said the pizookie was on the house. Now that was good service for an honest mistake.  I know people have talked about bad service but for the most part it was an enjoyable pleasant night. Will I come back to this location? It's a maybe. But still not a bad night! P. S salted caramel pizookie didn't live up to the expectations I had, was way too salty for my taste buds. You may like the sweet and salty thing but it was too overpowering for me unfortunately.  :("
Farwah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,324,40,5.0,9/30/2015,"Great white pizza and a pizookie. Can't go wrong with this anytime, anywhere!  BJs has lots of options. I've had the late night happy hour, good stuff, the under 500 calories chicken and vegetables - excellent!, the blackened chicken pasta, other pizzas, other pizookie flavors, but the best of the best of this place is the great white and the pizookie FTW. Great place for causal dining or take out."
A. R.,"Gardena, CA",70,50,38,1.0,1/1/2016,Horrible food! We got seated right away but when we got out soup the spoon was dirty and both my friend and I were served cold soup and by cold mean fridge cold.
Dre D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",79,32,26,4.0,10/3/2016,"The food is forgettable which is why I took a star off , but I only go for the pazookie which is 5 star worthy. Ice cream atop a fresh baked cookie what more do you want ? If your hungry for real food the have a decent selection but if don't get a pazookie after you wasted a trip to Bj's."
Glaizll G.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,61,117,3.0,3/8/2015,Typical BJs restaurant Parking: Somewhat limited. Depends on what time you come. Wait time: Typical.  Service: Typical. Server was nice and attentive. Bar area: Plenty of seating at the bar and bar area.
Jenn T.,"Redlands, CA",899,939,162,3.0,9/29/2015,"Came here to get a bite to eat.  It wasn't too crowded at the time but got pretty crowded later.  They have the typical BJ's menu.  I got the roast beef sandwich, which was ok, a little salty but decent.  They had a yummy oktoberfest beer that I liked.  They also have a cool tasting flight.  The service was quick, helpful and decent.  They changed the channels on the TVs around us so that we could watch our football game of choice."
