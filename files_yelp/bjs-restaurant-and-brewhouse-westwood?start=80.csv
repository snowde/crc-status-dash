Jason L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/24/2017,"It was a busy night, we received a text that our table was ready and then waited another 15 minutes after that. But when I contacted Erica the manager, we were seated right away. But their ordering device did malfunction causing us to wait longer to order. Will come again."
Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,363,3201,3.0,1/18/2013,"While I have been here many times in the past, the review below will reflect my past visit earlier this month. Coming here after hiking the Rustic Canyon trail, I ordered a grilled turkey burger within minutes of being seated immediately for a holiday lunch. Service was intermittent, and slow at points. The waitress also managed to spill water onto one of my friends, however, this was a mistake and quickly dismissed. However, what shocked me was their slow service during this holiday. I realize it may have been due to poor staffing, but after taking a look around there seemed to be quite a few staffers and folks in the kitchen. Furthermore, the restaurant was half full. It didn't make sense. When I received my burger, it was not piping hot as I had hoped. It was moderate in taste, and as you may suspect, it wasn't as tasty as a beef burger. Unlike a beef hamburger, the turkey burger was the healthier option.  I should have ordered a pizza, as they can be quite tasty here. I'll be back here for probably a UCLA event, hopefully not on too busy of a night as they tend to get packed here. The location is small, and parking options are limited to private lots and meters that stay packed during operating hours. Consider other options if you're not a local, and if you're driving."
Teresa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,206,,4.0,10/25/2015,"I had BJ's for the first time ever yesterday. I had a Mini-Pizza, with Green Bell Peppers, Roasted Peppers, Mushrooms, Pineapple, and Roasted Garlic. I also had a Salted Caramel Pizookie. The food and dessert were good! I'd make a return to BJ's. For the record: I give BJ's a 4-star Yelp review because they couldn't split the check (My party was paying with cards and cash)."
Tricia M.,"Seal Beach, CA",201,454,985,5.0,8/8/2014,"Wait, BJ's is really good. Like whoa, I'm impressed good. Every time I've come here, the service has been more than accommodating, even when I've come here with big groups. There's options on the menu that will satisfy the stomachs of carnivores, vegetarians, weight-watchers, and carbo-loaders.  Avocado egg rolls were surprisingly hearty and crispy. Brussels sprouts salad was pretty bomb.  My experiences at BJ's has been consistently good. It also looks like they have some pretty good lunchiez deals too, so if you're looking for a nice sit-down restaurant among the small eateries in Westwood, BJ's is a good place to go to!"
Michael P.,"Los Angeles, CA",604,76,36,1.0,6/7/2015,"This might be the worst BJ's I've ever been to. No wonder no one at UCLA ever talks about going here. I came with my friends to watch a basketball game and we ordered a large pizza. I've had BJ's pizza many times before, so I know what to expect. We had 5 people eating pizza, so we chose the large pizza (10 slices) - perfect. We get a large pizza sliced into 8 slices (for 5 people). We ask our server and she also points out that the sauce on the pizza are incorrect and were switched. She laughs it off and says the guy in the kitchen is new.... Uhhh ok so now what? The manager comes by and basically ridicules us saying that we still got a large pizza. I don't think this guy understands how inconvenient this is. Don't think I'll be coming here again."
Zachariah A.,"Palm Desert, CA",51,268,29,3.0,7/20/2016,Lunch specials are great value. When you're a student on a tight budget....I approve!
ryan d.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,19,,2.0,1/24/2017,"we didnt stay. they dont have liquor and it was beyond packed...way too slow. i feel bad, but this place just isnt great."
Michelle N.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",605,153,124,5.0,3/22/2016,Five stars for pazookie!!!! I literally only come here for the pazookie when I want to cheat with dessert. Pazookie is basically a deep dish cookie oven baked to perfection to melt in your mouth with a scoop of ice cream. Wow! I can taste and smell the aromas just talking about it. Seriously you will not be disappointed and the good thing is they have two sizes a large and an individual portion so you can decide if you want to share or not. Usually someone has to be on my good side to share my pazookie! Lol
Melissa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,230,11,1.0,5/25/2016,"We had to walk out after ordering our drinks because the host, covering for our waitress (""she'll be right with you""), forgot about us. Our waitress never showed in 20 minutes. The tables on both sides of us were served multiple times by two separate people and we sat there ignored. It hurt to feel that BJs did not want to serve us for some reason."
Justine A.,"Wichita, KS",32,149,13,2.0,12/1/2015,"The restaurant was empty and service was slow. My table kept having to look around for our server for refills, napkins and sides of ranch we request for the 2nd time.  Our food was delicious. I enjoyed my Oreo poozkie. I think that my favorite part of my dinning experience. But service wasn't at its best as it should."
Sana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,4.0,2/20/2017,I love their pizookies. They give a free mini pizookie if its your birthday. The food is alright. Sometimes they have great deals. Their boneless wings are pretty good as well.
Todd H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,4.0,8/22/2016,"After having Fantasy Drafts at B- Wild Wings( Crenshaw Mall location) and Jerry's Deli(Marina Location) this place...... was great. We reserved the upstairs location, had no problems getting to our area, and was not given a horrible 2 hour limit like the one at Fox Hills mall. The waiter was great. Took the orders for a group of 13. Food was served quickly and we all enjoyed our time there! The upstairs was kind of limiting in terms of space but the excellent service from everyone involved made us forget. Thanx for a great experience, see you next year! Todd"
Lynette J.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,37,4,4.0,6/27/2016,"So I would give you guys five stars but a few mishaps occured including a person on the phone who stated we would have priority seating when we walked in and we didn't and the waiter that dropped the two glass plates full of food right behind my 2 year old. I could be highly upset but our waiter was your restaurants saving grace!! I think his name was, Mike or Rick or something like that. He worked the upstairs tables at around 630 Sunday night.  HE WAS AWESOMELY FANTASTIC!!! And deserves a raise, a big one!!! He taught my brother the rules of soccer, he was engaging and he really knew your menu. If I ever find my way back I want him to wait my table again."
Irma N Victor L.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,2,4,2.0,1/5/2017,"One of the worst BJ'S restaurant I have ever been too (service wise) and I love going to BJ'S restaurants with my family.. this was the first and last time I come to this location.. we get there and got seated right away (plus side).. no silverware at all was given to us.  We figured we would get them when the food got there.. first waitress took our drink order,  came back with a pint of beer when we ordered a pitcher.  No bigger we thought she would bring the rest later.. then she took our food order.. nothing wrong there.. she went on break introduced us our new waitress.. our food got to us.. still no silverware was given to us.. we couldn't find our waitress so we kindly asked a male waiter who had happened to be passing by if he could kindly supply us with silverware (he gave us a strange look) and then said yes.. he literally went behind what looked like a hostess stand (but towards the stairs of the restaurant) and just stood there.. didn't get us anything.. so my husband went to the actual hostess and asked her for some.. she quickly apologize and gave us the silverware.. My husband let her know that the guy we had asked did not help us at all and just went to so stand there doing nothing.. then we finally got a hold of our new waitress and asked her if the waitress before her had charged us for a pint or a pitcher because we had ordered a pitcher.. she went to go check and said she had only charged  for a pint that she would win that.. then she came back with a full pitcher, which my husband told her she shouldn't have filled it up since he had the pint already.. she said that was the least she could do so we thanked her.. ask my husband starts pouring himself his beer from the pitcher he said I just saw something come out of the pitcher then he waited for the foam in the glass of beer to settle the say that indeed something was in it.. a piece of pepperoni! Disgusting! We didn't even order anything with pepperoni!  We then got a hold of the our waitress and let her know what had happened and just told her not to bring us any more beer at all.. this was the worse experience i have ever had in a BJ'S restaurant. .On the plus side the food we ordered was delicious, too bad for the rest.."
Jonathan W.,"Monterey Park, CA",497,94,249,3.0,6/1/2015,Easy to make a reservation.  Called in the night before for a group of 12. Called in the morning day of to confirm. Don't do split checks. Will allow 3 credit cards max. Got the medium pizza deep dish split half Mediterranean and BJ'S special. It was good. 8 splices enough for 2 people to split. Had a poozookie. Good. The service could be better. The waitress took my buddy's order but lost it. So he had to wait twice as long for his food. My group had to ask for serving utensils and napkins. And my buddy had to ask twice for ranch and tobasco. They also mischarged my friend $40 but we caught the mistake was able to correct it. They have lots of tables and seating but can be cramped when restaurant is busy.
Crystal C.,"Tempe, AZ",71,47,16,5.0,5/31/2016,"Had there brunch breakfast super good ! Got French toast eggs bacon and potatoes . I wish they had regular hash-browns but everything was really good ! My server Richard was super awesome and attentive , probably one of the best servers I've had in awhile. I come to this location frequently and I haven't been as happy with the other servers or experience but this time changed my mind and I think I'll be back :)"
Duchess A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,5,4.0,1/16/2016,"definitely a great place to watch a game. they added a lot of tvs and have revamped their menu quite nice. I tried their light switch light beer and it was absolutely wonderful. At only 120 calories, why not right!  ordered the salmon plate and was absolutely delicious. Definitely happy I gave this place another shot."
Justin T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,16,1,1.0,2/15/2016,"By far this is the worst experience I've ever had at one of these restaurants. Ordered a California chicken club sandwich and realized the other half of the meat wasn't cooked all the way never would I come back here or recommend this place to anyone. If you are in the Westwood area and want better food late at night there are a lot more places around here and so much better. Service was also horrible. Really slow, and was asked 5+ times if we have been helped and was told they were going to clear off a table for us. It took them 10 mins for someone to finally clear off a table. When I got to the table it still wasn't wiped down properly and still had the previous groups food on the table. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE WHAT SO EVER. This franchise is a great one but not this specific location."
Mike M.,"Ventura, CA",100,13,,3.0,6/4/2016,Food is good. Beer is great. Wait staff is very slow. Make sure you time in the parking meter.
Gizelle P.,"Pasadena, CA",872,326,1141,4.0,12/19/2013,"Honestly I wouldn't rank this place so high (maybe a 2 or 3; pizza's aren't great) if it weren't for the Pizookies. It is honestly my favorite dessert ever: it's a fresh baked cookie topped by a scoop of ice cream. I go for standard chocolate chip. Or if I'm with a group, I go for the sampler, which is excellent but I'm not man enough to tackle it on my own. WHY GO TO DIDDY RIESE ACROSS THE STREET WHEN YOU CAN GET MELTY GOODNESS UNDERNEATH A SCOOP OF VANILLA? WHY ARE YOU DEPRIVING YOURSELF OF HEAVEN? Seriously though, Pizookies kick Diddy Riese's butt."
