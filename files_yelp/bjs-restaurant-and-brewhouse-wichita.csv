Lee V.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,32,31,5.0,12/9/2017,"By far our favorite place to eat! The menu can be rather overwhelming, considering it's the size of a textbook, but there's something for everyone! Service was outstanding! People were friendly & staff was accommodating! Kid friendly & all around, simply fantastic! We had the trio dessert, Slow Roasted Turkey sandwich, Deep Dish Zutisi, kids burger & fries, and kids spaghetti. Right after we ordered, our waiter brought over some bread and small fruit bowl for the kids while their meal was being prepared. Always a pleasant experience at BJs! Love this place!"
Mary B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",10,91,28,1.0,11/27/2017,"I've been coming here ever since they opened and I can't believe that now they are charging me for bread everybody in the area doesn't charge for bread, tutto fresco woodranch this is the last time this place will see me"
Ray N.,"Tulsa, OK",152,322,517,4.0,6/7/2017,"I like this chain!  For casual dining it's really pretty good.  This location like the others I've been to is quite large, has a ton of staff and lots of places to sit in multiple 'area's if you will.   There's a nice bar section and other places to sit that can accommodate a large group or a booth for a slightly more intimate setting. The food here is pretty darn good too.  I've had their ginormous salads and have enjoyed a low cal bison burger and fried calamari.    the service here is great and the place is clean.    I'd recommend coming in here for sure!  Enjoy."
Angie H.,"Wichita, KS",21,101,89,4.0,5/29/2017,"This is one of my go-to places on the East side when I'm sticking to my diet because they have more than the normal amount of dishes I can eat.  I'm on a gluten, dairy, rice, soy, fun-free diet, so usually there's not much for me to choose from.  This place has a huge menu and a couple of quinoa dishes that are not only Angie diet-friendly, but really damn good!  the siracha brussel sprouts are also excellent! My hubby likes this place, too because he isn't locked into one kind of cuisine...they have a bit of everything. One major perk of this place is that they have house-made root beer and black cherry soda...totally to die for!"
Steve P.,"McConnell Air Force Base, KS",0,2,2,5.0,10/10/2017,I love this place! The avacado egg rolls are a must try and the BJ's beers are great. I've never had a bad experience here.
Sumayya V.,"Wichita, KS",1,6,10,3.0,6/11/2017,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. They have a lot of choices on their menu and they even have a small selection of 'Light' entrees. I like that the place was pretty large so it doesn't get too crowded. The service was subpar. Our server never gave us silverware or napkins so that was disappointing.  The food was pretty good. I ordered the Barbacoa cauliflower tacos with fries.  Instead of the Greek yogurt creme, I asked for chipotle mayo dressing on my tacos and they ended up tasting delicious. The fries were ok, nothing different about them. I mainly ordered the tacos because they were served in flatbread instead of tortillas but part of the flatbread for both of the tacos that I got was burnt. The part of the tacos that weren't burnt was really good. I might come back and give them another try. I didn't get to try their famous pizookies so I'll have to come back to try those."
Catherine V.,"West Hills, CA",1,61,72,5.0,8/15/2017,"This place was great! Lots of seating, friendly staff and relatively fast service. Most importantly, the food was fantastic! I made a customized mini pizza with pesto, mozzarella, mushrooms, onions, artichokes and basil ... Soooo freakin good! It was the perfect size too! Will def be back!"
John C.,"Wichita, KS",82,48,15,4.0,1/19/2017,"Tried this place a couple times, first time we went wasn't bad at first, but a few hours later both my wife and I ended up sick.  Fast forward a few months later, we decide to try again, thinking maybe the first time was a fluke, bad choice.  Both times that we've eaten here we got food poisoning, needless to say we won't try a third time.  The service both times has been lackluster to say the least considering they weren't very busy(daytime). Management was quick to get ahold of me and was kind enough to make it right.  Prompt contacting and friendly management, looking to go back soon."
Bobby P.,"Wichita, KS",5,70,6,5.0,6/10/2017,"I am going to call it. As of right now and the hundreds of restaurants I have visited since I moved to Wichita, this is the best place to get ribs. Last night I couldn't believe how great they were. Although I am a big supporter of local businesses, this franchise powerhouse sells the best ribs in Wichita hands down. My journey of rib searching is over."
Taylor B.,"Pagosa Springs, CO",0,42,,5.0,9/30/2017,"This place is amazing. I love the pepperoni extreme pizza, but the real best thing are the Pizookies. The triple chocolate pizookies are my absolute favorite food. They are the best thing I have ever tasted. I seriously recommend them to anyone who loves chocolate and has a major sweet tooth."
Lan N.,"Wichita, KS",42,687,51,4.0,7/7/2016,"I came here for the unlimited soup and salad deal.  My go to tomato soup place stopped selling, and my husband brought home tomato soup from here that the employee said was the best in ICT.  Not exactly unbiased, but it was the closest that I would find to what I had at Bella Luna (Why, Bella Luna?!  WHY?!!)  Aside from the tomato, I tried the clam chowder, and chili.  Everything was good, and of course, the tomato was my favorite.  From all the salads, my favorite was the caprese.   It was a great experience, and I would def return to try the rest of the menu."
Tom B.,"Tempe, AZ",12,141,263,4.0,1/20/2017,"Big chain type restraunt, but great menue with quality options.  Their brews are pretty good too! Try the buff. chicken pizza...Spot on!"
Megan P.,"League City, TX",463,278,2233,2.0,5/15/2016,Our server - was flat out rude and not attentive. When the manager came to ask about the meal we proceed to inform him about our server and he was expressly defensive and made the whole experience more uncomfortable. Our meal would have been better had Luden  not coming over and talking to us.  I will not be back ever again. Kristina was our server was extremely rude the food was less than par this time and I will not go back.
Mark O.,"Leawood, KS",4,268,86,5.0,12/14/2016,Loved it.  Harley was our waitress and she was awesome.   I had the ribs and they were good.  My friend had the Tai and it was also good.   Good vibes.... Good beer
Chelsi U.,"Ladson, SC",159,224,410,4.0,6/9/2016,"The food was pretty good here. I had the balsamic chicken, which was not too bad. The only thing is they put a LOT of balsamic on the chicken. It was tasty until I wanted to eat the salad. We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, which was delicious!  The waiter (whose name has slipped my mind, unfortunately), recommended the cucumber jalapeño margarita and it was really good as well. The waiter was fast and the service was overall good."
Sarah J.,"Wichita, KS",156,11,,5.0,7/9/2017,Their extensive menu is perfect for indecisive people or large groups! They also have a nice patio for sunny days and heaters for chilly nights.
Jay W.,"Wichita, KS",0,9,,3.0,6/12/2017,"I go to BJ's all the time, but last night I was very dissatisfied with how they ""fixed"" my wing order.  They brought me the wrong sauce on the wings and instead of re making my order the must have just tried to remove it and put on the right sauce and a lot of it to try to cover up the taste of the sauce they put on first.  This is not what I expect from them and will not be going back for a while.  I have never had this type of service from them, and I am part of their rewards program, I feel they don't value their loyal customers any more.  Very sad."
Kellie L.,"Wichita, KS",49,12,6,2.0,6/7/2017,"BJ's has definitely not won me over. On my recent visit, I ordered a French dip sandwich. It was basically inedible due to the amount of fat in the meat. What wasn't fatty was bloody. Nope! Our waiter was less than attentive...we saw him twice during the whole meal. You would be better served to spend your food dollars elsewhere."
Shelby M.,"Overland Park, KS",39,12,2,4.0,6/4/2017,"Driving through Wichita on our way home and had to stop here, we love the one in OKC. We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken but it seemed like forever before our waiter took our order. I decided on the mini buffalo chicken pizza with a caesar salad to start. The salad was pretty good and the rest of my family enjoyed their salads. The buffalo on the pizza was way too spicy in my opinion and that might just be a preference thing. The garlic knots my sister ordered are to die for. We ended with ordering the trio pizookies and they were amazing!! Definitely recommend getting the monkey bread one. Never had a bad experience at BJ's and this time was no different!"
Douglas D.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,52,3,2.0,11/30/2016,A very non motivated waiter named Pedro.    Don't think he really liked his job!    No interaction with his customers and didn't seem to be into the whole service industry!    Seems I always try to like BJs but always get the worse wait person  Maybe more training would help?
Bill J.,"Wichita, KS",1,29,,3.0,2/25/2017,"First time at this place and I had a pretty short wait. But the service was weird. The server was really nice!! But the service wasn't do great. Our server refilled our cup and I've only seen him a few times. The food was decent, nothing too crazy about it. I would say the place is average. The environment was really cool, it's a fancy yet casual place for you to have a nice meal. I can see myself coming back, but it's something I'll never be too crazy about. But overall 3/5. Good, aight but not spectacular."
Jon K.,"Wichita, KS",157,74,2,2.0,6/8/2016,"I've been to this place twice and that was it, never in my life where I left a restaurant dissatisfied until I came to BJ's. The place is over rated and I left the place hungry still."
Patrick O.,"Wichita, KS",25,5,,3.0,2/24/2017,"This was my first time here...service was decent, food was mediocre. I'd heard good things about this restaurant so was a little disappointed. To be fair, I did not sample any beer which is really their niche."
Nathan P.,"Derby, KS",2,42,9,5.0,1/16/2017,"We went here for a family gathering A couple weeks before Christmas. There is a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant, it seems well laid out, and decorated nicely. Out of everyone at our table all of the food looked absolutely delicious, and everyone was very happy with their meals. I would highly recommend this restaurant"
Eric C.,"Miami, FL",37,20,59,4.0,9/2/2015,"The food was not bad. I had the chicken lettuce wraps. It was satisfying. Good professional atmosphere, I felt welcomed. Bartender Jason was nice gave me tips on things to do while in witchita or nearby areas.  I would definitely return for another solid meal."
David S.,"Milwaukee, WI",57,182,37,2.0,6/24/2015,"Meh. This is place feels like a 'chain' brew house, like pf-chang's was a brew house and these sprouted up next to malls everywhere with there same 6 'brews' under different names that the locals liked the best.  Don't get me wrong. I went and the staff and bartenders were nice and good at there jobs, but I guess I just expect a step above when people love to make awesome craft beers, that food level is there too.  This all just seemed too commercialized."
Cory N.,"Wichita, KS",235,72,98,4.0,2/24/2016,I'm never let down coming to BJs. They have a good selection of craft beer and everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good. The pizza is great and their burgers are enormous. I dig the upscale brewery atmosphere and the service is consistently good. Overall a great place to grab beer and quality food.
Hover K.,"Rolla, MO",0,5,,4.0,4/23/2017,"A bit pricey, but I've never gone away unsatisfied. Good and friendly service. Tasty entries. I do wish they could bottle their beers for take out."
Bill L.,"Wichita, KS",27,123,32,3.0,3/17/2015,Good food...a little pricey. Very noisy. I did like the text me feature they offered while you wait for your table.
Ashleigh B.,"Carrollton, TX",455,326,114,5.0,10/7/2015,Stopped here otw to Kansas from Texas for a quick meal and brew. Jeremiah red is always my fav. Always great! Also had a Margherita flat bread. All for $7. Will definitely be coming back to a location near home.
Michael F.,"Mojave, CA",55,10,39,4.0,12/11/2014,BJ's is a great place for food and just a great time in general. Beers are their brew and they have something for everyone.  Check out their pizzas and incredible salads.  Everyone loves a pazookie for dessert or maybe an after dinner drink from their full bar.  They actually make their own ROOTBEER as well!!
T H.,"Wichita, KS",60,105,158,3.0,7/23/2016,"Nice atmosphere, especially if you want to watch a sports game. Food is average but the Pazookie dessert is to die for, worth it. 3.5 stars"
Jake J.,"Wichita, KS",1,44,33,2.0,6/16/2016,Place is too big for no reason the servers are young and irresponsible. They don't seem that they really care about the business or about their guests.  Management. Pay close attention.
Ganganath K.,"Wichita, KS",41,61,96,4.0,9/3/2015,Clean restaurant with friendly staff. Had the chargrilled Mahi Mahi tacos. Not the best fish tacos I had but I liked it. Like the environment here.
Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206,4.0,1/15/2013,"It's not as if BJ's doesn't exist in other parts of the country. It's not as if BJ's dishes out peculiar hamburgers stacked with horseradish, fontina cheese and pancetta. It's not as if equally huge pizzas cannot be purchased at that chain delivery service next to your house. So if BJ's is superficially normal...and just A-OK, then why proclaim fandom?  1) Because this is Kansas, which means acquiring Ahi Poke anywhere would be a feat. Poke, as Hawaii taught me, ought to be cubed, sauced and (if going for fancy) stacked atop some sort of avocado. Even if the Poke is probably frozen, it still tastes like raw tuna, and is NOT accompanied by stomach turns. (The fried wonton chips are a little weird, but that's just a matter of preference.) 2) Pizzokies - or however they're spelled - are infinitely mouthwateringly scrumptious. If a cookie is baked in a pan, has a gooey center and crisp edges, and you don't like this sort of glucose abomination then there's something terribly wrong with you. Topping said cookie (the red velvet rules like Cider House) with a scoop of ice cream that quicky melts over and under the baked good adds a creamy richness only adding to the glorious insulin rush, to be cured by the drop in blood sugar caused by #3... 3) Monday All Day Drink Specials. Those $5 Mojitos and Martinis will get you buzzed like a fly...and unlike most chain restaurants, there's nothing cloying and hangover inducing about these light-on-the-simple-syrup, heavy-on-the-actual-ingredients drinks - case in point, you can actually taste the essence of the muddled mint in the regular mojito. They're delicious, though slightly girly, and are worth every dollar."
Vlad I.,"Chicago, IL",241,98,346,5.0,7/21/2014,"This is the one of the best brewery i've ever been in a long time . BJ's in Wichita,KS. Wowww what s place. They are offering over 12 local beers that they are crafting . I had a pleasure to have Harvest Hefeweizen ( wheat beer ) and Oasis (amber) and they are both freaking awesome! Food wise,there is so much stuff to order,i mean like everything,you name it they have it. I started w caesar salad. And let me tell you something....that salat was super-duper FRESH.You can tell when lettuce came this morning from the store not fridge .  They have a lot of pizza's to chose from,so i went with Mortadella/Mushrooms deep dish pizza . It was ok,not saying it was bad or nothing like that....but i live in Chicago (pizza town) so can't beat that. On the other side like a sad,this place is ROCKING!!! P.S. Ananda is a really knowledgable bartender  5 starssss all the way"
Josh C.,"Swansea, IL",0,25,1,3.0,7/16/2016,"Meeh, it was ok.  The food was not impressing but the beer on the other hand was pretty good.  If you want somewhere to go to get a beer and bar food.  This is a good spot.  If you are looking for some fine dining.  Not your place."
Caitlyn S.,"San Antonio, TX",178,367,158,2.0,5/13/2014,"Oh BJ's. I don't even know where to start with this review. Which is how I feel every time I open up your menu. The options are endless. I mean, really. The menu is like, 36 pages. Now, that does mean that there is plenty of variety, and if you go with a large crowd there is sure to be something for everyone. That also means that there are plenty of vegetarian options, which always makes me like a restaurant just a little more. But it definitely does NOT appeal to my indecisive nature, or help with the nasty little habit I have of picking option B when I should always, always go with option A. Anyway, I don't think I've ever had anything bad here, so there's that.  But in order to save you the time and trouble to read a lengthy review (you'll need that time and energy to get through the menu), I'm going to make this short: Service is terrible and the prices are way too high. I'd prefer to spend my money at local places."
Alexis R.,"Liberty, MO",428,589,695,4.0,8/5/2012,"While BJ's just opened about 2 weeks ago, they seem to have ironed out most of the issues that plagued this chain micro-brew in the early weeks.  We went for lunch in the first week and our meal took over an hour with slow service and kitchen staff.  Our order arrived incorrect with regular crust instead of whole wheat on our lunch-pizza specials ($7).  We didn't want to wait another hour so we just took what  we got.   The beers at lunch are $3.50 and while the IPA was quite muddy and lacking the typical crispness, the pale ale was pleasing. Returned for Happy Hour later in the week - 1/2 mini pizzas and -$1 off beers.  Thankfully they allowed us to get the specials in the main dining area.  There was nothing posted about HH only in the bar and we were a  bit confused when our server had to consult the manager to get us the deals in the dining room.  Anyways, it worked out and we enjoyed mini pizzas (usually ~10$) along with $3 dinner salads.  Not a lot of food for the price but the swanky inside, rich wood accents and extensive bar menu are a welcome addition. The Nit Wit wheat was a nice, citrusy, summer beer but my favorite was the Raspberry Cider!  Not too sweet, perfect crisp finish- definitely liked it."
K D.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,3,1,2.0,6/7/2016,"The Ahi salad is consistently really good, and the beers are good (I always get Oasis). Today I had the chicken avocado club for lunch. The bacon was way undercooked, the bread was all soggy from the garlic butter they try to put on it. It would have been better with just traditional toast like I expected. Nobody wants garlic butter on a avocado club sandwich.  Server never asked how the food was, and clearly didn't give a hoot. Really not much going on here, wish I would have gone to OC or Bubbas."
