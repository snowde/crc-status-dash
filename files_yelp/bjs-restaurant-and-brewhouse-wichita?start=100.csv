H B.,"Wichita, KS",1,6,4,4.0,11/19/2012,"Came here during the off lunch hour and loved it. My friend and I ordered the shrimp lettuce wrap for appetizer and it was delicious. The Santa Fe salad and the Salmon teriyaki were suited for the taste. Also, loved the apple berry crumble that we ordered for dessert. It wasn't too sweet, although a little runny/watery, so it dripped like crazy when my friend and I took a few spoonfuls.  Overall the food was good, and the local stout wasn't too bad, but next time, I'm just going to stick to Guinness instead. The service was good, to the point of too attentive. The server stopped by every few minutes. It was understandable since we were one of the only two tables occupied at the time. Liked the experience and will definitely go again to try more of their beers on tap."
Jillian B.,"Denver, CO",2,79,48,2.0,8/15/2012,"I went for lunch a couple weeks after they opened. What a disaster! We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, and the first table our hostess took us to had just been sat with another party. After arguing with a different hostess, we were taken back up to the front and had to wait another 5 minutes while they cleared a different table. Service was extremely slow. It easily took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. (And that was just iced tea- not anything from the bar) It took about an hour from the time we sat down until we finished our food. It felt like we were there forever. The pizza I had was tasty, but nothing special. I don't think the food is worth the price. I think I'll be willing to go back in a couple months once their staff is all trained and have things under control."
Cody H.,"Wichita, KS",0,8,,5.0,1/29/2013,"We hardly get to the East side of Wichita, but when we do we try grab a bite to eat at BJ's.  The beer is great and the food was really good."
Michael B.,"Mundelein, IL",37,11,1,4.0,2/5/2014,"In Wichita on business.  Good food, and a good fresh beer for a chain (didn't know it was a chain).  Tried the Porter and Chef salad at the bar one night, and came back the next for dinner as well. Did not disappoint."
Chris M.,"Tonganoxie, KS",0,7,,1.0,1/8/2014,"The appetizer plate had food on it from the previous diner as did the drinking glass. I ordered enlightened chicken tacos for lunch. The place was half-full and they took 20 minutes and they came out cold and are actually taquitos. That must be the ""enlightened"" as in light on size, but nowhere was that stated. I didn't send them back for being cold because the server never returned. Not impressed."
