Jasmine E.,"Plano, TX",163,124,113,4.0,6/28/2015,Food was great!!! Our server Brad was a little on the slower side. He would come back and ask questions he already asked or forget to bring things to the table. He could've been new perhaps. The food was great! First time there & I enjoyed the food!!! My drink was almost as much as my dinner though
Dayna C.,"Wichita, KS",10,18,1,2.0,3/27/2016,"The service was slow and the food disappointing, Friday night dinner with the girls.  My steak was cold and dry and the roasted brussel sprouts were cold and looked like they had been sitting around for awhile. I've been here for lunch and had a better experience."
Vynetta R.,"Honolulu, HI",198,98,45,2.0,10/3/2012,"This restaurant location could use some serious help in customer service skills, wait times, kitchen help and over vibes. The front door guest was a bit rude. The hostess told us it would be a 30mun wait and the restaurant had maybe 25 people in it. My group of 5 bothered by that. Why make us wait when there are so many open tables. The wait time to order took over 35 min :( there was hair in one of our meals. They cooks did not prepare a new meal they just took the hair out and gave the plate back to us. They didn't offer for that meal to be free. Bad service here and they need serious training help.  The food overall was good. Too pricey for small serving."
Bill S.,"Wichita, KS",389,154,3,2.0,5/7/2014,"The food is OKAY at best The beer is good, but not worth waiting an hour for Last trip our waiter was HORRIBLE -- be brought out dinners out before the salads or the appetizer. I can't say that I would drive across town for it again"
Jennifer A.,"Grove, OK",3,31,80,5.0,6/20/2015,"Everything we ordered was amazing. We had the chicken lettuce wraps, chicken fried chicken, chicken Alfredo, jalapeño burger and Parmesan crusted chicken and of course the trio cookies with vanilla bean ice cream. So delicious!!! Service was great and atmosphere too."
Astha T.,"Queens, NY",61,105,6,4.0,12/9/2014,**this review is for happy hour only** Came here for a quick drink after some shopping! They brew their own beer and There was like 100 beer on tap but i wasn't in mood for a beer so got a lemon drop which was in happy hour! my bf got few beer for himself and he was very happy with their taste! My lemon drop was nothing special but i recommend this place for anybody who loves beer!  p.s they also got food in their happy hour menu! take advantage of it!
Lillia L.,"Enola, PA",122,138,76,1.0,11/6/2014,"Disappointing. For all the pages and pages of grand descriptions of food, and pictures of fresh appetizing looking plates, this place was a letdown. I ordered the avocado egg rolls which were pictured with fresh green avocados; the actual appetizer was brown mashed avocado purée. I also ordered a Kale and Brussels Sprout Salad. I found no kale in this pile of romaine and dressing. There were some hard little Brussels sprouts and plenty of berries. When I asked the server if they were out of kale she went to ask. The cooks response was ""it's baby kale so you won't see it."" Really? Is it prenatal??? The manager stopped by and his explanation was even better. ""The kale and Brussels sprouts are meant as a garnish. It's a romaine salad."" Oh-kay then.  I think I can find someplace else to eat. To be fair, he did take the salad off my bill."
Becky S.,"Wichita, KS",80,75,91,3.0,2/12/2015,The huge restaurant has plenty of room for big groups who like a classy-er sports bar type of place. The restaurant itself is impressive and the beer/drink list is extensive. Each beer with the exception of the piranha had been good. The pizza is another highlight of BJ's unfortunately the rest of the menu falls short. I haven't had anything outside of the beer and pizza that makes me want to pick this restaurant over another in the same area. Overall a good place to grab a few drinks/pizza or have a large group meet but nothing that you couldn't get somewhere else.
Cherie H.,"Derby, KS",2,26,,5.0,2/19/2016,Tried the Asian chopped salad with chicken for lunch.  Is a delicious lite lunch entree for only a little over 500 calories and 45 GM's of protein.  Great choice
Frank M.,"Wichita, KS",0,7,,1.0,12/1/2015,Who ever heard of spicy chicken fried steak..... Done with this place. Check your tab for the special alcohol tax line. An added ripoff. I stopped to bitch about that and the help were clueless.
Heather M.,"Liberty, MO",56,5,,3.0,2/24/2016,"Just ok. Service was fine, food was okay, atmosphere was generic. Menu was Cheesecake Factory - esque."
Amy D.,"Wichita, KS",20,90,37,3.0,12/29/2014,"The food was fair. Service was decent. My friend got the southern fried chicken, and it looked better than my fish tacos. I ordered off the fit menu. If I go again, I will try something else."
Lacey C.,"Wichita, KS",0,3,,5.0,4/1/2017,"our server was really on top of things, and he was very friendly, and got our dessert out right on time. the pazookie is absolutely to die for."
Dusty A.,"Wichita, KS",0,11,,5.0,2/29/2016,"Love the new ham and cheese sandwich. The Brussels sprouts were to die for. Even if you don't like brussels sprouts you should try them. Great service, nice atmosphere. Big tv's. You can get in and out quick or set and linger for a while they don't care"
Jacob C.,"Wichita, KS",41,39,7,2.0,10/19/2015,"The food was severely lacking in flavor. The advertised lower sodium across the entire menu certainly had its effects on the food. The burger I got was dry, portions small all around, and generally overpriced. We've begun calling it ""BJ's badhouse"" whenever we pass by it on our way to better dining options."
Kevin M.,"Denver, CO",0,19,1,5.0,5/17/2015,"My friend was all loaded (""drunk"") and threw up on... 1) a family 2) some waitress 3) a small child They were very accommodating and we didn't get kicked out.  Five. Stars. Seriously tho, they hosted our whole rugby team and we had a great dinner."
Alisa S.,"Wichita, KS",80,185,247,4.0,5/13/2014,"My favorite dish to order here is the Jambalaya. The portion is large enough for me to just eat half and save the rest for later. It has a lot of flavor and is actually pretty spicy. My fiance had the Grilled Pork chops and he said he didn't like that as much. But, one of our friends had the Southern Fried Chicken which is probably what we will end up ordering next time instead of the pork chops. As for appetizers, I've had the Ahi Poke , and while it looked pretty, I thought the flavor was lacking a bit. The Calamari has nice breading on it. The Potato Skins are my favorite appetizer."
Christopher M.,"Beloit, KS",9,19,2,4.0,11/17/2015,The Brewhouse Burger was great and cheap! The toasted parm made it! Great atmosphere! Will go again.
Jolene T.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,,4.0,6/14/2015,Great place to eat and just have a good drink! Enjoyed there half price appetizers after 10pm! Service could be better though!
Mike C.,"Kapolei, HI",0,16,3,4.0,11/9/2015,Very good food  I had the California Chicken Club ! Tasty . Their own beers are good also. Had the sampler 4 5oz beers good deal for the $$! Bartender was very pleasant and helpful.
