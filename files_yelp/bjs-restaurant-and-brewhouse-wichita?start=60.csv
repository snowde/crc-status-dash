Nicole C.,"Wichita, KS",109,27,3,5.0,6/23/2015,"BJ's Brewhouse is great every time I visit! Such a massive menu (which is intimidating at time) but one will almost always have the option of trying something new. The food, drinks, and service are all excellent!"
Mary P.,"Wichita, KS",0,3,,5.0,11/6/2015,"Just finished lunch with my husband,   I had the roasted salmon and quinoa.  It was delicious and the service was superb.  I know we're going next time we are on this side of town."
Andrew S.,"Beale AFB, CA",7,10,,5.0,7/5/2015,The service was good and food tasted great. We even ordered food to go for after the meal and was spot on when we were ready to go. The root beer was amazing and had a large selection of beer.
Brad S.,"Wichita, KS",357,1386,637,3.0,9/25/2013,"Fine. You win, BJ's. For a year I've avoided checking out the giant structure on the corner of two of the busiest streets in town, partially due to the reports of bad service (brought on by the gobsmackingly large number of people who crowd the place) and partially on account of my personal policy against reviewing chains whenever practical. But it was Saturday dinner time and I was looking for something substantial after dodging crowds in the mall, so there went that. For a ""brewhouse"" (they start brewing the beer in a central facility and send it to the restaurant to be finished), the beer was average. Of the four I sampled, three (Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, and P.M. Porter) were pretty harsh from the alcohol content. Why does a red or porter need to be brewed to 7.3 and 6.4% ABV, respectively? Take it down a notch, guys. The fourth, Tatonka Russian imperial stout, made use of its high alcohol content, but the roasty chocolate-y flavors weren't as developed as they could have been. I guess it's neat they brew so many styles you wouldn't normally find at a place like this, such as a Grand Cru or an Oktoberfest. ""We cook our burgers here to well done. Is that okay?"" No, it is most certainly NOT okay, bartender, but she didn't bat an eye when I requested it be backed down to medium, so I guess they're used to it. I appreciated the warning.  I was happy to see my request actually caused the cook to err on the side of being underdone - there was still a good bit of pink left in my burger, as well as some moisture. As a result, the Crispy Jalapeno Burger had some cruft when considering the fried jalapenos, baja sauce, chipotle mayonnaise, and pepper jack cheese, but it was otherwise not bad. It could have been a lot worse.  There are different levels of chains, and though all of them have the same end goal in mind - a consistent product that can be produced within an acceptable level of time and - the atmosphere and research and development changes objectives: McDonalds want to supply decent burgers at the fastest speed and cheapest price ($2); Red Robin offers large burgers gussied up with crazy condiments and fried toppings ($12); Ruth's Chris sells you a high end experience and a burger that's been made fresh from all the other beef sitting in the back ($20). Cheesecake Factory and BJ's fall somewhere above Red Robin, but below Ruth's Chris. Once you get to those higher tiers, however, you're balancing quality of food with experience. You want to leave customers ecstatic once they walk out the doors. This is accomplished through thousand-calorie entrees of gut-busting proportions, plenty of high-alcohol drinks to get them sufficiently sozzled, and cap it off with a giant ice cream-covered chocolate chip pizza that has people remembering it for the rest of their day and come back next weekend. No, there's nothing wrong with this chain's kind of food, but the dubious nutritional value, soulless environment, and below-average beer doesn't make me eager to return."
Shelly D.,"Lincoln, NE",0,61,9,5.0,8/20/2015,"Hubby and I go regularly. He loves the choice of brews, I love the appetizer selection. We always get seated pretty quick, and the server comes pronto. Never wait too long for food, even in a large group. Now for the food. I love the pizza. Any type you get is awesome. I esp like the cracker crust type appetizers. Good small meal, and I usually take some home too. I seldom get a big meal there b/c it is just too much food. Recently I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was delish. Yes, leftovers went home. 2 nice sized breast pieces cooked to perfection with fresh sundried tomatoes, and basil over the top, sprinkled with parm cheese, mashed potatoes, and done/crisp broccoli. Hubby got the roast beef dip sandwich. Huge sandwich, loaded with beef, and came with gravy and horseradish dip, he really liked. Also a side of seasoned steak fries. We are never unhappy with the food. Since it is a big place, at times it can be loud. There is really no quiet place we have found."
Ryan B.,"Saukville, WI",0,18,,2.0,6/19/2015,"If you like paying 30 dollars for a single person to eat for a beer and pasta meal which is on par with Olive Garden quality, then this is the place for you! (This is another chain where you're paying out the rear for fantastical menu descriptions and the fact that they have a large beer selection, which is great but to try more than a couple you'll be spending as much as you would on a litre bottle of very high end liquor from the store)"
James T.,"Kansas City, MO",8,66,28,4.0,4/25/2014,"I was in town for a conference.  I ordered a salad with salmon.  The salmon was very tasty and not over cooked.  I also ordered a Crispin hard cider made from Honeycrisp  apples.  I had never had it before, but it was really good.  It was brought out in the bottle with a frosted glass.  Be prepared to say no when they ask you the obligatory question of joining their rewards program."
Pat M.,"Andover, KS",1,16,3,5.0,5/23/2015,"I'd take a picture of what we ordered, but it is all gone. We think these are some of the best wings in Wichita if you like them crispy and with a nice buffalo sauce. French dip sandwich was also a score. My husband, who considers his own rib recipe among the best, said the ribs were like his. That is about the best compliment he can give. My 12-year old said he wasn't very hungry when we sat down, but he powered through his flat bread pizza, ate all my French fries, and eyed the ribs too. I like the Jeremiah red ale, Van liked the stout. We've been here a few times and it hasn't disappointed yet."
Tony H.,"Wichita, KS",129,18,,3.0,9/25/2013,Ate at a BJ's in Denver and San Diego and loved it. Been to this one in Wichita a few times and this is what I've noticed: front of house staff is consistently rude and service inside the restaurant is generally slow although friendlier.  The food and drinks are consistently good.
Brittany P.,"Kansas City, MO",30,17,2,4.0,1/21/2015,"From out of town and hadn't been to a BJs in awhile. Mojitos were good, wine was not. The fried artichoke appetizer was really good. Had the the Mediterranean pizza and it really sucked and was dissapointed. Service was ok and had some pretty good specials, it was really dead in the restaurant."
Nicholas K.,"Wichita, KS",4,103,17,5.0,11/17/2014,"Really nice atmosphere, and great food and drinks. I had a sampler platter of their beer. It is made at their brewery in Texas and shipped here. All four were good, and the price was good for the beer. I had the Mahi-Mahi fish tacos, i got them grilled instead of fried. They were very good, and under ten dollars. I also add the corn fritters as an app, and those were amazing with some bacon and their sauce on the plate as well. Those were 3.25, so a great deal there as well."
Ryan S.,"Spokane, WA",113,250,40,4.0,7/21/2013,"Great service, as always. First time at this BJ's, but didn't matter. Same great service, same great food, same bat channel. Their Hef beer is awesome as well. Had their chicken nachos appetizer and shrimp tacos. Gave me a smile for hours."
Doyle C.,"Lawrence, KS",40,25,13,4.0,12/20/2014,Pretty good. Got the brew house burger.  Very good. We've cut fries very good. Andes of course their beers are awesome!!!
Ryan G.,"Wichita, KS",239,241,72,2.0,6/9/2014,"This place makes a Cheesecake Factory look like a tin shack. Over sized and overpriced. For lunch my colleague and I each had soup and shared the tacos (1 each). Total? $30 before gratuity. Maybe it was the $3 ice teas but $15/person for soup and a taco is ridiculous, especially when I found everything to be bland. On a plus note our server was very nice and well trained and took great care of us, like when we sent back one of the soups for being ice cold. In summary, if you like HUGE chain restaurants with bland food and ridiculous pricing at the busiest intersection in Wichita...BJ's is for you."
Keri P.,"Lawrence, KS",30,10,,4.0,6/6/2014,"We have eaten at BJ's several times and have always found it enjoyable. I am working with a dairy and soy allergy now, and they were extremely accommodating. I placed my order based on the allergen menu, but they notified me that they actually used a soybean oil in the kitchen. They took special effort to make sure the burger was replated just to ensure no contact with the oil. Great and helpful experience!"
Dave S.,"Denver, CO",75,153,1,4.0,5/5/2013,BJ's is a pretty good place to get a bite to eat. Their flatbreads pizzas are awesome and if you go there for happy hours their flatbreads and personal pizzas are half price. The drinks are over priced though in my opinion. A Jack and Coke cost me $7.50 a piece which is retarded.  I ordered a flight of beer so i tried most of what they brew and their beer is pretty decent. It's defiantly got a cool atmosphere and  is worth checking out.
Lisa N.,"Wichita, KS",122,26,4,4.0,9/23/2012,"I've loved BJs when I was living in California.  My favorite deep dish pizza place. So I was very very excited for it to open in Wichita right across the street from me (added bonus).   It gets busy since we came in the first month it opened, so make reservations. but hopefully the crowd dies down.  I always order the avocado spring rolls.  They are fried avocado creamyness.  And we always order the pizza.  Usually BJ's cooks theirs until their crust was crispy and the innerds were hot and soft.  But this BJ's made their crust and innerds just plain soft. No crispyness that I long for.  They also didn't put enough tomato sauce.  It was alright, I needed to eat.   I love their cider and their homemade cola. Im not a beer fan so I didn't try out the beer.  I signed up for their membership, because I think i'll be frequenting their establishment  in the future. And i'll have their pizza hopefully it was just that day.  Next time ill have to try their ahi poke.  I love me some poke."
Jordan G.,"Pearland, TX",1,19,,4.0,1/25/2015,"Great food, great atmosphere! The restaurant is very popular on the weekends so be prepared to wait for a table. Because it gets so crowded the service can get a little slow, but once the food comes you forget about that. The fish tacos and avocado egg rolls are both amazing!"
Nathan E.,"Falls Church, VA",46,207,3,4.0,1/16/2013,"For a chain brewery the beer is actually really good. The Pirahna Pale Ale was a solid one, and the Hopstorm is a decent IPA as well. I look forward to coming back and trying the rest of their brews. Other important things though: lots of TV's to watch sports on whether you're at the bar or in restaurant seating. It's extremely spacious, and while not the most interesting decor it is adequate. The food is good. I had the pork chop which was extremely tasty, albeit a bit small. A friend of mine loves one of their cocktails (root beer, Jameson and Bailey's and some other stuff we can't remember). Overall, a very fine choice for dinner with friends or your family."
Rachael H.,"Austin, TX",107,3,,4.0,3/1/2014,"My boyfriend and I are on a road trip from Minneapolis, MN to Austin, TX and last night Wichita was our halfway point. We were road weary and hungry and this place seemed like our best option. We were expecting to have to drop a lot of cash for mediocre food and gimmicky service (we usually avoid big chains like this), but we were pleasantly surprised.  Our server was Kayleigh and she was great. She was friendly, timed things well, and attentive without making us feel pressured in the way that can be common (and uncomfortable) in chains places. For dinner, we got a turkey burger and the Hawaiian mahi mahi. For $12.95, my expectations for the fish were low, but it was beautifully presented and very good. So many places would charge twice as much for something that tasted frozen, and I really appreciated that it was so much better than that--a nice, healthy, reasonably-portioned and fresh-tasting meal after a long day in the car. I also appreciated that even though it was busy, we were in and out quickly (but without feeling rushed). Also, the piranha pale ale was tasty. For two meals, a tomato and mozzarella salad, and two beers, the bill was $37! Awesome. Thanks, BJs, for not selling out like other chains, and not ripping people off. That's cool of you. And thanks again, Kayleigh! Also: I hope the owners and management treat the staff well, because that's the most important thing."
