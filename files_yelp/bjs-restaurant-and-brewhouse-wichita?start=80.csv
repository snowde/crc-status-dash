Mark W.,"Owasso, OK",4,6,3,4.0,6/28/2014,"Two straight afternoons here for a baseball tournament, my 17 yr old loves the pizza and I love the wings, and the blonde beer."
Jacob H.,"Wichita, KS",0,11,5,3.0,8/14/2014,"We eat here often because of the 'cheesecake factory-esque' nature of the menu. So many options. When you get a good server it's always a great meal, but every so often they decide to let a real dud wait tables and it's nearly infuriating. There are nights I'd give it 4-5 stars and nights I'd give it one (and the food is never a factor it's always the service). Great food and great variety, I definitely recommend the Carry out option."
Casey S.,"Woodstock, GA",194,46,5,4.0,4/16/2014,"Avocado egg rolls were decent, the SW egg rolls were really good, the Jalepeno burger was very good (especially on sour dough bread) and the Oasis Ale was a pretty solid beer. I enjoyed the atmosphere, beer selection, and TVs. The only negative was that they couldn't figure out how to get the MLB package to work, so I left after 1 beer. It's definitely worth checking out."
Sara W.,"Wichita, KS",6,46,1,2.0,11/19/2012,"Totally disappointed with my experience and food :(  We took our family out for Sunday dinner and $80.00 later (without adding in the tip - and no, none of us had any alcohol) we (4 people and a child) left feeling like a burden to our waitress and very unsatisfied with the food.  My daughters had a small sirloin steak (way too over done) - they had to scrape off the char. Because of the time it took to get our food they did not want to wait on getting another. My husband and I had a bacon cheeseburger - no flavor, and the bun was soggy and falling apart. We had to flag down our waitress to ask EACH time we wanted a refill, despite our her walking by our table deliberately ignoring us?? It seemed so. The food was mediocre at best and the service was just as bad. Probably will not be back. WAY TO OVERPRICED for what you get. Take your business to Chili's or Applebees, you will be money ahead."
Mary C.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,,1.0,12/19/2012,"I came here a few weeks ago with some friends. This place was definitely not worth the long wait. I called in 30 mins early to place a reservation and when we got there, we still had to wait another hour.  After getting seated we waited some more before ordering and all our food came out cold. My friend had ordered pasta and she barely touched it because it was hard and bland. I ordered the hawaiian mahi-mahi. The portion was incredibly small and expensive. Totally not worth it. My other friend ordered the classic burger and the burger was hard and yet again cold. Even the fries were cold. We decided not to complain since we didn't have the time to wait. The service was not even that great. They didn't care too much about us and just passed by even when we were ready for our ticket and needed refills. Overall, we won't be coming back unless they change for the better."
Snappy B.,"Stephenville, TX",0,51,1,2.0,6/13/2015,"Food was actually pretty good, but service is never very good at these. On this particular occasion, we had a big group (9). Tried to keep my expectations realistic, but it was obvious the server had too many tables to do a good job."
Ryan Z.,"Wichita, KS",12,2,4,3.0,9/11/2012,I've been going to BJ's in other cities for several years.  I have been to the Wichita location five times since it has opened.  I love the concept but the Wichita location just doesn't have the food down yet.  Service has been mixed too.  The waitstaff is always friendly yet it is also almost always slow and on two occasions my order has been wrong. I actually prefer Old Chicago's pizza but the atmosphere at BJ's is more polished - and the rest of the food at BJ's is superior to OC.  Other people have remarked about prices - I think their prices are pretty competitive.
Taylor G.,"Wichita, KS",24,2,,2.0,9/8/2012,"Been here 3 times now and not impressed. Food is a little over priced, hostesses have been rude last two times, the wait for a seat is long, wait for food is longer, waitresses are slow to check back with you, had no silverware, drinks were empty for 20 minutes, and waitresses forgot to take free dessert off bill.  The atmosphere is very nice, and the food is pretty good."
Robert E.,"Arkansas City, KS",1,32,22,5.0,6/30/2014,"Great food, drinks, and service. Great place for adult get together; friends or a date!"
Makenzi J.,"Wichita, KS",164,24,4,5.0,12/1/2013,You must try this place!! Great beers and pizza!! Love the Thai salmon and the bruschetta appetizer is amazing!
Janet P.,"Wichita, KS",116,63,98,2.0,3/28/2013,"Huge restaurant and menu but my food experience hasn't been so wow. I came with some friends and they ordered a large pizza and I order the angel pasta with shrimp. Food took forever to come out even though it wasn't even busy. They brought my pasta out first 30 minutes later but I sat and waited for their pizza to come out to dine with them. It didn't come out for another 15 minutes and the pizza toppings were all wrong. We sent it back, pasta got colder. Brought back out after another 20 minutes or so and it was still the wrong toppings. We ate it anyways after I had them reheat my pasta. They enjoyed their pizza but my pasta was bland and lacking any flavor whatsoever. It had tomatoes, shrimp, and pasta = $17. Total waste of money :( I've been back two times after that and food was still very mediocre."
Jamie D.,"Springfield, MO",18,19,19,5.0,2/9/2014,"Went here at 6:30 on a Saturday night with my husband. Only waited about 20 min while getting some phenomenal beer at the bar for a table even though they were full! Had a nice upscale feel, but still casual. Our waiter was friendly and helped to recommend something. We tried their gourmet mac and cheese as an appetizer, amazing!!! I had a turkey burger with white cheddar mash and my husband had a bacon cheese burger with fries. The burgers were HUGE! They were juicy, cooked perfectly, and the buns they were on very soft. I am an extremely picky eater and I did not have a single complaint! price was great for the quality and quantity of food. I couldn't believe this was a chain restaurant!"
K. G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",49,98,39,5.0,12/12/2013,"This was a favorite lunch place for my bestie and me.  The atmosphere is casual, and the menu is huge--might take you minute of you've never been there.  I usually go for the never-ending soup and salad.  Creative twists on salads, and the clam chowder is the best I've ever had.  Its a good way to get to know some of the menu.  I've gone at night and its pretty busy on the weekend.  Its great for just relaxing with homemade brews, mixed drinks, and appetizers.  The long island was pretty good.  Overall, a great location."
Kyle M.,"Wichita, KS",15,68,14,3.0,8/5/2012,"The pizza and beer are pretty good but definitely not the best in Wichita, especially for the high prices they charge here.  I think Old Chicago has far better pizza and a great beer selection.  The pizookie is not all that it is cracked up to be, again, Old Chicago has better cookies."
Andrew P.,"Rose Hill, KS",0,1,,5.0,7/29/2012,My wife and I's new favorite restaurant in Wichita.   The pizza was amazing as were  the ribs.  The avacado egg rolls were an excellent start to the meal.  The pizookie was probably the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  You can't go wrong with this place.
Lori S.,"Wichita, KS",109,2,,5.0,7/11/2013,"This is a great place. I love the BJs Brewed Sodas, I tried the Black Cherry Soda, and had the Angel Hair pasta meal. Great place for kids and groups. Wonderful Wait Service. We had Waitress Samantha and she was great! I will go back!"
Janelle E.,"Loudoun County, VA",24,138,10,4.0,10/2/2012,"This place is HUGE, with a beer selection to match!  There were tons of beers, even on tap, to choose from - which made it tough, but is always a good thing. The craft brews were pretty good, but nothing that stood out compared to other crafts.  We started with the calamari which was crispy and tasty, especially with the garlic aioli. I had the half salad/half flatbread combo.  I got the Black and Bleu flatbread with the steak pieces, carmelized onions, roasted red peppers and a little bleu cheese which was DELISH! I paired it with the watermelon salad which was also fantastic.  We decided to splurge and got the triple Pizookie - the red velvet, triple chocolate, and cookies and cream versions - and it was pretty good. Not the best dessert I've ever had, and I probably won't have it again, but it was tasty.  Overall, I liked the place, though I forsee it having the same fate as places like Fox and Hound - strong at first but will eventually die off."
Mike C.,"Fort Sill, OK",159,149,60,2.0,10/1/2012,This place was definitely over hyped to me. The food was decent but it wasn't anything special. I would eat there again but would never make a special trip just to go.
Ken J.,"Wichita, KS",0,1,,4.0,7/5/2013,"I've been to BJs quite a few times, trying out quite a variety of menu items (both to-go and dine in) and all have been quite delicious. Although in recent history, I have discovered a gem of a menu item. Thanks to signing up for the BJs rewards, my wife got an e-mail on her birthday for a free pzzookie (a cookie and ice cream.) While it didn't sound bad, it certainly didn't sound like anything great when we had gone before and didn't want to spend $7 on a dessert, but for free, we figured we'd give it a try. Since then, we'd tried 4 different types, each just as amazing as the last. It's gotten to the point where I can't imagine going to BJs Restaurant without ordering one."
Jaha H.,"Hainesport, NJ",0,5,,2.0,12/5/2012,"went for lunch on a wednesday.  Place was pretty busy at the time.  We were seated quickly.  Initially all seemed well, the waiter was prompt & attentive.  But after taking our order, things went downhill.  He forgot to bring one beer and had to be reminded, and then it was still slow.  Several incorrect orders were mixed up between tables.  Food was just OK, nothing to write home about. I would not go back again with other restaurants nearby. Atmosphere seems nice, plenty of beer selections."
