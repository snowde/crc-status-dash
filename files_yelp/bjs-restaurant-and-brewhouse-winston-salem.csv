Darren D.,"Apex, NC",1,42,,5.0,9/25/2017,"1st - It is not related to BJ's warehouse. This will prevent you from asking what a million other customers, including myself have, and the wait/er/ress giving you the same sigh he/she has given a million times while grunting out a barely discernible ""No."" I kid, She was actually very friendly and answered politely. I don't kid about it not being related to BJ's warehouse. It is not. With that out of the way. Wife and I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2ish. Wait staff and food were great. Selection of beers was fantastic. They also have their own brews which were very tasty. Big fan. Place is huge but not hollow or cold. There plenty of TV's but not all in your face. There are just enough in the right spots for you to watch the game without it being obvious to your significant other. See. I got your back. I am not understanding the bad reviews for this place. I know when I go to a new place, I always go easy on the reviews. I throw out the highs and lows. It's new. There will be hiccups especially in service. You have to show a little latitude. I know everyone is not like me. However, be a human instead of some ""I am paying for a service, I deserve the best service"" robot. Be a decent person. Not a tool.  Anyway, we ordered a couple of deep dish pizzas. The veggies on top were crazy fresh. You know when you order a pizza, they usually throw the veggies on top before cooking. I think they throw them on like the last 5 minutes just to warm them. The peppers and onions had a crisp to them like I ate them right off a grocery store shelf. I would know ;) Now listen, the pizza wasn't like Rosati's Deep Dish in Cary. That place is off the charts good deep dish. And I've been to Chicago so I know. I did not stay in A Holiday Inn though so my credibility may be in the pooper. BJ's is still pretty respectable. Not the same page as Rosati's but same chapter maybe.  Their menu is extensive. If they can carry decent quality across the entire menu, I think they will be ok. The only negative I can find is I felt the pricing was a little on the high side. Not Snoop Dog high, just like 9th grader High School parking lot high. We'll be going back regardless of pricing just to try the other menu items. P.S. Not one BJ joke. I am proud of myself. I could have easily mentioned the sausage on the pizza's creamy dressing on my wife's salad but I did not. Ya me!"
Jeffrey H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,14,,2.0,10/16/2017,"My first visit here for lunch over the weekend. Maybe it is a relatively new site and they will work out the kinks, but overall, the experience was less than favorable because although the food (wings and salad) was very good, the beer flight did not meet expectation (tasted as if they have a CO2 to Beer issue with their taps).  Additionally, the staff didn't appear to care if we patronized their business or not."
Marc P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",63,43,8,4.0,9/20/2017,"Came here to support a local charity which is awesome they do that.  I ordered a steak, which came out obviously rare when I ordered it medium. The cook should have been able to tell. They quickly rectified it and brought out a fresh plate. The salad was fresh and crisp. Drink special was on point for $5.00 for a tall vodka drink. And beer was $4 on tap which are great prices.  Definitely a good meal supporting a local charity.  -1 star for messy bathroom that needed attention, misfire on steak and the 92 health rating."
Jenna T.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",42,25,75,4.0,9/17/2017,"I left BJ's in the best mood. So full, so happy.  This was my first visit and I will be coming back. There are a lot of deals during the week, including discounted pizzookies and loaded burgers, so I would advise going during the week if you want to get the good deals.  I ordered a house burger with avocado and I upgraded to the sweet potato fries; they were an extra two dollars, which I think is silly, so that's my only complaint.  Super good, tasty burger and a good portion. My friend and I also got the pizzookies of course. We were debating between splitting one or each getting one. We made the right decision and we got two. Don't get me wrong, you could split them, but, they are so warm and chewy you probably won't want to share. The service was fantastic, super fast and friendly."
Sarah G.,"Raleigh, NC",70,432,279,2.0,1/25/2017,"My office ordered lunch here today (a to go order). I was not overly excited about the lunch... I have been looking at the menu online for the last week and despite having a pretty vast selection, nothing really jumped out at me. I ended up going with a wedge salad and the chicken tenders and fries. The hard part about reviewing take out is that I'm sure everything is so much better when eating in the restaurant, not sitting in plastic containers getting cold... The chicken tenders themselves were ok. The fries, despite being cold, were ok as well. I liked that they put them in a paper bag instead of in the plastic container which did help preserve the crispness a bit. My order of fries was minuscule though, boo. My wedge salad was good. All my coworkers noticed how watery the dressings were: ranch for the tenders and the blue cheese for the salad. Someone made the comment on maybe they thin it down so much to stretch it.  One girl actually used her own ranch because she didn't care for the watery one. The consensus from everyone is that the food was ""meh"". Our doctor got the buffalo chicken tender grilled cheese and didn't even finish it and gave me his fries. One girl got the southern fried chicken over mashed potatoes and found plastic (cling wrap) in her chicken.  Everyone got a cookie dessert except me... and they all seemed to enjoy that.  All in all, we just didn't enjoy the food enough to even want to come here again. Sorry BJ's. Maybe eating in-house would have been better??? None of us really have the desire to give them another chance."
James A.,"Kernersville, NC",1,42,37,3.0,5/24/2017,"Ate lunch on 5/24/2017.  Interesting look for a  restaurant: high ceiling, numerous beer flags (representing beer types), very well positioned big screen tvs, very nice bar,etc. beer selection was huge! Both of us had the fried boneless chicken breasts, Parmesan mashed potatoes & fire grilled corn and peppers succotash.  Chicken was great!  It had a very nice crispy buttermilk batter, yet tender enough to cut with a fork.  Mashed potatoes were fantastic...rich & creamy.  Succotash was good, but plate needed a little more.  Price ($7.99) was reasonable for the portion.  We enjoyed & would recommend.  Enjoyed!"
Deanna M.,"Clemmons, NC",0,14,12,4.0,11/22/2017,"Great service & choice of brews & food. My choice was unusual, but the other two in my party got a burger & boneless wings. All were cooked to our satisfaction. Waitresses were very friendly & obliging."
Khy G.,"Houston, TX",91,7,4,1.0,10/17/2017,"Came here twice and both time was a disappointment, first time service was slow and even forgotten our drinks. Food came out 35min later. How long does it take to cook a steak med-rare? Worst part was the steak had no seasoning not even salt or pepper!! And the second time they burnt the god damn steak and still taste like shit. I gave them a 2nd chance, guess bj only good in Texas."
Tierra H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",27,14,11,1.0,9/29/2017,TERRIBLE with a capital T . Service and was slow almost nonexistent food was even worse! Will not be back !
Lisa C.,"Charlotte, NC",232,283,410,4.0,5/2/2016,"A sad fact about moving to NC was that I thought I would never have a pizookie again. So when I heard one of my favorite home town chains opened up a mere hour and a half away (compared to a flight back to CA) I had to make the pilgrimage.  One of the advantages of being an adult is that I could now try their beers, though the root beer is delicious if you don't imbibe. Of the flight sample I got I liked the berry cider the best. I was tempted to try one of each since I wasn't old enough to drink when I came here growing up but decided 11am on a Saturday wasn't the right time to throw it back like that even if I wasn't driving. If you come here you have got to try their deep dish pizza. It is a California take on a Chicago classic. A childish habit I never really grew out of was to leave the pizza crust uneaten because after all that cheesy saucy goodness how can plain crust compare? If you fry it of course. I happily eat the pizza crust here. As tempting as it was to add a salad or try an app I did not because the feature of the meal was yet to come. I eagerly ordered the cookies n' cream pizookie and waited an eternity for it. It has probably been seven years since I last had it and every mouthful was worth the drive. The chocolate cookie bottom of the pizookie came out warm and gooy to contrast perfectly with the melting ice-cream on top. I love the oreo whipped cream dollop on top that brings the other two flavors together expertly.  Obviously I am pretty jazzed about this place. The only flaw was that the service was pretty slow (over an hour for lunch). Other yelpers will want to take that into consideration and that the waitress was friendly."
Quijana B.,"Silver Spring, MD",407,478,4018,4.0,4/2/2016,"This is the second time in one week that I've visited a brand new restaurant. This one has the advantage of being a tried and true chain, so the menus are set, the staff has been rigorously trained, and all that has to happen for them to succeed is to open their doors.  I've only visited one other BJ's location. We didn't love it, but it was enough for us to take notice when we saw one while we traveled this week. The space is open and inviting, if a bit loud, and the menu had enough variety to make all of us happy. My boy had been craving steak until he spotted the spaghetti and meatballs. It was a huge amount of pasta and five somewhat under spiced meatballs, and could have easily been shared. The dish was bland until he doctored it up with Parmesan and hot pepper flakes. (Thank you to restaurants that have them on hand!) even better, our excellent waitress (hey, Lolia!) brought us a small dish of roasted garlic chunks. In all honesty, we all dove into that small dish of savory gold, and all of our meals were improved.  I ordered a small salad and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were perfect. Burnt and crispy on the edge and still firm on the inside. The sauce was not overbearing and gave the sprouts a nice bite (improved by the occasional bit of garlic!) and they were just what I've needed after a week of traveling. My husband's seared ahi salad was a riot of flavor. The ahi itself was almost without taste, but he stirred it into the main body of his salad and dealt with the reality that we are far from the ocean in which it made its home. We'd had the same experience with the ahi poke, which desperately needed sesame oil. One day we will learn not to order ahi unless we are in a place that focuses on fish.  Still, I have a feeling that this will be a welcome addition to the chain of chain restaurants that circle the mall here. We stopped overnight while traveling, but would eat here again if we were in the area. And we will ask to be seated in Lolia's section, because her smile and warm personality were enough on their own to move this from a 3.5 to a 4 star review."
Wendall H.,"Silver Spring, MD",202,129,591,4.0,4/3/2016,"What a great performance by a restaurant that has been open for two weeks! It is hard to have all of the hidden parts moving smoothly when you are welcoming new customers to your new establishment. But, they succeeded spectacularly! The hosts were nice, friendly, and working the waiting crowd. The ""wait"" did not seem long either. And, YES, there was a wait. It. Went. Fast. Tables were sat on the left; on the right; and in the center. The tables were vacated; cleaned; set; and ready to go.  Our waitress was fabulous! She was friendly, knowledgeable, and overflowing with charm.  My only true criticism was the food. It was good, but it lacked an element of personal character. There are cooks that can reproduce a menu item from a tried and true formula. Then there are the chefs that will create, with repeated excellence, that dish that is listed on the menu. While their cooks are good, I cannot place them in the chef category based on this visit. The meatballs in my son's spaghetti and meatballs were bland. My seared ahi salad had components that were packed with flavor, all except the ahi. It was really surprising to find the ahi lacking.  It wasn't bad, just bland in comparison.  The worse part of the entire evening was that I was traveling through the area. BJ's is the type of place that you want to keep coming back to, because you just know that they will keep getting better and better.  Side Note: I did not sit at the bar. I do not know how the service is. I have not experienced the expertise of their bartenders. I can only say that there were multiple TVs up top. There was a huge selection of alcohol. And, everyone was smiling. Enjoy."
Chris W.,"Wheeling, IL",26,278,74,3.0,3/21/2016,"Let me start off by saying I REALLY like this restaurant chain, some of the best food around. Having lived on the west coast for several years I have been to several BJs before and I love their beers and pizzas. When I saw they were opening in Winston I was stoked! So of course we went. So here goes the review.. I called ahead and put our name down with the a 6:50 table seating time. Arrived promptly at 6:50 and proceeded to wait an additional 15 minutes before being seated... Strike one, I hate waiting in the restaurant when our table should be ready. Moving on, i figure they are just busy and we get seated. Comfy booth with a great atmosphere. Completely the way I remember it back home and I feel like I am back on the west. But.. where is our waiter? 5 minutes go by... Finally a greeting and I will be right with you. We order our waters...crickets...  25 minutes later we get our waters. I kid you not... I timed it.  Strike 2....What could possibly take someone 25 minutes to get two waters from the bar? I was just about to go to the bar and get our drinks ourselves. Whatever, we got our waters but still no beer.  We order our meals shortly after our waters, luckily the salads came at a reasonable time. But AFTER we ordered wings as an appetizer we are told they are OUT of wings. How is a restaurant that been open a week out of something?! Wouldn't you have excess stock of everything? I guess not. But the part that annoyed me was that I was not told until well after I ordered them. They should come out with the salads... Still no beer...Strike 3. So they say we can order another appetizer on the house, but I don't really want anything else... ended up ordering sliders... Beer finally came though. Whatever, the salads are delicious and exactly as I remember them. Our pizza, a deep dish style comes out BEFORE the sliders, how is that even possible. We are literally done with our meal and the sliders are delivered to our table. Apparently our original order went to the wrong table.  At this point I am out of strikes. Bottom line the food is incredible, it really is. The pizza is cooked perfectly and is a great substitute for those from Chicago. The wings (which they were out of) are usually amazing and they have some phenomenal drinks. I especially like the Piranha and was very excited to order one again.  The manager did apologize for the hiccups in service, but if I am paying for something, I expect it to be worthwhile and spending 2 hours for dinner when I am waiting half the time for my orders... is a waste of my time as a paying customer. Hopefully they fix their service blunders as I really do like the restaurant. I'll give them another shot in a month or so and see if they have gotten better.  In the meantime, make sure to sign up for their rewards card and newsletter for discounts and free stuff."
Shannon W.,"Charlotte, NC",48,5,,5.0,9/30/2017,"My boyfriend's parents like in Winston, we live in Charlotte but are here often visiting. We don't often go out while in town. However today we decided to take a drive and happened upon this gem. I use Yelp all the time for recommendations but rarely posts reviews but this place deserves it. Awesome staff, huge menu, great beer selections. We just wanted a small snack so we decided on a deep dish pizza. It was amazing and there are so many other things we want to try. We decided right then it would be our place to go every visit. Long story short  give it a try. Good stuff."
Kelly M.,"Ronda, NC",2,52,72,5.0,11/8/2016,"Had an exceptional meal and an exceptional waitress! Loved everything about this place! Nice and roomy too, you don't feel like you're seated on top of other diners. The menu is huge!!! So many choices! Great place for anyone! Monday is pizza night 1/2 off of pizzas and though we didn't have one, they looked amazing, for sure going to try one on our next visit!  Second visit to this restaurant and I usually don't have a lot of negative feedback but here goes... if you have food allergies be cautious here because they will substitute items on your food if they are out the the ingredients listed on the menu description... i ordered  a salad and not only did it not have some of the ingredients listed but they were out of the dressing that comes on it and put some other dressing in it, without asking or telling me  first... (I was made aware because I requested additional dressing on the side) so check your food before you dig the food is good and you get good portion sizes. Just check your order first!"
Vella L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,8,,2.0,11/23/2017,"Considering they use tablets to place orders which was pretty cool, although we still waited 15-20 minutes for our food. The spinach dip was better than what I ordered. Nice atmosphere and the food is really not that great"
Joanne H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",8,3,,2.0,4/11/2017,Very slow service at lunch time...good thing I was at lunch with my manager so she knows why I'm late getting back!  Ordered regular pizza...came without sauce!  Waiter  acted as if I was asking for something special when I asked why my Pizza didn't come with tomato sauce. Remember this was just a regular pizza nothing special. So for the sake of time I accepted his offer of bringing me a side of marinara sauce to dip my pizza in.  Sorry BJ's but you're going to need to step it up if you're going to compete with Red Robin!
Jeff G.,"Clemson, SC",0,1,,1.0,9/14/2017,Have tried this place several times and it does not disappoint.  If you are looking for ok food and terrible service this is the place.  I have been to many restaurants and sent food back but never my beer.  After waiting 30 minutes to get my beer I sent it back and got another one. It was not much better.  My wife likes the place so i agreed to go but stated before we walked in if the service is bad I will not come back.  Will never go back
Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360,5.0,6/28/2016,"To start, we are absolutely hooked on this place. We went three straight time last weekend and the food is dynamite and every waitress knowledgeable and super friendly. That always makes the dining out experience enjoyable. Visit 1: We started out with an appitizer and picked Roasted  Brussel sprouts i drizzled with Honey Sriracha sauce. We are fans of sprouts and this just put it over the top. Perfectly roasted and damn tasty. Decided to order the hickory smoked brisket burger. with bacon and barbecue sauce The brisket was so tender and the hamburger was cook perfectly  (medium). It came with fries which are thin and perfectly salted My fiance ordered the California Chicken Club with fried. She is a fan. Not to mention the Visit #2. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms with lemon pesto aioli sauce. If you're a fan of stuffed mushrooms...order these We had to try the deep dish pizza so we ordered the BJ's special which had homemade meatball, pepperoni, sausage, roasted tomatoes, bell pepper, onions and black olives. It was so good and the crust was nice and crispy.  Visit #3: We decided we only wanted some appetizers this time so we got Portabella mushroom strips. They were very crispy and juicy and came with a garlic aioli sauce for dipping. So delicious. We also order the Queso dip and the homemade guacamole with chips. Also delicious.  Our experience has been nothing but joyous. The food is great and the wait staff is awesome. We are fans of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Be sure to ask for DAPHNE and COURTNEY. Great waitresses."
Barrie P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",182,541,554,4.0,7/4/2016,"I had a great first visit to BJ's Brewhouse. The food and service were very good. We started off with the chicken wings with root beer sauce. They were my favorite part of the whole meal. The wings were meeting and crispy. The sauce was sweet with a little spice and tang. I tried the BJ's special deep dish pizza. I had never had deep dish pizza before and really enjoyed it. I liked the mix of meat and vegetables plus there was a ton on the pizza. Since I downloaded the app I was able to get a free cookie. I tried the triple chocolate which tasted like a brownie and was really tasty. Overall the ambiance, service, and food were great so I will visit here again."
David H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",288,186,1972,4.0,7/30/2016,I'm from Arizona and I enjoyed it. Enjoyed it here because our server was cool and the food was pretty good.  Loved the Chandler signs and reminded me of home. Had the Ahi Poke for an app and then the guacamole bacon burger and a side of Caesar salad. The fries that came with the burger were great I love crispy thin fries and they nailed it.  Will be back and thanks for the reminders of home.
Lawren D.,"Hamptonville, NC",13,120,34,2.0,12/21/2016,"This place SUCKS. It's not so much the food, it's the service. It is TERRIBLE. I thought no one could be worse at service than Outback, and I was wrong. Every single time we've ever been here, the wait on our food has been an hour or more. We always wait a good 10+ minutes before we're even greeted by a server. The last time we went, honestly wouldn't have even gone had it not been for a gift card due to the service the time before that. My husband ordered a burger and fries, and I ordered shrimp tacos and broccoli. An hour and 20 minutes later, with drinks empty, they brought out my husband's food and my tacos. When I asked about the broccoli, she replied ""it's coming. It wasn't quite done cooking yet"". Are you KIDDING ME?! How the hell does it take more than an hour to cook BROCCOLI??? Since when does it take less time to make a burger and shrimp tacos than broccoli??? That should've been one of the first things done! That is exactly why we will NEVER go back to that location ever again. We have the exact same experience every single time. It doesn't matter who waits on us. I don't know how this place does such good business. Then again, it's Winston-Salem, and there's a never a wait, while other restaurants have a wait of 30 minutes or better before you can even get a table. Guess that says something!!! The ONLY reason this gets 2 stars is because the food is the only good part about the visit."
Jason R.,"Winston-Salem, NC",23,18,10,4.0,10/20/2016,"Wait time-none.  But I was there around 6pm on a Thursday.   Service - waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about their beers and food.  Food wait - no time at all. Always had something to eat.  Recommend- the red ale Jeremiah Red with the slab of ribs.  The ribs are superb.  Nice crunch and no mess, falls right off the bone.  Will be coming back. Price for two with appetizers, four drinks and two main course $75.  Not bad at all."
Brittany L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",136,302,150,4.0,1/7/2017,"We had a really great time! Im a little late to the game - finally tried BJs out last month and I was pretty impressed. I was 9 months pregnant at the time so I was unable to sample from the ample cocktail or beer menu. But I have my eye on a spicy margarita for the next time we go in. We got the Chicago style pizza special which came with 2 salads, one large pizza and dessert all for $25. It was enough food to feed 3 of us and be very satisfied. The dessert.... we didn't stop talking about it for days. It was essentially a cookie cake with ice cream on top. We got the salted caramel and OMG was it amazing! It's a must try. See you guys again soon for a cocktail and dessert night :):)"
Worthy P.,"Lewisville, NC",173,95,25,4.0,12/18/2016,"I really enjoy this place. The staff is nice and the food is great! My only complaint is that many things are overpriced, especially drinks. $10 for a tiny margarita with barely any alcohol! My last complaint is wait times. They are not very fast at seating people or taking orders, making this a difficult place to eat if you're on a time crunch."
Karen S.,"Kernersville, NC",218,408,571,3.0,5/29/2016,"Bumped up a star solely based on the awesome service we received from Lolia H in the bar area. She was extremely knowledgable about all the beers as well as on top of all the menu items- and the menu is huge!!  She was personable and charming. Again, we all enjoyed our food- we especially liked the root beer glazed boneless wings (appetizer) as well as the avocado egg rolls( also appetizer) The deep dish pizza continues to be one of the best items on the menu.  Service this time was awesome but we just can't seem to wrap our heads around the $6 beers... Dinner for 3 was over $90 and I sadly wasn't even drinking.... Going back over our check the next day, while we had asked for the 2 for $25 deal, we were charged separately for those items, bringing the total to $30 and not getting our free dessert  I did not realize this until the next day... We like the atmosphere and food- hopefully they will come down a bit on their prices to warrant 4 stars."
Sean B.,"Clemmons, NC",14,131,155,2.0,5/2/2016,"I have to say that was one of the biggest and most complex menus I've seen in a long time. I honestly had a hard time finding something because it was so busy with ton of info.  The first thing you figure out this is more of a bar. The first, and I don't think I am off by many 5-6 pages is drinks. So once you finally get to the grub the next thing that jumps out at you are the prices. They are a little in the high side.  We went at lunch and were seated right away. I'm guessing at first the long wait for the waiter was because of the novel I have for a menu. When he finally showed up he was very friendly.  We asked for suggestions, as they had pizza, burgers, steak, fish, and we had I clue what to order. He suggested the  Sriracha Queso Dip, and root bar rib appetizer. Now when you hear Sriracha you thinking some heat, nope none, and hardly any flavor. The chips are very much like the kind you get at chili's. After we had finished we found out it was supposed to have a chili on it. We saw this when we got the bill and the did comp it.  The ribs, they had an amazing glaze, but not much flavor. However, unlike the Queso, it had some heat.  However there was hardly any meat on the bone, and it was fairly tough.  The sad thing the best thing there was the handcrafted draft soda. The were super cool, and so smooth. The service was lackluster with a lot of I'm sorry, we don't have any, or something in the kitchen is causing the delay."
Bill E.,"Covington, GA",1,36,6,2.0,7/3/2017,Food was mediocre and the place is poorly Managed 1 bar tender no bar back and the place is getting slammed...pork queso dip was amazing tho!
Brian C.,"Conway, SC",34,1,1,3.0,1/16/2017,"I was introduced to this franchise while on business in OKC. My first trip to the Winston Salem location left me with the urge to persuade corperate to entertain an MYR location. Wendy, my bartender was great. The Santa Fe Salad was yummy however I  would prefer larger pieces of chicken. The Committed Double IPA was excellent. I want to send major props to the design team.   The decor is intimate but not dark.   The faux architecture is well done and highlighted in a way that makes it look almost real.   The back bar lets one quickly learn available brands.   The highlighted corperate brand elements are lit tastefully. In all one of the best ""never been there before"" experiences. I highly recommend you give them a try."
Jeremy C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",60,243,247,3.0,5/2/2016,"We stopped in for the bar because of a previous conversation that I had with a server there and decided to stop in and check out the place. We had already had dinner earlier that evening so we stopped by anyway to check out the bar area. So this review is only for the bar. There is a full bar with lots of wine and beer selections. In fact they make their own beer and I tried the Irish Style Jeremiah Red. It was good, not great but good. After perusing the menu we opted for a dessert also. We opted for the BJ's Baked Beignet, The menu describes it as ""Our delicious bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream."" And while it looks huge and heavy, it is certainly light and fluffy and a really nice option. I looked at the menu and it is fairly large and that in itself is a little scary for me as it is hard to execute a large menu well, but I will be back to try a dinner or lunch soon."
Amy O.,"Winston-Salem, NC",41,51,33,5.0,4/11/2016,"I have wanted to try BJ's since I lived in California and constantly saw the advertising on my TV. The closest BJs was about 2hrs away so I never went. I was super excited when I saw one was opening right down the street. My friend and I went on a Saturday evening the weekend after they opened. We were given a 25-35minute wait....not bad for 6pm on a Saturday. The one thing I really like, is that we weren't forced to wait in the overly crowded lobby, or stand in the drizzle. I left my phone number and we received a text when our table was ready. We waited in the car, warm, uncrowded and we chose the music. We were lead to a cozy small 2 top booth in the corner. My only complaint was it was SO COLD. Maybe it was because we were directly under a vent, I'm not sure. I had to get our jackets from the car...thank goodness I had one, I wouldn't have been comfortable without it. Upon looking at the vast menu we decided to skip an appetizer so we would have room for dessert. I wanted a Pazzooki so badly. I ended up ordering the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were AMAZING. I didn't even realize that they were on the Lighter Choice menu. The side that accompanied them was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I wish I could find the recipe and make it at home. My friend ordered chicken fettuccine. It was really good. She said it was some of the best. We both actually ate our whole meals, which doesn't usually happen. In my opinion it's a huge compliment to the chef. Unfortunately, due to being so cold and uncomfortable we chose to leave without dessert. We will go back in another night for the Pazzooki sampler trio thing."
Scott R.,"Winston-Salem, NC",115,34,55,4.0,11/27/2016,We don't usually eat out burgers while at the Oak Island but was highly recommend by our beach home owner! Was very surprised that such a good burger in this little whole in the wall place! I had the cheeseburger all the way (what I call a Carolina burger) I don't think 5 Guys even make one as good as this one! Must stop if your looking for this best hamburger in Oak Island!!!
Ryan C.,"Clemmons, NC",17,47,,4.0,5/3/2017,"I have eaten here multiple times since it opened over a year ago.  The food is very good for a sports bar/tavern type place.  Though I've mostly stuck to the burgers and pizzas, the menu is huge and there are a ton of options to choose from.  The beer selection is good, with local choices in addition to their own brews.  The service is a little inconsistent, but on most occasions it has been good.  It's definitely a step above Carolina Ale House on the other side of Hanes Mall from where BJ's is located."
Naomi B.,"Clemmons, NC",8,8,1,2.0,1/25/2017,"Wow... customer service needs improvement. Had to wait at the take out desk about 5 minutes and had 4 difgerent staff walk past and look at me without speaking before I was helped. Really? Even if that's not your ""area"" you still need to acknowledge the customer.  The food was okay... mostly luke-warm, but I guess that's the downfall with take out.  Plastic was cooked into chicken.... thicker than saran wrap but not as thick as the plastic to go containers.   The only thing I did appreciate was how they reviewed my order with me to make sure everything was there."
Carly C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,25,20,3.0,7/17/2017,"Visited recently after nearly a year. Service was excellent and the food was mediocre at best. Salads came out quickly. Sparse amount of dressing for both of them. We ordered steaks for our main entree, one ribeye and one sirloin. They were cooked perfectly and had a decent flavor. Sides of garlic mashed potatoes and cauliflower were bland and lacking seasoning. I won't rule out eating here again especially on Thursday rib night!"
Keith P.,"High Point, NC",15,47,23,1.0,3/12/2017,I should of known by the large menu the food would be bad. I guess you can't get away with it cause most people are drinking. The beer is great. Had a pizza and it was not any better then Pizza Hut. Service was so slow. Would I go back? No! There's too many restaurants in Winston that have great beer and better food.
William H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",5,13,,3.0,3/14/2017,"I would give this place 4 stars but stayed with 3 over the service. Food is good, but what is so hard about bringing out the beers quickly? Waiting for food is no problem when you're drinking beer. But sitting there and waiting forever for food and beer is the worst. That's the main problem for this place, the service is way too slow."
Koury K.,"Clemmons, NC",8,60,84,2.0,10/3/2016,We ordered a Chicago deep dish pizza. Not even close!!! This is not a deep dish and it taste nothing like a Chicago pizza!!! Ships and salsa is close to chili's :) very thin and tateless
Is S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,14,,3.0,12/6/2016,"First time at this restaurant. We picked up two orders of unlimited soup and salad. My soup came and I waited and then ended up eating it all before the rest came (after some gentle complaining). The lentil soup was good as was the clam chowder and the tortilla chicken. The tortilla strips in the soup were soggy, probably from sitting waiting for a runner.  They had a wrong dressing on a salad but they were still good. Our waitress was friendly and reasonably attentive. The issues seem centered around managing the food delivery.  Beer prices are high."
Adam N.,"Greensboro, NC",0,8,,5.0,4/25/2017,"Great food. Fast service and good beer. Had pizza, salad, queso, beer, and pizookie! Everything was great and service was quick and friendly."
