Sheri T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",47,22,46,4.0,7/15/2016,"I have been to the BJ's in Columbus, Ohio and now this location, newly opened this past year in Winston-Salem.Upon its W-S grand opening, I stayed away to let the initial hoopla die down. I joined the Premier Rewards club when i went to the Columbus location but never expected to be a big fan. I was wrong. I got a 'BOGOF' lunch coupon email and decided it was time to give the W-S location a try.  As i entered, there was a party of 12 'ladies who lunch' who had neglected to make reservations(really, who does that??!!). I thought 'OMG this is going to be a train wreck'. I was waiting for a friend, so i sat down to see how the staff would handle it. The Manager (Ty?) and his team did a great job getting this party seated and served very quickly. I was impressed. Our server , Ashley, was excellent!!!!!!! I will look for her every time i go back. The menu was extensive enough to satisfy any taste bud, and the  beer selections are varied enough to try new or stay with your standard (check out the sampler!) I ordered the roasted sriracha Brussel sprouts, which were a huge 'no likey'. While the sriracha sauce was excellent, there was not enough of it to offset the bitterness of  the sprouts. I will say that Asley noticed they were greatly untouched and spoke to the manager about it and they took it off the bill. The fried artichoke fingers were unremarkable; no star player there. Any loss of points from the appetizers were more than made up by the rest of the meal. The chicken tortilla and tomato soups were TO DIE FOR! The tomato soup was creamy and robust. A smooth and tasty treat to my palate and a warm hug in my tummy.  The chicken tortilla soup was the star of the show. The server brings it in a two- part presentation. The usual toppings (cheese,tortilla strips, etc) are in a bowl joined with a nice hunk of fresh avocado (nice!). The soup itself is poured from a separate pitcher and the ingredients all join together in holy taste bud matrimony for a true union of soup love. I also had the Cali Chicken Club sandwich. No deli meat here! the bread was perfectly grilled, and the entire sandwich was generous, fresh, and tasty. My BFF had the Caesar salad and it looked like something off the Food Network. Abundant, fresh, and zesty. My only regret is that i left no room for dessert on this visit. The monkey bread with ice cream is THE BOMB (had it in Columbus). I will be returning to continue my gastronomic adventure through this behemoth of a menu.  Pizza is next!"
Ayana S.,"Lexington, NC",11,32,211,4.0,9/11/2016,"First timer here and won't be my last. Loved the design and setup of the place. The open atmosphere was a plus for me and the bar was very colorful and inviting. My table had the spinach mushrooms for an appetizer and they were delicious, couldn't get enough. I ordered a strawberry mojito and it was exactly what I wanted. The mahi mahi tacos were to die for, probably one of the best I've had. I will definitely be coming back again."
Guillermo A.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,39,,2.0,1/18/2017,"This place is terrible. My friends and I had been here not less than 4 times for lunch, giving it one more chance, until last time when we decided to VETO it. The place is nice, the ambient is joyful, menu is great, full of delicious choices and the food is good and tasty, BUT the service is a mess. In our case, the soups have been cold all of the times, despite our request for very warm soups; last time the soups came after the entrées because they were still in the making; and sometimes the items in your plate do not match your order. We will wait until service improves to come back."
Lucy M.,"Advance, NC",18,84,1,2.0,8/1/2016,"Underwhelmed.  Our service was good - server was knowledgeable and food came quickly, no complaints there.   Now the experience:  The menu is a bound, glossy book and I kid you not, its something like 13 or 14 pages long.  Overkill.  Took us forever to read through the menu and decide.  I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon, tomato and avocado - sourdough bread, grilled nicely (tons of butter), big hunk of avocado in the middle - find that annoying.  My son got one of their Piadinas - chicken, bacon, ranch.  What is a Piadina you ask?  We did too.  On the menu it apperas to be a toasted wrap type sandwich.  The waiter actually described it as similar to a hot pocket.  Ordered it anyway.  Waiter was not wrong.  I feel like it was $9.95 hot pocket - diced, processed chicken and all.  They have the little shoestring fries and they are very crispy, but they get cold fast and they have some type of salty seasoning on them that makes them taste way overly processed - they are sooooooo frozen.   Bar looked nice - several tv's surround the entire restaurant.  But they are really hard to see.  They're placed at the very top of the wall and honestly they could be much bigger.   I don't really see any reason to go back.  This place is just mediocre.  $20 before tip for a grilled cheese and a hot pocket with some frozen fries (we each had water to drink)."
Charles C.,"Austin, TX",10,214,9,4.0,7/27/2016,"I'm a big fan of BJ's. The main thing I like about the restaurant are the deep dish pizzas, specifically the Mediterranean pizza. The beers, which are their own recipes, is also pretty decent. How are those places deafly on the higher end of prices. I think the beers are overpriced in my opinion."
Alice B.,"Charlotte, NC",94,152,133,2.0,2/1/2017,"I visited a BJ's in Maryland before and enjoyed it, so I was excited when I saw a location opened in Winston-Salem. What I like most about BJ's in general is the great happy hour deals, drinks and the large TVs for game watching. This time, in Winston-Salem, I sat at the bar around 5:30-6PM. Ordered wine which was 1/2 off and a mini deep dish pizza, which according to the menu screen at the bar was also 1/2 at the time. Unfortunately my server didn't know this and charged me full price, when I mentioned it to her, she insisted that happy hour ended at 6. I think it's a neat place, and maybe next time I should just get a table, but the service was poor ."
Emily R.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,4,1,3.0,6/8/2016,"3 stay is ONlY for FOOD! Just a few things I wanted to point out from the reviews I have read after our experience at BJs. 1. Whoever is Loila , I wish we had the pleasure of having your service because our server just DID not care. We went around 3:45 pm , so it was really dead. Food was great , we had the BBQ brisket burger and the Black&Bleu. However it was just the service. Food came out on time , but we were not offered napkins , refills , or even plain and simple , ""May I get you anything else? Thank you enjoy!"" Common courtesy in the restaurant business when your a waitress or waiter. We were not offered dessert, we weren't interested but again it's part of being a server! (I am a current bartender!) Took 15 minutes to get our check way after we were done. Took another 10 to swipe our card.  2. I see they use , ""We dropped the plate of food in the back."" Alot as their excuse to say they basicslly forgot to put the order in. Oldest excuse in the book. The whole , ""My bad I forgot to put it in,"" scenario is not the way to let your table know YOU made a mistake. Get a manager out IMMEDIATELY people ! Apologize for your mistake properly , don't be ghetto about it. 3. Menu. Huge menu. Which is great for a picky eater , but it was very overwhelming. We must have flipped through the menu from cover to cover at least 5 times. Make sure you let your server know you need a few minutes or ask them if they may recommend something to you. 4. Prices are a little on the steep side. Doable however. Food is worth it depending on the plate , but the drinks were a little more than I would've wanted to pay, Especially if the glass is 90% ice.  To wrap this long review up, We will be going back solely based on their FOOD! We are foodies , travel alot to eat , so we are interested in trying more. However , I am hoping for a better server the next time we go or at least see a managers face and ask how our experience was. They are still adjusting , it's only been a few months, but once the summer is over any bad review after that is NO EXCUSE. Get it together BJs."
Matt N.,"Ronda, NC",89,5,,4.0,4/6/2017,Good food and nice atmosphere! I had no issues with slow service. Service was actually really fast and good. The portobello strips were amazing!
Cassaundra M.,"Charlotte, NC",142,240,903,3.0,6/8/2016,"3 stars for our server, that's it! I was not that impressed with the food. We decided to go off of an recommendation after a pre-K graduation on a Thursday Evening. We were seated immediately. Our server was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I really hate that I can't find my receipt to post his name. He really took care of us. I mean REALLY took care of us. And even better, he understood our sarcastic personalities and even joined in. We had a good time! They give the kids at the table a free appetizer of Bread & Fruit. The bread is incredible. I love a good soft roll! And the fruit were very fresh. I ordered the Calamari appetizer and the Sirlon(Well Done) & Parmesan Shrimp. The Calamari were very tender but they tasted like they were cooked in old oil. My steak was burnt and tough & the shrimp were very oily. The kids got a Pizza. It had soooo much pepperoni on it. I didn't taste it but a lot of people in the restaurant ordered pizzas. They just kept coming out. So I can only assume the Pizzas are a bit hit there. And the kids at our table at 2 slices each. My cousin got the Chicken Alfredo and added shrimp. It was more like Chicken Fettuccini with a few specs of Broccoli. VERY dry! She had to ask for extra sauce on the side. We also tried 2 of the Pizookies for dessert. They were decent but not anything to rave about. I doubt i'd return on my own, but i'm sure i'll be returning with friends."
Tripp M.,"Rock Hill, SC",25,39,,3.0,12/29/2016,"The staff was good but hears the funny thing. Someone etched on the dinner table don't order the queso. We saw that after the fact so people don't order the queso!! They charged us a $1 for more chips.  I'm not a cheap kind of person but there are things that really get under my skin.  The ribs were good but the dry rub was too much. The BBQ sauce couldn't overtake the taste.  The breading of the fried shrimp was not good.  Don't let the kids eat for 99¢ pull you in like us. My daughter wouldn't eat her meal except for the fries. I liked the chilli but over all two adults and two kids and a $75 bill, I was not satisfied.  I would not come back."
Annette T.,"Winston Salem, NC",37,15,16,4.0,6/27/2016,"The food is good and hot and the beers are awesome, great for a girls or guys night. Look forward to coming back. My service at the bar left something to be desired though. I felt as if my server was lacking in the social and friendly department"
James S.,"Graham, NC",4,238,216,1.0,4/2/2016,"Recently opened and boy was I looking forward to this place. Located in the Haynes Mall parking lot. This place sux beyond belief. Everything was wrong from the time I entered the door until I finally had enough and walked out, without eating. I checked in online, which was useless. It takes me about 30 minutes to get here so that is plenty of time. After I get there I still have to sit and wait for everybody else to get seated before I get seated. So online check in is a joke.  Next, just like other reviewers have stated the service is slow. It is beyond slow. It took me about 20 minutes to get a drink. I ordered an appetizer, which came out wrong. My drink was wrong.  So all of that had to be sent back and took even longer to get right. After being in the restaurant for just over an hour my food finally came out. A burger, which cost $11.25, was tiny, didnt even cover the bun and was completely burnt. Cooked down with hard black edges, like a piece of charcoal. Absolutely disgusting. I took 1 bite and asked for the manager. He finally wondered his way out and was a complete tool. He offered to replace it or get me something else. But that was it. I would still have to pay, and the long wait for it to be cooked. He was very condescending, arrogant, and just did not care. So I sent the burger back and told him to take it off of my bill. I didnt want anything. I got up and walked out. The service here is so bad. You can get better food and service at the popular fast food restaurant, also located in the mall parking lot.   The people here do not care. They are all clueless and do not care about the customer. The absolute worst. Beer is average at best. With the horrible service, and nasty food, there is no reason to eat here. I will never be back to this place. EVER."
Abby C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",17,77,37,2.0,4/10/2016,"I was really looking forward to trying this new place out and really wanted to write a better review, but for us the cons outweighed the pros. With call ahead seating, we were sat quickly and the beer and food were good (though I will say the beer was somewhat expensive compared to other places in the area). The menu itself was huge and they had a wide variety of food from pizza to seafood dishes and everything in between. However, after we were sat, our experience quickly went downhill.  Our server, while friendly enough, was not very efficient and after putting in a large appetizer order, we waited for a very long time. Once our entrees showed up, we asked where our appetizer was, and he basically said, ""My bad. I didn't put it in."" At this point, it seemed senseless to have them bring it out, so we canceled the appetizer order. In the meantime, one person in our group didn't get her entree because they dropped it on the floor, so she had to wait over 15 minutes to get a new meal while the rest of us finished our food. It also seemed like there was always someone different bringing us food/drinks...never the same person. Finally once the bills were brought out, they charged us for desserts that were supposed to be comped, and charged our friends for one of their meals twice, so we had to get that all sorted out.  Overall, the food and drinks were good and I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant itself, so had our experience not been so poor, I would probably give this restaurant a 4-star review. However, the forgotten appetizer, the dropped food (I understand accidents happen, but it definitely didn't help matters), the messed up bill, and the seemingly unconcerned server (not to mention we never had a manager come out to table touch and apologize for anything) dropped it down to two stars. I do know this place is pretty much brand spanking new and they are going to have bumps in the road and need to find their rhythm, so I can't say I won't be back...but it may be way down the line after they have established themselves a bit more."
Regina M.,"Sevierville, TN",3,4,3,4.0,12/30/2016,"We ordered a small bacon and ham pizza and a burger.  Both were amazing! Quick service and amazing food!  You need to get a pizookie!! This was our first visit, but I see another in our future!"
John A.,"Concord, NC",1,8,6,4.0,2/25/2017,"Needed an impromptu celebratory dinner, and have been here before so I knew how much I liked their Tatonka stout. Happy that their ribeye was as good. My server Kaylin made me feel at home, especially when she was happy to accommodate my dessert order of another stout."
Wendy L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",124,4,3,5.0,2/19/2017,"This place was great. There was so much selection for food, beer, and other cocktails! The service was great. The bar is so big and the bartenders are wondering. I really recommend coming here. BJ's has the best food in Winston! You would think bc of it being a chain the quality would be below par but that is far from true."
Bob K.,"Advance, NC",1,21,,2.0,12/16/2016,"Had the bacon burger. Was very over cooked, dry and crusty on the outside.  Bun was past its prime.  Waited 30 minutes for it, despite not a lot of people in the place, so I just ate it and enjoyed the time with my dinner guest. Chocolate brownie ice cream dessert was good. There are better places to eat right nearby. Waitress and host were both very friendly."
Mikaela B.,"East Bend, NC",110,6,13,5.0,1/21/2017,"My first time at BJ's brought me back, but second time blew me away! Our waitress was Dixie and she was incredible! She acknowledged us immediately even though she had many tables on a busy night. I never felt like our service was compromised despite the hectic atmosphere. She made excellent meal suggestions and was very knowledgeable in answering my questions about the menu, as well as assisting with the signup for the BJ's loyalty program (which is great, free, and gets you a delicious Pazookie dessert upon sign up). The food is always great, but this experience provided amazing food and more importantly unforgettable service! Thank you Dixie!"
Nicole E.,"Summerville, SC",52,1,,1.0,7/12/2017,My husband and I are new to the area. We met a couple at 4:30 for an appetizer and drinks. There were 3 bartenders and only 2 patrons at the bar. We sat at a high top table in the bar area and waited for 10 minutes. Not one of the bartenders bothered to come over. We left and took our business elsewhere. We won't return. There are far too many choices in the area!
Jen H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,41,4,4.0,5/11/2017,"I'm not usually someone that likes chain restaurants, but this place had really fresh food. I had the gyro tacos which were fantastic. Also, they had an amazing draft beer selection."
