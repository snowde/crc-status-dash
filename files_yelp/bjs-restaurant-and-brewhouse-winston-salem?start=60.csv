Michael S.,"Kernersville, NC",117,543,688,2.0,8/14/2016,"A strange experience to say the least!  So we walk into the new BJ's on a Saturday morning just after 11am.  A beautiful interior greets us as we walk in, as well as a pleasant hostess that seats us in a nearly empty restaurant.  Fifteen minutes pass after being seated and nobody greets us at the table.  After five more minutes pass, and a few tables after us get greeted, I ask for a server for which I'm told there was confusion over who had us?  Understaffed for opening on Saturday is the correct answer!  Our drink and food order was placed after apologies on both sides were exchanged!  Roughly fifteen minutes pass after orders were placed and our appetizer arrived.  Except for the fact that we STILL didn't have drinks, the Brussel Sprouts looked and tasted great!  Certainly the app to get here!  Finally after drinks arrived and we enjoyed the Brussel Sprouts, we had what seemed to be a sincere apology from the manager.  We were comped the $5 app, comped a shareable dessert, and given the M-F lunch special of unlimited soup/salad.  The first version of Caesar Salad that came to two people at our table was extremely brown and wilted tasting!  Obviously pre-made and sitting, a definite no-no, and a shameful oversight on the person expediting the food!  The second version on the reorder was crisp and green, but certainly missing something in the lackluster Caesar.  Two soups were tried with one being a clear winner.  The Clam Chowder is really good and flavorful!  The Broccoli and Cheese however was decent but had way too much thick cheese on top that was added before it went out!  Overall the food is just decent, but the service and lack of training of all facets of the restaurant affects the customer the most."
Chris S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,28,1,4.0,11/26/2016,Food was good. Service was great!. They have parking for wounded vets and I think that is awesome and needs to be the norm everywhere
Jonathan A.,"Winston-Salem, NC",8,74,1,2.0,8/22/2016,"Poor service, exterior of building has lots of trash laying around, out of menu items  (medium pizzas), food we got wasn't bad, but nothing exceptional"
Aimee S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",19,2,,5.0,11/11/2016,I love this place! Lots of great choices and great staff. The fried brussel sprouts are one of the best things I've ever eaten.
Sally J.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,33,2,1.0,9/29/2016,This review is only for the service....we came in for apps and drinks. The place was not busy. We sat for 15-20 minutes and NOBODY came to the table so we left and went to the Ale House and were waited on in less than 2 minutes.
June P.,"Greensboro, NC",2,2,,1.0,6/29/2016,"Would not recommend. It took a very long time for the food to be made. When it came out it was horrible, our deep dish pizza was all crust and burnt on the top and bottom. Yet the toppings weren't cooked all the way through, it was crazy. Service was poor, had to ask multiple times for things. Wait staff would politely smile and say ""sure!"" never to be seen again. It was frustrating to say the least. If you go get the fries, they were the only thing worth eating (even though we never got our ketchup, haha)."
Randy A.,"King, NC",17,21,1,5.0,9/7/2016,Nice place with a big bar. Service is good and the everyone loved the food. I have personally only tried the New Orleans Jambalaya and it is really good. I have eaten it 4 times now. Others with me like there sandwiches and raviolis.
Jerry K.,"Advance, NC",26,10,,2.0,10/15/2016,"This was the first time trying this sports/restaurant. We stopped in the watch a football game and try the beer and food.  First I'll start with the service.  We sat at the bar and we waited on by a very nice helpful young lady!  She was very polite and helpful and prompt. Its a good thing the service was so good because the food was HORRIBLE!!!  Between my wife and I we decided to order several things to sample the food and take some home knowing we wouldn't eat it all.  we ordered the wing to start (dry rub crispy) and they were not good.  Very greasy and just sprinkled with a  seasoning salt.  Would never order these again.  then we order two different bowels of soup, the chilly and the broccoli cheddar.  The chilly was worse than eating Hormel chilly from the can and the broccoli soup had no broccoli was extremely running.  Neither of us ate the soups.  Them I ordered a bacon cheese burger thinking this would be a safe bet,  This was one of the worst bar burgers I have ever had!  The atmosphere is nice but at the end of the day the food is terrible so we'll go to much better sport bar in the future!"
Pat L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,5,,1.0,2/27/2017,Came in at 8pm. Had a group of 7 last night. Sat in the bar. Very slow service. Had to ask several times for our waitress  when we finally got to order they were out of several items on the menu. Out of hamburger buns had to put a hamburger on bread. And still charged full price. Probably won't go back
Sherry M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",15,6,,4.0,10/2/2016,"Great atmosphere. Sat at the bar Daphne was friendly funny and knowledgeable pairing beers with their food. The hickory brisket burger was killer so good. Had Flatbread nachos,yum. Will definitely return, especially to see Daphne"
Robert M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,6,1,1.0,2/19/2017,"Overpriced and mediocre quality food; good service.  Save your money and go elsewhere ... plenty of much better restaurants in Winston Salem.  Floors greasy and slippery (I almost fell walking to booth and shoes slipped throughout dinner), my burger was overcooked with cold fries (replacement fries were lukewarm), my wife's food was not as stated on menu (learned after the fact when served), and my son's spaghetti was overcooked.  No management interaction whatsoever when food not right; didn't see anyone who even looked or acted like a manager in the whole place.  Hopefully, they can get this place together; it has a great location and environment; and if they cooked the food as stated and well, this place would be a star."
C W.,"Lexington, NC",0,2,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Menus were filthy.  Every page was greasy AND had food crumbs in it.  The table had just been bussed prior to our party being seates.  We had to call them back  to clean the table again and then call them back because the crumbs from the table ended up on the seats.   Not sure how you mix up Brussels sprouts and asparagus but it happened on my entree. They have decent ambiance, with enough TVs to serve as a distraction from the cleanliness and mediocre food.  Glad to have the option in Winston-Salem but I'll opt out in the future!"
Shelley H.,"Lexington, NC",179,14,5,4.0,9/3/2016,My husband and I stopped in to try it out since it's new to Winston-Salem. The beers are really tasty and the pizza was sooo good!  We will be going back!
Tammy O.,"San Francisco, CA",3,11,,2.0,7/6/2016,Food was decent. Menu really not too big or overwhelming but service was awful!!! What a shame.  Tried again in another  city and returned for another meal on way back through so I know it can be good!
Lauren N.,"Cleveland, NC",34,11,1,3.0,8/15/2016,"The food is excellent, but the service leaves much to be desired.  My husband and I walked in and were eventually met by a hostess who took us to our seats.  I'm almost 9 months pregnant and she didn't ask if we had a preference for a booth or table, even though half of the restaurant was empty.  We were led to a small table in direct sunlight and asked to move.  Once we got to our 2-seater booth, it took about 20 minutes for a server to make eye contact with us.  The waitress who did said ""Um... has anyone helped you yet?""  Nope, that's why we have been sitting here for so long with no drinks.  Anyway, thank goodness for the waitress who finally cared, or who knows how long we would've watched the same staff walk by us over and over again like we were invisible."
Stephanie A.,"Winston-Salem, NC",134,221,592,5.0,3/18/2016,"Wow is all I can say about this new brewhouse that opened in the Hanes Mall parking lot! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted and seated by extremely friendly staff. I love the high, industrial ceilings with brushed stainless accents and Edison bulbs for lighting! The back wall has their list of craft beers which is great and easy to see even from the far side of the dining area. We had a wonderful server, Hope, who had a great personality but also wasn't afraid to ask for help since they just opened this week. I can appreciate that so much more than someone I winging it. I tasted their Jeremiah Red beer and it reminded me of a Killian's which would be great except I was ordering seafood for dinner. I ended up getting their Harvest Hefeweizen which had a Bavarian beer profile with banana hints and citrus. It went amazingly with the seafood and was very refreshing! I ordered the Roasted Salmon which was a huge serving of salmon that had been perfectly roasted with light seasonings and was still moist! It was on top of roasted mixed vegetables of asparagus, red peppers, and mushrooms with perfectly cooked quinoa. Better than seafood I've had at the beach! I can't wait to return soon! You can download their free app and earn points with each purchase, get call ahead seating, have them start your order before you arrive and even pay for your check!"
Lisa C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,2,1,1.0,4/30/2016,A group of us have tried 3 times eating at BJ . The first time we went they had trainers it was an awesome experience everything was spot on. So we told friends how great the experience was they went with us to eat it was awful. Everything from the service to some of the food choices were not good so disappointed we were comped our meal given  gift cards to come back to please try it again and we did we were there for two and a half hours on a weekday waiting on food or waitress she was apologetic and she was very good at her job but it didn't make up for the time the food took. We all decided that it wasn't a place we come back to again after 3 tries you just don't want to do it anymore I just don't have 2 1/2 hrs  to wait for a meal. I hope they can work out their issues the atmosphere is a nice place.
Eric P.,"Kernersville, NC",5,25,10,3.0,5/28/2016,"Tried it for the second and I must say a much better experience. Our server, Lolia H, was AMAZING!!! She was very informative on the beers. I told her what I liked in beer and she recommended a great beer.  Beers were priced a little high for my liking. $7 a pop. Would have given 4 stars if the beers were $5 a glass. Avocado egg rolls were delicious and pizza was good. Overall, a lot better experience and recommend people to go there."
Tony F.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,8,,5.0,3/20/2016,First time...had great service and the food was great!  Had the New Orleans jambalaya and very impressed with serving size and taste.  We really enjoyed our meal.
Karl K.,"Advance, NC",0,2,,4.0,12/19/2016,"Wonderful food, miserably slow service. I had ordered the Santa Fe salad with Salmon as recommended by my server and was incredibly impressed with how big the serving was as well as how well it tasted. The service is slow (30-45 minutes) and there was hardly anyone there. I would recommend the restaurant but only if you had a solid hour and a half to kill."
