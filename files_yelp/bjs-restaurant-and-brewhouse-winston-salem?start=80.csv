Eleni F.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,7,,3.0,5/4/2016,Great food and friendly servers. I have been here a few times and have to say that each time it gets better. Need to work on speed of service with food.
Elizabeth M.,"Kernersville, NC",0,9,,2.0,6/12/2016,We made a reservation for 9 people a week in advance. We had no problems with the reservation. They seated us immediately even though very busy. The table was all set up for us. The service was excellent but the wait for the food was a bit long. Some people got excellent food. Some people got OK food. And 2 people got in-edible food. Both the sirloin steak and lemon thyme chicken were so heavily seasoned with salt and pepper you might as well dump the shakers in your mouth. The sirloin was sent back By the time a replacement came everyone else was done so we took a box. Many people were surprised by the amount of salt in the rice.
Meghan W.,"Clemmons, NC",0,3,,2.0,4/29/2016,"Two stars might be a stretch, but I'll give one star because the beer was good. And another star because the food was ok. this restaurant has the potential to be a great brew house and is not. I know it opened recently so I'm trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it took us 25 mins to get our beer. It wasn't busy so there's no excuse. Then one of our meals got messed up. The waitress realized it, walked away and didn't check in with us till the correct dish was delivered. The manager did take the charge off. Lots of room for improvement."
Landi R.,"Greensboro, NC",0,5,,1.0,5/18/2016,I have been here three times and each time a little more of a let down. The food is ok but nothing  I would drive to Winston for. The menu is a novel and hope to get a copy for my next beach trip.   While I love the beer here and have nothing bad to say about that.  The service every time I have been here has made me feel like I should be some where else. I feel rush and important. To day the server got my order wrong and did even come back to check. Into ask some one else to change it. I had to flag him down to get another drink. He has not once asked me if I needed anything. I would have stayed long and got another beer finished my work and then paid but he brought my bill that had one too many items. And then tried to take off the table before I even but my card in it.  I would come for a beer if I only wanted one and too much time to wait for it.
Richard H.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,7,,4.0,11/12/2016,Enjoy the flatbread pizza.  Big difference between servers.  Some are excellent and others need training.  Management needs to spend time on the floor checking on service.  The rating is high because of the food and some of the servers.  One visit with 8 people would have generated a ONE.
Kevin C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,1,1,1.0,4/30/2016,"We went when they first opened, Trainers from Texas were there, the service and food was good and served fairly fast. We invited friends to come the second time, the service , food and wait time was terrible. The food took over 2 hour's. The food was not the same as the first time, over cooked and less flavor. The staff unable to answer questions. The manager comped dinner and gave 25$ gift card.  We came back a month later still the same, 2 hour wait , food not prepared correctly, wrong order's, however the waitress was awesome. This restaurant needs proper training for staff, cooks , waitresses , and managers. The manager the night of the 25 th needs to know how to run staff and be more personable with customers. Sorry to be so harsh but unless something is done, this place will fail."
James F.,"Mocksville, NC",0,14,22,5.0,8/20/2016,Started off with a few tasty beer selections. There extreme pepperoni pizza Chicago deep dish pizza was delicious i will be back for more.
mark d.,"Tualatin, OR",26,29,,3.0,8/13/2016,"Beer prices are outrageous.  People shouldn't have to pay over 6 bucks for a local craft beer.  Cost of living is cheap here, so beer prices should be too."
Natalie N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",105,77,15,1.0,3/24/2016,"If I could give B.J.'s a lower rating, I would. My BF and I came into the restaurant mid-afternoon on Wednesday to check the place out. We had a seat at the Bar and when were begruddingly ""greeted"" by the bartender, I asked if there were any specials. She quickly replied ""No,"" and slid a couple of bar menus in our direction. Without opening the menu, by BF asked for a Michelob Ultra, and I asked for the same. Bartender: ""We don't have that. The equivalent would be B.J.'s ______ Brew."" So we both ordered that. She never checked back with us about how liked The B.J.'s ______ Brew, and while we were sitting there checking out the menu and looking around the restaurant, we noticed a board marked ""Specials"" to the right of the Bar. The bartender was either ill informed about the Specials for that day, or purposely sold us a couple of drinks that cost twice as much as what was advertised on her Specials board. It was obvious we were new patrons to the restaurant (as most would be since this place is new to Winston Salem) and she walked by us multiple times without checking on the brew she recommended or engaging us in the new restaurant concept. To add insult, to injury, she charged by BF's credit card for the tab twice. There is no doubt there are some kinks to be worked out any any new restaurant, but these ""missteps"" are the ABC's of employee training/education. There are a million places to eat in the B.J.'s vicinity, and hopefully people make this place work harder for their business."
Emily L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,1,,1.0,3/29/2016,"My first experience was not impressive.  The food is overpriced for the area.  I ordered a soup/salad combo- only 8.25 (which was almost the cheapest thing on the menu) and it was very small in size.  I left hungry.  The food was good, but not enough.   We walked in & was asked by hostess if we were in the BJ Loyalty Club - ""No"" this was our first time walking in the door.  The hostess didn't bother to tell us anymore.  Just asked us if the booth by the bar would be ok.   Our server made the experience worse.  We waited about 10 minutes before the server ever even came & spoke to us & when she did all she said was I'll be right back- that was 5 minutes later. She came, didn't explain anything out the history of BJ's or the custom made sodas or specials.  We overheard the server at the table beside of us explain in detail all of this.   I asked for my soup & salad to come out together with the rest of the tables food. Instead my soup came out way early by another server or food runner & I asked her to take it back so I could eat with the others.  When the others food came out delivered another server only my salad came out this time, with the wrong dressing.  Our server was busy with the table beside of us, but yet failed to come ask us when she was free if everything was ok w/our food.  I had to go get the manager to get them to correct my order.  Manager quickly corrected everything. Server brought my water refill after I had been empty for sometime & I had asked her for a refill.  We got our own to go boxes.  Seemed like everyone Except our server was waiting on us.  They did have 1/2 off deep dish pizzas - this was only good thing I can say & the food was pretty tasty.  They need to get better employees that actually learn about the restaurant."
Ashleigh C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,3,,4.0,7/9/2016,"The pizzas and beer are amazing! The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was super yummy, and a medium was more than enough for my husband and I to share. The Salted Caramel Pizoooki was the best part of the whole experience. So delicious! They had great house beer and offered free samples. The amber and hefeweizen were our favorites. The chips and salsa appetizer is bottomless. The service was great the first time we went and okay the second time. The menu is enormous and kind of overwhelming, and it is a little pricey, but the food is delicious!"
