Diana S.,"Land O Lakes, FL",60,27,5,4.0,1/10/2018,"I've been to a few different BJ's locations and this BJ's Brewhouse Lutz location continues the trend with great food and service! I've ordered the bison burger here on many occasions and it is always very lean and tasty. I have been to other restaurants where there bison burgers are really greasy. That is not the case here. The only time I've ever been slightly disappointed in a meal here was when I ordered the salad topped with ahi tuna. It looked nothing like the picture as far as the quantity of tuna. This salad was definitely lacking in that department, but the salad was fresh and tasty otherwise. I'll stick to the bison burger although there are many other options on this large menu! If you like beer this is the place for you! They have an incredible amount of taps which include their own beers, domestics, imports as well as craft beers of every kind. The back wall of the bar area is a large chalkboard where they list the different beers and they change frequently so that you always have new options most times when you visit. This location is fairly busy due to it being close to the interstate, in front of the outlet mall and simply in a more congested area of town. It's open for both lunch and dinner. If you have to wait for a table just know that it's worth it!"
Manny S.,"Tampa, FL",1,40,1,3.0,1/8/2018,"It seems like it doesn't matter what day you go, there is always a wait. Luckily, I placed my name on waiting list, so didn't have to wait the 40 minutes that everyone else was waiting.  Food: Ordered ribs, calamari, and a cucumber sparkling water. For dessert I had the monkey bread. Ribs were really dry. Seems like the quality of ribs has really gone down. Calamari was amazing! The monkey bread with ice cream was also delicious.  Service: they were busy, and food came out ok, but table kept getting crowded with used plates. Had to tell them to pick up our plates in two separate occasions.  Tip: sign up for app, they have but 1 get 1 specials through the year, as well as other specials. You can earn points and get $25, $10, $5, depending on points. Also, make sure to use app to get name on waiting list to avoid long wait."
R F.,"Riverview, FL",9,12,5,1.0,12/31/2017,"I really wouldn't give this place any stars!  Much to be desired although the food was edible, you couldn't taste the meat of the burger and although the waiter was polite, I don't enjoy getting rushed when eating especially when we had waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive!  Definitely the food was not worth the price we paid!  Very disappointed!"
Joseph D.,"Atlanta, GA",95,236,83,4.0,11/20/2017,"For those not familiar with BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, it's a restaurant chain with locations all over the United States, including a number of locations throughout Florida. With the newly built outlets bringing in so many people, it's probably a smart move to put a restaurant in close proximity as well. Anyway, the place itself looks really well done. Definitely has a nice presentation, especially in the bar area, and there are TVs everywhere for those sitting in booths or tables. We went on a Monday night and there were a good number of people watching football. I do appreciate BJ's having craft beers not only from themselves but also from breweries around Florida. They also have options from other breweries from around the US like Stone, Ballast Point, etc. I decided to go with the Brew Crew beer flight and the IPAs included in that specific flight were just okay - I've definitely had better. But the hefe and the blonde ale were pretty good. For 6.50, the flights are very well priced, especially for 20 ounces of beer. As far as the food goes, if you do get an appetizer, the calamari is pretty solid. There are daily specials and they have half off pizza on Mondays. You can either get a large deep dish pizza or a tavern pizza for half off. I ended up going with BBQ chicken deep dish, and it was decent. It was originally $26 and I probably wouldn't get it for that much, but it's not bad when it's half off on Mondays. I may have to go with the tavern pizza next time.  I didn't get dessert, but everyone talks about getting the pizookie if you still have room after dinner. It definitely looks good, and I'd probably give it a shot next time. Service was pretty good - the beer did take a bit to come out, but food came out quick. Our waitress did to forget to bring some things that we requested, but she got it promptly once we reminded her. It was pretty busy, so I'm sure service is great if it's not peak hours."
Gabe S.,"Tampa, FL",25,118,28,3.0,10/10/2017,I have eaten at the citrus park location before.  We wanted to try the brand new one on 54.  We had the siracha Russell sprouts.  I have to say that we were pretty disappointing.  They were lacking siracha sauce.  The plate had some at the bottom but the sprouts needed to be tossed some more with the sauce.  I was able to use some of the sauce on the bottom and the sprouts tasted delicious.  It just needed some more sauce and spices.  The sprouts were cooked perfectly tho.  I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp and spinach.  This plate was actually pretty good.  It was a good amount of food as well to be only 550 calories.  My wife had the barbacoa cauliflower tacos.  These are also pretty good to be a healthy meal.  I would say that just 2 tacos for the price is a little steep.   The new restaurant is very well laid out.  Bar is pretty big in size with a lot of table top tables around it.  Noise level was decent for this type of restaurant.  Parking was pretty good since this is right next to the outlet mall.  They also have a lot local beers and the ones they brew.  I did not have any but have heard good things.  I would recommend a visit if you have never tried a bj's restaurant.
Jon C.,"Toronto, Canada",21,359,47,4.0,12/16/2017,"It's been a while since I've visited a BJs and coming back it did not disappoint from what I remembered. First visited in the South, this time it seemed like best option around the outlet. Tasty and huge salads is what I remembered. And it still is! The staff were friendly and place is spacious. They have a very large variety of beer. It's not your hipster placed of beer, just simple beer of different varieties that could be passed off as craft. They have coloring for kids. And a lot of babies and kids seem to frequent here."
Valerie Z.,"Raleigh, NC",56,36,55,4.0,10/3/2017,"What an enjoyable dinner! After a day of outlet shopping we stopped in for dinner. Around 6 pm the place was hopping but there was no wait.  Ordered the brisket burger with sweet potato fries and omg...delicious! Others ordered call flatbread pizza, trio with couscous mac and cheese, beets and cauliflower. All were delicious! We signed up with the app and got a free pazzokie cookie. Yum!"
Cee P.,"Philadelphia, PA",51,5,19,5.0,11/11/2017,"I'm in love with BJ's in Wesley Chapel/Lutz. In short, I've come here with my husband on 2 additional occasions, both at different times of the day than today and all visits were on different days of the week. I just have to ask -- how can a restaurant have the exact same chef back there 24/7?! Lol! The food is delicious and tasting fresh... consistently! For traditionalists, there are familiar dishes to order. However, for a large portion of the menu, the food is creative in concept and flavor -- so this is definitely a fun place for a true foody to enjoy exploring. BJ's has yet to disappoint. Drink options: From soft drinks to the hot or iced-caffeinated beverages, the selection is pretty traditional. Alcoholic, wine and beer? This is called a brewery for a reason... bottom and top shelf is available --however, you cannot possibly make it here to ONLY drink... it's super hard to do! If you are a beer-drinker, though... I recommend the cherry-chipotle wings, bone-in, complimentary to any choice of beer--Scrumptious! Ambience & Decor: Personable, but open. The decor gives off an authentic brewery/warehouse feel, yet the varying booth options allow for all party sizes to receive the pleasure of feeling private. You have the TV tuned in to all of the exciting games for sports-lovers. The music is at a reasonable volume, so it's great for socializing or holding small, informal meetings (they have free wifi). Appropriate for all. You won't find a BJ's mascot ready to fill balloons with helium and pass them out for quick pics with the babes, but BJ's a great place to bring your kids during the daytime and in the evenings. No there's not a jungle gym, but the piZookie dessert is powerful enough to bring joy to children of all ages."
Jim K.,"Tampa, FL",161,251,254,4.0,7/31/2017,"Why 4 stars?  The service is always good.  The food is always good and it's better than you would expect!  The burgers are great, the chicken potstickers are amazing!  You have to try them.  You'll be thanking me later!  The California Club is really good.   Thanks, Jim"
Gary M.,"Riverview, FL",15,9,6,4.0,11/10/2017,"The food and beer were great and today being the Veterans holiday, me bing a Veteran my beer was complimentary. Always nice to see restaurants honor the brave men and women that served this country.  Service was also fantastic, never seem to be disappointed here. We will return here soon."
Bryttani H.,"Tampa, FL",90,116,266,2.0,11/27/2017,"Not the best BJ's experience.  I've been several BJ's in the past.  I generally go to the Citrus Park Mall Location every time I go to the mall.  I think I relate going to BJ's with when I'm done shopping.  This time I got a drink which is what I normally do.  We get a seat at the bar and both bartenders introduce themselves to us but don't offer to take our order.  Eventually they get around to it.  I ordered an old fashioned, which is probably one of the oldest cocktails My drink was disgusting it tasted like really bad cold medicine We ordered food and didn't have a good experience with that either.  We got a shareable the chips and queso.  The queso was warm not hot and not very tasty.  This experience has not turned me off of BJ's but I won't be going back to this location."
Scott K.,"Lutz, FL",20,26,57,2.0,11/24/2017,"Let me start this by saying I've been to the Bj's in citrus park and I like it. That being said this particular bj's doesn't live up to the other location. My girl got an old fashioned and there was something wrong with it. I think she forgot to add the bitters because it tasted like cough syrup. The muddled fruit looked more like a baby got sick in the glass. I don't usually write reviews with a negative theme, but I felt the need to warn people about this location. After the drinks we got chips and siracha dip, it made my and my girl's stomach hurt later that night. Don't give up hope though, if you like bj's try the one in citrus park mall."
Gail B.,"Crystal Lake, IL",8,33,13,3.0,9/19/2017,"The Wesley Chapel location is still pretty new, so when we had slow service and mediocre food, we decided to give it another chance.  It's just not a very good place. Too busy too loud too cold. Service was still super slow and again we just thought the food was okay. With so many places to choose from, pass this one up."
Akash J.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,19,,3.0,12/30/2017,"I went there on Wednesday with my family. It was the first time we had been there. The wait was about 25 minutes and that was being on the waiting list. The food was okay, nothing special but overall a nice evening."
Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1503,8670,4.0,11/30/2016,They have the big board indicated the brewery on the tap when you walk in. Some beer is interesting from other states. BJ has been open for business not long ago. I have their food at Gainesville before. Now they are close to my neighborhood.  We have ordered the pan seared salmon with quinoa and seared tuna salad. Their R and D did a good job to come out the menu. It is very likable. The tuna is seasoning and seared outward. The salad has good dressing and good selection of ingredients. Crispy wonton skin and pickle ginger add the flavor to the salad.  The salmon is almost like blacken outside with good spice. The quinoa is well cook. I like this dish the most. At the end we added the monkey bread with ice cream. Like cinnamon roll top with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Call ahead for putting your name in the wait list will cut down wait time by half. Paying process is quick close up.
Jerry M.,"Boerne, TX",252,145,77,4.0,9/14/2017,"I have eaten at BJ's in San Antonio at lest 3 times and have never enjoyed the the food & experience as I did here. The food was excellent the ambiance was almost festive. We had a great time even though we have no power at home.  I should say most of the restaurants in this area are doing limited menu's since the supply of food is slow in coming.  We only had a 20min wait and I started with an ice cold draft beer and ordered the fried calamari and bang-bang shrimp. They came out quickly with the drinks. The calamari was fresh crunchy and o'so good. The shrimp was a little spicy but not as much as my Son likes them. My son & I both ordered a full rack of baby back ribs , wife ordered the Asian salad and my DIL ordered fish and chips.  Everything started to arrive at the same time and the smell was intoxicating not to mention the enormous amount of food. We took our time since we are completely out of power. We met and talked to the table next to ours. We did manage to eat at least 90% of the ribs. This is side I hardly see in San Antonio"
Jennifer H.,"San Jose, CA",4,83,20,4.0,6/22/2017,"It can get busy at times, but there's something for everyone! I am not sure if BJ's have changed their menu (it was not this extensive when I discovered them in college nor do I remember a lot of it from my visit to the Citrus Park location a couple of years ago). Anyway, there's delicious fried goodness as well as dishes for the health nuts (quinoa, avocado, etc.) not to mention pizza! Don't forget to save room for a pazookie (a giant hot cookie topped with ice cream). My colleagues are a fan of their beer selection, and none of us have ever been disappointed with the food. Of note: -Avocado Egg Rolls -Crisp Potato Skins Platter -Roasted Portobello and Asparagus Salad -New Roasted Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa Bowl -Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs -ANY Pazookie :) The service and atmosphere are great. If you go on a Friday or Saturday, try to get in before 5pm; otherwise, you will have to wait for forever. And if you have a large party, note that you all have to be there before you can be seated."
Ruth F.,"Ocala, FL",4,17,55,5.0,10/14/2017,....and I'm back again! I wish we have one BJ's Restaurant in Citrus county. Their food is to die for. Absolutely delicious!
Nan T.,"Gainesville, FL",16,315,2430,4.0,9/4/2017,"Have yet to decide if it's a true 4-star restaurant, but it's close enough. To date, it's my favorite BJ's-- it has high ceilings that are creatively fascinating, a large open concept (three square sections w/ no full dividing walls), a modern & lighted bar area, a selection of 51 beers listed on the wall, & a variety of booths. (Ours was spacious, comfortable & open on each end; access was easy.) The dining area appeared clean & modern. Service was very good after our 20 min wait to be seated. Overall, the food was above average. The Avocado Egg Rolls appetizer was beyond excellent-- & beyond fattening (1,060 calories). My ""enlightened"" lower cal meal (520) was well-seasoned & filling-- Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. (See pic.) The bowl of Tuscan Tomato Bisque was excellent, although high in calories-- 560. (See pic.) The Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos entree was good as well (See pic.), but contained just one candied pecan piece, & the side of sweet potato fries was flavorful, but not in large supply. (It's doubtful this $10.99 two taco meal would satisfy a hungry man.) This business is close to the entrance of a very busy shopping area (Tampa Premium Outlets), but there are considerable parking spaces. Even though BJ's extensive multi-page menu can be a stress inducer, I won't hesitate to return. The ambiance here is phenomenal."
Helen L.,"Tampa, FL",327,453,2093,3.0,3/20/2017,"I thought it would be a good idea to come by here for dinner the other night with the family. It was so busy and the wait was rather frustrating. Otherwise, service was friendly and decent if you are forgiving that things took longer to come (or not at all) since they're so busy (food, water, extra utensils....). They also kept running out of supplies (kids drink cups, soup to go containers)... better stock up!  The seating were great since there were booth and table seating. I had really wanted a highchair but gave it up for a booster seat when I found out that I was going to be put back on the waiting list.  Their strawberry lemonade was tasty and I asked them to keep it coming. Haha. I ended up with the Mahi Mahi tacos (came with 2) and the side of chips and I was content. I just wished it didn't take forever for us to have the meal."
shannon k.,"Estacada, OR",0,32,20,5.0,11/15/2017,#grandcru & #bartenderkristin are the best parts of BJ's.... hit the happy hour for some divine bevies & great service !!!! Thank you Kristin
Larry L.,"Tampa, FL",2,15,3,4.0,12/9/2017,Very good for a chain. Nice gluten free options. The service was good. Prices not bad.
Jim B.,"Fenway/Kenmore, Boston, MA",10,6,9,5.0,11/22/2017,Excellent food!  Attentive server and refreshing LS on housemade Root Beer. Who could ask for more!
Kara D.,"Rockledge, FL",2,11,2,2.0,12/26/2016,"To start off, the service was great for our takeout/curbside order. The service is the redeeming part of this experience... We had placed an online order for a custom pizza with five cheese, mushroom, onion, no red sauce, and olive oil. This is the result of that order...severely disappointed in the kitchen at this restaurant (not our first time being disappointed). We thought we would give them another chance but won't be doing that again.  Hoping the kitchen will catch up with the customer service in the front of the house sooner than later."
Joseph M.,"Land O Lakes, FL",211,18,4,5.0,9/2/2017,We have eaten here several times. Food and service are pretty good. I've tried several of their dishes and have been satisfied with the portion and quality. Plus they have tons of different beers!
Liz M.,"Tampa, FL",12,35,125,3.0,6/5/2017,"The service at the Lutz location is great! The food is  pretty descent, though it is a chain restaurant, so don't expect something out of this world. Overall, I have been pleased with the level of attention and service I have receive when I visit this location and would recommend it, especially after a busy shopping day at the outlets! (If you are into avocados, try the avocado egg rolls)"
Kristi R.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",3,48,16,5.0,10/16/2017,I have dined here several times. Each time I have enjoyed the experience. The food I have tried has always been good. What I really love is their beer selection. Definitely worth a stop if you're by the outlet mall.
Amy K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",310,449,1708,5.0,11/1/2016,"Stopped by here with a friend today for lunch and I am so glad I did! I live close by and forgot that they had opened at the Outlet Mall in Wesley Chapel. I had been to a BJ's in St Augustine last year and had a nice experience, but this visit blew me away! While this location is still new and establishing itself as an asset in the area, the staff did a great job of doing everything possible to have us enjoy our visit.  FOOD: OMG really good! Large portions cooked to perfection and so flavorful. We ordered the boneless wings (garlic parm with a side of EXXXXtra hot buffalo sauce!), Chips with Piranha Pale Ale Chili Queso and the beef sliders with fries. We ordered wayyyyyy too much and have tons of leftovers. The amount of wings they give you for $10.95 is outstanding! They were crunchy and large in size. While I did not find the buffalo sauce to be deemed EXXXXtra hot...it was tasty and I took some home. The sliders were really good too for $10.50, although the mini buns were too large for the meatball size of a patty that was on it. Still good, plus the fries were under $2 to add on and had that crispy battered Burger King-like texture on the outside. Finally, the chips with chili queso dip were on par ($5.95). The queso was made with BJ's own Piranha Pale Ale and the chips tasted house made. There was plenty to go around and the chips are unlimited. YUM! Last but not least, my friend signed up for their rewards program and instantly got a free Pizookie which is a little cookie topped with ice cream. We sampled the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was outstanding! DRINKS: They have something for everyone here! Full bar and plenty of craft drafts to choose from. Prices are great in my opinion. I started with a flight of their house beers (4 beers, 5 oz. each for $7.95). I had the Hopstorm IPA, Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red and the Berry Burst Cider. Can't complain about any of them. I also had a fusion drink with Jeremiah Red and Berry Burst Cider which was delicious! Beers are between $5-$7. I don't believe they brew on premises.  Our servers (one in training and one was the trainer) were polite, cheerful and accurate. They let us know up front that they would be working together for training purposes. They were fantastic and I look forward to receiving their service in the future! According to my check, one was named Kristina H and I hope she and her training partner will be commended for their wonderful attitudes and hospitality! Clean restaurant with awesome staff and certainly a great place to bring your friends and family. I will definitely be back!"
Rania G.,"Beverly Hills, FL",68,166,149,5.0,10/26/2016,"This restaurant has always been good to me, and is a solid 4.5 stars, but since the first few reviews have been a bit harsh for this location, I feel like being generous. I have never opened a restaurant, but I would imagine it must be hard - no matter how much training - to open a new place with all new employees and be perfect right out of the gate.  First thing I need to say is that they are, hands down, the most allergen friendly restaurant I have been to so far. They have a comprehensive list of all their foods and an easy to read chart with all the major allergens (not just wheat). Now, they do have a separate, just gluten free menu, but for those that have other allergies, this chart is amazing. I ordered a broccoli cheese soup cup as a starter, and it was creamy, rich, and flavorful (and huge, not the typical ""cup"" size). I ordered a side house salad with Italian dressing, and it was fresh and a good size. For the meal I got a gluten free pizza with various toppings. It was not the best gluten free crust I have had flavor-wise, but it was still pretty good. My friends got the deep dish baked ziti (which I was told was flavorful and creamy in a good way) and the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs (and they weren't exaggerating, those balls were like grapefruits). For an appetizer they shared the crisp potato skins, and informed me they were very thick cut and therefore very heavy.  Service was fast and friendly. The manager also came by to assure me that they would respect my allergy to wheat and eggs and that everything would be safe to eat. That was a nice touch, because eating out has become a scary unknown, and his promise really did take a load off my shoulders. I hope people are not swayed by some of the early reviews and give them a chance, they are really trying and as far as American food chains go, this is one of the better ones."
Paul L.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,4,,5.0,10/30/2017,"OK. I do not understand the poor reviews. I have been going to BJs up and down the East coast for over 10 years, and never had a problem. Their beer - 'nuff said. The happy hour prices and quality is the best in Land O Lakes / Wesley Chapel. We are here once or twice a week. My only observation - floor managers need to pay MORE attention to restrooms - no TP at 4pm? in ladies room. Otherwise, I recomend this place as a top notch."
Mel K.,"Tampa, FL",4,29,10,2.0,10/6/2017,"Reviewed this place before. I find the food good, ribs great. But the service is unfortunately consistently slow.... it doesn't matter what time of day, it's gonna take a while to get the food out of the kitchen. And your server will take forever to bring refills on your drinks and yes I'm still waiting for my ketchup. The training and the encouragement of the serving staff to follow-up and stay alert is lacking.... Came back for another visit  Used their preferred waitlist to make my reservations. When I got there, I was told even though I made reservations online it would be a 20 minute wait. I asked and was told that if I didn't make reservations, it would be a 45 minute wait.   Bottom line the 20 minute turn out to be 45 minutes anyway, same as people who didn't make reservations  Their baby back ribs are good so is the prime rib. With out them it's hard to justify putting up with the disarray that this restaurant allows....  There where 4 of us today 3 of us got our food correctly served, mine was wrong. Took 20 minutes for correct food to come out... everyone else was finishing eating. Server apologized manager never came over.... from the time we made reservations to the time we got our food and finished eating was almost 3hours management does not have a handle on how disarrayed service is, for example during the course of our meal at least 4 servers brought food to our table asking if we ordered what they were serving. Then had to go to the computer to figure out what table ordered what ever they were serving. Food is good, service poor, reservation system poor...  they could and should do better"
Sara G.,"Riverview, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2017,"All around bad experience. We ""called ahead"" via their app, but still waited over an hour. Then we were told ""sorry our app doesn't tell you that we don't take call ahead for large parties"". That was not helpful. Our servers were ok, they took our orders as two separate tickets (we were a group of 11) and so half the table received their food 10 minutes before the other half.  Now all of that would have been ok, except for the food. 1. A medium rare steak came out well done. When they remade it, it was rare and took 20 minutes to bring back out. 2. Another steak tasted like dirty grill. 3. Corn dog nuggets were so over cooked you could not bite into them. When remade they were much the same and they took so long, we just took them to go. 4. The fish and chips fish - one piece of the fish was good, the others over cooked. Finally, at least one person has FOOD POISONING!  Just stay away."
Arlene H.,"Lutz, FL",261,61,113,4.0,10/18/2016,"My friend and I went on opening night and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoy a good beer but their Cosmo's were the best. Even though they were very busy we got our food out quickly and it was excellent. Our server Kristin was amazing!!!  She was knowledgeable of all the different items on the menu and all the drinks on tap. My friend is actually going to be going back tonight with her honey and using an app that will have her food and drink ready as soon as she sits down. I think that's pretty cool!!! Oh, and by the way, she will be requesting Kristin as her server!"
Greg T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",98,42,41,5.0,10/1/2017,"First time here.    I'd come back. Never heard of BJ's, in town for the football game and ran across BJ's.  Good food, hot, and great service!!!"
Teri L.,"Tampa, FL",21,33,5,4.0,6/20/2017,"I'm giving this place such a high rating due to the selections of beer. Because beer makes me happy; especially craft beer. Variety is the spice of life and I'm willing to give most brews at least one try. Fruit flavored beers are my favorite so I get the Jerry Burst if I'm not feeling super fancy. It's a mixture of a berry cider and Jeremiah Red. Delicious. Sounds crazy, but I love it.  Their pizza is really good. The crust isn't too thick/thin and has just the right amount of crunch for me. I love the meat lovers, pepperoni, and chicken bacon ranch.   The burgers are pretty good. So is the club sandwich.  And if you are getting dessert, get a pizookie. I always get the white chocolate macadamia one. It's a fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top. It comes in mini and regular size. I always get the mini bc of all the food and beer I consume while there.  This is one chain I don't mind recommending"
Bob L.,"Palm Harbor, FL",101,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,Got food poisoning here! I ordered their chicken wings.  I was violently ill for 48 straight.  Emailed them and didn't even get a reply. Clearly they are careless and don't care.  Wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place. Can I give less than 1 star?
Maura P.,"Lutz, FL",35,25,169,5.0,5/2/2017,"I give this place 5 stars because I never had a bad experience.   Service is always great, food is always delicious,  and beer is super cold.   Today I decided to try something from their light menu so I ordered the Roasted Salmon Peruvian Quinoa Bowl.  I knew it was a gamble ordering salmon at a non-seafood place, but it was... D E L I C I O U S !"
Michelle S.,"New Tampa, Tampa, FL",19,13,3,2.0,10/6/2017,"The food is good but the service is excruciatingly slow.  I have been a few times and each time the same, you need an entire evening set aside for this place because it always takes upwards of 3 hours."
Tizzy M.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,6,4.0,12/5/2016,"Knowing this location is new I decided to wait to visit so they could work out the kinks. My husband and I finally were able to visit on Black Friday. We were immediately seated since it was 9 pm. Our service was fantastic. Our waitress suggested a few beers for me to try, my favorite being the Grand Cru.  Our meal was paced correctly and we never waited long for drinks.  We shared an order of potstickers and they were great!  My husband had the Italian vegetable pasta with added blackened chicken and I had the pulled pork sandwich. We both really enjoyed our dinners and the portions are huge!  Food great. Service great. Beer great!  Now the negative, do not order a Moscow mule here. It's terrible. Not only is it terrible but the bar doesn't stock regular ginger beer. They only have alcoholic ginger beer so you have to pay for your ginger beer ($5) on top of your mule. But if you order more than one you'll have enough ginger beer for a second and they bring you the ginger beer.  I know it's a beer place but they have a liquor bar. They should stock ginger beer. Heck Stoli gives it to bars for free!"
Randy K.,"Tampa, FL",29,29,3,3.0,3/16/2017,"Well, we have been to BJ's twice now, so here is what we think. The good: BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long. The bad: BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long. BJ's is one of those restaurants that cannot decide if it is a steakhouse, a brew house, an Italian restaurant, a pizza parlor, a rib joint, or a burger place. As is so frequently the case with restaurants that try to do so many things, it ends up not doing any of them very well. The servers seem to have a lot of trouble answering questions, because there is such a massive amount to remember. Frequently they have to pass such tough questions as ""can I get that with mushrooms"" on to the kitchen manager, who appears to be in a black hole from which your server may never return. On to the food. First visit we had salmon, which had a very nice flavor but was a bit over cooked. This time we first ordered calamari as an appetizer,which was nicely battered and fried with good marinara and horseradish dipping sauces. We then both ordered the rib eyes, each medium rare. The cooking was fine. The quality of the meat was terrible. We have been around a good while, and these were the toughest, most gristly rib eyes we have ever eaten, or at least tried to eat. When we arrived home, Rex the amazing wonder dog ended up eating most of them. He thought they were great. Then again, he eats cat litter. Grandson had a burger and fries, which he gave his 8 year old's thumbs up to. If the ketchup on his face was any measure, both must have been good. Beer selection was wide but not more than the average brew house. So all in all, a great big mediocre for BJ's. If you are in the area of the Outlet Mall In Wesley Chapel, there are numerous other places to choose from. Think about them. Think about them hard."
