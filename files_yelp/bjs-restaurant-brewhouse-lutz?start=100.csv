Mike B.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",2,3,,5.0,12/9/2016,"Definitely worth a visit. Great beer and bourbon selection, good food and ambiance. Only Glory Days Grill competes in all three categories locally."
Kim H.,"Land O Lakes, FL",26,1,,5.0,1/14/2017,"Food was great and our server, Dejah, was friendly and attentive. She made sure my meal alteration was done correct and our drinks were always full. Best service we've had."
Katie P.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,7,1,4.0,7/15/2017,Fabulous happy hour. Food is great and love their specials. Gets a bit busy now but worth the wait. Also love their take out.
Sam F.,"Tampa, FL",0,15,3,4.0,11/19/2016,"I was happy with everything till the end when the bill came. 6 bucks for a draft beer. Get outta here! Other than that the food was great, the service was good, the place itself was very nice. I'd go back but I wouldn't get any beer there again."
Parthiv P.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,5,,5.0,12/30/2016,"The Food and Service were great. Salad for my friend was very dry. Asked the server and he took it back and served the replacement of our choice. We paid for the replacement. We did not ask for any refund for the dry salad dish, without making any fuss they took it off my bill."
Jose E.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",21,9,,2.0,12/18/2016,Food is good but the wait time is outrageous. You can call ahead for reservations but they fail to inform that you may still have to wait around even if you show up on time. This outweighs the good. Hopefully customer service improves soon
Nikki F.,"Odessa, FL",42,15,12,4.0,12/16/2016,Absolutely love the fact that this is bear my home. I LOVE BJ'S restaurant and the pizookies. Very good food and very good service. Went there on the first week they opened and noticed how well the servers got acclimated to working at a busy restaurant. Would advise on calling ahead and making reservations though because it can get really busy!
John L.,"Lutz, FL",36,193,380,2.0,3/18/2017,Ordered the pizza to go was ready when promised but seems like they forgot the tomato sauce or something not up to the standards of other BJ's I've been too
David B.,"Land O Lakes, FL",46,5,,4.0,11/28/2016,"Been here a few times. They just opened and good dining is a premium in this area, so it's always packed. There's been a few mistakes, but the management has bent over backwards to make it right. It's my favorite place to eat in the area, I mean unless you want McDonalds or Chili's."
Melissa K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,5,1,4.0,11/26/2016,Food was very good especially for a chain restaurant.  Service was a little slow. Overall a good experience though.
Lindsey B.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",144,9,,5.0,2/8/2017,"Tonight was our first visit and everything was so good! We had zero wait time to be seated which was nice since we were expecting at least some wait time. My son has food allergies and they have an allergen menu which was extremely helpful with ordering for him. We normally don't go out to eat very much because it takes a long time to communicate with the waiter/waitress and chef to see if there's something he can eat, but BJ's was prepared for customers with allergies and extremely helpful and accommodating. That in of itself makes it worth it to come back regularly for us. Our waitress was fantastic and really helpful. She told us near the end that it was her first night serving and we were impressed because we couldn't tell. She was very well trained and just a super nice person. The food was delicious! I ordered the Mahi tacos and the husband ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. Everything was really enjoyable and we will definitely be back!"
Jennifer P.,"Nokomis, FL",74,1,,2.0,11/21/2016,Pricey and not worth the money. Received sandwich that had definitely been sitting a while. The cheese had already started to harden. My husband's brisket sandwich was also cold. The beer and garlic knots were good though.
Nick M.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",0,37,11,2.0,3/16/2017,"$5 drinks is wonderful, if they didn't run out of ribs at 730pm on Thursday.  Wings and pazookie are good.  One time I got marinara instead of salsa lmao"
Jared A.,"Land O Lakes, Land O Lakes, FL",0,7,2,4.0,3/25/2017,I like the broccoli cheese soup.  I usually order a sandwich to go with it.  We also like the flat bread pizza.  The service can be hit or miss depending on the server you get.
Sammy K.,"Land O Lakes, FL",0,9,,2.0,1/28/2017,"It's not my favorite place , all the family got the runs after dinner, food was late and came out cold, great service and Mgmt."
Elizabeth L.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,5.0,3/9/2017,The service was great and fast. I started with the fried calamari and it was amazing. I highly recommend the pizookie trio for dessert. Definitely coming back.
M.W. T.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,3,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Thought we would give this location another try after our last very disappointing experience.  How do you give a restaurant a bad review on take out? Went to pick up my order and waited 8 minutes at the take out booth just to be acknowledged (there wasn't a lounge either).  I did see what looked like two managers walk by me with no acknowledgement from either.  They also appear to have atleast three  hostesses standing around chit chatting with each other.  Why don't they have one of the extra hostesses assist take out? Either way I see their customer service hasn't improved.  The food may be decent,but eventually poor management and customer service will doom this place.  Once again management doesn't  seem to care. Our first experience the waitress offered to microwave our cold food,and even then the manager didn't seem to concerned."
Patrick H.,"Brandon, FL",132,44,,5.0,1/22/2017,"This is a brewpub chain that actually cares and serves good food.  The service was great, and so was the food.  I don't give a lot of 5's, but the appetizers were very good.  We got the Poke Tuna, and Fried artichokes.  They poke was good quality, I just wish it had some sauce, as it was more sashimi.  The Fried Artichokes were great, as I enjoy the taste but hate scraping them with my teeth.  These were fried balls of the flesh with a tasty sauce.  My wife got a salad she said was great.  I got the hangover burger, and it was awesome.  Excellent burger with a fried egg on it and a super tasty chile verde sauce that I am craving while I write this.  Our server let us talk up a storm, timed the food servings well, and kept the drinks full."
Wilbur F.,"Lutz, FL",0,3,,1.0,4/21/2017,"Not a place for larger groups based on my experience. We had a group of about twenty people. One server was assigned to take all the orders. When, much later, the food finally arrived, we were subjected to a ""food auction"" - ""OK, Who had the chicken sandwich?"". Food was passable but the service, not so much."
Dave F.,"Tampa, FL",6,40,,1.0,11/12/2016,a disaster from beginning to end.  the front of house couldn't get their story straight.  quoting different times seating people out of order creating a terrible first impression.  overall service was very slow and they got 3 of our 5 meals wrong and really made no attempt to make it up. prices are high for the food.  it was ok nothing spectacular.  I know they are new but they have a LONG way to go before I will go back.
