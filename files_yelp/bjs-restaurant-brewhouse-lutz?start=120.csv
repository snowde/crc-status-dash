Sam R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1,21,,5.0,3/11/2017,Amazing food. Good selection and fast service.  A little wait but well worth it. Give it a try
Hien H.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,The service was horrible. Long wait for food and ended up with our entrees before our appetizers and didn't even receive silverware . The food was cold and way too salty . Definitely never coming back .
Tiffany G.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2017,I have been looking forward to checking this place out since it has opened. Finally my fiancée and I had a free night and decided to go sit at the bar. The bartender was extremely rude.. he seemed bothered by not only my beer choice but our presence In general. He said he works every Tuesday night so if I give it another shot at least I know which night to avoid!
Jeffrey B.,"Tampa, FL",6,8,,1.0,11/3/2016,"Kitchen staff should be fired! Salads showed after inedible meal. Manager apologized but did not fix. 3-4 hostesses doing nothing in the front. Maybe if they can fix the kitchen. Until then, not coming back."
Benjamin B.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,,2.0,10/21/2016,"Won't be back, but not because of the service or the food, both were good. However, we ordered a pizza came out wrong waited over an hour to have them bring another one out and all we got was a half ass apology from their manager who turned around mid sentence and walked away. Did not take it off our bill or attempt to fix the situation. Literally just walked away and when she finally decided to come back our server had to correct her because she didn't remember what we had."
Scott H.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",0,5,,5.0,2/5/2017,Best meal and service we've had out in a long time. Keep it BJ's and we'll be regular customers!
Jocelyn E.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,,2.0,1/28/2017,"Went here today for Lunch. My husband and I were quoted a 20-25 min wait to be seated. We were seated at the 20 min mark. Like your text system for that. The wait is not what got the low stars.  We were seated and our order taken within a few minutes of being seated. Our waitress stopped by our table around the 15 mins mark wait for food to tell us that our food was about to be out. After waiting another 15 mins our food did not come out. We kept waiting another 10 mins went by our waitress came by finally and apologized for how long it was taking... I really don't like it when the wait staff says its going to be out soon and it's not, make sure you are 100% sure before promising that. We waited another 10 mins and finally our food was out. Now getting to the food.  Overall the food was okay, I got the fish tacos(mahi mahi and shrimp taco, my husband got a soup in a bread bowl. The mahi mahi taco was delicious the shrimp taco was a little lacking in flavor. What I really disliked about my order was the salsa and guacamole(not sure what it was but it looked like a sad attempt at guac) The guac had a weird consistency almost like tooth paste I didn't even want to try it. The salsa was okay. My husband enjoyed his soup and bread bowl, but we both agreed it probably wouldn't be a place we would be back to anytime soon."
Catherine C.,"Tampa, FL",89,2,,5.0,12/16/2016,"Excellent service, thank you, Kat,  for making sure everything was perfect with our Take Out order! We appreciated the nice greeting from your manager Mike, as well!!"
Matt J.,"Wetumpka, AL",0,1,,5.0,1/7/2017,"Waiter Ryan at Bjs was great.  He was always answering questions, quick and took care of us.  Great experience"
Rob M.,"Lutz, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/4/2016,Service was terribly slow. Canceled our order for waters and soda and an appetizer and walked out. Staff has a long way to go. Management doesn't seem to be overly involved.
Margie L.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,3,,1.0,11/15/2016,Absolutely no idea how to do business. We reserved a table for 14 3 weeks in advance set it up with manager of restaurant  called to confirm 2 days before the dinner was told everything  was in computer and they would be ready for us on Tuesday at 630 we showed up early to make sure that the  table was ready and was told we had no reservation.Mngr came out and said don't worry we will do all we can you won't  know there was a problem well you can't throw people out of course so we had to wait we were given chips and salsa for our trouble and crowded into what tables were open while we waited for another table to leave so we would be comfortable.Service was mediocre took forever to get bar drinks had food before silverware and never did get points on app so even though it was my third time here and the first 2 visits were good this was mine and my sisters birthday and it was horrible so this is what I will remember 2 and a half hours of crap
