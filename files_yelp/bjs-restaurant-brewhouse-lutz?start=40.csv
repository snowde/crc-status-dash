CL R.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,20,12,2.0,7/23/2017,I've been to BJ's once before at citrus park and it was excellent. This exp was the worst. We were all out of a family dinner and every single person didn't like their food except for one and she got deep dish rigatoni. We had the sante fe salad and it left a lot to be desired. The shrimp and quinoa dish was ok and that's being generous. The server was semi rude and seemed like she could care less we were there. I'm not sure what happened Bc I planned the dinner and was so excited to take the fam there but I certainly won't be back. The apps we got were mozz sticks and avocado rolls. Mozz sticks were cold. Cold!!! The avocado rolls were cold and all of the avocado was brown and mushy. I wouldn't waste my time or money here.
Ramesh P.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,6,,5.0,6/29/2017,"No matter which one of these BJ's you go to, the service is great. I highly recommend BJ's.  Also the wlecoming of guests are great.  Price is not bad as well. 100% recommend"
Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,269,3.0,2/6/2017,"A pretty standard fare chain location of BJs.  It is the newest location in the Tampa area near the new outlets, and attracts quite the crowds on weekends.  We had a fairly short wait when going in on a recent Saturday night.  Their menu is plentiful and anyone is sure to find something that peaks their interest given the multitude of options.  On our visit the waiter we had wasn't very chatty or personable and didn't seem overly enthused to be at work.  All in all a pretty decent place to stop in if you want some standard food options."
Duffy H.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,18,,5.0,5/20/2017,"We're fans, and stop in 2-3 times a month. Favorite items are many, including chicken tortilla soup (best either of us have ever tasted), mozzarella and tomato salad, nacho flatbread (ask for Santa Fe dressing on the side and drizzle it on top), fried artichokes with lemon aioli, Brewhouse Blonde fish and chips, parmesan crusted chicken, California club chicken sandwich, southern fried chicken and more. Our 11-yr-old grandson liked the hickory brisket and bacon burger and our 8-yr-old pizza lover really likes the puffy mini cheese pizza on the kids menu. He says it's better than Chili's, which was his previous fave. Both kids highly recommend the fries, which are pretty fine.  We think the spaghetti and meatballs aren't as good as they were 10 yrs ago, and we were sad to find that Santa Fe spring rolls are no longer on the menu. If you want some that are virtually identical, head to Glory Days Grill and mix a little chipotle bbq sauce into ranch dressing for the sauce. Chili's version is ok, but Glory Days are just like BJ's were."
Alicia C.,"Orlando, FL",74,24,41,3.0,6/26/2017,"Ah, BJ's. I always hope it will be wonderful, and sometime it is. But oh, when it is bad, it is horrid. First, the menu. Delicious choices all around, from pizza to salads to grilled entrees. The menu descriptions always tempt me, but the problem is the consistency of the food itself. One item, for example, was both my favorite and one reason I avoided BJ's for a period of time. The Ahi Tuna Salad when I first had it was an absolute delight. The tuna pieces were perfectly seared, and the salad was fresh with a light, slightly sweet sesame vinaigrette that set off the tuna perfectly. I was besotted with the salad. I came back the next day to have it again. Delicious, yet again. Excited, I brought my fiancee late one evening after a show. ""You have to try the Ahi Tuna Salad,"" I said. He obeyed, as all good fiancees should. And then, guess what? The perfect salad disintegrated into the most horrid pile of sludge. The ahi was not in perfect slabs of tuna goodness. Oh, no. They were mushed together pieces of raw fish that looked like they had been run over by a semi a few times before being put on the plate. Gone was the slightly sweet vinaigrette. In its place was a pickle-like melange of veggies that were so tart that it was impossible to eat. It was inedible. And what did the server say about the situation? ""That's the way the salad always is."" Nope. Not good enough. I didn't order fish mash on top of pickles. I ordered the salad I've had twice before from the same kitchen. On the other hand, it can be fantastic. The lunch specials are especially good deals, especially the unlimited soup and salad. The offerings are tasty, and it's a great way of getting a taste of what BJ's has to offer. Again, the food can be uneven. More than once, the mozzarella salad has arrived to my table partially frozen, which isn't the most appetizing of lunch items. When it's good, however, it's very good. The tomato soup is out of this world, and the chili is spicy enough to keep my interest. The wedge salad can have a bit too much dressing, but it's also consistently good. Really, that's the only reason I go to BJ's at all: the unlimited soup and salad is such a good deal that it's worth the risk, especially for that tomato soup. Second, the service. Sigh. Service is simple: greet me within a couple of minutes, keep my drink refilled, and take my order promptly. At BJ's, getting all three of those things is iffy at best. Some servers are terrific. Some appear not to want to be bothered if you're not ordering alcohol. Some appear new to the waiting tables game. Others appear to have been doing it too long. Regardless, you never know who will step up to your table. I'm giving this place a 3 star review because on occasion, like my experience today, the food is good and the service is outstanding. Today, my drink was refilled constantly, the app worked correctly on my phone (it's a 50/50 chance you'll be able to use it without a manager needing to manually type in your membership number), and the soup and salad were stellar. The unevenness, however, makes me hesitate to recommend it to others, even with the sometimes great food and service."
Jefferson R.,"San Antonio, FL",0,3,,4.0,11/16/2017,"A nice discovery in an area that is not loaded with good restaurants. The Brewhouse does not rush you and I found the atmosphere and the service to be good.  I really enjoyed the entre of salmon, asparagus and spinach and the draft beer hit the spot.  My partner and I are elderly and this is a nice place to eat from 3 p.m. on when it gets dark early this time of year and the place is not crowded.  BJ's and the Bone Fish Grill are the only two restaurants we enjoy so far in east Pasco County."
Bill G.,"Lutz, FL",25,55,97,3.0,7/9/2017,"I absolutely love this place! Food is very good.... beer is cold and a great variety. Facility is clean. Service is extremely inconsistent.  I have been to this location several times and each time it is like going to a different restaurant.  For the first time we had a great server Rachel!  Although the service was slow she was great.   Again out order was wrong,  but she actually caught it before we could say anything.   She apologized and coolrrected it immediately.  Not sure if the problem is corporate or local management but someone needs to address the inconsistency in everything from service to portion size to timing.  Overall if you have time it is worth the wait, but don't go starving or you may not make it before you are initially served.  12 minutes from sitting to getting my beer."
Omar R.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",38,3,1,5.0,9/1/2017,"Our kids ghot awarded a free meal for student of the month, Kudos to BJs for contributing, our server was Krystyna she was very upbeat and helped us navigate the menu,she was extremely busy but was very very attentive to our table, also very helpful with the beer sampler kit, the wings are awesome and everyone's meal was phenomenal trust I dipped into everyone's platter lol! Thank you Krystyna R. for your awesome cust service!!"
Joel H.,"Tampa, FL",247,322,314,4.0,11/23/2016,"I don't get the lack of love for this place (currently a two star rating). I've eaten at two star restaurants. I've even eaten at a two star BJ's before. This location is leaps and bounds above that. A two star BJ's makes you wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though the restaurant is have full. Every time I've visited the Lutz location (three currently) I've gotten in and seated within a reasonable amount of time even though every booth (and the bar) was full.  A two star BJ's has a very inattentive server and kitchen staff who brings out the wrong order, does not work around dietary restrictions (despite their menu saying they will) and leaves your glass empty for most of the meal. At this BJ's the server is checking on us constantly. My glass of water remains full for the duration of the evening. The longest I waited for it to be refilled was two minutes. When I order the Brussels Sprouts, I get the honey sricha sauce on the side. Not once have they failed to clarify my order and bring it out correctly. As for the taste of the sprouts, whoa doggy. Nicely charred and crispy and tossed in oil. Better Brussels Sprouts than I've had at any other Tampa restaurant. Even my meat eating, butter loving, fat indulging friends can't keep their hands off them (and that's without the sauce, who knows how it would be if they offered a vegan sauce for those sprouts). For my main course, I am enamored with BJ's vegan lentil soup. I've eaten it both as a bread bowl (hold the butter) and regular bowl. The soup is filling, slightly spicy and flavorful. Rare is it to find a chain restaurant in Tampa offering a vegan soup. Even rarer is the restaurant that offers a really good vegan soup. On one occasion I ordered the mushroom and asparagus salad (sans goat cheese). If I had to do it over again, I'd get the dressing on the side. I don't have the same love affair with dressing as a lot of people so I usually find the amount that restaurants put on to be too much. BJ's was no different. A two star BJ's has people working there that are unable to answer questions about the menu. At the Lutz location we had a gluten free diner seated with us. She asked for the gluten free menu and they obliged. She decided to order the gluten free pizza and asked the server about toppings. The server said all toppings were gluten free except for the meatballs. When another friend inquired about what barbacoa was, the waitress gave her best answer and then double checked with someone else in order to ensure that my fellow diner could make an informed decision. A two star BJ's does not bring out a garlic roll for the toddler who might be just a little less patient about waiting for her food. The Lutz location served my daughter a drink and a complimentary roll right away. I thought this was a fabulous idea because my daughter is still at the age where she tells me she wants mac and cheese and she thinks it should be there moments later. The roll helped to stem the constant ""where is my mac and cheese questions"" because she had something to snack on. Does this location have some kinks to work out? Probably. They mixed up checks once when I was there. Had her drinks on his and vice versa. But considering that they are restaurant that has been open just a little over a month, I'd say some kinks are to be expected.  Kinks and all, I'm definitely a fan of BJ's. (That sounds dirty.)"
Andrew W.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",1,5,,4.0,11/11/2017,"I like the beer and apps here, so far everything else I've had, food wise from here has been kind of bland, or over salted."
Becky P.,"Plant City, FL",1,9,,3.0,8/27/2017,"We were in the area so thought we would give this place a try. We got here around 3 so we expected it not to be too busy.  First off, we were brought to be sat at a table that hadn't been bussed, so we were forced to stand in the isle where servers and customers were trying to get by.  Our server came very shortly after we sat down expecting us to be ready to order. We told her we needed a couple more minutes to look over the menus and she didn't come back for another 20 minutes and was nowhere to be seen.  We ordered our food and had them bring the kids food out first. My daughter's soup was not hot. I thought MAYBE since it was for a child, they brought it so it wouldn't burn her mouth. We then overheard another table sending their food back because it was brought out cold.  My husbands plate looked phenomenal, and he said it tasted that way. He ordered a California club.  I ordered the spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles. Mine tasted good. However the amount of chicken you get in this dish is about 1 tenderloin cut up.  Overall the food was good, but the service is lacking. We overheard several complaints as we were waiting on our own food. We physically saw the flustered manager getting complaints left and right. If they get new management that can run a business, this place will be great."
Mollyana W.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",788,144,139,5.0,11/18/2016,"For a chain restaurant, they are great! They have excellent Happy Hour specials. (3-7pm and 10-?pm) My husband and I went there, had 4 appetizers, and 4 drinks, and our bill was only $35. Plus, we downloaded the app and got an amazing Pazookie for Freeeeee! LOL The stuffed mushrooms are great, the potstickers, the tuna poke as well. He loved the root beer wings. Friendly staff and service. Overall a very good experience!  ***I have now visited here 4-5 times and only at the bar."
Drew G.,"Tampa, FL",419,68,9,3.0,6/26/2017,Service was not bad at all happy hour is really the only time to ever go here. The drink prices are not bad at all they have a lot of beers on tap and that is nice. Food wise the root beer wings are not a bad choice at all by any means.
Gerry L.,"Land O' Lakes, Tampa Bay, FL",29,10,5,3.0,6/26/2017,"This restaurant has a wide menu variety which is awesome. It has great ambiance and service. The first time my family and I went here we enjoyed the food a lot. The second time was not as satisfying. They have a great deep dish pizza so we ordered it again. But this time it was served cold. So we asked our waitress to warm it up for us. When it came back, it was still cold and only the bottom crust was warm. A little bit disappointed in that I'm having second thoughts in coming back."
P W.,"Land O' Lakes, Tampa Bay, FL",0,8,,4.0,11/6/2017,"We always enjoy this location. Food is always good. However, I hate to say that the speed of service is very poor. We usually go once a month or so usually between 11am-12pm. Lunch service when not busy shouldn't take 10-15 min to order. And refill on drinks are pretty much non existent. We will return but hope to service improves."
Riri C.,"Tampa, FL",0,35,18,2.0,5/27/2017,"Not worth it. My first two attempts to eat there, there was a 45 min+ wait time. Even with us putting our name in 20 mins before we got there. Finally the third time we only had a 25 min wait. Service was mediocre. Food was pretty basic. Chilis has better burgers to be honest. The avocado egg rolls were weird, especially with the BBQ sauce. None of us were impressed at all, will definitely not be going back there. It's also overpriced."
Debbie S.,"Land O' Lakes, Tampa Bay, FL",17,25,32,3.0,10/22/2016,Food is good. They have a lot of kinks to work out. Very slow service.  Don't go unless you have a lot of time to kill. Took an hour and a half to get a burger. Should be good in a month or so.
David H.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",36,101,31,4.0,12/4/2016,"I don't want to take anything away from the food but, the service was the star.  For midlevel restrauant, the service was well above standard. Madeline was our primary server. She visited frequently, corrected problems before we could even bring them up (missing side), was familiar with the menu, polite, friendly, anticipated our needs, etc. I enjoyed the Hopstorm IPA with my Spicy Chicken in peanut sauce with soba noodles."
Kailey W.,"Oviedo, FL",0,2,,3.0,7/23/2017,"Slow service and inattentive servers. Did not have silverware when seated, and had to ask hostess for silverware once food came. Food was as expected"
Kent F.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,9,3.0,12/17/2016,"Got our food exactly one hour after ordering . I ordered medium rare burger and nephew got a medium burger, his was burned and mine was edible . I split mine with him while they re-did his order . 1.5 hours and we're waiting ....... nice atmosphere . Don't go without a lot of time on your hands ."
