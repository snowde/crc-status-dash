Bruce K.,"Lutz, FL",118,3,,5.0,7/16/2017,"Hi Guys. I wanted to just express my thanks to Drew   Schultz for all his great service given to me and my family members just a few days ago. Not only was his service great, he was conversational as well. It was my sons birthday and he ensured that the food served was on key with the order. When you get a chance order some of their Salmon Pita Tacos. Next time were in the area will be coming in for more. After dinner dessert was good too! For reference this is the one at Citrus Park, Tampa!"
Steve C.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",318,130,200,4.0,3/30/2017,"Service was slow but good was all on point when it did arrive. It was Friday night so I will give them a pass on the slower service. It's a big space, lots of TV's, craft beers and a variety on the menu."
Debby L.,"Lutz, FL",12,11,10,4.0,7/15/2017,"Their menu is literally like a book!  You will have plenty of choices.  We have ordered the Flatbread Nachos as our appetizer several times and it is always good.  If you are in the mood for pizza and no one else at your table is, not a problem!  They have a mini size, and they also have a choice of deep dish or thin.  Lots of combos or you can customize.  Can't say enough about the food, and I like that they support local businesses by having a number of (rotating) craft beers from breweries in the area.  The only reason I don't rate 5 stars is because the service isn't always great."
Lewis E.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,8,,2.0,10/9/2017,"Food was good, service was terrible! Took 3 hours for a meal, even after talking with the manager it did not improve!"
Mohamed M.,"Tampa Bay, FL",319,93,40,4.0,4/23/2017,Came here for a late night meal. Service was on point. I orders the fish tacos and they were great. Atmosphere was nice. Menu had a great selection. I will for sure return and try a few more things. I'm surprised the ratings aren't higher
Dwaine C.,"Land O Lakes, FL",14,14,5,3.0,5/24/2017,"Tried ordering craft beers but server had no clue about beer . Told us the beer menu was old and some beers weren't available. Took forever to get first round . We got our appetizers but had no silverware. Wedge salad was good . Wings were good . Don't order the Italian flat bread , the picture is a lie . There were very very few toppings and for the price . I was offended. Food was ok . Service was poor . Don't believe pictures on yelp , they are professionally doctored."
Whitney S.,"Lutz, FL",0,7,1,5.0,5/24/2017,"Great place, can't say enough. I've been to BJ's everywhere and this by far is best I always sit at bar. Dustin the manager is amazing he knows everything about the beer that you can think of I can't say enough about him. He's just all around a good guy. I'm a veteran and he was in marines... My girlfriend and I couldn't get around how much he knew about beer and im a craft beer girl chick.. Thanks Dustin!!"
Traci H.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",1,9,1,4.0,5/18/2017,"Good food, nice selection of craft beers. It's hard to find something where everyone in my family can find what they like.  The blondie with ice cream is to die for.  Great burger."
Brinton D.,"Tampa, FL",17,6,,1.0,3/16/2017,Don't waste your time or money. Went there for lunch and it took 45min to get our order. When the order finally arrived parts of my salad were frozen. Very disappointing!
Jodi N.,"Land O Lakes, FL",7,50,3,5.0,4/8/2017,Back again got another great appetizer fried artichoke awesome hobby had deep dish pizza could have more cheese but still good and I had the brisket BBQ Burger excellent service was excellent Mckenzie was awesome great service
Kirk V.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",12,4,,4.0,7/6/2017,I love this place.  The food is great and affordable.  Their happy hour drinks and apps are excellent.  The only complaint I have I'd that you have to sit in the bar to get the happy hour prices.
Crystal D.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",26,36,2,4.0,5/27/2017,Let me start with we had a 5 star meal at Bjs today! Our server Andrew was wonderful! The only thing rating this at 4 was the long long table time! We were seated almost immediately and our meal took 2 hrs and 15 minutes. Party of 4 order all different items all were fantastic! Appetizer and desert both great! Over all very happy! Hopefully they can pick up the pace.
Danielle B.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",69,91,114,1.0,12/28/2016,"I usually love everything about BJ's! It's my favorite chain but I gotta tell you this experience has been nothing short of awful. First we had a 50 minute wait.... then we got sat (Party of 7) split among two tables and then the two waters were drama and after were sat and kids were coloring, they asked us to move. They crammed us into a table... the server was not polite. They brought out our order and several things were wrong. Of those things, a friend ordered a portabella burger (she's a vegetarian) and it came out with meat and when she asked the waitress about it, she got an attitude and said it comes with meat. After some discussion she said she'd get it brought out without meat. We also sat around waiting for drinks. All the adults were having drafts or ciders but it was a real challenge to get more. Our service was some of the worst we've ever had. To say I'm disappointed is putting it lightly. The margarita pizza came out and it looked like a totinos version of a flatbread. It was awful."
Vicki M.,"Camarillo, CA",19,13,,2.0,8/24/2017,"Sunday noon reservations for a birthday party of 12, five children, seven adults.  Extremely slow service; wet appetizer plates finally delivered to table after having to be requested.  Waitress was struggling but help didn't arrive until desserts were served.  Electronic troubles with her order pad threw her off maybe.  She was slow and seemed inexperienced.  As far as the food goes, the entrees were very good, the starters just so-so and desserts were gooey and yummy.  The problem with this visit was the staffing.  Thumbs down!"
Damon Yang S.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",2,5,3,1.0,1/7/2017,"We had a similar experience with Richard, the ""hostess"" switched our table to another party right in front of us(because they are friends of the waitress at that table).  She denied it at first, but after I told her I heard the entire conversation between them, and saw her switch the menus in her hand from 2 adults/2kids(us) to 3 adults(them), she finally admitted what she did was wrong then apologized, but it was too late. Not to mention we already waited for more than 70 mins at that moment. We complained to the manager, she handled it very professionally, appreciated us letting her know and offered us free appetizer or gift card(we DID NOT accept them, because we feel we should still pay for what we order). We were honest and told her the hostess ruined the whole experience for our family, and we most likely will never come back. However, the food was decent and our waitress was very friendly.  It is very unfortunate, the manager, waitress and chef all did a great job on their part, but the hostess' unprofessional behavior ruined it for the team."
Bk H.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2016,1.  Disfunction with the hostesses to start the night.  2.  Drinks took 15-20 mins to get.   3.  The orders took a long time to receive.   4.  One was wrong and the other was cold.  The waitress asked if I would like my meal reheated in the microwave!  Appetite lost!
Haley W.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",46,7,,1.0,9/12/2017,"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. This is by far the worst dining experience I have had since moving to Tampa. I had an extremely simple order, and it was made wrong not once, not twice, but three times. Every time it was made wrong, the waitress just stared at me, no apologies or anything, and made me ask for the ingredients. The burger was supposed to be topped with cranberries, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, red wine vinegarette, baby greens, and chargrilled onions. The first time, I literally just got a burger with a tomato slice and a raw onion slice. Obviously not what I ordered. The waitress just stared at me and I had to ask for a new one. The second time, they just threw on a few pieces of greens and a few cranberries. Still missing 4 of the ingredients. Again, the waitress just stared at me and seemed exasperated when I asked for the ingredients it stated on the menu with the menu open in front of me. The third time, it was STILL missing chargrilled onions, red wine vinegarette, AND no baby greens. They completely took off the greens too. The manager was just as bad as the waitress, just stared at me when I told him it was missing 3 ingredients after the third time and did NOT offer to get me the ingredients or replace my meal with something else. After sitting at the table for well over an hour and having my meal remade WRONG three times with no apologies or trying to make it right on the waitress's/manager's end, I will never be visiting again. PS Don't order the turkey burger because apparently they don't know how to make it."
Tim A.,"Land O Lakes, FL",39,20,,2.0,7/22/2017,I really don't think this place will last. The food isn't that good and the service wasn't that good either. The food is trendy and the prices are high. Drunk prices are high as well.
Sue W.,"Zephyrhills, FL",30,5,,4.0,3/18/2017,"We went here today for a late  lunch. It was quite crowded - we were told 25 minute wait, but it was more like 45 minutes. The menu is really extensive with many choices that I wanted to try. I ordered the ham and cheese grilled cheese, which is on their Mon-Fri lunch menu but they said I could I order it on Sat. It was excellent. The service was a little slow but it was a really crowded weekend lunch crowd. I would totally come again. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food."
Stevie M.,"Tampa, FL",3,3,,4.0,3/13/2017,"My wife and I stopped in at BJ's brewhouse for lunch with our baby daughter, and we were truly taken back with the level of customer service Darryl provided. Being a Cicerone myself I know I can be a little much when I'm picking beers I haven't tried before. I ask questions I would hope my customers would ask me, Darryl did a wonderful job at providing options and finding out what it was I liked. Unfortunately, there Goliath Imperial red IPA was sold out. But the IPA that he recommended worked just fine for my meal. He kept a smile on his face despite the nasty weather outside, he seems to truly enjoy his work. My wife and I will definitely be back, probably me more so than her. You really can't beat $3.50 per craft beer so long as you're getting one of BJ brewhouse's trade craft beers. Thanks again Darryl, we will be sure to ask for you again on our next visit."
