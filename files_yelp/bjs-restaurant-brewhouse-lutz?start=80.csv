Michael K.,"Fort Myers, FL",21,6,1,1.0,6/29/2017,Let just say we have been to BJs and have always loved the food. It seems that every BJs that I go to though seems to be under staffed and you can't get your order in.( like 15 minutes after we were sat). I think that your team needs to have some urgency and make sure all the guest in the building are happy. This whole concept of sitting your servers 10 tables at once and thinking they are giving above and beyond service is ridiculous. So food is great love your specials just you need to have a manager out on the floor assisting with guest and team members. This will boost your rating and bring back life long guest who will rave about you. I really hope this helps and I will be looking forward to a reply to know that this will be fixed.
Gary F.,"Land O Lakes, FL",25,2,,1.0,3/3/2017,Ordered curbside pickup service and it's a total fail. I arrived and called the number NO answer. Called again a couple minutes later they answered. Waited as instructed and waited. When found out the pizza was never cooked. Another twenty minutes they said the manager would come out to explain. Another ten minutes the food arrives with no manager. The pizza was cold so how was it fresh out of the oven. TOTAL disappointment!!!
Harriette P.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",28,70,5,5.0,1/25/2017,"This location recently opened.  We've been in several times. First time just for drinks and next for dinner.  The food was great. The Brussels sprouts  were crazy good. It can get a little London Friday, Saturday night, but we love the place."
Althea T.,"CAMBRIA HTS, NY",0,4,,4.0,2/12/2017,"Great choices on extensive menu. Love going. Only problem is that they encourage you to get their app but never want to honor barcode given when you sign up for future discounts. Tried 3 times now and continuously get the run around when asked about using my membership barcode. On my last visit, Feb 10th, I asked to speak with the manager. S/he would not even speak with me In person but sent waitress to say S/he would look into my request of using my barcode for future points. Waitress had no idea what I was talking about either.  So food is good but they won't go out of their way to honor offers."
Aj W.,"Tampa, FL",4,87,5,2.0,1/24/2017,"I am really a fan of BJ's Brewhouse. I have been to several locations and always enjoy the beer and food. The app makes putting your name on the list easy, getting points up dates a breeze and even keeps you up to date on new offers. Great move by BJ's restaurants ti keep with the times and technology. That's about where the good stops. The customer service at this particular location is terrible. The waitresses and waiters are always pleasant it's not a matter if being rude. It's a matter they seem understaffed and the service is slow. Management needs to address this issue."
Alexis F.,"Thonotosassa, FL",2,3,7,5.0,1/3/2017,Their Avocado EggRolls are to die for!!!!! So yummy and their glazed wings are the best and so is the deep dish pizzas they offer!!!
Kimberly N.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,144,118,1.0,11/13/2016,"Put our name on the list at 12:30 for s party of 3 and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. After checking the wait with the hostess a couple of times and still not being seated after over an hour, we removed our name and left. Hopefully their customer service will improve after they've been open a bit longer, but right now it's lousy."
Yvie D.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,2,,5.0,8/16/2017,"My first time there.  It was myself, my husband and 2 granddaughters.  Excellent service from the time we arrived until the time we left.  Jake was our server and he was very professional, courteous and kept a very warm smile.  He was sure to keep checking we had refills with our drinks and asked if we needed anything extra.  The manager, Asseray (not sure of the spelling) was excellent as well.  She was there to answer my questions and displayed a very professional attitude.  They both took their time with us.  Didn't rush through us. Really listened. The food was superb!  The temperature of the food was perfect.  It was delicious and satisfying.  I will definitely be going back."
Mark B.,"Dade City, FL",0,3,,1.0,11/16/2016,"Horrible food.  Ordered fish and chips.  Very thick batter was raw on the inside.  Very little actual fish.  Told the waitress and her response was "" I'll let them know"".  Payed full price for a few bites.  One and done."
Ruby T.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Came here for the first time. Will not return again. Service was good, food not good. The table I sat at had garbage under table. They need to have someone clean immediately when a customer leaves. Not my cup of tea at all."
Jordan G.,"Lutz, FL",0,1,,5.0,8/24/2017,Amazing experience. We were seated faster than expected.  Daryl was our waiter and he did an awesome job.  We didn't have to wait long for our food and he made sure our drinks were always full.  We were not planning on having dessert but Daryl suggested one to us and we are so happy he did because it was delicious. Definitely going back soon and asking for Daryl.
Christine B.,"Lutz, FL",53,58,7,3.0,12/13/2016,I definitely have not had many 4 star experiences since Bj's has opened this location but I do like there menu and I am hopeful that after newness wears off they will up there game on food service time.
Nicole P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,8,,2.0,10/30/2016,"Food was good. But everything else was a joke. Management and staff decided to have a party off to the side of the restaurant. Literally 15 people standing around talking and gossiping; management, servers, and kitchen staff included. Not only was it distracting, the service was terrible. Good food is only half of the equation and the fact that the management team didn't seem concerned that our bill got lost and just shrugged and walked back over to the 'party' was the cherry on top."
Pat M.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,,1.0,10/27/2016,"Absolutely horrible experience. There was a long wait for the food, the server was aloof and uncaring, but the worst part of all was due to some ""technical problem,"" it took nearly an hour to get the check. Management was completely inept and uncaring. The right thing to do in that situation would be to comp the meal, but no. Just a lame apology--no discount, no free dessert or drink, no compensation at all for the huge inconvenience caused by them and them alone. Definitely won't be returning to this location. They obviously weren't ready to open and need a completely new management team who know how to fix mistakes and make things right."
Patti L.,"Land O Lakes, Land O Lakes, FL",7,6,1,2.0,1/2/2017,So I generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review. My husband and I arrived and were placed on the wait list. No big deal. Some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order. The pizza was no better than Pizza Hut. We were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza. The artichoke dip came out. Most of the chips were small pieces. Hardly suitable for dipping. The waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins. She seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those. The flat bread pizza was something kids could make. On grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients.  To me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price. Expected higher quality for the price. The appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive. Probably won't go back because there are local non-chain restaurants that are far better.
Paul R.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",7,14,3,2.0,11/5/2016,They need to figure their shit out.....this place is not running efficiently at all.....we won't be back any tone
Jessica J.,"Tampa, FL",97,13,4,2.0,12/30/2016,Side Cesar and BJ's burger were subpar but fries were pretty good! Also I had the strawberry splash which had about one drop of alcohol...Honestly I want to go back for lunch to have the best overall view.
Laura C.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,25,9,4.0,12/30/2016,"First time at this restaurant. Had a long wait but nice environment and they brought pizza samples around twice during wait. Wait staff was great, very nice. Prices were $$ average to high.  We had the artichoke dip...very good. We had the Mediterranean chicken pita taco and bacon burger with fries. Both were very well seasoned and full of flavor. Will be back"
Jill L.,"Tampa, FL",6,21,,1.0,10/20/2016,"I just called to see if the restaurant has outside seating. The woman who answered said umm I don't think so, I'm pretty sure it's all inside. I will wait a few weeks before going there hopefully by then they will let there staff walk around the restaurant."
Lacey S.,"Englewood, FL",2,60,19,5.0,2/8/2017,"Amazing food and service every time we visit. It is definitely worth the wait for a table. My favorites are the wild berry cider, pizzokies, and the deep dish baked ziti. Yum!"
