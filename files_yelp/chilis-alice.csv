TRUTH S.,"Whittier, CA",13,19,2,5.0,9/23/2017,Went in a couple of weeks ago and had the ribs with the  house barbecue sauce. Best barbecue sauce I've ever tried!!  So crazy good!  I tried to buy some on the way out only to be told that it was made there.  Totally going back soon!
Brianna M.,"Alice, TX",0,11,4,1.0,8/11/2017,Only decent chain restaurant in this small town. Wait time is horrid on the weekends.
Lauri W.,"Falls Church, VA",33,24,6,4.0,1/12/2017,"First the bad: tonight we had the worst service I've ever had. I won't name her name. She is young, I wanted to like her, but it was a nightmare. I am mad because my mother had had laser eye surgery. She had some pain. We came to Chili's as a treat. Our waitress needed to tell us though that she felt ""tired"". I used to work at Denny's. I didn't share my personal woes with patrons. There was another issue later, but I don't feel like getting into it. I love, though, the waitress Norma. She is mature, she is fast, efficient, generous, smart, complimentary, and could teach little missy a thing or TWO. Norma is the reason we'll go back. I've had her 3-4 times in the past. I won't name the bad server. I am not cruel. I just hope that once management sees this they make sure servers focus on the guests, and how tired we are (my mom had just had laser surgery on her eyes!) rather than herself."
Adrian T.,"Midland, TX",186,5,5,1.0,1/3/2017,Crappy service only two servers working and my burger bites were raw and bled on my plate smh
Stephanie S.,"San Antonio, TX",79,2,,5.0,8/27/2017,"Probably the best Chilis I've been to, and I'm not talking about the food. They were on a limited menu due to Hurricane Harvey. The place was relatively busy, and our bar waitress was great. The manager was helping the staff to get the food out. They had a brief meeting in the back, everyone was happy, clapping and smiling, the energy was incredible. I would highly recommend this place!"
C C.,"Saint Anne, IL",0,19,6,2.0,1/27/2017,"On-line menu for Chili's in Alice, TX, shows New England clam chowder by the cup or bowl. This place doesn't have it and never did per the waitress. She did check when I showed her the entry. The reply was ""only some restaurants"" and I was informed that this was, indeed, the only Alice restaurant. So much for accuracy on Yelp. Service was slow. The music is much too loud for comfortable conversation. The place was not busy, either. Burgers were well prepared and tasty. We both liked the fries. The waitress was friendly. Two stars is because we really liked the burgers and fries. As for the rest.....every time the ladies sitting behind me in the next booth moved a bit, my seat bounced. Not really comforting."
Tracy S.,"Austin, TX",1,46,,1.0,7/25/2017,"It just wasn't that good. I've had better at other chili's. First the water they served tasted like dirt. Maybe that's how the water taste here but there's no reason they couldn't filter it. I ordered chicken fajitas and they were ok, nice portion but you get no guacamole, sour cream, or cheese with it. I've never seen any restaurant serve fajitas with out cheese, pico, sour cream and guacamole. The flour tortillas came in tin foil as normal but instead of them being rolled up, the person that put them together stacked four tortillas and folded them up like a dish towel. Because they were old they broke off in pieces. I tried two eat two and gave up. I would never eat at this location again."
Ashlyn P.,"San Antonio, TX",102,15,6,1.0,1/1/2017,ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Took 15 minutes just to get drinks ordered and then didn't receive them until we got our food. The food was mediocre. DO NOT COME HERE!!! Literally go anywhere else.
Daniel K.,"Alice, TX",0,9,,2.0,7/3/2017,"I echo the other reviews, the food was ok but pretty bad service at the Alice TX location.  We went in at 1:30 and our waitress only had one other table.  She did get our food out in a timely manner, but after that we never saw her, and had to go to the kitchen to find someone so we could get a to go box."
Sonia T.,Hong Kong,552,943,13,4.0,1/13/2015,"There isn't a whole hell of a lot to choose from, so I popped in the one name I did recognize, Chilis.   Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted, super friendly service, and had a glass of wine.  We ordered one of the Mexican bowls, nothing thrilling (Chipolte is better) and my brother had a turkey sandwich.  I did notice it was quite the hopping place for oil field guys looking to come in and have drinks.  Good happy hour with cheap food, nice TV for sports watching, and good service."
Maureen G.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,10,,1.0,2/3/2017,"I only wish yelp would offer a 0 star. The service here is awful here in Alice Texas & I didn't even get a chance to order. Staying in Alice for a few days on business with 22 colleagues @ Hospital. I first tried to order by phone, after waiting 10 mins on phone I hanged up & went to location to order 22 meals. When I got to the carry out area to order, no one assisted me for at least 10 mins. I had to stop one of the workers & told her I wanted to place an order. She told me she was busy. I finally left after 15 minutes. I would say chills lost out close to $1k."
Jeri T.,"Austin, TX",8,180,49,2.0,3/16/2016,"Why I'm giving this two stars, I don't know. Edible fries maybe? When I walked the host/manager? Asked if I wanted to sit in the dining room or the lounge a.k.a. bar. We passed no less than three tables with dishes piled high on them and he had to wipe mine off with his hand to get the last crumb. After a while I eventually got to order my drink, The waitress brought me my drink and another set of silverware and walked off. Eventually she returned and asked along I would be waiting for the second person. I said it's just me. She said Oh I saw two menus. I said no that's your specialty menu. So I ordered a burger. Half an hour later, I asked. She went to kitchen and brought it out and started telling me something. I was like no. It's not busy. It's Chili's. It's a burger. When she brought me the tab, she said, yes you were here exactly 30 min. I said no. I was here longer. The order was put in that long ago. And this, my friends is why I avoid chains. BTW when I left, I counted at least three tables with dishes piled high. Nasty."
Ned M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",28,2,2,5.0,5/1/2015,"I love everything about this place. The food, the service, and how clean this place is. Great place to drink at the bar and watch sports or to bring the whole family. The staff is very friendly and the management walked around and checking everybody tables. The food tasted fresh and cook to perfection. I recommend this place if you live in town or just driving by."
Ken S.,"Alice, TX",146,170,1419,4.0,5/6/2014,Other than going there for some drinks and to enjoy the atmosphere is just about it cause it's not really a place to go and eat. Drinks and more drinks and hanging out with your sidekicks for drinks.
Jill M.,"Alice, TX",0,4,3,1.0,9/26/2016,We ordered The Original Crispy Tenders and steak. We had to send back both of our meals. The chicken tenders were raw!!! Serious Health risk factor. ordered steak medium and was served rare. Nobody apologized until I asked to speak to a manager. Do Not waste your money here. Danger to your health. In this day and age a chain restaurant should not be serving raw chicken!!! I would rate this less than 1 star if allowed!
Justin J.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,3,,1.0,4/29/2015,"Normally Chilis is quite good and reputable, but over the years I believe we found the worst one on the planet in Alice.  Took over one hour and fifteen minutes in a half full restaurant to get our food.  Arrived cold and staff clearly lied when they continued to say it was coming out.  No manager available.  Floors dirty for early noon and restroom had clearly not been cleaned and rivaled most truck stops."
Gena V.,"Alice, TX",0,16,11,4.0,4/21/2015,I ordered the new pork carnitas tacos with black beans and cilantro lime rice and I was so impressed! Best meal I have had in Alice in a long time. Usually chilis is average for me but this meal was flavorful and savory. Fresh ingredients really make a difference. My hubby got a double party burger and perfectly cooked fries.  Service was good too.
James D.,"Alice, TX",11,49,17,2.0,10/14/2014,"Ordered the bacon burger and was brought an uncooked burger.  The fries tasted bitter as if the oil was burnt.  They corrected the burger and it was good.  They did not have the appetizer I wanted and I had to settle for the cheese sticks which were ok.  I wanted the onion rings.  A coworker was brought potato soup that was poorly made/served.  Again, they were told about this and they did correct it.  The waitress was impatient and bit rude.  We waited too long for our food.  A plus  was we laughed together and environment was comfortable.  Manager waiter was very nice."
Hannah S.,"Cleburne, TX",0,6,3,4.0,6/30/2015,"Atmosphere and service was fine. You could tell the place was very clean and kept up. When I ordered their French fries, though, some of them were cold on the inside. But that was the only negativity. The other food that I ordered was excellent."
Randall T.,"Alice, TX",56,6,1,2.0,10/28/2014,"I've been here 3 time and each time I had one of the worst chilis experience in my life. Nothing to complain about when it comes to the food but the service was horrible every time. Not only would my waiter ignore me but other waiter/waitresses also did. This location wasn't even busy... Not even close. When they did get to me I needed minor things like a straw, nothing too demanding, and the guy would give me attitude about it, then disappear for another 20 min"
Leslie D.,"Alice, TX",0,6,,3.0,1/18/2015,"I like it but.... I don't. 90% of the time something is wrong with the order. When you order online, it estimates 30 minutes to wait but sometimes you wait an hour or more!! If you special order something for example no pico or no onion they usually don't accommodate you and put it on there anyway."
David D.,"Laredo, TX",0,1,,2.0,3/3/2014,I was disappointed to find out that they had a smoking section in the bar. This also made the other side reek of smoke. The staff was extremely nice and the food was good. They never should have allowed smoking in the first place it would be hard to stop that now.
John S.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/22/2015,The service was poor.  The wait for food was long.  Some items were cold and others were overcooked to the point of difficult to chew.  The portions of several items were jokingly small.  This is my third time eating dinner here in three years.  Thought it might have improved.  Guess not.  My last visit.
Joe C.,"Rowlett, TX",4,166,97,3.0,5/6/2012,It's Chili's!!!! Which is not Tex Mex!!! Thank you Brinker!!!
Lili A.,"Dallas, TX",3,73,70,5.0,2/28/2011,Service/food was great & fast!!!
