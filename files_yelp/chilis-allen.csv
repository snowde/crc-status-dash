Shannan D.,"Allen, TX",9,80,357,4.0,11/27/2017,"Stopped in at lunch for a quick bite to eat with my niece. I hadn't visited a Chili's in a long time so thought I'd check it out again. I waited at the door 4-5 minutes before the hostess realize I was there. He was chatting with the bartender. After we were sat, everything went very well. They do a team service thing so we had 2 servers taking re of us. Our orders were taking almost immediately and our drinks glasses were never empty. I had the Old Timer Burger with cheese and my niece had The Kid's Chicken Alfredo and she loved it. I was very pleased with the portion sized because often restaurants tend to skimp in kids meals, but NOT CHILI's. Thanks!"
Darren W.,"Lucas, TX",0,20,,1.0,12/24/2017,Was shopping nearby and used their mobile app to place an order.  Arrived and parked in the designated area and replied to their text that we were there.  We waited and order did not arrive.  We waited 10 more minutes and still no order.  I went in to see what was up and said they haven't started the order yet.  We left and went somewhere else yet I was still charged for it.  Ended up having to initiate a chargeback for the order.
guy h.,"Dallas, TX",93,572,1397,3.0,8/14/2017,"This isn't theChilis of old. You remember, back in the day when the burgers were two handed juicy beast you struggled to get into your mouth. However, after years of burgers on the decline, it looks like they are back on track. I would go back for a burger without hesitation. The side of chili they give you is $1 extra and super small. However it's enough and does the job."
Tara B.,"Plano, TX",0,10,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Every time we go to this Chilis we wait to be seated, we wait on food.  Tonight we called and now my husband is waiting to pick up food. I've been going to Chilis for years and this by far is the worst consistently slow service we have ever revived.  I'm h"
Deej N.,"Princeton, TX",7,151,168,2.0,11/28/2017,"Service is always friendly. Sad to say, the food was terrible to mediocre. My niece and I did the two meals for $22.00 deal. The bacon and cheese fries were pretty good. I had the half rack of bbq ribs. They were terrible. Dry dry dry all the way to the bone. Cannot believe they served them. My loaded mashed potatoes were okay. My niece had a Cajun chicken pasta dish. She said it tasted like someone opened up a ready made package and dumped it on a plate. This had to be the worst meal at Chili's ever. We decided we will never go back. Not worth the risk of getting terrible food again. I would have given one star, but our server was very nice and the fries and mashed potatoes were pretty decent. Molten cake was delicious as always."
Carrie C.,"McKinney, TX",150,91,24,4.0,8/11/2017,"Average Chili's. Service was good and as usual, I appreciate their on-table ordering."
Cary Tammy M.,"Warrensburg, MO",12,7,20,5.0,9/7/2017,"Jaded was a great waiter, we had a crowd of about18 and the food was excellent. My wife Tammy had steak w/ shrimp on it.i had a bacon cheeseburger and fries, the price was pretty good I paid for 8 people 2 where kids meals and it only cost 106.00. Nice"
Carly S.,"Allen, TX",44,11,,1.0,11/6/2017,We quit going to this Chili's. Last time we were there it took my family of 5 TWO HOURS to eat. We waited 45 minutes for our food only to get it cold and missing half of our sides! The restaurant wasn't busy and there were so much waitstaff they were standing around gossiping about each other by our table. Unfortunately we've had this similar situation the last 3 times we've been in. So sad because we used to love this Chili's and would meet our friends there but it's really gone down in service this last year. To be honest I am scared to try it again because last time we ate there the kids didn't get their food until almost 9. And I just don't want to take the chance. The Order to Go has problems connecting sometimes and they never answer their phone. The Chili's by my work in Addison is always on point but the Allen location is hurting right now
Judd W.,"Plano, TX",0,23,,5.0,10/13/2017,This Chili's is always consistent in quality. I'm a huge fan of the Old Timer burger and it's always fresh n juicy. Nothing worse than a dried up burger. Defiantly a well run restaurant.
Jerry W.,"Allen, TX",0,8,,5.0,9/22/2017,Been eating at chilis for years and years and always go back. We have a severely disable granddaughter and Chilis in Allen bends over backwards to take care of us. The food is excellent and we have had the same waitress for 2 years..Jamie who is top notch. We just left and will go back next week
Alex E.,"Allen, TX",14,162,1,4.0,9/1/2016,"What can I say, it's Chili's. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. Got my usual chicken crispers, very delicious, wife got some chicken. I really like their skillet mashed potatoes, but they almost put too much cheese in it now. Our waiter was also pretty nice. No complaints."
Tiffany O.,"Allen, TX",695,34,49,3.0,10/19/2017,Was pretty disappointed with my visit today. Went in at 4pm. Sat at the bar because it was just me and close to my house and was going to just grab a quick bite. Bartender John was very nice and polite when greeting me and I ordered a beer and said I was just in for a quick bite. Already knowing what I want I did skim over the menu to make sure there was no new items and then pushed menu forward. It was shift change and the staff was all standing at the end of the bar catching up or updating night staff from lunch like I would expect. However it did take awhile before I was able to order and then the nachos I had were way over seasoned and unlike how I always get them. I never got a check back until my beer was almost empty and at that point I was so hungry and had to go I just asked for check and box. Felt bad to throw them out it that's exactly what I did when I got home. I knew I should of just grabbed something on the way home but contemplated in my head cuz they usually are on point with the appetizers.  I'll be back because it's convenient but won't make a special trip. Especially since there was only 4 guests I. The bar including not at the bar top.
Danielle M.,"McKinney, TX",0,16,7,5.0,12/18/2016,"I came here to dinner with my brother last night to get a 2 for $20. We got chips, salsa, and guac right away as our appetizer. Our actual meals took a really long time to get so we finished our entire appetizer but we weren't going to complain or anything. When our food did come out, the manager brought it to us, apologized, and took the appetizer off our tab! It was so sweet and unexpected, I'm so happy with our visit. This was great service and the food was delicious as always."
Michael V.,"Allen, TX",0,8,2,1.0,5/7/2017,"Tonight I witnessed the worst treatment of an employee by a manager that I have ever seen. The manager, Roy, was berating a young employee about cleaning high chairs. She was asked to clean them and when she informed him that she just had he went off and started screaming at her about how they weren't clean in front of staff and customers. If this is how Chili's treats it's employees then I refuse to return. The poor girl was in tears and even if the chairs weren't clean she didn't deserve what was being delt out to her."
A L.,"Highland Park, Dallas, TX",405,152,39,5.0,3/23/2017,"Chili's Curbside is the way to go and Temeka is a phenomenal associate at this location. Incredibly important to see how Chili's menu evolves. I really enjoyed The Cobb Salad and hope it will make a comeback. The Presidente' pretty darn good drink!! I'll be back especially if the customer service stays on par,I sit at table,an associate introduces themselves,takes my drink order and brings the drink back asap for starters. I'll keep the Yelp luv going on!"
Melissa C.,"Allen, TX",20,14,1,4.0,9/18/2017,"Consistently good. I have gone to this Chilis many, many times and it is always good. Our service and food today were no exception."
John L.,"Allen, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/14/2017,They either sat us at the smelly table or their restaurant just smells really bad. And why would they sit people by the kitchen when they have a bunch of open tables
John-Layton J.,"Plano, TX",11,5,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Horrible service. We had to remind our waiter three times for the skillet queso and got it 10-15 minutes after ordering, yet we had the chips about 3 minutes after placing our drinks and appetizer. Our food came out 5 minutes after we finally got the skillet queso and our food finally came out but most of it was lukewarm and they messed up my wife's salad. This is the third time here with bad service so we're never going back. Impossible to complain because our waiter never came around."
Jason E.,"Plano, TX",48,14,21,5.0,12/8/2016,"Food tastes great, the service is always good and the atmosphere is not too loud-comfortable."
Lindsey J.,"Dallas, TX",4,13,13,1.0,1/19/2017,"Horrible customer service, horrible food! Spoke to manager about the bad customer service and nothing resolved."
She B.,"Allen, TX",0,13,10,2.0,5/19/2016,I was craving a steak. I ordered the 6 P's medium rare to go. I took it home sat down & It was so rare and rubbery! Teach your cook what Medium rare means. One of the worst I've ever had.
Alexa O.,"McKinney, TX",32,5,,5.0,1/28/2017,Great food amazing service never have to worry about being taken care of. Been going to Chili's for as long as I can remember and they always have amazing food and always coming up with great new tastes for everyone to try.
Christine H.,"Richardson, TX",0,17,9,2.0,7/14/2017,Got here at 3pm on a Thursday. No one greeted us and we stood there for like 10 minutes. There was no server. We decided to just grab a table since there was about 2 or 3 people sitting on the bar. Later a server finnally showed up. The food was ok.
Arika C.,"Allen, TX",0,19,15,3.0,4/8/2017,"First time ever having not so great service and food at a Chili's. Cold meals, rude host but the manager was great and she helped push this experience to three stars."
Rebecca O.,"Denver, CO",106,44,43,4.0,1/26/2016,"I've been going to this Chili's for years, but two days ago we had a great experience. The only reason for the loss of one star is because they were out of pickles. We couldn't try the fried pickles, or have pickles on our black bean burgers. Our waitress was Hilary, and she was great! She complimented me when we sat down, apologized for the lack of pickles, brought us our sides of ranch before the meal was even out, and was genuinely kind. We would definitely recommend to anyone."
Ray M.,"Richardson, TX",0,11,,1.0,1/2/2017,"It was New Years Eve night and I called Chilis to see what time they closed, I was told midnight. I decided to take my kids out for dessert night before midnight, this was the location of choice for me. I live in McKinney and I could have traveled a little more a North but it was getting late. I noticed the parking lot was very empty but walked up to the door to find it open. I stood by the hostess area for a little while to be approached by another server  who told me they where closed, but it was only 10:45 pm. I was a little shocked by that information, as he started to pull out menus looking very annoyed he informed me that they where supposed to be closed but did not want us to order large entrees from the menu. Wow! I could not believe what I was hearing, I was embarrassed he was refusing to serve me the way I had always been served at chilis in the past. The waitress heard the conversation and decided to seat us as he walked away. Apparently the manager told everyone they could leave early, but that was against the rules, she was the only waitress left behind. My kids ate the dessert of course but we did not get what we wanted. Management needs retraining for sure. When the manager came by our table and dropped a dessert off he asked us if we wanted to go boxes. Why would he think that? The kitchen continuously came out to see if we were still eating our desserts, very awkward. We tipped the waitress well, my kids love chilis but I will never spend a dime in there again! That was by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered in all of my years of being served."
Karen H.,"Allen, TX",31,111,5,2.0,8/6/2016,"I remember the days when Chili's was all the rage and one of the best places to eat.  Not so much anymore.  We don't go often anymore, but when we do, it's to the Allen location.  The last three times it hasn't been up to the standard I remember it being years ago.  The food is just not fresh, with the exception of the burgers, which have always been good.  The rest is a disappointment lately."
AngelsV A.,"Austin, TX",0,176,100,4.0,7/15/2016,"Always screaming loud children and no parents or waiters telling them to be civil for once. I try to not go inside chilis but my mother loves it so unfortunately we have to go inside often. I will say the food is always cooked well, typical chilis chain type food. I always get the chicken enchilada soup, can't go wrong there. The servers pay more attention than they used to shout refills and there's a ton of gay servers now so it makes the place more friendly and lively. Food - good 4/5. Atmosphere 1/5 stars."
Desmond S.,"Allen, TX",303,252,346,1.0,6/10/2014,"My wife and I needed food and happened to be passing Chilis.  I've never been a big fan of Chilis, but it was late and I was hungry, so why not slip in, have a quick meal and a beer with the wife. I wore flip flops. A critter crawled across my foot and made me jump and bump my knee.  Yes I said a critter of the multi-legged variety who's name starts with a R and ends with an H.  Oh yeah, it rhymes with COACH. I'm sorry, but I can't return.  The woman behind the bar grabbed me a manager, she comp'd my meal, which was good since I didn't eat it...  we broke camp as suddenly a frozen burrito didn't sound so bad. I'm a pretty forgiving person, but DAYUM.  I feel dirty."
Dena R.,"Allen, TX",166,195,200,3.0,6/25/2015,"Stopped in for a quick dinner after running errands. We started with the southwestern eggrolls, which have always been a favorite. They were good as always, but have definitely decreased in size from what they used to be. I ordered a burger, but wanted to specify my own toppings, red onion, blue cheese, chili's special sauce, pickles and pepper jack cheese. They used to have a peppercorn burger on the menu and were still able to make it even after it was taken off the menu, but they no longer have the seasoning to make it. I asked for a large side of ranch (I like to dip my burger in it). Bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with onion rings. Seemed to take a little longer than expected, but it was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. My burger was delicious, although it came with blue cheese dressing when I expected blue cheese crumbles. I also only got a small side of ranch but our server quickly corrected both issues. Bf did not like the bun on the sandwich at all. It was described as a potato bun but was way darker than in the menu and looked more like a pretzel bun. Be advised, that is the only bun they have.  Pickles are really good if you like garlic dill pickles, I wished I had ordered the fried pickles after tasting them on my burger. Service was fantastic, we were never without drinks or whatever we needed. I wanted to try the new cinnamon roll skillet dessert but I needed my pants to still fit as I wobbled to the car, maybe next time!"
Jeanene W.,"Plano, TX",108,24,26,3.0,2/13/2014,"This place is so hit or miss!  Great for kids and fast and friendly service.   But, our food was terrible.  My chicken bowl was awful.  The flavor was not what I would expect from a chicken bowl.  The chicken clearly was not grilled fresh.  It was frozen out of a bag with zero flavor.  My husband went the route of mexican food which is new on the menu.  Was barley edible.   I'm sure for convienience reasons we will come back.  I'll stick to a burger."
Jade H.,"Plano, TX",0,35,1,4.0,1/1/2016,This location is managed well. Excellent service and always awesome smiles. Consistent great quality.
May F.,"Allen, TX",45,11,5,4.0,7/28/2015,"My favorite is onion strings but it's not on the menu anymore for appetizer.  The price is good, and good location."
Kaylee R.,"Allen, TX",2,12,2,3.0,12/17/2015,Here at chilis right now.... Been waiting forever for a BOWL OF SOUP!!!! Hubby got soup too and my father in law got chicken fried steak... MAYBE that's why... Packed but slow. Hope this soup is worth the wait.
BC H.,"Dallas, TX",4,12,24,5.0,3/11/2015,Great service! Great food!! BEST margarita grilled chicken and mac n cheese I've ever had at a Chilis.  I eat this meal 2-3 times a a month at Chilis all over TX and OK...this was the best. Hope the others take note.
Anonymous N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,6,1.0,1/19/2015,"I was here last Saturday with my sis in law. We were seated promptly, assigned a waiter and our orders were taken. I ordered chicken wings for appetizers  the trio fajita and half rack of ribs a side of veggies and rice, while my sis in law ordered their new grilled salmon over rice and veggie. I specifically told this waiter I want my steak on the fajita well done. (Cannot eat rare meat because of personal reasons). The food came on time but the chicken wings were too crunchy and dry. Couldn't even taste any sauce on it.  steak was pink in the middle and the whole trio was tasteless. A little salt for me goes a long way but his dish was so bland I had to put some seasoning on it. The rice with the ribs were cold not even close to warm broccoli tasted uncooked, and hard. My in-law salmon was the only warm thing on her plate everything was stone cold and dry from veggies to the rice. I had a big appetite when I left home but I brought everything else back from chillies home to reseasoned it and warm it up. When I mentioned it to the waiter he didn't even make any effort to apologize.  This is the first chiilis place I've stepped since I relocated from California and I won't be coming back to this place ever again."
Matthew P.,"Wylie, TX",68,10,2,4.0,8/21/2015,"I'm giving 5 stars to our server Jamie, she was great! And 4 stars for the restaurant. Not only did she remember who I was from a previous visit but she was rocking the bar section by herself after another employee walked out during lunch rush. If you go here ask for her section she will definitely treat you right!"
Katie C.,"Plano, TX",52,51,6,2.0,5/21/2015,Every incarnation of the menu gets worse and worse. I miss the chili tacos and Chilis trip burger. I miss the way it was but they keep trying for something new. Service is lacking as well
Mike V.,"Allen, TX",54,294,129,1.0,3/31/2014,"This Chili's location currently ranks within the Top 5 worst Food Safety Scores  within the City of Allen. This review reflects that and will be updated when The City of Allen's ratings reflect that this location's scores aren't on that list any longer.  Chili's Grill & Bar 903 W. McDermott Dr. SCORE: 73 Date of Score: 8/19/2013 Personally, I'm extremely disappointed to see this. As a multi billion dollar public company, Brinker should have policies in place as well as internal staff dedicated to ensure food Safety. Although this isn't the absolute worst score in Allen. This says volumes about the company and its priorities."
Sahsa O.,"Dallas, TX",0,44,3,5.0,8/14/2015,I had a good experience here with my family. I came in for lunch with the family and sat at the bar area. The waitress was really good and attentive.  She didn't need to be so fast and she was and checked on us at appropriate times. Food was not bad either. Will totally be back.
