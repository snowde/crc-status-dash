Loni H.,"Allen, TX",19,13,1,1.0,5/24/2015,"It's very hit and miss as to the service and food quality at this location.  Seriously, how hard is it to cook a bacon cheeseburger well and serve it plain and dry?  First time it came to the table it was dressed with everything.  The second time it came to the table, it came with 2 mini cups of pickles in spite of the fact that I had specified no pickles and my friend had said yeah, she really hates pickles and doesn't want them anywhere near her.   The manager-type did offer me a soup or salad while I had to wait for my burger to be remade.  Our server disappeared after the burger and pickles snafu and it was hard to get refills on our beverages (water).   The chicken crispers were overcooked and very dry."
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,3.0,11/4/2013,"I've been here so many times because my family is in Allen. Half the restaurant is a bar which is great fun for football games and hanging out with friends The other side is the restaurant and because it's a little small you may have to wait a bit, but the customer service is good! I dropped a star because several times they have got orders wrong. I don't blame this on the servers who assured us they put it in right, but clearly the kitchen doesn't always read the tickets right. Once they get that straightened out, they'd easily be 4 stars!"
Elizabeth R.,"Rowlett, TX",0,18,,1.0,1/9/2015,"Been there three times this past month, and each time I've gotten something different. I wasn't a huge fan to begin with, because you have to pay for your chips and salsa, whereas places like on the border, offer them complimentary. My husband enjoys their southwest egg rolls but to me, everything tastes pre-packaged and microwaved. The service is great but other than that, I would never recommend going here."
Natalie C.,"McKinney, TX",7,22,2,1.0,9/14/2014,"We went here for dinner last night. We ordered drinks, guac and chips, and our food. Our drinks came out and food, but no appetizers. We also never saw our waiter after that. Thankfully, we were able to checkout without waiting and the chips and guac werent on it. The burger was greasy and the food was okay. We won't be back."
Jean L.,"Barrie, Canada",176,55,22,3.0,5/6/2012,"Chili's offers a decent $20 dinner combo for two. We usually start off with the guac and chips, and hubby orders the chicken fajitas and I'll get the 6 oz steak. I like that they have a cheap menu - it makes me feel like it's okay to not make dinner more often. The downside to their cheap menu is I sometimes feel like the waiters pay more attention to the larger tables where they can make bigger tips. The last time we were there, my steak was undercooked. Instead of waiting in the kitchen for the extra minute to have them cook it a little longer, our waiter hit up three different tables and it seemed like it was 8 minutes before I got my steak. By then my husband had nearly finished his meal.  My feedback would be, if there is a small issue like that with meals, the waiter should have someone bring it right to the table from the kitchen. Then my side dishes would not have been sitting under a heat lamp for such a long time.  We'll still go, because it's decent food and it is a cheap night out. But for great service, I usually  take myself there for lunch and there is a dedicated crew of servers who work hard for their tips."
Heather S.,"Allen, TX",0,23,,1.0,1/31/2014,"Every time we go to Chili's my husband vows it is the last time.  At this location we ordered an app and our dinners. He specifically asked the app come before the meal (you really shouldn't have to request  this, it used to be assumed) Sure enough... it came out at the same time as the main course. I don't know why so many places can not get this right. We were about to send the app back saying we didn't want it anymore. A manager came by and took our main course back to the kitchen. I asked if it was going to be remade and she assured me that it was.  When we got the main course it was obvious it was the same food just put under a heat lamp. My husband couldn't finish more than a couple bites of his order. The chicken was like rubber.  I picked my hamburger apart bc the bun was inedible and ate half of the burger patty.  We got fast food on the way home."
Kristin B.,"Dallas, TX",7,11,,1.0,3/11/2013,"I didn't want to give any stars but Yelp requires at least 1 star.  We sat at a table in the bar area and got no service.  2 people walked by without a word and 1 person said they would be right back and they never did.  We asked for a manager, she tried to get us to stay but we weren't.  Left and most likely won't be back."
Curtis Humanities S.,"Allen, TX",0,21,2,4.0,6/3/2014,"The Big Chili: Chili's Review                                                                                   2EE On May 31, 2014, my father and I went out to eat at Chili's. We arrived around 6 PM, ready to see what they had in store for us today. We got out of the car and were welcomed by a clean parking lot, a greeter at the door, and a comfortable setting in the restaurant.  Atmosphere *** - The parking lot was clean with quite a few cars here and there. There was no trash on the sidewalks or in the parking lot. I did notice, however, that there were a few cigarette butts on the lawn outside of the restaurant. There were flowers out front, with a clean sidewalk with a strip of land with rocks on it next to it. The bushes were neatly trimmed and the trees were neatly trimmed as well. There were no leaves or branches on the ground and the gardening was clean and neat. The restaurant had a Tex-Mex theme with the Chili's sign with a giant chili next to it. Unfortunately, there was no greeter there to open the door for us, so we walked in ourselves. Once we were inside, a young lady stood there ready to seat us. She smiled and made eye contact with us immediately. She said hello and made some small talk with us. She was standing at attention and not slouching over or looking annoyed. She looked ready to greet anyone who walked through the doors. The restaurant had a dim lighting to it, but there was enough light to see thanks to the electrical system and plenty of windows. The noise wasn't a big issue; we could talk at a comfortable level and still hear the other person clearly. There was light music playing in the background which added to a comfortable setting. When we arrived at our booth, it was wiped down and clean. There was no trash on the table, floor, or bench where we sat. I looked at my utensils and they were pretty clean. I happened to notice that there was a spot on my knife. I scratched at it, and they spot came off. So my knife wasn't completely clean, it still had food on it.  Service **** - Once we were seated, a waiter quickly came over to serve us. He smiled, made eye contact, and said hello. We ordered our drinks and were served quickly after. He was fast about it. While my father and I talked, the waiter brought a refill without asking for my dad. That was very kind of him, and smart too. We ordered our food, and waited until it came. They had a small ""tablet"" where you could play games while you waited or ate. Unfortunately, there was one glitch out of the many times we did trivia.  Food *** - When our food finally arrived, it wasn't cold, but not hot either. It was still pretty warm when it arrived. Our burgers were warm and juicy. The fries were salty and still warm and not cold. The food was pretty good, and the comfortable setting made it even better. When we were finished, I ordered a chocolate milkshake to go. It was in a Styrofoam cup with a straw ready to go in it. The shake was thick, and a little hard to get out of the straw, but it was cold and tasted a lot like chocolate.  Overall**** (4 stars) - Chili's is a good, clean restaurant you will want to visit if you want a comfortable setting for a family, or a dinner for two. The food and presentation was good, the setting was great, and the service was fast. To have dinner at a restaurant would take about an hour and thirty minutes. It took us forty minutes to get in and out, which was fast. Chili's is a restaurant I highly recommend to have lunch or dinner at."
Bill L.,"Allen, TX",25,6,,2.0,1/20/2013,"Pretty decent food is overwhelmed by smoke in the non-smoking section. The laughable partition between the areas is completely ineffective, as people(servers) walking between the areas pull in clouds of smoke to the non-smoking area. Just gross. We used to eat here all the time, but there are tons of other, better, options in Allen that are smoke free."
Carla S.,"Allen, TX",2,172,1,3.0,9/2/2013,"Picking up to-go orders is nice, friendly and usually quick.  I love their salads and sometimes swing by on my way home from work to get one.  The dining room service isn't as good so i don't often dine in especially when I'm by myself.  It's clean and again, I love their salads."
Francis D.,"Little Elm, TX",1,1,,1.0,12/15/2013,Horrible service doesnt even describe it!  Waited for over an hour for incorrect order and cold food.  Manager Crystal was incredibly rude.  Unacceptable unless you like being treated like they are doing you a favor.  They offeed to take care of our bill when we were not even interested in eating the food.  We didnt want free dinner.  We wanted good service and the food we had ordered.  I will be contacting their manager Chanda Kelly.
Deni G.,"Allen, TX",1,28,3,3.0,1/18/2016,"Average experience. It was early on a slow Monday evening. Walked in and waited a couple minutes to be greeted and seated. Finally what seemed to be Bus boy seated us after walking us around the whole dinning area. Sat down with menus, looked through them and decided what we wanted. Again waited a few minutes wondering if we had a waitstaff. Finally a waitress showed up and took our drink order. Then food order. Chips and guacamole were very good. We both ordered bacon burger. The burger was ok, but too much sauce (whatever kind it was, it was not too complementary to the burger. It also made the burger messy and difficult to eat.) and a little too much pepper (and I like pepper.) we had to flag the waitress down for a drink refill.  We had a gift card that covered the cost of the meal. Paid with the table kiosk, but wanted to give the waitress the tip. Never saw her again. She kept hiding in the back. I hate leaving cash on the table, so I hope she got it."
Kelsey M.,"McKinney, TX",86,15,39,4.0,1/10/2011,"I went here this past friday and figured it would be like ever other chain Chili's. I was actually pleasntly surprised. One one side they had normal bar where many had crowded to watch the A&M and LSU game, while the other side was the normal table area. Thats where i noticed the biggest change.  The decor was very modern and fun. The booths were comfy and roomy and the menus were already at the table (no hostess needed). I was already beginning to be impressed.  The next thing was the menu, they had some really good but different foods than what I have come to expect from the average bar and grill place. I had the cream corn soup and the chicken margaherita. Both excellent.  The service was excellent as well they had 2 large parties (20+) from what I could see and there was neither a problem from the waitstaff nor the kitchen.  Needless to say I will definitely be back."
D C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,6,3,5.0,1/27/2013,"I see that there are several negative reviews for this particular Chili's but I believe the experience just depends on your waiter or waitress. We enjoyed a family outing last Friday night and, both, the food and the service were great. I wish I could remember our waitresses name, but she was great. She even gave us to-go drink cups in the end. 5 stars for this Chili's"
Melissa F.,"Plano, TX",3,7,,1.0,11/1/2011,"This Chilis has been consistantly bad.  I have been there for lunch at / just after the lunch rush (11:00 ish - 2:00 ish).  All three times I've been to this location, the servers were nowhere to be found, our orders were incorrect, and the food was bleh.  Therefore, I invoked the three-strike rule.  Sad, because it's a very convenient locale. The second time we went there, I ordered the chicken quesadillas on the lunch menu, and my companion had a burger (which, once again, they screwed up).  40 minutes later, no food.  Keep in mind, it took about 20 minutes just to get regular drinks and order the food, so now we're at 60 minutes (and we're on lunch break!).  The tables around us were pretty empty, I guess they just had one or two servers?  I wouldn't have as big a problem if it was crowded...but the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full. Anyway, the manager comes over to ask how our experience was, and we told him.  He said he'd fix us up with coupons for next time - and handed over a whopping $5.00 Chilis Bucks thing.  Hey, thanks, man. This last time, again, hardly any people in the tables, but our food took over 45 minutes to come.  When it finally did (after the waitress actually threw her hands up when we dared to ask about it for a second time - and no, we were not rude), it was the wrong thing for two out of three orders!  Ended up leaving without hardly eating anything, and what we had was again bleh. I will not be going there again.  If you like Chilis food, I'm guessing this is typical fare - but you'd better be ready to cough up some serious wait time and deal with substandard service if you come to this location around lunch time. Boo, Chilis!"
Rebecca G.,"Allen, TX",61,303,641,3.0,6/5/2011,"Boneless buffalo wings are great. Sante Fe Spring Rolls are even better. Yum. We are always happy with our orders...ribs, burgers, sandwiches, etc. This time we ordered one Patron pomegranate margarita, not realizing it was $8.79 ish. Dang. Not cool. Mango margarita on the other hand is an amazing drink at a normal price. Service was very good. They have a bar which allows smoking. The smoke doe NOT make its way into the restaurant. They often (always?) have a great deal for 2 people (2 meals, one appetizer, one desert, $20?). They have a great To Go system too; very efficient."
John C.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,2,,4.0,1/3/2012,Whoever comes in here needs to visit Richard.. He is by far the best server I have had in a LONG time.
Jarrod W.,"Allen, TX",1,4,,5.0,10/30/2012,"I have been to a lot of Chilis and it is about what you would expect. Not great, but ok to Good. I have to say that this one on two separate occasions had exceptional service, especially for children. I wish I knew their names so their manager would reward them."
Rodney H.,"Allen, TX",1,3,,1.0,5/26/2012,"Had not eaten at a Chili's in quite some time - today I was reminded why, the food is just terrible now. Just wanted to have good simple meal and didn't get any of that! Will not return to this Chili's again and I am now suspect of the rest of the chain but might be willing to try a different location."
Amanda G.,"Little Elm, TX",107,172,59,3.0,12/4/2011,It's just like every Chili's I have been to. I am a fan of the Enchilada soup and the bottomless soup and salad. It's cheap and yummy. I think they have done away with the healthy food options and that is why Only 3 stars.
