Bryce G.,"Allen, TX",1,27,1,2.0,2/12/2011,"Food and service are good, but the cigarette smoke from the bar is overwhelming when you enter and leave."
Mathilde Y.,"Allen, TX",1,41,,4.0,7/31/2011,"Mac n cheese (kids meal)-standard kraft Fajitas-very tasty. Sometimes takes up alot space on the table with the tortillas. Watch out, they're hot. Old timer(hamburger)- very good Love their chips and salsa."
Bob T.,"Plano, TX",15,72,2,4.0,1/7/2012,"Came here just before Christmas. The food was pretty good and the service was excellent. I love the southwestern eggrolls and the presidente margaritas. This place is great for friends, a date, or taking the family. All around good place with good food."
Eddie B.,"McKinney, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2013,was there on Sunday 12/1 around 5pm.  Lots of apparent regulars at the bar and they got service.  we waited 15 minutes for a server.  I finally asked the bartender (who knew when we sat down) to point me in the direction of the table so we could be served.  Food was good once we got it.  Another ding for the salt on my glass when I asked to have it omitted.  Poor service.
Tim S.,"Plano, TX",98,498,382,4.0,9/4/2010,"I usually like to stick to reviewing small, local places and suddenly was reminded that Chili's was a small local business that is still local if not small. This Chili's is especially nice. It has newer, more modern interior than most Chili's. Chili's is one of those places where you know what to expect and it is pretty much the same everywhere. My family really likes it, which means pleasing everyone from 12- 70 years of age. And that says alot."
Nancy S.,"Allen, TX",0,3,,4.0,4/16/2012,"Got the $20 Dinner for two people deal. We ordered cheese fries for appetizer which was good, altho I don't think anyone is capable of messing up cheese fries. For entree, my husband got half ribs and I got quesadilla. Ribs were a little dry but had good flavor to it. Quesadilla was really good. Overall we had a great dinner for under $30."
Allison W.,"Allen, TX",0,3,,5.0,5/10/2010,"Quick and polite staff.  They nevermind special orders, even the difficult ones that have to cater to food allergies.  Food is always fresh and hot when served.  Great employees from the hostesses at the door to the wait staff!!  Real standout employees are Manager Edgar, also Amber and Marcus.  Mega standout is Shonda who is bartender and server.  While being a bartender still some how is able to get orders out to the mutiple table around the bar.  When at lunch during work this is an very valuable thing!"
