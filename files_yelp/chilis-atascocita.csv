Shelly P.,"Atascocita, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/20/2017,Excellent service tonight & great food! Atmosphere was great! Had a little one and waiter was very attentive to him! Ranchero tacos were fresh & filling. Kids grilled cheese & mandarin oranges were yummy & he loved the Blue Fizz drink!
W R.,"Dayton, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,Don't go to this location unless you want to wait for service.  This has happened more than once but last night was the last straw.  Host sat us down next to 2 parties of people lets just say they got helped don't want to lose that tip.  We sat their for 20 minutes and not even acknowledged everyone walked by at least once or twice.  Went back to the host sent a waiter over but he told us he was getting off and our waitress was putting in an order and will be right back talk about nerve.  10 mins later walked out while watching others getting sitted and served.  This was on a saturday but at 500 before it even gets busy.  I called on the phone talked to the asst mgr.  gave me an excuse that 2 people where out and short handed but the 2 tables of 10 of more which we were in between where serviced terrible excuse.  What makes it funny she was one of the ones who walked by or table no word.     STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE IF YOU WANT TO AGE.
Gaby C.,"Houston, TX",18,16,3,1.0,7/11/2017,"We have gotten to the restaurant about 10:15 on a Tuesday night. We were trying to set at the bar a very rude guy full of tattoos told us that ""Are have been close "" well I just come in.. not that I have been there all night too know that. Them they have sent us to the restaurant are.  Another rude guys with a big beard was trying to get our drinks very rude.. until I have asked him if he was in a bad mood?? He has responded that he not supposed to be there . So , That is not my fault....  you are getting  pay to do your job..  finally a very  nice waitress come in our rescue.  Let just mention that we were celebrating my sister wedding anniversary and the first time that my nephew come to visit me.."
Danielle L.,"Coldspring, TX",0,28,23,1.0,7/24/2017,First of all this place smells like a Mc'Donalds playground room. The food is horrible and I will never waste money here ever again. Very nasty place!
James F.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,,5.0,1/13/2017,Returned today after getting our previous problem worked out with new General Manager Matt. Totally different atmosphere!!  Our server Melissa was excellent along with her teammate.  The food was hot and tasty. It's obvious that big changes have been made to this location since September. They go from 0 stars to a 5 star experience for us Matt addressed the original problem in a timely fashion even reaching out by phone to speak directly to me. The assistant manager who came to the table today was very pleasant as well and knows her job well. Great customer interaction and service also.  Overall night and day experience from September.
Ashten P.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,1.0,12/1/2017,"Service was good, food took a little while and came out barely warm. They advertise more food/ larger servings but the chicken tenders were small & soggy. Do not get the fajita plate. Shrimp was terrible and beef wasn't good quality. Better order an additional side of guacamole because it comes with a little drop. I shouldn't be surprised since it's chili's but the new commercials seemed promising and the food looked so good. Will not be going back to a chili's, there is too many places these days with good food with decent prices. Honestly we don't mind paying more as long as the food is good!"
Melissa J.,"Humble, TX",38,25,2,1.0,7/7/2017,Was seated very quickly for a Friday night. However we sat there for 15 minutes waiting to get our drink order. The damn manager even walked by at least 10 times. No one even stopped us as we walked out the door! Unbelievable!
Garrett T.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",37,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,Worst lunch at any restaurant I have ever been too.  They have items showing on the menu.  The chicken I ordered was look warm.  Manager did not care at all about my complaints will never ever come back.
Dana P.,"Kingwood, TX",14,7,26,2.0,12/2/2016,I am not really sure how you run out of food at a restaurant. This location of Chili's is the only restaurant this has ever happened to me with main dishes. I don't know if I just have bad luck? Last time we ordered they were out of the Dr Pepper ribs my husband ordered and then also out of the beer ribs we tried to order in their place. This time tonight they were out of pork carnitas for the fajita combo and then the most surprising thing they were out of...Southwest Egg rolls! I mean come guys it's Friday night. It's just odd to not have core menu items going into the weekend and again something that I have never seen at a chain restaurant.
Barry P.,"Humble, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/7/2017,"This was a sad Friday night. Food cost more but it taste less. Old, cold food and just everything was a horrible sitcom. I never complain but asked for the manager this time. The manager couldn't have been over 22 years of age. He offered to take off one item, which was a joke. Old, refried or re-microwaved junk. We were regulars but this was it for us."
Debbie S.,"Humble, TX",36,1,3,5.0,10/16/2016,The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is great and Spicy!!!! And the bartender Henry gives GREAT service!
Sara W.,"Spring, TX",4,24,2,1.0,7/3/2016,"Not the best experience at this location tonight. They were super slow and we were at the restaurant 1 hour 45 mins. The new sunrise burger came highly recommended by our server, after waiting a while for our food everything came except this burger. Apparently it was burnt and being remade. New burger comes and egg not cooked as requested (over medium) and completely missing the bacon (a highlight when originally told to order this). Several mins later, as everyone else was almost done eating, bacon was brought out The table across from us sat and received drinks but was not checked on or asked for their order for quite a while (we placed order, appetizer came, and ate all of our chips and salsa before they ordered). Another table remained dirty almost our entire dining experience.....what could the staff be doing on such a slow night???"
Kirsty K.,"Humble, TX",0,8,61,5.0,1/8/2017,"2nd time in Chillis and yet again the standout was service. We waited for a table and when seated waited for service - all was explained by Steven/Stephen (new staff and lack of communication). He was, without a doubt, one of the best that I've had the pleasure to meet since moving from the U.K. - efficient, attentive and personable. We have 2 kids and a toddler and he placed his chair perfectly and moved my bag in the process (usually a seat is dumped next to us). We don't eat out often, since having a baby even less, but with service like Steven's/Stephen's it reminded me of why we decided to move. The food was good but the service was commendable!"
Renee M.,"Humble, TX",28,1,,1.0,6/27/2017,After a long day at work ordered curbside. They said it would be ready at 6:25 pulled up at 6:15. Young lady came out with the bag and told us to have a good day.  Before pulling off I decided to check the order and it was incorrect. I went back inside and waited. The same young lady came towards me with a box in her hand and said oh I'm sorry this is yours. We traded the incorrect items and we headed home with our food. Kind of defeated the curbside pickup. However once we got home the food was old and cold. My husband had ordered the ribs and I ordered some new item that had smoked sausage. The sausage was cold and very greasy and the ribs my husband ordered we're also cold. I paid an extra 3.25 for a side salad and the lettuce was brown. Even our drinks were flat! I live at best five minutes from the Chili's in Atascocita. It just seems like over the years their service is failing. Lots of employees standing around and not much work getting done. Nearly $40 spent and so not worth it!!
Karen F.,"Houston, TX",1,1,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Very disappointed. My iced tea was never refilled and I never got any ice. It took at least 15 minutes to get the dessert. I ordered chipotle wings but received chicken tenders instead (they were overcooked). To rectify it I was brought a bowl of chipotle Bbq sauce.  Overall the service, the food, and overall atmosphere was pathetic."
Crystal T.,"Humble, TX",22,112,93,5.0,3/6/2015,"Much, much better than the old Chili's! Everyone in our party was pleased with their order and the food came to the table in good time. New atmosphere is cool! After avoiding Chili's two years, we're happy about the changes."
Marc S.,"Humble, TX",149,107,592,2.0,10/11/2014,"If you're reading this, you've probably been to a Chili's in your lifetime. You've probably ordered their 2 for $20 special and you probably enjoyed it and probably went home satisfied. Waiting for the food here is dumb though. Way too long for a small group."
Alayka R.,"Humble, TX",1,14,7,1.0,1/8/2016,"I moved to the area a few years ago, I first had Chili's a far ways from here (Germany) and it was my favorite restaurant. Now, after the renovation and I guess new management the quality of food, service, and cleanliness dropped... We went here after the renovations finished and we did the 2/$20. He got the steak and asked for medium-rare and it came out rare. It came back a second time and was still rare.  Then we went again, gave it a chance and same thing happened. So now, we don't go there anymore we avoid it."
ChelleBelle V.,"Houston, TX",7,58,151,4.0,8/15/2014,The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the bathroom was a mess and although toilet paper was all over the floor the rolls were empty in the stalls. Bathrooms are VERY important to families!!!  The food and service was perfect!! Our drinks were filled promptly and our order was served hot n fresh.  My daughter had the lunch special that included a soup & main dish. She chose the baked potato soup which I tasted and it is so creamy and good!! Then she had the fresh mex salad that she loved. She had it with the chipotle grilled chicken and it was so fresh and full of flavor. I opted foe the side salad and avocado bacon chicken sandwich. It comes on a pretzel bun but I asked for the wheat Texas toast and it was YUMMY! The tx toast actually tasted homemade with a kittle honey wheat flavor. I'm loving their new menu. For a chain restaurant they have a good menu going and we will be back sooner than later.  Our server was great and we arrived just as they opened so there was no wait. Disappointed that they still allow smoking but fortunately no smokers had arrived during our time there. We do avoid going there for dinner just for that reason though.  Thanks for the great meal!

Karla M.,"Houston, TX",65,18,14,1.0,12/27/2015,The waiter was super sweet but we got two dirty dishes and that made me lose my appetite. The food was good and took longer than usual to come out but one of the forks and one of the small plates were dirty. That's just gross.
Charlene T.,"Humble, TX",38,14,10,1.0,1/31/2016,"Placed order for 2 meals (burger and Caribbean shrimp salad), it took 50 minutes to get order, and it was not busy.  When salad came, the shrimp was covered in Cajun spices and very spicy.  Asked waitress to remove the salad due to the spices and take off the ticket.  She send the manager over to address the issue, and she was extremely rude. We WILL NOT return."
Joey R.,"Humble, TX",53,199,57,1.0,6/8/2015,I give him - 5 stars got the balsamic garlic tomatoes smallest little tiny thing ever and very inconsistent food this place sucks don't go here
Natalie D.,"Humble, TX",0,21,,1.0,12/9/2016,"We used to frequent this location fairly regular but the last three times we've visited the service has been sub par.   The last visit the waitress started by being snarky to my four year old daughter when taking our orders.    My husband and I both ordered the bottomless soup and salad ... which I specifically said ""bottomless"".   She brought us the wrong soups and when I asked about the salad that was brought being Fresca (basically just lettuce) I inquired because I thought it had an option for garden.   She told me I was incorrect.   I had to get a menu and show her that the bottomless did.   I asked twice for the chips and salsa that is supposed to be included and we never got it.   The SECOND time I reminded her she just said oh I didn't put the order in.  Really?  After being reminded twice?  No apology at any time for any mistakes and just a total blasé attitude.   At this point we were through with our meal.   We also received no drink refills at any point.   Let me add the restaurant did not appear busy in the least.  I can understand mistakes happen but this was the third visit in a row that the service has been pretty terrible.   We are not likely to give them another chance.  :("
Geraldo T.,"Humble, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2017,"The waitress never once checked on us, gave us spoiled kernel corn and said ""I don't smell anything wrong with this one, but this one does smell bad"". Never gave me options of sides, instead she brought the plate with random sides, broccoli that still had a hard texture to it."
Willie F.,"Humble, TX",89,81,87,4.0,7/2/2015,"Big difference from our last visit.  We were seated immediately, had a great waiter, and a very good meal.  There were 5 of us there tonight and everyone was please.  Chili con Queso was hot with just a small amount of spicy ness. I also had the California club.  It huge and prepared perfectly.  We are looking forward to our next visit."
Tracy O.,"Humble, TX",0,9,,2.0,9/22/2016,The food is good but I can't believe there are still restaurants that allow smoking in them. Although it is just in the bar area you can smell the smoke throughout the non smoking area as well.
Alexis A.,"Tyler, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2016,Horrible service!!!! The lady didn't ask if we wanted refills for our drinks. Took FOREVER to get our order! Food was cold!! The ONLY time she was quick when we asked for the check!
Nancy F.,"Humble, TX",0,5,1,1.0,12/18/2016,Hate to even give 1 star. We waited 10 minutes and no one even bothered to ask what we wanted to drink!! We walked out. This is a sorry ass place!!
Toi T.,"Porter, TX",0,46,44,4.0,2/28/2016,"This Chili's has been updated and it looks nice. It has more of a simple and clean design. We went on a Saturday night and it was full, about 5-10 minute seating wait. Our waitress was nice. The place looked clean but our table felt sticky. We only ordered dessert and it came out in a reasonable amount of time. The person I was with ordered the Chocolate Molten cake which is a favorite of theirs. I do not like the cake which always tastes processed. I  tried the Triple Berry crumble which tasted like a buttery pound cake with the sanded sugar on top sprinkled with tart berries and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. I ate it all by myself."
DeWayne R.,"Houston, TX",161,567,283,4.0,3/3/2014,"My significant other  ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and the cook had the audacity to send the bun out BURNED on both sides (and the chicken was overcooked). I felt like I was on an episode of KITCHEN NIGHTMARES and I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to walk out any minute. She was starving and just opted to get the bun changed out for a fresh one. The buffalo sauce had been cooked into the batter and it looked like a fried Snickers from the carnival. WTF?! I despise stupid cooks who just don't give a damn!  The only reason Chili's get 4 stars is because...well, it's Chili's and every experience hasn't been like this. Also, the server (whom I believe was also a manager or something) was pretty attentive and made it easy to get the order corrected, BUT seemed clueless on the fact that the chicken should been changes out, too. I'm just saying, you can see that it isn't dripping with buffalo sauce. Sheesh!"
Savannah C.,"Humble, TX",491,38,52,1.0,3/12/2015,"This place has the absolute worst management that I have ever experienced. Do not bother doing the call ahead seating. You will show up to be informed that you were never added to the list and now there is a 45 minute wait. Also, they are always extremely understaffed and it takes forever to get your food out. On a positive note they have good drinks and the food is usually okay. Too bad I will not be returning after 4bad experiences in a row... Not giving them another chance"
Lisa C.,"Humble, TX",448,799,359,1.0,10/9/2014,"Chili's, I never really liked you but now you've reached the stage where I say enough is enough.  We went there after finding another local eatery stuffed to the gills with people and folks waiting in line.  Chili's had spots open in the parking lot, so OK, they're not slammed. WEEEELLLLL, we get inside and 1/3 to 1/2 of the tables are empty.  The four people in front of us talk the the hostess and she tells them to wait.  Huh?  Then we say ""Two please"" and she says ""It will be 15 to 20 minutes.""  I give her the look that says ""Say whaaat?""  She says ""Oh, the kitchen is really backed up.""  Um, your place is about half full.  So hub and I say, ""Not only no, but heck no.""  What the heck?  This is not the only weirdness we have experienced here so that's it.  We're done with you, crazy American family fun chain location.  Butt-plug (see my earlier review for that reference)."
John S.,"Humble, TX",29,1,,1.0,11/10/2015,Atascocita chilis is the worst service of any place I have ever been in my life. They need to close the place down the management obviously does not care about Service to his customers. I cannot rate the food because the last three times I've been here after 30 minute wait I'm not even getting my drinks I've not been able to taste the food. Go away make room for something else better
Diane N.,"Porter, TX",19,27,,1.0,12/5/2015,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Went there for my Hubby's birthday celebration. Our party Had 11 people. We were there for 20 minutes before getting drinks. Food came out sporadically, so basically half of the guests were finished eating before the rest of the people had food. I never got my order after 1.5 hours of being at the restaurant. Beware! Eat at the Chilis near 59 instead of this one!!!"
Yolanda H.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,5.0,9/25/2016,"Beemer was our server, and did an awesome job, very attentive to our needs. The food was ok,"
Joey H.,"Humble, TX",0,34,,2.0,10/26/2015,"The food is typical for Chili's - okay and the menu is kind of all over the place.  What distinguishes this from other Chili's is the terrible wait service.  I've been there four times and it seems to get worse each time.  Tonight was the last time -  we went in around six with our five year old son, and the place was just over half full.  We were seated quickly and then waited fifteen minutes for our waitress.  The waitress seemed to be deliberately ignoring us and we finally said something to the hostess about how she hadn't even bothered to say ""hi"" or take our drink order after being there 20 minutes.  The hostess assured us the waitress would be over in just a couple of minutes.  8 minutes later, we were still sitting at the table with no drinks and a fussy kid.  A family of nine or more came in and sat down, and the waitress immediately went over and took their orders while looking at us like ""ha, look what I just did"".  Anyway, we immediately left after letting one of the manager's know what happened.  I don't particularly like giving bad reviews, but this Chili's has truly earned it.  Part of me thinks they deserve one star, but their food, while not great, is pretty consistent with other chili's. Don't just take my word on this, read the other reviews...;BAD BAD SERVICE    NOTE - went back seven months later and the service was much better so I bumped it up one star 5-8-17 - Took that star back.  Recently went back to Chili's and they no longer have chicken fried steak or gravy to go with any of their sides.  The last time I went there, some people in the back of the restaurant (employees working in the back), got into an argument and started yelling at each other -  everyone in the restaurant could hear it."
Katherine K.,"Channelview, TX",23,10,1,1.0,8/2/2015,I'll never go back to this chilis ever again... The food was horrible! My boneless wings were hard and the new onion rings suck! The only thing good was the southwestern Mac and cheese! The coke was horrible the dr pepper didn't taste much better! My bf ordered a margarita and when I seen it I was like that looks like crap and well he said it taste like crap too! Ended up paying way to much for food that was horrible! I should have went to lupe tortilla or something and got better food for the same price!!!!! I am now paying the price I have gotten sick to my stomach 2 times! Since leaving there!
Stan A.,"Houston, TX",0,23,,3.0,7/31/2015,"Not sure what is going on at this location service wise, but they are about to lose a long time customer. The food was good as always, but the last three trips have delivered bad service. The waitress this time was very polite, but didn't have it together. When we sat down, our drinks came right away, but no silverware or napkins. We finally asked for napkins thinking she would notice no silverware, nope. When our food arrived, we still had no silverware & had to ask for it & ketchup for the fries. We got the silverware but after 10 minutes had to make a second request for ketchup. It finally came, but was nearly empty. I am not blaming the waitress, this is a poor management issue, especially since service has been poor the last three trips. Not good Chilis, get it together & train your workers!"
Xander A.,"Humble, TX",38,4,1,3.0,4/27/2015,"The food here is dependibly good.  However they seem to be having problems with the service at this location.  Again today, we had to wait over 10 minutes before any waitstaff came by.  I had to go back to the hostess and ask if we were going to be waited on.  So, the hostess took our drink order, then a waiter appeared a minute later to again take our drink order and explain that our table was at the edge of someone's station and no one was sure who was responsible for us.  Then a waitress showed up to actually take our food order.  I asked her if anyone else would be joining us.  After that things went smoothly. I did overhear the manager apologizing to the table behind us about their food.  Not a good thing to hear On several occasions now we have had to wait to be seated while the restaurant was barely one third full.  This location is developing some problems that need to be addressed."
Christy P.,"Houston, TX",40,46,2,1.0,5/30/2016,"I wish I had checked Yelp before dining here. We just had a terrible experience. Walked in and they weren't even that busy. Waited to be seated. Finally seated 5 minutes later. Only to wait another 15 minutes for someone to finally come check on us. At this point we should of walked out because already the service was so bad (non-existent) but we stayed. I ordered a grilled chicken salad which was tasteless and the chicken was barely cooked and cold. I hope I don't get sick. My husband's meal was brought out incorrectly, too. We got mis-charged on the receipt. We will not be back. I wouldn't recommend this Chili's location to anyone which is a shame since it's a brand new restaurant. Customer service is everything, people. Maybe they'll get it together one day. Update: My husband was violently ill after eating here. They definitely gave him a horrible bout of food poisoning. Save yourself and don't DINE at this awful Chili's... there are plenty of other great places to try in the area."
