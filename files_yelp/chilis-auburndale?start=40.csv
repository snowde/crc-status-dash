G. A.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,21,1,2.0,5/24/2014,Unwelcoming place that needs to update some of its employees to a friendlier generation.  Food was ok though.
Dreama W.,"Auburndale, FL",0,2,12,1.0,5/23/2015,"Ok. Where do I start... Well first when we sat down there was no utensils or napkins. Then  when we ordered appetizers they didn't offer chips and salsa, which are suppose to be free, and when we asked for them they wanted to charge us. Then we ordered the FRIED pickles, and when they came out 15 minutes later they weren't even fried. And I'm pretty sure they just used cucumbers, cause they didn't even taste like pickles. Then when we ordered our food we kept getting a lot of I don't knows and no we don't have that. When the menu clearly says you do! The waitress ignored us most of the time. Then every time I tried to ask for something They would just walk by, look at me and keep walking! Now when the food came out the ribs were cold, the chicken wasn't grilled and the macaroni wasn't the way it should be. So not only will we not be coming back here, others who read this shouldn't go either."
Richard K.,"Houston, TX",102,130,32,2.0,3/27/2012,"this place was horrible, here is the list: -host does not acknowledge you. -menu he was pretending to clean was not clean- it was sticky AND gritty, which is a strange combination -Waitress Team did not work out, I guess each of them thought someone else was serving me.  Neither waitress was good and neither asked how I was doing.  All I got out of them was excuses.  Really, the first waitress says, ""High Im XXX, I got caught making a desert and didnt have time to come over here.""  What I heard was YOU suck and all these other people are eating and well, Ill get to  you when I can. -Brocoli was gritty, same stuff from the menus????  not sure -basically I got tired of asking for stuff  AND no, I did not even complain, I did not ask for anything other than onions on my chili and  hot sauce.  Ill let you guess how that went. Im a big fan of Brinker (chilis owner), work with a lot of them, but this restaurant was the worst Ive been to."

Patty M.,"St. Charles, MO",0,11,18,3.0,4/29/2014,"We walked in to a nearly empty restaurant mid afternoon with a group of about forty after a high school baseball game.  We were treated as unwelcome intruders with the server dictating how we had to sit in groups that wanted to share a check, etc. This woman definitely had an attitude. We were ready to take our business  elsewhere when server Vickie asked how she could help and said she would be happy to serve our group in a manner that we found most convenient. We agreed to stay with the understanding that we would not encounter the uncooperative server again. Vickie, Torme and a couple of other ladies did a wonderful job and were friendly. When we voiced our concerns with the manager he made the standard apology but defended the rude server saying she reacted that way because there was only one server on duty. Not sure where all the others came from suddenly? He also suggested in the future we call ahead when bringing a large group. I can see how that would help a day or even a few hours in advance, but that just isn't practical when participating in a youth sporting tournament. This manager and the rude server didn't seem to appreciate the fact that we just provided a much better revenue day and generous tips. Will avoid going there in the future. The only reason I gave three stars was for Vickie and other helpful employees. Food was typical for chain restaurant."
Kim W.,"Flagler Beach, FL",0,32,,3.0,12/14/2012,"Good attentive service, fair food. Steak fajitas were good but not much steak. Margarita Chicken was way spicy and that sort of pressed chicken. Decent but not great."
KB B.,"Bartow, FL",0,11,,1.0,4/6/2012,"Of the Chilis in the Lakeland aea (98North, Winter Haven and this one), this one was really off.  Service terrible - makes you wonder why the workers are there.  Food wasn't up to Chili's standards.  Not going back to that one even tho' it's the closest to Polk City."
