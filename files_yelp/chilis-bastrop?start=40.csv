Cathy N.,"Bastrop, TX",0,22,,4.0,9/3/2014,I've always had good experiences with this Chili's. The waitstaff is quick and friendly. The food is good. I usually get the honey chipotle chicken crispers. The margaritas are about medium strength which I like.
Melissa M.,"Bastrop, TX",14,34,10,3.0,3/4/2012,For a chilis this was great! the bartender and waitress were super friendly and all our appetizers were really yummy. We had 2 for 20 and it was great. We had a fun date and I was not dissapointed!
Barry M.,"Willis, TX",80,77,44,3.0,1/15/2012,"I decided to go to lunch with my XBox-addict sin, and he wanted Chili's. Rather than drive him all the way to Austin, i decided to give this one another chance. There must be new management, because the service and food was as I expect Chili's to be. The downside was too many screaming, running, snot-nosed brats and a men's restroom that looked like something out of a NYC tenement. But at least the truly important items have improved, so I might even give them another chance..."
Deborah M.,"Austin, TX",8,15,,1.0,4/9/2011,Today my youngest daughter took her daughter and 3 other friends to Chili's for lunch.  It started with a narly hair in her plate! The waitress saw it and took the plate back.  Then one of the others @ the table pulled a really long hair out of the bite in her mouth! One other person @ the table got so nauseated he hit the bathroom.  Thirty minutes later my daughter had vomiting and diarrhea! Everyone else was very nauseous except for the guy who got sick before they left! There are too many other good places to eat in Bastrop!  Don't go here!
Angel R.,"Round Rock, TX",1,38,3,5.0,8/29/2012,"We go a few times a week and have always had a great experience! I love the lunch salad, and in the evening the drinks are great. The service has always been so wonderful. All of the servers are very polite and helpful.  The  main reason we choose to go there is because we know we will have good service which is hard to find in a smaller town."
Suzanne R.,"Weimar, TX",0,25,,3.0,9/2/2011,"Chili's is Chili's.  Come on, you know what you're getting.  Good points?  Bartender at lunch is always spot on.  Other workers iffy.  Never in my life have I been to a bar where my beer was brought to the table and I had to open it myself. I think they were new.  Regardless, my sandwich rocked.  Soup was blah.  And thanks for bringing fried cheese back!!"
Dan A.,"Elgin, TX",0,68,,2.0,4/10/2010,"I have a panic attack everytime I eat here.  Not that I am claustrophobic, but this place is just too small.  The food is, well, TGICHILIRIFFIC.  I mean, it's consistently average, at best.  The microwavers seem to be on their game. The wait staff is fairly well programmed.  I think I have the routine memorized.  I wish the Chilifolk had opened a bigger franchise.  Next time we'll keep driving and stop at Wendy's."
robin k.,"Cedar Creek, TX",5,16,1,4.0,10/26/2010,I love the El Nino margarita and the boneless buffalo wings.  This is a small Chili's and the wait can sometimes be too long.
Barbara Enlow K.,"Bastrop, TX",0,4,,4.0,7/30/2010,"Chili's Bastrop is now all no-smoking, so that's no longer a problem.  I have never had a problem with long waits, and the staff is always friendly.  I prefer non fried healthy food and Chili's has an excellent and varied Guiltless Gourmet menu.  They're new chicken cilantro soup is made fresh every day and probably my favorite offering.  I'm picky about what I eat and modify nearly everything I order, but that's not a problem here.  I live in Bastrop and work for a non-profit.  Whenever we've asked Chili's to donate food for one of our benefits, they've always graciously complied.  A chain restaurant, yes, but a valued member of this community."
John Dale K.,"Lakewood, WA",3,102,,2.0,1/21/2007,"i have been to a lot of chili's restaurants in my life, and some of them really stick out in my mind with the great service that they provide as well as the nice job they do with the food.  it is predictible, which is what i want and need from time to time. but i have run across a location with the most inconsistent service as well as quality of food and drink.   on two consecutive nights, i ordered the same thing (i know, boring--but i was not in the mood the second night to be adventurous), and the first night, everything was perfect.  the cup of red (chili) came out first, and the steak that followed was done to perfection.  i had to order the chocolate lava cake--or whatever they call it, and they did a bang up job on that.   the second night, what happened?????? the red comes with the steak, the steak needs to go back because i'm not ready for it (don't ever deliver chili or soup with an entree), and the steak comes back dry and overcooked.  the cocktail was on the wimpy side, and they couldn't even understand the difference between on the rocks or up. be careful when you go to this location. so far, it's been the only one that i have ever had any problems with."
