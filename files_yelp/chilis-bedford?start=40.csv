Vivian L.,"Miami, FL",0,13,2,5.0,9/30/2015,I prefer this location over the one by glade. I had a bad experience there. But here the food is always up to par and the servers I've had have been very friendly and good at their job. They check on you and let you know what's going on. This last time the food took a bit too long even though the restaurant was pretty empty.. But the server let us know and was attentive.  As long as I live in the area this location will be my go to
Wayne W.,"Euless, TX",141,49,,1.0,1/14/2014,"I have had 4 experiences with this new location and EACH and EVERY one have been bad to horrible.  The food has been sent out cold, my to go order (that I placed online) was wrong and to top it all off, the staff is very lackadaisical and customer skills are lacking a great deal! Why go back you ask?  Answer, I will not go back and I rather choose to drive an extra 5 minutes up to the 121/Glade location.  Senior management might want to step in and do something about this poorly run location..."
Stacy S.,"Dallas, TX",3,33,2,5.0,10/7/2014,"I know it's Chili's, nothing that knocks your socks off.  However, this location was clean and well run.  We had a super cute waitress that provided some delicious recommendations off the new menu."
Charlie D.,"Euless, TX",0,10,,5.0,2/17/2015,This Chili's is located in the old Bennigans building.  They did a great job of rebuilding and remodeling and turned it into one of the very nicest Chili's in the DFW area.  The staff is always friendly and courteous. The service and food are good.
El S.,"Watauga, TX",491,51,37,3.0,2/21/2014,"Pretty standard, slow service on a Friday night.  Beer was cold, food was ok. Skillet queso is a weird color...but tastes good."
Chris J.,"Bedford, TX",4,4,,2.0,8/6/2013,"I've been to this chili's twice now. The first time it had just opened, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt when lunch took an hour and a half, and then my 2 out of the 3 orders at my table were wrong. I just went again, and this time dinner took an hour and a half, my appetizer never showed up, and the service was even worse (if that's even possible) . We sat at the table for 10 minutes with it dirty(because they asked us too) while other tables that sat after us were cleaned. Then I ordered ordered my food, and tables that sat after us got the same appetizer before us(the one that never showed up). The food was OK, standard chili's quality, but not worth the service."
Randi K.,"Keller, TX",62,7,,1.0,3/7/2014,"I came in and sat at the bar.. TONS of dirty drink glasses and plates with napkins I asked the short brown hair bartender if these were done and she said ""yeah no ones there"" and went back to her customers and didn't even acknowledge me (as a single patron at the time) I never got offered a drink, nothing... I asked the man behind the bar for a drink; ""oh I'm not a bartender.. I can't serve drinks"" yet he asked the bartender ""hey she wants a blue moon is it cool if I serve her one?"" The bartender nodded. SOMEONE NOT ALLOWED to serve, served me. Once my friends arrived and drinks started being ordered the bartender was MUCH more attentive. Also? The glasses aren't clean bc the other bartender w/ blond hair made sure to tell the ""bar back"" ... ""Let's make sure these glasses are clean before serving (looking at the dirty glass)."" And she served it to the patron. AFTER THAT? why go back? Do not come here for good service. People were asking the ""bar back"" for help on their checks and to deliver their checks and he can't be he's LEGALLY not allowed-- yet did. This place is unorganized and when speaking to the manager He had nothing to do or say but DEFEND his unlawful employees. I've been in the business... Don't come to this place for good service (unless you want soggy cheese fries)! You'll just get a debate and not an apology on customer service and LAWFUL ETHICS ""being new"" doesn't excuse for ""he just doesn't know what is right and wrong."""
Tom H.,"Euless, TX",1,36,,2.0,7/27/2013,"Absolutely the worst hamburger I have ever had.  Service was crazy bad.  Waiter left and bill and disappeared.  We had to hunt someone down to pay the bill.  The waitress we finally found couldn't accept our payment because the area we were in was not hers.  A few minutes later, the waiter (our waiter) showed up and offered no apology.  This is a new store and has some obvious management problems.  The restaurant that was across the street, before the highway construction, was always pretty good.  What happened ???  I'm thinking the guy was out back smoking dope."
Kate K.,"Euless, TX",9,72,54,5.0,12/24/2013,"Been here three times now and the service is always so wonderful! The flatbread was a little burnt the first time, but not inedible. The cajun pasta was great and cooked perfectly and hot when it came out! The Margarita Chicken was also cooked perfectly and the rice and beans were nice. The flatbread is my absolute favorite, also something to brag about. We had the best waitresses/waiters each time and the host was always attentive. Love this place!"
