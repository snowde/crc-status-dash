Jennifer H.,"Duluth, MN",0,14,,5.0,9/20/2016,"Great place to take our kids for dinner.  Quick, friendly service and good food!  They have $9.99 fajitas on Monday nights and on Tuesday, kids eat free.   The atmosphere is fun on the noisy side."
Travis J.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,5,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Just moved to the area from Arizona. Ordered chilis all the time so was very excited to see one  just 15 minutes from our new house Stopped by after work and ordered to go. 2 for $20 with chicken fajitas and the mango chicken and Texas cheese fries for the appetizer.. I get out to the truck to head home with the meal, and the server runs out saying they gave me a wrong item. No big deal, just switched a couple boxes and I was on my way.  I get home, open up the boxes to start eating and they didn't put tortillas in the bag for the fajitas. So I go back, ask them if they can remake the entire meal since it has now been over 30 minutes since I took the bag out of the store the first time, they said no problem.  Get home the second time and the fajitas were correct, but they didn' put mango on the mango chicken.. asked for no pico and no avocado, and they just took everything off instead so basically just had a piece of grilled chicken. Was not going to go back a third time, and will not be returning in the future."
Calista P.,"Minneapolis, MN",6,11,2,1.0,7/29/2017,The chicken fingers tasted like wet paper towels. They were soggy and we ended up sending the entire meal back. We left and went to another restaurant to eat dinner. The fried pickles were also disgusting. I am actually quite shocked this place is still in business.
Sue T.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,10,,1.0,6/3/2017,Terrible service for a sloe Friday afternoon. SW egg rolls are now just beans.  Service was horrid.  Will never go back.
Jill C.,"Champlin, MN",51,15,28,3.0,4/27/2016,Got chilis to go  The burgers are amazing love the bun and pickles are so good.. They forgot one of the kids meals Thankfully I checked the bag but it took about an additional 10 mins which I could have been home eating by than... Ordered chips and queso the queso came In a TINY container and was only halfway full  Feel kind of jipped honestly 8$ for hardly any queso :-/ :-/
Michael F.,"Minneapolis, MN",18,7,,1.0,7/29/2017,"This has got to be one of the worst restaurants I have ever dined in. I am in complete shock that it is still in business, mind blowing."
Jon K.,"Andover, MN",0,3,12,5.0,2/14/2016,Great place. Amazing food. The only thing I regret is not having a bigger stomach. I've been itching all week to get here. (This is here because the review needs to be longer) ....................
Mary N.,"Minneapolis, MN",22,96,124,2.0,9/25/2015,"Let me just start of by mentioning how miserable all of the workers here look. They look like zombie workers. They have no enthusiasm in their speech and no facial expressions on their face.   We came in a little after the lunch rush, there was only 3 other tables.  I couldn't find anything I wanted to eat on the menu, so I ordered the chicken crispers.  They come in original,  crispy, and honey Chipotle. I selected the crispy option but when my food came out,  only the ends were crispy, if that.  My fries were not crispy or crunchy.  We ordered the tostadas and guacamole.  Tostadas were very thin and broke easily while the guacamole lacked lime flavor.  We ordered their new Oreo molten cake,  which was not all that it was hyped out to be.  It was more like a molten cake that was half vanilla cake, half chocolate, filled with chocolate fudge,  topped with vanilla ice cream, with oreos sprinkled on top. Besides the oreos sprinkled on,  the was no oreos in it,  nor did any of it taste like oreos.  Our server then proceeded to inform us to pay through the electronical screen l tablet on our table? Why would we have/want to pay through that if we've been ordering through her the whole time??? Over all,  I was very disappointed in the whole experience. I won't be back."
Sue M.,"Wyoming, MN",0,2,,1.0,7/10/2016,"The last two visits were very disappointing. Today I had the little sliders, they were missing the ranch. I have not been served the same dish the same way, always something missing. The worst part.... The waitress had at least 2 bottles of perfume on. Thank you for the headache. There are many of us that are allergic, just take a shower or quit smoking. No third chance for this place."
Jake B.,"Fridley, MN",0,1,,2.0,9/28/2016,"Poor food quality.  Guacamole was bland. Chili's is cutting more corners. Fajitas with 3 little pieces of peppers, no lettuce, tortilla warmer is gone. Won't see me any more. W"
Dustin D.,"Blaine, MN",94,87,131,2.0,1/25/2015,"Mediocre at best, may want to consider elsewhere. Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, place was pretty busy but not crazy. Server was slow, long time between visits, empty cups left at table & ran out of chips. When food finally did come, empty glasses were still not taken away or even offered to take away. The burger wasn't bad, just average and the fries were warm (not hot) & soggy. Garbage was full in the bathroom and both paper towel dispensers didn't work or were out of paper towels so I had to dry my hands with napkins after using the restroom. Improvement needed all around."
Lisa B.,"Champlin, MN",1,39,1,5.0,11/8/2015,"For a casual dining experience, this place has it nailed.  My family walked in on a Saturday evening....the parking lot was jammed.  The entryway was jammed.  People everywhere.  Staff checked us in and gave us a 10-15 min. wait.  Ok..... They were spot on.  How do they do it?  The wait staff works in teams and they are FABULOUS.  Once we were seated, we had two people checking on us.  Someone different running food.  Someone different bussing tables.   Never heard of wait staff working in ""teams"" but this place does and it made the entire experience outstanding.  Did I mention that the food is terrific??!   Well done, Blaine Chili's.  We'll be back!!"
Linda M.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,52,70,4.0,7/15/2016,"We are loving the 3 for $10! Salad [or chips and salsa] , choice of 3 different burgers and desert.  Noisy fam of 6 with two kid melt downs. Can't do much about that. Parking lot full but got right in on a Friday night."
Nancy W.,"Minneapolis, MN",63,6,,3.0,2/17/2016,"Two for one drinks are awesome. Service truly leaves something to be desired. Sat at bar in the middle of the afternoon with no one else around. Took 10 minutes to be acknowledged. After eating, bartender ignored me, but another customer who's experienced bad service asked for manager. The manager was awesome and paid much more attention to everyone than bartender. Updated-had a much better experience today! The twofers are great and service was awesome."
Kyle O.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,20,1,2.0,7/16/2016,Don't know what happen to this place bad service wrong drinks no silverware must need new Manger
Stephanie S.,"Minneapolis, MN",139,12,1,5.0,4/3/2016,Love their chips and salsa! The margaritas are pretty bomb too! Definitely a place we will visit often!
Jesse H.,"Minneapolis, MN",177,2,,1.0,3/7/2016,"I went into this location with my girlfriend and it was not extremely busy, and we were attended to in a timely manner. But after we ordered our food, first off the chips with salsa was stale, then it took an hour for us to get our food. My food came cold to the point of almost being raw, my girlfriends chicken was dry and the broccoli was over cooked. We then asked for a new one for just me and it took another 40 min for them to get worm and Cooked food for me. After that they didn't really do much more to make up for it , not discount nothing... very unhappy with our service. We normally do not complain but that was terrible."
Lauren N.,"Saint Paul, MN",16,85,265,2.0,8/2/2014,"I have been here a few times and of those times the hostess is no where to be seen. The latest and most recent time I was there, 8/1/2014; the hostess was not there. She only showed up only 15 after we self seated. In addition, there was no one to even greet nor help us find a table. Not to mention, this was 9:00 p.m. and they were not EXTREMELY BUSY, that no staff members could help us. The food was alright; it took about 10 minutes to even get two waters to our table. Nevertheless, I would rather go to the Chili's in Roseville where there is someone to seat and greet you, instead of this mess. P.s. the tables have a sticky residue on the wooden border."
Christine A.,"Nokomis, FL",0,18,10,5.0,7/21/2015,Our waitress Jess was awesome. Food was good and service was fast.  Will come back to this location again.
Tucker L.,"Burnsville, MN",75,4,1,3.0,11/11/2015,"At first a waitress named brianna on veterans day almost ruined our experience here. The girl I was with is in active duty and we asked for a veterans menu. Brianna very rudly replied ""really""? Then the girl I was with pulled her ID out to prove it. Now I would understand if she just said ""can I see your id"" or something not as rude but just saying really is like assuming that she was commiting a crime by faking to be in active duty. But then we sat down while it was busy and had our table  waited on by a man named jeremiah. He was very polite and very quick to get our order. Also he got us our food amazingly quick. It was very busy inside so how quickly we got our food was very impressive. Inside was also very clean. Definitely three stars."
David S.,"Andover, MN",0,47,,2.0,10/5/2015,"Chili's has really good food but the service is horrible.  This used to be one of our favorite places to eat, but the service has gotten progressively worse the last 4 times we were there and the food quality has declined."
Casey S.,"Minneapolis, MN",35,16,5,4.0,1/12/2014,"My husband and I went around 4pm and it was pretty busy. We still got a good table though. Our waitress was on the ball and we had 2 for 1 bloody marys. No pickle but the mix was good and the celery was crunchy. I always think that says a lot about the restaurant. The appetizers were great and so was our food. We had ordered a different cheese on both of our sandwiches which they mixed up, but the food was still really good. We'll be back."
Kari E.,"Blaine, MN",48,292,57,4.0,11/7/2010,Always a good meal at a good price. Excellent burgers for a chain. I also love the chips and queso dip - the chips are so light and crispy!  2-4-1s in the bar all the time and carside to go.
Tara B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,1.0,12/6/2015,"First off, was told there was a wait even though we could see 8 empty tables. Finally got seated after 20 minutes. Ordered the spinach queso and cheddar bites for appetizers and they brought out chips and salsa right away, but they were so salty neither of us could eat them. 10 minutes later our appetizers arrived, but again both were so salty it wasn't edible. Steak was gristly, ribs were tough and fatty, and even the broccoli was salted.  Flatbread was only cheese, and a lot of salt on top. Tab was 70.83. I left hungry and disappointed. How much does salt cost?"
Phil A.,"Minneapolis, MN",11,221,12,1.0,2/24/2014,"Gosh I feel so horrible, but, the Chili's foray into enchiladas was horrible.  Over lunch I got rice microwaved so hot I burned my tongue, the enchiladas seemed to have chopped pre-processed chicken, the plate was full of water (yes, the plate was full of water.)  The queso chip appetizer was full of the non-stick spray that tasted horrible.  I thought it was a layer of water.  The bartender was gone he was spread so thin.  I've loved Chili's for 20 years, and this one, they have delivered 3 of 4 bad visits in my decreasing visits.  I hope they recover."
Kohleen S.,"Minneapolis, MN",303,294,300,5.0,1/28/2011,"I've eaten here quite a bit for lunch with co-workers or friends, and the service has always been great.  They have a great lunch special similar to Olive Garden's soup, salad and breadsticks deal...only it's unlimited soup, salad and chips & salsa! They have some really great soups, and quite an extensive list to choose from.  I love the chips (always warm and super thin) and salsa (a finely chopped puree of spicy goodness). They'll often give you full order to take home too! Another favorite of mine are the fajitas. If you visit on a Monday, you can get the ""fajitas for two"" for $12 and it's usually enough to feed 3 people! They also have 2-4-1 drink specials all day, every day (not that I'm boozin it up over lunch or anything, but if I were to, it wouldn't cost me much). The staff is friendly, and the service is fast. Sometimes I have business meetings here, and they're never grumpy about us taking up a booth for a long period of time. They'll continue to stop by and provide us with the same great service regardless of how much we spend.  Oh, and if you save room for dessert, I recommend the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie--it's so good, but I recommend splitting it with someone!"
Brian C.,"Blaine, MN",1,17,,3.0,9/24/2013,Not great. Just average food. Average service. Boneless wings were good 2 for 1 margaritas on tues is ok deal but they get you on the up charge for the better spirits. Also kids eat free tues with adults so well worth a family visit or worth going for their specials.
Alexander P.,"Culver City, CA",0,22,,5.0,8/26/2013,"I am so impressed with this chilis, because I am a vegan, and there is nothing explicitly vegan on their menu. The manager came over to my table when the waitress told him I was vegan, and helped me put together a custom order of a flatbread pizza with veggies and avocado. The manager was very helpful and accomodating, and the food was delicious!"
Travis V.,"Minneapolis, MN",87,51,,4.0,1/21/2013,"This Chili's location has quickly become a family favorite for us. Our kids always have a good time and always like the food. They have corn dogs, french fries, corn on the cob, root beer served in glass bottles, and game apps - what kid wouldn't love a place like this! The service has always been awesome with friendly wait staff and quick service. And if you go during happy hour, mom and dad get happy hour specials. The food has always been great too."
