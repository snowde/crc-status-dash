Preferred C.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,41,,5.0,9/11/2011,"Four visits in the last 2 months, and  we have had great food and service every time.  Yay Chili's in Bloomingdale, IL."
michael l.,"West Chicago, IL",1,15,,4.0,7/27/2011,"Chilis has gotten better over the last few years. More better options. A larger variety of  selections. I like that new touchable devie system they bring to your table. It has games, movie times at close theaters, movie trailers, and dessert options that yo can order off of the device without having to wait for a waiter/waitress. Good american comfort cooking at a respectable price. I'd recommend this place for big families."
