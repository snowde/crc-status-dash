Rishabh K.,"Bowie, MD",1,19,22,3.0,9/28/2017,Head out for lunch on Friday and ordered Cajun Chicken pasta which is the popular one here. It was more of a ordinary pasta as opposed to the pasta's I have had at other places. The chicken was grilled and it had powdered spices on the top which dint went well with the whole dish. Not the best pick for me and would try other options next time. Food - 6/10 Service - 7/10  Ambiance - 7/10
April S.,"Washington, DC",961,151,805,5.0,5/17/2017,"I had a great experience at this particular location.  I would at lunch time and it was not very busy, which was good for me. I ordered the Caribbean Salad with Grilled Chicken.  It was delicious.  The chicken was juicy and warm, which greatly complimented the cold mandarin oranges, pineapples and lettuce.  There were just enough dried cranberries to add sweetness.  And just the right amount of salad dressing was added to add flavor to (and not subtract flavor from) the salad. My server was Brandon and he was very attentive.  My beverage stayed topped off, which is very important to me. Based on my experience today, I highly recommend this location."
Joia B.,"Hyattsville, MD",154,9,1,3.0,12/11/2017,This place is pretty lackluster. The best thing being the bottomless chips & salsa. The other items are bland. The rice over cooked. The guacamole needed some spice.
Mary M.,"Rockville, MD",26,6,9,4.0,6/30/2017,"Everyone in our family love this restaurants. There was one close to us in Rockville, but they close it few months a go and now we drive 30 minutes just to get to this restaurant. POSITIVE: Friendly servers, great looking food,  NEGATIVE: Late response to customer, some time confused serves, and the salad wasn't very fresh."
Cameron B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",328,73,51,3.0,1/20/2017,"Over the last couple of years or so, I've stopped by Chili's a handful of times for their happy hour specials.  They have a week night happy hour from 4 - 8. The restaurant area is kept separate from the bar area -- I choose to go to the bar 1) to get the HH deals and 2) so that I don't have to wait for a table.  Be careful when choosing seating at the bar -- If you sit in the wrong section you'll feel a draft from either the front or back door.  I'd recommend you sit towards the middle of the bar to avoid the draft. The service is always friendly and pretty quick.  I've noticed that service at the bar is quite a bit faster than the service at the tall bar tables. The happy hour specials are fantastic!  Half off most appetizers except for the larger combo platters.  There are $4 wine specials, $3 beers, and $3 rail specials.  Can you really beat these prices?  These aren't the strongest drinks I've ever had at a happy hour -- for $3, just get a few rounds and you'll be a-okay. The food is just alright -- good, but nothing to write home about.  There are a lot of diverse options on both the entree menu and the list of appetizers.  I usually go with an order of the wings and the texas cheese fries. I'll keep coming back because I can get a few drinks and a couple of appetizers for around $20 + tip.  Pretty good HH find if you're not trying to break the bank."
Courtney S.,"Davidsonville, MD",41,41,49,3.0,6/5/2016,"Went here tonight for dinner and had an okay experience. This location definitely isn't as great as the one that used to be in Annapolis, but since it shut down this one is the only option.  The food was alright. We started with the chips and salsa which is always my go to! Love the fresh salsa so much and I always get an order to go. I also got the half rack of baby back ribs, and although the meat was sparse, the flavor was really good. Fries seemed a bit over cooked and greasy but were seasoned well. My mom really liked the ranch dressing that came with her salad. Make sure to end the night with the molten cake, which is by far my favorite chain restaurant dessert out there. The service was pretty slow, and our waiter overcharged our check initially. Had we not looked at the receipt, we would have been charged $12.00 for two iced teas. Not cool."
Scott O.,"Crofton, MD",69,49,52,1.0,4/15/2017,"Wow, quality has been sliding down the tubes here.  Service is friendly, but hurried and seemed stretched thin.  The food was pretty poor. My fajitas showed up late and cold and in a pool of Greece. Sides were very small.  My sister-in-law had an Asian chicken salad that was tasteless. My mother-in-law had a half rack of ribs that was salty but overcooked and not flavorful. All in all, we will not be back.  There are plenty of other places that do a lot better for the premium prices they're charging."
Jessica G.,"Clinton, MD",2,10,,2.0,8/30/2017,"The only thing that was good was the food and drinks. Service was slow and it wasn't busy.  My waitress had tables all around so it took her a while to come to me several times. I tried to pay for my check, but the amount was wrong on the little table machines. So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. Nothing. I had to get another waitress to actually come and get my check straight. Then my actual waitress comes and brings the new check. I look at it and yes she did take a drink off. So I left her the tip that I was going to leave her in the beginning. They just have to do better with service. She never came and asked me how my food was. I asked for two ranches for my food she still bought me a blue cheese. Sometimes you have to write stuff down, you can't depend on your memory when you have several tables...you're not going to remember everything. Do better. I doubt I come back."
Jessica C.,"Annapolis, MD",108,87,36,4.0,1/12/2017,"I miss the fact that the one in Annapolis closed, so I went to the Chilis in Bowie. I was sat right away. I ordered a strawberry lemonade which took about 10 minutes to arrive. I then ordered the triple dipper appetizer with southwest egg rolls, boneless buffalo wings, and little burgers. It came out in a good amount of time and everything was really good. I did receive a refill on my lemonade without having to ask for it. I then had the berry crumble cake with ice cream. It was so good! Overall, I had a really good experience. Sorry no pictures."
LaPreill J.,"Lanham, MD",152,57,17,5.0,12/10/2016,"This is our ""spot"". Hubby and I come here at least once a month. The food is always good. As well as the staff. We normally don't have a long wait for service or food. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good food and a good quick date spot."
Alexander W.,"Bowie, MD",235,169,16,4.0,12/19/2016,"Chili's is Chili's  ... been to one, been to them all. With that said, the Happy Hour is a great deal! At this location the staff are always polite, welcome you, and quick with orders and drinks. Go for the Happy Hour and drink specials. I suggest the Triple appetizer, boneless wings, and the cheese bites - YUM!"
Gina W.,"Laurel, MD",50,1,1,1.0,4/30/2017,"I used to love Chilis and was looking forward to checking them out again since i recently moved near where there still is one.  I call in and ordered their signature dish, the baby back ribs with onion rings.  They said it would be 20 mins.  I got there around 20 mins later and was told my order wasn't ready yet.  A few mins later they bring out my order and I leave.  When i got home and was ready to dig in to my long awaited meal i it appeared the onion rings were overcooked and kinda old.  The ribs seemed like they had been sitting arousal for awaile and they just poured some bbq sauce on them at the last minute.  Makes me wonder why they weren't ready when i got there.  Just like another person said, it appears their quality has gone down in the past few years.  I don't think i will be getting my ribs there anymore and maybe nothing else either."
Jasmine W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",124,52,49,3.0,10/7/2016,"It took a while for my waitress to come to my table. However, when she finally did she was attentive and pleasant.  I usually go for the triple dipper as my meal. Chipotle chicken crispers, big mouth bites and southwestern egg rolls are consistently good. If I have room, I usually finish off with chocolate chip cookie skillet. My favorite desert. I don't expect too much from franchises, however, Chilli's are consistent with level of service and food quality. Good for everyone. Enjoy."
Bryan J.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,1,1.0,2/14/2017,"I've been here twice and have been disappointed both times. The first time, I received half the portion sizes that should have been on the to-go plate (ex., 4 wings on an appetizer tray). However this time solidified that I wouldn't return. On an order of chicken tenders, every single one was RAW. Not cold, actually raw pieces of chicken, as in straight out the package with breading on them. The inside was completely pink with blood on it. I don't know if it was a sick joke or what, but I can't imagine if a child got a hold of one of these. Promptly threw the tray away."
KP P.,"Odenton, MD",0,11,,5.0,3/24/2017,Great food. Great wait staff. Everyone was very professional and polite. Server was Aaron. Great personality. Can't say enough great things about this location.
Dvon P.,"Lorton, VA",41,12,4,5.0,2/5/2017,Amazing service today! Came in with he wife and my 4 sons... it's never easy getting 3 little ones quiet and fed in a restaurant but our server Charles took the extra time to make sure every thing was good! The food was good too by the way! If you can ask to sit in charles section!
Marcus I.,"Suitland, MD",0,44,42,4.0,9/5/2016,Probably the second best chilis I've been to food was great our server Shay was awesome helpful and just all around super cool. I had the cheese fries with bacon and the peach crumble ice cream thing that was also grrerreeeeaaaaattttt!!!
Cali W.,"Arlington, VA",8,96,39,1.0,11/13/2015,"THE WORST SERVICE BY BARTENDER Monet! 11/12/15 Upon arriving never greeted by her when I sat at the bar. Monet had a displeasing look on her face while she was completely ignoring the fact new customers were at the bar area. Which was completely empty by the way. (They were in the closing process like about 1 hour and a half left) WAITED 20 MINUTES to even get service and this was after the fact I had to find the manager Brian to help serve. By the time the manager came up here come Monet with her unprofessional attitude.  Monet was displeased with my requests all night as a customer she walked away rolling her eyes to go get the manager every time I tried to speak to her about the drinks her lack of service - without even waiting to hear or let me finish my sentences to her about what was not appealing or pleasing to me as a customer with my food service.  New Flash !!!The bar area is a first impression and a place for single people like me to go to and sit at.  This by far was the worst I've ever had with chilies. My food came out cold broccoli had black fungus not cooked raw. Onion rings were not fresh cold to the touch the order to the burger I had ordered was completely not even correct due to it missing requested items up front. Monet was not the least bit apologetic about any of this. Instead she cowardly want to get the management to correct her mishaps instead of handling it herself. She clearly does not think like an owner for this restaurant all she was doing seems to be like she's collecting a check.  With that being said my bar experience proceeded to take a turn for the worst.  Monet had a bad attitude and was coming off annoyed. She told me that ""I'm going to have to please be patient and wait because she was busy doing other things of importance to close her shift out."" I felt rushed during my meal and waited between 10 to 25 minutes to even get another second round of drinks. What a shame.  NEVER AGAIN - left at 22:50pm"
Nunya B.,"Washington, DC",2,51,56,5.0,4/7/2017,"I called in a to-go order earlier today and the young woman who took my order was so professional and nice.  Fast forward to picking up my order and same thing, she was really nice.  My order was correct and cooked perfectly.  I didn't get her name (she had pink nails), but she was awesome.  And thanks to the kitchen staff who prepared and packaged my order.  You guys rock!  Will definitely be returning!"
Heavenly S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,4,,2.0,1/27/2017,"This Chili's used to be one of my favorite local restaurants. Lately, the quality of food has declined, along with the service. I think I'll make my recent dining experience here my last."
Misfit P.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",19,10,,2.0,8/17/2016,"Cold dinner! We ordered a sample platter and the egg rolls were raw dough on the inside. The chicken crispers were cut really small and over cooked. The honey wings were good. We waited 20 mins after completing the sampler and asked about our dinner. The waitress said she would check. While waiting we had looked at that kiosk table menu and did not see our dinner listed on the pay check. Only the sampler and two cokes. My friend had noticed that two tables had arrived and left due to no service for them. The waitress finally came back and said something about our dinner had gotten ""mixed up"". We the looked at the kiosk again and now our dinners were showing up on the order. Finally after waiting my Tex mex chicken bowl arrived.....cold! All of it. My friends dinner which was a simple was awful. All food was cold. Now my stomach hurts. Won't go there again"
T W.,"Washington, DC",10,12,7,4.0,2/6/2016,"Went for lunch today with the hub and 2 little ones. Was served by Keri-Ann (sp).  My 2 big guys enjoyed the buffalo wings. Ordered chicken strips and broccoli for baby boy. But after his meal was served, he decided he wanted fries and broccoli, instead. Keri-Ann quickly put the order in for fries. (I tried a piece of the chicken strip. It was pretty darn tasty, I must say.) I ordered prime rib tacos, 7 year-old had burger sliders and hub ordered the fajitas. It was good. Typical chain restaurant food. The mixed berry margarita was VERY syrupy and too sweet. Ugh.  Anywho. The total for the 4 of us was $78. We enjoyed Keri-Ann, who was very personable. Even after a party of 18 came in, that she had to serve, she did her best to make sure we were cool."
Daniel H.,"Crofton, MD",0,8,,1.0,2/25/2017,"Sat there waiting 40 minutes for a to-go order. When we got our food each entree was screwed up - one was completely the wrong thing, the other had bacon when specifically asked to have it without. Didn't feel like waiting for them to fix things so we left with the food we didn't actually order, which turned out to be lukewarm despite the long wait. The only seasoning on anything was some kind of glaze that apparently dripped into my fries from someone elses' entree. No apology and no sign of management throughout. Avoid this location."
Chana D.,"Miami, FL",4,4,,5.0,1/14/2016,It's my daughter's fav spot and the best waiter ever is CHARLES I say come for him and the chocolate molten cake  Hmmm Yummy!!!
Jesse C.,"Oxon Hill, MD",153,4,1,3.0,2/1/2016,My bartender Angie was amazing!!!! She recommended that I  got the Yellow Tail wine with my Carnitas Tacos. I would come chat and sip my Yellow Tail with her anytime. The food was great other than my bowl of bland cold chilli .  yuck
Ireyna P.,"Glen Burnie, MD",221,21,5,2.0,5/30/2015,I definitely wouldn't suggest going here for lunch.  It takes way too long to get your food. This happened to me twice with 2 different groups. Step it up. The food was ok.
D W.,"Bowie, MD",3,36,27,3.0,1/30/2016,We always enjoy the food especially the chicken nachos but the service is bad.  On two separate occasions we actually left after being seated because a server never came to help us.  Other times the food has taken way too long to arrive.  They really need to improve in this area before I return again.
Darrell K.,"Seal Beach, CA",507,1662,2605,3.0,10/11/2013,"Hamburgers were good.  Service was friendly and fast.  Cool electronic tablet to order drinks, appetizers or pay on each table."
Eric W.,"Annandale, VA",7,20,,1.0,6/16/2016,"I tried this place months ago but wasn't crazy about it. Today, there was no one at the door to greet people and it was the start of the dinner rush. I never got a chance to eat because the bartender had such a bad attitude I had to leave. I sat at the bar where only 4 people were sitting (Not busy yet). She ignored me and walked to the back cooking area. She finally comes out and I order a beer. I told her I was ordering food but make it to go. She told me to go to another place in the restaurant to place my order. I asked her why she can't just take my order while I'm at the bar and put it ""to go"". She immediately gets a major attitude, raises her voice and says ""You can do it your way"" 3 times. She began pouring my beer but then walked back to talk to the cooking staff. She comes back and says, ""your beer is coming"" and goes to chat with someone else (ignoring me). I got up and walked out. I'll never go back."
Ruby G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,18,1,1.0,8/22/2014,"1 star is because I like the staff but the food is gross. I ordered something off their light menu and my plate came with leftover food and greasy fingerprints on my plate.  My chicken was NOT grilled but fried. The salsa on it was not fresh and I'm sure one of the ingredients were old... I just stuck to the vegetables instead.  Like other reviewers,  there was no one at the door when we arrived and it took quite a while to be seated. I frequently visit other locations and decided to give this one a try but will not be coming back."
Yaminah M.,"District Heights, MD",84,1,,2.0,1/18/2016,"I went to chili's in Bowie last night to spend time with my girls outside of home and I had a gift card to use.  When I arrived, the hostess was not friendly and wasn't even at the front door.  We sat down at a booth and she gave us menus.  She turned the monitor around but didn't show us how to work the monitor (the new feature where you can order food, play games and pay for food after your meal.). While trying to use the monitor, I later discovered it wasn't working for me to order.  I noticed 15 minutes later, while talking to my girls and trying to understand the monitor, that no one had greeted us or even asked if we wanted something to drink. Finally, a young guy walks up and introduces himself and takes our drink order.  Ten minutes have passed and we still haven't received ANYTHING.  Finally , another guy named Charles came by and said he was covering for my server because he had other tables to cover.  He only covered one table and that family came in after me and he only served that table. I found that to be weird that he left our table to deal wothnsomeone else and give them the utmost respect and service. Charles took our drink orders AGAIN and proceeded to take our order for appetizers.  I didn't want to wait along time for anything else so I decided to order everything so we didn't have to keep ordering and waiting. I ordered the salmon, ribs with mashed potatoes and southwestern Mac n cheese for dinner and my girls ordered chicken crispers and fries.   My ribs were tough and the southwestern Mac n cheese was horrible.  The mango lemonade was too.sweet.  I eventually had a bad headache after my meal.   Despite all of this, charles was attentive, courteous and overall nice.  I didn't want to get angry with him because of the other two people who weren't good at all.  There was another server there who had her hair up in a ponytail and she knocked out her tables with problem as well.  I didn't catch her name but I just wanted to put my review out.  That location has to do better. Its no way that a busy restaurant like that wasn't properly staffed."
Naved R.,"Kirkland, WA",38,21,1,1.0,2/7/2016,"We ordered chicken quesedilla and chicken chipotle flatbread. The quesedilla was dry, bland. Had no taste at all. I have been to other chilis. But this is by far the worst one I have ever been."
Mary A.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,84,,4.0,7/2/2016,"Stopped in for lunch with our two month old twins, they were very accommodating gave us a large table where we could place the twins in their car seats. The car seats could not fit in a booth seat.  Brendan our waiter was great he served us quickly and was very pleasant. We both had the quesadilla off the lunch menu mine with soup the other with salad.  Both were delicious.  The southerner at the table declared the sweet tea to be the best. She'd ever had"
Angela C.,"Huntingtown, MD",3,19,4,5.0,11/27/2015,Chili's always delivers a great lunch. Drinks are delicious and sandwiches can't be beat! The prices are quite reasonable. The chips n salsa my favorite appetizer. Our bartender was on the ball and very friendly. Look forward to eating here again. I just wish we would get one closer to home.
Kourtney E.,"Washington, DC",2,48,7,5.0,9/19/2015,"Came here with fam and friends two days in a row due to being in the area both days. We had excellent service, food and drinks! Wes and Kevin were amazing servers. The manager was very attentive and came around and asked if we had been served well/had any issues. Overall, an amazing evening at Chilis. If you're in the area and would like good drinks, food and customer service...I'd say stop by here"
Xio R.,"Washington, DC",0,2,3,5.0,10/18/2014,Service was great food great and the dessert was just the best and bug enough for four to share
Brook H.,"Columbia, MD",58,287,220,4.0,1/10/2013,"I have to warn you that my experience was possibly influenced by the fact that my Brother-in-Law is a manager at the central training Chili's for the region. Therefore, upon his announced arrival, we were treated to an excellent experience. I cannot guarantee that your experience will be the same, barring having a relative that is ~also~ a manager at a central training restaurant for your region. The food here was quite good, especially the Southwestern Eggrolls. I could eat those all day and night, even with the consequences of devouring so much fried food. I decided to order the Monterey Chicken and wasn't disappointed. There wasn't a single complaint from our entire party of 10 (+2 toddlers) about anything we received. I think one of the cool things about Chili's are the electronic touchscreen devices at each table. You can put on clips of shows (good for the kids), play various games (some free, some cost a dollar), or even order drinks from the bar (warn your server, though). So, based on my experience, I enjoyed this Chili's a lot. However, as I said, I did have someone with me that may have influenced everything."
Dave S.,"Annapolis, MD",75,267,22,2.0,3/27/2014,"Sad. Yes it's a chain. Yes you can't expect too much. Still, this particular one was really bad. Slow service, not very clean, food over-cooked. Glad I was just traveling through and won't be back."
Sean C.,"Washington, DC",0,95,,3.0,11/25/2014,"I've been going with my family off and on for about 10 years. I can relate to the negative reviews here but those are not our typical experiences. If you're doing some shopping in the area it's an OK place to stop by for lunch -- it is not a destination. We have found the food consistently good and servers pleasant.  As mentioned in another review, there is the odd phenomenon of showing up after 1 pm on a Saturday and Sunday and having trouble getting seated, even though half the tables are empty. Sometimes during those times, someone who is clearly the manager, and also apparently his wife, are waiting tables. This points to a staffing problem, maybe not hiring as many servers as they need.  We were recently seated at a table in the bar area for the first time, and apparently served by someone not a regular server (not the bartender -- maybe a kitchen worker). It was OK, except for a blond woman -- a BIG Maryland football fan -- sitting at the bar swearing up a storm. We were sitting with kids and a little embarrassed.  I'd say most of our experiences are OK, enough that we go back, but operations could defiantly be tightened up."
Nikki H.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,40,16,2.0,3/29/2015,Hostesses are.clearly the most unhappy people on the planet. They couldn't possibly know what a smile is or even a cordial greeting.  Our server was decent however watching the grumpy hostesses seat people became unbearable.  The food we ordered came out wrong but that was remedied quickly. The food was good. But geez the hosts were pitifully sad looking.
