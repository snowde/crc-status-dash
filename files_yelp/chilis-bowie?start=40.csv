Chonita L.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,7,1,5.0,8/23/2015,Enjoy the food and it's great place to take the family. The biggest hit is the pan hot cookie!
Tiegan Y.,"Washington, DC",122,62,3,1.0,2/4/2015,"I was here Monday February 3, 2015 to pick up a to go order. When I walked in all the staff were gathered whom I'm assuming was a manager and NO ONE bothered to ask if I needed any assistance.  One lady in particular who looked directly at me and then turned her back away from me. The lady who worked the bar had food in her hand heading to another table sat the plate down just to assist me when she saw what the other waiter did. I'm refuse to tolerate poor customer service nor am I going to support it . Won't be back especially after speaking with the manager who appeared aloof and disconnected showed no concerns at all about my concerns."
Vikas L.,"Washington, DC",1,4,,1.0,9/28/2014,Very slow service. Appetizers took 31 minutes and then lunch came faster. Quality was not a wow factor. Overall not a good experience. Save your time and money go elsewhere
Tiffany S.,"Silver Spring, MD",43,9,1,2.0,3/2/2014,"I have never written a review before, but after visiting this Chili's I just had to write a review and WARN future guests. This Chili's management is very, very poor. Here is my story. It was a Saturday at around 1 pm when I entered. Nobody was at the front to greet me, and after waiting 10 minutes I went to ask the nearest waitress if we were going to be seated. The restaurant was not packed, in fact there might have been ten groups of people only.  After about 5 more minutes of waiting (now we are at 15 min of waiting before being seated in an empty restaurant) the manager finally seats us. He doesn't tell us who our server was. There are no utensils or plates on the table. 10 min later our server approached us. He was cheery, and overall a great server, which is why I blame the management. We ordered drinks and our entrees. Drink service was slow (but the drink was good) and our food even slower. While I was waiting, I noticed that people were gathered at the front door waiting to be greeted. At one point it looked like there were about ( sets of people, and nobody was there to greet and seat them. It was just shocking to me. The manager came back to our table and told me that he apologizes for my food taking a while but When the food came out, it was not up to their standards . I had ordered boneless buffalo wings. Having just gotten over a bout of food poisoning a week ago I was scared. The food finally came and was good and I did not get sick.  Bottom line, is that the service is EXTREMELY slow, and to me, the good and drink are not worth the terrible service."
Sonny R.,"Riverdale, MD",15,6,,1.0,12/9/2014,"this location of chilis in bowie, md is horrible. the service and attitude of the employees was atrocious. I had to stand there 20 minutes before anyone came to see if I had been helped. They were to busy on their cell phones. I used just the to go part of the restaurant. If this is how it is in to-go then I know I definitely do not want to dine in and eat. I would not recommend this location to anyone to enjoy. The food was up to par although the lack of service and ambition by the staff and managers sullies the whole experience"
Laila M.,"Goddard, MD",0,2,,1.0,3/16/2015,"I should have left when I stepped foot in the joint, but I allowed myself to get too hungry and I was dying for a burger. I would normally go to the Chilis in Rockville and have always received great food and service.  But as for THIS location in BOWIE... :-( 1. The restaurant is filthy. I have no idea if they just do not have any one to sweep that dirty floor or what, but they have absolutely no problem seating you at a table with piles of trash under it.  2. I should have mentioned that you WILL walk in to an empty hostess station. There will be no one there to seat you and you will be just standing there looking hungry and confused. The more desperate you look, the better. Someone will eventually realize that you actually are standing there because you would like to be seated.  3. Food- Pray over it!  Twice. Once I made it to a table and summoned a server, I knew right then that I had no business even ordering my food because God just sent me several signs that I shouldn't be eating at this establishment! Sigh ...  Anyway, I order a Smokehouse Burger and a side salad. When I saw a server bringing  my salad to the table, I started praying right away that it would be ok. I was HUNGRY!  What do I see when I look down? A friggin hair right on the plate! Damn damn damn! So I let the server know that I think it was time for me to leave and she said she completely understood. She went to get the mgr who apologized and said that my burger was ready. He asked very nicely for me to please stay and enjoy my burger as he was going to take ""care"" of the meal. I told him my concerns with the untidiness of the place and my questions regarding the cleanliness of the food prep area. He assured me my burger would be ok.   So I reluctantly said ok after doing an extensive examination of the plate. The burger was fine but the potato bun was not soft at all. I had to saw it with my knife. Potato rolls should not be hard.  Bottom line: There is no need to go on.  I will NOT go to this particular Chilis ever again. Do so at your own risk!"
George B.,"Takoma Park, MD",16,3,1,1.0,5/20/2014,"The food is good. The server was pretty friendly but super slow. I walked in and there was no one to greet me. Stood around for a bit then decided to sit in the bar section. Servers looked at me and didn't bother to ask. Finally,  I had to get someone to get me a menu. Worse place ever. I'll never go back."
Jasmin H.,"Hanover, MD",204,133,15,3.0,1/4/2012,"My friend and I went around 4ish on a Tuesday afternoon to grab a quick bite. We were immediately blown when they said they don't do the unlimited salsa and chips combo anymore. Like honestly that was the only reason we had even decided to come (Chili's might b my least fave out of the Fridays/Applebees clan). After we got over that shock we got the 2 for 20. He got some pasta dish and I got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesdilla. I must say I was I was pleasantly surprised. It was really Bad, Michael Jackson Bad! Our waitress was friendly and prompt too. I gotta say this might have been my most pleasant experience at a Chili's yet. Would I say I'm a born again fan? Eh, the jurors are still out on that."
Mary J.,"Washington, DC",0,18,,2.0,4/20/2014,"I have been to Chili's before and this stands out as a particularly bad location. I would not recommend it. First, there was a 20 minute wait  even though there were plenty of open seats. We had the worst seat - on a corner between the kitchen, the register, and the restroom even though there were plenty of open seats away from those areas - lots of foot traffic and noise. We ordered appetizers that were not even lukewarm - they were cold.  The waitress was nice but she was slow. When we got our bill it had a charge for a table game. I complained because there was no clear notice that there were any charges associated with the electronic thing on our table and I would not have let my child touch it if the possibility of charges was clearly  displayed. (I may elevate this complaint to a government agency. They should not have those things on the table unless the potential charges are clearly marked.) The waitress removed the charges for the cold food and the game. She brought out the appetizer again and it was still cold. Overall, there was enough bad here for me to say I would not return. It seems like the location is poorly staffed and managed."
Marjorie M.,"Rockville, MD",196,19,4,1.0,10/13/2013,"As a former employee of the Chilis in Rockville, md I am thoroughly appalled by my recent visit. My boyfriend, his roommate and I came in for dinner and drinks. All of us were just laughing and having a good time. We order our beers which seems to take forever when the bar manager comes over to us to tell us that him and our waitress have noticed that all of us are ""too drunk"" to be served alcohol. Mind you none of us had a sip of alcohol all day. Never coming back here again."
Brenbren H.,"Washington, DC",0,9,2,2.0,9/18/2015,"We once enjoyed  Chilis , but they changed the menu, which really was a very bad idea, foot ball season was once full around the bar and family seating nearly full.  Please change the menu back to potato skins and bone in wings, and dumpling. Who ever decided to have fries pickle chips as appetizer and not a condiment,  not a good idea, the service is very slow as well."
Barry W.,"Hyattsville, MD",5,1,1,2.0,11/19/2013,"Bathroom is way too cold regardless of seasons.  Very uncomfortable.   Bar is also too cool - so cool that you would have to wear jacket.  This is not the case at virtually all other places.  Second to only Ice Bars above Arctic Circle, the bar temp is incredibly low."
Jackie V.,"Bowie, MD",0,11,,4.0,8/16/2014,"The food is good and the beer is cold...when you finally get seated.  I always seem to wait for a long time at the hostess stand for someone to notice me, even when they're not busy. The endless chips/salsa and Big Bite sliders are my favorite (REALLY wish they still had the jalapeño ranch though). But be sure to order everything you want at once cuz you may never see your server again."
Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3758,414,2038,2.0,8/15/2011,"The food is not great but not bad.  I wish their service was better.  Staff can be apathetic for the most part.  They don't appear to have a host/hostess so it's anyone's guess when you'll be seated.  Is it so hard to designate one of the servers to also seat on a rotating basis?   Chicken crispers and sandwiches are pretty good, have flavor.  Tacos and fajitas are in the average to above average range.  Desserts are also good.  Not one of those places you can roll up to at the last minute cuz they WILL make it clear that they're trying to go home.  They also close earlier than a lot of their competition (which in Bowie is pathetic)."
LaToya E.,"Baltimore, MD",451,580,816,2.0,12/16/2011,"I went to this location with a friend for birthday drinks and dinner and the food was meh and the service was worst! I barely so my waitress the entire night and had to flag down random service people to get me napkins and utensils but guess who popped up the moment the check was due. The drinks were the only reason this place got the two stars i gave it, if it wasnt for that one star all the way."
Robert J.,"Hanover, MD",15,24,3,3.0,1/29/2014,Chili's is my all time favorite place to eat. This location IS NOT. It has certainly gone down hill in the past few years. Some of the waiters are really nonchalant about serving and taking orders which leads to loooooooooooong wait times and your order still being wrong. I still go because I love the brand but if you can find another location I would recommend that.
Marcus P.,"Washington D.C., DC",68,126,6,3.0,7/31/2011,"Of all the OMG-we're-having-so-much-fun-let's-high-five-guys type restaurant chains (a la Applebees, Fridays, etc.), Chili's is by far my favorite. However, ironically, this one is never all that much fun. I've never been here when it was packed--probably because I just can't see myself ever going to one of these restaurants on a Fri/Sat night--so maybe that accounts for the ho-hum atmosphere of the place and the less than enthusiastic demeanor of some of the wait staff when I'm here. However, the food is what I love about Chili's, and this one is no exception: the sizzling fajitas passing by always make you wish you had ordered them, the triple dipper appetizers are brilliant, great nachos and the ribs are usually top notch (every once in a while you'll get the anorexic pig who couldn't...but not too often). All for a price that can't be beat for a satisfying lunch or weeknight dinner. But, no, I can't see this place being my Friday night restaurant of choice--a little too family oriented for my taste. While I know kids have to eat too--I guess--I just wish they didn't have to sit (stand, shout, have epilelptic seizures) around me while they do. And it can't be someone's birthday EVERYDAY, can it? And why must I be the one always sitting at the next table? And change the music in this place; there must me something more lively can be played--Leona Lewis? Really? Thank God for the carry-out service!"
Pinki F.,"Bowie, MD",0,27,4,1.0,2/3/2015,"I tried contacting corporate and they never got back to me, it looks like they don't care about their customers."
Scott M.,"Owings, MD",22,55,5,1.0,12/21/2013,"Sllllllooooooowwwwww.  No follow up.  In the words of Charles Barkley ""Just Teurrable"""
Christina M.,"Bowie, MD",0,1,,1.0,5/4/2014,Well I would write a review if the hostess had not informed us of the 30-35 minute wait when the restaurant was empty? Walked away along with everyone else. Might help to seat people if you want to make any money.
