Sophie C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,45,16,3.0,4/18/2014,"Like some have posted, service can be very slow although the staff is generally friendly.  I have visited several times and notice the wait staff also greet and clean tables. The food is inconsistent but usually acceptable.  It also smells a bit like that smell of using a dishrag that needs to be retired on every surface in need of a wipe."
Dominque M.,"Washington, DC",0,9,,3.0,2/20/2012,Bacon Ranch quesadilla was so-so. Drinks were good. Bartender was very attentive. Very crowded on a satuday night but what can I expect? bathroom was GROSS.
Paula P.,"Bowie, MD",24,58,95,3.0,1/15/2012,"It was nice to go here on a Friday night at 6:15pm and not have to wait for a table. Unfortunately the portion sizes have gone down. Granted I haven't been to a Chilis restaurant in probably 7 months and the last one was in Short Pump in Richmond, VA. We ordered the chips and salsa and were surprised you no longer get free refills! We also ordered the southwest egg rolls which are about 1/2 the size they used to be...but still delicious. I ordered the BLT Quesadilla. It was very small but the guacamole was what really made this yummy. Hubby had the sliders- always delicious. The service was good and seamless even during the change in the shift."
Mom To One B.,"Bowie, MD",1,17,,5.0,4/11/2013,"This review is based on my carry-out experiences. We go to chili's about three times a month and get carry out. The servers always make sure everything is In the bag. If you ask for extra of anything, they always put it in the bag. When we get there, the order is always ready. We usually get about three meals and desserts in our order and they always make sure everything is perfect. I appreciate this because there are times when you get carry-out and everything is thrown in your bag, things are forgotten, you have to go back inside to get things and the order isn't ready at the time they give. I appreciate chili's because they treat the carry-out customers the same way as the customers dining in. I never have to worry about going through my bag to make sure everything is in there, and the food is always good. I wish I could say the same thing about Bob Evans."
Rhonda M.,"Destin, FL",263,15,11,4.0,5/16/2010,"The service and food are so great at Chili's that it keeps us coming back time and again! I miss the pairing specials when they aren't running the promotions. The only complaint I have where the overall score is not 5 is sometimes the service is slow - When the place is packed we get great service, but when it is empty the service tend to take their time and are busy with closing duties rather than service."
Kim G.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,2,,5.0,9/7/2010,"We love Mattie and Britany!! They are the most personable and accommodating waitresses. Great attitudes and excellent customer service skills. They're the reason we frequent the Bowie, MD Chili's. The wings are delicious and they know we like our wings cooked crispy. The fajitas are to die for. My dad likes the ribs. Chili's is the place to be for good food and fun! Keep up the good work. See you soon. ..."
