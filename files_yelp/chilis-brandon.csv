Tristian W.,"Brandon, FL",63,18,6,4.0,10/31/2017,My wife and I enjoy lunches. The value is outstanding. We also enjoy taking our children as their kids fair is equally good. When you have an opportunity to visit I would recommend the burgers.  They are more than filling and delicious.
Kevin W.,"Seffner, FL",0,14,3,2.0,10/28/2017,"Even for a Chili's, this one is sad. The chain as a whole stripped all the stuff that we liked most from the menu, but they can't even execute on the stuff that's left. The phenomenal fries, excellent burgers and even something as simple as chicken strips are, at best, meh. Why not one star? The margaritas are still incredible and the the ""nachos"" that are scrumptious (if they get to the table still warm)."
Nadine S.,"Apollo Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",86,344,998,4.0,10/14/2016,Typical chain restaurant but this one is definitely run better than most. The staff are attentive and the manager comes around to make sure everything is okay and you are taken care of well. My friend and I only ordered salads and a glass of wine but all was good with our meal.  I accidentally left my sweater there so called when I got home and they said they had it. I told them I would be by the next day to retrieve it. When I arrived no one could find it but one staff member said she took my call the evening before and remembered it was there. The manager immediately came out to assist and located it in the back office. Grateful for the extra effort and customer service.
Lelia B.,"Dover, FL",16,3,,5.0,9/7/2017,"The restaurant was very crowded, but we got fast service and food very fast. The food quality was great."
Rusty V.,"Valrico, Tampa Bay, FL",40,13,11,1.0,5/14/2017,We had a poor experience at this one as well. If you going to go skip this location. For some reason the customer service and guest experience is poor.
John M.,"Valrico, FL",9,5,,5.0,9/20/2017,Great food and service.  Always courteous staff and fast service when ordering dinner.
Anshul G.,"Brandon, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/20/2017,Vegetarian Beware .. Meat can be in your plate... Chilis was my Favorite Restro until Today.. Me and My Family is Pure Vegetarian. We order some vegetarian dish and specially mentioned that We are Veggie so NO MEAT NO FISH.. Only Veggie.. When we were eating Veggies Quesadilla .. We found Chiken Piece in our Plate ... Its too bad and mood spoiler... Staff told me they make lots of food so some how it came to my plate.. I don't know if they care about food quality or not...  Manager Apologized  for it ... however it was too much for me ... Will never visit again any Chili's.....
Vikki T.,"Brandon, FL",62,5,,1.0,5/25/2017,The service here is beyond below average. The staff is incompetent and the manger is not service oriented. Our drinks weren't made correctly our food came out cold they took the same food to the back microwaved it a bit and brought it back. Over cooked my steak and brought me cold mashed and asparagus with my over cooked steak. The waitress is unwilling to assist at all. And the manager acts as if we have done something wrong by being unsatisfied with the service we've received today.
Rhonda E.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,53,14,4.0,11/17/2016,Had lunch here today. Chris was great! Very attentive and friendly. I had the Caribbean salad and it was very tasty. I did have a hard time figuring out some of the prices on the lunch menu....so I went with something that showed the price.
Keith R.,"Dover, FL",49,72,76,4.0,3/6/2017,I went to Chili's before but it was in Plant City about 3 times and was very disappointed. My friends said try a different one. So I did. I wasn't disappointed the server was awesome she did very well! I had the loaded potato soup and salad. The molten lava chocolate cake I shared everything was very good. I will go back to this one!
Jessica M.,"Orlando, FL",0,33,23,1.0,5/5/2017,"Had a horrible experience here tonight. Firstly, the hostess was incredibly rude. We had a party of 6 adults and they place us at a small table where none of us had any elbow room at all, and asked the hostess to move and she was incredibly rude and made no effort to move or accommodate us whatsoever. So we asked the manager to move to an empty table that was larger and would accommodate us and she refused, saying that table had been ""reserved"" for a ""reservation"" (who makes a reservation at Chilis?!). As it turns out, they broke the large table up into three smaller tables and sat different families there (so she lied to us). I get it- you want to seat more people instead of accommodating us, but why lie? Lastly our waitress was slow as molasses and not overly friendly. Took forever to get our food and even to get simple waters for the table. Pretty bad experience, but then again, I guess I'd be bitter too if I was a minimum wage Chili's employee..."
Zip Z.,"Valrico, FL",0,4,,2.0,5/27/2017,"Absolutely done with Chilis, at least the location by where I live. We went there this evening for dinner against my better judgement. The last several times I have been greatly disappointed. Chilis used to be one of my favorite places, but no more. We had the 2 for $22. The appetizer wasn't bad, chips with salsa and guacamole. Chips were warm and fresh and the guac was good. It went downhill from there. Both of us wanted just water to drink. I asked for lemon in my water, didn't get it. My wife had the grilled chicken salad, and I had the mango-chili tilapia. My entree came with steamed broccoli and rice. The broccoli was almost inedible, I could not cut a couple pieces with my fork. Really bad. The fish was a very small thin piece.  My wife's salad was not much better. The waitress asked how everything was, and I told her I wasn't too happy with the broccoli. The manager came to the table and asked again what the problem was. I showed him the broccoli I couldn't cut and he offered to bring more. I was basically done eating at that point, so I told him no. There was really not much of an apology or offer to make it right. I also have to say the Plenti rewards is a big joke. I checked my account on the internet and it said I had a free desert, but that didn't happen at the restaurant. I am sorry, but there are too many good places to eat in our area (who also give discounts ie Ruby Tuesday) to waste my time anymore at Chilis."
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,3.0,12/7/2014,"Date night with a friend. It was late 11:30 and Appleby's was Swamped, so we opted to come here. When we were waiting to be seated, I saw the host actually check his watch, wait a moment or two before coming to seat us. He made a point to tell us that the place closed in half an hour, and then proceeded to rush us through our order.   The food was Ok. My salad was tasty, but my date's food as ""just Ok"". All in all it wasn't a spectacular event, it was JUST ok."
Tammy F.,"Lutz, FL",0,22,2,1.0,10/2/2016,Did not like my experience I had today . Order the 3 for $9.99 it had to back twice and by the time I got my food my husband was already done with his meal we usedly go to the one on fowler but we were in Brandon so we decided to go to the one here never  will again
Reagan T.,"Brandon, FL",158,60,22,1.0,7/20/2016,"Bad service. Got our order wrong. Had additional items on our receipt and it took forever to get it removed. Absent waitress, and when she did come around we had to ask twice for almost everything. Won't be back."
Julie B.,"Dover, Tampa Bay, FL",20,55,16,1.0,6/16/2016,Chili's use to be my favorite restaurant. Changing their menu was the worst thing they could have done. None of the food appears fresh but seems frozen and pre made. I have a sensitive digestive system and none of the food settles well with me now. I have tried going back 4 or 5 times hoping it would be better. It wasn't. I know refuse to eat there any longer. Too many other good restaurants around. Looking for Chili's to close soon. So sad.
JD P.,"Riverview, FL",16,53,3,2.0,8/8/2016,"This is like the third bad experience we have had in the last six months.We used to go here all the time and loved it! Wow , I think management has lost the goal. I ordered a Bloody Mary, the bartender (male) gave me Bloody Mary mix and ice.(warm glass too) What kind of bartender does that? they have no clue what the picture looks like I guess?? I need celery and olives man and maybe a lime wedge??....read the bar-tending book. Then my wife and I ordered the sampler. the sliders were dry with crumbly buns, they had three little bowls of Ranch dressing even for the combo? There is supposed to be something for the mexi rolls...etc..everything was less than mediocre. the salad my wife ordered was the best thing of the day. (its hard to mess that up)"
Mark C.,"Milford, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/6/2016,"It's a slap in my face to pull up and see someone in a black Avalanche double parked in the ""To Go"" section. I have been to this Chili's many times and their ""To Go ""crew is always on point.  They check my order to ensure it matches what my request and to see some jerk park that way irritates the heck out of me. Why on Earth would you tolerate someone with such disrespect? It's simple-is that your car? Would you mind moving it?"" Now I am questioning your leadership!!! Maybe just a bad night. Grace is needed some times but I am frustrated!!!"
Samantha B.,"Brandon, FL",24,4,2,1.0,5/14/2016,"Just had the most horrible dinner in this establishment. First it took a good 15 minutes to even be seen by the server, we got our appetizers before we got our drinks. One of our meals came out wrong, completely. We sent it back the others in our party were finished before she even got her food back. In this whole time we were not seen by a manager once. Not good service at all. Not friendly at all. Will not be getting my business ever again."
Ken C.,"Dover, FL",10,123,14,2.0,8/5/2014,"The food is actually getting worse! Was great now average. Shrimp are frozen, fajita meat is tough and chew. Now they are slow as well!! Drinks sloppy and weak."
Bryan M.,"Seffner, FL",3,18,4,1.0,1/8/2015,"I called and placed an order for chips salsa and queso and was told that it would be 12 minutes which seemed a bit long for something that they didn't need to cook to order but fine. I arrived at the restaurant about five minutes after I called and proceeded to wait another fifteen minutes, twenty minutes after placing my twelve minute order and no one ever had come outside to take my money or bring my food. When I called to let them know that I was leaving so they could cancel my order the person who takes care of the curbside service had no idea I had been there that long even though I was the only car there. If you offer curbside service the customer shouldn't have to walk in to get there food if they do then you should not offer that service anymore."
Crystal E.,"Brandon, FL",6,17,37,5.0,8/24/2014,I have never had a bad experience at this valrico chili's! Food is always prompt and yummy. Staff is friendly
Timothy C.,"Riverview, FL",8,46,1,3.0,10/31/2014,Tried the new tnt burger ordered medwell come over cooked. The service was good the burger not do much. Overall the experience was fair.
Matthew W.,"Valrico, FL",8,41,33,3.0,2/27/2015,"We were promptly seated even though they were busy the waitress came over took our drink order, brought our drinks back I asked for a kids menu at this time for my daughter, the waitress came back asked us if we were ready we said no that we were waiting on one more person to arrive they arrived shortly after that. The waitress came back took his drink order, still has not brought the kids menu brought back the coke zero that was ordered and then didn't come back for a good 5-7 minutes to take our order.  We place our order, we ordered an appetizer for the table the fried pickles :) but the plates they give you to share the appetizer two of them were dirty one was stained with some kind of sauce and the other hand food particles on it. I got the guacamole burger but with the turkey burger and it was great, everyone enjoyed what they received."
