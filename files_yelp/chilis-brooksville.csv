Missy P.,"Watertown, MA",10,95,19,5.0,12/23/2017,"Clutch your farm-raised, sustainable pearls folks! MY BLACK BEAN BURGER WAS NOT AS HOT AS I'd have liked! So, because I'm insufferable, I sent it back, screaming at the waitress, as she clearly did not regard my need for a formed bean patty with the seriousness this requires.  I'm kidding. Ever have one of those moments that you realize  you've become everyone you hate? I just had one of those moments, thumbing through my own yelp reviews.  I went to Chili's and it was goddamn great. My server, Marcy, was sharp as a tack and funny and charming. The food was perfectly fine and I caught a quick buzz off the happy hour drafts. When I asked for a hotter black bean burger Marcy and the manager were wonderful. They both handled it with grace, they didn't make things awkward and they're both damn good at their jobs.  The restaurant and restrooms were clean and everyone was cheerful. I'd go back and ask to sit in her section in a heartbeat! *it is gonna be 2018 in a few short days and the world feels pretty miserable. I'm goddamn done contributing to that. 2018 is the year of no negative Yelp reviews!  BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE YELP!"
Dr Yolanda C Leon L.,"Tampa, FL",23,128,142,5.0,10/7/2017,"We had a great service from Dani, a fast , friendly, and professional server.   The Caribbean Salad was delicious with lots of Fresh spinach, cranberries, and field greens.  I enjoyed fresh Asparagus blanched with Garlic!!!!!   This was a very nice, clean Chili's with VERY accessible parking. The hostess greeted us warmly and we will return again.  Thanks Dani Leora for great service!!!!!"
Christopher R.,"Spring Hill, FL",4,196,101,3.0,7/19/2017,"To start out, this chilis was going to get a 5 star review.  The ambiance : awesome chilis. Cool decor, one of the nicest, coolest chilis I have ever been in. Super nice.  Food : above average chilis. Food came out hot and was yummy.  Ok, so why not 5 stars? 1st foul : The server came by (dunno if it was for a refill or just to check in) and I could tell they had just taken a smoke break. GROSS 2nd Foul :  Waiting for to ask for a box and the server NEVER returned?!?! Gone!  We sat patiently for a little over 5 minutes and I didn't see her at all.  Sorry, No 5 stars!"
Amy M.,"Sanford, Orlando, FL",0,47,1,4.0,1/6/2018,"I called in my order and asked for no green onions. When I arrived at the location I was promptly greeted. My food was brought out just as I said my name. The guy opened it up and said ""I double checked there's no green onions"". As I was walking towards the door a guy from the kitchen staff came and opened the door for me and said ""thank you for choosing Chili's tonight, drive safe and keep warm!"" Got home the food is delicious and I'm still smiling from the interaction. Was it anything crazy or above and beyond? No. But in a world where customer service seems to be a huge lack it was just really nice to be thanked for choosing them and showing a genuine concern for my safety. Thank you Chili's!"
Mina N.,"Chicago, IL",103,118,354,2.0,12/22/2016,Omg. I so want to love this place but service is lacking  I waited almost ten minutes to be acknowledged.  Then waited to be served.  Then no napkins    Mind you A Sunday night at about 9pm I can count three empty tables  Ran out of napkins.   REALLY !! You are in the food industry.  Very disappointed  Hope to try again one day to change my review as my opinion
Natasha L.,"Spring Hill, FL",17,25,3,5.0,12/5/2017,I always sit at the bar and never ever have I had bad service or food! Also the get the Tito's Vodkarita make sure to ask for the Strawberry one so good! Plus they have a deal for an appetizer and two entrees for I think 22 bucks! Best deal in town for sure!
Desirea B.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,2,3.0,11/13/2017,"I'm only giving three stars because the food was good. The waitress was slow, made us wait while she tended to other tasks that were given after mine. She gave us our drinks told us she would be ""right back"" with our straws but didn't return till 6 minuets later. (Why not grab the straws before bringing the drinks?) also had to wait for sauce over 10 minuets. While I tried to remind her she replied with ""I still have to put the request in for them. I'll be right back"" once again.. (why didn't you do that while you put in the order for our pickles?) after we ate our food, we asked for the ""lava cake"" dessert and she brought us a small one for both of us to share but charged us for a big one. Thankfully we noticed the mistake and had her correct it. Our whole bill was over $55.00. I think we should have had better for what we paid. But at least the food was decently good."
Dori F.,"Spring Hill, FL",22,6,,5.0,5/6/2017,"Shout out to Chili's on 50 in Brooksville, FL.  Dayna, Kelly and David = AWESOME JOB!! We needed food for 40 people yesterday on very short notice for lunch, they handled it like champs! Service was GREAT,timing was AWESOME, food was DELICIOUS and they even delivered it for us.   Our staff was happy and their bellies were full, everyone enjoyed! Thanks again"
Benjamin H.,"Spring Hill, FL",26,92,17,2.0,4/29/2017,Loud and the bar area always smells really bad. The food is sometimes good and the service is mostly slow. More of a bar than a restaurant really. Ok for having a few reasonably priced drinks with friends but eat somewhere else if you want to enjoy your food.
Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5405,1.0,10/25/2015,"Service here is abhorrent.  I wish I could leave it at that, but Yelp admins would move this review to the ""tips"" section.  So for the sake of length... Blah, blah, blah... ""Will you be ordering any appetizers?""  ""No thanks.""  ""OK,"" and walks away for nearly 10 minutes... Blah, blah, blah... 10 minutes in, and finally we order drinks... Blah, blah, blah... 20 minutes to get a food order in Blah, blah, blah... 45 minutes to actually get our food Blah, blah, blah... shrimps in the fajita were the size of a dime Blah, blah, blah... never got the endless chips and salsa that come with a fajita order... Blah, blah, blah... Never got plates.  Two of us had to hover and eat over the skillet Blah, blah, blah... took forever to get the check Blah, blah, blah... floor was dangerously slippery Blah, blah, blah... This place freaking suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks donkey nuts."
Stacy G.,"Spring Hill, FL",2,29,24,1.0,3/17/2017,"Service. Why is that such a difficult word for the staff at this place?  Get ignored at the door, ignored when ordering, ignored with drink refills.  I'm thinking this server has not realized that a tip is given-if earned- by me, THE CUSTOMER. My tip for this particular server is to find a new career; perhaps one that doesn't deal with the public.  She wasn't even personable to any of the tables she was serving around us.  The restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full with patrons.  Ridiculous.  I really thought this was a fluke but I remember the lousy service we had from her in the past. I'm convinced it's her way of life. Oh Marcy, please find a new career or fix whatever in your life is making you bitter and inefficient. What should be a simple lunch, ordered off the menu with absolutely no modifications is now heading to the 45 minute mark since we walked through the door.  And still no lunch.  Maybe the mistake is coming here hungry. But since this IS a restaurant I thought that was kind of a prerequisite.  Bye Chilis.  I'm breaking up with you--  it's not me, it's you!"
Marcy H.,"Brooksville, FL",13,3,,5.0,8/19/2017,I just got a Chili ' s coupon for chips and guac or queso  LOVE the food always a generous portion and 2 for 1 Happy Hour drinks and $5.00 Thursday margaritas  are great   LOVE the app !!!
Cortney M.,"Tampa Bay, FL",22,42,109,1.0,1/18/2017,"Why every single time I get an order to go it's literally always, 100% of the time, wrong! Maybe once, maybe even twice but 5, 6, 7 times.. what is wrong with this place. It's not even the same person on the phone taking the order every time either, so that's not the problem. They hire incompetent employees is the problem.. what other conclusion am I suppose to come to after time and time again. Oh and the manager.. spoke to a female manager once and she did nothing about it, thanks. I don't know why I have continued to go back, time and time again.. apparently I'm the fool but this time I finally learned my lesson.. staying away. Oh and yes, I've been inside a few times too. The service is a hit or miss, usually a miss and the food is honestly usually a miss too, usually not cooked up to par. Also, one time I went in and literally waited nearly ten minutes to be seated. I am a host myself and I understand a couple, maybe a few minutes but nearly ten minutes at the front door waiting to be seated as servers walk past and bartenders look over at you.. awkward, rude, unprofessional, kinda ridiculous."
Jessica S.,"Groveland, FL",14,6,,1.0,11/10/2016,"Dinner was over cooked, service - even though she tried, it took 10 minutes to be acknowledged, and another 10-15 minutes just to get our drinks. Definitely won't be back to this one."
Kristi S.,"Hernando, FL",69,58,361,4.0,6/3/2015,"As far as Chilis Restaurants go, this location is one of the better ones. Not only because it's new and clean but they have a very knowledgeable staff. We sat in the bar area at a table around dinner time on a weekday. Bartender Nick was attentive and after speaking with him we found he's been in this business a while and knows his stuff! We ordered the table side guacamole with his recommendation which was pretty good but we've had this before in Citywalk at a Mexican restaurant and it was excellent there so we were a little jaded.  I'm dieting so I ordered their steak from their light menu and it was filling and yummy as far as low cal foods go.  But my diet went out the window when we ended up ordering the brownie skillet. THAT was to die for. This would be on my last request menu. So good.  We will be back. It's local, great staff (on the multiple times we've been there), and the food is pretty good."
John B.,"Brooksville, FL",56,84,11,1.0,4/6/2015,"CHILLED OUT on Chili's! We stopped into this brand spanking new Chili's in hopes of having a better experience than we've had at the one on Commercial Way in Spring Hill.  Our initial negative wave was noise! The first thing that hit us was a very HIGH ambient noise level. Lots of sparse and stark surfaces within a building causes sounds to bounce off the walls and ceilings and directly into your ears. Unfortunately today, a lot of establishments go for this 'clean' and 'modern' motif, with no curtains, upholstery or soft surfaces that tend to 'soak' up sound. In exchange for the clean and sterile look, you end up with sound waves inundating your ears from all directions.  Because of the high noise level we chose to sit at the bar, which was located separated a bit from the main dining area. We felt it would be doable. Sitting at the end of the bar, we were eventually noticed by the server/bar tender. My lovable and affable fiancée asked for a glass of Pinot Grigio. Not a huge or complicated order by any means. The server announced that they were 'out' of Pinot Grigio, and they had been out since Saturday. Really? Really? Lovable and affable looked at me, and I could see the hand-writing on the wall. Well, at least I could see it in her eyes. I knew this Chili's chow train was coming to a screeching halt, and quite abruptly.  So, based on the high noise level, and the restaurant being out of what most restaurateurs would consider a staple wine, we opted to depart the premises. We kindly advised the server we would be vacating our seats and without further ado, we walked out. Our first exposure to this Chili's has cemented what we had read and heard. They need to get their act together, control their inventory and consider another line of business. Perhaps something less food centered??? Or, wine centered?? Maybe they should consider selling EAR PLUGS!?? Now there's a thought! If you decide to give this Chili's a go, take your own wine, and a pair of ear plugs."
Thomas T.,"Silver Beach, MI",5,135,176,1.0,1/10/2016,"First time here. I really like Mexican food. Surprisingly there are not very many Mexican restaurants around this area, so I thought Chili's Tex-Mex might be a good substitute. WRONG! I walk in and this place was VERY LOUD, NOISEY! I sit down and the waitress wants my drink order in 5 seconds, as I hem and haw she just says ""I'll bring you some water to start"". Fine. She brings the water, with a slice of lemon floating in it- WHICH I HATE! As I am looking at the glass deciding whether or not to ask for another glass of CLEAN water, I notice another piece of food down towards the bottom on the INSIDE of the glass. It looked like a bean skin! ICK! As I pointed to it, the waitress also noticed and she apologized and said she would bring another right away, I ordered a Coke as well and she said she would bring me chips and salsa (usual and complimentary or included with the price, whichever way you want to look at it). I ordered the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla and started in on the chips and salsa. The salsa was a little weak, but O.K. I squeezed some limes into it as I usually do with any salsa and I stirred it with my fork. A BIG, NASTY piece of SKIN came up on my fork and I was quite disgusted. It wasn't actually skin- it was an old, soggy chip that some how ended-up in my salsa!  I asked for the manager and he told me ""Yeh, that happens sometimes, we keep the chips right next to the salsa and sometimes they fall in"". He offered to bring me new salsa, but as I thought about his answer it didn't make sense to me. Either you don't store your salsa in a refrigerator (which would be stupid AND dangerous!) or you keep your tortilla chips in the refrigerator, which would be VERY stupid! How else could chips accidentally fall into the salsa sometimes??? When my quesadilla came out I opted for dipping the cut pieces in my salsa rather than the white jalapeno sauce that came with the entrée, good thing too! Just as I was about to try the jalapeno sauce I noticed A LONG, NASTY BLACK HAIR IN THE SAUCE!!! WTF???! I have very short hair (maybe 3/4 of an inch), there is no way this was mine! I asked for the manager again. This time when he came out I was becoming quite annoyed. The table next to me heard the story. He apologized and said he personally would re-make my food in about 5 minutes and bring it out to me. He brought my quesadilla out and said he would comp my meal. I ate about half of my food, but I really wasn't all that hungry anymore.  - Dirty water glass. - Soggy, old chip that looks like skin in my salsa. - Hair in my quesadilla sauce. = Loss of appetite. I really expected better from a national chain like Chili's, guess I was wrong.(see photos) ***********UPDATE  01/19/2016*********************** I sent the above to Chili's Corp. over a week ago. I received no response, I guess Chili's doesn't care about it's customers! ***********UPDATED UPDATE************************ A few days after the above update, the Chili's manager did finally contact me and sent a gift card. I used it at the Chili's on HWY 19, Springhill- the food and the service were much better!"
Emily P.,"Spring Hill, FL",4,4,,1.0,10/31/2016,"This place refused service at 10:15 pm. for 17 people on Oct 30th, for no other reason than they had to split them up into too many wait staff departments in order to split the ""tip"" properly. It was a group of Homecoming kids & let's face the fact, they were fearing no tip & a big mess....my niece asked for just letting them have a couple of booths and again were told they couldn't serve them. So they went across the street to Texas Roadhouse where they were happy to serve them & for that they generously tipped because they were so grateful, so corporate will get a call today because it's not up to wait staff as to whom to serve or not serve. Disgusting!"
Danielle S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",84,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,Chilis in Brooksville Fl has just discontinued Stella beer on tap and in the bottle - plus the service was horrible- bad move by corporate-won't be back......
Jacki S.,"Hazleton, PA",7,9,4,2.0,4/2/2017,"I'm not quite sure if my review will help as I see other have had similar experiences at this particular chili's. I had a bad time the second I walked in the door. My husband and daughter and I were driving around looking for somewhere to eat. And we came across this location. We have been frequenting another location as it is absolutely perfect and decided it's got to be as good as the other right? NO! As soon as I walked in I almost fell on my rear the floor thru out the entire restaurant mind you was like a skating rink. It was like someone mopped the floor with grease. Yet as a whole it seemed clean so I have no idea what that was all about. Our server I believe his name was zach was the only plus in my entire time there. He was sweet pleasant and definitely over worked yet still had a smile on his face. That man deserves a raise. It was a bunch of little things that added up to a bad experience and some were out of chili's hands but they didn't help. We got seated quickly and as it was a Saturday night at around 8, I was pleasantly surprised. The pleasant disappeared rather quickly. It was as loud as a freight train in there! No thanks to the pregnant woman giving birth on the floor right next our table. Obviously it took time to get our food not really complaining as it was expected since we went when we did. But the food was not good just a touch above edible. My daughter had the mac n cheese and it looked old. My husband and I got steak. He ordered his medium with fries and I got mine well done with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They somehow switched our steak preference and he got well done as I was stuck with medium. That turned me off but as I was helping my daughter and my husband was almost finished by the time I got to mine I was stuck with it. It rolled my stomach to eat yet I did so anyway since I'm paying quite a bit for it! It was all hot when it was delivered yet potatoes looked old. The steak was so chewy which surprised me as it was still pink. From my understanding it gets chewy when it's over cooked so I have no idea. It was altogether an unpleasant experience. From the greasy floor, no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom and food that was expensive and not worth it. I will be making sure I go to the other location from now on. I plead that our wonderful server transfer as he was a diamond in the rough at that joint."
V T.,"Spring Hill, FL",1,2,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Order to go order online for pick up. Stated on the ticket no jalpenos on tex cheese fries. Server did not check order before putting out order . Second when the did fix the fries took another 20 minutes. 50,mind total main order cold even mentioned it. No apology. That and then to not offer true curb side like all the chilis I ever been to erks me. If not going to take time and care you would if we coming in to dine then don't offer to go. Complaining because this has become a trend"
Rob R.,"Brooksville, FL",3,22,10,3.0,8/28/2016,"Food was good.  We got tableside guacamole and chips to start.  Quesadilla Explosion Salad and Prime Rib Tacos as the entrees. Outside of the Quesadilla seeming like it had been under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The food was pretty good but the service was incredibly slow. We came in for lunch at 1:50 and left at 3:40 and a lot of that was just waiting for food. No follow up from the staff after drop off.  IF we go back, we'll sit at the bar...they're right there so you can ask what's the holdup? Had to wait 10 minutes for straws and silverware and napkins following the drinks. Servers were friendly just absent."
Shawn J.,"Brooksville, FL",36,225,418,2.0,7/18/2015,"Wow, just wow. We  witnessed an entire tray of food being dropped and the vast majority of it continued to lie there for at least 20 minutes until someone else slipped in it and finally a guy went over and cleaned it up. The steak and shrimp fajitas are a ripoff, like 3 oz of steak and maybe 9 small shrimp. The steak was very tough.  Drinks were good, the bartender has skills. The floor was filthy, I felt like I was slip sliding all over the place. My wife's Caribbean shrimp salad was good. Both of our sons had good food as well. We will come back in a few weeks and see if it is any better."
Yossy L.,"Tampa, FL",23,23,12,2.0,7/2/2016,Food was good but service was slow & they weren't busy @ all.  I usually go to the Chilli's on Commercial Way.  I wanted to try this one since its newer.  I'll stick to the other one.
Nick W.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,2,,5.0,6/1/2015,"Excellent service. Not sure why the other reviewers are so picky. I mean, come on, noise level? It's a busy restaurant, what do you expect? Food was great. Servers and hosts were extremely friendly. I'm looking forward to coming back again!"
Kenneth P.,"Brooksville, FL",27,26,1,5.0,5/21/2015,"Great food, great service, you'll be in for a great time when visiting! Also, FREE chips and salsa when dining in the bar area!  I had the chicken fajitas, which came out sizzling and was absolutely mouthwatering! Served with a tower of toppings to choose from and plenty of fresh tortillas. Will definitely be returning!"
Katie S.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,6,,1.0,11/9/2016,"Food cold, service doesn't care. Complained to manager, she took off meal, but never came back"
Cathi L.,"Mangum, OK",2,103,16,4.0,1/2/2016,Most of the time Chili's just is mediocre at best any more.. Having said that let me tell ya that this one is really good.. Be sure and sit in the bar so Nick the bartender from Queens can wait on you.. He is a great bartender and waiter..  The food was ok but what made it great was the service we got from Nick.. We will be back because of him..
Danielle W.,"Brooksville, FL",8,8,1,1.0,2/25/2016,Worst customer service ive seen went in for lunch sat there for 20 minutes without a single server asking me a drink order or anything making me late for lunch because wasted my time. Food to go dont even think about it did that a week ago food was overcooked and dry.
Stefanie M.,"Brooksville, FL",0,18,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Good variety, tasty options, attentive service. Rewards program gives decent incentive to stop in more often. Great place to meet friends to catch up"
Aniko H.,"Tampa, FL",15,1,,1.0,3/24/2015,Hubby and I went for dinner not even crowded got seated quickly after 20 min of no service not even for drinks we walked out we were surrounded by wait staff not 1 came to our table staff is not on point will not be returning good luck to you Only reason ur getting a star is because it won't let me leave my review without
Melissa Z.,"Brooksville, FL",0,5,,1.0,1/12/2016,This is the worst Chili's. Super slow service and the food is always wrong. I'll go to the one on 19 from now on.
Andrew E.,"Brooksville, FL",0,7,2,1.0,6/14/2015,"This brand new location should be avoided like the plague, which I hope I didn't contract while I ate there. The overcooked non seasoned steak and desert dry mashed potatoes I ordered could have been cooked better by a 5th grader. The service was absolutely horrible. I have had better service at McDonald's. The manager on duty didn't even bother to stop by and apologize for the pathetic service or horrible food."
Kimberly N.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,144,118,4.0,5/5/2015,"We've been to this Chili's a couple of times and we've never had an issue.  Free chips and salsa if you sit in the bar/lounge area.  Also, if you have a smartphone, make sure you Google ""Chili's coupon"" and you'll almost always find something you can use on your visit, usually a coupon for a free appetizer.  I love the little kiosks that sit on the table, no more waiting on the back and forth with the check, you just zip  your card and pay right there and you're free to go.  The place is nice and clean.  Typically when a chain restaurant makes drastic changes to their menu it's a sign of their demise, but the menu changes Chili's has made have actually been really good."
Lonnie T.,"Brooksville, FL",20,1,,2.0,10/16/2015,"Poor service 1/2 hour to get drinks and 45 min to receive appetizer and guacamole, Sarah lost out on a good tip, sold us 1 beer didn't even ask if we wanted another beer, good thing I didn't order main meals it would've been a 2 hour ordeal. Didn't take what plates we had away when we finished, the fastest thing we got was the check, so Sarah put in minimum effort you make minimum wage"
Shelley M.,"Zelienople, PA",17,4,,1.0,3/29/2015,We went to have dinner for the first time at this location last night around 6pm. They told us 30-45 min wait. We looked around and saw the dining room was a third empty. We walked across the parking lot and had a nice dinner at Bob Evans. 45 mins indeed. Ya'll better get it together; There's plenty of competition.
Rod H.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,5,2,2.0,10/19/2015,"3rd time is finally a charm. Our first two times were atrocious. Horrible servers and response time. It shouldn't take 15 minutes for a server to get your drink order and another 30 minutes to an appetizer. The servers disappear 20 minutes at a time. We had to go to the bar and get our own drinks and eating utensils. There were 2 other couples near our table that just got up walked out because of the poor service. Ridiculous. This last visit would have been my last if they didn't get their act together. Server was prompt and courteous. We may give them a 4th try now.  However, should they fail again in service - we will start going back to the U.S. 19 location as we never had an issue there over a 10 year span."
Leanne R.,"Brooksville, FL",0,2,,1.0,9/5/2015,"This is the 3rd time we've tried this location as it is the closest location for us. We ate at another location earlier in the week and enjoyed the food and service and cleanliness of the restaurant. Not so with this location.  When we walked in we checked in and left our name and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. We said we would wait at the bar. We were not handed any device so we presumed she would call us. The bartender was excellent. After about 20 minutes my husband checked in at the hostess stand. She said she called us and our table was ready. We were never ""called"". After being seated we were introduced to 2 servers who would be ""working  together"" to serve us. We had our drinks from the bar but we're not offered any water.  Our chips and guacamole came but we had no napkins or utensils.  We attempted to get our servers' attention several times as they walked by but were completely ignored.  My husband finally had to get up and request napkins and utensils from another server.  There was toilet paper all over the bathroom floor so I'm sure it had not been checked in a while as they were not very busy for a Friday evening.  Now I know why.  We will be driving the extra 15 miles the next time we want to go to Chili's!"
