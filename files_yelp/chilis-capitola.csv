Terri M.,"Gilroy, CA",33,314,1125,3.0,1/2/2018,"We came here for a quick lunch. It wasn't too busy. In the area we were in there was 3 people seated and I guess they had been waiting for awhile for their order, over 30 minutes, and they still hadn't received anything.  We ordered, I ordered the fajitas with loaded mashed potatoes. My daughter ordered the kids mac n cheese. Then 2 other groups were seated in the same area as us.  Our food came out about 15 minutes later, and the other groups food came out around the same time as ours. But the original group never got their food. The loaded mashed potatoes were the best. I felt so bad for the ladies who had never received their food. They had asked the waitress about 5 times what happened with their food. Two times she said it should have been brought out to them, another she said it was in the back, then she came back saying it was never made. These ladies were there for over an hour and a half. They asked the waitress about getting a gift certificate for having to wait so long and not get anything. I think they should have got a free meal and a gift certificate. But it didn't seem as if they waitress cared about those customers."
Peter L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1071,109,204,2.0,10/1/2017,"I haven't been here for a long time but recently came here for dinner, requested by my nephew. I never come here because the quality of food was never good for me.  It was really busy during dinner so we expected to wait. They seemed understaffed as it took 20 minutes for a server to ask for beverages. Knowing this we had our order ready too.  Food took about 40 minutes to come out and you can tell the cooks in the back were swamped. I don't expect fine dining lol but it was still unacceptable. Food seemed frozen and heated/cooked too fast, vegetables tasted frozen and the steak was overly salty.  Their onion rings were good even with their watery ranch lol. I think I would have to be really wasted to enjoy their food. Although the people next to us had good looking burgers. I think Santa Cruz Diner would have been a better option and that place is pretty bad too. I think it would help to get... More employees to help out. The hosts were running around like headless chickens and bussing too. It was clear the kitchen had too many tickets or just unorganized. The food really reflected it."
Josh T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,27,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"I knew that we shouldn't have gone to chili's, I knew we would be disappointed but it's the chips and salsa. So we went anyways. Apparently they're doing an on line wait list in addition to the in restaurant waitlist. This translated into an extremely long wait, but you know.... chips and salsa. The two young men who were hosting seemed to be lost in general, like just lost but they were also busing tables so I'm sure that accounted for their general inability to function. Once we finally were seated, the waiter was relatively nice. We ordered 1 order of the ultimate meat meal combo or whatever they call it to share. We had to ask our waiter to go find our order after about 30 minutes. When it arrived, (without the fries initially) it was the saddest food I have ever seen. The corn on the cob was revolting it tasted freezer burnt and whatever they put on it tasted foul. The ribs were worse than usual at chilis, they had been sitting out for awhile, really gross. The chicken crispers were soaked in oil and just gross. The jalapeño cheese sausage was actually not horrible in taste but in looks it's was really bad. When our fries finally showed up they were ok, I mean it pretty hard to screw up fries.  The bill was 31.00 for two sodas, one entree and chips and salsa. The service was abysmal. While I understand that I shouldn't expect too much from a chain restaurant, this place is awful and has gotten worse over the years.  If the owners read these reviews, they really need to reevaluate how their restaurant is running. Also please take my advice, this place gets 2 1/2 stars for a reason! Do not go there! No matter how strong the craving for chips and salsa is! The service is horrible and no one who is there is happy, you will leave bloated and disappointed at how much you spent for the crap you got."
Andrina D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Awful service - Wait - NO SERVICE.  I went here at 7:15pm on 1/4/18 for dinner.  We were seated in about 5 minutes. Restaurants had maybe 5 groups max. We were given menus by the hostess and that is the last we saw of any staff.  We waited until 7:48pm and we finally left. The servers were all there and did not acknowledge us at all.  No offer to take drink orders; no hello; NOTHING.  I know this service at this place is bad, but it has never been this bad.  A waste of 33+ minutes of my life.  I will never return.  Ironically as we left, the hostess said ""have a nice evening"".  How Ironic."
Alexandra S.,"Aptos, CA",0,4,1,2.0,1/7/2018,Bad service and the wait is forever....been waiting for my food for like 40 minutes. This is bull****
Johnny S.,"Watsonville, CA",10,59,6,2.0,11/17/2017,Service sucked and it took a really long time to get our drinks and i ordered a titos punch and i doubt there was even any alcohal i only tasted the flavoring
Stephanie S.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Arrived today for lunch, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Finally ordered drinks and chips and waitress said she'd be right back to take our order- she literally never came back. We waited about 45 minutes, as we were eating chips, but finally just paid for what we had and left. People around us were leaving after being seated because no one ever showed up to even take their drink order. Really, really bad."
Mickey J.,"Aptos, CA",9,34,,1.0,10/9/2017,"if I could give these guys a zero , I would. My wife and I came in and service was horrible. We got the only table available, it was so dirty, I bartender said someone would be with us shortly, they never came to clean the table let alone serve us. We left, went to another place and gladly handed over sixty five for the meal and a twenty percent tip. Do not go to chilis, service is horrible at the mall. My wife called the manager, he said we have systems in place, we should not have received such horrible service. Save your money, mcdonalds is so musch more professional."
Megan M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",20,6,,5.0,9/4/2017,"Pleasantly surprised with the vegan options! The margarita chicken mex bowl is vegan without the chicken, and it was actually really good and filling! There's sides available too, will definitely be trying them next time."
Wendy P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,2,,1.0,10/30/2017,We went to Chili's since they say that there is a new menu. We ordered the steak fajitas and a chicken salad. The fajitas came out and the steak was two different temperatures. The side of rice was cold like it came just from the fridge. Then there was hair in the salad. The service is tolerable and probably adequate considering that they were busy on a Monday. But we waited a long time for our order and then for our waitress to come check on us. She actually walked past at least five times maybe more looked directly at me and kept walking. The Ziosk device also wasn't functioning so we couldn't even request the waitress to come. I don't think that we will ever come back again. I can say one mistake could happen but for both of us to have separate issues with our food and a lack of response from the staff it is something that turns you off to a restaurant forever.
Lorena F.,"Watsonville, CA",0,28,7,1.0,11/2/2017,"This place is a total joke. I went in around 2:40 and it took them 30 min to make a grill cheese and fries for my client, I'm there sitting and waiting, looked around and restaurant was almost empty. All my client and I would hear was a lady screaming in the kitchen.... mi client has special needs and was scared because she thought someone was fighting, she got up and looked inside the kitchen. It was a lady named Valerie super loud mouth. Even though my food was never brought out they still charged me my freaking soda. Such bad customer service, as much as my client loves this place , I will NEVER VISIT THIS Chilis location anymore. Also kitchen people had loud music, sounded like a party in the kitchen. They don't take care of customers. Soo sad!!"
Mick T.,"Scotts Valley, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/24/2017,"Pretty good usually, this time I think they forgot some of our order. I took them about an hour to get us fajitas. Overall pretty good other wise."
Tim T.,"Hollister, CA",4,11,5,2.0,10/8/2017,Oh chillis you let me down. Service was ok. Table was sticky. Drinks were expensive. Simple appetizer took almost 30 mins. I didn't order another drink or a actual meal.
Brianna G.,"Watsonville, CA",40,4,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"We used to come to chilis all the time and we LOVED IT! However, our last encounter (Fri, Oct 20th) will be the absolute last time we come. We are also currently disputing charges with out bank. We came in and sat down at a bar table, waited for someone to come to our table for 15 minutes...even though a female waitress in the bar walked passed us 3 times without acknowledging us. The restaurant was steady but by no means slammed. Finally a big jersey shore looking dude came up to us and took our order. About 15 minutes later, our food was brought to us by a food runner who dumped and ran... and we still had not received our beers (which had been sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes ready for jersey boy to bring it to us). I had to walk up to the bartender and ask him to hand me our beers. We finished our beer and our food, at this point our server hadn't even come to ask us how our food was/clear a plate/refresh drinks..NOTHING, even though he was walking by to other tables. I walked over to the host station got a manager and expressed how disappointed we were with the visit. I told him I wanted nothing out of it, but thought he should know as we were frequent, long time customers and this is not how this place normally operates. He apologized, and said he would adjust our bill and talk with the waiter after we left. We pay our bill over the little electronic device and the manager had taken off our beers for our trouble. We left our waiter a $0 tip, as that was what he deserved for the 0 service we got (and I have never done that). This morning I logged into my bank account online to find our server added himself in a $4 tip. I will be calling Chili's when they open today, and going into my bank tomorrow morning to dispute the charges. I am shocked and they have lost a customer for life at this location. And, if you're reading this Jersey boy, choose a new profession...you're a terrible waiter."
Trisha H.,"Campbell, CA",23,7,,4.0,9/10/2017,"It was pretty good, food was hot and came quick. My kids and I were full off the portions and we loved the free refills of chips and salsa! My kids love the chips and salsa and sprite refills. Our host was super sweet and polite, I like his service. The woman's restroom was not to my expectations and it's a small resturant.  Other than that it was ok."
Jay M.,"Galt, CA",19,61,,4.0,11/21/2017,"Went there for lunch..got seated right away. Server came right away also. My friend and I had salads, which were really good and large. Had their chips and guacamole which I would highly recommend. Overall nice experience."
Samantha C.,"Fullerton, CA",0,8,2,2.0,5/19/2017,"Dude.. my ""Ultimate"" Bacon Burger was everything short of whatever it said it was to be. ""Double Bacon"" was more like three small strips, ""Lettuce, tomato, red onion"" yeah they just decided to skip all of these entirely, ""jalapeño aioli"" skipped that too. So what I got was a bun, a patty, and three strips of bacon... hahah what a joke! The honey chipotle chicken crisper and waffles were bangin though!"
Kay C.,"Sarasota, FL",0,19,,1.0,9/23/2017,They changed their menu a few days ago....just not the same Chili's. Very disappointing! I will not be returning.  :(
James L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/15/2017,Love this place great service and good food at a more than fair price I always come in during happy hour for lunch
Nita B.,"Aptos, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/13/2017,I like Chili's and the variety of food they offer but this visit was a bit disappointing.   My food arrived barely warm and was completing cold before i could finish it.
Josie L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/6/2017,"3 stars because when I came to eat in the bar area, the service was pretty good and attentive. I ordered the Texas cheese fries and they were so good! My boyfriend knew the bartender and she was very helpful. However, when I ordered a to go order a few days later, the girl taking our order did not know how. We had to repeat our order 3 times and she read it back to us exactly how we said it and it was still very wrong. It was my mistake not double checking the order when I picked it up. We wanted the burger to come with onion rings, but it came with fries. We wanted a burger with only bacon and cheese and there was other stuff in it.  Seems to be inconsistent.  When they get your order right though, it's delicious."
Kit B.,"Serra Highlands, South San Francisco, CA",17,23,1,2.0,10/30/2017,"This place has really gone downhill. My family used to go here pretty often because the food was inexpensive & good. But this last visit was just a disappointment. There were so many dirty tables & nobody was bussing them. So we sat at one of there few empty/clean tables. Our server took our orders pretty quickly but the quality of the food was the disappointment. The salad I got had brown lettuce & you could tell it had been sitting out for a while. We also ordered a burger that was 80% grease which I later learned means that they don't clean their grill. Too bad, because the mall doesn't have many other restraints around."
charlie s.,"Santa Cruz, CA",106,10,3,1.0,12/22/2016,"Well my son and I went in for dinner then Christmas shopping! The service was awesome! Now Jake and I got this smoke house plate thing for $14.99. With chicken strips and some ribs and random sides. The ribs amazing my 9 year old loved them  due to his chicken being cold and not crispy. So i asked the kid if he wants to take the chicken home ""NO"" at this time I realized how bad the chicken was. We told the waitress about she said manager will be right over... We waited and waited and waited  finaly. Casey Armbruster showed up with her splendid attitude  (don't think she should be in customer service) and said ""You want two free strips or pay the bill"" Two strips would have been grate 20 min ago but my kid ate my meal so he is not hungry now..... I asked for couple bucks off.....Casey Armbruster no and walked off. So I paid the bill and left. NO SORRY NOTHING JUST ATTITUDE!  Let me tell you o have never been treated so poorly by a manager in my life. Chili's or the GM please free to contact me and we can go into more details"
Eric P.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/30/2017,We used to enjoy going here but our last experience reminded me of eating pre-packaged food straight out of a microwave. The cajun chicken pasta was awful! The chicken had no browning and no spice whatsoever. I certainly hope they step up their game in the kitchen. I might go back but not until I hear that it has improved. It would be nice if their chips and salsa came with the meal and didn't need to be purchased separately too.
Amy C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/1/2017,"Faith restored. I placed an order online and when I arrived in store there was a glitch. My order was nowhere to be found. I'm thankful the manager, David, took care of me. My boyfriend and I will continue to order food from this location."
Nick S.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,5,5.0,5/28/2017,"This place is literal heaven. I had the option for a 70 dollar steak dinner and chose chilis instead because it is that good. The service is so good, the food is even greater, and Chilis is my home."
Robin D.,"Capitola, CA",1,20,1,5.0,9/30/2017,"We were stuck at the mall waiting for T-mobile to upgrade our phones and ended up having a fun time at Chili's. Good drinks and food for very reasonable prices. We sat at the bar and the service was fantastic, very friendly!!"
Todd M.,"Soquel, CA",0,9,2,2.0,6/9/2017,A word to Management:  tonight there were 12 open tables @ 745pm.  Still we were made to wait 20 minutes.  Seems like staffing was way off tonight.  I just wanted to spend money on drinks and food. I assume there is profit in that for you?
Ocean Y.,"Aptos, CA",0,46,,3.0,8/30/2017,Decent food. Chips and salsa are the best thing going there. Stick with the appitizers to keep cost down. Cocktails very weak.
April A.,"Ben Lomond, CA",2,11,2,1.0,11/22/2016,"I GOT FOOD POISONING!! Tonight my boyfriend and I went for dinner he had the chicken pasta and I had the quesadilla chicken salad. The manager brought our food the first time set it on the table my salad look like it'd been sitting out for a week. The salad was room temperature , Wilted brown lettuce, stale quesadillas. I look like it has been sitting out for a few hours. I asked the waitress to please exchange my salad for a fresh one. The second salad came out and at least it was cold.  We went home. I have been sick ever since. Never going back!!"
Jimi Y.,"Schaumburg, IL",117,35,,1.0,1/1/2017,The worst service I ever had here.  I came here a few weeks ago and the night shift practically ignored us.  It took almost 2 hrs to bring out food.  Asked for plates but plates were never brought out.  Went and look for waitress and no where to be found.  I never had service like this ever.  I would never come to this place ever again.
Shabnam H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"The worst service ever! Ordered a To Go order and went to go pick it up at the to go counter but it was closed. So I decided to go the front in which they directed me to the bar because that's supposedly where they deal with their to go orders. Took me 15 mins just to get the bartenders attention, keep in mind it was a Thursday night at 9:30 so it wasn't busy at all. After asking about my order the bartender took another 20 mins to go get the food from the kitchen. She gave me the food and quickly left to go refill drinks at the bar. So I had to wait another 15 mins to pay for the food. It was the worst experience, might as well just sat down and ate at the restaurant."
Hector A.,"Capitola, CA",210,2,,5.0,1/19/2017,I am so pleased with the service I received by Vic who is my serverevery time I come in he has such a friendly demeanor and is very kid oriented and family I hope we get to see more of him every time you come in make the visit a lot more pleasant
Tiana L.,"Salinas, CA",52,37,44,5.0,5/15/2016,Idk what's with the bad reviews but this is one of the best ones I've been to! I'm watching them take care of the customers alone with me the entire time.
Hulita F.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/12/2017,"We were a party of 9 on a Sunday evening. It was not too busy (it's in the mall so lunch is probably more busy). We were greeted warmly, told it would be 5 minutes to get our table(s) set and he wasn't lying. We were seated, waitress took our drink/appetizer order and she was great. She got all of our orders right and was very attentive to our needs (refills...lots of refills).  Caitlyn was an awesome (!!) waitress and the food was pretty good too. The burgers, steak & shrimp fajitas, and prime rib tacos were great! Our table of kids, teens, and adults were very happy. Thank you!"
Shaina Marie W.,"Sacramento, CA",68,95,64,1.0,2/20/2015,"Only come here if your expecting one step above fast food. Veggies and meat were horrible. The worst of the worst low grade foods. Our server was great! Manager was less than satisfactory. Won't be back. Asparagus looked like a pine tree branch shriveled with spikes as a top. Broccoli was white in spots. Meat was not memorable... Yuk.  Tea was good and so was lemonade our server never let our drink go empty. She made sure we had all our condiments and always asked if we needed anything every few times she passed our table. You would expect of a customer are one bite of meat and one bite of broccoli you would remove it from their order. Not a chance, manager removed $3 from the bill. Thanks bud."
Emily D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,9,4,1.0,10/2/2016,I really wish they would put a different restaurant here. Food sucks. Their Coors Light always tastes gross. The bartenders even say that it is a known issue and everyone tells them that. The staff is always very friendly though.
Karla M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/9/2017,"I came in here on Friday, September 7th, 2017 with a friend. We were sat immediately and were given a nice booth. Our waiter asked for our drinks. He gave us a couple of minutes to look in the menu. My friend ordered the guac/salsa and nachos and a burger with a black bean patty. I ordered the honey chipotle chicken crispers. The guacamole was horrible, the guacamole was black! We couldn't believe that our waiter had just given us that. We told him the guacamole was black and said he would replace it with a new one, which he did. Now, both of our food was served on a TRAY, not on a plate, but actual metallic tray. Wth? I noticed other people's foods were served on an actual plate. The chicken tasted awful, it was undercooked! The fries were so cold! The mashed potatoes I ordered were so awful, they were so cold! Needless to say, the food was horrible and I had to flag down other waiters so I could be given a knife to cut into my chicken crispers!! Oh and my fork was given to me in a paper bag?! Wth?! So the waiter was no where to be found and the food was gross."
Elvia M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",113,1,4,2.0,5/31/2017,"Ok so... normally I'm not one to write a bad review or anything but honestly come on guys the table were dirty! I was literally watching one of the hosts moving dirty dishes from one table to another I was like bro really. I'm assuming that they are hiring for bussers cause obviously they had none. The host went to sit some people at a table and the lady told him oh it's dirty over here too. When we were getting seated the host looked at the table and then realized it was still a little dirty and kept walking. Then we got sat in the very back corner surrounded by dirty tables. And it was a Tuesday night so it wasn't packed. Maybe because management wasn't there or they obviously didn't care to come out and help their employees. The host was a sweet guy and all, so was our waiter but the atmosphere wasn't the best. Honestly though I'm not posting this so management can come and tell their employees about how they need to try harder I feel it's management who needs to help out more. The food was pretty good not complaining about that."
Parker M.,"Capitola, CA",2,1,,1.0,10/25/2016,"Absolutely horrible, service and food. Came little before closing time, everything was half assed, food was cold, chicken was pink. Don't recommend going there, I sure won't return."
