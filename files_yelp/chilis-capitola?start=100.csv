Linda M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,18,3,3.0,7/17/2015,"Food is decent here... Good prices. I really like the drink selections and service. We went here with a big party for dinner and drinks  and the waiter Dustin took excellent care of everybody. He made it super easy to split up the tab and everyone enjoyed their food. Chilies is a great affordable choice for a fun dinner out with friends. Very pleased with the friendly service and the drinks were tasty. Will come back here for sure. I would give 5 stars for Dustin's service, 4 stars for drinks... The 3 star rating is mainly for the food. I'll be back for sure! Especially with a large group.. They took great care of us!"
Ernie R.,"Salinas, CA",7,69,2,2.0,6/14/2014,WOW talk about false advertisement. What a joke dont ever order the fajitas here. Looks nothing like the picture AT ALL!. How ever the 2 stars are not for my awsome server or manager but the cooks and Chillis Co. So sad. DO NOT GET THE FAJITAS!!
Ronald C.,"Capitola, CA",1,4,2,1.0,10/13/2013,"The worst experience from the host, to the waiter, and the cooks and all levels of management.."
Juanita C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,18,,1.0,10/11/2014,Discussing. The shrimp tastes like shit. Horrible service.. Chilis has really gone down hill. Don't listen to the big posters and stuff saying that the fajitas are good because they taste like throw up. It is definitely not fresh at all
jim h.,"San Jose, CA",12,76,1,5.0,10/2/2012,Thank you Candice!!! We had the best service and we had a great time!! The food was excellent as well as your service!!! Your the Best!!! A++ Thank you for spoiling us!!!  Jim
Mari R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",25,143,52,4.0,11/17/2013,A great place for a burger or salad when you are in Capitola. The servers are always friendly and the food is yummy. We are hooked on their chips and queso dip!
Chris W.,"Stockton, CA",13,77,3,4.0,6/19/2011,"Chili's has pretty good food at a decent price with filling portions; that gets them 3 stars, the extra star is for the excellent service we received.   There's a great appetizer combo that allows you to mix and match 3 apps with portion sizes that will satisfy 2-4 people.  They offer a generous portion of ribs at a low price. My girlfriend and I arrived during peak dinner hour; the place was full, and we weren't sure that we'd get a seat.  I was also hesitant due to the large crowd; I've reviewed a few places, and some of them ignore you during peak hours.  This was absolutely not the case at Chili's.  Our host greeted us and found seats right away; our sever was very quick and always smiled.  He would frequently check up on us and give us updates on the status of our food.  Because of this service, I would definitely go back again and again."
Candace L.,"Los Altos Hills, CA",69,92,16,2.0,4/7/2011,"i just don't know about this place.  It really comes down to being hit or miss.  Food is standard, nothing to really praise about.  Sometimes they have really good deals (something like an appetizer, two entree, and desert for 20 bucks or something) which is pretty awesome.   Waitstaff is definitely a hit or miss, but not the worse experience I've ever had.  I think Applebee's was the worse, but Chili's is not too far behind them. The last time we went, I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot to put in our order. boo! We waited for what seemed like forever.  Everything just seemed to take a lifetime.  Food was adequate.  The Jalapeno Chicken Quesadillas were probably the only thing that was really worth a stop here."
Jeffrey F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,87,,5.0,6/25/2015,The menu has improved greatly. In the 80s this was my main stay then they got away from the quality . But now rite back at it with great food and great service.
Dilys Y.,"Oakland, CA",247,131,742,2.0,6/27/2013,Mediocre food for cheap price. Not bad. I always get the 2 for $20 deal. I joined the email club so that they send me coupons for free appetizers or dessert.
Pam S.,"Boston, MA",578,747,14,3.0,1/11/2009,"Unfortunately, they don't have t-shirts that read ""I survived working at Chili's,"" otherwise I would probably have a stack of them.  Working at Chili's isn't that difficult.  Except when you go out with your friends and get drunk and put on your already worn Chili's outfit and smell the used grease and subsequently make very good friends with your friend Brian's toilet.  You take orders for drinks, you bring them out, you take orders for food, you bring that out, you bring a check, and move on.  All in the way of Chili's training. I was craving margaritas, and made my mom think that she wanted one too.  As I didn't feel like going down to the village, we came here.  It was Saturday night, during the rush, but the wait wasn't that bad.  The hostesses were as nice as hostesses could be in such a situation (putting up with disgruntled mall shoppers), and we were sat fairly quickly. Personality-wise, our server was great- attentive, on-time (although she asked us if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, which is not really possible), and was clearly not jaded as a waitress- yet.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad (or whatever it was called), and they didn't have that type of chicken.  Huh?  They had boneless buffalo wings, but they didn't have buffalo chicken tenders?  How hard is it to substitute?  Anyway, after I pointed it out, she said it could be done, so I got it with some modifications.  Which she wrote down.   So our food came out- my mom's was mostly correct, as was mine.  I just wanted diced tomatoes instead of pico de gallo, and nary was a little red tidbit to be found. As Chili's food is pretty standard and never wavers, I'll be back."
Joe D.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,22,5,4.0,10/30/2014,"First time eating here while visiting Capitola. Called in at 6pm, said they had some open tables for a family of four.  Arrived and no hostess by the entrance for a good 5 minutes. Finally got seated by a waitress who cares enough to explain the new ziosk technology they have - it's like a mini screen on every table that customers can use to refill/re-order their drinks, pay their bills, etc... Our waiter Isaac came by to let us know he'll be with us in a few minutes (polite of him to communicate despite how busy he was).  By the time he got to us, he promptly took our orders and kept checking back on us frequently (almost every time he passed by our table on his way to other people's).  He'd come to check up on our drinks, refills on appetizer chips, and if we needed anything at all. The line by the door got longer & the restaurant was getting busier but Isaac stayed on top of his customers and was always attentive & kind-mannered. The other waitresses next to our table were very pleasant and patient too. The food was amazing despite the franchise. We got the 2 for $20. The original BBQ baby back ribs were moist & well-seasoned. Hubby had the chicken fajitas and loved the grilled white meat and mini salad bar rack that it came with. This restaurant is quite kid & family-friendly. They had tons of crayon kits for the kids, ziosk had $0.99 game apps to keep anyone entertained, TV mounted throughout for the hubbies to enjoy, and delicious food choices for all.  I've been to other Chili's before and their ribs are usually dry & overcooked and service is usually inconsistent, but this particular location has it down to a science! They even have a quick 5-question survey on the ziosk to ask how your dining experience was - that shows us how much they care about their service. Great job, Chili's management. Special thanks to Isaac for making our experience here flawless!"
Michael H.,"Scotts Valley, CA",73,33,1,1.0,2/27/2011,"Every now and then enough time will pass that I seem to forget that this is NOT the place to go for any type of meal. Mediocre food, slow confused service, overpriced limp salad and if you order a cup of soup expect about 6 bites for the overwhelming price you will be charged for the experience. If Tex Mex is what your looking for keep driving 5 more minutes to Manuel's in Aptos. You will leave with a smile, well fed with $$ left in your wallet."
Jessica C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",83,10,1,3.0,3/15/2012,My friend suggested we go here and my first thought was-what am I going to eat? So I looked at the menu and saw nachos. I was kind of bracing myself for a mediocre plate of nachos so I set my expectations a bit low. I ordered the regular nachos without meat and it was pretty satisfying for nachos. The cheese wasn't as hot as I would like it but the guacamole made up for it because it was nothing short of delicious. I also had a mango margarita with salt on the rim which was surprisingly a good combo. The salt was not on the rim the last one I ordered one. So this was all in all a good lunch.
Rob S.,"Aptos, CA",7,16,34,1.0,4/12/2013,Don't go here! Horrible service and attitude. I went here with my wife on sunday knowing it was happy hour all day and we were both excited to get some drinks and apps. We ordered drinks promptly and waited 15 mins for them but they never came or were ever made by the bartender. My server had dreadlocks and huge holes in his ear. Also his work shirt looked like it hadn't been washed in a week or two. Step your game up chilis after all you are a nation wide corporation.
Jonathan H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",49,44,3,3.0,10/14/2013,"Very accommodating for my step mom in a wheel chair, no wait time. But the waiter didn't bus our table as we finished our food and all or corn tortillas were messed up for the fajitas. They also burned the sweet potatoe fries..."
Samy L.,"San Jose, CA",150,173,2,3.0,8/28/2011,"This is the only Chili's that is the closest to Santa Cruz. Friends and I went here for happy hour. Happy hour on Sunday is all day, which is pretty awesome! Pretty cheap drinks as well as appetizers! So I was happy with that. The service was nice but sometimes slow as well as the food coming out. We ate by the bar.  I wouldn't go here out of my way and also when we were leaving, we overheard a man telling a little boy (we don't know who he was to him, but he definitely wasn't his dad but they knew each other at least) that he would give him $20 if he went over to a girl and stuck his finger between the denim and her skin. The man proceeded over to some girls and hit on them. It was gross."
David H.,"Oakland, CA",104,201,249,5.0,8/21/2011,"Always a sure thing. Chili's is a great place to eat, cause they've got something for everyone. No matter your mood, you can have a different flavor every time."
Daniel Y.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",23,15,7,5.0,9/25/2012,"The dinner for 2 for $20 is a great deal, take advantage of it. Be warned, however, it IS a lot of food for what you're paying for. Took two to-go boxes out the door with me. Their appetizer chips are amazing, thin and crispy. Had to resist eating them all or else I would've got full just off of them alone. Service was great as well."
Cash M.,"Aptos, CA",0,25,,1.0,9/4/2014,"Bad food, slow service , why did I come here again when I said I wouldn't!! Yuck! Never again chillis. Thanks no thanks."
