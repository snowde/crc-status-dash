Brooklyn W.,"Soquel, CA",0,30,,1.0,4/29/2013,The service here is god AWFUL!!!!!!! And the food too has gone down hill so much since chilis has opened. Get it together!
T F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",117,15,13,1.0,11/21/2013,Its sad to see a place with corporate structure fail so miserably in the service department. The lack of direction from management is very evident. The servers have little support and struggle to keep up with table greetings and check backs. I keep thinking the The only reason I even dine here is because my wife enjoys the salad and soup combo for lunch.
Cyndie C.,"Valley Springs, CA",78,58,1,3.0,9/7/2010,"We decided to take a drive over to the coast with my Mom yesterday and arrived in Capitola thinking we would find some cute little local restaurant and have a nice lunch.  Um, hello? It was Labor Day and there was some sort of festival (Begonia, I believe) down by the beach so there was no parking anywhere. After driving around pointlessly and trying to find something we could all agree on we finally spotted Chili's and decided it was a known quantity so why not?  This Chili's is at the mall. It's kind of a sad looking, old mall but the restaurant looks like any other Chili's. The host who seated us was mostly silent but helpful.  There wasn't a huge crowd in the restaurant but they were fairly busy and we got there just as the lunch ""rush"" started. The waiter came by and we said we weren't ready to order yet so he said he'd give us a couple minutes. Fifteen minutes later there was no sign of him. We didn't even see him anywhere, so my husband flagged one of the bussers and asked her to find our waiter. Another five minutes passed before he finally came to take our order. He apologized and said he had been ""running all over the place"" (which I assume means he was working in other areas of the restaurant as well as our table).  Once he finally took the order, everything was great. He even brought us a free plate of chips and salsa to make up for taking so long.  The food was great as we expected from Chili's so it all worked out ok.  Would we return to this particular restaurant? Maybe, but only if we couldn't find a local non-chain place first."
Mitchell B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",111,42,,3.0,7/12/2011,"I was absolutely psyched that my first check in was Chili's.  This review received a lot of assistance from the fact that my dinner was free (thank you staff meetings). I should have rated this place two stars for sure, but it's hard to complain about a free meal.  However, the appetizers were disgusting. The Texas Cheese Fries (as I think they're called) were greasy, spicy, and artery clogging; the queso dip looked like something out of a science experiment; and the wings were super chewy. But it was all free, so who cares? I ate a ton!  My Fajita Trio was better than expected. Despite the obviously from-a-bag, frozen guacamole, the meat (chicken, steak, and shrimp) was delicious.  I'm not saying I'd pay for a meal here, but mine wasn't half bad."
M E.,"Aptos, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/26/2015,"My husband and I have been here a couple of times, in hopes that each time we will be surprised and the service will get better.  Well... false hope!  Three times is too many times to have horrible service.  We sat down at the bar area and the couple that sat down (15 minutes) after us, received great service and all before us.  By the time we got our plates (35 min later for a salad), lets just say my 5 year old can plate a salad better then they did, and make a better put together quesadilla then what was brought to us.  And that was just my plate.  We waited another 30 minutes to get our check.  That was after we had to get up and chase our waitress and ask her for it.  What made it worse was every table around us got plenty of refills on their drinks and left before us after having a bigger meal than us."
Stanley P.,"Richmond, CA",1,16,3,2.0,8/16/2013,"To give a franchised restaurant anything better than 2 stars is crazy, and no matter which one you go to you will always get the same food quality. The only thing that is different is the service. knowing this I should give it more, but the food is crap and anybody should know this. However, when I go to to this particular Chili's  I always get great customer service and that is the only reason I go back for cheap food."
Michael L.,"Aptos, CA",0,18,,3.0,9/2/2010,"We go to Chili's about two or three times a month.  It is our favorite ""go to/sit down"" place when we want something reasonably priced and pretty good food. Our only complaint, ever, has been inconsistant staffing/service.  Don't misunderstand, when Chili's is good, it's really, really good.  But when it's bad, it's awful.  Again, not ""awful"" where anyone has ever gotten sick, but ""awful"" that it can be a very annoying experience. I've written to corporate about our local Chili's but I think it's like any other large chain.  They can only do so much with what they have to work with. Oh, but, they have the best for the price ribs in town!"
Sabrina R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",28,2,2,2.0,1/4/2013,"Bartenders are WONDERFUL ! but the server(besides Jeff) are horrible! I sat five feet away from my drinks for well over ten minutes, our waiter Shane walked right by four or five times looked at the drinks and us and kept going. I ended up asking another water who had to go find Shane to hand us our drink. After twenty minutes he finally asked us for our food order. Never asked us if we needed another drink, I finally flagged him down and ordered another round, but asked for them quickly. The bartender had them up after about five minutes, it took Shane another ten after that to bring 'em to our table. I got another waiters attention because Shane was too busy, to get a mangier. After explaining to the mangier, he said sorry and offered nothing to make our visit worth the waiting. After talking to the mangier it took another ten minutes to find Shane and get our bill, after we had been done eating for fifteen minutes or more. I walked into the mall with my 16month old son while my boyfriend paid. Shane made sure to say sorry to my boyfriend and said ""Sorry the bartenders are really shitty"".   We go here a lot and the service keeps getting worse and worse."
Amber B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",101,26,13,2.0,2/16/2014,"I went here with some friends about a month ago and was very disappointed. We waited for about five minutes just for a hostess to show up even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. Upon being seated, I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla as per usual and was brought out the completely wrong quesadilla that I did not order. When I informed the server of the mistake, she said she would gladly take care of it. However, she came back with which I believed to be the same exact quesadilla. The only difference was that bacon bits seemed to have been just thrown onto the quesadilla in a futile attempt to disguise the fact that this was the same quesadilla from before. In addition, our waitress was not attentive and came back with requests for more ranch and napkins after we had already finished our meal. I'm not sure if it was because she seemed to have a lot of other tables at the time, but I don't believe that is any excuse to provide poor service to guests. She tried to make up for this by being extremely friendly when she was paying attention to us, which one of my friends then reminded me that we had ""come to eat, not to be her friend"". Wise words. Also, I  visited this location last summer with my family and the hostess sat us in a closed section without informing a server, causing us to wait for about fifteen minutes before any one approached us. I probably will not be visiting this location again. I believe that management needs to do a better job in training their employees on the basics of communication, hospitality, and service. I think they have done an extremely less than adequate job when it comes down to running an efficient restaurant and hopefully changes can be made for future improvement."
David W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,37,1,4.0,4/23/2013,"Pros: typical chain, love the 2 for $20 deal, loaded baked potato, texas cheese fries Cons: been here plenty of times but never had the chilis, decided to try it for the first time, but they ran out...guess thats what I get for going late at night parking: huge lot (capitola mall) To go? Yes, for a cheap date night or with friends, fairly priced and you get what you pay for."
Jennifer K.,"Mountain View, CA",21,57,4,1.0,6/19/2010,"I am sooo over Chili's.  I am tired of being enticed by their commercials only to be extremely disappointed with my meal.  This particular Chili's didn't seem to be any different than others I've been to in the past but it was just the last straw.  I'm done I ordered the big mouth bites (burger sliders) which, instead of 4 mini burger patties, was actually just a burger cut (after it had been cooked) and put on 4 buns... um, lazy!    My fiance had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and it was ok... just ok.  My margarita was delightful but not worth another trip to Chili's. Farewell Chili's and good riddance."
Francisco V.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2014,"I went there for my birthday and they didn't tell us first of all that they were short staff, also service the worst I ever had there the server didn't check on us and we only saw her like three times. A disappointment I don't think I'll ever go there again!"
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,3.0,12/20/2012,I used to think Chili's had decent steaks but I either changed my tastes or they went down hill because the steak was pretty bad. Still they have mostly fair prices and it can be fun to overeat and over drink now and then I suppose.
April S.,"Watsonville, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/19/2012,"Great place to go when you literally have all day....service is VERY slow, even when there are only a couple tables being served.  I've gone a couple times on my lunch and always get back late (even after letting them know I'm short on time because I'm on lunch). Last time I was there I had 40 minutes for lunch and the place was empty, only 2 other tables being served and all I ordered was an appetizer which took about 20-25 minutes to get to me and by that time the fries and cheese were almost cold so must have been sitting there for a while before my waitress bothered to bring it out to me, then I asked for a side of jalapenos and as I waited I watched my waitress go to her other 2 tables and pick up plates and come in and out of the kitchen WITHOUT my jalapens...finally when she walked past my table I asked her again for my jalapenos and she had totally forgot about me asking for them the first time!!! I'd be a little more understanding if it was crazy busy but I mean, COME ON!!   Food is what you'd expect, drinks are pretty good, waiters have all been pretty friendly just don't have a sense of urgency."
Aarash Z.,"Richmond, CA",409,324,9,4.0,9/22/2012,"It's been a while since I had been to Chili's, but one of the good things about chains is for better or worse, they will always taste the same... luckily, this time it was for the better... for what it is, Chili's is pretty good. the southwest eggrolls were tasty, good queso, nice fruity drinks, and the baby back ribs... they always made good ribs... i wish i could give Chili's 3.5 stars... but since our waiter was new, and overly courteous and attentive because he was scared he'd get complained about, i'll give them 4 :)"
Christa P.,"San Francisco, CA",100,11,11,4.0,12/8/2010,"Best thing at Chili's: The Margaritas.  They have a wide variety of drinks, but my favorite has to be the House Margarita. The food there is pretty tasty. They definitely have a lot to choose from, and it comes in big portions. I really like their Fajitas and Bottomless Chips! A little on the pricey side though.  :)"
Kenny P.,"San Jose, CA",660,881,2500,3.0,11/14/2009,"Something about this Chilis location bothers me, it maybe the old feeling C grade mall that it's connected to.  Or the small size of the restaurant, the missing patrons bustling around that you might find at other locations.   It seems like the perfect place that you might have to deal with some B.S. from a server or even a fellow customer for that matter.  A weak Chili's location, but still deserving of 3 stars because their food was alright.   A couple days of partying at a rented beach house in Capitola was the only reason why I been dragged to this dull place.  Clearly not a memorable Chili's location to eat at, and probably the lowest rating I will give a Chili's.  Hopefully I won't be back here for many years."
vincent C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,23,,1.0,9/26/2012,"You know how you tell yourself that the last visit (which was less than satisfying) may have just been your mood or taste at the time? (That's why Andrew Zimmern tries stuff twice, btw). Well, I thought I'd try Chilis in Santa Cruz (41st Ave) one more time to see if it was just me. Let me take this opportunity to tell you, its not just me. After taking forever to get seated, the plastic and dissatisfying food, mediocre service and a general lack of fun atmosphere contributed to a terrible overall experience and my subsequent one star rating. My advice : Go somewhere, anywhere other than this Chili's....this place is terrible."
Franzin C.,"Union City, CA",61,19,14,2.0,1/14/2015,"I went here the other night just for a bite to eat. I the service wasn't completely horrible. Actually I our server was actually a Nice guy. Very straight forward not so personal. Anyways! My girlfriend and I had the 2 for $20 deal because it's a great deal so why not. We went with the half order of Texas fries as an appetizer and well. It was quite horrible to be honest. The fries we cold and stale and the cheese was already cooled down and hard. I don't know if it was just waiting in the window forever or it belonged to someone else earlier and they just decided to reuse it. Oh well I wasn't too concerned at the time. My girlfriend had the mango tilapia? Well yeah. That was good I had a few bite off of it and I wished I had that too because I ordered the chicken crisps with honey chipotle. I enjoyed it, my crisps were warm and I like the sauce. All up until I realized I didn't ask for a long hair down my throat. I was completely disgusted and had lost my appetite. My server was sorry about it and got It discounted off my meal. But yeah. That was dinner people."
Mary J.,"Scotts Valley, CA",6,186,1,1.0,9/17/2013,"We've eaten at various Chili's and found them to be pretty consistent.  This one, however, sucked!  Nothing we had, from chips and salsa to our meals was right.  Room temperature, stale chips, watery salsa etc.  It was a late lunch, and they weren't crowded, but the service was pretty bad, too.  Me thinks a management change, or more training for the staff and cooks is in order"
