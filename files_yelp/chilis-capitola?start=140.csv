Kristyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",138,131,43,5.0,8/14/2012,I love this place! I love that on sundays its happy hour all day and night. The artichoke dip is amazing i always look forward to it. i always order the half rack of ribs with the shiner sauce its so sweet with a zing in your mouth. my husband really enjoys there beer on tap and the many choices on the menu. He enjoys everything he orders and always trys something new. I have been to this establishment about 6 times and there service is amazing. They gave me a free slice of molten lava cake for my b day and sang to me it was amazing best b day ever!. cant wait for more ribs!!!
Jay C.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,5,1.0,10/26/2012,I placed an order online an got to the Togo desk and waited for a long time to even get anyone to even come over to the desk at help us. It would not be any faster to order online vs at the desk. I'm not happy.
Capitola V.,"Capitola, CA",4,39,3,2.0,10/12/2013,"I don't know what it is about Capitola and chain restaurants, but it seems hard to find consistently good food and service that you find over the hill.  Dining at this Chili's is hit and miss.  We have given it a few tries to see if they have improved, but it doesn't seem so.  We have had slow wait staff, cold food, and wrong drink orders on various visits.  We really enjoyed Chili's while growing up in the bay area, but this location ruins the memories."
rich b.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,14,,2.0,12/24/2011,"Went there for Lunch. Had the half sandwich, BLT, w fries and chili.  The Sandwich was very good. The Fries were way too done and some of the potato inside was Destroyed and Hollow.   The Chili tasted Good but the Cheese in the Chili would  Create a String all the way from the spoon down to the Bowl of Chili.  Very Annoying to eat Chili with Strings of Cheese hanging down from the spoon.  I am Very Surprised to have this experience with a restaurant that's been in business for a number of years and haven't corrected these Faults by now.  However the Waitress was real good, prompt and friendly A Cook working in the back behind the wall can do lots of damage that can counter balance all the good the other staff does."
Eric G.,"Aptos, CA",5,123,5,1.0,1/10/2011,"Once again I sadly found myself at Chili's. Sadly I ordered food. Sadly....they served it.    Ordered the triple dipper and it turned out to be a trifecta of crap.  The mini burgers were 1 half of a regular burger that was splayed across two mini buns. Apparently cutting the half burger so it was 2 mini burgers was too confusing for the kitchen. Also, NOT burning the meat must have been difficult for them too.  The chicken was soggy and rubbery. Nothing crispy about it.  The spinach dip was good but the chips were most definitely left over from, if not last night, at least an earlier table. The server was absolutley amazing and great dealing with our kids, but the food at this place is so consistently horrible that it can only get 1 star."
Aundria P.,"Los Gatos, CA",2,29,,3.0,9/3/2012,"i always get just what i expect!  I wish i could give you guys a 3 and a half stars.  The food is always the same so if your disapointed its your fault for coming back.  I like to eat at the bar,  faster service and better drinks!"
Tom E.,"Felton, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/28/2010,"Chili's food is so good and the service is very efficient; why would anyone go to another restaurant. I have always enjoyed the freshness and the taste of everything; yes everything served in Chili's Restaurants. I told my friends and family how delicious the food is, and they were quite surprised of the quality and the quantity of meals served in these fine restaurants. I will always recommend Chili's Restaurants to all the folk with whom I come in contact."
Marc C.,"CA, CA",43,92,21,3.0,5/24/2011,Every once in while it's time for the classic chain joint! Glad to have it in Capitola! Food as expected from all other Chili's!
King N.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/22/2009,"(written by daughter of ""king"") They have bad fries, but they have good ice cream sundaes. They have good grilled cheese."
Tess F.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,23,,1.0,1/23/2010,"Okay, okay, we all know Chili's as a general rule is filthy food. But served properly to an appreciative audience, it can make for a pleasant early dinner or lunch on the go in a pinch. This particular Chili's is nasty, disappointing in a chain-starved town ( I know, probably a good thing). I have had their corn on the cob served cold more often than hot, and I agree that the dishes just aren't cooked well.  Skip this one--too many good local joints to forgive this poorly prepared stuff."
Carrie L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,17,,4.0,1/1/2012,"My boyfriend and I love to come here after classes for a yummy and cheap meal. We get the endless chips and salsa and two drinks, which makes for a grand total of about $12 for two people. On one occasion one of the waitresses remembered us and brought us extra salsa without even asking :3"
Krista C.,"Redwood City, CA",11,5,,3.0,4/3/2011,Hi so the food came out hot and It was tasty . There was so much food that we are going to have the rest for dinner .  Lot s to choose from and the price was fair to high.
Lori N.,"San Joaquin County, CA",6,29,,4.0,8/1/2009,"Yes Folks, this *is* a Chili's  I have sat in the Bar and the main dining area, always getting exactly what I expect...and sometimes more since there are a few on their crew that are OUTSTANDING, Shannon and Joe being two I can name off the top of my head.   For a Chili's, they are as good if not better than any other I have been in."
Vanessa J.,"Scotts Valley, CA",12,61,,4.0,5/31/2011,After talking to a waiter I found out that you can order any hamburger on the menu and chodse the black bean patty instead.I'm very happy about that!
Marlene E.,"Capitola, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/8/2013,I am surprised by the many negatives about Chili's.  I have been going there about every 3 months since the day they opened the restaurant.  I find everything quite satisfactory about the place.  I've never had bad service and the food has always been very good.  The wait staff is always friendly. Just don't go there at lunch time. Long lines mean good food.
Taylor E.,"San Francisco, CA",141,141,13,1.0,9/10/2007,"""Hi, my name is Alex - in case you need anything or just want someone to yell at."" Interesting introduction... but whatever. Back to more important things!!! What to order, hmmm.... Very briefly scan the ""guiltless"" section of the menu, shake myself back to reality, and focus my attention on the only two sections of the chili's menu worth ever ordering from. Burgers and fajitas, baby! Deciding to be adventurous, I steer away from my usual steak fajitas cadillac style, and opt for the mushroom jack chicken fajitas. Boy, was that a mistake. The food arrives, my mom's 5 minutes before mine, I look at my fajitas and back to the waiter - -  Me: ""But, I ordered the mushroom jack fajitas..."" Alex: ""Oh yea, those are the mushroom jack fajitas, just without the mushrooms."" (As if that is completely normal) Me: ""Um, yes, and the Jack... and the mushroom jack fajitas come with chicken, there is half chicken and half steak here. Kinda had my heart set on those mushrooms too."" Alex: ""No, the mushroom jack fajitas come with both chicken and steak."" (Silently grab a menu, open it, and point to where under Mushroom Jack Fajitas it says CHICKEN! There is no mention of steak.) Alex: ""Oh, well, it would take a really long time to cook the whole thing over again, and I can see that your mom is already halfway threw her meal... so why don't I just fix the mushroom jack part for you."" Me: ""Fine, whatever."" (Alex returns with a plate of mushrooms and cold jack cheese) Me: ""Really? Isn't it supposed to be melted over the top of the meat?"" Alex: ""Well yea, normally, but that would take a long time."" Me: (Restraining myself from jumping over the table and strangling this asshole) ""Okay, I think I can afford that kind of time."" (Alex takes my plate away with a serious attitude. Did this guy's boyfriend just break up with him or is he simply the worst waiter to ever serve a table? He comes back 2 minutes later with my half ass melted cheese fajitas. Decide it's not worth battling anymore over and say thank you.) Plow through my cold mediocre fajitas (extremely disappointed, they are usually so good!) because I am seriously famished by this point. Alex had been ignoring us during this time, thank god, but then he dropped in for his finale - - abruptly bursting out with ""Am I annoying you yet? Because I can get really annoying."" Me: (Outloud) ""No, can we please have our check."" (In my head) ""How did you ever become a waiter and how have you not been fired yet?"" Needless to say - I won't be back anytime soon."
J S.,"Scotts Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/21/2013,"Terrible!!! We went to have an early lunch today, we were the first family there and other people came in after us and got their food, while we waited 45 minutes and NEVER got our food! Service was horrible and it was so dirty and dusty, table was sticky! I'm never going there again, we walked out with our kids still starving and all they could tell us that it will be out in a few minutes!"
Kelsey C.,"Fremont, CA",1,11,4,5.0,4/12/2010,It's Chili's. What is there to complain about?! Love it love it love it. Food is always hot. Service is always fast. Awesome place to eat day or night.
Brittany N.,"Bozeman, MT",206,374,61,5.0,5/13/2010,"Okay, I have a confession -- I LOVE Chili's. There's almost no chain restaurants in Santa Cruz (which I actually really like about Santa Cruz), but there is Chili's and Woody and I would make a point of coming here way too often. Whenever we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat, we usually seemed to end up at Chili's. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating - I mean, we went so often that we had favorite spots that we liked to sit and if they tried to sit us somewhere else and we asked to wait for a table in a ""better section"" they always accommodated us and never gave us any attitude about it. They have lots of yummy drinks from the bar and tons of great appetizers and meal specials. We would usually end up ordering too much because we just love everything on the menu! It's obviously not that healthy, but if you're going to splurge then I recommend Chili's :]"
lysa l.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,29,3.0,7/1/2011,"I like  the food at Chili's but the service has always been mediocre at best. We recently received superb service from a server that I think was named Josh B.  He told us that he had worked for Chili's before and that he had just been back on the job for only a few weeks.  We had a large party of ten people and we were there celebrating a birthday party.  Our group was not an easy table.  Constant requests for drink refills etc, keep poor Josh on his toes.  He kept everything in check, brought everything that we requested and did it with a smile.  Hands down, he gave us the best service that we have ever received since opening day at Chili's.  If I could rate Josh B and the job that he did, I would give him 5 stars."
