Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,2.0,2/23/2007,"The times I have been there the wait hasn't been too long (tonight it was 10 min). The waitress took a few minutes but was totally pleasant and checked up on us twice, and refilled without question. The food came out with in twenty minutes or so and the steamed broccoli was perfect (not gross and mushy) and the chicken wasn't half bad... not a favorite place to go...but after shopping at Capitola Mall it is by default"
Florence D.,"Oakland, CA",83,123,7,2.0,5/13/2008,"After being famished at 10pm in Santa Cruz on a Friday night, I realized the only chain restaurant in the area is Chili's (trust me, when you don't get to eat at chains very often, you sometimes crave it. It's not weird, trust me.)  I'll give them that we came sort of close to closing (11pm..) but we had to ask about 4 times for water after seeing our server bring drinks to another table who arrived AFTER we did. We also had to ask another server for silverware and napkins.  Finally the drinks and appetizers arrive!...but to my dismay the nachos we ordered were more like a symmetrical artwork on a plate. Each individual chip was covered in a precise layer of beans and cheese, with a scoop of guac and sour cream in the middle of this intricate work. Oh, and each chip had one slice of a jalapeo.   Sacrifice: quality of food/service for satisfying late night pangs of hunger that, in any other place other than Santa Cruz, you could pacify quite quickly."
Ash S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,14,,3.0,1/14/2013,me and chili's have a love/ hate reltaionship... let me start by saying the Texas cheese fries are AMAZING!!!! sometimes i go there and get amazing service and hot yummy food.

Coupon F.,"Sparks, NV",0,34,3,1.0,2/26/2011,"I received a coupon from there website for a FREE Queso dip, chips and beef or something worth about 4.99. The coupon said FREE, it did not specify ""you must buy an entree"". Yeah it might be a little cheap to just get a free appetizer to-go but I gave your corporation my personal information in exchange for a coupon.  The hostess was nice, but the person working at the to-go register was very rude. If your planning on using Chili's coupons they are not valid at this establishment and you should avoid using them here."
Annie P.,"San Francisco, CA",177,143,138,2.0,2/23/2010,"Its chilli's, so you get american/mexican food. Eveyrtime I go they always sit me in the back and with the slow server who chats with every table for a millions years except mine. I like their nachos and also the southwest salad. Its your average non fastfood but still kind of fast foody type of place."
Farrah B.,"West Oakland, Oakland, CA",57,55,,2.0,3/3/2009,"I normally don't waste my time reviewing chain restaurants unless they are really bad...so here we go...The relationship started off great, she was loving and attentive. She thought my special requests were quirky but cute. Drinks arrived and our hands brushed as she handed me my extra napkins. We saw each other again; she presented me with cold half-filled bowl of chili and the check before I could order my second drink.. I knew things were heading south. We grew distant, only seeing each other in passing. She avoided eye contact. I flagged her down to request more, she said she would be there, she wasn't. Out final meeting was awkward; it was like I had to pay for her attention, like a whore. I walked away feeling dirty and used. I found myself wanting to leave her tips on how to be a better lover, but in the end she got none."
Julia C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,2,1,4.0,7/27/2009,"I actually prefer sitting at the bar area on the tall tables with tall chairs at this Chillis because the other section where you sit in booths is really loud. I love the chips and salsa, overall its a pretty good chillis"
Chris D.,"Dublin, CA",14,105,2,4.0,8/21/2009,Always good!  I love the Big Mouth bites (no In'N-Out but good) or the grilled chicken sandwich with honey mustard.  The kids love the ribs.  It's a good safe family dinner.
Casey G.,"Aptos, CA",10,5,,4.0,5/7/2009,"I love this restaurant. Always a fun atmosphere. Service is reliable 95% of the time, with good food and always cold beer. In my few years of going here I've only had 1-2 bad instances where the manager didn't handle the situation appropriately (another customer complaining about the noise because she was trying to read and the manager asked us to be quieter..??? We weren't even being loud.. Other than that I've never really had any issues."
Ronnie A.,"Watsonville, CA",0,12,3,2.0,10/15/2009,"Ugggh! This Chili's is not what I remember it to be, seriously I was expecting much, much more!! I havent been to the Capitola Mall in years but didnt think much would have changed-- I was wrong!  A friend and I decided to swing by here for a quick bite to eat, I much prefer Chili's to Applebees. Anyway, we get seated right away by the hostess who leaves us menus and tells us that our waiter would be with us shortly. The menus were sticky and had gunk on them. Yuck! Our server Alex came over to take our drink orders within a few minutes and everything seemed OK til I noticed the silverware-- it still had leftover food on them, needless to say we didnt use them.  We decided to try the 2 for $20 meal and decided to go with the Skillet Queso which surprisingly wasnt bad and they gave us plenty of tortilla chips!!  For our entrees we had a bacon cheeseburger and an Old Timer w/Cheese, pretty simple, right? When the food arrived I couldnt help but notice how sloppily it was put together, the meat on the burger was practically falling apart and the bread was a little soggy from the juice of the jalapenos that they put on top of the garnishes-- I didnt ask for them, in fact I dont like them! I asked Alex if he could bring me some mayo and my friend needed a refill and he his response was sure, no problem-- 20 minutes later he finally shows up with the refill but said he forgot the mayo by that time I was already half way through my burger.  I'm not necessarily ready to cross out Chili's from my favorites but I highly doubt that I'll be coming back to this one anytime soon. I'll stick to the one in Gilroy.. but come to think of it I havent been to that one in a while either. Hmmm! Think twice the next time you choose this particular establishment!!"
Lizi B.,"Washington, DC",9,63,3,4.0,2/18/2009,"This place satisfies a certain craving...for cheap chips and salsa and some chicken club tacos.  There were a few times that I have received some mystery product in my food and it was pretty weird and gross.  I ordered to go from there once at the little window thing and it was a salad, with dressing being a crucial ingredient.  I got my food and there was no dressing whatsoever.  Arghh!!!  Then again, on my 21st birthday they gave me both a free milkshake and a free dessert shot thing, it was great!  Our servers have always been really friendly, we have received free beers and free diet cokes.  The best part is the chips which are always warm and delicious, save one time when they were cold and one when they didn't have any at all.  The strawberry daquiri is pretty cheap and delicious and I definitely recommend the chicken club tacos.  Basically, I'm oddly addicted to this place."
Tracey W.,"Alameda, CA",58,189,29,3.0,9/18/2007,You know what? I don't care if it is  a goddamn chain. It's the only place in the mall to get a drink. End of story.
Allison O.,"Soquel, CA",0,123,,3.0,7/23/2011,"it's the only real chain style tex/mex sit-down restaurant in sc, which is why i think it appeals to so many. the quality is average. the prices are a bit high, and the service is a-okay. my experiences here, and there's been plenty, are always the same. food is edible for sure, but once you look at the nutrition info, you'll wish you would have stayed away from the food all together. if you need a fast, quick bite to eat while in capitola, chili's is a good spot."
bob j.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,2,,2.0,7/11/2009,"I went here for the first time and ordered the buffalo chicken wings. The food came out a little longer than what i would consider timely fashion. When I bit into the first wing, the thing was soooo salty I almost died. Every bite i took, i had to take a drink of water because it was so spicy from the salt. I ordered the old fashioned burger as a replacement which was pretty good.  The service was alright but i wouldn't go here again. The carls jr. next door is a better place."
Lisa Ann P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",70,109,3,3.0,2/23/2008,"It has a bar, and it usually has the sports channels on, and they have awesome blossoms, and nachos! so what more could you ask for in a shopping mall!"
andrew w.,"San Francisco, CA",9,9,,4.0,12/20/2010,This Chili's is better than the other Chili's restaurants I have been to.  The service at this one is great and they always cook my burger the way I like it (rare).  The drinks are good but are a little too sweet for my taste and would like it if they didn't skimp on the alcohol.  It also sucks that they no longer have the Smokehouse Bacon Triple-The-Cheese Big Mouth Burger  anymore but the Jalapeno Smokehouse Bacon Burger is still good.
Richard H.,"Daly City, CA",26,195,14,2.0,11/16/2004,"About what you would expect: trendy, mediocre food; perky, yet slightly incompetent service; about as ethnic as mayonaise on Wonder bread."
Ann M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,43,8,4.0,3/3/2007,Chili's has great chips and salsa and is one of the few places in Capitola where you can get them.  They vary their menu often and the food is usually hot and filling.  The wait staff is very friendly unless they are way too busy which usually happens at the late dinner time especially on weekends.  Chili's is very family friendly and yet the service is usually prompt.  I agree with the previous reviewer about the perfect broccoli.
Quincy J.,"Sausalito, CA",0,11,,3.0,2/16/2008,"the bottomless chips and salsa are a really great way to wait for your food.....i know it says they cost 3 dollars on the menu, but of all the times i've been to chili's and ordered them i havent been charged! great! BIG drinks, stay away from the gold tequila margaritas (unless you are looking to get drunk) cause they are STRONG! the chicken taco's are real good but make sure to ask for sour cream on the side...i like their chicken fajitas (they're pretty avg. like chevy's---NOT TOO SPECIAL).  sometimes the waiters can be ass holes and rude, but if you think about it....you go there for the food, not the service so you can always lower their tip :) woops!"
D W.,"Daly City, CA",11,75,,4.0,4/18/2009,i really like this place even though it's a chain.  i can always find something pretty tasty here.  good variety.  reasonably priced.  their dishes are huge and they have a full bar.  what more can you ask for?
