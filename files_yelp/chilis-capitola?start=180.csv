Ana O.,"Citrus Heights, CA",43,16,,4.0,7/30/2007,"So this Chili's has its up and downs. Its crowded and there is a long wait if you are there during the weekends, BUT Im writting this review based on my expereince there on a weekday in the evening. Met up at Chilis for drinks with some friends. Quickly found a table in the bar section. Our waitress was prompt and had a cheery personality. I was still in the mood for food so I had their Shanghi chicken. Sauce was a bit too thick but otherwise worked well with our drinks. Always order a Jamaican Paradise when Im at Chili's. Nice blend of everything and it always seems that by the time im 3/4 of the way done with the first drink im so much happier to be there and ready for another drink. We spent about 3hrs at our table, just chitchatting and venting (work). What was great was that we were never rushed our waiter (by this time or original waitress had gone home already) was full of laughs and had all of us laughing as he tried new ways to get us to order more drinks. Overall a great exprerince. Will definetly look to go back during the evening weekdays when the staff is relaxed and you can sit and enjoy some quality time with friends"
