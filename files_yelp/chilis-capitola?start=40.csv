C S.,"Sacramento, CA",230,69,41,1.0,10/5/2016,"This place is DISGUSTING. The food is GMO microwaved junk. Practically everything from the menu is microwaved! The facility is infested with pests and termites. If you take a look in the back where the kitchen is located, you will see a wet slippery food filled floor. Where the hallway is from the bathroom to the kitchen, take a good look at the wall. Filled with stains and wall peel from the lack of sanitary requirements. The one star for the employees who chose to be loyal to this dump. I hope they close down this facility!"
Tim W.,"San Francisco, CA",83,3,,5.0,11/22/2016,Food was pretty decent standard Chili's food however one of the servers was phenomenal her name was Haley really good vibes enjoyed the atmosphere a lot played some trivia games with my sweetheart life is good.
Leslie P.,"Cupertino, CA",84,24,,1.0,10/16/2016,"This place is the slowest restaurant I've been to in a long time. The server greeted us and sat us down but no came to take our order or ask to get started on drinks. We sat there for 25 mins. As we left, the server didn't bother to ask or care that we were leaving due to horrible service. Thanks for nothing Chili's. Pretty disappointing and won't come back anymore."
George M.,"Aptos, CA",16,35,,1.0,3/15/2017,"What a difference seven years can bring. We had a late lunch on a Saturday about 3:00. We ordered chips and salsa. The chips were so salty, we sent them back. The next bowl was no better. My wife's salad came and it looked like it sat around from the day before. My onion rings were over cooked. Our server was very cordial. She said she would get the manager. We declined, knowing the history of Chili's treatment of customers.We doubt we'll return here. The bathroom was pretty filthy, the kitchen didn't look much better. The Capitola Mall is in dire straits. The food court is down to Subway and a Korean lunchette. Even Hot Dog on a Stick has disappeared. I hope the new owners consider changes for food options. Chili's was once a fun place to eat. It's now simply a fast food place. It needs a face lift or a new eatery."
Janice T.,"Hercules, CA",224,589,2832,4.0,10/18/2013,"Hubby and I went for a late lunch on a weekday.  Our server, Denise, provided excellent service.  She was friendly and efficient.   We started with some chili which my husband absolutely loves.  For our main meal, he ordered the Santa Fe salad while I ordered the Bacon Jack Grilled Chicken.  We both enjoyed our meals.  However, my favorite part was our dessert of chocolate peanut butter molten cake.  It wasn't as sweet as I imagined it to be (which was a good thing).   We are looking forward to dining here again."
Josh P.,"Freedom, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Chilies in the Capitola mall overcharges my credit card by $25, now I have to waste time fighting with my credit card company..."
West B.,"Ben Lomond, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/10/2016,"Two years ago, I vowed I would never come back to this location. Unfortunately, a year ago, I forgot that promise to myself. But I'm still going strong. I'm a fan of the Chili's menu, and there are some great employees, but I haven't had a truly positive experience at this location in about 4 or 5 years. Whether it is a matter of a lack of service or bad food being sent out, this location has been mismanaged for quite some time. Let me know when that changes."
Regina S.,"Capitola, CA",2,46,,2.0,6/13/2016,"Not really a fan of their food. If you love nachos, don't get the nachos. They serve about 8 chips and make them each into an individual nacho bite. The drinks are good and the service is good, but the food is lacking. Just tastes old and underwhelming."
Cassie B.,"Watsonville, CA",0,9,6,5.0,4/5/2015,Great food. great price. friendly staff. clean restaurant. Yum!  I would hope the managers are paying their staff time and a half to be working on Easter Sunday...
Jackiee M.,"Capitola, CA",233,3,3,5.0,12/24/2015,First time here yet lived here for over a decade. (I know what wrong with me?!) Chilis onion rings are the bomb diggity!! Definitely coming back!
Jessie W.,"Grandville, MI",0,5,,2.0,5/12/2016,"Chili's food was good. Service was odd though. Salad came out about 1 minute before the main course. Also, waitress was loud and asked if I wanted any ""margs"", I had no idea what that meant. Just an odd place."
Barbara S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",21,9,,1.0,5/9/2016,Going down hill VERY fast. Kept getting emails reminding me my points were expiring and come in for a free birthday dessert. Go in and NONE of the Ziosk tablets were working. Couldn't redeem points. The food is mediocre at best anyways. The restaurant looks worn down and I predict this location will close. Good!
Lauren K.,"San Francisco, CA",390,553,2093,3.0,5/28/2012,"YES  YES YES FOR HAPPY HOUR! Free chips, awesome drinks, great service. Service IS on the slower side but they are SUPER friendly! Water tasted a bit funky."
Dama P.,"Oceanside, CA",23,17,3,1.0,3/22/2016,"The worst experience ever at a chili location!!!  I work right down the street from chilis and normally it's been a great experience but today was the worst day to eat at this restaurant.  My partner and I both order the sirloins, the food tasted over cooked with no flavor!!! HORRIBLE!!! The brocoli was even over cooked , who messes broccoli up!!! The sirloins steaks were extremely small looked like a 2oz instead of a 6oz ( I even have pictures to prove it) . The worse part of it was that after we spoke to the manager about it he said he would compensate our meals and admitted that a new cook was not properly cooking the food.  He only had a small portion of the meal compensated!!!  My partner was very upset and even asked the manager for a beer and never received it then we see the manager just laughing chatting with Other employees. I cant believe that a manager knowing that a customer is upset with the food  and service would prolong getting them a drink or making their experince more pleasant. I manage a company myself and never would I ever not take care of an unsatisfied customer that brings business to my company!! I can honestly say that I will no longer  be visiting or eating at ANY chilis restaurant EVER!!! I will definitely share my experience with every person I know and ever meet about this horrible experience!!"
Dawn H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",116,26,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Firstly, the service was great. Crystal (I think - I had to call to check who was serving the bar so I could write this - Kim answered the phone and was bubbly and pleasant, by the way) was very likable and timely and great. Nothing that happened was her fault. I wish i had more cash to leave her at the end, because I know what it's like to have my tips suffer due to crap cooking and management. Chili's had pretty much lost us as customers due to so many horrible experiences and food issues. But we tried again, and they had made such fabulous changes to the menu - even little tablets at the tables for games and payment - just great! New menu items seemed pretty good so we've gone back a few times in the last few months. Too good to be true? Unfortunately, yes.  My sirloin/avocado dish was great - cooked medium rare like i requested. my boyfriend's (contrary to what we initially thought at first cut, as the manager did actually ask us to check before he left the steaks with us, which was nice - too bad we didn't notice right away...it was obviously not medium rare but it looked bearable at first) was medium well, almost well.  whoops, our bad, we didn't notice right away. but no, this was NOT anywhere near medium rare. server does the right thing and brings out a little plate to take the steak and not the whole meal.  A medium rare steak simply doesn't take long. and we were willing to be totally content if the new one came out right....or even close to right.  so we wait. and wait. and get more drinks. and wait. two steaks walk right by us. same kind as he ordered.....they had CLEARLY been put on the fire long after we sent the steak back. That is unacceptable. Our replacement steak should have been priority. So i am eating super slowly and trying to get my bf to share my steak so he can enjoy his dinner. he had a few pieces, but by now his potatoes and broccoli are ice cold. We saw our server trying to get the new steak from the cooks and manager multiple times. She never lost sight of the dilemma. Finally, she brings us a replacement and asked us to check it (looking nervous) - honestly you could SEE it was almost well-done. way too firm. Sure enough, it was WORSE than the first. Unbelievable.... So at this point we're just over it - bf doesn't want to wait anymore. So basically our entire meal was ruined.  I am WELL versed in corporate restaurant protocol for unhappy patrons, particularly when it was due to a restaurant screwup. Both meals should have come off the bill at the VERY LEAST. I am willing to pay for my bar tab, however. That I can understand. Crystal (who is totally stuck under that management thumb since she has to wait for them to void things - ugh I don't miss that frustration) is of course apologetic and brings our bill, which only has his meal taken off.  She tells us the manager will be over to speak with us. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And he does come over to the bar to do something but on his way back past us I said ""whoa whoa "" and he turns, looks at me (full eye contact and irritated look!) and turns and walks briskly away. Purposefully. (this is when i decide that infuriated yelping will be in my immediate future) I didn't catch the manager's name, but apparently it was either James or Mario (like I said, I called the front desk to find out who I had dealt with and there were two managers on duty. For what it's worth, this one was dark hair, bigger dude. Not much to go on there) So we do something I NEVER DO. We scrounge for cash for a decent tip and left only money for the bar tab. I wrote a note on the tab and talked to the server, making sure she wouldn't get screwed if we did this. Normally the only recourse a patron has is to punish the server, but she had been wonderful, and done all she could do. I watched her try to remedy the trainwreck. And for us to pay for my meal basically does not bring consequences to the (lack of) management.  Like I said, I know corporate restaurant policy, and in this instance, we should AT LEAST not have been charged for food. Simply removing a meal that never got served is not enough. BOTH of our experiences were ruined, and you can BET I am gonna tell the world. If the manager had just done the right thing, or at least acknowledged our presence, I may have let it fly.  They were not THAT crazed, just a mild Sat night. Normal night for a mall restaurant. There were two managers on duty. We were served leather twice. In an untimely manner. With no management contact after the fact.  My LORDY they need better management. Or to retrain the angry bub. That was a completely avoidable sequence of events. I feel terrible for the servers that have to bust their ass under that kind of non-supportive misled management. Their tips will suffer when average patrons don't know where to lay the proper blame. I loved my food, and was excited to find a new favorite I could hopefully count on. But I doubt we will go back now. So that's lame."
Michael N.,"San Jose, CA",106,651,106,4.0,12/31/2014,"I came here with my kids and family after a very long day at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.  This was one of the hottest days we have encounters at the beach area is was well above 95 degrees this day.  Also it was a World Series Game San Francisco vs. Kansas City, maybe not a good night to bring a medium size group.   You know we were surprised we only had to wait 10 minute for a table to fit us all, which was great, of course the kids were now starving when 10 minutes ago they were fine.  The waitress was very quick at getting some food on the table for my kids and having the drink order arrive just as fast.   The food quality if what you can expect, but it was one of my sons birthday and the staff made it extra special and of course the San Francisco Giants won that night too.  The staff was excellent and the food was good and the drink cold, honestly I do not see the reason for the negative reviews of this location, we had a very good experience here and will return when we are in the area again."
Clarity C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",90,31,5,4.0,5/21/2015,"Alex is rad! Came in to watch the game and grab some food, very attentive and friendly. Great burgers, awesome drinks. Def. coming back soon"
Arizvett R.,"Watsonville, CA",0,4,1,2.0,3/30/2016,"I went to chilis about a month ago to celebrate my little sisters birthday and the hostess who greeted us was rude. To me, the hostess is the one who sets the vibe because it the first person you see. Luckily our server was super nice."
Brent H.,"Felton, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/28/2016,Wife had a prime rib which was the worst she had ever had in any restaurant bar none. Horrible. My six ounce steak was maybe a notch better but certainly also nothing to brag about. The one star we did give was for good service. This place won't see us again
Jack L.,"Union City, CA",18,348,23,4.0,2/18/2013,"Dear Food Inspector, They definitely follow the food safety rules here.  We ordered a steak that was undercooked, and asked that they throw the steak back on the grill for 2 minutes.  Instead, they cooked us a new steak because per regulation, items that a patron has touched cannot go back onto the grill.   By the way, the steak came back perfectly the second time."
