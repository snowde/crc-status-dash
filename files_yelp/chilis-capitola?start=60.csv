Ricardo R.,"Merced, CA",0,5,,3.0,12/7/2015,Food is good. The service needs work tho. Food takes to long to come out & staff isint the friendliest
Jessica W.,"Watsonville, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/5/2015,"We waited 45 minutes to be seated. Ordered 2 appetizers they came out one at a time 10 minutes apart both cold. Our dinners came out their were five of them two came out ice cold, one of my kids ate his cold dinner cause he was so hungry. We then waited 10 minutes for the other dinner to come back like warm. The veggies on all three fajita plates were barely cooked and the shrimp were not seasoned and slimy. For all of this we were given 15 dollars in gift cards to use at this horrible place again."
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,2.0,7/10/2015,"Came here for Happy Hour and got some simple chips, salsa, queso in the bar area.Yum. Was very busy. Wish the waitress was more attentive. She was MIA most of the hour we stayed, enjoyed the food though and glad we picked up wifi from nearby Starbucks. Always disappointed that Chili's itself has no free wifi for patrons. Also. Be careful with your monetary change after paying...some waitresses don't give you back the change your due. As if! Down a star for that."
Rebekah K.,"Antioch, CA",218,104,93,4.0,1/18/2015,"Our server Katie was awesome! Super attentive & friendly. She made the experience great!  We got to 2 for $20. The appetizer we chose was Texas cheese fries, yummy yum yum.  Food came out quickly. And Katie made sure drinks didn't stay empty. :) she was quick to get us napkins, more ranch and make sure food was on point.  I got the grilled chicken salad. It was alright, nothing special. But still good. The chicken was cooked really well. My dad got the margarita chicken, which is definitely what I'll be getting next time."
Rob K.,"Oakley, CA",5,9,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"When I arrived, the bartender was wonderful, my drink was never close to empty before she asked if I was ready for another. Her shift ended and Alex's shift began. Not once did Alex even look at me, he saw my glass was empty, which it had been for 15 mins, and he took the glass to wash it, still not asking me if I wanted a drink. I sat at the bar for well over 30 mins without 1 word being spoken to me. I will never be back to this chilis location. Alex is a horrible bartender and chilis needs to think about his replacement sooner than later."
Hal S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/18/2015,We came here to celebrate a grandchild's birthday. We had 3 grandchildren and 4 adults. We had to wait over an hour to receive our order. The reason we did not walk out was not to cause a negative impact  for the child's birthday vibe. We were so proud of the children's patience. I will never be back again. Our server was apologetic and even went in the kitchen to help expedite our order. To no avail.
Ailene T.,"Aptos, CA",0,7,2,1.0,6/29/2014,"If only I can give zero star. This place is disgusting, at least from our last visit. My husband and I use to like this place because it's place and who doesn't like the bar. We were here almost every weekend but our last visit was a different story. I ordered Buffalo wings for my appetizer and have to returned because it has some black specie included. We have an awesome waiter so I remained calm. He returned and gave me (maybe the same plate and he just took out that specie) the same order. The food taste disgusting. It's like they only reheated the food for 30sec and you read it right. REHEATED!  My husband finished his burger and I never bother to get anything and left the food. We never came back and will never come back ever, to any Chili's. There's a lot of other options served by the locals and we are definitely convinced that Chili's is a waste of money."
Professor P.,"Felton, CA",1,20,,1.0,3/14/2015,"Had lunch today at Chili's in Capitola on 41st Ave.  Hadn't been to a Chili's since the 1990s and my memory of the food they served back then was that it was pretty good for a corporate chain.  Boy has it gone down hill!  First off, the margarita they served me was the most godawful concoction I've ever tasted.  One step above antifreeze.  (A tip off that this was going to be a bad experience: no prices are listed on the menu for drinks.) Second, my wife's silverware was dirty and  had to be replaced; thirdly,  our water had a funky aftertaste reminiscent of old dishwater.  Finally, after a long wait, our entrees appeared (chicken tacos).   The chicken was barely warm, way too salty, and tasted like cat food. (Oh, and the accompanying beans and rice  were tasteless, cold, and looked like they came right out of a can.)   And for this gastronomical disaster we had the privilege of paying $32.00. Never again, Chili's, never again. Oh and btw: the fancy new menus are replete with full color spreads of scrumptious looking food--don't you believe it!!  What you see and what you get are as different as night and day."
Ryan D.,"Aptos, CA",13,2,2,5.0,4/10/2015,I love happy hour!! Good food!! I get 2 for 20 just for my self cause I'm a fat as lol
Robert F.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,82,,2.0,1/19/2014,"To go order placed right after the Niners lost and we were depressed and wanted mediocre food to soothe our sadness.   Placed the order on their site and it was submitted at 6:51 with a indicated pick-up time of 7:21.  Half an hour seems more than reasonable to cook our sandwich and fajitas.  Well arrived at 7:20 and paid at 7:29 and then proceeded to wait until 7:41 to get the food.   Pretty pissed to wait an additional 20 minutes to get an order that was ""ready"" at 7:21.  I would have walked away from the order, but made the mistake of paying before I received the food.  I don't recommend Chili's to go. Two stars cuz the gal working the to-go area was super nice and apologetic for the delay even though it was not even remotely her fault."
James B.,"Atlanta, GA",80,70,40,1.0,12/21/2014,"I went with my family to this place and let me say what a waste of time! We got seated immediately which was awesome, but just to get our waitress took about 20 minutes. By the time she got there we went ahead order our drinks and food. We got the chips and salsa as an appetizer which took us another 20 minutes. When we said something about it we just kept getting a ""they will be right out"" by the time we got those we waited another 30 minutes until we got our food. And because we waited so long we just getting refills on our chips and started getting full on that. we got the food and it was extremely cold and overly salted. But we could never find the waitress to get our refills and when we'd try flagging down the manager he would say he'd be right with us but never showed back up. Finally after what seemed like an eternity our waitress came dropped off the check and just disappeared all over again. Because you pay at the machine with a card we never seen her again. We were all pretty pissed never got refills nor got the chance to speak to a manager. We just kept getting ignored. Just complete crap business.  It was a waste of my time and money I should have went to the food court or somewhere else. Complete disappointment!!"
Gene K.,"San Jose, CA",12,26,3,4.0,10/20/2012,"My wife and I went in on during dinner time on a Saturday night. Sure enough, it was pretty crowded. But the wait was only 15 minutes, or so the hostess said. I don't know because when it gets busy like that, we just go to the bar area and grab ourselves a seat You are served just the same as the regular dining area with even the same menu. However the hostess made a mistake in telling us that it was happy hour. We found out after our bill arrived that she was in fact mistaken since happy hours aren't on Saturdays. The ambiance was typical loud on a Saturday night. I ordered the half rack of ribs and the salmon filet. To my surprise, the salmon was seasoned just right, and was cooked well too, not dry at all.  My wife had the mushroom burger, and she really enjoyed her burger. She said it was juicy and flavorful and quite hearty. You can't ask for much more from a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive, and got us drinks and appetizer fast. All in all, an enjoyable dining experience."
Sunday C.,"Capitola, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/12/2015,"Yesterday afternoon my family and I went to Chili's for lunch.  I wish I could say something nice about our experience. I will say that this is the first time the food and the service was horrible.  Everyone's food was either lukewarm or cold.  My daughter was the only one who sent her food back because it was not only cold but didn't taste good.  My ribs were undercooked but I took them home to put in the oven to finish cooking.  One of my grandson's steak was nothing but fatty meat, cold, and overcooked.  My other grandson's burger was cold in the middle.  Our waitress seems to not understand anything we asked for, so we had to ask for something four to five times. I didn't ask for a manager because I was so frustrated and she didn't seem concerned. I will eventually go back but it will be a little while. I am hoping it was just an off day for the staff. We did notice that other people were also having issues. I was wondering what happened to the manager that day because someone usually walks around asking how everything was going. Nothing. Thank goodness for the chips and salsa."
Brandon L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/7/2016,"My family and I come here a lot to have dinner but this time we ordered takeout because my wife is pregnant and not feeling as best as usual. I go to pick up the food at 10:01 pm I thought they closed at 11:00 pm. I asked for my order than the manager on duty named arroya I believe .she said "" we threw your food away already I called 20 min ago twice and left a message"" than I asked her you sure you called at 9:45 because I just left my house 2 min ago and we didn't get no phone call. I called my wife she said there was a missed call at 9:59 from them not 9:45 ,Than Arroya says that I wasn't even suppose to come in after 10 because her employees safety was at risk, even though the whole restaurant was packed with customers still getting served there dinner. I was kinda shocked when she said ""you never know now a days about people we have a lot of money here we can get robbed by anybody. Luckily for the manager my son was there because i was furious and wanted to go off on the manager for profile me as a ""robber"". Not professional at all."

Mary C.,"Monterey, CA",60,226,13,3.0,12/22/2013,"Food is okay. Slow service. Waiter did a good job.  I came with my brother, but not a place for me."
Paul G.,"Pescadero, CA",18,293,4,2.0,10/23/2014,"I have been here a couple of times, why I never checked in, is beyond me.  There are not too many ""chain"" places in Santa Cruz, for what ever reason, this community really does not like them, but generally you go to these places, because you already know what to expect as far as the menu.  They are really trying hard as a corporation to stay afloat, and I do not see them here for long.  They have new menu changes, and a lot of things that do not look appetizing and they have gotten rid of a lot of the classics, which is too bad.  The food was alright, nothing to write home to mom about, the portions have gotten smaller, and our server was very young and inexperienced, and in my opinion really needs more training.  She brought drinks with no straws, she did not come back to see if the food met our expectations, and when we paid our bill, (we paid with cash), she never brought our change, and when we asked about it, she thought it was a tip, the change was over 10 bucks.  That large of a tip would have been over 33% of the total bill, sorry, she did not deserve this.. It is all about attention to detail,  and she unfortunately missed the mark on this one"
Vivian J.,"Campbell, CA",156,491,18,4.0,11/8/2013,"Where do  you go when you have two starving 16 month olds in a car for over an hour?  Yep Chili's since you know if will be quick and they have a kids menu!!  We were seated in 5 minutes and within 15 minutes we all had food.  The girls inhaled their chicken breast,steamed broccoli and some of my dinner in 20 minutes!  Soon they were happy again and so were we!  My chicken tacos were tasty and my hubby enjoyed his chicken as well.  Prices were reasonable and service was good!  We will be back if we are in the area again!"
Anne S.,"Merced, CA",39,389,33,5.0,1/15/2015,"Our very first Chili's. My notes only say ""Yum, yum, yum."" Wish we had one in our town~~~"
Reggie M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",23,18,1,5.0,11/30/2014,"Good service and great food, I love the new gormet burgers and the nachos are genius! Each chip has every topping painstakingly prepared, even seasoning!"
