Amanda G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,18,4,1.0,12/19/2014,"Our server, Sherry was awesome and deserves 5 stars but this review is for the food. We ordered pickle chips. They were not fried hardly at all, very soggy and extremely salty. Almost inedible they were so salty. The pickle chips were new and they were one of the main reasons we went, so that was disappointing. My spicy shrimp tacos had cold hard tortillas. Not good. Not the best experience. $35 was not worth it."
Jon Z.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/7/2014,"Have given then several chances and every time they fail miserably. Service sucks, wait staff complete idiots, the manager shouldn't  be  one one time when we were there we had an issue asked for the manager we watched our waiter tell him and he shook his head and walked into the back  and never came and helped us. chili's is a sad excuse for a resturaunt"
Lee O.,"Santa Cruz, CA",16,293,12,3.0,8/25/2014,We got tired of the happy hour food but still go for the 2 for $20.00 or the quesadilla explosion salad (which used to be on the 2 for 20 but was removed). One new item I like on the 2 for 20 is the fajitas. They give you 3 tortillas and the meat then a condiment tree so you can customize each one. I think its fun. You can still get free chips and salsa during happy hour in the bar if you ask. Bud light pints are $3. When you sign up for the email club they send you coupons every week for a free app or dessert. We always leave full.
Benji M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",96,4,,1.0,1/28/2013,"this review is only based on the customer service tonight around 9:30. There is nothing bad about the food, the food actually looked interesting and good to me when we looked at the menu. Ok, let's get started. We were sitting by our waitor and soon asked if we could order anything. We said we needed more time and he left. Then we looked at the menu over and over again and even carefully read the description of each item for over 10 minutes, the waitor didn't show up. Soon we found out he seemed to have a very happy conversation with the kitchen staff. We decided to leave since we didn't feel like we were in a restaurant.  Never go back. Thank you for sitting us down, but that's it, nothing else."
Garrett D.,"Ben Lomond, CA",10,25,,5.0,6/4/2015,I work there it's an awesome place to be working at pulse I know a lot of people there I love it there in Capitola
Kalina P.,"San Jose, CA",52,34,6,1.0,8/13/2016,"Stay away! thought this place had redeeming features but I was wrong. Food comes out consistently lukewarm usually missing the sides n condiments for 5  minutes  if it comes at all. appetizers are getting more expensive and smaller, drinks  barely a shot in each and so much sugar/juice you can't stomach more than one. guy servers are either absent and socializing with their co workers /friends or they're bugging me to take surveys n do everything on the touch screen but they still expect gratuity?? The girl servers seem to do all the work and are running around the restaurant looking sweaty and pissed off. it's clearly poorly managed. On that note managers have failed to really fix mistakes, they'll talk your ear off full of excuses but delivery falls short each time. Overheard Michelle and Arya both complaining and insulting customers when there was a problem as soon as their back was turned. Really? You call that service ?? Save your money and go elsewhere, literally anywhere else and actually support a local business while you're at it."
Kat T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,10,1,1.0,6/28/2014,"We ordered take out, my coworker bought a steak and sweat potato fries 17$! Holy cow! We got back to the office and the fries were cold and soggy, and the veggies that were suppose to come with the steak were five little pieces of brocolli... Then the steak, he cuts into it and it is basically raw.. So rare it was blue! Made him sick after :(... My sandwich was awful and not as advertised at all either... Huge let down"
bj c.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/7/2014,"Wow I'm amazed at all these negative reviews. A year ago I would have agreed with them, but since then they've gotten a new manager and the food and service are both fantastic.  Years ago this Chili's was our go-to choice for casual dining near home. Then it got dreadful and we quit going. For some reason a couple months ago we gave them a try again, and are very happy we did. The salad was great, all the food and service as well. We've been back several times now; have been happy every time. We've had burgers, fajitas, salads and other sandwiches, all yum."
Christine C.,"Capitola, CA",0,37,2,3.0,10/25/2014,"Had lunch here with a friend. We ordered margaritas and a couple appetizers. I like their chips and guacamole, they  go great with margaritas! I like the seating in the bar better than the dining room. There are tv's in the bar to watch the game!"
jeff m.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,32,,2.0,1/23/2013,"Went to lunch there today 01-23-13. Taking the wife to lunch as we were doing errands. I suggested Chili's because of all the times I've gone to them. From Carmel to San Francisco, they've always been good. The Chili's at 1855 41st Ave, Capitola, is not one of those aforementioned Cili's I've experienced. As a fact, this restaurant experience was one of the worst ones ever! The service is good, I guess?  When we ordered our drinks, the coffee the wife ordered was served in a dirty cup. When unwrapping the napkin that held the silverware for my place, it was dirty. Of course the server brought us clean utensils & coffee served in a clean cup; should have walked out then? When we got our orders; the combos with soup an sandwich; the soup was cold. We asked the server to warm it up & when she came back, it was still cold. The next time an individual came out, it was the manager. She brought our soups heated to the degree that we were happy with, but had added bacon that we didn't want or ask for. At this point we just held back & removed the bacon.  The grilled sandwiches were good; cooked good. The back chatter of the supervisor critiquing the host, didn't make up for the fact that the building was cold. The waitperson did offer to give us dessert; whoopee. My wife kept talking to the person in her friendly consoling tone, which I admit was getting to me. I just wanted out of there & at that point, I know these people don't have a clue & I will never go back there.    It soured the rest of the day. I think headquarters needs to come to that particular restaurant & pave the policy for them, because if it has to rely on its own for conducting business, they'll lose. I've lived in the area since 1965 & the restaurants that I've gone to that were in that poor of operation, are only memories, that I couldn't tell you the name of. In the business reputation of Chili's, it might not be a bad thing that it close & people forget it ever existed."
Megan F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",23,3,,5.0,2/24/2015,I'm giving a five star review purely based on the fact that they have great service. Every time I go here for dinner or drinks I always enjoy myself and my server always presents them self very well. Tonight I went in with my boyfriend and our server Andrew was great he had a positive attitude and was quick as well as efficient even though we were not his only table. For a franchise restaurant this Chillis stands out because they have excellent customer service and get the food out in a timely manner. Thanks again Andrew!
Jasmeen M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",126,72,3,5.0,11/30/2014,"Don't heed the low ratings. My husband and I love this place! The food is delicious! He loves the burgers and is a huge burger fan, so he knows good quality. Their nachos are finally how nachos should be. Each one is covered in cheese and beans with a jalapeño. I've always thought nachos should be presented such that each one gets toppings. Chili's also has these cool devices where you can play games (although that costs $0.99) and pay your bill when you are finished. No wait to leave!"
Larry P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/14/2016,"Server was very friendly and seemed pretty genuine. The hostess was the one who really stood out to me though. I saw her bussing table after table, seating customer after customer, and just literally running all over the restaurant all while doing it with a smile on her face. I believe her name started with an F but I can't remember exactly what her name was. That's the kind of hard work every restaurant needs to have."
Perla L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,31,4,1.0,7/11/2015,"The service is very bad!! We ordered our food as soon as we sat down and noticed that all of the table nezt to us got their food first  but our appetizer is not even in our table, after 45 minutes of waiting one of the server noticed that we dont even have any of the food we ordered,so she call our server, we found out that she forgot  about us. They told us that our food is free . We are not coming back here anymore."
Opinionated B.,"Bay Area, CA",96,409,45,3.0,1/14/2013,"I don't typically rate franchise restaurants but sometimes I make an exception to my rule :-). I find this Chilis to be the best location I have eaten at. The food and service are generally very good. It's a small location attached to the Capitola mall so that can be a pain for both seating and parking.  This last time we went we had a larger than normal party. Our waiter Shane rose to the challenge. He brought extra plates, and everything we might need for a family with quite a few kids. He was friendly and quick and we appreciated his efficiencies.  Minus two stars because:  Our kids meals all came out WAY before the adult meals. Our kids were finished eating, and we found ourselves quickly scarfing down ours as the kids grew more and more impatient.  Minus another star because my chicken wings were so breaded you couldn't find meat and I ended up sending them back."
Kayla H.,"Shingle Springs, CA",10,36,6,1.0,4/26/2015,"First off, it took an hour for us to be given our drinks. And they sat us at a table that backed up to the kitchen and the table literally vibrated from a refrigerator running. Annoying, but we lived with it. Moving on to dinner...I ordered tacos and was starting to get full and took that last bite and felt something in my mouth. I take it out and just about die. My husband looked at me shocked because he was thinking what I was. It was a flipping fingernail!!!! Are you kidding me. I gagged and just about wanted to throw the whole meal up. Our waitress got the manager.  He offered to comp my meal and dessert.  I didn't want anything else from their kitchen. No thanks.  I really feel like the whole check should've been comped. I have talked to other restaurant employees and they were shocked that the manager didn't comp the whole check. Just ridiculous.  Health department will be getting a call. My husband took a picture of the fingernail."
Michael B.,"San Jose, CA",71,9,,1.0,4/28/2014,"I have lived in Santa Cruz for 12 years and going to Chili's in Capitola about twice a month or more for most of that time. The other night my parents and I went, we had one appetizer and three meals, three sodas, and it was almost $70! This would have normally cost us about 45 to 50, but they nickel and dimed us for every side and double charged for the chips and salsa. They have these new computer at the table where you can order drinks and appetizers, and play games for $1. The problem is that even if you accidently press a button it charges you. And I guarantee you they did this to get rid of a bunch of waiters. The service has gone way down hill, the portions are different, and even the manager was oblivious. Very disappointed and I don't think I will go back."
Aron H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",493,378,56,2.0,7/27/2012,"Usually I really enjoy chilis because they have great food and fast service. Tonight though they had the good food but they had horrible food wait times and it was not even busy. They even forgot my friends dessert, came over and apologized and told him it was going to be right out. After 20 minutes after that it still wasn't here. Don't know what went wrong tonight but it just put a hamper on our plans."
Ashley K.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,30,1,2.0,5/9/2014,Mediocre food and service. Food was typical chain food but plenty of options so that was a plus. Where chillis lost my vote was there service. Everytime I call a to go order when I arrive to pick it up I am ignored . Once I finally get the bartenders attention I have to wait another twenty minutes for my food. What's the point of calling ahead? Few times sat in the bar to eat. All times my server forgot about me and didn't return to the table almost the entire meal. I had to chase him down to get my check and chase him down again just to pay.
Mac H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",172,154,43,3.0,7/5/2012,"Sometimes I experience real crappy service here, but if you sit at the bar and in the bar area it seems as if the employees in there know what they're doing! HAPPY HOUR is the best time as well as the best deal!!! Half off appetizers, which is ONLY available in the Bar area might I add. I wouldn't drink the water unless you sanitize it with a lemon, its from tap which is typical of most restaurants. Their new cheese steak sliders are legit..."
