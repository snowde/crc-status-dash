Rob M.,"Ponce, Puerto Rico",42,21,11,4.0,7/27/2017,"Cayey, Puerto Rico.  I don't normally do reviews of chain restaurants because they're usually uniformly good or fair, but Chili's in the mountain town of Cayey is special.  Same exterior, same menu, but special.  The food tastes so good, so much better than the very same dish in other Chili's.  The service?  Special, also.  Our server was friendly, efficient and very attentive to have the cooking staff prepare a vegetarian version of an otherwise chicken meal.  Came in hungry.  Waddled out like stuffed penguins.  Very happy penguins."
Jennifer N.,"Sacramento, CA",581,458,1084,4.0,11/25/2013,"Food:  - Santa Fe Chicken Salad: Grilled chicken with spicy Santa Fe sauce, pico de gallo, diced avocado, cilantro, and tortilla strips with ranch dressing. One of my favorite salads! The portion is huge, it can probably feed 2! 4/5 Service: Friendly, attentive waiters. Drinks and food came out quickly. 4/5 Final thoughts: Chili's is a reliable for good food. I've liked almost everything I've had here. Good place to hang out with friends for beers and a sports game. Pricing is fair."
AGNES C.,"Vallejo, CA",1,33,2,3.0,6/13/2014,"I had a chicken ceasar salad with dressing on the side, my husband had the triple fajitas and margarita for drinks. The taste of the salad was good just that they gave me very little dressing. The fajitas steak meat taste a little strange, unable to describe tho the chicken and shrimp was good. Three tortillas is not enough for the meat had to ask for 1 extra. The sliced lemon on my drink had a dark spot and soft (old). The waiter was attentive and nice speaks very good English (Ulises)."
