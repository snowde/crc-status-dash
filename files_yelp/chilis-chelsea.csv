Dawn L.,"Revere, MA",30,53,55,5.0,1/7/2018,"Chili's is by far my FAVORITE chain restaurant!! They have the best burgers hands down that I've EVER tasted! Came to this location today, just me and my husband and sat at the bar and watched playoff football. It was amazing!!! Not too crowded! The bartender was awesome! I am sorry I can't remember her name but the her service was excellent and she seemed to know everyone by name as they came in!!! We got the southwest egg rolls which are always amazing and the beef nachos which I love because each extra thick chip is completely covered with all of the delicious toppings!!! My husband got the south western burger! I swear to you it was absolutely delicious!!! All of the flavors come together so perfectly, the meat was cooked to perfection ( medium rare) their fries are  also great! Gotta give Chili's a big A+ but this location an A+++++++++"
D C.,"Chelsea, MA",6,61,7,3.0,12/23/2017,"Food, very good and well presented. Drinks strong and also attractive. But the new McDonald's style seating is horrendous. Why they decided to remove the privacy factor is beyond me."
Greg D.,"Malden, MA",0,4,,3.0,12/17/2017,Tasty salads and good french fries but please don't warm up coffee in the microwave ;))
Bill M.,"Braintree, MA",0,4,,4.0,10/29/2017,This is one of my go to places to get a quick good meal. My son who's 7 loves it. From the chips n salsa to A wide choice of kids meals and he especially loves to play the tabletop games. So he gets something more than a fast food burger or nuggets and I get to have fajitas or something lite like their Mex bowls. Join their rewards program. Tonight I got 1/2 off Fajitas YUM
Pat C.,"Arlington, MA",0,7,1,2.0,6/13/2017,"Do not eat here! I ordered nachos a week ago and I've been sick to my stomach since. Plus, there was nobody to pick my my order from. I had to wait by the bar for 20 minutes! Save yourself from a horrible experience and skip this place."
Medok S.,"Brighton, MA",78,42,416,1.0,1/28/2017,"Oh God!!! This place is still working. When they will shut down this unsanitary, dirty robbing people place? Every time I think of their food I want to puke. Blah!!! Very sad looking, miserable food that looked at you in way saying: please don't eat me, I don't want to poison you. Please just trash me..."
Myan T.,"Revere, MA",368,156,359,2.0,12/12/2015,"The last time I came here was probably 3-4 years ago. The menu has changed drastically. There's plenty more options and deals as far as I can recall. (2 for 20, lighter entree option) However, I am still overall disappointed with their food. The fish tacos are terrible. 10 thumbs down! The cole slaw or whatever that was put in it made the overall taste awful. Why add things that don't make sense? The steak was also not great. Even at medium rare it was tough. The mandarin chicken was pretty bland. I drenched it in hot sauce to add some flavor. I can't even begin to tell you how the drinks were. The Long Island, overwhelming sour! Gross!! The margaritas were just as bad.  I will say service was decent. Our waiter was attentive. The bad thing, the electronic kiosk at the tables, they charge you! It is not stated anywhere that there's a charge, you only find out about it in your bill. Bad business!"
Rich T.,"Winthrop, MA",0,2,3,5.0,3/4/2017,Went around 6pm w my Mom cuz she was hungry for food and a jalapeño margarita. And I was down to PIG out too. I got the choose 3 and I got the baby back ribs cheddar and jalapeño sausage and honey barbecue chicken crispers. My meal alone was enough for her and I. It was awesome and the presentation was fancy for a chain restaurant. Our server was Jenny. Aka (Jenny from the HOP) and I will say she was awesome when my mom wanted her frozen jalapeño margarita she came back to tell my mom the blender would make it too spicy she asked if we wanted our apps and food at same time which we didn't and asked how our food was but not annoyingly for real she did her job good and it was busy up in there. Good was good took 1/2 home I was stuffed but over all a good ol' time
Iris O.,"Everett, MA",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2017,"I am never coming back to this place ever again , i tried it for the second time thinking my experience would be different , not worth the money me and my boyfriend spent here ,got sick to our stomachs right after eating here this place is so unsanitary especially their bathrooms , not a family friendly place , our waitress kept looking at our 2 year old like she hated kids"
Julia S.,"Randolph, MA",24,80,7,3.0,7/4/2016,"The food was ready quickly and smells great, but check out the size of this ""large"" guacamole for $3!"
Jean-Marie L.,"Newton, MA",2,24,25,4.0,8/22/2016,They always make great drinks. The appetizer's are good but the chips and salsa to salty! Nice laid back sports bar atmosphere.
Jennifer L.,"Medford, MA",109,1,,5.0,1/30/2017,"Daria is our favorite... we come to chilis far and few but every time she remembers myself and my fiancee and what we Drink and what we order... she's epic. From 2 servers to whom it may concern, this woman deserves recognition. Thank you for your service Daria, we will be back!"
Jacqueline G.,"Revere, MA",0,17,2,1.0,3/12/2017,Very unpleasant experience and will never be back. Service is everything and it's exactly what this place lacks. My boyfriend and I went in and seated ourselves at the bar area. It took the waitress about 15 minutes to acknowledge us and ask if we wanted a drink. She brought the wrong drinks about 20-30 minutes later. People who arrived after us were already eating. We then ordered our food as she walks away without me even finishing my order . It took another 40 minutes for our food to come out. Only to see the wrong order AGAIN and they completely forgot our appetizer. We didn't even get a discount for all of her mistakes and she had the audacity to look at me as if I were crazy when I told her that she completely forgot about our appetizer. Horrible and never going back
Aysha D.,"Chelsea, MA",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2016,I have love chillis till the last 2 times i went. The food just sends me straight to the bathroom. I know it is not just me because i went with my sister and she has a completely different body than me and the food still hurt her stomach really bad we both had to go to the hospital.
Vezna S.,"Winthrop, MA",123,397,105,4.0,11/27/2013,"Came for lunch the other day and had a very good experience. Had a server named Brandon show us to our table. Throughout the whole experience, he was an amazing server: attentive, prompt and always with a pleasant demeanor.  We started off with just water, I got one with lemon. When I got it, it was kind of brown in some areas.. didn't look too fresh. I didn't like the fact that we were seated in an overcrowded area but I get the fact that it's easier to sit everyone in one area so it's easier to clean, bus orders around and attend to the needs of the many. Me and my fellow patron elected to get the 2 for 20 deal. I ordered the 6oz steak with sweet potato fries and corn on the cob. I asked for it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The sweet potato fries were great.. the only downside was the cob which was dried out and looked as if it has been sitting under a heater for a majority of the day. The other order was their Mango and Avocado Tilapia with rice pilaf and string bean. It was overly seasoned and the flavor was too intense. The rice was bomb though and so were the beans. The appetizer was their Chipotle Chicken flat bread pizza (half order).. it was AMAZING! I absolutely adored it. The next time I go, I may just get the full sized one for a meal. Overall, the service was fast and pleasant (thanks to Brandon), the food was mostly great and the price was affordable. I tipped over the usual because the service was so good."
Taja M.,"Attleboro, MA",116,25,,5.0,8/4/2016,"Well...since my last post my grandfather has passed away but nothing but happy memories of going there with him on our visits to last a lifetime. So...here's the scenario...Me and my girls were in a rush to head to a church service that we were severely late for. We were all staaahhhvin! yes, i had to exaggerate my Bostonian accent. Anywho, we sat ourselves next to the bar in a small booth and we all kinda knew what we wanted, but i was the only one who stayed true to not changing my mind after looking at the menu. This is an updated review of my last post in 2011, my my my after 5 years, Chili's has still got it! I ordered, of course the Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich with fries and I let everyone at the table know not to ask for any of it because I was going to leave no fry unturned...lol. The other girls ordered that appetizer trio medley thingamajig.  Our waitress was Jenny, she was awesome in getting us water, tons of lemon and had our food in front of us in 20 minutes flat. I couldn't believe it, 4 meals that quick. Everything was super delicious. We all had ""The itis"" after but our stomachs were very happy. She deserves a raise. She was friendly while dealing with other tables, not too talkative but we weren't down for the small talk anyways, as i mentioned before, we were stahhhhvin. I promise I will try something else next time, and might take the buffalo chicken sandwich in a doggy bag... Small tip: I ordered a side of jalapenos to take my spicy sandwich up a few notches and was dissapointed, they tasted like pickled jalapenos, very limp, and no spicy bite to them. Chili's could spring for a new jalapeno recipe or whatever you call it.  I shall return..."
Lily M.,"Melrose, MA",0,13,4,5.0,3/24/2016,"I have been to this Chili's , no joke, at least once a week for the past 7 months. We have come to know one of the waiters quite well and will request him by name most nights. Cody is always happy, genuinely happy to see us, and is one of the most attentive and courteous servers I have ever had. Whenever we have another server, however, they have all been really sociable and on their A-game. I feel like management has really put an emphasis on customer service and quality, and it defiantly shows. I have been to multiple other locations and every time I'm so disappointed by the service, cleanliness of the restaurant/bathrooms, and the food itself. I have literally never had any reason to complain about food temperature, timing, taste, or price at the Chelsea location. There are, yes, some items on the menu that I'm not a huge fan of, but there are lots of options that are outstanding. The sour cream chicken enchiladas are the best , and the endless chips and salsa are, in my opinion, the best deal and tasting chips and salsa around.  My husband and I will order a 24 oz miller light, chips and salsa, and entrees, and can walk out for about $35. It's a delicious steal."
Zaida A.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/21/2017,I was there Sunday. And witness a waitress in the kitchen  grabbing a bunch of broccoli. With the  bare hands and put it in a plate squeezing it to the side after having been in the register handling money .  (She was short and had color paint onom her hair ) another guy throwing food on someone's plate as if he was throwing a football .  When I went to pay I used their tipping system witch is not accurate. In reality I tip her 24 percent  instead of 20 percent when I google it. This is unethical procedure.  Robbing costumers is not right . I am contacting the attorney general.  BTW I was there between 4pmm-5.30.  This place was nice but not anymore.
Tasia C.,"Revere, MA",0,44,16,2.0,4/2/2015,"I've never come here and got my order completely done right. Tonight, we came in and sat in the lounge area - servers walk back and forth by us but no one acknowledged us so we asked the host if there was a server in the area. The host grabs someone, we  put in our order immediately and waited a little while for our food. My fiancé gets her pasta and it has chicken on it instead of shrimp. They take it back, now it doesn't have the garlic bread. They bring the garlic bread and the noddles are over cooked with under cooked shrimp. If you're in this area and looking for something quick, don't pick Chili's."
Charlena K.,"Boston, MA",11,102,46,1.0,2/7/2014,"Oh my goodness! This was my first experience at this particular Chili's and an ""experience"" it was. The service was absolutely horrific! I visited on Sunday, 12/08/2013, with my boyfriend & father; and I won't ever be back. Our waitress never even gave her name (probably out of fear of her identity being revealed here for her lack of customer service); our food was room temperature, the cheese on my boyfriends loaded potatoes weren't even melted (that's how cold the food was!); there was a woman breast feeding her child (completely uncovered) at the table directly in front of me; and getting a beverage refill was like competing in an Olympic sport. The waitress didn't apologize a single time. She seemed completely unphased by the fact that we were unsatisfied. I asked for the manager and of course he profusely apologized and did his best to make things right. I really appreciated him for that and his efforts didn't go unnoticed. Still, I won't ever be back. Ever! * EDIT 2/12/2014: The reviewer below me (initials L.M.) sent me a note saying ""Mass Law allows women to breastfeed where they please... move to another state if something like this bothers you."" I just want to let anyone offended by my review know that 1) regardless of law, I would consider covering yourself while breastfeeding in a restaurant where people eat a courtesy 2) I would never move because someone failed to be courteous 3) please refrain from messaging me in anger/frustration/whatever because our opinions differ. Yelp is for objectively reviewing places based on your experience and this was MINE."
David O.,"Central Square, Boston, MA",0,11,3,2.0,5/21/2016,"It was going to be a 1 star but the ""gesture"" of the bar tender changed it a bit.  I was there on Thursday with my gf at around 1pm.  Ordered a beer and a margarita which was extremely sweet, beer was perfect extremely cold how it should be.  Ordered appetizer ok, ordered a new chilli steak ordered medium taste was good presentation was ok but was over cooked, my gf ordered ribs half rack they were cold, it comes with French fries and they were also cold he couldn't finish her meal, bar tender asked if we wanted to take it home we said no ""we didn't like it""'gave us a annoyed face and took her plate away, ordered another round of iced cold beer which is what will make us go back.  At the end bartender comped our ribs.  Not the greatest customer service, very very poor food quality, specialty drinks not great quality,  iced cold beer yes!!!!"
Lorraine C.,"Everett, MA",28,20,92,2.0,1/31/2015,"My boyfriend and I got a gift card to Chili's for Christmas so we decided to go yesterday for  dinner and some drinks. We sat in the lounge area and were served my Jennifer. She was THE worst server I have ever had. She was constantly checking up on the tables around us, but never had time for us. We place our drink order. The drinks were good. But then it took her about 15 mins to come back and get our food order and every time I attempted to grab her attention  she didn't seem to care.  When she finally came back to our table I ended up ordering a 6oz steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes. My boyfriend grabbed a new item called ""Classic 6oz Sirloin Steak with grilled avocados and tomatoes."" When we got our order his dish was missing a few things...like the avocados and tomatoes. We complained about the dish and she complained with us saying that we didn't ask for that. I work in a restaurant and I know for a fact that you should never fuss with the customer. Try to fix the situation. And she didn't. If you do end up going to this Chili's then you should simply order your food on the machine that stays on the table because the waitress of no help at all."
Bex B.,"Revere, MA",2,14,,5.0,1/29/2016,Erika is amazing. She was so accommodating. Creative cocktails. Friendly and great service!!!!!
Chris P.,"Martinez, CA",0,44,,1.0,11/12/2016,"It is so rare for me to give a place one star as there is usually some redeeming part of the experience, but not here. Service was slow. Polite but painfully slow. Then the meal comes - chili worse than you can get out of a can and mediocre ""Mexican"" food. Stay away."
ROBIN B.,"Revere, MA",23,25,3,2.0,12/17/2014,"Went to dinner with my family last night. Food took forever to come, when we finally got the food my order was wrong. Got the hostess to look at it and she took it back to the kitchen to be remade. I was told it was being made on the fly but you could have fooled me. 20 minutes later I finally get my food. At this point I just want t go home as everyone else is done eating already.  Rosa was our server and she was very apologetic and it was clearly a kitchen problem so we still took care of her. My biggest issue is that my meal was not taken off the bill and I didn't know until I got home or I would have made a stink right then. also when you have to remake a meal it would be nice if a manager came over and talked to us. I guess I will be calling him today!"
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",158,857,3017,4.0,1/24/2012,"Love Chilis & Love that everytime I pull in the parking lot I get discouraged that the place is Packed...  Then I walk in & there are 10 people in the place, then I realize they all went in the Gym next door & just park in the Chilis area...  Went last week & they were having Trivia night on Monday @7... I was in the booth section & shouting out answers (prolly frowned upon)...  But I will def be back for Trivia night...  The waitress we had that night told us it was her first night & I have to say she might have been one of the best waitresses I had anywhere... She continually refilled my water without me even have to do the long last slurp where you are sucking ice to get the waiter/waitress to acknowledge you are out of beverage, yeah I didnt have to do that...  She was on point.. My son wasnt eating his apples - so she brought him oranges without being attitudy Judy like most people are when I complain about my kids eating habits...  She was great & it made the place great, but this Chilis never had a complaint from me!"
Eliud F.,"Boston, MA",0,2,1,5.0,10/9/2016,"Great place to come in family and have a good time my server(Jarvis)was great,jarvis should have a raise"
A S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,14,4,1.0,7/10/2016,Worst Turkey burger in my whole life. Dry and over cooked the cheese was congealed but most importantly DRY AND OVERCOOKED. I choked trying to swallow. Do not eat here it's not worth it and the men's restroom was covered in vomit yeck. The molten chocolate cake was dry and the lava was frozen not molten. Also the portions are so small. Don't plan on sharing with your friends.
Trevor M.,"Boston, MA",0,13,,1.0,4/24/2015,"Well I usually don't mind coming to this place but I've sat at the bar the last couple of times lately. These last two times I've been stuck being served by a female Bartender by the name of Martinez. She's absolutely miserable!!!! Horrible attitude when dealing with customers. She should be kept in the kitchen so she doesn't have to use her non existent customer service skills. Guess I'll be avoiding the bar when she's working. Life's not that bad, but if it is stay home and don't work a customer service position!!!!"
Miss T.,"Salem, MA",14,254,12,5.0,6/24/2013,Try the chicken flatbread & the skillet choc chip. Yummy!!! Cant finish it dont worry containers and take home for later. YUMMY....... Staff is always pleasant and food is great.  Manager is very nice.
Denise D.,"Boston, MA",3,31,2,1.0,4/27/2016,"I used to come here and dine in and the service was pretty good I had no complaints. Until yesterday when I placed an order online to go. When I arrived I must have stood at the to-go booth for 7 minutes before a guy came out of the back coughing all over his hands. He must have noticed the disgust in my face which is when he directed me to the bar to pick up my order. Once I got to the bar the bartender looked perplexed asking me why I was sent over to her because someone was at the to-go booth. Well obviously not. So she proceeds to show some patrons pictures in her phone before checking on my order and taking my card. Once I pay I patiently wait and after about 3 minutes ask her ""is my order coming out at the bar or am I picking it up at the to-go booth"". She then says ""oh you can go over there and pick It up"". Like seriously when were you going to tell me. So I walk back over to the to-go booth again no one there. FINALLY a girl comes out and says ""I'll be right with you"". She comes back and asks me what I'd like to order. Are you effing kidding me right now! By this time I'm pissed and don't even want the food. I tell her what I ordered she says she'll check on it. Low and behold my order was sitting on the counter in a bag from the moment I walked in. I will NOT be returning here. Service was horrible."
Kerry K.,"Ooltewah, TN",11,12,,1.0,1/6/2015,"Well, I will never go back to this place.  I was there for dinner with a co-worker.  I ordered a dinner salad and potato skins.  Wanted the salad first and the potato skins as my entrée.  Well, the potato skins came out first so I sent them back.  The salad came out next.  Now, done with the salad and out come the potato skins.  I ate two of them and went to eat the third one when I noticed something.  Looked closer and found a ROACH cooked with the cheese and bacon bits on top of the third potato skin.  Got pictures to prove it.  Spoke to the Mgr....he compt'd our meal.  I stated that I would like a copy of the incident report that they would send to corporate office....gave them my business card and NEVER heard anything back from mgt there.   Please look first before you eat........"
Jason K.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2015,Food was okay but the appetizer took 20 minutes to get to the table. Of course as soon as they brought the app to the table the meal came 2 minutes later. I think I'll skip this Chili's from now on. Not the first time I have had not so good service here.
Christina Z.,"Winthrop, MA",240,145,25,4.0,6/6/2011,"Each time I'm at this Chili's (which is sometimes once a week), I ask exactly 20 questions.  Why am I in Chelsea? Why is this place so close? Are we going to get stabbed? Should we sit at the bar or the restaurant (even though we are only ordering apps and bevs)? Why are there so many Bruins fans? Does my strawberry margarita have any alcohol in it? Can I get sugar around the rim? thanks. Why are the Southwestern eggrolls SO damn addictive? Why are these chips so weak? What is this sauce for? Can I get a second margarita, with some alcohol in it this time? Why am I still eating these egg rolls? Why did we get the spinach artichoke dip and the mozzarella sticks? Should we do dessert? Can I order a THIRD... okay okay? What kind of tequila do you use? Can we move our seats? Can you please eat an eggroll so I'm not finishing the entire...? Why is this bill SO cheap? When are we coming back? Tried and true. I mean, it's a Chili's!"
Leishla M.,"Providence, RI",183,65,2,4.0,1/6/2014,"Last month I decided I was not going to come back to this Chilis. But, I have a daughter who has a fit if we don't come every couple weeks (it was our mother daughter dinner place).  Stopped in yesterday afternoon and was served by Laura. She was amazing! Attentive, sweet, and quick. We wanted our alone time so she wasn't in our bubble too much.  Thanks to her, I have hope in this Chilis again. Thank you Laura!"
Maritza A.,"Boston, MA",93,4,,1.0,9/8/2015,"I had a gift card we were excited to use during our visit. So we went out of our way to end up at this location even though the gift card was valid at other restaurants as well. We walked in and the hostess wasn't there, so we waited for about five minutes before we were seated. Once we had a table we discussed what we were going to order. Five minutes passed and no one stopped by. We saw a waiter go to the table next to us but we weren't acknowledged. Then ten minutes passed and still not a single waiter had stopped by to ask us what we wanted to drink. Yet again we saw another waiter walk by but we weren't acknowledged. Needless to say, they weren't busy and now we were pretty irritated because we were just sitting there with our menus doing nothing. After 20 minutes of being seated with no one acknowledging us we got up and our way out the hostess didn't even notice we were leaving without having ordered. After we called the manager over to let him know what happened, he did offer to get us food but at this point we felt like our business was not needed there otherwise we wouldn't have gone so long without a server acknowledging us."
Francisco M.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,4.0,4/20/2015,"I ordered the Classic Ribeye and I wanted it well done, but when I was eating it I could see traces of pink. There is a bar, but many of the people don't make so much noise. They have these table tablets for kids to play on. It was much better than I expected it to be. The customer service is great, some food is a bit pricy but it is good."
Justin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,168,523,3.0,11/9/2013,It's a Chilis. In Chelsea. If that isn't telling enough I guess you can read on. I pretty much just get the healthy meal options here. Mango chicken and tilapia. Things like that. Usually the dishes are decent sized and somewhat healthy but they are definitely just barely a step above TV dinners. Flavor is lacking and what they do to add flavor is just dump some salsa on top of the fish / chicken. These are afterthought dishes that work if you just need cheap food. Drinks are ok - stick with beers to be slightly safer. For some reason I really like their chips. Go for the fire roasted corn guac dip. Pretty decent. All things considered - we average out around the middle 2.5-3. They are open late so I'll bump to hard 3.
Tom B.,"Wakefield, MA",8,58,30,1.0,11/12/2013,"Man I've had quite the experience with this Chilies. And I'm more than glad to share an unforgettable moment for me on Yelp.  I once went here for lunch with five other people. The last thing we had to worry about was getting a table. The place was deserted. Only about three other tables were being used. We should be having a fairly quick lunch; that's what I assumed. Once we made our ordered, we all got what we ordered and the food was fantastic as usual. Our wait time was a disastrous 45 minutes! There was no effort from the waitress staff whatsoever. Keep in mind that our waitress didn't even check back from us at all after we ordered. We got no drink refill, and no notification on our food progress. This might be the worst service from a restaurant I've ever experienced. I wouldn't take my risks eating here."
Montgomery V.,"Boston, MA",0,15,,2.0,11/30/2012,"I walked in and thought I was transported to the ""It's a Small World"" ride at the Magic Kingdom. Everyone was so friendly!! With warm smiles & hardy greetings, patrons scattered to offer me their premium seats. An off duty bus boy sprang back into service to clear the perfect table. I ordered a draft beer; it was icy cold!  I placed my food order and choked on an ice chip in my beer as I awaited its arrival. I looked towards the friendly patrons for a little reassurance only to find them replaced by surly men with neck tattoos.  Odd.  I became a little unnerved when I noticed the sweet girls sitting at the booth behind me were nursing huge margaritas with tiny Corona iv drips.  They cackled soullessly.  My food arrived. My veggie burger was stiff and dry. I inspected it more closely and became transfixed by a large white spot. Hypnotic mold?  I don't know.  The cackles grew louder and I just wanted to go home. My waitress was nowhere to be found. Gone are the days of free chips and salsa that I remember from my youth.  The new age of Chili's has arrived and it is bleak my friends."
