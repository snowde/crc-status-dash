Melissa M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",21,54,52,1.0,7/11/2014,"Our meal started off great with the fresh guacamole and chips. Then it went downhill from there. I ordered a margarita with salt on the rim and instead I didn't get salt on the rim and there was something floating in both my and my husbands drinks. Then we must have sat there for an hour and a half and still didn't get our food. Keep in mind I ordered the California grilled chicken flatbread and my husband ordered a burger medium well. When we received our food, I received the margerita flatbread and my husbands burger was cold in the middle so he returned the burger. They blamed the service on the new cooks in the back. This is the worse service me and my husband have received at this location. We have been here several times and the service has been super except this time. Let's hope this doesn't happen to anyone else . Get it together!"
Dan R.,"East Falmouth, MA",103,1615,5633,2.0,12/21/2012,"Tonight we went to Chili's and it was the worst experience ever. We got to the restaurant, and had to bus our own table. Finally after the waitress came over, she was rude and unresponsive. We finally put in our order, and eventually got our food 50 minutes later. The waitress said that the kitchen was ""backed up"" but all the tables that came in behind us got served.  The next amazing customer service experience was when the waitress was talking to her friends at a table, and when we asked for some refills she told us to ""wait a second"", spoke with her friends for another 5 minutes, then came to the table and greeted us with ""yes,yes,yes!"" The final kicker for our night was that we had to wait 30 minutes for our bill, and once we finally were able to pay the waitress pocketed the money and rudely gave us back our cash. Final thoughts:Terrible waitress and depressed staff"
A O.,"Everett, MA",0,7,,1.0,4/15/2015,TERRIBLE!! Don't ever eat here unless you want your butt to become an active volcano! Hostess was a very effeminate male with mousy hair. Didn't care for him. This chilis is the opposite of what Michael Scott would find a suitable place for the dundees! I much rather drink sewage water than drink a margarita from this establishment! Never again will I visit a chilis restaurant!!
Bill G.,"Winthrop, Boston, MA",22,14,,3.0,12/15/2012,"We've always found thus Chilis to be a good ""go to"" spot to take the family out for dinner. It's relatively close and it's simple. What else would you expect from national chains like this. I find the chips to be overly salty at times and occasionally the waitstaff being in attentive and borderline surly. Taylor is one of the better ones. Whenever we go our older daughter asks if we are going to see her."
Courtney N.,"Saugus, MA",0,8,2,5.0,8/1/2015,We are come here often and always sit on the bar side.. Almost every single server is great.. They have never messed up our food and it's always great and we have a complicated order bc we always order something that's not on the menu but they always do it with a smile and comes out great! Stephanie is fantastic!!
Susan Y.,"Revere, MA",14,3,,3.0,1/8/2015,It was the worst ever the food was cold and tasted like it was days old this is the second time I ordered take out never never again and to top it of the staff are so rude and ignorant when you have to wait for your food at the bar they all ignore you
Marissa S.,"Salem, MA",64,135,22,5.0,4/14/2011,"I had a casual business meeting here and I have to say it was awesome for a Chile's. Good service, good food, and drink specials.  The bar area is very nice and accommodating. It was a perfect place to wait for my guest. Once they arrived we were seated immediately and the server was very quick with our drink order.  Our food came out quickly and was cooked as requested. The restaurant was clean and everyone was very friendly. I would definitely go to this chile's again."
Tony P.,"Boston, MA",9,19,,5.0,3/20/2012,"Went for $2.29 drafts stayed for TRIVIA. Had a blast doing it. Heard the host say they have it every Monday night at 7pm, I'll be back to play 100% you should too. As for the food. It's chain food...so obviously you won't be BLOWN away by it. But it's always very good (not great) and consistent.  Love tortilla chips but hate the salsa. Then again, I am a salsa snob haha"
Bob N.,"Winthrop, MA",0,3,,2.0,9/15/2014,Wife and me have been to this location over 200 times (no exaggeration) in last 4 years. Our favorite restaurant. The last 3x we have been there we have had issues with the food. On two occasions our Salmon was way undercooked. On our last visit my broccoli was tasteless and brown in color. My wife's salad has been poor. Wait staff is still good but food is terrible. The old manager left but I'm not sure if that effects the food. We have decided to look for a new favorite restaurant.
Bo F.,"Boston, MA",25,86,98,4.0,9/21/2013,A steadfast and reliable late night dining option I am a local and can always count on this Chili's
Ron S.,"Omaha, NE",31,26,2,3.0,5/21/2011,"If you happen to find yourself in Chelsea surrounded by gas tanks and potholes, I'm sorry.  Let's face it; you're not going to find a ton of culinary options around here.   I generally avoid chain restaurants at all costs.  However, the bar area is is open and pleasant with 4 or 5 TV's, and $1.99 domestic drafts are the best deal in the area.  Skip the mediocre entrees (unless chain food is your thing; the pizza next door at the Brown Jug is better), grab some complimentary chips and salsa, hang out and watch a Sox game."
Renata S.,"Everett, MA",3,13,1,1.0,6/10/2011,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! The waitress seemed to be new to the job, and was kind of runnig like she had 7 heads.  Took her 30 minutes to get our drink orders, and she actually yelled at us because she thought we were ""talking too loud"" for her.  She messed up 2 of my friends drinks.  My drink was horrible. She clearly showed she did not want to serve our table what so ever.  Other waiters came to our table very rude to ask us to quiet down (we were 5 women enjoying a night out). We transfered to a boost at the bar thinking that would bring some peace to our night and we would be able to talk, laugh and have fun, but we were sooo wrong. They kept being rude to us, the waitress kept running like crazy, never coming to our table to serve us nicely as any other waitress would do in any other restaurant. One other waitress actually wanted us to PAY OUR BILL BEFORE WE EVEN RECEIVED OUR FOOD!!!!! Not even the very well made food took the sour taste this bad service left on our mouths. No, me and my friends will never ever go back there. We usually go out at least 2 times a month, we've being to TGIFriday's, Texas road house, Margaritas and so many others, and never have being treated like this!"
Lydo r.,"Boston, MA",131,23,14,3.0,10/17/2010,"I am not a big of chain restaurants but Chili's is one of the few exceptions. I have been lucky enough to experience the same quality of food and service around the country and its good enough that i keep going back. Its never too crowded and its a good quick eat on a rainy night. You can never go wrong with the ribs. At this particular location, the servers and staff in general were very friendly and accommodating. and the location allows for some window shopping to spend time if there is ever a wait. Very convenient if traveling on route 16 or route 1, and if you leave close enough and dont want to go all the way into the city."
Lindsey B.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,4.0,2/1/2013,"I usually come here with friends to grab some drinks and a appetizer, it's good especially if you wanna stay local. I've always had friendly waitresses and the food is always tasty !! The location used to be a bad area, but now there's ton of new shops etc."
Sandy A.,"Everett, MA",0,6,1,3.0,8/19/2010,"As a general rule, I really like Chili's.   Cheap beers ($1.99 Stella), nice bar, yummy food. For the most part I reall can't say anything bad about this place. The only reason I'm not giving this location 5 stars is because of their trivia nite. The game is very unorganized and it quickly turns into just a shout contest with prizes consisting of things the host just seems to have found lying around his house. He starts by asking the audience to throw out topic suggestions for his questions. He makes up questions right on the spot and God forbid you suggest a topic he doesn't like because he becomes very agressive, rude and confrontational when you don't know an answer to his question. Oh and if he wasn't asking one of his poorly prepared questions then he is plugging some trivia book he wrote in the 80s.  5 Stars to Chili's.  1 Star to Mr. Trivia Jerk.  I love trivia nites and frequently go to other bars in and around the boston area to play, and after my experience with Chili's choice for their trivia nite, I will NEVER go back there to play."
Stephanie C.,"Somerville, MA",2,25,,3.0,7/20/2009,"Chili's is a lot of fun. I would stick mostly to the appetizers and the baby back ribs or the chicken tacos. We got the spinach and artichoke dip once, and I don't recommend it. I always get the skillet queso - gosh I wish I was eating that right now! Their chips are always warm and crisp and salty.  We usually split the queso, the kickin' jack nachos, southwestern eggrolls, and an order of the baby back ribs. I'm pretty sad that they got rid of the awesome blossom. I usually get a few presidente margaritas. Sit in the lounge area; it is fun to watch tv and the bar. The dining area is too cold!"
Jenny T.,"Everett, MA",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2011,"First time I arrived, it was a bit too crowded. We got seated, waited and waited for about 20 mins. No Servers came to take our orders. After another 5 mins, we decided to leave. We decided to give it another shot at around 12pm on a weekday. The food was okay..except the silverware  was still dirty with stains on it. Don't think I will be coming back here."
Kelly S.,"Houston, TX",15,49,,3.0,2/16/2010,"For a chain restaurant, Chili's is one of my favorites. This Chili's moves up a notch in my book for the $1.99 beer specials. The bartenders are super friendly and usually remember us as we are regulars here. They just started having trivia there during the week and though we haven't gone for it yet, seems like a nice draw. They do have takeout but we have found it is usually not as good as eating right in the restaurant."
Avi A.,"Middlesex, MA",0,11,,2.0,9/23/2009,"Their signature desert , the one with warm cake and icecream, did not have the chocolate melt; just a solid piece in the middle. Certainly not a chocolate volcano as they advertise it. Very disappointing! Obviously they didn't heat the cake long enough."
Ryan S.,"Ithaca, NY",35,170,10,4.0,10/29/2008,I just found out what Michael F posted that the Sam Adams promotion was over...very sad...they continue to do beer specials...currently its bud light for 1.99/pint...its no Sam but if I'm in the mood to throw a few back while watching the game I'll do it once in a while (I stuck with the Sam this visit though).  Look forward to them bringing back another Sam promotion though.  Other than that I agree with the other post that the people here are usually very friendly and super attentive...
