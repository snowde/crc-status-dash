Nadaline J.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,20,2,1.0,5/9/2010,This location sucks. I live in the area and usually order takeout. They have forgotten my orders and they never (and I mean never) get my order right. The food is okay depending on the day you order. Not my favorite restaurant to say the least.
Girard M.,"Malden, MA",8,16,,4.0,2/17/2009,"Chili's is my absolute favorite chain restaurant. Not fancy and certainly not trashy- you gotta love it! My favorite spot was at Chili's inside the Copley Mall, Boston but they shut that baby downing for some reason. That mall is real shady -quietly pushing out the young crowd but that's another story. Back to Cha-cha- cha-Chili's, I love the menu selections, they always provide an upbeat, live, social atmosphere. Great for dates, friends, etc. I've only been to the one in Revere once and it was on a Tuesday so it was very slow but I could see this spot having more life on weekends. I love their big mouth burgers, pretty good stuff. I'd marry their baby back ribs if I could..lol. But nowadays I mess with the grilled chicken breast platter which comes with some rice and broccoli-the chicken breast is superb and its so juicy (mmm!). You can find it in the guiltless section of the menu for healthy eaters but you would never guess. I always top off my meals with a nice serving of their molten cake which is a Warm chocolate cake with chocolate fudge filling. Topped with vanilla ice cream under a crunchy chocolate shell. So freaken good ( I kid-u-not!!). If you do ""take out"", the cake part will be cold but that's no problem-just throw it in the microwave for like 17secs to give you a warm touch, then put the ice cream on that bad girl and eat her (the cake). Enjoy! Holla at ya boy"
