Idalis H.,"North Central, San Antonio, TX",10,4,12,3.0,12/23/2017,I love Chili's their food never disappoints! But they need to get their waiting service together! Got our order wrong twice and never brought us the chips and queso! Honey Chipotle crispers are bomb!
J M.,"Clovis, NM",5,219,277,4.0,7/2/2017,Never had any issues..come here once a month or so. Food always fresh and prepared well. Service always great. Clean and enjoyable
Yelitza C.,"Severn, MD",45,26,4,1.0,7/4/2017,"Come here if you wanna know what it is like to have an invisibility cloak. A hostess sat us down. 30 minutes later a Server finally walked by and asked if we had been helped. We said, ""No."" Server mentioned something about idiot coworkers and how they were not supposed to be seating people in our section. Then Server took our beverage orders. We waited another 20 minutes for nothing to happen. Then we went home. It is simply bad form to badmouth and detail the disfunction of one's place of employment to customers."
Jen C.,"Albuquerque, NM",107,226,86,3.0,12/16/2015,"Clovis New Mexico!  It's a place on the map!  I'm there once or twice a month on business and the stopped into Chili's for dinner for one.  I sat in the bar area and received friendly service.  The server is a military spouse and was quick to fill me in on the Clovis scene.  The food, decor, and drinks were all Chili's standard.  I was surprised by how busy it was on a random Tuesday and waited for about 20 minutes for a table.  Nothing special or unique as with most chain restaurants.  I ordered the Ancho Salmon from the lighter side menu and the salmon was cooked fine, though didn't have a fantastic flavor.   Overall, I will likely be back as it's very convenient to my hotel.  Friendly service is a plus but the food isn't a huge draw."
Elgin B.,"Tarrytown, NY",4,23,7,2.0,5/20/2016,"Was there last night after going to the movies. I want to blame the service or lack of due to timing. We were a party of 7, half kids, and we got there around 9-9:30. Our waitress came took our drink orders hurriedly. Then came back and took our orders again hurriedly. It was then that I noticed that they were turning chairs over on the dining tables which let me know it was closing time. The food arrived and my salmon wasn't fully cooked and one of the kids pasta was soggy and half cooked.  Maybe it was our fault for coming late and not noticing closing times or maybe it was Chili's fault for trying to accommodate us but the food was not worth it"
Carsten D.,"Clovis, NM",2,23,15,1.0,9/4/2016,"What can I say? It took awhile to get served when we were sat down. Now there is a science to cooking, why there are certain ways to do things. We got our appetizers, and my wife wanted boneless wings lightly sauced. They were brought out dry with the sauce on the side. How can my wife toss them to get coated? The kitchen's reason for this is because it is a ""hit hot and miss"" situation. How hard is it to toss them in less sauce? They get coated by tossing them in sauce, just need less. My wife's margarita chicken came out cold. I got the carribean salad with shrimp, extra sauce on the side. I got chicken, which was cold, and the salad came out drenched in sauce. There was no crisp to it anymore and the amount of dressing made me sick. I wanted extra on the side so that I could add it as I saw fit. THERE WAS A PUDDLE OF DRESSING!!! Didn't need extra after all. We got a comped dessert so we got a molten. It looked sickly. There was not even a full scoop of ice cream and it looked like they covered half of it with Fudge, not the hard shell. And during all of this, we were talking to the ""manager"" who looked like she was confused about it all. Didn't know what to do. It has definitely gone down hill since the last time I was here. Now I have to go take some peptol bismal."
Michelle M.,"San Jose, CA",516,550,2836,2.0,12/27/2014,"INSIDE: I'm from CA and it looks the same as any other Chili's location. Outside and inside is all the same decor and feel.  MENU: exactly the same too, talk about a chain restaurant across the states! Got the bean dip appetizer and tastes the same as all other Chili's in CA. Like from a bean dip can. Food tastes the same just okay nothing special.  STAFF: the first server was nice, she knew how to serve and was friendly, nothing to review negatively about, but then she went on break... and introduced some other girl who seemed nervous upon looking at me like she has  never seen an Asian person before. She kept stuttering and wouldn't get close to the table and only spoke to the guy I was with and wouldn't look me in the face like I couldn't speak for myself (and yes I speak English). She would come back every now and then and ask from a good 3-4 feet away if everything was ok.  When we asked for the bill she asked nervously if it needs to be split. Really? You do NOT ask a guy and a girl if the check needs to be split. How awkward is that if it's a guy and a girl on a date. If the check is gonna be split then the customers will ask you to split it. Maybe she was new, but I don't think so because she acted normal to the other tables. I know being in Clovis, NM they probably don't see many minorities, but this is America and a modern generation so I expected normal treatment.  OVERALL: took off stars for the second awkward server and the food was just okay. This review is long overdue, but better late than never."
Jester T.,"Doyline, LA",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2016,"Worst Chili's I've been to ever. Drinks took a long time to get the first time and even longer the second time around. Ordered the trio fajitas, the skillet was cold as well as the veggies, chicken, shrimp and steak. A bone in the boneless loaded buffalo wings. Manager was non caring like it was a joke, well he is a joke. I was in full service restaurants for a lot of years including as managing them. He tucked his tail and hid in the BOH and let the server who was also struggling take the heat, what a boss. We come here every year to see family who lives here and with a ticket of 150.00 dollars even they will not be returning and they are going to talk to their friends about staying as far away as possible. Hate that Chili's is getting a review like mine but we go to ours back home several times a month with a group and love it back home."
Shawn W.,"Clovis, NM",0,7,,3.0,3/24/2017,"Going to be generous with 3 stars because I usually get good food here, but there have been times where burgers resemble a hockey puck. Well this review is for our lunch today because we ordered the smokehouse plates and they informed us they were out of bone in chicken......how the hell do you not have chicken at noon?? I could understand closing time, and yeah maybe but really, at noon. Cmon chilis get it together."
Celena R.,"Nellis Air Force Base, NV",0,1,,1.0,3/24/2017,"This place is awful, it was a pure shit show the entire time. Don't waste your money."
Brian C.,"West Henrietta, NY",0,2,,5.0,12/8/2016,"We almost decided against going to this chili's  due to the many poor reviews but we're glad we gave it a chance! Our experience was excellent: service was great and the food was delicious. I usually don't review places on yelp but I thought that this chili's could use some good reviews because although anecdotal, we had a solid experience. Hope you do too!"
Mia H.,"Denver, CO",0,2,4,1.0,8/26/2016,The service sucks. It took about 5 years for the food to come out. Our waitress burned me with the skillet thing. Food is subpar. Waitress forgot about 6 things. Never again.
Nathan L.,"Portales, NM",0,8,6,3.0,1/13/2016,"Its a Chili's they are about the same everywhere you go. This place is best around 3 pm. ****Careful walking around the floor is greasy, not normal for a Chili's but good place in Clovis to eat."
Sandra H.,"Clovis, NM",0,21,,2.0,7/26/2015,Their food is good but they struggle always with take out orders.  Rarely will you receive what you have ordered for take out.   Dining in means you will experience dirty floors and poor service from the hostesses to the managers.  They do have some very good servers.
Sunnie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,1.0,6/5/2015,The tall manager tried to talk his way around giving us good service but it was very obvious that he didn't have any interest in giving us good service since he thinks it's the only place in town to eat. It's not and I hate coming here because of it!
Jason W.,"Athens, GA",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2015,"This Chilis is a disgrace to all chain restaurants. The bartenders are completely inattentive. I've been here at least 5 times in the past month, to give a fair chance. I've gotten a good impression as to the quality of restaurant they choose to run. The food is a joke. I've had everything from burgers, to ribs, to appetizers. The prices are inline with other Chilis, but the inexcusable quality makes it overpriced to say the least. Disgusted."
Katy H.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,26,8,1.0,9/27/2013,"Worst Chile's I've ever been to. I am in from out of town, decided to have a few beers and get some food to go. Sure...I should have checked the bag, but...really? I got a triple appetizer to go. NONE of the sauces had lids and the box was a MESS when I opened it. I asked for the sliders to come with the guacamole on the side and it was not. No napkins or silverware were placed in my bag, which was an additional ""surprise."" Extremely glad I do not live here and have to rely on such poor service. Disappointed is not a big enough description. :-("
Sarai G.,"Castaic, CA",47,170,25,4.0,12/16/2014,"Again, people of Clovis. Thank your lucky stars you have a Chilis in the middle of nowhere. If you don't like the wait time and head to the bar. But it does appear Chilis is the place to be at so it gets mad busy. It is huge and the food tastes like Chilis food. So if you're missing home it's the perfect place to go to."
Caoimhe C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",5,15,2,3.0,4/17/2015,Pretty standard. Been twice this week on my own. First night I was well looked after and the food was excellent (guac burger with Turkey patty and broccoli) - tonight it was super busy so there wasn't much staff engagement and the rice was a little dry/undercooked - tacos were tasty tho (pork carnitas tacos).
Anna C.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,7,,1.0,10/26/2015,Legitimately horrible service. Our drinks sat at the bar (within eyesight) until I mentioned to the waiter that he should grab them. Chips were soaked with oil. Just nope - go elsewhere.
Kat L.,"Great Neck, NY",270,711,238,5.0,12/10/2012,"This is a GREAT chili's!  The best server I've ever had... EVER.  Ask for Saibree!  She's not only nice, efficient, and friendly, she's gorgeous too.   Went in for lunch, and while it was busy we were seated immediately.  Food came out hot and quick.  Water was kept full through the meal, and the music was really good.  I know it's a chain, but it's a good chain- and this location is the dog's pajamas!"
Mike S.,"Marlborough, MA",0,1,,5.0,1/9/2016,"So a bunch of drunkards walked in there from Kelly's across the street and they were loud as hell. When they walked in, someone yelled, ""Witness Me"" another danced on a table, one dude had a prison flashback, another guy said, ""Cut me Mickey"" and another dude screamed like Bruce Lee and they all broke a light. Well the waitress Hannah, in her goodness, said ""I can't let the customer be wrong. All the pain from our waitressing would be all for not."" And as she fought back her tears, she took the blame. I've never seen such selflessness. As she painted on the finest smile with her next family of customers, my waitress Mary Ann did nothing but comfort her coworker from the crushing defeat of being a good person. I've never seen such fine staff! Despite the adversity, despite the pain, they stuck together and still provided amazing service which I, A customer who is always right, will never forget! I will be returning to the Chili's on Prince street, if only to renew my faith in humanity. A faith I've since lost until today. Carry on Hannah and Mary Ann. Carry on my wayward daughters of everything good and noble. May others find bliss in the kindness you once should those drunk, ignorant bastards. 5/5 Stars."
Nick H.,"Clovis, NM",0,5,,3.0,1/21/2015,"The re-vamped menu is really well done (although still very chain-ish). The service is fine, depending on who you get. They claim to be working as ""partners"" with a neighboring server, but I have never once had another server refill a drink, pick up plates, etc. If you want to get a late-night drink, go somewhere else. The bartenders and bar service staff will start sweeping under your feet 30 minutes before closing time. The to go experience is almost always a good one."
Karla Y.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,6,2,1.0,5/24/2014,I was in Clovis for work and stopped at Chilis for  lunch.  I cannot rate the food as I was never served. I eventually left after waiting 20 minutes for someone to take my order.  I asked the host and two different waiters for help . One waiter kindly brought me a straw even though I had never been served a drink  or  even water!  This is one of my worst eating out experiences ever. I'm actually thankful I didn't end up eating anything. Who knows what the food would have been like!
Fred R.,"Durango, CO",0,2,,1.0,6/5/2014,Be very aware of the at table game. They add a dollar to your bill if you play. The added charge is cleverly hidden. Also they have changed the rib BBQ sauce to something that taste like ketchup.
Nikki B.,"Dallas, TX",2098,601,409,4.0,12/22/2010,"Chili's is a popular place in Clovis. It's crowded by 6pm most every night, and I can only guess why: - The food is good, consistent and priced well - Parking is easy and plentiful - Happy hour prices are good until 6pm, then again at 9pm, and during all professional football games - Their happy hour food deals include cheap appetizers like skillet queso for $3 and beef fajita nachos for $5. - Big domestic beers are $3.25 all day, M-F - Order a double, and its only 75 cents more My girl friend and I had 2 Worlds Freshest Margaritas (tequila, fresh lime juice and agave made to order), nachos and queso, and walked out of there for under $25 each with tip. I'll take that any day!"
Wayland F.,"Gilbert, AZ",119,33,,1.0,12/28/2013,"I typically visit Chili's at least once when visiting Clovis, and the food and service have always been good - until this time.  We ordered drinks and appetizers.  It probably took 10-15 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  When the appetizers came, we asked for small plates which never came the entire time.  We also had to get up and ask the hostess if we could get some silverware.  After a few minutes of waiting, she brought us children's rolled silverware (fork and napkin with no knife) because that's all they had left.  By this time, the boneless wings were cold - so our appetizers were not very appetizing.  While I realize it was a busy night, it was still some of the worst service I've ever received - we couldn't get refills of drinks or water in a timely manner and it even took forever to get our bill.  It's really sad when a customer has to get up and ask for silverware."
Lilia H.,"Bothell, WA",2,9,3,1.0,12/3/2013,"By far worst service ever! I am here on vacation, wanted to enjoy a drinks and the game. I directly asked to be seated near a screen to watch the game. I was moved 4 different times before being in an appropriate place. It was busy and dirty. I stepped over spilt food on my way to the bathroom. The bartender seems to not have any training either. Was over an hour to get anything!  Also clearly stated online and any other chili's I have been to has happy hour during NFL games. Not in this crap hole. After getting crappy drink after crappy drink we ordered dessert.  Took them 30 mins to bring that. The waitress just giggled and said oh I forgot. The only reason I LEFT a good tip is in hopes she will get better education or training. I'm completely disgusted with my experience here. Save your money if you are in Clovis and go to any other place if it's a game you are trying to enjoy."
Jennifer R.,"Clovis, NM",0,1,,1.0,1/26/2012,Well sitting here and I ordered the new sweet n spicy chicken and they decide to burn it on one side and hide it!!!! Wth ppl??? Then a manager hasn't even come to the table to express any kind of apology.... I'm over this place now won't be back!!!
