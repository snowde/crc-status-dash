Caroline C.,"Fort Lupton, CO",15,349,3042,4.0,10/5/2008,"Yup, it's Chili's (the haters can KMA). We ate here as there wasn't much else open in the area, I was craving a huge salad, and, quite honestly, I really like Chili's every now and again (*gasp!*).  I absolutely LOVE their Buffalo Chicken salad - it's enormous, filling, and always super fresh and crispy. He ordered a burger, medium-rare, and was told the rarest they could cook it was medium. Steaks, however, can be cooked however. Wtf?? How does that make any sense at all? He had Buffalo Chicken fajitas instead. They were good, like always, but he was kinda pissed off. The only thing that sets this Chili's apart from any other is the location, and its stunning views. Gorgeous."
