Efy E.,"San Antonio, TX",11,10,22,2.0,7/30/2017,"It doesn't seem to matter whether its the weekend or week day, the service is so slow... Sometimes the waiter/waitress seems to forget about their customers. And hour wait for food is ridiculous, if you're going to have to wait that long you'd think they'd let you know in advance or at least keep you updated with your order. And hour with no news about your order sucks!"
Renae P.,"Schertz, TX",742,87,138,4.0,1/2/2017,I like this Chilis. They have good customer service from their waitresses and that goes far because sometimes the food isn't the best but they are still friendly. It makes up for it. The margaritas are always good. Now I need one and should have ordered one with my lunch fajitas.
Terry P.,"San Antonio, TX",13,46,53,2.0,12/28/2016,Started with a to go service. Young lady rude. Advised to check with server to be  seated due to trying to use a coupon dine in only  my mistake however when I opted to dine in I was seated and forgotten for 8 minutes I then ask for a manager. A manager never showed up. I purchased my food and left. Still no manager. Lastly ws served water with a hint of lemonade in place of the strawberry lemonade I ordered. Server explanation it right next to the water. Very disappointed.
Rober B.,"El Paso, TX",15,2,,1.0,7/1/2017,"Poor reception. Hostess tried to seat a family of 3 adults, 1 child, and a baby in a small booth. When asked to get a bigger booth the hostess gave us an unprofessional attitude, we decided to leave."
Kay J.,"San Antonio, TX",569,281,658,1.0,5/27/2016,"Took my son here for lunch on his one hour lunch break.  It was noon on a Friday and sadly, empty restaurant.  I told our server (Tabitha) that we were in a hurry. She brought our drinks and then sat at a table with another server to chat (?!).  Two tables were sat after us and their (male) server served their meals before we even ordered!  I actually told him I wished he was our server. She finally took our orders and brought our so-so food (other tables were now leaving). After an entire hour, we paid and asked for ""to go"" drinks. She brought mine and forgot my sons. What the?!??  Total flake! No personality and does not belong in this business. Worst lunch experience- my son was 20 minutes late back to work. Chili's is going down the dumps.  It used to be super... so sad."
Austin N.,"Kerrville, TX",184,18,3,5.0,4/6/2017,"Jenifer At the to go counter just gave me and the customer in front of me some amazing southern hospitality, and awesome customer service.  Give that woman a raise!"
Lorena S.,"San Antonio, TX",17,26,4,1.0,10/4/2016,"This is our neighborhood location and on most nights it's a pleasant experience without having to go too far from home. Unfortunately, the last 2 visits have been so subpar that it's time to accept the reality that traveling an extra 5 miles may be worth it.  1. I'm allergic to onion which I make known upon arrival at any and every restaurant.  I understand the occasional slip where a server may not have realized onion was involved in a dish but... there was Pico de gallo on 2 of 3 dishes presented AFTER specifying my allergy. It then took so long to get a ""replacement "" order of beans and condiments, without onions, that my rice and entrée were cold.  2. It took over 35 minutes to receive an order of fajitas, at the empty bar, for unknown reasons. What's more upsetting is that the 2 patrons that did arrive after us...recieved and completed their meals (of fried chicken strips) before we even got our food.  3. The entire staff was un-attentive, spent more time talking in the kitchen and was very unprofessional. At one point, a server climbed on the chair next to me to reach over the bar instead of walking around. This is not only against safety measures but was not a pleasant sight to have in front of me. We've avoided this locations for months after walking out due to poor service and sadly won't be returning. The extra drive time for a better staff  is absolutely worth it."
Raven H.,"Converse, TX",124,83,442,1.0,12/6/2015,"There were maybe seven tables filled when I came in just looking for some quick fuel before grocery shopping. Nearly instant regret.  This place was just awfulll. Waitress came by for our drink orders,  water and a lemonade, we were brought tea and a sprite?  She slid them on the table so quickly we couldn't even get her attention to correct it.  Took about five minutes to flag her down and another five minutes for her to bring the correct drinks out at which point she finally took our orders.  I ordered the smoked bbq wings and a cup of loaded baked potato soup, my mother ordered the endless enchiladas they had on special.  The soup was good, nothing extraordinary.  The wings were itty bitty and barely had any meat to them,  I wasn't super hungry so this wasn't so upsetting, just something to keep in mind.  The enchiladas were the worsttt. We had requested the sides be substituted but of course staying true to preceeding service,  the wrong sides came out with the enchilada entree. Our waitress seemed irritated when we pointed it out, and we're rational people,  there are times when it is the kitchen's fault when orders come out wrong,  but c'mon. You had to look at the plate to bring it out, should've noticed something was wrong. She took it back, brought out the corrected order, and the tortillas on the enchildas were hard as a rockand ridiculously difficult to cut into.  We flagged down a manager who had been milling around amongst the four other slow moving waitstaff and complained about the entree. He offered no excuse or even a hint of sympathy, just an ""oh you don't like it? Uh. We can bring a different entree out."" But we just decided to cut our losses and bail.  Food 1/5 Service 1/5  Chance of Returning to this location 0/5"
Alyssa C.,"Schertz, TX",0,9,12,1.0,4/9/2017,Extremely slow service. Took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server. The hostess ended up getting our drink order in. I went the last half of my dinner without a refill. This isn't the first time this has happened at this location but it'll be the last -- won't be returning.
Andy J.,"Universal City, TX",30,47,103,4.0,7/1/2016,Service needs to improve when the crowd is low. Sorry around lunch time some people are in a hurry. I'm sure most would understand if busy you should be patient. Food is always good.
Domenic G.,"Houston, TX",71,5,1,2.0,4/27/2016,"This was the WORST Chili's I have Ever been to. The Service was slow, the bartender had a crappy attitude, here was no life in this place."
Laura M.,"Clovis, NM",29,60,174,1.0,11/20/2014,"Dear chili's - get rid of computers and bring back servers! Against the warnings of terribly slow service, my family and I arrived at this chili's at 5pm on a Thursday. It took nearly 4 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our presence and sit us, which folks in the food service industry know is way too long. (I was a server for 5 years) There was one other table in the dining area and two in the bar area. 3 servers made eye contact but none offered to seat us.  Once we were seated it was another 3-4 minutes before our waitress to take our drink order. Again, it's 5 pm and no one was there. Luckily we placed our daughters order as soon as we sat down because it was nearly an hour for our food to arrive. Our food was the correct temperature and was very tasty.  This is a common trend with chili's. The cut back of servers is blatantly obvious as the reliance on the tabletop computers have replaced good old fashion service. I've tried the chili's in the forum and 3009-same service speed. Sorry chili's the food was delish but not worth an hour wait in an uncrowded restaurant. Won't be spending my $ at this chain again."
Derek M.,"Austin, TX",11,79,24,3.0,7/11/2015,"I came in with my sis, Niece-in-Law, and my Great Niece and Nephew.  I actually had to ask someone to serve us after about thirty minutes.  The waitress stated she was the only one staffed. The food was good, and after the first acknowledgment, the staff was receptive and checking in from time to time. No bad on the staff, as they are obviously understaffed. I worked food service while in college..  Both staff and Mgmt...  I would have been fired; period!"
Baelyn G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,29,16,5.0,12/12/2015,We eat here all the time! Our server was Mariah tonight and I just wanted to give her props for providing great service to us and handling the picky douche bag at the table next to us professionally!
Naeanna L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2015,First impression matter. The service at this location is horrible.  Our waitress twice forgot to bring our drink order. She hasn't asked us if we need anything else.  It's like we're in quarantine at this table. What's up with that Chili's?
Christina C.,"Raeford, NC",0,6,,1.0,12/11/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This was by far the worst service I have received at any restaurant. I placed a drink order when we were first seated and within ten minutes two different people came over to ask about the drink. After asking the server about my drink 30 minutes later she said she would check on it. Ten minutes later she asked if it was frozen or on the rocks. That let me know for sure that it was not made. I finally received my drink 50 minutes after I placed the order and half way through dinner and it was not correct. I drank it anyway. The server apologized for the delay, but did not offer to compensate for the inconvenience. When I was ready to pay, I wanted to use the ziosk to receive points and submit a survey for the terrible service I endured. Unfortunately, a kid at another table was playing a game on the one that belonged to my table and accrued charges for those games on my bill. I informed the server and instead of taking the charges off she split the check for the difference.  This would not have been a problem if I was alone, however, I wanted to split the check with my friend and because she already used that option I was unable to do so. By that time I was so irritated and just wanted to get out of there, so I paid the entire check and l we left. I will never go back to this location and will happily drive out of the way to go somewhere else."
Diane S.,"Converse, TX",123,126,183,5.0,3/25/2014,I noticed the sign outside changes and we noticed it everything inside to include the decor and the uniforms have changed they have a cool new table top check out in order and trivia games option it's really great service was awesome food was fresh definitely recommend
J H.,"Converse, TX",39,58,4,1.0,4/2/2015,I come to this location because it's convenient for family and friends.  For the past three times they have messed up my order.  Slow service. I felt  like they're always working with short staff and feel forgotten. Like drinks are not refilled.    I like being able to psy at the table.     If you want a dinner at Chili's.. Go to the Forum location or. The Quarry... Service is ten times better!!!!
Tiburon M.,"San Antonio, TX",2,2,4,1.0,1/24/2015,"Had a couple of margie's , El Nino"" pretty good. Had the ""new"" mango margarita, just too sweet for me.  Definitely a slow night which makes me wonder how you screw an order... after all, it was just an appetizer.  Sour cream came out frozen. Ordered wings with bone and got boneless, I probably won't be returning. Generally don't frequent Chilli's... tonight was purely out of convenience!"
Matt L.,"Columbus, WI",23,12,20,2.0,7/2/2015,Slow service. We have been here when they are really good it's hit or miss though. But my wife loves this place so I guess I gotta deal with it
