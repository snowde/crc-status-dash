Rob S.,"Cumming, GA",0,32,,5.0,8/12/2017,"It seems my wife and I have been by this location a bijillion times, and finally decided to use our gift card given to us. We went in late afternoon to have an early bird dinner. Our server Shad was at our table quickly, brought cold drinks, and took our order promptly. My wife ordered the big baby back rib platter with 3 choices(baked BBQ chicken breast, Cheese smoked sausage with hot peppers inside, and garlic dill pickles with homefries on the side. I opted for the Bacon burger with all the works and melted cheddar cheese, garlic pickles, homefries etc. It is one of the new speciality platters on the new menu.  All were cooked perfect, delicious and temp hot. My wife's could not finish her platter but I will tell you Chili's knows how to do ribs, cheeseburgers, and salads quite well. If you go to this location, be sure to ask to sit in Shad's section. He will take excellent care of y'all's family and friends. I think he is the senior server. We left with big go cups w/o asking first....but our doggie bags for the later  was much appreciated . Our server was by several times to check in on us.....worth mentioning to those who look for this as we do. Is it nice nice to have a great dining out that was problem-free.....choose this location for a really great meal especially when you're powerful hungry !!"
Shannon D.,"Cumming, GA",63,113,121,2.0,11/5/2017,"What a mess! From foul language, to lights going out briefly, to having a tray of dirty plates being dropped by our feet, today had to be an off day. It was just NUTS.  The host greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to sit in the dining room or bar. My son and I opted for the dining area. We were conveniently seated by the kitchen. Cause what 8 year old doesn't love hearing the kitchen shenanigans?! People watch your mouth! This is a business strictly run on customer service! My son (and me) hearing f bombs, etc is unacceptable.  We started with ordering our drinks. Our server appeared overwhelmed and had to come back by to verify our drinks. That's fine, I'd rather her verify than bring the wrong thing. She was polite but just seemed so frantic. Actually, everyone seemed frantic.   After receiving our drinks we were greeted by a new server. He took our order; kid slider burgers with fries and chicken tacos no avocado. He was polite and got our order correct.  Our food arrived in a reasonable timeframe. The presentation was lacking and looked messy. However it tasted fine.  We waited longer than expected for drink refills.  The chips are not as I remember them, thin and crispy cantina style. We were never offered more salsa. We had to ask.  All in all, it was ok. But I expect better service. The game is now $1.99. What happened to 99 cents?!"
Genevieve R.,"Duluth, GA",480,5,,5.0,9/22/2017,I had the yummy chicken crispers and waffles. They were great and the service was Good!
Eric L.,"Cumming, GA",48,13,1,3.0,6/20/2017,6-19-17 Had the buffalo chicken salad with extra blue cheese crumbles & extra wing sauce. Very good and I would recommend it/order it again. This is the second very good salad I've had here. Next time I would ask for grilled chicken instead of fried simply for health reasons. We also had the chips & salsa appetizer as it was a late lunch and we were very hungry. The chips were very oily and I would not order them again. Our waitress who was also the bartender was good and friendly.
Cindy T.,"Cumming, GA",0,1,,3.0,9/20/2017,"Food was good. Gave 3 stars due to service. Had to ask for silverware, then napkins, then more chips, then more water.  They were not busy so not sure what the deal was."
Darren W.,"Chattanooga, TN",1,74,61,3.0,2/25/2017,"Went somewhat late and maybe this was a little bit of the problem, but slow service, disgraced server/bartender.  Seemed more focused on chatting with dude than taking care of me and my fellow worker.  Props to the chef though- had a burger and a salad- super good and great portions.  The cheese curds were on point- good portion and tasted great!  The salad was big enough I took some with me.  The Texas lemonade while good is overpriced at 7.50, would not order again- wasn't that good and was too high priced."
Mark R.,"Cumming, GA",4,53,1,2.0,12/29/2016,"Notice the trend lately? I have eaten here for years... last week...  Was given the wrong food for one person. No one to talk to when discovered . Ate it.  After our food was dropped without time to talk, went scavenging for :  - Napkins, had none.  - Ketchup,  had none  - Filled our water from a pitcher I found.  Waiter explained he was sorry he was busy preparing for shift change ( It was 4:20 when he said that). Watched the manager looking guy smoke outside while waiting for the bill. Then waiting for the check. Same waiter, I guess he was preparing for shift change at 5."
Rebecca H.,"Cumming, GA",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2017,"We have visited this particular Chili's many many times over the years. Within, I'd say the last 3-4 years, the food quality has gone WAY WAY down.  We went tonight to celebrate my birthday with my family. We were seated quickly and our drinks were brought out in good time. We ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa. This has been a staple appetizer for us to get for years. The chips tasted old and burned and the salsa was so watery it wouldn't even stay on the chips. The rest of the food was equally as bad. My husband and I shared the fajitas and honestly, I haven't tasted anything that bad in long time. This has been occurring over and over. We should have stuck with ordering soup and a salad. That seems like it would be hard to mess up. Either way. We're done with this Chili's. After going there for as long as its been here, we will never ever go back. EVER."
Allison D.,"Cumming, GA",1,5,2,1.0,10/8/2017,"Awful! We were seated quickly but the waitress disappeared. Had to get up to find someone to take our order. Found two managers with arms crossed chit chatting who summoned someone else to take our order. Margarita I ordered was all lime juice and watered down. Our appetizer arrived which was decent until we found an adhesive tab to some type of bag IN OUR FOOD. Again, had to get up to find someone who finally came over and asked if we wanted another one. I said how about an apology? He reluctantly said ""sorry"".... we decided to get up and leave. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. I noticed their health rating of 88 on the way out."
Shari H.,"Cumming, GA",0,4,,1.0,7/4/2017,"I have had 2 bad experiences at this Chili's, I am DONE!! The first time, we didn't eat the fried pickle appetizer because they were mushy; we told our server & she did not offer to take off the bill. Toward the end of our meal, I asked for a to go box and when she brought it, she took my food away!! When I questioned her she offered to have the kitchen cook 1/2 order for me; I declined because we were rushing to get to a movie. I called the next day to complain to manager, he insisted on sending comp cards, only I never received. The second time (2 weeks ago), we got seated pretty quick but did not get greeted by server for a good 5 minutes. She took our drink order and after another 10 minutes of not seeing her, we got up & left, straight to Cheeseburger Bobbies. I am pretty understanding in certain situations, as I used to serve (5 1/2 years at Chilis many years ago), but these two situations are both ridiculous."
NerdoLoco H.,"Atlanta, GA",6,114,5,2.0,11/10/2016,"We only went here because we received a gift card from a friend.  Needless to say, we have $41 left on the card and we won't be returning to use it.  Food, atmosphere, scary waitress, cleanliness, it was all awful."
Aaron L.,"Cumming, GA",19,12,6,2.0,7/11/2016,"Won't be returning. Wish we'd read the previous reviews.  Seated us quickly on a Sunday a bit after noon. The table was filthy - the 4 other empty tables around us were just as dirty (food crumbs) and had to ask for it to be cleaned.  Appetizer arrived with the meal. Baked loaded fries, kids pizza, chicken crisspers were all over cooked and appeared as though they had been sitting under heat lamps for some time.  The celery sticks all had brown rotten ends.  1 of the orders was wrong - wrong style crispers.  The server worked hard and maintained a great attitude - enough for me get past my personal prejudice against being served food by people with multiple facial jewelry."
Shelby N.,"Kennesaw, GA",1,4,,3.0,5/7/2016,"Don't come here on Cinco de Drink-O. They were under staffed. Had to call management in. Server was crying the whole time. It was a mess.  Love the margs, those helped my nerves :)"
Michelle B.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,6,,5.0,7/22/2016,"My friends and I decided to go to Chilis in Cumming and the bartender Masaki was there and I haven't been back in a long time due to work and when I sat down, there he was with my drink ! He had remembered after all this time ! He had that smile on his face and was very very pleasant ! Thank you again! What a great bartender ! Michelle"
Terry V.,"Atlanta, GA",30,52,5,1.0,11/21/2015,"This was probably the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. When we were seated we waited 15 minutes before our waitress took our drink orders. When she returned to the table, she gave one of us a Pale Ale rather than the ordered IPA. In addition she discovered their was no chocolate mile, so she suggested the cherry Coke instead...really.  Next she took the order. We waited between 35 and 40 minutes for the meal to arrive. The fish tacos were under cooked. The boneless wings were hard and cold. The only things that were good were the man n cheese and the mashed potatoes. Even the French fries were cold. As we were eating the waitress did come by the table and say she was normally at 10 but today she was a 7 because it was crazy in the restaurant. Personally I would give her a 4.  It would really be hard for me to ever frequent this restaurant again."
Tony A.,"Roswell, GA",57,5,3,1.0,9/9/2016,We waited for a table for 10 minutes while the place was virtually empty watching three people stare at each other and the messy table no one wanted to clear. I couldn't take witnessing the laziness so we left. Poorly managed.
Lindsey S.,"Cumming, GA",1,17,16,4.0,5/13/2016,"Upon arrival we did wait 5-6 minutes before we were acknowledged and seated. During that time multiple staff members walked by instead of seating us. Luckily, we had an amazing waiter! I got one of their new Tex-mex bowls, while my boyfriend got their appetizer sampler. The food was delicious and priced reasonably. The whole menu looked new compared to when we used to come. The waiter said the menu changes every 4-6 months but the favorites and Chili's staple dishes stay. Some people might dislike that if their dish goes away, but I love the idea of always being able to try something new. They go out of their way to have a large variety of healthy options! Their new little table side machines are extremely convenient and prevents the long wait to get the check, which is one thing that drives me crazy. You are able to order food and drinks, pay your check, and even let the little ones play games on the device at the table."
Chris V.,"Sandwich, MA",1,21,4,2.0,5/13/2016,Past few times we've been here service and quality has seriously declined. Smaller portions at increased prices. They are more concerned with flipping table than customer service. We had consistent issues and not once did any manager attempt to check on us. Very disappointed.
Justin M.,"Cumming, GA",0,30,7,2.0,6/10/2016,"Ribs with no meat, drinks with hardly any alcohol, dry salad. Service was good however. Believe the menu has just gone south for this chain. Better off at going elsewhere - I left hungry."
Kevin Y.,"Flowery Branch, GA",207,456,963,4.0,7/6/2014,"Have to say I was quite pleased with the service and food at this location.  Good waitress sat us, hit us drinks quick- the tropical margarita was really good! Had a quesadilla salad and a special- 2 for $8 enchilada and taco and it was really tasty.  Not too loud, excellent service, and great food quality. I'll be back to this location."
Eric V.,"Goshen, NY",53,10,,1.0,5/30/2016,I'll keep it simple. Turkey burger tasted crappy. Didn't eat it. Cheesecake serve frozen like a rock on a plate hot enough to burn your hands. Replace with a new piece that will burn your mouth on a plate that was neutral to the touch. Chef needs to go back to school to learn how to plate and serve cheesecake.
K T.,"Suwanee, GA",1,33,,1.0,1/1/2016,"We really like Chili's but this location is the worst! For dine in this location has never not made us wait less than 15 minutes from sitting down to drink orders...just drinks, even if they are empty. Tell the server you are ready to order food and they will make you wait more, saying ""I'll be right back to take the rest of your order."" ""Right back"" is a relative term at this location, expect at least a 10 minute wait from there. That equals 25 minutes from sitting to placing order, even if you knew exactly what you wanted when sitting down. We have tested this theory on multiple occasion and we are done. We even started going when we weren't even hungry, because we knew by the time we received food we would be. Try any other location but stay away from this one unless you want to wait. On a side note, on the way to the restroom, never look to the right, you can see right into the kitchen and the counter tops and floors alone will make you rethink your dining decision."
Mike B.,"Cumming, GA",0,13,,3.0,11/8/2015,"Disappointed in the food!  I had a Buffalo Chicken  salad and the chicken was over cooked to the point that it broke into when I tried to cut it with a knife.  It also took  a long to get the salad,everyone else had already gotten their meals a good ten minutes,which were cooked meals,before I  got my salad."
Patrick F.,"Fort Mill, SC",33,10,1,2.0,8/5/2015,Decent service...poor food quality even for Chili's.  Took two bites of the disgusting smoked chicken burrito.  Not one person asked how it was or why o was ready to pay and leave without touching my food.  Even offered me dessert...as if I'd be that brave.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.
Lou G.,"Alpharetta, GA",723,644,623,2.0,8/21/2012,"I like Chili's, but this location is always hit or miss when it comes to service. I have experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly here. My last visit was four kids and me. We were told fifteen minutes for a table, and handed a vibrator (not the kind on late night shopping channel). I went to wash my hands and saw two empty tables in the center. Upon my return I asked if we could sit at any of these two open tables, the red headed hostess told me that she did not want to ""kill"" the kitchen.  Questions: 1. Why are we the only party waiting? 2. Why fifteen minutes? 3. Why am I holding this vibrator? So I am i really to believe that a party of five could potentially kill the kitchen crew? This place has had a lot of money dumped in to remodel it, too bad they kept the same employees. ""Manson, party of five, your table is ready"" (Scary music playing, demonic laughter...buwahahahah)"
Blake W.,"Cumming, GA",23,9,3,2.0,6/25/2015,"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat.  The recipes have changed, the service has gone downhill, and the business refused to get wi-fi.  The manager told me that this is to discourage people from staying too long.  I work during lunches preparing for meetings and reviewing accounts.  There is a simple solution to the ""stay too long"" problem.  I will choose to eat elsewhere...  It is sad how far down this business had gone.  They used to be a 3-4 time per week favorite..."
Lena L.,"Cumming, GA",0,3,4,1.0,7/22/2016,"One big word: FILTHY. I'm a regular at this location... Unfortunately... I love chili's salsa and tableside guacamole. But this location has been disgusting for its antisanitary conditions. There can be 6 unclean tables in one sitting area at a time. The servers can juggle dirty plates and the food that's coming out in one hand allowing cross contamination. I usually come in by myself, so I have observed a pattern where the servers, seeing that, do not rush to serve me. This has happened on multiple occasions, regardless whether the restaurant is busy or not. Last time was particularly horrible, where I put in the order for food and drinks at the same time (after a 10-minute wait at the table), and the drink arrived 20 minutes later. The tableside guac took even longer (so much for an appetizer). Finally, I ordered the Caribbean salad with grilled shrimp. The 'grilled' shrimp was cold (!). I started eating the salad and noticed a piece of chicken in it (I didn't ask for that bonus), which was either chewed up, having fallen off a dirty plate or another plate from a table that was served simultaneously. I have attached a picture of that here. That was nauseating to say the least, I stopped eating at once and checked out, nobody came to check on me. When the survey popped up on the zyosk screen, I started to type all this, only to end up with the zyosk reloading in the middle of it and going back to the home screen with no option for leaving a survey. I attribute it to the fact that I was next to the server's station, and they could have looked over my shoulder to see what I was doing, and controlled the zyosk from their computer, but I can't be 100% sure of that, I don't know how this stuff works. All I know is that the quality of food leaves much to be desired, I don't even wanna think about the condition of their kitchen, customers get ignored, tables don't get cleaned promptly, while the whole crew wastes time they claim they don't have to come out every time to sing the horrible happy birthday song! I don't celebrate birthdays at places like this, but I would recommend those that do, think twice. You don't wanna poison your birthday child or make your guests sick!"
Chris H.,"Alpharetta, GA",27,3,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Ugg.  Wanted to like this Chili's .. especially since we always have a mediocre experience at the one on Windward Pkwy.  They were busy for a Monday night but we were seated right away.  Our server (with blue hair) started off well enough.  Took our drink and appetizer order quickly enough.  We did the 2 for $35 deal with the Presidente margarita.  While we ate our meal the place emptied out pretty well and a family sat in the booth next to us.  After we finished our meals, and pushed our plates to the edge of the table because no one would come clear the table, the server attended to the new couple at least 4 times (water, take drink order, bring drinks) and didn't once check on us.  I finally had to yell across the restaurant to get her attention so we could place our dessert order and place a to-go order for the kids at home.  SOOO frustrating.  Then we asked for chips and salsa to go.  ""Oh sure, I'll bring that right out.""  Wasn't until after we got in the car that we noticed that she didn't give us the to-go chips.  I go back in and she just hands them to me.  No ""Gosh sorry about that.""  Or ""I'm sorry you had to come back in.""  Nothing .. and then when she noticed I was agitated she gave me a sarcastic ""Merry Christmas.""  Stupid millennials."
Julieanne O.,"Cumming, GA",5,9,3,4.0,10/20/2015,We get Chili's to go once every two weeks.  Allison is awesome. I only have order issues when she is not working. I have not been inside in months so I can only comment on curbside TOGO. And I am a fan.
Marykay A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2015,"This was the worst dining experience that I have had in many years. We waited at least 20 minutes to get a table for 7. It was not even busy. The table was dirty. The waitress took 25 minutes to greet us. Then left for another 5 minutes. We finally got drinks and ordered. We waited 40 minutes to get our food without the waitress ever checking in us. My son ordered a beer. When it came, she dumped it on the table and left. It was the wrong kind. She said that our food would be out  in 30 seconds. It was 10 minutes. When our food came, it was either raw or crisp. We had finally had enough and asked for the check. It was another 5 minutes. She apologize and said that she was normally a 10 as a server but today she was only a 7. We gave her a 2. Will never go back. I suggest you never go the first time."
Elijah C.,"Buford, GA",2,14,1,3.0,1/24/2015,"When me, my dad, and my brother go out to eat, this is usually where we end up. I'm 12 and I've been going here since I was 9. I like the boneless buffalo wings, the Monterey chicken, and the big mouth bites. (After I remove the onions) Service stinks. If you wanna be STARVING by the time your food actually arrives then this is your place."
Staci D.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,1,,1.0,8/1/2014,Service was terrible! Food was over cooked and took way to long. The place was disgusting including the floors and bathrooms!
Christina F.,"Cumming, GA",6,57,,1.0,6/24/2012,This location is always filthy and I won't be going back after last visit. The guy who seated us spent at least 5 minutes wiping his nose with the back of his hand before seating us. This is the first person you see when you walk in; if they don't care that he's doing that  I don't even want to imagine what's going on in the kicthen that we can't see.  Normally I like Chili's but this particular location is just dirty and not managed well.
Greg B.,"Buford, GA",0,16,,1.0,1/19/2015,"My family and I have been eating at this Chili's since we moved down here 3 years ago, and while it isn't as good as some of the other Chili's restaurants around here, I had never had a bad enough experience there to compel me to write a bad review - until now. First off, we had five sets of silverware and every single fork was filthy. I'm talking completely encrusted with food, bbq sauce and who knows what else. We were brought new silverware and 3 of the 5 of those sets were completely dirty. We really should have walked out right there but the waiter was nice enough to go to the back and wash the silverware for us. He told us on three occasions that the manager would be out to talk to us. Well, the manager never bothered to come to our table. This will be our last visit to this Chilli's and I plan on writing a letter to the corporate office today."
Andy B.,"Cumming, GA",4,13,2,1.0,11/10/2013,Service sucked my order took almost 30 minutes to come out got tired of waiting and took it to go... they comped 19.02 off my bill which would not have been necessary if they had their acts together.  The waitress was slow and knocked up and was happy on steroids which I find annoying. ...overall this chilis sucks and I will go to applebees down the road
Sue B.,"Cumming, GA",3,16,2,1.0,1/31/2015,"Food was good but much smaller in portion size compare to other Chili's in GA or out of state.   Waitress was the sweetest&overall nice.   Worse experience was it took a very long time for our food&how it was abruptly, rudely&nasty the person who delivered it to our table.   He interrupted us, demanding to know who's ordered what&saying its hot!!!#   He then dropped a plate on our table just starred at us rudely for not answering quick enough.   Wow, we eat out alot & never experienced this weird approach before in matter of seconds."
Ken G.,"Dawsonville, GA",34,60,13,4.0,5/28/2014,Great place to grab a drink at the bar. Enjoyable service. Even have a special of free salsa and chips. What else can ya want.
Karen H.,"Chattanooga, TN",9,65,6,4.0,3/27/2014,Good food and service. The spicy grilled shrimp tacos are amazing as well as their guacamole appetizer.
Adam C.,"Cumming, GA",0,18,,4.0,3/23/2012,"It is a Chili's.  Of all the Chili's I have been to, this one is absolutely no different than the others. Food is served, as well as drink. The chili pepper itself is somewhat absent from the menu, save for iconographical status.  The baby back ribs are delicious, and you will find yourself singing that d*mn song in your head, if not out loud. In fact, you're probably doing it right now. Did you know that Scientists have determined that the Baby Back Ribs Song was the first meme? It quickly spread across America and into neighboring countries. There are documented examples of tribes along the Amazon river, that have had no contact with the outside world, dancing and singing, ""I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back..."" They have no concept of the meaning of their words, but they know the subtle harmony brings good crops and keeps them safe from danger. This is the power of Chili's.  tl;dr - It's a Chili's. Get the ribs."
Shaun W.,"Atlanta, GA",47,65,7,3.0,7/31/2013,Standard Chili's grub and service. Always a good spot for a quick bite to eat and some drinks.
