Carlos C.,"Suwanee, GA",181,106,3,4.0,10/17/2010,"Service was fast and friendly, though they were extremely busy on a Sunday afternoon. The food here is well done; better than other Chili's in the ATL that I've been to.  Enjoyed the server; the meals (Chicken crispers, shrimp quesadilla salad, mac and cheese--my 5 yr old devoured it!--and the 2 for $20 deal with one appetizer to share.   Alcohol is cheap!  Woohoo!!! Pepperation baby!"
Monica S.,"Buford, GA",0,3,,1.0,3/16/2015,Never had a great experience at this location to begin with. Went in for an early lunch and sat at the bar and waited for about 6 minutes before someone acknowledged me and not a bartender in sight (or really anyone for that matter). I was greeted by a manager who told me she was too busy with togo orders and so I ordered my app. and drink from him. As I wait for my app. a server comes and asks me if I'm ok and would like to order anything else and I said I would wait until my appetizer arrived. When I got my app not one person came by to ask if I wanted to order or to even ask if everything was ok. At this point I still haven't even seen the bartender or a manager. I was so furious that I got the check and left and lost my appetite. Apparently togo food is more important than your dine in customers. Waste of money and ruined my lunch. I will never come back here again after all the bad experiences I've had here.

Jason B.,"Cumming, GA",16,13,1,5.0,7/9/2009,"This particular Chilis is fantastic.  We've been going there since it first opened and find it extremely consistent.  If the family is indecisive about a place to eat, Chilis is always the agreeable answer for us.   The Chicken Club Tacos are outstanding! It also seems to have one of the more lively bars of the restaurants in town."
Brent M.,"Suwanee, GA",4,9,,3.0,12/26/2010,"Chilis gets 3 stars.  Only for consistency, and a some what decent beer selection. All their meals have like 35 grams a fat+ that includes the salads."
Keisha J.,"Cumming, GA",13,79,105,5.0,1/30/2009,"I've never been disappointed by this Chili's, as i have been at a few of their other locations. They know how to make a rib-eye steak, Longhorn better watch out. I refuse to go through another awful drive thru for a burger combo, ahem Burger King *cough cough*, for the same price I can get a burger and fries to go, and drink some water. And if there were a yelp review for water I'd give it 1 star thats how much I dislike it. So if I'm willing to drink water with my dinner without a gun to my head, then you know it's good!"
Aubrey S.,"Orlando, FL",0,91,2,4.0,1/25/2012,"Chili's, at all locations, has consistently good ribs, burgers and country fried steak.  I can only speak to those dishes.  I would have to assume you probably could not find anything on their menu that wouldn't be as good."
Lee H.,"Cumming, GA",0,13,,1.0,3/18/2012,"Have eaten at the Cumming Chili's numerous times because other family members seem to like it. However, my last visit will be just that: My last visit. This restaurant is usually noisy and not very clean. The service is generally good but the food quality varies from fair to poor. My last meal was the Caribbean Salad with shrimp. When it was served, I thought I smelled something bad but took a bite of the shrimp anyway. It was mushy, tasted terrible and had a foul, spoiled seafood odor. It was also undercooked. The kitchen had to know they were serving something inedible but apparently didn't care. I returned the salad and asked for the version with chicken as a replacement. They served the replacement with no comment or apology for the bad food. Also, after serving bad food, most restaurants would have comp'ed the meal to placate the customer but Chili's did not. I will not be back. Ever."
