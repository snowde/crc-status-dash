Hillary V.,"Dawsonville, GA",0,31,,4.0,1/8/2018,"Last two times we have eaten here have been great! Steak cooked perfectly, much much better than longhorn. Great service also."
Kevin K.,"Gainesville, GA",0,17,,2.0,12/17/2017,"Food was marginal at best - mashed potatoes were like warm and my wife's grilled chicken dish had a hint of Fish flavor- our server, Joshua was super."
Listiani H.,"Cumming, GA",33,56,197,4.0,9/4/2017,"We came yesterday on Labor Day weekend and waited for around 20 minutes. Server is very accomodating and attentive. The pita salad is awesome, as well as the three items fajitas. The whole baby back ribs with dry rubs sauce is just okay though. We'll definitely be back if we go to North GA premium outlet again"
Michael R.,"Dawsonville, GA",3,19,4,2.0,10/28/2016,"Open tables but a 45 minute wait. What?  Sat at the bar.  Bartenders where friendly but clueless. Drinks took 10 minutes. Appetizers 23 min. Dinner was 1 hour. Had to keep asking to find out where our food was and when It would arrive.  Sorry, it's a Chilis and not the Ritz.  Clean up your act or you will quickly loose your clientele. May not be back but we will see."
Curtis E.,"Cumming, GA",0,7,,1.0,10/29/2017,"The word heard most for my online order was ""sorry"" They didn't have the food I ordered, sorry. Didn't give me the drinks I ordered. Sorry.  One more sorry. Sorry I ordered."
Michael L.,"Dawsonville, GA",0,40,20,5.0,9/15/2017,"I'm not usually big on chain joints, and the food here is about what you'd expect from a Chili's.  Good, but not mind-blowing or anything.  However, what's earning them a 5-star review tonight is the service.  Our waitress was great - polite and prompt.  The funny thing that happened though was, my wife ordered the Triple Dipper and the for some weird reason one of the two sliders had no burger patty.  It was mostly just funny, but the manager came out and apologized and we all had a laugh about it.  Of course they replaced the sliders for free, but the good humor about the whole thing made the experience great.  Good service and good management got the 5-stars from us tonight."
Bryan B.,"Atlanta, GA",8,214,1,2.0,1/29/2017,"Where to start?!?  My wife and I went by on Wednesday and it was a 30 minute wait.  The hostess kept telling us and others that they were short handed because they didn't think a Wednesday would be busy and didn't plan enough staff.  After about five minutes we left and went to another restaurant. We returned on Saturday and was quoted a 30 minute wait.  The hostess said ""it's busy because it's Saturday.""  After 30 minutes I asked her for a status and she said that her manager asked her to slow down on seating people because the kitchen was backed up.  At about 35 minutes, we were seated.  Took about 15 more minutes before waitress acknowledged us and asked for drink order.  The chips, water, soft drinks came out in reasonable time, but my beer took 20 minutes.  Food came out about 20 minutes after that.  And, my food had a hair in it, so another 10 minutes to replace it. All-in-all, it took 2 hours and 9 minutes from when we walked in to when we walked out (and there were only two of us).  Food was tasty, at least.  Waitress was nice and apologeti, but all of the issues were mostly out of her control (except the long wait on the beer....think she just forgot about that). And, some of the waitresses were complaining loudly about the restaurant, the situation and they weren't making enough money to deal with a night like that.    I actually really like Chili's.   Hope this location can get it's act together soon."
Alex N.,"Douglasville, GA",0,1,2,2.0,2/18/2017,Nice service! The food was pretty good but the bread was definitely burnt. They also attempted to hide it.  Some peoples food came out cold and was very distasteful.
Mandie D.,"Dawsonville, GA",35,1,,1.0,8/1/2017,"I was very displeased with this place... I ordered a salad, the server got my order wrong, but I am never one to complain. So while I was eating my salad an almost dead fly crawled out of the center of it... I completely lost my appetite! After telling the server about it, she asked me if I wanted to do anything about it?!?!? Seriously! I told her no that I've already eaten half of it, I just now lost my appetite, she still charged me for it and went on with her business. Not once did she come to our table to ask how the food was, nor did she ever come to refill our beverages... for it being a new place, it sure is going down hill quickly!"
Ken G.,"Dawsonville, GA",34,60,13,4.0,7/10/2017,Stopped in for lunch on a Monday. Clean not busy at all. Food was good and service was good also. Definitely will give it a try again.
Nicole T.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",54,1,,3.0,8/12/2017,"The host this evening was amazing told me it would be 10 mins. Even though it took a little longer than expected she was very adamant about finding a booth for me and it definitely make me feel welcome. If you want the best experience at this  location I would most definitely ask for Josh. He  suggested appetizers, drinks specials and dessert. You could tell he was knowledgeable about the menu. He had a Pleasant attitude through the whole visit. The reason why I give it a 3 is because the food was not that great  but I will Be returning for the service because I haven't feel that welcome in a restaurant in a long time."
Matt B.,"Dawsonville, GA",0,1,,1.0,4/23/2017,"The service was the model of mediocre. Each time the staff came to the table, it was different indifferent staff. We saw ""our waiter"" all of twice.   Next time I will try to remember to order a side of burger with my grease. The mess they call a burger had slid across my plate requiring ""assembly"". Even the bun was soaked in grease. There were pools of grease on the plate that turned into congealed grossness as it cooled. I couldn't make it through half the burger and have been sick to my stomach all night. Sure am glad I got to pay for that hot mess. Without a doubt, the WORST restaurant in Dawsonville...  I use the term restaurant loosely."
Will P.,"Cumming, GA",1,14,3,2.0,10/16/2016,"Disappointing. Was looking forward to this new location in Dawsonville, just down the street from the North GA Outlets. Lots of new growth in the area and being very familiar w/the Chili's in Cumming (which has their act together) I had high expectations. Sunday 10-16-16, between 2pm-4pm wasn't busy, yet we waited 45min for our food only to find semi-cold, under cooked fajita veggies, stringy-tough steak and shrimp that were the size of dimes. Waitstaff and baby-faced mgmt. looked stressed and congregated around a server station, seemed like the kitchen staff was the issue. Staff was good, shame the food was a C- at best. Head over to Ruby Tuesdays by the outlet mall, exceptional staff and at least they get 'Americana Trough Food' right with a smile. Will not return."
Greg P.,"Dawsonville, GA",3,16,2,1.0,2/9/2017,Loud...Terrible service...below average food quality...  The other reviews are spot on. Hope they get it together. Chilis corporate needs to step in. This place needs help.
CK G.,"Cumming, GA",0,18,2,2.0,5/17/2017,Service was ok. Food was not good. We came in for lunch was steady not very busy. Ordered smoked chick quesadilla it was horrible! My wife ordered the lunch fajitas again very disappointing chicken tasted old and way to many onions and peppers. We where never checked on again after our server dropped off the food. Manager was never seen. Paid our bill and told our server we were not pleased.
Tami T.,"Dawsonville, GA",37,11,9,2.0,5/13/2017,"I was excited to see a new place to eat in Dawsonville... not impressed. Needs a new menu.  Our waitress was nice, only good thing about our visit."
Rachel P.,"Cumming, GA",90,4,,1.0,12/20/2016,"We went for dinner tonight because I was craving the montarey chicken meal.  We walked in and the restaurant was only about a third full as we go out to eat fairly early with our 1 and 3 year old. The hostess treated us as if we were a nuisance and when I asked if we could place the high chair in a different place than where she wanted it gave me big hulabaloo about fire codes and what not. I just wanted my son to be able to see the TV as he really likes to see the men playing sports even though is only 1 almost 2. After we worked that out our waitress approached us with a huge smile and told us she would be right with us.  This is when I asked her if they still had kids menus and crayons as we weren't given those or silverware by our hostess. She said yes and brought them back fairly quickly.  I thought we were on the road to having a nice dinner but the assistant manager approached us and asked my husband, who is a part of the barefoot society and chooses not to wear shoes, if he had shoes he could put on and stated that it was against health codes to be in the restaurant without them. Well, my husband loves to debate this because there really isn't a ""law"" that states you have to wear shoes in public establishments. The assistant manager had no patience for us and immediately cut him off and said we would not receive service unless he has shoes on.  My husband asked for the manager/owner's contact info and said he would put on his shoes if he got this info. He intended to contact the manager/owner at a later date about this. My husband went to the car and retrieved the sandals he keeps in there for these occasions.  Then we sat there and waited for about 15 minutes and no one came to our table or even by our table. So at this point we've probably been there with a 1 and a 3 year old for around 20 minutes with nothing to eat or drink. Finally I said let's just go and eat somewhere else.  Before we walked out I saw the manager in the back of the store so I decided to let him know we were leaving and why.  He said they never came back to the table because my husband didn't have shoes on.  He said his waitress checked.  I asked him if sandals count as shoes and he said yes. So, I'm guessing when they were ""checking"" my husband's feet for shoes from across the restaurant they didn't notice the sandals he had on his feet and were just assuming he wouldn't put shoes on.  Wow, just wow.  I don't know how this place will stay in business with service like this.   Save yourself some time and money and go to Kroger across the street who has a very nice bistro with super nice staff that was happy to serve my family with or without shoes.  LOL! Merry Christmas everyone...do yourself a favor and don't eat here."
Jessica G.,"Gainesville, GA",131,2,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Zero stars... Horrible service.   We walked in on a Thursday around 7pm, there were two of us and our two year old, and we were told the wait would be 5-10 minutes.   We weren't seated until 20 minutes.   After we were seated, we sat an additional 10 minutes and we were never even acknowledged; however, we had 4 different waiters walk past us to sing happy birthday to another table.   When we brought it to their attention, no one apologized or acted like anything was wrong.   Spoke to the manager just to let her know and she simply said ""yea I can see how that would be frustrating"". We left and will never be back to this location."
Ashleigh H.,"Buford, GA",34,10,,1.0,12/9/2016,"I will NEVER be coming to chilis again. Horrible horrible service - management, please do not let your servers work by themselves if they are new.... it doesn't make any sense! There were 5 of us eating at Thai establishment, and every single persons food came out wrong and tasted horrible. Honestly, our experience was so bad I never want to eat at chilis ever again. We were so excited about having one in Dawsonville and all it ended up being was a huge disappointment! Save your money and eat somewhere else."
Michael L.,"Dawsonville, GA",5,109,34,1.0,10/25/2016,"Didn't even make to a table... There was no one waiting, yet we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for 4 people. Really now, with empty tables. So, we walked out. Good luck with that, Chili's."
Kerri P.,"Dawsonville, GA",12,11,11,2.0,11/5/2016,"Well this is my second visit to the newest restaurant chain in town (Dawsonville) and I'm not very impressed. Ordered a grass fed burger and it was like no other grass fed beef I've ever had. That is not positive thing because it was not lean and did not have that earthy real good beef flavor. It was VERY greasy and had tons of grizzle. Needless to say I sent it back. Our waitress, bless her heart, may not have been trained very well to be a server. They were busy because it is Saturday night but I had to remind her to bring our appetizer, we never got napkins, I had to ask the hostess for them, no refills on our drinks, and after I sent my food back I ate some of my husband's fajitas without a plate. The ketchup was empty and I had asked for extra pickles with my burger that they waitress never brought. Good thing I sent the burger and fries back. Speaking of the fries, they were good. My 7 y/o was with us and she ordered the kids pizza. I took a bite and it was not good either. Even she didn't like it and she will pretty much eat any kind of pizza without complaint. She ate my fries and corn on the cob which I suppose was okay. Overall the experience was less than mediocre. We won't be back, sorry Chili's this is a loss for you. Just got our bill, our kid was Looking in the little screen thing in the table and they charged is $1.99 for ""table entertainment"". This place is crazy!  Don't let your kids touch it or you'll be paying."
Duane R.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,,5.0,11/27/2016,Went on a Saturday for lunch.  Sat in bar and had good service and food while watching college football.
Morgan L.,"Prineville, OR",0,1,,1.0,4/15/2017,Literally the worst dining experience I've ever had. Service was so slow with bad attitudes. My grilled chicken was the inedible; I'm not even sure it was real chicken. Never going back.
H N P.,"Roswell, GA",15,58,3,2.0,3/31/2017,I don't like to give Chilis a poor review because typically we have great food and great service. Here we had average service and poor food. The bacon in the BLT was like jerky and the tomatoes were tasteless. My Sante fe salad was average at best. Corporate needs to get involved here as this is a growing retail area.
Gail N.,"Perry, GA",0,44,,1.0,11/18/2016,"The waitress was attentive and very sweet. That was the only positive. I ordered fajitas and I noticed that the wood (that the actual skillet sits on) was smeared with old, dried food all over it. I could tell it had not been cleaned between uses. My husband's was the same way. CLEAN the dishes!"
Alan A.,"Dawsonville, GA",0,7,,1.0,10/11/2016,Remember when chilies was pretty good say around early 80's? What the hell happened?!?!?! Did Applebee's buy em out and replace all their food with frozen bar appetizers! You call that fajitas?? For two? Ribs were probably OK three days ago when they were first cooked and was that ketchup slathered all over them or a sorry excuse for bbq sauce? I can't believe they spent all that money for rent on a nice building and still serve up the same disgusting slop as all the other stores! At least you don't have to drive all the way to cumming or Gainesville to over pay for such a lousy meal!
Dennis R.,"Chardon, OH",0,13,,4.0,11/1/2016,Food was great. We ate lunch and had Molten Chocolate Cake. Fantastic desert. Service was so so.
