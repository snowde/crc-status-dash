Pooja K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",46,282,136,3.0,2/4/2017,"minus one star : The only problem i have with most chillis is that it looks unkempt with dirty floors as teh day goes by. Even though, i see people coming around to clear things, do some gentle sweeping.  minus one star: for the sorriest scoop of ice cream ontop of the mini molten chocolate cake. I mean it tasted delicious, but it is not proportionate to the amt of lava cake. I got the turkey burger southwest which was delicious. The bottom bread came out sort of soggy which made me think that it had been sitting out under the warmer for a while before it was served to me. But, i can skip that because of the contents of the burger- sauteed onions, jalapenos, cheese, yumminess. Overall, just like any other chilis. Food is pretty consistent. If im craving it, ill likely return."
Craig M.,"Detroit, MI",0,6,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Just got carry out, a buffalo chicken sandwich, no ranch. Get there and it's a boneless chicken breast on a bun with ranch. I wait 30 minutes for my order to be replaced, asked 3 times if it had NO RANCH, sure enouge, I get home to see the sandwich covered in ranch. Are you all that fucking stupid up there? You can't even get an entry level job correct? This is what happens when you let monkeys run a business."
Vinoth K.,"Farmington, MI",15,101,70,3.0,10/9/2015,Service was okay on Thursday night. I liked the margarita. We ordered appetizers boneless wings and chips with guacamole. I am a big fan of wings so I would say it was good not excellent. Dinner entrees mango chile chicken and another with tilapia both were good. It took a little while to get the drinks and appetizer and entrees came on time. My friend ordered shrimp appetizer but I didn't liked it. OverAll it was good and will try next time.
Tasha M.,"Dearborn, MI",169,1,1,1.0,9/4/2015,"My son and I came in for lunch around 3:15 pm, and sat in the bar area. There were only 3 other people sitting here. Our waitress, Tyiesha didn't come to our table for 10 minutes. When she finally did, we ordered and the wait began. We got our appetizer at 3:45 pm, it was cold, and she didn't bring us any plates.I complained to a mgr at 4:10 pm because our food hadn't come out. Of course it was cold, and my sandwich had onions on it after I asked the waitress if the sandwich had onions on it and she said no. The 4:00 waitress was more attentive and we weren't even her customers. Her name is April and she's awesome and she's normally my waitress when I come here. The mgr took care of my bill but I learned a valuable lesson: don't sit in Tyiesha's section ever again. Wait until 4:00 when April is here so I can receive the great service she always provides."
Sandra C.,"Warren, MI",71,150,169,1.0,9/2/2015,"I would avoid this Chili's location if I were you. Take my word for it. First of all, it smelled kind of funky inside, like dampness or mold, I don't know what it was that I was smelling, but it was very unpleasant. Then, I sat down in a booth in the bar area near the kitchen. I opened my menu and found myself looking eyeball to eyeball with a green bug. I closed the menu capturing it inside and called the server over. Meanwhile, a young man came out of the kitchen complaining that he had cut his finger. ""There's a bug in this menu,"" I told the server. She took the menu and handed it to the young man; he turned around and took it back into the kitchen! You can't make this stuff up! I sent an e-mail to Chili's headquarters and never heard back from them. Also, the manager did not come to my table to apologize for the unfriendly little visitor. Grossed me right out the door."
T. J.,"Smyrna, GA",162,69,141,4.0,11/7/2013,I stopped in this Chili's for lunch because it is very close to the hotel I am staying in so the short walk across the parking lot was convenient. Lunch special had a few beers and plenty of meals priced just right for lunch.  I do believe tall drafts were $2.  All my food was cooked as ordered and it came out fast.  The beer was ice cold just like it should be. I didn't experience the dirty side like others have reported.  It was actually cleaner than I expected.  Erica was my waitress and she was very polite and checked on me often.  I will be sure to visits this place again.
Shelby K.,"Orlando, FL",35,50,86,2.0,9/15/2015,Service was awful for a Tuesday night. Had to ask for water 3 times. Almost 30 minutes before we were even greeted by a sever. Waiting on food for over an hour. Unfriendly wait staff. No smiles.
Rola S.,"Knoxville, TN",101,217,369,2.0,7/19/2013,"This chilis was so dirty and ghetto like. The drinks and food was great however. Staff was pleasant. So just the basics, comfort food and an excuse for a night out."
Maggie W.,"Lansing, MI",47,44,4,2.0,7/12/2012,"I hadn't been to a Chili's in years.  I think I know why. My friend suggested we go there and I figured it can't be that bad. After all, I like Applebee's and they're kind of similar, right?  Shoot! This place was awful. The food was really bad. I mean usually I scarf down restaurant food like Michael Phelps preparing for an Olympic swim training session.  Get this people! I left half of my dinner on the plate! Frickin half!  It was some sort of chicken taco or rollup thingy.  Yes, ""thingy""  is a word for food that's not good.  All I know is, the worst part was there was no freaking blooming onion! Honestly, that's why I went there to try for the first time my life this stupid blooming onion and they didn't have it there.  Just really overpriced, bad food I could've cooked better drunk.  Trust me guys, this is not the place to have a nice dinner."
Kevin C.,"Farmington, MI",0,4,,1.0,8/30/2013,"Just had lunch at the Dearborn, Michigan Chilis, and this without a doubt was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  This place was filthy -- we were seated at a table that was not wiped down and had dried up salsa and tortilla crumbs all over it.  The ketchup bottle was covered - COVERED - in dirt and dried up ketchup.  It took the waitress over 10 minutes to come for our order.  We were there for over an hour and not once did she come back to refill our waters.   We were waited on by four different people while there.   She did not bring back the regular receipt with the receipt number after taking my credit card, so I could not take the survey on Chili's website - but maybe that was the point.  .     Anyway, the worst part of the experience was undoubtably the food.  Myself and my coworker both ordered the margarita chicken.  The chicken was overcooked and rubbery and had the consistency of a tire -- it reminded both of us of the fake pressed chicken that comes in TV dinners.  Both myself and my coworker could not finish more than a third of our meals -- the dish had absolutely no flavor.   Just as the check came my coworker ran to the bathroom and threw up his lunch -- I lost mine about 30 minutes later. Never.  Again.  Filthy place!"
Jess D.,"Detroit, MI",68,149,28,2.0,8/6/2009,"Why is there always someone in the group that insists on going to Chili's? Being a Yelper, I have about 20 other restaurants that I would rather spend my money at then Chili's.  My friend raved about this sampler plate where 2 people could hoard down a bunch of food for 20 bucks...it started out with cheesy steak fries and nachos, and then we had big mouth burgers and chicken quesdillas and ended with this double chocolate overload cake thing topped with ice cream and hot fudge. Why does everything have to be so EXTREME? Every dish was a MOTHER-LOAD of food...no wonder why I felt too fat to function!"
