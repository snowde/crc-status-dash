Kevin B.,"Montgomery, TX",6,134,7,4.0,12/4/2017,"I stopped by on Thursday night (Nov. 30th) because my hotel is right behind them. Great location, good food (it is Chili's, right). They were training a new waitress, so I got to go through the training issues, etc. That's OK, I don't mind repeating my order when she comes back and asks how I want my steak. The steak was good, service was great (got the food quickly - delivered by the trainer because the trainee was having some issues with juggling multiple orders). It was good, very friendly and as always, the interior was clean and decor was typical Chili's  (if you been to one, you have been to them all). I did not have any issues with the staff, or the restaurant, overall a good experience. I recommend."
Brian S.,"Brookhaven, Atlanta, GA",32,97,1239,3.0,6/12/2016,"Well let's face it is Chili's... but the food is consistently good and the service at this location was very attentive.  I ordered a combo plate (1/2 ribs, 1/2 chicken) and I had forgotten how delicious the ribs are."
Sam M.,"San Antonio, TX",45,358,825,3.0,12/14/2015,Hey. It's chills. Decent service. No harm no foul. I had soup and salad. Both very good. Sat at bar and the barmaid was sweet and fast. Nothing to complain about.
Stephanie W.,"South St. Paul, MN",0,3,,2.0,11/6/2016,"This was probably the worst Chili's experience that I've had.  I ordered online which was nice and easy. When I got there, I went in and waited close to 10 minutes before someone came to the counter.  They were short with me and not very pleasant.   When I got home, I opened the food and it was not great.  I ordered Cajun shrimp pasta and there wasn't hardly any Alfredo sauce.  The chicken enchilada soup had sides of tortilla strips and cilantro and they were both open and dumped in the bottom of the bag.  The sampler platter food was okay but we had ordered ranch as the dips but got Bleu cheese.  I live halfway between Woodbury and Eagan and this was the third time in a row that Eagan want good so will check out Woodbury next time."
Andrew B.,"Key West, FL",0,16,,5.0,3/31/2017,"My wife and I went here for dinner last Friday and had an incredible experience. Every staff person we encountered was so kind to us. We normally go to other locations, but we in the area."
Jenny K.,"South St. Paul, MN",0,7,,5.0,2/6/2015,Always have great service and specials the food is great! Awesome happy hours! Even if they are super busy we have gray service! Also like we can re-order our drinks right from the table it sends directly to the bar from the kiosk
R H.,"Tempe, AZ",33,58,86,2.0,7/15/2014,"Chicken has close to no flavor, I'm guessing everything is frozen before it's prepared.  The sides are very small. Basically when you order fajitas the sides will last for 1.  I would Not recommend this place sadly :("
Emilie B.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",57,161,14,1.0,4/12/2014,"First of all...I hope Chili's will learn that having those electronic ordering device things on the tables SHOULD NOT be a replacement for actual good service, because at this particular Chili's, our service was awful. Thankfully we were able to pay our check on the machine and leave when we were done, because our server was so inattentive that it probably would have taken 15 minutes longer to wait for her to bring our check (it was lunchtime and barely any tables filled, so she definitely wasn't busy).  We ordered the skillet queso as an appetizer, and it definitely tasted off...either old or burnt or something. I wasn't impressed with my entree either, I got the shrimp tacos and it was slathered in a sauce that tasted like a kitchen cleaning solution, like lysol. So gross.  Both my fiance and I felt sick when we got home after lunch, bad stomach pains. We literally couldn't think about our lunch without getting nauseous. Bad bad bad! I blame the queso. I have been to other Chili's locations in the past and definitely enjoyed my meal, so I think this location is mis-managed and has issues and I definitely won't be returning."
Bree B.,"St Paul, MN",0,3,2,5.0,12/12/2014,"I got a $7 lunch special, bowl of chili and s chipotle chicken  tex mex. It was completely delicious. The chili had actual beef chunks, not ground beef. The tex mex was so tasty, and flavorful great spices. We also got some queso dip. It was not the normal cheese and peppers kind of queso, it was quite different but all in all a great dining experience!"
Dan F.,"Inver Grove Heights, MN",21,22,,3.0,2/13/2015,"Stopped for lunch 2-11-15.  My rating really could be 4, but the soup was not so great. Service was top notch. Hostess was accomodating. Turkey sandwich was super yummy. Fries were unneeded, but good. ...but the soup...the loaded baked potato had flavors of cheeses that mirrored velveeta or contained said....it was a cheese soup with potato Value for a six buck lunch was way there.  Get the soups right and I'd go five stars. I will leave with this question.  What chef wants his or her soup rejected?  It is a testimony to the establishment.  I did not finish it."
Adam F.,"St Paul, MN",52,158,9,3.0,5/31/2014,"Not the best not the worst. It really bothers me that they have 2-4-1's, but not on their specialty drinks. They have some fun concoctions that I did try but didn't like the price. The food is fine and quick and fairly priced."
Tony G.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,2.0,7/29/2015,"The Salmon was okay, nothing great, however the service was excellent. The beer selection was extremely limited and the price for a draught Blue Moon was outrageous, compare to how little their mugs are. Stick to bottled beer here."
Joe I.,"Saint Paul, MN",59,670,166,3.0,5/15/2010,"First, this particular Chili's is in Eagan, not Saint Paul, but whatevs.  I have eaten at this chain joint more often than I would care to admit.  I used to swear by the food but lately it has been very hit or miss.  I used to also swear by the price, but lately, the prices have not been impressing me at the end of the meal - value for what I pay.  And, I used to swear by the drinks - almost always 2 for 1 - but as my wife pointed out tonight - the drinks are mostly ice.  It is a great place to bring the family out to eat, becuase they treat the kids right and have one of the best selections for a kids menu anywhere, and the vast majority of the time the service is really good.  However, lately the food and the price have been slipping."
Justin M.,"Lakeville, MN",6,50,120,3.0,11/23/2011,Came here for lunch and had the Shiner Bock BBQ Burger.  It was very juicy and the BBQ sauce was awesome. The service was good and the place was clean. You can order food or pay your bill at the table with the kiosk. I would recommend!!!!
L. H.,"Ames, IA",0,30,,1.0,8/13/2012,"Some coworkers and I went here after work for a late lunch.  The soup tasted like it was microwaved from a can. Also, their ""all day happy hour"" isn't really a happy hour when the size of the 2-4-1's wouldn't satisfy a mouse. Service has never been real good at this particular location and the overweight, younger male supervisor is ignorant and plain rude."
Bonnie M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,24,,4.0,7/12/2012,Food was awesome-I couldn't believe that there were hardly any people there but we were seated (for 5) immediately.  Our waitress was very pleasant and made sure our glasses stayed full.  We will definitely eat here again.
