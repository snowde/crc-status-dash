Bridgett H.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,20,1,5.0,10/27/2015,I have been here twice within the past month. The service is great and fast. The new menu is good. Everyone is helpful and food is delicious. Lunch time is pretty empty! Will be back!
Gloria F.,"Trappe, MD",0,5,1,2.0,2/10/2017,Very busy bad service long food time more than usual. No flat ware no napkins no drink refill super disappointed.  Response feedback isn't working
Ki R.,"Easton, MD",0,5,,4.0,6/28/2016,"Hands down the best happy hour in town 2 to 8 everyday, half priced apps and discount drinks, you can't go wrong. I regular this place it's very consistent with food and service but the service for me is a little bias just because I have gone there often. The bar is a horseshoe style which makes it open and able to converse with other patrons. They have 6 or 7 tv which always have sports on which makes it my go to spot, beer selection ok and has the usual suspects, bud, Miller, and so on. The down side is some of the menu just isn't good and corporate is always changing things but the core foods are always there. There is absolutely no buss staff so sometimes when the place is super busy things pile up and it can be messy at times. I solely recommend this place because of its happy hours, tv's and wings there are several staff members who have been there for a while now and that also is comforting but again I am a regular and have paid for extra friendly service so your experience may vary."
