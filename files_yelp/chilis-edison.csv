Stephen W.,"Edison, NJ",98,107,22,3.0,10/3/2017,"I've been to this Chili's a few times, usually because my mom wants to get the tacos here. I'm on the fence about this place because I'm not sure it really knows what it wants to be and that's a big problem. The atmosphere is kind of reminiscent of a casual family place with food like burgers and tacos and the like. The problem is that there are TV's with sports on. Great so it's a sports bar? Not quite. There aren't enough TV's in the restaurant for everyone to see, so if you want to watch your team you have to sit at the bar. The menu is kind of odd too. They have burgers and fries for people who want that, but they also have tacos and fajitas. So maybe it's about bar food but if you want things like that you can go to Buffalo Wild Wings. The prices aren't that bad and for that reason it's not a bad place to go if you want to have a nice meal with the family. On the other hand, there are better places to go for all aspects of the dining experience. For that reason, I'm really on the fence about what to give this place. I may be back, but it probably won't be my first choice."
Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",248,121,230,4.0,9/19/2017,"Hey Hey my fun Adventurers!  Dropped by here Monday for a very early lunch---literally the first ones as soon as they opened their doors. Yes my friends and I are weirdos like that.  The bartender was nice enough to seat us, while two other servers doted on us. My friend ordered a chicken dish over a bed of rice and black beans that looked scrumptious. FYI: her plate was clean in the end. I believe I ordered the spicy santa fe salad, with grilled chicken. In was filling and the chicken wasn't dry. The dressing was really tasty along with the avocado. I don't normally order salads but this may be something I'll end up ordering this the next time I go. Overall awesome experience!"
Maria B.,"Colonia, NJ",0,11,,4.0,1/6/2018,"The food is awesome ! The service could be a bit better, our waitress did her job but i tried letting her know it was my friends birthday and she just wasn't that attentive ! Overall good experience"
Bria M.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",53,63,184,5.0,4/21/2017,"When I came here I honestly didn't really expect much. I was hungry and wanted a quick cheap meal. I had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated which wasn't that bad. If you download their app you can ""skip the line"" apparently. My server Meghan was awesome! She was busy but she was extremely attentive. She constantly checked on us & offered her expert opinion whenever we asked for it. We decided to do the 4 for 35. The Margaritas were DELICIOUS!! I got blackberry margarita. For an appetizer we had fresh guacamole with chips.  For my entree I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. My boyfriend got the Bacon ranch chicken quesadilla. Everything was excellent! I have 0 complaints what so ever !  Can't wait to go back."
Binita S.,"Edison, NJ",118,82,328,5.0,3/27/2017,I use to come here back in high school and stopped coming for years . They have re done their menu over the past few years and have so much more vegetarian options . My go to order here is the Chipotle fresh mex bowl . They always substitute the chicken with a veggie pattie . It is simply delicious . I would eat this everyday if I could . It's a great portion and a great meal .
Jay W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",23,51,4,2.0,2/12/2017,"The prices, as always with Chili's, are a great value. Unfortunately,  that's the only good thing I can say about this particular location. It took a long time (30 minutes or so) to get our order. I had chicken and my wife had steak. They both tasted like they were straight out of the microwave. They were rubbery and flavorless.  Avoid this chili's and go to the Clark location."
Stephanie A.,"Edison, NJ",197,72,115,3.0,3/30/2017,"I understand it's a chain restaurant but I find myself here almost weekly. Chilis is so close to me that it's easy to come for a quick beer, quick dinner or even on a Sunday when it's all day happy hour. The food might not always be that great but the people who work here are attentive, friendly and really do provide great service. The menu is usually the same but they change it out every once and a while (The newest edition has the calorie count - ek!!!). Chilis is a causal place to come by for a cold beer and a decent meal but with extraordinary service. I recommend sitting in the bar area as the servers here are more experienced and are also really friendly and fun!"
Patti K.,"Metuchen, NJ",1,8,2,1.0,9/15/2017,"Horrible.   I used to come here a lot to watch baseball, hockey and football.  Loved the staff.   I went tonight and walked right out.   It was filthy.  The floor was sticky and the only four open tables in the bar area were not cleared from the previous customers.   This store lost a customer.  I'll try another Chili's."
Ivan G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",34,10,1,5.0,4/20/2017,The food was great and the waitress Samantha  did a great job. The desert we had the Oreo molten lava cake was delicious.
Robert A.,"Edison, NJ",2,6,4,3.0,4/13/2017,A good place to stop for a beer and a quick snack/meal.  The best thing about Chili's is the friendly service. I think you will like it too.
Donald D.,"Summit, NJ",4,34,18,1.0,12/30/2016,"The sad part about this review is that I actually like Chili's! I hope this message can be a wake up call to the management or corporate offices.  First my server was exceptional.  After almost immediately getting the chips and salsa it took at least 35 minutes to get the remainder of the meai.  Ribs were not fall off the bone actually they were pretty dry.  The... burger was cold onion rings cold, On the bone chicken DRY come on this is hard earned money that I spend to frequent your locations. You have to do better!  the server explained there were problems throughout the day and thanked me for being patient As I left on this visit had to go past the kitchen and it was immediately clear that half the problem was many servers/ cooks were congregating & chilling out there on the stainless prep tables. ""If you have time to lean you have time to clean"" there was paper strewn on the kitchen floor.  Does anyone have Safe serve Certification?"
Carissa M.,"Elmont, NY",214,26,26,5.0,6/10/2017,"Richa, our server was super attentive! Went here after AutoCon because we were so hungry! Ordered the guacamole and honey chicken waffles for appetizer and mango chile tilapia as my entree. Everything came out faster than I expected and the food was hot! Came in hungry and left very full and satisfied. I ended up spending less than I expected too! This was a pleasant change to how my usual experiences are at other Chili's locations where the food is mediocre paired with slow service. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area."
Sage J.,"Woodbridge, NJ",3,34,36,1.0,6/21/2017,"I haven't been to a chili's in years up until a few days ago, my in laws & I had an interesting night.  We got there at 7:20pm, our server was very sweet, places isn't busy, place appears clean, so far so good... We order a few min after we are seated.....fast forward to 8:35 when we ask the server for another water & she appears surprised & says ""Oh! The kitchen lost your ticket, I'll have to take your orders again. I'm so sorry.""  So we re-order, not the servers fault.  Soon after we get our food, a medium rare burger is well done & glasses are dirty  We ask to see a manager, he comes by, has no idea that our ticket was lost, he apologizes offers us desert, we are like sure since we were going to get desert anyway. We explain our server is very nice, but the kitchen lost our ticket etc All is okay, until I guess the manager said something to the server & then a group of servers are behind us, staring us down & talking about us right there.  We left right after. Ugh."
Tania B.,"Edison, NJ",0,18,,3.0,5/29/2017,I enjoyed my mail the first time but sadly the second time I got sick  The first time I really enjoyed my salad thou but second time both me n my friend got sick so that was a bad experience  The server was really nice and friendly
Thomas B.,"Bethlehem, PA",33,8,12,1.0,5/6/2017,"Go here all the time and this is the third and final time out order will be screwed up. The servers think it's cute not writing down your order, thinking they will memorize it, then they forget to bring the appetizer, screw up my wife's cheeseburger, she asked for it plain, my corn on the cob was ice cold... never again ... stay away from chain restaurants"
Jennifer P.,"Edison, NJ",2,5,,5.0,5/5/2017,Wow oh wow James the waiter is D R E A M Y. Mmmmm!!! Well! The food was amazing I had the chicken wings and they were de-LICIOUS! warm my old little heart. It was the taste of wangle souring through the sky. It was the best chicken EVER! It was that good. I want to name a religion after that chicken it was so good. God. Bless.
John W.,"Plainfield, NJ",0,45,,4.0,4/24/2017,I have to say it's a good low/mid priced chain/restaurant. The selections are great.  The food is good and the staff so far has been on point at this location.
Anuja D.,"Avenel, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,10,,4.0,5/22/2017,I love this place! Great service and ambience..  We have been there multiple times .Recently we  celebrated Mother's Day there and they welcomed us with flower ! Overall nice family friendly place with great food!
Swinki B.,"Iselin, NJ",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2017,It was the second time we walked out of this place without eating on saturday. We had a bad experience before but then v decided to give it a second chance and went there for dinner.These people are total racist. They accommodated other parties of white people who walked in after us and we were still waiting to be sat even though they had enough booths left. Very bad and rude staff. I would not give them any star for there behaviour twice.
Martha C.,"Metuchen, NJ",3,21,1,3.0,11/26/2016,Prices are good & the margarita selection is dank..the food is good & the atmosphere is nice..only problem is their location is right next to little Indian & it attracts a lot of unwanted customers..also they did away with the fried apples & sweet potatoes fries..that's a big fuck up... are waiter James was one hell of a hunk tho..God bless!
Derek D.,"Colonia, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,4,,5.0,8/6/2017,This is probably the best chilis I have been to. Love the staff and food is alright too. I walked in on a Saturday night 20 mins before closing to grab some bites and drinks. Our server was cleaning and ready to close but still she took good care of us. She didn't rushed us at all. Great job chilis!!!
Nyc G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,7,1.0,9/30/2016,"Service is a joke. Manager Michael is a discrace. I was planning on placing a very large order for the curb side pick up and I have my 1 year old son in the car(it was raining) I asked if someone would be able to bring the food out to the car considering the circumstances (and the fact that it is CURBSIDE) and I was told no by a woman named REY. I then called back and spoke to a Manger(if that's what you want to call him) by the name of MICHAEL who for the life of me can not understand how this man passed the interview to work in the customer service industry. Not only did Michael rudely ask me why I couldnt just get out of the car, he hung up the phone on me when I asked him for the general managers name. Words such as rude and unprofessional are an understatement when describing this man. I was told some rediculas excuse that the servers can not leave the building with their bank on them..when I asked why he as the manager couldn't assist me he refused, raised his voice and spoke over me. This man is a joke and hangs up the phone on me every time I call.I still did not get the name of the general manager of this property and would like someone to call me back immediately.He needs to be reprimanded.  I have already contracted corporate with my request and will follow up daily to make sure these 2 individuals never speak to anyone with that tone ever again."
Aman J.,"Philadelphia, PA",88,8,1,1.0,10/11/2016,"This was on Saturday: 10/08/16.  Usually, I like the food at chili's and the food was Ok too but the service was horrible. If it wasn't only option open till midnight I would have left right then & there. The waiter (don't remember the name of the guy) was terrible. Initially, we had ask him 5-6 times for the water to be served, and when the water was served he threw the straw on the table, he just spoof the straws on the table. Later when my friend ordered a drink, he spilled that too on the table. It was like he wasn't even paying attention to anything he did, when we called him and pointed that, he said we spilled the drink while moving it on the table. It was ridiculous. We had to call him 7-8 times for any service to be requested. And finally after all the efforts in calling him again & again, he somehow took our food ordered. He messed up that too. At first he said the 3 for $10 can be altered with veggie burger instead of Chicken/Pork Fajita, so we ordered to 3 for $10 with one regular one (with fajita) and the other one with alter one (with veggie burger). In the bill he added a veggie burger separately, and two (2) 3 for $10 in the bill. Also, the 3 for $10 included 2 desserts (one for each order), he didn't served us the dessert. He said the kitchen is closed and he made changes in bill by reducing $2 off ($1 for dessert).  After all this he expects us to tip him? I had to say, TERRIBLE. This Chili's is the worse. Additionally, they still need to do something about clearing away dirty dishes from vacant tables.   ."
Timothy W.,"Edison, NJ",0,11,2,4.0,3/28/2017,"REALLY GOOD FOOD AND SERVICE (most of the time). . Apps: Everyone loves the chips and salsa. chips r hot and fresh and salsa is ground up to tomato sauce consistency but has a little kick and alot of flavor. great for my kids who dont dig the chunky ones at other places.Skillet Queso is usually really good but sometimes texture inconsistent. Wings are juicy and tasty. Boneless were also very good. Texas Cheese fries r good too Soups I had were the Chicken Enchilada which is awesome ( i get with lunch all u can eat inc salad). Baked Potato is good and cheesy with heavy of bacon flavor.            Meals: Steaks have always been good. Ribs are tasty but not very filling. slight on the meat but flavor is really good. have had DR Pepper,dry rub, and reg BBQ and all were good. Beef Enchiladas had good flavor for ground beef and was hot and cheesy good. Smoke house combo was ok with ribs (see above) BBQ was a little dry and smoked sausage was average.  also a bit dry I thought and something about flavor didnt like. Pickles were tasty. Craft Ultimate Bacon Burger was cooked perfect not too done and cheese/bacon were good too bacon done good not too chewy and not too well done. Dessert: what can u say all good here! had skillet cookie, molten cake and salted caramel cake fresh tasting and sweet. get the dinner for two and usually plenty, u get choice of certain apps and pick of most entrees (some upcharge). when there for lunch (i sit in bar area for quicker service) Kenny the bartender is great, remembers my lunch order and hostess Maria helps out when things get busy (in bar area anyway)"
Sweta S.,"New York, NY",149,12,2,5.0,10/9/2016,"My family and I love this place! This is our go-to Tex Mex spot in the area. I especially like it over Jose Tejas because it's not as loud and you can hold a conversation. Service is very polite. My sister and I were hoping to get a nice window seat but it wasn't fully cleaned so we sat elsewhere. Our waitress noticed we wanted to sit there and cleaned it right away and asked us if we'd like to move without any fuss. Keep it up, Chili's!"
Rajeev A.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,4,,5.0,5/26/2017,We went to their location in Edison @oak tree road.  It was early dinner at around 5 pm. The server was very pleasant and service was prompt and perfect.  The prices are really a great value for your money.  I think it is the best overall in its range.  I definitely will visit again.
Fnu F.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,2,,5.0,5/11/2017,Very tasty food and drinks. The waitress was awesome. She was professional and knew her job very well. Food wassuper tasty specially margarita flat bread salad. And it was in thebudget
Umar T.,"New York, NY",191,111,322,2.0,8/4/2016,"In terms of service, we had a great experience with our waitress. She made sure our bottomless chips & salsa were truly bottomless and constantly refilled. Our order was taken quickly and came in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were pretty lame and generally flavorless. Portion size was solid and the shrimp fajitas that someone I was with ordered were decent. In general it is a giant restaurant chain so can't expect much from it. My one huge gripe with this place were those tablets they had in the middle of the table. I get the idea - expedite ordering, payment, etc. But really they're just clunky, take up space, and Chili's has the nerve to add a ""Table Entertainment Fee."" Apparently this fee is for playing with the games but the only thing we used that tablet for was to order Dessert at the end of our meal. The tablet should prompt the user about the fee before processing the transaction. Very sneaky. I called the next day and an employee submitted a charge reversal."
Aishwarya A.,"Carteret, NJ",2,8,,1.0,6/4/2016,The worst service I have experienced in a big name chain of restaurants.  The service was poor. The waitress was in no way interested in getting our food to the table. Because there was no food made for us!  We walked away with a drink which we got Right away but no food Because  after one hour they still didn't have any Appetizers either for us.
Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",251,682,365,2.0,9/5/2014,They still need to do something about clearing away dirty dishes from vacant tables.  If it wasn't so close to my house I would never come here.  The one is Clark is so much nicer.  The food is OK.  Service was pretty spotty.
Ernie D.,"Edison, NJ",0,24,,1.0,3/4/2017,Ordered fried pickles and asparagus as appetizer and it was greasy and the batter was falling off as I picked it up.    Service was very slow took almost 20 minutes just to get our appetizers.   Not going back.   Applebee's is much better.
David C.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,6,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Just left Chili's in Edison New Jersey. Six adults and on this occasion they could only get 4 orders correct. My buddy is allergic to tomatoes and made that very clear to the waitress. She even made the ""table guacamole"" Without tomatoes. We both ordered with no tomatoes and when both orders came out 30 minutes later with tomatoes she told us both we didn't tell her no tomatoes. No manager even came over. This Resturant is off my list. Too many good places in the area. The ""molten lava cake "" which we waited 20 minutes for was frozen."
Melwin D.,"Edison, NJ",18,7,2,5.0,2/5/2016,I had a great experience the waiters a was amazing is very friendly my favorite waiter is ( Jennifer) she is so attractive and I have been coming here like 3 years the food is so good I love to seating at bar and the chips and salsa amazing .. Highly recommended
Maddy J.,"Iselin, NJ",0,12,,1.0,12/17/2016,"Roach on the table, between the dishes..i told the waitress, she removed it with tissue. Later manager came and saying it is a bug not a roach. I am sure it is a roach. But that is not the point, looks like kitchen is not clean environment. She gave 10$ off at the end but they ruined our dinner."
Robert B.,"South Plainfield, NJ",0,14,,1.0,5/16/2016,"I have been going here since it opened and it was very consistent. unfortunately, the last few times it was not so good. really went down hill. I won't be going back anytime too soon."
John R.,"Warren, NJ",152,1133,296,3.0,11/18/2012,This was our first time ever Chili's experience. Service was good and the grilled shrimp tacos I had were tasty. The menu seems extensive enough to please any taste for casual dining. We got a free chips with salsa due to a Foursquare checkin and the chips were great but the salsa was very plain.
Shal K.,"Edison, NJ",61,30,21,4.0,2/20/2016,Great place to hang out with good food and nice service.
Christine S.,"Union, NJ",0,48,1,1.0,2/19/2016,I am writing this while I am sitting in this place. I have been waiting for over an hour watching the people get in and be seated. The hostess is ignoring my party and I. I am NEVER coming here again! Neither should you unless you enjoy the wait!
Cat L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,54,2,5.0,4/12/2015,"Had a party of 20 here and everyone was so helpful and great! The managers were very patient with my reservation and our two waiters were so helpful, accommodating, and quick. Highly recommend for big groups!"
Cassandra G.,"Avenel, NJ",8,49,30,5.0,10/22/2014,"Not sure why this Chilis has a bad rep. I like this chilis. I always get coupons sent to my email. I'm always down for a good deal. Although their fajitas aren't my favorite, I still love some of the other items on the menu. The mexican egg rolls are delicious! The burgers are good. And I actually really like their bar! They have some really good drinks. The tropical sunrise is so good. I like the long Island iced teas and the margaritas come in HUGE glasses unlike other restaurants who charge you the same amount and give you much less of a drink. The chips and salsa is really yummy too. The chips are nice and flakey, salty and light. I love their desserts too. Just recently I received an email that they have some new additions to their menu. I'm excited to try them. I also like the kiosk at each table. It keeps the kids entertained and you can order refills on drinks, order new drinks, play games, order dessert and even pay your bill and have them email or print your receipt right from the machine. My husband and I love this place!"
