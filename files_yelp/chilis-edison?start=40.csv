Andrew C.,"Califon, NJ",127,183,52,1.0,2/21/2014,"Wow. This place has gone down hill. This is not Mexican, this is not Tex-mex just lame. My Margarita was straight up lime juice, my food did not taste good, even my water tasted weird.  I don't know what other reviewers were talking about when they said the fajitas were great, they were probably the worst fajitas I've ever had.  They tasted like the chicken came out of a microwave bag, it was accompanied by a poor selection of somewhat old looking guacamole, low-quality three cheese mix, and shredded lettuce. The chips and salsa were the only redeeming quality of my restaurant experience here. They were actually very thin, salty and crispy and the salsa had a good flavor. The service was fine but the food sucked."
M. K.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",2,56,50,3.0,10/20/2013,"When my friends and I need a drink, Chili's presidente is our drink of choice! The food and service is ok.  We tend to get served by someone new every time we come.  The crowd seems to be young high school kids so it can get roudy and loud.   I'm low maintenance so I don't mind this place."
Ryan C.,"Pottstown, PA",0,3,,2.0,4/21/2015,"Food as expected at a Chili's. Came during Happy Hour, with a large party and the room in the bar area wasn't big enough. Was disappointed to learn that happy hour prices only applied to those in the lounge. Will not be coming back, as the manager should have used discretion, considering there was no additional space in the bar when we arrived."
Amanda Y.,"New York, NY",374,62,5,2.0,2/28/2011,"This is a neighborhood spot for me and I've been going for years.. but not because it's anything special, but because it's close-by and convenient. I usually get my meals from here to go now since I've grown accustomed to multi-tasking while eating.  Plus, I like packing my own left overs. It's standard chain eating.  Nothing fancy.  The service isn't terrible, but it's not stellar either.  If you're there with a big group, you can get away with being pretty loud.  It always reminds me of taking over spots like this in high school and college.  Nobody should give you any problems if you're low maintenance. ** If you check in to Chili's using 4square, you can get a FREE order of chips & salsa.  I've done this several times over the past year or so.  However, every time I show them the coupon code, the servers seem to be lost and not know what to do.  A manager is always called.  If they say it's invalid, ask for the manager (often they are looking for a 10 digit code that doesn't exist).  Get your free appetizer!"
Michelle L.,"Iselin, NJ",1,66,33,2.0,10/20/2014,"Sad that they don't have the bloomin onion anymore. That was such a huge hit! I miss the spicy sauce that came with it too! This place is nothing like it use to be! It decor was so cool with old antiques around the restaurant, now its just boring and plain. My mother and I had lunch here a few weeks ago. As we were being seated we noticed that all the tables had a mini ipads on them with advertisements, games, apps etc.. After we ordered we heard two girls at the table behind us say that they didn't play any games on the ipad so why are they being charged $2 dollars on their bill that says ""games"" the waitress apologized and said that she would fix the problem. Now my problem with this is that why are they charging you to play games while you wait for your food? No where does it say that if you open up a game or app that it will charge you. I think that is nonsense.Way to rip of customers $$! And I feel sorry for families that go here and have kids with them because once the kids see a cool ipad with games they won't hesitate to play and since it doesn't say that they will charge you, no one will have a clue until there bill comes. So yeah, We had ordered 2 for $20 meal and you can choose up to 3 items. When we got our food there was hardly any food on our plate...very small portions and very bland food. When we got our bill we noticed that they had charged us $2 dollars for a stupid game that we didn't even play! We didn't even touch the ipad! The waitress apologized to us and took the $ off and said that they have been having problems with this all day...well maybe if it is such a problem get rid of the stupid thing! I have a feeling that those ipads won't last. Such a stupid idea. I haven't been here in awhile and I'm okay with saying that I won't be back"
Arlo D.,"Colonia, NJ",56,148,121,3.0,3/16/2011,"Not a bad place to eat at. Been eating for years now. Staff is nice and friendly never had any complaints. Food is good, I usually just order the triple play or whatever it is called."
S K.,"Edison, NJ",8,38,15,4.0,9/2/2013,Good place to hang around with u friends its nt that loud they have nice specially trio of margaritas some time i too had bad experience with their waiter but even i cant stop myself from stepping into chillis
Tom M.,"Edison, NJ",74,3,,4.0,9/26/2014,"decent place, may not be the best place out there but my fiance and i havent had a poor meal or service in the years ive been occasionally going there but the food is pretty good and prices very fair when all ur looking for is a good burger, enchilada, etc.. plus my apt is only a mile away overall def not horrible but better than alot of other crap overpriced joints out there imo.. and a lot of these poor reviews on here r people looking for perfection and low prices and thats just not what ur always gonna get or... im sorry to say and only say this bc of experience in the resturant industry (being a server) ur just ""that diffcult customer"" that has too high a standard, never satisfied even with perfect service,etc... u get what ya pay for and remember not to piss off the people that handle YOUR food...."
Kim R.,"Canton, ME",23,84,,2.0,8/2/2011,It seems like everytime i visit here it seems they keep cutting more and more corners. I used to love their burgers and now their just blah. Their honey mustard for their famous chicken crispers isn't the same either :( desserts still good and drinks but I think chilis is on a downward spiral. Oh well
Arthur D.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,15,2,4.0,11/23/2011,"We (party of 4) ate here last night, and had been here before. We had a waiter in training, as well as his trainer, so the service was superior. The food is consistent here in both presentation & quality, which is not always the case in chain-type eateries. I had the dry rub ribs, which is my standard here, and I do recommend them. Other entrees included a burger, fajitas, and chicken strips, which were all good. Shared appetizer was cheese fries - also good! If you're looking for good (standard fare) food at reasonable prices, this is a good bet."
Kristine M.,"Fords, NJ",18,38,152,4.0,1/28/2011,"Consistenty great food for the value.  Usually get great service, except for the occasional slow server.  Coupons have always been accepted even from Check-in apps.  The seating by the bar is usually available and the several tvs show a variety of sports channels.  A good go to for a last minute get together w/ friends"
Kimberly H.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,1.0,5/19/2013,"Um, are you kidding me? I have been to many a Chili's in my time and this is by far the worst. Service deplorable, cleanliness non-existent and food less than mediocre. The manager clearly doesn't care about this restaurant, and it's apparent from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. Just don't waste your time or money."
Jennifer W.,"Metuchen, NJ",5,16,17,1.0,5/12/2010,"Wow, I hate to say this, because I don't like to give a bad review. It was sooo cold at this location tonight, we were miserable. The salsa was very hot and watered down. We were looking forward to visiting a former favorite burger joint,  but were let down. Hope it turns around, soon!"
Farah C.,"Iselin, NJ",0,21,,2.0,7/18/2010,"This particular Chili's is a gamble, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's a huge disappointment.  We eat here 2-3 times a month since it's so close to our house.  Dinner service and quality tends to be better than lunch time.  We've actually found it to be best to just call ahead and get the food to-go.  I do really love the new chili chicken soup on the menu, it's delicious."
