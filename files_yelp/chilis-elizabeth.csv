Tony A.,"Sacramento, CA",1195,606,2198,3.0,12/27/2017,"I'm NOT a huge fan of the ""corporate machine"" chains like Chili's but, I am a fan of keeping my family happy.  So while walking around The Mills at Jersey Gardens shopping center and the family wanted to eat; here I am. The date is December 26, 2017.  One day after Xmas and EVERYONE living in and around Jersey is here to catch the sales or exchange a gift.  Theres a line for every eatery inside the mall, including Chili's.  But to their credit, we didn't have to wait for a table of five.  Right in and to our seats but, that's where the CUDOS stop.   The wait for our initial server was about five minutes.  We placed drink orders and away she went.  Where??  I don't have a clue.  Ten minutes later, two of our five drinks arrived.  The rest arrived about five minutes later.   After the drinks arrived, we asked questions about the menu items and placed our orders for an appetizer and our meals. ** NOTE **   According to my family who seem to have visited Chili's ether often or are in the know how things work told me when guacamole is ordered, its normally prepared table side.  Not ours.  It arrived table side already mixed.  I did notice the table next to ours had ordered the guacamole and their server was working hard preparing theres at their table.   Normally when we dine out.  We're still in the middle of our appetizers when the main dish comes out.  NOT so today.  In fact, our server had to bring out more chips and apologized for the long delay with our meals. About twenty five minutes past and our server arrived saying she had bad news.  ""Our cooks didn't expect the large crowd today and they ran out of the batter for the waffles.""  She then asked if my son and I wanted to order something else from the menu which she just happened to have in her hand when I asked to see the menu again.  Things that make you say ""hum."" Almost an hour since our arrival and all of food made it to the table.  The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was mediocre okay.  Eatable but nothing to brag about. Final thoughts... I think this Chili's has an awesome location and has the potential to do and have a great business.  But, those running the establishment need to pay attention to the patrons concerns, wishes and reviews.  Service is slow and comes with excuses.  Attitude reflects leadership."
Andy Z.,"Union, NJ",0,46,6,1.0,12/20/2017,Awful awful service. Waited 10 minutes at the bar for a drink!! Food took over half an hour!! Really really bad. Unprofessional bartender sagging his pants and pulling them up every 30 seconds.  Bad experience all together.  I actually saw 6 people leave because they waited too long for service. Won't be back!!
Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,790,2216,4.0,3/10/2017,"What can I say about this Chili's spot. Uh,,, it's not your regular Chili's joint. They're not gonna have your regular Chili's stuff... like the house margarita. That's not available. We did come in because we were picking up friends at Liberty. So what better place to kill time than to do it at a spot where you can have a few drinks and food food then walk it off by spending money at the shops. We had two presidential margaritas, which was pretty good. Then we had an order of their sampler platter to share. The food and the booze was a perfect pair. Everything was definitely perfect as anything.  The place was nice and clean. We ate and drank at the bar and the bar tender was definitely attentive. Awesome service,, 10 out of 10. No drama,,, and would definitely eat here again.  Thank you for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!"
Danny T.,"Issaquah, WA",46,4,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Poor service.  We waited 15 minutes and the table next to us waited over 20. Asked to speak to a manager and she took our order but that took another 20 minutes.  Food came out and our server appeared angry we were bothering her.  Our server came by once after that to see if everything was good.   Never saw her again.  No silverware, no refills, no nothing.   Went back to the manager to get our bill and we got our chips and salsa taken off the bill. Almost missed our flight because of the poor service!  Not recommended at all!!"
Tracy N.,"East New York, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,1.0,11/11/2017,I will never eat from here neither will I recommend someone to eat there...they got terrible service I got fruit fly in my margarita and they didn't even apologize they jus asked if I wanted a different drink and to top that of my waiter got my whole order wrong..that place is horrible
Nina A.,"Garfield, NJ",0,37,73,4.0,8/18/2017,"The food was pretty good, & the portions were large. Our waitress was very nice. It's a chain restaurant, nothing special. But, it's much better than the Applebee's in the mall."
Mary D.,"Stuart, FL",2,6,,1.0,8/15/2017,Very slow service. No one in any hurry. Food was ok. Definitely not the place to go if you want a in and out.
Austin C.,"Kenilworth, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/29/2017,"Came to this place right after I got out of work, was seated within 10 seconds of entering. Employees yelling at each other to mop floors very poor resturant service. I ordered a half rack of ribs with French fires I told the waitress that I wanted the ""dry rub"" on the ribs because I have acid reflex and I can't have BBQ sauce without having incredible amount of pain in my chest. What do I get? A half rack of ribs loaded with BBQ sauce and cold hard French fries which took a hour to come out to me, I waited for almost 30mins and no one was around for me to say anything about the error, so I took napkins and wiped the bbq sauce off as best as possible. Never will I ever come back here, this place should be shut down asap"
Joshua B.,"Moyock, NC",115,195,232,1.0,9/12/2016,"My group came by because it's close to wear we are staying. We arrived and seated ourselves in the bar area. After a medium wait (10 minutes), a waitress came by to take our order. We gave drink orders, and she left. Then a waiter came by and introduced himself and said he would be our waiter. We asked about the first person then they began to argue who was taking our order. After an interesting show we got the waiter and our friends got the waitress. I ordered the salad bar however my friends had a terrible experience. Their food was cold, drink glasses remained on the tables and no garlic cheese rolls made it a bad time. Not recommended at all. Management change or new tactics needed to fix this."
Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",119,448,203,4.0,1/2/2017,"There are very few sit down eateries in Jersey Garden other than the food court.  If you want full sit down meal, this is one of those available. It is large to accommodate bigger parties and has a bar to boot.  Service is very attentive as well as anticipating refilling your drinks. Food is realitvely good especially the fajitas and burgers.  Typical Chillis you can come to expect but get here early for no wait seating since the mall packs a huge crowd for lunch and dinner."
Mandy C.,"Winthrop, ME",24,68,82,1.0,8/11/2016,"Just came from a ridiculous meal at Chilis. 1st off, my husband and I both ordered their ""20"" oz Stella after a looooong drive from Maine. Well, their 40cl Stella glass with a solid 1+"" head is not 20 oz! After doing a quick online search, it was easily established that 40cl is 13.526 us fluid ounces! (The bar tried to convince us that this was in fact the 20oz glass. It has been well disputed that this glass is not.) When my husband brought this to the manager's attention he a) refused to tell my husband how much the 14 oz beer was so that we could get the difference taken off our bill, and b) he offered to take 10% off the cost of each beer?! That came to a whopping $2 and some change off the entire bill. All the while, he agreed that it wasn't right and proceeded to throw the bartender under the bus. I will be reporting this restaurant to the state liquor agency for them to look into this issue.  2ndly, my husband and I ordered the ""classic nachos"" to share. (Nachos were not pictured or labeled in the menu) When I hear ""classic nachos"" I expect classic nachos. I expect a pile of tortilla chips with all of the accompaniments. Plus, we even threw in the guacamole for the buck and three quarters up charge. (No mention from the waitress that the ""classic nachos"" might not be as share-worthy as we were anticipating.) well, we literally got nachos-on-the-half-shell. There were 12 tortillas with the toppings stacked on top of them an a melon-ball's worth of quac in the middle.  Do Not Waste Your Time Here!  This particular restaurant relies on one time shoppers who come here for convenience. They feel no need to have ethics, scruples, or service. They don't expect to see you again, so why bother!  Go to any other spot for food in the mall. Starve this Chilis!"
Brian O.,"West Yellowstone, MT",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Horrible food and service. Staff yapping about the customers as they were going back to their stations. Slow service, bad management is evident."
Karina C.,"Yonkers, NY",3,53,20,1.0,6/11/2017,Walked in with 2 of my friends at the entrance and stood at the hostess table spot for a good 2 minutes. Workers were looking at us from afar but wasn't willing to seat us down nor greet us. Walked away and lost our sale.
Aditi G.,"Jersey City, NJ",38,99,100,2.0,11/12/2016,The worst part about this mall is the horrible good. Even chains like Chilis are bad. Service is painfully slow and below par. Our server came after pleading for 10 minutes. Out table only had 1 set of cutlery for 2 people. The server got us wrong order but realized it without us telling him (thank you!). The food did come a little earlier than we expected given our experience. The food is not bad so u can come here for lack of optio
Krishnan S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",32,10,5,1.0,11/27/2016,"Wish I could give negative stars....this place sucks big time. These people have no ethics and no respect for the customer and that includes the Manager who has zero customer service skills. We ordered from the kids menu and it came out looking like this mutilates sandwich. I'd prepare a better looking one for my dog! The fries clearly were re-fried and old. We also ordered the combo entree 2 for $20, well the portions were lesser than an appetizer. We called the manager to send it back and she had no Empathy instead she took it and said you will need to wait  a while for a replacement.  They take the shoppers for granted and that's why they are still here!!"
Ju M.,"Paterson, NJ",51,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,The service in this place is the worst! They take forever to take your order. They NEVERRR answer the phone. The employees are always standing around and talking to each other. I went there a few times always the same thing. And I'm not the only one who says this i have heard the same issue from multiple people. There's an Applebees downstairs I prefer to go to them!
Kamal B.,"Woodbridge, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"The pathetic place. Very very irresponsible staff who they don't care about the guests. I went in there with my family, I was given a table however for 25 minutes no body came to take the orders. I would have excused them if the restaurant would have been busy but it was 60% occupied at max. After 25 minutes we decided to move out and nobody cared about it. I would suggest a very big NO for this restaurant if you are in this mall and would like to have food, the food court has better options and quick service. I wish I can give 0 star to this restaurant."
Wai K.,"Queens, NY",79,83,113,1.0,1/4/2017,"Just another major chain restaurant. This Chili is nice and clean and food is decent. Was not thrilled with the staff and service. It took awhile for someone to come and take our order. When our orders arrived, the burger we asked for was incorrectly made. We asked for the egg in the burger to be fried and it came sunny side up. When we let the server know he said the egg could not be fried - then why didn't you tell us when we first made the order ???? Finally he took it back to the kitchen and basically what they did is just put the same egg on the stove and cooked it some more. Oh well - it's a chain restaurant- we really shouldn't expect much I guess."
Eugene O.,"New York, NY",404,428,1582,4.0,10/26/2014,Came here after the movies with the kids and also to watch the football game which they already started playing on all their TVs. We were seated right away.  The waiter came within minutes and took our order.  He didn't use any electronics or pen and paper to write down our orders which were not that easy.  To my surprise he has gotten everything right.  Food arrived quickly as well as drinks and he has kept on checking up on us very often clearing the table from unneeded items and bringing us more drinks refills and other things like ketchup. I was very pleased with the service and food at this location.
Johanna G.,"Jersey City, NJ",203,11,9,2.0,1/14/2017,"My girlfriend and I ordered the table side guacamole, it came with a huge bowl of chips and salsa, we usually love guac and we barely touched this one, it was drenched in lime juice and the avocado CLEARLY was not ripe enough. I ordered the prime rib tacos, it came with rice and a side of beans (although a little salty for my taste, the beans were best part of the meal) the tacos were mediocre, will never order them again. She had the seared shrimp with grilled chicken combo with corn on the cob and broccoli on the side (it was alright). Will never come back to this place again."
Dahlia Y.,"Pasadena, CA",271,218,1239,3.0,4/8/2015,"Chillis is my last choice of food just like apple bees.  I've visited different Chillis and the food taste great but there's something they must use that hurts my stomach. The only item that doesn't make me run to the bathroom are there soups. I've eaten their fajitas, grilled chicken and wings and within minutes of eating I gotta go! I love that they have a pad where you can order and pay, it also has games that entertains my son.. but I don't know if I want to risk another stomachache. Maybe I just have a sensitive stomach."
JC B.,"Newark, NJ",0,12,7,1.0,3/13/2016,"the most terrible service and bigoted attitude at this chili in jersey gardens! manager alex wanted to fight me for complaining about bad obnoxious service. waited while others were served by martha, jaime was unprofessional and made things worse by reordering cold grilled chicken salad twice! don't waste your time!  alex starts telling me about his college degree and that he doesn't have to work here....wth i had to call the police after some clown on staff follows me to my car after making a very professional complaint. i told him he almost got hurt following me like that!  taking it to corporate!  however from their one and a half star rating what should i expect from unprofessional trash.  chili is not a resturant its a food circus for clowns."
Jose G.,"Long Branch, NJ",0,2,,1.0,7/6/2017,Very disgusting food and even worse service. Will never make this mistake again! Waited 20 min for drink orders and another 20 for our appetizers!
Leandro R.,"Downtown Jersey City, Jersey City, NJ",46,1,,1.0,7/4/2017,Worst Chilis service ever... horrible staff completely lost. It was July 4th but you know. If you have no conditions to open just stay closed. By the way the beef quesadilla come as chicken and then changed.
Reed M.,"Port Matilda, PA",0,2,,1.0,6/20/2017,Chili's charges $4.99 extra if you substitute a bean burger for the meat burger.  I have never before been charged extra for a veggie burger.  The menu does not say it cost more.  What a surprise!   Bad way to run a restaurant.  Slow and inattentive service to boot.
Nakul N.,"Newark, NJ",111,4,,1.0,9/9/2016,Your better off waiting for you to win the lottery than waiting for someone to serve you in this godforsaken place potraying themselves as a restaurant.
Kati M.,"Elizabeth, NJ",16,15,11,5.0,7/6/2016,"I'm a picky person when it comes to Food & service but I been here Twice with my husband & haven't had a Complaint  -Food Was Really Good  -Service the first time was Great I wish I could remember the waitresses name , she was so Polite & helpful didn't have any problems with her  Second Waitress was Great also a little loud but she seemed very happy so that didn't really bother me like it bothered my husband her shirt had a lot of stains which I do understand cause I'm also a waitress but I would at least try to wipe it off but other then that she was Nice  -Yes there are Small fruit flies flying around your table from time to time but remember it's summer & you can't really get rid of all of them just have to shoo them away if you see it coming near your food  -The hostess isn't that welcoming he just sits there on his phone looking bored .  If you're a hostess you need to welcome people inside make them feel comfortable/welcomed"
Rodolfo T.,"Linden, NJ",18,23,,4.0,7/30/2016,Been here a few times. Food is ok. But the service cant complain. Good to have a spot to have a beer while wife is shopping
Josh U.,"Bethesda, MD",0,3,,1.0,9/5/2016,"Poor management due to over crowded population within the mall. Not enough crew to seat and guide the customers, especially the seniors and elderly. Being a long time Chilies customer, I can say without hesitation that any road-side restaurants within the east cost are being managed way better than this one. If you have to eat at this Mall, try Applebee's not the Chilies on the 2nd floor."
Melissa C.,"Newark, NJ",42,11,,1.0,6/10/2016,"Let me start by saying that I don't expect much from chilis. Never been a fave of mine, but occasion I do go to some, mainly for a quick lunch. But this place at jersey gardens is the absolute worse! I ordered the burger bites and the bread tastes like it was weeks old. There were fruit flies everywhere including my beer. Note to self never come to this one again!!!ever"
Brijette R.,"Hightstown, NJ",1,7,6,1.0,7/17/2016,"This is my first time dining at this location and I must say this is the worst Chilis that I've been to! The servers were friendly, but friendly is no consolation when it takes 30 mins to get an order of chips!  Everyone at the table was hungry and annoyed. Then, to top it off, several orders were wrong! SERIOUSLY! I will NEVER come to or recommend this Chili's to anyone! BE WARNED!!!"
Jolene P.,"New Milford, NJ",56,161,218,1.0,5/18/2014,"All in all a bad experience.  Food: i don't know how you go wrong with chain restaurant food, but trust me, it can happen. No one in our party was content with the quality, freshness, or taste of what they ordered. Everything seemed so dry and tasteless.  Service: Service was also very much lacking. In general, you could see waiters and personnel just hanging around and slow-paced. Every time you looked up there seemed to be a cluster of 3-5 waiters just  talking amongst themselves. No sense of service. Had to ask for  even the basics, napkins- knives- ketchup. Also had to ask 4 different people to change channel of the TV     Do yourself a favor and avoid."
Jefferson M.,"Long Beach, CA",227,101,80,1.0,11/1/2015,"I went during a slow time.  My friend and I were the only people in there. Me being a server I made sure to be super polite to our waitress. She couldn't have cared less. She was a robot. Seemed annoyed when I asked for a recommendation from the menu. The food was terrible, over priced, she never came back to check on us. She was too busy texting on her phone a few tables down. We never got napkins or refills . I would never go back."
Kourtney E.,"Washington, DC",2,48,7,5.0,4/29/2016,"I stayed at the Country Inn and Suites across the way from the Jersey Gardens mall (which I do not recommend at all...thankfully, my group and I only stayed there for a night...but that's for another review). The group decided to go to Chili's. It turned out to be amazing! Our server was Ida (Aida, unsure on the spelling). Her customer service and friendly, professional manner were superb! First, there were 7 of us in the group. She took all of our orders by memory and repeated back to us what we ordered!! Including our various drinks. Who does that anymore?? Ida, that's who!! Also, when we received our orders, not one was wrong. She needs to get a raise/promoted ASAP. I don't live in the area, but if you do, and are hungry for Chili's, get Ida as your server. You're welcome."
Gabriel R.,"North Plainfield, NJ",138,9,5,1.0,3/31/2016,"Don't bother coming here, get in your car and get out of here, Host are rude and nasty, servers are inattentive and food comes out wrong, like who lets the food go out the kitchen incomplete... Horrible nasty pre made food... save your money"
Jalpa B.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,4,,1.0,10/26/2015,"Worst restaurant i have ever been to. !! This Chili's is in the mall so these people absolutely do not care about their customer service.  Few weeks ago i went there with my husband, waited 15 minutes outside the restaurant so that we can be seated but no one showed up. I saw hostess seeing us still totally ignoring (super rude). Than we decided to have the take-out so went to the take-out area where it happened again WE WERE TOTALLY IGNORED. After few minutes of waiting someone showed up and asked about what we wanted very rudely as if she did a favor on us by coming and asking us. I had some questions about the food, she was so vague with her answers and half of the stuff she did not know on the menu !! (so great employee/manager). Adding to that no pleasantries were made to us !! WORST PLACE TO BE. I will make sure neither me or my friends ever waste their money on this restaurant !!.."
Daniel F.,"Elizabethport, NJ",34,17,4,1.0,3/21/2016,"Ive been to this place twice and bothe times i left, the first time my waitres took our order and never came back the manager comped my beer and i left the second time because i stood and waited at the entrance to be seated 10 min later the bartender tells me to sit at a table were i waited another 15 min, i left and there was not one employee in sight, should b shut down"
Matthew S.,"Yorktown, VA",4,33,15,1.0,9/14/2016,"See other comments. Wouldn't recommend. Food looked gross. Got a water, drink and bounced."
Jasmine R.,"Elizabethport, NJ",2,4,1,1.0,4/10/2016,Worst Restaurant I've ever gone to food was horrible service was slow very dissapointed!
Ashley C.,"Edison, NJ",379,38,129,1.0,8/15/2014,"To be honest, I do not want to give this restaurant any stars. Although I am not a fan of any chain restaurants, if I had to choose one on the fly it would be Chili's (probably because it was always conveniently located near my house). My friends know I frequent this chain, and therefore when celebratory occasions occur, they get me gift certificates. Shopping at the Jersey Gardens Mall with my girlfriend, I decided why not treat her for lunch at that Chili's location. This specific location and experience has forever changed my outlook and opinion on the Chili's establishments.  First off, let me just say, had I visited the rest room PRIOR to BARELY eating my BLAND lunch, I would have NEVER ordered anything at this restaurant. The bathroom reminded me of porter potties that have been sitting at a carnival for months. It stunk, was filthy, and soap was limited. They cannot keep their bathroom clean, so what would make me think their kitchen is any cleaner? Secondly, the food lacked flavor, and was cold when served. The salad I ordered was wilted and gross. Since I was myself a server, I am not the type to send back my food nor blame the server for the quality of my food. Instead, I pay, leave, and inform the public about how horrible their experience will be if they ever choose to visit this establishment.  Lastly, my friend and I were one of 3 tables in that place during lunch (which probably should have been a sign from the very beginning). I accidentally left a folder with personal papers on the table upon leaving the restaurant. But FIRST we used the restroom. Therefore, staff had already began cleaning our table while we were STILL in the restaurant. Did they approach me  to tell me that I left something? Absolutely not. I realized when I got to my car, I forgot it, called immediately, and they informed me they found NOTHING. Those were personal items I will never be able to reproduce so you can imagine how disappointed I am in myself (for forgetting) and this establishment (for their dishonesty).  Thus, because of my poor experience, I will NEVER return to this Chili's establishment again."
