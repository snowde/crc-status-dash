Sonia S.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",0,1,,1.0,7/31/2016,"The food and service there was beyond horrible!#!# We decided to stop in after a long day of shopping and could not believe a thick dark hair was found in our salad.  Ruined our day especially my daughters meal. After that our other meals didnt look appealing much! Honestly we were done - our stomachs turned! I told our waiter who apologized on his behalf and said he would take care of it. Well he called the manager who approached us and said he would take it off the bill and if we would like something else. My daughter said thank you but she's fine and did not want anything ( seriously after what she saw). Now when the bill arrived personally by the manager it still had the meal on it. HE only took 10% off. I asked the manager to come back at our table to explain ""why"" 10% ....he took the bill back returned to our table & slammed the bill in front of me again and then left!!!! It was only changed it to 15% my point this whole thing Totaling was appalling!!!They should be reported to the NJ Department of Health- not sanitary at all! I should of just walked out but didnt want to make a bigger scene in front of my family and the restaurant  so I ended up paying the bill leaving no tip, which is still not right.  I'm definately going to report this to NJ DoH and to Chiles main headquarters regarding their management's rude behavior and unsanitary food code violations."
Brandon M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,5,1,2.0,7/29/2016,Didn't write down anything and got 3 out of 4 orders wrong. Food quality was junk and not the chili's I know. Totally not worth the time and money.
Sheesh S.,"Maplewood, NJ",2,139,,1.0,9/1/2014,"Bad.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger.  It came out completely dry like it had been sitting in the window for a long time.  And it had mayo, NO barbecue sauce.  Oh, and the bacon was just bacon bits, not real slices of bacon.  Seriously? Girlfriend ordered the chicken sandwich that was supposed to come with bacon, avocado and cheese.  It was lacking the bacon.  When she saw they duped me with bacon bits she was willing to let it go. Fries weren't fresh.  Food was lukewarm when served. Restaurant was sticky.  Bathrooms horrendously gross.  Overall, the worst Chilis I have ever been to.  I've been to other HMS Chilis locations like at the airport and while most HMS restaurants suck in general, they are better than this Chilis.  This place isn't passable and needs to be closed."
Bianca A.,"Elizabethport, NJ",50,65,105,1.0,4/25/2015,Horrible service ...ordered a beer and the glass was cracked for one ..number 2 we Didnt even order a appetizer an it took 50 min an we never got our food ..lady tells us it will be a little longer an offers us a free beer an chips n dip which we Never got as well very dissapointed an won't be back .
David D.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,20,25,1.0,11/18/2014,"Fries taste bad maybe the oil is old.... The service is good, but the food is just not good"
Lesley D.,"Des Plaines, IL",46,14,10,2.0,5/21/2016,I usually love coming to chillis but this place is gross. The bathrooms have piles of toilet paper piled up all around with grossness in those piles... Food was good but our waitress didn't bother to refill my water until we asked for the bill... Not the best experience...
Kakhaber C.,"Livingston, NJ",0,19,6,1.0,6/22/2015,"Food taste horrible , i order bacon burger abd i get after 2 min like mcdonalds ... 0 stars from me"
Bill P.,"Rahway, NJ",0,63,1,4.0,11/29/2014,"We were nervous to come here based on the previous reviews but apparently the new manager James is trying to change things. Service was lightning fast on the Saturday after Black Friday, when we could hardly park. Annie couldn't have done better, and even the guy sweeping the floors asked us how everything was.  Better than average experience!"
Andrea H.,"West New York, NJ",230,17,26,1.0,2/28/2016,"If I could give zero stars, I would! I just had the most horrific experience. I came in to have dessert with my boyfriend and his daughter. We walked to the bar area to wait for a table. A man, visibly drunk, leaned over into me and asked for his daughter's name. I asked why and then he proceeded to ask my boyfriend his name. He stated it wasn't our child and he was calling the police. We told him to go right ahead and we asked for a manager. We explained the situation and moved to a different area. The man was allowed to stay at the bar, although clearly intoxicated. We decided to close our tab and finish our drink. As we were about to walk out, he jumped out of his seat and chased us to the door, as if reaching for our little girl. It was terrifying to her and so upsetting. I can't believe that the manager did nothing to remove this man after we first told him that we was harassing us. We will never be back!"
Rio C.,"Livingston, NJ",108,13,1,1.0,3/25/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I would. It's a Friday night, they're clearly low on servers but the place isn't packed at all!!!!!! I see TONS of empty tables and I see why. It's 8pm apparently no soup at this hour. I've seen EVERY server roll their eyes at some customer that they have AND just to get seated, we waited 10 minutes while a lady who's shirt says ""host"" saw three different parties waiting and just kept cleaning tables when they were all empty????? Literally almost all tables were empty??? Servers are clearly texting on the job, I've asked for the bill 3 times and the server just told me the amount, didn't even print out the check just shouted it out loud. I'm literally so surprised that this place is this awful. Please avoid yourself the trouble and don't even bother looking at this place let alone considering to eat here."
Miran C.,"San Francisco, CA",272,575,200,2.0,4/4/2011,"I am a ""shrug, it's a chain"" diner when it comes to TGI, Applebee, etc. But a normal Chili's is surprisingly flavorful with huuuge portions THIS location is actually a Chili's To Go.  Bascially, this is a half-arse, Poor Man's version of a real Chili's with no price difference to speak out! The menu is abbreviated and includes some selections from a normal Chili's, but there is a big quality difference between Chili's and Chili's To Go. At a normal Chili's, the Chicken Margarita is a dish comprised of 2 chicken breasts that are juicy, grilled, and flavorful.  The black beans are like those served in a stand alone Mexican restaurant and the rice with tortilla strips and pico de gallo is complementary.   At To Go, it was a meagre version with dry chicken, blah rice, and very runny and unenhanced canned beans.     It should cost $5. You're better off just getting something at the Food Court, honestly.    Service was pleasant but slow to bring the check."
Jim B.,"North Bergen, NJ",84,90,6,1.0,2/2/2013,"Sat for 10 minutes before our waitress came over. Placed our order, including one soda & two waters, She delivered one water & two sodas. Celery that came with the wings was dried out, obviously had been sitting around for a while. I was finishing up my second beer when I noticed a BUNCH OF CRAP FLOATING IN THE GLASS. Waitress apologized & took 15% off the bill. They don't do the 2 for $20 dinner deals, food is much more expensive than at any other Chili's. Bad service, dirty tables. Do they simply not care because they're in a mall, & know they're not likely to get a lot of repeat customers?  I wish I had read the other reviews beforehand! AVOID."
Eve H.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",587,193,404,1.0,12/9/2013,"Didn't plan a stop at Jersey Gardens correctly and needed a place to eat a few minutes into our shopping. After a quick stroll through the food court decided that it would probably be a better bet to grab lunch at a ""real"" restaurant. The staff at this Chili's is very, very friendly and attentive. However, the food is bland, arrived at table cold and dry. To make matters worse, the restaurant janitor decided halfway through our lunch to.... MOP.. yup, you got that right, moping the floors.. Clorox bleach and all. The smell was intoxicating, my daughter had her newborn, we asked for the check and left. Should have known better, this Chili's has a ""grimy-ish"" look and feel to it."
J L.,"Middletown, CT",138,743,262,1.0,8/12/2014,Worst Chili's ever.  Wish I read the reviews before dining here.  All the servers & even the manager just sit and congregate around the station in the middle of the dining room.  The place was 2/3 empty and it took them 15 minutes to take a drink order.
Tess A.,"Honolulu, HI",116,111,487,3.0,8/23/2014,"I've been to this restaurant many times, I know the service is poor and slow but it's the only place to sit and unwind in the mall after shopping for couple hours. I prefer chilis over applebees anyday. I gave them 2 stars because of the slow service..I give 5 stars to the first and only server over qualified to be working here is who served me today. His name is Christian. I observe a lot and I notice him running around checking on everyone with his eye contacts. Everyone else is on slow motion mode.  Shame on the managing partner who runs this place. Altho it was my choice to go there knowing that the service is poor but thank God that the server today was a life saver., so I can't complain."
Amanda D.,"Newark, NJ",344,245,42,2.0,10/18/2012,"The restaurant is always messy. There are always dirty tables that haven't been cleaned. I don't know, but I think it might be a lack of management in my opinion.  Service is always crappy. I always get a waiter/waitress who really doesn't look like they're interested in being there If you're so unhappy, don't work there. Keep in mind this is not a regular Chili's, it's a Chili's Too.  They have a different menu than the regular Chili's and the food is not of the same quality as a Chili's. The last time I was here just really pissed me off. The hostess tells us that we have to wait for the table to be cleaned. It took 10 minutes for a table to be cleaned! Anyway, once thee table is finally cleaned and my boyfriend and I are finally seated, we waited another 10 minutes someone to come over to take our order but no one ever did! We look over to the bar and there's about 4 or 5 waitresses hanging out and talking. Meanwhile there are about 4 tables that had to be waited on! At that point, we decided to leave and go to the Ruby Tuesdays across the street!"
Lee T.,"Manhattan, NY",81,27,8,1.0,8/20/2014,"If I could, I would give zero stars. As soon as we got there, we waited forever for a hostess to show up. As soon as we were seated, we waited forever for our waiter. When I ordered a dish, I asked my waiter ( Cristian or something like that) if they could do it without the vegetables on my meat and he said it was fine. As soon as my dish arrived, guess what? It was full of whatever vegetables ON MY MEAT. If they can't do any changes, please don't say they will do it. Awful service. Never coming back there again"
Tom T.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",2,12,11,1.0,6/14/2014,I wish I had looked at the reviews on yelp before setting foot into this zoo from the minute we walked in here I just had a bad feeling. No friendly greeting service was super slow and we choked on food while we waited for refills. Eat drink beware.
Bobby C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",98,276,115,3.0,10/7/2012,"I skipped the burger and went with the California club sandwich. It was really good! I don't even know why I ever get burgers. They're just flavorless, ground up meat. It's sort of like the beer of foods. It doesn't taste good but you love it anyway.  The restaurant itself could be cleaner. I understand it's pretty busy and the waitresses were doing their best to get things done quickly. Be careful ordering alcohol here, the prices aren't on the menu and for a good reason... You'd never order it if they were.  It's a mall so my expectations weren't high and that's a good thing. But I am still pleasantly surprised with how good my sandwich was. Skip the burger!"
