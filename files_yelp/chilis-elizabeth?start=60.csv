Suzanne V.,"Fort Lee, NJ",16,3,,1.0,9/8/2014,"Don't get excited when you see the recognizable Chili logo. I did and quickly headed over. Was pleasantly surprised to see that there was no wait despite a jam packed mall on a busy Sunday afternoon. That should've been the first red flag. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. Our waitress informed us she was taking her 30-minute break but introduced us to another waitress who would be filling in. During the next 30 minutes, our drinks and appetizer plates were empty. Being ignored by the waitress, we had to call someone else to inquire about getting refills and the whereabouts of our meal. After one lame excuse after another, our cold food was served. The ""manager,"" realizing what a horrible experience eating at this Chilis was, offered us a free meal. Overall, this is the worst Chilis, hands down. Do yourself a favor and head over to the food court instead!"
Schnovey B.,"Irvington, NJ",4,69,36,1.0,3/10/2014,This is the worst Chilli's in history! I work in the mall and every time we call ahead our food is not ready. Well today they topped that but not even putting in our order when we called 25 minutes ago! The worst!!!
Odette M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",98,29,12,1.0,7/1/2012,"I enjoy eating at Chili's.  Unfortunately, this one left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively and literally). I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well; I received it medium rare - leaning more towards the ""rare.""  The server did not deserve the 20% tip I left ( always leave 20%, will leave more if it's better service - I'm an ex server...what can I say) and the manager was rude and not accommodating at all. I receive Chili's specials via e-mail, when I tried to redeem a free desert, the manager on duty said no, no explanation offered.  I think corporate needs to remove it's name from this location or make participation mandatory. You're better off eating at the food court in the mall.  :-P"
Marie B.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,14,,1.0,9/5/2015,"WORST CHILIS EVER. everyone thinks ""oh. It's a chilis chain. Can't be that bad"". NO ITS BAD. go to the food court and wait on those long lines! Trust me. Waited forever for the food and when it came out, everything was wrong/cold/horrible.  Even the manager didn't care when we complained. Really ruined the Chilis experience for me. This horrible place would be rated 0 stars if it was possible."
Marlenie G.,"Iselin, NJ",21,2,,1.0,3/13/2014,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Worst experience I have ever had. Slow employees, slow with serving drinks and slow for serving food!! We waited 20 minutes for someone to greet us. I was a server before so I was very patient. Then when our server came and took our order, we waited another 20 minutes for our drinks. Now I start to get impatient. It took 45 min for the appetizers just to come out. After he served the appetizers, 5 minutes later, he came back with our entrees. After eating my steak, I found hair in my broccoli. I almost blew a fuse!! Manager comes and apologizes to us and says he will take care of the bill because of the inconvenience. Yea sure. He took off $4.80. Poor service and will never go back again. I rather starve."
EJ O.,"Morristown, NJ",0,16,3,1.0,10/9/2014,"Lousy service, below average food. I wasted almost an hour here on a slow Thursday afternoon. Avoid at all costs and go to the food court!"
Lindsay M.,"Deptford Township, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2015,"This is by far the worst restaurant I have ever encountered! I work for a chain restaurant and been in this business 13+ years, so I understand there are times when there are long waits, waitresses that give poor service, etc! Been there. My daughter and I came here as a last resort seeing as the food court was packed. Looking back I would of rather waited for a table to clear out there then pay to eat at chili's too! We had a 15-20 minute wait, our names were called within 10. Our host sat us a table that was clearly dirty as it was ""flagged"" with a ketchup bottle, meaning in our industry the table needs to be wiped. He picked up the bottle and with his hand wiped the crumbs and straw wrapper to the floor! We should of left then. Sadly we stayed. Took another 10 minutes to be greeted in which I have the complete order to the server. Ordered apperizer-child's meal, and soup and salad for myself. Took the server another 10 minutes just to get our drinks.  My water had some unknown black substance floating in it.  We never even got our appetizer. Just our meals in which the chili was terrible I did complain about that. It was taken off the bill. No one ever checked to see what was wrong, just dropped the bill.  I would never eat here EVER again! It was disgusting!!!!"
Drew L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",3,16,,1.0,8/13/2012,"Chili's in general is pretty blah, this one takes the blah cake. Poor service and soggy food. Just don't go here."
Todd S.,"Memphis, TN",3,26,2,1.0,1/14/2013,"Ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of black beans from the ""light"" menu.  There was no honey-mustard sauce on the sandwich and I was served red beans instead of black. Server was friendly and the food was served quickly. Major star reduction when you can't prepare a sandwich as advertised in the menu.  Not sure how you confuse red with the word black.  Would not recommend to anyone."
Chris W.,"Bayville, Berkeley Township, NJ",4,43,52,2.0,2/20/2013,Just had a Drink at Bar. I was told to not eat there. Thanks to the Yelper's who took the time to review it. I always check my Yelp before entering!!!!!!
JJ J.,"Hudson County, NJ",25,173,84,1.0,11/17/2012,"Ok, eating here was the ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT ANY EATERY!! There is NO WAY I could ever reccomend this place, even to someone I didn't care to much for! This is a ""Chili's Too"" so it carries the brand name but with a limited menu that like others have said, is not of the same quality by any means! My husband and  popped in here for a quick bite while shopping. We were seated and our waitress came out a while later for our order. We ordered drinks, and appetizer, soups and salads and dinner.    We never saw anyone again....About 20 minutes later a NASTY and I do emphasize NASTY bowl of soup came out for me..where was my husbands? Then our drinks....then nothing. No one even looked at us to see if we were ok. All the while workers were cleaning tables with windex that was flying all in the air, you could tase it in your mouth and everyone was complaining....yet it continued.  About 20 minutes after that, our dinner came out, with a side salad that was now given to my husband, but what happened to the appetizer? Our new waiter explained that our old waiter never told him about it ?????? What? I asked about the soup/ salad screw up and he was totally confused...So I just asked for a refill on my soda.....no one ever came back! After ten minutes I finally got up and approached a hostess, asking them for soda b/c no one else was around. Ten minutes later, they brought me one. After all of this nonsense, we simply asked for the bill and wanted to get out of there. In th meantime, people at the tables on either side of us both complained of mixed up or forgotten orders...ridiculous! The bill was a MESS, there were all sorts of things that they never served us but were attempting to charge us for. The appetizer that was once forgotten, was now appearing on our bill...seriously?! So after that was squared away, I approached the manager who looked like a deer in the headlights...She simply said ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and handed me free chips and salsa coupons for when I COME BACK?! I explained to her that we would never be back but will be more then happy to use them at a different location and promptly left.  Please, steer clear! Unless you enjoy crummy food and terrible service!"
Felicia K.,"West New York, NJ",73,346,17,2.0,2/5/2011,"This place runs like it's drowning in molasses... be prepared to wait for a table for 20 minutes while you gaze upon dirty vacated tables that haven't been cleaned for 10 minutes.  God forbid you point it out to one of the hosts/hostesses... they will only be defensive.  Not only did I point this out, but after we were seated and eating near the entrance, we heard two other people do the exact same thing... with the same non-results.  In any case, concepts such as ""speed"" or ""turning over tables"" just are not in existence here. Once we were seated, it was a bit better.  Our waitress, while not overly friendly, was efficient and prompt, and got the specifics of my burger correct (black bean burger instead of beef, no mayo, honey mustard on the side). The food tasted good, but it later made me sick, which is extremely rare for me.  I have a stomach of steel and hardly ever get sick from food.  So... I'm guessing this was some nasty shit. It's sad that there are so few decent food options at this mall, but I still suggest that you avoid this restaurant."
Jason G.,"Greencastle, PA",8,184,,1.0,9/29/2012,The waitress took forever to come over to our table. When the food was brought out every server except our original waitress was involved. She was too busy talking to other servers. After my cheese burger came out wrong she said sorry and walked away. Not a fan of this location. There is a very nice food coaurt around the corner. Highly recommended eating there instead...we wish we did.
Nancy H.,"Hillsborough, NJ",1,19,,1.0,1/18/2012,"I've been to alot of Chili's and this is by far the worst ever.  The bathrooms were utterly disgusting, water on the floor, water dripping off the sink spilling onto the floor, someone could slip and fall.  My daughter asked for a simple cheeseburger.  It arrived practically raw!  We sent it back.  After probably 15 minutes, I had finished my salad, her burger arrives, with mustard one it.  We told the waitress, she wanted to give us a new bun, which she did.  Meanwhile the mustard was embedded in the meat so for anyone who doesn't like mustard, it was a no go. Service was crappy, we never had the same person.  The only person who attempted to rectify our problem was the host, a young guy.   Needless to say, next time I shop at Jersey Gardens, I will avoid this Chili's."
Samantha L.,"Elizabeth, NJ",186,273,13,2.0,5/24/2011,"Way too expensive, but the food's one of the more tolerable places to eat in the mall. Just be sure you bring a book with you because the wait is interminable!"
Shuk R.,"Flushing, NY",0,23,,1.0,1/19/2014,"Service is horrible. We were seated and waited and waited and waited for a server or anyone who works there to come and take our order. Then someone came and took our order and the food arrived. The only problem is we had no silverware and we waited and waited again for the server to get forks to be able to eat the food on the table. And then it took forever again to get the server's attention to refilk our drinks. The food was not bad, but the service took really long. There were plenty of workers around so don't know why it takes forever to take our order and to eat."
Liam M.,"Apalachin, NY",57,14,10,2.0,10/9/2012,Inside the mall. Water tasted horrible. food was not that much better.
Greg K.,"Elizabeth, NJ",1,1,,1.0,4/15/2012,Non-participating franchise.  Over-priced menu.  Try to avoid unless necessary.   Too much traffic for good service.  Kids menu are frozen dinners.
Ronald D.,"Jersey City, NJ",122,183,121,3.0,12/14/2009,"I know this is a chain and I don't normally write up on chains, because these are the last places true Yelpers go to when in need of a fix, but I believe that one item on their menu is review worthy.  I typically hit up the food court at malls, but this mall is so ghetto, you're better off eating off site or suck it up and hit up a sit down chain and this was one of those times.  I wasn't hungry when I got there but after a few hours of Christmas shopping with the family, we had to eat here.  Instead of choosing their many high calorie, high sodium items, I picked the lesser of many evils and went to my ""Go To"" choice, a burger.  The burger was the Peppercorn burger.  This burger was the best chain burger I've experienced.  So much so, I order it anytime I am in an airport terminal that has a Chili's Express.  The last time I went to a Chili's, I suggested the burger to a co-worker.  He requested it and the waiter said that the burger was discontinued, but he would have the cook make him one anyway.  The next time he went, they told him they no long make those.  I guess, depending on the day or mood, you could probably ask them if they could hook you up."
Protest M.,"Iselin, NJ",0,2,,1.0,3/13/2012,I go to chilis often .. when I saw chilis in jersey garden mall I was so happy to get in but it took 20 minutes for a hostes to make me seated coz I had a baby stroller and shopping cart ...it's say will u enter in restaurant stroller and shopping cart not allowed in restaurant  ....it sound me so funny  shopping cart is ok but a stroller how can a person leave his stroller outside the restaurant and go in ..at last I requested the hostes that mg baby is sleeping and the shopping Cart is which I paid $5 for it for just shopping if I leave out side and some body takes it I have take on other cart where I have to pay more 5 $....he agreed and gave me seat corner of the bar where garbage can and brooms mops where kept first I had no option so I took it it was so horrible smelling area where I was been seated I felt like I eating in Bathroom ..
