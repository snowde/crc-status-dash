Irene B.,"Encino, CA",69,149,224,3.0,12/8/2017,"Just a Chili's. The decor is much modern than a couple years back, which really attacks the younger crowds!  Still with all TV's powering any type of sports you might like! We had a beer and the President Margarita. ~$17/for both.  The Margarita was very tasty. I could taste the perfect amount of Tequila!  We ordered the frech fries with cheese and bacon (small $5). It was definitely not good, the fries were so dry like if they were cooked the day before.  Bottom line, you know what you are going to get at a Chili's. I will be back for the next cool sport event but that's kind of it.  Cheers!"
Suzy H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,161,36,2.0,12/27/2017,"First off, the short sticky manager with no name tag is an ass to his employees. My daughter, my grandson and I were her today to have a late lunch. My grandson was hungry and tired and threw his apple juice on the floor (he's 22 months old). I went and told the host , who was an absolute amazing person and very helpful, about it. He came over and mopped the spill up and brought another apple juice. The Mgr. Then came over and made the guy get rags, get down on the floor practically and dry it up all the while giving us a dirty look. Excuse me, but I'm paying your salary. Anyway, we had tacos and the new honey chipotle boneless wings. The tacos were good. Stick with original boneless wings if you're going to order the wings. The honey chipotle wings weren't that good. The molten lava cake and the coffee were delish. The manager definitely needs some training. I might be back but not soon. The ambiance has completely changed from 6 months ago. It just wasn't enjoyable. Waited a year before I came back with my daughter and grandson again. Service still crappy. Food wasn't hot except for the chili. Kids small meal of sliders & corn on the cob was near cold and corn tasted old. They forgot the fries but once I told the waitress she brought them-cold. Molten lava cake was good. It still wasn't enjoyable and the whole place had 4 people eating there. So my daughter loves the nachos and so, we went back. This time it took around 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Bleh still. There was 1 waitress running around for 9 tables!!! Asked for the check because zooksk wasn't working... received wrong check, then it took another 20 minutes to receive the correct check. My daughter missed her dance class because it took an hour and a half for lunch. Hopefully I've learned my lesson and will NOT go back!!!!!!"
Elizabeth Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,66,128,4.0,11/26/2017,My coworkers and me stumbled across this Chili's to kill some time. Turned out becoming one of our go to spots for happy hour on Wednesdays. Not too bad of a place!  The food? Decent for happy hour prices. We usually order the chips and guac and an order of boneless wings.  Drinks? I stick with beer. But I've heard their margaritas are good too.  Service? 90% of the time our servers have been super cool and nice. I won't complain!
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",259,813,3193,1.0,9/5/2017,Awful! This was my first time ever at a Chili's Restaurant. I had some friends who live in the area wanted to meet for happy hour. So I said sure. As I time to spare I was going back home to SD. After parking we decided to seat at the bar area. Nobody even greeted us to say hello and welcome. So we sat the bar area. 20 minutes goes by nobody coming to ask us for are drink orders or we had any questions on the menu. As it was happy hour time.  I noticed the happy hour menu. As we never got a chance to even get a glass of water.  So I said give another 5 minutes before I am leaving. Sure enough I gave it another 10 minutes. Nobody came over to take are drink or food order. At that point I just walked out and refuse to talk to a manager. When one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.  You have large private lot parking and street parking.
Ben S.,"Glendale, CA",513,19,2,5.0,11/26/2017,"I have been to Chili's all over the country, this is by far the best in America! Katrina was the best server I've ever had ever! She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and have the greatest Chilis experience ever! The Coca-Cola's, the chips kept coming, the meals fresh and delicious, all of it amazing from the moment I walked in until the moment i left, amazing! Thank you Chilis! I love you more than I love my girlfriend."
David P.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",20,138,115,3.0,10/9/2017,"I used to like this Chili's better than the one in Northridge. Unfortunately, my experience yesterday ruined that perception. I walked in and there was no host or hostess to be found. I stood there looking at all the available tables thinking I would be seated right away if anyone ever showed up to seat me. The host finally showed up and said there would be a fifteen minute wait. I looked at all the empty tables and wondered why there was a wait. There were several small booths right in front perfect for a party of one. When I was finally seated I looked around the restaurant. Tables were full of plates and glasses that had yet to be cleared after the previous customers had left. The restaurant is apparently understaffed. Somebody needs to hire a busser or two to clean off tables. Chili's recently removed a large number of items from their menu. Gone is one of my favorites, the steak and shrimp with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes. All I ever had to do was substitute broccoli for the mashed potatoes and I was in low carb heaven. I realize the menu was getting too big and they wanted to simplify it but this was a disappointment for me. Except for the fajitas the menu is absent of shrimp. Anyway I ordered a smokehouse combo. Served on a metal tray the combo is offered with two or three meat selections, chili garlic bread, fries, roasted street corn, and pickles. Sure it ruined my low carb diet but their was plenty of protein. I chose the chicken crispers, jalapeno cheddar sausage, and BBQ chicken breast. The fourth option is a half rack of ribs for $2.00 extra. The fries were hot and crispy and flavorful. The chili garlic bread was good as was the street corn. I liked the sausage as the jalapenos were mild and didn't burn my mouth. The chicken crispers weren't very crispy and looked more like chicken tenders  from the kids menu than they did in the photo on the menu. The BBQ chicken breast was a good size but I was full and took it home for a later meal. The staff were running around doing there best to please the customers and were friendly and as attentive as they could be under the circumstances. I was miffed that the Ziosk table entertainment system was not working at my table. I always enjoy playing the trivia game. I was even more miffed when a $1.99 table entertainment charge was added to my bill. This was quickly removed by the server."
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,5.0,4/17/2017,"Cool place to happy hour!  Prices are great!!  On Sunday it's happy hour all day and that's what I came here for  They have appetizers starting at $4 and up super cheap and so worth it  Drinks start around $4 and up as well  Well sprits start at 3.50 can't beat that! Although I still stick to my favs, can't do well cause ain't want that headache lol  They even make skinnys! (Great cocktails with half the calories) O yeah!  But super amazing deal and great bartenders here"
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1380,381,2.0,10/30/2017,"Why bother.... because we wanted a lace with TVs to watch the game and no wait. Marginal food, marginal service....All the trappings of a huge corporate chain. No prices on the drink menu? Who does that? When will these place learn that the crappy kiosks that they place on the table take up too much room and never properly work? Dennys, TGIFridays and Chili's use these to ""speed up"" service. Wrong. They don't work well."
Lily G.,"Van Nuys, CA",30,113,151,5.0,9/1/2017,"We always come here if we are in the mood for good food with decent prices and yummy drinks. Their baby back ribs are delicious , I don't know if they still have the Dr. Pepper sauce but it's sooo gooood!!  Their cocktails are really well made at this location , especially margaritas. My favorites have been the triple Berry and their seasonal watermelon margarita , super tasty! The 2 for $22 deal is pretty good , usually my wife and I don't get it because she likes different things on the menu lol but it's a great deal!  I would definitely recommend this place , the wait usually isn't long , except for Friday and Saturday nights due to the dinner rush .  Worth checking out !"
SarahJane G.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,61,24,2.0,11/5/2017,2 stars because the 2 for 22 was a good deal. Other than that it was a disappointment .Waitress never returned with the lemon for our water nor did she return to ask if we needed more drinks. I had to flag her down for napkins and she didn't return with them until we were done with our meal. Before she scurried away I asked for our check. She looked at me sideways and pointed at the little kiosk at the end of the day as if I'm just supposed to know that's were you pay.  It was an enjoyable time because it was date night but this won't be a spot I will be returning to.
Sam W.,"Burbank, CA",10,121,8,2.0,10/25/2017,"It's not a gourmet meal by any means but I happen to like Chilis Margaritas and their Southwestern Eggrolls. I used to like going to this location over other locations in the valley but recently I had two really poor experiences here, one last month and another last weekend. Last weekend I went to the Encino location around 12:30. When we arrived we were told by what we thought was the host that there were was nothing available except for one booth in the bar and we would have to eat there. There was no option of waiting for a table in the dining room. We reluctantly sat in the bar and our host is actually a waiter, then it clicked he was trying to fill his section which annoyed me from the start.  After I order a manager comes over and asks us why we sat at that table, I explained that we were told to sit there. Apparently the waiter/host bussed someone's meal while they were in the restroom and not finished. We offered to move tables but they told us to stay and so we had to eat with the other table glaring at us. If that wasn't bad enough the manager seemed to offer no apology when I said this entire experience is making me feel really awkward. Also during the end with our meal the waiter/host and a bartender were having an argument and shouting over our booth. All in all, it was one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I've had in quite a long time. I'll still go to Chilis, but this location is on a time out for a while."
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,4.0,4/17/2017,"If you've been to one Chili's, you've been to them all, right? I suppose, but customer service always plays a big role in each location. My daughter and I drove down to LA to visit my brother. It was later on a Friday evening, close to 10PM. We checked into the hotel and then decided that we were all hungry. I usually like to venture out to different places when in a new area, but we were hungry and I wanted to go to a place that I knew would be open. I found that Chili's was a few miles away from the hotel and we decided to come here. By the time that we got there, it was only going to be open for another half an hour, so we hurried in. We were seated right away, but luckily there were other people in both the dining room and bar, so we weren't the only people in there. Our waiter came around and took our order. We tried to have our orders ready, so it would take forever since they were closing soon. The food was fine, came out correctly and how we ordered it. Some people like it, others don't. It is saltier than a lot of other restaurants, but it tastes like that at all the other locations. I wish that I could remember our servers name, but he made the experience great. He wasn't pushy about trying to get us out of there right away, even though we came in close to closing. I was thankful for a good meal after being on the road for most of the day!"
Jaden A.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,14,3,1.0,10/27/2017,Slow place. Takes forever! to pick up food from the Togo section. Don't even bother. Will never come here again.  They told me 10 minutes and it took close to 25.
Jim F.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,135,38,1.0,8/28/2017,"Ordered their famous ribs and they were disgusting. Clearly sitting in a heating bin all day. The sauce was caked and the meat that wasn't covered in sauce was like jerky.  Would have been 2 stars if they hadn't charged me $2 gaming fee. They plop an ipad down on your table. It lets you order deserts and look at items. There are also crappy little games. We launched a trivia game. AT NO TIME was there a warning of any kind that certain activities on the ipad was billable. It showed up on our bill as a ""gaming fee"". I wasn't going to put up a fuss about a lousy $2 surcharge but if Chilli's has the nerve to charge people like that without telling them, they deserve all the 1 star reviews they can get."
Tawnya E.,"Beverly Hills, CA",85,74,33,5.0,10/2/2017,"Food was good and the service had a genuine feel of excellence not for money but to provide good service. First impressions for this Chili's location was great. We came Sunday for dinner we don't have to wait. Our server ( Janine)  really nice and professional and the menu is improved, I love the honey Chipotle and waffles and I asked if I can order the waffles only she said no because waffles is special imported from Belgium and the dont have for waffles only in the menu. Not sure if it's because the area is nicer and upscale but I wish more places in Los Angeles could be this well served."
Milan F.,"Henderson, NV",128,12,17,5.0,8/15/2017,Foods gotten even better got a simple coupon suggested from my phone and saved 10$ on my meal the restaurants clean Nd has an open feel too it and I never recommend any food items but you have to try their honey chipotle crispers
Doc S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,28,1.0,6/21/2017,"This has to be the worst restaraunt in Encino, California.   The servers and management are dishonest.   I received an email yesterday about a $10 dinner-special, and Chilis Encino has it adversely on Yelp as well. I get there and am told it stopped months ago and now the new special is more with no dessert.   They now say the $10 dinners are 1/3 sized dinners but no Where is it stated.   They charged extra for rice and beans, and both were cold.  The entire dinner was cold and terrible.   Customers who entered 20 minutes after use were services 20 minutes before.  Why?  They did not ask for the special that no one heard of.  Although the booth behind asked for the same menu.  The chicken breast was hard.  The beans and rice were cold and hard with blond hairs. The chip plate was not offered to go.  All we ate was. 2 cups of Coke and 2 cups of ice tea.  When asked how it was in that it was all there said ""terrible"" and response was ""that's good"".  But he did want to make sure about his 20% tip.  What a concept. Don't listen to customer.  When customer tells you about issues just ask for bigger tip.  The food was not edible. Even my dog's palate is above the food served."
Jamie L.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",418,6,3,1.0,7/9/2017,"ZERO stars. Second bad experience here, my bad for going back. We went back to cash in on a free chicken sandwich that they gave us from a previous bad experience.  BIG MISTAKE. ROTTEN food.  Pictures attached. Wrong order again, unacceptable wait time and absurd customer service. Staff was confused and unable to apply logic. Pictures speak for themselves.  Management INSISTED my husband bring back the rotten food to receive his refund.  He is en route.  Let you know if he actually gets the refund.  Can NOT believe how disgusting this TAKE-OUT order was.  He ordered it on the phone as he drove there so there was not a wait time between ""prep"" and our table.  Shocking how disgusting this food was and how terrible the staff was."
Greg M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,4,,5.0,11/2/2017,"Love this place. Good food fast service the people are nice. I go here with my family all the time, and we all enjoy our time and get full for a good price. They also have a very good bar good variety and fair prices. If you haven't been here defenetly a stop by spot. Stop by try it out u won't regret it...."
Jacquline B.,"Los Angeles, CA",264,11,5,5.0,10/27/2017,I always enjoy coming to Chili's it's my kind of favorite spot to come I'm here during the World Series Dodgers and Astros... bartender Shante is amazing she is the best EVER...
Jennifer S.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",5,12,6,4.0,8/14/2017,"I've been here three times in the last month, but my recent visit (2 days ago) was just great! I was in the mood for a Guacamole Burger which is why I decided to drive to Chili's once again! The staff was extra attentive and they checked in every 10 minutes or so to make sure that all our needs were satisfied. I unfortunately cannot recall the names of the two people who served us our meals but I will update this review if I gather further information. Overall great service and even greater tasting food (although the quesadillas could be improved haha)."
Jenny C.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,13,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I ordered from grub hub. And they did not send me the soup that I ordered, my burger was over cooked and burnt, and I had special instructions that they didn't follow. I also called chili's prior and the man who answered was extremely rude to me!"
Kenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,20,25,1.0,3/10/2017,"NOT the Chili's I fell in love with back in high school and early college.  You go in and are greeted by a luke warm host who probably wants a better job than the one he has.  You are then promptly seated in a 'not so busy' restaurant. The server was friendly enough and I have no issues with him. The food though... terrible.  I used to love the chicken crispers with honey mustard.  It has been several years since I've eaten at Chili's and I was super excited, but when I got my food, I got overcooked chicken and corn. The fries were only so-so. If I was going to cheat and consume this many calories, I wished I spent it on better food. To add insult to injury, we got charged an entertainment fee for using the tablet on the table, which I gave to my toddler.  The Breakdown: Food: 1 Service: 3 Ambience: 3 (you've been to one Chili's, you've been to them all) Stay away and save your money (and calories) for something else."
Lynne A.,"Tarzana, CA",771,841,896,4.0,9/8/2016,"Came tonight for dinner with my daughter. It was very busy in the bar area, but we got a booth by the kitchen. Our waitress was friendly, didn't get her name though. I had the beef/shrimp fajitas. I was starving as I just got back from the convention center, with 1.30 mins in 405 traffic! Food came pretty quick and hit the spot. My daughter had a burger and fries. She said it was good. My waitress brought me a second club soda, just as i was finishing my first, that was great. Didn't have room for dessert, but that lava cake looks bomb! All in all was pretty good."
Myster M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,3/17/2017,"This used to be a fun place to go have a couple drinks a few apps have fun and watch a Ball game specially during Happy Hour. But, lately, the staff has developed deteriorating attitudes they speak bad and bash customers out in the open. Sticky dirty floors trashy bathrooms bartenders rubbing snot off their noses and cook sticking their hands in their crutch.   Too many place around here to frequent no one needs shitty service; The district management needs to step in and appreciate customers. Or they will walk away."
Felicia A.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,12,10,5.0,10/11/2017,"We order from here for work often. Food is always yummy and hot. Food is always ready fast and ready for pickup when they promise. Customer service is exceptional, I am always greeted with a smile and all employees are attentive from the moment you walk in the door. Great place to pickup lunch prices are great too!"
David E.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,10,1,4.0,10/8/2017,"Needed to make a stop at Michael's Saturday night and the kids asked for Chili's. Not my first choice but it makes them happy. One question: can a get a menu without the calorie count? I've already thrown ""healthy dining"" out the window the minute I walked through the door, do they have to suck all the guilty pleasure out of it by putting those numbers in my face? Anyway, the food was exactly as expected. The kids were thrilled and I felt a little worse about myself for having eaten it."
Julia H.,"TARZANA, CA",0,42,88,5.0,5/18/2017,Love this place. Came in for lunch and was quickly seated. The food comes out nice n hot! Tried the 3 course meal $10 and it's very good! The chicken fajita was perfect. The server was great too.
So Yum O.,"San Diego, CA",13,84,53,3.0,4/7/2017,"Our server was a charm! Great costumer service. He is the reason I gave this many stars.     ...the problem was my food was super salty (already feel parched). I left 90% of my mash potatoes. I guess I could have sent my food back but I wasn't in the mood. The awesome server asked ""how's everything!?"" I lied, ""good!"" Tip: request ""Go easy on the salt please!"""
Keira O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,4.0,9/25/2017,Don't miss this little gem. Best flan I have ever had. Chili relleno was to die for. Worth taking the time to find.
Jason S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1285,137,507,3.0,3/4/2017,Food is not that bad service is better very friendly you do have to wait a little bit for your food not sure what's going on in the kitchen but drinks are always good.
The L.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,53,46,1.0,4/15/2017,This is probably the worst chillis I have been to and I will never return to this one the bartender does not know how to make drinks the service was not good at all food took an eternity and it was slow the restaurant hardly had people there my first time I came to this chillis the service was good but this time it was horrible I don't recommend this place to anyone just go to the one in Northridge or west hills
Justyn M.,"Studio City, CA",601,2,1,2.0,8/10/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Thursday. Food was fine, not the best. But holy crap, we waited 30 minutes to get our bill. The bar wasn't even busy. Not sure what the situation was but service was so slow. Sucks."
John K.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Food is okay.  According to my wife, best margarita in town.  Criticism:  CLEAN THE SALT SHAKERS!...loaded with grease...ugh"
Leslie G.,"Riverside, CA",0,17,2,5.0,3/14/2017,"I recommend this restaurant for large groups. There were eight of us and we didn't wait long. Our server was great she took good care of us she was very patient, took time to explain the menu to my mother, and she even brought her a free dessert and sang happy Birthday to her. It is very hard to find a place that can handle large groups, I understand things can get crazy but this place did a great job."
YouGoGlenCoco S.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,98,108,1.0,10/29/2016,"Good god! I just came home from having dinner at Chili's.. and thought that I'd write this review while sitting on the toilet. I feel TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! My stomach is experiencing something out of this world. I'm also having waves of stomach pains.  I don't know what they had put in my food, but I will NEVER EVER EVER come to this restaurant ever again. Btw I had ordered the combo of salmon and half rack of baby back ribs. Also, the mashed potatoes that this nastiness came with are most definitely from powder. There's absolutely no way this was freshly made from potatoes. I'm so disgusted right now, I can't even put in words."
Isabel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,40,5,5.0,8/3/2017,Amazing customer service . Food was yummy not to mention the Oreo topped molten cake omg it's to die for . I'm glad the brought it back !
Kenneth B.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,4.0,8/13/2017,"I really love chili's. Been there with my girlfriend and the servers were fast, polite, and friendly. Would go back again."
Brittany W.,"West Hollywood, CA",548,54,48,4.0,7/7/2017,"It's a chain restaurant, so what more can I say. However Chilis is my comfort food. The drinks are good, the appetizers are even better and they have a great selection of food! The place is clean though the service was a bit slow but other than that, it was great!"
Justin F.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",214,6,2,2.0,5/27/2017,"Ya are what ya eat, AmirightI wouldnt eat anything from chilis if an earthquake hit cali again and all other restaurants were closed. I wouldn't eat Chilis if i ran a marathon and went close to starvation . Chilis is like the discount fish food at the 99 cents store, its not really food bit it will do the job amiright? Chilis is what you order for your boss that you lowkey despise or your ex girlfriend!"
