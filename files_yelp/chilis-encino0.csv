Roby P.,"North Hollywood, CA",69,68,66,5.0,10/16/2012,I love their ribs and sandwichs are delicious nice place to be at felt a good vibe when I walked in so far haven't been disappointed
Ramon R.,"Glendale, CA",6,95,2,4.0,2/6/2013,"Been here several times and the service has always been great. Their food can be hit or miss but for the most part it is good. I don't understand why in California they do not have great drink specials like in other states. Their happy hour is okay but it's not 2 for 1 :( The steaks here are my favorite part of chillis. Even though they are not expensive, they taste better than some of the $35 steaks I have had. Overall, I recommend this place."
Libby A.,"Monrovia, CA",43,54,10,1.0,1/2/2012,"Terrible service here always . Dumb waitresses n waiters . Slow as hell.

Maybe I should just eat at home from now on . I'm sick of bad service!!"
Diana W.,"San Francisco, CA",73,413,48,2.0,8/15/2010,"It's a huge chain, I know...I'd never been to a Chili's.  Saw that TV commercial (I know, I make the damn things, you think I'd know better than be swayed by them!  Yell at me later, K?) Anyhow, got one of their burgers, meh.  Burned and charred on the outside, rare on the inside.  (I know, most people dig it, but I didn't request that-)  Fries were OK.  No drink refills until after the check and never brought the ketchup.   Nuff ranting bout that one. Least I'm only out $5.99 or so....  Not a lot of warm fuzzies for this one, sorry guys!"
Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80,3.0,3/12/2012,"Chili's is a typical chain American restaurant & grill.  The service can be good or bad depending on factors.  Large groups (8+) tend to over tax them and orders get messed up or forgotten, and will never come out at the same time.  Stick to smaller groups.  This one even tried to set 3 people of a 18 group party by themselves at a different table. As to the food, eh.  Its pretty average across the board.  There are a few really good items, the southwest eggrolls being on the yummy side.  If you have foursquare you can always get free chips and salsa (which are decent) for checking in.  The burgers are decent size and the onion straws are good.  The have a black bean patty if your a veggie eater.   The fajitas have gone a little down hill over the years and are now straight average and not a large portion. The steaks can be surprisingly good if they cook them right (2 out of 3 at our table were good).  There are a decent selection of health opinion as well."
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,2/4/2014,"I come here mostly just for their southwestern mac and cheese, they make the best mac and cheese out there. For just $2.50 No one comes close, its a bit spicy, topped with crunchy breadcrums, cooked to perfection. Fast service and easy to find parking makes it one of my favorite places to come and get some mac and cheese!"
Anne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,1618,3340,2.0,3/29/2012,The best thing about this bar is that I saw a drunk and high Bobby Brown here and I got to tell him how I am (was) a big fan...I also got to take a picture with him. Food is your standard chain-type food. Digestible but I'm always thinking about the quality and number of calories I will be consuming here.
Fiat L.,"Van Nuys, CA",30,42,4,4.0,7/27/2015,I love this Chilis but mainly I love the long islands here! Tried at other Chilis but they don't make them as good. I mainly go to the bar area and the service is always good. I also like the option to pay at the kiosk. Very nice girl working there and sadly I can't recall her name...she has dark hair with bangs and always smiling! If it helps she was working on Saturday night 07/25. She is really hospitable and she definitely does a good job on checking on her tables!
Nathan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,11/8/2014,"I'd like to start this off by congratulating Seth.  Despite my pleas he didn't change the big TV to the UCLA game because his boss gave him other instructions.  kudos for being a loyal employee.  That being said, the owner needs a lesson on flexibility.  Sure, Alabama is ranked higher than UCLA but we are at a chili's that is minutes from Westwood.  Sitting at the bar were numerous patrons wearing UCLA shirts and hats..... Cater to your audience.  Take an informal survey and let the bartender to have the power to change the channel based on  the customers.  I guarantee that you'll make more money."
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,148,2,3.0,3/24/2013,"I walked in with a party of 5. It took 45 minutes to be seated because they were not able to accommodate five people. The only had two to three tables to fit five to six people. After asked the person in the front a few times as to when a table would be ready, she stated as soon as some would got up. A group of six people got up from a table and that open table was given to a party who gave 35 minutes after us and they were seated because the had children. Horrible service. After another 10 minutes, we were finally seated.  Went to the restroom to wash my hands. Disgusting inside. It looked like no one had checked inside the bathroom all day. Washed my hands and got out if there.  Got back to the table and ordered chips and guacamole and  a mango salsa chicken. There were no forks or knives on the table and it took another 10 minutes to get those. By the looks of the picture for this item, I believed it would be a medium sized portion. This portion looked as though it was for a small child. I ordered it with fries and steamed broccoli which were also child sized portions. I was disappointed in the portion size. The chicken and mango salsa tasted good. Chicken was cooked well and the mango salsa tasted fresh. The fries had some overly poured salt and the broccoli was good.  Overall, I do not think I would order this item again because it was such a small portion. The service was good. The waitress would bring water before it even ran out and was nice. I would probably eat at this location again but would order something else."
Mick T.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,34,,2.0,10/11/2011,"Worst Chiles around. Went there Monday to meet my brother for lunch. The place was fairly empty, yet service was long. Got the appetizer same time as the entrees. Appetizer was cold! After we finished our lunch, no one picked up our plates. The waiter dropped the check on a dirty table! Weird..."
Brenda G.,"Daly City, CA",8,26,8,3.0,11/25/2014,"the service is good, drinks are good but the chili is nasty and so are the pickes. I did not lol the chicken tenders they were gross. I don't know if they are always gross but it was nasty.."
Jeremiah P.,"North Hollywood, CA",21,52,13,3.0,4/18/2014,"I only recommend happy hr ..We ordered ribs and fajitas and it was cold. Crappy food, Tgif waayyy better."
Gabriel K.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",223,46,2,1.0,6/15/2013,"06/05/13 table # 21/1 8:07pm 10024  My family and I arrived to this location and were seated within 10 minutes.  I ordered everyone's meal and I ordered a plain burger with fries for myself. We also ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer.  One would think making chips and a burger is pretty fast and the 2 easiest things to make. We received he chips about 2 minutes before the entrees arrived.  The chips was cold and was not fresh in any way.  When the food arrived, there was an issue with the burger which would have been a quick fix. The burger that was supposed to be plain, had everything on it plus more.  Great for a person who likes eating everything but I do not.  The waiters response to the error was that he was not sure what was going on in the kitchen and took it back.  5 minutes later, i was brought another burger that looked plain.  When I took my first bite, all I could taste was ketchup, pickles and tomatoes.  I realized that all the kitchen did was scrape off the condiments and was sent back out. Why not make a new burger.  What if I had allergies.  What if I get sick from something on the burger and that is why I like to have my burgers plain.  We called over the waiter again and advised him of the situation for the second time.  We also advised him that it is not sanitary and safe to do what the kitchen did.  Don't you think if I wanted the stuff off that way, I could have done that? Who are they trying to fool.  It was the kitchens mistake.  He once again said that the kitchen is slacking off and he doesn't know what is going on.  I asked to see a manager at this time.  The manager came by and he was only aware of the first issue.  I explained the situation and he was not really in shock or care.  He just said ok, hell look into in and offered to buy a dessert and walked away. I was in shock of the response I was given. The 3rd burger arrived. I was hesitant to touch it because of possible backlash.  It did look weird and tasted weird so after a few bites, I just ordered dessert and asked for the check. Once the check arrived, I saw something strange.  We were billed twice for the burger.  I called the waiter again.  I advised him of the new issue and he said that I was credit.  I asked him where?  He shows the the dessert credit.  I told him to look again and listen to what I am telling him.  We were charged twice for the plain burger.  He said, its a quick fix, walked away and brought me the correct invoice.  I do not recommend this place at all.  I think the kitchen is not professional and the customer service is horrible.  Taking shortcuts on making a burger because of an error the kitchen made shows no respect to customers or health.  I hope this location gets inspected."
Mr Z.,"Van Nuys, CA",11,7,3,1.0,10/29/2013,"I don't like to talk bad about restaurants I usually give them a two chance minimum.  This place however get a negative on my list.  I took my Mom for her birthday we ordered drinks and fajitas,  she ordered the two item meal. Horrible the food was cold the fajitas were not grilled but stewed. Nothing looked like it should my Mom was nice enough to eat the ribs but left the rest untouched. I sprnt 80 on yucky food and a sad margarita. Never again.  Thumbs down way down."
Helen C.,"Irvine, CA",134,779,,1.0,7/15/2013,"Now that I must dine with a small baby in tow, my options are relatively limited since I'd rather not be *that* person who takes their kid to a restaurant where other patrons give me the this-is-not-a-child-friendly-place-hairy-eyeball.  So chain restaurants are becoming a sanctuary for dining out and, generally speaking, while my expectations are not high I at least anticipate decent enough fare at a Chili's.  I used to recall the Chili's in Westwood serving decent enough burgers and fajitas and a large-ish margarita.  The food here ranged from blech to just OK but the reason for the 1 star is the atrocious state of their chicken fajitas.  Fajitas should always be a safe bet at Chili's.  And by safe, I mean the chicken should look somewhat grilled and piping hot not like microwaved pieces of pre-packaged Tyson's chicken strips.  Can't say that I'd return."
Iris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,4,5.0,6/3/2015,Alexandra was our waitress.  She was friendly and helpful and made our experience wonderful!   Couldn't ask for more.
Jason R.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,35,,1.0,8/16/2013,This was the worst dining experience I have had in a decade! The service was beyond slow.... It took 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get the food. When it arrived the person who got a burger in our group ended up with an almost raw hamburger. We sent it back and rather than making a new properly cooked burger they microwaved the raw one to try and cover for the fact that their cooks don't know what medium rare is. The rest of the experience was disappointing to say the least. I will NEVER set foot in this joke of a Chili's again. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE.
Mel G.,"Tucson, AZ",131,1891,,4.0,12/12/2011,"I write a 4 star review because this Chili's is consistently open pretty late, when most restaurants in the area have closed.  That makes it a reliable stand-by, which I have always/will always appreciate.  Yum."
Darren H.,"Moorpark, CA",155,34,18,3.0,4/16/2014,"Service was slow! I had the Chicken Fajitas and Wings. The fajitas were ok, the wings were actually good. The server was nice but everyone else was just wondering around. It took forever to get a refill on my drink. We also found that ziosk pad on the table took up to much space. My overall review was based on the service and quality of food."
