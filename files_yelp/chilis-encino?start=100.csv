Maria P.,"Nienburg, Germany",1,3,,5.0,8/12/2016,"I love coming out to this Chilis!  The atmosphere is great.  They are always playing classic rock (Tom Petty, Van Morrison). Which always puts me in a super good mood!  The staff is always so friendly and welcoming! And the fajitas (steak) never disappoint.  There is plenty of parking and easy access!"
Suzy E.,"Gardena, CA",0,28,,1.0,11/20/2016,"I've been to this location a few times a couple of years ago. I've never had a good experience here.  Takes way too long to get food. The last time I went, I said never again. Today I met my friend for a late lunch here. Her idea to go to Chili's, and I said OK let's me try it again. This was worse than my previous experiences.  We ordered and then sat there for quite awhile when the waiter came by and said it's coming  up soon.  Then we waited and waited. Finally a woman who may have been one of the managers came by and said there was a mixup. They gave our food to someone else. What was really bad is that it took them at least 30 minutes to realize they screwed up. So then we had to wait for them at that point to make the food again. In all we waited at least 1 hour for our food.  I hate incompetence!  Should be zero stars."
Jin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",279,1042,1684,2.0,6/14/2014,"Hm. I had their santa fe chicken salad and wasn't impressed at all. The dressing was watered down, and the salad itself had no flavor. They're trying to seem ""gourmet"" with their plates and presentation, but definitely not making the cut.  Perhaps I'll try out their HH deal and it might be different."
Daniel C.,"Tarzana, CA",198,366,45,5.0,9/20/2014,"I want my baby back baby back ribs, chili's baby back ribs! Nope not for ribs but the queso is good. I had the smokehouse burger and my brother had an avocado chicken sandwich. We went here tonight without small Ang as we can from LAX after a large influx of clients came in.  Back to this culinary masterpiece. They're open till midnight or what not on Fridays so definitely a good place for munchies. The service is always good as the folks are friendly and tonight was no exception. Ample parking with plenty of handicap spaces for those who limp.  Came home and now it has been two hours or so since I ate. I have not had to use the restaurant for a numerow dos, so I know this place is for real and the chef knows what he's doing.  Keep up the good work!"
Tj J.,"Valley Village, CA",98,280,539,2.0,4/13/2015,"Scored based on the attitude of the server!  Could careless if I ever go back in.  Name on the guest check reads Jenna"" have to go on that for clearly introducing yourself is a dying art of the service industry.  Met up with a friend for late lunch who was leaving town this eve.  Thanks to our nameless server our intended nice lunch turned very uncomfortable fast.  This person was behind the bar and yells out as I'm sitting myself, what did you want to drink?  It was later - much later when food arrived that this server comes over - pours a refill and before I could empty  my mouth of food while my  friend was talking ..... She abruptly - loudly states. Your welcome!  We both looked at each other sort of shocked.  As she abruptly walks away I say..  Excuse me, are you trying to be rude?  She laughs and says oh no.. By this time she's behind the bar making comments to 2 other younger guys at the bar about the interaction.  Just a nasty loud unprofessional young lady.  I'm thinking the others at the bar was employees as well.  Thanks Jenna, for great interaction.  Your rude!"
Jaime V.,"Burbank, CA",6,11,5,2.0,6/7/2015,"This was the worst Chili's I have ever been to... Felt very claustrophobic, the waiter was never around... We had to get our own to go box and paid via ziosk cause we were waiting for the UN-personable waiter... Will definitely never come back to this location... Will drive an extra 5 miles to the next location..."
Robert D.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,6,1,2.0,12/30/2016,"I've been coming to this Chili's for years. Even looked past the service in some cases. One time they completely forgot my meal. But the manager owned up to the mistake and dealt with it accordingly. This last visit was the worst and was the straw on the camels back. Our food took about 40 minutes to get to us. My wife and I ordered 2 steaks. She likes her steak well done and I like mines medium. My steak was rare, So I sent it back. My wife got a medium steak but just settled with it. Once it was returned it was still rare. Like they didn't really cook it again. They asked if I wanted another steak...I said yes but make it to go...so they took my plate (with my side still on the plate). They came back with a steak to go and didn't give me my side. They offered a separate side for me waiting for service for an hour and 15 minutes but since they took my other side they really did nothing to own there scrappy service. And when I got home, steak was rare again."
Zak R.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",31,33,8,5.0,11/26/2016,"I worked at a Chili's years ago while in college and I'm always raving about it to my gf who has never been. I finally took her to Chili's in Encino since it's the closest one to us (GET IT TOGETHER, BURBANK!). The host gave us a very warm greeting and instantly I knew it was going to be a good experience. Erika, our server greeted us quickly, got our drinks and queso to the table promptly and was just all around wonderful. I got the half rack of baby back ribs and my gf got the Bacon Burger. She told us those were two of the options the $22 deal and said she would put it in as such with the queso, which was very nice of her. The food was just as good as I remembered and I had a pure happy nostalgic moment that my gf thought was pretty funny. It's sad that there is not a Chili's close to us, but since there aren't any in NYC where we are from, we will take what we can get. Thanks for providing my gf with a wonderful first time Chili's experience. We will be back again soon!"
Anita K.,"Glendale, CA",36,20,251,5.0,7/22/2015,Love Chilis and love this location. Had not been for a long time and they have cool devices on each table which has a menu and games for the kids to play and also at the end of your meal you can get excess you bill and pay for it. Recommend Chilis and especially this location.
Rachel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2463,216,210,2.0,2/6/2015,"Okay the were do I start?? Let me just list it off how as it went. * Waitress make a sarcastic comment about not being energetic enough? I didn't realize I was there to entertain her--but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say she was trying to be up beat. * The our meal come our before out appetizers and drinks. --Awkward. * Then I tried the onion ring appetizers--They were dry, burnt and just tasted awful.  * After 2 bits of the onion rings I moved on to my main course a chicken salad. That was soaked in vinegar or some odd dressing. It was the worst meal I think I've had dropped in-front of me.  * The food was so bad we had to start all over again from the menu. To top it off on on really acknowledged why the food was so bad and why things were coming out in the wrong order.   *We had multiple people going to our table, very unprofessional, seems like they hire a bunch of teens right out of high school to run the business.  Not coming back here again--not worth the food, parking struggle or lack of customer service experienced employees."
Ali T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",296,192,86,4.0,1/26/2015,this chili's is located in the heart of encino with-in the encino commons its one of the better chili's locations i have been too they use to be a bit inconsistent but they seem to have fixed that so its much better now they have a lot of signature drinks that are super good i usually go here once every 2 weeks at minimum so see you there
Massi M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",23,38,8,4.0,3/27/2015,"The movie ""Hallpass"" motivated me a few years back to check out Chili's, because they had a hilarious scene about Chilli's in there.  The only Chili's I've gone to were in South OC up until I visited this Chilli's here in Encino.  It feels slightly different in here than what I'm used to, probably cause this is LA, but not different in a good or bad way.  The servers have been all very friendly and efficient even on busy nights. I would never rate 5 Stars just because most of the food is not healthy, but 4 Stars are well deserved for good service, lots of screens, group convenience, and Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers! 4 Stars"
Rek G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,12,3,5.0,3/14/2016,"went here this afternoon with my parents (free meal woot)... service was great.  we had two waitresses looking after us (Kara and Sara or something, they had similar sounding names)-- they were attentive and accommodating.  loved the southwest egg rolls, and the portions were good.  lots of plasma screens with different sports going on, even tho i'm not a big spectator.   only drawback was the tablet payment system they have at each table now.  it forces the servers to have to sit there and explain how to go thru all the steps and clicking things (tough stuff for my old folks to figure out lol)."
Steve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,1,,1.0,1/17/2016,"I came into the bar to have a beer.  The bartender - a young woman in her 20's - did something I have never encountered before.  After placing my order and delivering my beer, I politely asked if she could turn on the Broncos-Steelers game.  She proceeded to roll her eyes and tell me to be patient.  She then added with a glare and told me ""Patience is a virtue"".    My anger has still not subsided.  I give Chili's Encino one star because the rest of the wait staff was very friendly.  But this woman bartender was unbelievably rude."
Christian And Chanel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,52,42,1.0,1/10/2016,"Usually receive amazing service here. But today was absolutely positively horrible.  Came in to celebrate Christian's birthday. He ordered a steak medium rare and I ordered the baby back ribs.  Waited 30 min for our food (which we didn't mind because that's usually the wait time here). When we finally got our food, my ribs were cold and Christian's steak was beyond well done. We told the waitress and she gladly had it taken care of by bringing us another one (thank you!). But then as we began to eat, I found a fricken hair in the sauce for my ribs. I almost puked.  We told the manager and he apologized and offered to comp us any dessert we wanted.  Then they proceeded to tell us that they were completely out of the only two desserts we wanted. They were the two desserts they were promoting! So how the heck can they be out of them?!? First you didn't get our steak order right.  Then I found A FRICKEN HAIR IN MY FOOD.  And on top of all that, you don't have the very items you're promoting Dear Chilis, 3 strikes and you're out. Never coming here again."
Kimberly L.,"Redlands, CA",1,5,,1.0,2/9/2015,"Waitress was as fake nice as one can be. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy is all she can say. Hands over check and we still got ""enjoy""! Really? I didn't really ""enjoy"" paying $60 for crappy service and OK food. The chili tasted like cardboard, I waited 10 mins for a silverware set that she never brought me (we had to ask another waiter), waitress gossiped with another while holding my husbands water for 20 mins. Never coming back! Oh! And how do Buffalo wings sound like guacamole. Still  paid for her mistake.. But ""enjoy""!"
Noah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,12,10,3.0,8/9/2016,"The customer service was excellent and I really really enjoyed my meal. I was greeted and sat in a timely fashion and our food arrived pretty fast, but at one point in the night I went to the bathroom and it smelled super weird and that is where this Chili's lost it's potential fourth star. Obviously it's natural for a bathroom to smell weird at times and while that's out of the control of Chili's and most restaurants, it just really bothered me and stressed me out. If I managed this Chili's I would take the initiative to keep an active air freshener in the rest rooms as that would be a nice touch and a strong advantage over your average 3-4 star restaurant that disregards these tiny but important details that can make or break a very comfortable dining experience. I give this Chili's 3 stars but only cause I went to the bathroom, if I didn't go to the bathroom they would have received 4 stars."
Karen B.,"Encino, CA",22,128,191,1.0,1/30/2016,"The food is horrible. Service is non existent.  Park in the shopping center. If there's no where else to go, come here. BUT, stay on the bar side of the room. You might actually get table service."
Aditi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,1,,1.0,12/19/2015,"Horrible service. Front desk girl gave the table to another woman who came right after us. They were not busy at all. Then we waited 10 mins to get the table and 40 to get our appetiser and drinks and thats all we had ordered and yet it never came. This is second time in a row we are getting a bad service. Jesus, the manager, really needs to get his staff more training.  We just left the restaurant without eating anything. Will never NEVER return to this place and I am putting a bad word out there on all my social media profiles too. Yuk!! DON'T GO To this horrible place."
Jim V.,"El Segundo, CA",2,9,6,4.0,1/27/2015,Wow. To think chilies has only 3 stars. I used to come here quite a bit. Stopped in here to dine with an old friend. This place was empty. Where have all their patrons gone? The food is pretty good. They have a full bar and yes to watch all the games. It's a great spot to relax and eat. Not sure why such the low rating. I have it a four because the service was a little slow considering the place was empty. They also have a new updated menu that's worth a go. Here's a photo of the TV views from our table.
