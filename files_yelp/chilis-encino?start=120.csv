J T.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,24,8,1.0,12/15/2015,Nothing is worse than ordering take out for two burgers well done and getting home to find them still BLEEDING!!!!!!!...and the fries over done?! So disappointing!
Renato S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/8/2015,"We arrived at 750 on a Sunday night sat there for 40 minutes and never got our food. Terrible service, manager was never to be seen in the restaurant. Will never go back to that restaurant EVER again. All we ordered was some tacos and enchiladas, and 40 minutes later no food?!. Joke.. As we were about to get  in our car the waitress opens the back door and yells ""your food is ready"". No thank you.after waiting for more than 40 minutes for our food I was not going back in. Again, if you go there, make sure you have lots of time to waste. If I could give them negative starts I would!, it took me only 4 years to write my first yelp review. #-"
Lakashia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,69,64,3.0,1/6/2016,"Second time at this location. I was super excited about eating their Texas cheese fries. My date and I ordered the 2 for $20 meal which included one appetizer and two main courses. When the server bought out our half order of Texas cheese fries I noticed that the fries were old and cold and our plates were dirty. For the main course meal he ordered a bacon burger (pros-the burger was juicy, con-the fries were old) and I order the honey chipotle chicken strips with fries and corn on the cob (pro- the corn was yummy, cons-my fries were old, FYI the strips were dry). Lastly, our waitress did do a great job providing customer service."
Mohamadreza H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,4.0,8/27/2015,"For dinner we had the chicken with seasoning and fries and onion rings it was a nice date spot! had the chocolate cheesecake  Was great, the waiter was cool and hip The restauarant was clean and there was ample parking  Go and try!"
Donna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",576,580,1164,3.0,3/4/2014,"I had some time to kill before my movie started, so I decided to run into Chilis. I got one of their fruity margaritas, this one had blueberries in it. I was actually very good, especially with the fresh fruit. Then I got the Southwestern Egg Rolls appetizer. I asked the waitress could she make them extra mild. And she said they have no control over that, they are pre-made when they are delivered to the restaurant.  That made me lose my appetite somewhat. The thought that the food isn't made fresh to order - but that is the reason I don't usually eat a big restaurant chains. The appetizers were okay. My margarita was delicious. And I made it to my movie in time."
Shelden W.,"Encino, CA",10,41,12,4.0,2/27/2016,Come here with my daughter all the time. For some reason she thinks this is a Mexican place lol. I guess since she loves the quesadillas from here that's why. As for me the skillet queso and the smoke house wings are the best with my drinks.
Kenia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,3,2.0,12/27/2015,I came here tonight for dinner and we were very disappointed at our time here. Our food took about an hour to get to us and when we got it it was COLD! Smh
Raymond L.,"Northridge, CA",348,447,760,5.0,8/8/2013,"Overthetop customer service!  Woot woot!  We came by here after we couldn't get into Leno.   I saved the receipt so I could mention the server, but lost it :[  She was working in the bar around happy hour on Monday.  She was really nice and attentive.  Made sure everything was great.    The host at the front was nice too. Food was so good.  We got the 2 for $20.  1 appetizer, 2 meals.  I got the chicken salad.  So much lettuce!  Also got a $5 margarita; the best I've had in my life so far. They had plenty of flat screen TVs with a lot of sports on.  The bar was pretty clean, our table was dirty at first but our server quickly cleaned it off. I know it's a Chilli's bar, but I don't care.  It was awesome!"
Christine B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",101,139,40,5.0,1/13/2014,"This place is better than Fridays, but up there with Applebee's. Love the variety they offer. I absolutely love their chips and salsa and it's free during happy hour! Drinks are delicious. Great atmosphere. Haven't had a bad experience at chilis and I hope I never do! If I'm just snacking I like to get the chicken nachos. I've tried them with steak but it's not as good. The Cesar salad is pretty good. Tried the big mouth bites yesterday and they were great since I wasn't too hungry. It came with fries and shoestring onions. I've had that chicken dish with melted cheese and avocado I forgot what it's called but it's pretty new and it's amazing."
Thom P.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,361,18,4.0,12/16/2014,"L.A. is a shitty town. With shitty people. You can almost see someone crack a veneer when they have to be nice to you. But this Chili's felt different. It felt like the Midwest. And as it's in a shopping center full of d-bags, I was shocked, SHOCKED at the kindness within these walls. I usually go with my friend, since I don't like chains, but the last two times we came here, we were treated with kindness. Maybe it's phony, but...desperate for civility, I'll take it. For example, I only ordered a plate of endless nachos with a bowl of chili (I figured, you go to Chilis gotta eat chili, right?). The server was very peppy and nice. No ""that all you want half-pint? Thanks for wasting my precious time."" No attitude. Just a smile, a serve, and a quick ""enjoy!"" That's straight up customer service. Also, I flagged down someone who we clearly were not their table, asking for more chips. ""No problem""...I thought I'd seen the last of that person. Nope, within a few minutes, a hot plate of chips came out. So fast, even our server didn't realize it. Again, service. I really dig this place. Well trained service (nice). Decent grub. A nice relaxing atmosphere. It's been at least a decade since I've seen little kids dressed up nice to go to a restaurant (says a lot about where I eat). And it was precious...yeah, precious! to see little adults dressed to eat. Notes to AFC North followers: It seems there is a Steeler contingent that haunts this place. If you are fans of the Ravens, Browns or Bengals, assume you will be annoyed on Sundays during the NFL season."
Girl T.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,42,1,2.0,7/11/2016,"Very disappointed!  My boyfriend and I decided to go for lunch.  We were seated at 3:45pm.  The first thing that bothered me: 1.  I decided to take advantage of the Bottomless Soup & Salad lunch special, which ends at 4:00.  After looking at our menus, and by the time our waitress got back to our table, it was almost 4 (shy a few minutes).  I asked if I was still going to be able to take advantage of the lunch time deal, and she said that it depends on what time the order goes through the system.  It was like right at 4 when she submitted the order, so of course I was not going to get the deal, even though it was because she disappeared for so long.  No big deal; it wasn't about the money as much as it was about her response and her disappearing for so long.  Then, when we got our food, it just wasn't up to par.  I ordered the chili and it was very salty and I had no desire to eat much of it.  My boyfriend wasn't that impressed with his meal, either, but we did have some fun playing the trivia games at our table.  Customer service was blah (even though the waitress was nice but not flexible) and the food was blah!   Oh well, probably won't be returning."
Nattalie G.,"Riverside, CA",88,1,,5.0,3/4/2016,"Natalie was the most amazing server I have ever had!! Best experience at a restaurant, definetly the place to eat at in Encino..  Best personality ever, a complete asset to the company!!!"
Anastasia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,76,31,1.0,1/10/2016,The food here is horrible. Mc Donald's has better food. The food here all tastes frozen and they just pour a bunch of sauce on top to cover it up. Nasty.
Polina W.,"Savannah, GA",73,901,826,4.0,11/11/2012,"In honor of Veteran's Day, they serve free meals to service men and women, from a special menu. I came here with my boyfriend, who is in the army, and my mom. He had a burger from the special menu. My mom and I went for the 2 for $20 deal. We picked the fried cheese appetizer along with the Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas and the Roasted Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend also checked in on Foursquare and was able to score free chips and salsa! To drink, he got a mango iced tea, which unfortunately he didn't enjoy too much.  We were seated quickly, we placed our order, and about 15 minutes later, our food arrived! We didn't even have time to complain that our food was missing. My mom and I also ordered an El Nino Margarita. We ordered that a bit later, and that took the most time getting to our table.  The fried cheese (mozzarella sticks, basically) were nice and cheesy! We split that amongst the three of us. By the end of our meal, that was all gone.  My mom loved her spicy chicken fajitas! They had tortillas, guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and salsa on the side. Perfect to even out the spice.  I loved loved loved loved the Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. It comes in a red pepper sauce which wasn't too spicy. That came with rice (yum yum) and broccoli (wasn't too good). I can't believe I contemplated against the red pepper chicken.  We finally got the El Nino Margarita. It was good. I normally wouldn't have picked it, but my mom wanted it. Somehow, my boyfriend had room for dessert. For Veterans, it was $5 (again, off of a special menu). He had the Oreo® Topped Molten Cake (A decadent, cream-filled cake, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, Oreo® cookie pieces and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. LIMITED TIME OFFER. GET IT WHILE IT LASTS!) -- Straight from their website! He LOVED it! We were all able to have a couple of bites of it, so yes, it is pretty big (perfect if you are looking to share on a date, or with your girlfriends and  are watching your weight).  All in all, we were out in about an hour!"
Omid F.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,12,4,3.0,2/27/2016,I have been to this location several times in the last two or three years. The service and drinks have always been good but that's about all I can say. The food has been average at best in the past. But I have decided to write a review today because after having dinner there I felt kind of sick to my stomach. It's a few hours later no and I have more than just an upset stomach if you know what I mean. I am still giving this place three stars for the atmosphere and drinks and the service.
Rachel E.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",115,10,4,2.0,9/7/2014,"Just came back from there, very disappointed... I ordered the salmon herb garlic. The fish was dry and the dish it self didn't look yummy at all! There was almost no rice and a dirty black beans bowl. Other then that, the waitress was nice, but after a huge glass of margarita me and my sister wanted some water it took her 20 min to bring out."
Matthew G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/28/2016,"Hands down an amazing experience! I have been going to bars long before I care to admit. The bartender Jordan really knows her stuff! It's one thing to be personable when you're slow, it's another thing to be excellent when you're busy. She attended to our parties needs and was warm and entertaining too. We were not an easy bunch. Jordan, you made the party special! Thank you."
Tanina O.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,71,25,5.0,8/4/2013,"I love this Chili's because they are super fast and the waiters/waitresses are very attentive.   The establishment is also very clean including the restrooms and floors.    The food is also efffin bomb,huge, and cheap !!!"
Mauricio S.,"Canyon Country, CA",56,37,7,2.0,12/5/2014,Food was OK.  Our whole table made a bet to see who could get our server to crack a smile.... *No winners.
Jessica Z.,"Tarzana, CA",138,136,298,4.0,8/27/2015,"Just your average chilis! The reason I love this place is that it's consistent. It's not amazing food but you can always count on it tasting the exact same haha. I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. It comes with two sides so I got corn and fries. The chicken is heavy on the sauce but you can scrape a little off, it's not biggie. I also got one of my favorite things. Their chips and salsa-ranch. Half salsa, half ranch. Suuuper delicious. My friend concocted it when he worked at chilis. Their ranch is delicious."
