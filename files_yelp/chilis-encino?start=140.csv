Viktoria B.,"Burbank, CA",2,13,,5.0,8/2/2016,Can I just say YUM. Just had the best ever Santa Fe salad here. Most definitely come back again! The salad was just perfect.
Peter D.,"Los Angeles, CA",272,43,3,2.0,9/20/2014,Came to chilis for lunch today.  The chips and salsa were really good.  We also ordered nachos (that were also good).  Our server was really nice and good.  I attempted to order chicken fried steak and they were out. That was disappointing.  I ordered Cajun chicken pasta and it was okay.  Had a side salad and I sent it back.  The lettuce was gross. The food was sub par...but what do you expect from Chilis.
Ernesto A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,1,5.0,11/8/2015,They recently updated their menu with the addition of new entrees. Food was good. Chips and salsa were bomb! Prime Rib Fajitas were good.
Karmen N.,"Downey, CA",41,51,5,1.0,11/4/2015,"I love going to chili's so i really hate to give them a bad review but the chills at this location sucks. From the food to the drinks and especially the customer service. I recently moved down here and will not be going to this chillis's anymore. I came her 2weeks ago and thought the same thing but i thought i'd give it one more try and it only reassured me why I wouldn't come anymore. The food quality and taste are horrible, drinks from the bar are very watered down, and the customer service is just lacking. I'd rather stop by at the chili's where i used to live whenever I'm around the area as it is far now. THIS CHILI'S GIVES OTHER CHILI'S A BAD REP!"
Erick R.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",22,16,3,1.0,8/25/2015,"Since I work down the street now. I've came here twice, yesterday and today. I can't believe how bad the service is during lunch like you guys need more staff or wtf. I waited 25 minutes for my drinks and I'm still waiting for my food......."
David R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,1.0,7/3/2016,"Avoid at all costs. Poor service. Snotty waitstaff and WHY are the tables alway sticky?!? Seriously, a very poorly run place."
Jason K.,"Van Nuys, CA",96,120,223,5.0,7/22/2012,"On my way to Chili's tonight, I was thinking, ""I should find some time to post my 3.5 star review"" from several years of collective monthly visits. But tonight's dinner changed everything. Sunday night, 6 PM, a booth for 2 kids and 2 adults. Tiffany was our server. And while most of the servers here have been very good, we've never had service nearly as good as we did tonight... at any restaurant. It's amazing how just one person can make such a difference. From the get-go we had everything we needed. Tiffany took our drink orders and before we had a chance to ask, we already had extra napkins (a necessity for a table with kids) waiting for us on the table. I didn't even see her set them down. Our chips and salsa arrived (with my special request for pico de gallo) and she brought side plates for each of us -- a dozen recent visits and we've never received plates with our appetizer. Drinks are refilled just before we empty them and plates are scooped up before they start crowding the table. Shockingly, we had constant service and attention as if we were her only table. Not once did we have to wait for something. She was on top of it all. Our service was in harmony with the food, which was fresh and well-prepared. Another pleasant surprise. It's a shame to be so blown away by such great service, but it really is rare, especially at a chain like Chili's. Tiffany could probably make twice as much at a 5-star restaurant, but I hope Chili's finds a way to keep her around. TIPS: * Call ahead on busy nights to put your name on the list. * There is open seating at the tables and booths in the bar area. * Parking is available in the mall parking lot, the underground garage and at meters on the street (free after 8 PM and all day on Sundays). * They occasionally have ""Kids Eat Free Days"" which you can find about by signing up for their emails (you may need their printable coupon). * The $20 Dinner for Two deal is worth checking out - go for the chicken fajitas! * Kids fountain drinks and lemonade get free refills (just like adult drinks), but milks are not refillable. * Check Facebook for other promotions and deals like free appetizers."
Sarah K.,"Burbank, CA",120,964,139,2.0,3/12/2012,"Alas, the broccoli raw and overcooked, and I truly do not recommend the sirloin. The meat was too chewy, even though I ordered it medium rare. Service was decent for a large party (there were about 14 of us), but the service lacked on drink refills. I DID appreciate that the service allowed us to break up into our own separate bills.  I did like the corn guacamole; chips are light and airy, perfect for dipping and not taking away from the guacamole. Also on the plus side, Chili's has Coke Zero, which I greatly prefer to Diet Coke. But two stars for you, Chili's, since my primary course was non edible. I prefer TGIFs to Chili's, if I have to go to a standard Americana chain restaurant."
eva e.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,55,11,3.0,4/28/2014,"Ok...This was a funny experience. I'm not complaining about the food or anything, but what was funny....it's my son's birthday and we asked for them to sing happy birthday and they did but once the bill came there was a .99 charge for table entertainment. Now you don't see that everyday. I am going to post the picture. Please look for it."
Douglas T.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,19,14,5.0,8/25/2015,"I was there last Sunday very good customer service ,Danny the waiter was awesome food came out fast no complains am most definably coming back at this location AAAAA+++++"
Rosemary T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/8/2016,"I recently visited this chilis location twice in the past week. I've been here before & never had a problem it's a convenient location for me. But this visit was just the bad. My husband & I decided to visit again because we really enjoyed it the last time. But the experience we had with server (bartender) Jordan was not the best. Her demeanor was just all wrong. When she acknowledge us she looked at us and every other customers there like we were a burden and she was busy texting on her phone instead of providing customer service. Finally, she served us, the drinks, and food were good.  We then ordered 2 more drinks the same thing but they were made different. PRESIDENTE Margarita was a tequila Rita (no lime). It was too strong and tasted horrible. It made me sick. My husband asked for a MOD Tessa & asked if the drinks are made the same she was very helpful and was willing to remake the drinks. The server Jordan was  just watching and snarling at us while my husband spoke with the Mgr. I felt very uncomfortable & I just asked for the bill paid it and left. I didn't want to be there anymore and honestly I will not be returning. They just lost a good customer."
Alvaro L.,"San Fernando, CA",32,5,,5.0,8/23/2015,Great bartenders and phenomenal service!!!! Great place to grab a drink and watch sports!
George R.,"Sylmar, CA",23,91,8,1.0,3/31/2015,"I haven't been to a Chili's in about a year or so until to tonight. Man, did my wife and I regret it. Since when did Chili's convert to a Tex Mex restaurant?? The service was subpar and the food was MEH. Our waitress was nice but not very attentive. When we placed our orders she asked what dressing she wanted on her salad. My wife asked for Italian. She then told us they don't carry Italian dressing. Huh?? Then I placed my order and asked if I could get a side Caesar salad. She said they no longer have Caesar salad on the menu. WHAAA?! What kind of place doesn't have Caesar salad???  We ordered chips with guacamole to start. It took FOREVER to come out. When it finally did, she didn't bring the guacamole. She said it was coming. Yet, a table next to us who came in AFTER also ordered chips and guacamole and they got it no problem BEFORE us.  Now they have these little kiosks at their tables. We were looking through it. It has food info, news apps etc. It also has game apps to play while you wait. We didn't see any games we cared for so left it alone. I wanted ranch for my fries and I had to ask her twice for it. We got the bill and we saw we were charged for a game app on that kiosk! We didn't even realize we activated a game. It was all to easy to start a game up apparently. They removed it from our bill when we asked but they really should have a warning prompt like ""Are you sure you want to make this purchase?"" Or any kind of warning.  We were both thoroughly disappointed with our experience and won't be returning to Chili's anymore. We should've just gone to Tommy's the way we had originally intended."
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,3.0,3/13/2012,"It is a Chili's. I went in with low expectations and left with a full tummy and over all good experience.  We had a big party, around 14 people. Someone called ahead which helped with the wait time. This place was packed for a Sunday, apparently this is the place to be in Encino.  The service was pretty good. I always cringe when a big party gets together, it is usually never a good thing. Drinks were flying out, tons of water and coke zero piling up all around me. My friends seemed very happy with the booze specials and all of the deals on the menu, Two for $20, Two for $35 and so on.  I started off with the buffalo wings and thought they were good. Super fresh and crispy served with tasty blue cheese dressing. For my main course I had the salmon and doubled up on broccoli. Salmon was well seasoned and well done...but completely what I expected from this type of restaurant. The broccoli was all over the place, some cooked and some raw, I don't know how they managed that.  Server split the bills for every couple which was very appreciated and unexpected. Overall a decent dining experience. Coke zero!!"
Sandra H.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,55,4,2.0,12/3/2014,Food was ok but I had to lower my review due to my bad experience with the manager (Alfonso ?? Or something). Ugh. The old staff and manager seem to have changed.
Orin P.,"North Hollywood, CA",6,43,31,5.0,3/28/2014,Once again great meal for din din. I had there 2 4 20 menu. Which was their grilled and spicy taplia with rice and beans. Top with avocado and tomatos and mango lil small pieces. Very nice touch and gave it flavor and took some of the spiciness away.  My babe had her steak cook medium rare. Oh the steak was nice and tender and the juices of the meat was moist. Just made the steak taste even mo better.  We should gotten some margaritas but I am driving.
Bicho P.,"Anaheim, CA",5,49,9,4.0,6/27/2014,Father's Day celebration with my wife and daughter; a time to gather and enjoy moments together. We had the best of service and food. The server was attentive and promptly checked to see if we needed anything. I would recommended.
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",220,163,82,3.0,7/15/2014,"When it's good, it's really fun; when the food is cold, soggy, undercooked or burnt, I wonder if it's worth the risk. The Boulevard has so many great restaurants, that there really is no excuse for bad food. If your doors are open, the kitchen should be good or better. My college memories outperform my recent two years of actual experiences at Chili's.  The staff is very nice, but the consistency of my food is a crap shoot. Perhaps I need to only order the new menu items in order to maximize my odds of consistency. Perhaps the kitchen staff gets too lax with the items they think they can cook.  Today I had overcooked soggy tilapia with wilting dehydrated steamed broccoli. AND I'm not a picky eater. REALLY! I wish I knew how to fix the problem. We all enjoy the staff and atmosphere, but I'm kicking myself for choosing to go there today after the two most recent experiences with the cooking quality. I ordered  'medium' steaks and received overcooked AND undercooked interpretations. I realize that thickness matters, but I'm assuming that appropriate temperature and time compensations are a part of the culinary school curriculum.  So I suppose it's worth a shot to suggest checking the temperature accuracy of the ovens and stoves as well as the timers' in the kitchen . Also the dining are remodeling  does not hold a candle to using the tools properly. Also a note that today was not a terribly busy evening."
Alex G.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/14/2015,Megan is a bitch a sat at d bar for one hour and she totally ignored me the worst costumer service ever never coming back unless she gets fired
P W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/10/2016,"i have to concur with most of these 1 star posts.  i went in for a thursday night football game to enjoy a meal and watch football (11/10/16).  Jordan was the bartender.  She never looks you in the eye when talking to you, so she asked me ( i think), if i wanted something to drink.  After looking around to see if maybe she was talking to someone else, she then looked at me, stone faced.  I said, yes actually, what do you have on tap?  So she replied, (obviously one of those bartenders who thinks they shouldn't have to go through the list of beers) ""well, everything you see there!!""  Oh, you're one of those bartenders, i thought to myself.  I said to her, i wish i could see the names on the taps, but unfortunately, i can't read those labels from the other end of the bar, i'm near sighted.  So she painfully and annoyingly, while not making eye contact,  went through the 12 or so names with less enthusiasm than the guy calling out the name, ""Bueller...  bueller...?""    Sorry to put you out Jordan...  i ordered a beer, she brought it to me.  I ordered food, a runner brought it to me.  From the time i ordered my beer and food, to the time i finished, and was ready to leave ( i would say about an hour ), she never said a word to me.  She would ask people who were about 15 feet away from her what they wanted, while she was typing into her computer, as though customers were supposed to shout their orders across the room to her, while she made no eye contact.  She was cold, had zero personality, couldn't be bothered with friendly, personal customer service.  the bar and restaurant both, were not busy.  As i was leaving, the host at the front door couldn't even be bothered with saying thanks for coming or have a great night, as i walked right by him out the door.  Whoever the manager is of this restaurant, you have failed, along with Jordan and the pathetic host.  Oh, and please don't bother with the lame, ""sorry you had a bad experience...blah blah"", do the right thing Chili's,  and start managing the place more appropriately, be productive, stop permitting sub-par service.  That's what we really want when we feel compelled to write a review on Yelp."
