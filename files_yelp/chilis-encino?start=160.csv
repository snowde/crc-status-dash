Ellen W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,18,1,5.0,7/17/2014,"Everything is awesome in this place. they have the best waiters and waitress(super nice and patient). best customer service and super delicious food.  explosion salad, half rack and steak is my favorite in this place . 5 stars to Chili's Grill & Bar in Encino town center."
Brian S.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",73,11,,1.0,6/10/2013,"I'm usually not compelled to write a bad review about a place, but when I have the intention to bring my girlfriend to a place for a birthday dinner, as a last minute attempt to turn her bad day around, and the place makes it worst? I have to say something. It was about a week ago. I hurry up inside to let the host know it's my girlfriend's birthday and she notifies me that she will let the server know. Cool. I grab a booth immediately and the server, Randall, tells me that he knows about the birthday girl coming. We take a look at the menu and decide to order some sweet potato fries, oh you don't have anymore? Okay, well we were looking at the drinks, how about a margarita with that coronita on top. Oh you don't have anymore coronitas? Alright then, we'll just get the margaritas without the coronitas, but can you put them in those big martini glasses? Oh the bartender already poured them into mugs and you can't pour them into the glasses we asked for AND you ran out of salt? Okay server.  See, I work at a restaurant. I understand when you run out of things, it happens. But when a small request is made, after not having many of the things we asked for, and then you blame the bartender for not putting it in the right glasses because she ""already poured it?""  And on top of that they were the wrong flavors we asked for.  Food came. It was alright, nothing special. Spoke to the manager about what happened, he brings the right margarita WITH salt. Now I'm thinking, if the dessert comes with the birthday candle maybe it'll make up for everything that has happened. Oh, that's the check? Oh you forgot about the MAIN reason why we came here in the first place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday?  I figured, I'd ask him if it was busy. Maybe he was busy tonight and that's why so many things went wrong. He replies ""No, not really."" I don't even know how to summarize our visit here. In short, save your tip money for servers who will make you ENJOY your birthday dinner."
Ana M.,"Inglewood, CA",17,47,11,4.0,3/6/2014,"Our servers name was Amy according to the receipt. We originally ordered meals to go but ended up staying to eat there!  My boyfriend was the one who did the ordering, I got there just in time when it's ready. He had already paid for everything and once I got there we started to eat, the waitress offered to get me a drink. So I ordered a Dr Pepper and when I asked her to ring me up she said it was on the house! Ive worked in food services before, and I know that it drink doesn't really cost much to the company. So it's not like they lost much, but I sure did appreciate the fact that she wasn't making a big fuss over one drink!  That simple token gained this restaurant returning customer!! Actually make that two returning customers!!  Thanks again Amy! Made my lunch break quite pleasant!"
Lorenzo B.,"Culver City, CA",10,54,243,5.0,6/5/2015,I want m y baby back ribbs! cmon its Chillis~ its a fun place for dinner.
burhan a.,"TOLUCA TER, CA",31,16,11,5.0,4/20/2015,"Food is great, drink are strong and the staff are very friendly.  Been going to this location past year never been  disappointed"
Steph Z.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",3,11,9,1.0,10/31/2014,"This place is terrible. I came here with my girls on halloween for lunch today at 1pm. This place was a ghost town (literally). There were at least 4 people here (including me, and my girl pal) by far not busy at all. As soon as we walked in no greeting at all by the host, we were seated. We ordered appetizers and drinks. The waiter came by and took our order. After a long wait of 45 minutes the waiter came back she was frantically saying ""omg I forgot to place your order!!!"" I'll put a rush on it omg! So we waited, waited,and waited. Then finally we decided to leave OUR FOOD NEVER CAME! When this place was empty(ghost town) I was so upset, and angry they didn't even apologize. Don't waist your time here or money!!! Cheap place,and terrible customer service!!!!"
MANNY R.,"Mission Hills, CA",14,15,3,1.0,5/20/2013,"Service horrible. We came here on saturday 5/18/13. The bar area has to step it up! The waitress forgot our appetizer and was not very helpful. My ribs sucked so bad, no taste and it seems like the just threw sauce over the meat and warmed it up in the microwave. The fries were hard and it appeared they were double fried. My girlfriends original chicken crisper a were soggy and the chicken tasted as if was still raw. After we finished our margarita, we got out of there and ran for the HILLS. I definitely will not be coming back to chillies ever again, at least to this location. I will say that I've gotten great service from the Northridge location and the bar area is amazing.  This place gets negative stars from my end but I guess Yelp is not set up that way. :( 1 star it is!"
Dillon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,8,3,4.0,3/13/2015,"Its your standard chili's but tonight our service from Shontay was the best. She was fun, inviting, and everything a server should be. Ask for her if you go. You won't be disappointed!"
T H.,"Davidson, NC",0,74,3,4.0,10/21/2013,"Hostess was somehow friendly but disengaged at the same time, but awkward hostessing is easily overshadowed by good food and great service! Clean establishment, pretty landscaping and flowers outside, easy parking in the garage.   We went here yesterday for late lunch/early dinner, were sat immediately.  Father in-law loved the big screen TVs. The server was totally on-point, super sweet, fun, and never let our drinks go dry. She also did a great job trying to upsell me on my tasty adult beverage (although I had to refuse because my in-laws were buying and I didn't want to take advantage)  She made sure we kept smiles on our faces and I wish I remembered her name because she deserves some recognition.  If she reads this, she will know who she is :) Thanks, Chili's!"
Greg S.,"Glendale, CA",0,39,,4.0,5/2/2014,"Ice cold beer, and decent food, can't really ask for more. They use great frosted mugs that hold the beers temperate, and the food isn't bad either. Usually go with the cheddar fries and the boneless wings, a happy feel good place to have an enjoyable evening."
Scott L.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",21,35,5,1.0,10/12/2014,"You know when you can't decide where to eat and your friends all make different suggestions and you wind up going somewhere where everyone can find something? Well that's what happened to me tonight. After a short wait, we were seated, a few minutes later we were greeted by our server, who smelled like he just got off his smoke break, nothing puts me in the mood to eat like the stink of cigarettes.  We ordered drinks, I just got a soda, which was served in a scratched up plastic mug that smelled and tasted like soap.  I ordered the boneless buffalo wings, they arrived overcooked and dry.  I asked for additional wing sauce, While I was waiting, to pass the time, I was looking at these touch screens they have on all the tables.  They're like little iPads, with the menu where you can order food and drinks and play games.  Unbeknownst to me, these are paid ""apps"" I clicked out of it after realizing it.  Several minutes later, my sauce arrived, which may not seem long, but it was long enough for me to have cold, over cooked chicken nuggets.  I asked for the bill, they don't give checks anymore, the tab is on the touch screen and they want you to swipe your credit card on these devices to pay.  Well with all these security breeches recently. there was no way I was going to enter my credit card or ATM over their wireless network.  Preferring to pay cash I noticed an ""entertainment charge"" on the bill of 99 cents.  I told the server I simply clicked on the device but hadn't played any games, he was able to remove the charge.  It seems to me, they're trying reduce labor and service by having the customer order and pay through these devices, i'm not sure I like that idea but at least it didn't reek of smoke."
Eliyahou G.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/19/2016,"If I could give it 0 stars I would! I've been to chilis many times before and none of them have been perfect but this time was just horrid! I ordered the margarita mex bowl which I've had before and remembered it to be quite satisfying however today that was not the case. Upon getting the meal, I had to leave for a few minutes to pick my son up so my wife stayed with the food. When I got back the food was a bit cold which is expected since it took me a little while but that is no reason for the chicken to be completely uncooked!!! Upon telling the server that the chicken was completely raw!!! (it felt like chewing rubber) , she apologized and took the meal back to the kitchen and claimed she'd bring back a new one which was completely fine with me. Then she came back with the meal... Not a new one!! Just a warmed up one! She literally just took my meal and warmed it up! That didn't make up for the fact that the chicken was clearly still raw! Then came the manager after complaining again and I kindly explained to him the situation, all I got from him was an ""I'm sorry, I'm here if you need anything else"" anything else?! After a terrible meal, and terrible service, and the carelessness of this manager, I will not be returning to chilis(at least not this location). And I don't recommend you do either."
Monica R.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/22/2015,Great service!!!! Bartenders are always nice and ready to help. The staff was wonderful as well I will definitely return
Mitchell O.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,5,1,2.0,4/12/2014,"Thanks, manager Alfonso, for a great Saturday night. Next time I just won't order anything. Maybe I'll be better off. For future reference though, when a guest informs you that he ordered the original ribs, and not the dry rubbed ones you just dropped in front of him, don't just walk back into the kitchen and slop on some BBQ. Lazy move, dude. Thankfully your waitress went to bat for me, or you probably would've made me pay for the mistake myself. Don't worry. I'll be sprinting back for your exemplary customer service ASAP. Trust me............... Queso was legit though. Too bad you can't take credit for that."
Luis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,18,121,3.0,4/11/2014,I've been here many times on crowded nights and not so crowded. It's definitely a nice spot to just hang out get a quick bite and order drinks. Their two for 20 menu is an easy choice if your on a budget but don't wanna seem like a cheap date. If u just want a drink or two or... Definitely hit the bar not so crowded but stay away from Jenna. I don't if she's rude or she's just a tough cookie. Anywho good luck ya all. Cheers mates
Rachael R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,3/18/2016,"Came here for the first time in 6 years, ( do to an absolutely nasty tasting burger that had gone bad), and was surprised to see that their appetizers and salads are horrible. Have never had a good experience here. How is this place still open?"
Blair P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,4,1.0,5/19/2015,"I ordered the boneless buffalo appetizer. The chicken was inedible - raw with dark spots. It was chewy and so undercooked. This is a huge concern and not acceptable. I will be writing a bad Yelp review as well. Your staff is friendly, but whoever is in the kitchen needs a lot of education regarding cooking. I could not eat 98% of my meal. I will never dine from a Chili's again."
Adi A.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,27,12,5.0,3/3/2015,My favorite place for a hamburger and fries and don't forget the amazing cookie desert they have omg the best !!! Just go
Jon D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,71,109,4.0,12/8/2013,"I didn't have a bad experience at this Chili's, in fact the food was actually quite good. The service on the other hand, was not wonderful. When we sat down the waitress greeted us politely and handed us our menus.     Then the service started to fall apart a little. We were given wrong drink sizes and it took forever to get certain dipping sauces for the chips. It also took a little long to get our food.   The food(when it finally came) was delicious. I ordered a black bean burger. I enjoyed it a lot. The burger came with fries. The fries were nothing that special.   I don't think that you should avoid this Chili's. I actually recommend it. Just as long as you have a good waiter or waitress."
Darcy W.,"North Hollywood, CA",7,15,,1.0,2/20/2015,"This place should be closed down by the health dept.until the employees learn how to properly clean a restroom. Went to this Chili's on Feb 15, 2015 after deciding to give it a second chance. I went to the restroom, used the exact same stall as last time and it was still filthy and disgusting. There was a whole pile of bunched up toilet paper and bloody maxi pads, plus the stall door was dirty and disgusting, I did not want to touch anything..If I had not already ordered my food and been so hungry I would have thrown up. I get how employees hate cleaning the restroom, but management should hire a janitor or something. Totally disgusting will not go back. I got a Chili's gift card for Christmas, I am taking it to the cash for gift cards machine and get $$$ to spend at a clean restaurant where you can use the restroom without wanting to puke."
