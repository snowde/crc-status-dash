K P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,2,1.0,2/26/2011,"Went to a Chili's Restaurant today and this is what they served -- a grilled chicken sandwich that was overcooked and actually burnt. Click above on the ACTUAL PHOTOS for you to see with your own eyes.  If that wasn't shocking enough, a manager actually served this to our table. She came by apologizing that the food was taking long, and 45 minutes later this was the chicken sandwich she brought out. Why didn't a manager check the food before serving?  This establishment is a total embarassment, and what they served  was unhealthy. Now you have pictures to see it for yourself. Would YOU want to eat there?"
Lee F.,"Encino, CA",222,437,1558,1.0,12/1/2012,"Have not been to Chili's in a very long time.  Got seated by the hostess and waited for the server.  After more than ten minutes no one showed up.  How disappointing because the restaurant was not that busy.  I got up and left.  Management: You got to improve your customer service skills.  I can't blame all Chili Restaurants for poor treatment, I am only referring to the location in Encino, CA."
Carlos H.,"Glendale, CA",28,30,15,4.0,8/27/2013,"Great food, great atmosphere. First time at this Chilies. The service here was outstanding.  My gf and I shared the Margarita pizza apetizer and it was really good.  We came here for the 2 for $20 deal. The food was good and they served a lot of it. I had the Cajun pasta, I highly recommend it."
Darleen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,29,,5.0,2/2/2015,"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but Chili's is fabulous!! The service is top-notch, the food is good (always consistent), and the drinks are reasonably priced. I love watching sports games here, always a lively bunch in the bar:) I can't wait till SuperBowl Sunday, this Chili's is my chosen destination. Best local p"
Paul M.,"Burbank, CA",78,14,,4.0,4/4/2014,"My family and I took an outing to Chili's last weekend and I must say it was great.  The place was very clean, the service was great, and the food was excellent!  I especially appreciated the selections of foods they had - we can be very picky eaters!   The chicken sandwich I had was amazing!  Loved the bread and seasoning of the chicken itself.  The others had burgers that looked mouthwatering and was told were great.  My chicken sandwich hit the spot, I was not stuffed but wasn't left hungry either. We didn't have to wait for a table and once we ordered, it didn't too long to get our food.  Our server was very polite and attentive to all our needs.  We all had a great experience and plan to return very soon!"
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,379,201,4.0,9/26/2014,"My wife, my granddaughter, and I came here for dinner. We were seated almost immediately. Our server came to the table very shortly after we sat down. My granddaughter ordered off of the children's menu, a quesadilla with french fries. My wife and I decided to share that the fajitas. We ordered it with chicken and shrimp. There the  fajitas come with a carmelized onions and grilled vegetables mixed in. We ordered extra rice and beans for $1 more ( highly recommended if you like the rice and beans). In addition to the vegetables, there was a small tray with add ins including salsa and sour cream and cheese. In combination, they were absolutely delicious. And there was so much food that even with two of us had trouble finishing it. My only criticism would be the order we had for my granddaughter. The quesadilla was a little bit overdone on the edges making it hard for a kid to eat. Overall, an excellent meal with excellent service. I definitely will be coming back."
Janet P.,"Bell, CA",10,41,10,5.0,11/14/2013,"I love this place I'd go here everyday for lunch if I was rich. I love having their shockTop beer, The Marguerita flatbread, not sure If I spelled that right and their  trio appetizer. DILICIOSO!"
Dominic B.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,7,11,1.0,12/1/2014,"Definitely not impressed! Don't get me wrong, I know it's a chain, but c'mon! Bar tender ended up being our sever.. Slow service isn't the end of the world, but when it's slow because you go out & take smoke breaks right before you bring my food.. That's pretty gross! Left the smell lingering at my table...."
Ortal K.,"Tarzana, CA",40,48,,1.0,1/2/2015,"It has been a while since we have gone to Chili's, so yesterday we decided to go for lunch. My arnold palmer tasted like flavored water, our guacamole was BROWN and tasteless (it was even FROZEN in some spots), my mango tilapia smelled *really* fishy, the rice it came with had a few uncooked grains, and even our molten cake dessert had a chunk of un-warmed filling in the middle. Our kids had the kraft mac and cheese which was so dry and gross that even they refused to eat it. How does one manage to screw up boxed mac and cheese anyway? All in all, I gave this place one star just because our waiter was very polite. Won't be back....ever."
Gina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,,2.0,3/11/2015,"Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night.  What a bad idea.   Our waiter, Brent was slow and we had to ask him for everything!   Enough silverware so our family could eat (he brought 3 and there were 5 of us).   We had to ask him to clear our dishes after we were clearly finished (seriously?) and when he told us we could check out on the tablet at the table, it didn't work but he never came back to find out what was going on!    We asked the manager to help us with our check out by taking our credit card and running it, but all she did was pass it to our server who then took forever to get it back to us. I'm sympathetic to a busy restaurant, but it wasn't that busy.   Maybe he was new??   First day for him maybe???"
Daniel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,43,8,3.0,7/17/2014,"i haven't been to a Chili's in years... im glad they updated the payment option because there is nothing worse when you're done eating and you're still waiting for the check. The food was ok, my fries were cold and the rice was undercooked. but it was just ok...."
Albert D.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",46,5,2,1.0,3/8/2015,"This used to be one of my favorite spots. I really enjoy the sport bar atmosphere at the bar. Last night, after a long day and starving. I was hoping to take my girl out to eat. It was after 10pm and all the places she would like were closed. I talked her into Chili's. I called confirmed they were open till midnight. Got there and sat in the bar area I enjoy so much. Long story short. We sat there for 20 minutes with no service, not even to order drinks. I asked the bartender for a drink and she got upset cause I was sitting at a table. I told her we had been there for a while. She said it hasn't been that long and we could go at this all night. Poor customer service!!! Never going back."
Mike H.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",146,303,354,3.0,3/8/2013,I had a pleasant experience. I don't' come in here a lot anymore but prices are fair. They always have a deal going on. Drinks are pretty good.
Marine B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,21,17,1.0,11/9/2014,Horrible service! Waiter went to get refill for drinks never returned back to the table! I will never come here again.
Linzy P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,24,117,1.0,7/11/2014,My first time trying this ! The food was so bad ! The chicken taste like u eating a lemon in ir mounts awful ! The services is really bad too ! Never come back here again
David C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,4,1.0,6/15/2014,"They have this new digital tablet on the tables and they have games and all that fun stuff. What they didn't tell you is that it costs money to play them, nor do they tell you that it costs money to play them! I think the way they do it is soo sneaky. It is such a scam! Yes it's only a dollar but it's the principle!! Hate this place!!!!"
Scott R.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",3,93,29,4.0,5/13/2013,"Chase was our waiter and was great - had a few laughs. The food came out on time and was good - ordered from the 2 for $20 menu which had a nice selection. Had the mango chicken, the piece of chicken was very small but tasty, the chilli was amazing.   Drinks were always refilled without asking.  Good all around!!!"
Monique G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,1,1.0,9/13/2014,"Ordered the sampler , and yuck!! It use to be good this time it tasted salty and soggy :("
Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,5.0,10/29/2015,Jordan at the bar is awesome. Great place for Sunday football plus happy hour all day Sunday. They always play the Packers!
Suzi L.,"Burbank, CA",8,173,32,5.0,1/25/2013,Love this Chili's. Food is always good. Love the two for $20 special. 2 Select meals and 1 choice of select appetizers for $20!! Can't beat that deal!!  Gotta try the Molten Lava Cake!
