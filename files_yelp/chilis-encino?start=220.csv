Mike M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,40,,1.0,11/16/2014,Ribs are horrible and I had to send it back. This place used to be good but it went downhill. I wanted to enjoy my experience but left a bad taste in my head. Maybe won't return.
Bree K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/29/2013,"The customer service here is AH-MAZING! I don't remember our server's name, but she was great and very attentive.  The food on the other hand was not what I expected. I expected it to be a lot better. I tried the Cajun Pasta at many other restaurants and thought I should stick to that since it's always super good. Bad choice. The food came out super quick, which is always a plus, but the pasta was all stuck together! The sauce did not taste the way it should and they only sprinkled a bit of the Cajun spice. Not the best I have tried and definitely not worth my $12.  My boyfriend ordered the Guacamole Burger. Again, not what we expected. The description clearly said ""Topped with fresh guacamole, melted Monterrey Jack cheese, fire-roasted jalapenos, sauteed red & green bell peppers, caramelized onions & cumin-lime sour cream"". We did not get the caramelized onions, sour cream, or the fire roasted jalapenos. I hate to bother a kind server when it's clearly not her fault, but this was a little ridiculous. NOT GOING BACK!  This restaurant only got the 2 stars because of the lovely server."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,4.0,4/10/2011,"Got here in just enough time to watch some Russian guy hit his kid so the kid was crying for the entire time we were there.  Luckily the Russian guy dropped money on the table for his wife and left otherwise we would have had to explain to our kids why I had to call the cops on him. The food was as good as Chili's is gonna get so I can't really complain.  The server we had was a beautiful young girl with gorgeous eyes and that earned me a slap from my wife.  I had to spend the rest of the night telling her that I really do think she is the most beautiful girl in the world (and to me, she is). Here's a tip for people coming here.  If you are driving on the street and you find parking on the street, I'd try that first.  The parking lot is always full  If you are smart enough to park downstairs, then you'll have no problems.  I like coming here with the family cause it has a good vibe and we can take a walk in the shopping center after we eat.  It's a nice quiet evening out."
Justin B.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",1027,157,80,3.0,7/31/2013,"Don't eat Chili's very often anymore.  The decor and menu have definitely changed with the times.  Tried the $20 for 2 meal with drinks.  Nothing huge, but was really quite full with a nice margarita on top.  Not bad, have been back since discovering the to go menu and late hours.  Fries are my weakness, appetizers not so much unless you are drinking.  Not a place that comes to mind unless nothing else pops up and it's after 10pm."
Angel R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",149,89,109,2.0,5/21/2011,"I was at this Chili's on grand opening day several years ago.  Every so often I come back here to enjoy some beers and appetizers with friends and every single time I leave disappointed.   When they first opened, everything was executed perfectly, great food, equally great service, short wait times and great energy.  It just seems like over the years the upper management at Chili's has stopped caring about this location because it's not as new anymore. The last time I was here I was with a party of 5.  We got the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant.  Our server looked like she was 19, and she decided she was going to take our order without writing it down (very ballsy for a new server), 5 people's order without writing them down, including drinks.  What could have been an opportunity to impress us with her amazing memory skills, turned into her demise.  She screwed up half of our orders and even completely forgot to put my GF's order in.  My GF had to wait for her food while everyone else started eating, her food took almost another 20 minutes to come out.  Our beer glasses remained empty for most of the night because our server never really came around to check on us.  You would think she would have wanted us to order more, naturally isn't that going to increase her tip!? At the end of our meal, our party of 5 was royally annoyed.  We practically had to chase our waitress down for any kind of service, and from the looks of it, we were her only remaining table of the night.  She had no excuse!  It's almost like when she realized she messed up our food order, she just gave up for the rest of the night.  When the bill came it was just over $100, me and my friends don't usually do this but we felt like we had to make a statement.  We left her a $3 dollar tip and some advice on the back of the receipt, ""Next time, write it down!"""
Martha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/16/2013,"I went here last week, and the service was AWFUL! I felt like they completely ignored us the whole time. It was so disappointing. When we finally got our food, the portions were a lot smaller than usual, and the taste was below average. It was such a terrible experience. I usually love going to Chili's in Northridge, but I will never go to the Encino location again!"
Brig V.,"Simi Valley, CA",1410,109,47,5.0,10/16/2013,They put their cheeseburger on a pretzel roll when I asked! Love that. Great food & service! I also love their FourSquare checkin deals...
Rachael S.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",97,100,45,5.0,7/27/2011,"Oh yea, this is where I go to get happy :) Have this and you will cry with joy also... Onion stack, fried lighly with or without jalapenos, huge! $8 ish Burger!!!! Get the Ultimate burger (even if its not on the menu ask for it coz i get it everytime) You can add or take any toppings you want, my way of life is avacado, onion rings, bacon and blue cheese with bbq sauce! yes! $10 inluding fries!! Charbroiled too for that grilled taste! Wear your elastic pants and have brownie for dessert,  Cheap and everything is great and cooked fresh! I even had shrimp fajitas every week here at one point, they are really really good and lots of food for around $15. On par with Baja fresh, which I dont care what you think about most food chains, it is amazing. Service can be weird, slow or both, but who cares. Heaven...its nice to meet you."
Oscar A.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,10,,1.0,1/5/2015,So I was here w/ my friend the other day for happy hour and we had some margaritas/food. I've been here before and I've experienced bad customer service most of the time. My friend spotted a roach behind me which was gross and made me lose my appetite. We told the manager about it and he just laughed about it. He didn't take it serious. But what the fuck is a roach doing at your restaurant ? I feel like this place is always dirty and getting dirtier. Def the last time I go after that roach incident. It's getting one star because the girl helping us was very polite.
Janice L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,1.0,10/6/2014,"I love chillis, I don't usually come to this one but this time I was meeting up with a friend, we sat at the bar with Seth was are server. Worst server ever! Very rude and told me I was too fancy!! Not cool"
Carla B.,"New York, NY",382,482,582,2.0,1/4/2011,"I think I either have to stop eating in Encino or never again pursue big chains. Or both? Service wasn't bad, but I ordered the Chicken Crispers with mashed potatoes, and the potatoes and the chicken were too dry. It seemed like the chicken had been fried a long time ago, because it was chewy. Also, the breading flour they use now (or at this specific location) is different, more KFC-ish.  :-/   The Molten Chocolate Cake with ice cream was delicious, but I think it's hard to screw *that* up.  One good thing though, is they have a $20 deal of your choice of 2 entrées and an appetizer (from a limited menu, of course), which IS a great value.  The bill: Double Take (1 shared appetizer + 2 entrées) @ $20 1 Strawberry Lemonade @ $2.89 1 Soda @ $2.39 1 shared Molten Chocolate Cake dessert @ $5.99 + Tax @ $3.05 _____________________________________________ = $34.32 plus tip Free parking in the rear of the building and in front of the mall next door."
Alex C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,71,55,4.0,8/9/2013,"So I went to this place on Tuesday 8/6 and Thursday 8/7 to kill some time. On Tuesday I ordered chips and salsa and an order or guacanole. Chips are thin and break in the salsa.. not good. Got the guacamole and it was still frozen in the middle... I can back Wednesday again to kill some time and ordered their skillet queso with chips. When it came it looked like beans. To be honest I didn't taste any cheese in it at all. I was hungry so I ate it. Why 4 stars? Well $3.99 for a 24oz Coors Light helped. That's their late night happy hour price which starts at 9pm. Mainly though the staff was very cool, friendly and attentive. I only dealt with the 2 bartenders a male and female on Tuesday and the same guy on Wednesday. Very nice staff and due to that I will go back next time I am in town."
Eric G.,"Los Angeles, CA",440,27,13,4.0,11/10/2013,"Had their new garlic steak and it was pretty good. The only problem I have is that the portion size was too small for maximum pleasure. I love that they have all the games going on so you can catch up on sports if you're like me. There was practically no wait for us which is a major plus. I love going to chili's, especially for their sampler."
Shelley Z.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,18,14,4.0,2/15/2014,"Chili's is one of our best go-to restaurants. We love the food here. It is the best bang for your buck. They recently renovated the inside. We have been going here for many years, at least a decade. I really prefer eating at the bar because the service is better. Unfortunately, the new servers are pretty unattentive and forget things like condiments you may need with your food or when to take your order or bring your order. We miss the former servers who knew the points of service. And if you go during a change in shift, it is worse. But luckily the food wins out over all that. I hope they stay here for a long time."
Brittany T.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",1,26,6,5.0,3/4/2014,I absolutely love this place. Jessie is soo sweet. The food is ALWAYS delicious!!! They have a bar with 6 TV and there's always a game on.
Bobbi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,84,,1.0,6/19/2010,"Do you guys remember the ""Awesome Blossom""? That glorious deep fried mecca of calories that I allow myself to eat because hey, it's got SOME veggies (I love onions). Anyway, I remember the insane marketing Chili's did with this Awesome Blossom years ago SO I decide to go to Chili's (WTF) to finally get the AWESOME BLOSSOM! What a dirty dump. Luckily I ordered to To Go. JK. Very unlucky to make this decision because I was waiting around for about 10 minutes at the To-Go station waiting for Anyone to acknowledge me. TEN minutes? Dude wtf, you're in customer service. The only thing keeping my sanity during these ten minutes was watching the dumbass servers in the kitchen. I have respect for people who work at restaurants but not this specific cast. Dumb broads staring RIGHT AT ME yet totally not trying to help.  Finally when we get some attention... ME- May I please have an Awesome Blossom SERVER- Uhhh we stopped making that. Ha ha ha.  FUCK YOU!!!!!!! Anywhoooo. I ordered some pasta and nasty-ass ""grilled chicken sandwich"" that they serve on an Arby's loaf. The order took about 20 minutes and the STONED OUT OF HIS MIND dude that was helping us forgot our soda. Turns out their coke machine was low so he had to re-fuel the syrup. After an additional X amount of minutes waiting we finally get our 32 oz of flat Cocacola in a classy foam cup. The food was sick, why the hell did I waste $24 bucks here?"
Josette B.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,48,63,1.0,5/31/2011,"first of all I am a chillis fan!!  I love their ribs and molten~~ I used to go to chillis in WHittier...  love them! My family and I recently moved here in Encino.  I was thrilled that Chilli's is near my new home.  We had lunch on Sat 05.21.11 and was disappointed!   I ordered, half slab of ribs and it was awful.  I then called my server and explained to him that the ribs were old.  I mentioned it to my server and right away he took the plate back in the kitchen and came back with new order of half slab of ribs.  I asked the server to stay while I try it again (some how I knew it will taste the same). Turns out it was! same old tasting ribs. It seems that the ribs has been sitting in a room temperature and put in a microwave and served it to me.  I ended up changing my order to bacon cheese burger.. (dry)   This is the first time I was disappointed by Chilli's."
Elana Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,17,,1.0,5/23/2014,Really horrible service at the bar seating. We were unfortunate enough to have a rude and uneducated waitress ( I think her name was Kylee or something) She was just a plain old bitch who gave me a hard time because I thought the buffalo wings were too spicy. She gave me and my friend a very nasty evil eye look and talked back to us. I was left in shock. Thanks to you we're never going back! Disgusted!
Théo P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",77,195,31,4.0,4/6/2013,"Oh Chili's... you will always be there in times of need for a cheap happy hour fix. Admittedly I would have never thought I'd enjoy coming here for drinks, but now I look forward to it as a mid week celebration; though I still haven't figured out what were celebrating. We always eat in the bar area, where there's ample seating in both booth and high table form. The service is consistently great, and the prices are unbeatable. The beer selection isn't huge, but that's understandable as it's primarily a restaurant. There are also lots of TVs for those who want to catch a game, and the tables are always clean and well stocked."
Farnaz S.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,7,,2.0,2/7/2015,I think they changed the chef. Fajita is terrible. Never come here for their famous fajita. Shrooms are smaller and taste bad.
