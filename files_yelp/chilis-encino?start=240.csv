Sindy R.,"Fontana, CA",9,1,,2.0,6/22/2014,Me and my boyfriend LOVE chili's but we had a bad experience at this particular one. First of all we called ahead to get our names on the list since we didn't know the area or how full it was going to be. N when we got there they hadn't gotton our name down but they said they would move us up because they believed that we had called ahead. I ordered the bottomless express lunch that I normally get for the chicken enchilada soup and because we get chips n salsa while we wait. So I ordered that n the waiter brought the chips n salsa and about 5-10 mins later he brought out my salad and another 5-10 mins go by and he comes to tell me that they don't have any chicken enchilada soup. He should of informed me before I ordered! It was 3 in the afternoon that's a bit early to be running out of soup but whatever but then he starts offering the thee soups n I already know I don't like them so I ask I I can get something else meh says I can't so I choose the loaded potato soup cuz that's the only other one I sorta like n the guy brings me loaded potatoes... So I told him I wanted the soup not the potatoes so he brings the soup n it was tasteless n just bad. I didn't touch it! When he comes to leave the check I told him I didn't like the soup so he said ok that he would take care of it so in the end he ended up not charging us for my meal so that was good but then we noticed that he had charged us for the loaded potatoes he had messed up! But luckily he took that off too! So i ended up loosing my appetite with all the waiting n just one salad but the waited did handle the situation well in the end so that's why they got one star n the other on was because my boyfriends meal was good.
Mitchell I.,"Marina del Rey, CA",92,236,265,3.0,4/2/2013,This place is ok for the valley.  Staff was pretty friendly and efficient.  I am just against the whole restaurants that provide manufactured food experience.  It was inexpensive.
Katherine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,8,5,4.0,10/15/2014,"love it! like this one better than the Northridge Chilis' ... and the waitress for happy hour was amazing, fast, helpful, easygoing, knew what she was talking about and was doing, food was great and hot, drinks were delicious and dessert was bomb! best affordable happy hour for last minute bestie dates!"
Ariell E.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,26,20,4.0,3/24/2013,This location has always been great every time I have gone. I always go for their happy hour and I sit in the bar area. You don't have to sit at the actual bar which is nice but they have a few booths along the sides and also high top tables. The happy hour is great and the service is always awesome!
Evan S.,"Northridge, CA",51,55,,2.0,5/21/2011,"When I was younger, I used to like this place.  I went back twice recently.  The first time I got a sandwich, and did not like it much.  I thought maybe it was just what I ordered, so when friends wanted to go there, I went along with the plan.  This time I ordered something I recalled liking when I used to go here, and again I was unimpressed.   My tastes have changed a lot over the years, and I'm much more health-conscious with my eating habits now than I used to be.  This menu is full of polluted food that will clog arteries and is prepared in just about the least health-conscious ways possible.  Everything is fried or drenched in oil or cheese or some calorie-rich sauces. Great if you like SAD (Standard American Diet) foods, and want to be a fat, bloated pig.  Not so great if you want to stay thin, eat healthy, and have a good heart. On the upside, the service was great both times, and the drinks are quite good. I won't be returning unless friends insist, or if it is the only place when I'm on the road."
Jennifer H.,"Canyon Country, CA",10,30,2,4.0,12/23/2010,"Here's a warning in advance about my review as it is based on only one food item. I only go here for one reason and one reason only - I go there when I have a hormonal chocolate craving that must be satisfied immediately to prevent large scale catastrophe.  (In other words, PMS).  So far, everyone at Chili's is alive and well, so it is safe to presume that their chocolate lava cake has managed to always save the day."
Jon P S.,"Burbank, CA",55,54,29,4.0,6/9/2011,Chili's is always comforting when there are deals thrown in the air. The food is pretty good and their service is great. Great place for a nice dinner or whatever the occasion is.  Their molten cake is bomb.
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",813,33,8,4.0,1/13/2012,"Good restaurant, but I would specifically rate this on the lower end of the scale rather than a solid 4 stars. I've eaten at this location of Chili's several times now and my friend and I always order the Chili 2 for $20; it's a lot of food for just $20 bucks!  The appetizer we almost always order is their Texas Cheese Fries (see my pic) and the baby back ribs, and surprisingly, the ribs have always been cooked to a tender perfection.  The ambience is nice and one aspect that I like about this particular Chili's is that they have plenty of random travel photos throughout the restaurant, along with other interesting items planted throughout the restaurant to make you amuse with fascination. The service has been good but then again, I've always frequented during their slower hours."
Morgan R.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",108,67,5,5.0,6/25/2013,"after realizing it was late, and we hadn't eaten all day, my husband i decided roll to chilis. 8pm, Saturday night.  There was only a 10 minute wait to be seated, or open seating at the bar.. we walked right up to a bar table. Within in a minute we were greeted by our server. (i wish i could find the receipt so i could give her a shoot out.. it was a blond girl, early to mid twenties?).. anyways. she was amazing. she took our order, didnt write it down, but was able to repeat it all back to us 100% accurately. Our appetizer came out super fast, and our food followed right behind.. She was great. So on top of the refils, the sauces, everything. By far the best service i have ever received at chillis!"
Candi C.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",53,11,4,4.0,6/20/2013,"My husband and I frequent this location.. and we love the remodel!  The past few times we've gone our services was just okay, which was disappointing for us. Until this week.. Roya was our server in the bar, and she was ON IT.  She came by every few minutes and made sure we had everything we needed. I made sure to give her kudos, and let the manager know how happy we were with her. Having great service really makes the experience and we'll definitely be returning and hoping to see Roya again! :)"
Peter M.,"Denver, CO",492,746,83,3.0,5/15/2008,"Um, ok...  So I'm only reviewing this because I have decided to Yelp my life as a sort of journal, so that when I'm dead and gone, Hollywood will have more information for my life story on the Lifetime channel. It's Chili's.  They're all the same.  Chili's food, a Chili's crowd, noisy and packed for dinner.  Nothing special.  Nothing appalling.  Just another cookie cutter chain restaurant. If you've never been to a Chili's, it's a mexi-themed Bennigan's.  Bennigan's is a Irish themed Friday's.  Friday's is the day I gits my drink on!!!"
Legra A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,21,10,1.0,4/24/2012,"I went to Chili's for Lunch for a group of 6. For 20 minutes no one came to the table to get our drinks, or  even walk by just to say I'll be right with you. When we finally ordered the food it took a long time to come out. They also advised that one of the food ordered would take even longer than the awaited time, got one of the orders wrong and  forgot to bring one of the food that was ordered - so had to take it to go because by that time everyone already finished eating. No one refilled our drinks or even offered. One of the reasons might be the lack of staff but they should know better -since its lunch time. Overall the food was okay but due to the lack of service I will NOT be going to this particular restaurant again."
Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",832,655,374,4.0,2/13/2012,"Chili's, Chili's, Chili's. Even though your food is such an average selection and average flavors, it always is so damn good, I find myself wondering, ""why haven't I been to Chili's in a while?"" The food is always good and their chocolate chip paradise pie is the best dessert I've ever had. The coconut, chcoolate, brownie, ice cream.. Delicious! Service is always great at any Chili's location. I had only been to this Chili's once and decided to come here again and try out the bar with a friend. The drinks were made STRONG (A+) and our appetizers were delicious, even if a little greasy. I'm always down for Chili's consistently good food at very fair prices."
Francis F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",12,46,1,3.0,12/29/2010,"Took my girl and her nephews here for a bite. Got seated after a few minutes.  Even though there were open tables, I had to wait   We ordered drinks and got them quickly The kids had chili and chicken fingers. Both were good.  I had a combo and really liked the salmon And chicken. My girl had a mushroom burger , not bad at all Later on, I had a bit of indentation.  No biggie! Chilis you ok"
Stephanie S.,"Quartz Hill, CA",12,28,6,4.0,9/8/2013,"Food was ok. But the service was great. Matt was very attentive, made sure we were good and was very professional. Can't really complain when you have good service!"
ted J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,3,1.0,2/4/2013,Pooooor service! !!!!! I've been waiting for 10 minutes without beening served! !!
Jackie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,239,12,5.0,6/24/2015,"I eat here frequently because the service is fast and friendly and the food is very good for a chain restaurant.  I have quit going to a lot of chain restaurants that I used to love (TGI Fridays) because they just either have gone downhill or everything around them got better.  I'm not sure which it is.  But Chilis is still pretty good.  Their burgers and chicken crispers are excellent.  My only negative is the chicken fajitas.  I used to be a big fan of them years ago.  But now the chicken just doesn't seem to be great quality and it has no flavor.  There isn't much flavor in the veggie in the fajitas either.  My son had a chicken sandwich and it didn't look good either and he also said it didn't seem like good quality chicken.  With that being said, they have lots of other stuff to choose from.  Their burgers are 5 star.  They have a lot of different varieties and their fries are great too.  I like to sit in the bar for extra friendly fast service.  I like the machine that let's you pay your bill at the table with a credit card and it even prints the receipts.  Their desserts look and smell terrific.  I haven't tried them but they have chocolate molten cake and cookies with ice cream that look awesome."
Dmitry K.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,363,37,3.0,2/2/2010,"The image and food of Chili's has been in declivity on the food and service scale, but it still ranks as a legitimate contender.  The portions are big and satisfying. The Santa Fe chicken wrap sandwich is an excellent choice for all the lean eaters out there. It is difficult to find something 'healthy' in their gargantuan menu of motley meat items and carb overload entres, but they do a good job on the offering and pointing out alternatives. Triple Dipper =Spinach and Artichoke dip, and the southwestern egg rolls tasted great. I definitely recommend these items in the triple dipper.  I do like their full bar option and the Mojito was one of the best Mojitos I have ever had. On weekends there is always a wait for dinner. Not long though. We came at around 8:00PM, and the guy told us it'll be a 20 minute wait. We waited for probably 7 minutes until they buzzed us in. Great strategy...Over-estimate the waiting time, so that when your called early, it will be a pleasant surprise. The bathroom was also an interesting pit stop in the Chilli's Grill & Bar adventure. I entered the bathroom. Paper Towels all over the floor. The trash bin was leaking and overloaded with paper towels. The faucet was on. No one was washing their hands or was in the bathroom. Writing on the wall telling me that ""Bill was here"". Hi Bill. Aside from the unkempt bathroom, this place is good, and got the job done for me."
Jessica A.,"North Hollywood, CA",261,166,769,5.0,11/5/2009,"I forgot to mention, over the many times i come here whether it be after work, random outings, random cravings.... SERVICE HERE IS THE BEST! They always seem to put a smile on my face, im always complimenting them on what a fantastic job they do, and the waitors/waitresses just do the job DAMN GOOD.  How many times have you remembered the name of the person has served you and have asked for them? If you remember each and every one of them, they must be doing something right."
Leo C.,"Encino, CA",51,210,27,3.0,8/27/2010,"My wife and I have gone to several Chili's restaurants and have come to a conclusion....its either a hit or miss with it. Youre either going to get good service and delicious food, or youre going to get crappy service and mediocre food. Sometimes you get delicious food with crappy service which is why we tip low when that happens...because they should learn to be nice regardless and that nothing in life is free. We will go again to Chili's. We dont mind it as much as others may. We understand that its just a step above fast food and we know not to have high expectations when going in.  But I will say this, we get decent food 75-80% of the time we go. We live really close to the one in Encino so every so often we like to ""splurge"" on junk food.....and eat there."
