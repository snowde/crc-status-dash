Gina W.,"Richmond, VA",155,237,131,3.0,3/1/2010,"Came here on Saturday with my best friends.  Expected the usual corporate Chili's flare however was surprised to see that we got the most interesting waiter. He was like Devo out of Friday...  and he sure did make up for the surgary tasting food! From telling us what drinks not too order ""Too sweet"", to telling us that we could not order our meat well done. ""Takes all the nutrients out, "" he said Now I am not used to being told what to do by a waiter, but I must say, it is an experience that I am willing to try again."
Citi G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",51,106,,3.0,12/5/2010,"The place was EMPTY!  I thought I was the only person to notice this..until a man walked up to the hostess and asked ""Is it always this empty on a Sunday?"" ""uhhhhh....yeah"", was the reply from the dazed and confused hostess. The food was ok.  Never got ketchup or hot sauce.  The waiter was nice enough.  He said the food would be out in 15 minutes, and it was out in 10.  Good service.   The chili made me puke later on in the night,  not sure if it was Chili's fault or my sensitive tummy...I enjoyed it well enough."
Ryan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",385,347,2,1.0,6/23/2009,"Okay, so I have a little secret.  Shhh.  Promise you won't tell?  I'm touching myself under my desk at work.  No, just kidding.  But I did eat at Chili's for the first time ever.  It wasn't by choice, I swear.  Will I go back?  Never! So a friend was in town on business, and we met for dinner out in Encino.  I used to work in Encino, so I know tons of holes in the wall that are really good, but was my advice enlisted?  Noooooo!  And was the meal edible?  Noooooo! Maybe I missed out by not ordering the baby back ribs.  But given the quality of the food, I seriously doubt it.  Maybe Fat Bastard had it down, but I don't think so.  Of course, that guy would've eaten anything... even a baby for shit's sake.  I eat because I'm fat and I'm fat because I eat too, but DAMN! I ordered the chicken club tacos.  Mistake?  Yes.  The chicken was dry and rubbery.  And the salsa?  Narsty.  My girl went for the vegetable soup... gross.  My buddy did it best.  He went for the fried chicken tacos.  I didn't try them, but if you're going to Chili's you should order the fried stuff.  He ate it all.  With fries.  Interesting combination, but like I said, the fried stuff is probably the safest.  Why?  Because fried makes anything good, duh. I'm not trying to be a bourgeois snob, but that was some of the worst food that I've had in a while.  Sure, the prices are reasonable, but unless you're bringing a kid's birthday party there, you're missing something.  There are family-owned places where you can get a homemade meal for the same price, so don't tell me I'm a fucking elitist damnit.  That shit was just plain nasty.  I consider it a cultural experience... and it's a culture in which I want no part.  1 star."
Kleio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2015,I used to love ordering food to go from Chili's but the last 3 time the sides I have ordered to go along with my meal has been lacking. I enjoy the chips and salsa and I also normally order the quac as well. The frist time I had full to go order cups full of the salsa ad also the quac. But the last 3 times I have ordered food the sides I ordered to go along with my food has been half full cups of salsa and half ful l cups of quac. The bag of chips are also half full and mostly crushed. I am normally in a rush when I pick up my food because of time restrants so that I can get back to work so I am not able to check my food until I get back to work so I can eat while at my desk. By that time I have no time to go back and try to have them fix the issue. This makes me very upset becuse I also always leave a tip for the person who is just grabbing the bag of food that has already been set out for them. They could at least check it and make sure that it is correct before handing it off to the customer.
Emmanuel Y.,"Van Nuys, CA",94,20,8,4.0,5/2/2012,"Came here for the happy hour, and to be honest it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, given the previous reviews.  Getting a table wasn't a problem, but I suppose since we were coming for happy hour it's free seating around the bar area.  Although the fried onion and jalapeño appetizer was a bit too salty, it overall wasn't that bad.  Service was good and attentive, we got our food pretty fast and there was overall no problem.  Good for a second time around."
Joseph A.,"Willard, Santa Ana, CA",215,73,21,5.0,3/13/2012,"I'm not much of a chain restaurants type of guy, but my service and food was exceptional here!  And if you're lucky enough to get Justin as your server, tip him well!  He's friendly, upbeat, and attentive.  When dining out, the food is important, but the service is equally as important as it is about the whole experience.  I can't speak for the others, but he sure made me and my friend feel welcome and warm."
Abby Q.,"Sepulveda, CA",0,6,6,4.0,8/17/2010,"I had a ""quesadilla explosion"", I really thought it was great! Loved the flavors :) I also tried a patron pomegranate margarita it was really really good :) try it !"
Bob R.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/29/2012,"Slow service,  disappointing food, dirty floor all due to poor or no Management, I will not return."
Heidi J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/11/2013,"I moved into the area recently so I have been going to this location lately. I have had great experiences each time.  Our group, of about 8, found seating in the bar very easily on a Thursday night. They have renovated the place with Plasma TV's everywhere, even in the dining area. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. I highly recommend this location."
Janet M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/9/2014,I work in Tarzana and for a change the whole office tries to order from Chili's but unfortunately they NEVER get the order right and are always late preparing it.  It seems they don't read the orders that are e-mailed to them.  Chili's has great food but unfortunately we won't be able to order from them anymore - this is the third time we have tried and the third time it was wrong.....
Gayane K.,"Van Nuys, CA",102,223,63,4.0,11/21/2011,Great spot for a girls night out! .. Lots of parking located in a shopping center. The service is very nice.. Stupidly love their chips and salsa. I got the Avacado burger which was pretty damn good.. dissapointed my waitress didnt ask how i like my meat cooked though. eh.. They have some insane mixes on their menu like bacon ranch quesadilla? pretty amazing thought i had that the last time i was there. Anyway you cant go wrong with pretty much anything there!
Arman S.,"Van Nuys, CA",25,28,2,3.0,1/16/2012,"Iv always been interested in chilis from their comercials but when i tried it i discovered it was bland, tasteless, and overpriced. The staff were awsome tho."
Patrick M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",60,246,84,4.0,10/30/2011,"Been here many times with family and friends. The food is good, the service is average and the noise level (depending the time you go) can be a little loud. I don't have anything bad to say about this place."
Jason B.,"Van Nuys, CA",1,27,,2.0,3/6/2011,"Went to dinner Sat. evening, 3/5/11. Hadn't been to Chili's in about 4-5 months. Is it just me, or did they go downhill? Menu is now smaller with less choices and boring! I tried the ""new"" cobb salad. When it was brought out it looked like any salad I could have gotten at Denny's! My wife had an caesar salad with added grilled shrimp ($6.49 more) and again, it was a non discript, plain, boring salad. Something must have changed at the home office at Chili's because one of the main reasons we have always returned to Chili's, was their consistency. With costs for food and the economy the way it is these days, I think returning to Chili's and giving them another chance is out of the question for us. There are too many good restaurants out there with competitive pricing trying to keep their heads above water, and I think we will make an attempt to frequent them."
Thomas T.,"Encino, CA",2,23,1,5.0,3/29/2012,Good! I like Tex-Mex and this restaurant chips and fresh salsa/gacamoli never bored me.
Tony Y. Jr. Y.,"Glendale, CA",63,490,1443,3.0,3/25/2009,"This was my first time at Chili's and I had take-out.  We ordered take-out for lunch at work from here, particularly because a colleague had given me a gift card to this place.  I tried the cheesesteak sandwich and it was loaded with meat, cheese, green peppers, and onions.  I wouldn't recommend eating this for lunch, while at work, because I was very sleepy afterwards.   I would've given this place a 4, but I had to go back because they didn't give us everything that we ordered."
John J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,,2.0,8/2/2012,This place is dirty and dark. The foods are mainly frozen.
Patricia J.,"Sylmar, CA",32,23,1,1.0,1/2/2012,"Where do I start.... We waited about 15 minutes just to see our waitress, by the time she arrived we were all ready to order.  My son spilled his drink, 2 waiters passed by and completely ignored us when we tried telling them about the spilled drink.  The hostess even had the nerve to sit a family behind us where the drink was running on the floor.  about 20 minutes after we were done eating our waitress finally showed up and we asked for the check.  She must of gone out to cut the tree to get the paper to print our check on because it took another 20 minutes for her to return with our check!  And we weren't the only customers frustrated, there was another table across from us upset.  The worst part was the fact that it wasn't busy at all!!!! No excuse for horrible service! Never returning here again!"
Sophia H.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",59,4,1,1.0,8/20/2014,"I usually get food from the chilis in west hills. But since I work across this location I been coming here. I would think because they're located in Encino on the boulevard the food would be great as well as the service. But geez was I wrong. Service is HORRIBLE!!!!! It's never busy when I go and I always get take out. It takes them like 15 min to acknowledge I'm even there. And I have to go to the bar and the daytime bartender is super slow and he once gave my change to someone else if it wasn't for the customer being honest and returning it. Id probably would have never received it. To top it all off my bill was like 9$ and I paid with a $100. I would understand if they were busy. But they aren't even busy, still I get horrible service. The food isn't even great. I order mash potatoes and they were so chunky and the Mac and cheese was undercooked. Every time I order, I get something different and it's always DISGUSTING !!!! I never have this problem at any other chilis. By far the worst chilis I been to. Food is gross service is horrible. I wonder who their manager is in the day time because he's definitely not doing his job keeping the place in order. Also every time I go in the workers are sitting down watching the sports near the bar area. DONT COME HERE!!!!!!! I wish I could have rated it ZERO but luckily for them there isn't that option."
Andrew A.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",20,31,,3.0,11/22/2011,"Went here for lunch today.  Sat right down, server was prompt and took our drink and foor order and had both in a few minutes.  I have been to Chili's many many times but today I tried the MARGARITA GRILLED CHICKEN for the first time.  I have to say it was pretty good.  Have to get that again sometime"
