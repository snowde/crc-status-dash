Ryan B.,"Studio City, CA",154,239,51,3.0,9/21/2011,"My wife and I are always game for a walk or quick drive over to our neighborhood Chili's... We enjoy grabbing an app at Happy Hour, washing it down with a couple of margaritas. Food's usually tasty and more than enough for us."
Samm M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/10/2014,"I had a very good experience at this place  , love the food  their coffe is coffee is great  , the portion seemed to be  alittle    but at the end I was  satisfied."
Henry L.,"Tustin, CA",21,90,19,3.0,6/21/2011,"This place is nothing special. Typical cookie cutter franchised restaurant with mediocore food. No wait, service is okay. The only thing good is that they have awesome dinner specials for two for $20! comes with one appetizer and two entrees. Come early if you want ribs they always run out."
Abby M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,2.0,2/21/2014,"I really wanted to like this place! been here a handful of times.. and i'm just not impressed! the food is okay.. not horrible but not amazing.. The thing that really bothered me about this place was the service. It took them forever to sit us down. once they did, we waited 15 for a high chair. Which ended up being a booster because they were all being occupied. Which is understandable! but really..??! it took 15mins just too get a booster. kind of ridiculous, After that The waitress didn't come for an additional 20 Mins!! Another waitress came to us and asked how everything was and we said that no one had been with us! she ended up taking up our table even though it wasn't even on her section! she was really nice! and i did appreciate the fact that she did that. But that wasn't the only time we had a bad experience with the staff. they just take too long! it's a goo place to go to if you want to be there a couple of hours and dont have anything to do after.. because you might be late to that! And like i said the food is just ok.. in my opinion. But give it a try for yourself and see how it goes for u.. this was just my experience. Yours might be better!"
kelly k.,"Van Nuys, CA",5,90,,1.0,10/12/2008,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. DO NOT PASS GO. Horrible service, salty food. An awful waste of money!  Head west down Ventura and eat at The Stand or continue on to Island's.  Chili's is BAD NEWS. The manger is RUDE to customers AND HIS EMPLOYEES!  He said to our faces he could care less if we tipped the bartender because of his mess up. He was a dick and we said, ""you know we could just not tip the server because you are a jerk. if we did, would you tip them to compensate?"" HE SAID NO.  Right in front of the server.  What is the world coming to?  Chili's = NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.   Please patronize nicer establishments. Chili's does not deserve a penny."
Nicolette A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",73,23,140,1.0,7/10/2010,I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It was disgusting. I rather eat my own arm then go back to that place.
Jim W.,"Palm Springs, CA",477,363,,3.0,5/15/2008,"Always there, always fair to good, nothing ""special"" (as I am sure you know).  Went there last week for a burger (I should have known better, but, I was hungry and there it was).  Service was fast, table was a bit dirty with someone elses leftover crumbs (yuck!), the burger was OK nothing special...(and I love burgers!!!).  I was in and out in 40 minutes...I will only go back if I have too...which is highly unlikely. What is it about chain restaurants that everyone seems to love?  I don't get it...I will give them 3 stars only because of the fast service."
Richard D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,47,,2.0,9/20/2010,"Went there yesterday for lunch with my wife, like people say, it's a hit and miss. We remembered our last visit to Chilies being a good one and decided to go again. Food was excellent, grilled chicken, beans and salsa. OK the cons, waited FOREVER for the server to take our order. After we received our food, we rarely saw her after that. slow service to praticaly no service. I took the Chilies on line survey and really voiced my opinion. I think my back hurts from sitting way to long in those uncomfortable booths."
Anne O.,"Tarzana, CA",3,28,2,1.0,8/8/2008,I called in an order for pick up which was to be ready in 15 minutes from the bartender. Got there 30 mins. later and had to wait almost 20 mins. to get it. When I looked in the bag there was a long black hair with fuzz on it inside the bag and another one outside the bag! Yuck! I gave it back to them and they asked did  I just want a new bag or what? I said a new order. After spending $50. you would think they would care. NOPE!  Got home and the NACHOS  looked as if they had been sitting there for a really long time. Don't even ask about the fajitas or tortillas stuck as one big pile of ??? Now I know they don't need me as a customer.  I needed them because I was hungry. I will go to McDonald's next time and save some money too!
Melissa J.,"Encino, CA",4,81,2,2.0,8/27/2012,"The past 3 times I called an order in for pickup, their computers were down, or they had a shortage of staff, or something else random was going wrong where my order was messed up and I had to wait an extended amount of time."
Jason D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,92,3,2.0,5/9/2010,"Chips and salsa were good, the mushroom swiss burger was boring and really salty and the trio fajitas were mediocre at best. Our service was horrible also.   Im not coming back here."
Beth F.,"Los Angeles, CA",388,410,212,3.0,6/5/2007,"I cannot, in good conscience, give any chain restaurant five stars but it gets my highest chain-honors for having everything right in their store: Good service, fast (I was getting takeout) A cute bartender to look at while I was waiting Clean Consistency of food - my Southwestern Eggrolls in FL taste the same as my Southwestern Eggrolls in LA - yay! What else can you ask for?"
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,4.0,7/7/2007,"I like Chili's because it has a vegetarian friendly menu.  They actually have my favorite black bean veggie burgers in all the world.  They are delicious.  I like how you can switch fries out for any of the other sides that they have.  They will make any meal healthier for you....for example they normally serve the steamed veggies with butter but they will make them for you without the butter.  The mashed potatoes come with gravy but they will give them to you without it.  They are great.  My one complaint about the black bean burger is how big it is.  I can only eat one half of it....it is quite heavy.  It is so good though.  I love how if you order some of the burgers they come with a few awesome blossom strings.  I figure a few awesome blossom strings must be outweighed by getting the veggies without butter, right????   The service is 100% always great....prompt, attentive, friendly, etc.  Someone I know worked at a different location in undergrad and told me that the management pushes them to do something called a '45 minute miracle' which means that they want every patron to be able to complete their meals and leave happy in around 45 minutes.  Funny, that is what we actually did last night while trying to make a movie.  We mentioned to our waitress that we needed to make a movie and even though they were busy......we ate, chatted, got and paid our check, and left without missing the movie!  One other quick point, even if they have a wait, which they often do.....I find that the wait is never for too long.  I really like Chili's....even though they are a chain!"
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,251,5,4.0,5/3/2007,"Some friends and I were sitting around and obsessing about Awesome Blossoms and black bean burgers and all of a sudden we were rounding up the troops for a trip out to the Valley for some Chili's lovin'. I'm not sure why I like Chili's so much. Almost everything is awful for you, and much of it is just mid-level chain restaurant fare. But I LOVE IT. If you're craving chain restaurant food, you're in the Valley, and you want super-awesome-friendly service, look no further."
Cody G.,"San Jose, CA",28,100,4,3.0,2/8/2007,"You know, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but this one is pretty good.  The food is good, the drinks are stiff and the wait staff is awesome.  They have this one waitress who looks like Brooke Shields who is quite possibly the best waitress I had in 2006, and another who's name I *think* is Kira.  Both were awesome, to the core. So, it's a clean Chili's with a good waitstaff :)"
Drew M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,8,,2.0,12/22/2009,"As far as chains go, I always thought Chili's was pretty solid and it was, if nothing else, consistent.  Unfortunately, over the past year or so, this Chili's has gotten consistently bad.  Actually, I recently ate at a Chili's down in Anaheim and it also sucked, so maybe the chain as a whole is going downhill. The things that my wife and I usually get are Skillet Queso (has gotten more and more watery over the last year), Oldtimer burgers (less and less flavor, more and more overcooked), and the Chicken Tacos (which they've now removed from the menus and replaced with ""mini-tacos"" - probably an attempt to keep up with ""taco-truck-style-tacos - that were so bad that I took a couple of bites and then just picked off my wife's plate). It's a shame, because as far as chains go, Chili's used to be one of the better ones.  Not anymore - AVOID!"
Daniel W.,"Alhambra, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/26/2012,"Really terrible service. Our waiter never checked up on us, the queso appetizer came out practically cold, and it took nearly 40 minutes for our food to come out (soup and a sandwich). I don't think I've ever regretted eating out more."
Randall R.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,15,2,4.0,5/20/2010,I love Chili's!  Each time I go to eat there I feel I get a lot for my money.  The food is excellent with a variety of choices.  I love the baby back ribs and burgers and salads all equally!  The hardest thing about going to Chili's is deciding what to order because there's so many good things to choose from!
Helen B.,"Livermore, CA",0,16,,4.0,2/9/2012,"This place is a staple for my bf and me after a long work week.  We usually get the 2 for $20 which is a great deal.  The staff is a bit of a hit or miss, but for the prices (and their yummy skinny-ritas) it's still a good place to just relax with some yummy food."
Fran K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/4/2012,"Worst baby back ribs ever. We had Memphis Rub. The ribs were incredibility dry, overdone and tasteless. There was virtually no meat on the ribs. At least the mashed potatoes with pepper gravy (you couldn't taste the pepper) were edible."
