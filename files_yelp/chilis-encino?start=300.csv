Julie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/25/2013,"I used to enjoy this Chili's as it's convenient for a pre-movie dinner.  However, I had a terrible experience last night, and won't be back.  The place was not busy at all.  I ordered a weird combo of spicy sausage soup and garlic/parmesan sweet potato fries.  The waitress specifically asked if I wanted the regular side of sweet potato fries or the garlic/parmesan, and my answer was clearly the latter.  My friend ordered a chicken sandwich.  40 minutes after we'd arrived, we still didn't have our food, so I gave a look to the server, who said our food would be right up.  It wasn't.  Instead, about 10 minutes later, the waitress tells me she has bad news:  there's no more spicy sausage soup!  She brought my friend's chicken sandwich, and served me a regular side of sweet potatoes (NOT the garlic/parmesan I had ordered), and on top of that, they were cold!  Somehow the manager was able to bring me a bowl of the soup I had ordered-- on the house -- and he himself made me a new batch of fries.  When the bill came, the soup hadn't been deducted.  All in all, an absolutely aggravating and unpleasant meal. I will not go back!"
Iris G.,"Tucson, AZ",113,107,19,4.0,4/30/2008,"Chili's gets 4 stars because they are always reliable.  The same food, cheap prices, and decently speedy service.  I pretty much get one of three items whenever I go there - the chicken crispers meal, the buffalo chicken salad, or the chicken quesadilla.  (Anyone seeing a chicken theme?)  I like their chicken crispers because they're not like the traditional breaded and fried ones.  Tasty with hot sauce or honey mustard.  The rice and beans that come with the quesadilla are terrible though.  Way way too overseasoned with some spices I have yet to identify.  I don't think I want to though.  Haha.  If you're looking for cheap decent food in a quick amount of time, I'd say Chili's is your best bet."
Trisha T.,"Glendale, CA",48,327,11,3.0,2/28/2009,"I had a bad experience here tonight. The night started off well, we had call ahead seating and were seated immediately, rather than have to wait 45 minutes. For this I was very happy. I ordered my usual mango iced tea, but after a few sips it tasted just like water. I decided to gulp the rest down, hoping that the next mug would taste better. It didn't. I asked the waitress to bring me Strawberry Lemonade, which was thankfully much better. Then I ordered my meal, the country fried steak. On the menu, it comes with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and two sides. So when I first received my dish, it only had the mashed potatoes, corn, and the sides were MISSING. I asked the waitress to correct this, and when she brought it back, it had the two sides (which looked really unappetizing) but the corn and mashed potatoes were now MISSING. W.T.F....Also, my steak knife was missing. I was so irratated, but tried to keep my cool. It was very hard though, considering how frustrated I was. I mean, that's so simple, why was it f*cked up? Ugh!!! I wouldn't ever go to a major chain restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night again. I would have given it 2 stars if not for the quick seating."
Mony H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,53,,1.0,4/19/2009,"I went with a lady friend for a light meal (I made the dessert) one Sunday night and after 20 minutes, swore to never ever set foot in that place. The quality of food was below any expectation. The ribs were so dry that the meat would not come off. The broccoli was the color of dark olive, limp and tasteless. The insult came when while eating, our server came into the eating area with a broom and was sweeping the floor while people were eating. Then she propped the broom next to an unoccupied table, went to the kitchen and returned in 30 seconds with plates full of food. The 2 eldery ladies that recieved the food, complained and a young man with a tie came out to talk to them. He would not believe their story and left them in mid sentence."
Patricia J.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,26,,4.0,12/11/2009,"I don't get all the hate!  The food is pretty good IMO.  As a vegetarian, my options were pretty limited, but the super nice waitress suggested these off-menu vegetarian tacos, and they were rather good!  Oh, and the drinks are great.  I'd say they're better than TGI Friday's.  My electric lemonade was really good - really sweet and fruity with the right amount of alcohol.  It tasted like icee.  Then again, I never like it when the alcohol overpowers the flavor, so it's really a matter of taste I guess.  My friend ordered a Reggae something or other and that was good too.  What really made this a good experience, though, was the sweet waitress!"
Jennifer F.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,24,,4.0,1/11/2010,"I go to this Chili's often.. and the food is always good. I always come out of here stuffed! The margaritas are delicious. The service is good too, their waiters/waitresses are sooo nice and attentive."
