Dariush B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",3,18,,4.0,7/26/2017,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE FOOD! Great service fun for the kids and amazing pre portion food. This restaurant is great!
Kelly C.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",60,30,7,2.0,7/16/2017,"I came it to just place a Togo order. The sign in the ToGo counter said go to the bar. After waiting a few minutes the bartender, rudely, said, ""Did you need something?"" Then said to go to ToGo. The ToGo guy wasn't any nicer."
Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,1.0,9/29/2016,"Ok so this is crap. I've been stopping by Chilis for years now, drinking large mugs of Stella Artois, and making my contribution to the bartender's rent fund (at least Jordan and Seth, who are totally awesome), and I come in today - no Stella, and it's not coming back. They are replacing with all new ""local"" beers...great.  I don't have anything against the craft and local beer movement, and am happy to see so many more beer choices for people, but c'mon - the taps at Chilis will now be all craft selections, and Bud lite or Coors lite. Maybe they'll have a Mexican brew.  You gotta have already one mass produced, good quality Pilsner or lager, and I'm sorry but Bud lite and Coors lite are not even close to Stella, or Pilsner Urquell, or even a damn Heineken. Why don't we have Carlsberg on US taps, it's all over Europe?!  What about a nice Asahi or Sapporo, or even Kirin?! Or can we have some big bottles or cans? Fosters oil cans would be fine with me.  Shit.   So now I have to (1) go somewhere else or (2) drink Corona by the bottle.  So much for my happy hour - and Chilis, if you had any idea how much money I spend on beer in bars, particularly yours, you'd be putting the Stella back.  Shit."
Melanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,4,1.0,9/11/2017,"Where do I begin with this review, it was my daughter's birthday so we all decided to come to Chili's, big mistake we had a party of six 4 adults and 2 children the restaurant was not even busy, waited 45 minutes for our food, when the food arrived, my daughter had a pasta dish with shrimp, the shrimp was like ice, my son-in-law had a waffle with chicken which was lukewarm, Next To Arrive was my husband's fajitas where the chicken breast was raw and ice cold, Next To Arrive was the kids meal and my meal which was the ribs the sausage and the chicken the kids Meals were so so  nothing on my plate was even edible ribs were not even warm chicken was cold sausage was freezing, I asked to speak to a manager she asked if we wanted to have her make our food over again if we were willing to wait she said they would make it over I said we had already waited 45 minutes and got all the food cold they warmed up my daughter's food in the microwave made my husband a new chicken breast for his fajitas it came back the same way cold in the middle I ordered a hamburger by the time I got it everyone was finished eating, so I asked for it to go, there was a nasty film on the bottom of the glasses that we noticed after we drank our drinks hopefully we don't all get food poisoning as temperatures plays a big part in people getting sick I work in a restaurant, and this was totally unacceptable they should not be serving food like this"
Liz G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,46,28,1.0,10/15/2017,"Place is nice but food is very cheap and lack in taste. I don't like going there. More for kids, not for adults dates."
Christina R.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",26,2,,2.0,7/25/2017,"Horrible experience, food was awful... Had a fly in my ice tea. Would not recommend this restaurant...."
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,33,3,1.0,5/28/2017,Walked in here with a friend and was sat down at a table. Regular weekday not too busy. We sat there for twenty minutes and we weren't even offered water. We walked out and no one even stopped us. Worst service ever. The chilis on reseda has much better service than this on their busiest day.
Sugar L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,34,20,2.0,11/27/2016,"What happened to your happy hour menu???????? Used to be so good!! Now all the good items have been removed. No more chips and salsa for free???? Terrible !!!! Never come Again to any chillis . The one thing i enjoyed was chips and salsa on the house during happy hour. Please corporate, figure out your happy hour menu. This is just junk ! No more queso either? No half order wings on happy hour???? Just forget about this place. Bye!"
Isabella A.,"Studio City, CA",1,18,7,1.0,8/13/2016,"This has to be the worse chilis that I have ever been too. I used to work as a server at chilis many years ago and the customer service has gone way down. The only reason I still eat here is that it's the only one in my area and it's near my job. Every time, and I mean EVERY time, I order to go food here about an hour before I pick it up, it still takes me 30 to 45 minutes to actually get my food after arriving to the restaurant. Even when it's slow. And the worse part is that all the servers see you standing there waiting and they just stare with dumb looks on their face. By the time I get rung up and receive my food I've usually lost my appetite. Sigh, it's partially my fault because I keep going in hopes it'll get better it never does. And good luck to anyone who tries to use their chilis rewards points, the manager (a woman) insisted on arguing with me for 10 minutes before she realized I was correct and that you can use two rewards in one order.... This place is a joke."
Ernesto V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Ventura Blvd, Encino CA Very poor service. I placed my order and when out came out it was incorrect. Which is ok, I simply told him what it was supposed to be and he went back to the kitchen to fix it. Came back out and my order was wrong again! I explained to him what I wanted, which was SIMPLE. He then argued with me and was trying to tell me that I ordered something else. His attitude was deplorable as was very disrespectful. I asked for the manager and when he came out he was upset with me as if I did something wrong and asked me ""what's wrong with the order"" with a bad attitude. I told him what I ordered. The manager then tried to clarify what I ordered and it he repeated it incorrectly. At this point I'm wondering if it's me that's the problem. So I opened the menu, pointed at the menu at the pictures and said ""I want that, and this"". The manager got even more annoyed because I did that. He finally said ok. He went to the back and brought my food over, AND IT WAS INCOMPLETE AND WRONG AGAIN! Where is the disconnect? I have no clue, this never happened to me ever. Was this a prank? Tired and hungry, I told him what was missing and what was wrong. Finally those were corrected, fine,  time to eat. I pick up my corn and it's COLD! THEY GAVE ME OLD CORN THAT WAS BEYOND SITTING AROUND IN THE BACK. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO HEAT EMITTING FROM IT! What the heck is this? Then my rice? OH NO, THE SAME THING! I told the manager I was not paying for my food. He then responded with ""ill give you a discount"" like he was doing me a favor, and he said it in a very condescending manner. He repeated to me again that ""I'm gonna give you a discount, ok""? I looked at him like ""whatever"" and was prepared to pay my tab minus a $2 discount I thought he was gonna do for me. He actually didn't charge me for my meal which was honestly a surprise. Meanwhile this whole debacle was occurring our original waiter was walking around literally throwing a plastic tray into the air and spinning it into the air and trying to catch it when it came down. Needless to say, he didn't always catch it and it would just land and slap obnoxiously loud on the floor, the behavior of a 12 year old. I mean it, that waiter behaved so childish. Who plays with objects by throwing them high into the air in the dining area? Had it ever occurred to him that he could walk into someone, like another employee carrying food because he's looking up into the air and not where he's walking? Or it could land on a customer and hurt someone?  I've been coming here for years now and things happen, I get it. Mistakes happen and they get corrected, no biggy. It's cool. But this was down right terrible.  Judging by the way the waiter spoke, unable to listen, and playing in the dining area like a child (which was very very bizarre behaviour for an adult to have at work in front of other people) he's not prepared to work with the public yet, he had the mentality of a child still. The manager? Not very well spoken, sounds uneducated when he talks, doesn't listen well either, poor attitude, and clearly a bad example and leader for his team. What you permit is what you promote. I'm a loyal patron of Chilis and have been for years. I frequent all the time. In fact my friends and family sometimes give me gift cards to Chili's because they know I go there all the time. Sadly, the only Chili's around is the one on Ventura Blvd in Encino. I need to find somewhere else to go, which is sad because I feel like going right now lol. But I can't anymore  If anyone else had a similar experience here please post here. I will be contacting there headquarters as well.  Thank you."
Denis C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,10,2,1.0,6/11/2017,"This place, what can i say....EVERYTIME, and i mean EVERY time ive come, they have taken 30 or more mins to serye a TO-GO order placed online 15-20 mins before I even attempt to go there, and when I arrive, its a minimum of another 20 min wait. The online wait time says: no wait, but trust me, there always is. Keep in mind, people are ordering online to make the wait time less due to 30 min lunch breaks, and ive been late to returning to Work EACH time. The only reason i return is due to the location convenience to Work and the food is actually good. But seriously, every time the manager apologizes and says ""sorry, we are a bit understaffed""....after 2 years of coming here youd think thatd be resolved by now...."
Mermaid Bre G.,"Hollywood, CA",225,15,11,5.0,1/31/2017,Chilis keeps me coming back for the Full Rack of Ribs & the Patron Margaritas. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't been there before. Lots to choose from. Good prices for dates too.
Felicia S.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",0,20,12,1.0,6/16/2017,"Just awful! Went to lunch today and basically everything was inedible. First they brought coffee to the table and it was ice cold. The waitress begrudgingly made a fresh pot. Next they brought a ""potato"" soup that was a bowl of cream minus any potatoes. The house salad was ok. Next the turkey sandwich was like really bad lunch meat. I'm not even sure it was turkey, and the bread is indescribable. The fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. The waitress was almost nonexistent,  appeared to be not in a very good mood, and didn't even question why the food wasn't eaten. Doggy bag? No thank you! It's no surprise they were mostly empty at lunch hour."
Guylaine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",411,42,65,2.0,3/28/2017,Well happy hour at Chili's starts early like noon or earlier...this time I came in to pick up some food and the first thing you see is the huge bar from the side door. It'/ large and inviting could almost feel like Cheers  of the TV show but the vibe was totally off... that day ...except for the few ladies playing scrabble and a nearby table... and 1/2 dozen patrons having beers and cocktails. Kudos to girl bartender with lot of energy and very friendly while wearing many different hats...the male bartenders really slow. My eat in experience  little while ago was very good with plentiful fiesta platter type dish.. however take out  portions are really quite small and plain and not enough for the buck.
Y C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,1.0,6/9/2017,"And this is 'well done' burger at Chili's Encino, add insult to injury, waiter goes 'so sorry! I told the chef well done!' food was cold, thank you much, no more Chili's!!"
Angine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,2,,1.0,11/2/2016,They to go part is terrible. They say its ready in 5 minates and when you get there it is not ready another 30 minutes.  Totally dissatisfied
Ana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,28,5.0,9/4/2017,"This rating is specifically for NATHALIE! Most of the bad reviews are pretty accurate since I've been to this location before with less than pleasant experiences, until yesterday. Never have I received the service Nathalie gave us. She made our experience that much more perfect. Her attitude, her service, and her overall charisma are truly ONE OF A KIND! She did a superb job in making us feel welcomed, cared for, and just over all great! I have been to other restaurants and BY FAR she's been the best I've ever encountered. She is a GEM to this place!"
Molly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,42,47,5.0,9/23/2016,"A nice, no bull lunch experience.  Turkey California club - right on time.  Excellent service by Chad.  Cute interior.  Neat automated pay thingy.  Good music.  Will be back."
Michael M.,"Santa Monica, CA",77,12,2,5.0,10/21/2016,"Came her tonight on a double date. Was served by the most kind bubly personality, Chantelle. She was kind, friendly and had the memory of a jeopardy champion. She made our dinner an absolute pleasure. CHILLI'S take note and find more people like her!!! If u go there make sure to sit in Chantelle's section if u want the best service."
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,1/14/2017,We had Natalie for service and it couldn't be more pleasant she's such a dear and I can't wait to come back and be served by her again the food was good
