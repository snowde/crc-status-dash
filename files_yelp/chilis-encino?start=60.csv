K L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,3,1.0,3/18/2017,"I had the unfortunate opportunity to be served by Mina tonight. Ordered appetizer and food and she brought out the food before the appetizer. I ordered soup (comes with green onions) and it literally had two little slices of green onions. When I asked for more, it was obviously a huge inconvenience for her. Terrible server."
Michaelangelo P.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,15,3,5.0,3/16/2017,"Came to this location for maybe the 3rd time ever and now my fiancée and I are lifers. Coming from a food serving background, it is so refreshing to get great service. We had a server named Brent McGregor tonight and he was amazing. He brought our food out hot, he checked on us frequently and he was happy-go-lucky. Couldn't ask for a better experience. Thank you Brent. Chili's got it right tonight."
Lily L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,116,186,3.0,11/13/2015,"Three stars for the food four stars for the ambience. I mostly come to this place because I work nearby. As we all know Chili's is a franchise and as with most franchises the food can be lackluster. I did like their chicken wings they were very fresh kind of fast food like but still good.  I ordered a chicken salad which tasted alright, the chicken definitely has a prepackaged feel to it but I guess that's to be expected. They have hey touchpad machine that you used to pay. I don't know how I feel about it. Personally I prefer the old-fashioned way of the waiter/waitress's bringing the check but that's just me. This is a good place to come if you want to just kick back and hang out with friends but don't expect the quality of the food to be out of this world."
Mays E.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,172,284,4.0,10/22/2015,"To be honest, I've never had a bad experience, food is good, chips and salsa are amazing! Staff are nice. And I love the fact that after you're done eating you don't have to ask for check, you can use the little iPad /credit card machine to pay for your food and add tips...love it! It's like a self checkout , my kind of thing!  The only reason why I give 4 starts is because the alcohol quality is not good, but it's okay, I understand why!"
Candace B.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",195,279,2578,3.0,6/8/2015,"The food at this location is good, no complaints there but my server today needs a few pointers in addressing customers. He started off by saying, ""What can I get you girl?"" And went on during the service to call me honey, girlfriend and few other names. Miss or maybe asking my name would have been better. He was just extra and made me very uncomfortable. My boyfriend wAs buddy and few other names and then there were other things like him saying he ""went the extra mile"" to make sure there were no onions in my honeys tomatoes. Lastly, he asked if we wanted to join the rewards program and I told him we really don't come to Chili's that often and he said, make it a news years resolution and just go ahead and join. He was a little pushy and in our face. It was just too much. I heard him tell a couple sitting close by, when they refused joining the rewards program, ""oh it's just free money"" as he threw up his hands, shook his head and walked away. This guy just made us not want to return to this location but I don't want him to lose his job, thus I'm Not saying his name, but he should tone it down a bit and not be so forceful. That's all. The restroom was also a mess which if I hadn't already ordered, I would have left. A good friend told me, if the restroom is nasty, don't eat at the establishment."
Allan G.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,17,11,3.0,2/25/2017,"Came here for dinner with friends after the movies. The wait was less than quoted which was good. Service was mixed, orders were taken promptly, but the food took a long time to come. Also, the fries that were supposed to come with the burgers were delayed- we didn't get them until our food was half done. Definitely a mixed experience."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,5/5/2015,"I have been putting this review off for months, Chili's is as boring to Yelp about as it is to go to. That being said the in laws love Chili's and i love my husband, so I go and sit and wait to be able to leave. I have tried so many of their menu items and have to say I like none. The salads lackluster, the fish horrible quality, the apps greasy and straight out of a package. Prices are high for the quality, service is fine, but that typical chain restaurant vibe coming through is just a turn off. Everything here is catered to the masses, I either just taste salt, grease or fat, no flavor, no seasoning, no love, not worth a penny of my money."
Svatka P.,"Gilbert, AZ",127,49,312,1.0,3/28/2016,"I usually love chilis and their customer service, but this is the third time they managed to really screw up a simple online order.  I ordered the soup and salad combo, and specified for the salad no onions, croutons on the side, cheese on the side and extra cheese, with extra ranch. Meaning there should be a cup of croutons, two cups of ranch, and two cups of cheese for the salad. For the soup, I also asked for cheese on the side and extra cheese. So another two cups. I also order an extra soup, same way as above. I come to pick up my order, and look at it. Two soups stacked on top of a cup housing the croutons. Ok that's good. I look at the salad, IT IS COVERED IN ABOUT TWO POUNDS OF CHEESE. I saw that and asked the bartender that I ordered the cheese on the side for both soups and salad. He gave me a cup of cheese to take home. I get home and there's NO DRESSING FOR THE SALAD!! How do you manage to forget the ranch for a salad, and on top of that charge me extra for the extra one I wanted and not give it to me. I give up on this location. They've screwed up take out orders three times in a row now. Clearly they need to be retrained on how to READ AN ORDER. Management doesn't even care as I never even see one around. Sooooo disappointed. Take the extra drive and go to a different location. This one sucks. Period. You lost a customer who's been coming here for years. Thanks chilis."
Yung R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,11/1/2016,"This place is complete trash, my family and i drove from hollywood to come here. The experience was garbage the food took long and to top it off we had requested a happy bday song for our friend when i asked the server if  they do these type of things she said yes. 1 hour passed by and nothing we were already leaving and I confronted the host whom I previously asked and told her what had happened ? her response oh sorry we forgot. really? never again will I come here wasted my time and the food was bad. stay away !!!!"
Amir E.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,6,4,1.0,3/27/2016,Soooooo bad! I am surprised by employees ! They dont know how to speak! How to sit costumers on the tables!! I wish  i could  to give zero star!! All the things was Over SALTY!!! Triple dipper was awfull. We was five people that our meals was terirble.
Dhiren K.,"Glendale, CA",15,23,130,5.0,6/2/2016,Best drinks - really delicious decent portion of entrees - nice fast friendly servers - Everything five stars from Margaritas to skillet chocolate chips cookies   - n yeah good luck with Parking.
Jennica R.,"West Hollywood, CA",661,118,2839,3.0,3/30/2015,"Since my boyfriend was craving Chicken Crispers one weekend, we found ourselves heading to Encino just to hit up Chili's since franchises aren't too common around our Hollywood area.  LOCATION & PARKING Located on Ventura Blvd. on the Valley's Miracle Mile Encino Commons in a plaza called Encino Town Center. Personal parking lot next to Chili's but parking is also available in the surrounding lots in the plaza.  AMBIANCE & SETTING Super casual spot great for a casual date night or group outings with family or friends. Plenty of booths and seating areas. Very clean, well lit, and well-maintained. Average noise level making conversation with others possible. Several TVs throughout the restaurant and at the bar. Ziosks are on every table to make ordering food/drinks and paying the bill more convenient and efficient.  CUSTOMER SERVICE Came in for a super late lunch in the afternoon and was seated immediately by the friendly hostess. We ordered the Dinner for 2, which included an appetizer and 2 main Entree dishes. Service from our waitress could have been better cuz she forgot our Appetizer, which didn't come until AFTER our main entrees. And she didn't bother refilling our waters and only asked when it was clear that we were finished with our meal and ready for the check. My boyfriend didn't wanna bother waiting for the waitress to bring us a check, so we paid using the Ziosk.  FOOD Honestly, we really only come here for the Crispy Chicken Crispers. The other food items are alright, but not that great. If you go with your significant other, spouse, or friend, I recommend the ""Dinner for 2"" Menu for around $20 cuz you get one Appetizer and choice of 2 Main Entrees. We were SO hungry, we also got a side salad that was surprisingly huge!  Side House Salad - Fresh lettuce, carrots, tomato, cucumber, red onion, cheddar cheese, and croutons with a side of dressing of your choice. Big portion, light and healthy, and delicious! - GET IT!  Appetizer: Panko Breaded Onion Rings - Onion rings battered with panko bread crumbs. Soft, juicy onions inside and cooked nice and crispy on the outside! - GET IT!  Crispy Chicken Crispers - 5-6 pieces of Crispy Chicken with a side of Ranch sauce and paired with your choice of 2 side items. My boyfriend went with Loaded Mashed Potatoes and a side of Steamed Asparagus with tomatoes. - TRY IT!  Honey Chipotle Crispy Chicken Crispers - Waitress claims it's spicy, but it really isn't! This is my Usual every time I visit Chili's. Basically it's Chicken Crispers covered in delicious Honey Chipotle sauce with a side of Ranch dressing paired with 2 side items, which are usually French Fries and Corn on the Cob unless you'd like to switch them out. So. Damn. Good. - GET IT NOW! Overall, the service could improve on bringing out food in an appropriate sequence and in a timely manner. But those Crispy Chicken Crispers are really the ONLY reason we return to Chili's every now and then. Otherwise, we probably wouldn't come back!"
Amy M.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/14/2016,"Shaunte is the BEST! My coworkers and I come here every Thursday and always feel welcome.  Come for the $5 El Presidenté margs, stay for the incredible service."
Karen B.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",58,9,,1.0,7/10/2017,"Have you tried the new Shoe-Leather Fajitas?  Really expensive, and inedible.  This is the first time in a long time that I actually questioned whether what I was eating was actually beef, and I've been to Thailand."
Mr B.,"Hollywood, CA",172,107,183,4.0,11/12/2016,"It's not bad, I don't love chillis in general, it's all about their chips. I've never had rude staff or upselling here.  Good location, always seating available. Loose one star for parking"
Eli C.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,19,4,1.0,1/24/2016,"Bartender. Brunette wearing Cowboys #88 Dez Bryant Jersey on 1/24/2016. AWFUL!! Would be a compliment.. Took my beer order after 5min of looking at me. Seemed upset I sat in this chair (more on that later). Gave me my beer in chipped glass.. has not talked to me since. She texted while In tried to get attention to Order Chips and Queso. Man walks in sits next to me, she greets him asks what he wants: ""water"" double shot of vodka and tonic for this guy. Obviously her bf or friend.. I ask her for chips and Queso when she comes over to chat more with him. Since.. this guy has received chips, guac and salsa and just now got his food.  Bartender still not looked at me and still waiting for my food.  4:42pm on 1/24.. Guess you need to personally involved to get attention here.  Still waiting..."
Francesca P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,5/29/2017,"Me and my boyfriend come here frequently. We both work in the food industry, so we know how restaurants operate. We respect and appreciate what servers, bartenders, chefs, and the rest of the crew do. We can confidently say that we have NEVER had a bad experience at this Chilis. The service has always been incredible. The food is always fresh, the hosts are always kind and courteous, and the place is always clean. Props to the manager for hiring a good crew. We'll be back for some of that kick ass queso and chicken enchilada soup."
Rudy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,44,42,1.0,5/10/2017,"Been coming here for over 10 years but tonight sucked, more than usual. It's been a slow and steady decline at this Chili's. Completely understaffed. Food was literally inedible. Not to mention they ran out of asparagus in the steak, shrimp and asparagus plate. Shrimp was cold and undercooked - ugh! My medium rare steak was like cutting into leather and WAY undercooked. Waited almost 20 minutes for another glass of wine even using that hokey iPad ordering gizmo. For the first time ever I sent the food back and didn't want anything else. The last time we were here the food was so over salty and cold. We thought we'd give them another try. Nope. It's Wednesday. I wonder how bad it sucks here on the weekend. Regardless of the miserable experience our waiter was great and did the best he could. Moving on and never coming back here again. Sad, cuz this was the place I had my first date with my partner back in 2005.  *sigh*"
Elisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,41,20,5.0,9/29/2016,"Tried the Guacamole Black Bean Burger and it was delicious!!! Great flavor with just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. The french fries were good too, although it was a smaller portion that I'd like and they were a bit too soft for my liking. But, overall, satisfying and flavorful food! I had this meal delivered to me as part of a special promotion and I am happy to now know that Chili's offers a satisfying vegetarian burger. I'm sure the staff was extremely busy today with all of the promotion orders....Thanks for the hustle!"
Guero Y.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/6/2017,"Nataly was our bartender. We have been there a few times but she was the most helpful and friendly bartender we have come across. She put the game on the big tv in the middle and turned up the sound; we had awesome drinks and a great deal on a 3 course meal as advertised on tv, plus happy hour specials. Was a great evening."
