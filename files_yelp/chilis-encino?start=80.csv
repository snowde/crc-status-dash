Lindsey S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,16,4,5.0,10/20/2016,I placed a pretty big order online right at 11:00am and by the time I got there (11:30ish) it was already ready! I was not expecting that at all AND everything was right on there side (not so much my side oops) But great job to this staff at this location. Not big talkers but super accommodating and awesome! Thank you!
D M.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/25/2017,Really disappointing. Boneless chicken was so over cooked and dry that a steak knife wouldn't go through and I sent them back. The chicken quesadilla was also over cooked and not alot of chicken to speak of. Waitress was nice but very young. Waited more than 5 minutes for someone to notice I was waiting for a table.
Vince S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,4,,5.0,11/14/2016,"Great food, and great prices! Would recommend to my friends! Would come here again anytime, loved it!"
Valentina L.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",2530,705,2664,3.0,11/3/2014,"November 1, 2014 This is not normally a place I frequent, but when friends want to go, you have to go. SO hence, (cough!) I did. I had the MARGHERITA FLATBREAD with AOILI sauce, and shocker...it was really flavorful and well made! KUDOS! Server was cute and very friendly!"
Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,352,317,3.0,3/14/2015,"I've only been here for lunch. This last time was on a week day, when it was medium busy. Our waiter was nice but service is slow.  Their Southwestern egg rolls are delicious, if you want to splurge on calories. There's a good lunch special menu. You choose 2 items for $6, 7 or $8.  I had the Southwestern corn soup and Margherita flat bread pizza.  The soup was a little salty and had mushy chickpeas that I removed. It was only good because of the tortilla strips. My flat bread tasted weird, too tangy and creamy thick (there's more than a ""drizzle"" of cilantro-ranch pesto happening there!). It needed some heat or salt for more balance. It was also overbaked. My friend got a house salad and double patty burger with fries. She liked the salad (good Ranch dressing) but the fries tasted weird as if the oil was bad.  You can pay at table on a tablet but it only divides the check evenly.  I think the best part of my meal was having tv's everywhere on ESPN. I got caught up on the NFL free agency!"
Terri L.,"Burbank, CA",19,12,3,2.0,5/13/2017,"Food was okay.  Had to send back the kids macaroni and cheese, it looked old and reheated was a clumpy mess.  Ordered house salads that were good.  Service was terrible though.  Took forever took get someone to refill drinks and bring items.  There were not very busy when we got there, so really not an excuse for poor service."
Jones B.,"Gardena, CA",0,13,4,2.0,1/2/2016,"Food is mediocre , waitress  was great! drinks are watered down, I had to ask if they forgot to put the alcohol in their premium platinum president margarita, they brought me another one and it's the same. I have had this drink at other chili's locations and it's not supposed to be watered down. Restroom a mess There is a reason it's pretty empty for a Saturday  evening."
Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,4.0,11/8/2016,"Colorful local bar that takes its inspiration from an earlier period of time. They have booths, bar stools, tables, and an outside dining area. Plenty of options on the menu for food and drink, but true craft beer connoisseurs may find the tap collection a little lacking. The location makes it a good stop with friends before or after an event at nearby locations."
Michael P.,"Agoura Hills, CA",10,47,3,5.0,8/23/2016,"A BIG shout out to server 'Jay'--she was so accommodating,friendly, and warm! She even acted as the 'hostess' when I  came in and welcomed me with a 1,000 watt smile. Jay is a true ambassador for Chili's and is better skilled at customer service than MANY personnel at 5 star restaurants I have tried--the food(fajitas)was prepared perfectly and Jay must have checked in with us 1/2 dozen times to ensure that we were happy....and we were, She's a winner and so is this outpost--I will be back  :Jay deserves to be recognized for an exemplary work ethic and positive attitude!"
P H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,2.0,9/30/2016,"The service was bad, and it almost seemed that the waiter was not interested. This place seems run down, the food took too long, and was mediocre at best. We were glad to get out of there.."
Sindy C.,"Camarillo, CA",26,6,1,1.0,4/7/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I ordered the 2 for $22. My cousin ordered a tall lagunitas. My cousin took a couple sips of the beer so you can say it was 1 inch or so below the top of the glass. Our salads came and I happen to run my fingers on the bottom of the plate. It was bumpy so I picked it up to look at the bottom. Seriously, it looked green and gray with food scum. But mistakes happen, so it didn't really bother me. I picked up my cousins plate and low and behold, her plate looked even worst than mine. My stomach rolled. I called one of the servers and he was super nice and said he'd take care of it. honestly, no way I was going to stay there. I was waiting for someone to come by so as not to rudely walk away. I finally flag down our server and told her what happened and told her I'd not stay and to cancel our order. She was very nice and said ok. As I was walking away, another waitress, not ours, called back and asked me about the beer, as in, ""but what about the beer!"" Wtf? How dare you expect me to pay for a beer she'd only taken a sip of!!! And at this point I'm so annoyed that I'm of a mind to call the health department!"
Lessly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,5.0,3/18/2016,"We had the Citrus Avocado Sirloin Steak with grilled asparagus, grilled cherry tomatoes and garlic. It was delicious. Our server Nat was very attentive and amicable. Definitely will be returning."
Becky N.,"Tarzana, CA",1,39,6,1.0,5/22/2016,Turn down your music!!!! The concept that corporate determines how loud..is such BS.
Ynot S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",173,45,47,5.0,2/22/2016,"I have not been to this place in years, but i can tell you that after my experience I will be back!!!! We had a screening at the theater  and a lot of us decided  to  go  there after my encounter  with Jordan the bartender. She honestly is what customer service should be!!! Thank you Jordan and see you soon!"
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,12,5.0,10/14/2016,"I called to place an order for pick up and the lady who took my order, Christina, did such a great job! Her customer service was excellent, she was very sweet and helpful. The food was great as well :) such a great location!!"
Kathie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,42,64,5.0,11/6/2014,Every time I eat at this Chilis I have a good experience. The Sports bar is great and I got fantastic service from Jenna :)  Thank you!!!!! Dinner is always good and I have fun watching sports here
TEK Z.,"Marina del Rey, CA",2,38,5,5.0,7/3/2016,"Great place, big feed, reliable, cheap. Extra star for Natalie, great server!! Will be back plenty of times."
Jennifer B.,"Burbank, CA",8,3,,5.0,6/14/2016,"Our server Chris was in his first week serving after working 5 years in the kitchen, HE WAS AMAZING. I've only ever got okay service here, but Chris definitely raised the bar I'll be coming back often as long as I can sit in his section."
Forevermemorable F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,496,1497,3.0,9/18/2014,"My family and I ate here during the weekday and the place was half full.  After we placed our order, we waited at least 30 minutes for our food to arrive at our table.  That is a long wait for a Chili's or any restaurant for that matter. When I got up and inquired about the delay, I was told that that problem was either a cook being on break or them being short handed, with only one cook on hand.  Of course I wasn't given a definite answer, but the delay was miserable. The food was good though...the wait sucks!  If I knew the wait was going to be so long, I would have gone somewhere else!"
Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,5,4.0,8/15/2016,"I love Chili's! I used to go to this restaurant very often when I lived in Syracuse, NY, and I was so excited when I found out they had on in Encino! I've been there twice so far, and it was great. The second time the service was a little slower, but it probably was due to the fact that it was a Saturday evening. They also added a practical iPad paying device at every table. If you are paying with a credit card you can request the check and pay directly from the tablet, so you don't have to wait for the waiter to do everything for you. Definitely a nice update! The only ""negative"" aspect of my last visit is that the chicken I ordered was a little too smothered in garlic, and it didn't sit well on my stomach. Other than that, I am definitely pleased with the restaurant and the service, and I will certainly be returning soon!"
