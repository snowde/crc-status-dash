Rachel G.,"Uptown, Chicago, IL",6,3,,5.0,1/10/2018,I really love this place! The food is good and service too! I have tried some plates and my favorite is Nachos with chicken!!
Cass K.,"Chicago, IL",6,67,136,3.0,10/23/2017,"don't get me wrong - i love chili's - i truly do, but i think most chili's are going to get a 3 star rating because the food isn't always that great. i'd honestly probably bump it up to a 3.5 if i was able to. i've been to this chili's multiple times, and i have to say this was the only time i was slightly disappointed in the quality of the food. i also came on a friday night, which i definitely have never done before! it was crowded. i did diverge from my typical path of a burger, and got the 10 oz sirloin steak that came with roasted corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes. i ordered my steak medium and it came very overdone. it was hard to eat and very chewy. i had trouble even cutting the steak; my bad for getting a steak from a chili's. the loaded mashed potatoes were plastic-y and very weird - it almost looked like they streched like those slime videos. my boyfriend got the ""honey-chipotle crispers and waffles."" the crispers were topped with applewood smoked bacon, jalapenos, and drizzled with ancho-chile ranch. my boyfriend said that the waffle was good, but everything else was pretty awful. the ancho-chile ranch sauce was tacky and tasted poor.  atmosphere is the usual; it was extremely crowded due to the day of the week [friday]. they seemed definitely understaffed, which isn't the servers faults. they were all very busy and running around. hopefully their management will help them by putting more people on the floor on a friday night! our server was very nice, but not very attentive because she was busy. i do like the ziosks because they allow you to order dessert and pay quickly without having to wait. overall, it's chili's. it doesn't have a bad reputation, but it is what it is. in the past i've gotten their tex-mex food which is always usually good, and also their burgers. if i go back, i'll avoid the steak."
Jonnathan J.,"Saint Louis, MO",80,106,219,5.0,3/19/2017,"This place is awesome! Tasty food, great portion and prices that won't break the bank. They have several promotions (usually for 2)... The last time I went there we had one of those that included appetizer (one), entrees (two), margaritas (two) which were amazing plus I refilled my glass like 2 times and dessert (one).  Honestly I can't remember the price exactly but I'm pretty sure it was less than $40. And we were soo full!. Really full!. Everything was fantastic (as every time we've been there). Totally recommended and I'll definitely be back."
Sunny K.,"Chicago, IL",471,247,371,2.0,7/23/2016,"Friends and I came here for 4th of July dinner and boy was it a mistake. The service was awful, they only had one poor guy waiting on 15 tables and we waited 30+ minutes to get the bill. The food is ok, I mean it's chilis for goodness sakes! The guacamole and chips were disappointing as were the fried cheese curds. The fried pickles were interesting but only to try, not really to eat. They've got a good mango chicken going on though...."
Bnaya S.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,,3.0,9/23/2017,"Came in during the winter and was surprised at the temperature given the Chili pepper at the entrance (joke obviously, hubby laughing now- now hubby still laughing. update: hubby pittering out laughter but still thinking original sentiment is getting him restarted. Hubby now full laughing again. Hubby choking on saliva, coughing. Hubby ok now back to laugh laugh hubby). To be honest, I'm form Philly - which if you know if the land of really meaty chili. This place doesnt compare, in fact silly, when compared to Philly style chili really really served with pickle dilly."
Emily T.,"Skokie, IL",0,3,,1.0,11/19/2017,Usually love chilis and have no complaints but will definitely not be returning to the Evanston location. Just wanted to go for a simple appetizer but we waited for at least 15 minutes for a server. No one approached us we had to get the attention of another server who stated she would grab our server and then we continued to wait. Finally had enough and just left. I'm usually super understanding of busy servers but the place was dead. If I could give less than one star I would.
Mari M.,"Evanston, IL",21,3,1,2.0,9/17/2017,This is not good as people say at least in this location.. The pickle frieds I ordered as an appetizer seemed as I was eating Kentucky chicken and by the way really salty actually all the food was salty way out of it.. The price there is not even worth it just ordered a chicken sandwich and a hamburger for 43 dollars is not worth it...
Raul T.,"Chicago, IL",40,58,,3.0,6/4/2017,"I frequent Chilis for an affordable, tasty meal with no pretention.  Sadly, I received nothing but pretention from a young group of high school girls when I was there.  The even had the nerve to pose for selfies in front of me when I was eating my Chili.  I just wanted to eat in peace!  The food was ok though.  The bottomless chips are a great deal.  Pro Tip:  Bring a empty tostitos bag and fill it with the chips to bring home.   Salsa can go in a Ziploc."
Patty H.,"Evanston, IL",108,122,164,2.0,11/20/2016,"Scene: Friday evening, post movie. Not too crowded. My husband and I are seated in a booth. -- 5 minutes goes by -- A nearby server stops by our table and notifies us that our actual server is ""tied up"" and he'll get our drinks. (Thanks, friend!)    -- 15 minutes goes by (at a minimum, quite possibly more, we had to estimate based on the time stamp on a text I sent sometime after we got our drinks) -- We flag down the server who seems to be helping all the other tables in our section. Me: Excuse me, Hi, m'am. Are you our server? Server: No. (Blank stare.) Me: Um, okay. Do you know who is? Server: ... Me: Because, it has been a while and nobody has come by to take our order. Server: Oooh, yeah, I'm your server. No apologies. (As a former server, this is suuuper surprising to me.)  We try to be good sports and go ahead place our orders. We also ask for refills on the drinks that we emptied during our wait. Server completely disappears. When she returns with our food, we remind her about the drinks. Again, she disappears. Never checks on us, never brings the drinks. My husband thinks something is missing from his wimpy steak plate. He says it feels a little ""low carb"" to him, lol. We consult the menu and he is right -- the fries are missing. We'd love to let the server know, but again, she is nowhere to be found.  By this point, we're done with our food. It's not worth it to wait around for some fries to eat alone. We really just want to leave. We pay our bill (using the tablet at the tables, because -- surprise! -- waitress never actually came back!)  Sigh."
Santiago P.,"Chicago, IL",9,12,10,3.0,2/20/2017,"Telling the client that it will cost $1.90 for the girl to play with the tablet is distasteful, they are ways u can charge it without being intrusive. Regardless we do appreciate the attention that was given to the child that was on our table. She was served first( we love the attention for detail)    As first timers to chili we didn't know what sauce were spicy. That as a heads up is important"
Ashli D.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",16,11,2,5.0,11/1/2016,"Sometimes you think a chain restaurant isn't as good as a bar-only place to have fun or watch a game, however this place is great! Great location, parking garage and street parking nearby, walkable from the train, great service, great food with there updated menu (only thing I'd appreciate that Chili's would do is add tofu to the menu - annoying vegetarian here) and fun atmosphere! I always have good experiences here."
Sherwin C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",534,910,13465,3.0,11/20/2015,"Average for a Chili's. Prices are alright, although a bit high if not ordering a special meal combo. Food tends to be a bit on the salty side and a bit oversauced but this typical of the dishes offered on the menu. Service is friendly, although the food does take a while to come out. Portion sizes are alright for the price, enough to be filling but not overly generous on higher priced items. An alright place to stop by if you want to watch some sports and have a drink but not really a good value for the food."
Maria K.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Gross, overpriced food!! It used to be a reliable and fun chain and today I was served soggy lettuce drenched in disgusting dressing. Tasted awful and looked sloppy. I has literally three bites. No thanks. Never again.   (As bad as Applebee's maybe worse)"
Tavi J.,"Chicago, IL",458,779,1663,5.0,10/6/2014,"As much as it saddens me to give 5 stars to a chain resturant....I must. I use to go to Chili's all the time until I moved downtown and started shunning chain resturants. This pass weekend I went out to the burbs to visit my mom and we ate at Chili's after seeing a movie and it definitely curb my hunger and was delicious.  I use to always order the Blackend Cajun Chicken sandwich, but notice it wasn't on the menu anymore (they were still willing to make it). I ended up going with the guacamole turkey burger and it was delicious. The guacomle tasted better than some Mexican resturants I go to and the turkey burger was cook perfectly. The season fries that come on the side is probably the number one reason I love Chilis. Finish up with a strawberry lemonaid and you have a perfect meal. I didn't save room for dessert, but the next time I go back that skillet cookie is calling my name."
Jimmy Z.,"Evanston, IL",64,78,11,5.0,1/6/2017,This is the nice cozy place downstairs if you don't want to cook your own meal. Friendly people and decent food as always. Signature wings is a must have.
Veronica T.,"Chicago, IL",42,100,89,3.0,5/27/2016,It was busy being graduate day. But our waitor tried his best. Although we always had empty glasses. And had to ask for refills. Did not ask what size steak we wanted with meal which would of been extra money. Because two out of group would of upgraded.  Took forever to get check and to go boxes.
Dr. M.,"Washington, DC",7,150,30,2.0,11/12/2016,"This is possibly one of the worst Chili's I've visited.  I don't like to dine at Chili's, but there was no where to eat in the area. After I was seated, I waited & waited and no server came.  I had to request a server and someone came over, and was very apologetic about the absence of a server. When our server finally appeared, she informed me that she had a big party - thus, had to neglect my table. However, the meal was quickly served...like warm. Chili's will never be a favorite of mine, just doesn't measure up..."
V S.,"Cary, IL",0,11,8,5.0,5/6/2017,"My first visit to this Chilis and I wasn't disappointed. Everything was great from the initial greeting, seating, service, food and exit. One of the best Chilis I've visited."
Scottys Boxing C.,"Peoria Heights, IL",2,60,130,5.0,3/31/2016,Have eaten here several times over the years while attending classes at Northwestern.  Great food and service and the place is well maintained.  Some Chillis locations are hit and miss but this location is always a great choice.
Steve D.,"Evanston, IL",0,13,22,3.0,1/22/2015,"It's a Chili's. Go if you like Chili's. Don't go if you don't like Chili's. You'll get bad waitstaff, you'll get good waitstaff. Because it's a Chili's. You'll get good managers and bad managers. Because it's a Chili's. There can occasionally be an oversight in cleaning. Like any Chili's. The food is Chili's food. It comes on a truck and is heated up on site. Like all Chili's. The drinks are Chili's drinks. They're made the same everywhere. Go if you want a familiar and decent meal before or after a movie. Or for a work lunch. Or a just a quick burger. Don't go is if you need to righteously rage in the face of all things ""chain"" and thus vile and evil. In summation: It's a Chili's."
David G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/18/2016,"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Firstly, the service was unfriendly and bordered on rude. A friend of mine who mentioned a severe food allergy was given a dirty look by his server, delegitimizing his grave condition. Then, the food was vile and overpriced. Unless you are in a family or group where everybody likes very specific, very different foods, I could not understand why you would visit chilis. The tacos were gross, the hamburgers tasted like hockey pucks, and the flatbread was soggy. If you can't make any of these 3 very different foods right, why not focus on making one thing semi-edible? Our water was never refilled, and as the meal neared the 2 hour mark at this ""casual dining establishment,"" we finally received our checks.  This was where the meal hit its low point. In our party, half of the members received their checks, while the other half was told that the credit card machine had malfunctioned. Over the next 40 minutes, we were continually told that the machine was broken, without any consideration for the amount of time that it was taking to process the checks. We were not offered any water during this time, nor did we receive any type of discount or apology for their poor service. Once the meal finished, my group and I concluded: we will never visit another Chili's establishment as long as we live!"
Sei U.,"Evanston, IL",209,18,22,5.0,5/14/2016,The 2 for $20 deal is worth it. Being able to pay the check on your own time or instantly is very convenient.
Dan B.,"Evanston, IL",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2015,"My friend and I ordered a burger and fries. After 45 minutes, our server came and told us that our food was given to another table. We finally got our food after a hour of waiting.  The manager didn't even come over to apologize. Chillies just lost our business and we regularly went there."
Daniel D.,"Chicago, IL",15,17,,3.0,3/26/2016,"Well, to be nice and not say too much, my boyfriend and I had a terrible experience with a particular server, but we asked to speak to the manager, Spencer, who was very kind and made everything right for us. When I go back (which I probably will, it's a really convenient location when you're going to a movie) I'll probably ask for a different server. Oh, the chicken bacon avocado sandwich is delicious :)"
Clarence K.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,6,4.0,9/18/2016,Decent food. What you would expect out a chain restaurant. The prices are good too.
Brandon B.,"West Des Moines, IA",4,19,4,2.0,2/26/2015,"I think the food here is fine. It's standard for a Chili's restaurant.  The service needs work. Sometimes I go and they do an average job, but other times they mess up orders, forget about you, take forever to take orders, etc.  It really just depends who is working and the manager on duty. So, if you like Chili's go ahead and eat here. The food is fine. Just be prepared for a crapshoot on service."
Amy H.,"Chicago, IL",17,12,,5.0,12/29/2015,"I am writing this review on behalf of my 6 year old daughter....this is her favorite restaurant.  Maybe it is because of their games she can play while waiting, or the food...but she loves the staff there as well.  She has her favorite waiter, Jake (who moved here from Hawaii), who always stops to say hi to her even if we are not in his section.  The staff is very attentive and the food is always consistent.  They have kids eat for free on Tuesdays...which is a huge plus!"
Bri V.,"Chicago, IL",2,41,3,5.0,11/27/2015,"Came here Thurs the 12th. First I'd like to say I was on crutches and a nice taller guy with long hair (server? Host? Busses? I don't know) went out of his way to get both doors for me n came out to the corner, where my friends n I were waiting to cross the street to go to the parking garage, n brought my one friends food because she had forgotten it on the table, so 5 stars for that guy! Food was good, I got ribs, my friend got salad, n my other friend got chicken fingers. Our waitress accidentally had one of my friends chicken fingers slip off the plate while serving, we've both been servers, we get it n weren't mad, but she brought out another one for her in like 5mins. Overall good meals n good service, I'm not a huge chilli's fan but I'd go back"
Jonathan F.,"Skokie, IL",17,2,6,5.0,7/16/2014,"Great experience!   Great food, great service love coming to this place.  Ordered a triple dipper, egg rolls, southern smokehouse burger, old timer burger with fresh avocado.  Chips and salsa and queso.  Their queso is the shhhhh!!  Highly recommend checking it out.  Also their frozen strawberry margaritas are phenomenal!"
Anas F.,"Skokie, IL",19,27,26,5.0,6/18/2015,"I don't know why ppl are complaining about this place. I've been there for more than 10 times. I've never had an issue with this place. Customer service is good, food is good, they don't take long even on a Saturday night. I will keep going there."
Joy H.,"Melrose Park, IL",99,100,33,4.0,7/17/2014,"Came in on a whim and was happy I did. Excellent margaritas, guac and nice spicy Santa Fe Chicken Salad . The manager Ralph even came over and chatted for a few minutes about the service. Bartender was quick and really friendly, too. I'd come back with a group of friends or family anytime."
Channy F.,"Chicago, IL",24,43,20,5.0,6/9/2014,"I had a very good experience tonight. I've been here several times but tonight made me want to do a review. First of all the service was good, I live for good service...our waiter Riley was very attentive and helpful. The new mexican food menu was pretty cool and I really enjoyed the options they had. I was a little hesitant but the food was seasoned to perfection and the presentation was very good. My watermelon margaritas (yes plural, don't judge me) were sooooo yummy. The food was just great."
Alain G.,"Evanston, IL",0,28,,1.0,2/9/2016,"Worst experience in years! Ordered chicken crispers yesterday for lunch, it was slimy, uncooked, under-cooked? When i told the waiter he ignored what i said and just brought me the check. I thought there is no manager or owner doing his/her job here. I would fire this supervisor on the spot, and Chili's should restructure this well placed restaurant."
Jim H.,"Chicago, IL",6,19,,1.0,4/4/2015,"I came here with a large group and in spite of the advance notice, things really hit the fan. I waited over an hour for my food because the waiter's assistants kept giving food to people out of order from when they ordered.  I finally got my food after the majority of my group had left and it was good. I won't deny that I liked it. The waiter told me that my burger was free, so I asked for a free cookie instead since the group was paying for my meal.    I never got my cookie. I waited and finally tracked down my waiter and he told me I wasn't getting a cookie. The manager refused to do a free cookie instead of a free burger and they decided not to bring me a cookie. I had to argue with the manager about getting a cookie at all and was told it would be another 10 minutes.  I left because I'd already wasted so much time there.  Moral of the story: do not come here with more than a few people. They can't handle it."
Dawn C.,"Palatine, IL",2,9,11,3.0,6/21/2014,"Always great service if you ask for Tabitha. If she's not available, ask for Riley.  They're helpful, friendly and will make your night. Can't go wrong with one of their good-sized margaritas and guacamole."
Katie D.,"Somerville, MA",185,15,1,1.0,6/30/2015,Don't come in by yourself or you will be ignored.  Had to ask for food 3 times and I still have nothing.... Not anticipating this experience to get any better.  Avoid the bar.
Desiree M.,"Evanston, IL",57,4,3,1.0,1/18/2015,"This it's the most Un-sanitary chilies I have ever been to. Every single time I've gone there, the utensils had old food stuck onto them. The very last time I went to this location I found a hair in my food. The manager and employee were barely apologetic. Needless to say I wouldn't eat at this location even if they offered me free food."
Luna R.,"Evanston, IL",68,3,,5.0,6/8/2015,"Today was my first time visiting Chilis. My boyfriend had been before, but I hadn't. The experience was wonderful! I ordered a Caribbean salad with chicken, and it was delicious. Great balance of ingredients. But what really made the meal special was the amazing waitress we had. Her name was Ashley. She was very kind and personable. She single-handedly made my Chili's experience amazing. Restaurants should hire more people like Ashley :) the atmosphere, staff, and food at this Chili's were truly outstanding. I would certainly recommend this Chili's to my friends and family. Keep up the good work, Chili's."
Cobra L.,"Evanston, IL",3,8,,3.0,8/23/2013,"I brought my wife here for our 25th anniversary, and we both agreed that we were unimpressed by the food and the service.  I got the steak fajitas, but asked for the tomato on the side.  Well wouldn't you guess what showed up on my steak fajitas?  Tomatoes.  What a sick joke.  My wife ordered chicken tenders - she has horrible taste in food.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Ultimately, 14 out of a possible 27 because the bottomless chips. -Ross"
Kevin M.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",8,14,,3.0,1/11/2015,"The food actually was pretty good. But, the service was awful. The restaurant was dead, yet our waitress was nowhere to be found for the entire time we were there. We told the waitress that we both have a dairy allergy, she proceeded to bring us an appetizer and salad that had cheese on it. They have an electronic ""ziosk"" on the table where you can request the server and pay the bill. It took the waitress 15-20 min to come to our table after pushing that ""ask for the server"" button. She also put my meal twice on the bill."
