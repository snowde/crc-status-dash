Alex W.,"New York, NY",272,12,,5.0,7/9/2007,"This is a great place to go with large groups.  On a Saturday night there is nothing better than going with all your friends.  Start with the bottomless chips and salsa, and the $3 margaritas (the other drinks are way more expensive).  There is something for everyone, pasta, burgers, salads, chicken crispers, and much more.  With reasonable prices and an ever-expanding menu Chili's is one chain restaurant that I enjoy every time."
Ramon R.,"Evanston, IL",3,225,281,3.0,7/25/2005,"Don't order the strawberry lemonade or the sugarcane shrimp.  They're chores to drink and eat.  Presumably, if you're going to this restaurant, you like spicy food.  I don't...  hence, I didn't enjoy it.  But if you do, Chili's is the place to go."
Clare K.,"Chicago, IL",19,256,,2.0,1/22/2008,i sort of forgot that chili's is sort of gross.  living in the city for so long has spoiled me.  i had a giftcard to burn that i should have tried to use at maggiano's (i don't think they take chili's cards anymore).  it always peeves me that the chips and salsa aren't free...and the salads SUCK.  do not want.
