Jerry M.,"Chicago, IL",36,51,32,4.0,1/21/2013,"Ideally located by Cinemark. We (almost) always hit this place before or after the movies Employees are friendly, though sometimes understaffed during busy hours, which has made from some very long waits of table attention. Recommend bar seating whenever possible as bartenders are fantastic and have made balancing bar and food service an art form. One quick note for vegetarians, vegetarian fajitas are a must. Parking across the street is ample."
Sean F.,"Chicago, IL",35,74,,4.0,8/28/2013,"Chili's is what Chili's is.  You know what you're getting food wise at a Chili's, so if you're on Yelp trying to find out if Chili's has good food or not seems like a waste of time.  It's Chili's. They get high marks from me though for always having the friendliest, most attentive, and most accommodating servers of any chain restaurant, and really of most any restaurant I've been to in a long time.  They're always cheery, always on top of whatever you need, and doing their best to meet any of your needs. One should never wake up in the morning with a dream of Chili's dancing in their heart and resting on their tongue.  That's just weird.  But if you have to grab something quick and filling and usually competently done, served by some of the most pleasant people around, you could do far worse."
Tom R.,"Evanston, IL",66,75,4,1.0,2/11/2013,"I wouldn't say we go to Chili's a lot, but it's in the area and I could think of worse things to eat... That being said, I don't know that I'll be going back to Chili's for a while, in general after getting food poisoning after eating there this weekend.  Obviously I can't pinpoint if it was Chili's or not, but based on deductive reasoning, and the fact that I felt fine all day, ate at Chili's that night, ate nothing else afterwards, woke up at 3:30am and spent the rest of the early morning in the bathroom, I'm going to guess it was the Chili's. And honestly, I would have still given this Chili's a 2 or 3 rating, even with the food poisoning episode, but the service was absolutely terrible.  You know the service is bad when you make it a point to lower the tip down from 20% on the little touchscreen thingy at the table. I honestly don't remember the last time I've tipped less than 20% on even semi-decent service, but this was downright awful. I don't want to name any names, because that would be rude, but if you can avoid sitting in the bar, I would highly suggest it. First off, the bar was kind of crowded, so when a guy got up to leave his booth, we made sure we would be able to snag it. We had no problem with the fact that the table still had drinks and the check from the previous party on it, as we were the ones that snaked in and grabbed the booth out from under the previous party. Our waitress came by and said she'd be right over to clean up the table and take our drink orders, but after 5 full minutes of waiting, nobody had come by. The manager finally noticed that we were still sitting in filth and came over to wipe down the table. It wasn't until about 3 minutes later that our waitress came over to clean the table as well, even though it was already done.  She then took our drink orders, a diet coke and a captain and coke, and our order for chips and salsa. She came right back with the diet coke, but the captain and coke was nowhere to be found. Now I know that the alcohol orders all flow through the bar and the bartender was busy, so I'll give them that, but when I can see the bartender make my drink and set it out, I assume I'll be getting it soon.... I guess I shouldn't be so quick to make assumptions as it took probably another 10 minutes for someone to bring me that drink, AND IT WASN'T EVEN OUR WAITRESS! It was just another server who came up to get drinks for his own table, but decided to help the bartender clear out some of the drinks that were piling up there. It probably took another 20 minutes for our server to come back to take our food order.  Needless to say, as soon as she dropped the food order she got me another drink and dropped the check. We ate, paid at the touchscreen machine and left. I don't expect Chili's to have amazing service, but I also don't expect the service to be as shitty as it was. I'm surprised I even left as much of a tip as I did, but I hate being a dick when it comes to tipping so I was a bit on the generous side. It still wasn't 20% though."
John D.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Ate here many times before, but the last time was terrible. First, we were sat next to two tables when there were several tables open. So we moved ourselves over one table, which pissed the server and manager off. I caught them both eyeballing our table and talking out of the sides of their mouth--it was clear they were talking about us. We sensed animosity from our server ever since. Then, I was given a glass of water with red flakes floating in it. I didn't say anything to our aloof server about it and ordered a Coke instead. I ate three fourths of my entree only to discover a long black hair in my food. I told our server, Brenda, about this who insincerely apologized. We understood her poor service by the reaction of the apathetic manager, who came over to our table and flatly apologized. He couldn't even maintain eye contact with us when we were talking. It was clear he lacked the necessary training. He may have been new also. I don't know if the impending holiday threw their game off, or if they were simply having a bad day, but the service was horrible, and I won't be returning. I have always had to fight with my boyfriend to eat there because he hates Chili's, and now I'm totally turned off too. The manager took the entree off our bill, and gave us separate checks when we asked for one. They couldn't get one thing right! Good bye Chili's."
Daphne L.,"Evanston, IL",95,327,,3.0,2/12/2014,"Have I really not written a Chili's review? Really? Maybe there isn't much to say other than the food isn't bad, the service is decent, and, they have great drink specials. I meet a friend there for lunch about 1x a month, for their well-priced lunch specials that are even better w/our Wildcard discount. My only issue with this location is that the dinging room often looks like monkeys have run through, wreaking havoc and leaving behind dirty plates, cups, and napkins. Therefore, I only sit in the bar. They have a few outdoor spots in the summer, which is always nice for people watching. Not great, not horrible..fair."
Cassie S.,"Deerfield, IL",205,508,8,1.0,5/7/2012,"Yep, I'll admit it.  I sometimes go to Chilis, even in Evanston.  But I try not to (I prefer the one at Village Crossing).  I mean first off, there's obviously way better Mexican, Tex-Mex or any other kind of food in Evanston.  But also, they're just not a good location.  I don't mind Chili's once in a while, I just mind this location.  Service isn't great and the food wasn't even normal Chili's quality."
Melissa F.,"Chicago, IL",357,449,5,3.0,1/20/2010,"3 stars because 2 is too harsh, and 4 is too nice. Chili's is a chain that delivers the same thing every time. Their chips are weirdly thin - cost-cutting measures? I have no idea. Their fajitas are OK but sometimes too salty. A lot of my friends get their strawberry margaritas, which look like smoothies. Many Northwestern students come here for the margaritas and maybe graze on the standard-issue food. This shouldn't be too surprising...if it is, then I don't know what to tell you. Staff can be snippy. But when they're dealing with rowdy Northwestern students and their questionable IDs, I guess I can see what's going on - though better service never killed anyone. (It also takes forever before you see your waiter again. Nice.)"
Shannon-Leslie P.,"Chicago, IL",2,26,4,4.0,3/18/2014,"I love going to this location. Service is fast and I really like the waiters. Margaritas are the bomb! I always meet my friends for lunch here, it's easy and convenient."
Andy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,81,64,4.0,6/15/2015,"The staff is so friendly! I love it. Food could taste better though..pretty generic, but acceptable. Come here to catch up and hangout with your friend."
Roxanne A.,"Evanston, IL",88,173,391,4.0,12/30/2013,"Before Buffalo Wild Wings, Bravo Cucina Italiana, and World of Beer, there was Chili's.  This place is our reliable restaurant if we want to have oh so bad for us but delicious meal without the pretension of some Evanston places.  It's located on the same block as the movie theatre so it's a great place to grab a bite to eat that will come relatively quick and still make it to the movie showing.  If you're driving in and seeing a movie, you can park in the parking garage across the street for free, since with validation at the movie theatre, you receive complimentary 4 hr parking, more than enough time for dinner and a movie, unless it's the Hobbit movie."
April W.,"Chicago, IL",88,318,477,3.0,10/10/2011,"Chilis is chilis, but PLEASE vacuum the globs of dust hanging off your ceiling at this location"
Will U.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2015,"Don't go to Chilis expecting to order alcohol with a vertical ID. I just turned 21 earlier this year but was turned down anyways because I hadn't updated my ID. Although it wasn't set to expire until May, the manager chided me for not updating it ""so far past my birthday."" If it's Chilis corporate policy to miss out on $40 I guess that's their business, because we left and won't return."
Ryan H.,"Chicago, IL",5,24,,2.0,9/12/2011,"Chili's is usually good, but this one is not. Went there on a Sunday, around 6. It was really slow, something even the waitress commented on. I thought hey, that's cool, we'll get good service. Nope, it was almost impossible to be helped. First, they took mine and my dates IDs back to be verified by the manager. I am ok with making sure the IDs are real, but at least bring the manager to me as opposed to taking it from me. Second, the waitress was just plain bad. She checked on us once, and even after making eye contact with her she wouldn't come to our table. The food was also bad, which is odd for Chili's, as it usually is pretty good. I got the Hatch Chili burger, which was far too salty and tasted like it had tarter sauce on it. Very bad. Date had a veggie burger, and part of it was simply hard. Do they microwave them? Yech, come on. All in all, bad experience. 2 stars because I really still like the margaritas."
Will B.,"Evanston, IL",7,64,,4.0,7/10/2014,Great food.  Easy and quick.  Love the triple dipper!
Plenty F.,"Lombard, IL",16,98,10,4.0,1/23/2012,"4 stars. They lost a stars for the service being ""extra iffy"" sometimes. Other than that, this place is solid.  The location is great, and (if you sign up for emails) they often send out coupons that get you free stuff with your entree purchase. The salmon is wonderful.  The burgers are great and always cooked exactly how you order.  The hot wings are HOT!  The fries are well-seasoned.  The red velvet lava cake thing is pretty good, too.  Pass on the brownie sundae, unless you have a free coupon. Like I said, service is alright (at best) and the manager there is ""interesting"".  Super polite, but ugly at the same time and not very accomodating.  My twin sister calls it ""Nice-Nasty"". Anyway, good spot to catch a bite to eat before a movie  or an afternoon of shopping! If you are dining inside, use the kisok on the table to get your check.  It's pretty neat and super efficient - especially when you are trying to grab a good seat at the theatre. Funny thing, I've never tried the (singing) ""Chili's...baby back ribs....I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back...."" Maybe next time..."
Roseann M.,"Chicago, IL",122,453,94,3.0,10/30/2009,"So, Monday afternoon Mr. G. and I were planning to attend an event in the area, and we saw Chili's was close and open at 3:00pm. Not a lot of other choices in the area, and Mr. G. asked me, what was the last time I'd eaten at a Chili's? I told him, Bloomington, Indiana, in 2002. Somehow I did not have a great urge to return. We weren't looking for drinks in the afternoon, but we sat in the bar - it looked comfortable on a very wet afternoon. Way in the back of the menu I found ""healthy"" options, so I ordered a black bean burger. Mr. G. ordered a bacon cheeseburger with onion strips and french fries.  Now, I gotta say, we were pleased with the meal. Give Mr. G. a plate laden with cholesterol and beef, pretty much in any combination, and he's happy. He asked for it to be cooked well done, and it was.  My black bean burger was okay, not great, but hey, it was Chili's, right? And it came with a side of broccoli. Now, I am not a big fan of broccoli AT ALL, but I was game and tried it. And incredibly, it was good. We both ate heartily and were pleased with our selections. Now, the part that makes me give this only 3 stars . . . service. There was a waiter, and almost no customers. We did get our menus in a timely manner, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. But heck, i've worked in restaurants for more than 20 years, and this fella was lacking. Never got more water refills, had to hunt to ask for more napkins with our burgers (I learned a long time ago, always take extra napkins to customers who order burgers), never came by to see if we wanted anything else, couldn't find him to get a check - in short, he was just not interested. He probably wonders why he's not getting good tips, poor boy. The good part of this was, if I'm ever forced to go into a Chili's again, at least I know they have a black bean burger."
Marco A.,"San Jose, CA",2,5,,4.0,10/29/2011,"What can I say, I'm a big fan of the place!  Servers are very attentive and food is always great for the price.  Impressive consistency! I always go for the avocado burger, medium rare. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and tasty bite, Chili's is the place to go!"
Simplelife S.,"Cave Creek, AZ",3,110,204,4.0,2/14/2014,2 great burgers 2 fries and 2 pops for under $20 (before tip) what more can I say!!!!!!!!!!!! chips and salsa a must to go for later..................
Yvette W.,"Chicago, IL",44,267,47,3.0,9/21/2011,"My first time eating at a Chili's. I went with a friend and altogether we had cheese fries (most of the cheese wasn't melted, but still it was good), chicken fajitas (delicious) and a half slab of ribs (they barely had any meat on them - I was very disappointed). The service was good, waiter was nice, checked on us a few times. Our food came fast.The place was clean and not crowded. I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't get the ribs."
Ju L.,"Queens, NY",917,879,1194,4.0,7/7/2009,"I've only ever been to Chili's twice (both this location), and was not horribly impressed the first time, a year or two ago.  It was stupidly crowded, the service sucked, and the food was boring.   However, the last visit some weeks ago involved (aside from two people I very much prefer to the first group) a giant mango margarita for not very much cashmoneys ($3.50 on weekdays, for mango, raspberry, strawberry-mango, or strawberry-- The latter is not recommended).  If insanely sweet is not your thing, they have $3 regular (unflavored) margaritas on Mondays, either frozen or on the rocks.  Yay drink specials!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, despite the fact that we only ordered drinks + appetizer.  It's just a relaxing place to just sit and ingest stuff with friends while there's noise all around you.  And for its conduciveness to a good time if you're willing to have one: 4 stars.   Also of note, the salsa (of $3.50 bottomless chips and salsa) is basically water, but somehow extremely tasty.  I refrained from drinking it."
