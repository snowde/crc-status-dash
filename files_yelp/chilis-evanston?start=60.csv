Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",132,421,49,3.0,8/21/2010,"Well, it's Chili's, so you know what you are getting when you walk into the door.  The food is just mediocre but the service is friendly (and fast!).  The greatness of Chili's for me is that they have a gluten free menu (online PDF or ask for it from the hostess!). They have added quite a few nice salads and soups to the menu and are fantastic about accommodating my gluten intolerance. No complaints here! On my most recent visit, my gluten free meal at Chili's was... chicken & green chile soup (still awesome!!!) oldtimer burger, no bun, no fries, extra lettuce/tomato/onion, sub mashed potatoes for fries. I was well-fed here. Thank you Chili's for accommodating gluten intolerance!"
Carri A.,"Chicago, IL",25,337,56,4.0,12/6/2010,"Of all the corporate restaurants in the land, I think Chili's might top my list.  Here is my battle plan: 1. Chips & Salsa with side of Ranch (yeah, this is happening...) 2. Shiner Bock BBQ Burger with Black Bean patty and avocado slices 3. Dessert! If you see a movie at the theater just a few doors down and bring the ticket stub to Chili's, you get a free dessert!  I love a good deal, especially when it involves a Molten Lava Cake. They have great daily food specials and strong drinks.  And several TVs in the bar area for your sports-watching needs. Tyler was our server and did a really great job with us.  Half of us were hungover and we all just got out of Black Swan, so we were in a emotional tailspin because of that.  But he took care of our every wish quickly and completely. When in Evanston, I will not hesitate to stop by again!"
Andrew S.,"Evanston, IL",1,44,,4.0,10/14/2013,Why are you reading this review? have you never been to a Chili's? so why am i writing this then? because this Chili's never disappoints. The wait staff is friendly and recognizes even infrequent patrons. The drinks are cheaper than any of the other bars in the area and the food is exactly what you need. Its location is great in terms of proximity to the movie theater and the restaurant is clean and inviting. 4* only because its Chili's and something about a perfect rating doesnt feel right.
Babs E.,"Chicago, IL",9,3,2,4.0,10/12/2013,"I really Like this spot, never had bad service besides the one time my burger was undercooked. Drink specials daily and what's with charging 99 cents to play a game I can download for free on my phone? Not a big ribs fan but I've tried most of the stuff on the menu. My favs are the fajita trio plate and the Caribbean salad!"
Ben L.,"Chicago, IL",2,9,,4.0,1/30/2012,"What can I say.  It's Chilis.  I haven't really been to a terrible one.  However, I do hold this particular Chilis in high regard.  It's clean, they run great drink specials during the week and the food is enjoyable as always.   The chips and salsa are a must here.  They make their own chips and the salsa has just the right amount of kick."
Cassie M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",28,62,,4.0,5/1/2010,"We frequently go here before we hit the movies. Almost everything has been great. Love the food, the service, the drinks. Average pricing. They lose a star though... when we went for a low key bday dinner for my girlfriend, they brought out a little sundae for her, without being asked to... Nice, right? ...They charged us for it. Granted, it wasn't much, but I think it's less than awesome to bring someone an unsolicited ""gift"" and charge them for it."
Cornelius J.,"Chicago, IL",39,33,8,5.0,9/7/2011,Love this place for lunch!!! Cheap.
Michael O.,"Buffalo, NY",14,15,,4.0,9/1/2010,"Chili's as a chain has always impressed me with their consistency and this location did not disappoint.  We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and seated within a minute or two.  Our server arrived almost immediately with water and gave us a respectable time to peruse the menu to make our selections. There was a bit of a delay between ordering and our drinks coming.  I recognize the server has to wait for the bartender, but it simply wasn't busy enough in there to justify this wait. Overall, our food arrived as-ordered, hot, and delicious.  We didn't have any room for dessert, but the appetizers and entrees were plated to make the mouth water.  Can't wait to go back!"
Alex D.,"Chicago, IL",15,26,1,1.0,10/21/2012,"go for a cheap drink after a movie but not good for much else. for a chain restaurant it's pretty dang inconsistent. I've ordered the same food there before & gotten it served differently each time, some being much better than other. I can't really recommend it for more than conscience."
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2453,3000,2.0,11/4/2009,"After eating at Chili's many many times as a teenager, in my adult life I can say that I don't care much for it.  I've had some opportunities to dine here because of the movie theater up the street.  This location is smaller and can be busy when movies are letting out.  I already said it's a small location and within my few visits there I felt that service was much too slow.  In this area of Evanston there are far more options to be had."
april j.,"Evanston, IL",8,5,6,4.0,11/7/2011,We went in and had the double order of fajitas and it was only $12.99 on tonight : Monday. It's the perfect amount for 2 people. One inprovement that i wouks make is to have the tortillas heated more. Maybe even grilled would be nice. They also have the coolest form of payment. They have the tablet at your table where you can view your bill and pay for your meal and split the bill and add a tip all from your table ! It was fast and amazing. Whoever thought of that is a genius! I will definitely go back .
Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,5.0,6/3/2009,"If you are questioning why I'm giving this restaurant five stars when most of my food establishments have been rated a 4, the answer is somewhat simple.  I rate places based on what genres of food I think they should be in.  McDonald's and BK are in the same one.  Chinatown Chinese restaurants are in the same one.  Pizza joints are in another genre.  And Chili's - well, where does this fit in the grand scheme of things?  Americana?  Real food fast?  Not sure - but I group it together with places such as Applebees, TGIF, etc.  You get the picture. Part of my ""woohooo"" rating comes from the location of this place.  It's really convenient, and when I did my undergrad years in Evanston, a routine that I enjoyed was to eat at Chili's and go watch a movie.  Or...eat at Chili's, and watch 2 movies depending on what day it was.   Service is always speedy at this location.  I've done both the dine-in area and the bar area, and both offer fast service with dare I say - friendly waiters, waitresses, and bartenders. If you've seen the special on the Food Network that goes into detail about how restaurants like Chili's have such a consistent tasting menu nation-wide, you'll know how they do it.  All sauces, condiments, and foods come pre-portioned or come in containers by weight.  6 shrimp, two scoops of garlic butter emulsion, a package of veggies, some pasta, etc. gives you consistent seafood pasta.  It's not a surprise that they would do this, nor is this a particularly bad approach.   The drink specials at Chili's are also attractive.  When I lived in Evanston, I tended to go during the week, and they always had specials on their ""Presidente Margaritas.""  Yes, it has more filler than alcohol, but pricing isn't terrible.  Plus for a buck more, you can keep the shaker, which I did for my 21st birthday.  More often than not, I stick with their beer specials.  It's fairly easy to understand: 3 and 4 dollar regular sized drafts, and 4 and 5 dollar large sized drafts.  The regular sized drafts are more than sufficiently sized, but it's always nice to drink a couple of the larger ones when transportation home is pre-arranged. I recommend this place if you like a good amount of variety, decent specials, speedy service, and if you want to grab a bite before or after a movie at Century.  Skip it if you prefer your cognac warmed in a glass over a small flame and only want to eat at places that serve exotic fare.  (duh).  Now that I think about it though, I've never actually had a bowl of their chili.  Hrm.   The only other real complaint that I have is that they close at 10 or 11pm.  But bear in mind that they're restaurant first, then bar."
Christina B.,"Chicago, IL",62,221,72,2.0,9/8/2009,"The good: the waiters were really nice The meh: the food was generic but fine The bad: my lime drink trying to pass as a margarita and no validated parking in the garage across the street as well as false information by the waiter that we can validate at the movie theatre. Came in to have the 3 course, 2 people $20 deal. Ordered a Classic Margarita. No price listed in the drink menu. Took a sip and realized it was a lime drink with ice. Asked the waiter if they forgot the alcohol and he said no, but people complain about that a lot and they are working on it..would I like more tequila for an extra charge?(I declined...who knows how much the lime drink was let alone the tequila?)  Later I found out it was 2.99 day..maybe that explains the weak drink.  Food was good--servers were really nice. I was under the impression Chicken Crisper bites were just a smaller amount of the chicken crispers but I guess not...I was given little sandwiches..I was a little confused so they took them back which was really nice and made me something else."
Mik B.,"Chicago, IL",1,7,,4.0,2/2/2011,"Ya can't go wrong! Come expecting great food, cold beer and fast, friendly service. I reccomend visiting after you've seen a picture at the Century Theatre. Should you bring your ticket stub, you get a FREE DESSERT!"
Joey H.,"Chicago, IL",137,24,,5.0,3/5/2012,"This was the first Chili's I ever ate at. it was me, my gf Sarah and our friends Jeremy and  Melissa. I've now eaten here three of four times. my usuals are the Grilled Chicken sandwich, the crispy chicken tacos and the bacon cheeseburger.  next time I'll try the chicken club tacos. it's a great eatery."
Charlie T.,"Midland Township, MI",3,15,,4.0,10/17/2011,"Ordinarily, I wouldn't rate a chain restaurant because they are pretty cookie-cutter, however, because we signed up for their customer club, this chili's sends us coupons on a monthly basis for three days only, we get drinks, a shared appetizer, two entrees, and a shared dessert for only $35.  I don't know if this is common, but it brings us back here at least once a month."
Kelly C.,"Evanston, IL",34,52,,4.0,7/15/2013,"Went there recently with a gift card and was very pleased. Got the full rack of bbq ribs and they were GREAT. And although I may get laughed off of Yelp for this, they were WAY better than Hecky's."
Beckie M.,"Palo Alto, CA",15,14,,4.0,1/28/2012,"The first time I came here, I didn't think I was going to like it because of the lack of vegetarian options, but I've become a fan of the black bean burgers and fries (maybe too much so, but they do have the option of getting broccoli as a side instead). The servers are always good at accommodating my crazy customisation requests, too. Being able to pay on the ziosk is nice for getting out of there quickly."
Caitlin G.,"Chicago, IL",157,144,4,5.0,3/6/2008,"Oh, Chili's, Chili's, Chili's. How do I explain my relationship with you? I discovered you late in life. In fact, you--little baby at the corner of Maple and Clark, you were my first time. I was 21, and honestly, I was scared. How could a $3 margarita be good? Hadn't I avoided you in suburban strip malls all my life? But you took my hand, Chili's, and told me, 'Hush, Child, and order the margarita. Get some chips and salsa while you're at it.' Perhaps it was the haze created by three straight classic margaritas (on the rocks, with salt) or the way my head swimmed after those spicy boneless buffalo wings, but that night, I fell in love. It wasn't all class, that's for sure, but you never pretended like that was what it was about. Instead, it was about American comfort food, inexpensive alcohol that tastes like spiked Kool-Aid in the best way possible, and--let's call it what it was--a good time between friends. When people didn't understand, or they laughed when I talked about you, I defended you. You can't change a man, and you can't change a chain restaurant either, I told them. You have to love them for exactly what they are.  And that's why over the last three years, I've come back to you over and over again. Whenever I need a cheap drink, a burger before a movie, or to recollect my college days, I need only visit Evanston and go back to our corner. Like an old friend, you're always there, doors open and big booths ready, tucking me in for another good night. And for that, Chili's in Evanston, I love you. EDIT MAY 2008: I recently discovered that this Chili's has changed a couple things. New liquor distributor means that the cheap margaritas are $3.50, and only available Sunday through Thursday. Sad times."
Matt G.,"Chicago, IL",13,108,,3.0,1/20/2008,"You're probably wondering why I bother to review Chili's... I asked myself the same question. Here's why: It's become one of those place (not sure if this is good or bad) that I frequent quite often. Since I continue to go here on a semi-regular basis, I thought it deserved my 2 cents.  The reason I continue to go back? Skillet Queso...that's it! Chips, Salsa, and delicious queso. I will go there for lunch and simply eat basket after basket of chips. Their entrees are nothing to write home about and I've never in my life craved something off of their menu other than the Skillet Queso. Also, you might ask why a 3 star review for 1 dish? The answer to that is that it is an inexpensive option that serves up some decent margaritas (for only $3!) and they also have Dr. Pepper which happens to be my all-time favorite fountain drink. My advice to you is to save yourself some money on the tip and the entree you really didn't want in the first place and just get a skillet queso order to go and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home!"
