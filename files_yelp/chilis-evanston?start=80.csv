Joyee L.,"Anaheim, CA",53,102,5,3.0,9/11/2007,"I've never really had a problem with the food here as many of the people had. Maybe because I enjoy chain restaurant grill food. Now that I think about it though, it seems like half their menu is deep fried. Their appetizers leave much to be desired, their buffalo sauce is greasy and goopy, and their rib portions are tiny. I'll probably stick to their salads next time I go. Or better yet, skip the salad and get their $3 margaritas. ($3.50 if you want flavored margaritas... Try the mango!)"
Carolyn G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",53,326,22,3.0,1/4/2008,"How can you go wrong with $3 margaritas? Nachos to start, followed by boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries.  Buffalo wings are my weakness.  While the wings at Chili's are only okay, they met my need for the night.   Service was surprisingly slow."
Krista W.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,,4.0,10/28/2014,"We had a partial gift card left to use, so stopped over for dinner on a Monday night. The food was surprisingly good but our server, I believe his name was Dan, was especially memorable. He came across as very friendly, intelligent and together. A large party of about 40 college age kids came in toward the end of our meal and since it was a Monday night, it didn't seem like there were a lot of extra servers to cover it. Dan and another guy took that party as well, but not to worry, he still came by and was attentive toward us as we finished up and paid and didn't seem overly flustered. Another server walking by helped out too when we were unable to get the digital system to acknowledge our gift card. Overall, we were surprised at what a nice experience this was. We usually don't go to chain places in the neighborhood, but compared to some of the other dinners we've had at other places nearby with lackluster service, we'll probably be back if we see a movie nearby or something."
Garett N.,"El Cerrito, CA",107,539,,2.0,6/23/2010,"Typical Chili's food and fanfare, though at this location, the service was pretty terrible. We waited for a rather long time to just order our food and if I hadn't asked for the manager to take our orders, I bet we'd still be waiting. Oh well."
Joanne E.,"Evanston, IL",5,92,5,3.0,5/27/2008,"Okay, so why do I go to Chili's? First, location.  It is very close to where I live.   Second, speed.  You can usually get in and out in about an hour, which is more than enough time for me to spend in a Chili's. Third, I have a 16 year-old son and seriously, this is one of the few restaurants he will go to with me.  It is not that easy to find a restaurant that will have food he likes and that I can tolerate. Fourth, for some odd reason, my husband likes it.  He loves the chicken tacos, and to be honest, the kitchen always handles his special requests (no cheese, no sauce, etc, etc, etc) Fifth, the only redeeming items on the menu are on the Guiltless Grill section.  The chicken is not bad, and for some reason I really enjoy the black bean burger.  The vegetables they serve with the food are well prepared, and I can leave feeling good that I've had a burger, without feeling bad that I've had a burger (if you know what I mean!) So, we continue to frequent the place.  Not during peak time, however.  It's really not worth waiting for a table."
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,3.0,12/27/2005,It's a typical Chili's but it's right by the movie theatre so it makes it another perfect setup for dinner & movie.  The burgers are always a good deal and the appetizers are greasy and delish.
Kate W.,"Chicago, IL",86,178,,4.0,9/9/2007,"Ok, so I'm a little embarrassed that I'm writing a review for a chain restaurant, but whatever.  I have a good friend that's not at all adventurous with food and likes Chili's so we end up here semi-frequently.   It should be noted that this review is just for the bar area...  We went for the football game tonight along with dinner and drinks.  Everything's pretty cheap, and the margarita's are what you would expect for $3.  Nothing great but not terrible either. I would give them 3 stars because the place is just about average, but they get an extra star for the waitstaff.  They were having a slow night and decided that my friend and I were the most friendly of all the people at the bar (and neither of us is great looking so they weren't being nice to us because of that).  They all hung out with us, talked football and gave us (mostly me) crap because our team was losing. I was expecting just a regular night out with a girlfriend.  Instead I got to hang out with some cool people.  Plus our service was great.  We each kinda changed our order a little and everything was right.  They even threw in extra sauce for us.  Yay. Oh, I should also mention that even though they were hanging out with us, they were very attentive to the rest of their tables/the bar."
Matt B.,"Lake Forest, IL",5,54,,3.0,7/13/2007,"I am in complete agreement with Jennifer on this place.  As someone who enjoys finding good deals, the $3 margaritas and $2 beers cannot be beat.  Get the bottomless chips and salsa for another $3, watch a game at the bar and munch to your hearts content.  But please do not waste money on a meal.  There are a dozen other restaurants in Evanston that are twice as good for half the price. Tip: Great place to go after work, sit outside drinking margaritas, eating chips, and people watching."
Meg O.,"Chicago, IL",3,22,2,3.0,5/20/2009,"Chili's. The quintessential suburban restaurant. While most of us city folk like to say we would never step foot in a chain establishment like Chili's, I kinda find myself craving it every once in a while. Maybe it's because I work on the opposite corner and sometimes I think I can actually smell the french fries at my desk. Or maybe it's my fond memories of that con queso dip they have. ymmmm. Ever try the broccoli? Seriously, it's delic! Probably because it's soaked in lard and then brought to the table. Whatever the reasons, sometimes I just need me some Chili's."
Sahil M.,"Boston, MA",34,114,4,1.0,8/17/2009,"Service was slow, food was pretty terrible too. While the price and selection look good on the menu, everything seems like it was microwaved. The beans and rice are some of the worst I've ever had. The quesdilla I got was cold. Not a solid place for dinner at all."
e a.,"Evanston, IL",0,17,,4.0,3/19/2012,2 great burgers 2 fries and 2 pops for under $20 (before tip) what more can I say!!!!!!!!!!!!
Carolina L.,"Evanston, IL",0,13,,5.0,8/15/2010,"This is the perfect place to just walk in because their menu is so random, so you can actually just think of something and u will find it. Carefull ordering the hot wings though they are really hot!!"
Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",96,578,,2.0,1/28/2007,"If you're not here for the $3 margaritas, you should leave. Seriously. There are so many good restaurants in Evanston, even within walking distance of this place, so why are you eating at a chain restaurant with food that can only be described as mediocre? Why???"
Rocky B.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,527,16,3.0,3/26/2007,"Yep, I'm reviewing Chili's. I love their fajita's...especially the steak and portobella mushroom fajita combo. It is sooo friggin good. The chips with cheese dip is also really tasty. Margarita's are definitely not the greatest...very, very watered down. I don't just mean that they are weak...I mean they are watered down. Like they make them hours earlier with the ice in them before they serve them to you. They probably don't do that but....bleh. Go for the food and save the margarita drinking for someplace else."
Kate P.,"San Francisco, CA",197,106,,3.0,11/3/2006,"It's seriously impressive that someone got me to go to Chilis, but my friends wanted a cheap casual dinner, and this was the spot. The food was Chilis, I mean, you don't walk in here expecting gourmet cuisine. Our waiter was super cool and friendly, each of us made a couple of weird modifications to our orders and he brought them out perfectly. Our total bill for 3 people was an astounding....$23. I can't even remember the last time I've ordered an entree under $23. Easy & cheap, I could be talked into going here again."
Chgo S.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,4,3.0,3/27/2008,"I love generic food and no one does it better.   I can order anything on the menu and it will be the exact same flavor no matter what Chili's you order it at.   I am not saying it taste good, but it is consistent. I seem to go here everytime I go to the Centrury Evanston 18 for a movie.  The service is always mediocre, the restaurant is always loud, the fat content is disgustingly high (I can eat a salad at home).   Who really needs a blooming onion with 4000 calories?  Or spicy buffalo wings?   And where are the hot gay waiters in this college town?   The buffalo chicken sandwich is always decent, but I have one complaint... why the shredded lettuce?  I mean I can understand a garnish, but not enough that you can ask for extra dressing and have a buffalo chicken salad.   And why is shredded lettuce always bitter tasting?  The fries are some of the saltiest I have ever had and yet, I undoubtedly eat them every time.    For a quick bite before a movie, they do a good job... not sure if I am more disgusted with the food or myself for eating it."
Sheilagh D.,"Evanston, IL",0,1,,5.0,1/12/2011,There is NOTHING better than the warm and spicy kick of Chili's on a cold winter day! Every dish served is delectable!
The C.,"Chicago, IL",3,26,,4.0,10/4/2009,"Had the cajun chicken sandwich for lunch. Usually for dinner, I can scarf it down, and also order dessert. But this time, the portion size seemed larger, and there was too much food--not that I'm complaining. Really enjoyed the sandwich--it comes topped with onion strings and melted cheese. Yummy!"
Tasha B.,"Chicago, IL",6,38,4,3.0,9/28/2006,"Waitstaff is hit or miss. Mostly a miss, though. Gets very crowded on the weekends.  I avoid the drinks as they are pretty weak. I haven't had any problems with my food. Fajitas are always a hit. I miss the Carne Asada dish....awesome!"
Rachel F.,"Chicago, IL",2,16,,4.0,3/31/2010,"its a chain. so if you don't want to go to or don't like chains, don't go.  but if you're itching for chili's the chain restaurant, its great. great food, usually good service but i'm usually there during the day for lunch. its great for kids (they LOVE the chicken finger basket) and i've been in love with the chicken quesadilla explosion salad since my early college days."
