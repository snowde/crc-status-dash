David K.,"West Babylon, NY",50,219,103,3.0,12/26/2017,"I have been here several times over the years.  I'm pretty positive that I have reviewed this place too, but here we go. We came here for a quick bite and some drinks.  They are really pushing using the little table top kiosk machine to order and pay.  Trying to make it a thing.  The waiter came over and took our drink order. When he came back, I put in my food order.  I ordered the margarita grilled chicken.  It comes on bed of black beans and rice with some tortilla strips.  It was pretty good. Chili's fall into a range if you have ever been.  You will usually have an okay to good meal.  I think it is a good Chili's and the staff has always been friendly.  If you like that kind of place, definitely go."
Eric P.,"Baldwin, NY",57,296,,2.0,10/6/2017,My wife and I went to Chili's for dinner yesterday. It had been quite a while since I went to a Chili's and after yesterday I know that was a correct decision. We were seated quickly and ordered a bowl of chili a side salad a chicken fajita and some dry rub ribs. The chili was burned and inedible and had to be returned. The salad was ok but not inspired. The chicken fajita was very pedestrian and the sides were rather small.The ribs were not great but were acceptable.Even with the 50% off coupon the food was rather poor.Service was very good and was responsive.The price to value ratio is around average for this type of restaurant. All in all this was a poor experience and I will not be returning in the future.
Susan Y.,"Medford, NY",77,202,2,4.0,9/18/2017,"I recently came here to meet up with some friends in the afternoon on Labor day.    We were seated right away.  It was a holiday afternoon, but not crowded at all.  They had a drink special, buy one get one free, and you were given the drinks at the same time.   There was enough on the menu to please anyone's taste.   That had smaller portions for lunch, which was nice to see.  We spent the better part of the afternoon here just talking and did not feel rushed at all. .   Wait service was attentive and the food was decent."
Eileen C.,"West Babylon, NY",3,5,2,5.0,10/3/2017,"My family and I have been going to the Chili's in Farmingdale since it opened, and in all that time I'd say AT MOST we've hand 2 questionable experiences. The staff is very friendly, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is as expected for a family friendly eatery.   I recommend this Chili's based on mine and my families experiences here."
Natasha T.,"Massapequa, NY",10,7,4,3.0,10/3/2017,"I enjoy Chili's. I have lunch there at least 3 times a month. The food is affordable and  better quality than fast food. Some of my favorites from the menu are the buffalo chicken salad, tex mex bowls and molten lava cake....all great choices. I mostly get my food to go and the process needs a little bit of streamlining. Whenever I go to the Westbury location during the day, the to go area is empty and I have to pick up at the bar which can get crowded and extends my wait time."
Lauren `.,"Baldwin, NY",109,17,6,3.0,10/5/2017,Musics good servers are good bathrooms to clean the value is absolutely not worth it and the food is incredibly pedestrian even with a 50% off the truly was not worth spending your money
Judy E.,"West Babylon, NY",6,58,30,4.0,1/23/2017,"Went last week for their 3 courses for $10 deal.   I was not disappointed.   The website did not provide accurate information, and so I had to call and make sure what the deal was.   The three in my party all got fajitas, so that is all I can comment on. The salad was small, but fresh.  The fajitas were served hot  and sizzling with sides of tortillas, salsa, sour cream and tomatoes.  Lettuce was missing ?   We took the dessert home (molten lava cake), and although I enjoyed it the next day I am sure it would have been heavenly right out of the oven.  The deal was great for the price and it was the perfect amount of food for a light dinner    The convenient way to pay with the table side computer was quick, and kept my credit card within sight at all times    A definite plus!   Service was good with a two server team approach"
Tayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",139,98,272,5.0,4/19/2016,"I always visit this Chili's when its on my mind whenever I'm in the area. There's never too long of a wait to eat in or take out. We only sit in the bar section with the 7-8 TVs and theres usually different games/stations occupying each one. The whole kiosk system makes things great for checkout - swipe and go and the receipt is printed right at the table. We usually have coupons for free something whether it be desert or apps and the employees never give us a hard time with taking it to-go (most coupons are dine-in only). Drinks are good, food arrives in a timely manner and I have no memorable complaints from any of our visits! The Chili's app has a ""wait in line"" feature so check that out."
Mike T.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,7,,3.0,12/3/2017,"I used to think Chili's was one of the best options out of the ""casual dining"" choices, but my last visit was mediocre at best.  Upon entering to put my name on the wait list, there was a hostess who looked completely disinterested in helping anyone and just seemed to be leaning over the wait list area.  I had to basically get her attention to add my name on the waitlist, it was busy and we were told about 30-45 minutes.  The quoted time turned out to be correct which was expected and fine. I will say service was solid, server was friendly and timing on food and drinks was good which is the reason I didn't rate lower.  The real disappointment is with the food, in the past I always felt the fajitas were a good option here and it doesn't seem that way any longer.  I felt the chicken was sort of rubbery, and the steak and shrimp was overly seasoned to the point where it was difficult to really enjoy it.  Every now and then it seems like a good idea to bring the family to a place like this, and then I guess I tend to regret it.  I understand Chili's is a chain and I know not to expect really high quality food, but the overall experience seems to have become ""eh, it's ok"".  I probably will return because of the kid-friendly atmosphere and I like them better then Applebee's, maybe I'll try something else next time."
Jana C.,"Doylestown, PA",57,150,253,4.0,4/29/2017,One of my favorite chain restaurants. Service is good and the food is consistently good. The fajitas are my favorite along with the chips salsa and a side of ranch. Never had a bad meal.
Janet M.,"Bethpage, NY",8,23,,2.0,8/13/2016,"I'm not a very big fan of chain restaurants, but a bunch of my friends chose to meet here.  I found that the food seemed to lack character.  I got the beef enchiladas and they left me with a feeling of discomfort.  I should have just gotten a salad.  My acid reflux doesn't allow me to enjoy these kinds of things. The appetizers were all fried.  I was looking for greener pastures.  But you can't win them all? Or can you?  I told the server that I was disappointed and she told me that she would take note.  I felt like I made a difference.  The place was clean and to be frank, our server was good.  Not hibachi restaurant good, but very professional. I don't think my body can handle this food so I will not be returning."
Michael P.,"Oceanside, NY",67,25,14,5.0,4/30/2017,Food was delicious. Easy paying to complete order with device on table to close out check. Waitress was very friendly and professional. Prime Rib tacos is a must try!
Diana Q.,"Babylon, NY",355,785,1396,3.0,1/26/2016,"Visit Date: January 10, 2016  Came here with my hubby for our monthiversary dinner. We only came here because my mom gave us gift cards for our wedding anniversary and we wanted to use them.  It was alright I'm never one to be really impressed with chain restaurants, I'm more of a mom and pop independent restaurant lover so chain establishments do not excite me or wow me.  The prices are reasonable. I think we got our dinners 2 for $20.  I had the vegetable fajitas, hubby had the steak fajitas. Mine came with lots of veggies, some beans, some rice, usual Mexican fix ins of cheese, guac & sour cream. Hubby had to order beans & rice on the side because the meat fajitas don't come with them. Everything tasted decent, wouldn't say it was out of this world, but definitely not terrible either.  I felt they could have given us more tortillas, it seemed they gave us a small amount to share. We could have asked for more but we were okay with the 3 between us, at least I was. Still it would have been nice to have a little more in the tortilla pot.  So overall if you want a decent place that's nothing special this chili's will do for you."
Nicholas D.,"Farmingdale, NY",36,39,52,4.0,3/1/2017,Service was really good.  Sometimes these chains can be a nightmare but this place was really good!  We usually go for the 2 for $20 and it's a great deal unless my kids come and eat all my guacamole!
Jeff P.,"Levittown, NY",0,11,1,2.0,3/10/2017,"Went in for lunch the other day and the place was pretty empty. I would say we got in around 11:45 or so. We ordered a salad and nachos. It literally took 20-25 mins to get our food. It was just nachos and a salad. People who had arrived after us with a different waitress had been eating already. It was like they forgot or something, most likely because they sit and talk. The food only came out when I told another waitress what was happening. I mean come on, a salad and nachos."
Nika L.,"Hempstead, NY",31,109,189,3.0,4/26/2016,"This is my favorite location, it gets busy but the crowd is minimum compared to some of the other locations. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Recently met up with a friend there for an early diner."
EZamani P.,"Jersey City, NJ",146,103,106,2.0,2/27/2016,"We came here for a birthday party. This place is ran by a bunch of young people and they don't have the experience of giving good service.  My steak wasn't cooked right, we didn't get water at the table till the end of our meal when we actually asked for it.  They brought 2 extra drinks that we didn't order. And never asked if we want more drinks after they served the 1sr round.  Not a place that I would come back too."
Deanna P.,"West Babylon, NY",0,41,26,5.0,1/26/2017,"I'm not sure why this Chilis has such poor reviews. I eat here all the time and order curb side. The staff is very friendly, especially the managers! My food is always cooked exactly how I order it and they are extremely accommodating."
Nelson P.,"Westbury, NY",1,10,2,2.0,9/18/2016,Food was good. Wait staff was good and friendly. The guy at the front needs to be more friendly. So bland. Cleanliness was not so good.
Jonathan S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",234,299,57,1.0,10/19/2015,"Absolutely horrible service. The server returned to the table on 5 separate occasions, 4 times to say we are out of blue moon, stella, heineken, and finally bringing an opened bottle of heineken light and asking ""is this okay"". What is that? How can you be out of all of those beers on a Saturday afternoon? Something is seriously wrong!  Also, after being told that the wait would be 5 minutes, it instantly turned into ""maybe 20 mins"" in a half empty restaurant.  I will not be back! My money will not be wasted here."
Eraldo F.,"West Babylon, NY",0,5,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Horrible service! First time I came here, me and my family waited 25 minutes just to get cut off by another family who came in after us so we left. Second time I went the place was empty and still waited 10 minutes. Waiter was decent, seemed rushed. Forgot to bring out our APPETIZER and when asked for a refill she forgot that too. Food is decent but besides the point; HORRIBLE SERVICE. Highly don't recommend this place."
Hody F.,"Farmingdale, NY",25,67,136,3.0,2/22/2015,"I was amazed to find out that after many years they don't make the mushroom Swiss burger to me that's one of the classic of  the menu and when I ask our server she said ""we don't serve mushrooms anymore"" WOW!!! I try the classic bacon burger oh my god it was very greasy, the fat was running when I lift my burger, don't care for the new buns the only thing that I really love it was the onion rings very tasteful"
Antoinette M.,"Huntington, NY",0,9,1,3.0,5/9/2016,"Delicious new menu items. Juicy salmon, sirloin and classic burgers. Great combination platters."
David Y.,"Farmingdale, NY",1,37,,5.0,6/16/2016,Best food and best service. I eat there atleast once a week . They have a very good and friendly staff. They also have a very good manager. I love their chicken and beef fajitas. They are the best place to drink beer. They have a good varieties of alcohol drink . I usually sit in the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and they care a lot  about their patrons. The place is very clean and the food is always fresh.
Dacia B.,"Queens, NY",291,215,1170,4.0,12/22/2015,"I come to this chills a lot. There's always parking, hardly ever packed, clean and always good service. Ummm I love the warm chips and salsa."
Vickie R.,"Hempstead, NY",15,39,8,1.0,12/10/2015,"This was the worst establishment I have dined at....when you enter the dining area the floor is so filthy with food...the food was disgusting and the drink I ordered was the worst. The service was actually good, the waitress was very attentive...love that ....I'm not discrediting Chili's just this specific location!!!! When leaving we passed the kitchen and it was a mess and very nasty!!! Step it up people!!!"
Valerie V.,"Selden, NY",17,1,,1.0,4/23/2016,"I  came here for dinner with my friend and the floors,  my  booth and table were filthy.  On top of that my waitress had no manners,  I don't think she learned please and thank you at home. Don't waste your time coming to a place that can't even clean their tables or greet you properly."
Cassie G.,"Farmingdale, NY",181,16,5,3.0,2/16/2016,Only getting 3 stars for the food. Service sucked first time ive had a problem with a waitress (name danielle) Not very personable or friendly. Dropped the food and left.came over took drink orders app orders then brought them got food order and left. Didnt check on us at all. When she gave us he food barely moved anything on the table to clear room..left it for us. I got unsweetened iced tea with lemon and the lemon was definitely not a lemon...smelt like a fruit i could not identify. Made the drink taste gross.. Not a great service
Kori A.,"Deer Park, NY",9,141,15,2.0,3/3/2016,Here now. Wish I had a napkin to wipe my hands and I wish my waiter refilled my drinks & you know stopped by. This chilis is the worst I've been to.
T H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,120,,3.0,6/11/2016,"Went here on the limb it was my first time. The food wad pretty good. I ordered the margarita chicken, loaded potatoes and corn. The chicken was good moist, mashed potatoes was good but salty, the corn was good but also a little on the salty side. I would definitely try this spot again."
Kate K.,"Huntington, NY",24,17,,1.0,9/9/2015,"Service was terrible, asked for drinks and had to remind server to bring them. Ordered an appetizer (chips and salsa) and hadn't received it after about 20 minutes....our server brought out entrees instead. When I asked her to make sure that the appetizer was removed from our bill she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Biggest problem was that the staff was having their NFL draft party in the restaurant at this time. They closed off one area of seating so that they could have their party....ALL the staff was in and out of this area while they were working! No wonder the service was so terrible, they were too busy worrying about draft picks! The best part was while we were still eating dinner, our server came over and told us that we could pay whenever using the app on the table...she just couldn't wait to get rid of us! I will never return to this location."
Jennifer R.,"CORONA, NY",3,16,43,4.0,12/19/2014,Good food. The menu is overwhelming.  They should have better meal options for the 2 for $20. But I've had good experiences the few times I've been here. Overall not bad.
Steve J.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,27,4,3.0,5/6/2014,"Food was ok but I'm a bit confused about this new tablet/kiosk devise at each table. It seems that you can order food, drinks, and pay your check at the table without ever interacting with the waitress. The bartender delivered the drinks and the kitchen expediter brought the food. I only met the waitress once when asked if everything was ok. Not a terrible concept but the tablet is preset to add a 20% tip for the waitress. It's adjustable but where do they get the nerve to suggest that is a standard when the waitress neither greeted you, took your order, brought your food or accepted payment."
Natural J.,"Amityville, NY",26,42,53,3.0,7/23/2015,"Sooo this Chilis really use to be my spot, j recently met up with a friend here and now I remember why I really don't come here as much anymore. The service has really changed, the waitress acted like she really didn't want to be bothered, like she'd rather be somewhere else than serving us. I looked passed that, everybody has a bad day. I ordered the spicy tacos, which are my fav, but I must admit I've been hesitate to order anymore because it's like it's just thrown together, either missing something or just the presentation doesn't look good. My taco was missing the sauce, had to wave our ""happy"" waitress down to get more sauce. So the tacos were just okay, I've had better but they did the job. My friend ordered the white spinach queso dip which was soooooo good! I was excited because there other queso is good but since I don't eat meat anymore i can't eat it but this new one was on point. I'd go back just to get that. Me and my friend closed the restaurant out and I can tell our waitress was annoyed because she now wanted to keep walking past our table giving us the nice side eye, but our bill was already paid, and let me say I do love that you can pay on the table now, it's so much better than waiting forever for the waiter/waitress to bring the bill etc. Overall my experience was just okay, it's a franchise, so that's usually what you get, but I might swing back to get that queso. Yum!"
Rebecca J.,"Bethpage, NY",39,2,,4.0,2/8/2016,"Fantastic fajitas, Savory Spicy nachos, 2 for 1 flavorful margaritas - What more could you ask for? I love going to Chili's with my friends because we are always given great service, great food at reasonable menu prices and have more than our share of drinks. Frozen Strawberry margaritas are my absolute favorite! If you've never tired Chili's before, I highly recommend that you do very soon. The new smothered chicken burritos are awesome, I highly suggest you try them. Can't wait to go back for more!"
Michael M.,"Merrick, NY",1,20,4,3.0,10/22/2013,Hey it's Chili's.. What do you expect..  Place could use a facelift..  Cracked cement floor.. Must have been nice about 5 years ago..  Food is.. Well as I said originally it's freaking Chili's..  Good for what it is..
Ruben Q.,"Hicksville, NY",632,280,504,4.0,1/7/2014,"I like to visit the one in Beth page, they seem to be getting better with the service and the quality of the food.  i love coming in for some apps and adult beverages.  for a fast food franchise i like chilis...also the one one route 110 is pretty good as well."
Robert M.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,4,,1.0,12/6/2015,I was there on a Thursday. I used a card I rarely use. I had Danielle as a waitress. 3 days later my credit card number was duplicated and used in Staten Island. The time she had my card was the only time it was ever out of my sight. Avoid the thrives at this restaurant.
Bhadresh M.,"Deer Park, NY",2,6,6,1.0,12/6/2014,"Called & Inquired 12:24 am, Saturday Midnight about closing time. Person informed me kitchen closed but bar open another 10 minutes. Reached the spot at 12:29 am, Manager said everything closed."
Adrianna C.,"Elmont, NY",229,384,467,2.0,7/25/2013,"I would go back for happy hour, but not the food or service at the tables.  Best bet it to sit at the bar!"
