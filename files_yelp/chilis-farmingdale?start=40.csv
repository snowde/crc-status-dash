Sharon B.,"WALL STREET, NY",9,7,,1.0,3/7/2015,"Probably one of the worst experiences at a Chili's. Hubby's food arrived but mine was no where to be found. Hubby was almost finished with his food and no sight of my food. Finally, I asked the hostess for the Manager. When he finally got to my table he said he'd check on my food. Really? My husband was already done. The manager eventually did bring out my food but i lost my appetite. Our waitress was too busy chit chatting with her friends at the table in back of us to notice anything amiss. She NEVER checked up on us to see my food was missing. This place is a must miss. Spend your money someplace else. I'd give it negative stars if I could!"
Holly C.,"Lindenhurst, NY",52,91,62,5.0,7/28/2013,They ALWAYS !!! get my order right and the drinks are great it's hard to get decent drinks at a chain restaurant but this chilis always nails it we go here often and will be going again This week... I also suggest you try the new table side guac
Genevieve R.,"Long Island, NY",809,356,984,2.0,4/11/2013,What I enjoyed was my large margarita...That's it not the food or service...would go back for the drink though.
Regina M.,"Syosset, NY",0,5,,2.0,1/4/2015,"Went into the Farmingdale Chili's with my mom for lunch on December 26, 2014.  We were shopping in the area and decided to use the gift card I had received on Christmas.  What a mistake!    We walk in and they wanted to seat the two of us at a table for 6 by the window.  We said we would preferred a smaller table and saw many empty ones... Problem was they were all dirty.  I said we would wait.   We then sat at a small table and waited for the server.  He was timely but looked like he just ran a marathon and/or crawl out of kitchen after fixing equipment or something.  He was wearing a tee shirt that look like he slept in it.  He had on dirty jeans and was sweating all over his face.  All the servers actually looked like they needed a scrubbing wearing a  messy uniform.     We reluctantly ordered our food knowing he was unlikely cooking the food.  I ate half my salad when I found hair in it.  I did take a picture not knowing what to do with this.   The server was pleasant but I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I asked for the bill and he said I had to use the kiosk at the table.  What a PIA... never again will I go back there.  I prefer to be served my bill.  The whole experience was disgusting and disappointing.  What a turn-off! I paid the bill and even left a tip because the color of the hair was not the hair color of the server.  I am not naming names nor am I looking for anything free... just thought you should know.   I had been to the Bethpage location in the past with no issues."
Joseph F.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",10,27,21,3.0,6/4/2012,"While not typically a fan of large, national restaurant chains, I was somewhat impressed by my outing to Chili's for a family member's birthday. Since we were a large group (about 12-13 people), it took a moment to have us seated, but not very long (5-7 mins). Waiter was friendly and attentive (and kept the nachos coming).  Flipping though the menu, you have your chain staples. Burgers, wings, salads, and combos. Playing it safe, I went with the Shiner Bock BBQ Burger, and was surprised. The burger was juicy and flavorful (and gone a few moments after it was placed in front of me). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well, some where even pleasantly surprised.  Only negatives were things you'd find in any national chain. There were several other guests there for birthdays as well (apparently), so the sound of staff singing and clapping was almost constant and somewhat annoying (we did feel bad that the staff had to do something so corporately cliche and unoriginal, as a cute sing-song ""dance monkey, dance!"" kind of moment). Also don't know how good everything is on a consistent basis, we could have been there on a ""good"" night.  All in all, food was good, service was good, and we left satisfied. Best you can hope for when going to a national chain."
Allison C.,"North Babylon, NY",0,14,,4.0,11/3/2015,"Love it here. This is our go to spot for everything. Yes there can be a wait but where isn't there a wait on a Friday-Sunday? We have had many of the servers there and while most are ok, James is by far the best! (And he kind of looks like Dane Cook) he's extremely attentive and always stopping by to see how everything is going or if we need anything. Love it here"
Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",388,384,1085,2.0,6/21/2012,"If I ever choose to eat at a chain restaurant, Chili's is the one I go to. Greasy goodness. I popped in today because I had a free appetizer, and went with the southwest egg rolls, which were really good. Then my sister and I shared a triple dipper, 3 smaller apps, and those were good. We also got twofer pomegranate margaritas which hit the spot on this sweltering day. This is where things went horribly wrong. I order the same exact entree every time I come to Chili's, the crispy chicken tacos with fries. After all the appetizers today, my sister and I decided to just split one and take the rest home. So, I bit into the taco and the chicken was ice cold. I was completely turned off after that, I politely discarded the food into my napkin and sent it back. Our waitress was very accommodating which was nice. I may avoid coming here until the thought of cold chicken leaves my brain."
Rufino V.,"Gainesville, GA",3,15,1,1.0,8/16/2014,"The service was terrible, long wait time for the waitress to get to our table , completely forgot out appetizer order. Messed up three of our entree orders and the section we were sitting in was not busy at all."
Larry B.,"Farmingdale, NY",113,325,9,3.0,1/5/2014,"it's chili's, not much to say other than that the parking lot at this outpost is a nightmare thanks to neighboring walmart, panera & various other retailers - thankfully call ahead tends to speed things up with getting seated at peak times and the servers are pretty friendly, shrimp tacos this past visit were surprisingly good"
Alex C.,"Plainview, NY",2,10,7,2.0,3/19/2015,I have been going to Chili's for several years. This last experience was very disappointing.  Lately I find there portions to be getting smaller and quality going down.  When we first arrived we were greeted by a young hostess.  We requested a booster and he hands me a seat covered in sticky syrup!  Really would you sit in this.   The plates they brought for the appetizer were dirty.   We get chips and guacamole which was good but a slightly over salted.   We ordered a chicken dish that was tasty but had quite a bit of fat on it.  We also ordered a quesadilla which was above average.  The kids mac and cheese was dried out and gross.  The kids pizza was just blah.  The waitress was hard to find especially when we needed napkins and drink refills.  Which was odd seeing the place was dead!   The manager came over when everything was over.  I told him all my concerns.  You would think if they cared they would check on the table during the beginning of the meal.  Totally going down hill and would not waste my time there again!  If this place stays like this the customers will not return!
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",829,2232,20,3.0,1/21/2009,"Casual Dining Brand spanking new - that's the Chili's sitting just off Republic airport on Rt. 110.   Not having been to a Chili's in a long, long time, I decided to try it for lunch - met a bunch of friends there.  The menu is pretty decent with something for everyone from calories-be-damned items to their weight conscious selections. There were four of us and we hit the bar- the bartender was very good and we had our drinks in a flash.   Everyone ordered something different and I found a black-bean burger that looked interesting.  All the food turned out pretty good- Chili's has really upgraded their offerings. Prices were decent as the drinks were twofers and the menu prices were fair. Smallish parking lot on side and back."
Aaron M.,"Flushing, NY",0,17,5,1.0,1/13/2013,"A friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch. As a rule I don't like casual dining spots. This did nothing to change it. The server was pleasant but spoke so fast that I had to ask her to repeat what she said frequently. Regarding the food, the salsa was very watery tomato juice with a bit of hot sauce. The chips were paper thin with almost no taste. My lunch salad consisted of pineapple wedges which were a bit past their prime and browning, canned mandarin orange wedges, wilting greens and a dressing which also was without taste. All of it was drowned in way too much water. Should I have expected better? I guess not. I'll stick to the family owned restaurants as I always have. For those who prefer boring, mass produced, virtually tasteless food, stick to Chili's."
Kevin H.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",106,888,80,3.0,12/28/2013,Came here twice with my co workers ... The staff here is ok... When I come I always get the baby back ribs with Frenchfries  but other then that the food be good here.
Marianne D.,"Brooklyn, NY",143,115,7,3.0,8/21/2013,"Nice servers, american concept dining fits the bill with this chain. Works fine for a meal in the middle of nowhere Long Island."
Cory C.,"Manhattan, NY",29,76,20,2.0,1/24/2013,"It may seem like common sense... but if you want your appetizer to come out before your meal, be sure to let the server know..."
Christina W.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,5,1,1.0,2/7/2015,Disgusting. The dishes are dirty DIRTY and the waitstaff are rude. I walked out without eating or paying because of how horrible and gross it was.
Adam V.,"Massapequa, NY",50,6,1,3.0,4/11/2011,"I've been to this Chili's a few times, and each time its been pretty consistent.  The wait staff is fairly attentive, but can disappear for what seems an unusual amount of time.  Overall the food is pretty good, the only thing that really stands out are some of the salads.  The one thing to keep in mind with this particular Chili's is that the wait to get a seat during peak times can get up into the 45 to 1 hour range.  Call ahead to see what the wait is, and to put your name down. Bottom line, if you've eaten at chili's before and liked it, you'll like this one too."
Franco G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,54,,3.0,10/5/2011,"Chili's is my favorite of the value chain restaurants so it gets 3 stars.  If you somehow have never heard of Chilis, it's the same thing as Applebees, Fridays, Benningtons and Ruby Tuesday but with a little bit of a Southwest style. (bascially they add some heat to traditonal american items) This location has always had solid service, decent prices and consistent solid food as long as you don't go off roading off the common grub food.  The bar area can get a little crowded on the weekends or night of big sports games."
Lisa P.,"Syosset, NY",59,204,,3.0,1/14/2010,"2nd Time I've been to this Chili's.  My friend and I decided to eat off the 2 for $20 menu. We shared an appetizer of Fried Cheese w/jalapeno-ranch dipping sauce. They had discontinued the ""Fried Cheese"" so I'm glad they returned. I had a burger and then we were looking forward to the Brownie Sundae but they ran out..so we had to settle for the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie which isn't as good. I just don't like coconut. :( Lost a star for running out of the Brownie. Service was good for a chain."
Aj H.,"New York, NY",34,15,5,2.0,1/12/2014,"This is a current review...i have gone there for years ordering 2 for 20s from carside and never had a problem...but it seems that they recently hired a cook for the night shift who clearly has no idea what he is doing. Im sorry but never, until a few weeks ago, as well as last night, have i ever had a plate of Texas cheese fries where i had to scrape the cheese off of the tin foil at the bottom of the tray to make the dry, overcooked fries sitting on top of it suck a little less."
