Anthony D.,"West Babylon, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/8/2014,It took 12 minutes of discussing the price of a drink and how to make it with the bartender that took 30 seconds to drink.
Dave N.,"Great Neck, NY",79,290,,4.0,2/7/2011,"Out of Applebees, TGI Fridays, Houlihans, and other similar types of chain restaurants, Chili's ranks as my favorite. This is mostly due to their skillet queso sauce (which is OUTSTANDING) and their Big Mouth Burgers. Overall, the food here is good although (just like all the other similar chain restaurants) service is just mediocre and greatly varies."

Justine M.,"West Babylon, NY",0,9,2,3.0,9/27/2014,"3 stars is because i liked the food. honestly, i prob wouldnt come back to this location. the service was terrible. im not one to complain if service is slow because its busy with customers. but it was a very quiet lunch hour and the food still took forever. the waitress hardly checked on us ever, not even to refill our drinks while we waited forever for our food. over herd other customers complainin about their orders being messed up. i mean it coulda been worse but could have been so much better. the long wait was just rediculas"
Michael S.,"Patchogue, NY",36,29,6,3.0,7/17/2012,"I don't usually frequent large chain restaurants but Absolutely Mario was closed and my date insisted that she wouldn't mind casual. When she mentioned Chili's I was like Oh god .. the Olive Garden of ribs but actually I was surprised. Well not really considering I've heard their ribs jingle since I was 6 yrs. old, I kind of expected it to be OK and it was .. definitely not Smokin' Al's of Bay Shore but at the same time it was good for the price and was definitely sufficient for our date. My date frequents this place a lot as an affordable casual dinner spot and that's exactly what it was. There were a lot of drink specials going on and the bar seemed like it was pretty busy for a Monday night as well."
Sara P.,"Melville, NY",26,102,,5.0,12/15/2013,the BEST customer service and management--really appreciate the time management took to address a small concern and how they turned my dining experience into five stars with excellent customer service!
