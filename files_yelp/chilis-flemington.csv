Alex L.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",17,3,,4.0,8/4/2017,"for a chili's, this establishment was exquisite. my friend and i had decided on attending this chili's due to a popular meme where people say, ""hi welcome to chili's"". we ordered chips and guac for the table and we were impressed! i got the mango iced tea as well as the triple dipper combo for $11.99. i was completely satisfied. i saw that this chili's was rated 2.5/5 stars but it was just as satisfying as my local neighborhood applebee's. i would definitely recommend this chili's as well as my server julia, she was very nice."
Chastity R.,"Warren County, NJ",6,143,304,1.0,4/10/2017,"This used to be my family's FAVORITE place to go in Flemington but BOY, has it gone downhill! Upon entering, it took FOREVER to be greeted at the door & seated. We decided to sit in bar area as we figured service would be quicker. WRONG! The whole experience was just the pits! Our drinks took FOREVER to get to us, the food was completely doused in salt, and our server, Lexie, was unpersonable and unprofessional. I was totally unhappy! It's too bad. We LOVED this place before..."
Courtney C.,"Warrington, PA",39,219,287,2.0,7/29/2017,"We popped into this Chili's after starving and on the verge of hangry so you'd think that anything we ate would be good, but this was not the case. The restaurant itself was nice, it looked new enough and clean enough. Our waitress was nice and had a good sense of humor although she didn't check on us a lot during our periods of wait - this doesn't bother me as I like little interaction with waitstaff but if you're the type that likes to constantly be updated well you're not getting that. My friends and I had just talked about how almost all chain restaurants get bad reviews which we all thought was bad because ourselves we like chain restaurants, not everyone, but they do warrant a good review now and there, well this chili's was not the case. My food came out, I didn't order Mexican , maybe that was the mistake., but I ordered s burger. The burger itself, which I upgraded to grass fed I could tell was quality meat but it was a little flavorless, which I'm surprised at since most other reviews said everything was over salted - this was not. The bun was gross... it was like a potato bun gone bad. The whole thing was very greasy but considering my burger, which was supposed to cooked with pink, but there was no pink to be seen, was not greasy in the slightest, I guess it was the cheese? And then those garlic pickles - Ick! Don't eat them. I don't know why they put them with everything. And my fries which I started with were cold, season-less, limp and tasted like someone had just microwaved them. This chilis definitely missed the bar and I can see why, in this case, a chain restaurant got a bad review."
Victoria M.,"Warren, NJ",35,56,56,1.0,2/11/2017,"The booths here are terrible. Reasonably comfortable, but super thin, so everytime the person behind you moves - or their bratty kid jumps up and down nonstop you feel it. Distracting and awful way to spend a meal!  This completely ruined the evening. Place was packed and wait list going, so it's not like we could move. So frustrating and uncomfortable! Food was mediocre. My sirlion was way over cooked, and came out with the wrong side. When they brought it back rice was dry and had a not so great flavor. Have eaten at other chili's and loved it, but this one disappointed big time.  Had the cheese curd appetizer and that was good though so if you go be sure to get that.  Also Mac and cheese came out with out the breadcrumb topping, but was still ok.  waitress was nice and helpful, but couldn't save this place for me. Will not be back to this location."
Francisco S.,"Flemington, NJ",11,27,1,3.0,5/2/2017,"I like to come to this place for a beer and something to eat (usually crispers or nachos). Unlike the other reviewers, I usually go directly to the bar to avoid the crowds (especially on the weekends). Here's the breakdown of my review: 1. Food - 4 (consistent and tasty) 2. Service - 3 (sometimes good, sometimes not-so good but always friendly) 3. Ambiance - 3 (It's loud and noisy but I can watch a soccer game or MMA fight) Final thought: People need to realize that this is a Chili's not the Waldorf. My expectations for a chain restaurant are always different (usually lower) than a place that's privately owned. That being said, my dining experiences here are usually positive."
Joey Anna D.,"Riverton, NJ",29,95,29,2.0,10/14/2016,This place is so terribly hot or miss. And it's got a 50/50 average. The servers and staff are always nice but not terribly helpful or attentive most times. The food is usually average and there's always at least one or two things that are cold... and they aren't supposed to be.  It Chilis corporate standard meals but this location needs a serious retraining of staff and cooks.
Berna G.,"Skillman, NJ",6,12,1,1.0,9/6/2017,"Awful- just awful. My husband ordered a burger- medium well. Was bleeding and greasy when he got it. He also asked for a side of broccoli instead of fries- was served 3 pieces. I ordered the appetizer sampler as my entree to share, but did not get what I wanted. Of course our server wrote nothing down...alway a flag when ordering anywhere. Plus- she never reappeared for me to let her know I didn't get what I ordered or to refill beverages. Oh whelp. Lesson learned. Fool me once..."
Kim P.,"Dunellen, NJ",588,48,1,1.0,8/12/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. The service here is absolutely horrendous. We ended up walking out before our drinks came because the waitress was so slow. We didn't want to risk being stuck there forever. Also I witnessed a man with a beard down to his chest area walk out of the kitchen without any hair net covering it. So that was the deciding factor to leave. Go elsewhere. Friday's survive was exceptional and they're located just down the road.
Michael D.,"Edison, NJ",0,21,50,3.0,4/24/2017,"I haven't been to a Chili's in years, and we stopped in for lunch while visiting Northlandz.  The service was friendly and attentive, and the restaurant was clean and well maintained. As for the food, I had the chili rubbed salmon which was light and tasty. My wife had the guacamole burger. We  liked the quality and flavor of the burger. I would return, likely for a burger."
Jane A.,"Silver Spring, MD",375,331,231,2.0,5/22/2017,"Stopped in after getting lost in the road construction nearby. I sat at the bar for a quick lunch. The beer was from the tap and absolutely didn't taste right. They need to clean their lines or something. The staff behind the bar were unprofessional but helpful. I ordered one of their healthy meals with chicken and beans. The chicken and bean chili were good but it came with way too much rice. Instead of broccoli, I received green beans because they were out. How are you out at noon? Overall, a chain Chilis..."
Marvin C.,"Flemington, NJ",5,4,,1.0,7/11/2017,I know is no a real food but went you order a pasta and the plate is microwave hot and the food is cold that is another reason no to go to this place. Went I ask the waitress why my food was cold and my plate was good her answer was that the most common food to get out the kitchen cold so the removed from the bill but still no good. If you go to a restaurant is to get something better the what you can make at home right or I'm wrong?
Eric B.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,7,7,2.0,12/26/2016,"When attending Chili's I was really expecting some good food, I had previously seen commercials, and looked at the online menu. The meals were VERY different from the pictures. For example the food was in different portions and looked completely different, whilst the portions completely varied. The overall taste and feeling after was atrocious. Also I would. Like to mention that the atmosphere was not at all inviting, in the short time I was there I saw a overall mess, and even a waiter scratching his back against a pole. So in the long run I would not recommend this, and would advise you not to waste your calories on this highly unhealthy restaurant. - Eric B reviews"
Louie B.,"Three Bridges, NJ",1,9,,1.0,6/3/2016,"Really, really disappointed in Chili's. The service was subpar and the food was even worse. We got burgers and chicken - both severely overcooked - which arrived after a long wait and not even close to hot.  On a positive note, there are tablets on each table where you can pay your bill, order dessert, etc which is pretty cool. But even with the tech, I won't be coming back here anytime soon."
Alex P.,"Bayonne, NJ",80,3,,5.0,5/18/2017,"My boyfriend and I were vacationing in the area and didn't realize how early restaurants closed. Chili's was the only place open late that wasn't fast food so we decided to stop by. Our waiter (and host because it was so late) Steve provided amazing service. He was super knowledgeable about the menu and gave us excellent recommendations. The food was great too, my boyfriend would highly recommend the crispy cheddar bites!"
Jorge G.,"New Hope, PA",28,61,70,5.0,8/10/2016,Finally after so many visits we had a nice waiter and a decent meal. Kudos. Thanks Steven
H M.,"Dover, NJ",1,36,,2.0,7/17/2016,Family dinner.  Everyone left unhappy.  Service was slow and poor.  A plate was passed directly over my head to my husband.  Santa Fe Chicken salad had way overcooked chicken.  Chicken fajitas meh.
C A.,"Bound Brook, NJ",0,8,,1.0,9/26/2016,"Really bad service (Saturday, 9/24)... the tables were not bussed the whole hour we waited for our meal... huge mistake... at the very least, management should be very embarrassed and should have come out and apologized to us and to everyone there that night for that matter... a lot of unhappy people."
Menhir A.,"Branchburg, NJ",0,7,,3.0,2/14/2016,The enchiladas weren't bad flavor-wise even though they were a bit smaller than what I'm used to as was the burger and portion of fries that my son ordered. We left hungry. The server was attentive but our order took 25 minutes to arrive even though the restaurant was nowhere near full. We probably won't be back.
Kristin R.,"Middlesex, NJ",11,96,44,5.0,10/17/2014,Came here on a Sunday night and I must say that this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I would describe Chili's as a step-up of TGI Friday's. The food was great and so was the service. Our waitress was very attentive even though the place was jam packed due to the fact that it was Sunday football and they have all day happy-hour. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Ordered an appetizer of fresh Guacamole and chips and they actually make it for you right on your table which I thought was really cool because you could choose how spicy to make it. I will definitely be returning here! Extremely pleased.
Kathleen F.,"Carmel, NY",43,3,2,1.0,12/12/2013,"Servers here seem not to be trained in the basics of customer service--the hostess was cold and didn't seem at all there. We asked her for a gluten free option list and told our server that two out of three of us were gluten free, specifying who was gluten free with each order.  We waited 1/2 an hour for our order. When asked why people who came in way after us got their order before us, she tried to say it was because of the gluten free orders, which was BS--a steak and a burger without the bun. She put the ticket in late. What pissed me off more was that she made no apology, she acted like a kid who got caught screwing around and threw the blame on the kitchen. Not good customer service. Didn't help that we saw her running around the restaurant with a bottle of tequila that wasn't for the bar. Never again."
John M.,"Flemington, NJ",3,71,,1.0,10/6/2014,"Horrible just horrible. I went on a week night and not many diners were there. They had the bar crowd because of the football game. The floor was dirty and another table complained too. It took them 15 minutes to clean up the trashed floor. The service was worse. It took over 45 minutes to get out nuked food. The server claimed they were busy with an attitude. When the rest of my meal even took longer, I asked to see the manager. like another reviewer wrote, this wasn't permitted. I went away from the customers and called the manger who had an attitude too. She claimed they were busy, which wasn't true. I said she was not organized and not trained. You could see that the staff wanted the money, but not the work. They all gathered by the cash register and talked to one another instead of doing their job. Small portions, a dirty floor and smart mouthed kids. I wonder if the owner wondered why there was very little business. I had the same slow service on a Saturday too when they didn't have much business. I am sure they are open for the bar only. The manager must be tight with the owner is all that I can say.  Avoid this place."
Doug W.,"Manville, NJ",0,11,4,1.0,1/7/2014,We were here 2:00 in afternoon had wait to find hostess to be seated.then waited about ten minutes to get drink order.then another ten minutes for food order. Waited over hour for our food.waitress was very cold to us but very friendly to bar crowd better tip I guess.i will never be back even though food was good chicken fried steak.
R B.,"Moraga, CA",2,28,6,1.0,12/29/2014,"food was cold, overcooked.   Wait was long but atleast the server tried hard to be attentive.   i won't bring my family back there"
Krista C.,"Flemington, NJ",14,2,,1.0,2/22/2015,My husband and I went here for a night out without our children. Upon entering the place the hostess went in the back came back and said I need your name for the wait. It will be 5-10 minutes. Upon waiting we could clear see four open tables. To make it worse two sets of families came in after us said the number of people in the party and were seated. We will not be back
Pablo T.,"Middle Island, NY",5,57,10,4.0,4/8/2015,"The best taste, really good service, the place is nice and clean,  i had a steak and it was amazing, the only bad thing was the size :p,  but is a great place."
Melissa W.,"Lebanon, NJ",7,22,14,1.0,8/4/2014,Can't stand the place...dirty slow service and awful food.you are better off at McDonald's
Elizabeth P.,"Frenchtown, NJ",0,2,,3.0,12/27/2015,"Usually the wait for this place is very long, but tonight it was very busy but we got in very fast. They gave us a table all the way in the back in a dark corner even though i could see at least 4 other booths that were not in that dark corner available. My dad order a sirloin steak with EXTRA french fries and got only a few. His steak was chewy and not exactly the best. I ordered the cajun chicken and the chicken was very rubbery and was very spicy but the pasta was OK and so was the sauce. Overall, this visit was very mixed i would not recommend."
J S.,"East Hanover, NJ",3,52,6,4.0,9/15/2015,"Great food, good service but can be slow. Overall, never had an issue here. Restaurant is clean. Best part is being able to pay with Ziosk, splitting check is much easier."
Steve R.,"Danville, CA",37,139,77,3.0,1/12/2015,"We were looking for an easy lunch with the baby on a Sunday at a place that would be showing the NFL playoffs. Chili's was our choice. We were seated right away. I haven't been to a Chili's in a while but I found the decor to be nice and the energy level to be high and fun. I didn't care for the tablet computer that they had on the tables. We try to avoid using our phones at the table and here the restaurant has a distracting tablet on the table. It's not my thing. I think they charged for games too so even if we were going to try to set the baby up with something, there was an extra charge (though at first glance I think it was nominal). The service was great; the waitstaff were extremely friendly. The food was also tasty. I found the fix ins for the fajitas to be skimpy - maybe three jalapeños though I am sure if I asked for more I could have gotten them. Altogether, Chili's helped us enjoy an impromptu lunch with the baby and we will most certainly be back."
Anne C.,"Neshanic Station, NJ",5,67,235,1.0,7/28/2013,Have given this place several attempts - no more. Food and service lacking. Many better options around.
Rachael P.,"Fairview Heights, IL",5,24,,2.0,1/25/2014,"I've never been a huge fan of Chili's. That being said, my meal last night was no bueno. I ordered a full rack of original baby back ribs, what they are known for. The ribs were bland and not tender. The mashed potatoes were funky tasting but the broccoli was good. Service was par. She managed to get our food out and the check but not much else. The molten lava cake was a few degrees above room temp. Overall, unsatisfied."
Anthony S.,"Glassboro, NJ",47,36,13,2.0,7/11/2013,"No host or hostess to greet us after five minutes, so we sat ourselves. It took another five-seven minutes to get a server. Lame. Our food made its way after we reminded our server that we were waiting for it (another fifteen minutes in a half-dead restaurant). Only good side was the server was very apologetic, but that only gets you so far in the business. I'd take Buffalo Wild Wings over Chili's anytime."
Victoria M.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",0,5,2,3.0,2/21/2016,"So me and my boyfriend are regulars at any chilis and have been to this one once before. Tonight though was the worst experience we've had ever. First the host wasn't even paying attention to us when we came in then when we sat down were waiting for like 20mins then we had to ask to get the service. We ordered our food appetizers and drinks at the same time took another 10 mins to get our drinks then waited awhile for our appetizers which arrived the same time as the food which I hate. It's an appetizer for a reason. Then my boyfriends meal didn't come with the vegetables that it was suppose to. Only reason we were surprised about it is because we overheard the waiter talking to the table next to us saying try ran out of asparagus but didn't let us know. My boyfriend was looking forward to the vegetables since he restricts himself on certain meals. So it was just a. Steak on a plate. The waiter should have told us so he could have asked for a substitute, but didn't. Also my drink wasn't correct and the waiter said that it was because he didn't do as many pumps of the flavor as they usually do. Pretty sure there's always a set amount that they have to do in drinks since I've always ordered the same blackberry lemonade and it always stayed the same. Then the waiter didn't even come to check on us once. We don't know if this waiter Jonathan was new but the service was horrible. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because we're regulars at chilis."
Tara M.,"Branchburg, NJ",14,48,,1.0,6/23/2013,"We went here around 5pm hoping it wouldn't be crowded.  They sat us near everyone else when there were plenty of other booths.  I should have asked to move.  After our neighboring tables left, a party of 35 came in and they moved all the tables around to seat them.  Uggh.  Once the party was seated, they wouldn't have been so bad had a couple entering not stopped to talk to them.  Blocking the way for servers.  Crowding us in our table.  The worst was not one server asked them to move, just edged past them with food.  Not very professional.  And the place was dirty.  You could see dust on the window ledge and the row dividers.  Splatters on the chair and table legs.  I didn't feel so bad that my toddler drew on the wall with crayon.  They need to clean more than the surface of the tables.  The food itself wasn't too bad, but not worth the aggravation.  We won't be returning."
Yvonne K.,"Ringgold, GA",30,190,53,4.0,6/23/2012,"Ok so I like this place...I can't resist the chips and salsa here...even though the salsa is probably just a can of tomatoes! I don't usually order cocktails at these chains...the corporate recipe is usually not much more than friut juice but the corona/rita was actually pretty good!!I had a new item on the menu.."".shrimp tacos...""very good the beans were a little too watery and the rice seemed okay if you like white rice!The service was also good!"
Michael T.,"Flemington, NJ",23,37,,4.0,5/30/2013,Very good food and great service from Henri.  Nice additions to menu with pizzas and now have a lot of healthy options!  Good place to watch a game as well!
Jessica S.,"RINGOES, NJ",46,17,,2.0,8/1/2012,"Out of all the chain restaurants Chili's is one of our favorites, but the Flamington location has bad take out service.  First, they always take double the time they tell you, so you are always waiting.  Second, the order is never accurate.  They usually get the meal right, but there is always something wrong or missing.  We have gotten burgers missing fries, salads without dressing, boneless wings missing the sauce, etc.  There doesn't seem to be quality control."
Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,845,26,3.0,11/11/2011,"Not a big fan of rating chains, but I do like this place.  Flemington has most of the chain restaurants now, but I think Chili's is a step above them all.  To start, I think the actual space here is pretty small and it can always looked pretty packed.  The bar area is relatively big.  As far as the service goes, completely hit or miss.  It is mostly young kids running the show, so the service can go either way.  I would say it is fair to call the service inconsistent.   As far as the food goes, I like it.  It is always a good idea to start out with the chips and salsa.  I actually really like the salsa here - very good.  As for my meal, typically I order the bacon cheddar burger and I have never been disappointed by it.  It is usually cooked very well and tastes great.  I don't really think you can go wrong with a burger here.  My wife usually gets a salad and they are good, too.  Overall, a pretty solid place that shouldn't disappoint."
Tim O.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",0,19,,4.0,11/11/2011,"I like coming here because it's a consistent restaurant.  Things are brought out in a timely fashion, and the food is priced fairly.  I've been coming here for years and have never had a problem.  In my opinion its one of the better run chilis restaurants i've patronized."
Justin B.,"Chicago, IL",207,151,10,1.0,12/3/2008,"My brother had a craving for a bleu cheese burger from Chili's on the way back from the airport, and now that he mentioned it, a buffalo sauce burger didn't sound bad, either. I was the co-pilot, so I whipped out the handy Blackberry and made the call: Chili's: Thank you for calling Chili's. This is R--. Justin: Hi. Can I have a bleu cheese burger to go? C: Sure. Anything else? J: Yes, can I also have a buger with buffalo wing sauce and swiss cheese? C: (Pause) Um, we don't really have that. J: Well, can you just give me the burger and put the hot sauce on the side? C: (Crickets chirping). Well, I...Uh...We don't have a burger with buffalo sauce. We have a chicken sandwich with buffalo wing sauce. J: OK. You know what? That sounds fine.  C: So, that's a Ranch Chicken Sandwich, then. J: Wait - it has ranch on it? I want buffalo sauce. C: It has both. J: Can you put the ranch on the side, then? C: Sure. (Reads back the order.) J: Okee-dokes. All I wanted was a dang burger with hot sauce. Apparently that required too much creative thinking for the folks at Chili's. Apparently asking for one of the two sauces on the side blew someone's gasket, too: All I wanted was that buffalo sauce, and wouldn't you know that it never made it onto my chicken sandwich?!? It was a ""Who's on First"", Chili's-style."
