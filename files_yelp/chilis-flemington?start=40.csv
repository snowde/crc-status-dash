Melissa D.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,5,,1.0,1/15/2013,"Worst Chilli's experience I ever had, and Chilli's is my favorite chain restaurant. I sincerely wish I could give this place a -5 stars. So bad, that after this review I'm going to try and email or contact someone in corporate. Horrible experience. So my boyfriend and I arrive and the hostess gets to us right away. The quick service is a short-lived joy because she brings us first to a dirty table and stammers---""Uh..Um..Okay, let's just go this way"". WE lead her out of the crowded area and she looks around desperately to try and cover her tracks. She points us to another table and scurries away. This wasn't that big of a deal to us, but it certainly was the start to a bad night out. Our waitress comes over after some time (I really wish I remembered her name--If I get it I'll edit it in here) and takes our drink order. She slams down the drinks and walks away. From the beginning, she wasn't too kind but this made me ask my boyfriend jokingly ""did you do something wrong to this woman in a past life?"" (of course he had no clue who she was). That's how rude she was to begin with.  We order our food and it comes eventually. Our waitress doesn't check up on us at all in the meantime. We finally do get our food, and I notice the portion sizes are rather small to what we normally get. I looked past that and was looking forward to our meal. However...in one of the fries, a piece of hair was fried into it. I was disgusted and lost my appetite almost immediately. Of course, our waitress took forever to come around to check on us, and when she did we reported the mess to her. She seemed disgusted, rightfully so. She took the fry into a napkin and told us that she would show this to her manager, who we could see from where we were sitting. We watched intently as we see him actively shaking his head and throwing his arms up in the air in a ""I give up"" sort of matter. We expected him to come over and apologize to us right away. We waited...and waited...and waited. He never came, not once throughout our entire visit. We heard no word from our waitress, and the manager never came over, and we sat there dumbfoundly. My boyfriend ate the rest of his food, and I pushed my plate to the side because I couldn't stomach being in the place anymore. Our waitress FINALLY, again with the poor service, shows up and asks if we'd like anything else. I shoot my boyfriend a disgusted look, and he says, ""Um, yes. Is the manager going to come over to us? What's going on with that situation?"" She replies ""Oh yeah. We took your meal off the bill. No need for him to come over."" Seriously?! It's common courtesy to apologize for a disgusting move like that. It's not like the hair had just fallen onto my food. It was DEEP FRIED into a fry! And the staff was willing to shrug it off like no big deal? Disgusting. As we were leaving, my boyfriend told the hostess that it was not the rude service or the disgusting fry mishap, but the fact that the manager neglected to come over and talk to us that would forever keep us away from their establishment. Not only was our experience, the staff, and the food horrible--the bathrooms were DISGUSTING and horribly maintained. If the bathrooms, that are to the public eye, are that gross, who knows what the kitchen looks like? I made sure to snap a few photos before we left to email to someone higher up. I spent the past five minutes typing this out, and I'm not a big reviewer. Stay away, this place is horrible. Not even worth a quick bite to eat."
Bill B.,"Cleveland, OH",0,24,5,1.0,9/29/2012,"Service here is the worst!  Waited more than 15 minutes for a server to show up (with no water or utensils/napkins) and take our drink. Ended up having to tell him (twice) before we got utensils/napkins, by which time our appetizers were cold.  The entree definitely did not look anything like the picture in the menu, and taste was just OK.  Would not recommend the Chili's in Flemington, NJ due to the poor service.  Chili's in general I would give 3 stars (average for a chain restaurant)."
