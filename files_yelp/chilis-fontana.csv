Poppy C.,"Phelan, CA",9,117,13,4.0,12/2/2017,The food was really good and our waitress was very attentive and nice. The only reason they get only 4 stars is because of the hostess.  She and what could have been the shift manager....I'm thinking this because she had a set of keys on here arm... were busy chatting it up in the bar area and ignoring the people waiting to be seated.  The then just headed in the back.  After a couple more minutes of waiting I had to go get them to seat us and the people in front of us. Lucky for Chillies the waitress was so good.
Melissa C.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",26,67,7,1.0,12/10/2017,"I think Chili's has finally run it's course for us.  We received gift cards from the corporate office after a horrible experience at the location in Redlands, and decided to give the Fontana location a shot tonight. We checked in online and only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived.  We were seated at the crappiest table in the entire restaurant. Right next to the kitchen and the bathrooms. Literally my view was of a wall. When the host sat us, there wasn't even enough chairs for my entire family. So he had to go round them up. You'd think that this would be done prior to us being seated. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start. Most of the chips were soggy and oily. Not even remotely crispy. We were hungry, so we ate them anyway. My husband and I split the fajita trio which was mostly vegetables for $17.99. The steak was poor quality and very fatty. The chicken had zero flavor and there were only 5 tiny shrimp. Beans were cold and some of the shredded cheese had mold. My son ordered the club sandwich that was literally falling apart when brought to the table. The top of the sandwich bread had slid off and nobody bothered to think ""Hey, this looks like somebody's leftovers, we should remake it properly."" Nope. Just served it to us anyway. The lettuce was wilted and fries were cold.  Service was okay. Nothing spectacular, but the food and ambience were so shitty it really wouldn't have mattered. $67 for food that was one step above cafeteria slop. I would have had a better meal at In-N-Out for $15. I guess I value my money more than most, but I am really tired of restaurants serving shit food for nearly $100. Completely ridiculous. Sorry Chili's. You used to be a regular place for us, but you're no longer a good value for my family. Completely disgusting food topped off with cooks and servers that just don't care."
Trent V.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/19/2017,"TLDR: food took too long. Enjoyed a cheap beer before leaving Went in for a nice meal before my night shift at my job. I had a little under hour to spare so I figured even with a longer wait I wouldn't have much of an issue. Had my drink and food ordered within the first 5-10 minutes of arriving and then....... Nothing. About 30 minutes passed without any indication of the food running late, the restaurant was sitting people as they came in when I first arrived so it didn't appear there would've been any significant reason for the delay. But given that there was very little time for me to actually enjoy the meal without having to rush so I found the host, explained the situation, paid for my beer and left."
David S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",81,254,348,3.0,11/16/2017,Stopped in for drinks and wings.. no ultra on tap but bottles were ok.. wings were ok and service also. Was Sunday so football was on.
Susie V.,"Carpinteria, CA",101,50,25,3.0,9/23/2017,"Service is okay, unfortunately this location is not very good for large groups. This Chili's seems a little smaller than the rest, there's only a few tables that they are able to use four groups of 6 or larger so the waiting will typically be more than usual. Food was as good as expected and our waiter was polite and prompt with what we needed. I recommend this place if you intend on going with less than 4 people and plan on hitting the bar. You'll get service much faster that way!"
Danielle M.,"Ontario, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/6/2018,i walked into chilis with my husband and 2 children around 9pm today . the restaurant was very empty only the bar was occupied . several servers walked past us and none of them spoke to us or tried to help seat us . we stood in the front of the restaurant for about 20 minutes with a baby and a 4 year old and all the employees could care less . so we left . i will never be back and i would never give my hard earned money to a crap establishment like this location .
Sarah V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,48,4,5.0,11/26/2017,"We're here at least once a month and our service is always great (servers are friendly, well-staffed and attentive). The food is great. The steak is mouth-watering and the Cajun chicken pasta is creamy and good. My kids love coming here and the Zoosk device entertains them so my hubby and I can enjoy talking to each other. If you're concerned about the wait to get in, use this app to get on the waitlist. I've used it twice now and are able to walk in and be seated immediately."
Norman S.,"Chino, CA",20,50,25,1.0,10/6/2017,"Trust me go to the grocery store buy the food you think you wanted to eat, go home you tube how to make it and you will be 1/2 the time before your even seated here. We waited an hour for a place that has had 7- 10 tables empty but let's make people wait not enough seats in the waiting area vs at least seating them. I highly recommend go son place else."
Voltaire V.,"Adelanto, CA",0,37,12,2.0,12/7/2017,"It was so strange. Waited a long time to be seated and once we were, we waited quite a while to get our orders in. At first we were helped by a ""busser?"" who was very sweet, but not fully knowledgeable on the menu. Then we did see our server a couple times, but it seemed as if she might have been covering most of the tables in the restaurant so we didn't get a whole lot of attention. The food was good, but the drinks were hit and miss."
Joana F.,"Fontana, CA",335,176,320,3.0,3/30/2017,"Seriously, JUST OK! Sadly, we've visited this spot several times, and it is nearly always a complete HIT or an absolute MISS! For a while there, I dreaded coming here because of a clueless hostess who had the entire restaurant in a state of utter confusion. Someway or another, we'd always end up ""forgotten"" when this hostess was the one seating us. Fortunately, she is no longer working here, but the service is, sadly, not as consistent as it should be.  The food has never been an issue (hence the OKness). I really enjoy their chips and guacamole, and they have several entrees that I am a fan of. I like the tex-mex pairing menu, as well as the fajitas. Can't go wrong with those. They also used to have this amazingly delicious watermelon lemonade, but I'm not sure where that went.  The place itself can be really dirty at times. Tables not clean for a while, etc. You never really know what you're going to get on any given day.  My best advice, cross your fingers before you walk in and hope it's a good visit!  On that note, I'll probably be back, eventually, when the bad experiences aren't so clear in my memory and I am sick of Applebees. The end."
Troy T.,"Rialto, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2017,"We went for dinner. My mom can't stand to long and all the waiting area was full so we sat her at a table next to the waiting area,and there were empty tables..after 20 min the hostess told her she couldn't sit there they needed the table..after having her stand for 15 more minutes they finally sat us......at that vary table they told us they needed..we asked for manager to complain but never came to our table....terrible service.."
Holly R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,34,17,2.0,8/17/2017,"Sad to say this restaurant is going downhill. They have eliminated their serving staff with ""bar and food runners"" that are improperly trained ran our food and dessert to the wrong table Drinks took forever I won't be surprised if they are shut down soon. Very sad for s restaurant we have Been eating at for years"
Pam V.,"Fontana, CA",22,65,29,5.0,8/6/2017,"8/5/2017 5:00. pm...We sat in the bar area, our server was very busy but did an awesome job. Food was great, priced ok, service was fantastic."
Sheri B.,"Fontana, CA",1,15,2,4.0,10/27/2017,"We ordered chili's to go we drove up and didn't wait long,  but the parking lot is a hassle, there was no where to park for curbside pick up because the 2 spots that are for that, 1 had a customer waiting, the other had a motorcycle parked in it,  I think they should keep an eye on them making sure no one parks there since the parking lot is so small,  But food was good as it always is !  and the girl that brought it out was nice"
Christine G.,"Fontana, CA",77,25,413,1.0,5/25/2017,"I don't know why I even bother. Every time I order food to go, they get the order wrong. And it really takes multiple offenses to warrant a bad review from me. I really don't ask for much. All I ask is that the person preparing my food read my online order and make my dishes one at a time. So that the plain burger with only lettuce, doesn't end up with all the sauces on it. While the burger with all the extra fixings actually gets prepared correctly with the french fries on the side. I'm glad the girl at the check out counter caught they had forgotten to pack french fries. And speaking of sides... I paid an extra $1 for onion rings. Now check out the container of onion rings my dollar bought me with the pic I'm adding. I don't expect an grandiose amount, but I'd like to think my $1 would get me a little more than someone's leftovers. :-/"
Sara J.,"Upland, CA",29,67,70,5.0,4/18/2017,"Love the service!!! All the servers are very helpful and quick. The chips and dip you can't go wrong. Thin with an amazing crisp, not oily. The chips yum! Triple play is a great appetizer but perfect for a meal as well. Fulfilling and great option choices. Would NOT recommend the newest addition to the menu- waffles and chicken. The sauce and dip are strange in flavor. Way too sweet and a spice that did not compliment well. Wasn't even able to finish the meal. Overall, It's a great fix for a bite to eat."
Mac B.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",18,3,,5.0,10/11/2017,"We eat here frequently. Great ""2for"" deals. Well prepared food with generous portions. Service is great. Would definitely recommend!"
Latte B.,"Ontario, CA",31,83,6,5.0,5/15/2017,"There was a a little wait (15 minutes) to get a clean table, but after we were seated service was prompt and courteous. Amanda suggested the 3 for $10, which had great choices and was a great deal for salad, dinner, and dessert! This was a nicer Chili's, easy to access, with great service and food!"
Christina H.,"Fontana, CA",34,42,10,1.0,3/14/2017,"I ordered car side to go tonight and received one of the worst meals I have had in a long time. I ordered the boneless buffalo chicken salad, the salad looked like it was thrown together with random vegetables that do not go together, I also ordered a side of chips and salsa and the chips were very greasy. I know they are fried, but they were full of oil, I've had there chips plenty of times, but they have never been that oily! It's pretty sad when people do not take pride in what they are serving, specially servers who expect to earn tips, check your expo line and look at your food before you send it out! You would of seen the chips were probably the end of the night batch that sat there for the past 2 hours! The cooks should take pride in what they are preparing, my salad was a soggy mess! Very disappointed, won't be back to this location!"
Janey T.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/30/2017,"Great service tonight! Very friendly, attentive and efficient! Food was great. My chicken salad was a bit spicier than I had anticipated but still good."
