Angelina R.,"Sun City West, AZ",37,64,10,3.0,5/7/2017,"Not really impressed. I usually order to-go. They never have my order ready when it should be. The portions are weak for the price paid and the quality is pretty poor. Asking for them to run coupons or discounts is like pulling teeth when you have to wait an extra 15 minutes while your food gets cold sitting there while someone locates a manager.  More distinctively remembered- the food was all carelessly thrown in cheap styrofoam containers that were melting from the heat of the hot food... the food that WAS hot until having to wait 15 minutes for a manager then the drive home. Applebees has legit quality plastic containers for to-go food. Why doesn't Chilis?? One thing I ordered was a side of grilled asparagus w/ Roma tomatoes & garlic. Sad presentation & portion for almost $10 of a charge! 4 weak, skinny, stringy strands of asparagus w/ 2 tiny bite-size cherry tomatoes and probably 10 pieces of garlic just thrown in a giant styrofoam container. I like garlic, but it was majority of garlic that I paid for. I could have gone & bought my own ingredients for half the cost of what this was.  I can't say anything else I ordered was worth it, either. It is like they bank on no one checking to-go orders before they carelessly throw tiny portions in crappy boxes. For the price paid, it was a ripoff and not worth it when it came to the quality of the food, either. And when you are offering coupons/discounts through email, those should be honored with no question, not having to make customers wait 15+ minutes to find a manager to approve what your company is marketing to begin with.  The least they did that was good was throw in an extra side of queso. Had it not been for that gesture, I probably would have left the food and asked for a refund. Please get your act together. I went to Applebees as an alternative and they blew Chilis out of the water with service, portions, quality & price."
Nan M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,34,14,2.0,11/5/2017,"There was a wait while the host cleared tables so he could seat other guests. Many uncleared tables. When he seated us, I asked the host if their bussers did not show up. He said there are no bussers. the servers are expected to clear the tables. Not sure how they're supposed to get it all done. They need more employees. Nachos were not hot. Were lukewarm. Place did not seem very clean."
Jim G.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,16,2,1.0,8/17/2017,I went to this location at 3PM on a Thursday to grab some food and do some work while I was waiting for my next appointment.  In order to do a little work I needed a booth with a power outlet.  I went into the bar and they said that the only table's with an outlet were in the dinning room.  So I went to the host/waiter and ask for a table with a power outlet.  I was then told that there wasn't a server in that section so I couldn't sit there.  I said that I needed a plug for my computer and that is when I was told that I would probably need to go somewhere else because they can't help me. WOW!! I was surprised they didn't want my business considering there was only like 4 tables sat in the whole restaurant.   So I went to Majerle's instead.
Christina D.,"Avondale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,This restaurant is so dirty. I noticed it the min I walked in. The tables were filled with garbage and the floors were so filled with trash. Then we were seated and I went to wash my hands and had to walk by the kitchen and OMG it was a disaster!!!! Tortilla chips all over the floor and food all over the counter tops. I honestly am calling the manager tomorrow and I will never eat there again.
Dawn G.,"Olympia, WA",10,201,1320,3.0,1/12/2017,"We have dined at several Chili's restaurants and the visits are always just average..... We are never disappointed, but we are never blown away either. This visit was no exception. I was very happy with my meal and drink, the Mr thought his was just so so. He had the Chicken Ranch Sand which with Avocado added. I had the Smothered Smoked Chicken Burrito and thought it was very delicious. It was also huge and I took half home and it heated up great the next day too. The berry margaritas are really great too - I ordered the Triple Berry this time and on another visit the Pineapple Blueberry - both really great. And just like other reviews you will notice I only have pictures of the drinks..... I dig right into the food when it comes and forget photos! Sorry"
Krista S.,"Avondale, AZ",57,26,9,5.0,3/14/2017,Food was really good. but most of all our server Erica was amazing.  attentive and courteous.  she made out lunch amazing.  the food was fresh and delicious. again outstanding service that was really appreciated.  thank you. we will be back!!!
Patricia M.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,9,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Had lunch here yesterday around 3, every thing was fine. Myself, my husband and 4 year old daughter were sat at a both right behind the host stand. The service was great and the food was great at first.  My husband ordered the new chicken strip meal with blue cheese and buffalo sauce. It was cooked well and was crisp. Except it gave him food poisoning, BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN STRIPES. Most of the night and still as I write this he is in the bathroom sick as can be. I'm just greatfull our daughter did not try any of his food. This a really disappoint because we go to chili's about once a month as a treat for our daughter. But now it's not worth the risk of getting sick."
Maria G.,"Evanston, IL",20,11,4,1.0,8/2/2017,"Over the past few months the service has gone to crap! I'm a frequent flier here who loves their food. I had a to go order once and as we came to pick up the order the cook claimed that he made the food but yet it went missing. Today as we sat the server never came and finally I stopped someone after 15 minutes and gave our order, now waiting another 25 minutes considering they're not very busy the appetizers that we ordered wasn't even out yet. Even my child is asking why is it taking so long even though she's occupied playing with the kiosk."
Blake F.,"Southwest Houston, Bellaire, TX",554,12,3,1.0,6/5/2017,Extremely slow service. The servers looked lost as well. Felt bad for the main lady working the bar because the other guy wasn't helping her. What a shame.
Hank W.,"Goodyear, AZ",3,36,15,2.0,6/4/2017,"Service was just bad, food came 40 minutes after ordering and the 2 stars are for another server trying to help and the Manager being genuinely helpful. She was very attentive offered to give my 9 month pregnant sister something while she waited. My sister declined You can just tell our oder sat for a while, fajita was not sizzling and the hamburgers bottom buns were soggy. Just a super disappointing all around experience.BUT my sister's remake food came  fast I have never been to this one but it's close to my house and I'll probably try again with football season on the way. My sister's come here often and say it's never been like this"
Cindy K.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,21,,3.0,5/20/2017,Management needs to review customers feedback and address issues accordingly. We have been coming to this Chili's for years. The food has been hit or miss the last several times and I always leave feedback on the kiosk When we pay our bill. Food portions shrinking and being served lukewarm. Floors dirty and Very few staff members smile. I never see a manager walking the floor checking on customers like at other local restaurants. We will try again in a few months
Gina B.,"Glendale, AZ",34,233,167,3.0,7/11/2016,I'm a regular of chili's but not this location it was actually my first time there. We went at opening and the waiter forgot our appetizer we had to flag someone anyone down for a drink... It was busy but not that busy.. The service was awful. I'll stick to my regular location from now on.
Reese E.,"Surprise, AZ",1,88,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"So sad to be writing this because, we do like going to Chili's... just not at this location. My husband and I decided to stop by at this Chili's yesterday for lunch. The hostess was very nice and sat us down right away. Waited for a few minutes for our waitress. She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, ""I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.""  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them. The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable. At some point, I'm sure we saw the manager attempting to clean a table, but we noticed he left it for someone else to clean up. Will never go back to this location. The hostess should get a raise for all the work she was doing."
Meagan C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,15,2,1.0,9/3/2017,This is the worst Chilis we've ever gone to. We normally try to avoid this location at all costs because we almost always get horrible service. Like just now... sat down waited 15 minutes and one guy looked at me and said oh hold on and walked off. We left!
Amy B.,"Tolleson, AZ",12,28,14,5.0,10/5/2016,"I was shocked to see this chili's only had a three star rating, I have loved this restaurant for years and even remember when it was built.  Anytime in the past that I had an issue and involved the manager it was fixed right away.  On today's visit I received the best service I have ever gotten at a chili's.  Logan was phenomenal. I cannot say enough about his performance or interaction with my son and myself. Chili's never fails to take me to my happy place."
Jessica M.,"Tolleson, AZ",0,5,4,4.0,2/13/2017,Great food nice atmosphere! A good chill place for my family to enjoy. Service was good and waitress was nice. I will definitely return in the future.
Deni G.,"Avondale, AZ",1594,714,1996,3.0,7/16/2014,"Just kind of average .... no surprises  In the land of ubiquitous sit down chains, Chilis could be considred one of the leaders if not the king. On my visit to Chilis I ordered the queso dip and chicken dippers and my friend ordered the half rack of ribs with dry rub and a side order of barbecue sauce. My chicken dippers were somewhat greasy and the queso dip just didn't taste right .  My friends ribs were tasty but not a lot of meat on them. The waitress replaced the chicken dippers and gave me the spinach dip instead of the queso, and it was good.  The meal was definitely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the service, which was quick and friendly."
Britt And Monica G.,"Goodyear, AZ",16,16,,1.0,7/24/2016,Ok that's twice!!!!! We go inside and wait for about 5-10 minutes and NO host/hostess in site. So done with this specific location!!!!!!! Stay away from here there is NO customer service!!!!
Dwight T.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,46,58,1.0,11/11/2015,"Three people asked if we were helped. None of them actually helped. I finally got my name on a text list, after losing several tables. Very frustrating. There is no indication of how you are supposed to get in queue for a table. Really got upset when the lady said she would seat me right away, then the next one said 15 minute wait. The lady that said she would seat us right away just ignored us.  No not coming back. The food is not good enough   They have only service to offer."
Kathy S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2017,"Had a late dinner last night around 9pm.  I ordered the new crispy chicken salad, which I thought from the pic was more like a spring mix (my bad for not asking), but it was mostly iceberg, which was extremely limp & looked pretty bad.  The waitress came back to ask how it was, where I normally wouldn't have even mentioned, I expressed my issues and she left for a minute & came back to replace the meal.  Although she wasn't a bad waitress, had she been an exceptional waitress, she would have asked if I would like the same item or something different, but a while later I received another salad, still with the same lettuce & still not looking great, but better than the first.  I did eat some of the lettuce & most of the chicken.  I paid the bill and went home only to start getting really bad stomach pains & then violently ill for at least a few hours.  Today still not feeling quite back to normal I decided to look up reviews and found someone earlier that day whose husband seemed to have had the same issue.  Don't think I'll be coming back."
Rachael K.,"Surprise, AZ",3,13,1,5.0,3/25/2017,"I have only come here to sit at the bar and watch hockey games. There's been the same bartender, Johnny, and he is all about the customer. We have always been treated attentively, he is on top of keeping the drinks refreshed, food served hot and makes sure everything is above satisfactory. I saw this place had some bad reviews, I can't vouch for anywhere but the bar service, but you will not be disappointed if you choose to sit at the bar. There was another couple sitting close by who made several good comments about the bartender as well. Great attitude, great service and he will make sure you're accommodated. I was watching a game to the side of us, and he changed the channel so I didn't have to watch with my head turned.  Didn't even ask, he just did it. So yep, Johnny is a great bartender/server here. Hope he never quits, my boyfriend and I come back because of the service. The food is good too!"
Glenda E.,"Goodyear, AZ",10,58,49,1.0,9/29/2015,Who charges over $8 for a margarita and only puts in 1.25 ounces of tequila???? CHILI'S!!!!!!!!!  I ask the bartender because the last time we came I did their table survey and mentioned how weak their drinks were. So tonight before I ordered tonight I ask.  Guess I will be drinking water tonight!
Mike M.,"Prescott, AZ",0,34,19,5.0,7/30/2016,Chilis never fails. The food was great and the service was good. I didn't have to ask for one thing and the drinks were refilled with out asking. We went back on 7-30-16 and it was even better than before. The bar staff was amazing and food was fresh off the grill. You can't beat Chili's
Jenny P.,"Surprise, AZ",0,5,1,2.0,3/6/2016,Service was horrible!! Restaurant was VERY dirty! I eat here 5-6 times a month... different one over the valley.... this has been the worst! :(
Thomas S.,"Avondale, AZ",4,52,38,5.0,8/19/2015,"Almost everything was great and enjoyed workout issue, waiters and waitresses always had refills on lock, and the food was made exactly how everyone ordered it.  Some new things I've never seen before like tablets with free games on them for kids were at the tables.  Over all a great restaurant  experience, my family knows we can always count on chili's to deliver."
Richard M.,"Northridge, CA",11,133,4,5.0,3/29/2016,"Excellent service, just went for dinner with the family,  probably the best service even though it was fairly busy,  food was excellent and out server Desiree was great"
Carissa T.,"Avondale, AZ",19,166,71,5.0,4/4/2015,"We had great service!   The fajitas are always good and fresh.   Ribs were fine, beans and rice were fine too. Overall good experience.  Our server was what stood out to be the best of the experience & reason this rating went from 3 to 5 stars."
Jason R.,"Goodyear, AZ",124,1,,2.0,5/12/2016,"We came to Chili's instead of Macoroni Grill because my girlfriend received a gift certificate from her work and we had the choice between the two. Needless to say we made the absolute wrong decision. My girlfriend ordered a 6oz Sirloin with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. I ordered the mix and match combo with a half rack of ribs, steamed broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The ribs were served cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box, and neither one of our steaks had any flavor whatsoever. The best part of the meal was the broccoli, how pathetic is that. The only reason I am giving this place 2 is our Bartender Malissa is a Rockstar! If we ever go back to Chili's it will be to belly up to the bar and drink adult beverages served by Malissa. Great service, terrible food!"
Candice W.,"Tonopah, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/9/2016,Horrible and the worst ever customer service. Took my sister's and mom out on Saturday for dinner and three people walked past us at the door after standing for 10 mins someone asks have u been helped and we said no oh okay I will be right back he comes back and to seat four I have to clean a table we said okay and then the other hostess comes up and we ask her how much longer til we are seated and she takes her Starbucks and ignores us so we decided to walk out she comes back up and say have a great day. Who trains customer service at that place they are horrible and should find a different job
Amber G.,"Phoenix, AZ",863,251,98,1.0,9/14/2015,"I ordered the queso with chips on 09/13/15 at about 6:30pm. I found a french fry in the queso after eating about 5 bites. The server was apologetic and brought another one, and after 2 bites, AGAIN found a fry. Both times our server told the manager (Stan) about it because we could see them, and no one ever came to talk to us or offer any compensation for the situation. I was obviously turned off from the queso and ordered the fried cheddar bites but was charged for them :-(. My family and I have been coming to this location for about 12 years at least once a week and I am not happy about how management said nothing and did nothing about it."
Rich V.,"Avondale, AZ",1,5,2,1.0,12/26/2015,"Weird customer service almost rude, from our greeter to our server, service was mediocre at best. Food  is overpriced and wasn't good , this was our first time in a chili's, we received a gift card for xmas , long story short we won't return ."
Mitchell S.,"Waddell, AZ",37,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,"I typically wont write bad reviews, i just wont return but last night was some of the poorest service ive had in a while. I waited to be sat which i dont mind but then waited a good five minutes or so before even being acknowledged by a server then five more minutes before our actual server arrived still with no drinks. I waited a total of fifteen minutes from the time i sat down with no drinks. From the time i sat down until the time i left, which was close to 2 hours because of absolutely how dreadfully slow the service was, all the tables in view were dirty. And stayed dirty. No wonder i have to wait ten minutes to be sat because no one knows how to table turn. And im sorry but id rather not look at peoples tables the whole time im eating. When the food finally arrived our meals were cold and overcooked and barely palatable. Definitely will not be returning."
Heather B.,"Henderson, NV",143,6,1,1.0,8/28/2015,"We waited 45 mins for a table when they said the wait would be 20-30 mins. Then we ordered food which at an additional 45 mins was still not out. We had a hungry, tired baby that had we gotten seated sooner would have eaten. It was the WORST service we have ever received at chills.  They said the manager would be over....and we never once saw her or him....smiles were great article sucked!!! Don't go here!"
Elissa K.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",22,23,106,5.0,12/13/2014,"Irregardless of the Chilis we go to the food is delicious, hot, & the staff are always very pleasant! Guac. Is def. fresh! I really don't know why Applebee's is still in business with Chilis in business! Btw the guac. Burger & sweet potato fries is the business!!!!"
Maddie G.,"Avondale, AZ",13,38,8,2.0,6/17/2015,"I'm embarrassed I even went here, but I was starving and it was right next to where I was. All I wanted was a burger. This place blows! I got the double cheeseburger lunch combo with salad. My husband got a black bean burger. The salad was tiny and disgusting. My double burgers stacked on top of each other weren't even close to the size of my husband's vegetarian burger! They were so dry and burnt. Worst burger of my life. I can say this with complete honesty: I would have been much more satisfied with McDonalds. That's saying something. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because our server was very friendly."
Pam A.,"Seattle, WA",333,466,5654,2.0,7/22/2014,"When did they get tablets to browse the menus and for payment? What I found strange was the fact that the server was trying to promote unlimited games for I think 99 cents? What happened to the gold old days of having good conversations instead of being tied to technology. The water was pretty bad. We had to order an iced tea to get the taste out of our mouths and even then it wasn't great. The food was mediocre. My go to dish, the country fried steak was overcooked. Our server didn't come by at all to check on us. Was kind of glad we could just close out the bill on the tablets, pay and leave. I don't think the staff would want to hear how unhappy we were overall with the food and lack of service."
Jesse S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",32,26,2,3.0,1/15/2016,I like Chilis and the food never disappoints. The only reason why gave this branch 3 stars is the service. Our waitress must have been having a bad day because she was not too happy to serve us. Needless to say the service really hindered the chance for this Chilis to get a good review.
Rick C.,"Goodyear, AZ",20,2,9,3.0,5/23/2012,"Chili's ""  what can I say.. The foods good, prices are average for grill and bar type restaurant . My wife and I enjoy sitting in the lounge area most of the time because of the fact you can just grab a high top table without waiting. I've been going to this location for a few years now, food always good. The problem is, even when their not busy your sitting there waiting for someone to come over as much for 5 to 10 minutes.  I've seen people get up and walk on more than one occasion for lack of service.  Where's the floor mgr of this place . The servers are friendly enough when their there but they pull more disappearing acts than Houdini.   This has been a consistent problem at this location. (bar area) They just recently did an inside and outside makeover which really looks great and chic (New York style)  really cool!! Ok""  Iam being nit picky here, but they took the high top table in the far corner And  replaced it with Handicap table, although I totally agree with the need for handicap tables , I cannot understand the placement of this one.  I've seen handicap patrons trying to maneuver through the high tops trying to get to this table.  Like an obstacle course.   Wouldn't it make more sense to locate this table to the entrance of the lounge for easier access for the handicap, for safety reasons?"
Lola M.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",5,156,64,2.0,7/8/2015,"I came in with my boys. The chips and salsa are good. I am a creature of habit here and usually order the salad and chili. The chili was horrible on this visit. It had a soup like consistency. It was gross. I prefer local, family owned restaurants, to chains. I am not sure that I will be back."
Luciana L.,"Buckeye, AZ",77,771,40,3.0,9/30/2012,"Compared to other Chili's, I think it deserves 4 stars.  Then again, I haven't gone to a Chili's in a long time.  I saw a sign as I was walking in that they've made changes to the decor.  Looks nice!!   Chili's food in general compared to other foods?  I gave it 3 stars.  I've never had chili from Chili's so I thought I'd give it a try.  Meh.  We got their 3 appetizer as well and it was yummy.   Overall, I'd say if you like Chili's, I think this one is great.  If you are a Chili's fan, you're not missing out.  Simple as that."
