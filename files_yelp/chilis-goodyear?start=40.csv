Frank R.,"Goodyear, AZ",28,5,1,5.0,9/4/2015,"Will have to say , been here a lot for date night and the one night we had a problem,  Mgr ""Wendy"" handled it and fixed everything and they been doing real good ever since.  Thanks to this location tonight for pick up the slack that the location on 75 ave is lacking and in tell they get their game on this well be the place ..."
Judy L.,"Avondale, AZ",440,1127,1324,4.0,9/16/2012,"Came with appetizers and soup.  Just wanted to munch on something small.  The tables were so close, I had to have my husband move the table so I can breathe.  The server was good.  The food was good.  Got the trio-sampler:  Southwest eggrolls, chicken wings, and potato skin.  I got the chicken enchilda soup."
Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1514,1940,1.0,3/25/2014,"Not a great lunch at usually reliable Chili's. They have these lunch combo deals, but most aren't full servings and the prices are either $6-$8.  The choices are limited and my first choice was unsuccessful. I would skip the opening salad and go for soup because the salad was dreadful with the croutons being the highlight. I had to return the new Chipotle Chicken Bowl thingy because the strips of chicken were full of fat and this was one of the worst renditions of a bowl meal, plus it wasn't even in a bowl. Anyway, I went for the $6 BLT and that was two strips of bacon, shredded lettuce and one tomato on the ole pretzel bun (it is half a sandwich). The fries were good and Melissa was a nice bartender, but no more lunch at Chili's, even though the price was only $6.50 total."
Michael C.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2016,"this is the second time that the food and service were seriously lacking. I used to come in here a lot, but quality and service have been suffering. Three months ago I went in with my mother and aunt and it took almost an hour for the food to be delivered and when it was served it was clearly cold. The manager gave it to us for free. Today I was craving the steak and asparagus meal that is topped with shrimp. It took almost 40 minutes to get to me and the only thing hot was the skillet and the burnt asparagus. Steak was over cooked and cold. Even had a nice lady next to me say that she hoped I hadn't ordered the steak well done. Nope it was supposed to be medium rare.  Manager came by and offered 50% off meal. I told him I would pay full price and actually left him half of the meal. I figured first time was their mistake, and second time was mine. To make it worse, a couple came in 10 minutes after me and was served their third course ten minutes before I received my cold meal.  And since I was raised to give good and bad together when possible, I will say that the beer was cold, but since Applebee's is around the corner, I will try them in the future."
Corey Tess T.,"Anaheim, CA",752,647,636,3.0,12/18/2011,"I really don't have much to say about this one, but if you are going to the movie theater that is located in the same center, it is a good place to grab a drink or a bite. I take my niece on our ""girls day out"" movie trips here for lunch and she enjoys it.  I usually have a grilled chicken salad and she always has a pizza, so I can't really say that I have tried what they are famous for.. since I don't eat pork, but the atmosphere is always high energy and the servers are usually pretty good and fast."
Christopher S.,"San Francisco, CA",333,12,3,1.0,7/29/2013,"Went for lunch and sat in the bar area.  The Good:  Cleanliness was good and service was above average. So far so good... The Bad:  Ordered Fajitas Trio with no beans or rice, as I have ordered countless times at other Chili's. Order came out in a timely manner.... but the food was simply terrible. My stomach churns just remembering it.  So for those who don't know, Fajitas Trio is chicken, steak and shrimp on a hot skillet with sliced onions and bell peppers.  First, the chicken came out with no grill marks, looking like a frozen breast that somebody had thrown into some hot water to cook. Zero grill marks.. I mean, can we at least PRETEND it was grilled? Isn't it supposed to sizzle like in the commercials? The chicken didn't even get grilled on the hot skillet! Which brings me to the skillet... it wasn't hot! How are you going to serve fajitas with a lukewarm skillet? Booo! Get outta here Chilis!  The onions and bell peppers looked (and tasted) like they had been pulled from the freezer too since they had no crunchiness at all.  Shrimp is obviously frozen (this is AZ after all).  The pico de gallo, guac and shredded lettuce all looked a few days past their best by date.  You know how good things are more than a sum of their parts? This was LESS than a sum... each item was bad but collectively, it was a terrible meal especially at the price point ($15!). So maybe my memory has failed and the food was always this bad, but something tells me that this was an exceptionally poor representation.  My friend ordered an appetizer sampler and said the sliders were meh (only ate one) as were the egg rolls.  Summary: low quality food, poor preparation. Don't go here, try any other restaurant!"
Rich P.,"Avondale, AZ",11,85,15,1.0,3/31/2015,2 weeks later no response from the corporate office was told the area manager would contact me and hasn't. Do yourself a favor there are many other places to eat in the area go to any of them!
Tanner R.,"Claremore, OK",25,30,15,5.0,8/19/2013,Upon first arrival we noticed Brooklyn and her magnificent hair! Our server Michael was handsome and polite. We started off with the caso dip and chips.  SO very delicious.
Nora V.,"Tolleson, AZ",371,495,151,3.0,4/15/2013,It's a Chili's. Food is consistant with the others & clean. Go for happy hours to save some moolah.
Wayne W.,"Goodyear, AZ",7,80,1,4.0,2/6/2015,"Stopped in here last night for someplace different than our usual places. I tried the new craft burger and she had a mexican salad of some kind. She really liked the salad and the Smoke House burger was pretty good a bit on the overcooked and dry side. They never asked how I wanted the burger cooked so I thought I would see what they would do. The fries were good and portioned perfect, thanks for not dumping a plateful as I probably would eat em all.."
Jeff C.,"Avondale, AZ",13,22,,1.0,7/23/2014,"Where to start....1) we were sat by the bathroom where all you can smell is the urinal cakes. 2) our server seemed like he couldn't get rid of us fast enough, basically throwing things on the table as he ran by yo all his other tables. 3) our food was terrible and apparently they think more with less means you pay MORE for LESS food. 4) the automatic pay machine was a nice touch until it automatically suggested a 20% tip, not going to happen. 5) we won't be back the best part of the evening was leaving."
Joanne L.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,24,2,4.0,4/27/2015,"I love this chilis! We come in all the time, the queso is the best thing I've ever had, no lie!!! The waiters are really friendly, I just only have 4 stars because the mangers seemed rude and demeaning."
James A.,"Avondale, AZ",9,99,42,3.0,5/22/2014,"Can't get enough of the Fajitas. Very yummy, beers are always cold and on point. Your typical corporate restraunt chain. Get the same no matter where you go. I always stop in when I'm indecisive on what I want to eat, so my fall back is Chili's.  Yum."
Misty M.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",123,40,29,2.0,9/3/2014,Tableside guacamole is a must!!! Have been coming here for a while and keep trying different things on the menu but havent found anything that is absolutely amazing other than the guac. The servers are very nice but the manager could be heard yelling at a staff member while he was in the kitchen.   This is your average chain restaurant with nothing that really stands out.
Sardine B.,"Surprise, AZ",0,57,37,2.0,3/26/2014,The food wasn't bad but the waitress wasn't good. She forgot my daughters juice we ordered with the kids meal and her utensils. We didn't get a sauce on the side we ordered. Also she didn't bring us a bag to put all our to go boxes in when we were done and there were a lot of to go boxes so it was difficult to take them out. On the way out we had to ask for one cause one was popping open and about to fall. She then asked us to do a review of her saying she was great at her job so she can get more tables but the place wasn't busy and she already wasn't doing too good. -UPDATE we went back and the same chick forgot the drink with the kids meal again...
Kristen R.,"Peoria, AZ",8,54,16,3.0,6/11/2014,First time going to this particular chilis. Seems about the same as any other except they were out of veggie burgers. First time that's happened in many years of ordering it at every chilis I've ever been to. Not a great first impression.
Stacey H.,"Irvine, CA",81,210,13,2.0,11/13/2012,"It's Chili's I didn't go in with overwhelming expectations but we were hungry and wanted something quick.  Service was very slow, food came out a bit cold.  It felt like it was sitting on the warmer for a while because the food was cold in the middle but the plates where really warm.  This was especially surprising since there were 2 people working our area but only a few other tables had anyone sitting there. Overall we won't be back, but in all honesty it's not a regular stop for us anyway."
Eloise O.,"Orange, CA",83,102,111,3.0,12/1/2012,"Clean, Friendly Servers & a great Lunch deal. I ordered soup & half sandwich... The food came out rather quickly, which was nice since I only have a n hour lunch.  It was a bit slow, but maybe it was just because Thanksgiving was around the corner."
Bridget A.,"Goodyear, AZ",42,113,263,3.0,12/1/2013,"It had been several years I haven't gone to this restaurant because I became a vegetarian. What drove me to come back was the coronarita. It was not as good as I was was expecting. Mostly sweet and sour mix with a beer in it. But their happy hour prices were really good. Overall, a C grade"
Robert S.,"Littleton, NH",44,48,,2.0,1/28/2013,"Uhg. I have not gone to Chili's in a few years. The service is poor, food is so-so, and priced a bit high for what you're getting. And recently I tried them again.. they are consistently disappointing. Waited 15 minutes after sitting for drinks. Waited 40 minutes to order. Received food 1hr 15min after sitting. My burger was good but the onion rings were cold and mushy. Will not be back. For the record, I like Fridays, Red Robin, and Applebees."
