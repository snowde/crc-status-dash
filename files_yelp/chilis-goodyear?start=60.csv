Autumn B.,"Goodyear, AZ",40,5,,1.0,1/2/2015,"My fiancé and I went to dinner here the other night.  We usually love coming here,  but this was the second time our visit and dinner was less than appetizing. We were rushed to order our appetizer and dinner along with our drinks,  the chips were extremely salty and our fries for both of our dinners were stale and cold. When brought more fries the same thing.  Our server treated us as though we were ruining her day.  Sad to say, we will not be coming back to this location!"
Chad R.,"Goodyear, AZ",123,87,143,4.0,9/28/2013,"I don't usually go to chain restaurants, but sometimes when you want a menu with variety you have to. This Chili's location is an exception. The food could be horrible and I'd still go for one not so simple reason, the bartender. He has the Cheers vibe. For those of you whipper snappers who don't know the Cheers reference, Google it. The bartender always remembers us even if it has been over a year. He's loyal and has a knack for knowing what subject to converse about. A great bartender can change the way food tastes. Keep up the great work Toby."
Mak I.,"Florence, AZ",0,22,,3.0,9/20/2012,"Maybe this isn't my week because this is the 2nd time in as many days that I've eaten out and encountered substandard help from the staff but this time the customer to staff ratio really made it ludicrous that I'm having to point this out. I walked into this location around 3pm, aside from me there was 1 customer at the bar and 1 table I was customer # 3. Right when I walked in I went to the restroom to wash up and when I came back I found the hostess stand empty.  As I had walked back to the bathroom there was a pair of the wait staff eating in the back customer table by the bathrooms and exit, don't bother to look up and say hi or anything they just kept on doing their thing.  After leaving the restroom I passed 1 table occupied by a female manager that faced the front door, she was busy in paperwork but also oblivious to the fact that someone was standing there, waiting to be seated only 15 feet directly in front of her, not once did she look up or she would have called someone or taken care of it herself.  From the hostess stand you see directly into the bar area, 1 customer was seated at the bar, 2 employee's were sitting at the booth directly line of sight from the hostess station, they glanced over several times and made no attempt to ask if I needed something.  After 3 minutes (I know this because I was counting 30 second commercials on ESPN) the bartender finally poked her head up and asked me if I needed anything, yes I'd like to be seated and have lunch.  I won't rip her too badly because I sat in her section and she did take care of me well, to the point where I left her a 5 dollar tip, however the fact that 5 front room staff who were only taking care of 4 customers couldn't see it fit to take 10 seconds and do what they are supposed to do almost had me walking out.  The food is basic Chili's, honestly never really had a bad meal there but it's important to point out that even with a manager a few feet away and an empty restaurant, I was left hanging, almost walked out and once that happens, it will be a long time before I come back... there are too many choices in a small area and Chili's is not exactly the best of the best of them."
Eyezola G.,"Surprise, AZ",17,45,1,1.0,11/28/2011,"""MEthinks not?""  NO!! I KNOW NOT!!  This Chili's will not get another dollar from my pocket.   I have given them 3 and 4 chances and it NEVER gets better.  Every meal has come to me cold.  The drinks.....BAD. Even desert sucked.  I am a very fair person and I have given them the last chance.   The service is even lacking......the servers spend more time playing with each other rather than doing their jobs.  It is more than frustrating to hear that your food is up and they are giggling about the GREAT time they had the night before in the club's bathroom with some random guy.   While I enjoy a great ""club bathroom sex story"" like the next girl....I would prefer that I had hot GOOD food while I am hearing about it and trying to explain to my 10 year old that it IS NOT OK to do that!!  LMFAO!! Again.....don't waste your money, time, or taste buds on this particular Chili's.BUT!!!  If you are looking for a good time story and cold ass shrimp this is the place for you!"
William P.,"Montclair, CA",259,235,,4.0,11/15/2010,"In my own mind, I have something of a three-tiered system.  For restaurants that try to be top quality, that's one tier.  For sit-down chain restaurants, that's another tier.  And then for fast food restaurants, that's another tier entirely. Yesterday we ate at this Chili's; that would be a tier two kind of place.  For that tier, they have to beat Denny's.  Chili's manages that very well. Yesterday, I had this soup that was new to me, a sweet corn soup, which I found to be excellent; I followed it with their standard bacon cheeseburger, which they overcooked a bit.  Edible.  I'm not fond of their french fries, though.  I think that they taste like they'd been frozen and then fried.  Overall, for me it was a good experience. OTOH, my wife wasn't at all happy with her sandwich which consisted of steak in a pita roll; her meat was burned. Comparing to Denny's, this was much better.  Comparing to the meal that we'd had the night before at a gourmet restaurant, this was much worse.  So, there you are."
Jenny S.,"Tempe, AZ",87,59,47,4.0,9/19/2013,Great service from the bar staff!  Happy hour at Chili's in Goodyear is fun even before the drinks are consumed.  Toby and Rebecca are awesome and there are two others that provide great service; however I cannot recall their names. Service in the dining room was so so the last time that I had it.
Shelley M.,"Phoenix, AZ",135,290,591,4.0,6/3/2013,"We often go to enjoy the happy hour specials, but even the 2 for $20 meal deal is good. Free chips and salsa and good cold beer keep us coming back. The only issue I had on most recent visit was because I ordered a house margarita that tasted awful. So bad in fact I could not finish it...that must be bad! We love the Texas Cheese Fries and the chips are delish. Next time I will be sticking to the ice cold beer!"
Jo Marie S.,"Phoenix, AZ",70,45,36,3.0,9/2/2012,"Meehh...this place is aiight. Came here for happy hour only to be disappointed by their limited selection. Even the beers are are scarce. If I were you, I would walk across the lot and go to Fridays. At least they have IPA there."
Charles G.,"Surprise, AZ",27,11,14,1.0,12/13/2012,Service is very slow.  Took over 15 minutes before our server ever came out
Dina S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,2,,5.0,11/23/2014,"I never leave this place unsatisfied! Always right on the money with service, taste and quality. Love the chips and salsa, loaded potato soup and the fajitas! Great happy hour prices as well. The food is consistant at every location I visit. Love the dinner and drinks for 2 as well! Our server Alex was super friendly and made us feel welcomed and comfortable throughout our stay."
Moni Z.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,24,2,5.0,5/28/2013,Good size margaritas with plenty of alcohol for $3.99 during happy hour!!! Doesn't get better than that...
Stephanie S.,"Mohave, AZ",35,28,3,2.0,7/16/2012,Its Chilis and you know what you are getting before you walk thru the door.  I like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad.  I had to wait for my soup because they were making more and when I did get it...well it was so watery that I didnt eat it.  My salald was good.  Sat in the bar and the batender was friendly.
Greg P.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,51,,4.0,4/10/2012,"How do you review a National chain like this? The food is...well, Chili's. If you like eating at other Chili's you will like this (duh). I give it four stars because it is very nice on the inside and not nearly as tacky as most other Chili's, the atmosphere is cool and modern."
Paulette W.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,1,,4.0,7/8/2011,My family loves Chili's. The food is always fabulous and the service is great. The employees are always friendly and eager to serve the customers. It is always a delicious experience for our taste buds when
Joyce M.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,11,,1.0,12/22/2012,"If I never want to sit in a Chili's for 3 hours I won't go to this location anymore. Only 3 of us. 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants. The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way. Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said ""Oh, you'll have plenty to eat"" Well, he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff. Then he told us we needed cocktails. Uh, no we wanted sodas/tea. He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins. I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it. We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited. It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others. We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal. it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it. Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills. When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake. We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing. He's had the darn thing before!  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money. I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever. Then he came over complaining about ""Women""! and something about seeing the movie ""The Hobbit"" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $.70  Hello, I'm a woman and I want to see the movie!  I would have paid $7.70 to get the heck out of there.  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them. ICK!  I do have to say the food was good though. Also hot so at least we got that part."
