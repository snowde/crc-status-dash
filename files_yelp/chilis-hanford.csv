Alexis M.,"Lemoore, CA",0,23,2,5.0,7/13/2017,"Definitely love this location. Wasn't a huge fan of chilis until I started going to this one, the servers are very attentive, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."
Manny M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/7/2017,Worst service in Hanford. Sadly  Hostess on his phone .. server ignoring us ... It takes them 20 minutes to realize they haven't taken  our order... smh never again
Mark L.,"Visalia, CA",9,113,59,4.0,5/15/2017,The Hanford Chili's is great for lunch. I usually get there before noon to avoid the crowd. Even when I show up at the noon lunch hour the restaurant can handle the flow of people.  The lunch menu has a decent amount of choices. The food is good and shows up in a timely manner. You can definitely eat here on a lunch hour.  This restaurant is in a mall parking lot so plenty of parking. The parking lot next to the restaurant has kind of crazy shape. Can't believe someone was paid to design it.  The staff is always helpful and my ice tea never ran empty. Good choice for a lunch time meal.
Julie L.,"Visalia, CA",101,10,3,1.0,9/19/2017,"Poor Service in the bar. Ordered bottomless soup/salad for lunch. Waitress brought both at same time, never refilled my water cup, never asked if I wanted refills on soup or salad. The only time she returned is to give me my receipt. I was the only female at the bar amongst men. The men were catered to."
Rocio M.,"Reedley, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Food was below average. Service was horrible, our waitress Amanda was horrible we had to ask for silverware and napkins on several occasion before they were brought out to us. It wasn't even a busy night and everyone seemed so rushed and like they could care less. Definitely will not be coming here again thanks to subpar service even from a chain restaurant"
Spoon Z.,"Hanford, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/14/2017,"I have been to this place about 5x or so and each time was not pleasant. Unfortunately it was the the wait staff. At one visit the bus boy was actually taking care of us because we were being neglected lol. Every Time I went it was not my idea, but rather what the majority decided. Last time I was there we ended up leaving after about 15 mins of sitting there without anyone coming to get drink orders, and this was in the bar on down time."
Jay M.,"Galt, CA",19,61,,5.0,11/2/2017,"Went there tonight for dinner. We were greeted at the door, seated right away. Our server came right away and got our drinks. Took our order, food came out cook to order and hot. She checked back with us several times, very friendly. The ribs fell off the bone, very tender, will definitely order them again. Had their chips and salsa, one of my favs. Overall a great experience."
Matt M.,"Fresno, CA",42,436,48,1.0,11/21/2016,Went here to celebrate the old bday and sat down at the bar area and waited for 10 minutes and no one bothered to help us. As we were getting up to leave the server comes up and blows us off when she sees we're not staying.  Its not like they were very busy either. Maybe they should have spent the money they wasted on the remodel on some training or hiring a decent staff.
Dominique S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,12,11,2.0,7/28/2017,"Went to Chili's for a family dinner and I was not impressed. I was actually disappointed. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out and half of my party didn't receive there food for another 10 minutes. I ordered a simple meal, loaded potato soup and a house salad. Soup came out room temperature, and the salad looked like someone threw it on the floor and pick it back up and put it on the plate. Hopefully they were just having an off day and that the service isn't like that all the time."
Jon C.,"Glen Ellen, CA",0,131,,1.0,4/22/2017,"A couple of months ago, I had a late Sunday lunch with a friend.  When we arrived (about 1:45), the restaurant was about 75% full, there was one family in the waiting area and no one else in line.  There were at least 10 empty tables, about half were clean and ready.  The hostess was having a personal conversation with a guest, obviously a friend.  We waited almost 10 minutes (no exaggeration) for the hostess to even acknowledge us and finally - as politely as we could - interrupted their conversation to ask if we could add our name to the wait list.   The hostess sniffed at us, added our name and went right back to her personal conversation.   Another hostess came out and checked the waiting list.  She then helped buss more tables before coming back to seat us.  Once seated, our waitress was fairly attentive.  It took almost 15 minutes for our order to arrive.  Our meals were OK, but the portions were on the small side and the taste was nothing to rave over. Now, I understand that the staff was coming off the Sunday brunch rush, but the lack of professionalism displayed by the hostess staff really ruined our visit.  I'm not a Chili's fan and this visit reinforced why.  My friend, who lives in the area, said she would never be back."
Danny G.,"Avenal, CA",0,8,4,5.0,7/24/2016,"Don't listen to the other bad reviews, those people are just very picky honestly This Chilis is Great! They have awesome service, delicious food and a relaxing atmosphere.. Maybe those commenting bad reviews were being snobby so they got bad service or something but I come here a lot with My Girlfriend and My Family and We Love It! I recommend it here, when you Tryna sit and eat come to This 's!!"
Demetrius O.,"Salinas, CA",208,4,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"Where do I start? The server was good. That was about it. The place was empty, yet we waited over an hour for the food. 3 adults, 1 child. We ordered 3 salads and a macaroni and cheese. It seriously took over an hour to get that order. When we did, the lettuce was soggy on both mine and my wife's, my chicken was cold; like the salads had been sitting around for a while. We did not eat them and were not charged for them. I was charged for the other 2 meals. So basically I waited an hour to pay to spend another half hour watching 2 other people eat."
Thomas P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",17,14,11,5.0,2/18/2017,Had to try the smokehouse combo. Been awhile since I been here. Enjoy the new additions. Service is excellent. Could not find a gripe if I tried. Oh yeah the food was excellent.
Elda L.,"Hanford, CA",11,13,6,4.0,8/28/2016,"I like this place. I'm a pescaterian so I usually order the fish tacos which are amazing. But today I tried the shrimp tacos, and they were very good. I usually swap out the flour tortillas for corn but today I forgot. Flour were still good but they do taste better with corn. Had very good service as well and my water cup was always filled... I like that."
Deziree T.,"Silverdale, WA",0,16,6,2.0,3/23/2016,"The experience I had today was just...awful. My sister and I went here for lunch today. We ordered the Triple Dipper appetizer, with the cheese curds, onion rings, and the fried pickles. The only decent part of that appetizer was the onion rings. The cheese curds were so salty. The fried pickles were practically inedible. The brine from the pickles was already salty, and it was covered in a salty batter. We could not eat those. We received a platter of chips and salsa. The chips were decent, but the salsa tasted like tomatoes straight from a can. No flavor. Our entrees took a while to get to us. Turns out, the server forgot to input our entree order into the system. When we did get it, it was ok. We both ordered the quesadilla lunch combo. While the quesadillas were ok, they desperately needed a dip. We didn't receive one for our meals. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars was because our server was so kind and helpful. Even though she made a mistake, she was still so nice and polite. She was working so hard already. Otherwise, I don't see myself returning to this place. The experience was extremely disappointing."
Jana E.,"Seaside, CA",5,8,4,1.0,10/9/2016,"During football season they won't show baseball playoff games. They will have 2 TVs next to each other showing the same football game but they won't any show baseball, very disappointing"
Alei C.,"Hanford, CA",2,57,9,5.0,3/5/2016,"I don't understand the bad reviews, I have always had a great experience here. The service is definitely 5 stars- the waiters and waitresses are always nice and on top of drinks and whatnot.  The food is also 5 star. Last time, I got a steak and it was melt-in-your mouth. The 2 people eat for $20 isn't a bad deal either.  Also, the little trivia games they have at the table are always so much fun for date night.  I am definitely starting to become a regular here."
Elisa P.,"Bonner, MT",1,11,9,1.0,2/24/2016,"I don't even know where to start with this place ugh. When my family and I first started coming here it was great I would say in the last 8 months it's went downhill.  Last time we were there we had the most forgetful server in the world. Drinks took 15 minutes to get out. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with our chips and salsa. 20 minutes later we finally get the chance to ask again about it. He obviously forgot. Ok so we're waiting and waiting.... Finally 45 minutes later the manager comes out to apologize that the pasta is taking awhile to cook and that is the delay in our food (I'm not dumb I know the server forgot to ring it in). We asked her if we can at least have our salads we ordered. She brought those our promptly. 10 minutes later we finally ask the host to have them just to put our food Togo cause it was getting late. No problem. We get home, daughters hungry. Go to get her food it's not there. Looked at the receipt and our very forgetful server never even rang her food up. This was the third time in a row getting horrible service so why did I go back today? Well the manager left me some coupons so I thought I would just do Togo order. Not much better.  Got online to place my Togo order. Did all my modifications for the burgers asked for salads etc.....  My email stated it would be ready at 12:04. Cool that was easy. Get there at 1205. There was a lady ahead of me that had already been waiting. Shortly after my arrival a gentleman comes in and waits. Long story short we were all there an additional 25 minutes. Finally get the food when I realized they game me fries instead of salads so once again had to wait for the salads.  Get home and what a disappointment. My Togo box was all melted obviously been under the heat lamps for awhile. I asked for extra mayo for my husbands burger.... Had none! My burger was so cold and the bun was hard (from being under the heat lamps for so long) that I had to get a different bun from home and put the whole thing in the microwave. I asked for no onions... What did they do pilled them high. There were no homemade pickled like they promote and to top it off..... My bacon was not even on my burger it was off to the side. They obviously forgot to even put it on there. Oooooo let me tell you the gentleman that was also waiting for his Togo was MAD!  You probably wonder why I don't call and say something, what good would it do. I have had to talk to management over the last 2 visits did no good plus I don't want them to think I'm just complaining. Trust me I normally don't say anything unless it's really bad and I always give credit where it is due."
April T.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,8,3,1.0,11/15/2016,"Horrible, went to eat a nice early dinner with my family at about 2:30 and sat at the door for over 5min. Another couple ahead of us sat themselves and we still waited. The guy looked right at us an ignored us. We were trying to give the restaurant a second chance and they failed us again. WONT BE BACK Thank you Applebee's got sat immediately GREAT FOOD"
Spaulding A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,54,,3.0,7/3/2016,"Well, it's Chili's, right? I hadn't eaten in one in about a thousand years, and I needed a place to (1) have lunch and (2) watch Italia play in Euro 2016. 5 stars for big TVs all around the bar! Yay suburbia! I guess the service must be hit and miss, because all the servers at the bar on a Saturday afternoon were polite and attentive. So, not sure what happened to others with reviews here. It's Chili's, right? You don't really need a sommelier to assist you, or a coat check, or... Anyway, the man and woman behind the bar floated by just enough to ask if I wanted something else but were not pesky as places can be when you try to watch a game.  The chicken with beans and rice I had was fine; the chicken in particular had been marinated in lime or brined, or both, and was cooked just right. The rice and beans were... ok. I had a salad that was iceberg lettuce with some flavorless (not very good cotijo maybe?) cheese and a mediocre dressing.  So, in closing, this is an outpost of a casual chain restaurant, and I was glad to find it this weekend."
Lena J.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,2.0,3/26/2017,I would give more stars however when I come and want ribs they NEVER have them. Chilis are known for their baby back ribs.. so I'm not impressed   Chilis Baby back ribs
Stphxx ..,"Hanford, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Walked into the restaurant after just watching a movie from the Hanford mall around 10pm. As my friends and I walked into restaurant to celebrate a birthday, the waiter walked right by us and walked to the back, we didn't think much of it and waited and extra 8 minutes just so he can come back and say 'I'll be with you in a second', and came back after 10 minutes. So basically almost a total of 20 minutes just to get seated (Btw the restaurant was not busy at this time). The waiter then grabs the menus and seated us right next to the door, and my friend (birthday girl) kindly asked if we can be seated in a booth, he then replies and says 'no sit here' and walked away. We did not hesitate to walk up an leave to Applebee's instead, in which we immediately got seated with a friendly employee, and got a very energetic and nice waiter to start us with drinks. Overall, felt very disrespected at Chilis, and wouldn't want to come to this specific location.  (Tip for the manager : Make your customers want to come back by feeling welcomed, first impressions are key.)"
Linda M.,"Hanford, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/25/2017,When we arrived it was backed lots of people on a Friday night. But even at that I had a party of five and we only had to wait 10-15 minutes and the service was great.
Marketa D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,12,8,5.0,1/22/2016,"What a pleasant surprise!  We just had lunch here, and we were very impressed. Our waitress Cassandra was great! Quick, attentive, nice, knowledgable,  and she recommended some awesome food. I had the mango chile chicken and my husband had Cajun chicken pasta from the 2 for $20 menu. The food was delicious, big portions, and once again, GREAT service.  Way better than the experience we had at Applebee's! If you are in the mood a good, quick bite to eat in Hanford, Chilli's is the place to go."
Janice E.,"Coalinga, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/5/2017,I've never had better service. My food was delicious.  It's my second visit and it was just has good the first time. I will return.
Linda I.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,1,5.0,7/8/2016,"Wow! Chilis Hanford has really made a change for the positive... Great food... I had the boneless buffalo wings and the new peach margarita...super delicious! Great service by Christa, and everything was really clean including the restrooms... This place is definitely back on my list of go-to eateries."
Michelle C.,"Lemoore, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/19/2016,Worse service ever!  Have given this Chilis SO MANY chances.  Every single time - they disappoint.  To-go service is always met with long waits and inaccurate orders....  and inside service is not much better.  We had not been there in over 2 years but decided to go there again tonight to give it a try....  same disappointing service and attitude!  Although the area has few choices for eateries - if this is your only choice - eat in!  Top Ramen would be a better option!  We will never return.....  I should add-I did call the manager to complain-who did not care either!  Classic!
Kristin A.,"Hanford, CA",17,16,,4.0,7/27/2016,"Don't go on a Friday night or a Saturday night. The wait times are the worst and the waiting area is extremely small. The food is ok. Drinks are good there, the bartender usually does a good job. Most people go to watch the games and unwind from the work week."
Charlotte R.,"Hanford, CA",2,3,,5.0,7/17/2016,"Had an overall great experience everything was delicious and prepared the way we asked and our server was Betty and she is amazing!!! Possibly the best server we have ever had attentive, fast, and friendly!!!"
Sterling U.,"Newport News, VA",3,45,18,2.0,5/5/2015,Took  forever to be seated.  Our chips were stale and the salsa was warm like it had been returned and left sitting out until we ordered them. My burger was cold as well. I would not come back. This was my third time here and even if it isn't busy the hostess sucks. First time there was no line and it took 4 minutes for her to even look at us the another 2 for a server to come over and ask if we had been helped. I was hoping that it was a one time screw up but nope. Really disappointed
Anthony T.,"Hanford, CA",33,106,403,3.0,3/25/2014,Ate here wife the wife this past weekend. Didn't really have too high of expectations. Bcz my last visit was forgettable.  But I thought hey. Let's see if anything has changed.  We were greated promptly and seated in a timely manner. It's wasn't very busy so go figure. The server was pleasant and got us our drinks. On the table was some kinda iPad?  U got me. The server never bothered to tell us abt it. After messing with it I found u could order and pay ur bill. Wow what a concept. Except I'm sure some one is now out of work due to the self serve format.  So we ordered. I got the Smokehouse Big Mouth Bacon Burger and my wife got some Mexican enchilada dish. Which she loved by the way.  The burger was very good. However where the hell was the bacon!? Dam they used to put two big ass slabs of bacon on this thing. That's the whole reason for ordering it.  Yea there was some bacon. But paper thin and not what it used to be.  Never the less. I have to say it was tasty and I did enjoy it. It was nice and messy the way it's supposed to be. I see these lame assed reviews abt how a burger was soggy and all that BS. Hey dumbass. A juicy burger is gonna be messy and the bun might get soggy.  Would love to give Chilis 4 or 5 stars. But skimping on food is just not right. So 3 stats is as good as it gets.
Sandra G.,"Lemoore, CA",0,10,2,1.0,12/9/2016,"I do not recommend this place they how the rudes waiters I went on my birthday and my waitress treated me so bad just because I asked her an iced tea came sweeten (because they dont sweeten iced tea in some restaurants) that's why I had asked before ordering iced tea the waitress gave me the dirtiest look rolled her eyes and said ""iced tea is sweet"" yes I will say they name of this waitress her name is NICOLE"
Maria R.,"Visalia, CA",41,11,21,2.0,6/28/2015,"Just two of us and couldn't seat us in a two seater in the dining areas so we got a long table and the greeter said ""the place is closed off"" which I had seen vacant two-seater booths. Anyway, the server was great took out drink order and our food order boom! That's awesome. Also you can tell nobody knows where the broom is or chooses not to clean up. Very dirty floor."
Laura F.,"Hanford, CA",7,182,325,3.0,6/15/2015,"They keep the room temp pretty cool so if you chill easily bring a sweater . An extra star for them today because when they noticed me trying to watch the game showing in the sports bar area, they switched the channel on the TV closest to me so I could watch the game in comfort. I had the classic rib eye and it was perfectly cooked. Skillet mashed potatoes were on the rubbery side so ask for a baked potato. Broccoli was tender yet not over cooked. For Chilis this was one of my more positive experiences. Waitress Stacey was attentive and very friendly kept my drink glass full.  Even though I was done eating and paid my tab, they were very willing to allow me to same old thing and relax and finish watching the baseball game. Based on this visit, I would be willing to return for another visit."
Brandon B.,"Oakhurst, CA",8,76,31,5.0,1/21/2015,"Katie, the barkeep, one of the best.  Had just visited Applebee's across the parking lot and the staff here was a lot more friendly and welcoming. Early happy hour, huge TV wall, and overall clientele seemed a bit more hip...needless to say, I'd come back."
Kenwood G.,"Kenwood, CA",42,306,94,4.0,8/23/2013,"Appx. August 12, 2013 - We hurried in for a late light dinner at the bar.   The bar tendress with the long ponytail was OUTSTANDING.  Pleasant, efficient, totally on the ball.  The place was busy and she handled it with total grace.   We stopped in again the same week with the same results from the same staff."
Regina T.,"Lemoore, CA",0,21,29,2.0,3/12/2015,"Seated quickly and greeted promptly by our server,  C*****. She was sweet but her service was not very good at all.  I ordered a cup of soup as soon as we ordered our drinks but never got it until I asked a second time.  My husband didn't get his salad until after his main course was delivered,  which he prefers it beforehand. I had to ask for our coffee to be refilled and she never came back to check on us once our food was served. Aside from the poor service and lukewarm coffee,  the food was decent."
C M.,"Morro Bay, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Very disappointed in Chili's now. Ordered boneless wings, received cold chicken breast nuggets. Quality and service has really gone down. Took them a long time just to clean up their sticky tables. This may take longer to fix."
Karla R.,"Hanford, CA",53,52,147,5.0,8/19/2014,"I love this chilis.  I signed up for email coupons,  & they send them every few weeks. The servers are really happy & nice. Betty was our server tonight & she rocks!! She actually checked on us a lot & filled our drinks without asking. She talked to my baby & made him laugh. She made an honest effort to be kind to all of us. My oldest kid loves the games on the little computer at the table. But it does cost you $1. You can pay for your bill on there & also do a survey for the server. We also enjoy Chilis because they give military discount! I am all for company's who honor the military. Overall the food is delicious.  We got the dinner for two for $20 bucks. And added on salads. We are full, satisfied,  & happy. Thats good service."
Daniel F.,"Lemoore, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/28/2016,"Me and a couple friends went to the bar section, Frank was our bartender, he was cool, had convo with us, recommended some drinks and made our drinking experience fun at chilis. Would definitely go back again and hope Frank's our bartender!!!"
