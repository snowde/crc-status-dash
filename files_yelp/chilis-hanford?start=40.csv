Yuki I.,"Lemoore, CA",6,13,28,1.0,9/6/2014,"Came here with the husband expecting a decent dinner and it just went downhill.  First of all, ordered a martini and waited 30 min for our waiter to tell us he forgot to ring-up the drink. Another 45 min later food arrived. I ordered the $20 dinner for 2 6oz classic sirloin in medium rare. When it arrived, steak was very dry and over cook. The sides to it were brocolli which was also very dry and corn on the cob was cold. Worst place to eat, but what do you expect? Its Chili's!! Bad food, bad waiter/waitress. Gotta love Chili's Grill Restaurant!!!"
Eddie M.,"Lemoore, CA",67,16,4,1.0,11/23/2015,Sat for 20 min no service used to love this place i dont know what happened to get terrible actually no service at all barely got a greeting on our way in to the bar
S G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,8,2.0,2/6/2016,"The last few times we've gone the service has really gone downhill. Not only is service super slow, the waiters will refuse to look at you when they know it's taking forever. The last time we were waiting over an hour just to receive an appetizer and never once asked if we wanted any refills. When we finally flagged down another waitress because our waiter refused to look in our direction, she told us she'd get right on it. And she did. Turns out the waiter forgot we were his table and didn't even place our order yet. AN HOUR LATER. By the time we got out of there we weren't even able to attend our movie and just went home to bed :|"
Tomi N.,"Milpitas, CA",67,21,9,1.0,6/13/2015,Microwaved over priced food in the valley. Do your self a favor and pick up a cook book.
Ryan R.,"Hanford, CA",7,7,3,1.0,1/31/2014,"My family and I made sure to call head because we had 7 adults and 3 kids under the age of 2.  When calling they said it would only be 15mins for our party. So, we took off right away and all where under 10mins.  After waiting for an addition 5mins they came and told us it would 30mins before our table would be ready. Upset now that we where lied to, we decided to stay and not load the three kids back in their car seats.  We kept checking in, to see if our table was getting close and we where told it is getting close. Now it is 1 hour since I made the reservation and kids are loosing it and need to eat at this point. We ask for the manager and her response is it will be 5 to 10mins longer.   At this point we don't care and just want food. So we left and won't be back to this Chill's ever again!"
Rick C.,"Coalinga, CA",10,4,2,5.0,9/11/2015,"Just finished our lunch-we had Margarita chicken fresh mex bowl and a lunch double burger. Everything was delicious.  Tara, our server was precious. She was sweet and personable. Loved her!!! Chips and salsa was rockin'. The Deep Eddy Texas Lemonade was awesome!!! Yeah, we'll be back."
Kathy P.,"Kingsburg, CA",23,37,43,2.0,2/16/2012,"I love Chilis!  However, this one didn't impress.  We waited close to an hour to get any food at all during the lunch hour.  Our meal came before our soups and salads?  Very odd.  I also would have expected the waiter to acknowledge that it was taking awhile and apologize...but even when questioned about where our salads/soups were...no explanation....only that they were coming.   We were on a generous lunch hour and still ended up being twenty minutes late to the class we were attending. I would have felt better had they acknowledged the problem instead of giving us the cold shoulder. I tried a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and it was just ok, kinda bland.  My fries were cold.  I loved the Chicken Tortilla Soup. Don't forget to get your free chips and salsa by checking in on Foursquare!"
Lisa M.,"Hanford, CA",0,4,1,1.0,12/17/2014,Slow service and had to send my food back twice.  First time because the MAIN Parton the dish was missing and the second time because when they did add the main ingredient it was barely even warm.
VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11973,3.0,4/9/2012,"It is pretty decent for a chain restaurant, and there's not too much to choose from in a small town. Customer service has its high and low points."
Steve M.,"Visalia, CA",2,7,,1.0,1/9/2015,The management was nice. I had to send back my sandwich do to being burnt. It should have never been sent out. I have worked in the industry for 10 years and this was unacceptable. I come here counting on consistency but it was not found this night.
Claudia C.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",41,24,3,1.0,3/2/2015,"Awful, awful, awful...did I say awful?  I ordered online and went inside to pick up my order.  I went to the 'To Go' spot back behind the bar.  The employee was present...on her phone but still present.  She told me that she had closed out the drawer so I needed to go to the bar to pick up my order.  Okayyyyy...you can't go to the bar and get my order?  You're just texting on your phone. So I walk to the bar...wait until the bartender finally sees me...only to have him say, 'Oh no, you need to go back to the To Go location. When I told him she had just sent me to him he shrugged. So I went back to the To Go location and told her what happened.  She put down her phone, went and got my order and checked me out at the bar.  Yeah...why didn't you do that the first time?  Oh, and the food was mediocre at best."
Michael O.,"東, Shibuya, Japan",0,12,,2.0,5/2/2015,The service is pretty good except for the host that sat us because he sat us at a dirty table and didn't come back to clean it. And the overall cleanliness of the place isn't that great.
Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,2.0,5/20/2013,"This is obviously not Chili's flagship restaurant.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were quickly brought over to a booth and the hostess put the menus down and immediately walked away.  The booth was very dirty though  - trash all over the floor under the table, crumbs all over both the tabletop and the seats -- so much so that neither of us wanted to sit down.  Since the hostess had long abandonned us, we tried to move to the empty booth directly behind us...except that booth was worse so we went back to our original booth.  Several employees walked by or were within seeing distance but no one even acknowledged the issue let alone came over to help as I cleaned off the table and seats with one of the napkins on the table.    My boyfriend ordered queso dip and chips for us to start with our drinks - he had a beer and I got a margarita.  The drink menu lists lots of different margaritas but doesn't list any prices so I should have known better or at least should have been smart enough to ask because I wound up paying $10 for a meh margarita made from a crappy mix.  Oh well.  The queso dip and chips were pretty good but the chips are weirdly thin.   For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered a burger and I tried the chicken crispers.  He was happy with his burger, and I thought the chicken crispers were ok but rather greasy.  That said, I knew I was coming to Chili's so that was really the kind of food I expected.  The service (starting with the dirty table) was seriously lacking.  Our waitress was nice but a little weird on the verge of annoying and would disappear for long periods of time so what was meant to be a quick dinner for 2 took over 2 hours.  When we finished our entrees, our server took them away and then came back with an unsolicited check, but we had wanted to order dessert.  My boyfriend was worried that ordering a dessert to-go would prolong our stay by another 30 mins but I foolishly sad ""no way! just order it.""  Unfortunately, he was very accurate.  In sum, our visit was long, dirty, and disappointing...there's a simile joke in there somewhere I just couldn't think of it but feel free to come up with your own."
V N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,1,1.0,3/11/2015,First time visiting. Came in with the wife and stood at the front door for ten minutes. Three waitresses looked at us but did not approach. We just left after that.
Mark H.,"San Bruno, CA",85,324,186,4.0,12/20/2011,Needed a filling meal and didn't have the time to take the 20 minute drive to Harris Ranch.  This place hit the spot. Had the Mushroom & Swiss burger with an ice cold beer (there really was ice on the glass).  Jackie was the bartender and she was very attentive. She made the entire experience pleasant with a nice smile and quick service.
Doctor W.,"Fresno, CA",4,141,50,3.0,12/18/2014,"I've have a mixture of experiences here at Chili's, sometimes the customer service and food are very good, other times they have left something to be desired. I don't come here all the time because their food is a bit pricey, so when I do I have high expectations, which I don't find to be unreasonable"
Walt B.,"Avenal, CA",1,20,9,5.0,1/28/2015,The secret to fast good service is to go directly to the bar. Bottomless lunch soup and salad is the best. Love this place
Josh D.,"Hanford, CA",38,4,,1.0,5/9/2015,Went in to have lunch today and we sat in a booth on the bar side. Waited for our server for 10 minutes. 10 minutes turned to 20 and still no service not even acknowledged. The waitress visited the table behind us twice and still failed to say anything to us. Unfortunately for Chilis and for us we decided to leave because of the very poor service. Sad because we really enjoy Chilis.
Donovan D.,"Lemoore, CA",107,1,,1.0,6/19/2014,"Worst service ever!!  Seated by hostess at 740. Server greets us at 755 after passing table multiple times.  Got drinks at 800 and ordered meals. Ran out of drink around 810. Server passed by table multiple times ignoring our attempts to stop her. Food finally came out at 855 along with refills.  Salad was ice cold, burger was overlooked, pasta was cold and sample tray was incorrect and cold.  Refund on pasta and a sarcastic server.  Manager was very ""fake"" when these issues were brought up. If you are looking to waste a few hours on cold food and crap service, this place is for you!!!"
Misty A.,"Fresno, CA",22,9,1,1.0,3/23/2014,"This restaurant (if I can even call it that) does not deserve ANY stars but I have to put one to put up this review. I have never had a good visit here.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!! I have had nothing but problems at this Hanford location.  I went tonight with my boyfriend for my birthday and the waitress we had included help from another waiter. We ordered an appetizer to share and a meal to share as well. When we received our meal my boyfriend was trying to tell her that our fries were not the ones we ordered and she interrupted him and said that she was sorry she just threw them on there and that our Texas fries were in the window and she was going to get them right now. FIVE minutes later she comes back saying that they will get us fresh fries the ones they were going to give us looked like crap. Before she left my boyfriend could get 2 words out to ask for a plate she left! She walked by us one more time and my boyfriend tried to call her again to get a plate and she just ignored us, he got up and kept saying ""excuse me"" and then the bartender noticed that he wasn't getting thru to her asked if he needed anything so he asked the bartender for a plate.  The waitress came back and my boyfriend took her aside and let her know nicely that she had interrupted him multiple times and let her know that he understands that she's working and we're not the only customers in her area she was VERY Passive-Aggressive towards him and then some customers approached her and asked for their change she was very nice to them and gave them their change and said and i quote ""I'm sorry, apparently I've been interrupting"" to them. We told her to take the burger back and to give us our check. She was still rude to us and gave us our check for the appetizer we got. We paid with chili's gift money[$20 but our check was only $11.48] that we received from our last time having chili's because of a previous time we had horrible service and our order was wrong.  I have never ever been treated the way we have tonight and cannot believe that people like that are working in the food service industry when they clearly cannot! THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US MULTIPLE TIMES I'M SURE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES!!  I will tell everyone in Hanford about my experience and let them know that there has not been 1 time out of the many that I have been there where it has been good. **My BF spoke to the manager in Visalia [Scott] and he was very helpful listened to everything that he had to say [w/o interrupting] and said that he is going straight to the district manager...So THANK YOU SCOTT IN VISALIA**"
