Jim K.,"Corcoran, CA",8,27,1,3.0,9/5/2014,Good food but shitty service. Every time we come here they skip over our names and seat everybody else so our wait turns out twice as long. Then they try to lie about it. Done with this place.
Gene K.,"Pacifica, CA",3,119,14,3.0,6/23/2014,"Great happy hour, frosty beer mugs, good food/appetizers... Only issue, which I see a lot of: waitresses stand around in groups of 3-4 and chat and chat and chat!!! Bartender disappears for lengthy periods while people need service..This happens as managers walk around oblivious to what's going on...it's really obvious and I hear customers talking about it... Pay attention people !!!!!"
Steve L.,"Visalia, CA",0,26,,1.0,1/9/2014,"LMAO!!  This is the worse chili's I have ever been to.  I began to look for the hidden cameras!!  The restaurant had about 3 tables seated, it was 11:15am.  It took an hour and a half...all we ordered was soup and salad...this place is a joke... Save your $$ and buy a hungry man microwave dinner, I know, they taste awful, but there way better then the stuff this please serves"
Brian E.,"Belle Chasse, LA",22,34,23,1.0,3/26/2012,"Food was allright, but the service was slow!  Good thing I was trying to kill time!  Never thought they'd have to catch the cow, make the cut, ground the beef all while I waited. Table behind me ordered and was finished before my wife got her sandwich and I got my burger. Horrible. And I understand the hiring pool that lives in the central valley. You're gonna run across a few larger than normal women... But can't Chili's authorize a more flattering work uniform for these women?  The typical skin tight polo is kinda gross when the person wearing it weighs more than an NFL linebacker."
Melinda E.,"Lemoore, CA",1,17,,1.0,5/4/2014,"The food was salty and tasted like it was frozen, them cooked and served. We had children's meals and adult meals ordered and eaten. The only things I've ever had That was good/decent  were the tortilla chips and salsa, and drinks. All of the other food was too salty!!"
Matthew G.,"Hanford, CA",1,14,,2.0,1/11/2014,"So weird. Cause Chili's is usually good at most places. Food is the same. But that bar area, really is a shame. Nice set up. But the service is weak. Managers and employees argue with each other in front of customers. It's like they don't care."
j j.,"San Diego, CA",172,28,5,1.0,7/4/2015,"This chilis is off its damn rocker. I just worked a 9 1/2 day to come in here and be refused drinks. My id just expired this month and I even had the renewal form to show that I am waiting for my new ID. It's the Fourth of July and I even had my VA card with my picture. For God sake I am veteran of the United States Marine Corps and I am thirty two years old. If anyone ever saw me they wouldn't have to question if I was twenty one. I have worked the restaurant business for a long time before I became a barber and stuff like this happens, but there's always exceptions to the rule like when a person brings the renewal and other forms of is as I did. I will never be back here ever again ever. All I wanted was a good drink and a steak. Veterans and active military stay away from this place, they don't care that you put your life on the line for them. Can't believe I had to deal with this especially after a 9 1/2 hour day. Chilis you need to fire that manager and get some one in there that is competent for the job. She was a joke for that!"
Shelley C.,"Lemoore, CA",4,8,3,3.0,8/22/2014,"The bar area is where we like to sit, food is always done right, hit and miss on the staff seems like better service on bar side and friendlier staff.. Rest rooms need to be checked more often last couple times no toilet paper, when you tell somebody they don't get on it fast enough.."
Derek C.,"Fowler, CA",1,26,,4.0,2/21/2014,Our server Brandon K was outstanding. Food was great and our substations were easy (we are vegetarian). However the dining area is a little small for a big chain restaurant.
Monique B.,"Benicia, CA",33,135,365,4.0,3/19/2014,"I went in last night on a Tuesday. I was seated right away. The restaurant looked clean. The hostess explained this cool techy menu/ game devise at my table. The food was really good. I got a mexican combo with a crunchy taco with chicken and a cheese enchilada. The beans were really good, too. They were garnished nicely with diced tomatoes. I have to say I was impressed with the freshness and quality of the food. I haven't been to a chili's in years. Maybe even 8 years because I haven't enjoyed the quality in the past. Chili's could improve on their timing. I waited more than five minutes for my server to greet me. Once I ordered I think I waited about 20 minutes for my food. It made me wonder if the server forgot to put my order in. The server was very friendly and helpful.  Chili's has definitely moved up in the pecking order of chain restaurants in my book. I would put it above a Chevy's, Applebees or TGIF."
Tiffani H.,"Lemoore, CA",9,7,,2.0,2/11/2014,Got the Big Mouth Bites. Supposed to come with crispy onion rings and ranch. Got a small layer of fries with a pile of soggy fried onion string things like what might go on a burger. I don't know if that's what they consider onion rings here? But I didn't get my ranch either.
Char E.,"San Diego, CA",45,81,71,3.0,12/10/2011,"I can easily say that chili's is not my favorite place to get a drink, but some of their food is pretty good. The chips with corn-roasted guacamole is pretty good, along with the southwestern eggrolls dipped in honey mustard. I'm disappointed that you don't get the amount of southwestern eggrolls you should get for the price. Service is usually pretty good, everyone has been friendly to me."
E J.,"Hanford, CA",0,8,,5.0,5/10/2015,"Ike was the manager he is a really good manager, I got an order and I called to let him know about the mere mishap that had happened with my order. I see the rating for this place and I'm like c'mon people we all make mistakes we are after all human, and their rating in my mind is harsh. Anyways, Ike insisted upon giving me another entree, I was wow this guy totally wants me to be happy, I was very happy at his assertiveness and enthusiasm, and he bought the order himself what a really great guy.I have met people who work at Chili's and they make my day, and talk very well about the management there, I can just tell when people love working at a place with great food, and friendly people. I was impressed at how great the food was, I ate everything even with the complaint I was calling about, I still loved the quality of my steak. I love the food,I had my first date at this very restaurant with the love of my life, Moved to Hanford June 15th 2014. I have noticed people here in Hanford  are different, they have more hospitality compared to all the other places I've lived. They're easy going, and have a warm welcoming kind of vibe. All in all they are totally super friendly people. I see these reviews and I am stunned as to why this place doesn't have five stars. I see nothing wrong with this place, everyone makes mistakes. People only seek out yelp to complain I swear. I had to put my review in after meeting a Chili's server yesterday and was reminded that I was a very satisfied customer and forever will be for as long as I reside in Hanford."
Lauren H.,"Robstown, TX",16,162,25,3.0,2/4/2011,"Inconsistency is the name of the game here.   Sometimes they are spot on, sometimes not so much, sometimes not at all.  We always sit in the bar area, since there is almost never a wait to seat yourself there.   It seems like it always takes a long time to get a drink from the bar, which just happens to be a real bitch cause you can see your drinks sitting there getting hot.  Oh how I hate that!  I asked my husband the other night if he thought it would be rude for me to get up and go get the beers off the bar...but I behaved and sat and waited...sigh..... The food is generally pretty good when served hot.  Seem like most of the time, there preparation timing is off...one item is hot and fresh, while the other item looks like a cold turd.  I can't stand that.  Lots of things turn out pretty salty, but I'm pretty sensitive to salt, I think.  My husband thinks Chili's is the best thing since sliced bread, and really, when you are hungry, and you live in Hanford, there aren't a whole lot of options, it's not too bad.  It just seems like I always feel heavy and sluggish and full of grease when I finish a meal there, even when I choose a ""healthier"" option.   The servers there are generally on the ball, especially in the bar area.  We have had issue with modifications a couple times, but nothing that we couldn't live with.  Really, for the most part, the servers pretty good. All that said, when the service is good and the food is fresh and the drinks are cold, Chili's is pretty good...but getting all that lined up on the same trip is the problem."
Heather D.,"Fresno, CA",12,28,5,2.0,11/15/2013,We went there last Sunday after the Nutcracker for dinner.   There was no line and got seated in a timely manner.  The waiter was the best experience of the whole night.  We got the 2 for 20.00.  We also got 2 presidential margaritas.  The appetizers were good.  The steak entrees were not.  The meat was under cooked and they had no taste.  One of the steaks was so chewy it couldn't be consumed.  After picking though our dinner the Margaritas finally arrived.  I guess the bar was backed up.  The manager did comp us for the chewy steak.   The experience was just very disappointing.
Cloak D.,"Hanford, CA",0,45,5,2.0,4/3/2011,"Pros: Nice drinks, servers are alright. Cons: Greasy food, slow service, small portions. Cloak Anecdote: I once got into a loud argument with my father here over Romeo and Juliet and how it should've ended.  I remember when this place first opened-it was great. Tons of food, great quality, didn't taste burnt, etc.  Now the meals are skimpier than the beach attire in Cancun during spring break. Complete rip off.  Also, the food is getting greasier and greasier and terribly seasoned.  Chili's, don't sacrifice quality for quantity."
Taylor R.,"Hanford, CA",1,4,,2.0,12/6/2011,"When this place first opened, the food was excellent and the service was fast. I remember dining out here a couple times during those first few months and I really enjoyed the experience. So imagine my suprise when I returned recently for a celebration and had a terrible time.  The waiter took our drink orders about 5 minutes after our party had been seated. Appetizer orders were taken another 5 minutes after that, but those came out pretty quickly so the service hadn't been too terribly bad at that point. However, after what seemed like 20 minutes of waiting (everybody had been ready to order for quite a while) we finally had to bring attention to another waiter that we weren't being serviced. We had to wait another 20 minutes before the food finally arrived and by that point a lot of it had gone cold. Out of the twelve people in our group, three of them had to send their meals back because they were incorrect. The food wasn't terrible, but my friend's fajitas were disgustingly greasy and he didn't enjoy them at all. My caesar salad was covered in about a pound of dressing and I couldn't taste anything else. Overall, I'd have to rate the experience a 2/5. I really enjoy the atmosphere and cozyness of the place but the service and food just isn't good enough. I won't be returning any time soon."
Aaron L. H.,"Hanford, CA",35,19,1,2.0,9/3/2014,"My lady and I went to Chili's for an evening dinner this past Saturday. We decided to sit at the bar. It took about 10 mins before we had to ask to be served. Once we was served and received our menus, it took about another 10 mins just to be asked what we wanted to eat. While all this is going on the bartender is holding a conversation with someone else at the bar while a couple of other parties including myself is waiting for service. I was not happy with my service. When it came time for desert the bartender asked if we wanted desert and then gave us the menus and it took about 20 mins just for him to ask us if we were ready to order desert. I would give a one star but the food was good. If it was not for the food then my rating for chili's at this particular location would be a one. I am not going to put the bartender name on here since the food was good. The service was horrible though at the bar. I will not be going to this chili's again. The Visalia location isn't much better but I would rather eat at that location."
Anh-Dao T.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,828,18,1.0,6/23/2008,"My only dining experience in the city of Hanford was at Chili's. Sad to say, but this was our best option around. This area of the city is newly developed, complete with a Super Wal-Mart, Target and fast food galore.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a weekend lunch. There were a few parties in the main room and only one other table in the bar. Even though they had plenty of tables, we had to wait for them to set one up w/ a high chair for 7.5 of us. So we ended up in the bar (a baby in a bar? that's so Sweet Home Alabama) and squeezed into a booth in the back. Despite all the empty tables around us. We put in our order and waited a loooong time. So long that a table that arrived AFTER us received their food before us. Luckily, the baby boy kept us busy. When the food finally came out, I almost wished it hadn't come out at all. Maybe it was because I've been trying to eat healthy lately. But everything was way oversalted. My corn was drenched in butter. The ribs were dry and rubbery. I dabbed at everything with my napkin and the paper was SOAKED with oil. Disgusting. The rest of the food wasn't much better.  I packed everything up for the dog, then went home and pigged out on ice cream."
Pam H.,"Hanford, CA",9,21,38,5.0,5/1/2012,"I recommend the regular guacamole with chips. It's good dipped in the guac and then the salsa, which also rock. The service was great. Our waiter, Jordan, was outstanding. If you ask him he will recommend what is their specialties. The restaurant could use some upgrading to stand out, but this place beats Applebees hands down!!"
