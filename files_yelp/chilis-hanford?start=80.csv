Joe W.,"Westminster, CA",55,242,43,1.0,10/12/2011,"So I went here today with my parents... it was a toss up between El Pollo Loco and Chilis... should have gone and got some chicken... The service there is slow... est... and it wasnt even busy.  They were so kind as to place us between two noisy annoying parental sets... both groups had demon spawns around the age of 2... so you can imagine how our meal went... now if you see 3 adults why would you put lil sh!ts on each side of them?  Really? After being seated and getting our drink orders taken care of it took our waitress another 15 minutes before she came for our food order... and it took another 20 minutes for our food?!?!?!?!? a BLT, Quesadilla thing, Bacon Burger, soup and fries... wtf.  They didnt even have the soup they told us about and came back with different options... lame.  The food was was too salty, my mom didnt even finish her half a quesadilla... im sitting here writing things thinking i need to drink a gallon of water... I was going to use some ketchup on my fries but the container looked nasty! I dont really like chilis to begin with but wow... this place took it to an all time low...."
Katie A.,"Lemoore, CA",20,60,24,3.0,8/24/2012,Its pretty hit and miss at this chili's but I find that if we sit in the bar we get better service.  The food is ususally pretty good its just the service that is unpredictable.
Dennis H.,"Hanford, CA",9,155,16,2.0,9/25/2011,"Not quite as good as last time.  My steak was over cooked.  My server offerred to send it back, but I was too hungry and didn't want to waste a good cut of meat."
Letitia B.,"Hanford, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/12/2011,I give it 1 stars because I have to but if it was up to me u would get zero. Sorry guys and gals but when I wait an hour then find a pubic hair in my food u get nothing but bad. Service sucks. They r slow to everything.
Aisha S.,"Washington, DC",0,10,,2.0,2/24/2014,I was really impressed with the food during my visit. I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were bland and underwhelming to say the least. Even the toppings didn't help the taste. All of my coworkers complained that their meals were so-so as well. The biggest disappointment was when I ordered dessert to try to make up for the poor meal I had and that was not that great either. I ordered the cookie in the pan with the ice cream and that was not good either. The cookie had a weird after taste. The service was good though so I gave them 2 stars.
Cecelia E.,"Chesnee, SC",39,255,249,5.0,7/2/2008,"Just starting a new job 3 hours away from where I had been living, ""celebrating"" a birthday, and not having anyone around because my husband was out of the country and my kids were in 2 other states, I decided that I was going to at least eat out on my birthday.  I stopped at Chili's thinking that this would be a place that I wouldn't feel uncomfortable eating at by myself . When I entered the restaurant, I almost changed my mind.  The servers were singing ""Happy Birthday"" to someone surrounded by 8 family members or friends.  As I sat down, I was having a major pity party.  Although I had already opened up my presents, I had brought my cards with me that I had received in the mail.  I had done so because I thought that it would seem as if I was having a virtual party with my family members. (Little lame, I know.  But you do what you gotta do!) The place was very busy, but I had a nice waitress.  After things calmed down, she came over and talked to me since she had noticed my cards.  I explained that I had just started a job that day as a superintendent of  a school district, that my husband was out of the country on business, and that I was celebrating my birthday by eating out and opening my cards.  We talked a few more minutes and I continued eating my salad (which was very good, BTW.) As I was finishing my meal and waiting for Betty to bring my check, Trucker (one of the managers) came up and welcomed me to the community.  He congratulated me on my birthday and said that I would have to come back to really celebrate my birthday when my husband got back from his business trip  After chatting for a few minutes, he left and I waited for the check. Suddenly, others came up and began singing ""happy birthday,"" bringing me one of those sinful molten lava cakes.  Betty handed me a card and one of the African American servers teased me that he was bringing me extra chocolate as he pointed to his skin.  After they left, I opened the card and discovered that they had given me gift certificates to come back and celebrate my birthday with my husband at a later date. While I enjoyed my meal, it was the thoughtfulness of the staff that I will remember as I think about them reaching out to a stranger celebrating her birthday alone in a strange town."
B P.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,188,,4.0,3/24/2013,Awesome bartender...decent food....much better than Applebees.
Max M.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,1,1.0,7/13/2012,"I have eaten in a number of Chili's and this one is struggling!  The service is spotty, the food is okay  not good.  When I voiced a concern over the fact that I had waited 50 minutes for a hamburger....the manager said ""Oh""  that is it.  The waitress only filled our drinks one time- remember that it is over 100 outside!!!  I have tried Chili's three times in the last 2 months and not had a good experience one time.  I am cured -I will take my hard earned dollars to a place that wants to remember that they are a service industry!"
RP P.,"Sarasota, FL",6,62,2,3.0,1/28/2011,"Apparently this is where all of Hanford goes on Friday night. Don't complain if you have wait for a table - consider yourself warned (or if your table is too small- they are standard size; you are probably too fat and should walk home and have salad instead). The food is average quality, the portions large, and cheap. The margaritas are dangerously drinkable, the gin and tonics are more like gin with a twist of tonic. My fries were soggy, which shouldn't be the case when the kitchen is clearly flat out. The service was courteous and prompt."
Jaclyn M.,"Porterville, CA",7,2,,2.0,6/8/2013,"So yesterday I went to Chili's at 7 O'clock to meet my sister for Dinner and I wish I would have gone somewhere different. Yes we went on a Friday night so obviously there would be a wait so not a problem, thought I would go and sit at the bar and eat there rather then wait for the dining room side however there were 3- 6 tops and 2- 4 tops that were GROSS, food was not bussed from the tables or wiped down the bar top where the alcohol was siting was dirty and the floor was gross. I asked the hostess if I could sit in the bar section and she said it was first come first serve however they expected the Customers to sit at unbussed tables filled with drink and food from previous customers. DISGUSTING and a health violation also! I asked if she could have one of the 6 tops that didn't have food on them wiped down before I sat there and she said NO!?? seriously so after that I decided to just wait for a table in the dining room section. It was about a 10-15 min wait not bad. Arrived to our table and it was clean however our menus had food on them...(it takes a couple seconds to wipe them down) our waiter he was ok got our drink order fast and then was tentative with coming back to check on us to see if we were ready to order, got our order in and then for being as busy as it was it came out pretty quick. But HOWEVER once our food got delivered to the table he was not very attentive other waiters brought us items he forgot. My sister ordered the Taco Pizza and I had the new Guacamole Burger with a wheat bun and black bean burger with sweet potato parm fries to sub for reg fries. the food came out and although my dish didn't look the best it had an explosive flavor that I was not expecting it to have except they forgot the parm.  With my sister Taco Pizza she had no complaints. Overall, wasn't happy with the staff and how they handled the bar area. The place was dirty but the food made it all worth it. Thankfully."
Erick C.,"Murrieta, CA",27,14,4,3.0,11/14/2010,"It's chilis, bar tenders are great to me as I frequent here in my travel"
BV W.,"Henderson, NV",36,191,16,1.0,9/23/2009,"I decided after coming here that I was not a Chili's fan. I've been there 3 times, to various ones, including this one. Each time was fail.  Don't order off their healthy menu. I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich, which sounded like it might be yummy, but it was tiny and tasted like biting into a huge cube of salt. Yeah, gross huh. The buffalo sauce was the worst I've ever had, like salt water. I guess when they cut calories they jack up the sodium for taste, it was horrible.  The service was great, but I just really can't stand the food. The waiter told us they were out of chips too and gave us some old ones, on the house, but still, old chips? Yum? Then the tortillas we had here for the fajitas were cold. Who doesn't have chips and serves cold tortillas?! Enough said."
Mary R.,"Lemoore, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/19/2011,"This Chilis Rest. is very upbeat and friendly, the servers and bar tenders are the best.  I love their ribs and all of the fantastic drinks."
Steve B.,"Corcoran, CA",0,19,14,3.0,8/16/2009,"Let's start by saying we come for the lava cake. Kids menu items are ok.  Got the $20 apetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert deal. Grilled shrimp Alfredo was fine. Noodles were cooked properly. Hard to believe how many restaurants can't properly cook noodles. My wife said her quesadilla explosion was bland. Floor was filthy at the table they sat us at. Our first waitress was good. Kept up on drinks and chips. She introduced her replacement and then we didn't see her again for about 15 minutes. Did I mention we come here for the lava cake?"
Jocelyn F.,"Castro Valley, CA",73,246,18,1.0,8/22/2008,"My Aunt moved my baby cousin to her hometown and now to see her I have to go to Hanford. Okay - I am up for a roadtrip. Me, Cousin, Aunt and Mom headed to Chili's for lunch. Hands down the worst Chili's in the nation. Okay - maybe not the nation, but the worst one I have ever been to. The place was practically empty, we are escorted to a booth and we waited. Like we seriously wait. Eventually Destiny come over to take our drink order, I order an el nino and mom has some mango thing. When the drinks are brought out, my marg has salt on the rim, she didn't ask and I forgot to mention it. Since half the blame is mine, I try to overlook it, I take my fist sip and get a mouthful of salt. I am confused and ready to send it back, my mom offers to take it and have me order another one, as I am passing my glass to my mom, my aunt notices that at the bottom of the glass there is a mount of undisolved salt. I look and damn - she's right. I don't know who taught the bartender that salt should be applied to more than just the rim. I send the drink back and I guess as punishment the bartender ups the juice and downs the alcohol level. Like Kat Williams says - fuck you. Since we hadn't got our food yet, I wasn't allowed to send it back (mom and aunt have rules). The food was ehh. Mind you - I have been eating at Chili's for like ever. The enchilada soup was off, my chicken fried steak was mushy at the bottom. I don't know who they have in the back jacking up the food, but they need to get with it.  The point of a franchise/chain is consistency. I have NEVER had a bartender fuck up an el nino. The service was off -we would ask for stuff and not get it - plates, etc. All in all the place left us bleh. Next time we go to Sonic."
