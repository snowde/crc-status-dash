Shane S.,"Lumberton, MS",0,2,,2.0,12/17/2017,"After we were seated, which didn't take long at all, we wait 10-15 mins before someone finally acknowledged us. She stated that Logan was our waiter and asked if he had been by. We said no and she took our drink order. We then waited another 10 mins on Logan to finally come by and take our order. Keep in mind we had seen him go to several nearby tables and never once came to ours. They were not busy at the whole time we were there. When we finally got to order, Logan acted like he was too busy to really listen to our order. When we received our food, my wife's order was wrong. He took it back and when it came back to us, some of it was cold. She's not the type to complain but I am. We waited a while to get refills and finally just drank the water they had served my wife with her Bloody Mary. We usually don't go to franchise restaurants, we usually eat local only. This will be the last franchise we go to if we are gonna have this kind of snotty service!"
Amanda A.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,13,21,2.0,8/6/2017,"Went here and will never go again! While my meal tasted delicious, my companions meal was all messed up and the server did nothing to fix it. In fact, upon finding out it was wrong, it felt like she ignored us! Regardless, we were there at a not busy time and there was no excuse. We waited over an hour after sitting down to get our food. If I wanted to wait for my food I'd go to cracker barrel or somewhere nice lol."
George M.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,3,,5.0,2/10/2017,Had a good experience while passing through Hattiesburg at chilis. Enjoyed a 6oz steak with French fries and asparagus and a couple of beers. Solid service and my tab was not bad at all. Would recommend
Dennis B.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,20,16,1.0,7/25/2016,"We just walked in and it smells of sewage upon entering. Staff looked tired and unkept. Atmosphere was awful and we left ASAP. In all fairness, anyone entering these chains post 2001 or so should expect such things as the price point appeals to a lower income crowd and/or kids. That said, the smell of doo doo upon entering is not good even in a Waffle House."
Pat F.,"New York, NY",0,9,5,1.0,8/11/2015,Look at this mess..... Why would you serve Celery on a plate looking like it died!  Never going back there for sure
Lana H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",357,89,208,1.0,8/16/2015,Absolutely terrible. First I went to the restroom and the toilets were dirty and there wasn't a lock for the door. Then I get back to the table and our drinks were greasy on the outside and had food in the inside! All of the silverware for our party of 5 had food stuck on it! We told the manager and she didnt respond properly. We left after that. I recommend Plaid Rhino! It's less than a mile away:)
Neyse H.,"Richardson, TX",18,5,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Run away!  That is what my family did. The silverware was dirty for all five people in our party. My water glass was greasy on the outside and had food stuck to the inside. I can excuse slow service but filth is not ok The health dept needs to pay a visit,they are obviously not using clean water to wash the dishes."
Janice M.,"Collins, MS",40,5,5,1.0,4/17/2016,"Worst ever in a restaurant. The hostess wasn't friendly, the waitress was very polite but slow. Usually the waitress ask ""May I start you off with an appetizer"", we had to ask her. After waiting over 45 minutes to receive cold food. My boyfriend and I have added this to our list of restaurants to never go back to."
Master M.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,10,3,5.0,1/18/2016,I eat here all the time. I've always had great service and I always enjoy the food. The blackberry tea is one of my favorite items they have.
Chynna H.,"Ocean Springs, MS",0,5,,1.0,3/1/2015,This is my first time writing a review.  After two terrible experiences here I felt it would be an injustice not to play my part in notifying the public. I'll keep it simple: - basically have to seat yourself - waiters don't acknowledge your presence - can't get a drink refill - food takes forever - food is cold - sat us near the kitchen (they fight and cuss) I don't ever bitch but this place is garbage...
Jack M.,"Jackson, MS",1,7,1,1.0,3/3/2015,"The worst service I've ever had,  from a Latino female working behind the bar!!! Rude rude .... The beer which came in a 10 ounce mug had a 1.5 inch head on it.... The girl refused to serve chips!! I have never just wanted to leave a place as fast as I left there... How can a place stay in business like that?! Will never go back in there, unless I just want to show someone how not to be!!!"
Mary V A.,"Sarasota, FL",1,22,16,4.0,3/10/2015,20 min wait was well worth it pleasant service food hot yeah for chilis server was very pleasant
Stacy Roxanna G.,"Atlanta, GA",49,37,15,4.0,7/29/2014,"I'm not a chain Resturant type of Chica however when you are in a place named Hattiesburg, Ms. You go with what you know. Establishments that have regulations and standards they are rated on by the state. My dinner was good, I had a cup of soup and a grilled chicken salad. Both were well prepared. Jessica, our bar server made awesome vodka soda cocktails and was very attentive and hospitable. I wouldn't mind returning, if I had too."
Sara B.,"Clinton, MS",18,4,,4.0,12/18/2014,"Ate there once last week and was my first time being there. The service was kind of terrible and nobody told us there was a .99 charge for playing the games on the table device, but the food was fantastic. I would definitely come back and give the servers another try."
Phillip H.,"Hattiesburg, MS",8,3,9,1.0,8/31/2014,Terrible terrible! Waited at a table no one came so went to the to-go and the waited for 40 minutes for 2 appetizers
John C.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",10,7,3,1.0,11/25/2013,Garbage! Service was horrible and the food was worse. I had the grilled shrimp tacos and that came with bland rice and overcooked black beans. My wife had the quesadilla explosion salad and it was half its normal size and the half ahe received was full of wilted lettuce. Ugh!
Keith R.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2014,"This place is horrible.  Took my daughter to dinner and ordered steak fajitas,   daughter got chicken. Server brought my daughter's food. I never saw mine till I asked. Server said it got dropped on floor and had to make another. My daughter now done and I have nothing. Server brings food out when I'm ready for check and asked me if it looks ok? Got to go box and got bill for $35. Will never go again. P.s. 8 month pregnant servers are not appealing and warm beer definitely nono"
Jeana S.,"Brandon, MS",113,86,54,5.0,6/18/2012,Every time I'm in Hattiesburg I stop by Chili's. The service has always been friendly and the food is great!
Nathan B.,"Hattiesburg, MS",1,1,,1.0,8/6/2015,"I am so dissatisfied with this place that I created a Yelp account to do a review on it. This place only gets a star because it is necessary to do the review. Let me just start off by saying that Chili's in particular has never been my first choice in dining. Not any of their locations. The inconsistency alone is enough to swear it off altogether. But, today, I decided to go in there for a light lunch and beer with my friend. We weren't greeted when we walked in, even though there were hardly any customers in the restaurant. Still, that was no surprise. We walked to the bar and seated ourself in the middle. We weren't greeted by the bartender, a Latino in her mid to late twenties, who I had remembered as serving us before at the bar with a bad attitude and absolutely no personality to speak of. After about two or three minutes, she finally got around to us and asked us what we wanted. We told her what we wanted and I was asked for my ID. I had been ID'd by her before and was served immediately after she verified it. But this time, she pointed to the ID and asked condescendingly, ""Do you have another ID"". I asked why I would need another ID. She then proceeded to tell me that she couldn't accept the ID because there was a tiny tear where the ID had started peeling in the top right corner. Before I could say anything, my friend told her that she was just being an ""ass"" and that what she was saying wasn't a real policy but one that she made up. I then snatched my ID away and said that I would go somewhere else. My friend, upset with how all of it was handled by the bartender, decided to call them after we walked out. He talked to the manager on duty, Peggy, and explained the situation. Peggy told him that it was ""Chili's policy"" with IDs. Not law, CHILI'S POLICY. My friend has many years of corporate experience and so told the woman off for refusing service to me because of that. He explained that since it was a new policy that it should have been explained and let it slide for this one time because it was a new policy, so that customers would understand if they went in regularly. She then told him that ""Company policy is more important than customers"", which she repeated several times to him - to which he told her that we would not be back. Good luck with that, Chili's. Now that everyone knows your ""policy"" is more important than your customers, I hope that this messed up mindset reflects on your business. Poor management and training."
Ashton L.,"New Orleans, LA",0,15,3,1.0,2/5/2011,"Usually its pretty decent, but our waiter was a total asshole. We had to request that a manager come take our money so we could leave because the waiter never would come back to our table. She never showed up either. Eventually the waiter grabbed the ticket, after 5 passes by the table. Most of his time was spent chatting with some of his friends who were seated in his section. Food was fresh though. But the trip reminded me why we don't go there much."
