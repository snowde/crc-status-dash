Kai W.,"Kahala, Honolulu, HI",113,32,62,5.0,9/17/2017,"We stopped here on our way to stay at the suites in Palmas Del Mar. it was Sunday, so even though we were there at 3:30 it was quite busy and we were told it would be15 minutes for a two top. However they seated us in a nice booth in about 5 min. We had the Sour Cream and chicken enchiladas and the mushroom burger with a side salad instead of fries. A couple iced teas and some chips and salsa wetted our appetites while we waited. It was good and our server was super sweet and patient. We would definitely come back again!"
