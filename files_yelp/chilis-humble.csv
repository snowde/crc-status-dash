Jessica J.,"Spring, TX",0,30,108,4.0,7/24/2017,Came here for tequila day with some co workers. Sat in the bar area. Place was not packed at all around 4pm on a Monday. The service was good. The margaritas were good & cheap for tequila day! Good place to meet up for a drink.
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",305,37,149,2.0,5/16/2017,"We visited the bar around 3pm on a Monday afternoon. It wasn't too many people at 1st but it got a little crowded the closer it got to 4p. The bartender was BEYOND BUSY. He was working the entire bar area including the tables. Food was alright, lack luster. We ordered sizzling fajitas that weren't sizzling & a burger order medium that arrived well done so that about sums that up.  Oh! Service could've been better had he had help from the other women who was on her phone most of the time. He repeatedly forgot things that we asked for but I understand. He was swamped with no one to throw him a life jacket. Poor thing!"
Cornelius S.,"Houston, TX",141,197,225,1.0,5/4/2017,I will never go again.  This is the 2nd time in 2 visits that I have waited a hour to get my food.  5 I repeat 5 families came after me.  They got they food and left. Wow.  Ask the manage what was going on?  They saw they were crowded.  This is a ongoing thing.  I will never go again.
Che P.,"DuPont, WA",3,41,6,1.0,5/4/2017,"This is by far the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  I went in yesterday and ordered a burger to go.  When I was handed my burger, the to go box was open inside the bag and the bar tender didn't even care.  He was like ""Here's your food dude"".  Just a few minutes before that, I saw him do the most disgusting thing ever.  He had a ragged bandaid on his thumb.  As he was bringing some guy's plate out of the back his ragged bandaid thumb was literally in this guy's plate.  He hands the guy the plate, says ""Oh man that looks great bro"", then licks his thumb.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Back to my dish......my burger was cold, bread was hard, and fries were on the brink of being stale.  Clearly my order had been done for a while and had just sat there."
E F.,"Houston, TX",61,61,28,1.0,12/9/2016,If you're wondering why you really can't see it well because it's burnt! This is what they gave me for lunch time double cheeseburger. Two burnt parties of meat stuck together with cheese. I could have gotten a better burger at mcdonalds.disappointed
Sarah H.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,24,6,1.0,5/30/2017,"Second time here, slower than the first which I didn't think was possible. Staff is pretty terrible; poor customer service, slow, kind of rude. Food is typical restaurant chain food. Place is dirty, sticky menus and the ""ziosk"" thing is disgusting (food stuck to it, sticky). They don't give you napkins, or take your menus; bizarre. Keep driving and don't waste your time or money here."
Josh E.,"Houston, TX",5,16,5,1.0,3/4/2017,Walked in at 10:30 on a saturday night - nobody greeted us for over 10 mins - we sat ourselves- 20 mins for drinks.  20 mins after she took out orders - she remembered to put in our order.  she bold face told me she put it in but it did show in the computer until after i saw her put it in.  Lots of help standing around - no idea why they are dysfunctional!
Jenny F.,"South Central Houston, Houston, TX",48,11,4,1.0,4/26/2017,"Came in at 8:50pm and waited 10 minutes for the host to notice me. It is now 9:40pm and my food has not come out. A manager, nor my waiter has come out to apologize why the food is taking so long. It is only my family and a couple in one section of the restaurant. If I knew it would take this long, I would have gone to a drive though for food. Horrible service! Definitely stay away from this Chilis location!!!!"
Staci O.,"Houston, TX",15,2,,1.0,3/12/2017,I went to the one in Humble and it sucked never will I go back.  The waiter had way too many tables and our food took forever.  When I went to talk with the manager he told me it takes longer with ribs and more people.  Well that was a God dam lie the people next to us came in way after us and had ribs and steak with 3 people and we had 4.  The people other table got there food before us and we order the same time. So you tell me what's wrong with this picture.  Don't worry I will never go back the service sucked and manager had an excuse instead of correcting the problem.
Michael C.,"Pasadena, TX",56,18,58,2.0,2/28/2016,This chillis used to be really good. There food was really good and came out fast. Ever since the Manager left the current management is horrible. The wait staff is awesome super nice. Our waiter was super friendly and super nice. Tables are dirty and the wait time for a table is about 15 minutes with at least 75% capacity.
Patricia W.,"Houston, TX",0,34,,1.0,5/28/2017,"There is no way this restaurant deserves any star but what can I do?  A very long story but suffice to say, Chili's Corporate Office will be contacted.  A manager by the name of Nestor has no business dealing with customers...rude, unprofessional and patronizing.  When the employees working there tell me what a jerk he is, I'm not going to contradict them.  Because he messed up a to go order he informed me that when I called to place the order I should have talked to him.  Uh...up until 30 seconds ago I didn't know you existed.  And when I told him I was calling corporate he scurried back into the kitchen telling the staff I was going to call corporate about him.  I got the funny feeling this will not be the first time corporate has gotten a call concerning Nestor."
Tracy P.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,36,45,1.0,4/3/2015,"I have been coming here over a year dinning in but most taking out. We always order the tilapia fish with rice and broccoli, last time d fish was uncooked and spinach dip was cold.  Today I order d same thing MY RICE WAS 50% cook my fish have a weird smell like it's been sitting out.  Sorry even its like 3 minutes away from my house I m not coming back ."
Chrislynn D.,"Houston, TX",1,10,4,1.0,3/7/2016,"This is the worst Chili's I've ever been to. We ordered two entrees, an appetizer, and a beer. An hour later when we finally got our food..: they forgot the beer, messed up on one of the entrees, as well as the appetizer (we asked for no bacon), and the food was cold. Not warm. Cold. They brought the appetizer back to the kitchen and brought back a second one that also had bacon on it, 20 minutes later... We ended up getting the appetizer when we were ready to leave.  Just avoid this location."
Crystal A.,"Houston, TX",3,14,12,2.0,2/8/2017,"I was here on Super Bowl Sunday. When I first entered there was no one to greet us which is odd so we waited for 10 minutes until the bartender seen us and called the young man to come and Brett us. He seats us we notice there is only one person at a booth in the entire restaurant. We get seated and wait for someone to notify our waiter that we were there. She comes up and she greets us. We told her to give us just a few minutes as in we will find out quickly what we wanted to order and she comes back literally 15-20 minutes later. I was being as patient as I could when my husband peaked over and noticed she was chatting with 4 associates. He makes eye contact and she comes over. She finally take our order and I had to flag her back because the kios for our chilis points didn't have a battery. She takes about 10 minutes to get that. We waited 30-45 minutes as she sat and talked once again for our food for a restaurant that was almost empty. Then when she does bring our food out she drops the main things that go with our meal and the top of our food was hot like it was sitting under a lamp and the middle was cold. I told my husband to spot the to go plates and we will take our food home. I was through. She asked to do the check and I specifically told her that I would do it from the kios she ignores that and when I go to pay it's gone off the screen. At this point I'm about to blow. I called the restaurant thinking it was that location and asked for the manager to come to the table. Poor Sara at the kingwood location was so sweet but it wasn't the one I was located at. The waiter comes back to the table and I told her I was waiting on Sarah and she said ""if she told you that was her name she lied to you."" She laid the bill on the table we paid and I got the hell out out there before I went completely off. If she new I was waiting on a manager why did she go and grab hers?! I called as soon as I got home to find out I had called the wrong store at first and I ended speaking to Emanuel the manager on duty. He was so understand and so kind hearted I give kudos to him just getting there and trying to get it back in shape. Emanuel needs more customer friendly team members that come to serve customers. We weren't being difficult and we didn't ask for nothing more then for the waiter to service us. It wasn't a busy night so her service should've been on point. Emanuel offered for us to go back and he'd make it right but I just can't. I would've have rather been refunded my money or sent a gift card to eat at the kingwood location where we are loyal customers and know we are going to always be taken care of. I gave this location 2 stars just because of Emanuel."
Hilda R.,"Humble, TX",1,17,14,1.0,4/11/2016,Very upset today my husband and I met for lunch at Chillis . The waitress brought our chips n salsa while we waited for our food. 30 min passed and she comes back asking us has our food came out yet? We're looking at her like you tell us if our food came out ? Well she goes and checks on our food and she comes back to tell us someone else took our order so there now working on our order. Well I really think she forgot to put in our order . It was very upsetting because it was time for me to go have to go back to work my lunch hour was gone. This is the first time this happens but just make sure if you eat here that your keeping up with how long they take with your order specially if your on your lunch break .
Alan D.,"Humble, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/14/2016,Chilis all together sucks they change their menu like most people change socks. But this one is especially bad had to flag waiter down to order food was not prepared properly. Won't ever go back that's for sure.
Jeneffer P.,"Houston, TX",0,21,9,2.0,5/13/2016,The to-go hostess got in an argument with one of the customers. She was obviously overwhelmed with too many orders but should have had another person to help her. After 25 min wait they were just getting my order in to cook when i ordered online. 7 ppl came in after i did and all left before i did. Hostess or manager didn't even apologize for not having my order ready or for waiting almost half an hour. Unhappy with their service.
Mery R.,"Humble, TX",28,272,39,1.0,11/11/2014,My appetizer took 30 minutes to come out and when it finally did it was clearly not hot. When I got done with my appetizer I still had to wait for my food. It was a busy night at the restaurant but I was still disappointed that it turned into a 2 hour dinner when it didn't have to be.
S W.,"Houston, TX",0,14,1,3.0,10/1/2016,"Services is awesome, long wait for food its always too cold in there, by time you do get your food i take two bites im cold and ready to go, food good and i luv cheap margarita."
Valerie H.,"Houston, TX",99,328,97,2.0,10/9/2012,"Everyone and their mama has been to chili's. Some are better than others...this one is definitely on the bottom of the chili's list.  The only reason I've been here so many times is the location...it's down the street from my office and my son's school.  There's the menu favorites that always taste great, and that consistency is appreciated, however the water is consistently gross. Pretty much every drink I've ordered is. I wonder if they've ever cleaned their ice machine or fountain drink thingy. They always taste like either soap, mildew, or flat sweet soda. Yuck.  The restroom is pretty gross too, with dust and hair balls in every corner. I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like. I have to admit i'll prob be back, but maybe bring my own bottled water instead."
Shynolan R.,"Humble, TX",48,1,,1.0,1/20/2016,Met friends there and waited forever to get menu's then my order was never taken...they use fake chicken now...this place is horrible only thing I would get is a burger service and any other item on the menu is terrible
Leo O.,"Houston, TX",6,17,12,3.0,4/23/2015,Smoking in the bar makes the eating environment uncomfortable for a non smoker.Food and service was good though.
Noor-Hal C.,"Houston, TX",9,107,,4.0,10/20/2014,"I took my mum two Saturdays ago to have a early dinner. Maybe that was the reason why the hostess took several minutes to show up and take us to our table. Aside from that, the service from our waitress was pretty good (I have to give her extra-credit since she was pregnant and even so, our orders came out pretty fast, she was attentive with the drinks and taking our orders too.)  My mum had the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp and she loved it! I had my regular order of Buffalo Wings and we had half of the Texas Chili Fries. All our dishes were pretty good, though the portions are well-sized and we did take to go boxes. Many people would love to disrespect chain restaurants, but at least you know what to expect, there some standards you can look forward to."
Isaac H.,"Spring, TX",1,119,2,1.0,9/13/2014,"I order to go from Chili's occasionally at multiple locations that are conveniently located within minutes from work sites, so I have my fair share of experience with Chili's. That being said, without a doubt, this was the worst margherita flatbread I've ever had from Chili's. It was burnt to a crisp, the toppings where completely uneven, and the whole thing tasted stale. Disappointing."
Brandy C.,"Long Beach, CA",148,73,29,2.0,12/24/2014,"Service was good, but the food was horrible. The quarterly changing menu sucks too. Go back to the basics....Cobb salad, seasoned meats, variety of burgers, bone in appetizers....I could go on."
Lisa G.,"Houston, TX",2,26,12,1.0,5/2/2015,They seem to run out of things or decide not carry items that are still listed on the menu. No Angry Orchard and no baked potato soup. Fish tacos were dry. Black beans were cold. Really?!? Should have just gone home to eat.
George C.,"Humble, TX",42,20,18,1.0,4/7/2015,"Went in and someone told us passing in a rush to wait for a table and someone will be with us and then when we were finally seated, we waited for 10 minutes and they still hadn't taken our drink order! We ended up leaving and going to Los Cucos! Place smells like smoke too!"
Angelia Kathleen H.,"Houston, TX",164,6,4,1.0,12/26/2015,"One of the worst dining experiences ever. The staff was extremely slow and had no sense of urgency. It took at least 15 minutes just to get our chips and salsa. An additional 10 minutes just to get our queso which we ended up not eating because it was nothing like queso. We couldn't even dip our chips in it, simply gross. We had to ask for a refill on the salsa at least 3 times before it was brought to us by a manager. Our food was cold and my boyfriends pasta was undercooked. The manager ended up waiting on us more than our actual waiter. It seemed like he had no clue what was going on or how to serve tables. When it came time to get the check, it took almost 20 minutes. The only positive was that the manager took the queso off of our bill but unfortunately that was the only pleasant part of our experience. I was shocked at how terrible this was. We even said we should have just left after it took 20 minutes just to get salsa. I wish we would have."
Melissa O.,"Humble, TX",61,59,9,3.0,2/26/2015,It was interesting waited an extremely long time for drinks and food.
Reggie G.,"Baytown, TX",0,9,,1.0,4/30/2015,"This place during lunch hours is very slow. I ordered the fajita nachos , the meat on the nachos wasn't fajitas it was Philly cheesesteak meat, the manager admitted to it after our talk. The smoke carrying over from the bar is very irritating. My advice , go to another chilies."
DeWayne R.,"Houston, TX",161,567,283,3.0,11/23/2013,"The $30 dinner special, which includes a drink and a dessert was nice, but the margarita was watered down."
Heidi S.,"Humble, TX",116,396,29,3.0,8/21/2012,"In all the time this place has been open, I finally went here recently with my love and my munchkin! The place was half empty and we stood waiting for a hostess for too long I thought and finally what looked like a manager came out to seat us. The service was less than great for sure..our waitress really didn't care and forgot some items. Someone who wasn't even in her serving area came to check on us..so that was nice of him! Albeit it was late at night when we went, but still c'mon if you are working for tips, you should at least try to earn them right?! The food was good I have to say..I had the California Club, my fries, my childs slider that she didn't finish and her fries...ok I love fries #!"
Anne F.,"Humble, TX",0,8,1,1.0,10/8/2015,"Food usually takes forever, tastes average, and overpriced for what you get. Took over 40 to get lunch."
Daniel E.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/4/2014,"I always loved chilis, especially for their deserts. But went last month and wasn't so impress then again last night was a game changer for family dining for me. The server was sweet and I feel sorry I have to give her a bad review. I believe it's the training. But the food was horrific. I so regret for not taking a picture but can describe. Wife and son ordered steaks. They looked like they were defrosted in cold water and turned grey. Then seared quickly on both sides then served, leaving them still grey with a smell that I know it came from old meat. My baby back ribs were fine but seemed to cool down when served because waiting on steaks. Wasn't busy at all and not sure what went wrong. Hopefully I can start seeing good review so I can start going back. But last night I wasn't nauseated but I just wanted to get the food out of me. Get it together Chili's!"
Ross F.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",145,56,17,3.0,8/26/2013,"Normal Chilis.  They all do a good job of delivering consistency.  I had a Caribbean salad here, and it was just drenched in dressing.  Everything else was fine.  Good service, normal times to get food, I guess I'd just be safer getting dressing on the side next time.  Only other issue was having to wait and look around at staff wondering when we would be seated."
La H.,"Spring, TX",0,20,4,1.0,4/29/2015,"This is my third and last time in. The place is FILTHY! My menu had pages stuck together from food and when I opened it, my hands were covered in sticky food residue from who knows what! The service is fair to partly cloudy to say the least. They only have one or two servers for the lunch crowd and it's hard to get the feeling that it's a warm and cozy eating experience and they have to seat you in less than desirable areas because that's the only places they have a server at the time. Not worth your time."
Renae M.,"Waco, TX",17,16,12,1.0,1/19/2015,Slow service. Empty dirty tables all around. Lackluster staff. Steak overlooked and asparagus undercooked. Salmon cooked till it had no color left. Sweet potato fries served cold. Very disappointed.
Jessica F.,"Houston, TX",25,54,8,3.0,9/19/2012,"We come to this Chili's very often. Usually it's on a Thursday night, because of the happy hour and we always sit in the bar. I've never really had a bad experience up until this last time. The server was someone who we had never seen before. And she looked dis-engaged the entire time we were there. She was waiting on a lot of tables in the bar, and everytime she would pick up dirty plates she would heavily slam them into the dirty bucket area. It was very obnoxious. It also took forever to get our check, we had to flag her down and ask for it. We were there about 2 hours.  I will return because i like the other servers who usually see us and free chips and salsa on thursday evenings is hard to pass up on! Maybe next time i will have a better experience."
Ralph S.,"Woodstock, GA",13,146,199,3.0,6/19/2013,Typical Chili's with good service. Enjoyed my lunch and our server was fantastic.
Andrew J.,"Humble, TX",1,1,,1.0,9/9/2012,Whatever you do avoid going to this place on a Sunday. My wings were ice cold and my friend ordered a medium rare Sirloin and got a well done steak that you could eat in two bites on a plate that had an amount of broccoli that could feed the vegan nation. All while no manager or anybody seemed to care. The only reason I tipped the waiter a dollar was because he looked like JP from grandmas boy and who've made for some good robot laughs. I was hoping he would fill my water up in robot character. Beeeeww beeeew druuuur zeeeet.
