LaShanna L.,"Houston, TX",28,19,,4.0,12/2/2013,"This location is pretty good on customer service, getting to know their customers & holding convo if you're sitting at the bar. (I don't need convo but appreciate the gesture). Anyhoo, I order-to-go most times & I just appreciate that I'm already in the system & they typically know what I want. Thumbs up."
Melinda G.,"Humble, TX",11,29,,4.0,5/19/2011,I've been to this Chilis a few times. It always has great service and good food. Definitely a quick and good place to get dinner.
Laura A.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/9/2014,"There's nothing spectacular about any Chili's, but it's the convenience of the place and variety of the menu that keep people in their doors.  Unfortunately for this location off of the beltway, it is the furthest thing from being convenient.  There's not much around to eat for lunch that's close to my office, so my co-workers and I have been to this location a few times.  There seems to be different staff each time and something always seems to hold up the kitchen, even though the restaurant isn't full.  One time we went and had wonderful service, which is why we decided to go back again.  Today was the same ole story...new faces and long waits for the food.  We had to immediately ask for to go boxes for our food since we were there for 50 minutes and had to rush back to the office.  Maybe the restaurant is okay during the evening, or any other time when you're not on a time schedule, but I do not recommend this location for lunch hours at all."
