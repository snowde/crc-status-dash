Ravindran C.,"Willow Grove, PA",3,29,7,4.0,7/9/2017,"Some real revamp of the menu has happened.  The options for the vegetarian folks has increased across board The buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer is a stand apart dish. With the gentle seasoning with chives sprinkled with ranch dressing. Careful consideration seems to have got the buffalo sauce separately. The veggie fajitas were a huge disappointment though. While a lot of veggies like asparagus and plum tomatoes etc have been added on, the concept of using crushed bean patties as opposed to providing rice and beans separately as well as the totally disappointing tortillas which were hard but hot meant I am not looking to order this again"
Arlene T.,"Jenkintown, PA",14,75,7,1.0,12/17/2017,Wow! Horrible service! Ordered pick up/to go and will never order or come back again.  Ordered a gallon of mango ice tea which was on the online menu.  Hubby showed up to pick up our food and they said they don't sell the mango ice tea by the gallon. Why is it an option on the menu? They then gave him 4 teas.  He got home and only 1 is a mango ice tea. The other 3 are unsweetened tea. Manager argued with my husband and hung up with no resolution. He drove back and returned the unsweet ice tea that we did not order. Still no resolution.  This is corporate's phone number for complaints: 18005893820.  Their general manager doesn't work for a few days so i have to wait to get my money back. RIDICULOUS!!! Number is posted because I am sure we are not the only ones with issues at this Chili's.   Gee thanks for giving us not what we ordered. No wonder why they have horrible reviews. Stay away and take your chances elsewhere. We will never give this Chili's a penny or a chance to take our money and not provide what we purchased. I have to call corporate to get our money back. Lol ABSOLUTELY RIDUCULOUS!
Geoffrey M.,"Jenkintown, PA",24,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,Slow service. Dirty utensels. Cold food. Table was sticky.  Overpriced. Not worth the wait.
Nancy V.,"Philadelphia, PA",60,3,,1.0,12/21/2017,"How about negative stars! That was disgusting. From the host he was laying across his podium and shuffled us to the table with one hand never leaving his pocket.  ForEVER TO get drinks, water....apps came p, no napkins while waitress stood at next table talking and talking and talking.  And the food - old, disgusting. Tasted like it was leftover from someone's plate from last night. DO NOT GO THERE. NEVER. EVER."
Andreina S.,"Jenkintown, PA",16,79,78,3.0,4/16/2017,"It's just OK, we go here whenever we can't think of anything else to go to... so it's our very last option. We even consider it because its kid friendly (as it is never that crowded so it doesn't matter if the kids are load).  Good is average, I guess like any other franchise. The service tho.... hmmm, the could do better..  We've had the kid's sliders, the quesadilla salad, the salmon from the slighter option meals and of course the Presidente Margarita... yum."
Patrick M.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,43,,1.0,9/1/2017,"Went to eat at Chili's tonight and when we walked in   we were greeted by a young man. We told him we were a party of 3 and he said it would be a half hour wait. I looked around and the resturant was pretty empty. So I thought I may have heard him wrong because it was so empty and I asked did you say 30 mins because resturant in fairly empty. He gave me a dirty look and just said yea. I asked if we could just sit at the bar area and he responded back in a cocky tone No.  We have eaten here many times. We live in the neighborhood  and can walk done the hill to eat here, but never again.  I Left and will never return. I advise all my fellow Jenkintown and Abington friends to avoid this establishment. Go to Bernie's at least they appreciate your business."
Tim A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,21,17,1.0,3/25/2017,Stopped in here this evening for a quick drink. Not pleased at all. I have been here many times over the last 20 years. It has gone down consistently and quickly the last two.  Walk in with no host to great us. Sat at the bar in which there was only one couple and one single person. The bar maid watch us enter and seat ourselves. She then proceeded to wait on tables after we sat down at the bar. After ten minutes of waiting with a dirty bar and menus that were stinking together and watching her wait in tables we left. I cannot blame her for being understaffed. We left and went to the Vintage down the road on 611. Which seated us immediately and took out order. I will not be going back here ever.
Shardai G.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,169,169,4.0,8/4/2016,"The food is pretty good. I usually do the 2 for $20 (now for $22) which you pick an appetizer to share and 2 entrees. I usually get the chipotle chicken crispers with different sides. I've gotten desserts too--the chocolate chip cookie is yummy! The service is usually good. However, for large groups, the experience was a lot different. I went with a group and the computer was down so receipts couldn't be printed and orders couldn't be placed which caused a tizzy. However, managers did what they needed to resolve the issues and the workers stayed the course appropriately. Although, there are some flaws, it doesn't deter me from dining in because I've had more good experiences than bad."
Nancy M.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",1435,334,273,2.0,4/8/2017,My biggest pet peeve is getting food at takeout wrong. You don't realize until you get all the way home and by then it's too late.   We enjoyed the California chicken flatbread and the boneless wings but we also ordered queso and instead of queso we received a small bowl of chili and a small bowl of salsa. Waste of money.
Tori S.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",149,6,24,2.0,3/19/2017,Cups were so disgusting I didn't drink out of them. If you get a cup ask for a glass one from the bar. Along with the food... our app was great (fried asparagus) my food took way longer to come out than my friends did and I only got boneless wings.
Mari R.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",13,11,9,2.0,6/18/2017,Service slow- interior rundown and dirty looking - food was good. Have been to other Chiles and they were much nicer.
Yvette M.,"Fairless Hills, PA",4,2,,1.0,2/10/2017,"A group of 15 of us came here to celebrate my friends bday, service was horrible, food took forever. We were overcharged for our food.  Never to return."
Tom S.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",0,2,,1.0,10/29/2016,Went there for dinner last night 10/28/16   after being seated we sat there for 20 minutes with no service  . Table was dirty . After I asked for a server one came over and told us they had forgot us. We ordered nachos and drinks  once again a 20 minute wait   . Chillis 9 dollar nachos are literally 9 nachos with cheese ( you can do the math) . Once again a  20 minute wait for truly below average entrees  . Waited another 15 minutes for our bill. Stay away from at all costs  this restaurant will be closed within 6 months
Mantis T.,"Cheltenham, PA",45,12,13,1.0,9/24/2016,new manager is nowhere near as lovable as the old they did not have what i ordered and refused to cook my meat the way i wished this place was my escape my one true passion and it ripped my heart out and crushed my spirits.  i loved you chillis.  all i ever did was love you.  why must you hurt those who love you the most? -your (ex) best customer
Jodi R.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",0,6,,1.0,9/23/2016,Fair at best. Service was lousy. Tables were sticky. Food took a long time to arrive and then it was cold. The appetizer came after the entrees. It even took a while to get change from paying the check and they shorted us change to boot. We definitely will not be rushing back.
Donna M.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,53,,5.0,6/10/2016,"This is my son's fav restaurant and he's as picky as you can get.  We never have a bad meal and the service is always outstanding.  Love their burgers, wings and carnitas tacos.  And the drinks from the bar are always on point.  Stay far, far away from the Cheltenham Av location...it's the exact opposite of this place."
Tiara T.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,16,1,5.0,10/27/2015,"*Exhales* Ok, where do I begin? The food is Awesome! Finger licking oh so good. Their appetizers are so delicious...so many options to choose from. Their waiters and waitresses are polite, well groomed, and always happy lol...too cute. The service speed is a good pace. The desserts are mmmmmm. I would recommend them absolutely."
Susan F.,"Abington, PA",0,11,,5.0,11/1/2015,"My boyfriend and I have always loved Chilis, but in the last year or so this particular location has become our favorite restaurant in the area. The food and drinks are always delicious. It's good at all Chilis locations really. What sets this particular location apart from the rest is the staff.  Everyone from the hosts to the servers to the bartenders to the cooks to the management is AMAZING.  Everyone is so friendly, funny, polite... We have gotten to know so many of the people there that it feels more we are seeing friends rather than going into a ""business"". And because of that environment, it makes us want to go back more and more.  The management team here is EXCELLENT. They truly go out of their way to make sure the customers are happy. You can count on someone from management to stop by your table just to check on you and make sure your experience is going well and that everything is taken care of. By far my favorite restaurant to go to in the area."
Tom R.,"Philadelphia, PA",96,39,11,2.0,11/7/2016,"Over the years I have enjoyed going here for some good pub food.  Last nights dinner,made me wonder what the hell has happened.  First off your dinner wear comes out in a prepacked brown paper bag.  Made me feel like I was eating at a homeless shelter.  we ordered Apps and drinks which were standard as expected.  Then came dinner.  I ordered the Fajita with steak and shrimp.  The waitress brought me out a tray with my fixings on it and a rolled aluminum foil about 5 minutes before my dinner.  Finally curiosity got the best of me and I opened the foil.. It was 3 wrapped tortilla shells.  Cold and sticking to each other and incredibly small. I have come to expect warm flat tortilla at Mexican restaurants - usually served in a covered bowl.  I have NO idea how long these had been prerolled and sitting in the kitchen.  THEN came the meal.  The steak cooked to leather consistency AND was so small.  It was literally 9 pieces that were about 1-2"" long and not even as wide or thick as a Popsicle stick.  I wasn't even sure it was the steak.  The shrimp was cooked and seasoned to perfection but the steak was a joke.  They have the new table top pay machines and ask for a survey.  While praising the staff the food and dining experience was the worst at a Chili's  We wont be returning"
Kim A.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,5,,2.0,11/18/2016,"Looking for a quick bite to eat? Chili's in Jenkintown is your place, but not if you expect quality food.  I ordered quesadilla explosion salad...basically bag o salad topped with Pico De gallo, corn and beans, served with frozen salad chicken (you know the processed white meat strips in a bag).  I know it if because we held our up to my husband's chicken and you can see it is processed.  and hubby's fajitas came with a skillet of chicken and veggies.  no rice, no beans...nada.  Didn't even bother with a drink because I didn't want to overpay for a syrupy mess with a touch of liquor.  Service was good.  This is definitely not the Chilis that we used to know."
Dawn R.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,34,30,3.0,3/3/2015,"Stopped by for a late lunch with my daughter.  Service was fast and courteous. Ordered the ""wings over buffalo"", skillet cornbread & the selections from the 2 for $20 meal. Wings and chicken fajitas were satisfying.  I didn't care for the texture of the cornbread & I wouldn't order it again. Overall, nice place for a quick meal but nothing outstanding."
Johnald T.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,5,,5.0,4/14/2016,My buddy and I strolled over to chili's last night and got the bottomless grown tortilla chips and fresh squeezed minute maid  lemonade in a spiffy glass. For the main course we got the the pretzel bacon burger with chili's famous french fries.
Erin B.,"Jenkintown, PA",1,5,,3.0,3/19/2016,"Well, the potential is there. The execution leaves a lot to be desired. They need to go back to basics with their staff- management included! This was once one of our favorite restaurants, now it's no longer even in rotation. We got a gift card for the holidays so decided to order take out last night. After placing the order online, I waited until the time indicated in the confirmation and went to pick up. The hostess pointed to a sign that said ""take out orders"" and said to stand under there. That was weird, it was in an odd place to stand. After many employees walked past me finally someone asked if I was being helped. I told her I was there to pick up an order and no, no help yet. She said oh you go to the bar for take out. Hmm, now I'm already getting annoyed at this ""process"", I head to the bar next, repeat AGAIN why I'm here, the bartender goes to check on my order. He comes back and says- sorry, we never got your order, the new computer system isn't letting us get the online orders. Well as you can see this restaurant is trying hard to not serve food. This was 8:30 pm on a Friday night and the place was practically empty, i can see why! The bartender was apologetic and sincere, he was the only one out of place... He offered to place my order and ask for the kitchen to rush if possible, which I agreed to. He said he'd let the manager know what happened. I then waited 30 minutes for the food and watched the manager walk past me at least five times without ever saying a word to me. Even a simple Hey, sorry about that would've been appreciated.  Now the food was actually quite good once I finally got it home, the Mango avocado chicken was very tasty! Or I was starving at that point!  Hopefully they find some FOH leadership and fix some of these basics! It would change a lot for their business, I guarantee it!"
Jessica L.,"Macon, GA",328,5,15,5.0,1/18/2015,"I'm not used to the touch screen ordering so I was surprised when a human greeted us.. Luckily for her we were hungry because we waited almost ten minutes just to be greeted again after being seated.. It was worth the wait, my sister and I always get the 2 for 35 which includes sharing an appetizer, two entrees, sharing a dessert, and two margaritas. We were not disappointed the drink was great, and so was everything that followed.. we had molten cake, chicken fajitas and onion rings to start. Everything was made to perfection which makes up for the long wait initially. . MMMM hmmm"
Nicole R.,"Cheltenham Township, PA",12,37,3,3.0,5/31/2015,"I could take it or leave it. The food is good for what you pay for & expect at a chain restaurant. I was unsatisfied with my most recent trip here. I went with my family- a table of four. Everything was fine at first, but the waitress did not check on us for at least 15 minutes after she dropped off the food. Some of us needed refills etc. By the time she did come over (after my little sister had to walk up to the bar & tell her we needed her), we had all already finished eating. She was actually bar tending & serving people seated at the bar while also serving tables. I don't blame her completely, but I also don't understand why the management would give her tables & expect her to bard tend on a Saturday.   When she came to our table we asked for refills, the check, and boxes-she walked away without asking how many we needed.  Keep in mind there were 4 of us, all with leftovers- but she only brought 2 boxes. We then had to wait minutes more for her to get more boxes, at which point she asked me if I needed any ramekin style to go containers for my fajita toppings. Too late- I already packaged my food. We still tipped 20%, because the service wasn't horrible- but being a former server myself, a lot of  basics were overlooked. Expect sub par to average service."
Hope R.,"Philadelphia, PA",24,43,852,3.0,1/14/2014,"Went here yesterday because we wanted to try a restaurant that opens late around our area. They're big mouth bites are amazing. Little sliders with the most flavor!!! They're chipotle boneless wings are pretty good also. I like this places because it open really late. The service is not thee greatest, but it's enough for me to go back."
Vicki D.,"Abington, PA",47,12,,1.0,3/8/2015,Sadly it was a bad experience.....sat at 8:32pm after an hours wait almost....no one approached our table for over 15 minutes then finally someone stopped to take our drink order and informed us who our waiter would be....that individual finally showed up wIth our drinks at 9pm....took our order and never came back....20 minutes later we finally had enough and no food yet the manager stopped by to check on us and we told him we were not happy...10 minutes later food finally came out but we had no utensils to eat with...that was taken care of and when we went to dig in all the food was cold....manager stopped by and asked how it was...felt bad telling him it was all cold....he took care of it for us....I think that is this first time in 30 years we have ever complained to the management.... going to stick to take because I do like there food
Steve M.,"Southampton, PA",0,6,,4.0,5/2/2013,Never a disappointment! Always consistant and quick service. I can always rely on Chilis for a good quality meal while on the run. The Quesadilla Explosion is a great salad and the Tortilla Soup is spicy and a great compliment to any meal. Highly recommmend.
Briana C.,"Willow Grove, PA",1,5,,1.0,7/2/2015,"Walked in around 9:30, didn't look too busy and employees walked by without seating us until we approached one of them 20 minutes later. We got seated and ordered our drinks. One drink came back with ice and the other did not. No straws were given and we didn't get our food order taken until about 20 minutes, and no apology was given for the long wait."
Alison S.,"Glenside, PA",132,142,3,4.0,11/19/2013,"As a self proclaimed foodie, I had to cover my face when I went in to Chili's.  Yup I'm a snob.  But, I have to say - FANTASTIC! I mean it.  I had the combo fajitas and was completely blown away.  They were HUGE and came with the usual beans and rice and pico and I ate EVERY SINGLE BIT.  Plus a bowl of chips.  I had a margarita that was amazing and I'm not a big tequila girl.  All in all, a fairly inexpensive meal and a very happy and full me.  I'd go.  However, I did go at an off time and ate at the bar.  It does get really crowded in there at peak times."
Denise C.,"Abington, PA",14,19,2,5.0,12/14/2011,"It's been a while since I've been at any Chili's but I'm glad I went! My husband and I split the 2 for $20 and it was well worth it in my book. We had the chips and avocado salsa. It had a good kick of heat which surprised me. The waitress brought out plain salsa first and when I said we asked for the other, she apologized and gladly brought us out the other. I had the quesadilla salad with avocado instead of chicken (no extra charge) and my husband had fajitas. He asked for double rice instead of rice and beans and in the end, we were charged 99 cents extra for it. When I asked the waitress, she said she must have forgot to mention it was an upcharge and she took it right off the bill. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive and I was very happy with our food.  I will certainly be going back to Chili's. They have fajita-rita Mondays (specials on fajita and margaritas) which I have not tried yet but I plan on doing soon!"
Robin C.,"Glenside, PA",89,3,,1.0,12/25/2012,"I went there with my daughter for lunch the Sunday before Christmas. I waited in the lobby for about 5 minutes without being greeted. It didn't appear to be very busy. Finally someone sat us at a booth. We sat and waited for a server to come up to us for at least 10 minutes. I have an impatient 7 year old, and was not happy. I don't really understand why servers wouldn't be aggressive to make money right before the holidays. I am a server at another restaurant, and I would have been fired if that were me. I never got served, so I got up and left. I will never try to go there again."
M. C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,100,1,2.0,11/26/2012,Good location but that's about it.  Food is average chain restaurant fare and nothing to get excited about.  Restaurant could use a remodel to open up the space.
Andrew G.,"Norwood, MA",0,74,15,1.0,11/8/2011,This place sucks. Why pay 7$ a drink or get Sysco food when Drake's is way better and right near it.
Roger K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,,2.0,5/30/2014,"I'd recommend about everything else in this area before I recommend this to anyone.  Maybe I'd send someone I don't care for.  Subpar food and service and it was off peak when I went. Server even tried to tell me what I ordered after he chose not to write anything down and messed it up.  Seriously, you had no other tables and the place wasn't closing for a while.  Good luck making tips after you defensively blame your errors on the very people you are hoping tip you."
James C.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,13,5,2.0,6/25/2011,"Service was poor. Person asked if we were there before another pair. Told us a table was being wiped down, then took the pair behind us and left us standing there."
Aria M.,"Jenkintown, PA",138,100,3,2.0,9/28/2010,"Eh, that's about it. Over flavored, over salted, artificial food with LOADS of salt and sugar. Fried and greasy and overall not good. The corn on the cob and the Mac n cheese are atrocious, I couldn't feed it to my kid as all I could taste was gallons of fake nasty butter. Gave this place a few tries and will not be going back. Looking forward to a turn around, and fast. Save your body the trouble, and go around the back to Jules Pizza or Curds and Whey."
Kevin J.,"Philadelphia, PA",161,551,103,5.0,8/10/2010,Such a welcome addition to the Jenkintown/Abington area! Not to mention the delicious food which is already well known... This particular place has really cleaned up with a brand new renovation and a superb waitstaff after a recent change in ownership. I will be checking in to this establishment often.
Shawna A.,"Oreland, PA",39,119,5,3.0,3/6/2012,"3.5. this seems like a solid chain option. the seating is cozy, the place (from what i've seen) looks pretty clean and i enjoyed my avocado burger as much as i could--knowing that it's all artificial crap (wherever i go out to eat; i don't care if it's a chain or it's not, same shit, really) always makes it hard to enjoy eating out as much as everybody else, but anyway, i digress. everybody else at my table pretty much had fajitas (chicken, shrimp and beef)...i tried the fajitas and thought they tasted good for being over-processed and a little on the salty side...i mean, i've had much better...anyway, still good. my husband says a solid four stars for above-average food, location and cleanliness but we really don't see eye-to-eye on these sorts of things."
Joss B.,"Flourtown, PA",3,19,1,2.0,4/11/2011,"My BF wanted ribs from Chili's so off we went.  An hour later, I was kicking myself for agreeing to go.  The ribs were just OK, nothing special, the fries were burned.  The apps were so-so, and my entree was really infuriating.  I got a combo platter, for $16.99, with the chicken and shrimp.  Sub veggies for potatoes.  The chicken was TINY and burned.  The shrimp were really a joke.  Ice cold, and about the size of a silver dollar.  Had I gotten the 2 for $20 deal and gotten that plate, I would have thought, ok, that's about right.  But for $20 with the side salad (that I ordered and didn't get until after the entree) I was not pleased.  Not eager to go back."
