Phi D.,"Jenkintown, PA",56,3,7,5.0,12/7/2010,The food was fresh. The service was great. Waiting time was reasonable. I never had a bad experience at Chili's. The atmosphere was warm and genuine. Location is right down the road. I love coming to Chili's in Jenkintown. Have wonderful variety of food to choice. Drink special are also great. love the hot chips and dip when its out of the oven.
