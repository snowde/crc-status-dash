Natalie W.,"Kemah, TX",0,3,1,4.0,10/17/2017,"Everything was as it always is. An average experience is drink order, food, maybe a check back and then dessert and done. Sometimes their kitchen crashes, and that's never fun. Overall, it's a chili's. Service is ok to good, and if you're kids like it, why not."
Lantz W.,"Seabrook, TX",0,5,,2.0,12/14/2017,"I was disappointed with this location. Poor service. Saw our waitress twice. Had to beg for drink refills. The food was cold and over cooked. I'm a chili's fan, but I won't be going back here."
Susan B.,"Conroe, TX",32,16,,5.0,9/18/2017,"Hubby and I were out running errands on his one day off. We decided to grab a bite, but didn't want fast food/drive-in style. We stopped in at Chili's. It was Great. Fast service, friendly staff, good food. We ate from the 2 for $22 menu; fairly good selection. The ONLY downside was they changed their strawberry lemonade. Now you don't get the bits of real strawberry in your drink.. missed that part. Otherwise, it was a good meal at a reasonable price"
James K.,"Seabrook, TX",98,2,,4.0,9/8/2017,"Had a great waiter, and the food was delivered exactly as ordered.  The place was pretty full, but everything was efficient, and the food was very good."
Linda M C.,"Bacliff, TX",3,14,1,4.0,7/20/2017,"Well thank you Chili's true to your word. When a customer speaks, they listen. After I posted a not so pleasant experience,  they listened, responded and treated me to a dinner. .. Thanks !!"
Paul N.,"League City, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Mmmm...CIGARETTE SMOKE.  Didn't know any restaurant allowed that anymore.  Walked in, walked out."
Teresa S.,"Texas City, TX",32,4,,4.0,9/21/2017,"Normally I would give 5 stars because this is my favorite place to dine and customer service is excellent every time, but my level of stars are going down because they took so many things away from the menu. So many of my favorites. This makes me unhappy and if they keep taking items away, I will no longer come to my favorite place to eat."
Ryan B.,"Bacliff, TX",0,13,12,2.0,7/10/2016,"- The only reason we have two stars is because we love the food. - This review is for this Chilis only.  - We used to go weekly. Now, every time we go they take a really long time to get service or food. We now only go about once every 6 months due to very poor service. We just went and after sitting down, after 15-20 minutes, we still did not have our waters. This is the last try for dine in. The last time we went they took 1 1/2 hours to get our food. We had a similar experience the time before and the time before that. Their excuse is always the same, their kitchen is always behind. You think after 2 years they would fix it."
Nidhi T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",22,6,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Worst place..I am a vegetarian, ordered cheese fries without Bacon..person confirmed that it's without Bacon..found pieced of bacon in the dish halfway..manager didn't even apologize..she said she doesn't know what's the process there.. All order took too long to come, no accountability..worst place ever.."
Linda S.,"League City, TX",4,16,3,4.0,4/26/2016,Great drinks; Start off will El Nino and Patron Margarita. Like sitting in the bar area. Plenty of TVs and the service is great. Been coming for years!!
World T.,"Houston, TX",6,27,6,1.0,10/22/2016,Stopped in for lunch to go- ordered steak and few burgers. Bartender less than friendly. Order didn't take long. Asked for cc without providing me my check. Gave me food no condiments or utensils. When asked for them it seemed like an imposition on her time. But I thought I was the one paying.  Hmmmm.  Got home steak semi rare -ordered well done. Burgers burnt to a crisp ordered med- well Fries old and hard.  Guess it's only good if you eat in.
R S.,"League City, TX",1,7,,1.0,10/31/2016,"Cigarette smell is just awful. Is this a family restaurant or a bar?  Cmon, chilis, grow a backbone. Separate ventilation systems isn't enough to keep it completely away from the kids.  In response to chilis, local laws and ordinances do not require smoking in family restaurants. Does chilis corporate require this choice? Corporate responsibility is still important."
J. C.,"Houston, TX",8,47,13,4.0,8/2/2015,Don't understand the low rating but our experience on August 2nd was great! We was starving after an afternoon at Kemah Boardwalk and figured let's give Chili's across the street a try.  Food was hot and fresh and the drinks was amazing. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Get the strawberry/mango frozen margarita - you will not regret it!
Derek G.,"League City, TX",0,2,,2.0,9/14/2016,"Very disappointing today! Poor quality food, took over an hour to get food (not busy), just an over all waste of having dinner out! Too many better choices around!  Won't make this mistake again!  Understaffed, under motivated, under managed!"
Ryan M.,"Seabrook, TX",2,19,5,3.0,8/30/2016,I feel the service was great and I got a server named Jon real cool dude. If you ever get a chance and see a dude named Jon working I would opt in on getting a table. I got the LC - Fajita plate and a sweet tea. I feel the food was alright nothing to go crazy over. I mean this is a chili's so I was not expecting the red carpet or anything. I was happy with the lunch price or $8 bucks however it was lacking some flavor. I feel the chicken could have been better quality. I mean it was kind of rubbery but still was alright to eat. I got a salad and feel the salad might have been turning that day however eh I just rolled with it. All in all if your looking for lunch this place does not seem to bad.
Dahlia D.,"League City, TX",85,110,96,4.0,5/16/2016,"Had a good time tonight at the chili's in Kemah. We were seated quickly, and taken care of by a nice server. He dealt with our indecisiveness, and even helped us decide what to get. Surprisingly, the food came out pretty fast. I got the new spicy pasilla chicken from the lighter choices menu. Try it with the quinoa like it comes! My husband got the prime rib burrito and it was so big he almost couldn't finish it. In all, not bad."
Dan S.,"League City, TX",20,39,10,3.0,7/22/2015,"Chili's went through some remodeling and menu changes.  Some of the stuff they had is no longer on the menu and not sure why (mozzerella sticks???).  The food is consistent, and I go here for lunch a lot because its right down the street from my office.  Usually sit in the bar area and service is great."
Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",315,474,756,1.0,2/21/2015,"The food was fantastic, and the servers were awesome! Why the one star? They allow smoking throughout the restaurant and I just can't enjoy my food when I'm choking on smoke."
Rolf F.,"League City, TX",0,3,,3.0,8/9/2016,"The food is good.  The only time we got 5 star service, is from one waiter, we were served by..Jon.  At times we can sit with our waiter and we get service that is only 3 star."
Brenda F.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,2.0,1/2/2017,Had to wait a long time for our food and then when it came it was not throughly cooked. Wait staff not attentive.
Shannon A.,"Seabrook, TX",126,6,,1.0,4/16/2016,"Food poisoning again. A year and half after our first food poisoning I decided to give them another chance. The family was super hungry and i really wanted a triple berry Margarita which was superly sweet and awful too. Never make that mistake again. We have returned in the year since for triple berry Margaritas and they were always awesome but stayed away from any actual food, not sure I will ever return even for drinks now."
Alan F.,"Houston, TX",7,29,26,4.0,8/9/2014,Drinks were great...Platinum Ritas rock. Great ribs and they don't cost an arm and a leg. My espousa enjoyed Santa Fe Chicken Quesadilla. We had a sharp waiter who got the meal out hot and on time. Recommended! 4 stars
Carmela S.,"New Orleans, LA",822,1039,3471,2.0,7/20/2015,"I stopped here on my way home from a weekend trip to meet my family for lunch!  It wasn't super busy when we first got there but, the parking can be a little tight in the lot.  They initially had us in a booth that was going to be way too tight for 6 adults and a baby so, we waited while they pushed together some other tables. They have little ""tablet"" type consoles on the table that you can purchase and play games on or pay your bill on with a card.  Personally I think that just gives people more of a reason to go out together and ignore each other; like most people do on their phones. The service took forever and we were there for a good two hours.  Obviously we picked a chain place because it would be quicker and I still had a 3.5 hour drive back to Austin.  It took a long time to get our drinks, our appetizers came out quickly but not complete and our food took over 40 minutes after the appetizers.  Either our server was overwhelmed or he was just not good at multitasking.  We had to ask for refills and sat without refills for a while before we saw him again to ask. The food:  I mean it's chili's and it's a chain so, I didn't have big expectations at all because most of their stuff comes in pre-made, frozen and definitely not made in house.  The Southwestern egg rolls were actually decent as well as the dipping sauce.  We decided to try their new White queso with spinach and I wouldn't recommend it.  They dropped it off without the chips so, it got cold by the time our chips came.  Then It was like just melted cheese that I actually had to cut with a fork, with some creamy queso underneath (not a lot) and it had some pico, onions and guacamole on top.  Also, the chips were super greasy.  For my main meal I had the Fresh Mex Bowl with shrimp in it.  I would say it was  stars.  It was supposed to be spicy but, I had to ask for some more sauce and he brought me a chipolte sauce which worked well but, the lettuce with the rice and all the other flavors just didn't blend well.  The shrimp were way over done and this made them chewy; also, they were flavorless! After all this we waited for another 15 minutes before our server came back to get the card to pay the bill and bring our togo chicken fingers that my great aunt ordered. I can't say I am too surprised because you know what you are getting when you come to a chain like this but, I was hoping to be surprised!"
Dawn D.,"League City, TX",32,5,,1.0,7/4/2015,"Yelp made me give a star,  I don't think they deserve a star! After going to see the fireworks in Kemah we went to Chili's, the worst mistake ever!!!!! We could tell the server wasn't happy we came in and sat at his table,no greeting, no hello....it was more like""what can I get ya to drink"" He didn't even give us his name, I ordered a margarita, it was the kind in a shaker, I thought he was supposed to pour it for me, NOPE I was wrong! He pretty much slammed it down and walked away!!! We ordered our food, I got a guacamole burger with roasted jalapeños grilled onions and peppers , well what I got was a burger with a small spoonful of guacamole with a few little red specks of red pepper, no roasted jalapeños, no onions, nothing!!! Now the roasted jalapeños, that's the reason I ordered the burger to begin with, they are my favorite!!! When I brought this to my servers attention, he said oh ok I'll fix it, as he walked away rolling his eyes!  He brought me back the same burger with a side of pickled jalapeños!!! WHAT?????? Pickled is a far cry from roasted!!!! Needless to say I didn't eat dinner!! Thanks for nothing!!!! Don't eat here, it's horrible!!!!"
Troy K.,"Kemah, TX",335,352,1113,3.0,6/10/2012,Well it is a Chili's so you know what you are getting food wise. This Chili's is one of the best ones I have been to. The staff is really friendly and top notch. Happy Hour in the bar is pretty much all the time and the bartenders are great. If you go often you will see a lot of the same folks in the bar so it has a nice Cheers kind of vibe. Yes they do allow smoking in the bar but I have rarely had too many smokers in there.  Happy hour in the bar gets you free chips and salsa if you ask and I have to say these are some great chips and salsa. Really they are better than many mexican places I visit.  My go to meal here is to split a Triple dipper with my wife. Great value and plenty of food for 2.
Sarah P.,"Seabrook, TX",41,9,,1.0,11/11/2015,Sat for 10 minutes and no one came to the table to ask for our drink order or anything. It wasn't even busy. So we left and had Hoagie Ranch where we were greeted and had out drink order taken before we even sat down. Don't waste your time here. Go across the street instead.
Jesse T.,"Houston, TX",0,17,1,1.0,6/19/2015,"This location is worthless, I called for a ToGo order and I was put on hold for 8 min. I called again and person on the phone said they were busy, that's a damn lie that place is never busy. Oh and there's no such thing as a non smoking section, the entire place smells of cigarettes."
Lori P.,"League City, TX",0,17,,4.0,5/16/2016,"Came here on a whim with the family, after not coming for years due to the food not being good last time I came. Tonight the food was awesome! Our server Jessica was really good too. I ordered my sirloin steak rare and it was cooked PERFECT!! I can defitnely say they have revamped their menu and we will be back more often!"
Joshua P.,"League City, TX",0,13,,1.0,4/29/2015,Waiter was rude as hell and it was mid day really slow. Had an attitude as if the place was mayhem!
Tonys M.,"Houston, TX",4,10,3,2.0,3/25/2016,"The last two times I have been to this Chili's I have had the same problem: some type of ""hot"" sauce is added to the food. The first time it was the salad had some sauce added to it that I specifically asked not be on the salad. Have you tried to eat a hot, spicy salad? The server took it back, but it seemed all that was done was the top lettuce scraped off and the ""hot sauce"" was left at the bottom of the plate. Tonight I ordered chicken fajitas and it came with some hot ""chipotle butter"" drizzled over the meat and grilled onions. I asked why it had the sauce on it and was told it has always come with that. I don't like hot, spicy sauce and I have never had this ""chipotle butter"" on my fajitas before. I complained to the manager and they made the chicken again, but it was just a piece of grilled chicken without much flavor. They have hot sauce and spice on everything. This is a real deal breaker for me because I don't like spicy.....The waiter was helpful, but it took over 10 minutes before he was told that we were his table. Don't know if we will return to Chili's after two bad experiences in a row. We have been going to Chili's since the original opened on Greenville Ave. in Dallas back in the day. Sad to have to say ""adios"" to this old friend. It's not me, it is you that has changed. :("
Daniel L.,"College Station, TX",0,6,1,2.0,12/27/2014,"I normally like Chili's and while the food was good it all had an after taste of cigarette. I was very uncomfortable having my young kids  in that place. Next time you go to a Chili's try the flatbread, hold the ash and festering smoker's lung."
Kyle H.,"League City, TX",5,1,,1.0,2/27/2015,This place was terrible.  The waiter lost our order and when we finally got our food anything fried tasted like bad grease.
Nicole B.,"Seabrook, TX",0,23,1,2.0,8/3/2014,"I'm a big fan of Chilis sirloin steak, pretty good for a 11$ steak. I enjoy my steak rare & they normally cook it right. I went there this evening, told the host table for 1 he asked me if I'd like sit in bar area. I saw there was a football game on so I said yes. I sat for quit some time but no one came over, I went back to host & told him,he said he'd grab a waiter, I told him it was to smoky anyway so I'd sit in normal seat. I guess there wasn't enough servers cause it took forever then the girl that helped me wasn't even my waitress. I ordered my steak rare & it was over cooked. The remade it correctly & the manager apologized. I hope they get it together because I normally like it. But it's nice they corrected it."
MT F.,"Houston, TX",1,25,2,1.0,4/26/2014,I don't know how this or any otger chili's  restaurant stays in business.  I have $$ left on a gift card I'd gladly give away.
Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211,3.0,2/27/2012,"Chilis is always predictable and good. This Kemah location allows smoking in their bar, so I got the added bonus of smelling like an ashtray with my meal."
Danny C.,"Houston, TX",15,11,3,3.0,12/29/2013,"Mehhhh. It's Chili's. Had a gift card. Won't go back until I receive another gift card. I can some it up in 3 words. Mediocre, mundane, and predictable. There are better places. Pass this place up."
Nikita P.,"Dickinson, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Terrible service. I give no stars. I tried calling for a to go order and I was on hold for 25 minutes. Called again and it was the same thing. Then my friend called they put her on hold for a long time and finally answered her phone call. They were not polite at all, I felt uncomfortable on the phone as if I was bothering them to get some food."
C D.,"League City, TX",0,12,1,1.0,9/15/2014,"What a terrible experience! I think that Chilis is using their ""convenient table kiosks"" as a replacement for staff and customer service. They need to hire more staff instead of relying on one or two people to service a restaurant -- where is management?Too bad the table kiosk can't refill my drink (after all, I would like more than one glass with an entire meal,) or clear the numerous plates off my table so that I don't have to shuffle app plates and dinner plates while I try to eat my lukewarm dinner. Lower your expectations if you decide to come here; you'll get better service and food at a gas station."
John N.,"Houston, TX",2,30,4,3.0,8/31/2009,"I would have given this place 4 stars, but they took Shiner Bock off of the draft menu. I asked the manager about this, and he said they only were allowed 1 draft besides the beers that are mandated by corporate. He chose Dos Equis, he said it was more popular. I doubt it, but just in case, start demanding Shiner to see if we can get it back!  Anyway, the food is good here, the service is fast. I don't think I've had to wait more than 10 minutes on a Friday night (7:30ish). The new 2 for $20 deals are great, you get an appetizer, two meals (you can choose from many of the less than $10 menu items) and a desert.  Unfortunately, my favorite, the Jalapeno Smokehouse Burger isn't on the 2 for $20 list. The bacon on that burger is incredible and the Jalapeno ranch sauce is to die for. I can't set foot in that restaurant without ordering extra jalapeno ranch sauce to go with my fries."
David G.,"League City, TX",0,3,1,1.0,1/1/2014,"The food and drinks at the restaurant is excellent, but they recently made a policy change which has been infuriating.  The restaurant used to serve ""Happy Hour"" specials throughout the entire restaurant.  They now only serve those specials in the bar.  The bar is always constantly filled with smoke - so much so that I ask to sit as far away as possible.  Even though it's segregated by a wall, the smoke lingers far into the non-smoking section.  I am allergic to cigarette smoke.  Since I can't go into the bar, I can't get the specials.  This new policy is very descriminating against non smokers and those like me who may have allergies. I know there are others out there who feel the same way.  This restaurant will get no more of my business until they stop this discrimination by either opening the specials up to the whole restaurant or making the bar smoke free."
