Amy M.,"League City, TX",1,20,2,4.0,8/30/2010,I love that you can make an online order and set it for a certain time for pick up and it's actually ready on time! Everything was right and they were polite and fast. Thats just what I need when I have a short lunch break and traffic to beat. I love it. I'm looking forward to going to actually sit down and enjoy myself with a drink.
Mary P.,"League City, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/28/2011,"Don't get to go orders from here unless you pay with cash. After writing the final amount on the merchant copy, I look at my bank statement a couple days later and an extra $5 is added onto the amount. Never going there again with anything other than cash."
