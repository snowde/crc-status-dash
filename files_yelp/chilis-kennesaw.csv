Anna S.,"Atlanta, GA",23,106,98,4.0,1/7/2018,"My dog died last week and I've been drinking a shit ton of tequila. Grabbed a spot at the bar and ordered up. She asked if I wanted a double. I just looked at her as if she had to ask. We smiled. She poured. This double looked like a single and was nearly $10. For what I've had this week, it would cost me $100 to get an appropriate buzz at Chili's. Even I expect a lap dance for that. Overall enjoyable experience. Great appetizers as always,  then families started pouring in with their kids. Uh uh. No. Time to go."
Patti A.,"Sandy Springs, GA",527,26,12,1.0,7/25/2017,Ordered lunch. My assistant felt like they were very short with her. No one was anywhere near paying attention for curbside orders. The food arrived and the chicken crisper were really bad. So greasy it was sitting in a small pool of grease. One of the chicken fingers was really off- gray and rubbery. The cilantro vinaigrette is gross. The side salad was literally mixed greens with light cheese and nothing else. The corn had weird bits of cheese stuck to it and was cold.  The whole experience still makes me sick to my stomach.
Tori B.,"Marietta, GA",47,69,110,2.0,12/9/2017,"Chili's is normally average at best and anyone dining there shouldn't expect much more. However tonight was bottom of the barrel when it came to service. Our server must have been new, as she rang in our appetizer order wrong. It took 45 minutes to come out & we had already had our entrees at the table so we asked for it to be boxed. It never made it home with us. The manager visited to apologize about the wait and both she & the server blamed a new cook for the issue.. very unprofessional."
Kristina M.,"Kennesaw, GA",75,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"I came here to get quick, decent food for myself and my daughter. I can honestly say that I felt robbed. Not only did we wait 15 minutes to be greeted, but everything we had was inedible. Their cheeseburger was a grease bomb, which was soaked in yellow mustard, their fancy ass grilled corn made me Gag, and my daughters chicken was burnt to a crisp. I am not a picky eater and have never ever written a yelp review, but I'm encouraging every hard working person to NOT waste their hard earned money here. I'm so grossed out and disappointed that I will tell everyone I know how terrible it was. This is the first dining experience I've ever had that made me wish I had asked to ""speak to a manager."""
Tara B.,"Atlanta, GA",26,78,282,1.0,3/30/2017,"Their service is Complete Garbage!!  It's not often that I give less than 3 stars, but this place is horrible. Party of 8 on a Saturday evening, no reservations, so you expect wait time. My family and I left Cracker Barrel and chose this place instead. Mistake.  They said 35 minute wait so after 50 minutes one of my aunts went to walk around to look at availability. Spoke to a manager. We were told that we could be seated at two tables next to each other but they couldn't be pulled together. At first I though it wasn't possible bc of the way the tables were seated, so I was like whatever. BTW, we were told the tables were ready and the hostess simply pointed in the general vicinity of the tables, didn't walk us to them.... didn't understand why the tables weren't able to be pulled together when we guessed which tables they were.  Regardless of the mishaps thus far, we were determined to enjoy each other. Our waiter was good in the beginning. 45 minutes had passed and we still have no food. Other patrons have arrived, finished their food and left restaurant and still no food. Mind you, because the wait was so long we all knew exactly what to order before we were seated so our orders were placed immediately. We asked our waiter if he could check on an eta for the food. With an attitude he snaps, it's a large party so it's going to take longer. We say nothing in response to the unwarranted attitude because the food hasn't come out and we're not chancing you taking it out on our food.  So we continue waiting...no update. Food gets there. Two of the plates were cold and sent back. Chicken tenders weren't even room temperature, they were cold. My mom's meal didn't even come out until several minutes after everybody else because they forgot it. When we asked for simple items like napkins and condiments, we had to ask multiple times. The 3rd time asking, I was given more attitude. I had a burger and needed mayo to begin eating it so at this point, I matched his attitude. Bro, we've been at the restaurant for almost two hours at this point, I'm hungry, your service has dropped below subpar and my patience for you is nonexistent at this point.  Let's just say that someone else ended up serving us for a while because the original server was ""missing"" for a while.  Meanwhile, the two tables next to us were pulled together for a party the same size as us. *side eyes and blank stares* Why wasn't this offer extended to us. We're all paying customers!! The manager was called to hear about our whole experience and how it's totally unacceptable.  I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. I'll also let my friends, family and associates know about the experience so they can take their business elsewhere."
Terry L.,"Canton, GA",16,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,Service was great. The problem was no kitchen staff showed up for work. There literally was only 1 person for the kitchen. Probably will not eat here again.
Miles D.,"Marietta, GA",1,2,,2.0,1/1/2018,"went there to grab an early dinner. the place was freezing. we were told a heater broke over a week ago. everyone was bundled up in hoodies and winter gear. the food took fifty minutes to arrive and when it did some of it was cold. we were never approached by anyone to ask if everything was ok. we did not complain either as im not going to give the server a hard time for a poorly functioning kitchen. would have given 1 star, but the server was fine and did her job accordingly. typical big corporation sub par food place. there is a reason i have not been to a chilis, applebees, fridays ect.. in ages and today i am reminded exactly why."
Karo R.,"Powder Springs, GA",1224,400,1170,5.0,11/16/2014,"This Chili's totally Rocks!!!! I'm not a big fan of Chili's restaurant, but they hey have completely changed their menu since the last time I visited a Chili's restaurant.  Here on a lunch date a little after noon, I ordered the fajita's, and they were really good. Our server was so the coolest bartender I have met in a while. He was very attentive, very social, taught us how to use the electronic order system and also how to play games with it, he even encouraged us to go on social media and post pictures lol - hilarious.  My date was also impressed with the food as well as the service, and the drinks were definitely on point and we had a great time at this particular location."
Tiwaa Y.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,7/14/2017,My food was uncooked and also she brought the wrong bill and over charged that's not cool
Robert C.,"Decatur, GA",6,45,,2.0,5/29/2017,"My Mom wanted to try this Chili's since she likes their baby back ribs. She ordered them and enjoyed them, but that's about all I can say that's good about this place. My Mom is 91. And whatever she wants, she gets. :) I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. It was OK. The salmon was over-cooked and the dressing was very blah. The real downer of this place is the management and staff. Everyone is very nice, but it is very disorganized and poorly run. It was ironic that we were told the wait staff works on a buddy system so two people can tag-team to improve our experience. I think each one thought the other one was servicing us since we got no one. It was by far the worst service I have received in years. I had to get up and walk to find someone to help us several times. The dessert took so long we just cancelled it. On top of that, and I know this sounds awful, but the personal hygiene of several of the wait staff was just horrible; they had body oder and appeared unbathed. Not something you want at a restaurant. And the tables were sticky, and went uncleared for a long time. So you sit next to a table with a ton of dirty dishes. I think the next time my Mom wants their baby back ribs, I'll just get them 'to go' so I don't have to sit in this place and be ignored."
Heather S.,"Youngstown, OH",6,26,9,1.0,12/18/2016,Hubby still waiting for take out order to be right.  They forgot half the order and that part was wrong.  So now the food is going to be cold.   Not cool chilis.
Robbie G.,"Cartersville, GA",41,367,99,2.0,8/18/2015,The service is not that good at this location. We never got refills had to eat cheese fries with no plates. The food  is ok after I had to send it back to get it fixed but dang the service was so poor.
John Q.,"Atlanta, GA",1,27,43,4.0,12/20/2015,Service was way better than expected.  I sat at the bar and multiple employees made sure everything was good to go!  They were very friendly and attentive.  I was pleasantly surprised at the high level of customer service I received.  And I did enjoy my beer and the meal!
J F.,"Marietta, GA",9,124,278,1.0,8/8/2015,Bartender was horrible. ..worse attitude ever! Came in a hour before closing yesterday 8/7/2015 and couldn't even enjoy my food. ..not to mention the chicken was cold and the long island was weak! Ugh. ..
Adam B.,"Hiram, GA",1,58,7,1.0,1/9/2016,"I was told I would have a 45 minute wait. On a busy Saturday night that is expected. While waiting for a table more than 6 tables came available and it took them over 15 minutes to clean them. Not very efficient. After being seated we ordered and then the wait continued. Again, expected for a Saturday night. Once our food arrives my broccoli was cold and my burger was bordering between luke warm and cold. Our server barely refilled our drinks. If it were not for the fact that we had a gift card, I would have left much sooner."
Ashley W.,"Atlanta, GA",33,4,1,2.0,12/6/2015,"Service in the bar area is miserably painful to watch & attend. Fry app took 15+ min to hit the table then another 15+ min to let the server know they came out cold. By that point no sense in waiting for a recook. I come from the service industry, so very unfortunate experience here & can't say this is a destination of return in the future."
Tony M.,"Woodstock, GA",188,268,93,3.0,3/7/2015,"Food: 2-stars Service: 4-stars Final Rating: 3-stars I sat at the bar for lunch on a weekday and Steven proved himself to be an exceptional server for what I was expecting.  Beyond the appropriate follow-ups to see if I needed anything and to refill my water, what I was most impressed with was how he handled my comment that the avocado slices on my sandwich were not ripe enough. Since I was short on time and already feeling full, I told him not to worry about them.  I didn't need replacement slices. However, no more than two minutes later, a manager approached with a dish of replacement avocado slices.  He apologized for the unripe ones and waited for me to let him know if the new ones were acceptable. All in all, not what I expected from a Chili's. I did find the fries to be lacking and with an odd lingering aroma.  Must be the seasoning they add? The chicken in the sandwich was bland and totally lacking seasoning. The beef chili with shredded cheese was a pale imitation of canned Hormel chili if I had to guess. So, the food - not so much a draw.  But, the service is a winner.  I still have money on the holiday gift card.  When I return, I'll order something else and see how that turns out.  =)"
Scott C.,"Marietta, GA",1,2,,1.0,11/20/2015,Waitress forgot to put our order in after waiting 30 min.   They brought kids food out 10 mins later and our food 20 min later.  Kids meals were free.  We will never eat at this Chili's again.
Adrienne T.,"Atlanta, GA",140,814,120,3.0,3/30/2013,"Hadn't been to a Chili's in years. Stopped in here last night after a movie. They sure have changed their menu.  I couldn't find anything I wanted.  Oh well. Service was s.l.o.w. Our server, Lauren, was very nice.  A manager guy came by, even though he was quite busy himself getting food out and what not, and checked on us- I appreciated that. That's it."
Tanya M.,"Kennesaw, GA",1,22,,5.0,1/26/2016,"Last night me and my boyfriend decided to come here after not being here for a while. Ordered the Cajun chicken pasta, he got a chicken quesadilla. Overall food was delicious and was gotten very quickly. We absolutely loved our server Purdie! Very personal, loved how she treated us like she was talking to her family, made us feel comfortable and she's a great example of what a server should strive to be."
Francine S.,"Kennesaw, GA",6,20,1,5.0,12/13/2015,"My boyfriend had been boycotting Chili's since they quit having his favorite Country Fried Steak. But in a moment of severe hunger we went. We were pleasantly surprised at the changes they had made. The food in the skillets are amazingly delicious. The deserts, even though we didn't have one, looked amazing. Our waiter Kevin was funny and a great server. We will definitely be returning and getting that skillet chocolate chip cookie."
Will R.,"Marietta, GA",0,31,2,4.0,1/4/2015,"Ok where do I start The food here is really good. I honestly think it is one of the better tasting restaurants I've been at, and I would love to re visit here But this place gives my wallet a workout, not to mention slow service, but I'll give the server points for being kind. I recommend this location, but to patient people"
Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,3.0,9/16/2014,"When will I find a five star Chili's? This isn't it. My soup was warm, warm? Why can't it be hot?  Doesn't the microwave work? The server only stopped by once. I guess if you are alone and not drinking then you need less attention even if you did just spend 35.00 on food. Oh well, her tip reflected it."
Kathy R.,"Canton, GA",0,1,,2.0,6/28/2016,"Food was good, place was dirty, bathrooms were deplorable!!!!! Poopoo on the floor in the women's!! Husband and son said the men's was even worse. Apparently neither been attended/cleaned in months Not going back"
David G.,"Ankeny, IA",13,130,3,3.0,1/28/2015,"Ordered take out tonight while staying at a nearby hotel. A little disappointed with the ribs, fries and caesar salad I ordered. The ribs were ok, but a bit tough. The beer BBQ sauce tasted great. Unfortunately, the Caesar salad was made with iceberg lettuce. I've eaten at dozens of Chili's restaurants across the country and have always ordered the same thing. I probably will not visit this location again."
Dylan S.,"Highland, IN",0,5,,2.0,9/18/2014,"I've been to this place twice and both times the food was mediocre. The guacamole was over powered by lime juice, spinach dip was watery and the quesadillas....UGH!  Hard and horrible. Thanks but no thanks I'm done with Chilis."
Christina W.,"Marietta, GA",33,102,4,2.0,10/28/2012,"Even though there are a lot of restaurants off of Barrett Parkway, my husband and I are a glutton for punishment.  We've optimistically been there three times hoping it would get better but get more disappointed with each visit.  The service is poor as they have unmotivated staff that don't seem to want to wait on you.  Food is actually OK, but we just can't get past the poor service.   Good food but consistently poor service is a reflection of their management."
Leslie D.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,1.0,1/10/2016,Regulars are served before you. Dishes are done before you. Managers are more concerned with closing out previous shift than their bartenders closing out guests right in front of him. Sat for at least ten minutes before ordering drinks. Never received waters asked for.
Leigh P.,"Kennesaw, GA",2,9,1,1.0,12/12/2011,"If I could give a negative star rating, I would. EVERYTIME we go here the service is atrocious, the food is bland, cold or both and the management team is non-existant.  Sure, it's a chain restaurant so changing for the better and listening to your local customers will never occur to any of the game changers sitting higher up so long as their bottom line stays in the black.. Pity."
Mize C.,"Smyrna, GA",10,2,6,4.0,11/18/2013,The southwest chicken soup is fabulous!! The best soup thus far for any chain restaurant I've been to
Lauren L.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,13,4,4.0,5/13/2014,The Santa Fe chicken salad is amazing !! I alter it and substitute the chicken for shrimp/ranch for the Santa Fe dressing/and add onions !! Delish :))
Christen M.,"Marietta, GA",0,11,1,1.0,8/4/2014,"I decided to write a review after having my 2nd awful experience. I have been in the service industry for years, so I am the first person to forgive a server who is overwhelmed or food that takes longer than usual to arrive. However, poor attitudes are inexcusable and can't make up for the other things. Twice in a row, we've had one server talking negatively about us right beside our table. Obviously not smart enough to realize that the noisy restaurant wasn't enough to drown her out. Either the manager didn't care or she simply wasn't surprised, because when I told her what we had experienced, she simply said she apologized and would speak to her. The past time we've gone, the waitress never once said you're welcome when we said thank you, didn't bother to check on us and take our entree order until our appetizers sat empty for a few minutes, leading to a 2 hour lunch on a Thursday. As I've stated previously, I'm the first person to forgive and excuse a waitperson, but Chilis, please focus more on either keeping your staff happy or different ways to deal with bad attitudes. A group of teenagers can try your patience, but when I had to witness this waitress being short and rude to my own father, it was too much to handle. The manager came by, I told him how our experience was going and he simply apologized. No offer for a complimentary dessert or even to take care of our appetizer? Extremely disappointed in these last two visits and I will be looking forward to having my many lunches and dinners out at other places along Barrett Parkway. There are way too many places to dine, where our patronage is appreciated to have to deal with such bad customer service. Very sorry to have to write this review, but maybe this will give a little bit of a wake up call to the managers."
Jade M.,"Atlanta, GA",37,45,35,4.0,1/28/2012,"There's something about the ice at this place. Same as Zaxby's and The Varsity. Makes the drink taste so good!  The staff is always very friendly and courteous. We recently visited with a friends little boy and he was a little loud at times but they were just as friendly and helpful as they could be. Great service, they are always working hard and manager does a great job of checking on tables and getting anything you need, sometimes without asking. The margaritas are great! Love the quesadilla explosion salad. The bottomless chips and dip are a must! Sorry if I'm helping ""competition"" of Yelp here but if you check-in on FourSquare you get free chips and dip."
Charisse M.,"Atlanta, GA",76,126,27,3.0,2/1/2010,"I will keep this short because A) this is a chain restaurant and B) I'm really not a ""fan"" of this place; I just had a gift certificate that I've waited over a year to use.  They have a new drink called the World's Freshest Margarita, which I really appreciate because I hate fake margaritas-- you know the nasty ones made with sugar and sweet and sour mix. Blech. These have a bit of agave nectar, fresh lime, and tequila. Nothing else, delicious!  I ordered the beef fajitas and the meat was surprisingly actually very nicely cooked and seasoned. However, they did put an overwhelming amount of onions on the skillet compared to peppers.  Um, that is it."
Tina R.,"Powder Springs, GA",95,18,40,4.0,11/20/2012,"Really nice staff.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at this Chili's.  We asked for Blackberry Lemonades like we get at our hometown Chili's.  The server had never had a request for that before, but he was kind enough to have the bartender make them for us.  He could have easily said no, but instead was very accommodating.  We really appreciated his service."
Jenny C.,"Hixson, TN",5,81,49,5.0,7/29/2012,An early evening meal was yummy & on par with other Chili's restaurants. Great place to stop.
christy w.,"Kennesaw, GA",16,28,,2.0,10/2/2009,"Went here on a friday night. cause I heard they have buy one get one free margaritas. I always come to chilis with low expectations, because they usually suck!  Was informed that Cobb county can't serve free drinks due to the couty laws. Whatever! Cobb County you suck! So anyway I got  a cosmopolitan for the first time. It was really strong so had to order a cranberry juice to mix it with. Had kids with me so couldnt be buzzed! The food, I got the queso for an appetizer and it was awesome, I also got the three item dish where you pick from the appetizers. That wasnt very good either. I got the southwestern eggrolls, wings over buffalo, and spinach dip. I basically wound up eating just the queso and wings over buffalo. The seating at chilis always sucks cause the tables and booths are always so close together that your boobs wind up on top of the table. Again another failure at chilis, why do I keep coming back!?"
Harry B.,"Kennesaw, GA",114,34,,1.0,11/30/2011,"Went here for a birthday dinner for a friend. They were horrible! They made us wait about 30 minutes to seat us, then when were finally seated, they put our group at a separate tables, which we weren't expecting. We had to wait another 20 minutes to get a group of tables together, and then ofcourse it took forever to get the food. I was so pissed I just walked out without paying (as did a few others I believe). They didn't deserve a dime from me. Never going back again."
Ben C.,"Powder Springs, GA",19,3,1,4.0,12/4/2010,"Chili's always has great food at great prices! The atmosphere is just perfect, too!"
