Taylor M.,"Bloomingdale, IL",562,1072,903,4.0,8/21/2010,"I have no issues with the tap water they serve and I always heard that legal all restaurants have to filter their tap water before serving it. Anyways, I this is the Chili's I always go to and I have never had an issue. As far as Chili's go, I think this is one of the best! The service is great, my order is always right and the manager is always walking around greeting customers and asking how their meals are. I went for lunch two weeks ago to try the all you can eat soup and salad and it was really good. I liked the cheesy enchilada soup and Caesar salad. I was also very happy that the meal came with chips and salsa. I would definitely return!"
David K.,"Mundelein, IL",0,6,,1.0,3/21/2014,My first slam on yelp. I don't like to slam anybody but I couldn't just ignore how pathetic my meal was yesterday. Dry rub ribs. Thinnest ribs I've ever seen. Whatever animal they sacrificed had an eating disorder. The food was so overcooked I struggled to eat anything. I should have gone to 7/11 to buy beef jerky. It couldn't have been any worse. Didn't have the time to return the meal. I was in a hurry.
Diana I.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2014,If I could give this chili's no stars I would.  Karen is very unprofessional.  We waited 40 minutes for our food. When our food arrived it was missing sides and it was dry.  My friend took one bite of her burger and it was bone dry.  We asked Karen the manager if we could switch her meal and she said you'll have to pay the difference. The waiters were more worried about their own personal problems than the customers service. It was a very bad experience. I will never be returning to another chili's.
Connie S.,"Palatine, IL",0,11,8,1.0,7/6/2013,Food was ok. Service was bad. Went in the afternoon so they were not busy. Had a server named Eric  who brought our drinks then the food. We asked for water and that was the last we seen of him. We did see his back several times at a friends table.  We asked the blonde waitress in the bar area to get our waiter we said we didn't get the water nor the soup for the combo. She was very nice to bring it to us. Eric still didn't show up. We finished and  got his attention. With the bill he asked did we need anything else. We said no the other waitress got it. Sorry we left him tip. Shud have given to waitress. We will not be back
Sarah M.,"Palatine, IL",23,51,16,2.0,9/3/2012,"Now don't get me wrong. Chili's is my ""go to"" place. As in, the place I ""go to"" when I can't figure out where to ""go to"". However, this visit was far under par. I've had several visits to this particular Chili's location that fit in this category, unfortunately. The water is funky, the servers are rather unengaged, and the food is handled poorly. I had the shrimp tacos, which I LOVE at every other Chili's, but these were wrapped in stale tortillas, and extremely-over-ripe-borderline-rotten avocadoes. Management was MIA, as will I be from this wilted Chili's."
Stephanie A.,"Lake Barrington, IL",8,3,1,1.0,5/1/2013,"I'm a chili's regular but I will NEVER return to this location. Dined here yesterday and had my worst chilis experience ever. We sat in the bar area and there was only 1 other table. The menus were beyond disgusting! They were caked with so much food and something sticky that the pages were getting stuck together. Drinks were delivered promptly but when our pretzel sticks came to the table I was extremely disappointed. The cheese looked as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while on top of the fact that the ramekin was only half full. (Luckily they were free since I'm a member of their email club.) Our server never returned to take our order until we were practically done with the app. When a server returned, not our server because he was ""too busy"" since he had 1 other table, she took our order for him. When I asked about the cheese I was told that's how it always is and that its one of the things she really dislikes on their menu. Dinner took awhile to arrive and it was just ok to say the least!!! The fact that the best part of our meal was the carmelized onions on my fajitas is embarrassing!!! During our visit a single man was also sat at a high table in the bar area. I watched him get up and go to the server station to get something to clean his table because it was never wiped down. He then asked one of the servers to clean it for him. He did not look happy!!! I will return to chili's but never to this location!! There are so many other places in deer park to dine and I'm sorry that we chose chili's!!"
Chris X.,"Libertyville, IL",42,82,1,1.0,8/24/2013,"This Chilis location is really dirty-- sticky seats, sticky floor, food all over the floor.  Walk by the entrance to the kitchen if you dare... food all over the filthy floor.  Service was not very good... asked for a few minutes to look over the menu, but took forever for the server to come back.  Same thing happened at the end of the meal-- literally had to track down the server and get her to take our money.  Restaurant wasn't even that full"
Joseph P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",30,471,1430,2.0,1/22/2012,"Saturday night and nearly dead at 9pm.  Not a good sign. Came here for an after-movie dinner and came away wishing I'd gone somewhere else, as they have slipped from past performance.  Started with the Southwest Egg Rolls - 3 ""tubes"", each sliced in half, for $9.  Ok, but not worth it.  The Spicy Chicken Wrap was pretty good.  The Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich was not - a dry, hard coated chicken patty deep fried, with a little ranch dressing & hot sauce dabbed on top, on a bun.  Both come with plain fries - fresh, but nothing special. Service was friendly, but sloppy - server spent too much time gabbing with the bartender across the room, and didn't deliver the hot sauce requested nor refill drinks in a reasonable time. All around us, others were loudly cleaning up the place as if getting ready to close - at 9:30?   The new wireless ""Video Toys"" on the table are novel, but have limited use - they are mostly electronic menu suggestions and a pay-for-play game machine. You can pay your bill on them - they default to suggesting a 20% tip if you let them.  They take up too much space for what they add."
Kevin K.,"Barrington, IL",26,19,,2.0,12/15/2011,"REALLY slow at night, despite the fact that maybe 20% of the tables have customers. Unfortunately there's pretty much no other restaurants open past 9:30 in the area, except Five Guys. Wouldn't go here if you can help it. Gets 2 stars though because the food is actually above average for a Chili's."
Hannah K.,"Palatine, IL",4,38,,2.0,2/24/2012,"Ugh.  Eating at Chili's is the sign that you couldn't decide on anywhere better and settled.  The food is meh, the staff is always rude, and the food is over priced for what it is.  The worst part about this place is the staff.  While I don't demand smiles from a server, I would appreciate getting something better than ""I hate this job and I'm dead inside"" eyes from the person who will be handling my food."
Erica H.,"Wauconda, IL",0,3,,4.0,1/3/2014,"My family and I frequent this Chili's location.  We used to eat there once a week when both our kids had soccer practice, but now we find ourselves only in there 1-2 per month.  This is one of the best Chili's in the area.  We have seen management turn over several times, but the kitchen staff seems to remain constant because the food comes out the same every time.  We have our favorite waitress, Elaine who always takes care of us and has gotten to know our family over the years.  When Elaine is not there, the service is average.  Elaine could teach the servers a thing or two.  Overall, our experience is always favorable.  Food comes out hot and tasty every time."
Ron S.,"Chicago, IL",6,150,1,3.0,2/15/2011,This Chili's is getting 3 stars because the food and service are just average like any other Chili's that isn't horrible. No issues with this location and I would go back one day.
Alicia A.,"Palatine, IL",0,2,,1.0,6/27/2013,I have been to this chillies several times and was very happy with experience....until lady night! Kyle was generally a good waiter till he charged my friend for the wrong meal! Then told her not to worry that he will reverse it. She checked today and he charged her for both! So she called today and the manage was extremely rude! I'll never step foot in that restaurant again because of poor service by several employees! Oh and my receipt he charged me wrong amount also! He received $1 for tip instead of $7...oh well
Liberty F.,"Lake, IL",0,65,7,1.0,3/27/2010,"Tap water is from a well and not filtered - tastes HORRIBLE!  They need a reverse osmosis system!  Terrible service when they were not even busy, and ribs were very dry.  Was 3 yrs since last Chillis visit, and probably not again."
Junie D.,"Noblesville, IN",0,72,,1.0,10/4/2010,"I don't mind Chili's, but I've got up and left this location several times because the wait staff didn't come within a reasonable amount of time.  RRR."
