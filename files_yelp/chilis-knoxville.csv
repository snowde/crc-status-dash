Brittany W.,"Knoxville, TN",18,92,46,5.0,8/24/2015,"The service was very nice because we went when it was slow before school was really out. It you want to have a girls lunch with no screaming kids then go around 2-3 pm. It was so quiet and there was actual parking.  The server was EXTREMELY helpful and knowledgeable. I believe his name was Curtis. He actually asked and let us choose whatever table we wanted. No one has ever asked that question and I really wish other restaurants would. He check in on us not too much but just right. The menus were already on the table completely out of the way. There was more than just one napkin (I raised my hands in a silent hell yes for this one!).  Food was delicious and served at a good time. Everything was hot (good thing)! My mom's only complaint was that there should be a little bowl of extra bbq sauce if you want juicy ribs or at least an option.  Water is free, the 1/2 stack ribs are $10.79 and you get your choice of sauce, the California club w/ avocado and fries w/ a bowl of chili $8.  The gratuity  15%= 3.49 18%= 4.18 20%= 4.65 22%= 5.11  We gave him a $5 for each of us There is a Zioisk on the table which you can use to donate money, pay your tip, pay with credit or debit, and sign it for your rewards. Not to mention it also prints a receipt or emails it to you.  All in all a good time!"
Angie S.,"Mount Holly, NC",53,116,628,3.0,2/24/2016,"Paid way too much money for a Sirloin steak.  The service was excellent but the kitchen was way off of their food tonight. It took FOREVER to get our food! !!  What I originally ordered was not what it looked like in menu.  These steaks were priced like ""Texas Roadhouse "" but they were FAR from the quality.  Not happy,  not happy with this particulate location! !!!  However,  waitress was great.  That's why i rated what I did.  And for 2 people,  the kitchen screwing up we gave her $12 tip! She deserved it more than anything"
Alexis A.,"Clinton, TN",95,7,,3.0,6/14/2016,"Mango Tilapia Dinner with Mac and Cheese and Mash Potatoes  Tilapia was very good, but I was disappointed they did not have tartar sauce. How can a place serve fish and not tartar? The Mac and Cheese is okay, but spicy. Mash potatoes are awesome with the bacon in it. The Lemonade tastes like water. I usually have a good experience, maybe it was just what I had ordered. (Usually get the fish tacos)"
David P.,"Greenback, TN",0,1,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Made it into the door but that's as far as my wife and I got. First, staff were standing just outside of door smoking so we had to walk through a wall of smoke to go in. Second, stood in front of two hostess's while they were gossiping and completely ignoring us. After about a min we just left. This was a 430 in the afternoon with plenty of seats. Not even a hello. Fuck this place. If I could give them 0 stars I would."
R B.,"Knoxville, TN",0,11,,2.0,7/22/2016,"2 stars at best. Food is just ok, service is spotty. Bar service means liquid dripping down the outside of your glass - everything is sticky. This place is popular only because there aren't many family dining options in the area. Parking is a disaster."
Julie M.,"Wilde Lake Business Park, FL",36,20,3,1.0,12/19/2015,"Appetizer came out cold...and at the same time our entree, which was also cold. Complained and the managers attitude was lackadaisical, as if he  could care less. Will NEVER go back."
Jenny G.,"Rutledge, TN",44,80,33,5.0,5/23/2015,Super friendly. Food is good. They replaced there cheese sticks with cheese bites and I am so glad they did. You have to try if you haven't already.
Rochelle W.,"Knoxville, TN",57,65,21,5.0,4/13/2015,"I don't usually give 5 star reviews to chain restaurants, but we had an excellent dining experience at this location.   The food was quite good.  I had the Cajun chicken pasta from the 2 for  $20 menu.  The pasta was served hot and tasted delicious.   The service was truly excellent.  Our server was Justin, I think.  We will be back."
Lindsey H.,"Wilmington, NC",87,11,16,4.0,5/15/2014,We came here a couple weeks ago & our meal was subpar & the manager is paying for our entire meal: 2 entrees & appetizer or desserts. Awesome customer service & food was delicious tonight. This is very much a usual place I come to eat so glad the manager made things right! Also had a heat server named Rob. Very down to earth & super friendly.
Darth H.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,3,,5.0,10/10/2014,I love how they bring out 2 salsas with the chips and salsa! The past 3-4 times I have been there have been nothing but excellent! The servers are always so pleasant and helpful! Keep up the good work! :)
