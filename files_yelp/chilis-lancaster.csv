John B.,"Lebanon, PA",13,13,1,4.0,10/4/2017,Not usually a fan of chain restaurants and don't expect much. Stopped here after a horrible experience at Chuck E. Cheese and was pleasantly surprised.  Was seated promptly and a waitress came over right away. She was attentive without being annoying. Our food came out quickly and was actually really good. Everyone's order was right and the food was hot and delicious!
Robin Z.,"Lititz, PA",19,6,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"Food was ok nothing special, it took a long time to be served. It was quite obvious the food was under the hot lamps for a long time. It was super dry and over cooked. Service was super slow too."
Jamie C.,"Akron, PA",24,85,130,3.0,10/30/2017,"Pretty decent for a chain restaurant. The prices aren't bad and the have a great selection of food. Chicken, ribs, seafood, burgers, steak etc. While I was there I got the chicken fajitas. It came out sizzling. They were pretty good but for my taste I wish it would have had a little more seasoning. It came with rice, peppers, onions and all the fixings on the side. I also go the Texas cheese fries which were also good. They come with bacon, cheese, jalapenos, and onions. All in all it was a pretty decent experience."
Maria D.,"Lancaster, PA",45,465,476,2.0,7/3/2017,"Chili's is one of those places that I pass on the daily but never have a desire to go to.  On the few occasions I did stop here I always expected more and got less. I struggle every time with the menu, nothing really excites me and I don't know why.  I want to like this place.  It's close and alot of my friends go here but it just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe it's the tex-mex recipes, although they have burgers too.  I've gotten some good crispy chicken strips in a dish although it looked nothing like the menu featured picture.  But the fries are disgusting!  Old, dry, and frozen, you'd think for a chain restaurant they would at least do something, anything to try to make them better.  Maybe a sprinkle of cheese and spices, something!  But they are like eating paper.  Even dipping them in condiments doesn't save those fries.  I liked that corn on the cob came with the one dish but they smothered it in pepper making it all but inedible.   Service is hit or miss, although more miss than hit.  Wait staff is never especially friendly, but drag along and do what they need to do. Parking lot is usually empty at this location, so empty that the 3 occasions we've been here in the past few years we questioned if they were open. Overall blah food, blah experience, every times.  Been there three times now and they're out!"
Sheila L.,"Sugar Land, TX",78,45,29,1.0,10/3/2017,Chili's I want to like you because of what you were a long time ago. You get it wrong More often than getting it right. I ordered to go at 7:03. It was not available until 7:37. Is this what to go is in your restaurants? If so you have lost a to Go customer for a long time! Not to mention there was no parking and it was pouring down rain. And I tipped a nice tip in order for someone to help me out. No one came no one helped me and the food took 30 minutes.
Brittany H.,"Germantown, MD",97,153,211,4.0,2/21/2017,"I ordered dinner to go from this chilis location. I got a 6oz sirloin with veggies and the skillet mashed potatoes for sides. Just a warning for people like myself who assume mashed potatoes are just that, potatoes. They come with some sort of melted cheese and sautéed onions on them. I asked for the steak done medium well and when I got home to eat it was a bit underdone.  Overall the meal was good and the price was fair. The service however was quite slow when picking up. I was asked multiple times if I was being helped which was nice and attentive all of whom offered to find someone to assist me. The only issue being none of them themselves were actually waiting on me so that I could have my food and leave. The experience wasn't bad but next time I'd consider dining in instead."
Amber S.,"Lancaster, PA",182,128,183,2.0,12/6/2016,"Almost every time I visit this location, the service is HORRIBLE! When arriving, I was sat within 10 minutes, which was great, but from there....not so much!  We decided we were going to order the triple dipper app, along with some cheese fries, well that took at least 45 minutes to come out, which I find a little ridiculous. When it came to getting drink refills, they were not prompt either, especially the beer.  The best part, the waitress decided to add something we didn't even order onto the bill (which mistakes happen, no biggie), I mentioned to her, she moves it from one check to another, I mention it again (she comes back with her excuse), and then it is finally removed. Please double check your final bill before paying!  When it came to the food, it tasted great, good flavor and cooked well, however, the service was just too much of a downfall to matter."
Ed P.,"Lancaster, PA",8,74,13,3.0,11/12/2017,"Decided to go to Chili's for the FREE Veteran's meal.  Some places give you a menu selection for that occasion, they were no different here.  I'm thinking half a rack of ribs maybe???  NOT.  Chicken this... Chicken That..  Enchilda..  or a burger.  I opted for the burger because who goes to a Rib joint and orders Chicken Crispers, Chicken Bacon Ranch Quesadillas, Chili or Soup & Salad.  I opted for the Old-timers Burger over the Classic Bacon Burger.  Not sure why they just didn't say ""Anything under $10""  I would have been more satisfied.  In any case, when my Medium Rare burger arrived (instead of the ribs I was craving), it was more on the Medium to Medium Well side.  They were SO busy, I opted to just eat the damned thing instead of making a fuss over something that was FREE in the first place.  It had a good taste to it and I loved the ""crust"" on it.  The fries tasted double-fried which is a good thing.  All in all, a good meal.  I can always go back and get my ribs another time.  (A whole rack, not that silly half rack thing!)"
Anna R.,"Lancaster, PA",0,1,1,1.0,9/24/2017,"If I could give this Chili's less than one star, I would. First off, the service was trash. We waited 20 minutes to be seated when there were many open tables. We then waited 30+ minutes for our food which was missing fries and sauces. While our waiter was kind and apologetic, it does not excuse all the waiting....second off, I am currently SHITTING MY BRAINS OUT and earlier threw up. Food poisoning like wtf chilis? I wanted a nice night to hang with my friends and get good eats, but Chili's did not pull through."
Greg C.,"Middletown, NJ",1,176,111,4.0,8/27/2017,"Yes, it's a chain. You know what to expect. Food we had was of excellent quality, service was friendly and attentive. It was not a busy night, so we were not rushed out at all. It was actually a pleasing experience. We upgraded the 2 for $22 to the 2 for $35, which includes an appetizer, two entrees, two margaritas, and a dessert. Can't beat it. Chicken fajitas were great."
Amy M.,"Mountville, PA",42,11,4,4.0,8/18/2017,"Good service!!  Thank you Brooke!! You're always on top of things. Got seated right away, no wait.  Food was very good, portions are big but good none the less.  Had a watermelon drink, was fantastic, so I had another!!   Keep up the good food and service!"
Kat H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,5,4.0,7/22/2017,The waitress Danni is so friendly. The drinks are to die for. The place is clean and inviting.
Priscilla E.,"Hummelstown, PA",74,1,9,5.0,1/27/2017,Great Chili's!! Awesome service. Good vibes all around. Guacamole burger is so goood!!!
Kayla P.,"Quarryville, PA",0,4,,4.0,6/14/2017,Good food. Guacamole was a little bland but everything was ready when it said it would be.
Jeff K.,"Dix Hills, NY",16,22,1,4.0,7/24/2016,"Look, it's Chili's.  It's great, but it's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  This was tho, perhaps the best Chili's I've been to, and I've been to a lot of them.  Our server was excellent.  Drinks and food came quickly.  Table-side quacamole was great, and my tacos came out perfect.  Good kids meal too.   Parking seems limited - we got there early (5pm).  I could see it easily filling up on a busy night.  I don't know how well traffic would overflow into an adjoining lot."
Christopher M.,"Queen Village, Philadelphia, PA",13,6,1,4.0,6/14/2016,"The service was outstanding and the food was good.   Our waitress was the star attraction: flexible with our ordering indecisiveness, quick to point out how we could combine orders to get a combo special with app included, quick to put in appetizers, on top of drink refills for the kids, and the entrees came out quickly.  The food was what you'd expect: Apps, ribs, burgers, pasta were good; steak and broccoli a bit overdone but tasty nonetheless; and not a complaint about the molten chocolate diabetes shock thingy."
Nick L.,"Lancaster, PA",109,5,,1.0,11/28/2016,"I'm going to start by saying the restaurant was slow maybe 5 or 6 tables in the entire place taken when I was there. My wife myself and our two kids just left there and it was literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. It took 40 minutes for my wife's fajitas and my tacos to come out, once everything came out her fajitas were wrong and not how she ordered them the rice was not cooked at all and hard, my pork tacos were awful dry and burnt. Our waitress never checked on us until we were done to which I didn't even eat any of my stuff except for one taco. My wife never got her tortillas until she asked for them later on and our drinks were wrong when we ordered those as well. We spent 60$ or terrible food and awful service I don't plan on going back"
Daniel G.,"Harrisburg, PA",98,217,2670,3.0,4/3/2014,"I don't like writing reviews for chain restaurants unless I had a really good experience to share or a really terrible on to warn you about.  I've been to Chili's now maybe 3 times, and each time I went I always thought the menu was small. You see commercials all the time that make you think they really have a wide variety of food, but to me the menu doesn't seem to follow through on that promise (but maybe its just me). Still, the food has always been good and the last time I was at this particular location the service was very good.  *My only major complaint about Chili's was that the Molten Chocolate Cake didn't come with enough ice cream or milk (but that could just be because the person I was sharing with ate it all and left me with a plate of chocolate or chocolate chocolate cake)"
Stephanie P.,"Lititz, PA",0,11,,5.0,11/18/2016,"This is a great place when you want great food as a reasonable price.  The waitresses all seem to care, even if you are not their table(I witnessed this a few times).  I love the guacamole prepared at the table it is FRESH!  LOVE IT!"
Scott S.,"Leola, PA",41,14,1,2.0,8/29/2016,"Service great. Food 50 / 50. I have been to chilis over 50 times and probably at 6 different locations through the years. This was our first time at this one, and maybe the last.  The hostess was great. There were no high chairs avaliable when we arrived, but this is one of the few times a hostess remembered to bring one over when one became avaliable.  For starters we got pickle chips. The coating had fallen off most of them, probably because they were not dried before being coated. For an entree I got a burger and it was good and cooked properly. My wife got a medium steak with loaded mashed potatoes. The steak was not medium, it was very well done and Pittsburgh style on the outside. Now I like Pittsburgh style but you still need to get the inner temp correct.  I can forgive a steak being overcooked, but the potatoes were nasty. They were either old or over whipped because the glutton level was high, i.e. it was like chewing cement. My son had normal mash potatoes and his had the same quality. If you go, just stick to their basics. Burgers and fajitas"
Michael K.,"Lancaster, PA",1,85,,3.0,7/30/2016,Food and service have always been fine at this location. We have experienced really awesome service on some occasions.
Josh K.,"Alexandria, VA",5,4,,5.0,6/24/2016,"Excellent experience!  My steak was a perfect rare and all the food came quickly, so kudos to the kitchen.  Our server, Ann, was terrific!  Attentive and friendly.  Definitely would return if I weren't passing through."
Connie M.,"Lancaster, PA",0,11,,5.0,8/2/2016,"We love this place! The service is outstanding and the food is always excellent.  If that weren't enough, it is also fairly budget friendly for a family with 4 adults. We usually order from the 2 for $20 menu which includes their very popular ribs, burgers, fajitas (my favorite!), chicken, pasta and steak. The price also includes an appetizer to share. You can not beat that!"
Paul S.,"East Petersburg, PA",0,4,,5.0,1/17/2017,"I have both dairy and gluten allergies. The waiter, Chris, was very pleasant and patient with us and helped me find menu items that would not cause an allergic reaction (difficult in a place where nearly every entree includes some sort of dairy)."
Danielle D.,"Elizabethtown, PA",0,13,,3.0,6/30/2016,"I loved this chili's location. It was pretty clean, staff were ok and I love the food. The low rating is because I got food poisoning from eating there and have never gone back. Sure it could be a once and done never happen to me again but unfortunately once is enough to turn me away from a place."
Merari L.,"Brentwood, PA",3,38,67,4.0,5/10/2015,Nice parking. Not too much of a wait; considering it was a holiday (Mother's Day). Great service. Our waitress was very friendly and prompt. Hadn't been here in years and glad to have ate here on my special day
Åsa S.,"Göteborg, Sweden",0,1,,5.0,11/14/2016,Excellent service! The staff was very friendly and helpfull. Food delicious. Fresh and tasty!
Da S.,"Conshohocken, PA",14,175,7,1.0,11/25/2014,"20 minutes after we ordered our food, we got the ""your food will be right out"", which is never a good sign. After waiting 35 minutes, a summoned a manager.  The manager all but admitted the server forgot to put in our order.  To her credit, she gave us some chips to snack on, and made sure our food came out quickly. I was going to give it 3-stars, because I believe there's value in managers doing the right thing.  And our food did taste good.  It just took 45 minutes to cook. But then came the bill - the bill was a real head scratcher.   99 cents for ""table entertainment""?  What's that?  The stupid touch screen?   What a racket!   Ok, 99 cents is nothing to me, but to try to sneak that into the bill, without mentioning it is bad form. Do the right thing and have the hostest mention the cost involved with touching the little game screen!"
Carl L.,"Denver, PA",0,8,,2.0,10/6/2014,"Got there at 1:00 P.M. Seated at table by a little Mexican fellow, ordered food, went to the rest room to wash hands, got back to table and found two guys sitting where I used to be. The little Mexican fellow had cleared my table, and sat two other people. I had to move to a booth. Waitress was very nice, got the southern smokehouse burger @ $10.49. Burger wasn't very wide in diameter, not many French fries. Food was good, just not a lot of it. Won't be going back to Chili's."
Andrew S.,"Lititz, PA",17,7,,5.0,4/10/2016,This is often my choice for a nice lunch. Always friendly and quick service. Food is always well prepared and tasty. Good variety of meal options to choose from. Always a good experience here for lunch and even for dinner on busy nights. Their pricing is always in line with what you can expect. No complaints and Chillies will remain on the top of my list.
Kevin M.,"Kingston, PA",0,10,,2.0,10/7/2016,Burger ordered medium....came out rare (bleeding). The bartender seemed indifferent to the issue.  I was not at all impressed with quality of food or lack of sensitivity on the part of the staff.  I would not recommend this place!
Bill G.,"Lancaster, PA",23,6,2,1.0,11/2/2014,"I'll be as brief as possible: 1) the parking situation is a joke. The parking lot for the restaurant is big enough to fit maybe 1/2 of the restaurant on a busy night. The overflow parking is so poorly lit, and so traffic heavy that it's a hazard to walk through the lot to get to the front door.  2) the waits are endless. On a busy Saturday (I get it, it's busy), we waited 50 minutes for a table we were told would take 30. We then waited another ten minutes for our drinks and to order, after ordering it took another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. We had some chips and salsa as an appetizer but this apparently means about ten chips and the entire bottom of a bag of broken chips here, nothing but small broken pieces. Getting these swapped out took another five minutes. We're up to an hour and a half for those keeping score.  3) the food quality was poor. Out of four orders, only two were passable. Somehow chilis managed to mess up a regular cheeseburger (it was charred on the bottom and was to be cooked medium. It looked like someone left it in a pan. The definition of cheesefries here also must be congealed cheese around a mass of cold fries because that's what the second order that was messed up looked like. The manager assured us this would be made right and he'd pay for it out of his pocket (how virtuous and kind. We surely weren't going to.) Long story short, but more waiting - another 15 minutes on a burger and some fries. They came out looking mediocre but by this time no one cared enough to say anymore.  4) our server was too busy to pay attention to us. Repeatedly we had to stop her as she helped other tables, to ask for drinks, to fix our order, to refill chips, whatever. We're not high maintenance people but if you walk past us, just ask if we need anything once in a while. 5) the 10-15 dollars taken off of our bill was fine, but where's the consideration for the almost two hours of time wasted, that a party of four essentially had to eat in shifts and watch the other two eat, and for the overall lack of service? Our party member who had the burger managed to still be charged the 2.50 or whatever it is for his iced tea - how nice of you to comp his meal but charge for the drink when he waited so long to even eat. Bottom line: don't expect much here. The folks at the bar are nice but the actual dining room is lousy. Come for apps and drinks at the bar. Highly recommend you stay away for anything else, it's just not worth it. Go up the street to Lyndon Diner for a better and more friendly experience."
Terry B.,"Akron, PA",16,2,,3.0,8/28/2016,"Sat at the bar and had really good service. I ordered some of the beef chili. I took one bite and realized it was the canned variety mainly tasted like Hormel Chili. I asked the bartender if they made it on site and she said she did not know, yeah right. It was horrible, I couldn't finish and sent it back. Don't order the chili from a place with the same namesake."
Michael S.,"New York, NY",0,103,5,4.0,8/13/2016,"Good food at a good price...does get busy at times, wait times can be up to an hour or more....call ahead no bargain, difficult to get through.. parking lot way too small to accommodate diners"
Diane G.,"Lititz, PA",7,4,1,1.0,5/6/2014,"After a 40 minute wait for a table, my friend and I ordered sodas and an appetizer. The soda was flat, upon sharing this information with the waitress she said, ""the machine has been broken for 3 weeks and can't be fixed."" We ordered new drinks, not getting what we wanted.  We then ordered our dinner. We waited forever for boneless buffalo wings and a chicken fajita. When the food was brought out the boneless buffalo wings were rubbery and cold and the ""fixings"" for the fajita came out with out the chicken. By the time the chicken was delivered, we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours and I had not received anything worth waiting for.  I had the manager remove the buffalo wings from the bill and went home to make myself dinner. Never again will I be visiting this establishment. Total nightmare experience, from start to finish."
Dean J.,"Capitol Hill/Northeast, Washington, DC",57,5,,1.0,4/25/2015,This Chilis refused to serve us after a wedding. My hotel was next door. The manager was intractable. What a bunch of jerks.
Sarah K.,"Lancaster, PA",3,119,372,5.0,7/29/2015,Came in for dinner. A bit crowed but got seated in no time. Always go for the 2 for $20 deal and totally recommend signing up for their membership to get discounts and deals. There were also quite some birthdays going around and you get a freen scoop of ice cream woth a brownie. The burgers and strak are good. Ribs too. Their chicken dishes aren't very large but quite light and tasty.
Tim L.,"Ephrata, PA",4,1,,4.0,8/22/2015,"Had the smothered Chicken Burrito, the burrito was fantastic but I didn't care for the black bean concoction that it came with. All in all I was very satisfied with the meal. I definitely will go back to try the Prime Rib Burrito for sure."
Brandon M.,"Lititz, PA",9,12,2,2.0,1/4/2015,"This restaurant is a complete idiotic joke, they seem to seat by party size my money isn't good enough it seems. The hostess staff is utterly incapable of doing their job. Waitress saw us siting at our table and uttered ""ugh is that my table? Ugh 32"" then preceeded to rush us to order. Food was mediocre as expected. Overall worse Chili's in the Lancaster York Harrisburg area"
Seth M.,"Lancaster, PA",23,29,53,3.0,1/28/2013,"We've gone to many Chili's over the years because my parents loved the hamburgers. We ate here on Sunday 1/27/13 because we hadn't tried it yet. We came in with moderate expectations. Our server, Eric, was great. He was in the ball, quick and attentive. My problem is with the food.  My wife had the ribs which were decent enough, apparently correctly made if not extraordinary. My dad had the shrimp tacos which he did enjoy. My mom got the hamburger, and this is where things start to go downhill. The burger was greasy, cold and way overcooked. She's not the kind to return food but I definitely am.  I had the 6 oz. steak and boy what a hassle. I requested medium rare and was first brought a medium well. Next they brought some terrible looking piece of old steak that was cooked to medium rare but when I cut into it the manager (who by that point waited to see if it was done right) was as shocked as I was to see the color. Not a juicy red center but rather the brown of old steak. He rushed it away and brought back what was finally an OK steak. Nicely seared, perfectly medium rare and surprisingly tender.  The sides were not good. I left 90% of the mashed potatoes because they were dry, flavorless and cold and the broccoli was mushy and overcooked.  Overall I'd say 50% ok and 50% dismal. I don't think we'll be going back, though I'm sure they probably only do better."
