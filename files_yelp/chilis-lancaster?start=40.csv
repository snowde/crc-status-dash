T E.,"Yorktown, VA",0,9,,1.0,6/30/2015,"AWFUL.  I ordered online ""to go""--- showed up when the verification email told me my food would be ready----I go in 5 minutes late ---THE FOOD HAD NOT BEEN MADE.  There were two mulitpierced, wacko- colored punk hairdo waitresses....tapping on their iphones when I walked in to pick up my food.....they never even looked up or acknowleged me...but were speaking loudly enough for me to hear how much they hated the job/restaurant/dirtbag customers.  I actually waitressed my way through college and would have tipped well...even though it was take out....but they just ignored me.  The bartender (the only GOOD worker there) approached me, and I told him I was here to pick up an order.....he disappeared for 15 minutes....something tells me he was the one who actually cooked my order!!!! No one else that worked there could care less.  So, for 47$ I got awful food (I am going to upload the pic), NO napkins, no utensils to eat with....and when I tapped on the glass ( one of the two punk rock chicks stopped texting long enough to immediately lock the ""to go"" door behind me---to get napkins, etc....they (the waitresses) just looked up from their phones, then went back to texting.  I rapped loudly on the glass 3 or 4 times before someone came to open it up....probably a manager who I never saw once....(maybe I interrupted his game on solitaire on the computer in his office??)  WORST SERVICE---it is clear no one who works there really wants to be there....nor do I. Ever."
John M.,"Portage, PA",65,4,,1.0,4/1/2015,"I am rarely motivated enough to write a review but I must say the rudeness and ineptness of the hostess at this Chili's moved me to write this. I am by no means a ""pushy customer."" But after waiting 75 minutes for a quoted 25 minute wait time and seeing many who arrived after our party be seated, I decided to ask the hostess how much time we had left.  She said, ""I don't know."" I explained to her that she told us 25 minutes, 50 minutes ago.  I was told, ""I guess we were wrong"".  No apology offered, no empathy, just attitude.  When I asked how much longer, I was told ""not sure, whenever your table becomes available.""  I asked for an estimate of where we were at in the line. Again, this question was met with ""whenever your table becomes available."" After speaking with my family for a few minutes, we began to leave and our buzzer magically went off for our seating.  We should have just left when the buzzer went off but at that point, we were all tired and hungry so we took the table.  I am guessing they skipped over our name accidentally several times in the book and only noticed after my inquiry. I get it..they were busy and mistakes happen but not once did anyone express regrets for our wait time or any empathy at all. Our waitress was fine and the food was standard..but again, no acknowledgement of the any issue, problem, or of the wait itself.  Everyone has bad employees but maybe this Chili's should consider if they should be customer-facing positions."
Chris R.,"Middletown, PA",4,5,,4.0,11/1/2013,This is a newly renovated location that looks great! The service is great and the food is just as good as other Chili's anywhere.
Becky N.,"Lancaster, PA",117,4,6,3.0,10/18/2013,"Chili's changed how they make their steaks, and husband a bit disappointed. Ordered sweet potato fries in lieu of rice, got both, but not my broccoli. Service was decent."
Sara F.,"Lancaster, PA",6,12,,4.0,10/17/2012,"The lunch specials are great deals, yummy and very filling. You get a whole BOWL of soup or good size salad. then a meal of your choice. Most are 1/2 orders but they also come with fries.  Best part. Sign up for their rewards club and you get a free appetizer  or dessert or chips and dip like EVERY WEEK! via e-mail. I sometimes eat the dessert myself as a guilty pleasure, but my family loves when I come home with a surprise restaurant quality app to heat up before dinner. Mommy doesn't get the 5th degree when she works late but comes home with FREE POTATO SKINS!!! The potato soup is to die for!"
Lancaster C.,"Lancaster, PA",4,32,,2.0,9/15/2012,Ok food but not consistent.  Hostesses here seem to have bad attitudes also.  Haven't eaten here for about a year so I don't know if it's gotten better or worse?
Steve W.,"Lancaster, PA",0,14,,4.0,8/2/2012,I've been to this Chilis many times and my experiences have been excellent. The food and service is very consistent and it's clean.
cm t.,"Lancaster, PA",2,25,1,1.0,2/12/2011,"It is incredible to believe 1) that people actually review Chili's, as if there's going to be a surprise at the meal and, 2) that people review this place so highly - 4 and 5 stars...Incredible. Seriously people, explore your surroundings. I ate here with my younger sister (14). I had chicken, supposedly grilled, smothered in some kind of mexi/ranch/buffalo sauce that I swear was at Applebee's (eight years ago when I ate there last)."
Amanda L.,"Lancaster, PA",0,20,,4.0,3/8/2013,Best local restaurant! I really enjoy the food here. I got tacos and fajitas when i went here. Friendly waitresses. The only complaint was once when I ordered a margarita I swear the waitress didn't put any alcohol in it.
george a.,"Lancaster, PA",7,310,79,2.0,7/6/2007,"Good food, good atmosphere, poor service. Chilis has killer fries and offers a black bean burger as a replacement for the meat in any burger. Getting the order right is the real trick here. They always seem to mess it up for me, but the actual food makes up for it."
