Mital P.,"London, United Kingdom",85,691,396,5.0,11/23/2012,This was my favourite place in Canary Wharf until it closed down. Surprised the last reviewer hated it so much!
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,4.0,10/11/2011,This is one of the few Chili's I know of in the UK - one in Reading closed down I think. It's a shame as it's simple comfort food. Can't go wrong with that!
Whitney N.,"London, United Kingdom",32,346,369,2.0,12/31/2008,"They don't have the ""Awesome Blossom""!!!  Yes, that's right all you Americans out there... that spicy deep-fried colossal-onion appetizer that was the *only* reason you ever set foot in Chili's to begin with - they don't have it! My sources tell me it's because they can't source onions big enough here in the UK - so they dropped it from the menu altogether.  I say, ""Why'd you keep on building the place once you found that out?"" According to the server who broke this news to me, ""people"" (i.e. Americans) *regularly* walk out when they scan the menu and realize that the sinful fire-breathing heart-attack-on-a-plate that they came in for isn't available. I'm with them."
Vicky L.,"London, United Kingdom",182,300,44,3.0,5/29/2009,"So, this time it is for the American to introduce me to a slice of America in London.  Chili's it is then! I have mixed feelings about this place- probably started with it being opposite itsu, so I was like ""ooooh sushi, yum"" before we even got sat down!  So much for coveting other cuisines before eating. We shared the bottomless tortilla chips; she had a boneless crispy chicken salad and I had crispy country style chicken.  Washed it down with a margarita, on the rocks (No, you didn't hear me wrong, straight up doesn't exist in this restaurant)- which was too sweet and not clean enough for my palate. My friend destroyed her chicken salad with relish- and I must admit it looked pretty darn good.  My chicken strips were brilliant but was let down by the mediocre fries and a too dried sweet corn. The waitress was extremely attentive and nice to us, so that is a plus! Mcdonalds are doing really good ""posh"" chicken nuggets at the moment, so I think I will go there instead as it was 90% as good, the fries were 100% better and it is just about 75% cheaper... Well"
Matt J.,"London, United Kingdom",56,96,4,3.0,7/7/2009,Whoops. Unfortunately looks as if they couldn't survive; Chili's has closed since the UK holding company has gone into administration.
Melissa W.,"London, United Kingdom",26,251,265,3.0,12/4/2008,"American style restaurants are popping up all over the UK. First there was TGIFridays  and now Chili's has made an appearance. In larger US cities you may find three or four chains, but so far in London there is only one. There are locations in other UK cities such as Cambridge, Reading, Basildon, Hatfield, & Belfast. It is a great place to pop in for lunch with colleagues. The menu is a classic mixture of American entrees for the Starters there is the classic fried cheese or buffalo wings, my favourite to share is the triple play because you get a selection of chicken crispers, boneless buffalo wings,& fried cheese so there will be something on there for everyone. In the sandwich department I always order the chicken fajita pita with the sauce on the side of course, I like this so much I don't usually order anything else in fear of being disappointed. For those wanting to watch the calories there is a selection of soups and salads. There are also Fajitas, burgers, steaks, grilled or fried fish and poultry, and of course baby back ribs. The menu is a little diverse but that way everyone is bound to find something they like. They also have a larger than average vegetarian option. Don't forget the deserts, I'm allergic to all of them but they look really yummy."
