Linda T.,"Lowell, MA",59,139,428,3.0,3/21/2011,"One of the chain restaurants I always go to, but never ever enjoy. The workers are friendly and considerate when we wait for our other guests to arrive. Chips and dip are always provided to start us off - really good. The food is not even good enough to talk about. The drinks are worth it here. I usually just come here because its close by and all of our friends are always indecisive and agree upon Chili's, when I much rather go to the ninety-nines or something. I even left my scarf here once and didn't even bother going to get it; gosh, do I hate the food here that much?"
