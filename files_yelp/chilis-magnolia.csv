Kayla M.,"Magnolia, TX",0,13,,4.0,9/30/2017,It's so much better now that they made the whole restaurant non-smoking! My husband and I went on a Friday evening and were sat right away. Service was friendly and prompt. Food was typical of any Chili's...good but not exceptional.
Brad B.,"Houston, TX",17,3,,1.0,11/14/2017,Just placed an order to go and was told they would give to me at the bar. 30 min has now past so I went to the To-Go counter and there was my food waiting on the back counter for who knows how long. Horrible services.
Keith M.,"The Woodlands, TX",52,56,64,4.0,7/7/2016,"I've been coming in almost 5 years now and service has rarely if ever disappointed. The staff are all super friendly. I've seen lots of changes over the years as I'm here almost daily. (Retired/widower). There is a great group of regulars both in the morning, when I'm here most, and in the evening hours. The place is managed by CK. He really treats his guests and staff in a first class manner. So stop in and say ""Hi!"" Just ask about Keith, I'm usually at the bar and they all know me. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  So why not 5 stars... It gets a little to cold in here."
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,3.0,5/27/2016,"I have to say the food was good and service was friendly but it took FOREVER to get our dinner and the smoking from the bar permeates the dining room. Lots of great specials are offered but this will be our last visit due to the strong cigarette odor and smoke. And did I mention I had to return my steak twice?  The manager was very sweet and apologetic and so was the waitress, but I think its time to train a new chef."
Samantha G.,"The Woodlands, TX",24,25,,1.0,6/8/2017,I'm not sure if there's a new General Manager but this location has gotten bad. The servers are more interested in talking to their friends then helping the guest that are paying . Tonight we were not even given a choice to sit anywhere but the bar. The hostess was trying to give us a excuse on why . I'm the customer I can sit ANYWHERE!! I'm not coming back and I'm going to make sure to tell my friends about this location and to stay away.
Willie And Melissa E.,"Conroe, TX",160,26,5,3.0,1/18/2017,"We went to dinner with our kids and had a pretty good experience. We were seated as soon as we walked in.  I ordered a water w/lime and the waitress brought lemon instead. No big deal. She fixed it quickly.  We ordered chips and queso for our appetizer. There was plenty left over...big portion sizes and the chips and salsa are bottomless.  My son ordered the kids corn dog. About 2 minutes after he ordered the waitress came out to tell me they were out of corn dogs. She said that the manager was running to go and buy some, but in the meantime he wanted to get something else started for him so that when the rest of the food came out, he could have something until the corn dog was ready. I thought that was nice! After he ordered the burger bites, she came back 2 minutes later to let us know they did have 3 corn dogs left after all. So, he got his corn dog and was happy! I felt like they were trying to be very accommodating. My daughter ordered burger bites and she liked them. She's 7 and not a big eater, so she only ate 1/3 of the food on her plate.  My husband ordered boneless buffalo wings. It was odd b/c it looked like there were 2 different kinds of wings in his basket. One he liked and one he didn't. It was strange that 1/2 looked fresh and the other 1/2 looked old and maybe re dipped in the fryer?  I got the bacon burger and started w/a house salad instead of fries. The salad was cold, and I loved that there were cucumbers in it. The balsamic dressing was delicious. The bacon burger was cooked well and juicy. Yummy flavor. It came out w/fries even though the salad was supposed to replace it. No big deal.  The server was sweet and pretty attentive. She got busy toward the end and we didn't see her for a while, but her sweet personality made up for it.  The restaurant was clean, but the ladies room could have used some attention. The toilet seats look OLD and kinda gross and need to be replaced.  Ohhhhh....you can SMOKE in the bar at this Chili's. So gross. We requested a booth ALL the way on the other side of the restaurant to get as far away from it as possible.  I feel like we got exactly what you'd expect from a Chili's experience. It's convenient and the food is decent, so we'll definitely be back w/our family. If you're looking for a date night, skip it. Too many other choices in the area."
Robert B.,"Monroe, LA",0,10,,1.0,12/4/2016,"We've gone in twice and the smell of smoke is so overwhelming that we walked out both times. We are not picky, but it's just a very powerful smell.  The sad thing is, my 10 year old daughter LOVES Chili's. We just moved here and won't ever be able to eat at this one.  The last place we lived, we went to (smoke-free) Chili's a few times a month. They have lost our business. I don't expect every restaurant to be smoke free, but at least control the smell."
Ron V.,"Montgomery, TX",0,7,,5.0,5/29/2017,"Wife and I have always enjoyed Chili's. We like a lot of things on the menu. Hamburgers, Ribs, Salads just to name a few. One thing we hated was the bar smoking.  Went there tonight and found out they are now totally non smoking. I can now sit in the bar and enjoy a beer and watch the sports in their many tv's.  Thank you Chili's for making that change."
Josh R.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,4/3/2017,My wife and I haven't been to this location in probably five years. We tried it again and were quickly reminded why we haven't been here in such a long time. The place smells like smoke even when you're sitting in a non-smoking area. My lettuce was obviously frozen at sometime and looked more like steamed cabbage. My quesadillas were wet. The hostess and wait staff were very nice and attentive. Now I understand why this place never has a wait.
Jessica S.,"Houston, TX",192,9,,2.0,8/4/2016,I've had a lot of issues with this location with being ignored by the wait staff. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere is alright. It's a nice place to go if you have no other plans for the day.
Michael C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",252,7,2,2.0,8/25/2016,"Average food, average service, clean.  Intriguing that most restaurants (including the chick-Fil-A) next door has public WiFi but Chili's is without.  And yet... they have table kiosk to take your order and pay?! It's like someone at corporate can't can next the dots."
Dan I.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,1.0,6/15/2016,"Service could be measured with a sundial. Sunday evening - 6/12/16.    The fun begins the moment we step inside the door.  The overwhelming smoke odor from the bar area hits you.  The greeter then tells us that they've closed off part of the restaurant, so your only choice is a half-booth (even though tables were available, and we watch later groups seated there).  Fortunately, the smoking wasn't bothersome in the dining area. Our waiter introduces himself and informs us that they work in teams (seems to be the new Chili's norm) and both will be serving us.  Funny he said that, as the only time we ever saw the other guy at our table was when we begged for a spoon. How slow was the service exactly? -Both my notoriously slow eating kids had FINISHED their meals before I even got my salad. -I was thirsty coming in and received my one (and only) water refill at the 65-minute mark. -So slow that the waiter kept apologizing that they were down to one cook or thereabouts Kids meals were standard so-so quality. I had a full rack of ribs, split between two different sauces.  One was perfect, the other was super-thin and super dry.  Wife's Fajita plate seemed fairly well put together, and other than the aforementioned begging for a spoon for her rice/beans. The waiter promises he was sending a manager by our table...never happened. All in all, so-so food and glacially slow service."
Gilligan A.,"Plymouth, MA",16,5,,2.0,3/19/2016,Chilies is good. Don't go by the allegy menu. It never works. I always have a allergic reaction. And servers don't seem very helpful. Avoid chili's if you have food allergies.
Maya L.,"The Woodlands, TX",9,9,,3.0,4/30/2016,"The servers are really nice and some of the food is good, but it takes them a long time to bring the food and some of it is cold. It wasn't very clear that some dishes like the Mac and cheese have spicy peppers in them."
Lisa M.,"North Houston, Houston, TX",62,9,17,3.0,4/23/2015,"Food is ok, had to wait for 10 mins for service. When we did get a waitress, she made up for it by giving us free chips and salsa, another big bowl of chili, and green lime chili rice. They have good margaritas there. I like the mixed berry infused one."
Ryan E.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,15,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"Worst Chili's location I've ever been to. From the beginning of our visit we had a issues. 1) the server was rude, she acted as if she didn't want to take our order 2) my appetizer order only came with 12 fries(I took pictures) 3) We never received refills on our beverages 4) Server took way too long to pickup our checks. Considering all of this, they were not busy either. I reached out to the GM of this location and never heard back. Never coming back..waste of money for a poor experience."
sarah s.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,8,3.0,9/25/2016,Good food. Service is below average. Last time we went they where exceptional rude about taking a payment. They told us we had to pay on the machine at the table that we asked to be removed at the begaining of the meal. We go to be served not to serve ourself.
Tino R.,"Spring, TX",53,35,101,5.0,10/16/2014,"The manager here is awesome, great attitude, ask for Dan. The lunch menus are a good option. Classic margarita are delicious. Southwest chicken soup, best I had. Pretzel chicken sandwich, recommended, but a little over toasted. Will be a regular for lunch here, for now on."
Max C.,"Montgomery, TX",0,33,3,1.0,5/14/2016,"This has to be one of the worst Chili's out there. After more than 3 years I gave it a chance one more time expecting some changes, but is still the same mediocre chili's. The place is dirty, stinks and the service has to be the worst. Food quality below mediocre."
Georgia M.,"Conroe, TX",11,11,5,1.0,3/21/2014,"We like chili's and frequently it regularly. It's a family environment with good food and the prices are reasonable. I never take the time to send complaints but this visit needs to be brought to someones attention. Last night my family went to this Chili's location for the first time as we were in that area.  Upon arriving  we were asked if we would like a table or booth.  My husband responds ""booth"" the reply was well you will have to wait for that we do not have a clean one.  At this time the restaurant is not busy but almost every table needs to be bussed.  It's approximately 7:50 P.M.  We were seated in about 10 minutes and introduced to our waitress/waiter.  We were asked for our drink order and if we wanted any appetizers.  I told our waitress (Rebecca) yes, I wanted the chips and queso and had a coupon for this,  I showed her the coupon that included the chips and ""one Shot"" You pick your sauce. She Brings my husband and daughter their drinks but mine is still being made in the bar. About 10 more minutes go by and we are now brought chips and salsa. I told her we ordered queso. She responded they are making it now.  I still have no beverage. Finally the Margarita arrives (which was perfect) and so does the queso.  She takes our dinner order and leaves.  There is another waiter working this section who's name is Rob and I know this because he was the most annoying wait staff I have ever encountered in any food establishment.  When attempting to have polite conversation with his tables he was overly boisterous and his voice was so loud we could not even have a conversation among ourselves.  I learned so much about Rob & his family that I can tell you he has worked for Chili's for more than five years along with his wife, was put in the kitchen & hated it because it is a dungeon and loves being a waiter so he can talk to people.  All of this I heard at an octave that should be reserved for very loud parties.  This went on the entire wait for our food.  At one point I begged my husband to just pay and leave.  We continued to deal with ROB and his Loud tone while we waited for our food until 8:50 P.M.  Almost an hour, once it finally arrived I asked for silverware because none of us had been given any or napkins.  She told us be right back with it.  After waiting for over five minutes I went to the bar and asked how do I get a fork in this restaurant and was given rolled silverware by the bartender for my entire table.  several minutes after my return we were brought silverware in her had not rolled and her reason was that they were all dirty and she had to wait for them to come out of the dishwasher.  Which I believe as most of the tables in the restaurant are only being bussed on a need to basis,  We are very frustrated now and just want to leave.  We eat and prepare to pay for our check and have been charged for the appetizer that I explicitly showed her the coupon for. She tells me that was only good for chips and salsa and we ordered queso.  I showed it to her again and the fact that it included the dip of our choice.  She said but I brought you salsa.  I said I did not order salsa.  This goes on until they finally take it off the check.  We pay and leave.  We go to Chili's at least two to three time monthly and have never encountered any experience close to this.  I can promise you if it happened to us there we are not the only ones.  We will NEVER NEVER NEVER go to that location again."
Karla B.,"Spring, TX",1,20,,1.0,2/12/2015,"I wish I didn't have to give it even one star.  We sat down, ordered and then left.  As I went to visit the restroom I looked around and the entire restaurant was incredibly dirty,nasty dirty. They had just opened too! I won't even began to tell you about the restrooms! I can't imagine what is like in the kitchen! We're done with all Chili's!"
Natasha A.,"Magnolia, TX",17,38,8,2.0,7/13/2015,I used to love this place. The manager is amazing and really cares about his customers but the quality from his employees not so good. Went there a few days ago with family from out of town and all 8 sets of silverware were absolutely disgusting. All covered in water spots and dried up crusts of food. Smh. This was my favorite place to eat and now I'm avoiding it.
Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,3.0,8/15/2012,"Not really a huge fan of Chli's to begin with.... We came here with some friends for a late dinner this past weekend.  The service was adequate.  They got the job done, but didn't do it in style and didn't do much more.   The food was what is to be expected at a chain restaurant of this 'caliber'.  It was mass produced and filled your stomach, but it wasn't great nor horrid. It did take a bit for the food to come out.. Maybe they had shut the grill off already?? The drinks were priced OK - $5 for a large beer.   Better options in the area, but it'll do in a pinch."
Aaron A.,"Houston, TX",4,52,10,2.0,5/26/2015,"I think I'm being nice with two stars.  We were seated around 6:15 was surprised how slow it was in the restaurant, but now I know why... this was my third try at this location.   I guess I keep hoping it gets better.   Service is Always slow.   It took about 30 min from the time we ordered to get our food.  Our waitress was talking with the table behind us most of the time we were waiting for our food.   I don't know if she left the food or something else.   When the food came out my shrimp was cold and my ribs were the driest and toughest ribs I've ever had.  The last time we were here they gave us a free dessert because the service was slow taking our order.   I really wish this place was better,  I normally like chili's but I can't throw away any more time or money..."
Ben M.,"Nacogdoches, TX",0,9,,3.0,6/19/2015,"If it wasn't for David, I have a feeling that this would have been one of the worst Chilis experiences ever.  They seemed to be supremely understaffed and he was running around trying to help everyone else as his coworkers did God knows what. Although life happens and it took a long while to get silverware( and one set was dirty) and drinks, David was attentive, funny, and great with customers. The food was on par with most Chilis I have been too across the U.S...they were the only place open until 11. Overall, y'all have a great asset in David, my family down from CT loved him."
Sam W.,"Magnolia, TX",0,15,,3.0,8/1/2015,Been coming here for years but it's an insult when you get you bill before your drink. The manager shouldn't badger the servers or customers to do surveys if they don't want to hear the truth and not blame the employees!!
Sofia J.,"Houston, TX",11,13,5,1.0,10/27/2014,"This people don't deserve a one star. Service was awful, too crowded and they have a smoking section right at entrance. They never brought me my drink refill. Ordered steamed veggies from kids menu and they were really raw, very hard. Asked for more steaming and brought them back within less than five minutes which means they probably stuck them in microwave. This time they were still very hard but now they were dry and well they never had any flavor from the start. Waiter asked us about our meal when he brought our check, when we said we were not happy he asked my husband for his receipt and ripped off the part that you need for the survey. He literally ripped it off in our face. He was very friendly from the beginning but this act really ended any possibilities of giving this chili's our business."
Greg T.,"The Woodlands, TX",16,159,,1.0,6/5/2013,"We walked in today (6/5) for lunch and immediately out of this place. We were greeted at the door by foul cigarette smoke - never a good thing. Then we looked into the bar area. It was FILTHY to say the least.  When, oh when, will Chili's catch on to the fact people don't want to smell nor smell like an ashtray while eating...or any other time for that matter.  What a completely unappetizing experience. I thought the Chili's immediately by our house on Woodlands Parkway (Indian Springs shopping area) was the nastiest place in the area.  I was wrong. This Chili's on FM 1488 was worse. Don't get me wrong...the Chili's on Woodlands Pkwy is still a ""hole"" this one just happened to have one-upped it. That's our 2 cents. Greg T."
Cathy C.,"Magnolia, TX",4,34,1,1.0,12/12/2015,"I have been so disappointed at the quality of food and serve in Chili's for a while now. It is sad to me how bad every Chili's I have gone to in the past 3 years has declined so very much. Today, we tried it one more time. The service was slow and rude. Tables were dirty and not bussed all over the restaurant. It took the hostess over 10 min. to even greet us. We were the only ones waiting on a table and there were many tables available. The waitress got our drink order wrong. It took over 30 minutes to get our food. The waitress got our order wrong for me and my daughter. The hamburger my son ordered was cold. The onion rings were so hard you couldn't eat them. They did take this item off the check but because the food took so long he couldn't order something else because he had to get to work. No manager ever came out to apologize. We have decided this is our last time to go to Chili's ever. Your standards for your managers, servers, and hostess need to be higher. For 3 of us eating, my bill was over $50."
Melissa W.,"Magnolia, TX",5,4,,2.0,2/21/2016,"What happened!?! Prior to having our baby 7 months ago we use to go to Chili's every other week, and just went back today. It was a shock. If it wasn't for our waitress I would have rated this one star. I order the salmon and shrimp, and my husband ordered the ribeye, we both had mashed potatoes and strawberry lemonade. When our food came in, I proceeded to eat my shrimp, and upon that first bite discovered they weren't fully cooked. I was completely put off from my food from then on. My husband ordered his Steak medium rare, and it came back medium well. The waitress offered to have it taken away and a new one cooked. The new one came out completely rare, and had to be taken back and cooked longer. The waitress was extremely nice about the whole thing, and even spoke to the manager who recomped our food and gave us $20 in coupons. I really hope that their chef was in a training period or something..."
Marcia K.,"Tomball, TX",10,54,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Lousy service, inability to prepare food as requested and generally so so service.  Used to be a regular customer but never again.  Our experience was so bad this past Friday, Oct. 3rd that the manager had to comp the whole check for a party of 7.  You can do better at one of the fast food restaurants."
Karen P.,"Giddings, TX",1,22,,1.0,3/28/2014,I usually like chilis but this one stinks the smell of smoke in there turns your stomach it's not a place to enjoy a good meal with your family the service was good but the place looks dirty I will definitely not go back
Cara T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,,4.0,7/27/2012,"Our server Jessica was great, polite, and offered great suggestions on the menu. Our food was delicious and came out fast. The restaurant was clean and the servers and hosts were friendly. Recommend for a quick lunch and dinner."
Dean T.,"Spring, TX",363,68,,1.0,4/12/2012,"Went there for a late lunch on Saturday afternoon.  Sat in bar area, the place was very dirty, menu's where all sticky.  4 waitress walked pass our table, no one ever ask it they could help us.  The health dept should pay a visit to this place."
Jason H.,"Montgomery, TX",1,3,,3.0,1/20/2013,Food was good at a very reasonable price. Tilapia with mango salsa is worth going back for. Smells of smoke and stale beer was the only let down.
Diane G.,"Houston, TX",1,30,21,4.0,1/3/2010,"I must say, since they have had the promo for 2 for $20, we have been eating here quite often. Both to go & dine in. The service has improved tremendously. Good portions and great service, keeps me coming back.  Love the new dishes, keeping the menu fresh. We will definitely keep going back!"
