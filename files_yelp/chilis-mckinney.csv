Kacey R.,"McKinney, TX",113,190,264,3.0,10/19/2017,"It's Chili's... I mean, that's how I'm starting my review. You can't have super high expectations for the place, but it still gets the job done. I've been coming here for years though (not often, but every now and then). The food is always good. Last time I went, I had their chicken enchilada soup. I've had it before, and it's pretty tasty. You know the go to is Chicken Crispers and their queso which is money. Trying to be ""healthy"", I stuck with the soup on this trip. Our service was very good. We sat in the bar area, and it was pleasant. Had a little issue with the bill being incorrect, but our server got it taken care of quickly. One interesting note, we didn't have cable at the time of the past Presidential Election. We drove around trying to find a spot to watch it. Came to this location, and the bartender said they were not showing it because they didn't want there to be any trouble."
Tonia M.,"Dallas, TX",15,4,,1.0,10/4/2017,We've given this place 3 tries over the last year and have been disappointed every time.  The first visit took over an hour to get food then the food was cold. It was a random Thursday night around 5pm so the place was practically empty. No reason to wait an hour then get cold food. About 2 months ago we went for dinner with our 4 year old. They brought out her food and said ours would be put in less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later we get our food. My chicken was raw. Sent it back and just asked for a burger since I thought it might be quicker (and didn't want to chance raw chicken again). They brought me a burger ... completely raw!  Tonight I went with my 4 year old. They said they had burned her pizza and needed a few minutes  to make another. 5 minutes later they delivered a half frozen pizza and my salad with raw chicken. Just stay away ... maybe they'll close and we'll get a restaurant that knows how to properly cook food.
Tressette S.,"Frisco, TX",129,23,68,4.0,9/1/2017,"We have an awesome waiter named Bo.  This place was packed.  Although the wait was 30 minutes, no fuss here since we're hanging out on a Friday with the fam.  About to grub on various delicacies....Let's go.  Our waiter kept the drinks coming without request.  Only gripe was the place was too cold and the salsa wasn't that great."
Rebecca B.,"Washington, DC",35,164,81,2.0,11/27/2017,"Service was awful but I feel like they were extremely understaffed on this particular day. The Deep Eddy's lemonade was delicious, though it took about 20 minutes to get my drink in. I ordered the soup as not much else on the menu is gluten free. My housemate ordered a giant burger which did not come with fries until about 15 minutes after she finished her hamburger. I feel pretty bad as this place was busy and there were only two servers, but I feel as if restaurants should account for these kinds of incidents. I gave an extra star because the manager came by and apologized."
Tandy J.,"McKinney, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/1/2017,This is the worst restaurant ever i waited 20 minutes on hold to order food and they never came back to the phone. So i went in because it's on my way home and it took me standing in the to go line alone six minutes before they said someone will be right with you and took him another 3 before he took my order. As i was ordering he when in the back for at least 2 more minutes so i left and i will never return. They always have poor customer service. I'm not giving them anymore chances.
Carrie C.,"McKinney, TX",150,91,24,4.0,7/31/2017,"Chili's has good bar specials, so I definitely recommend going during those times and chilling in the bar area. I really enjoy the reorder feature on the table thing because that way, we didn't have to wait to reorder drinks."
Matt D.,"McKinney, TX",22,8,,2.0,5/13/2017,"We've had issues before at this location, and they continue to have horrible service and mediocre food. If you're a fan of Chili's, just go to the frisco one. Don't waste your time here. We had to ask for everything at least twice if not three times from our server, and most of our food was cooked poorly or cold.  Drink refills were non-existent unless we harass the server. Luckily it's only this location, the other location in Frisco and other Chili's in the area have always been consistent and good service."
Shelly K.,"McKinney, TX",38,4,,2.0,12/4/2017,"It took forever for the front person to even show up to take our name. He was walking so slow that I saw 3 other groups walk out in frustration. On a Monday night, they had ""run out"" of chips. They were then ""having problems with the fried foods"" which resulted in us not getting the fried pickles that we ordered in lieu of the chips and queso. When our burgers arrived, the fries were missing. When they were finally done, they were nice, hot, and crispy.  While our waiter was friendly and apologetic, the rest of the experience was definitely subpar."
Christine H.,"McKinney, TX",1,35,,1.0,8/20/2017,Dear Chilis you are going downhill. Chilis use to be a favorite of ours. Not anymore!! We thought we would give it a try again and ordered take out. What a complete disappointment. My husband ordered chili and it was liquidy and had a film of oil on top. We both ordered salads and asked for extra dressing and grilled chicken. The chicken on my salad wasn't edible it was chewy and tasted very strange. They have us 2 small containers of dressings both half filled. Overall bad meal and wouldn't recommend this Chilis ever!!!
Chris W.,"McKinney, TX",2664,646,963,4.0,11/15/2015,"We came in on a busy Saturday evening.  They were on a wait, but the bar area is self seating, so we found a table in there.  We first started with the queso because,  I am addicted.  I need an intervention.  I think they may put crack in to to make you keep coming back.  I can't go in without eating it.  Did I mention I love the queso? I don't know how they do it, but is is literally chili meat with cheese dip.  It comes in a cute cast iron skillet that is convenient for me to lick clean.    Ok, onto the food.  I ordered the soup and salad.  I know boring, but I did just eat the queso so I have to eat a healthy dinner.  The chicken enchilada soup is AWESOME!  I get it without pico, so just be warned it doesn't say it on the menu, but they put pico de gallo on top.  I like the house salad with ranch dressing.  The ranch tastes homemade.   The waitress was friendly. Please note they have a very convenient togo area.  You just pull up to a stand and they come out to your car.  You know for those queso emergencies and you are craving it and you need it right now, but you don't want to go inside."
Antony M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",77,118,9,1.0,11/5/2016,"I walked in at approximately 10:40 pm on Saturday night. Frankly, the condition of the restaurant was disgusting. The bar had trash and dishes everywhere as did the dining area.  I asked to speak to the manager, and while apologetic she said she had only just started her shift and seemed rather exasperated.  I haven't been to a Chili's in a long time, but tonight I elected to give them another chance. Tonight this restaurant reminded me why I should continue going elsewhere.  Note to Chili's: I don't want anything for free. I'm merely trying to warn other folks that there's no reason to come here with so many other options in the area."
D A.,"Plano, TX",0,18,12,1.0,6/25/2017,"Food was slow and when it finally got to me, the burger looked like it had been dropped on the floor and haphazardly piled back on the tray. Had almost no taste to it and the vegetables looked old and wilted. The fries were served in a paper sleeve and set in to a metal basket to disguise how few there were. They also had no seasoning and very little flavor.  If they had sent someone to Whataburger and gotten my burger there and brought it back, it would have been faster, better quality, and they would have made three dollars profit on the price difference."
Tori T.,"McKinney, TX",122,1,,1.0,6/23/2017,"The food here has no flavor, and I am highly disappointed. It used to be so nice and I felt more welcome. Now, I am left feeling unsanitary and disgusted. The waitress was very nice, but she did not look clean enough to be waitressing. I feel terrible, because I used to come here all the time. The restaurant feels dirty and the food was bland. Definitely try a different restaurant or location."
Angie B.,"Farmersville, TX",43,60,19,1.0,9/2/2016,Came here a couple of weeks ago and they had multiple tables open and made us wait for 30 minutes before they could seat us. Upon being seated our waiter didn't come to our table for 15 minutes. But when she finally got her she was pretty good. The whole restaurant seemed unorganized.
John S.,"McKinney, TX",29,5,,1.0,3/30/2017,We received salad that was black.  Then they brought us more black salad.   We were never offered anything else. The manager was a joke. He could have cared less.   Find somewhere else to eat this place is poorly ran.
Misty T.,"McKinney, TX",40,1,,1.0,6/23/2017,"One word...nasty! It used to be soo good, clean and always a nice crowd of people.  Now it's dirty, service is awful and food is not near the quality as before.  Not sure what happened."
Scott F.,"McKinney, TX",0,14,,1.0,6/8/2017,Still standing in line waiting to be shown a table.4 waitresses pass right by and say nothing.ok I get the hint. We will go elsewhere.oh that's right I get to spend my money anywhere I want and I guess your business is doing so great that you don't need my business   Never received a response which goes to show they could care less about what people think about them. Says a lot about their management
Christopher L.,"Princeton, TX",2300,644,44,3.0,6/12/2016,"Very typical Chili's experience, which is what I expected.  Service was quick, attentive and polite.  Food was a bit overspiced, but that is also part of what makes Chili's."
Love H.,"McKinney, TX",0,17,,1.0,9/5/2017,"Don't know what the rave is about this place, I been here 3 times and left disappointed all 3 visits..the food isn't very great... Mostly everything is poorly seasoned and tastes fake.."
Bonnie L.,"Mexia, TX",31,16,1,5.0,4/9/2017,"Great friendly service.  Food was amazing tonight, we had the honey Chipotle chicken crispers and waffles.  OMG, yum! The Mexican street corn is out of this world! Staff was friendly and backed each other up since they were so busy."
Ardra M.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,I have been here several times and there's many tables available yet they won't seat us.  They say it will be a 15 min. wait.  Not good customer service at all.
Stacey R.,"Allen, TX",49,8,4,1.0,1/12/2017,"Cockroaches!!!Service was slow, brought wrong soup, food was cold, very dirty,then from corner of my eye behind my friends head on ledge was a baby cockroach!!! I should have thrown up! Never again!"
Brian T.,"Melissa, TX",0,5,,5.0,6/23/2017,"Very friendly atmosphere, servers go out of their to help you. Strong team concept creating a great atmosphere. Burgers here are great. Most Chili's I have eaten at the burgers are very dry. These are nice and juicy full of flavor. To date I haven't had a bad meal."
Tara M.,"San Francisco, CA",51,2,,1.0,5/12/2017,"We had a table of 5 and our server seemed overwhelmed with this. He got our food orders and when they came and dropped our food off they didnt have a plate. We looked over to where our server was and you could see it in his face that he had forgotten to in put that order. We waited another 20 minutes for that plate to get to our table and by then everyone else had already finished eating. He only came by once to apologoze. Didn't even offer to take the meal off the ticket or offer anything else because it was his fault that he had forgotten to put the order in. He also didn't ask how we wanted the tab split. He just assumed and we spent another 20 mins just waiting on that to happen. We didn't even have complicated orders. We had 2 burgers, Cajun pasta, and chicken fingers. He wasn't sympathetic about any of this. Mind you I used to be a server and if this was me I would've paid for the food that was forgotten and gave them a dessert for free out of my own tips. But that's just me."
Katie Z.,"McKinney, TX",325,4,1,5.0,9/23/2016,Wow. The service here has done a complete 180. There was a wait (it's Friday night) and while we were waiting for our table the waiter came around and asked everyone if they needed a drink. We were across from the bartender and he was so attentive and polite to all his customers. The wait was supposed to be 30 min and we maybe waited 15 before a waiter came and sat us. We just sat down and our service so far has been phenomenal and we haven't even got our food yet.
Zachary T.,"McKinney, TX",2,3,,1.0,5/20/2016,"My fiancée called to resolve an issue we had, the manager, Danny, said ""yeah whatever"" and hung up mid sentence. I called back, he insisted she had hung up on him, despite the fact I was right there and the call log said the call had been ended on the other side. I asked to speak to his regional manager, and he hung up on me. Unbelievably rude, they just lost about $200 a month in business, we come several times a month and always buy lots of food and drinks. This was unacceptable in every way. Disgusting."
Travis ..,"McKinney, TX",1,20,11,1.0,7/21/2015,"Don't even bother coming here! Apparently if you order online or call to order something off of the chili's menu, THEY DON'T HAVE IT.   Called to order a BLT, their response was we don't have it let me ask a manager... Oh sorry we can't make that.  I feel bad for this chili's because the people running this specific one are running it Into the ground."
Phoebe D.,"McKinney, TX",30,4,,5.0,7/26/2016,"Go here all the time and I love it. The food is always soo good and everyone is so friendly! The bathrooms are like always clean and that's huge, I can't eat at places that don't have clean bathrooms."
Avery H.,"Plano, TX",59,3,,2.0,4/24/2016,"So. Slow. Maybe 30 minutes or more to just get the drinks out of the way. The food is pretty good, but the menus and the tables are always dirty. More of a low class Applebee's."
Paul A.,"McKinney, TX",10,18,8,4.0,3/1/2015,Very slow. ..arrived and it was plenty of open tables but we sat waiting for 15 minutes...then they forgot about us. However..the food was good and the waitress did great.
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,4.0,7/14/2011,"Normal Chili's food, but they do have a really friendly staff. The coolest thing about this Chili's is that they have a Sonic like drive-up for to go food. You just press a button and either tell them your name to pick up food, or to order to go, and then they bring it out to you! I adore curb side service for restaurants to go, and I hope this is something other Chili's in DFW will start doing!"
Lance M.,"McKinney, TX",2,23,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"Don't even bother if you're in a hurry, service is so slow! We waited and waited and finally walked out."
Susan R.,"McKinney, TX",60,47,11,1.0,4/3/2016,So. Freaking. Slow. I think I have never had slower service anywhere.  SUNDAY night we arrived at 6:30 and now at 8:07 we finally have a bill. Zzzzzzzz
Amber G.,"Arlington, TX",20,1,,1.0,7/2/2015,"I'm not one to write negative reviews or reviews at all. But this has to be said. I don't even want to give 1 star. Everything at this Chili's is going downhill for months now. We have given this Chili's three tries, three too many. The other night was the last straw. Horrible service all around... Won't be going to Chili's for a very long time, if ever."
Heather D.,"Anna, TX",0,9,7,1.0,3/24/2014,"The last few times we have been here the service has been less than satisfactory all-around. We have been twice in the past month and at least one of our food orders was wrong each time. We asked for extra ranch or cheese when the meal was served, but it was never brought to us. I feel that the wait staff may be waiting too many tables at once. On our most recent dine-in, our waitress was at our table maybe five times the entire night. She seemed to appear when the manager was waiting on us or someone else was bringing out our food and drink refills. It took so long for someone to bring us our food it was cold! When she picked up our plates, after we were done eating, we sat at our table for fifteen minutes waiting for her to come back. She never asked us if we were ready for the check or wanted dessert when she cleared our table. I'm not sure if she was new, but these days it seems like everyone is at the location!"
Jennifer J.,"Frisco, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2016,"If I could give less than one star I would. I placed an online order at 6:15 today and received a confirmation that it would be ready by 6:41. At 7:15 I was finally asked if I had been helped and was told that I would have to present my email confirmation because she didn't have my order. At around 7:30 she finally came back out and asked what she could help me with and I showed her my confirmation. She stated, ""you paid online so I have no record of your order."" It had been sitting on a shelf likely since I had been there and she had never even checked for my name. Further, neither of the items were correct and the steak that comes with asparagus (which is why I select the pricier steak) was missing that and the sauce. I will acknowledge they were busy and the young lady was super overwhelmed but this was a situation that could easily be better with some training in customer service and triage as well as management."
Elonda O.,"Whitewright, TX",0,9,,1.0,1/3/2016,Waited 15 mins for 2 top when there were tons of tables open! Sections were very dirty ...trash and food all over the floors...the menus and touch screen was disgusting!!  Server was stone cold no personality and poor service. Food was ok. So disappointed in my store that I worked as a Chilihead for almost 10 years!! I was ashamed to say I had worked here in the past. Please do something about the decline of this store so I can bring my husband back!...He said he would never return!
Travis S.,"McKinney, TX",6,7,,2.0,5/17/2015,I am very disappointed that Chili's no longer carries the cinnamon apples. I guess it's just time to MoveOn.  :-(
Johnny S.,"McKinney, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2015,Do not eat this restaurant. I love Chili's but this location as recently declined in service. The last 3 times I have had call in orders it's been wrong. The food quality as also declined. Not sure if it's a new manager or the chain itself. But I welcome someone contacting me from corporate to discuss. I am done with this chain.
Amanda J.,"McKinney, TX",1,3,,1.0,9/27/2014,Visit 9/26/14. Family of 4 walked in around 8 pm on a Friday night thankful there was room as all the other restaurants in McKinney had a long wait. We were seated promptly but then didn't get noticed by our waiter for about 10 min. The service was pretty bad throughout dinner. Ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and got the standard wattery chilis salsa and cold chips. Two kids ordered kids cheeseburgers and fries which they said was good. Two adults ordered two different burgers and fries which were both tasty as well. I actually substituted a beef patty for a turkey patty which was nice. The bartender is on point with the long island ice teas. We still give them one star due to lack of menu knowledge and poor poor server/customer service skills.
