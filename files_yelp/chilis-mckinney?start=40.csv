Michael A.,"Celina, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"This is the third time I have eaten at Chilli's in McKinney Texas. It took almost an hour for my wife to get her food and another twenty to get mine. The restaurant is dirty, wait staff is below average and no one really understands that in a consumer driven business, clients vote with their feet. Don't invest your hard money for a meal at Chilli's"
Ms M.,"Fort Bragg, NC",54,117,19,2.0,1/1/2013,"For some reason, I remember Chili's being good in the 90's. Either I was too young to know good food, or they have gone down hill.  This location depresses me. It needs to be remodeled. I kept expecting the 90's cast from Friend's to pop out and sing ""I'll be there for you."" I don't think it has been remodeled since before Ross and Rachel got together. The food hasn't upgraded itself either from the 90's. The chicken fingers are mostly fried breading. The fries are covered in so much salt, you may need to chug a lot of those mugs of water. The staff is young, maybe too young to be waiting on tables, as they seem spacey. I did get a good burger one time. I picked it up, and saved myself from eating inside. That was a good burger! There is a Raising Cane's chicken fingers going in right in front of this location. This is the most exciting food news to happen on that entire street corner."
Thomas A.,"Dallas, TX",16,29,,1.0,8/15/2011,"If I ever have to go to Chili's, I make sure to lower my standards as much as possible (not that I have high standards to begin with--see my review of Taco Bell). Today's lunch was so much worse than expected that our group was laughing by the end of it. (As a rule, I never complain to a waiter about my experience. If you're stupid enough to eat at Chili's, the joke's on you.) Since the movie Memento came out 9 years ago today (not true), I'm going to write this thing in reverse chronological order. The lunch special I got was $11 before tip. Toss a couple bucks on top and you might as well be at Rick's Chophouse. The food was less good than your average Chili's food, which is really saying something. The food took fivever (like forever but even longer) to show up. We were in and out in just under an hour and a half. This is the worst part: there's a beeping noise that plays a high E at 200 dB in three-second intervals. It went on so long I was able to investigate and find the source of the problem. They started a Sonic-style drive-up at this place. When someone gets to the special parking spots he presses a button to signal the person inside that he wants to place an order from his car. That button-press sets off the aforementioned beeping, and it doesn't stop until someone answers it. The problem is that no one ever answers the beeping, and everyone is looking around like ""hey, where's the dang button guy?"" We're talking 10 minutes straight of beeping noises; it was like watching George Carlin edited for television. Maybe it was the button guy's day off. The iced tea tastes like Lake Lavon with a twist of lemon, but I did get plenty of refills."
Liana K.,"McKinney, TX",172,201,2,2.0,3/18/2014,"It is just ok......nothing special.  I would much rather eat somewhere else.  Their food is extremely unhealthy and super greasy.  I used to like Chili's queso but the two times I have ordered at the location, it came out cold.  The place doesn't seemed to be managed well either.  I've seen the same manager there just stand around or wander past us when our drinks are empty and not even offer to fill them.  I used to be a restaurant manager and you are supposed to have an eye for these type of things to make sure the customers are happy.  I don't plan on going here again....."
Karen G.,"McKinney, TX",2,6,15,4.0,10/27/2013,"Tried & true Skillet queso with chips.  My son  tried 5 cheese pizza and added the taco seasoned beef.  Daughter had a big chicken sandwich with Avocado & bacon on a pretzel bun with fries. Lots of food on our table. Weather was nasty so we stayed extra long. The server was very helpful and got our order perfect!  The touchpad game thingy on the table was FUN!  We played games, looked at menu and even swiped to pay and tip on it!"
Vedanta B.,"Mukilteo, WA",15,177,43,5.0,7/29/2014,"i found this to be one of the nicer Chilis, the food was good and tasted awesome. service was friendly, and less crowded."
Rachel I.,"Burlington, WI",7,45,1,2.0,2/6/2012,"I hate coming to this location. We have been here a handful of times (since July till now) and if it wasn't for it being dinner time (= traffic), we would go to the Allen location. All but the last time, the place was dirty and the servers sucked. Each time I told my husband I didn't want to come back and so we finally tried Applebees which is next door to Chili's. MUCH better experience there. We only went back to Chili's this last time because I was given a gift card. The last experience was actually pretty good. The server, Erica, was great and the manager walking around (a blonde older woman, cannot remember her name) was very nice. We got the Chicken Crispers original and the chicken was very spongy and gross. The manager brought us the crispy Crispers and they were much better. Erica offered to take one of our meals off the bill, but we were not telling her they sucked for that reason. I had eaten almost all of it until I couldn't take another bite for fear of throwing it back up due to how gross it was. I only told her my complaint as I thought it might be the brand of chicken (I've had spongy chicken with certain brands)... Apparently it's just how it's cooked when it's the Original. My husband only ate one or two of the Original ones but did eat up the Crispy ones.   In the end, despite another ""bad"" experience at this location, Erica and the manager saved it. We normally do not get that meal at Chili's, so I'm not going to hold it against them. Since we had a much better experience w/ the staff that day, perhaps we'll be back instead of going to Applebee's."
