Karen L.,"Midlothian, VA",50,55,184,3.0,8/6/2017,"This was our first time going to a Chili's. We decided to give it a try since it was close to our home. They had a great deal for 2 dinners and an appetizer.   We opted for the guacamole, salsa and chips. The guacamole was delicious, the salsa zesty. The chips were light and crisp except for a glob of chips that had not be separated and stuck together.   My husband had the chicken quesadilla with black beans and rice. He said the beans were great. His quesadilla looked good with sour cream, pico de gallo, and southwest sauce. He really enjoyed it.  I had the steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The steak and potatoes were very good. The corn on the cob was so tender it melted off the cob in your mouth. The only thing I didn't care for was too much salt in the butter sauce for the corn. I couldn't eat the part that had been sitting in it.   Our server, Megan, was great. She was very attentive and made excellent suggestions for drinks. I tried their signature vodka and rum drink very good."
Ashley B.,"Midlothian, VA",0,12,22,3.0,1/5/2018,"Just your typical Chili's, fast service.  Service ok, food is what you would expect from the chain.  Restaurant is clean."
Miranda K.,"Midlothian, VA",10,36,27,5.0,9/1/2017,"I went here today with my husband and daughter and we were seated pretty quickly. I ordered a nice big pint of Yuengling and they had water. The drinks came very quickly. We ordered our food and waited less than 20 mins. I ordered a Salmon dish and it was devine!! The fish was cooked perfectly, the rice was beautifully herbed and even the broccoli was amazing! I ate every single scrap which is rare for me. My daughter ordered a bacon burger and loved every bit of it including the fries. My husband ordered a jalapeno sausage dish and he devoured that. Afterward they decided to order the Oreo lava cake for dessert. I decided to have a try and wow. I party in my mouth, it was delicious!!! I had to have more! Our waiter was polite, friendly yet professional and the place was clean, modern and not too loud. We will definitely be going back!!"
Dennis H.,"Midlothian, VA",2,27,,4.0,3/28/2017,"Excellent menu with a nice variety.  Service was great. Food was delicious.  It had been a long time since I had been here.  Even then, I loved it.  I don't know what more to say than ""go"".  It is the best of the medium chains.  There downfall, they do not advertise enough. I would have been back sooner.  I am not a fan of thier fries and ribs (even though it falls off the bone), but there are so many great tasting things on the menu.  Branch out and try something you normally wouldn't, then you will fall in love."
2shay A.,"Richmond, VA",47,2,3,4.0,6/1/2017,The food was delicious and the service was great.. shout out to the waiter JAY! Will be returning soon love the ribs and the different types of platters the drinks was great.
Gregory M.,"Richmond, VA",0,2,,1.0,8/2/2017,Stopped by after work. Sat at the bar. After 7 minutes (doesn't sound long) and no one behind the bar working went to O'Charleys instead.
Charlotte S.,"Chester, VA",34,191,110,4.0,6/27/2015,"Nicely done Chilis. The renovations, facelift and modifications to the menu were long overdue and well received. The Fresh Mex bowl was great!  Even with the self service tablets at each table, our server Shelby was more than attentive and pleasant."
Dan H.,"Midlothian, VA",15,23,,2.0,8/9/2016,"Although I have been to this Chili's at least three times in the past few months, this was the first visit that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. I am 70 years old and have grayish-white hair making me tend to blend in with the surroundings. I have become almost chameleon-like in my older age. Now, I'm not claiming ageism, but I can't help but believe that if I were a more aggressive, younger, more self-assertive man that I would have been noticed more quickly. I was seated fairly quickly but then I guess my chameleon powers kicked in and I became invisible. I waited for a long time to be noticed by a waitperson who asked if I was ready to order. I hadn't even been offered water or a drink, but I took advantage of the opportunity lest I not get another. I got adventurous in my dinner choice and ordered a ""smothered carnitas burrito"". Well, I'm sure they had to travel to Mexico, find the pigs, shoot them, bring them back to Virginia and prepare my meal because it took forever to arrive. Actually, I had to complain twice before it got there. Another customer near by said he would have walked out long before it got there. It was fine except it had green chili and I just couldn't get into it. I could not get the automated cashier on my table to work so I had to wait for the waiter to finally come within hailing distance to get his attention. The manager finally came and gave me my meal for 50% off. Not enough to make me eager to come back any time soon. So, if you are an elderly male (maybe female too) be wary of dining out alone, especially at this restaurant. Oh, they were nice when I could get their attention, but getting that attention took way too much effort."
Shannon F.,"MANAKIN SABOT, VA",0,27,,5.0,5/29/2017,"Yummy! Almost did not come in due to low rating. Took a chance and found everything to be perfect for a chain restaurant. Ordered cheese fries with japs and onions on side and white queso, chips and salsa. All served as ordered and the nice surprise was the queso was sizzling from the broiler - delicious.  Burgers and salads served promptly and were cooked as ordered.  Server was Sarah - very friendly and checked in us several times. Will come back when in the area."
Austin H.,"Midlothian, VA",12,5,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Came in with my husband on a date sat down, the host said our server will be right with us 5 minutes past a server came by and said our server would be right with us 10mins came by a server looked at us as she was walking by and didn't say anything. Did you not serve my husband and I because were gay... not cool will never go to Chili's again..."
Milhen E.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,157,26,3.0,5/5/2016,Not much to say ... Nice to stop at an old place. Nothing extraordinary. Same food. Same service. Same place.  Good for a quick lunch.
Jennifer C.,"Charlotte, NC",80,24,97,4.0,5/13/2015,"Came to chilis looking for some different meals than I usually get at my regular restaurants! They have expanded their menu quite a bit and has a ton of Mexican meals now! Seems to be moving away from things like ribs and burgers!  We were seated right away so for a Friday night that was a great surprise! Our server was prompt and nice so that was great too! Now getting to the meal. I ordered the explosion quesidilla salad and it was pretty good! It was a large portion size so I don't finish it all, but I liked the added quesidilla on the side!  At the end of meal I was highly surprised to see that you just pay at your table! No waiting for the waitress or maybe forgetting your card!"
Benita D.,"Richmond, VA",4,16,7,3.0,8/11/2016,"I went to dinner with friends last night, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive with our drinks. We ordered off the 2 for 22 menu, which included one app to share and 2 full size entrées. I got the half rack of ribs with skillet potatoes and my friend got the 6 oz. sirloin with broccoli and skillet potatoes. The potatoes were so yummy, cheesy and delicious. Our only complaint is the apps and the mains came out within 5 min. Our waiter apologized, but our entrees were luke warm when we ate them."
Stephen M.,"Henrico, VA",2,12,,2.0,10/20/2016,"Ambiance fine. Extensive menu with beautiful photos, leaves me with no idea who their market might be, super unhealthy items with option to have free range eggs, what gives? . Got the Guacamole Burger, unlike the picture arrived with a smear of green slime, obviously a kitchen with no interest in presentation. Waiter perceived of himself as super cool. Bottom line: The food does not differentiate its-self from any of the other restaurant of its type. If it's the only thing around go in and have a meal which is non-toxic but certainly no gastronomic epiphany. It needs to change or it will be gone soon."
Dave C.,"Richmond, VA",1,6,,1.0,4/15/2015,"Location has gone down hill! Wait staff absolutely is awful and all need to find new jobs, including the manager. I ordered a steak rare while my wife ordered a turkey burger, no onion no tomato and no cheese, all she wanted was lettuce. What we got was a medium steak without the garlic butter as per the description. When I asked about the butter the waitress said she didn't think they did that anymore...this was written in their new menu description, she never checked. Also the turkey burger came out with onion, tomato and cheese, NO LETTUCE the one thing she wanted! This is something the waitress should have checked before she brought out the order.  When my wife said something about it the waitress just came back and said the manager said she was sorry. WTF for an order that was messed up as much as this was and the manager can't even come out and talk to the customer personally?  Not to mention that with only 4 other tables this travesty took over 20 minutes."
Gromel B.,"Richmond, VA",2,45,32,2.0,9/18/2015,Our waiter was fantastic he checked order to make sure he got it right but the cook staff is unable to read instead of getting fish we got chicken I think there's a big difference I hope management correct this problem
Michael D.,"Midlothian, VA",0,4,,1.0,3/11/2016,"Sat at the bar for 10 minutes. The bartender went back & forth to the kitchen. Her friends came in & she took their order. They joked & chatted. I yelled & asked for a beer , she told me wait until she was done. Awful customer service,  will never go back."
steve g.,"Bristow, VA",1,172,11,1.0,4/24/2013,"I tried to come here last weekend with my daughters softball team, there were about 20 of us all together.  Unfortunately they refused to accommodate, first we were met with ""its going to be a 45 minute wait for a table"", so we offered to split up the group, then it was ""our kitchen is backed up and it's going to be a 45 minute wait for food"". We kept offering ideas on where to seat us, the hostess kept going back and forth to the manager, eventually the manager came out and told us that they couldn't serve us because it would be too much trouble. Yep. The place was barely half full, no idea why they would want to turn away business. We all ended up walking over to the Chick Fil A and they were absolutely delighted to have us there."
Lou B.,"Chattanooga, TN",17,16,3,3.0,9/9/2014,Came in for lunch. I'm new to this area and thought I would check out how a franchised Chili's runs. I gotta say the bartender Brittany was on point. She was fast but had a great personality. She was on the Saint Jude donation drive with every guest. Hats off to Chili's for their Saint Jude work. My shrimp tacos were great and my octoberfest was cold. I'll be back.
K F.,"Broadlands, VA",0,45,,1.0,8/17/2014,"This location is terrible. The good thing about going to Chili's is that you know exactly what you are going to get, right?  Nope!  The steak ordered medium came out way past well done. The ribs were dried out so bad I was afraid to try to eat them. The mashed potato had hard pieces in it; looked like plastic but I honestly was not sure. Service was incredibly slow. We go to Chili's a lot in many locations and this one is the worst I have been to. We are from out of town but we are in the area a lot, but won't be back to this Chili's."
Lacey D.,"Chesterfield, VA",1,13,4,4.0,9/15/2015,"I've been going here since they opened and haven't had a bad meal. Especially take out. I just want to thank the chefs and take out employees for being awesome at letting a girl get her Cajun chicken pasta on. They get it right every time. Only complaint is that they get rid of a lot of good stuff. :( Like the chocolate mousse desert, that was so good. They do have AWESOME chips though, they're my fav and they come in a huge bag. Love this place."
Jen N.,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",4,12,1,2.0,6/1/2012,"Service is horrible! We ended up here in a pinch twice in 2 weeks after errands. The food seems as good as our last trip 2 years ago but the service is suffering. Forgetful or delayed--waited a long time in one visit and had poor, rude service the other. Food ok."
Gln B.,"Chesterfield, VA",0,2,10,1.0,11/1/2013,"Ordered food tonight using car side to go. We had to wait additional 20 minutes after the scheduled pickup time because mashed potatoes weren't ready. For their part they gave 10 chili bucks. Once we got home, we discovered that one of the meals was missing, Salmon meal for $15.29. Talked to manager and he couldn't credit the money back, so he's sending additional chili bucks. I think the corporation need to realize that after multiple missteps, we'd be hard pressed to go and use those chili bucks. Good job chili's, you made the not-to-go-to list. Guess sleep hungry tonight."
Ana S.,"Richmond, VA",0,7,,5.0,10/28/2015,"I see the same faces every time i come here, but i like those faces. Prices are reasonable and the food is consistently good. I live right down the road so i come here at least once a week. Staff is very friendly. I was surprised to go in last Sunday during football and realize they get all the games. Amazing, i can't believe they have the package and beer specials during the games. My new football spot."
Steph B.,"Midlothian, VA",69,34,47,2.0,11/23/2013,"My first Chili's experience in 8 years was a week ago for lunch at another location,  it was fine.  I took the teens for dinner at this location and there was nothing spectacular about the food or the service.  I tipped 17% where I usually start at 20 and go up or down depending.  While the food wasn't memorable,  the bartender was.   The last 7 minutes of my visit was filled with her moaning and complaining about a customer that asked for a meal, how he asked for the triple dipper all wings, how he must be on drugs, etc.  While she knew the customers at her bar (one was a former or current employee) she obviously didn't care about paying customers hearing her conversation.  My only thought was ""what would she say about me or other customers?""  Well there goes, unremarkable chain food,  mediocre service and utter failure at the 101 of restaurant to customer etiquette."
Conner S.,"Richmond, VA",0,5,,3.0,9/13/2014,"It's what you expect from a chain restaurant. Just eh. Waitress was alright, not a real personality. Had a coupon for free chips and queso which frito-lay could make much better than chilis. The mango tea was to die for, as well as the loaded mashed potatoes which were exceptional. I got the Monterey chicken which was also eh, probably one of the better things on the menu. Chilis' focus on their technology distracts from the food and service."
B B.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,115,36,3.0,8/16/2013,New flatbread pizza and margaritas watching NE & TB.  Good service tonight  good people.   Flatbread Pizza good margaritas awesome and priced right.  Service a little slow from the Kitchen quality good.  Enjoyable evening we will come back.
Dan N.,"Glen Allen, VA",1,22,13,3.0,3/27/2014,"2 for 20.  After appetizer was delivered never saw waiter again.  Out of water and ranch dip. Finally asked bus person to get waiter. Asked for 2 ranch dips, he bought 1.  After food was delivered the waiter did pay us better attention.  Food was served hot.  However, onion strings were extremely greasy tonight."
Carol N.,"Midlothian, VA",1,7,,4.0,10/25/2014,"Love the new decor, love the new menu. Definetly try the new burgers, the garlic pickles are wonderful! Also, tip: the spicy sauce for the burgers is great as a dipping sauce for fries! We will be back!"
Deb S.,"Midlothian, VA",5,8,2,4.0,12/12/2012,Great service today (12/12/12) in the dining room for lunch. Server was by himself and on the ball!
