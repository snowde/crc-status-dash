Jennifer A.,"Nanuet, NY",86,38,44,5.0,11/28/2017,Try the app deals buy the bar.  Sunday all day for game day...  be careful of the 1.99 game that will get you're bill high...  Changed the menu a little bit...  some stuff not on the menu before.  Try it
Elle N.,"Suffern, NY",0,7,9,3.0,6/29/2017,"Review your bill carefully!!  Came here on a weekday afternoon with 3 children. As soon as we got there, there was no hostess and took about 10 minutes before someone sat as down. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. Food is mediocre. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants since most of the food is frozen, fried and just downright unhealthy. Anyways when the bill came, I couldn't help but notice that there was a ""table entertainment"" charge for $1.99! What the heck! Then I realized it's for the tablets that they have on the tables! It would have been nice if I was notified that there would be a charge for using it! Sneaky move!"
Guido F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,83,5.0,4/9/2017,Great service from our server Skye and Dan the manager had a great attitude. I had the Mango-Chile Chicken and it was Amazing and flavorful. I ordered the Mango Margarita also great. Great atmosphere thanx guys. 5 stars for u guys.
Michael J.,"Ballston Spa, NY",1,70,66,4.0,3/26/2017,Had a great experience here the other night.  Had a short wait on a Saturday night but it wasn't bad!  Service was ok and the food was fantastic. I had the smokehouse platter which was a ton of food for $18.99 and it wasn't bad BBQ for a chain restaurant.  Apps were also very good (loaded boneless wings and mozzarella bites.
Victoria R.,"Spring Valley, NY",72,36,,3.0,6/23/2017,We came on a Friday afternoon and we're seated right away even though it was pretty busy. Our server was nice and quick. I was happy with my food but after I ordered I saw the specials menu or new menu with better options and I wish I had seen that earlier. A suggestion-waiters can tell people about other menus for more options? The restaurant was nice but it smelled like wet dog and our seat was still a little dirty.
Paul A.,"New City, NY",77,18,,5.0,7/6/2016,"It's been awhile since we last ate here.  Went for a quick lunch with my son and daughter last week.  It turned out pretty well.  I forgot our servers name, but she was very helpful and attentive. Love the new menu.  More choices and combos.   Will definitely come back for more."
Carolyn M.,"Spring Valley, NY",28,50,4,1.0,11/1/2016,The food was exactly what we expected. It was good. The service however was absolutely horrendous and actually basically nonexistent.
Wayne F.,"Nanuet, NY",82,115,25,4.0,8/21/2016,I come here too often. Lol.  The staff and the managers are constantly checking on you to ensure a good dining experience. The food is served in a timely manner which is always key for repeat business.
Rob D.,"West Nyack, NY",34,11,9,4.0,1/8/2017,"This is a comfort restaurant for my family. What you would expect out a Chili's chain restaurant is what they deliver. I rarely if ever have problems here. My family usually orders a 2 ""2 for $22 deal"" so dinner or lunch comes out to around 50 dollars for all of us. I like their burgers, I get a variety of things from their menu but often times I get the bacon burger which isn't bad at all. This restaurant satisfies the needs for everyone in my family as my sister loves to get chicken fingers  (original chicken crispers). Also their fajitas are good! Other than that service is 90% of the time on point and staff are friendly and accommodating. Bathrooms are always clean. They have a sport bar area and general dining room area which are separated. Interior in general looks great, aesthetically. Place is great for families. Give it 4/5."
Angelo P.,"Monsey, NY",0,35,2,4.0,5/21/2017,"Food is... Mehhh for say much, my 4 stars go to the staff (that not include management) great servers, friendly, attentive and fast!"
Mike C.,"Valley Cottage, NY",90,12,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Food and service were good. We sat at a table that sat at a booth and chairs, but instead of 2 chairs there was only one; we didn't need the second chair but it was just odd."
Steve M.,"Nanuet, NY",11,52,33,1.0,8/6/2015,"Service? Service? Buler? I wouldn't be so harsh if it was merely inconsistent.  I have friends that work here, and i try and keep their schedules in mind so i can sit in their section.  One of my customers is local, so chili's makes a nice break from Five Guys. But why does the service have to be so incredibly slow?. It's not like they are even all that busy.  I don't mind the food; I know what to expect.  But I need a quicker turnaround because I'm punching a clock.  I'm sure I'll be back as a matter of convenience, but I'm also sure I'm going to regret it... ON EDIT: Lost another star because they took USA Today off the Ziosk.  Or maybe they expect me to pay for it. Bah!"
Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440,4.0,3/22/2015,"Overall everything went pretty well. Our server was friendly and attentive and the food was pretty tasty. For starters we ordered the boneless buffalo wings, and they're always yummy. I however did ask for xtra blu cheese because it goes pretty quick and she didn't bring it out. For entree I ordered soft beef taco with mashed potato instead of the rice and beans. It was really good ESP with the fresh slices of avacado inside. We were seated in the bar area and it was pretty loud. But, like I said it all went pretty well!"
Sean G.,"West Nyack, NY",15,11,1,2.0,2/4/2015,"The service here sucks. The waiter, I'm wondering if he's really ""the waiter"". Cuz he's no where to be found. Didn't bring in food for everyone at the same time. It's like im getting no service at all.  Took down our orders wrong, even though when I wrote down & pointed menu selection for ordering food.  The server's name is Skye. Had to learn his name from receipt. He didn't offer us any opportunity to order dessert. I guess when he handed me the receipt, he's not interested in getting any good tips from us. I guess he deserved a buck for tip tonight.  Food is alright. Nothing too fancy or die for. I guess it's what we get. Would I want to come back? Nah. Maybe the spot at palisades mall would be lotta better. If you get Skye as your server, ask for another server. U don't want to be disappointed. Trust me."
Jully H.,"Brooklyn, NY",406,333,745,4.0,11/22/2015,what can I say?  yes sometimes I do go to chain restaurants like chilies for example which is my favorite chain restaurant of all time!!! I love everything about chilies the way that they are very affordable they have really good food for being a chain restaurant maybe it's not the lowest calories but who cares I'm skinny anyways.  I love the triple dipper I love the house drinks they're amazing and I've been coming here since forever since I grew up in Rockland.   loyal customer
Jill A.,"Nyack, NY",0,6,1,4.0,11/6/2016,Great food and my server michaelyn really is an asset to this restaurant. She took my order quickly and my drink was served right in time. She was very attentive. Only one thing was wrong I asked for medium steak and it was well done. Otherwise great place
Orlando A.,"Hazleton, PA",0,10,6,5.0,1/19/2016,Let me start with the fact that I usually don't have a good experience at this location BUT the server this time really made my experience turn around 360 degrees... Michaelyn (Server name on my receipt) was my server and she is what every restaurant needs. She understands what sense of urgency is. She had a huge party and several tables and some how she made time and attention to everyone equally - she refilled drinks without asking. She also was telling the other employees to move quicker so she can get to the kitchen... Very impressive....
Patrick L.,"Nyack, NY",4,47,41,4.0,11/23/2014,Showed up at bout 130 on a Sunday afternoon for quick drink and app.  Filled up quickly with ppl watching football Good food. Good prices.  Server was pleasant and responsive Do t understand when ppl complain about the food and service Need to go knowing what to expect. It's not four star It's a chain. Prob better than most
Charles G.,"New York, NY",199,189,135,3.0,10/16/2015,Come here for dinner a couple of times food and service is great and they always have something new to trey on the menu.
Charles O.,"Nanuet, NY",117,23,20,1.0,9/28/2015,"Not what it was when they first opened.  Service is pretty bad, managers don't come around to check up anymore, and food quality is inconsistent.  This has been the last 4 or 5 times I've been there.  It is such a shame - it used to always be the great place to go to in Nanuet.  Unfortunately it has caught up with the horrible experience that you get in West Nyack and Monroe locations."
Phillips M.,"Pomona, NY",51,3,,5.0,9/20/2015,Great food great service shout out to our server Sean very pleased thank you have a splendid night
Vanessa B.,"Nanuet, NY",585,160,321,2.0,11/12/2015,"sit down, it's fine. just remember to order the larger steak option and never the mignon since it's as big as half my fist. take out here is always incredibly small. $10 for the pick three - all i see are two mashed actual potatoes and three cheese wraps that i could make myself in two seconds and by a larger portion. $20 for two- ribs are dry and there's two bones. the steak is destroyed by being over cooked. the burgers seem as big as two white castle burgers. i'm better off at taco bell or wendy's. honestly, there's el bandido the next town over and they have home made $8 platters. finished with chili's."
Lori W.,"New City, NY",33,31,,3.0,1/7/2015,"Chilli's is what you get is what you see. Do not expect a  5 star exquisite dining experience here, If you want to stop in for some tex mex or a quick bite and a cocktail Chilli's is not a bad option. The guacamole is tasty and I love the fajitas."
Gary M.,"Spring Valley, NY",7,13,,2.0,2/6/2015,"Each time I go there I keep saying it's the last. Without specifics, the quality of the food and its cooking has steadily gotten worse. The kitchen is definitely a problem. Serving..... I hate to be rushed but you don't bring the entree to the table when the appetizer is less than half eaten. Wait staff don't seem to understand that. And then there's that ridiculous device now on the table giving the wait staff even less of an excuse to come to the table and service properly. That's it for Chili's. For that type food Applebee's and TGIF are significantly better."
Sarah S.,"Santa Monica, CA",86,26,23,3.0,6/30/2015,"Eh. It was alright. I've been to better chilis. The waiting staff wasn't that great. It's tough that you have to use credit and it's hard to use cash because the waiter never stops by to let you say ""are you gonna use cash?"" So it's like whatever. Food is like any other chilis. Just a place to go to when you have no where else to go to tbh. But I'm not complaining about it. It's come in handy."
Michelle M.,"Bergen County, NJ",577,679,44,2.0,9/28/2013,"I'm a fan of the Chili's chain in general, but this one has serious problems. Rude hostess seemed pissed that we walked in for a late lunch while they weren't busy. It took at least 15 minutes to get a waitress - and only after we flagged someone down (I guess the 7 occupied tables were a bit much to handle. Our waitress was nice enough even though she forgot our side order of guacamole (hence the 2, rather than 1, stars). The food was uniformly overcooked. Bathroom was disgusting.  If you're having a Chili's craving, head to one of the other ones nearby."
Kim N.,"Nanuet, NY",28,70,9,2.0,12/1/2013,"It's a chain restaurant, so pretty general review. But this one in particular is soo slow with service. We waited over 15 minutes just to have our waitress come over and take our orders. The food took forever to get to us, and was on the cool side. And of course where we were seated, wasn't any better. It felt like the forgotten corner. We almost wore multiple trays of food as waiters were coming out of the kitchen while unsupervised children were running to and from the bathroom. We got here at 4:15, and didn't eat until 5:00.  The only reason I'll give it two stars, is for the fact our waitress was polite and tried to do her job. When she had a free moment or remembered us, she would get us refills on our drinks. Overall, I wasn't pleased. And most likely will not be returning to this particular Chili's."
Maire B.,"Nanuet, NY",11,61,,5.0,6/9/2014,"We don't understand the bad reviews for Chili's in Nanuet.   Hubby & I always head over there when we feel like grabbing a bite instead of eating in.   The menu has so many choices, and we can get something light or a large meal,depending on our ""druthers.""  The food is always good, the service is just fine and it's a great change from the umpteen Italian and burger joints in the area. I also go there often with a bunch of ten or so friends and all of us enjoy it.   We go towards the end of the lunch hour when the waiter/waitresses have time to put up with our dumb questions and mixed up orders.   There used to be a great manager named Tony who was also friendly and helpful and we hope to see him back after he recuperates from a recent illness. Our main problem is that we find ourselves in a rut because we enjoy four or five certain dishes and tend to order them all the time, but it's fun and interesting to try some of their other specialties. We are great fans of Chili's Restaurant."
Mike A.,"Nanuet, NY",14,50,,3.0,2/19/2015,Ate here last night with my girlfriend. Its an a-ok place if you want a cheap meal and ok service. The service is a bit slow but luckily they have table side computers now where you can pay. No more waiting 20 minutes for the check. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu which came with an appetizer and 2 dinners. The food was filing and we had enough to take home for lunch the next day. I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was ok. There wasnt much sauce at all. It was actually a pretty dry dish for stating it came with alfredo sauce. I would strongly recommend ordering extra sauce with your meal. But its a big chain restaurant focused on cost and not quality so you can't expect much.
Jen C.,"New City, NY",0,22,21,2.0,12/22/2015,"Ate here yesterday for a late lunch with some friends and was disappointed. We were seated quickly, and food was served quickly, but service was horrible. Took 20 minutes for our waiter to come back with drinks and same with the check. A bunch of the waiters were hanging out with their friends who were dining in (or something like that?) which preoccupied all of them and made it impossible for my group and I to pay and leave. Very disappointed in the rude behavior of the service because we've been here before and this hadn't happened."
Alyssa N.,"Alpine, NJ",0,60,,2.0,4/29/2015,"I'm giving it two stars because the waiter was friendly and professional.  The food was also delicious.  The rest of the experience was not so great.  The booth I sat in was dirty, the table was sticky (had to go in the bathroom to wash my hands and then wash the table on my own).  The ladies room smelled so bad and it was filthy.  I understand it was around 9:30 pm and obviously it gets dirty, but I feel that someone should go in there once in awhile throughout the night to maintain it (other places do that).  The worst part is that the kitchen is in clear eye view once you exit the restrooms.  There was food all over the floor and I saw someone cooking without gloves.  I just feel that the place would get better ratings if it was cleaner."
Tracy M.,"Blauvelt, NY",0,24,7,3.0,9/30/2014,"The wait staff was great and the place was clean. I ordered the 3-appetizer place for my meal, the boneless Buffalo chicken was cold and tasted like it was frozen for awhile, the chicken crisper a were not crispy at all and were room temperature the new onion rings were over cooked and room temperature. My son enjoyed his burger but the side of fries were more for a child's meal than for an adult order. I love the new electronic machine at the tables to pay when you are ready, but patents beware of the charges for the games on the device."
Mister A.,"New York, NY",0,65,2,1.0,9/19/2014,"I have always had a great time here but I guess today was a fluke. The waitress was horrible. And not only was she slow , but the Extras for the fajitas were old and dry. I had to send it back for fresh sour cream. The food watered down. It was nasty and they charged my 14 dollars for one drink. That's crazy. I didn't argue because the waitress was not around instead they had an electronic Machine at the table. Horrible"
Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33,1.0,12/15/2012,"I have said this countless times before, it's a chain, you know what to expect walking in. However, how you are treated makes or breaks the way things go. Case in point I was here with a friend for lunch and a few brews on a day off. The bartender was outrageously inattentive. There were barely any customers around and definitely by no means busy. She was more interested in talking to the regulars and playing with her iPhone then paying attention to customers whose glasses were empty for long periods of time. If I could take pictures of people and put ""Avoid"" under them, I would! Just an absolute shame, and she works for tips....didn't get much that day!"
Ian J.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,475,71,1.0,10/4/2010,"This place is going through a serious change, not sure why, but your best bet is to stay away for a few months. I'm still in shock as to what my friends and I were put through. Most of the issues were staffing related, my food, and one of my friends, were okay. The third, not so much. 2/3 isn't bad, but coupled with difficult service issues, you're better off waiting to see how things turn out."
Vanessa F.,"CHESTNUT RDG, NY",45,63,105,1.0,12/9/2013,"Damn this place sucks. It was raining and I didn't want to take the drive to the palisades. My sister and I came here and there was a short wait. When were seated the waiter came quickly which was good. I ordered the half rack of ribs. It tasted like half bbq sauces, half bitter ketchup. Now, I've never had bitter ketchup but I imagine that this is what it would taste like. My sister got the chicken crispers which she apparently didn't care for too much either. The only thing this chili's has going for them is the service and the fries. Yuck won't be here unless i intentionally plan to starve."
May L.,"Nanuet, NY",0,1,,2.0,9/4/2014,My recent visit at Chili's Nanuet was not a good experience. We selected the 2 entrees for $20 and both our food were tasteless. The chicken quesadillas were very dry and the other meal we ordered was seafood with rice. The rice tasted like hospital food and there weren't any seasoning in the seafood. Please go to the Chili's at Palisades Mall and do not order from the 2 for 20 menu.
Cassiebobassie A.,"Nanuet, NY",0,19,,1.0,5/24/2014,"SLOW SERVICE. You'll age waiting to eat and leave.  So I used to love coming to Chilis. Me and my friends would eat and dine and laugh for hours. However, one day this chain started going down hill. This has to be the third poor experience I've had in Chilis. I have complained to corporate and decided to give it just 1 more chance to redeem it'self.  When we first came in we were seated and met the waitress in about 10mins, and she was very genial and pleasant, took our orders and got our drinks swiftly. She helped me make my decision in getting an entree. It was great until the going got tough. The restaurant started filling up and my drink was near empty. We got our food and were on our own. We ate and sat drumming our fingers until the waitress finally showed up, and waited even longer it seems to get the check.  By then my drink ran dry. She tried to refill it but it was already time to head out the door. My friend and I finally swore to never return - even if we are starving and on our last leg. Could've spent $5 bucks in McDonalds and sat in my friends car and have a better time than the one I did there. I mean I ordered Fajitas and they were good granted, but the food is like a 3/5. It's not going to burst my taste buds, but it'll do the trick. But eating out is about the experience...the ambiance...the atmosphere. NOT worth it. Try Lulu's Diner if you're in the area, or Pancake Plus or anything else."
Stefan B.,"West Nyack, NY",6,113,1,2.0,11/21/2013,"It's a Chilis, which is to say it's not very good. However, this is a pretty good place to watch sports at the bar. They have a bunch of TVs and it's 2 for 1 drinks all day every day. Can't beat that."
Maria B.,"New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/4/2013,"I'm a huge fan of Chili's never had a bad experience until now.  The worst service of my life. Our supposed waiter didn't  even take our order and it was over 20 minutes when somebody finally came to say hi.  We order our drinks and food all at once since we had waited so long.  The kids meal which always comes out first took forever I had to stop our waiter, who never came to check on us if he could hurry it up since my child was starving.  Finally his food came and our food came 30 minutes later just when we were about to leave.  Not once did he come by to see if we needed anything but yet he kept going to the table next to us to make sure they were ok.  It was the WORST experience ever. I never write reviews so that tells you it has to be bad in order for me to write about it. NEVER go to here!!!"
