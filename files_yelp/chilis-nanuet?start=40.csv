Charlie L.,"Orangeburg, NY",1,125,28,4.0,11/4/2012,"A year ago or so, this place did have some weird sh!t going on. I liked getting the burgers, and there was a time or 2 when the burger looked like it just came from a hurricane. Fast forward to today and luckily this place has improved a lot. I still get the burgers and they have been great. I almost always get the buffalo wings which are amazing.  It is a good thing they improved, because imo it would have suffered the same fate as the aweful Bennigans that used to be in New City, NY. Yes I highly recommend this place, at least for take out which is what I usually do."
Kelly T.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,16,8,1.0,10/11/2014,"If I could give zero or negative I would. I just started using yelp, but I went last May for Memorial Day weekend and had severe food poisoning within 3 hours of eating here. I had a chicken quesadilla salad, chop and salsa and a soda. The chicken was pink so I sent it back. A new one came out and appeared fine, tasted like a kinda odd seasoning but ate it. Started getting stomach pains shooting after dinner while out at a movie. Within three hours as soon as we got home I was not only throwing up but also having severe stomach problems the other way too. The next morning I was still sick and called the dr. Kept drinking water and throwing up. Dr ruled it food poisoning and I wasn't better until the Tuesday after and this happened on a Friday. Awful! Later that summer I went to the chillies in butler nj, stayed away from chicken and had a burger. Had stomach problems after that too but nothing as severe. I stay away from all chillis chains now."
Marilyn P.,"Fishkill, NY",128,119,73,5.0,4/7/2009,"I'm giving a chain restaurant five stars???? Oh dear! But this place deserves it.  I've been here a few times and never had a bad experience. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated if I needed to wait at all (you just gotta make sure you get there just before the peak times).  I'm stuffed after every meal. From sandwiches to larger meals, the food is prepared properly and in good portions.  I was especially fond with the way my broccoli was made in my last dish, Monterey Chicken. Great service too, it doesn't hurt that you see the same people working there when you go. That's a good sign.  Even though this is just down the road from the Palisades Mall and Downtown Nyack, this place is worth taking the extra miles on 52 for."
Erick B.,"Nanuet, NY",5,4,1,4.0,3/1/2011,The food is always great.  Service is always friendly and out of the two Chilis in the area this is far better.  I also think they have a larger menu.
Lauren P.,"Queens, NY",0,7,,1.0,12/28/2013,"In the past year we have been to this location numerous times with our toddler.   It's a typical chain restaurant, but the menu is diverse and the prices are great.  My husband usually order off of the two for $20 deal.  Unfortunately, service and quality have gone down so much we will never return to this location again.  The restaurant recently had a makeover.  It initially looked great, but the place hasnt been maintained.  The tables and booster seats are sticky and the walls have food all over them.  Last week my husband said it was like someone ate a whole plate of ribs right off his menu - it was so gross and the pages were stuck together.  The wait staff also seems inattentive.  The kicker really isnt the restaurants fault, but we get a good laugh from it.  Two girls sitting behind us.  It looks like they had a few drinks.  Luckily I missed it, but according to my husband one of the girls projectile vomited across the table.  It appeared that the staff did a half assed job of cleaning up before seating a family at the same booth.  Yuck.  We will not be back."
gary b.,"Nanuet, NY",0,57,,1.0,11/19/2010,"Horrible place- rude staff and especially at the bar. They are just plain robots with no customer service skills and dont treat you like anything else but a credit card. The food gets worse and worse and while its always crowded with drunken business people and construction workers dont be fooled- Its only because the lure of the place is too great for them to resist and they dont know any better. Stupid business chicks and barely above high school looking groups of kids getting their ""drink on"" seem to only be there for the tropical looking drinks and not caring about anything else. Way overpriced foods and way-way out of line drinks that you never see the prices on and when you ask its a look of - so you want that? Nothing to look at below basic waitresses and bartenders make the scene even less fun and appetizing. Looks bad enough the service makes it a pure ""no thanks""! There always seems to be a stale type of smell around the bar area almost like a mildew or unclean smell. Forget a buy back-they do not exist here and you can get them elsewhere."
