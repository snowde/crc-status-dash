Tamer E.,"Placentia, CA",0,32,68,3.0,4/28/2014,"Dropped it from 5 stars to 3 after tasting the food.  Pros: People are nice, loved the place, the Free style coke, and the music was not too loud.  Cons: However, the food didn't taste good. The rice was the worst. Followed by the  grilled chicken, it tasted fake and not fresh off the grill.  Bottom line: I am staying in Norman, OK for four days, I am not going to visit this chili's again."
Savannah M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,111,54,2.0,5/19/2016,"The food was just fine, as it usually is at any location we go to, but the servers could be a bit more attentive and personable. As food service workers, we did not at all think it was busy enough for them to seem so absent minded and less than friendly. One time our server took a very long time to come back and we were ready to order dessert so we ordered on the table screen thing. Several minutes later the server returned and asked if we needed anything else and puzzled, we let him know about our dessert. He rushed back to see about it and came back to tell us it would be just another minute, and that the screen typically lets off a blue light when something is ordered so the server is notified. Uh yeah, it was on for several minutes but you were never here to see it. Doh! Still better than the I-240 location in south OKC though, sadly."
Jeff J.,"Weatherford, OK",13,5,,2.0,4/30/2016,"Terrible service, food was below average for Chili's. Not as clean as it should be. Everything ""felt"" dirty. Anything beyond their 2 for $20 deal is way overpriced for this particular location. Not the worst place I've ever been, but I won't return."
Lana J.,"Irving, TX",23,16,,1.0,11/3/2015,"I have always had good experiences at Chili's...until now. My S.O and I were only in Norman for the weekend and wanted to take my children and grandchild out for a nice lunch before we left. To begin with, the service was horrid. Then we waited nearly an hour for cold food (my grandson's corn dog was burnt) and when we spoke to the manager, he lied about why our food was so horrible and barely gave a discount at all. I will never go back to this Chili's again and I don't know if I will chance a different one after this experience."
Richard M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,4,,4.0,7/1/2016,"Moved locations across I-35 up a couple of miles. New building. Had the lunch combo fresco salad and chicken bowl. Really liked the salad dressing, light and just enough zip. Good portion and pretty affordable a good choice at a big box chain restaurant."
Tiffany T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,1,,1.0,2/18/2014,"This place has gone downhill since I went to OU 5 years ago... Not exactly what a business wants for being located on ""Restaurant Row"". I started working in Norman and due to a strict diet, I started ordering the kid's grilled chicken and broccoli. For two days in a row, it has taken well over 20 minutes to get my food for take out... for a KID'S meal no less. The chicken is dry, but I really have no other option on where to go as both items are on my lunch plan for my diet. Need take out for lunch? Definitely go elsewhere unless you plan on spending over 20 minutes sitting waiting for your meal at a bartenderless bar (take out waiters are apparently not available during the day; and yes, I did call in ahead of time and both days they said it would take no more than 10 minutes). Thankfully the Chili's on NW Expressway and Rockwell has been great, otherwise I would be weaning myself away from Chili's after this location's service..."
R. H.,"Norman, OK",0,2,,1.0,2/21/2016,Our glasses and flatware were dirty. Less than 5 minutes after we received our appetizer we had our meal. So we were given no time to enjoy the appetizer.Then three girls came and stood at our table trying to change the channel on the tv. We had to request a refill on our drinks numerous times even though we had three people right there at the table trying to change the channel. We will never go back. $32 for a horrible date night experience.
Blayke H.,"Norman, OK",115,39,22,1.0,11/23/2015,"Let me just say that generally speaking, I tend to not review chain restaurants unless they REALLY made my day or REALLY made me mad.  Guess which?  I have been in this Chili's a lot.  Mostly because it's near my house and they have some great options on the menu for me as a diabetic.  About 50% of the time we have issues.  Generally unresolved issues.  Last Saturday, the family and I went during some early holiday shopping.  I rarely drink these days, but on occasion I like a nice draught beer.  The waitress, Jazmine, was very nice.  I will admit I have a soft-spot for blue-haired post-punk waitresses, but that's a hold over from my youth.  Oi!  Aaaaaaaanyway, I asked her about the selection of on-tap beers and she quicly rattled off the list.  Stella Artois was there.  Great.  She asked if I wanted the standard size or the 22 oz. large.  I said the 22 oz.  Off she went.  We tried to order the tableside guac, but they had 86'd it.  At 6PM.  On a Saturday.  During a home game in a college town on the last home game Saturday of the season.  Seriously.   Aaaaaanyway, Jazz, can I call her Jazz?  K.  Jazz, brought me back a Stella logo stamped chalice filled to the line.  It was obviously not 22 oz.  I asked her why she brought me a regular sized (and not even a 14 oz or pint sized but we will get to that later) beer.  She asserted that it was indeed a 22 oz. and the glass is just deceptive in appearance because it is different from the regular 22 oz. glasses being specially made by THE STELLA ARTOIS COMPANY THEMSELVES!!!  DUM DUM DUUUUUUUUM!  She then paddled off wile I looked at the glass.  Now, not that you would know it to look at me, handsome, athletic, macho, but once upon a time I was a bartender and quite the connoisseur and consumer of alcoholic beverages.  I know what the hell 22 oz. looks like, and that was not it.  I also know that there are 3 standard sizes of Stella Artois glasses - 33 cL, 40 cL, and 50 cL.  That's in centileters.  a standard unit of measurement from the 800+ year-old Belgian brewery that makes this wonderful beverage.  For the uninitiated, that equates in U.S. measurements to 11.16, 13.53, and 16.91 ounces U.S. respectively.  The glass was clearly marked as a 40 cL glass.  When I brought that to the attention of Jazz, she said she gets that a lot and tried to tell me that the measurement conversion is European and is different than U.S. measurements and insisted that it was still 22 oz.  When I informed her that yes they are different, but that's why the dear sweet Lord and the almighty Innerwebz invented conversion charts, she said she would go ask the bartender.  A few minutes later, the bartender, a young lady whose name I did not get came over and brought me a full 22 oz mug (visibly and VERY obviously much larger) and claimed that she tested it herself by pouring a whole glass of the Stella into the 22 oz. mug and it filled it all the way up.  She then said that she just brought me the 22 oz. because it obviously made me feel better.  How magnanimous of her.  I also call BS, because A.  I'm not  stupid, and B.  she did this experiment not in view and would not repeat it to show me.   Later, after a mediocre meal, Jazz (who once again was great by the way and this is in no way a reflection of her because...) came by and said that she was sorry and that was just what her manager told her to say about the glass sizes, and that she obviously saw the difference too.  So, Not very interested in going back and called the ABLE commission this morning to let them know that they are trying obviously to defraud customers to save money or to placate the Stella reps who want them to use their glassware, but don't make them in sizes that meet Chili's standard glass sizes.  So, As I stated above, not happy.  Oh well, I can just strike them off of my list anyway.  I'll probably live through it.  I hope you find a better place to go Jazz.  You and your blue locks deserve better from management."
Nicole W.,"Norman, OK",91,3,,1.0,6/18/2015,"I have never had a good experience here. The service is HORRIBLE. I had a waitress probably in her early 20s, and I don't remember her name. Probably because she never told us! She was hateful, never checked our drinks, and I was with my mother which makes it even worse. I wanted my mom to have a good dining experience and needless to say we will NEVER go back here. There is a waitress with medium length white blonde hair who is very cute and pleasant, and did a good job once before when I had been here. So she is the only good thing about this chilis I have experienced. Mainly I am mad about the service and how many of the waitresses or waiters SUCK!!!!"
Hilary L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,,5.0,1/31/2016,I love this chilis! The staff is so nice and service is great. I love the Cajun chicken pasta. Can't wait to go back!
Cassie H.,"Norman, OK",24,18,20,1.0,2/7/2014,"I was sorry I had to highlight one star for this establishment.  The service is terrible-for a party of two it took us almost two hours and they were not that busy-plenty of empty tables.  Out food was completely lackluster-semi-warm and bland.  Our ticket was wrong, and although they fixed it, this whole experience was less than mediocre.  This might just be my last Chilis visit, ever."
Nathan H.,"Norman, OK",0,11,1,4.0,2/7/2015,"Great food with good deals including bottomless soup and salad and 2 for 20. Went to watch a basketball game, and they put it on 2 TV's for us. Good service until we paid, then refills stopped. We were there for 2 hours though, but another coke would have been nice"
Cory H.,"Norman, OK",0,27,187,1.0,10/4/2009,"If your 2 favorite things in the whole world are: 1. Eating at awful chain restaurants 2. Watching herds of sorority girls in their natural habitat ...then go to Chili's in Norman, OK.  You won't be disappointed."
Rubye J.,"Portland, OR",0,20,,1.0,12/9/2012,"Absolutely terrible! I've been here twice. The first time, the bartender made a great drink and so of course I was happy and went back a second time. This time it was a different bartender and she was extremely rude. The drink was weak and my food was cold and tasted old. I've been to other Chili's which are not so bad, but the Norman one is a big mistake."
Lacy K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",10,77,,4.0,4/2/2010,"Sat in the bar last night with a friend and I was very impressed with our service. Our waiter was extremely attentive. We had the classic margarita, it was HUGE and delicious at a good price (I think they were around 3.99)."
