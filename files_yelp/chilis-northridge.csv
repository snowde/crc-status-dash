Jess M.,"Rosemead, CA",7,26,27,4.0,12/13/2017,"This is one of our favorite workday lunch spots and happy hours for around four years now! The manager, Alex, is the main reason we keep coming back. He knows how to take care of customers, he trains his staff well on customer service. The current wait staff & bartenders are good! (There have been a few bad ones in the past.) There's a nice, chill vibe in the restaurant so it always feels good hanging out there. Great place for a group party or a big family meal together! Never once have I or my coworkers had any complaints about the food. I like the smokehouse combo with ribs, sausage, fries and elote, the steak plate, sliders, tortilla soup, and many of the other appetizers. I mean, it's a chain restaurant, so it's not the best steak in my life, but it's always cooked right and delicious. I'd have to say that the best thing is that the food is consistent-- I can count on ordering my favorites and they'll come out as good as last time."
Alfredo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,43,4,1.0,12/10/2017,"Arrived around 7ish pm on 12/9/17. The wait time was 5 minutes (not bad) . Was seated and ordered drinks. Ordered the side table guacamole and first of all it didn't have ANY flavor , it didn't have cheese and it wasn't  spicy .. $10 bucks for this no thanks. Then the food came out, I got the 3 combination fajitas which have steak, chicken and shrimp. The only bad thing was the steak it tasted like rubber (how does that even taste like?)...  Now the Service was just awful , didn't get refills when asked for one. Asked for a box to go and had to wait literally 10-15 minutes. I ended up leaving a half plate of fajitas since I just got so frustrated with their service. This is not worth coming to , I expect to be treated better than this since I'm the one paying for their services and their food they advertise all over television . Only reason I came because it played a commercial on television and on an empty stomach it hit me... Sadly I won't be coming to this chili's location or any other one in the future."
Erix V.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,45,22,1.0,11/28/2017,"SO DISAPPOINTING. I always go to this location (in person) and they treat us so well. Usually I have nothing to say. But we JUST ordered this place to deliver thru postmates and I'm sad.. a little angry... but mostly disappointed because we always order this and today we received nothing of the norm. First of all there was a missing item: our prized loaded mashed potatoes. The pasta was dry, her mango Chile chicken was dry and overall, this was not a meal that was worth the $27 spent (see pictures). It's sad, too.... I actually love Chili's... especially this one. Maybe it's because they didn't see us face to face? If that is so, that's even worse when it comes to their work ethic."
Anet Y.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,51,86,5.0,12/12/2017,This is my favorite spot in the valley. There is usually a 30 minute wait on the weekends but it is worth the wait. They have great food and drinks. They have great deals for dinner. You can get appetizer and entrees for 2 only for 22 dollars or add drinks and dessert for 35 dollars. The service is always good and food is decent.
Vanessa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,52,116,4.0,3/7/2017,"First time ever going to a Chili's, and honestly.. it was okay. I would give a 3 stars if it wasn't for the waiter. I was interested in the little game pad they have on the table, and accidentally ""bought"" game sessions. I let the waiter know, and he saw that we didn't play on it, so he took off the charge. That took $4 off our total- which might not seem like much, but it is when we're paying that much for nothing. I wish I got his name, but whoever you are, thank you. You da homie. Anyway, I got the dinner meal where you get appetizers, and 2 dinner entrees for $24. Appetizer was chips with guac & salsa. Dinner was a burger and pasta. I prefer the burger over the pasta- the taste of the pasta after a while was too overwhelming. This was definitely a steal. There was enough food leftover for breakfast. Would I come back here again? Sure."
Stephanie May L.,"Granada Hills, CA",230,114,249,4.0,2/14/2017,"Love Chilis! They always have great deals. They have the 2 for 22 which includes one appetizer to share and 2 entrees. With this I am able to get a 6 oz. of steak which comes with 2 sides. There are also many choices for this deal. They also had the $10 for 3 courses which included an appetizer, entree & molten lava cake. Not sure if they still have it though. Tip: Order the molten lava cake. It is by far my favorite dessert out of all restaurant desserts I've had."
Anthony M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,21,3,1.0,8/29/2017,"Fucking horrid. This place seems to have been designed for people with limited attention spans and a fear of conversation.  My new rules for happy dining out: 1) No place with screens on the fucking tables. 2) No place so loud I can't even hear myself fart. 3) No place staffed by fucking undergrads. The loud music coupled with loud conversations made for an unbearably uncomfortable evening. Food took too long to arrive, and when it did half of it was cold. I had no idea ribeye has gristle. Oh, wait. It fucking doesn't. Ordered one drink - a Margarita, easy - and it took fucking ages to arrive, and when it did it was a weak, watery disappointment. The damned thing took so long the manager made his way over, unbidden, to meekly apologise that they'd ""dropped the ball"". That was appreciated, but it wasn't enough to remedy the overall annoyance of the evening. If you're not a fan of Bros or of sticky tables and cold entrees, avoid this place like the fucking plague. End of rant."
Rose N.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Placed a to-go order here on Monday. Ordered the prime rib tacos for my husband, and I got the Cajon pasta. With chicken. Got home and there was no chicken on my pasta. Instead there was shrimp. Can't eat shrimp. I'm allergic. Tried one of my husband's tacos... the meat in this taco there's absolutely no resemblance the prime rib. It was completely dried out and had a horrible taste to it. Not only that we have to have a chimichurri sauce on the side. And of course it was not on the side. My husband ate the pasta and he enjoyed it. Don't get excited this man will eat anything. I can't really critique the pasta considering I couldn't eat it because it had shellfish in it. You need to pay for better attention to what you're doing with your to-go orders. Very disappointing. I will not come back here again."
S B.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,38,29,2.0,10/1/2017,"I was raised to "" if I have nothing nice to say, I shouldn't say nothing at all"" that's how bad things are here The manager is the only reason I am giving 2 stars. He was great and really did his best to make things better"
Rania O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,1.0,9/2/2017,"This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. I ordered a simple salad and they brought me a salad that was missing most of the ingredients and had a completely different lettuce.  I told the waitress , she asked if I wanted something else. I ended up ordering the fajitas since there isn't many options for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes ( who was starving by this time, as my parents both already finished their meals).    Finally my new meal comes and as I start eating a few bites of the veggies, there was a huge hair on the onions. Seriously, how could this even happen. I literally wanted to throw up. She took it back and apologized and had a manager come by. All he said was he was sorry and things happen. He asked if I wanted anything else, I said no. He took my meal off the bill and we were on our way. We shouldn't have paid for any of the meals after this experience but I'll choose my battles. I ended up going to habit burger and getting a salad.  Save you money and your time."
Debby B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",104,42,2,4.0,11/18/2017,"Went there tonight with my daughter, 3 granddaughters and my 1 yr. old  great granddaughter. I wasn't too excited to go there.  Zach was our waiter and he changed my mind.  He was very cheerful and smiling and did everything that needed to be done to make us happy.   The food was delicious, our orders were done right, except my fries.  Had to return them to get cooked more.  I like them x x x well done.  Most places are afraid to make them the way I like them.  When Zach brought them back, they were perfect. Everyone loved my great granddaughter and talked to her as they were passing our table, customers and staff.  We all had a good experience this time."
Shannon O.,"Chatsworth, CA",138,2,,1.0,6/5/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to risk eating the HAIR of someone who works here.... Absolutely horrible service and health code violations. Let me tell you about my experience.... I ordered the Prime Rib Tacos and asked to have them with the Prime Rib, jack cheese, and cilantro. Instead of beans and rice for the sides, I subbed in for fries and corn. This meal also is supposed to come with avocado slices and a salsa kind of side as well.  When my food arrived, the server who took my order, brought out a dish that had the tacos without any cilantro on them and with the beans and rice on the plate. Fries and corn weren't in sight. She took my dish back and brought the proper sides but then I realized that there were also no avocado slices or pick salsa. I was the one who had tell my server who took my order that it was wrong and ask for them to correct my plate.....TWICE. My guest was almost finished with her meal by the time my meal was corrected. Upon this happening, all the waitress did was offer a free ""mini cake"", I demanded my food be taken off our tab.  After my meal was corrected, I was enjoying my tacos which were absolutely delicious but as I reached my 3rd taco, a giant SIX INCH HAIR was dangling out of my taco! How disgusting! The manager brought me out new tacos but at that point I didn't want to eat any food that came from this place! I told the manager that I refused to pay for any of my bill including my guests bill and she agreed and said that we didn't need to pay for anything.  After this, a waitress spilled water onto the ground as it dripped down from a cup and it was never taken care of or attended to.  The ground in our section was so dirty with tons of food and crumbs under every booth.  Do not eat here!!! Your health is at risk!!! The health department has been contacted and I hope this location either majorly improves or gets shut down if things do not change.  I"
Benny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1082,64,61,5.0,5/16/2017,"This review is Not like my first review about a chili's I was at on the super bowl  This place is so much better the service is great here fast and very nice guys no rude faces if u ask for anything they say yea sure no problem I like that alot I want to tell you guys I made a mistake and ordered a grilled chicken salad didn't ask what's in it and they put there house dressing and some cheese I didn't really like it. so I told our Waiter I don't really like cheese and the house dressing she said with in a split sec do u want a new one with out the cheese and dressing.. I said yes please and with less then 5 min I had a new salad with new chicken and with ranch which I asked for, was great taste.  and everything else was great"
Kevin M.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",27,2,,4.0,10/29/2017,"The light chatter in this well-lit diner added perfectly to the overall ambience. The friendly faces always seem to have time to give you a smile as they zip by with orders. Estevan immediately seemed to understand exactly how I felt as soon as I made my order and made sure to check if I was enjoying my grilled chicken fajita intermittently. The food was delicious and the service, cheerfully brisk."
Victor G.,"North Hills, CA",123,168,304,2.0,5/8/2017,"So yet again the service was great, my waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  When I ordered my food it wasn't as hot as it should of been, when it arrived. I ordered the sampler trio and the chicken pieces felt like it was just sitting in the back until someone orders it. The happy hour is nice, I will probably only return for that."
Karla M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,11,1.0,12/13/2016,"My first and last time visit.  Waitress needs to be organized and be attentive to the customer in what they need what they have missing in the order. I told her to check the cheese before they service because my had mold. ( they didn't check it, they tried to give me more of the same) no thanks!  Never again :("
Kenny D.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",206,252,701,2.0,4/24/2016,"I saw that there was a deal of half rack ribs, salad, fries, and a dessert for only $11 and I just had to stop by to pick up some food.  I placed my order via their website and arrived about 5 minutes earlier than my scheduled pick up time and I was told it wouldn't be ready for another 5-10 minutes which wasn't a big deal.  About 25 minutes later my meal was finally ready. The salad could be fresher, it was pretty old and wilted.  Fries seemed like they had been sitting out for a while.  Ribs weren't that bad but they lacked the smoky taste.  I actually liked their Dr. Pepper bbq sauce but wished there was more of it.  The ""molten chocolate"" wasn't molten and had pretty much solidified, but the cake itself was good. Pretty good value for the amount of food you receive but having to wait an extra 20 minutes past my scheduled pick up time doesn't sit too well with me."
Krista K.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,124,374,5.0,4/4/2017,"Was greeted by the sweetest hostess ever, Evelyn I believe was her name.. The bartender knew my last name. His name, Barton. Drinks were fabulous and the food hot!"
Debbie F.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/20/2017,"My family and I love our local Chili's Grill and Bar in Northridge, CA. Today Lolly took care of use. She was awesome!  I went today to say goodbye to their Mexican food items that are being replaced Monday, September 18th. Can't wait to see their new menu items! DebbieF"
Jose P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,4,4.0,10/12/2017,"Great place to catch a game, hang with family or friends. Service was good, friendly staff, good food. Many appetizers and cocktails to choose from. Parking might be tight, small parking spaces and wiggle room, close to Cal State Northridge, many students roaming around and always heavy traffic on Reseda"
Aleks R.,"La Puente, CA",46,22,14,2.0,2/19/2017,"Just left this location and could not believe the service I had. I've been a patron here for 6+ years and have NEVER had an issue with food, service, or anything. I LOVE this place and the only reason it isn't a one star.  Homeboy that served us was a middle aged white guy. No name tag no introduction. First he forgets our drink order after taking it, comes back and asks for our order again. When he brings our drinks out he DROPS them on the table and even managed to get mine wrong.  I'm not a complaint person so when he asks me which I prefer I go ""no problem dude"" he responds ""good because I don't feel like getting what you ordered anyways"" - that's fine I'll let it go.  Then homeboy disappears for half an hour. We tried flagging him down at least 5 times and he just stormed passed us. Finally when he decides to take our order 45 minutes after we arrive he goes ""thanks so much for being so liberal with your time.""... Really? On the plus side when I spoke to the GM Alex and he was EXTREMELY helpful. Hopefully they let this guy go or AT LEAST get his attitude in check because this really is a quality branch... But seriously - this dude is a dick."
Ch G.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/6/2017,This location is awful  We wait for 40 minuets but inside there was about 8 tables Free  When we asked them they didn't have any reasonable answer
Nathan F.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/20/2017,"This place actually looked pretty nice, then when we walked in, no one was at the front to seat us. The bartender had to come and seat us. Then when the food came out, I kid you not, my ribs came out on a damn prison food tray lol. I was like wow you've got to be kidding me. Like damn, I know food doesn't always look the same as the picture on the menu, but come on, I at least expected the plate from the picture. So I started to eat and I swear, these ribs were the most apprentice/beginners level kind of ribs I have ever tasted. They tasted like school cafeteria food. It was garbage to say the least. Waitress was nice, but she only came around to check on us about 3 times and that was because I asked for ranch and a refill, never checked on us just to check on us. Last time eating at a Chili's restaurant."
David K.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,200,7,3.0,3/20/2017,"I've been here a few times. They have some okay items, but I can't really see ever wanting to come here too often when there are so many other great places."
Jackie K.,"Glendale, CA",4,53,32,4.0,2/22/2017,I had a steak fajita and it was very good. Few of the pieces were under cooked. But I'm one of those that doesn't like to see any read. I'm sure it would be fine for anyone that likes medium well.
Atosa T.,"San Francisco, CA",77,230,744,4.0,8/7/2016,"Slow service, but foods were really tasty. The dining area was crowded and full of costumers who came for the Olympics game. The server was slow and the reason that I give 4 stars is only her."
Michelle B.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",217,9,,5.0,4/11/2017,"I have been a regular here for almost a decade. The bar area is almost always open and has an amazing happy hour and even better bartenders and bar backs- especially in the evening. If you want a table out of the bar area at peak hours, it can be a bit of a wait. But the food is still just as amazing and the service is usually amazing.  But really, can't beat the bartenders quality at the happy hour price. Scotty, Jared, and Michael will not only take care of you but make you feel safe and at home."
David P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6,19,8,4.0,3/30/2017,Im quite surprised with the quality of dinner I just enjoyed the steak was rather good the environment was good service was okay waitress forgot something I ordered it but it didn't matter overall I recommend it 2 people $40
Russell S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3111,30,37,5.0,11/26/2016,"I had dinner at your Northridge location with my family and I had such a great experience, I had to say something.  We had Miguel as our server and what an exceptional job he did.  Miguel's service was on point, he was attentive and his hospitality made us feel like we were at home.  Food was delicious and margaritas were amazing!  As we were eating the manager Frank stopped by our table and we had an great conversation.  Frank has an amazing PASSION for his job and ensuring that every guest leaves happy!  As we were finishing up Frank stopped back by and interacted with my kids and thanked our family for coming in..... WOW!  Frank thanked us for coming in, you don't get that genuine hospitality anymore and Frank owned it!   Thank you so much, we will be back soon!"
Morgan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,15,,1.0,6/21/2017,"I ordered the sirloin which comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and I also ordered an additional side salad all to go.  Once I got back home and opened my food, I saw that the only give me a steak and salad!  I've been waiting for the manager to get on the line for 15 minutes now"
Leanna M.,"San Fernando, CA",0,12,3,5.0,8/3/2017,The mango chile chicken was sooo good ! Loved the food and had an awesome attentive waitress karissa ! My experience was awesome ! :)
Chelsea C.,"Calabasas, CA",50,33,10,1.0,7/14/2017,If I could give no stars I would. This is literally the longest wait to get a table and the longest wait to get service . The server was an asshole who didn't get to us for 10 mins because he's flirting with girls at the other table : not to mention the food was horrible . Actually cold and gross. It was very unappealing . Not going back to this chillis
Manuel S.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",73,14,,4.0,6/6/2017,"Had lunch at Chili's, haven't been at a Chili's in quite a while this was a good lunch and I loved their salsa, but the best part was that we had good service by Nicholas, he was professional and very friendly"
Tom G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,10,1.0,10/11/2016,"Super bad customers service, half of the place is empty and they make you wait saying they don't have service to the other side , not recommended at all, poor service, none of the managers around to take care of the customers with need.... Sad sad sad"
Angelica A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,Good luck trying to get acknowledged by the bartenders if you're sitting at the bar rail. We didn't even get to try the food because we didn't get any service. What's worse is there's only two other parties at the bar.
Lucia L.,"San Fernando, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/18/2017,"First and last time coming to this location . Waitress was rude from the beginning, and wasn't attentive at all. It took our appetizer 30 minutes to come out, when people that got there after us got them faster than me and my husband. They forgot our guacamole and took another 10 minutes for one little scoop of guacamole to come to our table. We decided to speak to a manager and the waitress came saying our food is almost out after we wanted to speak to the manager ... 30 seconds later she comes with our food cold as if it was sitting there for a while . We finally spoke to the manager and told him that we didn't want the food to just charge us for the appetizer we did eat and the drinks . Took another 20 minutes for us to get our bill. The manager and waitress had no respect for their customers time . I really wish my first time experience would have been way better."
RayRay A.,"Granada Hills, CA",54,2,,1.0,7/2/2017,This place is horrible! The waiters and waitresses make you feel very uncomfortable when you order. Three waitresses walked into a room and stared at me and my sister's. After that everytime they passed are table they would mad dog us. Very unfriendly and rude workers. They also messed up on our order. I've always came to this chili's and they've always been great but recently everyone here became rude and unfriendly. I don't recommend coming here. Drive a little further for a better experience.
Jaime P.,"Pasadena, CA",26,19,1,2.0,5/13/2017,"Oh chillis ... it seems like the cheaper the real estate the better the experience at one of these places. Manhattan Beach location is garbage. Northridge is only marginally better but still lacking in quality.  The ribs felt like the only seasoning on them was barbecue sauce. The ""grilled"" chicken on the Caribbean salad was just microwaved frozen chicken cutlets. The waiter was aloof (bordering on rude and altogether laissez faire) and offered to top off our drinks only to have me remind him close to 10 mins later that we were still waiting for some more refreshment. We had to wait about 10 minutes to actually get out order in w/him. By all accounts ... this really should have gotten a 1 star review but I still have fond memories of the Moreno Valley Chillis so it gets an extra star.  Never coming back to this one again."
Dana K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",370,503,12213,4.0,1/4/2015,"Chili's, I've been here so many times and its always pretty consist. The service is good,  the food is pretty decent and it's not a bad price.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and it wasn't too crowded even though this Chili's does get very crowded because it's near the CSUN, the nearby university. We noticed there's was a deal on the menu where for $35 you get an appetizer, two different entrées, two margaritas, and a choice of dessert. The only thing is you have to pick off their approved appetizers and entrées, which was a little limited.   I think the $35 deal was pretty great but only one thing was disappointing. We wanted the tableside guacamole and you cannot get this with the $35 deal. There is a deal for chips and guacamole but it's not the tableside one and includes onions and I am allergic to onions so I had to order guacamole separately which kind of sucked. So that was an extra $7.  However our waiter Mike was very nice and patient. We had some kids with us that were making quite a mess and he didn't seem to mind at all.  As for the food, we ordered the table side guacamole, which was good. The chicken fajitas which were decent, and the chicken crispers which were delicious!  We finished it off with a cookie skillet for dessert which was decent. My friend said the margaritas weren't that strong but did the trick! Lastly, Chili's has a new thing at the table that looks like a little TV. It is a little touch screen where you can order food, play games for a small fee, pay your bill and look through the menu! It's very cool!"
Ray P.,"Northridge, CA",6,58,1,1.0,7/15/2016,"I used to love this place. Having lived a block away, this was my local go to spot for happy hour, quick sit down eats, etc. I later moved a couple miles south. I still would come here just not so often.  Happy hour is still good. The kiosks they have are awesome for easily splitting up checks. No complaints on that end. However. Of the last 4 x in the last 4 months that we have been there, on 2 visits we had a curly hair in our food and 1 time we had an actual bug. The waiter handled it well each time. Each time a manager even came out to apologize and comp the dish (not the meal) and bring out a new one. I thought that it's about as best as they can do. Can't turn back time. Can't make things un-happen. That's all they can do really. I won't knock them for that but a big part of me does not want to step foot in this particular location again. The thought that we had something 3 out of the last 4 times now all of the sudden kinda grosses me out. Something must have gone down hill overs the years. I may come here with friends if that's where we end up, but I think I'll eat before hand and just have their beers. Despite whatever the hell is going on in the kitchen, they still have frosty cold beer here."
