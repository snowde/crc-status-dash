CJ O.,"Escondido, CA",1,11,3,4.0,12/28/2017,"Been coming to Chilis for 10 years! Favorite go-to spot for drinks and sports.  Had one REALLY bad experience with a former manager named Shawn LaDeux. Stacy was all over it and fixed the issue. Shawn is no longer at this location . Lindsay and Javier are by far the best waiters at this location. LOVE conversation, engage in all topics. Remembers orders. VERY friendly.  I DEFINITELY recommends the ""Blue Pacific"". This is an older drink that is longer on the menu. Only old timers know about this drink ;)"
Emily R.,"Sacramento, CA",102,67,4,5.0,9/4/2017,We went to Legoland and decided to have dinner at Chili's. It was a busy. Saturday night! The hostess was very nice! Told us it was about 25mins wait. She saw how tired and hungry the kids were and she got us sat in 10 mins  Our server Brandan was so sweet! Very pleased to talk too! He got our food and drinks out fast! Great place to eat Thank you
Erich C.,"Oceanside, CA",542,487,1432,3.0,8/6/2017,"It's a chain.  I typically don't like eating at chains because they are so formulaic.  Still, when I discovered Chili's had happy hour all day long on Sundays - I thought why not? Of course, we learned it was only in the bar area...drat!  (we had our kids with us) We got a booth and each of us ordered.  My wife and I got the 2 for $22 deal with drinks (which came to $35).  Not a bad deal really.  The Presidente margaritas came in a shaker and had the small margarita glass I have ever seen!   The fajitas were just okay.  The onions and peppers were not grilled enough.  I like to see some char on my grilled foods.  We did order chips & salsa with guac as our appetizer and I have to admit they were pretty freakin' good.   My wife enjoyed her burger and the kids loved their pizza.  One daughter did not like the chicken mac & cheese, but I thought it tasted good. We'll be back on a Sunday and sit in the bar next time.  If we had that chance today I might have boosted them another star ;)"
Jenny R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",149,71,106,4.0,1/2/2018,"As always food was good, I wish our server was quicker with the orders but it could be because he was busy."
Sara K.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",52,5,,5.0,1/10/2018,"The food and drinks are great, Javier the bartender was delightful. He was very attentive and a great conversationalist! I will definitely be back."
Chris W.,"San Diego, CA",14,36,3,1.0,12/29/2017,"Walked in.. Host was friendly and advised if we wanted to sit in the bar we wouldn't have to wait just have someone bus an empty booth. Three girls standing around talking, finally a guy comes by and we ask if someone can clean the booth... He looks at us... Says nothing... Grabs a plate off the table and oddly walks away... Annnnd so did we."
Mary R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/31/2017,"This is regarding the male bartender on duty 12-31-2017 @ 4:20pm. I went in to the bar area, which was unusually empty for New Years Eve afternoon....There were plenty of open seats at the bar and plenty of open tables at the bar area. So I sit down and wait, and wait and wait. Finally the female bartender, who is trying to leave from her shift, while the on-duty bar tender is standing there washing the same glass over and over staring at the big screen, she asks me i've been helped yet. I said no and she immediately asked what I wanted and served me. After that I decided to just have one drink and leave. Soon after that, two girl college students come in and his face lights up and he serves them immediately. Hmmm, hope he likes the $0 tip I gave him. Hope he doesn't like his job and moves on."
Marcus G.,"Monterey, CA",107,6,2,5.0,12/4/2017,"I come Atleast once a week for lunch and a beer. I'm mostly served by kaylin who is on top of the bar, getting drunks right away and keeping it clean. It's chili's, I come for the bar, but it's exactly what I expect when I look around. People are working, laughing, food is coming out. It's my lunch spot, I recommend."
D T.,"Oceanside, CA",1,4,,4.0,11/12/2017,Pleased with service in the bar area this evening. We enjoyed the steak and burger.... And dessert. Great job!
Bell S.,"San Diego, CA",530,42,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Came here to satisfy my craving (being 5 months pregnant cravings are fierce) walking in at noon I was surprised to see no wait. Yelp was right on target about their ""no wait time"". Hostess opened up the door for us , sat us promptly. Very friendly server as well! This has been the fastest friendliest service we've had in some time. They've changed the menu again but luckily they still had what we came for - Santa Fe chicken salad and Santa Fe rolls. Yummmmmmmy! We will be back"
Leslie E.,"Long Beach, CA",720,298,468,3.0,3/14/2017,Start with some of them give chips if your member of their club or whatever it's called.  This one does not.  The food was average.  I did not find the quality out of the kitchen to be that good. The place was clean. Even the bathroom. With all the choices around them this is not a place I would bother with.  I will try others in the area and let you all know.  This place.    Pass
Niloufar B.,"Oceanside, CA",10,37,33,5.0,7/9/2017,My family and I had a great time here. We didn't even have to wait and was seated immediately. Our server was great unfortunately I didn't catch his name but he was very helpful. My 4 year old was cranky and hungry and I asked if I could her food come out right away and he came back in 2 min with her food! It was great and that helped us a lot! Everyone there was helpful we had multiple server and our main server come and check on us to see if there is anything we need. The food tasted great. We are a big fan of the chips and salsa here so def will go back! Thanks again
Cheyenne B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,12,23,4.0,3/5/2017,"Can't go wrong with Chili's 2 for $22! You get 2 entrées plus an appetizer all for $22. I recommend the honey chipotle chicken crispers, they're amazing!"
Jolene M.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,2,2.0,9/24/2017,"Brought our kids here and were seated near the kitchen.... which felt more like a bar... at 1am. The cooks and servers walking in and out cussing, flipping each other off and yelling in front of the kids the entire time.  It sounds like a bunch of 16 year olds run the place. The food wasn't bad but we definitely won't be back."
Steve L.,"Oceanside, CA",6,8,4,5.0,9/5/2017,Chili's is back! I had a bad experience on the east coast 10 years ago. Haven't been back since until tonight. And tonight was great! The honey hipotle chicken and waffles was surprisingly exceptional! Tina our server was fantastic with her southern hospitality charm! I will definitely be returning for their late night specials!
Titina H.,"Escondido, CA",76,1,6,5.0,7/10/2017,"I absolutely love this chili's! I would like to give a special shout out to my manager ""Manny Fresh"" I came in on my day off and the shift was already covered! He fixed me lunch for my ride! That's what taking care of your team looks like! Thanks Manny!"
Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,819,2.0,5/8/2016,"God, this review has been sitting in my queue for over a year now.  Not sure why I just didn't delete the suggestion, though I do come here and even check-in on occasion.  I guess I really should get this out of the way. /sigh Alright, I typically lump Chili's in with all the other places in the chain restaurant category.  If you've been to one Island's (the Denny's of tacky burgers), you've been to them all.  If you've eaten at one Marie Calendar's (the Denny's of fake home cooking), you eaten at them all.  If you've subjected to yourself to one Rimel's (the Denny's of Denny's), you're probably lying in the ICU at the hospital with an inflamed bowel ravaged by dysentery.  Well, Chili's is the Tex-Mex version of Denny's, not quite Mex enough to be an El Torito and not quite Tex enough to violate minority rights. Harmless enough, any appetizers you find are likely pre-frozen and fried up, salads will come out of a mixed bag, and most of the spice will come from salt.  That's not to say the food is bad, it's just basic and unimaginative.  A lot of cheese, some bacon sprinkled on top, a side of fries, and some cream based dressing can make anything edible for a night.  And they serve beer, which is how they stay afloat along with happy hour, I'm sure. The employees are generally nice, though absent most of the time.  I think this stems from from the fact that there are mini-computers on each table that can take orders instead of a waiter of waitress that you have to pay.  We've had trips here where we see someone to make our initial order, someone else deliver, and then never see another soul unless we ask for a refill or the bill on that touch screen.  That's extremely lazy (or cheap) on Chili's part and a bit of a disservice to their customers. Still, as far as chain places go, it's generally more alright than disgusting.  There's nothing on the menu that you have to come back and try again, but there's rarely anything you won't push away either.  Again, coated with cheese and served with blue cheese, you'll probably not complain too much.  And if you stick with happy hour and maybe a dessert, you'll more than likely walk out with a smile and a light stomach ache."
Jim H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,48,3,1.0,1/25/2017,"Absolutely terrible. Anyone that thinks chilli's represents good food or value for money needs to have a word with themselves.  Paying $14 for a grill chilled sandwich would be fine if it was the greatest chicken sandwich ever, made from the finest ingredients, and served with care and attention. But this wasn't any of those things. More accurately, I'd say this was cooked from frozen slop, served by staff that couldn't care less. You get better food at McDonald's- no joke. How is this a national chain??? Why do people go here??? This was my 2nd time ever at a chilli's and I will never be back for a 3rd.  Complete rubbish."
Greg B.,"San Diego, CA",74,298,200,2.0,11/7/2015,"Not a great experience overall.  First of all, when walking in a few minutes before noon there wasn't anyone manning the front desk. I realize it's still kinda quiet but you've been open for an hour and you're about to get the lunch rush. Why is there no one up there? Even after we seated ourselves in the bar area (where everyone in the restaurant was dining at the time) we still had to flag someone down because no one was paying attention. What's worse is that this seems to be a common problem in a lot of reviews. Management, take note.  The food itself is just cheese, salt, and butter - and not in a good way either. The nacho appetizer was drenched in cheese and they weren't really nachos; they were more like...cheese chips. Not what you'd envision nachos as being. For the main course for some reason I felt inspired to order a ribeye steak. Speaking of which, when the hell did Chili's start cooking steaks? Either way, it was just okay. Seasoning was eh, the slab of butter I could have done without, and the temperature was rare. **Regarding the temperature: I usually order medium all the time but I've just about given up on restaurants being able to actually cook their steaks right. Usually if I order medium it comes to me well done, so I felt adventurous and ordered medium rare thinking they'll cook it up one temperature to a medium. The plan backfired as it came out rare. I don't really mind rare and this isn't as much of an issue as I'm making it out to be but I'm just sayin'. Anywho, moving on, the mashed potatoes were a disaster. Loaded with way too much butter and were topped with some kind of hard cheese shell thing? I don't even know how to describe the damn thing but it was weird. As someone who makes the greatest mashed potatoes in the world I struggled with these things. Good potatoes go beyond massive slabs of butter.  The other member of my party ordered a chicken bacon club sandwich thing that was topped with so much lettuce that even a vegan would complain about it. Check out the pic.  Also, this restaurant is located in a massive plaza with about 40 other restaurants. If you approach this one from the west you'll notice that there's no sign on the side of the building to indicate that, yes, this is indeed a Chili's. Kind of odd. Service was nice, though. But the food was really eh, the potatoes were ehhhhh, and not having anyone take note of customers walking in was like what? At the end of the day it's a chain and you get what you pay for. Next time I'll play it safe and get ribs or a burger."
Heidi I.,"Oceanside, CA",373,515,1161,2.0,8/8/2015,"See my more detailed previous review.  The service is worse and worse here.  We went in last week on Monday, as we had a rough day and were not able to get it together to make dinner.  Not even kidding, our dog died that afternoon and we had to take him to the Vet for ""after care"" and it was a horrible day, so we needed to get out of the house and have dinner and relax.   We went to Chili's.  We walked in and sat at a bar table.  For 5 minutes.  No one acknowledged us.  We moved to the bar top, thinking with a captive bartender on the other side of the counter we'd have better luck.  We did not.  After sitting at the bar for 5 more minutes, we left and went to Applebee's  This Chili's has the WORST SERVICE anywhere.   They have a few good burgers.  But not good enough to outdo the damage done by the horrible service.  If someone just stopped and said ""I will be right with you, so sorry for the wait"" we would have probably waited.  It was not that busy in there."
Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,239,2.0,6/17/2016,"First visit back since last year, service improved a bit but the food is still terrible.  Don't come to me telling me careful the plate is hot like it's cause of the food on the plate.  When in all actuality it was because you left it sitting out so long that you had to put the whole thing in the oven and end up drying everything out. Our family will not ever be returning, and would advise any others thinking of visiting to spend their money at either Outback or Macaroni Grill if you want so so food for the price you would pay at Chilis."
Roger S.,"Louisa, VA",233,7,5,1.0,7/3/2017,Today is my birthday and I decided to come to Chili's and have a nice dinner with my three friends. I had the SmokeHouse combo with the half rack of ribs and smoked cheese sausage. My corn was very overdone and mushy. Everything else was good
Cat C.,"San Angelo, TX",6,12,6,2.0,10/30/2016,"The food was fine - about a 3/5 on the scale of my Chili's experiences. Greasy chips, but otherwise mediocre. Worth the 2 for $22 tag. Here's the kicker - we sat at the table closest to where the staff liked to congregate, at the end of the bar nearest to the kitchen doors. Needless to say we overheard enough to make us never come back, including 1) a concerned bartender tell his manager that one of his plastered patrons was about to get behind the wheel only to be told condescendingly to get back to work; 2) a male server making snide comments about a customer at the bar; and my favorite: 3) OUR SERVER gesturing towards us when someone noticing her increasingly sour attitude asked ""what's wrong?""  My husband had to pay while I went to the car because I was too upset."
Jaime F.,"San Marcos, CA",5,186,3,3.0,12/5/2016,"Here are the positive points this this place: 1) Super important with kids - they have a Ziosk!  Well worth the buck you spend to have an adult conversation at dinner! 2) They served what we ordered, it came out timely, the food tastes like it should from Chili's.  Here is where they fall short: 1) Service 2) Service getting us an extra Ziosk. Shouldn't be that hard. Everyone else does it. But everyone seemed to forget that we asked for an extra one. Two kids = two Ziosks. Or one Ziosk = two unhappy parents.  3) When we get seated, we usually hope to get served drinks within the first half of our meal.  4) It normally takes a waiter to come over and great is to get our drinks.  Overall, we would return. We got our food in the end and had an extra cell phone with us for child #2. But, someone needs to work on extra service training."
Danny D.,"Richmond, VA",10,2,1,5.0,7/5/2017,Very good service and very good food I got a double bacon burger and my wife got a margarita pizza service was fast and responsive will be back. Thanks!
Dmitriy R.,"San Diego, CA",12,23,8,4.0,6/19/2017,"We come here often. Nice chill place.  Sometimes the line could be too long, though. The service is always good nevertheless."
kristy s.,"San Diego, CA",11,43,37,4.0,3/17/2017,Great service from Courtney. He took great care of my family and we loved his accent. The only downside was the long wait and not enough seating while waiting.  Thanks Courtney.
Oscar S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/31/2017,Leah provided great service and was constantly checking on if me and my girlfriend needed anything. I always come to chilis for dinner or lunch. This is my favorite location.
Alicia R.,"Vista, CA",282,117,168,4.0,8/22/2016,Great value for the food and restaurant and restroom always clean  . The food seems better in the vista location rather then Oceanside FYI. Service is good in both.
Darell R.,"Oceanside, CA",12,45,63,4.0,4/7/2016,"Chillies NEVER fails me, didn't stay too long had food ordered to go, but j did sit at the bar while my food was being made...had a double makers on the rocks at a pretty decent price...not sure if it was happy hour or not but i was DEFINITELY surprised when I got the ticket. As for what I ordered, a full order of their classic nachos which are pretty damn good, and a fajita plate which I don't recommend ordering Togo, not because of food quality or anything it's just that when you sit at the restaurant the fajita plate is presented on a sizzling flat iron plate and it's just a different experience. CHILLIES NEVER FAILS! Really hope I didn't just jinx that!!"
Cynthia B.,"Norwalk, CA",4,12,,5.0,4/19/2017,"stopping by after a long day at the zoo, my family and I were highly impressed with the service here! Brandon was excellent!!! Thank you for the speedy, attentive and friendly service!"
Christian U.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Chili's it's always good when you are on a trip, it's my first time in this one and by far the worst service I have ever received in a Chili's, took 20 minutes for me to go and ask the hostes if she can send our sever to the table, mind you I had to small children with me 7 and 9. It took another 10 minutes for our server to come and ask if we needed something to drink, really? 30 minutes to get drinks? The restaurant lacks of customer service and people to work there they seemed short handed that at 1 point I saw the cook outside serving food, the cook!! Really bad experience, I don't recommend this Chilis to anyone it maybe worth to drive another 10 or 15 miles for the next Chili's or maybe try Apple  bees. Forgot to mentioned that it was sons birthday and I asked to please get me a candle and they said sure we are going to sing for him, I thought it was great, still waiting for them to sing."
N T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,134,1,2.0,7/2/2017,"dirty tables, staff not helpful the bartender with the beard was awesome and that is the only reason I would return. He was curtious."
Aly M.,"Oceanside, CA",159,53,9,5.0,4/1/2017,"I ordered Chili's for pickup last time I was there, something I do not usually do. I wasn't completely sure how the whole system worked, but the website was informative. When I came to pickup the food, it was ready to go! The host was very kind and helpful, and made sure that I had everything that I needed!"
Laisce M.,"San Diego, CA",359,1,,1.0,4/23/2017,"This chilis was horrible. They refused to serve me a drink because I'm black. They used a lame ass excuse to arm as if it were justified. In all actuality they didn't want to serve me because I am who I am. It's sad that I have to endure such racism when when in all actuality all I wanted wanted was a nice meal and drink. I was under the impression that this was 2017 and not 1960, when it was ok to not serve me based on the color of my skin & not the green money I was willing to pay."
Cynthis A.,"Oceanside, CA",7,18,1,1.0,12/7/2016,"The manager needs to get relieved from his position. The customer service is terrible and food cooked there really shows that there no chefs in that restaurant. I blame the manager of lack of judgement and hiring too many women who lack class. Hire males, I bet they will do a better job then these girls who work there."
paula p.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,17,,5.0,10/27/2017,"We spent the day at LEGOLAND and headed into the local Chili's since the kiddos and hubby wanted burgers. Chili's has some of the BEST burgers anywhere, seriously and I am not a big burger fan. So the hostess seated us immediately with no wait at all on a Saturday night at prime dinner time. Our server (Alexa) was by far the best server I've ever had in my 49 years of life, including 5 star Zagat restaurants. Not only did she apologize which was completely not necessary for a 5 minute wait to take our drink orders, she sent the manager to apologize to us for the delay, gave us a 10% discount on our meal, gave us free chips, dip and queso and free dessert. OH MY GOD. The food was fresh, delicious, consistent with other chili's locations but the HUGE difference here is the service was OVER THE TOP. We had a table of 5 who had drinks, dinner, appetizers and dessert with THE BEST SERVICE EVER  for 64.00 with tax!!!!!"
Angelica W.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/7/2017,Horrible service! Waitress got our order wrong! Waited almost 1 hour to get it right. Waitress avoided us because I mentioned order was wrong. Manager came to bring order but was very short with us and also rude. I wanted to leave but my friend insisted we stay and finish our meal we paid for. This is definitely the last time I go there after returning after so long. I gave a chance and they proved me wrong. They continue to have bad service!!!!!
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,1.0,9/18/2016,"Not large group friendly. Started out with pandemonium with them trying to figure out how to split checks, and they cancelled my drink order in the mess. I should've just left.... By the time they figured out what they're doing and took orders, I'm not hungry. I wanted a drink and they screwed that up. And all the good the app does me, they couldn't ""check me in"". Chili's is usually hit and missbut mostly a hit, but not this location. This one was a miss, a cluster miss."
William L.,"Sun City, CA",0,8,2,1.0,9/18/2016,Would give no stars if possible worst service I have ever had at chilies for any location couldn't get order right took forever to get food out came with family and I got skipped for food order only good part of experience was one of our waitress JEN was very good lead waitress was very poor with customer service and manager had no customer service
