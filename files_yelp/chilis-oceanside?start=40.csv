Malia S.,"Cardiff, CA",79,30,5,1.0,2/11/2015,"All I wanted was a late night salad and my boyfriend wanted a steak. Instead he got a face full of spit by a hood-rat and scratched arms, and I almost got attacked by three bloodthirsty chicks w baggy pants and potty mouths once they saw me taking a picture of the crime scene in action. Let's just say we walked up at the wrong moment. (Go see the picture I posted. That's him in red trying to dodge their gestures of hate and violence towards each other as he's stuck in the crossfire).  Now, I know it's not the restaurants fault for the woopty-doos of their patrons, but it did sorta put us out because no girlfriend likes another girls scratches on their boyfriend (even if he was trying to calm the situation while being stuck in the doorway) and the police boxed his truck in while arresting them all keeping us stuck there for 30 minutes longer than we had hoped to stay. Normally this would be a situation in which the manger would come up to us at the to-go stand and comp the salad or steak for the physical inconvience of being assaulted but he didn't. We never saw him/her. The staff working there was nice and we all shared some ""woo-dude"" stories, but no dinner comp. My boyfriend even asked.  Next time I'll dress more appropriately with brass knuckles and long dark roots before I go get my salad and bring a bunch of friends."
Imtiaz K.,"Oceanside, CA",2,7,1,5.0,6/1/2016,"My wife and I had dinner tonight at this location. Kayla was waiting our table. Although it was Kayla's first day on the job, she did an absolutely professional job. She suggested what we order when we told her what we like. Chili's made a wise decision by hiring Kayla to its staff. My wife and I wish her the best Imtiaz Khan"
Savanna C.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",93,1,,1.0,9/11/2016,"ZERO STARS! This was by far the WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I left with my husband following me out as I burst into tears in the parking lot! When we arrived. As soon as we walked in we noticed a full restaurant and a 2 year old child standing ON a bar chair AT THE BAR--Where no one under 18 is allowed to sit. After waiting about 20 minutes a young host/ busser finally greeted and seated us and I asked him why the family was being allowed to sit at the bar with their child sitting on the seat. He said he would forward the complaint the manager and he sat us at my request ""Far away from that uncomfortable situation."" After we ordered our food and it came wrong. The manager walked over and apologized for the mistakes on my order. I told him that the mistakes on the food was fine but why has he not done anything about the law being broken at the bar. He replied by saying first that I was wrong and that it did not happen. Then he changed his story and said he watched them and she never put her baby down. After telling him that I had complained when I came in and taken a picture as well he changed his tune. Then he claimed ignorance to the law - stating ""I'm not from here"" -I didn't know a minor couldn't stand at the bar top. Then, he said he talked to them and they said "" We're not hurting or bothering anyone."" ( EXCEPT THAT- IT IS ILLEGAL!) Because I'm sure all the people at the bar appreciated drinking alcohol in the presence of an infant- an infant not being watched and about to fall off a bar stool.Then he asked me to explain to him what I would do.( LIKE THAT MATTERS !BECAUSE I WORK THERE RIGHT?? ) He then said he talked to his general manager and the General Manager did not care. This is where he left it. THAT THE GENERAL MANAGER IGNORES THE LAW. He had argued with me about this and wouldn't leave our table. My husband had to ask him to leave. When I went back to my food it was cold after having this stupid conversation. So now my food was wrong and cold. He heard me complaining loudly about my food being cold and he came and comp'd the order. All the while PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND WAS COVERAGE OF THE TWIN TOWERS FALLING This was my only day off and my only chance to have dinner with my husband this week.  THIS IS NOT A FAMILY RESTAURANT!!!!!"
Rhomel D.,"Oceanside, CA",802,364,82,4.0,1/18/2015,"Can I get a hallelujah!! Just when you think this place couldn't get any better, they just did. New revamped menu and their service was much more better compared to my previous review. I sat at the bar area and was greeted by Julio our server. His upbeat energy was definitely noticeable and b.c. of that, I could only compare to the remaining of my time there. Everything off their new menu was making my gf and I a long time to make a decision, but we were definitely hungry! Finally, we made a tough decision and ordered the pork carnitas and shrimp  fajitas, and the turkey avocado burger. When we got our order, they screwed it up and gave me chicken instead of my carnitas but Julio was quick to see the mistake and I got to keep the extra:) everything tasted great! The only thing I would complain about was not being able to scarf it all down that moment...but who doesn't like left overs!?!  Overall, service was excellent and I want to thank our server Julio for making it a great experience. I recommend you guys checking out their new menu and giving it a shot, you'll be happy that you did;)"
Katie S.,"Oceanside, CA",42,20,,5.0,5/18/2017,"This is our go to Chili's location. I love that when we go here we never leave disappointed. The restaurant is always clean, staff is friendly, and orders accurate & yummy. Love the Texas cheese fries! Love that you can get quite a bit of food for a good price here. And the margaritas are always delicious. Keep up the good work."
Lydia G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,64,,1.0,10/28/2016,"This review isn't necessarily for chilis the company. We all know how the food is at this chain restaurant. Decent. Not the best but good for a family dinner to satisfy everyone. But the particular location should be avoided if you value your health and cleanliness. My family came here for dinner. My son had to use the restroom so my dad took him. While my father was waiting for my son to finished he witnessed a cook come in and go to the bathroom then walk out. WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS. He was immediately disgusted and spoke to the manager. The manager blew the situation off and was like ""oh you must be talking about the Caucasian guy"" as if this guy has been a problem already. Please if you wan chilis the one in vista village isn't that much further down the road. And if anyone can direct me to the health department to make a formal complaint please message me."
John F.,"Irvine, CA",6,80,89,3.0,7/19/2015,"Pretty good service,  but omg . ..the portions of my wings were so small. Corporate nickel and dime us to death . Check out this tiny portion of my wings.  I'll think twice before I go to another chili's ."
Maddie M.,"San Diego, CA",396,249,655,4.0,9/17/2014,"Friday afternoon in the bar area wasn't crowded at all. Somewhat rather relaxing. I came here per request of my mother because she was craving their Southwest Chicken Salad. I was in a bit of a different mood, but made the best of it! I decided to order the Shrimp Tacos and since I've eaten at Chilis numerous times, I feel like they lack in the flavor department, so I asked the waitress if by any chance the chef could make a side of mango salsa to go with my tacos! My shrimp tacos weren't too bad, but the mango salsa definitely AMPED up the flavor on them making them one of my favorite foods to eat there! Customer service was also much better than my last experience as my waitress and the chef didn't mind my little extra order!"
Sanaja J.,"Oceanside, CA",13,1,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Came here tonight with my daughters and I would have to     say that this is the worst service we had at chilis. First was margaritas we got the 2 for $35 and we ordered virgin margaritas and they didn't give us the shakers.  They put them in a regular glass and didn't give us the shakers. When confronted about it we were told that chilis changed their glasses. Although we new that wasn't true because we have had a previous visit and the cups were the same. Then our appetizers came and that was fine. Dinner came and I was cutting my daughters steak up and as she ate a long hard white (object) looked like an worm but it didn't move. You couldn't cut it with a knife. When we confronted the waiter Brittany and Shawn (the manager) they stated that it was just fat. The skillet mash potatoes came on a plate and not a skillet. Finally we got dessert, we got the salted caramel molten and instead of putting that salted caramel they put cinnamon and sugar. When I confronted the waiter Brittany she argued that that's how it came. I pointed to the picture and explained that we had it before. She still tried to argue with me and I told her that no that's not how it comes. She then admitted that the chefs didn't prep the salted caramel for the topping. I asked her if she could go  and get the correct topping. We cut into the molten and we found out that the molten wasn't hot enough for the caramel to flow out. We love chilis but this has been the worst service we ever had."
Ryan D.,"San Marcos, CA",17,16,,5.0,2/19/2016,"Sometimes you don't want real Mexican food, you want the American manufactured kind. Man!!! This is exactly what I was craving this afternoon. The quesadilla was buttery and crisp and the beef classic nachos are amazing.  Super glad we chose to come here this afternoon, EXACTLY what I needed."
Terry H.,"Oceanside, CA",4,43,124,3.0,9/1/2014,"Came with my daughter. We shared the free happy hour chips and salsa and had the enchilada soup. Then the 2 for $20 dinner. As usual, the food was as expected, corporate tasty. I had the Cajun chicken. A bit bland but not bad. Bread was burnt. She had the chicken tenders they were very good.  The bad: We were basically ignored for 20 minutes until I got the bartender to call a server. Poor girl was working both sides of the restaurant. But that's not my problem. We never got a refill on our chips and salsa and had to flag her down for drinks.  Now the gross: I opened the menu and it was wet. And had chunks of food in it. Figured I would get another one. Same thing. Wet with chunks of food. Nasty and really gross."
Jorge J.,"Oceanside, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/1/2017,"We have visited Chili's at least once month for the last 2 years or so! My family and I always get excellent service and the food is always great! We never have any complaints!! I am not sure why they don't get better reviews!! I give them 5 stars!! They deserve it! Chili's, thank you for your excellent quality customer service and you delicious food! Will keep visiting as long as we are still in Cali!!! Recommended!!!"
R P.,"San Clemente, CA",0,9,1,2.0,9/28/2016,It's average. I mean its Chili's. They don't have very many options.. They honestly need more. The bottomless Chips & Salsa are literally the best thing. & the skillet cookie. If you're looking for whatever food with not so many options but want chips and salsa.. come here!
Daniel Y.,"Oceanside, CA",118,24,25,1.0,8/31/2016,Had lunch at Chili's today. Ordered a flatbread well done. came back not well done. Service was terrible . Tea tasted like water
Gigi D.,"Carlsbad, CA",19,9,10,4.0,2/28/2016,Food was good - service was quick - efficient - and the atmosphere is family friendly. Great place to stop when you're on a budget and in a rush. Came in hungry - leaving satisfied.
Laurie B.,"Vista, CA",216,208,4090,5.0,9/4/2015,Service was excellent. Sat at the bar ordered our drinks and food. Came out in a decent amount of time. They have the 2 for $20 deal it includes appetizer and 2 main entrees listed on the menu. Totally worth it. Bartentender Kimmy made an amazing pineapple vodka drink just the way I make it at home. Super strong.  Our go to place if we're in the area.
Gary T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,106,7,3.0,8/5/2016,"Food was good, but the service wasn't! Waitress was slow and didn't put some of our food in or it just didn't come. Had to wait forever for the dessert to come, thought she had ended her shift and just went home. Finally it came. Food that didn't shop up did on the bill! Really?"
Hannah D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/31/2016,"The food here is okay, but very salty! Always makes me feel sick afterward, could be because im pregnant but not normally does food ever make me feel this  sick. The last two servers we had were sweet amd friendly but never checked up on our table either time. Servers always seem to need to be flagged down. Other than that, Chilis has been kind of mediocre in my last visits. Hopefully it gets better"
Robert J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",36,39,18,4.0,2/26/2016,"As mentioned in prior reviews, this place is a go-to for dinner dates with me and the kids.  We came here last night, and our server was Alexa.  I have had some pretty average service here as of late, and didn't expect tonight to go any different.  I was wrong.   Alexa's style of table service was truly a breath of fresh air.   Courteous: Check. Attentive: Check  Quick and timely: check From the first bite of the meal to the obligatory final offer for dessert, She was beyond impressive.  Some servers are not used to working with kids, and she had that in spades.  Instead of staggering the water with the chocolate milk (my kid is a drink-it-all-now-as-soon-as-I-get-it kid)  She brought he water and milk out at the same time.  in all my years of trying to figure out how to slow this process, the water threw off my daughter.  It was the first time that food service was able to change our dining experience in a positive manner, just by the rhythm of the items coming out.  It sounds stupid.  But it made a big deal when she had chocolate milk left over, and wasn't asking for either another one to be ordered, or some of whatever I was drinking.  Anyways. Then the cheese ball incident.  Somehow, the wings I ordered got the wrong sauce on them.  It happens.  This was remedied immediately, (see what I am saying? Crazy), with the plate returning with the correct items in under 90 seconds.  Damn.  You go girl.  In the kerfuffle of getting new food out, at some point out of my view, a frozen - uncooked, YES - cheeze buddy (cheese bites?) (not sure what they are called),  made its way into one of the dipping sauces.  just under the surface.  This plus wrong sauce, would have been game over.  But Again, IMMEDIATELY offered to remedy.  My reaction:  I ate it, therefore, it was on me.  Nothing left to fix.  She offered to replace, to comp, etc....her on the spot 'let me fix this NOW"" was so refreshing.  I remember when service USED to feel like this, and not in just the super fancy, ritzy places.  She is a dying breed of server:  ONE WHO TAKES PRIDE IN HER WORK.   Not sure where to go from here.  I think my bar just got re-set for every day dining service, and I am pretty sure that the rest of them are just waiting out there, ready to remind me she is a needle in a very large, food filled haystack.  Again Great Job, Alexa.   - RTJ"
Amanda O.,"Fair Oaks, CA",264,163,48,1.0,9/19/2015,"Ok seriously guys, get it together. This is my second time in this location ordering take out. I call in ahead of time both times and both times quote 10 minutes. I wait a good 15 minutes before walking in only to wait an additional 10 minutes minimum each time. This time, I actually wasn't even helped for a while. No one was working the to go counter. A manager finally came over which is cool. But it's not like he was overly nice or sorry for the wait. Both times I've been in here it hasn't been busy. Not even every table was full. I'll call it moderately busy. I'd much rather order macaroni grill and get 10x better service and quicker service than to go to chilis and wait again.  ----super frustrated----- As I am typing this I'm still waiting."
