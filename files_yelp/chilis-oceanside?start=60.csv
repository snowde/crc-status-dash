Brenda P.,"Oceanside, CA",122,39,26,3.0,6/6/2015,"So far so good.  Starting off with the triple dipper. Boneless wings fried pickles and southwestern egg rolls.  Boneless wings were ok. I recommend if you want wings go to wing stop. Fried pickles were good. The southwestern egg rolls were really good. As an appetizer dish I would give it 3.5 stars.   Main course quesadilla explosion  Wife said 3 stars. It was big and the quesadillas were thick. Chicken was a little salty for her taste.  The salad was ""fresh enough"" and a full rack of ribs.  So I am a rib snob and really hard on ribs.  These ribs were ok. Probably 2.5 stars and won't do them again if your in the mood for ribs this ain't the place for you and unfortunately I was.  Will be more adventurous next time.   Service. Hector made this place able for me to come back. Good server paid attention and acted in a timely manner."
Katheryn R.,"San Diego, CA",74,16,13,1.0,9/18/2016,"We've been here dozens of times. And nothing has ever stood out. It's Chilis, service is okay and food is acceptable. We came here today and our sever was attentive enough and friendly. She seemed very busy and because they have a iPad at the tables were you can view your bill I saw how much our bill was and left enough to cover it put a 30% tip. We were in the parking lot almost at our car when a manager came running out and yelled across the parking lot ""HEY! You guys need to pay your bill!"" Mortified I told him we left it on the table, then followed him inside to make sure it was still there. Since I did just leave it on the table, I suppose there was a possibility someone could have taken it. When we arrived at the table the money was sitting there, right where I had left it. And the manager just said ""Oh I'll let the server know."" No, sorry I yelled at you, sorry I gave everyone the impression you were trying to steal, sorry I made you come all the way back inside to shrug my shoulders and walk away. It will defiantly be the last time we walk into that Chilis."
C B.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,2,5.0,11/29/2015,I have visited this location twice and food has been great both times.  Most importantly they have great customer service. Both visits Mandy was our waitress and I was totally impressed with the level of service she provided. I will most definitely visit this location again.
Caroleann B.,"Oceanside, CA",457,576,3900,5.0,11/3/2012,"Today it was great service, and my food came with the changes I had requested at the time I placed my order.  It was tasty and fresh. It took a while to be greeted by a server, and the time the server came she told me the original server I was to have was busy, so she was stepping in.  Well, I must say she did an outstanding job.  Thanks for making my lunch pleasant."
Gabriela G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/15/2016,We had Jared as our waitress he was up set that we had come in the last hour open and the food was over cook I will not recommend this restaurant
Kara K.,"San Diego, CA",574,414,127,3.0,4/28/2014,"We are frequent visitors to Chillis's!  It's consistent and affordable.  They have great French fries and their sliders are tasty!  If you're watching calories they have some great lean chicken or fish options.  I am fan of their margaritas and of course diet coke ( not together of course).  My lady likes the El Presidente with salt!  Not much of a wait to sit most of the time except peak periods can get a bit busy.  Friendly servers.... Today must have been an off day in the kitchen- food took 25+ minutes to get to us... :( boo It's Chillis's.... It's chain, you get what the commercial says you will get!"
Archie A.,"Coronado, CA",338,378,1339,5.0,2/19/2012,"Yes, now that I am in Japan I can say I miss state side chips.  I enjoy meeting family and friends at this location, for some odd reason with the row of restaurants on this side of the freeway we end up here. The service is spot on and the food is fantastic. Happy hour is my primary  reason why I keep coming back for more."
Emmanuel D.,"Vista, CA",0,32,29,5.0,10/30/2015,"We were out for dinner and this place was wonderful for us. Good food, great prices. Christy gave us a great and friendly service."
Robert T.,"Oceanside, CA",22,127,48,4.0,4/24/2015,"Good for Chili's for keeping their ideas fresh. Bad for Chili's for getting rid of the awesome blossom years ago...yes, I'm still mad about it. Good lunch options.  The soup deal was great, and the soups taste great. Bad on takeout. Curbside is not good.  You have to walk in, and there are no signs telling you this or where to go.  And you may have to wait in a line like I did.   Good on service every time we go."
Erica B.,"Vista, CA",20,20,9,4.0,5/2/2014,"We try to enjoy our Fri night with a good hearty steak dinner..  When we were seated we completely became forgotten. We had to ask a server to find our server. She apologized and we understood they were busy. Since we were seated in her section we witnessed two larger parties being pampered by our server and we were left in the dark.  When she came the first time she took our full order because we were left alone long enough to decide everything we wanted to order.  The food took 45 minutes for a house salad and a two and a half minute per side steak (medium rare). The steak was unevenly cooked. In one tiny section it was medium rare, the rest ranged from fully cooked to a hint of medium. We had to ask a different server from the two we talked to for utensils. We stared at our food for a good minute.  We were so hungry we didn't accept their change. The manager came by and politely took a section of our bill off.  Overall we are not surprised and had a feeling it would happen.  That is the reason for the four stars.  Coming back for the cookie dessert. . . Yummy!"
Louise S.,"Oceanside, CA",8,25,6,2.0,4/10/2015,Service was below average & food was not worth what we had to pay. The pasta was dry & salty. Wish I could say I had a better experience.  I gave an 2nd star because the Chocolate Molten Lava cake was still pretty good.
Frank B.,"La Jolla, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2016,"The food's good, always new menu items....where's the service? I mean waitress do serve food,but rarely check in on you from time to time. Not  clearing empty plates until last ,like as we are about to get up and leave type stuff! Cmon  man who does that!?! And last time I checked tips are mearly a suggestion and are earned not given as a common courtesy. #do work...don't let me get started with the hostess!#anoter one bites the dust!"
Robert G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2016,"This evening I along with my mother ex wife and grandson had dinner at Chilli's. The service and dinner was fine. As we were getting ready to leave my 9 year old grandson needed to use the restroom so I went with him and waited next to his stall. A few minutes passed and a man came out of the second stall wearing a red apron folded over at his waist as this was happening a second man wearing a Chilli's shirt entered the restroom, the first man gave him a head nod and walked out WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!!!  When the second man finished using the urinal as he was  washing his hands I asked him if the guy who had just left worked there and he said ""I didn't see anyone who works here"". I went out and asked to speak with a manager and a few minutes later a man who identified himself as Sean came up to me and I told him what I had just witnessed and he asked me if the guy was a caucasian man when I said yes, he said ""I think I know who it is"". How would he know who he is? Evidently this wasn't the first time this has happened.  He said he would go ask him if he had just used the bathroom. This illegal behavior that should not be tolerated by this establishment. And I will be calling Chilli's Corporate Office tomorrow morning to voice my displeasure. I will never be back. I gave them one star because zero stars is not an option."
Nina B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,69,13,4.0,8/10/2016,"Came here with my two daughter's. One ordered a kid's quesadilla meal and the other, a kid's cheese pizza meal. They said everything was great. The food came out quick and hot. I ordered the taco trio with beans and loaded mashed potatoes. They brought out rice instead. But they told me to keep the rice and they still brought me out the mashed potatoes. Everything was fresh and good. I'd come back! Great food and fast service."
Justin G.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/5/2014,"I love chilis until I came to this one. I waited about 20 mins to be seated when there were 6 tables open. I asked if they were holding the tables and they said no. Managers excuse is that they didn't have enough servers so they rather have us wait in the front then wait at a table. Makes no sense. First of all, get more damn servers. Especially on a football Sunday. Second of all, nobody wants to wait in the front. Just sit people down please!  This place needs to get their act together. Terrible service. DO NOT come to this chilis!!"
Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",204,252,320,4.0,5/21/2013,"On average, I find myself eating at this restaurant at least once a month. With summer approaching, I'll probably see me and my family in there 2 or 3 times a month and I'll explain why. Why do I return time and time again? The food's pretty tasty and the prices don't make my wallet ache.With this chain, I'm a creature of habit, I tend to always order the Big Mouth Bites, which I can share with my picky eater of a 2 year old. 4 sliders and a fair heap of fries and fried onion strips -don't forget the cup of ranch! The 2/$20 deal is super (in terms of amount of food and price) if you've got a buddy, honey, or date to go halves with you Shoot, you could just have an extreme appetite, the deal will satiate your hunger and not break the bank . Of course, Chilis being known for it's ribs, you'll want to check out that sweet portion of the menu! So the reason for my increased future visits is that Chili's offers Happy Hour. Sit in the bar during Happy Hour time(s) and enjoy cheap eats ($2.99-4.99) and drinks. The margaritas are delicious, especially the Tropical Sunrise and if you'd like to walk away a little wobbly, try El Niño margarita! During Happy Hour, I believe you'll only get a deal on the Tropical Sunrise and one other margarita, but hey, a drink's a drink and at a lowered price, you can't go wrong. In addition, Chili's-To-Go has never failed my family and they just now added Tablet/iPad menus to their tables which I think is pretty darn innovative. Order your desserts, look through specials, play games (well, for $0.99 a game...), pay your bill, and print your receipt! It says you can call your waitress/waiter from your table as well, but I was too apprehensive to try that feature."
Renee M.,"San Diego, CA",82,381,255,2.0,12/5/2013,"Chilis, oh Chilis... The food will always be decent bar food. Two sliders and fries for $5 happy hours is fantastic, and they are so yummy. But having one server serve the WHOLE bar during happy hour is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Maybe someone called off, who knows, but she could have said that she would do the best she could and things might be a little slower, or at least grab someone from the dinning area to help out.  When we asked for the bill my friends and I all had our cards ready. She placed them down and we put our cards right on top, yet she didn't take them. She made us wait another ten minutes which makes no sense once again... That is one of my biggest dining pet peeves. I don't understand why she didn't take our checks. Whatever. I will come back but it won't be often. You know you're going to have crappy service at these kinds of places... It's expected and I know that now."
Marco K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,11,,2.0,3/16/2016,"I usually like Chili's food but this is almost not edible. I don't know if the cook is in love or sleeping but you just can't over-salt food like this and not notice it. Not just one of the items but almost all if them.  Don't come here to get your chili's favorites, you'll stop loving them here."
Sarah L.,"San Diego, CA",586,49,42,1.0,10/9/2015,"So, the Chili's Headquarters emailed me apologizing for the bad service...and said they would mail me some gift certificates. Few days later I received two gift certificates in the mail...and I kid you not, they were for $10.00! Basically they are only giving me enough money for, ONE meal. Chili's is operating on a high level of LAME. Thanks a lot....Chili's....."
RD H.,"Oceanside, CA",2,89,92,5.0,1/25/2016,"We love the variety,  prompt friendly service (Ashley is awesome) and great location! They have more choices on the dessert menu than most places. The appetizers can be a meal,  or take half of your entree home for tomorrow. And we keep running into our friends!  Everyone likes it here"
