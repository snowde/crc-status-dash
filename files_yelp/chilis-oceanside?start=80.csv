Troll B.,"San Diego, CA",9,79,38,2.0,2/3/2016,My Lemonade Was Watery.. I ordered the Fajita Trio and never got my refried beans and rice... Got got napkins and had to wait forever for dessert.
Bob J.,"Oceanside, CA",109,382,34,3.0,12/10/2014,"Pretty decent Chili's I prefer it somewhat over the one in Vista, but just not enough to give it 4 stars.  3.49 stars is about right,"
Claire B.,"Escondido, CA",20,45,7,4.0,8/24/2014,"I recently came to this Chili's after work for happy hour. My friend and I sat at the bar and had a great time chatting with the friendly bartender and other guests who were sitting by us. Chili's has an awesome happy hour. Great prices on the margaritas (which are delicious!) and FREE chips and salsa. Their salsa is so good!! They accidentally punched in one of our items wrong, but the bartender realized as soon as he brought the wrong item out and the manager brought the correct item only about 2 minutes later! Great service! I work at the wax center in the same shopping center so I'm sure I'll be back after work soon!"
Dineal C.,"Oceanside, CA",103,41,32,3.0,8/20/2015,Last time we went the food seemed incredibly salty. Normally we love it but this last time - not so great. Could have just been an off day for the cook. But the deserts are always on point.
Jeysol R.,"Oceanside, CA",6,4,1,1.0,8/22/2015,I was really looking forward to eating here but things didn't turn out so great. We ordered an appetizer (wings) nd 30 minutes later our food arrives and no appetizer. Food wasn't even great for the.time that we waited for. I ordered the little burgers. The bacon tasted old and my husband ordered the steak. Then we were ready to pay they had the wrong machine thing on our table. Anyways that is probably the last time we will be going there.
Taylor M.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",17,53,1,1.0,6/6/2015,Came here for ToGo so we could get my son home quickly. Were quoted 15 minutes and 45 minutes later we got our food which had obviously been sitting under the heating lamps for some time. My husband asked the hostess where our food was and she had completely forgotten him and the name on the food. I've done this job. I realize it gets busy but a 45 minute wait for to go is ridiculous. We didn't order anything special.
Black X.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,692,14,1.0,4/14/2014,Chilis has gone to shit. Period. Haven't enjoyed a meal here since 1989.  17 year old bitchy server serving food with attitude. Not fun. The dinner salad had lettuce harvested in 1985 back when Doc and Marty were in the thick of it... That sounds about right. PS. The food at Chilis encourages massive fart attacks. So be sure to protect your family with gas masks before indulging in their shit fuck food.
Lily K.,"San Clemente, CA",0,12,1,1.0,7/10/2016,Do not waste your time or money on this horrible food or service. Not all chilis are bad. This one is just TERRIBLE.
Byron B.,"Bandera, TX",20,34,8,5.0,6/15/2014,"The reason for the 5 star rating is simple. We all know Chilis isn't some unique and cool place, but the service has always been on point. We take our 3  year old and sit at a booth in the bar area every time. The new table kiosks are a life saver. My daughter can play the kid games and my wife and I can have a real conversation and enjoy good margaritas and cold beer. Look, it's a corporate place blah blah blah, but we have had great service and they have huge ice cold beers on tap. Our server the last 3 times has been China, and she rocks it every time! Yeah, this place used to suck, but they obviously knew that and worked hard to change some major things. The Shrimp Ceasar Salad goes great with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Yeah, I can walk into one of those cool hipster places, but those places are rarely consistent and don't always have great service due to the ""I am so cool, you have no idea"" factor...and frankly, we are over that bullchit. If you like big ass cold beers and good margaritas that are affordable, a place that is family friendly, and good food selection, then head on over. You won't be disappointed. Ask for China if you can!"
Katie A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/12/2015,"Today I took my son to Chili's for lunch.  All was well until it came time to leave and pay the bill.  I handed our server my credit card and ID (military).  It took some time, but eventually a different server returned with both with a message from Chili's manager:  Chili's would honor the military discount this time, but to please remember in the future that the discount was for active duty members only.   The encounter was very rude.  I was shocked.  I wasn't looking for a discount, simply trying to verify my identity.  I was insulted and felt anger. When shopping or dining, I show my military ID because I am proud of the service my husband does for our country (he is currently active duty, 12 years).  Then I thought about the spouses to the servicemen and women of our armed forces.  To say that they, we, don't serve is a slap in the face.  We choose not put down roots by moving every few years, are left behind when our loved ones deploy, are separated from our spouses for long periods time, and live with the hope that our husbands and wives return to us safely.   To the manager at Chili's that couldn't be bothered to look me in the eye to explain a policy for a discount that I didn't even ask for:  You're welcome that my family serves to protect you daily.  You can keep your food and your discounts, but you lose my patronage."
Traci J.,"San Diego, CA",40,133,,4.0,9/7/2015,Slow service and cold food... We told our server and she told management who spoke to us but it was dead when we arrived. They got my grandpas order wrong and forgot my uncles onions on his burger we won't be back for awhile. The hostess was very nice and so was the rest of the staff
Shaun C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",124,53,98,5.0,2/9/2013,"Went here tonight with a date and had a great experience. For me, Chili's is one of those neutral type of places where you know there will be plenty on the menu to choose from and there will be something decent for everyone. Tonight was no different. Both of us have somewhat special dietary requirements (he's on a serious clean eating/guten free/etc etc kick and I've had bariatric surgery), but we both were able to have our orders easily modified to accomodate us.  As expected for a Friday night, the place was super packed and there was a 25 min wait time. The parking sucked and I had to park quite a distance away from the restaurant. We had the pleasure of being served by an awesome waitress named Alyssa. She was bubbly, playful and patient with our many requests.  I had the grilled chicken salad and my date had the fajita trio. Despite the full restaurant, the food came fairly quickly and everything was amazingly good. Definitely hit the spot!  I would recommend this place for families, dates, and groups."
Kevin B.,"Oceanside, CA",1,48,7,1.0,10/11/2015,"This place is horrible, they sat us real close to another group and 20min later no service, we left very hungry and angry, DO NOT GO THERE"
Robert H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",269,285,720,3.0,5/12/2014,"It's with sadness that I have to update my review. After having such great experiences with both Service and Food, it seems the new experience has worn off.  Christine is no longer there :( and since she has left we have not found a replacement server that has given us the level of high quality service as her. So much to the point as we only go here as a take out restaurant. What we dislike about the take out side is we are required to pay 79cents now for extra salsa with our chips and salsa... Have you seen the bag of chips they give you and the extremely small salsa container? It's not even a possibility to eat chips and salsa because you run out of salsa 15 chips in. What's even funnier is that if I were to sit down not only do I get unlimited salsa but I also get unlimited chips....  Recently we came in and decided let's sit not in the bar but the dining room. Our waitress was decent. She checked on us and made sure everyone around us was taken care of. The only fault this time was our chicken. Under cooked. They did make it right but by the time it came back out of course mine was practically finished.  Overall this place has moved to being middle of the run and average where average is becoming acceptable.. .... New City and New Chances. After having several disappointments with Chili's in other areas in Orange County & LA County we were reluctant to try another. But with our New City we figured lets give it a chance. When coming into the bar we were able to find seating at a table top. We first noticed the new kiosk tablet at the table. Immediately we started playing with it like little kids we are. Then our server came up to us introduced herself as Christine and was on point all night. She went over the easy to use tablet, which was so easy to reorder our drinks. Later on in the night the Manager Conrad came over pleasantly introduced himself and continued with the great customer service. Although this time around we hadn't ordered entrees only drinks, appetizers and dessert. Everything about this experience was worth coming back for the to try the food. It's people like Christine and Conrad that make coming to a new town an easy transition. Not to mention the entire staff that walked by or were in sight were extremely friendly. Well done...."
Julie W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/20/2015,"The service is terrible, decided to give it another try..today no one would seat us!!  3 employees looked at us when we asked about seating, the guy said you can seat yourself in the bar !! And walked away!! We did not want to sit in the bar after our last terrible experience !! Will not go here again"
Janice C.,"Oceanside, CA",3,10,,1.0,2/17/2015,My steak looks like they micro waved it.  When I sent it back I watched them talk crap about me.  They were so indignant that it was just a badly cooked meal.  I know for sure I will have spit on my food.  DONT GO HERE JUST BAD
Stephanie L.,"Oceanside, CA",227,25,3,4.0,3/3/2015,"My favorite place to go when I'm craving a steak. The 2 for $20 is a personal favorite. Their Texas cheese fries are always to die for! The 6 oz. sirloin with mashed potatoes and broccoli, even better. I love their strawberry daquiri and strawberry lemonade. One of my favorite local food joints when I decide to eat out."
John H.,"San Diego, CA",22,4,,2.0,8/9/2014,"Chilis has really gone down hill.  I used to really like this chain.  Good food and good service. Haven't been here in a while.  I now know why.  This chain feel like they are still trapped in the 90s.  Irrelevant was the word that came to mind. We were actually going to the new Buffalo Wild Wings that opened next door, but the line was out the door and a 1 hour wait.  So we decided to go to Chilis.  Got seated right away.  That was the first indicator, the place was half empty on a Friday night at 7pm. The service was slow, and the food was average.  Nothing great to report.   The kicker was the ipad like device that was on the table.  Had the menu electronically, had games for the kids, etc...Not a bad touch but felt more like someone placing a flat panel tv in your grandma's house to make the house feel modern.  Just doesn't go. When I got the bill they charged me .99 for use of the tablet my 3 year old was playing with.  It's not the money, it's the principle....nickel and dime me for a value add at the table. I wish this place well, but they are like Hooters....outdated and missing the mark. They have officially ""jumped the shark."""
Catherine E.,"Oceanside, CA",1,5,1,5.0,9/25/2015,"I love the air conditioning when I come here They have the BEST servers Julio,Amanda,Cynthia and Bethany. Love when air on full blast"
B. B.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,4,1.0,7/1/2015,"Worst service ever, no wonder the place was empty at lunchtime. Plenty of staff on hand but no one seemed to be paying attention to the customers. Took 1 1/2 hrs for lunch even when our server knew we had to get back to work. When we finally got our food it was cold.  Bad mistake,  won't be back."
