Peter K.,"Provo, UT",5,42,60,3.0,7/21/2017,"I'm giving this Chili's establishment three stars.  First off I ordered my food online through the chilis app. And I was told it would be half an hour wait. I didn't care because I knew it was busy especially being a weekend and late night. I ordered myself chicken strip with fries, and my sister got a vegan burger with a side of extra fries. The processes of ordering online was really easy and simple. You can even customize your order to how you want it!  When I got the text message that my food was ready. I made my way to chilis. I parked in the area where ""pick up only"". I made my way into the restaurant. I waited roughly 10 mins to be helped. You think if a worker saw you they would stop and ask if I've been helped? Nope that didn't happen. I had to ask and was told by the waiter he would come back with the person who was suppose to ring me up.  Finally after 20 mins of waiting they brought my food out and paid for it. When I got home and opened up the plates of food I ordered I was so shocked to find out that the extra side of fries that I ordered was so little. (Due to my sister eating the fries right away I couldn't take a picture.) But the amount of fries on the plate shouldn't be 5.00 extra!? It was my fault for not checking the plates of food.  Also another thing it's seems like all the co-workers didn't to care to work as a team, but rather state ""oh that's not my job!"" Their professionalism lacks big time. Ji would just rather go to another chilies."
Sulema C.,"Geneva, Orem, UT",56,16,5,5.0,1/5/2018,Loved not having to wait in line as long by using their stand in line option through the app! The food was great and our waiter Allen S was awesome!
Richard H.,"Graham, WA",325,1203,2707,4.0,5/8/2017,"Had dinner here tonight, and was very pleased with it, we got the 2 for $22 special they had, soI went with a Chili, which was very good, and for the entree went with a Mango-Chile Tilapia  - which was spicier than I like it, but still pretty good! I went with the local Hefeweizen option they had also. My wife went with the Nacho's (the sauce with it was very good!) and she got the Margarita Grilled Chicken (I think) which the chicken was very tender! And for drink a Watermelon Margarita. I would most certainly come back to a Chilis and would recommend this location!"
Shayla G.,"Oxnard, CA",59,12,8,2.0,12/27/2017,"It's been a few years since I've came to chili's and it wasn't all that great.. I was so excited to try the street corn and it didn't taste like street corn at all, they used a Cajun spice on top and added lime, not to mention the corn was so soggy. It just really didn't taste good. And they were out of about 3 different dishes so I finally had to settle for a sandwich that was mediocre, I'll only come back for beers"
Brady E.,"Provo, UT",373,87,21,4.0,6/9/2017,"Crowded (which is usually a good indicator). Fast order-to-eat time (always good). Delicious food (you'd hope so). It's a huge franchise, and you have to go in knowing that you're gonna not get the same experience you might get if you went to somewhere locally owned and made.  Still, good place to eat."
Aubrey U.,"Orem, UT",0,2,4,1.0,1/1/2018,"I wanted to order to go, so I went online and every time I tried adding an item to my cart, it would crash on me and say my session expired and reload the page. I did this twice before giving up and downloading the mobile app.... which did the exact same thing to me. I finally decided to call in my order. It was ready on time, the girl who rung me up was friendly. But I get home and there is a plethora of problems with my order. My burgers have no mayonnaise (when I ordered and paid for extra). I ordered beef nachos (which were about 5 dollars more than regular bachos), NO BEEF. And I didn't get my side of pico with them either. The only part they got correct was my mashed potatoes. So I paid $9 for literally 6 chips with cheese which I could have just as easily done myself. Not to mention 40% of the cheese on them is burned to a crisp so it's going straight into the trash. Awful to go service, would NEVER do it again."
Brooklyn B.,"Orem, UT",106,40,3,4.0,6/1/2017,"I went to chilies tonight with a few girlfriends, we where craving the chips and salsa!! (They are delicious!) We had a waitress named Lindsay and she was great!! I can see how it would be annoying to a waitress to have 3 girls come in and spend $5 total but she treated us with great service!!"
Brett B.,"Provo, UT",0,4,,1.0,4/25/2017,"Had dinner tonight.  It might be a stretch to say that we saw our waiter twice.  On the menu in big bold letters it says CRISPY CHICKEN. It was soggy...and cold.  The mexican bowl was small and way over priced and the southwestern salad had twice the dressing it should've had.  Since we never saw our waiter we couldn't tell him. Finally, after waiting way too long we paid and left. Our waiter beat us out of the door as he must have gone home.  We won't have to worry about this again as we're done. Won't be back. It seems as though Chili's might have changed ownership because what was once a great place is now pretty average (as measured by our last 4 experiences).  Don't waste your time or your money."
Sara P.,"Provo, UT",238,233,88,3.0,5/31/2016,"I came here with my in laws and some family from out of town on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. The wait staff was pretty cool! Everyone has personality here, I love that. It doesn't feel so ""corporate"" when the staff is chill. The food was pretty good, if you love spicy, try their chipotle ribs! Appetizers were delicious and hot. Our food came out about 10 minutes later! Not bad for a table of 7! Since this was my first time, I'd like to say I'll be back!"
Jessica T.,"Orem, UT",0,2,,5.0,11/15/2017,"I went this location last night, picking up a to go order with gift cards. I was a little short on cash and the manager gave me excellent customer service! As well as the take out girl! I would most definitely recommend coming to this location just for the awesome staff! The delicious food is a plus! Thank you so much for your kindness!"
Ryan H.,"Provo, UT",1,6,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"K this has happened several times this restaurant, and the entire franchise- they're literally horrible. Somehow the bread sandwiches were soggy (3 sandwiches- all the same kind). Then, they made the burgers taste like fish and the ones that didn't taste like fish tasted like saw dust. After taking 3 bites 3 of us were forced to send the burgers back while not asking for another. Needless to say most of us went home hungry. Following, my ribs barely had any meat on them and zero flavor. The food was expensive, and gross if possible I'd give it zero stars- to anyone who is thinking of dining here run, run as fast as you can."
William K.,"Laie, HI",11,24,2,4.0,6/17/2017,"My wife and I go here about once a week. Love this place. We've gone every week for the past year and half, food is always good, and service is usually always good. I believe they just recently had a change in servers, and the service has been way slower and a lot less attentive since then. Once that changes, my rating will go back up to a 5-stat"
Bryan A.,"Herriman, UT",613,61,109,2.0,12/3/2016,"We were severely disappointed in our visit to this location tonight. Granted they were very busy and seemed to have an abundance of large parties and perhaps that contributed , however this is very disappointing. Not only did too of the seven orders not come out , but my ordered sides we're not available. The manager came out and offered me a replacement to which I agreed to a cup of corn which was then brought out ice cold. LOL. Hardly what I would call making amends. I would probably give this location another chance based upon the friendliness of the staff but I would definitely steer away if it was on a weekend night"
Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",162,429,81,3.0,5/7/2015,"We came here after my Mom's graduation at BYU.  After sitting and watching a line slowly progress I was ready to eat.  The place we planned on going to was sold out, so we ended up at Chili's. I've been ordering the triple dipper here since the beginning of time.  You get to pick 3 appetizers for around the price of any other entree.  The southwest egg rolls are fantastic, the boneless wings are okay, and the cheese curds I got were awful.  You can pick from other things as well, but definitely get the egg rolls as one of your 3. I had a watermelon lemonade with the meal that was okay as well.  Skillet queso makes an excellent appetizer. All in all, nothing that I will go back for anytime soon, but if you find yourself forced to go to Chili's, maybe this will help you."
Kepler R.,"Rexburg, ID",3,4,,3.0,11/5/2016,"A group of three of us came here and as far as service goes it was quick and friendly. We got chips and salsa though and a handful of the chips weren't fried so they were soggy. Also, we got a molten cake that was not very good and just super spongey."
Kaylee H.,"Springville, UT",70,3,,2.0,10/19/2016,"The service was great! But the food was honestly the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I order the steak and chicken fajita, and the meat was disgusting. The steak was so burned it was black, it looked and tasted like the meat was old and had been pre-made and then microwaved after a couple hours of sitting there. The meat was so tough I couldn't even chew it. I would advise not getting anything that could be pre-made, only order something that they will have to make fresh for you like chicken tenders."
Eric D.,"Provo, UT",98,35,2,4.0,9/6/2016,Love chili's. Though they are a chain I find their variety and selection to be great. I never get bored here.
Felipe D.,"Orem, UT",5,16,7,2.0,2/12/2016,"Come back to the new chillies with high hopes. And once again disapointed . ordered a well done stake and it had a lot of pink. Not sure if they pumped my order out to get a to go order out of the way. But when I got home and saw the pink... Went straight to the trash.  When you order from here, be very  specific"
Mirel H.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/1/2016,"I love coming here! Service never disappoints, which is great because it's a huge part of the experience when dining out. Hostesses and servers are always nice, friendly, and super chill. Sometimes the manager will go around making sure customers are enjoying their meals. Food is pretty good too, can't say it's top notch but quality, flavor, and price is definitely reasonable for a chain restaurant."
I. L.,"Lehi, UT",3,56,1,4.0,10/19/2015,"I have, in the past, frequently made the mistake of putting Chili's and Applebee's in the same category: all-around chain restaurants that serve the American spectrum from Tex-Mex to steak and fries. And while their menus and their atmospheres bear out the comparison, there are some definite differences between them, which my wife and I discovered after receiving a gift card to Chili's. See, I hadn't been to Chili's in many years (perhaps never) before a few weeks ago. But in the interest of using our gift card before we forgot about it, we ate there twice within the course of a month. Here's the biggest difference: the food at Applebee's is entirely what you'd expect. Some items are a disappointment, some are tasty, and all are slightly overpriced. The food at Chili's, on the other hand, is consistently above par and reasonably priced. I was impressed both times we ate there. On the first occasion, I got the bacon burger (because how can anyone ruin a bacon burger?). It came with an abundant helping of fries. It was miles ahead of fast food in every department: the bun was toasted, the bacon was thick, and the vegetables had a great presence. Even the pickles were a surprise: firm, garlic-toned and crunchy, with a balance of cucumber and vinegar that I've only ever tasted in one other restaurant (and in the occasional homemade pickle). It was totally delicious. I should warn you, though, that like most burgers this one isn't so great after a night in the fridge. This most recent time around I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. Frankly, I wasn't expecting them to taste like real honey or chipotle peppers. I mean, when was the last time either of those flavors was fairly represented in a restaurant meal? I was shocked when the crispers tasted strongly of both. Apparently someone at Chili's got the memo: ""honey"" and ""chipotle"" aren't just buzzwords that sound good on a menu, they're actual ingredients. The crispers were plentiful and yummy and paired well with ranch dressing. Our only complaints had to do with the service. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer, and the waiter came back 10 minutes later to tell us they were out. I don't know how you run out of onion rings at 6 PM. I understand that forecasting demand is difficult, but at the very least we should have been informed of the situation before we ordered. Aside from that, there were three of us there and we all ordered items that qualified for the ""2 for $20"" deal. A skilled waiter would have billed the two most expensive items under the deal in order to give us the most favorable price on our check. Instead, our waiter billed the two cheapest items under the deal, leaving the third item at full price. I called her out on the mistake and, after some resistance, she fixed the check (saving us a little under $5). A small issue, but one that a more well-trained waitstaff could have avoided. Overall, I recommend coming here for the (excellent) food, and bringing a good attitude in case the service flounders, which it probably will."
Freddy Z.,"Orem, UT",36,7,15,4.0,2/13/2016,"Today my me and my wife ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, although I did also order a house salad since that wasn't an option on the 2 for 20. We chose the guacamole, salsa, and chips. I forgot how good the guacamole, salsa, and chips are, seriously as far as a restaurant goes I don't know if Chilie's or Rubio's has better guacamole!( I may have to do a tie breaker between chilie's and Rubio's guac.) My wife said the guacamole that I make is better, but I think she was just trying to be nice.  As far as our entrees goes, I ordered the chili mango tilapia and my wife ordered the sirloin.  The mango chili sauce has a stronger kick than I was expecting my tongue was actually burning, and I LIKED IT!  Very well evenly seasoned. My wife's sirloin looked very much as excepted. She said it was really good. The only thing about the menu is you can't change anything on each dish, but it does say that on the menu but the sides that they came with was a really good combination.  Over all it was a very good experience.  Side note: the Diet Coke was exceptionally good today for some reason."
Jacki M.,"Twin Falls, ID",0,32,3,3.0,11/27/2016,"My experience lined right up with the overall 3 star rating for this location.  Not good, not bad..Food was actually pretty great overall but they forgot to give me plastic to go silverware, which sucks when you aren't taking your food home and need it.  They usually ask or put it in.  My salad was squished into a tiny to go container, which was strange.  My tiny dessert was in a HUGE container, which was also strange.  Food was done on time and the guy that checked me out was very nice.  Minor things..We will come again!"
James F.,"Irvine, CA",353,89,97,3.0,3/28/2014,"Alright so there are some good things about Chili's that I do have to note: 1) The 2 for $20 deal is a pretty good deal. You get to choose two different entrees AND you get one appetizer. My wife and I got the Chicken Fajitas and the 6 oz. steak with broccoli and mash potatoes. With an appetizer and two meals our total was $21.57. And we left completely full. So Chili's is good bane for your buck. The Chicken Fajitas were pretty good. Some of the onions were a little overcooked, but what can you do. 2) The bottomless chips and are pretty good. Fresh baked chips, yum. Seriously, this was my favorite part of our meal. These chips are freshly baked, thin, and crispy. I liked how salty they were as well. Entrees: The food is good, but nothing to write home about.  Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive. I like lemons with my water and our lady made sure that we always had a bowl full on our table (+1 for her)"
Whitni P.,"Orangevale, CA",26,42,7,4.0,6/17/2015,"We really enjoy Chili's. This location seems to always be friendly and the food is always good. We love getting the different dips for chips with salsa. Tonight we tried the white spinach queso and it was good, nothing extremely special, though. Their skillet mashed potatoes are amazing. The sweet and smoky was delicious. The tex mex pairing is alright. Wouldn't recommend the soft taco. The tostada and chicken quesadilla are pretty good. I switched the rice for the potatoes- which was a great choice. The black beans are pretty good too. We were planning on getting dessert but we were way to full. I wish they would bring back the cinnamon molten cake because I have never had a better dessert."
Alexandra S.,"Syracuse, NY",11,167,4,4.0,2/25/2016,"I don't know why people go here expecting 5 star food. It's good food but not freaking Ruth Chris. Anyway, this location's service is slower than average but it's still good. Great for groups especially! The food is good. I haven't had a problem with my orders at this location, but I will say sometimes the meat is dry. Also, I don't like the fajitas here."
Zach L.,"Orem, UT",260,237,166,1.0,11/7/2013,"Same as any Appleby's--awful.  This is overpriced, soulless, corporate food at its best.  It's like some little Ashton Kutcher wannabes playing chef are sitting in a kitchen somewhere trying to figure out how to punk every potential patron that crosses their path.  And punk us they do.  After we leave, we wonder why we paid so much for TV dinners.  I've been here more than 6 times (once on my own; the other times because my group insisted), and every time I wonder if food can get any less fresh.   Answer?  It can--it's called Appleby's.  But this place, to me, is a close second."
G T.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,3,,2.0,5/6/2016,"Went there this evening and ordered the fajitas.  They came out and I was surprised to not see red bell pepper but figured it would be fine.   I took a bite and was disappointed that there was very little seasoning on the fajita mix.   The chicken was really bland.   We called over our waiter who recommended the fajitas to inquire if it was missing seasoning, he informed us it was not.   I told him it was very bland, he then told me he was not a fan of it either.   I then told him he probably shouldn't recommend it then.   Not sure I'll be going back after this experience."
Mac C.,"Decatur, GA",77,5,,5.0,3/14/2016,"Seriously guys, I love Chili's. Great appetizers, chips and salsa to go, cool lamps. Excellent."
Carter B.,"Lindon, UT",1,8,,5.0,9/13/2016,"Awesome service, grub was tasty.  Little kiosk thing on the table was cool and made check out very fast and efficient."
Becca H.,"Laie, HI",234,8,7,3.0,1/6/2015,Great place for date night. This location is right in between two colleges making the 2 for $20 menu affordable. The food is average for a chain and the service is hit or miss. Love that it is open till late though!
Charles S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",928,1298,1079,3.0,6/28/2013,"It's a Chili's. They're typically 3-star establishments and this one is no different. They serve up GIGANTIC portions of pre-made, never fresh, food that's loaded with salt and tastes great! I always feel bloated and a little sick after a meal here, but that might be because of the two giant beers and the bottomless chips and salsa, which make me almost too full before my meal even arrives. They have a full bar, which is fantastic considering that it's in Utah County."
Mack R.,"Provo, UT",0,17,,4.0,1/18/2016,This is a favorite of ours. We love the South Western Egg rolls and their other appatizers.
Chet F.,"Anaheim, CA",66,11,2,5.0,1/6/2016,Vary great service!! Food was amazing and the service we got was even better. We had a waitress named Sarah that would make sure our drinks were full all the time with out any interruption and Took our order by memory and didn't miss a thing. She never missed a beat. Are food was The perfect temperature and everything we asked for.
Hazel C.,"Orem, UT",28,4,,1.0,12/23/2015,Wtf is the point of ordering takeout if I just have to wait for you to start cooking it once I get there? Poor form Chili's.
Ashley L.,"Santa Ana, CA",13,18,2,1.0,6/16/2015,"Terrible service. Stood waiting for several minutes while the hostesses chatted before they finally asked how many in our party. We were told the wait was 15 minutes. 30 minutes later, a party of the same size that came in after us got seated. Told the hostesses, waited 5 more minutes, and just gave up."
Kasey Y.,"Menifee, CA",276,100,125,1.0,2/23/2014,"My LEAST favorite restaurant on earth. I can't believe people still eat at places like this. You pay a premium for sub-par, non-fresh food. We live in a day where restaurant can source local, fresh ingredients and Chili's is still just warming up frozen food.  Aside from the food, the place is not clean. More than a few times I've had silverware, plates, or cups with dried food still on them. It's amazing. If I could give zero stars, I would."
Cody D.,"Orem, UT",7,19,,5.0,5/18/2015,"Chili's is our go to place after softball! We love the service and the food. They have almost the greatest chips and salsa and guacamole. The rest of the food is good as well. If you are up for a fun atmosphere where you can get some good quick food, I would HIGHLY recommend this place."
Aj W.,"Orem, UT",35,73,9,1.0,12/15/2014,Why do the servers hate it when I come in and only order margaritas and guacamole? They treat me so rude!! But a guy named mark that's a manager made it up to us. So I will give the place 2.5 stars.
Jason S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",48,57,,1.0,9/8/2013,The service was sub-par to say the best. My server was worried about a bigger party and another waitress was taking up his slack. She was great.  The ribs were the worst I have ever had. They tasted like they used ketchup in place of bbq sauce. I will not be coming back to this location again.
J C.,"McKinleyville, CA",1,12,2,1.0,7/1/2015,"Chili's food is mediocre, at best. The kitchen, at the Orem location, has a problem with speed and timing, when the restaurant gets busy - we have been served cold food... and also had only half of our table served while we waited for the kitchen to complete the remainder of our order. But... what really sets this chain restaurant apart from other local dining establishments is their incredibly HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We had a party of 11, and they refused to try to accommodate a table of that size at 9:00 PM on a Tuesday evening. (There were plenty of open tables, but they insisted on splitting us.) The server was blunt about being annoyed by the fact that she got stuck with a table of ""kids."" (The table seated 2 adults, and four 15-16 year-olds.) I have been a server - in my experience, even teenagers are aware of how to tip... and, especially when they are accompanied by adults! It is completely inappropriate to vocalize that you are annoyed that you have to take care of your guests WHEN THAT IS YOUR JOB! The management was equally as rude when the issue was addressed. A gentleman approached our table, and... when he got defensive, he literally commented ""if you don't like my tone, you can just leave."" Well played, Manager-sir - we did leave, and will not be returning to Chili's in Orem. I recommend finding a different casual restaurant, in the area - DO NOT EAT AT CHILI'S!! The staff is rude & does not appreciate your business!"
