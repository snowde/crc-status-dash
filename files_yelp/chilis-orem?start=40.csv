Felipe Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",372,449,48,4.0,7/6/2012,"As long as I lived in Provo, i went to Chili's once a week, or every two weeks (I'm not even joking) I know their whole menu, even when they change it, I can still own it and maybe even work as a server... their 2 for 20 menu is the shit. It has all you need from Chili's at a great price for two. When picking the appetizer in the 2 for 20, always go for the chips and salsa, a smarter idea is get chips and guac (same price, get the whole chips&salsa + GUAC) and obviously go for the Honey Chipotle chicken crispers. Delish. the corn is okay, but very well seasoned, and the fries are to the die for usually, and the chicken with that sauce... MMMM... and the crunchiness.... AHH. im heading to Chili's now."
Mrs D.,"American Fork, UT",0,41,16,1.0,1/21/2015,"Arrived at 5pm.  No wait to be seated but took over an hour and a half to receive our food after ordering.  Many tables who arrived after our group of 6 came & left before we even received our food. FAILS Over one 1hr wait for our food Drinks were wrong Sides were wrong Asparagus was improperly blanched on every plate Dressings were, you got it WRONG Wilty lettuce Gross old veggies as sides The server even tried to pull a switcheroo on one of the ladies who had ordered a specialty drink Weird chewy tendons in everyone's chicken Full dinner salads were tiny and I would daresay I would have received more for my bang for my buck ordering a salad at Wendy's Server dumped on his buser or assistant even making up a 'grunt' name for the assistant. This dining experience at Orem Chili's truly receives ZERO 's  It was so bad that it was basically pointless and bothering to ask them to fix anything.  We simply paid and left."
Steven K.,"Orem, UT",206,2,,3.0,7/15/2014,"There is nothing wrong with the food at all, this is your typical chilies experience. There are also several large flat screens around for viewing sports events. The service however, has been unacceptably slow. I waited 12 minutes for my drink to get to the table. Other servers have been looking at me, then just looking away so they could go back to standing around and doing nothing."
Scott G.,"Mentone, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/28/2016,"Yooooo. I got mad diarrhea right now cuz. Like literally, I'm posting this as I'm on my porcelain throne. Been here bout half hour. I think ma girl startin to think I be textin some other hos or somethin as an excuse cuz I've been in here so long. Ay but she came close to the door and she knew I wasn't playing. This food no joke! This is crazy. I had dat new prime rib burrito. I ain't gonna lie it was pretty tasty, I wolfed that biz down like I was leadin the pack you feel me? And I had some of that girly freckled lemonade drank. I wasn't around nobody so it's cool I was just postin. All that was cool too. I was feelin it for a good minute. Yo I didn't even get home when I start feeling the gurgles. Sound like my stomach be rapping to chewbaca or somethin. It hit me hardddd. I ain't never had bowel movements like this. Yo the last time there was a movement this serious, brothas like me starting making some changes around here, ya feel me?"
Jonathan D.,"Springville, UT",140,24,31,5.0,1/4/2012,"I love Chili's.  They always have food I enjoy.  The chips and salsa are good, the chips and queso are tasty, the burgers are great, fajitas are yummy, quesadillas mmmmm."
Richard S.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,2,,1.0,4/5/2015,"This used to be a great place to eat. I haven't been there in a couple of years but if there food has slipped this far I haven't missed anything.     My wife and I both had beef and chicken fajitas.  I am not making this up, there were 5 pieces of beef approx. 1"" square x 1/4 "" thick and 3 pieces of chicken about the size of a women's little finger, a pile of onions and a little green pepper.  The beef chunks were inedible, my wife and I both chewed and chewed then had to pull it out of our mouths and put it on the plate.  Out of 10 pieces none could be swallowed, I left the last piece.  If any of you have ever eaten bear meat, this beef was more stringy that that, if you haven't, just imagine it.  The condiments were neatly arranged in little sacrament cups with small amounts of salsa, avocado, jalapeños, sour cream,  shredded cheese, and cilantro.  My mother-in-laws soup was watery without taste, and my sister had a salad.  $60+ later we left.  This is only the second time I have ever complained about a restaurant.  The service was good and she got a good tip.  I'll never go back"
Josh G.,"Provo, UT",140,5,,4.0,11/15/2012,Awesome. My wife and I get the Chili's to go thing all the time and love it. Food is pretty great.
Justin G.,"Lindon, UT",16,42,,4.0,3/21/2013,"Chili's is an awesome chain dinner restaurant. Fair prices, full flavor, and well-prepared meals.  Nothing extraordinary, but if you're looking for good food at a decent price, chili's is the place for you."
Stephanie B.,"Red Bluff, CA",0,52,,1.0,4/1/2013,"We went here on a Sunday, and were ignored after we placed our order.  We saw the waiter walk past us several times and look at us, without asking if we needed anything.  After 45 minutes of waiting for our food to be served....we walked out.  Will never go back again!   There was a table in which a large party was seated...but this was the ONLY table our server was paying any attention to....TIP FISHER!!!"
Jessica C.,"Matthews Beach, Seattle, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2012,"The jalepeno burger was pretty tasty, but the service was super slow (not to mention the fact that my fiance and I were ignored once we placed our order, and the servers seemed really confused about what food went to what table) and the restaurant was incredibly dirty. It seemed like the floor hadn't been swept since that morning which isn't exactly appealing. It's just not worth the money, and definitely not a place to go on dates."
Mike B.,"Somerville, MA",2,70,2,4.0,1/30/2012,"Since I had a good experience here last summer, I decided to come back, with my wife this time. We got the two meals for $20 deal which turned out to be a really good deal! An appetizer and two entrees for $20. She got the sirloin which she really enjoyed and it came with a side of mashed potatoes which was surprisingly good. I got the crispy honey-chipotle chicken crispers which were way good! Just thinking about them makes me hungry! Anyway, I'd say this place is surprisingly good for this kind of a chain."
Jessie M.,"San Diego, CA",331,125,67,2.0,5/15/2012,I don't really like the food there. Every time I go (cause of friends) I try something new to see if they can change my mind about the food but I always end up disappointed. I never go there by choice. I just feel like their food is a waste of my money and horrible way to kill my appetite.
Jeff C.,"Orem, UT",115,230,37,2.0,11/21/2011,I have been a bunch of times and it's very average. Chips and queso are great. But most of the other food is average to poor. They change the menu options  a lot and the burger bites are one thing I like. Good thing my friends paid for it. Not really worth your money. Many other good options around
R R.,"Orem, UT",0,25,2,1.0,6/11/2015,"The service is hit or miss. And the server(s) will bypass a pair of patrons for a much larger group every time. Must be for the chance of a larger tip. Our server would almost throw stuff at us while en-route to the larger group of customers. The food served is absolutely inconsistant. It is not prepared the same every time we visit the same exact restaurant. I don't understand it. Very frustrating. It appears there is a general manager and a manager of the kitchen, and the kitchen manager seems to ""care less"" about what complaints come it about the food. Depending on the time and day of the week, they're going to do whatever they want and the general manager, server, and customers can kiss off. At least that's my impression after talking to the GM and server. This store must be a problem because there are a lot of bad reviews. I guess most of the good reviews haven't been to a Chili's for quite awhile. I came here years ago with my sister and her husband. My sister ordered a green salad. The salad had a dead black fly under one of the leaves. When we told the server, he told the manager, and he offered to not charge us for the salad. WHAT??? These people have not changed for 30 years, at least at this particular location. So if you come here it may be a good experience, but 3 out of 4 times be prepared for a disappointing one. If you don't mind paying $40 for a meal for 2 and those odds then I guess I'm full of green pooh."
John K.,"Tulsa, OK",1,8,,1.0,6/6/2014,The food is crap the bar drinks are worse.....the family drags me here from time to time for desert.  That's about all Chilis is good for.
Shannon M.,"Burbank, CA",21,396,21,3.0,6/2/2010,"Alright. The service may be TERRIBLE here...but I just love the chili queso dip, enchilada soup, and the molten chocolate cake!  I don't compromise much in my life, but I will compromise slow service for my food cravings!"
Steph H.,"Orem, UT",0,4,2,5.0,3/15/2011,"Me and my Fiance always go to chili's, it's definitely our favorite place to eat. We go to Chili's for all our special events and especially our anniversary. The food is FANTASTIC!!! It always tastes great and we're always treated like royalty!  We both look forward to when we get the chance to go eat at Chili's!"
Celeste C.,"Bellevue, WA",35,224,5,3.0,3/27/2007,Never quick service. The food here was lame.   Let's just say we didn't go here a lot.
Mike M.,"Orem, UT",101,30,2,4.0,2/26/2011,Nice service ... good trip taking all my girls out .. we usually frequent the place
