Elena W.,"Ventura, CA",1,13,8,5.0,10/27/2017,We love the new portions and food. I hadn't been in a while. Glad we came back to give Chili's another chance. Drinks and service were awesome.
John R.,"Ventura, CA",12,10,4,1.0,1/6/2018,There for over a hour and a half wait for or food. Not even busy at the the time we were there. Food was sub par.
Heather K.,"Camarillo, CA",259,264,1638,3.0,3/6/2017,"Oooooooh, this is tough. I'm a solid 3.5 on my experience here. Fine dining? Not really. Nice fast food? Kinda close. Just don't know if I can eek out 4 stars.  I met some friends here who were celebrating. They ordered one of the specials (I didn't get the name of it bit did get a picture) and I ordered their Texas fries. My friends' food was delivered very quickly, it smelled delicious and was served hot. WIN. They both said the food was really good, except the jalapeño sausage (?) was VERY hot (their words). Corn was good, too.  My order came a bit later and I was surprised at how good it was, too. Hot. Melted cheese. Bacon bits. Pretty darn good and for the price it was about what I expected.  Service was basic. Very basic. Nothing made this trip spectacular or memorable, or makes me specifically want to eat here again. Very decent meal all around though."
Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1396,10421,3.0,3/14/2017,"I had an okay visit to this Chili's last week.  Good for them I'd forgotten about my previous review and the bad experience I had.  This time things were not so slow, service was good, I was able to visually locate the host stand immediately upon entering the restaurant, but my order wasn't right.  I asked for the Caribean salad without onions and with dressing on the side.  I got this, but they also removed the dried cranberries, the sesame seeds and did the cilantro on the side.  The salad was still good but it would have been much better with the dried berries & seeds on top like it should have had. When I noticed the oversight our server wasn't readily available to ask for these things so I just ate it as-served.   Our server was enthusiastic and had a great attitude.  Food was a little slow but not too bad and it was a busy dinner night.  Portions are big, food is decent quality and everything was hot and fresh this time.  I'd come back again."
Keven M.,"Oxnard, CA",8,4,,2.0,11/1/2017,"Chili's use to be good, but last time I ate there my old timer burger I got was just the patty the bun and a sliver of lettuce no tomato no onion nothing not even mustard or mayo. It feels as though the food quality has gone down I hope it gets better I use to like chili's now idk"
Leila M.,"Oxnard, CA",132,14,1,5.0,9/7/2017,Great server and service. They worked really well together. Prompt in bringing out food and drinks. Killer fajitas and enchiladas. Nice fresh thin chips and fresh guac. Lemonade is tasty too. Not too sweet.
John M.,"Signal Hill, CA",4,17,1,1.0,6/13/2017,This chilis is always a disaster. Tonight. My Family ordered chilis for dinner. We had Grubhub deliver. I've been ordering chilis for years. After several issues from missing food to the food that was ordered and burnt. Tonight's food was the worst food I've ever had. The boneless buffalo wings were so dry and over cooked that I have decided I will never come back to Chilis. ( we have ordered chilis 2-3 times a month for the past 2 years. This was the last straw. The food has gone so down hill. Stay away! It's not worth your trouble.
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1433,849,4285,3.0,1/4/2016,"I remember back then, while as a child... Coming to Chilis was super cool- it was definitely a nice upgrade from Sizzler's. Remembering how it was back then, it's nice because the food quality and overall vibe it's still very much the same as before as if they've stayed consistent and have even gotten better by adding on better and move food options. Although being corporate, Chilis has many options to satisfy the enchilada lover to the steak lover. I was surprised on my last visit at how many options they have added, that aren't necessarily the traditional dishes they are known for.  Chilis has a wonderful happy hour menu, so if you're thinking of a fun place for HH, Chilis is the place for you. They have new appetizers (please refer to my pics) that are always changing. I loved the loaded fries add steak, delicious! My hubs and I order a few rounds of their signature margarita; mine extra, extra spicy of course. The prime rib meat option for the fajitas was not thaaaaat great, if anything the meat was dry. On the other hand, the shrimp was juicy and had flavor. I'd have to say that the boneless loaded chicken appetizer was delicious, and not what they traditionally offer at Chilis, try it!  The service here is pretty standard. The servers provide just the right amount of customer service without being overly phony, that's nice.  There's a pretty huge, well-lit parking lot in front of the restaurant, so finding a parking spot shouldn't be a problem.  Am I returning customer? Sure, I would consider myself one... but I'm still on my journey to support small business and rep' for the many ma n' pop shops around town..."
Madison B.,"Ventura, CA",132,4,1,5.0,5/9/2017,"Great food, great service! Ask for Dell!  He'll make your experience that much better!"
Lizette M.,"Ventura, CA",91,38,36,3.0,3/12/2017,"Ordered the 2 for $22. We got 2 stakes and one stake was so tiny that I had to give my husband half of mine. The waitress was great she replaced the meal and made it as right as possible. Bummed that Chili's would even serve a teny tiny stake, with lots of fat."
Jasmine T.,"Honolulu, HI",37,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,I ordered pick up and followed the sign they set up in the to go area to see bartender for orders. I sat at the bar for 15 minutes and the bartender never acknowledged me. I had to stand at the front for a waiter to come and he brought my food. I've eaten at chili's my entire life and never had bad service until the blatant disrespect. I'll never eat here again.
A.J. C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,42,1,1.0,10/28/2016,"This afternoon, I stopped at Chili's Restaurant, located at 2221 North Rose Avenue, Oxnard, CA 93036, and I had an awful experience. I ordered a small salad, then I ordered a chicken fajita.  After several bites, I bit down and felt something in my mouth that was hard and non-food like.  I took the object out of my mouth, and found a thumb screw, measuring about an-inch-and-a-quarter.  What was a thumb screw doing in my fajita?  How could that possibly happen? Had I swallowed the screw, God knows what could have happened to me, or what type of surgery and recovery I narrowly escaped. Do not dine at Chili's Restaurant, because you never know what you may swallow there that is clearly not food. Stay away.  Please.  Now."
Mairani A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,1,5.0,8/20/2017,Food and service was great! We didn't have a long wait to get our food even though it was a Sunday afternoon and the staff was constantly checking to make sure we had everything we need!
Jeanessa L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Great service, Good food and even better HH prices! Will definitely be coming back to Chili's in Oxnard!"
Kristel M.,"Camarillo, CA",3,7,3,1.0,7/14/2017,"I had been here before and had a pleasant experience up until tonight. We ordered appetizers our entrees, and drinks. We got the appetizers after our entrees. The steal, we all ordered steak medium rare and we all got different temperatures. From raw to well done. The corn on cob was old and chewy. The meal alone took almost and hour to get to us. We asked to speak to a manager and he didn't take the time to come out and address the problem. He send the waiter instead to tell us he was sorry. Horrible experience and horrible food. Will never come to this place."
Mark M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",66,14,,1.0,4/8/2017,Took 3 hours from the time we sat down til the time we got our check. This service was so ridiculously slow. Took forever to get a refill.
Rosalie Z.,"Ventura, CA",47,5,,1.0,7/7/2017,I hate to be writing again! But we just love chilis food .. but some reason they keep messing up!! I don't know if you need to be under new management or you don't know nothing about customer service. We went yesterday to celebrate my birthday and my husband reminded them twice and still we didn't get anything. I understand it's not your policy to sing or celebrate but when a customer is requesting its up to management to make it A priority!!! Also my steak was not well cooked and my daughter pizza was burnt! And they of course argued with us about it!! It's just upsetting and disappointed .. I would like to see a change in service! This is ridiculous
Gaby M.,"Oxnard, CA",2,22,1,1.0,9/16/2017,I ordered a salad for a small gathering. I was soo excited but when I got to the party I noticed I did not get the dressing for the salad:( soo dissapointed
Elaine T.,"San Jose, CA",88,43,61,2.0,3/16/2017,Ordered online and came to pick it up 15 minutes after the time they said it would be ready since we got stuck in traffic... waitress had no idea where our food was and we waited an addition 20 mins for our order. Ridiculous.
Marlen P.,"Oxnard, CA",2,14,21,5.0,10/18/2016,This is my Go-To place for a quick lunch. It's not busy during lunch time and the service is fast.
Francesca R.,"Oxnard, CA",10,13,17,5.0,7/31/2016,"Happy hour all day on Sunday's!  I have a few staple favorites here at Chili's - honey chipotle chicken crispers - southwestern egg rolls - Patron margaritas  & the delectable buffalo chicken salad  I am signed up for their rewards program & received a free dessert email for my birthday a few days ago - I'm glad I chose to go today! Appetizers were cheap due to all day happy hour & tried the peach crumble as my free dessert. Absolutely delicious! I believe it's seasonal for summer, if you like cobblers & summer fruits it's a must try."
Darleene S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/21/2017,"I haven't been to your restaurant in about 6 months. It was always great food. I love your chicken crispers. I ordered them to go, when I got home and opened the box, what a disappointment! They looked and tasted like the frozen chicken crispers from banquet. What happen to the golden brown juicy crispers? WHY DID YOU CHANGE THEM? Spent money I assumed would be worth it.........?"
Ashley R.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",8,8,16,2.0,4/3/2016,"Me and my husband went for lunch this afternoon and we left feeling utterly disappointed. We got seated pretty quickly which felt like a good start but then we ordered our food. It took them an hour to get our food out to us. It is very hard to sit there hungry while everyone else's food passes you by.  I was trying to be patient. Maybe they're just taking their time to give us top notch food.  Nope. When our food got to us our order was completely wrong. There might have been a language barrier because English was not our waiters first language.  My husband order ribeye steak and fries and they brought him ribs and rice. Seriously. It would have been funny if we weren't so hungry already.  All that waiting only to get the wrong food.  So we tell them and they apologize, take it away and start on our new order. I got a bacon burger and that came with my husbands incorrect ribs. It was not great. The burger was dry and the fries were cold.  My husbands steak came as I finished my burger and it STILL has rice on the plate. At that point he was too hungry to care. The rice was bland and the steak was over cooked. Obviously rushed.  All around just a bad experience. We waited way too long for below average food."
Kaylee R.,"Ventura, CA",226,11,,5.0,2/22/2017,AWESOME SERVICE!!!!!! Great place to just hangout and get a drink with great food and deals!
Vivian N.,"Ventura, CA",475,495,1734,3.0,8/17/2014,"Chili's upgraded each of their dining table with these fancy little kiosk which probably means that they are doing well so good for them! The kiosk which they call ""ziosk"" allow you to order appetizers, reorder drinks, pay the bill, calculate tips for you, prints the receipt, offers unlimited games for 99c (bejeweled, fruit ninja, etc). Very fancy all together! In terms of food, I almost never stray from the unlimited soup and salad they have. During lunch 12-4pm, it's about 8 bucks but on weekends it's 10 bucks. One soup cup is 3ish and one bowl is 5 so prob worth it if you have an endless appetite for soups like me! My favorite is the chicken enchilada soup which comes with a lot of white chicken meat drenched Ina creamy sauce and shredded cheese (once again, not exactly wedding food diet)  My fiancé tried their trio fajita plate which came with chicken, steak, and shrimp on a sizzling plate. These also sound a tom better than they taste not that they don't taste good but damn that sizzling sound! Deceiving as heck! (15$) Lastly, get the watermelon margarita and you will not be disappointed! Why a three? Well it's a chain and aside from their soup and salad, nothing else special."
Jasmine R.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",98,136,76,3.0,4/16/2016,"They redesigned their menu for spring 2016, and the new menu options are pretty tasty looking. I tried the avocado sirloin, and to my surprise it was actually really tasty, but it was a bit more on the satire side. Also, apparently they have different avocado sirloins, which I didn't know,  and I unknowingly ordered the wrong one because they decided I picked one over the other... How, I don't know. Luckily, it was still good because I ate it anyways. Lol  The service is good, and on a Saturday night we really didn't have too long of a wait."
Mike F.,"Oxnard, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/26/2016,Not satisfied at all !!! It wasn't even busy the server didn't check on us!!my husband food was all burnt need better cooks
JosephNMichelle S.,"Oxnard, CA",2,26,54,4.0,6/13/2016,"Always get great service at this location! Love the 2 for $20 menu. You can't go wrong with thier burgers, they are always great. Try the western bbq burger!"
Lorena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,102,149,1.0,8/11/2016,"The worst kitchen service ever! We were there for over an hour and a half and all we ordered were two hamburgers. If I didn't have a gift card I would have left. In a brighter note, our trainee waiter was very nice and very apologetic about the kitchen wait."
Mauricio C.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,84,41,1.0,2/20/2016,"Describing my experience at this location is very triggering. How does a waiter who says he's swamped with work have time to sit at the bar with his friends and watch sports? I tried getting his attention to help me figure out why my food tasted like old dry cleaning rags. I don't know what rags taste like personally, but I imagine they taste like the stale tortillas they use for their tacos. The waiters seem to not care about you once you've been served since checking out happens at the table with their little computer pads.  I ordered the three pairing with quesadilla, taco, and enchilada. Three completely different foods and yet all the same disgusting flavor of sadness.  Such a sad experience."
Rosalinda V.,"Oxnard, CA",3,31,9,4.0,6/26/2016,"For a chain restaurant Chilli's is pretty great. The service i got around lunch hour the other day was great, drinks were always filled, server very attentive, and bathrooms clean."
Jonathan Q.,"Oxnard, CA",9,12,29,4.0,5/14/2015,"I haven't been here in so long! Thank God I'm back and I'm so happy to see this place is better than ever! Love the appetizer trio with the biter burgers and the egg roles and the boneless honey chipotle wing! Delicious!  For my entree I order a new mango burger which honestly I expected more flavor out it, it looked super good but a little bland, but I also got enchilada a taco and quesadillas which were pretty good but what made it awesome was the chicken enchilada!  My lady got a Cajun pasta which I believe was the best dish we had! Te shrimp made it even bomber! Anyways the device was outstanding and our server was amazing, she offer a lot of things which I loved and it made me feel like she knew me. Our food came out really fast which was awesome! Anyways love the place great environment to hang out and chill for a while!  5 stars for service and 3 stars for food"
Greg B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,55,3,1.0,7/14/2016,"I tried chilis again and yet again I was disappointed.  The food seems to get more average evrytime we try.  Also, again....almost a 2 hour wait and it WAS NOT  packed.  Very frustrating!"
K. S.,"Oxnard, CA",41,7,,2.0,11/3/2016,"I haven't been very impressed with this Chili's in the past, but they've done some remodeling and updating so I thought I'd give it another shot. I went there with a friend and we decided to try the fajitas. Still not impressed. The drinks we ordered were great. When the food came it was cold. The fajitas were not sizzling like I've seen others in the past. I had to send them back. It was just a disaster. Needless to say, I don't think we'll be going back there anytime soon."
Hashem N.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,15,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Last Saturday night, my wife and I went to this location on the way home from Solvang. It was our second time that we were there. Last time (though it has been a while) was ok. However, this time the service was really bad. We were seated without much waiting. Music was very loud and with people trying to talk loud to be heard, it was not a pleasant surroundings. The waitress took our order, and while waiting, we played with an IPad looking gizmo that each table had. You can look up menu, pay bills and play games on it while waiting for the food. There was a family next to us and someone there had a birthday. The staff came over and sang a very loud song. Not the usual BD song. They were so loud that a young boy at that table got scared and started to cry. Anyhow the waitress bought wine for my wife and coffee for me. Later the Santa Fe chicken salad arrived. It was spicy, but good.  However, the waitress never came back to refill my coffee, or ask if everything was ok. I had no water either. I ate my meal and waited while burning to see if anything was going to change. It did not. When we got the bill, we had two extra charges on our bill. One was for $0.99 for the game we played on the ""gizmo"". We missed a small print that said there is a charge. We also had a $7 and change charge for something  that we had not ordered. They took that one off, once we told the waitress. Maybe she was overworked. Regardless it was not a good dining experience. I won't be back to that location."
J H.,"Camarillo, CA",1,3,,1.0,5/13/2016,"The WORST dining experience I ever had. After being seated, it wasn't until about 15-20 minutes later we finally found a server. He took our drink and food orders and left and NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. Another 30 minutes later, no show by this idiot. NOT EVEN GLASSES OF WATER WE ASKED 30 MINUTES AGO. Horrible horrible experience. If I could rate 0 stars I would!"
Fresita A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,12,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"Well where should I start as we walked in the person who greeted us didn't greet us, all she said is I'll be right with u we got seated the food was delicious I can't complain but the worst was waiting for our check to pay!! We wanted to play through that ziosk but it was off! It couldn't turn on we literally sat there 20 mins or more we almost felt like walking out but because we out honest people we waited!!! 15 more mins until we had to wave to our server to get his attention! I don't think I'm coming back!!! I rather go where the servers go to check a few times!!"
S P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,70,10,5.0,8/23/2016,"Today was very busy. You could tell by the waiters moving quickly to serve their customers.  I don't know if they were understaffed or short handed but it was awesome service! I was very please with the service I received today around 12.45pm with my co-worker. Thank you Chili's, I will certainly keep coming back!"
Alyana M.,"Ventura, CA",0,12,6,1.0,12/18/2016,"I find it really sad when a waitress is trying to diffuse a situation and a manager comes over to make it 10x worse. I ordered the endless soup & salad. After a 10 minute wait & I still had no recieved the refill of my Sprite. I had about 1/3 bowl of soup left when i asked for another, the waitress declined citing the GM would not allow 2 bowls of soup to be on the table at once. (?) I asked a passing waitress to send over the GM. The GM Jesus came over and was extremely rude and did nothing but argue about how people dont pay for their soup. He acted as if I was asking for him to bring me something I wasnt entitled too as I ordered ENDLESS soup & salad. I then stated I still have yet to recieve my refill I asked for 10 minutes ago, in which he said ""well she is busy"". He refused to accept any sort of responsibility or apologize for the situation. Overall, was very dissapointed as I do go to this chili's frequently and have never been treated this way before. Also, other mangers I have encountered there solved any problems I had instead of acting as if I was inconveniencing them."
Kayluh D.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,31,7,3.0,5/29/2016,"Seated seated in a decent amount of time. Restaurant was clean. Our server was decent. My complaint here was that I ordered a side house salad, and asked if chicken could be added. I assumed an up charge for protein, I saw 2.00 up charges on other salad options, of which I had no problem with. Server NEVER said anything about an astronomical Sur charge. Never even mentioned a price or t. Received bill...my like 6$ salad became a TWELVE DOLLAR SALAD. I was up charged almost 6 dollars for chicken!!! 6$!? I would hope that the sever would have had the decency or TRAINING to inform customers about pricing options when they ask for something different than what was posted. A side house salad for near 12 dollars!? With that surprise coming only when going to pay the tab....ridiculous! ! I would have NOT asked for chicken , or ordered something else. Heck, I would've took a paired down size of chicken.  Was the salad good? Yes. I had no complaints.  My complaint here is being transparent with your customers on pricing, instead of making it hidden. Should I have asked? Probably. But seeing 2.00 up charges for protein,  I was assuming it would be along the lines of that. Just ludicrous."
