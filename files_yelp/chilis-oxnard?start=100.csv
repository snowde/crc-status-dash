Javier J.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,2,1.0,10/14/2013,"Worst service ever! It took them almost 10minutes to sit us down when their wasnt any people all... And when they did sit us down,it took them another 10 minutes to come and greet us!  And the service sucked! I was so surprised because we always ate their with no problem, but that is the last time ago!"
Gerry B.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",1,15,,1.0,10/26/2014,"Terribly slow service, order finally came and was wrong, and the food was so - so. $33 for a lunch for 2 that was a waste of time!"
Mike V.,"Oxnard, CA",37,58,,4.0,5/14/2010,"You know what?  I really like Chili's for some reason.  I was very surprised I liked this kind of cheesy family fun, but with happy hour, types of places i.e. TGIF, Applebees ect..This particular location is just like any other, so I will rate Chili's as a chain.  First off if you are lucky enough to stumble in there while they are running their 2 for $20 deal you are in heaven.  You get an appetizer (plenty enough for two) 2 entrees (you get to choose from a big list) and a desert (again plenty enough for two people).  Never have I been able to eat all of my meal when we get this, and I don't suspect I ever will.  They seem to run that promotion all the time too.  Place tends to get crowded and loud but the service is fast and usually friendly.  Very reasonable prices too!   Favorites: Big Mouth Bites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cheesy dip appetizer, I forget what they call it, but its great! BBQ chicken salad really good too.  P.S.  TGIF NEXT DOOR SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Way over priced for bad food!"
Ben S.,"Camarillo, CA",142,122,10,2.0,1/19/2010,"Went here with co-workers for lunch, and the place was pretty empty.  They have a nice lunch special that's essentially a knock-off of Olive Garden: bottomless soup and salad for $6.79. Overall, the food isn't really too bad for the price you're paying.  The soup was warm, not piping hot, so that was a disappointment on a rainy day.  Also, this lunch special is billed as the ""Express Lunch.""  Considering how slow our server was and how empty the restaurant was, the ""Express"" part of that lunch was vastly overrated. I don't regularly eat at Chili's, so I probably won't be back.  But for under 7 bucks before tax and tip, it's not too bad of a lunch.  I just prefer other types of food at non-chain restaurants."
Maura C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,5.0,11/1/2014,"We were staying in Ventura and stopped at this Chili's one of the nights on our way back to the hotel. I wish I knew our waiters names (we sat in the bar area), they were both wonderful and the food was great. I am never disappointed in Chili's food and this location was just as good."
Angel G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,1,3.0,10/16/2014,"I like how chilis upgraded now you dont have to wait for the waiter to pay, sometime they would take half an hr to give your receipt the food is great."
KaSushi M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/4/2012,"This Chili's is awesome. They have the best bartenders, and the most personable servers of any location that I've been to in this area. The Chicken Enchilada soup is great, the appetizers are well-sized, and the lunch specials are more than filling for the price. I always get a warm greeting when I walk in, I never wait too long for any kind of food, and the drinks are delicious (and strong). Just awesome."
Richie B.,"Ventura, CA",3,51,,4.0,8/23/2012,"Some of the best food you can get for less than $10 a plate. The portions are huge and they have some pretty good deals. I would give it 5 stars if the service wasn't so iffy. It's 50/50 whether or not you will get a good waiter/waitress. Some times they have attitudes, ignore you table, take 20+ minutes to run your bill, but overall that's expected at a low end restaurant like this. Just go in the afternoon or on off days because it gets way too loud and has too many screaming children."
Tammie R.,"Ventura, CA",75,17,10,4.0,3/6/2012,Great margaritas!!!  Once you become familiar with the staff they are great!  Great new food/promotions.  2 for $20 is financially helpful!
Kim M.,"Ventura, CA",5,129,,3.0,12/3/2009,"I've only been to Chili's twice that I can recall and I did enjoy the food.  It's not really anything special, but it was good. The portion size was too big for me... but that is pretty standard now-a-days; and their prices actually weren't bad.  The last time I was there was about a month ago and we had great service and great food. My boyfriend and I ordered that 2 for $20 deal which we got a nacho appetizer, two massive buffalo chicken sandwiches and these three dessert ""shooters"" - everything was good.  I would go back if I was in the area."
Kim B.,"Ventura, CA",9,21,15,2.0,4/20/2012,"Service was terrible. Some of us from work were actually going to eat at the place next door, but it was closed (due to a utility issue). Maybe Chli's couldn't handle the overflow. Our food took forever, but I think it took just as long to get the check paid. It was horrible. I give two stars because the food was good. If you are on a time crunch, stay away. The last three times service was slow.  This by far has been the worst. I probably will not go back."
Angelica P.,"National City, CA",75,52,15,2.0,1/16/2012,"Ive been to Chilis a few times. Its never been my first choice. I always seem to get dragged there because a group a friends decided to go there or I got a gift card. The ambiance, service, prices are good. The food is terrible. Greasy, bland.. They need to get some better cooks or something."
Jose R.,"Camarillo, CA",5,20,115,2.0,12/20/2013,"What happened to this place? They used to have good service!? The food was late, the waiter was forgetful, and the Crispy Chicken Tacos were chicken strips in a tortilla! Wtf? Really? Very disappointed. My 5 year old got his French Fry's as we were leaving, unacceptable! Oh and to those that will say ""he doesn't know what it's like to be a waiter"" I was for ten years and never gave service this bad, he made us reach for our plates, and I had to help him with taking the kids milks out his hand because the other was full!? Rookie? Maybe I'm being harsh, but would have loved to give him a 5 min crash course on how to make good money as waiter. It's really easy, your customers should never need anything, think ahead and give them your undivided attention. Don't try to take there order by memory then ask them to repeat it as you write it down, (yeah he did). I have a 3 strikes rule and that's strike 2 at this Chilli's. Probably my last time there. The only reason for two stars is there bar area happy hour is alright from time to time with co workers it's been ok, and the manager did come over and comp the chicken strips in a tortilla aka Crispy Chicken Tacos."
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,4.0,5/25/2009,"We used to be regulars here, coming here after church. Chili's is great. Not exactly the heathiest but portions are huuuuge! Especially the country fried steak. I like this place."
Andrew M.,"San Diego, CA",1683,346,600,5.0,1/6/2012,Consistently good food and the sangria margarita is freaking AWESOME!!!! It's what seriously brings be back each time
Paulie G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,65,,1.0,5/12/2012,"Please bear w/ me as I'm very analytical and believe that limited detail might not suffice. I had a rather multitude of problems last night at this location. Similarly, my guest and I were quite perplexed how things were handled as well. Quick version (store #588) turned into a business training and an unsolicited scolding from your Manager Julie Carpenter. In the beginning,  I clearly and politely told bartender Danielle, when we ordered, ""that I was not in a rush""! Drinks were fine...appetizers fine....yet meals were delivered way too fast! I felt pressured to finish the appetizers, so this is not good service attention to detail. Danielle removed my plate then both servers ignored us for a good 20 minutes. I had pushed the appetizer plate forward, showing we were finished, and then watched the poor service prevail. Both servers passed by multiple times...yet couldn't comprehend my dinner was waiting. Similarly that my guest was barely eating...as she was waiting for my dinner to arrive. When Danielle finally and disinterestedly showed up...I explained to her the problems. I was never vulgar....rude....or abrasive...thought provoking...YES!!! I'm there as the customer and shouldn't have to ask her to serve me...this is what I said. From that moment on...we were the plague.  Manager (Julie Carpenter) approached us in a very abrasive fashion and barked at me (paraphrasing) ""what did you do/say to my server? She's in the backroom crying?"" This was 25 minutes after the initial conflict. I spoke to Julie for probably 20-25 minutes....as she was QUITE accusational and said ""I'm the Mother here and those are my girls!!!!"" Why does this matter? There was so many comments that were exchanged during this session..I just can't type them all out! Julie remained very accusational...seemed more concerned w/ how hew staff's feelings were tarnished...and wasn't very concerned w/ me writing a negative review!  Later when asked for Julie to return...she refused. Both bartenders ignored us til later...and were in close proximity probably 20 times+++ 2nd bartender Erica thought they were giving us '10 out of 10' service??? Now... after a 20 minute session w/ their manager....mind you filling up waters and asking for another drink or napkin was like a root canal...I merely chimed in and said, ' more like a negative 5.' Sooooooo.....glutton for punishment....we stayed and did something unmentionable....ORDERED ANOTHER DRINK!!! Erica heard our version....made a decent attempt to counter the bad taste....and we closed up our tab. Erica said that Julie would NOT come out for 2nd visit....seemingly odd? And left over a 20% tip after being scolded and ignored....? Not to be discarded, but definitely a valid point, we watched half of the kitchen crew and bartenders remain in the backroom for over 5 minutes. Consoling an upset worker this way does what.....IGNORES YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! Especially when an opportunity to 'make things right' was suggested by me!!! So....I'm a HUGE fan of poor/indifferent service given by staff that exercises bad choices deserves retribution! The pen IS mightier at this point...and I think this establishment STILL doesn't understand what they did wrong and take the ownership for their errors!!! With that....I'd say a revenue loss of $300+ per month might make my review scar! This is what the service world has come to... get mad at your patrons when they complain....and seek false & gravely invalid comfort from your co-workers...who coincidentally deliver that same inferior service and attitude....sad sad sad!  Sometimes the real challenge is to make a bad service situation turn into a 'lifetime' customer....once Chili's Supervisors figure this out...please contact me!"
Josie G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/11/2014,So me and my husband and son went to chili's sunday. We waited 5 mins to be seated which was ok. But as soon as we got to our table our server took 15 minutes to come and greet us and ask us for our drinks. As soon as we order drinks we ordered chips and salsa. So 10 minutes pass and she brings us our drinks but no chips. So we figured they would be right out. Well we were wrong. She completley forgot about us . She took other peoples orderes and what really pissed me off was that a family that came in after us got there drinks faster and they got there chips before us. So 20 mins passed nnd we finally called her over and told her we r ready to order. Once we finished ordering. My husband asked were are our chips. She says oh i forgot. SHE FORGOT ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! it took 10 mins after we told her to get put chips. And another 30 mins to get our food. Well  when our  food came it was okaii. But to see familys come in after us get better treatment was really messed up. I didnt get the waiters name but she was really chubby and white. I feel like it was a racisim thing becuase we are mexican and she was white and the family she waited on was white and they got better service than we did. We are frequent customers but this was the first time we ever got treated so poorly.
Jason K.,"Lompoc, CA",1,4,,1.0,4/8/2013,"the service was bad, the food was barley okay and i just didn'f feel like i mattered at a person trying to buy food there"
Wendi M.,"Oxnard, CA",24,40,,2.0,3/7/2011,"I have been here many times but this is my first review... I have always liked Chili's in the past (especially the chips and salsa) but lately the quality and service have gone down hill. I came to eat here on 3/3/11 with my 2 boys for dinner and while I was waiting I told the hostess please can you tell my server it is my son's birthday, as I wanted it to be a surprise for him.... long story short... I was seated way in the back by the restrooms and opening to the kitchen, my server seemed like she was lost in another world, my rasberry ice tea tasted like plain ice tea, the 2 for $20 chicken fajitas had more peppers and onions than actual chicken, my younger son's kids pizza was undercooked and soggy looking....  so after eating we sat around for a while... waiting for the birthday hoorah, waited some more,  the bill came.....I paid it.  Then I was like, Ok I guess we are not getting a birthday hoorah afterall.. So as I was walking out I confronted the hostess and expressed my disappointment about this whole darn birthday thing.  Seriously her excuse was ""oh I'm sorry, I forgot to tell her"".... What kind of people are they hiring here!!  Is it too much to ask to sing happy freakin birthday to a 13yr old kid for crying out loud, are you that lazy at your hostess job that you couldn't relay a single sentence to the server.....  I knew I should've went somewhere else... Lesson learned!!"
Corey R.,"Oxnard, CA",13,17,,4.0,4/17/2011,"It seems like I'm in here at least a few times a year. I always look through the menu, not so much to decide what I want as much as to make sure my usual order is still on it. When walking in, there is usually a host to greet you and hold the door open. A hostess greets you and, in my experiences, usually seats me right away. If I happen to go during a rush, I don't think I've ever waited more than 20 minutes. The hosts and hostesses are always friendly and smiling, even when the customers are not so nice. The one or two times when I was there during a rush, service was a little slow all around, but I'd expect there to be some lag when every seat is occupied; the kitchen does not expand when there are more people dining. But during one of my normal visits the servers have been courteous and prompt. A few servers have even let us know not only their name, but also the name of the other servers who will be covering our table with them. Drinks tend to show up within 10-15 minutes after being seated. If an appetizer is ordered, it tends to arrive within another 5 minutes. A few minutes after the appetizer is finished the entrees arrive. The food is usually still steaming when it hits the table. I have had one or two times when I didn't need to wait for the food to cool before eating, but it was still hot enough for my liking. Overall, a consistently decent place to go for a meal that will fill you up without breaking the bank, as long as you don't terribly mind that this is a chain restaurant."
