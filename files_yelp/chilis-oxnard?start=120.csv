Andy V.,"Ventura, CA",97,30,2,3.0,1/29/2009,"OK...  Lets start of by saying a Chili's is a Chili's is a Chili's! You can go ANYWHERE, even Hell and eat at Chili's. They are all the same. Where they do differ though, is Service! We eat at this one ALLOT. My eldest daughter thinks Its the next best thing to Red Lobster or Hometown Buffet (hey shes seven!).At this Chili's we have had good service and bad food and great food and bad service. We have been through a few managers a bunch of wait persons, and many a ""give us another try "" gift cards. My wife is a complainer... a ""Johnny Letter"" if you will. Well last nite, we went to Chili's and we got the best service ever, Anywhere! Sarah was her name, and she was great!. Her personality was awesome, she is attentive and great with the kids. Very pretty too!. On our drive home after dinner we compared her to the service we got at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas... yea, we had a concierge for our meal and it was 2/3 more than the Chili's meal but the experience was as good....why? She enjoys her job and respects her place in someones dining experience. Thank You Sarah!"
