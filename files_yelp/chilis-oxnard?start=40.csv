Damaris G.,"Compton, CA",412,20,14,2.0,5/23/2016,"I'm gonna make this as simple as possible. Server, Casey took long to complete every part of our visit. Manager, Bill wasn't accommodating given our experience. My colleague and I were on a lunch break. After hearing that the ribs weren't fresh and they had ran out it would take 20 minutes for the special. We left on an empty stomach and our Togo trays and waiting forever for that. We asked to speak to a manager and he came to bring us the incorrect version of our order and never acknowledged the issue that I'm sure he was informed of. Once it was finally addressed he went on to do NOTHING. His exact words were that our server informed us of the wait time for the ribs so.... "". Needless to say this is my last time at this location as long as they are under his management and my last time ordering ribs since they aren't ""fresh""."
Janet T.,"Long Beach, CA",19,26,2,2.0,12/26/2016,"Our family friends drove here today from Riverside to visit for the holiday.  We were seated very quickly.  It took probably 15 minutes before the server took our drink orders.  Then another almost 30 minutes before she took our meal orders.  After another 30 minutes had passed, I asked for manager to come to the table and told him we had been there for over an hour and still didn't have our food.  Within about 5 minutes, the server brought food to 5 of the 6 of us.  She brought one meal but didn't bring the salad that my son in law planned to eat before the meal.  So when she brought the 6th meal, which was a salad with dressing on the side requested.  We told her that we had not received the salad with the one meal and the dressing on the side with the salad.  I again asked to speak to the manager.  I told him all of the above and said now we've been here for an hour and a half and she's just getting her meal incomplete and he never got his salad that should have come before the meal.  I apologized for being a difficult customer.  He first said ""well just 10 minutes ago u told me over an hour and now you say an hour and a half"".  I had to break it down and told him, yes I said over an hour and now it's been another 10-15 minutes so that's almost an hour and a half.  I told him he needed to comp those 2 meals which he did.  I wish I knew how to contact a regional manager because I think this particular location has some serious issues!  The food, by the way was good.  Typical Chilis menu which is why we go back but not sure I'll be quick to visit this location again!"
Jennifer M.,"Camarillo, CA",98,8,22,5.0,9/9/2016,"Five stars all the way! The food is absolutely amazing. You will definitely get your money's worth with the amount of food you will be getting. The service is great as well. It's always really busy though so you're better off getting the app to reserve your spot. They do a really good job of seating everything as fast as possible though. This place is amazing all around! It has become my favorite restaurant. If you haven't tried it already, you really should! It's great for an intimate dinner or going out with some friends. You won't regret going!"
C M.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/3/2017,"Im actually surprised to see so many reviews that are unpleasant. I think the people who review on yelp just like to complain. Ive always had quick, friendly service at Chili's in OX. The food was great & prepared just like it read on the menu. I order alot of my meals w/ some preparations on the side & I've never had any server not be friendly about it. I do go to Chili's when I know the Mgr Mike is there. Ive had the good fortune of seeing him at another restaurant I went to regularly in Ojai so I was more than thrilled to see him at Chili's.  He's always kind and polite & if ive ever had a food issue ( which is rare & minor) He has always taken care of it asap. Maybe you should try going there when he is working. You'll have a good time & can treat your family out & be treated with respect like someone actually cares & takes the time to show it. Thanks Chili's & thank you kindly Mike!!!"
Crystal C.,"Oxnard, CA",3,58,64,4.0,10/5/2015,"I enjoy coming to chili's they have a variety of food although I enjoy ordering their buffalo wings constantly! This a great place for celebrating any occasion. They have updated alot from tablets to order or checkout,the interior design and menu as well! I recommend going to chili's on any type of day whether in a hurry or willing to spare alot of time,they have a great staff and the food and service is fast!"
E G.,"Ventura, CA",0,31,29,3.0,7/10/2016,"Came on a Sunday and they had the soccer game on. They offer a lot of tex mex options but I ordered the sirloin steak off the 2 for $22 menu. It was pretty good and cooked to the doneness I had asked for. Came with brocolli and mashed potatoes. Boyfriend had the bacon burger and we shared the onion ring appetizer. It did take a while for the food to come out so we ended using the tablet to play a free trivia game. When we looked at our itemized bill on the tablet we noticed the games are not actually free.    Overall it was a good lunch, but we weren't in a hurry that day. I wouldn't recommend if you only had an hour because each server sticks to their own table."
Bill K.,"Canoga Park, CA",17,158,16,3.0,8/21/2015,"First off, we go to Chili's quite often.  Our home restaurant is in the SFV in West Hills.  I visited the Oxnard location for the Chili's fundraising event for a friend's organization.  The good:  hostess was great, server was excellent!  The mediocre:  the interior looked more run-down (maybe not upgraded is more accurate) than the other Chili's that we've seen.  The beef enchiladas need some TLC.  The meat was mealy and the flavoring was strange.  The chicken quesadilla, guacamole, and rice were good.  I added dessert, the cookie and ice cream sundae, but that was kinda off as well.  I have been here before, many times over the years, it's just not the same."
Ariana C.,"Port Hueneme, CA",17,1,,1.0,4/1/2016,Don't ever come here when it's packed! They take more than an hour to serve you your food.
William P.,"Camarillo, CA",1,6,,3.0,7/30/2016,"Restaurant with decent selection - kids like it mostly for the chips, but then don't eat much of their kids meal. Sometimes their chicken tenders are too oily so stay clear of those."
Katy S.,"Sacramento, CA",55,56,104,3.0,9/28/2015,Ok service got a few of the orders wrong but they fixed it. The ca flat bread was really good
Ricky M.,"Oxnard, CA",30,6,3,4.0,7/22/2016,Great place to eat that has a solid variety of food. I personally like to eat in the bar because I feel I get better service. Not sure if it's because the bar staff recognizes my family since we eat there so much. Good family environment that is a go to when nobody can agree on dinner.
Ed C.,"Los Angeles County, CA",144,359,635,4.0,7/25/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with the family. Friendly servers, quick service, and I just love their margaritas. The way to do it is come here in pairs, and you can order two entrees and an appetizer per pair ($20). Some of the entrees we got were 6 oz steak, mango chicken, and ribs. Luckily, my family has six, so we got three of those combos ($60 total). Family really loved the food, and playing trivia on the little tablet at the table. Checking out is through that same tablet if you have a credit card, so smooth transaction there. Good price, good amount of food, and a happy family."
Miho B.,"Oxnard, CA",83,40,58,1.0,5/8/2016,"I am very disappointed of the quality of the food we got tonight. First, the chips was so oily it looked like it's been sitting there for a while. It was really nonappetizing. We only ate a few pieces and had to leave the rest. The mini salad also tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge. The cucumbers wete half frozen.  The ribs barely had any meat on the bone. They didn't bring any wet wipes with the ribs so we asked one but the wipes didn't come to us until 10 minutes after we were done eating. It was very uncomfortable to keep sticky fingers throughout the meal. Finally, the mountain chocolate cake was not even warm. It is supposed to be warm and melting inside, but the chocolate fondue inside was cold and solid, not melted. Overall the meal was the worst course we've ever had. I'm so disappointed. I would never go back to the chili's."
Adrian R.,"Fillmore, CA",10,10,1,4.0,2/3/2016,"Let me begin by saying this is a biased review. My family would always gather here for birthdays so this place always brings back great memories. The food is always great and the staff has never left me feeling unappreciated. Can't beat the $20 dinner for 2 either! Great place, would definitely recommend it."
Aldava M.,"Camarillo, CA",16,154,,2.0,8/31/2015,"Our waiter was GREAT. The food quality was just OK. The kids meals we ordered were cold upon arrival. The conclusion of our experience in dining here brought on the most awkward feeling.   The waiter explained that we'd take a survey and our specific perfect scoring was imperative to his employment hours. He made us feel as if we'd personally hinder his livelihood.  Not a fan of this type of persuasive request of a perfect rating or grade; just to smoke-screen possible future customers... or falsely give a perfect experience that may not have been the case.  Btw. My ribs has literally NO meat on it. But, again our waiter was awesome."
N W.,"Camarillo, CA",5,37,1,2.0,1/10/2015,Came here for a late dinner around 8:15 and was told there was a 25 minute wait.  The bar was busy but only about 3 tables were taken. Something is wrong with this picture. I decided to just go somewhere else.  I may give this place another shot but only because I have a gift card.
Angie D.,"Port Hueneme, CA",93,9,1,4.0,7/8/2015,"I ordered my food right before I left to lunch, once I sat at my table, food was brought to me.  Waiter was observant, made sure my needs wheret, and my drink never empty. All other staff was great and friendly, greeted me as I walked in# Ordered the carnitas tacos, good but the rice wad kinda bland and flavorless. Tacos where delicious, wish there was a corn tortilla option. My strawberry lemonade tbough, wad delicious as can be. Wish I had Drank a 3d one!"
Ernie C.,"Santa Paula, CA",1,4,1,1.0,1/7/2016,"Terrible bar service. I came in and was seated instantly. Approached by the bartender, attempted to order a beer. I had on my person my CDL that was out of date. I understand the policy of requiring a valid I.D. What I don't understand is that I clearly look over 21 and 2 females who seem to know the bartender enter aren't I.D.'ed and clearly look younger then me. The females are greeted by the female bartender with hugs and hellos however never I.D'ed. The policy for ""I.D.'ing"" needs to be used across the board and shouldn't be broken for a ""friend."" Last time eating here due to this issue. Management should run an across the board ID program in the future. What if some one from ABC comes in? Just some food for thought (:"
J R.,"Oxnard, CA",61,30,31,5.0,2/7/2015,Great service the few times ive been here. Finding a place 5 kids can agree on AND eat a appitizer an whole meal says awhole lot. I love they offer lighter an healthier options without skimping on the flavor an even though its smaller portions im still full an highly satisfied. The chicken margarita is packed with flavor an chicken was grilled perfectly an juicy an moist. This will be a family favorite for sure
Sal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,78,54,1.0,1/5/2015,"Waitress was super friendly, but just shocked at the quality of the food this time. Apparently they have a shortage of French fries apparently, you could literally count the number of French fries we got which is iron ice when the competition next door gives you all you can eat French fries."
