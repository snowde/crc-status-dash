Elizabeth A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",3,31,18,4.0,7/6/2014,"While visiting Walmart in Oxnard, my mother-in-law and I have stopped by Chili's on a number of occasions and we both enjoy this place a lot. Their nacho platter is really, really good and their chicken quesadilla is insane. The atmosphere, at least around lunch- time on Saturdays, is peaceful, quiet and very comfortable. The servers have always been very friendly, polite, paid attention and served us promptly. I would recommend this Chili's if you happen to be in the neighborhood and, for those who need a quiet place to recover from Friday night; this is your spot. - Enjoy! :)"
Dianna K.,"Calabasas, CA",13,153,91,2.0,10/20/2014,"The service is horrible. No waitress for almost 10 mins. She set a salad down as she was passing by on the edge of the table with no ""here you go or anything."" Order Caribbean salad with shrimp but received chicken. More waiting. The waitress blamed the cook. Food was tasty or I would have given a 1 star."
Me M.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,5,,2.0,2/4/2016,"I went with a friend to celebrate his birthday.  We arrived at 11:15 to avoid to lunch hour rush. It was pretty empty when we arrived, yet it took a while for us to actually get seated.  We were seen by staff, just not welcomed or approached & left standing in the entry way. I actually thought we had to seat ourselves... So we get seated and we tried to order Mimosas (my friend's favorite drink) but were told they had no champagne (disappointing).  Then they had no bananas for the straberry-banana margarita I wanted.  Again, disappointing but we moved on. My friend had wine, I settled for a regular blended strawberry  margarita.  We asked for water with our drinks and were only  brought 1 glass.  We had to flag our waiter down and ask for another glass of water because he rushed off when he dropped off the first glass.  Ugh... It took longer for our food to arrive but when it did it was just ok. I ordered the quesadilla combo (on the lunch menu) and a house salad.  I got no fries and the portions were very small.  The house salad you actually get looks NOTHING like it does on the menu.  It comes in a cup, not a plate.  And, because its sooooo small, there are very few greens.  Disappointing. We told our waiter we were celebrating my friend's birthday and we were actually asked if we wanted them to bring a scoop of ice cream and sing to the birthday boy.  Why ask if we already told you we were celebrating???? It's suppose to be a surprise!  Our waiter also assured me that the manager would be removing the charge for the ice cream from our bill.  She did not.  No biggie but why tell me she would if she wasn't going to?    We should have gone across the way to Friday's instead.  Next time we will."
Justine M.,"Riverside, CA",0,13,4,1.0,5/16/2015,Just left 5 minutes ago. Waited 15 minutes for a server to see us. Then she decided to order everyone's food together and still take forever. We decided to leave and go to home town buffet across the street and it was the best decision we ever made. I'll never go back!
Aimee P.,"Oxnard, CA",119,15,3,4.0,11/11/2015,"Just wanted to give a special shoutout to our server tonight Valerie. Very attentive and had a smile on her face the whole night. Even though we were her last guests to leave. My only complaint was the chicken crispers tasted funky. Not at all her fault though, will be back because of her."
Meghan K.,"Long Beach, CA",55,8,3,5.0,6/20/2014,"We are a family of 3 from Long Beach out here for a soccer tournament.  We read the reviews, they weren't all that great. But we love our local Chili's and thought we would give it a chance.  First, we were seated quickly and our drinks came out fast along with our chips and salsa (chips were still hot! Yum). Our server (maria) was a friendly and attentive.  Drinks were never low! The food was tasty and served hot (my husband said this Chili's gives our lakewood location a run for their money on the cajun pasta). Our 10 year old said the kids pizza was great. We definitely recommend this Chili's if you are traveling or need good meal. Thanks:)"
Sandra P.,"Ventura, CA",0,20,,4.0,6/27/2016,"Went in after work with a friend of mine for some drinks and snacks. The purpose of this review is to commend Nick for the great service. I had come in before and was always given mediocre service by people that didn't enjoy their job. As for this time, it was a pleasant surprise to come across someone friendly and helpful, he made our night enjoyable after a tough day at work."
Edgar P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,9,4,3.0,1/10/2015,"Not sure why some are complaining about the Ziosk, this is actually a plus.  It expedites the process of paying and ordering of drinks and dessert, you don't have to spend hours waiting for the waitperson, wait for the receipt, then wait for the card to clear, or wait for the person to order desert.  Everything is on your table.  And if you don't want it, just put it aside don't use it.. Meal for two for $20.00 is a great deal,  Go to TGIF and you will  not find anything similar.  I also like the way they honor veterans, with their 10% discount.   Sure, waiting time is long, but only on certain days like weekends.  But try going to other place and you will realize that this is nothing abnormal for that day and time.  On a normal day, there is almost no waiting at all. Waitpersons are actually friendly and will assist you with whatever you need, just ask! This is how I will rate this place: Waiting time-Normal 3 stars Food: Nothing extraordinary, but not bad either  3 stars Service 3 stars Veterans appareciation-4 stars Ziosk-4 stars, very helpful if you know how to use it."
Raven C.,"Ventura, CA",22,21,36,4.0,6/7/2014,"I went to Chili's again yesterday. It was packed, way too loud. The music was too loud and the Air-conditioning was blasting! The south western egg rolls were only warm coming out this time, instead of hot. The air conditioning made my food cold right away. I was freezing and just wanted to eat quick and get out of there. Not as pleasant visit as lady time I was here."
Erika L.,"Oxnard, CA",3,13,3,5.0,6/20/2015,"Love this Place. My Fiancee and i have been coming here since our first date 4 years ago. Thanks to Oscar, he is one of the best waiters! He always makes our Experience a memorable one. He is the Best!! Ask for Oscar!!!"
JaNae S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/5/2015,I've always had a great experience at this Chili's! I love the hot chips and salsa/queso. I've come here at least 10 times and have never had a problem. Plus I love the kiosks! I'd much rather swipe my card to pay than wait for my waiter!
Jen C.,"Olympia, WA",0,24,2,2.0,4/29/2015,"Was this previously a Burger King? I basically felt like I was in a fast food restaurant, minus the ""fast"" aspect of it. Kitchen was slow - food was sort of...stale. Chilis used to be fairly decent for a chain restaurant. I have no interest in returning."
A L.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,13,2,1.0,3/5/2016,"We got seated and waited roughly about 20 minutes for our waiter to get our drink order. The drinks and appetizer came fairly quickly. We had the guacamole and chips appetizer or should I say the old (turning brown) guacamole and the oil drenched chips.... Then about 30 minutes later came what they apparently consider to be fajitas with a side of cold undercooked rice for an additional 99 cents. The fries had been recooked..yuck! They were cold, stale and plain nasty. I remembered why it had been about 18 years since I had been here, the food is drenched in oil! Chicken tenders ooze with oil/grease. If you order chicken crispers make sure to ask for a pack of napkins so you can try and remove the excess grease from your food. Based on my experience today, it may be another 20 years before I come back."
Alexis G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,1,5.0,3/25/2016,"Go. See. Chelly. She is amazing, best service hands down. My cup was never empty I never had to ask for a thing, she was always on it. When we went we were there for happy hour/watching the hockey game. It was a Thursday night, pretty busy but she always had us taken care of. Cannot stress how awesome the service at this location was."
Julio A.,"Goleta, CA",1,5,2,1.0,9/19/2014,Worst experience ever. We got seated at 8:55pm and still by 9:15pm no one came over to even asked us for our drinks. 4 waitresses kept walking back and forth and none of them even stop by to acknowledge that we were waiting. So we got up and walked next door to TGIF's. It will take a while before WE return to Chilys. to this establishment.
Eric N.,"Stockton, CA",2985,597,3265,3.0,12/21/2010,"Eh.   Was not impressed the last time I came here. The wife and I came here because we had seen a television commercial advertising their ""2 for $20"" special.  We love going to TGI Friday's next door because of their same special where two people eat for 20 bucks so we figured we would try out Chili's just for the heck of it. The first thing we noticed was that you get less at Chili's than you do at Friday's.  At Friday's you get a shared appetizer, a main course and a shared desert.  At Chili's you get a shared appetizer and a main course and that is it.  They did not seem to have a whole lot of a selection on the special menu to choose from...it is very limited in what you can get.   The service was decent...nothing to write home about but it was not horrible.  At the time we came in to get dinner there were not a whole lot of customers in the building and it seemed like maybe our waitress had more tables than she could handle. She did a decent job of trying to juggle those tables but the customer service still suffered.   I guess it all boils down to the question of will I be going back here? Eh. Probably not.  :0)"
al c.,"Lancaster, CA",31,43,1,2.0,2/12/2015,I wanted to order the ribs but the waitress told me the cook said they didn't look good. They put delicious looking ribs on the menu. What a shame
Taylor S.,"Oxnard, CA",66,5,1,1.0,3/17/2014,"My husband and I chose to eat here for our anniversary dinner.  Worst dinning experience ever.  We got seated right away.  Our server took a few minutes to acknowledge us.  This is when the first mistake occurred.  I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and my husband ordered a double shot of patron.  After a 15 min wait she brought our drinks.  My husband only received a single shot and my daiquiri was watered down.  She took our order.  We got the boneless wings for an appetizer. My husband ordered the ribeye.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich.  At this point my husband ordered the patron margarita.   The manager brought out our appetizer.  Which was good.  I think it was the best part of the whole meal.  Another lady brought out our entrees and my husbands patron margarita.  My food wasn't good nor bad.  Just an average buffalo chicken sandwich. My husbands food on the other hand was no where near edible.  The steak was so incredibly salty.  Another patron to the side of us ordered the same thing and also had the same complaint.  The broccoli was bland.  The best thing on his plate was the potatoes.  He only ate about 1/3 of his meal. His margarita was also watered down just like my daiquiri.   We only saw our server when the order was placed, to bring out our drinks, right before she dropped the check to ask if we needed a box to which my husbands response was ""it wasn't worth it"" and when she dropped off the check.  And she didn't even bother coming all the way around the corner to do so. This was the last straw.  So we asked to speak to the manager. He didn't apologize or even acknowledge the lousy service or food.  He just comped the appetizer and went on about his way.  He wasn't very friendly either.  You can tell why the service sucked, it trickles down from the top. I've never experienced such lousy service and rude servers."
Laura S.,"Ojai, CA",103,10,,5.0,11/25/2014,This Chili's is consistently good.  My son ordered the Big Mouth Bites.  Yummy.  I ordered Buffalo Wings and a house salad.  Chili's wings are the best.  I crave them.  Their ranch is also good.  No bottled BS.  I don't know how any self respecting restaurant could use bottled ranch.  But Chili's doesn't... so fuhgettaboutit.  I usually get the fajita trio.  So incredibly tasty.  Anyways...after reading reviews about the Yard House I'm so glad I chose to spend my hard earned cash here.  Good job Chili's!
Max G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,62,2,1.0,1/13/2015,"Slow service, Cold Food, Empty Drink Glasses. Can't find a manager. Not good. Used to be better but something changed."
