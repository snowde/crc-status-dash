Michelle T.,"Frazier Park, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/24/2016,"Over the holidays I enjoyed a nice meal but when it came to paying our bill our waiter asked us to give him a excellent review because the amount of hours he works is based on how many favorable reviews he receives.  Awkward moment!  I just went to Chilis to enjoy a meal with my family, the last thing I want is to feel pressure to rate YOUR employees.  That is NOT my job.  Will not be back."
Danny L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/1/2015,Beware you want the two for 35 i end up paying 70 then the drinks  ?? Margaritas tast like lemonade i will not be coming back and restrooms were filthy
Benjamin C.,"Oxnard, CA",4,6,1,2.0,12/7/2014,My waiter was nice but extremely slow we were there 2 hours before we got our food. Place noisy so if that's your environment it's a place for you when I got my food it was cold but I was already waiting outside in my car because I was pissed at the amount of time it took so I asked make it to go. it took 45 min to get my drink refilled well I was in there and 30 min to get my bill so I could leave. My over all Impression I'm not impressed at what my 45 bucks got me.
Ty S.,"San Francisco, CA",337,7,43,4.0,4/6/2010,"Chili's has always been on the fence with my preferences. Personally chain restaurants don't impress me very often and at previous Chili's dining experiences I've been very disappointed to say the least.  However, tonight after being hungry for hours we settled as a last resort on our old acquaintance of Chili's. As I said I was hungry, and so were the other diners I was with. I wanted something that was going to fill me up and not leave me hungry an hour later like many chain restaurants do. So on the bill was:  1.) SOUTHERN SMOKEHOUSE BACON BURGER With maple bacon, smoked cheddar, mayo, crispy onion stings and ancho-chile BBQ sauce. ""Wow that is some really good bacon"" This burger was phenomenal. It's one of their newer items and my mom was glad she ordered it. Quite the guilty pleasure worth of nutrition - As Served it has 2080 calories.  2.) CLASSIC BACON BURGER A crowd-pleasing favorite topped with apple wood smoked bacon, cheddar, red onion and mayo. A burger is a burger. My sister said it was a little dry, but she's easy to please.  3.) For my quest to get a filling meal I ordered the MARGARITA GRILLED CHICKEN Classic Margarita-flavored grilled chicken with hints of lime and citrus, served with rice, black beans, tortilla strips and house-made pico de gallo. I told our honest and very attentive waiter no tortilla strips though. AND...it was freakin' good! The chicken was tender and flavorful. The beans and rice as a bed to the chicken were cooked and complemented chicken very nicely.  4.) Chili's Mango and Blackberry Iced teas are very flavorful as well as their what seemed to be fresh Strawberry Lemonade (with real strawberry seeds floating around!!!) Anyways, the bill was around $40 for a meal that I wasn't expecting much out of from past dining experiences with the restaurant. I left with a good full and a smile."
Me B.,"Ventura, CA",0,37,,2.0,9/28/2015,"The 3rd party delivery service was super quick about 30 minutes!  Unfortunately all of the food was stone cold.   The chips even came in a bag with instructions to microwave.  Well, I don't own a microwave and if I treat us to a delivered meal I expect it to be ready to eat!"
Jen S.,"Sacramento, CA",112,161,135,4.0,12/13/2011,"Didn't feel like cooking last night and a friend recently told me you can order the ""2 for $20"" deal through Chili's-to-Go.  I placed our order easily on their website and it was ready in less than 15 minutes. We split the fried mozzerella sticks with marinara sauce, I had the half rack of ribs with loaded mashed potatoes, and my honey had the fried shrimp, steamed broccoli, and the same potatoes.  Total came out to $21.46.  We will definitely order to-go again."
Ken H.,"Oxnard, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/7/2016,"Went there for dinner on Saturday the 7th. I ordered fajitas with chicken and carnitas. Usually fajitas are smoking and sizzling when the hit the table. These we cold. Sent them back after finally getting the attention of our server. When they came back they were burned. They just put the skillet on the grill with no oil or moisture and all the veggies were burnt to the skillet. They were hot though. Again tried to get the attention of our server and again we sent it back asking for an order that was not burned. We waited 15 minutes and the next order came out was acceptable but not great. The staff needs more training. The manager came by the table and asked what the problem was, we explained and he glad we fixed it. Not sorry or I'll buy desert. Then to top it off the people behind us with a small girl let her scream and yell as if it were a playground. My suggestion, don't go to chillies on Saturday evening. Too bad never again."
Erica R.,"Oxnard, CA",15,95,1,3.0,2/19/2012,"After seeing a commercial for Chili's $20 for 2 for an appetizer and two entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Chili's.  We had a ten to fifteen minute wait before we were seated and then our drink orders were taken. We looked through the menu, choose our food, and closed our menus.  Our drinks came, then we waited with our menus closed - and then waited for a waiter to come by to take our order.  Nearly ten minutes passed by.  Finally, an unhappy looking waiter came by to take our orders, barely looking at us.  Luckily, once our order was in, we didn't have to wait long for the food. For our appetizer, we had the onion rings.  I'm not a big fan of onion rings in general, but my boyfriend enjoyed then.  My boyfriend ordered the sirlion steak, which was tender and well seasoned.  I'm not a big red meat eater and I was enjoying the deliciousness of the meat.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, which came out pipping hot on a hot plate.  The chicken was not seasoned and quite bland, but with the toppings included (i.e. cheese, sour cream, guacomole, lettuce, tomatoes, onions) was edible.   I believe that, given the choices on the menu for the $20 for 2 deal, the place is worth trying again.  I may even go for a sirlion steak this time.  That's why the food deserves a star rating.  However, the service deserves two starts.  A long wait time and unfriendly waiter made the experience unpleasant.  Isn't that a big reason why someone goes to a restaurant anyway? Oh yeah, and Chili's does serve actual chili for all you curious people out there!  :-)"
Christianna O.,"Camarillo, CA",2,14,8,1.0,2/28/2014,"Clearly don't care about getting more diners. We saw our waitress once when she took our order the rest if the time we had to stop people passing by to inquire about our drinks, soups, and entrees. Oh sorry I lied she dropped off our check I informed her my order was wrong and she informed me I should have mentioned that before I said I would have if I had seen you. She said well maybe next time. Have a good day. What the heck?!! Whatever it was bad service. Alright food. (Cold soup but tasty)"
Allison M.,"Ojai, CA",1,9,3,5.0,9/7/2014,"As a regular Felipe has always been my favorite! Keep it up Felipe, our original server apparently couldn't handle 3 tables so she handed us to Felipe,who already had a whole full section himself, and I'm so glad she did! He's wonderful and a great asset to your team. As for the young lady with a tattoo on her left forearm. she didn't seem to be apologetic nor look at us once we were actually just offended by her. It's all good though! Foods definitely a major plus to the great service. Oh and Also the hostess (young man) with the glasses, absolutely a gentleman!"
Kevin E.,"Oxnard, CA",5,12,1,2.0,1/25/2014,"Honestly the food is pretty good; but damn someone messed up somewhere, because an hour wait is ridiculous."
Michael F.,"Ventura, CA",31,200,540,4.0,9/27/2011,"The food:    We started off with Chips n Salsa n Queso.....   The queso wasn't really impressive, I guess I was looking more for a nacho cheese dip... This one was darker than nacho cheese and had chunks in it (I think either ground sausage or beef)....  Not bad, but not great...    For lunch we ordered off their seasonal menu....   The Green Chile Hatch Burger was first up...  Really good.. not really spicy at all, but I think Chili's burgers are pretty good for a restaurant chain...     I liked the green chile sauce they put on the burger...   The beef tasted really flavorful as well...  Next up we had the Bacon Chicken Ranch quesadilla.    This was pretty good as well...  At first the portion size seemed pretty small, but with the chips to start us out with, it was perfect...   and very tasty as well! The service was excellent... Our drinks always full, and when we polished off the first basket of chip they offered us a refill of the chips and salsa (not the cheese)....   I thought that was pretty nice... For a chain restaurant, if you want something dependable and consistent, this may be the place to go...  It's good..."
Vanessa M.,"Ventura, CA",9,66,5,4.0,5/30/2013,"A few days after I wrote my review, I received the apology certificates in the mail. I have to admit I was a little iffy about giving them another chance but when my birthday came around and we couldn't decide where to go with the kids we thought, ""what the hay we have free certificates"". Let me just say, ""Big Improvement""! We walked in and the hostess actually asked us our preferences for seating! We were seated almost immediately and our server was great. He really made our experience a heck of a lot better then the last. After we presented the certificates the manager came out and made sure our experience was an improvement. All in all they have redeemed themselves and we will be going back to this location."
Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",288,180,569,3.0,12/12/2009,"When I think of Chili's I think of a very fun restaurant!  I have been seeing their commercials for years & I always think of their Chili's symbol and baby back ribs  because of their very catchy song,  ""I want  my baby back, baby back, baby back, I want my baby back, baby back, baby back Ribs"" I would categorize their food as American/Tex-Mex. There is a lot of sandwiches, burgers, and Tex-Mex inspired food. I actually like their food, but I would like it a WHOLE LOTE MORE if it was less salty. I personally think that people who really love their food have to have deadened taste buds. Their flavor is not intense, its just salty. Often times I order their food telling the waiter to tell the food preparer NOT to add more salt on my fries or not to use their season salt.  I have been to about four different Chili's locations in California and one in Hawaii and realized that the saltiness is consistent from one Chili's location to another.  What I DO LOVE about Chili's is they have GREAT drinks! Oh, their drinks are super yummy and I love that they are colorful and fruity, just how I like them. Yes, they are girly, but they get you buzzed so it still works its wonders. Chilil's is not my first choice, but I would go to Chili's for drinks, appetizers & if the line for other restaurants were long.  I think they could improve their menu with some more grown up dishes because I feel they have a lot of ""fast food"" like items. Sorry Chili's, I'm just being honest."
Matthew D.,"Ventura, CA",77,16,9,4.0,2/24/2012,"Chili's is a little too pricey for my blood. But, I guess that's the ""persona"" they've taken on over the years. Besides the price, the drink was stiff and the appetizer's were appetizing. I recommend the cheese & meat skillet. I had the Chicken sandwich that's supposed to be smothered in hot wing sauce, but they were rather skimpish with that. And that took FOREVER to come out. But the server was great, and that is why I gave them 4 out of 5 stars."
H. W.,"Newport Beach, CA",77,27,38,3.0,8/26/2013,"We were one of the first customers to be sat in the restaurant right after it opened at 11am. As more customers came in, they were ALL sat right next to us. The entire section was full within 20 minutes of kids and families while the entire three fourths of the restaurant was open. Where is the seating rotation ?? The service was very slow. We ordered 15 minutes into being sat. We watched as the other tables that came in after us ordered their food and then received their food before us. Not to mention our server forgot one of the side dishes we ordered. We had to leave before we got to even start eating due to an emergency and I will say the staff was really quick with getting us our to-go boxes and our check. Because we had to leave so fast we did not review the bill and completely forgot out the Mac n cheese we ordered that we never got. I called the restaurant later that evening and spoke to the manager who was very nice. He gave me the option to have my card refunded or get some $10 coupons mailed to me. I chose the coupons and will be giving the location closer to my home a try."
Christopher G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,11,3.0,8/18/2013,Everything seems to taste fresh but the boneless wings have that frozen taste. They really taste like they've been in the freezer for a while and they're always cd by the time they get to your table. Try to avoid them!
Ignacio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,148,39,2.0,11/18/2010,"I am actually surprise to see the amount of fair reviews this restaurant is getting. Now the food is ok, not good to the point that every city needs a Chilis! I went with my coworkers to have dinner after we were done with one of our classes. I was actually underwhelmed with the menu, I though the selection was not that extensive. I just saw salads, burgers, and chicken, the usual things you expect in a chain restaurant!  I had the tortilla soup and the triple dipper.   Again, the food was ok, I'm not going to say it was nasty because, that my friends, would be a lie. One thing though, don't order boneless chicken pieces, I don't know, just the though of chicken not having bones gives me chills, I mean chickens are ment to have those things in their bodies, so let's accept them in our plate. The food tasted really how can I say it.... Very mass market! The location is horrible, right in the middle of what seems acres and acres of parking!!! There is no view what so ever, but the view of thousands of cars, and if looked at the other side you see WalMart, so in reality you don't get the best experiAnce. Service was slow, and also I did not appriciate my drinks being poured in a plastic cup, cmon, let's give the consumers more credit. Beer options are also not that great. They either have (domestics) bud light (imports) corona, very typical beer. There was no micro-brewery option! For what I ate, I don't think it was worth it, I don't know that's just me. I guess this restaurant serves its purpose, being right off the 101, it caters to passing visitors. The view, the feel, the decoration, it's ment to move people as fast as possible (just eat and leave), I don't think it was build for the local population.  I did however enjoy eating with my coworkers, we actually socialize, which I guess added to the experiance."
Ah N.,"Oxnard, CA",0,17,,2.0,2/10/2013,"Service was slow, our appetizers came after our meal, and the food tasted like it had been left sitting there for a few minutes. I hope they really read these reviews and improve the quality of their service and the food. Oh! One server had been peeing and ""forgot"" to wash their hands"
Jay I.,"Camarillo, CA",6,20,1,3.0,10/20/2014,"Food was alright, I had to keep telling the waiter a couple times to bring us ranch or other things."
