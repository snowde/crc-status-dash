B K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",3,38,18,4.0,7/27/2015,"Was in town overnight for business and Chilis was the only full serve restaurant in the area that I was familiar with. I was greeted by a friendly hostess and sat right away, and my server who didn't give me his name, was quick to take my drink order.   I also ordered the guacamole and chip that came with salsa, the chips were fresh and warm, the guacamole was really good too.  Never been a big fan of Chilis salsa, tastes like they over do it with cilantro, but good.  I ordered the Ancho Salmon that came with rice and broccoli, the salmon was excellent, it wasn't over cooked like most chain restaurants do.  The Ancho sauce added a very nice flavor without masking the flavor of the fish.  The rice was fine, nothing wonderful, but good, the broccoli was a little tough, it may have been microwaved ?   My only complaint at this Chilis is they don't have WiFi !  I mean come on, even most Subways, McDonalds, and Wendy's have WiFi.  I think the reason they don't offer it is so you will want to play with their Ziosk touch screen tablet on the table.  Even though it's nice to be able to pay your bill at the table, those things need to be wiped down every time they bus the tables.  They get pretty gross."
Marb J.,"Melrose, FL",0,5,,1.0,8/25/2017,"The place is very greasy,the tables, the menus. There were bread crumbs on our table. Terrible menu and overpriced. Never again. Not impressed."
H S.,"Marco Island, FL",1,56,17,2.0,7/26/2016,"This is one of the very few liqueur license restaurants in the area so I chose to go here since it is a franchise and you get what you expect.The kitchen overcooked the steak to well when asked for medium and then the second one was totally rare but in a chain restaurant like chili's I guess it is to be expected.  Nice food presentation, my bartender was a great server.   Only issue... Please clean bar windows that separate the dining area they are gross to look at."
Ana B.,"Vero Beach, FL",2,24,11,1.0,9/23/2016,"Ordered my staple plate, Margarita Grilled Chicken to go because I had cold groceries in my car and couldn't turn it off. The amount of rice was laughable. No tortilla strips with it. Order d to be delivered to my car, after 5 minutes had to get out to get my now cold food because the employee ""missed it"". Never again from this location. Save your $ and go elsewhere."
Becky F.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",65,159,262,3.0,10/30/2016,Got a whole meal for just 10 dollars. The chicken fajitas and salad and molten lava cake. This was a special they have going on. The food was made with no seasoning for me with no problem.
Lindsay B.,"Jacksonville, FL",95,1,1,2.0,1/7/2017,"I asked to charge my phone because I was lost and trying to get back home to Jacksonville and was told no because an employee was charging her phone (I was lost with my 8 year old daughter). So I sat and ordered food to not be rude and wait for the outlet to open. I ordered a triple dipper to share with my daughter, pretty simple right? No. Food took 20 minutes to come out. It was luke warm and when I took one bite out of my slider it was raw. Waited ten or more minutes before my waiter noticed we hadn't touched our food and he finally acknowledged us and brought our sliders back to re cook. Came back out 15 minutes later and cooked medium. Asked immediately for a box just to wait another ten minutes (been here over an hour now for one appetizer). Then was given my box and had to ask for my check which was another wait. Needless to say I've been visiting chilis for nearly 17 years now and never ever have had this type of experience. Won't ever be back!"
Shanna W.,"Keystone Heights, FL",0,9,1,3.0,5/16/2016,"The food is good,  we have been there so many times as a family and as a large group. Some of the servers are not so great, but overall we will continue to go back."
Amanda C.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2017,"I wish there was a star less than one...to start with my 7 year old daughter ordered milk for her drink...they brought it out to her and she took one sip and said ""mom...this is disgusting!"" I take the lid off to find the milk curdled and smelling disgusting. Took the waitress 10+ minutes to come back to the table so I could show her...her response was ""eww that's gross""...yea, gross is correct, not to mention potentially dangerous...if my daughter hadn't been old enough to speak up she might have gotten really sick. Next, our meals were brought out about an hour after our initial order time...my burgers were over cooked, the chicken crispers were soggy and most of the food tasted like it had been sitting for a while. Arrived at 6:30pm and didn't leave till 8:00pm...was never offered any type of compensation for the milk situation...manager never even came out to apologize. Overall I honestly wish we would have ran through McDonalds instead...and that's saying something!"
Delisa K.,"Orange Park, FL",88,51,32,1.0,6/14/2015,"Worst food and service. Server was slow and the hamburger was cooked wrong and soaked in grease. You pass by the kitchen on the way to the bathroom and it was not clean. We will not be back, ever. No one in our party even finished their dinner."
Lori Y.,"Interlachen, FL",9,19,3,3.0,9/19/2015,"There isn't many places to go in Palatka, so this location stays packed. So we always do to go orders. Our orders are always on time and they never have messed our orders or left anything out. My only concern is that they are already pretty expensive for the portion size, and yesterday my receipt total says $61 yet when I checked my card it said that they took out over $84.  I didn't have any delivery of any type or hop service. I went inside and paid and carried the food out myself. I've never been automatically charged a tip when I did to go. I'm not even sure if that is what they did. But they def. took 20 more dollars than was on my receipt. So everyone be careful with your credit and debit cards at this location. I will only be using cash here from now on. Scary."
Mister O.,"Altoona, FL",0,24,20,4.0,6/12/2013,I had the Southwestern Burger and Fires. It was cooked just the way I requested and tasted great. The service was fast and friendly. Checkout is quick and easy with the pay at the table option on their new electronic devices. The dining room and restrooms were clean and modern. Good customer service from the wait staff and the manager was present and visible as well. No problems here! We will be back. Visited June 2013
