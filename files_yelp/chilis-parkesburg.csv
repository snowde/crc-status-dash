Billy Y.,"Ocean City, NJ",1,13,1,4.0,11/25/2017,Most if the food was good except the buffalo blue chicken was lacking meat (some grissle and fat).  The place is clean. Staff was friendly but forgot some things. I gave her a big tip anyway.
Sharlene S.,"Coatesville, PA",9,11,,1.0,11/9/2017,"I was at this restaurant two nights ago and can not believe after complaining about the food, the manager never came over to speak with us. This restaurant has really gone down hill and the food was not good at all. Tried speaking with the manager, but no reply. What does that say about customer service. Never again will we eat dinner here and we were there for a Coatesville fundraiser."
Shar S.,"Coatesville, PA",7,10,,2.0,9/8/2016,"They really need to get their act together.   If you call for pick up, it's so long you don't feel like eating after the wait. The chairs are always dirty as well as high hairs and they need to find something else to clean with instead of using a wet rag that just pushes around the dirt. It's gone downhill in the past year"
Irina D.,"New York, NY",1,2,1,1.0,4/16/2017,"Worst Chili's I even been. Bad service and bad food. Got brown guacamole, dry black beans, rubber steak. Part of my dish was brought before the rest. So when the rest of the food came my rice and beans were cold. My husband asked for pink burger and got a dry ""no pink"" burger instead. My daughter got canned corn instead of corn on cob.  Overall the food didn't seem fresh and had a terrible taste."
Suzie C.,"Downingtown, PA",0,17,,1.0,2/26/2017,If I could give 0 stars I would. Asked to not be seated in the bar. I'm sure it was retaliation-put us at a tiny table for 2 with no game computer. food came out cold and not made following normal recipe for the dish. No boxes for leftovers. Really?  Servers were non-existent and manager hid in the kitchen to avoid customers. Restaurant was empty so it's not like there was an excuse for any of this. Just a bad place to dine.
G M.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,We ordered food for take out which was supposed to be ready at 6:41 pm. It was 7:30 pm by the time our food was ready. And they would not cancel our order. Definitely lost a customer.
Greg G.,"Coatesville, PA",0,15,,1.0,1/15/2017,Past two times we have been there service has been horrible.  We got up and left just now cause we sat there for 15 minutes and nobody came to our table. Won't be back!
Jeremy G.,"Coatesville, PA",34,12,,5.0,1/16/2016,Good for a chain restaurant. I do love the molten lava cakes though. We had a great waitress named megan! She was awesome!
Stephanie B.,"Garnet Valley, PA",71,8,,5.0,8/26/2015,Everything was great! The food was good and the waitress was the best we've had in a very long time. The staff just couldn't do enough to make you happy. The restaurant was clean and the prices were reasonable. Will definitely go back in the future.
Chuck W.,"Parkesburg, PA",0,19,1,4.0,10/8/2014,Never really had a problem prices are good staff was good and the food was good sometimes you gotta wait during the rush
t w.,"Chester Springs, PA",0,104,,2.0,4/9/2015,Be leary of the chicken used in the fajitas...it had a funky taste kinda spoiled/off taste daughter didn't take a 2nd bite. Called waitress over she rushed back to the kitchen and said they'll make another one. While we waited already we finished my dish so the waitress noticed and said i'll have it boxed up. I think mgr should been called over to take off the bill. I was upset to pay for something to take home and reheat another time. Didn't enjoy dinner out that's the whole point of going out to eat!
Amoriona P.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,10,,2.0,12/27/2014,"I've been to this location a total of about 5 times and service was always okay.  I came here on a Friday night after work, hungry,  a day after christmas around 10pm.  Once we walked in no one was there to greet us, still not acceptable even for the time frame.  We waited a few minutes and finally someone came, there was also another group behind us.  We were escorted to a table that wasn't quite clean which the person noticed, so then we were escorted to another table.  I'm usually passive about those problems because maybe they're short staffed, I don't know.  Our waitress was friendly.  Only one thing was mistaken by her, which was that she put in chicken instead of shrimp for one of our pastas.  The wait time was the usual wait time, not too long and not too fast.  I ordered one of the Southwest Pairings, option with three items. Our entrees came out, my dish looked like the food was just thrown on the plate.  This is Chili's, so I didn't expect the plate to look like the picture but still it was a sloppy mess.  I was pretty hungry and i dug on in and not even three bites, I glanced at a small white item which I thought was maybe mozzarella cheese that was accidentally dropped on my plate from another dish, and I pushed it to the side.  I finally went back to it because it was the only weird looking item on my plate.  I looked closer and it happened to be a small cap from some type of spray! I stopped eating, disappointed that I barely dug in, still hungry I had to wait for the waitress to come back around to tell her what I found.  She quickly went to get the manager.  I understand it wasn't her fault but they should be a bit more careful.  The manager came out and said, ""I know this isn't OKAY or ACCEPTABLE BUT when I heard you found a spray cap, I thought about it and the only spray we have is oil/non stick spray.""  Well dah, WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE? I hope not a hair spray or body spray cap!  I wasn't infuriated about what happened, I just wanted to let them know.  The manager offered that I could just get the dish taken off the bill or get a new dish. I was still hungry so I ordered a new dish; My new dish was still free though.  As for visiting this location or any chilis again, I most likely will not.  I was just hungry and wanted to grab drinks and a late dinner with family.  The service was okay, but the professionalism of the manager wasn't okay.  You definitely shouldn't apologize about a spray cap being in someone's food the way he did.  It's definitely not okay in any terms, whether it's food spray or not, anyone could have choked on it and it could have been worse.  Spray caps are touch by fingers everyday, :/ gross.  I could have been an asshole customer and made it a big issue knowing that some people in this area would do that. It was a, "" Sorry, not sorry situation"",not okay."
N U.,"Coatesville, PA",93,157,,1.0,12/27/2013,Second time I've been here and they are on a wait with open tables everywhere u look. When we finaly did get seated food took over a half hour and was ice cold when we got it. Service was good but she def felt bad for us. Would not recommend this particular location
MR L.,"Washington, DC",0,26,9,4.0,7/13/2014,On a college road trip with my daughter to visit Albright College.  We stayed in a wonderful Courtyard Marriott and ventured 5 miles for a restaurant.  We found Chilis. The new Text Mex bowl is worth more than the $10 price tag.  They gave so much I had to ask for a box to go.  For $10 I have lunch and dinner.  It was well seasoned and the staff were extremely friendly.
Cynthia S.,"Highland, PA",11,16,12,3.0,1/21/2012,"This Chili's has gained a few stars in the last few years, I believe a change in management is the reason. I must be a glutton for punishment, I went back again and again - from the time they opened (there wasn't much to pick from out here) I had 5 bad experiences in a row, each one worse that the last. I can't help it, it was the kid's first choice for Birthday dinner out, and I am a sucker for a baby pool size margarita. I won't smear this review with past events, only sum that up with the fact that I had never directed a criticism to any corporate office before, but after horrible visit #5 I broke my silence. They did send me a free dinner voucher to return - which I did not use. I was not looking for a free meal, and did not want to alienate myself at the establishment to make them feel like they had to perform above and beyond the call of duty.  After a brief hiatus, I did happen to see an ad that they were looking to hire a general manager. So, we decided to try again. We have since been back a few times without incident, and gotten To Go as well. The food is still HOT when you get it, it arrives ON TIME, and the margaritas are still great. Just remember to get everyone's re-fill drink order at one time, we still had a missed water or soda refill, but that was due in part to the kids ordering willy nilly. We will return, and hopefully upgrade this review!"
T M.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,5,,1.0,4/1/2013,"I think this is my last trip here. It has been over an hour and a half. Hope to get out of here in 2 hours.  Cold food, painfully slow service. I keep giving this place additional tries but this is the last straw. Drive to the one in downingtown."
Bryan A.,"Abingdon, MD",0,7,,1.0,10/8/2012,"It's chilis pretty much same food at all of them but dang, service is so poor here decied I'm not going back, there's like 4 tables and bartender still can fill a drink, one time had great service by a girl never seen her since, bartender during day is horrible."
Lauren B.,"Parkesburg, PA",1,31,,2.0,2/6/2012,"Let me start out that Chili's is not one of my favorite chains but there is not much out here.  When I first moved to the area, I would order to-go meals from Chili's every so often.  EVERY single order was incorrect.  I ordered a to-go order a few weeks ago and it was the first time everything was RIGHT!   Eating in the restaurant is hit or miss.   When I went to eat with my sister, she asked for ranch dressing to come out with her meal, it didn't.  She asked the passing female manager to get her ranch.  The manager rolled her eyes, sighed quietly, and NEVER brought it out.  We could see her messing around in the kitchen with co-workers.  The restaurant was very busy and the servers seemed overwhelmed.  Our lunch took an hour to come out so I don't understand why she was not helping expedite the food. I guess fooling around in the kitchen with male employees was more important.    I wrote a letter to corporate about the incident and never received an apology."
Angel R.,"Honey Brook, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/26/2014,"Was there a month back, I used a giftcard to pay for our meal, a total of $60.00. the waiter came back and said they had a problem with the giftcard and can only charge 45.00 on it, so we decided to pay CASH, then found out a few days later the giftcard was charged around 11 am. the next morning for our meal. so me paid DOUBLE FOR OUR MEAL. WE LIVE IN THE AREA AND FREQUENT THIS REST. BUT WILL NOT RETURN EVER AGAIN!! BTW WE SAT IN THE BAR AREA :("
Peter E.,"Trenton, NJ",0,12,,2.0,9/4/2011,"I know you can't expect too much from these sort of places, but my disappointment tonight could so easily have been prevented. I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger and the kitchen came out to say they had run out of mushrooms an hour ago ! This was 6.30pm ! The thing is, this place is located in the corner of the Walmart car park. Why on earth didn't the manager send one of the girls over to buy a couple boxes of mushrooms ! I have worked in a kitchen myself and if it's at all possible, you avoid letting the customers down !!  The manager spent all night, just swanning around like he owned the place ! Why didn't he come over to ask if I was a happy chappy !"
Janet S.,"Reading, PA",1,7,,1.0,5/21/2012,"I used to eat here fairly often when in the area for business.  The lunch deals are pretty good and it beats Mickey D's.  But two visits in a row, a couple weeks apart, with the same experience, and ZERO response from management, and now I avoid it like the plague.  I generally would arrive 10-15 minutes before 12 to a fairly empty restaurant.  After being on the road all morning, my first stop is the bathroom.  On both of these visits, the same server was in the restroom, on her cell phone.  The first, time, I didn't know what to do, so I went ahead and ""went"".  The second time, I looked her in the eye and said, ""I'm sorry, I REALLY HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM"", and she stepped JUST outside the door. When I left the restroom, she was still on the phone.  That time, she also happened to be my server.  Now, I'm a nurse, and while I'm all about handwashing, I'm not paranoid about germs. But I do know the studies about the amount of ""spray"" from toilets, and since this girl was not in the bathroom for the typical reason, what are the chances she washed her hands?  And, how about just not making customers feel uncomfortable?  I don't like it when another customer is using the phone in the bathroom, let alone staff members. Clearly, she's not allowed to use it during work hours, and so ducks in the bathroom to do so. I wrote a letter to management, asked for a response, and got no response at all.  When I called the restaurant to ask for the manager's name, by the way, I had to go through three layers of flunkies to get it.  I told them in the letter that I would not be back until I was reassured that this would not happen in the future, and 6 months later, I've not changed my mind."
J. J.,"Chester County, PA",12,69,54,1.0,4/7/2012,"Just returned home from a terrible repeated experience. I would rate them a zero star if I could. Unfort there is nothing out this way and if you want something on the go or to dine out, this is one of few options.  Been going here off and on for 5 years, and each time gets worse. Glutton for punishment I suppose. Tonight we decided to go sit at the bar and dine for something quick since we didnt want to spend too much time out. A total of 4 people at the bar, and 2 bar tenders. AWFUL, non existant service. We had to ask to order drinks, ask to order appetizers, ask to order our meal. Ask for our BILL! Not once did the bartenders/servers say "" How is everything? Or, Can I get you anything else?"". First time in my life I have left zero tip. We will never return, if we want Chili's we will travel to the Downingtown location instead where we have always had better service. A call to management resulted in an apology and offer for compensation but I had not called and complained to obtain anything free. At least the manager seemed sincere."
Patrick W.,"Perryville, MD",1,95,,5.0,1/5/2013,Met my girlfriend there last night for dinner. This was our second visit to ths location. I will have to say this place was amazing! Got there just before 6 PM and the place was swamped. It countinued to be that way untill we left. Our server Samantha was a 10 out of 10! We never waited long for anyhting and the food was tops!
