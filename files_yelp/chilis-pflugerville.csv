Victoria G.,"Pflugerville, Austin, TX",1,25,9,5.0,9/17/2017,"This food is amazing. Brianna, my waitress, was from Cali. I'm an Austinite. Lol did I love her service e absolutely!! She is bubbily, honest, and sweet. I love her! Come here, ask for her and if she's not here enjoy the food, atmosphere and customer service. ALSO DONT DISCONTINUE THE FRIED CAULIFLOWER. LOL!"
Danny O.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,159,2,1.0,12/22/2017,"This location used to be really super good, but after my visit the other day I will take my business to another Chili's. After waiting almost 15 minutes for someone to seat me and my friend, I had to go and find someone. Also, my burger was dripping in grease. Which is not something that I would of expected at Chili's, I would expect that at fast food joints but not Chili's."
Steban D.,"Pflugerville, TX",17,73,15,4.0,6/21/2017,"I like the consistency at Chilis.  No matter which Chili's you go to you are going to get good service and tasty food.  I know some people have had bad experiences but i can't say that i have ever had a bad experience.  Food has always been hot and good, Drinks are cold and plentiful, and staff has been friendly and on point.   I also like that usually a manager will come around at the end of the meal and check on you.  If you are one of those people that had a bad experience and you didn't tell you waiter and you didn't tell the manager..then that's on you.   I really enjoy their chips and salsa.  The salsa is not spicy but i really enjoy the flavor of it.   I like taking advantage of the 2 for $22(it was $20), basically its 2 meals and a free app.  It works for me because the meals are what i eat burgers, chicken crispers, quesadilla.  My better half had their Carnitas the other night.  It was served on a hot skillet like fajitas with rice and black beans.  The was flavorful and not dry. We took some home and still had enough for another taco the next day."
Brandon J.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,6,6,1.0,10/6/2017,"Well, came in and sat in the bar. 2 tables had old plates, food, and flies. We sat for over an hour with flies bugging us and all over the bar. After an hour someone wanted to sit at one if the booths.  They cleaned 1 and left the other dirty..."
David S.,"Austin, TX",42,81,8,2.0,9/24/2017,Food gets worse every time we go. Probably won't be going anytime soon. Shame used to be a good place to go.
Jessica H.,"Allen, TX",0,3,,2.0,8/14/2017,"This place has gone downhill. The last couple times we had gone their, their was no hostess at the front to seat us. We sat for so long waiting for the hostess that we just went and sat in the bar area. Took another 10 minutes for a waiter. And even longer when the food came. Won't be back anytime soon. Too slow"
Angel D.,"Honolulu, HI",253,333,1370,5.0,12/30/2016,"First time eating here with my family and our experience was great. The service was excellent and the food was awesome! We decided to do the $22 for two for my fiance and my in-laws also did the same. It comes with one appetizer & two big entrees, so we chose their chips and salsa. For the entree we chose the bacon burger (comes with fries) and their bacon ranch chicken quesadillas (comes with sour cream, lettuce & pico de gallo.) Their burger was okay, kind of greasy, I think they put butter on top of the bun. The burger was a little hard to eat because it was over-cooked so the meat was tough. The fries were alright.. My in-laws got the Texas cheese fries (comes with bacon, jalapeno, ranch, green onions) -- it was really good! The two entrees they chose was the Margarita chicken which comes with black beans and rice & their steak and broccoli. Their sodas were bottomless so we got free refills & to-go cups as well. Happy with our experience here, can't wait to come back next time"
Josh D.,"Austin, TX",16,29,1,2.0,1/15/2017,"We've gotten to-go orders before to our satisfaction but my most recent visit for take out ruined that for me. I ordered a southern smokehouse burger, the way it comes with extra pickles. They replaced the smokehouse sauce with mustard and gave me 3, count em, 3 pickle slices. That's only extra if you get 1 or 2 normally. My wife ordered mashed potatoes with no green onions, and it even shows on the receipt. Guess what was on the potatoes?  A little attention to detail goes a long way."
Kimberly C.,"Round Rock, TX",0,6,2,1.0,11/19/2017,"Came in for a Caribbean salad. Had it here just a week ago and it was awesome, tonight was very much the opposite! When you pay $11+ for a salad, at the very least you want all the items in it menu. We got it to go and had to go back in 2x before I got the salad I actually ordered!!! Incompetent staff and lazy cook. Watch out and make sure you actually get what you pay for because they will not."
James C.,"Round Rock, TX",0,16,,2.0,12/16/2016,i go to Chili's all the time because my work is two minutes away. Lately they are short stuffed every time. Wait time is long and service is poor.  Yesterday i went and left a box of chocolates there. I called today and they put me on hold for more than 20 min. I hung up because i couldn't wait any longer.
Sam M.,"Hewitt, TX",5,15,7,1.0,2/11/2017,"The reviews of slow service or lack of staff were correct. We did come at linch time on the weekday, but it was surprisingly empty compared to other Chilis we go to. My wife mentioned the low average review score, I figured it can't be all that bad. We ordered Southwest egg rolls and turkey sandwich. Took an hour and a half to get our food. Food was delicious and hot/fresh, so it wasn't sitting under a heat lamp dying, just took the cooks that long to fry three egg rolls and assemble a sandwich. I see why it wasn't popular with the lunch crowd."
Andrew C.,"Taylor, TX",0,7,1,5.0,11/10/2016,"I go to chilies about once a month , The best seat in the house is at the bar !! Bar tender Jess is awesome !!! Super nice and makes you feel like your in the right place . Thanks jess for being so awesome!!!! Give this girl a raise !!!!!!!!"
Natalie W.,"Dallas, TX",0,27,12,2.0,3/16/2017,"Typical chilis. However I'll give you a tip, whenever ordering to go, the food is never ready when they say. If they say 20 minutes, give them 40. Im not exaggerating."
Shelesa Y.,"Pflugerville, TX",121,50,71,1.0,8/11/2016,My kids and I ate here tonight. It was crazy busy. No wait oddly but every table was occupied.  Server was kind and courteous. Food took awhile but not so long that my kids were impatient although my son ate more chips than anything and didn't want his pizza. So maybe that was a little long.  HOWEVER...my daughter and I are up queasy and I've already thrown up twice. We both were feeling ill immediately after walking through target to the point we cut our trip short AND skipped Andy's for ice cream. NO NINE YEAR OLD SKIPS ICE CREAM EVER!!!!!!  Totally food poisoning. No sleep in sight and I have an early morning. Thanks Chili's. I wish I looked to see this location had two stars before we ate
Robert K.,"Hutto, TX",577,54,107,4.0,7/2/2016,I much rather prefer this location to the hutto one. When my wife was pregnant she had some weird requests but chilis pflugerville was up to her pregnant tastebud challenge! They offer take out in which they will bring your food to your car! Nice and clean inside but the noise level usually seems loud
Shannon L.,"Austin, TX",44,31,10,1.0,8/13/2017,"Pflugerville is pretty limited on places to eat but do not go here. If you have to have Chili's then go to Tech Ridge.  I've had horrible service sitting inside. They've screwed up to go orders more than once and it takes an hour or more to get your incorrect order. Just go in the to go section and you always see frustrated people that have been waiting a ridiculous amount of time. My fiance and I were on our way home and thought we'd stop in for a drink. We even questioned if we should but literally said, it's just a drink how bad could they mess that up.  We sat at the bar and a few minutes later we still hadn't been greeted and another couple sits down next to us. A few more minutes and the bartender finally makes his way over and greets the other couple,  throws some napkins in our direction without acknowledging us and proceeds to chit chat with the girl, evidently she works there. We had time to discuss going somewhere else for a drink, get up from it seats before he even looked at us and I told him, we're good. He smiled, nodded and said, ok!  How about that customer service. Chili's, you already have so much competition in Austin, why shoot yourself in the foot? You have to step it up or the new Pflugerville will kick you out!"
Pete O.,"Pflugerville, TX",96,90,40,2.0,1/22/2016,"Great food, great atmosphere, but service needs to improve.  We have had hit or miss service, and the restaurant is still fairly new.  Wait times are not very long, especially if you use their app. However, once you sit down and the service starts, it can be fairly slow.  It can take up to 30 minutes to get your food, so go when you have time to wait."
Rachel H.,"Pflugerville, TX",108,6,1,1.0,10/26/2016,"Time and time AGAIN this is the easiest location for us to go to, but the service is HORRIBLE- We  thought it got better when the old GM left ..... but no- there is a female bartender that works days that is AWESOME  -and 1 or 2 regular servers that are great -  sadly over all its a FRUSTRATING experience to say the least 9 out of 10 times that we go here as a family our service is beyond FRUSTRATING - we are OFTEN left sitting with empty glasses, request for extra salsa aren't  acknowledged, ...... food comes out incomplete or wrong,  ......  we drive further to the Hutto or Round Rock locations just to get better service- it shouldn't have to be this way - we were told by some of the staff that things would be improving when the old general manager left and they got a new one  - by the way WHY did y'all stop serving butter with the baked potato soup? - isn't BUTTER something u put on a baked potato? YES then WHY did it go away????  also - butter goes on CORN and Broccoli ....... but sadly ....not at Chilis anymore - THANK God there is a Panera Bread and Target next door so that WHEN we DO want butter we just go get it - but what a HUGE pain in the BUTT"
Angela M.,"Hutto, TX",455,553,813,1.0,4/22/2015,"We have gone here a few times, we just keep getting sucked into coming back here even though it is terrible every time. They have a great location, their manager...needs to be fired though, because this is one of the most poorly run Chili's I have ever been to and the staff is all horribly disorganized. You know what you are getting with the food, so there usually aren't any surprises there. The time before we went here, the table next to us had about 30 cups and plates just sitting there for about 30-40 minutes and then someone came by and cleared off half of it and then still left the rest. Our server was nice but she seemed like her head was off in another place. This last time we went, we sat in the bar...there was a wait on a Thursday (man Pflugerville peeps, you love your Chili's). We got seated, ordered drinks...waitress who I believe was named JoLanna seemed pretty nice and competent to start off with, but it looked like she might have been the primary person waiting on the entire bar area. Horrible planning there. I like that they have the 2 for $20 meals because it is a great deal. We opted to get fajitas and soup and salad. Our friends got a burger and chicken fingers...nothing too crazy. We were sitting around, and waited for our drinks to get refreshed...at this point our server seemed to be getting very distracted and just all over the place, we had to ask multiple times for drink refills. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, and guess what...it was stone cold! My fajitas were NOT sizzling when they came out, burger was cold and chicken fingers were cold. She did not even bring out the soup and salad for my honey (I mean how hard is it to get that order out compared to everything else). We sat there for awhile longer before she finally came back and she said, ohhhh that's why the lady in the back said I needed to come back there and follow her out with the soup and salad..WOOPS. And she giggled about it and tossed her hair as if that would make it all OK, no apologies about it all and only excuses. But then, instead of going back to get it for him...she did her rounds and went and got another table a glass of wine before she got his food...just speechless on that. And he was starting to get a bit hangry and wanted to just send it all back, but I talked him down. The shift lead came by to ask how everything was and we said, well it would be fine if all of our food wasn't cold and the waitress was a bit more attentive. So we got a discount off the bill, she offered to re-fire the food and said she would make sure it didn't take forever to come out again but we passed on it all.  Our waitress finally comes by and asks again if she can get us a dessert...we just declined and joked with her that it would probably come out cold if it was supposed to be warm and warm if it was supposed to be cold. She giggled again and carried on, she did bag us some extra soups but it's not like that was going above and beyond what she could do with the unlimited soup and salad meal option. When we got home, my honey got pretty sick from something he ate, which was just soup and salad...so I am not sure what went wrong there. I really think if whomever is in charge around here takes some time to properly train the staff and maybe staffs a little bit more appropriately when they are busy then they would get better reviews. BUT, don't think it really matters because they will still always be packed due to their optimal location."
Christopher S.,"Pflugerville, TX",62,191,1293,1.0,5/2/2014,"New nice location. New design has great atmosphere. Unfortunately this is probably the worst Chili's I've ever been to. They got my son's dish wrong. Then after apologies, it took 45 minutes to get him the correct one. Server was trying but it's obvious this kitchen has issues. Manager came out and took one meal off the ticket but half the staff was standing around staring at the ceiling while others were obviously in need of some assistance. No one really seemed to care that service was slow and orders were wrong. The family next to us was also issued and apology about something with one of their orders, but couldn't hear the details.  I won't be coming back to this location. I generally like Chili's as a decent place to sit and hang with folks but this ruined our outing."
S G.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,6,2,1.0,1/22/2017,"Honey Chipotle wings dry, too chewy, over cooked, taste bad, OLD, and not worth the price."
Anil L.,"Round Rock, TX",1,35,11,4.0,12/8/2016,"This is my nieces favorite restaurant, end up almost every Sunday after church with family. Wish they had more vege entrees."
Christian B.,"Round Rock, TX",192,5,1,1.0,6/18/2016,"There's a reason why this particular Chili's has an average 2 star rating in contrast to other comparable options in the area or even other Chili's establishments. My family and I have given them multiple opportunities since we enjoy the atmosphere, menu and price of food chain itself but my recent experience at this particular establishment will also be my last.  Every single time we've come to this Chili's the service is abysmal. I don't have a high expectation coming in so I'm not someone that demands the type of service you'd get at a 4-star restaurant but when you have to wait over 5 minutes to have a server even come greet you after being seated during their slow period, then you know something's up.  Most people would assume it's a lack of available waiters or over-crowded rush hour but every time we've gone, we make sure to go in between 'rush' hours.  During our last visit, I saw waiters sitting in the back chit-chatting; again I'm not a uptight customer who doesn't want servers to have a quick breather but while we waited for our initial welcome none of the servers were even walking the floor to check on other patrons.  The hostess (who was not very friendly in greeting us to begin with) looked over at us a few times during our wait and didn't even come by to apologize.   We decided to walk-out, in full view of the manager in charge who didn't say anything either.  The visit before this last one, they got our order wrong and that was after they brought our orders out at different time intervals.  On top of that, we waited a relatively long time to even get the appetizers and chips we ordered.  Essentially, nothing about their service is redeemable. When we informed the manager, she just apologized and offered us a free dessert.  This is my first time writing a negative review of a chain restaurant on Yelp because I usually let a lot of these things roll off my back but this place is terrible.  Glad there's a Tex-Mex place right next door."
Kirsty M.,"Austin, TX",10,52,20,5.0,11/13/2016,"This location is really nice and new. Booths in good condition, nice lighting and tons of tvs! I had the nicest waitress I've had at any chilis. Their chips and salsa are so good and they even have a small selection of local beers at this location! Firemans 4 and 512 Pale Ale are what I remember. Most chilis are the same, but this one is definitely nicer than most and I recommend it to anyone in the area. If you don't want to wait come before 6 or get in line with their app!"
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,3.0,6/24/2015,"I ate at the bar. The waitress was excellent. I enjoyed the peace, quiet and television. My salad was great, full of fresh veggies, onion, carrots, cheese, croutons. The dessert was delicious. The perfect blend of toffee caramel and chocolate. The smoked wings were very disappointing. You can see the picture from the menu, nice darker and crispy looking, vs what I got, very lightly color broiled looking wings. I thought the waitress bought me the wrong order. She assured me she did not. I was very upset, but I ate them. They were okay, tasted like over broiled, so they were healthy."
Ron C.,"Cedar Park, TX",34,3,1,1.0,12/10/2016,"Worst chilis in the area. Staff is poorly trained. One hostess to clean tables, check people in, answer the phone. Sat 3 other couple before use and then sat us at the table that had been open since we walked in. There is no manager in sight. Staff have a booth they take there breaks in and use there phones at but lord forbid they seat customers during the rush or bus the tables. And to top it off the beer taps are down. Why did I even bother waiting to get seated. If you are thinking about stopping in here do so at your own risk. You have been warned."
Art M.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,1,1.0,2/28/2016,"Who doesn't have chips for chips and salsa, then no fries. Oh wait it gets better we ask for corn on the Cobb and out of it too!!!!! Wow come on chili's step up your game!!! It's Sunday night at 9 and you are out of basic restaurant food"
Courtney N.,"Pflugerville, TX",45,6,1,1.0,10/14/2016,"Bathrooms were horrendous, toilet paper all over the toilets and floor, soap and wet paper towels all over the sink. White queso was so thick it was unable to be ate as a dip, chips were decent but hot sauce was not very tasty either. Sirloin steak steak very dry and came without garlic butter as advertised, skillet potatoes only decent things we received.  while food being hot isn't something I feel I should complain about nothing was edible until it had sat out for 5-10 minutes, even kids meals. Won't visit this location again. Staff seems to be all high school aged, didn't see any staff that appeared to be over 20 years old."
Jeremy A.,"Pflugerville, TX",3,156,46,4.0,1/13/2016,Our second time here and it was pretty good.   I had the salmon and my wife had the tilapia.   Father in law had a big burger and it was all good.   The waitress was friendly and it was a good experience.
Ariana P.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,41,8,3.0,6/24/2016,"The bathrooms here are disgusting! Don't risk it! Never paid much attention to the floor but the booth felt grimy and the window was covered in finger prints as well as the little Ziosk (device with games/menu/etc) I enjoy the chilis points quite a bit but I went today and was never offered napkins, to go box, or a refill. I like Chilis but don't think I will come back to this location. Drive 15 minutes to the La Frontera area Chilis."
Danielle D.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,16,3,3.0,8/22/2016,We stopped in here for dinner tonight. From the get go the serving teamwork was excellent with Amanda our server at the lead!! The only downfall was how long it took for the food to come out of the kitchen!! The servers kept apologizing for the delay and made sure the drinks were refilled. If it wasn't for the great service from Amanda we would probably never come back again!! So we'll give it a try again in the future but will want Amanda taking care of us!!! Thanks Amanda!!!
Daniel R.,"Austin, TX",64,3,,1.0,5/24/2016,"It's not the first, second, third time, this happens every single time I go there. Every time after 2-3 months without go because always is a bad experience. When you arrive there that takes at least 10 minutes for someone order a drink for you, than 10 more minutes to bring the drinks (from the bar), if you order appetizers that always arrives with the food, if you re order a drink that will show up after you already left the restaurant. I'm just writing this add because my last visit was a surprise, the waiter brought me some chips and red sauce, I didn't ask or eat, when the check came, they charged $3.49 for that. Unbelievable."
Angela H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,25,,1.0,4/17/2017,"Went on Easter.  They weren't too busy; again, the issue is with service.  Bartenders disappear and food takes forever to get out of the kitchen.  We ordered a house salad to take home and it took nearly 15 minutes.  We had planned to stay longer but didn't; we left and went somewhere else."
Sunitha H.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,"We ordered a simple to-go order of veggie burger, Cheese fries, and fajitas last night. First, the fries for the burger was forgotten, next the extra tortillas  - which we checked and reminded them. However, we hardly ate the extra tortillas coz they were quite hard and stretchy. Fajitas were totally incomplete - We weren't given the sides: tomatoes+onion, guacamole, cheese; only since we requested sour cream, we got that. Basically, we had to remind them of everything, in order to get them. Extra ranch for the cheese fries was also missed. This is just not we expect of Chili's since we have always received great food and service at the North Lamar location comparatively, where we don't have to pull out and check everything that we've ordered before bringing it home."
Paige B.,"Round Rock, TX",0,8,,1.0,3/22/2017,"We have been quite a bit over the last 3 years and this Chili's location has rapidly declined in customer service. The service was slow, dirty dishes were not removed at all, parts of one order was served at different times during the hour and half we were there, and worst of all we were served a single portion of fajitas to share instead of being served a portion for two share as we originally ordered. When we complained to a manager about the single portion, she was rude and disrespectful. We will never come to this location again."
A. C.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,6,,1.0,12/27/2016,"0 stars here. I wanted to make a to go order and the whole interaction was terrible. Took 4 calls to actually have someone pick up. Waited 15 minutes on hold before I could make a to go order. I'm sure you're thinking-why did you wait 15 minutes on the phone, dummy? The answer is that I actually drove to the Chili's and was staying on hold to see if someone would answer before I got there. Not joking, someone answered as I was walking in. I'm not sure if that's funny or sad. Probably both. So, I complain to the Manager that it should never take 4 phone calls OR 15 minutes on hold to place a to go order and his response was ""I'm sorry sir, I apologize for the lack of service. Can I offer you a drink while you wait or maybe a free appetizer?"". Haha and George Strait's got ocean front property in Arizona. He actually said ""Sorry man, we're just busy. I had a line cook call in and a few servers not show up so do you still want food or not?"" In the most annoyed tone possible.  I've been managing for over a decade and I can say from experience that you should never throw your team under the bus or make excuses for poor performance. The whole experience was awful and the only reason I write this review is because I hope that people read this and don't waste their precious time or money here. When there are major issues at the top of the chain I can guarantee that there are issues at the bottom. AKA who knows how they handle food/sanitation etc.. Try another Chili's in the area or another restaurant altogether. I should've listened to the 92 reviews before this one-don't make the same mistake."
D R.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,20,1,5.0,1/27/2017,"I'm giving them five stars because of their General Manager, Mario. I came in to dine and had a lot of questions and limitations due to food allergies. Our server couldn't answer any of our questions so she went and got Mario. He patiently answered all of my questions and when it looked like I wasn't going to be able to dine there, Mario offered to make my burger through the oven and not on the grill where it could be tainted by other foods I was allergic to. I could not believe it! He even was so thoughtful to include a veggie that he knew would not be seasoned with anything. I cannot say enough about how grateful I am that on a busy Friday night, He went more than the extra mile for a customer."
A. Y.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,2,,3.0,3/1/2017,Busy Friday nite but the wait time after getting on the list was decent. The waitress was very good.  This is only a 3 star because of the hair we found in the food that was brought out by someone other than our waitress.
Bill L.,"Pflugerville, TX",177,37,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Until this restaurant hires enough servers, I will never set foot inside this place again. Horrible place."
Matt P.,"Austin, TX",35,88,46,2.0,5/8/2014,"As alluded to in other reviews, I am not a chain restaurant guy. However, this Chilis is one of the closest sit down joints from my house, so I've been here 4-5 times.  Also, when my give a damn is busted and the diet is thrown out the window, nothing scratches the itch like chili cheese fries and sliders.  I've had cold fries, barely warm chili, bad service, empty water and dirty dishes in front of me til I paid and left.  I've also had killer margaritas, great service and good food here too.  My diagnosis? Complete and utter failure in management in this place. Can't find a manager with a search warrant, sections and servers are out of whack, seems like the front and back of the house have little to no communication.  Seen the bar go down (more than once) cause of only one bartender (no manager in sight). Seen people wait at tables to be greeted or get drinks for 5-10 minutes (more times than I can count). I don't think it's unfixable by any means, I just think Chilis and their mega corporation should get their head out of the sand and give a brand new restaurant all the tools it needs to succeed until it can do it on its own.  The moral? The bad outweighs the good, so eat here at your own peril. For now at least."
