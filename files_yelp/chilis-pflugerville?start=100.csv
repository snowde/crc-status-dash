Kelvin L.,"South Padre Island, TX",93,29,,1.0,9/7/2013,"Tried to eat there 9pm this Saturday night. Restaurant was half empty but we were told 30 minute wait as kitchen was backed up. You would hope a new place would want to make a more positive impact. Staff were rude, disinterested and would not even let us sit in the bar. We left without waiting. First and last visit. We ended up in Morelias across the street and had a nice meal.  Would give zero stars if I could."
Rob B.,"Austin, TX",31,11,2,4.0,3/14/2014,For a Chili's this place is great. The bar area is nice and has a lot of TV's to watch the game. The staff is friendly and never had any problem with the food or drinks.
Edgar C.,"Round Rock, TX",48,15,,3.0,11/21/2013,Ordinary food! Mediocre Service. I waited for a cup of water for at least 15 min. I was ready to walk out after waiting 25 min for a to box. Better be glad I left 25% tip. I was seriously debating in cutting it in half.
N H.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,11,,2.0,9/7/2013,"Ok, this IS Chili's, so I'm not expecting a lot, but this place takes the cake. My husband and I went there a few weeks ago, and we were attended by so many servers we lost count, yet we could never find anyone to flag down. I know they're training, but the flocks of trainees hovering around was stifling. When we asked our first server how his day was going, his response was ""meh."" We didn't see him again. The steak was the most bland and soft I've ever had in my life, and our dessert came out no fewer than 30 minutes after we ordered it. One of our servers explained that the cook botched our dessert and she made him make it again after he tried to send it out to us. I appreciate her honesty, but we could stand to be comped for a cake that was still overcooked and bland after we waited half an hour. I also stopped by for lunch takeout the other day, as the burger that I'd had at another Chili's location was really good, but again, the burger was so bland I threw much of it away. (!!! I never throw food away!) If not the worst burger I've ever had, it was pretty close. The so-called ""pepper gravy"" provided for the mashed potatoes was reminiscent of... well... something I'd rather not think about while eating white gravy. D: Threw that out too. Bottom line: don't order any beef, or you will be disappointed."
Tiffany L.,"Spicewood, TX",66,113,25,3.0,11/17/2013,It's a nice place. It's a chain so you know what exactly to expect. The service is good and of course the food is Chili's standard. Nothing to complain about here.... :D
Amanda M.,"Sammamish, WA",0,26,,2.0,1/18/2015,Very slow service the 3 times I've been here.   Even when I have gone when it's not busy we have waited 45-50 minutes to get our food.  Food has been pretty good but not great enough to fight through the service.  Wait staff is friendly enough but would seem to disappear when we needed refills or the check.  My kids declared this a place we should not go back to because the food took so long.
Private P.,"Pflugerville, TX",96,12,,1.0,4/5/2015,"I have given this place many chances hoping for improvement considering its a chain. Unfortunately, it seems to have just never quite got on its game. The servers are always friendly and nice, BUT the service is extremely slow and 4 out of 5 times we have either not been served what we ordered or it was cold. We drive into either RR or Hutto if we want Chili's which is a shame since it's so close!"
Scott T.,"Pflugerville, TX",69,205,4,4.0,10/22/2013,"They have a great bar with 3 nice big Tv's, the bartenders are always great and they have good apps and burgers. I used to give my older brother a hard time about getting food to go but since having a little one this has been great. We have picked up food twice and have been pleased both times. I like the burgers and my wife gets the mango tilapia. For bar food you cant beat bonelss wings."
Britta B.,"Pflugerville, TX",39,53,24,3.0,11/2/2013,"It's a Chili's, they are all the same, not bad, not great. My husband had the pretzel appetizer though and he was a very happy camper. It was so very busy for midweek dinner, so the service was pretty slow, but decent. We go to Chili's when we want a good drink, because they do have pretty decent mixes!"
Michelle R.,"Round Rock, TX",0,11,,1.0,1/28/2016,"Chili's as a whole has declined horribly in the past few years. It makes me sad, it used to be one of my favorite places to eat. After having an awful experience at the Hutto location (slimy lettuce, food that had obviously been sitting out for a looooong time, multiple mistakes on our orders, etc....), we decided to try this one at Stone Hill. Sadly, the experience was no better. We arrived shortly before six thirty. We were seated immediately, which was great. However, it then took over an HOUR for our food to be delivered to our table, and when it arrived it was cold, my husband's salmon was burnt so badly it was almost inedible, and it looked (and tasted) like my enchiladas had been sitting out for at least twenty minutes. We didn't want to waste any more time since our kids were hungry, so we just ate and asked for our check. It took another THIRTY minutes for our waiter to come back with the check after that. We didn't get out of there until about 8:15 pm. Almost two hours! The food was not worth the price, it was cooked horribly and the service is just lacking way too much to justify the frustration of going again. Please get it together Chili's! You used to be great!"
Bob F.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,7,,1.0,12/13/2014,"3 out of our last 4 meals here:  45 minute wait, though not real busy; hot food served cold, though not busy, and strike 3 tonight, told at 4:45 PM, though not busy, couldn't seat 6 adults, 3 children and a high chair because it would back up the kitchen.  We were told we could wait 25-30 minutes to be seated.  Though, if two parties of 5 had arrived, they would have seated them.  If you like Chilis, go elsewhere."
Blkman C.,"Pflugerville, TX",15,37,,1.0,1/1/2014,bad bad bad waited 45 min for meal will never go back rite name for thes place chilis cause when u get your food it's cold than a M.F
Chasity P.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,,2.0,2/16/2014,"I have a hard time judging this place because of the limited number of restaurants in the area. I DO encourage the management team to staff servers, busters and kitchen staff based on crowd. Every time I come in, I have to wait in many open tables at the bar and there is a 20 minute wait on all tables. Today, looked around, there were open tables in restaurant side and bar..soo I asked..response we don't like to overwhelm the kitchen. Seriously. .I'm now at russos."
