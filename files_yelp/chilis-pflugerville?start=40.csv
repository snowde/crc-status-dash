Nicki D.,"Round Rock, TX",276,426,1167,5.0,7/25/2014,"I am SO glad we gave Chilis another shot last night!! We debated between them & Morelia, and I said ""one more try""! Honestly, it turned out perfect!  We were there at 9pm, so well after the dinner rush. Got seated quickly, Cianna is so sweet. Our server Michael showed up pretty quickly & really took care of us! Customer service was 5-stars. A few times something was messed up, lemon in my tea which I asked to not have, he fixed it right away, brought unsweetened tea when I wanted sweet-but I think he was surprised by that mistake too. Someone didn't sweeten the tea. But he fixed it, pretty much came over to let me know he wants to swap it out. My sons salad had croutons, asked to not have them, but my son didn't care after all. So there was a bit of messing up, but he apologized every time & fixed it promptly. We didn't wait for anything.  Appetizers came out quickly & timed perfectly with our dinners. The spinach dip was muuuuch better this time than last & the cheese fries were delish!!  My boys had mac n cheese, generous portions I might add. One son had a salad, again generous & the other a corn on the cob (full cob). They were stuffed!  I noticed no Bleu Cheeseburger on the menu, so when I asked if they had Blue Cheese crumbles to add, Michael was like ""oh absolutely!"" So I ordered the bacon cheddar burger & the BC was in a cup for me to add. It honestly was a damn good burger! Surprised the hell out of me! Cooked perfectly, seasoned well, juicy & pretty big.  The winner was these table top ""tablets"" I guess you can call them. They feature the menu & a few other options, but they're loaded w games! Restaurant + children + wiggles + tablets... Easiest dinner experience ever!  Worth coming back for!"
Leslie H.,"Pflugerville, TX",123,425,98,2.0,3/24/2015,"My husband and I love Chili's overall in general.  They have come leaps and bounds with their menu and offer a wide variety of options to choose from.  Chili's locations are hit or miss when it comes to service, but this one by far is definitely miss. With it being a major restaurant chain in the middle of a tri-town area (Pflugerville, Round Rock, Hutto), it is constantly packed and I don't think we've ever gone there when there wasn't a wait.  This is probably the only ""sports bar"" within any minimal distance so have fun trying to watch the game in the bar if that's your plan.  Service is typically slow, and this last time was no different except the waitress actually knew every bit about the menu (kuddos to her).  They have these kiosks on the table where you can reorder drinks and even pay your tab so you don't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to bring the check, and my husband had the bright idea to pay the bill before we were finished eating.  This meant getting a to go box was next to impossible. So to summarize, the food is generally pretty decent (however I do not recommend the steak or the smoked potatoes), service here is not good, prepare to wait for a table, and don't pay until you no longer need anything from your waitstaff.  I think we'll head over the Chili's in Round Rock from now on."
David R.,"Pflugerville, TX",5,12,,2.0,12/24/2016,"Ordered dinner for take out for my family.  The order was placed at 6:00PM, I was told order would be ready at 7:00PM.  I sent my son to pick it up at 7:00PM, and when he arrived at ~ 7:10 was told it would not be ready for another 1/2 hour.  I believe the hour they quoted was plenty of time and feel this restaurant was inconsiderate of my sons time.   I found the food to be average, but in my opinion, the service is terrible.  I will not use this Chilies for take out service going forward."
Jtoma F.,"Pflugerville, TX",5,38,8,4.0,5/19/2016,"Its my local place to eat when I want to sit down with the kiddos and my honey. I have had a few mishaps but for the most part, they offer the food with decent service. Like I said, there were nights when the wait was long, but thats unavoidable if 60 people show up all of a sudden on a Tuesday night."
Kristi P.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,14,5,2.0,5/1/2016,"Service a bit slow, consistently something wrong with food. Tonight I got a bonus saran wrap piece in my slightly wilty salad.  Not an apology or comp one.  Won't be back unless there's nothing else."
Denise D.,"Pflugerville, TX",42,120,8,1.0,12/8/2015,"We gave them the benefit of the doubt while new, but we'll never go back. Our server must have forgotten to put our order in because we waited 45 minutes for our food before the manager showed up to say it had to be recooked. Our waitress never returned after taking our order. We had to beg another server for drink refills. I know this is a fast food place but the terrible service inexcusable. They have been open long enough to get it together, clearly they don't care."
Lindsay B.,"Destin, FL",57,465,608,2.0,1/29/2014,"Oh, Chili's what has happened to you? You used to be a reliably good place to eat. Fajitas, burgers, chips & salsa, chicken crispers, southwest egg rolls. Oh, you were so good! And then something happened to you. Something that made you sad, maybe mad. But why take it out on your customers by making your once-good food...suck? We've had a long go of it, Chili's, but I feel that it is time we part ways. No more will memories of past goodness warp my decision making.  The last straw? This week's dinner visit. Chips and salsa to start off with. Chips were the same as always (good), but the salsa is different. Boo. I ordered an Old Timer, and it was good enough, nothing special. The fries tasted like and felt like they had been sittin' under the ol' heat lamp for a while. My husband got the Triple Decker/Dipper? app thing. Now, my husband puts up a fight whenever I've wanted Chili's but he gave in this time pretty easily (he's sick now with a cold, so his lack of clear-headedness is explained now) and he still complained that his food sucked. I tried a southwest eggroll from his plate and it was just gross. So disappointing.  What's funny is that the two other booths in our section both complained to the manager about their food. Funny or sad.... Oh, two stars because the chips were good, and because the restaurant itself is nice and clean. Our awkward waitress who stared and talked too loud at us was nice, if not a little scary."
Ryan C.,"Austin, TX",39,46,90,2.0,5/3/2015,"Came in to eat and the bartender had quit that night but was still serving customers. She was being rude, slamming shots in front of children, etc. I've come into this Chili's before for beer and mediocre food, but never again."
Mike V.,"Round Rock, TX",154,137,1672,2.0,8/21/2013,"If I ran a national food cain restaurant, and we have a grand opening, I would be sure NOT to have the grand opening until all of my employees are trained properly. I took the family to the new Chili's last week, and did not expect to have the experience we had. We started off with 2 appetizers, which didn't come out until our dinner arrived. When dinner arrived 45 minutes after ordering it, each entree came out at different times. One in our party didn't even get what she ordered! The server blamed it on someone stealing her order, and was very appologetic through the whole ordeal. We really knew there was a major problem when the 4 other tables around us, had very similar problems. It seemed like all of the customers were pissed. After a while it became comical. Everything was so wrong, that all we could do was laugh! We also joked that we were on a reality t.v show and were being punked. It was like, lets see how many ways we can mess these people's orders up before they walk out! I have 2 positives for this place, hence the 2 stars.. The hostesses were very polite and orginized, and the beer was good, once we got em."
Megan T.,"Pflugerville, TX",28,23,30,1.0,11/7/2015,"It's right around the corner from my house, but I won't go to this one anymore. Staff gets a drink and something 'to do' and takes over the booth by the bathrooms. It takes an extraordinary amount of time to even get drinks. Food consistently takes 30-40 minutes to come out. That's for 3 adults and 1 kid, Not even a big party. The kitchen has never run right at this location. Management is non existent. Frustrating experiences. Won't be back to this one."
Denise F.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,44,,2.0,4/14/2016,"We eat at Chili's in Stonehill probably twice a month. I really like their food (when it's done right), but something's going on over there and I don't know what. It seems that on every visit, there's at least one thing wrong.  For example, 2 visits ago, I got the grilled chicken Caribbean salad. My chicken was clearly under cooked. Management made it right - comped my salad and I got a free dessert. Last night, my son ordered a burrito. The rest of us got our food, but he did not. The manager said they goofed on his burrito and were redoing it. It's always something! Plus, the service is EXTREMELY SLOW! We get seated pretty fast, but it's while we wait for our food that seems to take forever.  The wait staff are all great, we feel like we are getting to know them almost, but they really need to fix whatever is going on in the kitchen. Maybe they are understaffed, don't know... We really like Chili's, but if this keeps happening, we will have to find a new favorite place to eat (and we really don't want to). Please Chili's, take note of this!! Please listen to your regular customers!! One plus... love the mini molten cake! It's perfect for one person."
Ciera M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/21/2015,"Online order stated it would be ready for pick up at at 10:45 (confirmed in the email sent to me). However, apparently they close at 10:30, and when I arrived they would not let me in to pick up my order. HORRIBLE flaw in the online site for allowing this to happen! And (I believe the manager) Kyle was very rude over the phone when I called about it!  Too many other good places to eat nearby with great service. Won't return to this Chili's again after this. Waste of time!!!!"
Neekie R.,"Round Rock, TX",55,60,195,1.0,9/25/2015,"Waiting 15 minutes for a server... No thank you. Leaving. ""I'm sorry about that,"" from hostess... Worthless."
Anna S.,"Austin, TX",81,131,3,2.0,1/9/2015,"To be honest I've never dined in, due to the reviews regarding the service. As well I'm done with this location due to my take-out experiences. I'm pretty sure this is Pflugerville Location's policy, to review your take-out order by opening every single take-out container to show you the food. To be frank I HATE this beyond belief.  The reasons I order carry-out : 1. I don't want to dine-in 2. Don't want to eat there 3. Want to eat in the peace of my own home So what indicates that I want you to open my hot food and show it to me before I leave. Your letting out all the warmth. Just review the ticket with me, or here's a bright idea take the order correctly and you should not worry about ticket errors.  I've only order out of pure convenience, due to Stone-Hill is across the street from Kelly Lane. But I've taken the higher road aka I-35 to their carry-out service and will be frequenting Parmer Lane instead. They've never let me down, nor opened my warm food to confirm the order is correct. Because they don't make ticket errors.  Bye Craig..."
Kellan B.,"College Station, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/25/2016,There is only one server we've ever had at this restaurant that has provided good service. He has longer hair and is so nice and courteous. The rest of the servers I've had are lackadaisical about their jobs and don't seem like they're working for tips at all. The food is great but Jesus the service is horrendous. I will drive to the Hutto location in the future.
Curt C.,"Pflugerville, TX",69,12,,1.0,3/18/2016,"This review is for the to go service. I've had no issues inside the restaurant. The to go service is terrible. There were 3 people standing in the area when I went in and none came over to ask if I needed help. I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to get me help. When he asked one of the girls to assist me she flat out said no and that he should get ""Amanda"".  This isn't the first time I've had issues with the to go area at this chilis. I've had orders that were missing sides and condiments and the service is always bad. Luckily I don't get food from here very often and now the frequency will be much less, if at all. Get your act together chilis."
Joey G.,"Austin, TX",1,2,,1.0,3/13/2016,Took an hour and a half to get our food. Then the order was wrong. The manager gave us excuses about losing kitchen staff and a bad supplier. I'll never eat their again.
Holly R.,"Pflugerville, TX",96,33,11,3.0,10/11/2015,Eh...its Chili's. We only go if we have a great coupon or they're running a special! Watermelon margaritas are good. Steaks are pretty tough chewing so I'd pass and stick to a burger or the quesadilla salad!
Beverly C.,"Hutto, TX",1,8,3,1.0,7/30/2016,"The service is awful. It started when we arrived at our freshly cleaned table and there was a pickle from the last person. Pointed it out, and the host still just walked away. Took 15 minutes before acknowledged by waitress and another 15 for drinks. The queso tasted weird and watered down. Took 25 minutes to get a margarita and never got refill of water. Had to clear out our own plates to make room. This has to be the worst Chilis I have ever gone to. There is no expectation of service or pride."
AJ M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,2.0,7/28/2016,"I've never had a good experience here. The hosts/hostesses are never friendly. The service is generally below average. And the restrooms are not clean. If I had to say one good thing, the small portion sizes are commensurate with the low prices."
