Jodie K.,"Pflugerville, TX",8,27,2,1.0,7/25/2014,"Awful, awful, awful!!! I have given them numerous second chances due to the proximity to work/home... but after my last visit, I am officially done!!! During the week, one single bartender works the take out and entire bar. Food is always cold... so I gave up on the take out as well. She is sweet and always apologizes, but I always end up waiting for about 15 minutes every visit!!! My last dine in experience:  First off, I noticed that there was an alarm ""silenced"" on their fire alarm the moment I walked in the door (Smoke- RTU ""Roof Top Unit""). I have a similar system at work, but I think they should have that looked at and properly reset... just a liability waiting to happen. Then, I waited at the hostess stand for 15 minutes without being greeted by ANYONE. Two waiters refused to make eye contact... it was obvious that they just finished two big top tables and they had no interest in serving me and my two children. I should also note this was around 4 p.m. on a Sunday so the restaurant was virtually empty. I was obviously an inconvenience to most of the staff. Once we were finally seated, we were sat near the server kiosk. I got to overhear two waitresses cussing about their (lack of) tips... my children overheard this conversation as well. Food was slightly below average but I must commend our waitress. She was the only good part of my visit. I tried to enter my complaint on the Zoosk machine but it locked up on me. Frustrated, I left. I should add that the Zoosk machine is a great concept, but they need to find a better way to sanitize them... greasy fingerprints all over the one at our table. It was so bad that I had to go wash my hands after paying my bill on it. YUK!!!!"
Odie O.,"Pflugerville, TX",341,268,942,3.0,9/18/2014,"I think its funny that when you read the comments on Chilli's, almost all of them start with...Gotta give them a second chance, maybe a third, maybe a fourth... I dont know... I haven't been to a chilli's in over a decade, no joke. IT has to do with.... well everything, food not cooked right, cold fries, bad service, long wait times for easy items.... anyway... I dont know why I agreed to go with Joy C. when she suggested a quick bite, moment of weakness I guess.... I wish I was still one of those people that had really low standards and didnt give two shakes of a lambs tail about pesky details like quality and follow thru with service. Some things at chilli's has changed, the decor is a little updated from the late 90's vibe, there are ipads at the tables to close out your tab or order more drinks, desserts or simply be online.... I guess they needed something to distract you from how bad they are doing.... This particular visit was a fast one, we were in there for less than 30 minutes, but in that time, I got cold fries, a no follow thru on a request of Mustard, from a manager mind you, and a over sized-should have been sliced up piece of chicken in a pretzel bun that fell apart as soon as I bit in to it. Joy C. Tacos were shrimp with some funky BBQ/Chipotle sauce which wasnt bad, but it was interesting to say the least. Look Overall I will probably not set foot in a Chilli's for another decade, if ever, and the fact that I can continue to ignore the one closest to me, regardless of how new it looks, kind of gives me a sense of satisfaction...."
Megan M.,"Austin, TX",3,53,12,1.0,6/20/2015,Currently writing this from my toilet. When I go to Chili's I usually order a baked potato soup. I have never had a problem until going to this location. I've ordered it a handful of times here and have gotten diarrhea twice. Avoid.
Sonja G.,"Pflugerville, TX",5,15,28,5.0,11/12/2014,"Great service ,food and atmosphere.Chili's offers free   for Veterans! IF you are kooking for a great juicy burger with tap beer for a gret value, Chilis is a perfect place to dine.The food  taste and presentation are exceptional."
Devon G.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,19,,1.0,7/23/2016,"I have found Chili's as a whole has declined over the years, however this location takes the cake. We were seated by a hostess who clearly didn't want to be there. Our waitress was decent, and that is being nice, and the food....barf! The feel of the whole place screamed of unhappiness. We gave take out a second chance a month later and we waited a good 5 minutes for the to go person to ""search"" for our order....while it sat on the counter in front of us just out of reach. When we flagged her down to ask her if the food sitting on the counter was ours the response was ""oh yeah."" No apology. We will never be back."
Linda B.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/7/2015,"I am giving this place one star because there is not a 0 star option.  I live in the area and was excited ot see the place open.  I have tried to dine or meet there 4 times now.   The first time the bartender licked her fingers after cutting limes.  Gross.  She did it twice.  And she and the other bartender were simply rude.  Not unattentive but, rude.   I tried it again and saw another bartender taking her bandaid off and sucking on her finger and then reaching for the food to hand to a customer.  Arrgh.   I took my Mother back one day and the service is just terrible.  And the food was not very good at all.  I was so disappointed.  I spoke to the manager when they ""forgot"" our order and the manager did not really seem to care.  I will not go back in this Chili's.  I opt for the one at 35 & Parmer.  They are always nice, friendly and appreciate YOU as a client.  Brent is a grea manager at that location."
Cindy R.,"Temecula, CA",31,81,60,1.0,4/21/2014,"Went here last week with my family and well..it disappointed us. We should have listened to the reviews on Yelp though it was closer to where we lived and the reviews on the other Chili's we frequented were not well but always had a good experience..though with this particular Chili's, this was not the case. We arrived around 6:30 or so only to have my husband stand in front of the hostess podium as he was totally ignored for at least 5-10 minutes. It was as if he was invisible, running around like their heads were cut off. After they seated a few others, and other people arriving to the restaurant they finally got to him and said, 'is your name on the list?"" uh..he was standing there for quite some time WAITING to be put on the list! The wait time given to us was a 25 minute wait while there were quite a bit of empty and dirty tables waiting to be cleaned.  We were finally seated..our server was quite attentive at first then we started to see less and less of him..then making it hard to flag him down since we didn't know where the heck he had disappeared off to. Did not know if he was on break or what. The food was okay though the fries given to all of us seemed to be old and sitting out under a heat lamp. Bacon in the burgers were flimsy and not worth eating as it wasnt even crispy. Not sure if it was because it took so long to get that it was just sitting under a heat lamp the whole time or what but Yuck.. Cleanliness of the place...is so-so..I've noticed a lot of tables were never cleared unless they really needed a table to seat people. There was even a table across from us that was dirty the entire time. And that was quite a bit of time as slow as the service was. We were there for almost 2 hours and the table was never cleared off. Will we be coming to this Chili's again? No..I think we will go back to the Chili's off of Louis Henna instead as we have never had a problem at that location. New location doesn't always mean good. Ugh..oh well.."
Kim S.,"Pflugerville, TX",79,294,29,4.0,7/14/2014,"Went here last night.  Okay...this is really not so much about the food...it was more about the entertainment of the evening...but the food was great for what it was...and we were there at the tail end of the night...9 pm...so for the food to still be yummy and fresh, I was at least impressed with that from a chain restaurant. My friend happened to know one of the waitstaff from when he was a kid---Robert.  Really nice kid...say hi to him, he's fixin' to work the bar.  Our server's name was Kim...same as mine, easy to remember...was also wearing the same watch as me...HA!!  At any rate, so my dinner friend and Robert start chatting and that was the end of it...we became Grand Table Central!!  LOL   It was an absolute HOOT!!!  All of the servers came out to play at our table...everyone was sitting with us, chatting, sharing stories, videos...it was quite fun/funny.  I was only hoping the manager did not get upset with all the young kids coming to play with us.  For what it's worth, I don't think it would have been like this if my friend did not know one of the servers, but...it was really fun...the folks were super nice...the food was served hot, the drinks cold, and we were totally entertained after a long long day at the pool---we will def come back at some point.  :)   Thanks for makin' our night, kids!  :)"
James F.,"Elgin, TX",12,10,5,1.0,3/12/2014,"Ok so here is the scoop on this place: 1. We arrive to a 25 minute wait on a Wednesday evening...ok it's in a shopping mall. The odd thing is there was about six or seven dirty empty tables and no one was working to clean them the entire time we were waiting.  2. Several people were seated before us but came in after us. The staff claimed they had called in ahead of time but wouldn't you think they would have been sat immediately? Maybe it's the sour taste already in my mouth. 3. About 25-30 minutes later we are seated. My wife and I are now in a little hurry so we have already decided what we wanted so that we can get this done in one big swoop. Problem here is that we now wait for another ten minutes and no one comes to our table at all. No drink order, nothing! 4. The table next to us is now complaining about the food. Everything was cold from what I could hear. Finally, after waiting 25 minutes up front, 10 minutes at the table, not being served and told the reason why they were not seating quickly is because they didn't want to overwhelm their staff in a half empty restaurant, we left and will probably not go back. I have been a cook and waiter. Never have I heard such an excuse for a wait. On top of it all, don't their wait staff double team tables? Epic fail!  Chic-fil-A here we come."
Bryan H.,"Pflugerville, TX",13,20,1,1.0,1/5/2014,"My second time to a Chili's. Also; it was my last. The staff was friendly enough but, the place was a wreck! Obviously a careless manager to allow his / her establishment to host patrons in such squalor. The wait for the food was quite lengthy...as if it was prepared at another location and brought in by mule train. The quality of food? No. No quality. It's microwaved food. You could get a better burger at Jack in the Crack. The ribs were like cardboard. Absolutely horrible."
Amy C.,"Hesters Crossing Shopping Center, TX",2,4,4,1.0,4/12/2015,"Lots of problems here. First off, watch your step walking in. The floors are slippery. Second the bar area stinks like it was ""cleaned"" with a dirty towel and mop. The service was not great. It took 10 mins before our waitress arrived to see if we wanted anything to drink. Then once we ordered drinks we ordered an appetizer, which then came 5 mins before our meal. Some of the food that came out was cold and whatever you do don't get the top shelf enchiladas. Horrible! Our waitress disappeared often enough for our drinks to go empty on multiple occasions. On top of that, we had to ask for silverware and napkins. Oh, and be careful when u order as well; the menus were so dirty it's like some child ate all over the menu. The ziosks could also use a cleaning...but hopefully not with the dirty rag from the bar!   Table 52/1 Ticket ID 5242898"
John M.,"Austin, TX",346,429,1371,2.0,11/15/2013,"Newest in the Fleet of Chili's poppin up around town...still smell the fresh cut wood...Many may Know by now that We are NOT fans of these style chain stores. But, we have a 3 year old granddaughter..And it seams to be working for now...And if you sign up to the email service, they float ya some good deals.  For us, we do like the Lunch combos they have...great price range too...So why 2 stars..Skillet Queso...Quote ""Cheese dip with seasoned beef"" REALLY, Come on..Cheese Dip??? It tastes nothing like cheese..NOTHING..it tastes like Chili..And to top it off, it was luke warm at best...Next time maybe, just maybe, they can heat up the skillet first?? Truly Inedible!!!.. Wife went with a Bowl of Chili, which she is a big fan of..Me, this time around went with the Chicken Enchilada Soup..Really Good Soup..We both went with the Burger Bites with fries...OK...We understand the 3 stage pricing on the Combos, but this Looked light on fries..I would suggest a smaller plate for this one...2 burger bites, small pile of fries on a HUGE plate....Burgers were good, cooked perfect, needs Bacon (Bacon Ranch Maybe??)  You can steel that, I wont mind.....Fries were crisp..Main reason Too for Chili's...They have a Corn Dog for the Kiddo's...and my granddaughter loves them..Service was OK...Hard to find someone who really likes there job..Its one of the thing the wife and I actually ""study"" this when we go out to eat...Smiles say a lot...And I would move your info board in the back room..After seeing the average pay for a waiter, I may need to apply.."
Dawn C.,"Pflugerville, TX",20,59,7,4.0,5/18/2014,"This is a very nice Chili's, one of the nicest I've experienced.  The staff are so friendly, and the service is quick. Food was good, too.   We had lunch here recently, and it was really enjoyable.  The lunch portions are just right. Just be careful of the table app.  We accidentally played a $0.99 game of trivia, and there wasn't an option to cancel the game.  It was only $0.99, but if you have kids, you'll probably want to keep them away from these things...or get tagged with a huge bill."
Ed S.,"Ballston Spa, NY",2,48,,4.0,8/22/2013,"I happened to be driving by one night about a week ago and saw that the restaurant was already opened.  I didn't even realize it.  If you've been to one Chili's you've been to them all in terms of food, that sort of thing.  I ate at the bar which was relatively empty for a 10 PM on a week night.  Bartender was nice and prompt as was the food.   My only issue came from the idea that this place would close so early.  I may have to physically go and check, but I didn't think that any Chili's closed before midnight anywhere.  The website says that all Chili's restaurants close at 11 PM on week nights and midnight on weekends, but this one closed at 10:30 on weeknights and 11:30 on weekends.  I'm not sure how accurate the website is.  I was really hoping for a late, late night restaurant in this small town of ours (maybe when the water park opens next year), so I was a little disappointed with the closing times.  Lewisville outside Dallas has chain restaurants that typically close at 2 or even 3 AM on weekend nights for instance. In any case, I am happy to read the one review that said while the place closed at 11:30 one night, they still accomodated people in the restaurant until 12:30 AM.  I can guarantee you that when football season rolls around those Hendrickson kids will be there as long as possible!!  They already flood the Whataburger parking lot next door from 10 PM to 1 AM on game nights, and I expect some, if not most, will migrate to Chili's."
Kaz G.,"Hutto, TX",0,4,,5.0,8/17/2014,"This location has raised the bar over some other locations as far as I'm concerned.  My son and I ate there on a Thursday evening slightly before the 6:30-7 pm dinner service.  I was very pleased.  The hostess was very pleasant and seated us immediately.  Almost immediately, the waiter came along and took our drink and appetizer orders.  he was very professional, pleasant and knew what he was doing.  The appetizers were brought to us within 5 minutes and seemed freshly made.  It was the usual chips n salsa but to our delight was seasoned perfectly and the salsa seemed quite fresh.   Our food order was brought to us within 12 minutes and was cooked to order.  The ingredients seemed  fresh and our meals were quite tasty. I ordered a salad with chicken, the salad was crisp , fresh and the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and tender.   The waiter was attentive during the course of our meal checking on food quality and refreshing drinks ( if I could recall his name, I'd give him a shout out).  Their new system of paying at the table using a modern point of sale combination entertainment/card swipe system is very convenient and  easy to use.  In the past at another location,  I noted an additional charge for use of the console (apparently due to one of my kids  playing some games) which to me was a negative up-sell. When i complained, the charge was immediately removed so the problem was very well taken care of.  In this location, while my son did mess around with the console a bit, there was no such charge on the bill. I did notice that on our way to our table, a couple sections appeared closed as it was not very busy yet.  When we left, the sections still appeared but closed but there was a number of people waiting to be seated.  I think the front managers can improve their service in this area. Overall, I much prefer this location to the locations in Round Rock and Hutto.  Very well done."
Sarah K.,"Manor, TX",2,16,11,4.0,1/9/2015,"Love My Chili's restaurant in Pville- Me and my boyfriend eat here regularly- like 1-2 times a month and me and my galpals like to come here for a happy hour beer on the weekdays occasionally. Have never had any real complaints recently- only when they 1st opened.. the service was SO SLOW then- but things have gotten WAY better! My most recent experience was this week, went with my Bestie during the week around 6:30pm to have a Large Draft Beer in the bar area. It's seat yourself in that area, so we found a tabletop and sat down. Thirsty and craving that cold refreshment, we unfortunately weren't attended to for about 5-10 minutes when FINALLY a waitress came and took our drink orders. Their drink specials during the week for Happy hour are pretty awesome- It was $3.25 for a LARGE mug of domestic draft beer or they also have $1.99 margaritas. We both ordered a large draft beer and I always ask for limes. The beers came right out and the waitress did me a HUGE favor by cutting up about 10 limes and bringing a bowl of them to the table- SWEETNESS (b/c I go through the limes..)! My friend had the Coors on tap and she said the beer could've been colder.. my budlight was just fine. I would suggest Colder mugs- don't know if they have a system where they can freeze the mugs so they are cold when they come out?      Also, they have appetizers on special until 6pm for weekday happy hour but we barely missed that- we did, however,have a coupon for a free Appetizer if you purchase an adult entree- so she ordered her an entree for lunch the next day so we could take advantage of some Chicken & Beef Nachos while toasting our beers. We love the payment kiosk at each booth/table and you can split the bill 2 ways on those things! All-in-all, it took 5-10 mins to get our drink order in,but after that service ROCKED!"
Elena S.,"Round Rock, TX",117,7,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Terrible.  Service is awful, food is terrible and often cold. Nothing but bad experiences (yes I was stupid enough to try it again after the first bad time there!)"
J W.,"Austin, TX",0,26,,2.0,4/15/2016,"Seriously underwhelmed. It wasn't atrocious, but it would be too complimentary to say the food was marginal. As someone who has been to many Chili's all over the country, this one may have taken the cake as the worst. Only reason it gets two stars is because our server was great."
Paige B.,"Austin, TX",0,43,,1.0,3/18/2015,"My husband and I have dined in and used the car side to-go. Every time we've been the service is so slow!  Either this place is under staffed or their slogan is ""Someone will be right with you"". Last night was the final straw. We stood around looking and waiting for a host(ess) and when one appeared she proceeded to ask for our names.  I questioned how long the wait was for a party of two (15min) and decided it wasn't worth it if the service was also going to be slow.  We left and went to another nearby restaurant. Something needs to change at this establishment."
Stephannie T.,"Cedar Park, TX",89,15,,1.0,8/27/2013,"They had no baby back, baby back, baby back, they had NO BABY BACK RIBS!  On a TUESDAY, opening week, they RAN OUT of ribs! Seriously?? How does chili's run out of ribs? We waited 30 minutes after being told it was a 15 minute wait, only to be told after we got to the table they had no ribs! Then when we complained to the manager, he offered no consolation other than ""yeah sorry about that""  Then when we ordered a burger it was dry, next time we'll just go to red robin"
