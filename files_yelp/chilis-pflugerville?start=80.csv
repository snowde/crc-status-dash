Shelby C.,"Pflugerville, TX",7,22,2,2.0,3/4/2015,Their to-go just doesn't have it together. Always at least a 45 minute wait for food. Very disorganized and often leave out items that were ordered. I so want this chilis to be great!! We were so excited when we found out chilis was going in at stone hill. Unfortunately theyre a huge let down. Not at all like their 45th street location in Austin.
Nate G.,"Pflugerville, TX",89,8,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"I placed a Togo order for a family of 7. We had 4 triple dippers, a kids pizz, a big mouth bites, and a classic bacon burger ketchup and pickles only. We were told 20 minutes for pick up. I waited about 25 minutes before going to get it. I get there and I don't see our food ready. I paid 85 with a tip and asked how much longer before our food was ready. I was told 5 minutes because of all the triple dippers because of all the fried food. I said ok and set a timer on my phone and waited. It was about another 12 minutes before we were brought our food. I asked for my receipt and checked my food. I opened the triple plays and was stunned by how little food is in there. I understand these are smaller portioned apps but it had chicken tenders about the size of baby carrots and 4 of the smallest wings I have ever seen when I asked what was the explaination she said that is what it is. She then said oh I forgot your fries I'll be right back. I went through the rest of the food and every triple play was like the first smallest portions ever and very unappealing. I've been here sitting in the restruant and have had the same thing and was given enough for two people to eat off of. I got out fries a few minutes later and asked again is this really it and was told that that is what it comes with. I said ok and left I will not be going back again as this was a very unsatisfactory experience for what I spent on my food and it still left my family hungry."
Sam S.,"Pflugerville, TX",159,176,2,4.0,11/14/2013,"So, I've been here several times now, at various times and on various days...I haven't ever had any terrible experiences here, and in fact, have been very satisfied each time.  I have been concerned after seeing some of these reviews - and on a few trips, I've seen some tables get ignored, not ever get their food, have their waiter never bring the check by...so I know there are still some kinks being worked out.  It's a nice sized restaurant, pretty open walkways, lots of seating options... it's what you would expect with a Chili's.  The parking is a little strange, the main parking lot is around the back side, and there's a semi-long walk down a ramp if you park along the side. Food-wise, my partner and I have always gotten our food out at a good pace and have had good attention by our servers on drink refills (also to-go drinks with our check, A+!) and getting our checks quickly.  Nothing to complain about our service! All in all, I have never really had anything to complain about at this location.  I'd give it 5 stars based on my experiences alone, but considering I've seen something go wrong at a table close by almost every time I've been here, I just can't.  I kind of feel bad with all these negative reviews already, but it's hard to expect 100% perfection from a place that was only open a few weeks.  I'd give them another chance."
Marcus R.,"Pflugerville, TX",186,451,85,2.0,11/13/2014,I would give this place a three star because it is chain restaurant but the service here was really slow the last few times I have eaten here. I like it because it close by our neighborhood. But for as many waiters I see here the service is slow. They do attend your needs and ensure your taken care of. I just think they need to a little more attention to detail. Food is great as can be for being Chili's. They good bargin deals but the selection for bargin deals is limited I must say. Alcohol drinks have always be top notch and just right. I will eat here again but if it continues to be slow service I may need to find a better Chili's location.
Hezikiah L.,"Austin, TX",0,12,1,1.0,1/6/2016,"First and last visit here on Dec. 30, 2015. Told us 15 minute wait when there were at least 6 tables open and plenty of waitstaff on duty. Ours was a small party of 3 and any of those tables could have accommodated us.  We waited for 37 minutes and maybe 2 parties waiting were seated in that time. Party after party left and tables were bussed, but the wait list only grew longer. We finally got fed up and left, going to IHOP and having a great experience. I am a regular patron of Chilis restaurants and bad service is a rarity. This place was just incompetent. Don't bother coming to this location until they get their act together. Until then, you're just wasting your time!"
Twilighthan A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,16,1,1.0,6/7/2014,A restaurant cannot have 10 or so tables free and have a 45 minute wait. What is wrong with you people?   Your biggest problem is your management. I can guarantee that because the last 8 times I have seen the same manager bussing tables instead of managing. Obviously your team has no clue how to manage this restaurant.  Tomorrow we will be going elsewhere. No more chances. I have had it.
Dena S.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,8,,2.0,2/10/2015,"Do I always get the new person? It feels as though every time I go to THIS Chili's I either get the new person or the person that is overloaded with that large table in the middle. The service has never been good; UNLESS I sit in the bar area (which is odd) and the food is only if not less than mediocre. I love Chili's, I love that there is a Chili's next to my house but I can't wait for more restaurants to open in Stonehill. The only reason I will go back is for beer and an appetizer if at all..."
suyi b.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,17,,1.0,7/10/2014,"Just got done  having a meal at the new chilis in pf.  Its a beautiful restaurant, smaller than the tech ridge chilis & it has that new restaurant smell.  We ordered the 2 for 20 meal and recd our app which was good (chipotle chicken flatbread), then we recd out entrees.  Hubby ordered crispy chicken tenders and it was dismal.   The chicken was way old and leathery,  I couldn't even bite through a piece. His blue cheese dressing was not blue cheesey at all like it had been mixed with mayo or something.  I ordered the sirloin steak light plate and it was good except it was a tad salty.   If you can eat somewhere else, please do or go to the tech ridge location.hopefully this location gets it together soon."
Terry M.,"Redlands, CA",0,5,4,1.0,1/30/2015,"Took my wife to Chili's today. She ordered a steak & salad dish. Lettuce was wilted & steak was rare. She ordered it medium. Waitress offered to put steak on fire & replace salad. Manager came by, apologized & said meal would be comped. After waiting 20+ minutes we inquired about it. Waitress said comping meal didn't include replacing it. I had a nice lunch, but my wife never got a single bite."
Fatima V.,"Hutto, TX",0,8,1,3.0,11/29/2015,"A friend was in town so we decided to go to Chili's because we would go to Chili's before homecoming in high school. Usually, we would go to the one in Hutto but we thought it would be fun to go to the Chili's here so we could also do some quick Christmas shopping. We got the skillet queso, nachos, and chicken tortilla soup. Food was like any other Chili's to be honest. It's a chain restaurant so it shouldn't come shocking that it tastes just like any other Chili's. As for service, it was relatively great. They got to us immediately and asked us what we wanted, although we had no clue at that moment. When we finally were set, they kept being attentive, even with what felt like a full house. We probably would stick with the Hutto one unless we have plans to go shopping just because this Chili's is just like any other Chili's. We had a good time though. Staff is pretty friendly and makes it feel worth the trip."
Judy P.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,5,,1.0,11/8/2015,Worst Chilis ever. Same food if you can ever get it served. Wait staff untrained and inattentive and kitchen staff either way too slow or completely understaffed. Shouldn't take hour and half to eat lunch. Went 4 times before writing this. Beware.
Jerome E.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,1,,2.0,3/30/2014,"I've been a huge Chili's fan for well over a decade. Having a Chili's so close to the house I got excited as this used to be my all time favorite restaurant. Sadly, this establishment is a train wreck. The food comes to you late...sometimes cold and the drinks can take the server forever to refill. The food itself seems to have lost a step in quality. We've ordered appetizers before to never have them show up. We've had servers completely ignore our table...ordered beers and not have them show up. I hope upper management sees how horrible the reviews have been on multiple sites and take action.  I've been there a total of 8 times and will not be coming back anytime soon. Sorry, chili's...you've lost this once long time fan to whataburger.  Btw....this is my first time ever logging into a website to write a negative review...that's how big of a let down this restaurant was for me."
Tracy N.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,8,,1.0,9/14/2014,"I really want to like this Chilis. But the food quality is poor at best. Today it was a house salad gone bad. Literally bad. There was a big clump of rotting lettuce in my salad. Thank you taste buds for being my early warning detection system on this one.  Since we got this to go,  I actually brought it back and had to wait over 5 minutes to even be greeted at the ToGo counter and then another 5 for the manager.  To his credit he offered money back and another salad.  No thank you on the salad, kinda lost my appetite for a Chilis salad.  But thanks for my $3.15 back."
Luis A.,"Monterrey, Mexico",0,10,1,1.0,5/17/2014,"45 mins waiting only to find out that the manager doesn't take a Mexican nor German ID to drink nor an expired Texas license. Zero common sense. They have to wake up, because the water park is about to open and it'll dar tons of tourists. What is this manager gonna say? Only Texan boys and gals? Felt discriminated. He couldn't justify himself for not taking valid IDs such as passports or if there's a county, city or state code that explains this particular matter. Shame on you, my man."
Miranda K.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,8,,1.0,4/17/2015,"I took my boyfriend to lunch for his birthday. We went during the middle of the day on a Friday. Besides the random school bus of high school students, there really weren't that many people dining in. From what I could see, there were at least five waitresses and a manager out on the floor. We came in, and yes they did tell us they were busy, so taking five minutes to get a server to come wait on us was not that big of a deal. When our waitress (which I will be nice enough not to name) came to our table she took our drink orders, but, was not very attentive and got his drink wrong. Simple mistake that was corrected, not that big of a deal. Then she came back maybe another five minutes later and took our order. We waited probably almost half an hour before she brought the food out. She got my order wrong, which again she corrected, but, all of the food was cold. My boyfriend commented that every time she came to the table she'd ask if we needed anything else, but, would walk past us while saying it like she expected that we wouldn't need anything. Which, bothered me a little, but, still wasn't going to make me tip her any less or anything. Then, she brought me another refill of tea which had black specs in it. My boyfriend then had to go to the bathroom for about half an hour due to the food upsetting his stomach (probably from being too cold...) At this point I was upset, but, I work in customer service so I know mistakes happen, and still was trying to keep a good attitude about the service we were getting. I wasn't expecting him to be in there that long, nor did I realize his stomach was so upset from the food, so I thought about telling the waitress it was his birthday. However, after waiting almost 25 minutes of that half hour for her to come to the table I decided against it and just asked for to go boxes. After my boyfriend got back to the table he told me about his stomach and we waited ten minutes for the boxes. When she brought them, one of the boxes was covered in grease! It was disgusting!!! I can't believe she didn't even spend a few seconds to check the boxes she was giving to her customers! So we asked for a new one after having to wait another ten minutes for her to come back. Then we had to wait another fifteen for the check, and while waiting we noticed sugar ants crawling all over the wall. That was it for me. After getting the ""grease box"" I was done trying to keep a good attitude. My boyfriend made a complaint with the manager, who rushed him mind you and was sitting in an office where she couldn't even see anything going on in the kitchen or floor. I decided that I needed to give them a review so that hopefully no one else will have to not only deal with this kind of service, but, with the uncleanliness we had to deal with."
Natalie L.,"Round Rock, TX",11,18,2,2.0,10/16/2014,Mostly bad experiences here unfortunately. I love the m margarita grilled chicken with the rice and black beans. Three service trends too be very slow and distracted. The host has NEVER been at or near the door when we show up.  I have called on my phone while stabbing at the host stand just too get someone's attention...no luck...because no one answered lol.  I have never gone with a large group and hopefully never will have to.
Robert S.,"Pflugerville, TX",58,67,,1.0,8/7/2013,"Ok maybe it is not fair to judge a place just after they opened. We went by on Sunday hoping they were open only to see a sign saying that employee training was in progress and they would open the following day.  Let me backtrack a little. This has always been a very small town and only recently have we started to get upscale sitdown restaurants. This chili's is our first national franchise so expectations were high. Well maybe they should have spent a tad more time training the employees. Our service was so bad we could not get mad. It was so bad it was laughable! Seriously! I felt sorry for them. This had to have been the singular worst restaurant service I have experienced.  For appetizers we chose the combo. Pick three of about nine different options.  Then the manager appeared at our table to tell us - oops. They were sold out of one of the items. Would we like to choose another? So we did. Only to have her again show up and say that they were out of that also. At this point I was ready to just ask exactly which appetizers they did have available. So we waited. And waited. About this time my drink finally shows up. We get our appetizers order straightened out. Finally.  Just in time for our entrees to hit the table. Then one by one the appetizers started to appear. Yes after the entree. My dinner salad also showed up. Should I say my additional dinner salad showed up?  My friend ordered a tea for his drink. Pretty simple. Then he was given a second. Not a refill. His original order a second time. He decides to switch to a mango iced tea. Naturally what is brought to our table is a regular lemonade and a mango lemonade as they couldn't remember which he ordered. Correct answer, none of the above. He ordered a blackberry iced tea. By this time he had five different soft drinks in front of him. I guess they thought they would just keep bringing out one of everything until they got it right. The entrees were good when they arrived except for I had barely touched my salad and the remainder of our appetizers still hadn't arrived. I also guess they urge their servers to rotate customers as fast as possible. This is understandable. But when it is 9:30 at night and the restaurant will be closing soon is the right time to ask  a customer if they want a to go box only minutes after they got their entree? Before we placed our orders we informed the server we had a coupon for a free dessert. She looked at it and made note on the order pad. While we were being rushed out the door after dinner I made a bet with my friend to see if she remembered the dessert. I bet no. He bet yes. He lost by asking her if she remembered we had a free dessert. She responded of course she didn't forget. She returned shortly asking to see the coupon and again asking what we wanted. I win!!!  When service is impossibly bad you can't get mad. All you can do is laugh and feel bad for them. I hope they iron out all their mistakes."
Paula M.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,10,,1.0,8/28/2014,"At here tonight in the bar, server was cleaning tables, towel dropped on the floor, and sure enough a few minutes later she picked it up and continued to wipe three other tables down with it.  Gross! I would rather eat at a dirty table.  Food is good but need to work on training, another visit the girl cleaning the table sprayed the cleaning spray across the table and over sprayed all over my food.  Needless to say, i could not eat after that."
Brandon H.,"Georgetown, TX",4,17,1,5.0,12/20/2013,Still my favorite chilis. Waitstaff friendly and i come here often so they remember me. Food is always consistent and yummy. Manager is very friendly checks on everyone.
James L.,"Pflugerville, TX",41,110,14,1.0,12/7/2013,"The kitchen needs to be inspected regularly. Two times and both bad. First time there was multiple dishes being served cold -- like a Klingon proverb about revenge. Second time, foreign object in the food. The manager on duty said it's a ""work in progress"". They've been open six months. -- Work in progress?!? You are not painting the Sistine Chapel. C'mon. You almost have to WANT to not improve at that rate."
