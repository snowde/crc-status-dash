Miguel L.,"Ridgewood, NY",43,23,5,5.0,8/8/2017,I like the food Jenny and Josh the bartenders have great attitude all the time even when they are short staffed they gets the job done from making drinks to changing beer kegs they still maintain professionalism and respect to clients. Karissa the server is awesome she's so genuine and sweet I can see that this place picks their staff carefully. Great job!
Barbara W.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",109,12,12,1.0,11/19/2017,"I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we decided to go here to eat while our daughter attended a birthday party at Shiro of Japan.  There was a 45-minute wait for a table so we took a table in the bar (first come first served status).  It hadn't been cleared or wiped from the last customers so I moved the glasses and trash to a high top and wiped it with a napkin.  After 10 minutes, I went to the bar to ask if there was a waiter and couldn't get the bartender's attendtion.  Finally a waiter showed up and said he wasn't our waiter but ours had just come on and would be with us shortly.  20 minutes after sitting down, Isaac showed up. We put in our whole order, including a bottled beer and their signature margarita.  Southwest eggrolls came out quickly, dumped on the table and sliding across the plate by the rushed server. They were disgusting.  Then our mains came out, still no drinks, and they were just passable -- Buffalo chicken sandwich fell apart on delivery and the chicken was very over cooked. The 1/2 order of ribs had 4 rather small and dry ribs and the corn was mushy. The only good food were the french fries.  As we were eating, the waiter came back with the margarita and informed us the beer we ordered wasn't available. A substitute took another 10 minutes -- a full 40 minutes after we'd sat down. The on-table tablet wouldn't allow me to order more drinks - it only worked to pay the bill.  Then the bill still had the original beer and the replacement on it and we had to ask for it to be fixed before we could pay. And then asked again.  We were at Chilis for about 1 hour and 40 minutes and will NEVER go back to this location. Bad food, worse service, dirty tables and overall don't give a crap attitude makes for a horrible dining experience. If I ever go back to the mall we will eat at Shiro of Japan or maybe just get some pretzel dogs from Auntie Annies.  Utter crap."

Donna D.,"OZONE PARK, NY",46,17,,1.0,5/16/2017,"My Daughter and Husband  visited this location , while standing at the bar waiting on a table. A man and woman were seated at the bar, when their tacos came, a huge Cockroach walked out of the taco......GROSS. Needless to see this place is on the do not eat list for me."

John G.,"MIDDLE VILLAGE, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/8/2016,This is the worst Chills franchise ever.  Dirty .disgusting . Terrible service. Horrible food. Would rather  drive all the way  to Westbury.
Lorelei F.,"Flushing, NY",0,32,,1.0,2/23/2017,Went in to chilis for lunch.   Even though the place was 3/4 empty we were told we had to wait.  Finally got seated after fifteen minutes.   The waiter came over looking like someone shot his dog and took our order.  Had to wait another forty five minutes for half rack of ribs and sliders.  The food was just ok.  It was not hot by any means.  Then had to wait another fifteen minutes for the waiter to give us the check.  Never once did he smile or make us for comfortable.  Needless to say I won't be back.
Erika Jo C.,"Middle Village, NY",0,15,6,2.0,5/21/2016,"I come here when i got nothing else to go to , food is meh place is always pack idk why . Had over cooked ribs here its really bad"
Kat W.,"Flushing, NY",73,30,2,2.0,8/1/2016,I have to agree with Raymond the drinks are not worth it. I've been going here for years and have to say the past few months have been horrible with the drinks they are more watered down with more ice then drink it's no longer worth it for us.
Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",92,642,796,4.0,1/13/2013,"Been here twice and got good fast service, friendly enough waiters. All the food I got, it was what I expected off the menu descriptions. No surprises.  The second time I went, the waitress was so sweet- she was abrupt at first, but I guess busy, but she warmed up fast.  The chocolate molten cake was warm and gooey, and it's my favorite dessert. Someone made a mistake with our order, so she comped our dessert. Good service! Lol. Kept me happy!"
Raymond S.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",1,11,2,1.0,12/27/2014,"Drinks are horrible the bartender was even worse took her 15 minutes to even come over to us and ask would you like another drink or food, we were sat at the bar in front of her and she couldn't even make eye contact or conversation with us? She seemed like she hated her job but that's not our fault. Use to like this place but now it's crap."
Lucia D.,"South Ozone Park, NY",5,12,,3.0,2/15/2015,"The menu has a lot of variety yet it is not overwhelming. The appetizers were great. The fried pickles were really tasty and the main course was delicious. I ordered the sirloin steak with grilled avocado and was disappointed when it came without the avocado. They didn't have ane avocado and I should have been told when I placed the order. The two for one drinks were dissapointing. They bring both drinks out at the same time and serve Margaritas in beer mugs. The margaritas were more mix than tequila.  I would rather order one really good drink than two mediocore ones. When we go back,it will definitely be for the food."
Matthew R.,"New York, NY",1,3,,4.0,10/29/2014,Food was good but the place was really packed and loud. Service was a little sloppy but can understand on a busy day.
