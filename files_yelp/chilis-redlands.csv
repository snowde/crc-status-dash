Matt H.,"Orange, CA",218,765,218,3.0,7/26/2017,"Heading down from Big Bear with a group, we stopped here for a bite before the drive back home.  The Yelp app lets you check in early and get on the wait list, which is nice.  Probably the only misstep was that I went tot he bar to get some water and waited for at least 10 minutes before a bartender even showed up, and by then we were seated.  The bar was pretty full, but no one was anywhere to be seen, so I thought that was odd. I like the food here.  It isn't awe inspiring, but the menu is huge and there is a lot of variety, so you should be able to find something you like.  I ended up with the 'upscale' taco plate, and it is tasty and relatively healthy, plus not too expensive.  I also had a couple of margaritas, which I like here quite a bit.  In fact, long ago I adopted the Presidente style (with brandy) as my home margarita style.  Service was very friendly (apart from the missing bartender) so I have no complaints about the waitress. If you go with a group, the on-table payment system makes splitting a check really easy.  You just opt to split it, and then each person ticks off what they ordered and then swipes a CC and puts in a tip.  The waitress does not have to track charges, and there is no arguing over who owes what or trying to tell the waitress put X on this CC, Y on this CC and Z on the last one."
Gabrielle A.,"San Bernardino, CA",187,5,,1.0,9/8/2017,Went into this nice place for dinner with my boyfriend  We wanted the 2 for 35$ the margarita comes with shakers we got regular cups  Told it was what we ordered. Then when I ordered my food it came out cold the waitress was absolutely rude and got the manager then the manager was no better I had it with chillis. This is absolutely unacceptable.
Tresa H.,"North Redlands, Redlands, CA",20,6,,3.0,1/6/2018,I know I chose to sit in the bar area but they seemed a little under staffed. Asked for lemons twice and we got them once our meal was almost done. I had to ask for napkins... like get up and ask. It was alright but it wasn't the best experience. It was nothing to recommend or say let's go back.
Melissa D.,"Redlands, CA",0,46,16,2.0,1/2/2018,"Went to chilis today with the family. We decided on getting 2 of the 2/$22. Comes with one app and 2 entrees. The host working tonight was in a bad mood and had an attitude but our server was awesome. The apps we got were good, the Texas fries and chips and guac.  However, my grilled chicken salad was the worst salad I've ever had , i don't really know how you can mess up something so simple but my chicken was soggy. My moms ribs were good but both the broccoli and corn on the con sides were horrible. If I do ever go back I will stick to just drinks and chips and salsa."
Desiree A.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"Very very rude!! Seriously the staff was rude the vibe wasn't cool and felt like we were just being stared at, well to be honest we went thru the wrong door but geesh what a way to make us feel so awkward the staff just stared at us instead of helping us and then we heard two of the girls whispering who knows what maybe because we have a family of 7 +1 and it was intimidating seeing all of us walk in?? Not sure... we waited about 20min before we walked finally don't know why or how they took so long to seat us when there were clearly about 15-25 chairs to the left side of the restaurant anyway they ruined what we had planned and whoever is managing that place should really take more interest in how that place is being ran and how there staff greets customers very very poor customer service."
Angela J.,"Yucaipa, CA",81,29,8,1.0,12/4/2017,"Horrible experience. My family went to celebrate my son's birthday. We made a reservation and we all were disappointed by this dining experience. Our server, Buffy, was incredibly inattentive. She didn't get our orders correct nor did she feel the need to check on our table to see how we were doing or if we needed anything...like waters refilled or napkins etc. Needless to say we will not return. Food was not fresh or tasty as it had been in the past. Over cooked rubbery shrimp fajitas, over cooked chicken crispers, undercooked broccoli, over procecessed chicken breast. Its a shame that Chili's is losing our business because I had been a regular customer with my children for the past three years."
Micheal A.,"Highland, CA",222,3,,1.0,12/5/2017,"My experience at chili's was.completely unacceptable. The waitress was forcing a smile that made my boyfriend and I feel so sorry for her.  According to our receipt her name is Jax. I had ordered the bottomless soup and salad, which is supposed to mean I can get as much as i can eat. They where out of the loaded potatoe soup, so she said my options where the chili soup and tortilla soup. I had notice that on the menu it was 80 cents extra and she did not mention that untii i brought it up.  Then she brought out my soup and salad and I had asked for a second bowl of soup since she constantly walked by without asking. I had not touched the salad yet and she had the nerve to say that I did ""better than most"". When my boyfriend asked what she meant, she said that usually people don't get more than one bowl of soup. Too make a woman feel insecure, especially in front of my boyfriend,  is despicable. By the way, they are budgeting on napkins so be sure to bring your own!"
Bianca S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",117,131,294,4.0,1/1/2017,I'm not sure why this chilies has such bad reviews I was actually really pleased with my visit here. I put in an order to go I got the BLT sandwich combo with the chicken tortilla soup. The combo came with the soup and a side of fries. I thought that was a really great deal all for $6 and the portions were a really good side. I placed the order online and it didn't even take 10 mins for it to be ready which I was really happy about.  When I walked in to pick up my order I was promptly greeted and asked if there was anything else I wanted to add. I added a strawberry lemonade and they gave me a huge to go cup of it. I paid and my food was still hot when I got home. The sandwich and fries were delicious but the soup was just a little too salty. Other than that I will order from them to go again.
Lupe C.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,66,235,3.0,3/18/2017,"The rating is based on the following besides customer service (which it was good): - Southwestern Eggrolls: good - Texas Cheese Fries: not that impressed. Not sure why it's even offered in the menu and most of my fries were a bit dry. It's like frying frozen fries, cook some bacon, get my canned jalapenos, add some shredded cheese and greens onions and call it a day. I'm just glad I came during happy hour time (some appetizers are cheaper). - Triple Berry Crumble Cake: now this was the real deal, which I have been craving it since the last time I ate it. It tasted buttery and moist...just everything about it was good."
Christina N.,"Redlands, CA",7,16,34,5.0,12/7/2016,"I came to eat when they were not busy. I always come here since they are located near where I live. The moment my sister and I came in, an older lady stopped with her cleaning and greeted us immediately, which I thought was great because most places would just stare and wonder when another employee would greet the customers. Therefore, the greeting and seating us was fairly quick.  I love the food. I always eat steak at this place. They always get the steak at the right temperature that I like, medium rare. I am extremely picky with the steak. Surprisingly they never disappoint me.  The server was nice, she came and check up on us multiple times. Sucks that I didn't get her name."
Ray A.,"Highland, CA",39,26,10,5.0,9/10/2017,Great service from the start the young gentleman that sat us was friendly and the server was excellent i think her name was Raylina she spoke to the bartender and made sure I received a nice sweet drink the bartender was also friendly. We had the sampler it was excellent and the chips and avocado dip.
Michael T.,"Redlands, CA",90,5,,1.0,9/23/2017,"It's a darn shame when you go to a restaurant that got famous on their namesake chili on a Friday Night and they haven't had ANY chili since NOON! Then to top it off we waited 35 minutes to get our food only to find it ""died in the window!"" Learned my lesson, won't be back!!"
Lisa D.,"Chicago, IL",537,260,24,2.0,9/8/2017,"Tried a turkey burger with fries and was disappointed with the quality of the meat and the way it was cooked. The happy hour deals are pretty good, however. Large domestic beers are only a few bucks until 7pm. There are also quite a few TVs to watch at the bar in case there is a game on that you'd like to see."
Sara L.,"Highland, CA",0,11,10,1.0,7/4/2017,This is a last resort restaurant.  Worst service I've ever encountered- they lock the doors 20 minutes before they actually are suppose to be closed.
Justin K.,"Loma Linda, CA",7,89,18,4.0,2/12/2017,"This establishment makes a great Chicken Buffalo Salad! After all the years I've ate here, I have never ordered anything else. Wait times can be lengthy during dinner time at this particular location. However, lunch time is less of a wait and you're served promptly. I love the fact I can pay at my table without having to wait on a server to cash me out. I wish all food establishments would have this self service machine."
Mikayla N.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,2,5.0,2/5/2017,"My mother , little sister & I are here now eating our appetizer waiting on our food . I'm seriously taken back by how amazing our service has been . I NEVER experienced a waiter as awesome as Johnny . He has the best attitude and so funny .  We ordered our appetizer & drinks  he came back in literally 5 minutes with both our drinks and appetizer While we're waiting on our entrees he has been to our table 4 times refilling drinks & making sure we're all good .  i will def def def be back just for him !"
Gloria L.,"Valley Center, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/22/2017,One of the best Chili's I've been to. Despite being super busy the staff was still very attentive!
Etan G.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,3,2.0,4/17/2017,"Not our first time here but definitely the most disappointing. The two things that you would expect on Easter Sunday : bad parking and a long wait, not on this day. I was able to park up front and my wait was less than 10 minutes. We should have left then, it was all downhill from there. Everything: Staff, service, food etc was awful (apologetic) but still awful. The kicker that warranted this review was my 'doggie bag', I ordered enough so that I could bring some home. I would like for you to see the bone-in side of my BBQ chicken I waited over 30 minutes for."
Cody S.,"Redlands, CA",0,99,12,5.0,5/23/2017,Great food for a good price. I love there ribs. Would definitely recommend this place if you are hungry. I would recommend getting here early to avoid the crowds
J. D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,94,,4.0,8/12/2017,"This place is great, very very friendly. The food is just right too. Its not like all those other loud restaurants that u cant even eat your food. Its very clean and spacious. Im definitely coming again."
Laura P.,"Highland, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Well got in and seated right away, around 4pm. Food came pretty quick, then a couple with two small kids were seated across the Isle from us,and kept throwing toys on floor, as parent just kept picking it up and giving it back. And kids just kept Screaming!!!!! the whole time. Mind you a cry ,shout, a scream happens,but all through the meal is ridiculous!!!! called my a waitress over ,asked if she could get my waitress and told her we had to leave,because the noise was just too much!!!! Not sure if we will go back again,very unhappy dining experience with my mom!!!!!! Think twice after the first couple of screams. As we were walking out another customer said to us sorry!!!! A customer mind you a few tables away!!!!!! Only giving one star cause the food was decent!!!"
Jon A.,"Beaumont, CA",18,12,2,5.0,9/28/2016,"Well my co -worker and I decided to come for Happy Hour and although I'm not really a fan of Chili's ,today I'm their number one fan!!Their appitizer were absolutely amazing which we both ordered the Western Style Egg Rolls and Smoke Chicken Wings .I was impressed with the flavor and certainly come back again . The best was the Service of our nice Bartender .She was very attentive and always asking  us if we needed anything and was happy to help us . Thank You Chilli's for you great staff.!!!  5 Stars*****"
Courtney A.,"Loma Linda, CA",46,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Getting seated was no problem. We waited 35 minutes for 2 appetizers and a burger. Not to mention a couple that was seated after us, received their meal within 15-20 mins. Maybe it was because they had alcoholic drinks. If the kitchen is backed up, that is totally understandable, but the waitress should have told us. Checked in with us. You know... be a attentive server.  Then we finally received our food... the fries were like warm and had the ""old oil"" taste. My daughter's burger was burnt around the edges. The buns on my appitizer were stale and also VERY toasty.  We felt completely ignored. Even the store manager made eye contact with me, but did not even smile. I always tip at least 15%, most the time 20%. But I took my bill and rounded to the nearest dollar. Afterall... tip stands for To Insure Promptness (or prompt service if it's TIPS)."
Natalie M.,"Redlands, CA",34,14,,2.0,6/30/2017,"This place is all based on who's working the day you come. Customer service will either be great or horrible, the last time me and my mom went we had horrible service from our waitress and the manager they didn't seem to care at all about there job and that makes me not want to return."
Sharon A.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,19,4,5.0,3/4/2017,"I usually have pretty good experiences here, but what sparked my review and the five star rating was my remarkable experience tonight. Our server was absolutely amazing! Cameron was approachable and friendly. He quickly built rapport with us and was honest in all of his recommendations. He was EXTREMELY attentive, kind, polite, and well-mannered. I even overheard his conversations with his coworkers and he was so kind with them. Lastly, he had so much patience and care. Cameron exemplifies wonderful customer service."
Food E.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,2,1.0,6/19/2017,Been here for an hour so far sitting in the bar area. Have got one glass of water and my chips and salsa. Ordered 40 minutes ago. This is a lunch rush and the service sucks!
Julie L.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/3/2017,"Our go-to place. At least once a week.  Always pleasant. Some bartenders better than others but we always come back. Gal today was filling in, she was exceptional!"
Dominic B.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,30,10,4.0,6/8/2017,"Service is good, food is great but why are the faucets in the bathroom weak? Also, why no wifi?"
Cecilia A.,"San Bernardino, CA",72,46,89,5.0,12/31/2016,"Started with deep fried pickles. Delicious nice and crispy . It came with a sm side of ranch.  We both settled on the quesadilla explosion salad. It was very tasty, and filling . The chicken grilled yo perfection. I will order the pico de gallo on the side next time. It was a bit too spicy for me.  We also had the side of chili. It comes automatically with cheese. I ordered a side of chopped onion. Which they actually chopped fresh for me. I thought that was special. It's the little things.  Our waitress was so nice , made our whole lunch complete . She came back several times to accommodate my daughter and I . Also just to check on us.  I loved the music too. Old school rock n roll."
Linda R.,"Redlands, CA",33,9,,1.0,12/7/2016,"Sadly, before today, I enjoyed Chili's. They aren't always the quickest at getting your order to the table, but the food in consistent, hot and in general, above average. Because I wear  braces, making many foods difficult to chew, I've been ordering--for many, many weeks now-- the chicken enchiladas and asking them to sub shrimp.No problem. A $2 upcharge and everyone was happy. Until today. Today, the waitress couldn't figure out a way to do the simple upcharge, and wanted to charge me for a side of shrimp--6 shrimp for 2.99. That's 2 shrimp per enchilada. I escalated to management, got the same response. No effort to make the customer happy, in any way. We canceled the other order, paid for my iced tea and walked out. I won't be walking back in. This order has never been in question, even at other Chili's in the area and I really liked the dish. Big effing bummer."
An L.,"Fontana, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/9/2017,"On Friday 5/5/17, my husband and I went to chili's, we both order different food. Unfortunately, both my husband and I  got sick with food poisoning, we both missed a day of work. It's unfortunate, since I liked going to this chili's.  I know of 3 other people that went to the same chili's over the weekend and they also fell ill.. Not happy at all."
Jill D.,"Newport Beach, CA",5,7,,5.0,6/29/2017,"Love the food. I meet my dad there once a month for lunch. We always order from the lighter side. However, I do love their fajitas and molten chocolate cake."
Alan B.,"Upland, CA",44,5,,5.0,5/3/2017,Chili's have the best chips!  Ice cold beer and good Margaritas will compliment any meal selection. My favorite are the fajitas.
Jessica H.,"Oak Glen, CA",18,20,6,5.0,1/10/2017,Our trip here was very great. No wait either to be seated  at the time we arrived. Food was really good and our waiter was awesome. He was so friendly and always had a smile. I believe he said his name was Gordon. We need more waiters like you! Thank you for your positivity!! :)  it made our meal here very enjoyable
Andrew M.,"Riverside, CA",1,2,,1.0,4/28/2017,I been here with my girlfriend for about 45 mins and all I've got was my drink refilled I'm hungry and so is my girlfriend this is the last time I come to this chillies worst service and they don't even care if you haven't got your food they just keep passing by you just go to the San Bernardino location it's much more friendly and there very quick at serving
Kevo D.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,92,49,1.0,5/26/2016,I should've walked my ass to the kitchen and just cooked this shit myself and showed the chef how to fuckin make a grilled cheese sandwich. Look at this shit I wish I can see who made this very sad they need to be fired
Matthew H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",57,25,31,2.0,2/5/2017,I remeber why i dont go to chilis because i can cook a better meal #yuck bbq chicken was straightbinjected with water and salt ribs seems like they went through a processing machine bread was filled with straight pepper beer tSted dirty im not blaming this establisent becausr quality of service was superb and on point just the chilis quality in food has become over sauced and seasoned
Andre M.,"Loma Linda, CA",21,20,9,4.0,12/23/2016,I went with my son and We got the 2 for $22 and It was good . I got the hamburger with fries and my son got the steak with smash potato really good and good price.
Ashley D.,"Corona, CA",200,4,,3.0,2/27/2017,"A friend and I went here last night and the wait time wasn't bad, 20 minutes. We sat down and waited maybe 10-15 for the waiter to even come and then another 10 for drinks and we didn't get our appetizers for almost 45 minutes. It was horrible, by time we got our food we weren't even hungry anymore because it took so long! They didn't even seem that busy but they probably were and I understand but maybe they need more staff? It's just an hour for your dinner is a bit much."
Staci F.,"Highland, CA",45,13,1,5.0,7/23/2017,"Good food, low prices and the best blackberry tea!! Wings were good and new kids me all cups were a hit. Grilled chicken salad was refreshing."
