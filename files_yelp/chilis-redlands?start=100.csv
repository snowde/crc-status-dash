Mhelina D.,"Colton, CA",10,104,20,1.0,11/2/2013,Too bad I have to give you guys a star......  We waited 45 min to be seated and we didn't mind it was busy on a Saturday nite. We got seated and we ended up with two waiters they had me happy for like 15 min with their good service ( I should of read the reviews and skip this place) 40 min to finally get my food and wait 20 min after ur done to get your check is deff not acceptable.... Wow what a disappointment you guys were. I tried talking to someone but no hostess or manager to be found.
Tim A.,"Redlands, CA",7,19,16,5.0,9/11/2014,John the server made all the difference in the world!  He took the time to test the avocados to make sure they were ripe enough to serve!  He kept our glasses full.  The food was about what we expected from Chili's.
anthony p.,"Hesperia, CA",66,18,3,1.0,1/1/2015,Poor staffing waited 1/2 hour till this one table got cleaned....would have been nice to get the manager to help out bussing tables.
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,1.0,1/19/2011,"Do Not go to this Chili's.  I went here with my bf for lunch because I had a gift card.  When we arrived one of the the hostess opened the door for us, which was nice.  We were seated right away, but when the hostess was doing his ""Thank you for dining at Chili's.  Your waitress will be....Hope you enjoy you blah blah blha..."" he was looking elsewhere as though we were wasting his time.   Moving on.  Our waitress was very nice.  I ordered the half rack of ribs meal and the bf ordered a side salad and turkey club.  He never got his salad.  Our meals came out within a reasonable about of time.  However, my ribs were charred and there was barely anything there.  It wasn't juicy or thick or tender at all.  I've had ribs at Chili's before (in Orange County) and they were always thick, juicy, and tender.   I would've sent it back, but didn't want to have to wait for them to recook another one or deal with a manager.  I hadn't eaten breakfast so I was hungry and just ate it with ranch dress since the meat was very dry.   I will not be dining here again."
Molly E.,"Redlands, CA",9,11,,5.0,9/28/2012,"First off, this is a chain restaurant, & one of the busiest restaurants in Redlands. Give them a break, people. Secondly, if you're courteous to the staff, they'll treat you well. If you treat them like dirt, well, remember the golden rule! I love the staff. Jon, Ashley, Trish & many others go out of their way for you and work their asses off. I was on a diet & ordered my meal prepared a very specific way, and they got it spot on! The only thing I'm not stoked on is the redecoration, but that goes for all the Chili's restaurants--not just a Redlands thing."
Cindy L.,"Highland, CA",207,27,,4.0,10/30/2014,"We went to Chilies and really enjoyed the new menu options. I had a wonderful avocado burger, was very yummy. I really like it here."
Keana W.,"Riverside, CA",0,21,,2.0,4/4/2014,"I love chili's. I had just got paid and I wanted to eat. I sat in an empty restaurant for 30 minutes and no service, so I left. I will not be returning to this chilis"
Brad E.,"Redlands, CA",52,16,3,4.0,7/26/2013,"For a chain this is one of the better in Redlands.  The daytime bar staff, Carly, Noemi, Annie and Erin are the best.  The beer is cold and the food is served quickly.  Recently they were out of Bud Light on a Tuesday...seriously?  No excuse to run out of your top selling draft.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with a lunch at Chili's Redlands."
Heather M.,"Redlands, CA",34,15,1,3.0,7/18/2013,"Pretty fast during lunch times, which is important when you only have an hour.  Friendly staff, ok food."
Deborah S.,"Yucaipa, CA",14,9,2,2.0,6/15/2016,"My friend and I were surprised and disappointed.  We will usually  have our weekly girl day and get some shopping done in Redlands and finish it up with a trip to Chili's for Happy Hour.  We always order the same thing, Presidente' Margaritas and the creamy Jalapeno Chicken wings.  Today the wings were missing the goat cheese and green onion.  We spoke to the server who delivered it and she said that they only come with the loaded boneless wings.  She didn't offer to get us what we wanted and basically insisted we were wrong.  Dominic, our server brought us our bill, that came with another surprise.  The wings were no longer a Happy Hour option, it had changed since our last visit.  He knew that we didn't look at a menu  and where there for our Happy Hour usual.  He failed to inform us that the wings were no longer part of the Happy Hour menu.. We also asked about the lack of cheese and green onion.  He mentioned that the girl brought that brought us our food told him about it, but nothing was done.  We didn't even mention that our Margaritas were shorter than normal.  So basically for us it was an Unhappy Hour for us  and we won't be returning.  We will find a new place to go and be happy."
Jennifer S.,"Highland, CA",0,42,,1.0,9/27/2015,"Wow! Raw tortilla chips-daughter and I were literally eating raw, very greasy corn tortillas. We asked to have them replaced and the chips were still raw and soggy. I had the Margarita Chicken mex bowl and it was horribly bland-even adding salsa did nothing. My daughter ordered the shrimp cajun pasta and it was so watery that the pasta was sitting in a puddle. Horrible meal and never going back."
Casey W.,"Redlands, CA",75,2,,1.0,3/23/2014,"Forgot my credit card, realized 15min after I had left, called and spoke to an employee who confirmed that they had it but were closing in 5min, she said that I could pick it up the following day and to ask the manager. Came in the following day and asked the manager who informed me that the card was not in the safe, he attempted to contact the employees from the night prior with no success. Later that night there were attempted charges made to  ... Will not return to this establishment..."
Andrew G.,"Beaumont, CA",8,81,12,1.0,12/17/2011,"I joined the yelp community specifically because I wanted to voice my opinion on how disappointed I was with this particular chili's restaurant.   I love a good night out at chilis and this was our groups first time frequenting this particular one in Redlands.  We were a group of 6 and due to the packed house, we were waiting in front of the restaurant with other groups.  The host came out several times to call different parties to be seated but never called us.  After 45 minutes, we finally asked if they were close to calling us.  They explained that they had given our table away since they called us and nobody answered.  This is impossible.  We heard every single party called and never did they call us. Anyways...after another 10 minutes they rushed us to a table that was filthy.  Our server was extremely indifferent.  He couldn't care less whether we had good or bad service.   In fairness, the food was served quickly and up to par (with Chilis standards) which was pleasing. Then when we asked for the check, we waited another 15 minutes for the server to return.  It was so bad, it was comical. Needless to say, with other options in the area, we won't be back. Get it together guys...you're better than that."
Susan W.,"Highland, CA",3,87,71,4.0,1/9/2013,"Service was good, food was good, noise level was loud. Okay if you want a quick lunch or spend some time for happy hour. Not great for a couples night out."
Meredith S.,"Redlands, CA",52,3,,1.0,3/8/2014,I just want to say that the food has really gone downhill at this location. We ordered the boneless buffalo wings and they came out dry. As in no sauce. The server had to bring out sauce to dump on them. Weird. I used to love the fajitas there too but they are terrible now too. There was no seasoning on them at all. It was even questionable if they were cooked all the way through.  I always liked it at chilis...now I will think twice about going there again.
Kacie P.,"Colton, CA",0,24,3,4.0,12/3/2013,"Our experience here was great! We were greeted by a very friendly host and our server, Kayla was awesome =) Very attentive and super sweet. Service was 5 stars, but I gave the restaurant 4 stars because the soup was pretty salty. Great experience overall, we'll be back for sure!"
Terra B.,"Pomona, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/24/2014,"Went here last night (a Friday) and we stood there for 10 minutes waiting to be seated. Nobody even made eye contact or acknowledged us for that whole period of time. Just as we were about to give up and leave the waitress runs up and seats us.  When we were finally seated we ordered quickly and our appetizer came without issue. However, after we finished the appetizer we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our entree... and during that time we received exactly zero refills. We were told we were being served by a waiting team but I never saw the the waiter our waitress was supposedly paired with. Before the entree came a busboy came up and took our plate then told us to pay whenever we wanted. At this point we hadn't received our entree yet and here he thought we were DONE and ready to leave. Probably because we'd just been sitting there doing nothing but waiting for so long. The food was alright when it finally came but it took way too long! I didn't even get to take my leftovers with me because we had to go pick someone up and I wasn't willing to wait who knows how long to get a container. At least they have those tablets you can pay with at the table, or we would have been waiting another 30 minutes to pay the bill. I would NOT recommend going here. The staff shows very little consideration or care and we will not be coming here again. I'll just drive over to the Chili's on hospitality if I want to eat at one again... though after that experience I don't think I'll want to for some time."
Paul J.,"Yucaipa, CA",2,4,,2.0,6/13/2015,Ate here last night. Had the Rib Eye. It was terrible. Broccoli and the potatoes were good but the rib eye itself was not good. No taste at all. I was pretty disappointed.
Deneice C.,"Mentone, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2015,"I am sad to say, i have to cross this off of my list. One time, mistake, 2 times, getting worried, 3 times awfull food- it is what it is. It seems this location has gone downhill. This year i have been mad that i didnt just choose Bakers to eat, it is that bad. I have been going there since they opened, loved it......best happy hour around. Every Friday we were there. Another really really crapy thing, they do not use the ingredients that are supposed to be in the meals. They are cutting corners..it is priced for what the meal contains and leaving it out, is wrong, and the chicken, oh the chicken yuck, it is like biting through a tuff steak, almost not cooked. I will drive to the Beaumont one from now on."
Christy S.,"Redlands, CA",70,6,,1.0,7/17/2015,"Chili's To Go order was terrible! Portions too small, and over cooked.  They actually combined my entree with my wife's entree in the same box! Called back and spoke to a manager named Matt who was supposed to send us a ""freebie"" for next time. Nothing ever came. We won't be coming back to Chilis, nor will we recommend it...."
