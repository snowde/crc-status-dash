Kirari S.,"Colton, CA",303,181,691,3.0,2/18/2010,"I've always been a fan of Chili's whether its the one in SB or here in Redlands. But there is a difference between the two and that in service and food.  Obviously I only come to this one because it's down the street and closest to my work, so when my sister is in the area and she wants to eat there, this is the one we go to.  While other people have complained about this place, I really can't remember a time where I've had to wait a long time for my food, unless it was extremely busy. When I say extremely busy I mean having to wait at least 30-40 minutes to get table (in which I've only done once.)  For the most part the cooks here aren't bad and neither are the servers. There are some that are questionable, but that's only because my friend used to work here and tell me how much drama they are.  This last time I went here I ordered their shrimp with cheesy fries because those are addicting to eat, even at this location. The sauce with the shrimp is really good, so try it if you decide to come in. The waitress was really nice and honest, she did attend to us in a timely manner, she did forget my sourcream but apologized and brought some. She was really nice. My sister likes the chili here, she couldn't finish it either. I like the molton lava cake, its really good. Although when I did get it to go one time, I opened it when I got home and the cake was frozen. It's nice to know that all they do is pop this in the microwave or something when someone orders it."
Dave H.,"Highland, CA",20,33,,1.0,12/25/2011,"This was the wife and my first time eating at a Chili's and I can honestly say that it will also be our last. The prices for what is being served is a bit high. The '2 for $20' deal they have is also a joke. We chose the fried cheese entree and received 7 sticks. 7- now you'd think 'sharing' an entree would at least have an even number of items to split up evenly but apparently they wanted us to rip one in half or something. Anyways, the waitresses trade off frequently and we never knew which one to talk to or ask questions from. The half rack of baby back ribs I got came with very little fries and was positively horrible. Tasted like it was old and reheated or something. Little to no meat at all, and the sauce was dumped on so thick it was scary.  Damn near could stand a fork up on it...The mariara sauce for the cheese sticks was about the only thing good about my experience here. We'll never be going back to this locale (or even the Chili's chain) again."
Darek M.,"Helendale, CA",9,11,2,4.0,4/19/2014,Had great service and they were really friendly. Until it was time for our check then it seemed to take forever. Large menu there has to be something on there for everyone. I would say we will be back but I am not in Redlands very much.
James D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,5,2.0,3/26/2011,"I usually love this chain of restaurants but this last visit was funny but sad lol. First I was thrown off when I walked in, it was a male host with all male waiters on a Saturday night. I don't dock them for this at all I just have never seen a restaurant with all male staff lol especially on a Saturday. So when we get to our table our waiter sits us down and hands us our menus and wanders away. About ten minutes later he comes back to ask us for our drinks. Another 10 minutes and he's back asking for our order. We get a spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and then some fajitas and chicken fingers. He wanders over to the kitchen for a while then comes back to ask us our order again because he forgot to write down some of it hahaha. When we got our dip I almost choked from laughing... the amount of cheese they put on it was crazy and they somehow cooked it so the melted cheese was fused together in this unstoppable mass. We actually broke every chip trying to separate it LOL. But cheese aside this was by far the worst tasting spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had. Then the food gets to the table and the fajita trio was soo sad looking. It looked like they grilled the life out of the meats and veggies as they were all shrunken and dry. They were so small it looked like only half of the skillet was made. I didn't taste the chicken fingers but my date only ate about half saying they tasted weird.  Like I said usually I love this restaurant but this visit just made me laugh at the whole situation though I will be avoiding this location in the future.... My highlight of the night was seeing a mom at another table checking out the waiters rear for a good 15 seconds with a biiiig smile on her face!"
Emily M.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/1/2014,My boyfriend and I just had a great lunch here. We initially went to Red Robin on Lugonia and walked out after waiting 12 min at the table after being seated and were never helped. We decided to go to Chilis and we were blown away by the customer service and of course the food was amazing. Tried the new Tortilla Explosion salad and blueberry pineapple margarita. Thank you for a great experience :)
Nicole L.,"Redlands, CA",65,10,4,2.0,7/9/2014,I typically frequent this place at least once a week with my besties for our weekly dinner. Service is normally great with quick turnarounds for both appetizer and main dish orders as well as drink refills. But last week I lost all faith in my go to place... Ended up having to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to order our food then waited an additional 45/60 minutes for the food to come out. Friend ordered a beer and was brought the completely wrong brand. Drinks were refilled once out during the 2 1/2 hours we were there. Finally we were able to get our waitresses attention (she was talking to friends the whole time) we all handed her our cards and she decided that that was just for fun because she charged my card twice and some cards not at all. Wanting to relax and grab a drink and some dinner while hanging with friends after work should not have this many obstacles. I hope that a manager monitors this page and makes necessary changes.
Gemini R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,29,1,1.0,2/21/2014,Too bad Zero Stars is not an option. The food here is not prepared like the other Chili's restaurants I have been to. Ordered the Onion/Jalapeno Stack-it came out soggy-twice. Garlic bread was soggy. Cheese sauce in pasta was clumpy. Service was slow. Never again at this location. No manager to be found.
Angel S.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/14/2014,"YUMMO! Hats off to the Chef at the Redlands Chili's on Alabama. I always get the Parmesan Crusted Tilapia, oh man is it to die for. The parmesan & monetary Jack cheese is baked on to make a really nice crunchy crust, mmmm, then on top are tiny tortilla chip strips & topped with a drizzle of spicy chipotle-garlic butter, which I  always get on the side so I can dip to my liking. It's not super spicy but it does have a  spice to it, it's sooo good, every time I go now I can't divert my eyes long enough to order anything else. Also their ribs, caramel apples and fried garlic pickles are very very good. The fried pickles they say are homemade. Did I mention they also have a tasty berry margarita which comes with a handful of blueberries in it.Yum. Don't know about the other locations but this one always makes really good food & has had great service."
Steve A.,"Camas, WA",14,22,2,2.0,9/23/2011,I only go here when the wife wants to go. There is almost nothing that is healthy.  Huge calorie counts along with very high sodium.  The flavor isn't any better than what I can make at home. I don't even care for the chocolate shake that my wife likes so much. I would rather spend my money elsewhere.
Marlene D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2013,"I will never go back to this Chilis ever, the food was an absolute nightmare I have never seen rice served so raw in my life, just imagine eating plastic rice thats exactly how it tasted and the steamed veggies were served cold, I ordered steak, i had asked for it med-well and they gave it to me med-raw ... I very rarely ever complaining about food but this was just a bit much i didn't say anything to the server we just paid for the food and left ...besides that the service was great"
Matt P.,"Redlands, CA",110,25,,2.0,3/26/2011,"So we get a coupon for free chips and queso. I suppose queso in Chili's-speak means ""skillet filled with molten cheese food and meat balls"". I had to add the table ""salsa"" for anything resembling a kick, but hey it was free. The upside was the huge basket of thin, crispy tortilla chips, but maybe that was meant to fill us up before the entrees arrived.  The wife and I ordered a 2 for $20 deal and were happy to learn we could switch out the side dishes. She ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken while I opted for the baby back ribs. Her take on the chicken was ""uneventful"". The ribs on the other hand were slathered with a spicy-sweet sauce and what I'm sure was liquid smoke, that over powered the rather thin bones. At least the cinnamon apples were good.  Since I was still hungry I started nibbling on the fries that came with my son's kids meal. These little babies must have been brined in salt water, coated in MSG and then dusted with full can of Morton's before being tossed into the serving basket. Thankfully there was still some ""queso"" left that I could drown the potatoes in before consuming.  The second star was earned by the excellent service we received from Sabrina."
Kyle K.,"San Bernardino, CA",36,22,43,3.0,2/24/2013,"So I don't really expect much from these places. On two occasions the food was alright, the burgers aren't anything to write home about, especially since they use that weird smelling mayo that soaks into the shredded lettuce. However the appetizers are pretty good, and Chili's does have some good specials from time to time, I tried the Long Island ice tea and its pretty strong, so good marks on that. The only issue I've had with service is the frequency of refills, and maybe the place is a little too understaffed."
A.L. B.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,48,22,2.0,1/31/2013,"Pretty average if you ask me. I honestly didn't find anything that impressed me. I mean the customer service was great and the blackberry tea was great but, that doesn't make this place a 5 star place for the yelp community right. I mean I have only been to this Chili's once but I gotta say it didn't make me want to come back and celebrate. Sorry Chili's Crazy Fox says a mild 2 out of 5 is in order"
Sara K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,49,28,2.0,10/25/2013,Food is yummy!! Don't expect a refill on your drink or your table to be cleared. Waited for a good 30 minutes to get our check but we were not in a hurry:)
Mourad L.,"Redlands, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/13/2012,"Went there last night. Service was good, no waiting to get a table but the food was awful. I ordered their ""new"" 6Oz steak. It comes with broccolis and mashed potatoes. How bad can you mess this? The meat was watery. I thing they just pulled it from the freezer and put it on the grill. It had no taste, no seasoning. Patties from MacDonald had more taste than that steak. Broccolis were just plain. No seasoning just steamed broccolis. The mashed potatoes were decent. The cheese on top was not melted but it was the tastier element on my plate. I usually have a great time at Chili's but this last vsist was really disappointing."
Anisel M.,"Redlands, CA",0,24,,1.0,3/11/2014,"I called to order take-out food and nobody picked up. Got there and order stake, the place smell funny, like farm chicken, bad. I should have leave just by that but I wait for my order and took it home. I ate two bites of my stake, it was REALLY bad, tasted like rubber or plastic so I had to throw it away.... I was sick all night and couldn't even go to school today. This place should get an inspection or something. Really bad."
Christina D.,"Hesperia, CA",43,59,16,3.0,12/6/2010,"I know people don't expect the greatest food from chain restaurants but I usually like everything I get from Chili's. However, my last visit at this location found my husband and I waiting at a dirty table for too long before being cleaned by our server who reeked of cigarette smoke. Guess that smoke break took longer than expected. We received our appetizer and then our dinner about 30 seconds later! This wasn't our server's fault but this has happened at Chili's more than any other restaurant."
Johnathan A.,"Garden Grove, CA",23,39,2,1.0,3/6/2011,Yeah our waitress sucked ass. The food was ok. This place left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't think I'll be coming back.
Quelly F.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/10/2013,"First time at a Chili's restaurant and I enjoyed my experience! The food was good, the service was fantastic----- our waiters were prompt and responsive, and our food arrived rather quick. The bathrooms were also nice and clean. I left a satisfied customer."
Melissa T.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",138,209,6,1.0,7/19/2010,"I went to Chili's on a Saturday afternoon.  I had two children with me (7 & 9) & I ordered the ""bottomless"" soup and salad lunch combo.  The kids each ordered off the kids' menu.  Our server brought out the wrong drinks for us then we never saw him again.  I flagged down a manager who brought us the correct drinks & 25 minutes passed by & we still did not have our food.  I flagged down the same manager who found out our server never entered our order in.  He brought out our food right away but then he too disappeared.  I could see him walking the restaurant but everytime I tried to flag him down he looked the other way, or never saw me.  After not having anyone come by to ask for refills on my ""bottomless"" soup and salad combo, or drinks, I was able to get another manager for our check.  She then brought me the wrong check.  I had to go to the hostess in the front of the restaurant to get the correct check, which was full price!  I even pointed out the awful service I had received & all the manager did was smile, apologize & told me ""I hope you come back and visit us soon!""  No tip was left & I have left this feedback at Chili's main site.  It will be interesting to see if they bother to respond. **Note--I generally like going to Chili's (in San Bernardino) for lunch with coworkers & have nothing against the soup & salad combo I stick to.  I will remember to avoid the Chili's in Redlands and stick to the tried & true San Bernardino store."
