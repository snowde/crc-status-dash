Steve D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,140,,1.0,1/31/2008,"A trainwreck coming to a neighborhood near you! Lesson learned:  When drinking in a bar don't say ""FUCK"". OK - out of all the crappy, bland chain restaurants I regularly avoid (Applebee's, RedRobin, Denny's, etc.) Chili's was one that you could get me into occasionally.  Fair beer selection and even though the food is nothing to shout about it was at least cooked right and served with some basic level of efficiency. So we went into the new local edition and even the basics were lost.  We saddle up to a tall table in the bar - nice I like these - can see the games on the TVs - so far so good.  I ask the server for an IPA - clueless...  Hello  - you're a server in a bar and you have zero awareness of what is currently a very popular beer style.  An average person off the street would be forgiven but YOU WORK IN A BAR!!!  HELLLOOOO!  So we settle on SNPA - at least they have something with hops. So we're enjoying ourselves in the BAR drinking BOOZE (Note: shelves and walls are filled with BOOZE - definably a bar - check) In the course of enjoying our conversation I said Fuck - yeah the F bomb.  We're in a bar so it's safe right??  Wrong - I got nazi death stares from the next table. Now I don't cuss much but to color a BAR story with a well placed ""FUCK"" is not all bad - right??   Well the chubby burbites at the next table brought little Skippy and Bippy (ages about 10 or 11) into the BAR with them so apparently all the adults in the BAR drinking BOOZE all around them now had to behave as though we're in elementary school.  Whatever... So the food came - a couple of dishes at a time but it got there and pretty much everything was screwed up.  Once the food was dumped off on the table no one came back around until .... mmmm....  yeah  - about Tuesday I think.  I had finished my fries waiting - took for freakin' ever!  As for mine - I wanted no sauce on my burger - it was slathered - once it came back it was wayyyy overcooked unless ""medium"" means leather - I don't know. Took to  long to get the check handled and get out of there too.  Overall not up to the even limited standards of other Chili's I've visited."
Sonya H.,"San Bernardino, CA",17,10,,1.0,7/1/2009,Here's the short of it--if you want your food before the icecaps melt and you're sharing your yummy Sam Adams Summer Ale with a polar bear--GO ELSEWHERE.
Christine M.,"Highland, CA",1,25,19,1.0,8/23/2012,"STAY FAR AWAY!!!!! Sign in window has an ""A"" rating, should be a ""C"".  Just after we finished our dinner my husband says, ""there are 2 cockroaches crawling on the back of the booth we were in.  I felt like I needed to disinfect my hands after touching the filthy menu.  The floor was covered in food and napkins.  Will never go back!"
Jason P.,"Redlands, CA",6,22,1,3.0,4/17/2010,Why in the world would they take their two best selling soups off of the menu? Bring back the broccoli cheese!
Merle K.,"Riverside, CA",0,21,,5.0,12/23/2012,"Never had a problem at this Chili's but it's best during a weekday because of the heavy  shopping traffic on weekends. The Managers here are some of the best I've seen in a Chili's restaurant, so they monitor things fairly well, and if I have any problems (rarely if ever), they square it away especially the GM. The clientele are fairly respectable too, compared to some other Chili's I've been to in the area."
Katie R.,"Redlands, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/28/2010,"I love the Redlands location of Chili's because the staff is so awesome and kind! They know when to come and check up on things, and they are always super positive! I recently went there to celebrate my birthday with my frriend and I love the ""Chilis Happy Birthday song"" its so catchy! And the desert is so good! I also very much love the atmosphere of this location! It always is playing great music and its always clean and spiffy! I love this location so much, I dont think I would go to any other Chili's (:"
