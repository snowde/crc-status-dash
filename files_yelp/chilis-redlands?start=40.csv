Julian M.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Very bad experience with this restaurant. We visiting the restaurant on 7/26/17. We were seated all was good. The waitress was very polite. We sat down, and ordered. About 30 minutes in, we still had not received our order. When we finally did, the order was wrong. We asked for one of the plates to be corrected  (allergic to onions) and it took another 15 minutes to get it back. When we asked why it took so long, they stated they were backed up. The thing is, 2 parties of 6 or more came and sat after us and they received their food long before us. I was excited to try this place out. Very disappointed. Food was good, service was pretty bad."
Dorothy G.,"Colton, CA",147,52,204,3.0,4/13/2016,Am only giving them three rstars because we waited almost over 45 minutes for a 35$ for 2 meal mmhhh that doesn't seem right and when I asked about the specials on drinks the waitress looked very confused #learnwhatyoursaling ..my chicken tenders were under cooked in the middle still cold but not all was bad for some reason the appetizers were great the the dessert was a wonderful warm it just seems like there's lack of caring :-/ which bums me out cuz b4 I say I won't go back I always give a place a second try well hope next time it's better smh...chilis what happen ?

Paul S.,"Tustin, CA",1374,444,3606,4.0,10/30/2014,"I don't understand the low reviews, keep your expectations low and you won't get disappointed. I can't say I have had a bad time at this location, and if anything, it's more reliable than the Hospitality Lane store.  The food is consistent, which is nice, and the new pay at your table option is cool. The printer jammed on our table, but we applied a free appetizer coupon and gift card with a modest balance with no hassles.  The burgers are big and tasty, I always liked the fajitas, and of course the baby back ribs! Chops and salsa are always a good munchie, and the Oktober Fest on tap made it a good lunch."
Noah S.,"Forest Falls, CA",0,42,7,2.0,5/18/2016,"I used to like Chili's. Then I ate here. Got the southern smokehouse burger and onion rings (extra dollar). The burger was meh (edible but not tasty), and the onion rings were like cardboard. Also, the small beer I ordered was $5.89, which is insane. Two stars because while the food and prices are terrible, the service was actually pretty good :)"
Robert B.,"Redlands, CA",0,26,1,2.0,10/24/2016,"I used to really like this place. But recently, service has been very slow, food comes cold, and hamburgers are dry and tasteless. I went with family on Sunday and got a hamburger. They forgot the tomato and the lettuce was old with black edges. I took my knife out of the paper pack and it was dirty with food still attached."
Victor H.,"Redlands, CA",7,7,3,1.0,5/19/2017,"I will advise you not to go to this Chili's. Our party of four spent over $100 on our bill and had to wait 45 minutes to get our food when the restaurant was only half full. After we received our dinner and after we paid our bill, I requested to speak with the manager, Jerry, to express our concern with waiting so long for our food. Jerry immediately told me that our ticket only took 20 minutes to finish which was a lie. I showed Jerry my text message when we were called to our table (9:27pm) and when we got our food (10:32pm). I gave them about 15 minutes to get our drinks and take our entree orders which I thought was fair. All I asked of Jerry was for him to hear my concern and instead he argued with me about the wait time after I showed him the text message again. I was not looking for a gift card or free meal, I just wanted a simple apology or at least for them to take ownership of their mistake. Unfortunately, it hurts me but I will not be back. I just feel as if I was not taken serious due to the color of my skin and I was not heard. Especially given the fact that all of the tables surrounding us (who got there after us) were already eating when we barely received our food. I wish at least some of you will see this and be wary of going. Best of luck to you."
Tracie G.,"Highland, CA",26,1,,1.0,10/9/2016,If I could give a negative star I would.  Was invited last nite by friends to have dinner. We arrived around 9pm. We have no complaints about our server this is all about the food. First the soup arrived cold. He took it back.  The second bowl was a tad warmer. Then our cheese dip came out tasted good but we found a piece of plastic in it. Our entrees came out only minutes after the appetizers. So the manager came out and said sorry (I bet she says that a lot )    Entrees tasted ok but still not hot. Just warm. So we got a lava cake for our plastic cheese dip and guess what? NO LAVA !! cold in the middle on both of them.  So we got 2 more. Warm lava. Bill came. Had 2 soups on there only ordered 1 and still charged us for the plastic cheese dip. will never go back.
Nickie O.,"Redlands, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/8/2017,"We go to Chili's often. Always enjoy the food. We sit in bar, Carly waits on us, and the service is excellent."
Lisa T.,"Redlands, CA",102,2,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Went in for a small little celebratory meal for my son passing his driving test, nothing major just wanted a quick bite and this location is close to home. We arrived and waited about 20 min to be seated. My husband ordered a cup of chili and was told that they had been out of chili since noon. Really? How do you run out of something and not remake or do what you have to do before the dinner crowd to ensure that one of your biggest sellers (in the name) is available. He made another choice, we waited about 35-40 min for our food before finally asking why it was taking so long. As soon as we asked our food was delivered in less than a minute. It had been sitting in the window and was pretty much room temp when it arrived to the table. We are because we were hungry but we won't be back. The manager nicely comped 10% off of our bill, but I would have rather had hot food and paid full price which is what's expected."
Sam P.,"Redlands, CA",374,494,251,4.0,12/2/2014,"We've gotten closer to the end of waitstaff. One day, many waitstaff will be replaced by robots.  At Chilis, they've put a touch screen monitor on every table. With this monitor, you can order drinks from the bar, order dessert, see an interactive menu, play games, and pay by credit card (you still have to order your first round of drinks and your appetizer and entrée from a human being).  I bet one day, a robot will bring your order to your table for you while you stare into your phone.  Eliminates all interpersonal interaction. I hate it that they put the caloric information on items.  I didn't want to know that the bloomin' onion was 1,400 calories.  I just want to stuff my face with delicious greasy goodness dripping with ranch dressing.  To save my pants from bursting at the seams, I had the sirloin steak with steamed broccoli with only 250 calories.    It was pretty darn good.   The staff are well trained; they check on you and another one comes to let you know the first one is on break then yet another one comes to bring you your food.  It's like a clown car of waitresses in there.  But at least you know that you're going to get taken care of."
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,3.0,9/6/2013,"Diane and I had a pleasant meal here late at night.  I received complimentary Guac, real spicy salsa, and very light and warm Tortilla Chips pursuant to a dining incentive coupon I had received online from the corporation.  The guacamole, with chopped tomatoes and grilled corn, was spicy, cold but not creamy, and very good.  I followed this with excellent Terlinga Chili that was heat hot after stirring.   Accompanying my entree of Country Fried Steak were gravy-laden Mashed Potatoes, real sweet Corn on the Cob, and heavily buttered Garlic Bread.  All on my plate was pretty salty--even a tough piece of meat.  The rest of the Country Fried Steak was suitably tender and tasty. Service was very good amid a loud party ambiance.  And, the food was all very reasonably priced.  We were content! XXX-1/2 stars overall on this mid-summer evening!"
Tracy A.,"Redlands, CA",5,40,2,1.0,2/24/2017,"Update: its a few weeks later and my husband and I thought we'd give this place another chance. It was still awful. This time the service was good and we were seated quickly. We were waiting and waiting for our food, the waitress kept saying ""sorry For the wait"", not her fault. We asked for a discount, not even a comp or free app just a ten percent discount we asked because it was a whole hour. The manager comes out, and starts interrogating us about how long we took to order, he explained that it may have seemed like an hour because maybe we ordered drinks or maybe we needed more time to look at the menu (he was making it seem like we racked up the time), he said but it really 45 minutes according to the ticket and not an hour (fine) and that 45 minutes for a friday night wasn't too bad. We said well why is the waitress apologizing ""for the wait"" if its normal, we dine out all the time and never wait for food that long. he did the discount and said we could pay on the screen, we had been planning on getting a dessert but he didn't even ask us. So we just paid and left. The service was good, food good but not even an apology from the manager.  lThis place has really gone down hill.We were seated,  no one told us about the three course special. Took 15 minutes for our drinks to come. Not even specialty drinks, but sodas and waters. Our son got his juice, but no straw for his kids cup. Two people at our table of six didn't even get their sodas- had to remind our server. Had to ask for napkins. No napkins at all. Napkins were put in front of the person who asked, none for the rest of us apparently. Im not even going to review the food.... Had to ring up our own bill on the touch screen at our table which is fine, but it was out of paper. Had to wait for that. This was on a Tues night, not even a busy time! Chilis you need to step up your game."
Steve S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,22,5,1.0,8/1/2016,Wow been here for about 37 min. It took 20 min to get my drinks.  Family of 4. Ordered still waiting.  Floors are dirty.  Service is bad.  They are treating customers as if they are closing. It says they close at 11:30 poor service.  I'll update when i get my food.  So sad my son and i love chili's
Andrew D.,"San Bernardino, CA",28,82,63,5.0,12/29/2015,You can never go wrong with chilis. I love the service at this place. Very clean. The bar tender was cute and polite to the non drunk people. We all sat in the bar area for my cousins 21st birthday. Great place for the game.they have like 8 tvs.
Et U.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,38,87,4.0,7/2/2016,"The overall experience is a four star but hit with some low scoring glitch to the appetizer- fried pickle. The sliced pickles were not crispy and was heavily saturated (greasy as if from sitting in fryer too long). My quesadilla explosion salad was a decent 3.5, my friend had sirloin steak was excellent and my other friend had an absolutely delicious Margarita grilled chicken ....I even wanted that for my order after tasting it.  Our server Charice is professional, friendly and really attentive at what she was doing without smothering the experience."
Stephanie N.,"Newport Beach, CA",47,25,5,1.0,12/3/2015,"Wow, quite possible the lowest quality of food I have ever gotten.  I ordered through Grub to Go because i have two sleeping children and needed delivery.  I ordered the steak fajitas which cost me $14 and some change.  What got to me was barely edible. The steak was almost non-existent and tough to chew and the ""caramelized"" onions were barely cooked!  Plus they only give you three mini flour tortillas, like that is supposed to be enough to put your food in.  I will never be ordering from a Chili's again.  It felt like they half-assed it because they knew it was a to-go order and that they wouldn't have to deal with a customer.  If I was there at the restaurant and this came, I would have sent it right back.  This was the worst $14 I've ever spent.  I even had to give them tip for this because I ordered through Grub to Go.  Get your act together Chili's."
Joella O.,"CA, CA",6,20,14,5.0,7/10/2016,"I recently went with my partner to chilies to try their Cajun shrimp pasta and shrimp tacos and I must admit, they were incredibly delicious!! It made me forget why I stopped coming to chilies.. Last time I was there (few years ago) their shrimp fajitas were not the best but I have noticed that their great quality food is improving. The quality isn't just great, but their prices and customer service are as well! (:"
Tamara W.,"Crestline, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Waited 45 minutes to be brought a cheese quesadilla that was no longer even warm. Ordered with no sour cream but it had sour cream that had been scrapped off sloppily. When we turned the quesadilla over, lettuce and tomato had been squished into the bottom. They turned it over like we wouldn't notice. Also ordered a taco and enchilada. Brought out the taco but the enchilada wasn't ready. No beans or rice. Never checked back or served drink refills. Manager credited the meals, but not my drinks after we had waited 45 minutes for our meals. Bad business practices."
Joe R.,"Redlands, CA",3,46,3,1.0,8/10/2016,"Horrible service. I am the biggest tipper i know and i walked out before seated. I walked in and there was maaaaaybe 10 people in whole place, half the place closed off at 9pm for ""cleaning"" and the hostess says itll be 10 min and ignored me as maybe 6 or 7 employees just talked and giggled. Heres the real funny part... i leave and while im walking out a older couple is walking in... i am pulling out of parking lot and look over and they seated the older couple. I had a great experience with buffy the server there in past... but she wasnt there or the service this time"
M P.,"Yucaipa, CA",61,6,2,2.0,6/12/2016,I have eaten at this Chili's many times throughout the years but wow what a disappointment.  Sunday at 1:30 floors were dirty with a bandage on the floor to give an example.  Then the hostess wiped the table we were going to sit at but left is wet and bench was fithly with cheese.  The food was ok and service was ok but didn't have many check backs to the table.  Probably won't be back.
