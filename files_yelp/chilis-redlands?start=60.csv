Dj R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,40,7,5.0,8/15/2015,"Awesome service, awesome smothered burritos, awesome experience. Why the bad reviews? No sign of what was written."
David G.,"Highland, CA",74,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,Slow service people seem annoyed when you ask them for utensils.  My order was brought out for me and my kids a total of 4 missing with out napkins or utensils . So when I asked about it still about 5 - 8 min wait on just utensils and still about a 10 min wait on fries maybe more worst service I've ever gotten from a chilies wouldn't recommend this location to anyone .
Kristi M.,"Calimesa, CA",0,14,2,3.0,7/22/2016,The atmosphere is always pleasant but the food quality has declined dramatically in the past year or so. I ordered the ol timer burger and it was horrible.
Jackie D.,"Highland, CA",47,19,6,2.0,4/28/2016,"Party of four showed up for lunch on a Friday. I've seen so many ads for their lunch combos I'd figured they would be able to get a party in and out during a typical hour lunch. Boy was I wrong. We ordered two plates of tacos, a burger, and a salad. It took almost 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Taking into account the few minutes drive time there and back, that left us with less than 10 minutes to eat. The food was fine. Not spectacular, but they shouldn't advertise their quick lunch combos if they can't get you in and out."
Theresa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,9,3,5.0,2/26/2016,"I have to say it's THE BEST customer service we (My boyfriend & I ) have ever experienced!! On a very busy night, in the bar area, we only waited 15 min, and got the best host.  Her name is Nadine, was attentive, kind, funny & very detail oriented.  I couldn't ask for a better night! Thanks girly!!  We will be coming back"
Sofia P.,"San Bernardino, CA",488,5,,3.0,7/3/2016,"I was at this place with a party of four this past thursday around 1:00pm. They seem fully staffed which is great, the food was good, our server was decent, but we waited about 30 minutes for our meal. The wait was way too long. Ok experience, could be better."
Kiara C.,"Redlands, CA",36,52,16,2.0,2/22/2015,"THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY FOOD !  when I told waiter , he sent manager  Jessica to apologize n paid for my plate . Good customer services my whole meal should of been taken care off ! Never again will I come to this restaurants ."
Tammy Z.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/15/2016,"This restaurant has gone downhill and we won't be going back. I ordered the fajitas with chicken and steak. There was very little meat and the steak was inedible. The plate was literally 3/4 onion! Add to this the fact that I was given dirty silverware and no one tried to stop three little kids from running around inside the restaurant screaming at the top of their lungs. I love children, but that was ridiculous! If you absolutely have to eat here, bring your own silverware, earplugs, and never order steak!"
Elena T.,"San Bernardino, CA",7,34,13,5.0,1/20/2016,I enjoy coming to chilis every time I come here always greeted with a smile even if I'm coming in for a to go order. Food is always great it's rare if I ever have something bad to say but what I like is that manger does come around to ask make sure everything is good and If something isn't right they make sure to fix it and make ur visit pleasant highly recommend coming for lunch time great good adorable prices for the amount of food
Chris C.,"Riverside, CA",6,2,2,1.0,4/26/2015,"Had fish tacos last night about 10:30pm. It was a new menu item of 3 tacos,  black beans and rice. Flavor wasn't just OK,  a bit spicy. I only drank water.  It made me sick.  Had Diarrhea all day today and feeling lousy.   I don't  think I will eat at Chili's unless my friends drag me there.  I'll  stick to the drinks."
Sada F.,"Highland, CA",37,15,15,1.0,12/10/2014,"I've been a regular to the Chili's in Redlands, the service and food have been consistently good... until tonight. I ordered to go, I  checked my order and noticed an appetizer was missing. I spoke to the waitress and she said they put the appetizer with the kid's burnt cheese pizza (was missing the kid's fries and drink). I told the waitress we requested fries with the kid's pizza. She gave me an order of sweet potato fries (smh). I didn't want to wait longer for fries so I left. The pretzel sticks was overly heated that we had a hard time chewing them, the guacamole was brown as if they were left outside for too long, and the chips were stale. Our Cajun chicken pasta was mushy AND was missing the garlic bread. We were hungry too but so dissatisfied with everything that we didn't finish our meal. What a HUGE let down."
Edgar M.,"Corona, CA",458,17,5,3.0,2/24/2016,"The food was good , but don't order off the lunch menu, the burger patties come out burnt and its not satisfying. The wait was fast. But getting our bill took a long time."
Memo R.,"Redlands, CA",227,5,4,3.0,4/12/2016,"So I came in here with my family on a Tuesday after 4pm. Looking forward to having happy hour. They sat us on the table, but than they couldn't serve happy hour menu in that certain table area. Which I thought was BS. Than the table was dirty and full of crumbs which my wife had to clean. It's not her job to do that, but okay. Not coming back here at all. Even the waiter non attentive. Food was okay. I'm not going to complain."
Cynthia C.,"San Bernardino, CA",74,11,2,3.0,3/5/2016,Had reservations for 5 for a party of 20 it was 6 when we sat down. But once we got served food was good. Just a long wait.
Ashlee R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,44,34,5.0,10/11/2015,This place just gets better and better! I love their New Mexican meals. They are delicious! Service is always good. I love the computerized system in table tops (to order-to pay-so easy!) PLUS they have a great rewards program now too that I am really enjoying :)
Effie W.,"Covina, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/1/2016,"Food was salty af. Onion rings & chicken crispers tasted like the oil was old or burnt. Literally, put water in my alfredo because it was so salty. I really wish I would have told them I didnt want it, and my garlic toast didnt come until we were done eating... worst Chilis food Ive ever had. The server was cool tho."
Michael T.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",1,8,,1.0,9/25/2014,"Never order anything that involves cookery for a to go order. You're probably safe with precooked chicken wings, chips & salsa, etc. Order a steak to go? Good luck. We all enjoy seared ahi, right? Seared, raw steaks? Not really, especially when the temperature was ordered ""medium"". When inquiring with the manager, I was told, and I quote, ""the steaks are frozen and maybe the cooks aren't getting the timing right"".....?.........and I thought a raw steak was the issue?  Wow. We all know, we get what we order at a place like Chili's; cheap bar food. But pre-frozen steaks, that are raw because the cooks are  throwing them on the grill while still frozen?? Shame on you.  Yes, the manager did the right thing, and offered to replace the whole meal, or give a $25 giftcard, that's not the point. I now have to figure out which despised, family member/friend, will receive the giftcard, as I will no longer eat here. Sending raw beef to patrons is unacceptable. Cooking frozen beef is unacceptable.  I have now wasted an entire 30 minutes of my life (almost getting a meal, talking to the manager, and writing a review about raw/uncooked beef) and I AM STILL HUNGRY????? I am HANGRY, but this place really deserves no stars, and a shutdown from the health dept.  This place is worthless. Order beer from the bottle, and say a prayer before you eat their microwaved bar food."
Git Sum C.,"Redlands, CA",4,12,,5.0,10/26/2015,"Some MNF and ice cold beers. Can't beat it. HH is pretty good too. Service is fast at the bar, never an empty glass."
Krista N.,"West Hollywood, CA",2,22,3,1.0,8/18/2015,"There were no drink prices, so the whole time our group had to ask, ""How much for this one? What about that one?"" It defeats the reason for a drink menu. They don't even know the price until they ring you up. They lost our money because it's so frustrating when people have secret prices. We don't create mystery bills. The restaurant was also dirty. And it is obvious that everyone there hates there job. I don't blame them though. Whoever is in charge of the secret menu and the cleaning need to put some effort in."
Italia L.,"Upland, CA",23,41,66,5.0,6/8/2014,"We where around the area and decided to stop by. First off, it is a great location and it is very easy to find which is always a plus. Secondly we saw the watermelon margarita on the door and it looked delicious so we gave it a try and it did not dissapoint! We sat at the bar and our service was awesome. The food was good as well! We will defiantly be stopping by here again the next time we are in the area."
