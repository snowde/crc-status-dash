Martha M.,"El Segundo, CA",717,867,4118,4.0,5/19/2012,"I actually liked this Chili's, more so than the one's in LA or OC for that matter....we got seated right away (on a busy Friday night w/the Laker Playoffs, among the other major sports/games...LA Kings, Dodgers, etc...), our server was prompt & friendly, the food was good, drinks always good....the only little thing that might have needed improvement, was that they should sweep under the tables, because it was messy, and not just our table, but I noticed that all around, & would have made it a perfect experience....but aside from that it was a good experience....  And oh yeah, they serve HANGAR 24.......yah!"
Mari R.,"Colton, CA",2,42,43,5.0,2/6/2016,"I went to Chili's today for the first time, honestly, I wasn't looking forward to it because of some of the reviews on Yelp, but like a lemming, I followed the crowd and jumped over the cliff.  I ordered a combo plate of half a rack of ribs with grilled shrimp, got stuffed mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese for my sides and mango iced tea.  All I can say is YUM!  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone, the shrimp were flavorful and the mashed potatoes, well, all I could think is, is that I could most certainly eat these for every meal for the rest of my life!  The macaroni and cheese was so creamy and the bread crumbs on top just set it off!  The mango tea was really good, too!  We had tried the eggrolls for appetizers and I liked them...chicken, spinach, cheese, corn, peppers..not HOT spicy, but flavorful-spicy!  Those, along with the chips with salsa and guacamole were fresh and GREAT.  My husband got a combo fajitas plate and loved it (couldn't eat all of it!) and my daughters both got bacon classic cheeseburgers, made to their order (well done, no tomato, no cheese, blah, blah).  They said they loved this Chili's burgers over all other restaurants.  It was really busy in the restaurant but the waitress (pregnant even!) was very attentive and checked back often.  The parking lot was packed, but we found parking that let us burn off a few calories (very few, believe me) and were surprised to get seated almost immediately.  I will definitely be back...maybe for my birthday, even...and I go to my FAVORITE place for my birthday each year-- it may have just gotten usurped!"
Dale P.,"Highland, CA",112,83,18,3.0,5/29/2014,"We eat here regularly and are usually satisfied by the service and food. You know what you are getting and can usually count on consistency. Not tonight. The spinach/artichoke dip was not as good as normal, the service was slow, and the overall experience was below par.  We sat in the bar and I think our waitress was taking care of the entire bar area. There was a wait for a table but I got up to use the restroom and noticed that the restaurant wasn't even half full. It looks like they were way understaffed tonight.  Won't keep us from coming back but if this is a sign of things to come we will go somewhere else."
Julianna C.,"Redlands, CA",33,8,1,1.0,11/1/2015,"The service is just awful! You would think on a Saturday night they would have enough staff, but nope. After waiting 30 minutes to be seated we waited another 15, and no one came to our table. A group of 6 sat at a table right in front of us and they were quickly approached by a server.... It was Halloween and the our children were excited to go to dinner after trick or treating. We ended up just leaving, this is not the first time this has happened. The service is always horrible, I understand waiting to be seated, but once you're at the table there should be no reason to have to wait another 20mins just for drinks. Never again will I attempt to go back to this location."
Vanessa T.,"Fontana, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/21/2015,"I just left this establishment and definitely will NOT be returning. Granted, it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, but the place was completely empty. There were maybe a couple of other people there. Anyway, the service was terrible. Anytime I asked my server for anything she acted like I was bugging her (to do her job). She was rude, seemee annoyed, and was not attentive at all. I didn't even get her name because she didn't have a name tag on. I ordered the fajitas trio with chicken, steak, and shrimp. The chicken was extremely dry and bland. The steak and shrimp, however were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The toppings came in tiny little portions and I had to ask for more cheese and sour cream. I had a margarita, which basically tasted like they used the cheapest tequila ever. So basically the food sucked and so did the service. I will not be returning here."
Davaughn M.,"Fontana, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/25/2015,CJ is the epitome of great service. Will be returning to this chilis. Thanks Cameron.
Aspen H.,"Pasadena, CA",32,341,382,4.0,4/16/2014,"Went for lunch with friends today,  ordered full rack of  baby ribs, ""Pick & Mix"" something like that. It was good and tasty. $18 without salad or soup was dissapointed but french fries was great, crispy & delicious!"
Erin R.,"Redlands, CA",5,5,1,3.0,9/12/2015,Decent service and consistent food. We like to sit in the bar area - less wait and can see the TVs.
Merav L.,"Napa, CA",91,12,8,5.0,6/25/2015,I never go to chilis but my friend took me. We played the trivia games which were heat and only a dollar for like 4 games. The Caribbean salad sucked but the service was great! Big ups to our server Lauren who was amazing!!!
Jake R.,"Anaheim, CA",1,27,1,4.0,5/9/2015,"Not a whole lot to say. The service was good and the food was good. I'd definitely come back. Also, I won two games of trivia on the tablet so I'm pretty much awesome"
Jordan L.,"Redlands, CA",0,2,6,2.0,3/28/2016,"The last few times I've been here, the food has been quite good. Unfortunately, I think this is the last time I'll be visiting this establishment. All I could taste in my salad was onion, my broccoli was turning brown, our waitress was nowhere to be found for an extended period of time, and my dinner date and I had to ask for new, CLEAN silverware because it was clear our fork and knife had not met the dishwasher since their last use. I'd like to rate Chili's better, but I just can't."
Sandy J.,"Whittier, CA",0,13,6,1.0,5/26/2015,"The wait time was 45 minutes because we had a party of 11 you think when they sat us down we would have had silverware! No. Our appetizers came without silverware delivered to us by the Manager. When the meals came out for some reason I was brought Chicken fajitas not the Steak and Shrimp I ordered well done not burnt. Food final came Streak burnt the party next to us said what's burning?? MY FOOD! Charcoal black. My party was half way done with their food I just cancelled my order. It wasn't the waitress fault for the burnt food, maybe the missing silverware. But at no time did the manager come to our table very bad service!"
Monica P.,"Redlands, CA",13,10,1,2.0,1/24/2015,Food is good ... But the hostess really turned me off. She had the worse attitude I thought she was working without pay.
Chris C.,"Highland, CA",1,2,,3.0,8/16/2015,We went into chilis on a busy night it was yesterday around 7 it was for a suprise navy homecoming the server was Heidi she was good but she was annoyed with one of the people we were with and that defiantly showed over all everything else was great.
Gabby V.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/8/2013,"Food is good, as expected. However, the service isn't substantial. Sat (on multiple occasions) at my table for around 5-10 minutes before getting service and drink refills are just as bad. Also, I always order a margarita and it always is served in a different glass than the last time. Sometimes the margarita comes in a mug, and sometimes it's in a glass. Last piece of advice: bring a jacket. It's freezing in there. If you are just going there for the food, do it. It's cheap and good. But if you expect good service and consistency, I'd say to find another venue."
Cortney W.,"Redlands, CA",0,16,15,3.0,3/11/2015,"First impression: there was a wait time when there were open tables in open areas. I used the restroom while waiting and one of the stalls in the women's didn't have a lock on it.  Also there wasn't a bag in the women's receptacle so the disposed feminine hygiene products in there were exposed. Second, every drink order took about ten minutes to get to the table. The bartender was too ""behind"" to pour a draft beer within a minute or two. My friend got a kids grilled chicken that looked like it had been picked off a buffet platter. So dry the kid could barely eat it. My enchiladas were also crunchy from sitting under a heat lamp. It tasted good once you got to the saucy parts, but the beans and rice started to crack under the heat. Overall it wasn't terrible, but I've seen better from Chili's."
Wait N. SE E.,"Redlands, CA",30,25,156,5.0,8/16/2014,"We're becoming regulars the Happy Hour everyday from 3PM-6PM is contributing to that, but  the service from Andrea was excellent!!!"
Stephanie G.,"Redlands, CA",0,18,8,5.0,4/15/2015,"Great food with excellent service. I go here pretty often and must say I have not had a bad experience. The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is very upbeat and comfortable, I love where it is located because I usually do some shopping before or after a meal."
Jnj L.,"Highland, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2015,"I never wrote a review before. If the place suck, I just don't come back. This time I really want everyone to not waste their time. My husband, myself and our two girls walked in, there were five employees, it's slow and people were eating and drinking. No one needed help except us, the walked in. We waited to be seated. And that's the problem, we waited and waited and waited till my daughter needed to go used the restroom. While we waited none of the five employees would look our way and even walked passed us like we don't exist. By the way, it's a slow slow lunch time and the served customers did not need serving. We were the only one that needed to be service. ... I read the others reviewed and now I know why it's slow for a lunch time in a busy and popular plaza."
Jesse B.,"Redlands, CA",99,1,,1.0,4/5/2015,Walked in the door and the hostess  couldn't be pulled away from her phone long enough to take us to our seat just pointed to the bar area and said there's a booth over there I'd have walked out but wife wanted chili's.
