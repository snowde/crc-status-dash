Page H.,"Tampa, FL",39,76,103,5.0,6/29/2017,"Came here for lunch today with my daughters. We had an Amazing server. Her name was Taylor. She was happy, and sweet. She anticipated our every need.  Our food was delicious! Probably the best food I have ever had a Chilis. My daughter got the new chicken and waffles. I got the grilled chicken explosion salad. My youngest daughter got cheeseburger sliders with fries. All of the food was yummy!"
Jaden W.,"Cedar City, UT",76,1,,3.0,10/21/2017,"The food was really good. I ordered the crispers coated in sauce. It took a while to get our food though. At first the waitress was very attentive, but then once we got our appetizer she kind of disappeared until we got our food, then finally refilled all our empty drinks. At the end, we waited a long time before she brought the check (or told us we are supposed to use the ziosk to pay which we didn't know). Besides her gradually not giving us very much attention, the food was great and everyone else was helpful when we asked questions."
Falaniko M.,"Waimalu, HI",513,6,5,5.0,1/12/2017,Our waitress Donica was amazing. We ordered Texas cheese fries and forgot to ask to take off the jalapeños. Without hesitation she brought us a new batch. Service like this is rare and I want to credit where it belongs. 5 Stars for the food and amazing service! Thanks to Donica for making our night!
Steve V.,"Herriman, UT",8,22,1,5.0,6/25/2017,Our visit tonight was great. Food was really good and the service was even better.  Kurt was our server and he worked hard for us.  We didn't have to ask for one refill. He was on top of it. My glass was never below the halfway mark. Offered us more chips when he noticed we were getting low. Really nice job Tonight Kurt.  Kitchen staff did a great job as well. Salads seemed very fresh. All food was good
Garth S.,"Holladay, Salt Lake City, UT",31,12,2,1.0,6/24/2017,"I ordered a sirloin stake cooked medium. The service was really great up to this point. I thought it was strange that the waitress had me cut in to the stake before she left the table. And it was pretty obvious that the stake was way over cooked. She happily took it back to the kitchen. Ok, up to this point I'm still a happy customer. I was really shocked when the cook came out to present his second attempt. He asked that I cut in to it. I could tell that I was quite tender. When I cut in to it it was blue. Rare. Not medium well. He offered to cook it longer but my wife was almost done eating by this time and I didn't want to wait. You know how they serve the steak with a glob o garlic butter?  Well, the stake wasn't even hot enough to melt the butter. I ate part of it that was cooked just right but 2/3 of it was rare and cold. Couldn't eat it."
James D.,"Herriman, UT",59,71,2,4.0,9/14/2016,"Food was decent for what you'd expect, wait staff was attentive and polite. Asked for a substitution on an appetizer, didn't come out that way. Not a major offense but worth mentioning. Only real complaint is that the timing between appetizers and entrees could be improved upon, you end up with too much food on your table and not enough of a gap to really enjoy the appetizer."
Tiffanie Z.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",1,28,24,4.0,7/2/2016,"This is one of our ""I don't want to cook"" places. April is our favorite server. If you can get her, you should. She is so friendly and nice.  The table side guac is my new favorite and I seriously find myself craving it all the time. I like how they're now making healthier options and giving better flavor to a lot of their dishes, that way you don't feel as guilty when you eat dessert!"
Josh M.,"Herriman, UT",15,20,7,5.0,9/24/2016,"Took the two younger kids for some mac and cheese.  I ordered the new sunrise burger.  Everything turned out great.  The food came quickly even on a Saturday.  The mac and cheese was a little chilled, but the kids loved it.  My sunrise burger was so tall I had to take bites like a snake stretching my jaw as far as possible, but it was so good. Our waitress was excellent.  She even remembered to bring what I had forgotten.  For whatever reason, usually most restaurants fail to keep the cheese off when I order food with no cheese.  Not only was there no cheese but she came by to make sure there was no cheese.  Excellent!  She even sent me off with an extra raspberry lemonade in a cup and a note wishing me a nice weekend.   Probably my best Chilis visit yet."
Joshua S.,"West Jordan, Salt Lake City, UT",100,242,321,2.0,7/15/2015,"This was one of the worst visits I've ever had to a Chili's. The only reason they're getting two stars instead of one star is that they were busy, but there certainly wasn't a line out the door and there were still a few empty tables. But, perhaps they were understaffed or something, because something was off. Not only did we have to wait nearly over an hour for food after we ordered (salads, burgers, fries, nothing too outrageous), but we didn't get drink orders that we placed multiple times. (At least said drinks didn't appear on our bill when it came time to leave). When the food finally came out, it was ""meh"" at best. My wife's salad came to the table in last place, and only after we reminded the waiter of the order. I also hate the nasty, sticky, food-encrusted credit-card readers they have at the tables. As if they weren't unpleasant enough to use, it prompts you to complete a survey every step of the way. While they might be secure enough (I have no idea how secure they are), I FEEL like I might as well hand my card to the nearest stranger and hope that he doesn't do anything with it, and that feeling makes me just not want to use it. Here's hoping that they get rid of the table-side card reader or at least give me the option of not having to use it when paying by card."
Sydney S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",120,15,6,5.0,3/10/2017,"Ask for Ali, she's the reason I'm even writing a review haha. She was great! I come to chili's so much i really don't know what to say about it, its always pretty great! I appreciate how clean this location was. Even with the crayon marks on the wall in our booth the restaurant was still cleaner then the one we live by and go to religiously (Midvale)."
Vodo L.,"Herriman, UT",0,4,,3.0,12/26/2016,"Let me start with the food is amazing and not overpriced. I recommend the chicken tenders or a burger if you choice..... Second is the service is good not the best ever but good so why do you give it a three star you ask?  Because of the bathroom, a toilet was broken along with a sink and paper towel roller, and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 2 years"
Nick S.,"North Salt Lake, UT",20,83,11,1.0,8/13/2015,"There is an obvious problem at this Chilis. We've been here before and it was fine, but the last two times were enough to get it banished from any future visits. The last time we waited with menus for over 20 mins until we finally got up and left. Servers would walk by quickly blatantly avoiding eye contact. The place was dirty and the rest of the tables were filled with neglected customers, though some had glasses of water. Another disappointing chapter in the chronicles of Chilis' downward spiral."
Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102,3.0,11/14/2013,"It's Chili's, and for some that may be all that I need to say - for what it is it's adequate.  However, I also want to make sure my review meets that criteria also, so to avoid it being just one sentence, here's a few synonyms to keep the reader engaged... regular, mainstream, fair, mediocre, ordinary, moderate, middle of the road, unexceptional, tolerable, passable.... I think you get the idea.  That describes Chili's food and service.  If you keep those in mind you'll not be disappointed!"
Corey B.,"Springville, UT",0,3,1,1.0,12/28/2015,One of the worst Chili's I have ever been to. Took over 1.5 hrs to get our food. Food came out cold.. They did give the meal for free because of the wait and the mess up on the orders. We will not be coming back to this chili's again.
Tyler S.,"South Jordan, UT",7,53,12,4.0,2/19/2016,I think chilli's is a good chain place. Is it perfect not independent but has good flavors
Serena B.,"Mineral Wells, TX",40,48,34,5.0,3/4/2016,We recently moved from Texas and it is nice to know there is a place to go that feels like home.  Most food in Utah I have noticed lacks flavor.. but Chili's here is just like the Chili's at home.  I have already eaten at this location twice and I will be back!
J W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,6,2,1.0,8/8/2015,Worst location the staff doesn't even care to offer you a drink.  We sat for 10 mins without anyone acknowledging us they sat is next to a table full of loud kids even though we told the hostess we wanted a bar seat.  We just got up and left.
Rachel T.,"Anaheim, CA",6,39,11,2.0,8/20/2015,"Came to Chili's for a family birthday celebration so we did have a larger party than usual. I understand that larger parties are more difficult to wait on; however, I don't feel there should be a difference of 30+ minutes from when the first person at the table receives their food vs. the last. By the time the last person got their food more than half of the table was already finished eating. Food and dessert orders just took way too long and food was mediocre. It didn't feel like the waiters were ever rushed to take care of our table when everything was so far behind. Lastly, most restaurants will at least try to begin clearing the table when people are finished with their meals and before dessert, but not one thing was cleared the entire time. There was a table right behind us that left and still within an hour of them being gone not a single dish had been cleared."
Crystal B.,"Millcreek, UT",33,16,3,3.0,10/15/2015,Service is a hit or miss at most Chili's.. Food is usually great. Had one horrible experience but the manager (beautiful blonde lady) made it right! We came back and used the coupons she gave us for free meal and the servers Paige and Kenzi owned it! Thank you guys for making it right!
Shanie D.,"Maspeth, NY",4,36,4,1.0,4/11/2015,Horrible. Took 40 minutes to get our food. Then it was cold. One beer was wrong?! We are done with Chili's in Riverton!! I would rate it no stars!
