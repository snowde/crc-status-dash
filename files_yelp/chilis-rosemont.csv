Yakin Sal M.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",86,47,326,5.0,8/5/2017,"It was my first time at a chillis restaurant. Yes it's hard to believe since they have been around for quite some time. The truth is that I always try to stay away from chain restaurants. Only because they are over priced and their food and drinks tend to not be good. I has the house margarita and yes it was sweeter than cracking open a lemonade. But we got the dinner for two for $35. I was there with my roommate. We each had a margarita and shared an appetizer. The Texas cheese fries, they were good. Came with melted cheese and bacon topped with jalapeños accompanied with ranch dressing. Very tasty I'd say. I had the chicken fajitas, I think it could've used a bit more chicken rather than a mountain of veggies but the season was on point. So no complaining there. He had the half a slab of ribs. He said they were juicy and the flavor was also on point. Finally we shared the Oreo molten cake for dessert. If you love chocolate like I do that's the way to go. Nice warm cake topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce and crushed Oreo cookies. All in all it was good dinner for two for $35.  P.s. Yelpers be sure to give them a try and select their special. It really makes a difference if you are on a budget."

Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",2092,245,728,3.0,9/22/2017,"This Chili's is pretty decent compared to chain wide standards.  They seem to be making a solid effort to stay relevant by adding craft beers, more trendy food items and remodeling their restaurants.  This location got the makeover sometime in the last few year so it is looking new and hip - in a corporate way.  The seats are comfortable and the place is spacious, yet not too loud.  We have always had great servers and they keep drink refills coming.  Be sure to place an order for your favorite Coke concoction on the freestyle machine. The food is what you would expect for a fast causal restaurant.  They have a huge selection of apps, but we always opt for the bottomless tortilla chips.  The chips are freshly fried and come with a zesty salsa.  You can get refills of the basket of chips (don't be embarrassed, people do it all the time).   I rarely am hungry by the time my food comes out.  Salads and burgers are both pretty reliable, but terrible for you.  The health stats they publish online are a little concerning to say the least.  I had the Chipotle Chicken and Waffles on my last visit and feel it missed the mark.  The chicken was tiny little stringy pieces with a lot of batter.  The waffle was super sweet in an overkill manner.  It was all covered with a spicy chipotle syrup that kind of covered everything up.  I ate two of them and got rid of the rest - good thing I filled up on the chips and salsa. I will stick to fajitas or burgers in the future."
Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194,4.0,6/18/2017,"So i came here hungry! Like really hungry. The food was tasty and it satisfied my pregnant appetite  the trio fajitas (double shrimp and chicken) was really good! My husband had sunrise burger-was tasty and met the expectations of a picky burger eater. My daughter had chicken quesadilla (her go to food) and she was happy with it since she finished it.  However, i do not understand why we waited so much time for our food to come out. We waited for 30min on a Sunday at 2pm. The place had a lot of empty tables therefore the kitchen couldn't have been busy.  ***Also, Chill's are taking out items off their menu but the printed menu doesn't mention that or it's not updated yet.***"
Raul T.,"Chicago, IL",40,58,,4.0,8/20/2017,"Chilis is fun for kids to seniors!  They make dinner fun and exciting!  I will walk you through my meal.  We ordered chips and queso for the table.  Oh my my my!  So many chips and a large bowl of spicy queso to dip em in.  There was also salsa, but come on...we had queso!  I loved it.  So much queso dip for the chips.   Then out came my meal!  Sizzling fajitas!  So succulent!  I want more now!  The are sizziling and everyone in the restaraunt looks at you and knows you are the balls.  You ordered the boss item on the menu.   Then, when you cannot even fathom more food you get a large molten chocolate cake.  When you cut into it chocolate oozes out like a real life volcano!  I saw a documentary on volcanoes the other week and they will likely be part of our planets demise."
Fora C.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,3,,2.0,9/23/2017,I can't believe Chili's only offers two soups now. What happened to the Southwest Chicken soup?? That's the only reason I went there.  Too much competition from people going to the Allstate Arena. I'll find somewhere else that has a better soup selection.
Eric E.,"Des Plaines, IL",10,235,11,4.0,7/18/2016,"Decent meal at our local Chili's! We went for a 2 for $20 meal, and enjoyed Chips & Salsa, Fajita and the grilled chicken salad. The prices was very good, the chips and salsa OK at best, but ample and predictable. If you like finessed chips and salsa, this is not the place to go. The fajitas were decent as well. Good flavor, hot and sizzling, and enough to take some for another meal! The chicken salad was also a good portion. The lime vinaigrette dressing was actually very tasty. Service was decent, if not great. Our server seemed a bit tentative and lacked enthusiasm, but he was there for our drink refills and was mostly prompt in checking we had what we wanted. Overall, a decent Chili's chain experience. Better than some, and a good meal in Rosemont."
Amy W.,"Harvard, IL",5,4,1,4.0,8/17/2017,"This visit was significantly better than the last, partially due to the fact that we were actually seated at one of the many empty tables (unlike  the last, when an entire empty section plus more meant '20 minute wait). Oscar was our server, and he was fast, friendly, and had our drinks on the table/refilled in no time flat.  Because of him, I will make sure we return at a later date, because he really did make this visit a great one."
Laura N.,"Georgetown, KY",1189,1004,4237,3.0,5/13/2015,"Mango-Chile Tilapia with rice and steamed veggies --- what an amazing healthy meal to order here at Chili's after having too many unhealthy options for days. Yummmmgasm. I salivate now just thinking about that meal.  And that meal is about the only thing I like about this Chili's. The service itself wasn't bad -- we were just crammed together (five of us) at a corner table meant for four with the nearby tables being wayyyyy too close. If anyone had to go to the bathroom, basically all of us had to stand up to make room for someone to leave the table. It was annoying. And yet... we were stuck here. Price is OK. You'll be fine if you do the two meals for $20 thing.... and order water. Unless you have money to spend, then by all means, order away and drink to your heart's content. Menu is pretty typical of chains like Chili's -- burgers, fish, steaks, fries, drinks, etc. etc.  Not really my first choice for dinner..... .... but that tilapia. Man. Mmmm....."
Axel F.,"Des Plaines, IL",7,9,,3.0,5/14/2017,"I work close to this Chili's and they do have really good food. I will say that their prices are a bit steep, for example added a side of Mac n cheese is a 3.50 surcharge? That seems a bit excessive. I might understand it if you were getting a large portion like an entire entree of it but paying that much for what is essentially a cup of noodles cheese and some seasoning is kind of ridiculous.  I don't actually eat in though I've always ordered food to go. Which is great when the restaurant is slow and they receive my order. I can walk right in, pay and leave. However on several occasions they never put in my order which is a big inconvenience as I eat on my lunch break. They've comped the meal before, given me coupons, and they were always apologetic don't get me wrong. That's all well and good but you still need to fix the problem. I was forgiving when it only happened on a rare occasion. But once it started happening a lot I was done. The whole point of ordering that way is that it's ready for someone when they go in. That's precisely why these to go services are so popular. Because we live in this time where people are in a hurry, they are interacting less, and they just want to get their greasy junk food (no offense) go home and watch some Netflix. It defeats the purpose when you have to sit there and wait for it.  Fix whatever issues you have with receiving to go orders and I'll change my review. The food and service is really good. I would love to eat there again if I could count on my food being ready."
Maria A.,"Schiller Park, IL",90,11,,2.0,7/18/2017,"I used to come here often with my sister, I haven't gone for a year and I decided to go with my boyfriend recently, food was not as good a before I was very disappointed, hopefully it was just a bad night I used to love this place"
Damon M.,"Chicago, IL",872,115,214,3.0,8/6/2016,"Chili's is a fun place for ALL ages. The service is usually very good when I come here. They have many choices for all appetites. From burgers to salads, seafood to burritos Chilis has what you want. This is a good place for a date night or if you want to bring the kids for a night out."
Dawn D.,"Lake Villa, IL",45,12,,1.0,10/10/2017,Never returning my mother and I decided to go to Chilis she loves ribs she ordered the ribs with Broccoli. Ribs were so tough and broccoli was raw. returned that and ordered the filet.  talk about from bad to worse...steak was tough and broccoli was rancid.  Waitress was non existent this was a total disappointment.
Teddy R.,"Chicago, IL",50,21,,5.0,2/19/2017,I can't say enough about the service we received from the server they call TJ! She gave more than A++ service. She should serve as a model for the entire company as to what the servers should be striving for. The food was awesome. I had the guacamole burger and would definitely order again!
Bing N.,"Chicago, IL",6,65,301,3.0,8/21/2016,Been eating Chilis by Skokie. Had good experience but this branch served us cold food. The only plate that was served warm is the steak. The  burger was served well done but then we were not asked. The wait for the food to come - over an hour. Place not crowded but took a while before our Oder was taken and took a while before the food came. A not so good day for Chilis at this branch.
Rick G.,"Chicago, IL",1,36,,2.0,8/5/2017,"Ordered two party platters of chicken wings to go. Place the order yesterday to pick up today at noon. It is now today at noon and they never put the order in. There is one table being served in the entire restaurant and lots of people standing around, but nobody can look at an order ticket from yesterday?"
Eric H.,"Chicago, IL",1,3,,5.0,11/25/2016,"This is hands down the best chilis we've ever visited!! Brad, the manager is an outstanding guy and made our visit beyond perfect! Been to a lot of chilis but this one is truly above the rest! Must go!"
Isamar Q.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Very disappointed my family & I went in today we were seated quickly and the hostess was nice but we sat at our assigned table and waited for our waiter who NEVER came 20 minutes later we asked the host, she had no idea where our server was or who was our server we saw her ask another employee who was taking care of the area we were sitting at and he also had no idea, my toddler was fussy and hungry so I got very annoyed and just told the host we were leaving! I can't believe it, they weren't that busy I saw servers wandering around some would see us just sitting there and didn't even bother to ask if we had been helped.. I will be calling the store manager. I was really looking forward to having dinner there today!"
James V.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,1.0,11/21/2016,"In from California, for the holidays brought a sandwich in because I'm a diabetic, and my other friend ordered off their menu, and was told I cannot eat my sandwich in the restaurant by the manager, Who looked odd with a hoop earring in his nose very unprofessional Chili's."
Karin B.,"Berwyn, IL",0,14,1,2.0,9/29/2016,Order here for the first time a buffalo sandwich to go. Unfortunately fries were cold and the buffalo sandwich  was soggy as if it was sitting there for a while. Lettuce was so soft and chicken has berely any buffalo in it. Very disappointed. I threw the sandwich away.
Nicole M.,"Montgomery, IL",0,21,7,5.0,12/24/2016,"We had dinner here last night and it was superb! My husband and I took out both of our parents for dinner before a show and we had just excellent service. I can't recall our server's name, but she was younger (short brown hair and glasses). Very sweet and patient. Food was awesome, but when service is great, it really makes the experience wonderful."
Davina R.,"Des Plaines, IL",21,7,,1.0,1/28/2017,"I had the worst service at the Chili's in Rosemont on Mannheim Rd this evening.  We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service was AWFUL!  We had Kiera (or was it Keisha?) as our server and she was terrible.  I don't know how she works as a waitress.  She took forever to tend to us.  When she finally did get our drink orders and bring them out, we waited for approximately 15 minutes before she came back to even that appetizer/food orders.  Then she disappeared for about another 15 minutes or so with the appetizers,  but didn't bring us any plates.  We asked for plates and that took forever to get.  We ended up asking another server for some.  Then our drinks were all empty and she was gone for so long that we were almost done with our appetizers before we even got drink refills.   Ridiculous!  Then when we finally got our food, the fajitas I ordered were a joke!  They used to be generous with the serving and the meat.  You get a significant amount less than you used to, then to top it off literally about 50%-60% of my fajitas were onions.  I'm all for onions in my fajitas, but if I order steak and shrimp fajitas, I don't expect to only receive about 6 small slivers of beef and about 7 mini shrimp with less than a 1/4 of a bell pepper with a plethora of onions.  Talk about being screwed over.  That was  $14.99 and I didn't even this it was worth even half of that price. Between the awful service and the skimpy over priced meal, I have no intention to return there.  They have definitely lost a customer."
Cara L.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,27,1.0,7/5/2017,"One of my worst restaurant experiences ever! We used to go to this place once in a while for a weeknight meal and some drinks.  Not a special occasion place for me, but good comfort food. This was definitely my last visit. We came on a Thursday (about a month ago). Despite the half empty place, there was still a handful of people waiting for a table. Strange. Plus the whole place looked somewhat in disarray and disorganized. We were seated  10 min later and I ordered a Margarita (which was to be a special that day) only to learn that the promotion ended at 7:00 PM although nowhere in my e-mail or even the flier on the table was this mentioned (and we were seated at 7.15). When I confronted the manager about it (Jose, I think, was his name), he was very rude and condescending and pretty much told me in a rather hostile way that I was wrong! What happened to the ""customer is always right"" policy, especially when customer is right! (and believe me, I usually like my food and I'm not a complainer). If it wasn't for the fact that I have already ordered my drink and my husband and I were both starving, we would have left and never looked back. We decided instead to make it our last visit at this place (at least as long as Jose is managing it) and just make the best of it. On the positive note: our waitress was nice and polite and somewhat embarrassed by this whole ordeal, so she deserves the one star which I had to give out, anyway. Never coming back!"
Courtney Z.,"Niles, IL",82,5,2,1.0,12/6/2015,The service her is slow we waited a while to be seated and the place was empty. Very unprofessional. With and empty restaurant they seat everyone on top of each other it would be nice to be a little spread out so that we aren't so close to other families if the option is available I understand we are in a public place and it could be busy at times and it's avoidable but at 3 in the afternoon when its empty I think they could give us some space even when asked. After ordering and receiving our food we spoke with our waitress only to find that this establishment does not provide heat resistant gloves  to them when they serve hot plates so they burn their hands. We're also told that one girl burned her ear and side of her face from a hot plate while carrying a tray that she was made to lift to a certain height.  On the bright side we liked our waitress our food was good and our drinks stayed full. However still only getting one star.
C H.,"Reidsville, NC",0,6,1,1.0,5/6/2017,"I'm working in the area for the next two months,and decided to stop by for a togo order. I went inside and waited for 5-7minutes and not one person acknowledged that I was waiting.I then stepped over to the bar and asked the bartender if I were in the correct area to order togo, and he stated yes I will send someone over. I went back and waited another 6-7 minutes still not one person acknowledged that I was waiting. I stepped back over to bar and asked if someone was on the way. The bartender said oh you haven't been serviced yet? I said no he then proceeds to look around as if he were looking for someone to help. I then told him I was leaving that's when he stated well I can take your order ummmmmm why didn't you do that the first time?!? I left and called the manager to notify him of my experience to which he apologized and thanked me for letting him know. Poor customer service, and I'm working here with a big group of coworkers I'll let them know to not go here for our weekly dinner."
Kelley S.,"Chicago, IL",75,463,104,3.0,12/14/2014,"Chili's is a chili's is a chili's... and this one really is no different.  I guess that's the ""beauty"" of a chain, but it's also the beast of a chain.   I've been here twice.  Once on veteran's day when they are one of only a handful that offer military a free meal.   We came for the free meal and also received free chips too so that was great.  The meal was alright, that's it and I guess that's all I hope for in places like this. The second time we came our experience was about the same...  reliable but just alright.  We will probably be back at some point, but I honestly would rather try something new and chance having to log-on and leave a bad review than to go to a place like this and be guaranteed I will be leaving a mediocre one."
Daniel C.,"Orlando, FL",158,362,54,5.0,7/31/2014,"I love you chili's.  I had a quick trip to the airport to drop a friend off.  She and i decided to pop into chili's for the delicious triple dipper.  We had a great server who understood that we wanted to be quick.  She was personable, quick and funny.  I wish I had gotten her name.  Chili's has a table side computer tablet style product where you can pay your bill, get a receipt, request the server to come to the table and play games.  It's 2 miles from the airport so if you're on your way there you can always stop by and get a quick bite to eat.    I recommend the triple dippers! 3 of your favorite appetizers.  The server who was great recommends them too."
Jim S.,"Chicago, IL",0,89,10,5.0,3/11/2017,Had dinner there again tonight just as good as prior meals. Great staff great food. Very busy due to a concert at Allstate Arena but not a wait that was outrageous.
Gage N.,"Des Plaines, IL",2,25,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"This place is officially the worst restaurant I have ever had to deal with in my life. My personal experience but I have to say it a second time, the worst restaurant I have ever dealt with in my entire life. From when I was born until now. I can think of a few memorable incidents I've had at other restaurants and this place blew all of those out of the water.  The main issue is the service. It's beyond horrible. It's horrendous and despicable. The employees here are the most incompetent bunch of people I have ever seen. I'm not sure if incompetency is contagious here or if it's simply a requirement to get a job, but to put it in a very nice way (for their benefit) if you order 3 things, they'll forget one of them completely and the other two will surely be wrong. Not even remotely close to what you ordered.  I challenge anyone reading this to test this out for themselves.  I have been in here several times and have been so disgusted with the staff I have vowed to never step foot into any Chili's ever again! As an example, the last time I was here, I ordered a burger for take out, I came in to pick it up and after being ignored for a whopping 20 minutes despite the fact the restaurant wasn't busy at all, I only saw one table of 4 people and it was during the week around 4pm in the afternoon, anyway, there was an employee at the pick up counter not even five feet away from me who completely ignored me for ten minutes before walking away like I wasn't there, when she clearly saw me but just didn't care I guess. Didn't see her again, at least not until 3-4 other employees all saw me waiting and no one came over to even ask if I was being helped, I didn't see anyone doing their job. My blood was boiling and I was raging at this point and just wanted to leave. Finally that girl comes back, no apology for making me wait, just demands my phone number and name. I see someone from the back hand her a styrofoam box (presumably my food). I saw her opened it (I thought to make sure it's actually my order) but was too far away to see the food myself, she proceeds to bag it for me and hands it to me and I left, telling myself I will never return here.  So I get home, open the styrofoam box and am greeted with the most vile and disrespectful meal I have ever been served. My burger had no buns, no lettuce, no cheese, no anything. It was just a patty with what looked like a bite was taken out of it? Maybe not, maybe it was just a piece that was broken off and a tomato, but definitely not the definition of a burger.  I was fuming!  I drove back for an explaination and was greeted with hostility even from the manager who was called after I wanted a refund. They refused to give me a refund because according (to the manager at the time) I had left the restaurant so it's not their problem. In the end he ""offered"" to fix my order and give me coupons for future visits and I basically told him to shove his coupons where the sun doesn't shine and he finally gave me my money back. NEVER again."
jean h.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,115,2,1.0,6/13/2015,Meh - We ordered on line. I had the Smoked Chicken Quesadillas.  I paid for but did not receive the side a guacamole or sour cream. It was supposed to have caramelized onions. Funny I found almost raw purple onions on it - like they pulled it off of a salad. One triangle wedge had nothing in it    no chicken and no cheese.  The beans tasted like they were from the dollar store and the rice from the trash bin out back. Salsa was so cold it had to have been in the fridge. Chips had no salt. I will not return.
Patrycja K.,"Morton Grove, IL",9,19,,2.0,4/1/2016,"I'm not sure if all the locations are like this, but the food here was not good! This was my first time coming here. No hostess, the menu is at the table. I had a dish with chicken, fries, and corn. My boyfriend had a steak that was too thick to cook to a medium-rare. The only thing that tasted good here was the chips and salsa and my chicken. The fries were not fresh and the corn you can tell had been sitting. Service was good. When you are finished, you pay everything on a tablet that is already on the table. I definitely won't be coming back!"
Steve H.,"Orlando, FL",6,195,42,2.0,11/10/2016,ok chilis there is no feedback at yelp so my info is  . your food sucked
Judy C.,"Niles, IL",0,6,,1.0,1/17/2017,"I received a gift card for Chili's.   It's been a long time since I've eaten here.  The restaurant  was half empty but the hostess had several groups waiting to be seated.   Apparently she needed to see which tables actually had wait staff working them.  REALLY!?!  Experience doesn't  get better.  Music was really loud, way too many noisy, screaming kids nearby.   It didn't take too long to get food.  Unfortunately, food was served lukewarm.   Much better restaurants in the area.  I think I will throw out future gift cards."
Emilia M.,"Chicago, IL",73,49,2,2.0,3/8/2016,I love Chilis but this location is not the best. Though our food was good as always nothing is less unprofessional than 2 employees bickering at each out while you are out to dinner with your husband. The place needs better management that's for sure. Probably won't be back!
Tiffany E.,"Morton Grove, IL",1,3,,5.0,5/24/2016,Overly happy to see they still have the Santa Fe chicken salad after it disappeared from the Village Crossings menu.
Isabella K.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,,3.0,1/23/2015,"I used to love coming to this location. It wasn't too far of a drive from where I live and there is always parking. Unless there is something going on at the Allstate Arena, then that alters the parking and getting out situation a bit.  My last visit, I was there with my significant other, and while we were seated rather quickly, the service- rather a lack there of- was disappointing. We were seated and promptly given out utensils rolled in napkins, and told our server would be with us shortly. From that second, up until we left, we had maybe 6 different servers pass by us, and glance at our direction- but not approach us to see if we were being taken care of.  I get it, they have a policy that if utensils are placed, the table is being served, but when we did not even have our drinks and we were watching the waiters go by, note to those waiters, take a hint that something is not right. Who knows, your tip may just be bigger because of that- and if you become our server. (I speak from experience, I have been a waitress before and I know what it means to earn that tip).  Needless to say, when we stood up to leave, we approached and asked for a manager to notify why we were leaving. At that moment not only did the I believe GM offer to keep us there and provide our food, but another manager offered as well. We turned them down, because we did not need to be served in pity.  That location will not be visited by my and my friends for a long time, I am still disappointed to this day about that location- and Chili's is my favorite place to go to."
D M.,"Riverview, FL",4,39,195,2.0,3/17/2015,Worst chilis I've ever been to. They actually charge for chips and salsa in bar. The only one I've ever been to that charges. The bar tender was horrible. I had to tell him to charge me for my food. Also no 2 for 1. What chilis does that happen??  No napkins and not attentive at all. Don't live here so I'll never be back.  Sure they don't care!!!
Vendetta B.,"Chicago, IL",1,69,7,4.0,3/25/2016,Came in for lunch for 1st time and took a seat at the bar. Had boneless wings and tap modelo. Great combo. Friendly bartender girl and helpful suggestions. Loved it!!! I will come back. Great ambience.
Bobby O.,"Chicago, IL",312,257,187,4.0,11/30/2014,As a first timer I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant does have a partitioned bar area where one can watch sports and chow down. The families head to the other area where the booths are spacious and the staff was great. I ordered the chili and salad. Both were tasty and I was surprised to be told that my chili bowl was all you could eat. Nice although I only had a 2nd helping. Not bad for a chain restaurant.
Julie O.,"Orland Park, IL",215,717,936,3.0,7/23/2013,"Chili's. Basic food, familiar menu, nothing too over the top. I do not come here often, but when I do, it is probably for lunch. Service is normally good. Drinks are always refilled, check arrives in a reasonable time. I like the salads. They are tasty and the veg ingredients are always fresh. Probably too much fat and calories in the dressing, but they taste good.  Free parking in lot."
