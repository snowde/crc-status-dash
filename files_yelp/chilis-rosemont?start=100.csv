Chris C.,"Orange County, CA",35,583,1,3.0,11/8/2008,"Go this this place often for lunch and felt compelled to write a review this time because the service was actually good!  The food is same ole same ole, I actually prefer Friday's but our waitress was excellent. despite the lunch rush.  Hope to get her again next time."
Donna L.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,1,1,5.0,1/14/2011,I've always loved coming to chilis. The service is always fast and prompt- the employees make you feel right at home- and the atmoshere makes you feel right at home. I also enjoyed the new game system and credit card machine at the table. I wish ALL resturants could take some pointers from Chilis!
