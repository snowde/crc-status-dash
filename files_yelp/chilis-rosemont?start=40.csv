J J.,"Des Plaines, IL",2,17,1,5.0,2/13/2016,"Went to chillis after tgif wouldn't seat my party of 12 together. Chilis accommodated us very well, we called ahead and a table was waiting when we arrived. We had 6 kids with us ranging from 5yrs to 11 months old. The waitress was patient and friendly. Kids menu had some variety and was nicely priced. The pay touch screen consoles at each table have built in game apps which was a nice tool to keep kids occupied. It would have been even better if games were free. I think all access pass was 1.99. Will def go back."
Ashley R.,"Dallas, TX",20,124,174,3.0,1/14/2015,Really nice service. . Decent food as always. I ordered a margarita and the glass was extremely sticky.  The table had some sort of beans stuck to it that i couldn't get off.  Food came out but had sides mixed between me and my friends plate. We swapped them using our hands.  The spoon i got for my Mac and cheese had someone elses food stuck to it. Left a review on the cleanliness on their table kiosk. Hope they got the message.
Marcin S.,"Antioch, IL",33,18,31,4.0,10/11/2014,Seemed like a pretty standard Chili's. The service could use a little standardization and renewing. Waitresses all seemed to move a little slow and be just...
Sunshine M.,"Chicago, IL",5,55,2,1.0,6/8/2015,"It actually saddens me to write this, but this location has gone WAY downhill.  It used to be top notch and generous portions every time.  To start, the waitress seemed annoyed that we were there.  Now the food: the buffalo chicken sandwich was so over cooked it was nearly burnt.  The appetizer was such a small portion for so much money.  And my husbands chicken tenders were ""off"" as well.  I used to love going here.  Maybe it was just a bad day in the kitchen, but my husband swears we will never go back.  Below average food for way above average prices = no way!"
Debbie S.,"Mundelein, IL",0,39,,1.0,5/18/2016,"I wish I could base my review on actual food but I'm writing this review due to my extreme disappointment that I can't get a reservation for Saturday night due to the event at the Allstate Arena. Ummm. Hello!  That's exactly why I'm looking to make a reservation. We will have 12 people eating dinner. The manager also said they won't even take call aheads. So basically, it will be a free-for-all. Yeah. That's a lot better than taking reservations.  No problem. I just made reservations somewhere else. However, after reading all the other reviews for this place, it's probably a good thing we are going somewhere else."
Ashkey A.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,24,4.0,8/16/2014,The restaurant staff are always attentive to the customers. They prepare the best margaritas that I have tasted from various other chili's restaurants. This establishment is always busy but they get everyone a table soon. I have never waited no more then twenty minutes.
Jeremy H.,"Des Plaines, IL",9,3,,1.0,7/10/2015,"Placed an online order for a 5:30 pickup to arrive and find out they didn't start the order. 3 times in a row, time to move on. Pickup service is the worse."
Todd L.,"Elgin, IL",26,70,44,3.0,12/15/2014,Service was great. We ordered the onion rings they were delicious best onion rings I've ever had. We also had the guacamole and chips it to was good. Our entrées were shrimp salad for my wife the Buffalo chicken sandwich for myself and a turkey burger for my daughter. My chicken sandwich to seemed a little dry but I didn't have any complaints from anyone else. Our bill with tip totaled  $73
Phil M.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,7/21/2016,"Really bad fajitas.  The onions & peppers were barely cooked, plus i got some onion skins and ends mixed in there, too, because they werent peeled properly.  They give you toppings on the side...cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and tomatoes.  You LITERALLY get about 1 tablespoon of each.  Lol.  Plus they came with only 3 tortillas.  Talk about a stingy restaurant.  Oh yeah...its a tex-mex kinda restaurant, but they only have pickled jalapenos.  No fresh ones.  The server was fine and the atsmophere was fine, too.  It would be a cool place to come to if you didnt have to eat the food.  ;)"
Beata B.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",2,12,,2.0,7/2/2015,"We were coming to this chili's for as long as I remember but we were there today and what a surprise the whole restaurant is remodeled inside I didn't like it at all it use to be so comfy and warm before now is modern and cold who had an idea to change it, the mirrors on the walls ugly some times old is good. The food was ok nothing special it use to be much better I don't know what happened but I think we won't stop there any more."
Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29,4.0,7/30/2014,"This place may not seem all that special, but I recommend Chili's for a great dinner for several different reasons. 1) Please do not underestimate the ability of Chili's to produce an amazing burger! They really are great. The one to really try is the southern smokehouse burger. It comes with their ancho-chili bbq sauce, onion strings, smoked cheddar, and maple bacon. Cooked to order and it is so delicious!  2) They have other very delicious food, especially the guacamole. You can order it to be prepared right at your table. Although i personally haven't tried the sizzling fajitas, they also look great, (brought to your table still sizzling in the cast iron pan) and the chicken  sandwich is really good. MY ADVICE TO SAVE MONEY! : **This place is definitely not all that cheap for a chain restaurant, so if you go in, make sure to bring with you a coupon (either printed or on your phone screen) for a free appetizer of chips and salsa or chips and queso dip that you get just by signing up on their website (takes five seconds). This makes your experience a little more worthwhile because you at least get some yummy food to munch on while you wait, and the chips and salsa are bottomless. **If you go with a friend, order from the two for twenty menu (you each get an entrée and share an appetizer). Even though it only offers the maple bacon burger, my solution to this has been to simply ask for a side of bbq sauce and order the onion strings and  jalapeño appetizer (delicious and comes with an amazing dipping sauce), save a few strings and jalapeños for the entree, and put them on the burger! Voila! You have just ordered the same burger for less money because you also got the appetizer, lol **You can also substitute sweet potato fries for the regular fries for something like a dollar or fifty cents. They are amazing! **You get a free molten cake on your birthday. You don't know gluttonous heaven until you eat this beast. *Really, make sure to sign up for their mailing list on their site. They send so many good deals, like free appetizers, desserts, and kids meals. You can't go wrong!"
Russ M.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,2,,1.0,9/27/2015,"They were out of the corn bread,  two soups,  and ironically,  the chili. Disappoining for 7pm on a Sunday. The waitress was very apologetic and elected to bring the manager.  The manager spoke to us about it but it was obvious he really didn't care.  We left, we'll go somewhere else."
Jackie G.,"Tacoma, WA",303,607,1918,3.0,5/25/2012,"What do you expect from Chili's?  It was just so so. Sat at bar with coworkers the last night in town.  Server was relatively stressed and seemed to need a break.  My service was slow but had it not been for my coworkers to keep me distracted, I would have walked out.  I ordered a 6 oz steak and 1/2 rack rib dinner.  It was tasty so I'll give them the 3 stars for the freshness of the food. Even the broccoli was cooked properly.   You know what you get when you eat an establishment like this so I can say it's safe bet when you don't know about other eateries.  Price is as you would expect and competes with Applebees. I might hit another Chili's in the future depending on where I travel and what's nearby."
Stephanie K.,"Chicago, IL",34,7,,1.0,9/7/2014,"I went to this chilis and everything would have been great I'm sure but I didn't stay to be seated. I was so offended by the manger Billy!  It was a busy Saturday night and when my friend asked the host about the wait time he laughed at her. We went and sat at an open table in the bar and Billy came over and kicked is out! We told him about the host and his reply was ""that didn't happen""! He was standing there. Which he was not!  Then while we waited for a table He actually made fun of me to the host not realizing I could hear him! I work in high end customer service, this kind of attitude is totally unacceptable offensive. He should be replaced!"
Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392,2.0,2/5/2012,"So this night had been a plan in the making for over a month.  I was all excited about it and naturally because of that, was greatly disappointed.  Here's why.   We were going to a wolves game with a group of people and a few of us decided to meet at Chili's to grab something to eat before the game which started at 7.  Last year, we came and ate after the game and had such a good time we decided to repeat history.   I'd never really been much into Chili's but I got a gift card from a coworker for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised by the one in North Riverside (see that review for the GOODness) and was thrilled to go back so I could enjoy 1) Diet Dr Pepper from the fountain (we don't keep soda at home anymore and any time I can enjoy it is a huge deal) and 2) savor their delicious grilled veggie tacos.   Now I don't know if Chili's has changed that much in a short time since I was there with my holiday gift card (and once since then) or if the one in Rosemont just sucks way more BUT... This one did NOT have the extensive fountain drink selection that the one in North Riverside has/had.  You could get any combination of beverage imaginable.  Peach flavored Sprite among many other choices!  So right off the bat, I was saddened that I was not going to get my Diet Dr. Pepper.  The grilled veggie tacos had also been removed from the menu.  Shit.  I'm a vegetarian so I ended up having to eat a house salad.  No French dressing.  No Italian dressing.  They did have a citrus vinaigrette (sp?) which was good.  It just really stink to go out to eat and have like ONE option.  I love salad, but it'd be nice if that wasn't my ONLY choice.  And I had been craving those damn tacos for weeks!   Now, for the other less than stellar aspect which in part, was not the fault of Chili's.  Our party of 6 arrived at 5:15pm and the Wolves game started at 7.  I figured we'd be cutting it close and expected it to be quite crowded.  So we get our pager at 5:15 and were told it would be a 30 to 45 minute wait.  Cool.  Right at 6:00 (45 minutes later) our pager still had not gone off.  My affable Italian coworker (god bless him) approached the host stand in his usually charming way to ask if our table would be ready soon.  Mind you, they knew we were a party of 6 and had waited the maximum wait time they had given us.  They offered to spit us up between 2 booths, 3 at each and the booths weren't even close to each other!  Initially we said fine, since we were hungry and had to get to the game.   As we walked back to the booths, we noticed a HUUUUUUUGE group of people who were seated at tables pushed together that ran almost the entire length of one side of the place!  They had begun standing up and had their coats on so we asked if we could wait and sit at one of the longer tables they'd been occupying so all 6 of us could socialize, as was our plan the entire time.   Apparently these people had been there since 4:30 and it was now 6:15.  This was actually pretty funny because we were standing there awkwardly, staring at them (as if that was going to make them move faster) watching these old women look through a photo album and take forever to say goodbye to each other.   FINALLY enough of them moved so that one longer table could be turned back around and we sat elbow to elbow.    The dear manager brought us out complimentary chips with queso and salsa which was very nice.  I'm a very easy going person and wasn't much bothered by the waiting/seating situation.  A couple of the people I was with, however, were quite annoyed.  I'm a very go with the flow person and felt kinda bad about their obvious displeasure.   My only disappointments (and I guess personally, they were pretty major because I was specifically looking forward to the things they did not have) were with not having the food and drink I had planned to order and then lack of another option besides the house salad.   I will stick with North Riverside from now on and hope that they NEVER take away the endless drink options and grilled veggie tacos.  =(   As for the food of my dining companions, they enjoyed theirs very much.  And we made it to the game right on time."
D'Arcy F.,"Oak Park, IL",21,24,,1.0,4/16/2013,"The Denny's of Tex-Mex, now with bottom shelf liquor! Terrible. Simply terrible. Reminiscent of a bad Vegas buffet, only pricier."
Fadi S.,"Chicago, IL",254,95,81,5.0,12/29/2014,"Great food great service. loved the staff, server knew her menu and place was busy but not too busy to still have a good time."
Paddu P.,"Park Ridge, IL",6,76,17,4.0,4/18/2015,"I loveeeeee this place! From the Nachos, burgers, fajitas to their scrumptious dessert menu this is about the only chain restaurant that gets it right! There's something for everyone here. This location gets super packed, but I've never had an issue with my meal or their staff. When I'm feelin like being a fatty... This is my go to."
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2453,3000,3.0,1/9/2009,"Stopped in for a quick bite before a movie at Muvico. Kudos to our waiter for getting our meal out quick enough. The food, was.. typical Chili's, nothing that really wowed any of us. 312's were on special in a 23 oz glass and we were seated as we walked in. Lively atmosphere, although the waitstaff could've paid more attention. Otherwise, it was another plain time at Chili's. Around us were mostly families and a ton of people on dates.  Don't you hate it when they seat couples at those tiny booth tables for two.  I dislike the short table space."
G P.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,11,,4.0,4/4/2015,Great food. Nice location. Okay service. We have visited this particular outlet number of times. Ambiance is good and food is just amazing. What else you need?
