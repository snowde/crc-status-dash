Mike O.,"Park Ridge, IL",177,690,437,4.0,11/1/2012,"I've been coming here for years and even had the impression I had written about the place, but apparently I did not. This is a very busy Chili's, always packed when there's something happening at Allstate Arena. Still, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner on a special occasion like a birthday or special treat for the kids on a job well done.  Best time to come is lunch on a Saturday or Sunday, as there is no wait usually and there's plenty of good tables or booths to choose from. While Chili's is a chain, at the same time it's got plenty of food choices for kids and grownups too. And the food is good too. They introduce new items and keep old faves I've come to love over the years. My #1 favorite is the jalapeno smokehouse burger, bringing a mix of spicy jalapenos and creamy ranch sauce on the burger, for a spicy-mellow combination. There are many other burger choices too, especially if you like bacon. My wife always goes with steak fajitas, and that fajita platter is big enough for 2, so we often bring tortillas and DIY fajita stuff home afterwards. For the kids, there's about a dozen choices available. Pizza is a frequent favorite, and Chili's pizza isn't bad for a thin crust, but by no means on a stellar level you'd get at Lou Malnati's or Gino's, but kids don't seem to care. Sides of corn on the cob, fries or fruit are available too. If you still got room for dessert and aren't at risk for cardiac problems, try the molten chocolate volcano at the end. It's big enough to split with 2-3 people unless you want to win the golden pig-snout trophy all for yourself. Once again, the texture and flavors of chocolate cake, hot fudge and melting vanilla ice cream make it a sensational choice."
Colleen C.,"Roselle, IL",0,9,,4.0,2/14/2016,Loved the new menu.  I had the prime rib mex bowl and it was delicious!  Our waitress Barb was great and funny.  Definitely eat here again.
J K.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,26,,1.0,8/24/2015,"Waitress... It took her 10 minutes to ask us if we want anything to drink. Another 10 minutes to bring coke. She didnt even come and ask if we need anything. We ordered food-another 30 or more minutes. FOOD was-HORRIBLE. My husband got fajita trio- seriously raw onions and pepper,not cooked,cold shrimps. I got salmon and shrimps with broccoli. Salmon dry. Shrimps-super overcooked,too spicy,chewy. Broccoli -I thought those were leftovers from somebody else plate.I got one bite of each-awful. Waitress finally came-I told her food is really bad. She came with manager. He apologized for us.Asked if we want anything else. After a long one hour I didnt want to spend more time in there."
Anna W.,"Chicago, IL",0,37,2,5.0,11/9/2014,"Love this chilis. Waaay better than the Skokie location. Food is fresher, staff is friendlier and never jam packed. I had too much Chilis in my life, but will come back when I'm craving again."
Paula H.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,10,20,4.0,10/13/2014,Great food and nice and fast service! I went there with couple friends. I ordered onion rings and fried pickles as appetizer and southwest pairings as dinner. The place was pretty crowded (Saturday evening) so we might have been waiting a little bit to long for dinner but appetizer was brought right away. Everyone enjoyed the meal and we would probably stop by there next time when we are around.
Rosanna L.,"Bensenville, IL",496,471,1551,2.0,7/25/2010,"Ordered a full slab of ribs with rice and beans on the side... you know Chili's song ""Chili's baby back ribs"" yeah nothing special at all about their ribs and barely any meat on it. However, I did like the $2.99 margaritas special = ) but that's about it."
Shia H.,"Chicago, IL",51,45,25,5.0,2/9/2011,"I LOVE this Chili's!  The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful. The hostess is always nice and the managers are always making sure to ask if everything is going well. Ordering the Skillet Queso is a MUST! Always tasty and plenty of chips to go around!  The Big Mouth Burger Bites are DELICIOUS! I've had them a couple of times and I love them every time.  Their desserts never ever fail either! They are always sweet enough to fill my sweet-tooth. Ribs are almost always finger-licking YUMMY! [a little less sauce on them might be better.] &&&& My FAVORITE new discovery I recently had a Chili's, they have flavored margaritas!!!!  RASPBERRY, STRAWBERRY and MANGO!  A raspberry/mango margarita is SO DELICIOUS; I may end up being a regular for them!"
Linda N.,"Des Plaines, IL",56,288,290,4.0,10/24/2012,"On a Friday night, we did the 2 for $20.  Got cheese sticks as our appetizer.  My entree, chicken tenders;  I love the breading on the tenders, not greasy and light texture.  I got mine with mash instead of fries as I happen to love their mashed. Very attentive server.   I'd go back.    Actually, we didnt know tenders were part of the 2/20 and our server kindly pointed out we could get that deal!  Kudos to his honesty when we could have ended up spending more $$ than necessary."
Rachel W.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,27,,5.0,9/18/2015,Everyone was awesome our order got messed up and they fixed it and were very apologetic and I had the rib eye burrito ommmmmmg so good it needs to stay
Martin M.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,1.0,2/10/2015,Rude staff. Our  server Oscar arrived before we had lifted a menu and told us that we needed to order now if we wanted food  as they where closing in 30 mins. I was then refused a beer as he could not understand a European driving license. I'm 27. Plenty of other options in the area avoid at all costs.
Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1,3.0,11/11/2012,"Having lived in cities for a number of years I've come to associate Chili's with the hot place to go on a Friday night... that is only if you live in the suburbs. And what on earth could be a bigger insult than being called a suburbanite..? Possibly terrorist, I'm not sure.  Anyway. I secretly love Chili's... Shhh just don't tell my fellow City-folk. Chili's has so much sodium in it but that's what makes it soooo good.  But on about this location... It gets very busy when there are events at the Allstate arena. A lot of peeps trying to grab a bite before/after their event. They have these little touch screens at each table now. It appears to be another way to generate revenue from kids (it charges for video games). The cool part about it is that you can pay on the machine without waiting for your water to drop a check. This is the first place I've ever seen that has this. I thought that was pretty neat.."
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,4.0,3/22/2012,I like Chilli's food and drinks since I used to pretty much be a regular here I've tried almost everything. Their serving staff needs to be revamped and their bartenders need to be a little more friendly. The location is pretty convenient and the store is relatively clean so I would recommend it to friends or take them here for a margarita or two :]
Necia V.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,13,,5.0,4/12/2015,Great place for kids! We came for an early Sunday dinner with 13 ppl (6 adults and 7 kids)  and were seated right away. They have these game stands at the table for the kids which they loved. (You can pay your bill on this stand too). They served the kids first and so fast which was wonderful. Food was great. And it was our friend's birthday which they sang and had a small cake. Def going back since it was so kid friendly with great food and service!
Kathy B.,"River Grove, IL",0,5,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Last time I visited Chili's I was very disappointed and I have to say half the table of six was also. I had the half slab of ribs and the were awful, they were like chewing on rawhide! I'm totally serious. My co-worker ordered something ( I can't remember what it was  but I do remember she sent it back!) I now wish I would have told them right away. Our table spent over 100.00 on the food. I will say, we had a young man who waited on us and he was great, mainly this is why I didn't say anything. It's too bad because Chili's had a good reputation but lately ""I don't know!"" I finally sat down to write this and I still  have the receipt but I have no clue what I did with it..."
Lou H.,"San Diego, CA",5,186,52,4.0,1/24/2012,"Alright Chili's are pretty much all the same. They are everywhere. That turned out to be a good thing on my latest trip to Chicago. My friend who was traveling with me is a huge 49ers fan and their playoff game against the Saints was starting just as we arrived at O'Hare.  Because we wanted to see the Chicago Wolves game at 7pm we were going to be in Rosemont anyway and there was a Chili's right across the parking lot from the Allstate Arena.  When the football game started we were seated in a booth in the bar and we ordered lunch, usual Chili's stuff. The food was fine but the service was excellent.  They didn't care that 1, we came in with bags straight from the airport and 2, we sat in there the entire game for 3.5 hours. Meanwhile the Wolves game was starting to attract a lot of pre-gamers and the place was packed. The staff never gave us the evil eye or anything. I really thought that at some point they'd ask us to leave because we hadn't ordered anything in over an hour and they totally could've used our booth for another party. I'm super glad they let us stay in there and continued to bring us free refill after free refill of soda because we got to see one of the most exciting NFL playoff endings in recent history."
B B.,"Leo, IN",0,1,,1.0,5/6/2015,Poor service.   After 10 minutes of not even a welcome once we were seated we got up and left.
You Kno W.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,,1.0,5/23/2011,"Loud. Extremely loud.  Do we REALLY need that many TV screens in a restaurant?   Service?  Marginal...we had to go in search of the waitress in order to pay the bill.  I will say, however, that the (male) manager was roamingly attentive and filled our glasses once. My salad was wilted and watery.  My companions' meals seemed better --- good chicken sandwich and unimpressive but not overdone salmon and broccoli.  Still, WHY put yourself through this when there are a dozen similarly priced restaurants with better food and atmosphere in the area?  At least, that's my take on things..."
Alex M.,"Chicago, IL",1,28,,4.0,11/18/2014,The three times I have been to Chili's at this location the food has been very good. I was quite surprised the first we went there. The good food and the prompt wait staff keeps my wife and I coming back. I highly recommend.
Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1524,2735,4.0,10/25/2008,"OK, so based on food alone I would completely have given this Chili's 5 stars. You wouldn't necessarily expect a chain to provide you with the best of meals, but I was thoroughly impressed. My strawberry lemonade was delicious with extra strawberry taste without being too sweet. The chicken was tender and moist, but not watery, nor undercooked and everything that came with it perfectly complimented the meal. The crunchy, spicy chips added texture. The beans were both pureed and whole. The rice was large and plump. I was blown away. Service wasn't too bad. That's what brought it down a star. We had to wait 20 min for a table, which isn't surprising. Once the crowd mostly left we were still ignored for a good portion of our outing. We waited a while after we were ready to order and even longer when we wanted the bill. I would still come here again in a heartbeat if I can be guaranteed the same delicious chicken."
Lisa B.,"Raleigh, NC",34,98,10,4.0,11/23/2010,"This is your standard Chili's.  The service is usually pretty good.  We've been here a few times when the service was pretty bad.  The place has always been clean and the hostess friendly. The drink specials are usually awesome and they don't taste watered down like some drink 'specials'.  We've had quite a few problems with the kitchen, but the servers were usually quick to correct them. My favorite thing to order is the unlimited chips and salsa.  The chips are always fresh and warm here.  I've always loved knowing that if nothing else, I'm going to get good chips. This location is doing a trial run on some electronic tablet at each table.  You can pay, you can order dessert and you can play games on it.  They also list specials.  It was kind of neat to try out and I'd like to see them roll it out to all locations. If you're near O'Hare and looking for a fast lunch, they have all you can eat soup, salad and chips.  I think it is about $7, so you can't beat that.  They also are pretty fast at lunch even when busy.   Overall, I like this place and I think for a chain they do pretty good."
