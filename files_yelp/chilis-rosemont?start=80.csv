Linda C.,"Mt Prospect, IL",94,43,95,3.0,11/24/2012,"Typical Chili's. Friendly staff, satisfactory food, clean... frequently visit here for lunch with co-workers during breaks. Quick service is definitely a pro for these occasions."
Susan R.,"Stone Park, IL",5,32,,4.0,2/6/2013,"The best thing about this restaurant is the huge selection of diet soda choices! Wow. A whole menu just for soda. They also have lots of deals so it's a good choice for week night dining or lunch. Some of the menu items are beyond fattening so be careful. However, they have low calorie items now that are really good. I tried the Mango Chili Chicken and was surprized how much food was there and how good it tasted for 580 calories! Chilis used to be a definite place to avoid for dieters but is now a really great choice! We had good service as well. Very attentive server."
Penguin S.,"Houston, TX",140,713,169,4.0,9/10/2010,"It's hard to write a review for a huge chain. They know what they are doing and don't really mess up much.  Having said that, I got the skillet queso and it appeared to be about 8 hours old sitting in a crock pot over cooking. Great, crispy chips, tho. Cheese fries are about as good as they come, and they know to bring ranch.  Southwest egg rolls are NOM! Buffalo chicken nuggets (sorry, I don't think there is such a thing as boneless wings) were good as well. Can't go wrong with fried cheese.  Love the chicken fajitas and that they serve them with cheese. It's amazing how well cheese can spice up a fajita. They don't make mojitos but are proud of the margaritas, altho, in my book, a rita should be served in a larger glass!"
Kati F.,"St. Charles, IL",31,4,,4.0,11/22/2010,"I started working near by recently and was over and still yet under whelmed by the selection of ""fast food"" in the area.  I love the fact I can order online from this location.  My favorite dish is the Margarita Grilled Chicken.  I usually swap out the sides for veggies and mashed potatoes.  Also beware if you add on nachos like I did and was unprepared for the large bag of chips and vat of salsa!! My order is always ready, and the staff is nice and friendly.  I have eaten inside only once and have never been unhappy with any of my experiences."
Dave S.,"Hickory Hills, IL",593,1203,15,2.0,2/10/2009,"If you have been to any Chii's then this place is going to be no different. I went here before a show at the Allstate Arena on a Monday night. The place was beyond busy. It was ridiculously busy, but our server did a decent job of taking care of us. She was kind of odd as it seemed like she was reading from a script or something, Maybe she was just brain dead from dealing with the swarms of Metallica fans that were invading the place that night. .  I ordered some chicken tacos and it seems like the entire meal was slightly overcooked. It was not inedible by any means but the tortillas were slightly hard and the chicken was starting to get a little dry. As for casual chains, this is a sweet location for them but I think that the next time I go to the Allstate Arena, I may look around the area for something else."
Bing O.,"Chicago, IL",36,116,212,1.0,10/13/2013,completely incompetent. ..   we eere seates for lunch service and waited 20 minutes for the wait staff...they never showed so we left...
Adrian W.,"Chicago, IL",100,361,5,1.0,3/8/2009,"Service is hit or miss. Today was no different. We got our hostess to seat us quickly, though no one to take our orders. When that waitress came around, 'what'ya have?' came out quickly.  I ordered the Sam Adams seasonal and a few more drinks were ordered. It came back in a warm/hottish mug with tepid beer. My salad was more salad than filling. With way more mint then anticipated. And corn relish when I asked for it to be removed.  I didn't complain because I didn't want to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes for it.  Plus, the main reason why I was here, for the Hawks game, was pretty bad, so we high tailed it outta there and grabbed a few at Excuses instead."
A G.,"Chicago, IL",3,46,,2.0,2/12/2012,Last few times I've been here the service has sucked pretty bad.  We've had the same guy the last 2 times we went & he was terrible both times. Never checked up on us. Had another guy check on us. Then at one point one of them said we will be working together.  I dont know it was all strange to me. But the food is great!
George B.,"Schaumburg, IL",40,334,3,3.0,8/27/2009,"This location is either a Hit or an Epic Miss. I have had some visits here where if I gave them 5 stars it would be an understated review.  some of the servers are excellent, and do their best for their customers. Other times, everything just sucks.  I have been served drinks with debris in them.  I have had many staff members ignore my table and never check on me.  Most recently, I had a server who never checked on my table, read off specials which weren't offered, and even messed up the special "" 3 courses for 2 people for $20"" deal Foodwise, this is standard Chili's fare.  Isn't crap, but isn't the best you can get either."
Cody J.,"Longmont, CO",1,27,,5.0,10/4/2009,"After a 16 hour drive from Charlotte (because of traffic, traffic, more traffic, and damn Chicago road construction) I was not in the mood to try to find somewhere ""local"" to eat - NO way was I getting back in my car to get food.  We were staying at the Residence Inn near the airport, and this was within walking distance.  We ordered curb-side pickup to bring back to the hotel. Called in - we could tell that it was very busy and loud, but when we arrived to pick up our food, everything was correct, utensils, napkins, etc.   Being in a piss-poor mood (just ask my girlfriend), I became at least bearable to be around after getting some food quickly, and exactly the way we ordered it."
Brent W.,"Chicago, IL",96,953,834,4.0,5/8/2008,"Chili's ""Big Mouth"" Burger.  It is something to behold and it's the prob the tastiest burger i've ever had from a chain restaurant (and one of the best at any place), period.  Fries are your average seasoned up french fry and pair well with the sandwiches.  I usually go w the Hickory burger with cheddar cheese,  bacon and bbq sauce, a lights out treat.   Other items worth a mention:  great Queso dip with tasty tortilla chips  and their Southwestern Vegetable soup, a bit spicy and oh so good."
Jesse W.,"Midlothian, IL",137,109,10,3.0,3/7/2008,"Chili's is my guilty pleasure: one of my favorite mid-scale fast food restaurant chains.  There are probably a dozen or so in the Chicagoland area, and I've been to a few around the nation, too.  I haven't had a bad experience yet, which is quite a compliment when compared to my other visits to TGI Friday's or Bennigan's.  Unfortunately, this was my worst experience yet. Tonight's meal was my first meal back in America after a 3 month stint in China.  Why Chili's?  1) It's one of my fav chains, as stated earlier.  2) It's mighty close to O'Hare.  3) It's open until 11 p.m. Mon.-Thurs. -- perfect for a 9:30 p.m. arrival.  4) Main reason: I wanted a decent hamburger from a quick, consistent, nearby stop. Our party sat down, and were given a few minutes to order.  We finally ordered a full round of waters, 4 other drinks, appetizers, food, and desserts.  Waters were only given to a select few.  Food was brought out within a decent time.  No utensils or plates were at our table, and none were offered with our appetizers.   All was not downhill though.  Chili's, with no assistance from our waitress, gave my palate a delightful tour of what a bacon burger should taste like. My Southern Smokehouse Bacon Big Mouth Burger arrived at my table, as advertised: ""Extra thick-cut brown sugar & chile-rubbed bacon topped with smoked cheddar cheese, crispy onion strings, mayo, shredded lettuce, tomato and pickle. Served with ancho-chile BBQ sauce on the side.""  Although I couldn't order my burger medium-rare, I was not that unhappy since this seems to be the industry norm among national chains.  Either I truly missed bacon by being in China for so long, or this was honestly some of the thickest, tastiest bacon to ever bestow itself upon my tongue.  I wanted extra ancho-chile BBQ sauce, but my waitress hardly seemed worried about how much I was enjoying my meal.  She seemed more interested in completing her closing duties so she could leave on time.  At least my friends and family also seemed to enjoy their food. I sampled the Molten Chocolate Cake, and Frosty Chocolate Shake.  Both were decent.  I was slightly disappointed, however, when one of my friends couldn't order a vanilla shake.  Only chocolate shakes here, fellas. Overall, service SUCKED at this location, but Chilis' new burger creations and reliable food will keep me coming back.  A better customer service experience could have easily placed my review of this location at 4 stars."
Janis W.,"Chicago, IL",7,177,4,2.0,12/30/2008,"We needed a place to eat on our way home from O'hare.  The nachos were pretty good, my friend said.  But my soup wasn't hot, so not hot that the frozen pieces of chicken in it were still half frozen. And they had run out of guacamole. There are $3 margaritas on Monday night, but there wasn't much (if any) alcohol in them and they were not tasty. There were long long waits for drinks and food, but our server was super nice and tried hard."
Tara M.,"Des Plaines, IL",91,355,7,4.0,3/9/2007,"I love this Chili's when you don't have to wait for a table! It's the busiest one there is but the service is always good when you get there.  As is the case with most Chili's the food is pretty darn good.  I like the fact that they all have the calorie count on their lighter fair stuff, along with the fat and fiber.   Always a good experience, again, provided you don't have to wait.  The waits can get pretty lengthy here too... if you're planning to eat here before a show/event at Allstate Arena, I really recommend getting there 2 hours before the event is due to start, just to make sure you can get a table and eat before."
Sir ..,"Denver, CO",42,224,40,5.0,12/26/2005,"Did someone say I want my baby back baby back baby back ..Chili's. I have to admit I'm a big Chili's fan. Every time I go to Chili's, the service and food is fantastic. I personally like taking guests to Chili's because the food is always great the price is reasonable and the service is on the ball. This Chili's site is a newer one, so it's really pristine compare to some of the older locations. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, perhaps a bit young sometimes, but always helpful. Good Food + Great Price + Hip Styling = A Great Dining Experience Pros: Ample Choices, Good quality, Reasonable Prices, Parking Cons: none Overall Rating: 4.5 of 5 Recommendation: Highly Recommended"
Beth A.,"Chicago, IL",81,393,6,1.0,2/26/2011,ive had two very unfortunate experiences at this location...i will never be back and neither will the ppl i ate out with on either occassion
Virginia T.,"Chicago, IL",110,351,5,5.0,11/12/2007,"I can hardly believe that I would be giving a Chili's a 5 star rating...but I stayed at the Wyndham right across the parking lot, so I went there for dinner on a Friday night and it was seriously the BEST Chili's I've ever been to! The place was packed, but the wait was only around 25 minutes... the waitress was great, attentive but not too much-the order was just right-and it was the closest thing I've ever gotten to a medium-rare burger at a Chili's (usually they are overdone and dry).  If you are in the area, I'd have to recommend it!"
Rahshonda K.,"Chicago, IL",192,640,54,4.0,11/7/2008,I am writing this update because my last experience was Ehh!!! due to the service however the waitress we had today KICKED ASS!!!! The food is always good no doubt but her 5 star service definitely made me want to change my mind about the three stars I gave them before
Melissa L.,"Woodridge, IL",0,49,3,3.0,1/1/2013,"Not horrible, but not really impressed either. I took my mother to the Harlem Globetrotters game as her Christmas present so we decided to grab some dinner first. We were sat nearly immediately in a booth. Our server greeted us extremely promptly. There was something kind of off about her, she was rather awkward like she was uncomfortable, I'm thinking she was new? I think she was foreign, her name was Karolina or something. Anyways the service was alright, not great but pretty good. She kept refilling my drink and my mother's margarita was fantastic. Here comes the trouble, our food took really long, I'm assuming it's because it was a Friday night but still 25 minutes for a medium steak and some pasta? When our food finally arrived the steak was past well done, like I am talking no pink in sight and rather dry and flavorless. The cajun chicken pasta was delicious though, I definitely recommend it. The manager offered to replace the steak but we had no time so he comped it off our bill. All in all not a great experience but the drinks were good and our server may have been a little weird but she was extremely nice and she didn't pull the disappearing act like so many servers do so three stars and I'm hopeful that next time I am in the area my experience will be better."
Michelle M.,"Park Ridge, IL",121,98,7,5.0,7/30/2007,"Went to Chili's on Sunday 07/29 to have lunch and watch Cubs game.  So we sat in the bar.  Have been to this Chili's a few times and always very nice, but wanted to review after going again.  Ok yes since pregnant and have been craving onion rings - yes we ordered the Awesome Blossom Onion thing.  Very huge.  We couldn't finish it but I tried to eat a little more than usual to satisfy my onion ring desire!  But there was one section where breading was not cooked enough.  Eh - still good overall.  My husband got a burger and I got the chicken caesar pita.  Very nicely filled with good amount of chicken.  Figured getting something semi-more-nutritious would balance out with the awesome blossom.  Oh and had Blackberry iced tea which is fantastic.  Overall very good.  Other times have had fajitas, other sandwiches - everything is always great."
