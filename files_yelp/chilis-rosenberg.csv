Jeffndonna M.,"Inwood, Houston, TX",16,65,11,3.0,12/28/2017,Food was ok for a chilis. Im sure alomst everyone has been to a Chilis but this one is not impressive. Waiter was reall cool which is why im giving three stars but everything else was blahhh.. 1) Slow night and no hostess. Sign was up to wait to be seated yet nobody around for 7 minutes. Almost left 2) Drinks took 10 minutes to get to us. Wife ordered a mix drink and I ordered a Martini which had no alcohol. Told the waiter to take it back because I was not impressed. 3) Food was ok but seemed bland.
Cat W.,"Katy, TX",66,155,166,1.0,10/29/2017,"If I could leave zero stars I absolutely would. The worst service I've ever had anywhere, ever.  Sat with empty drinks for 20 mins, watched our beers sit at the bar for 15 mins before I got the hostess to get them for us. Table never cleared, not checked on one single time. Literally. The only time we got anything is when one of us got up to get help.  After waiting 40 mins for our check ( one friend was paying cash) one of our friends asked for the manager and they flat out refused to go get him. What now? Then said the bad service was because our server had another table that was bigger. Ummm negative all this started long before you sat him a huge party.  Hostess brings our check and gets huffy when I tell her we are trying to split it. Then says "" only 2 of you drank 5 beers???"" Well yeah, not hard to do when you are in a Chilis for over TWO HOURS because you can't seem to get out of there. Also none of your business what your guests are drinking or how much, a beer an hour is completely normal.  I have never been so pissed off. Oh and to top it all off when my friend wanted to pay their check in cash NO ONE ever came back. He sees the manager and while having him cash him out he says what our experience was and the manager says "" he has a large table, sorry about that"" ARE YOU SERIOUS? If I hadn't been here I wouldn't believe it, no one gave any effs about us."
Cindy S.,"Houston, TX",0,29,,1.0,9/13/2017,"This was one of the most pathetic lunches I have ever had. My friend and I were catching up, so waiting an hour for our order we were chatting. But salad was terrible. The lettuce tasted like the smell of a sour refrigerator and the quesadea were cold and greasy. The waiter and waitress could not co ordinate anything. Took 15 minutes to get the bill. Just dreadful. Avoid the place if possible!"
Kristy S.,"Sugar Land, TX",79,398,754,2.0,4/14/2017,"I ordered to go. Food was cold. After reheating it, taste was it was fine. Service was good, no complaints. Place is always dead when I come by for dinner. We've dine it before and service was great."
Corinne F.,"Sugar Land, TX",26,296,217,5.0,8/11/2017,Excellent friendly and attentive service by our waiter Dennis. The food was pretty doggone tasty. But I also need to mention the rockin music. Quincy makes the best sweet tea in the state of Texas. The whole staff here is remarkable. This is a win win. We will be back.
Aisha M.,"Richmond, TX",105,124,129,4.0,6/28/2017,We came in today with about 50 children from camp and the staff handle our group very well. They did a good job of taking orders and the food came out right on time. We appreciate their hard work!!!!
Karina C.,"Pearland, TX",10,16,26,4.0,8/21/2017,"Chili's was good! We just went in for dessert! We always get the Chocolate Molten! The staff was okay, but the molten was delicious as usual!"
Parveen B.,"Houston, TX",0,4,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"Been here couple of times. Both for take out and dine in.  Dine service is spotty. Service can be better. Once waited an hour for food. The manager did come by to let us know there was an issue with our food. Which was odd since there was only two other tables, both (2 tops) came after us and was receiving food before us.  Food was hot and good tho.  Had take out here several time. Always a wait so your food just sit there and gets cold or they forgot an item. But today was the worst!!! I came in said I was there for pick up and then we go through the process of checking the food. I noticed how hard and dark my original chicken crispers were I then told the server that it didn't look right. The server however thought it was a good idea to basically say I am wrong and that's how they always looked and made a point to tell me they had just been cooked. No! They looked like chicken that had been sitting out and they wanted to refry them and pass them off as new ones. Waited another 3 minutes for fresh ones. They looked fine and I paid and went home. Only to find out the breading is undercooked and the other half of my food is overcooked. HORRIBLE!!!  Either they have a cook who doesn't know how to cook or they don't give a crap about customer satisfaction."
Jeremiah M.,"Rosenberg, TX",100,270,703,3.0,9/12/2017,"This place has good food and good variety, but what they lack is great service. Their greeting staff makes themselves scarce and when there aren't that many people in the restaurant, it still takes a while to be seated. The servers themselves are usually good, but a bit absent minded. It's hard to cast a wide net across them all because we have had great servers there, but overall it's not been outstanding."
Roman B.,"Rosenberg, TX",92,18,24,4.0,6/7/2017,"Chilis, like most other chains, is very hit or miss. I understand it's very much a ""bang for your buck"" type of place and due to lower food prices, you can typically expect a lower quality of service and possibly food. However, today I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both. After having to seat ourselves at the bar area due to there being no apparent host, my mother and I both ordered the 6 oz sirloin and two house salad options from the 2 for 20 menu. The steaks were cooked to our liking and aside from one of my sides coming out late, everything seemed okay. Our server/bartender was solid, taking into consideration how much ground he had to cover. An excellent option for two people looking to avoid cooking at home."
Izzy M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/17/2017,"We stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon, 2:30pm. Walked in to an unattended restaurant. No servers, hostess, or managers in sight! Customer looked pissed because they were holding menus and no one taking there orders. Get it together Chilis-Rosenberg!"
Maddy T.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,44,9,1.0,1/28/2017,"Firstly, I understand it's a chilis and not a 5 star restaurant and they have lately tried to lure in customers with a new revised menu and new decor so we came in.  Fairly slow and took about 30 minutes for food.  Ordered the sizzling fajitas with two steak orders for about 15 dollars. (Had to pay an extra 2 dollars for steak for each order) so almost 17 dollars. On top of that you have to pay 1.50 for rice and beans no longer included.  And what we received was not enough steak for one person.  The manager just implied we were wrong and that it has always been this way. Although maybe a year ago or two I know that me and my 2 friends could go and split the fajitas. The funny part was they included 6 tortillas like there was ANY way we could make 6 steak tacos from this.  Ordered the dessert and it's now almost 8 dollars for a cake. It seems like chili's has been raising prices without raising quality of food.  We feel extremely ripped off and for their new prices it seems insane. Not coming back."
Hannah E.,"Bellaire, Houston, TX",125,12,6,5.0,3/19/2017,Good food but most importantly our server Brooke was awesome! She was very sweet. We came in for my nieces fifth birthday (she wanted to play with the tablet they have at the tables) and she went all out for her birthday and made it very special. Thank you Brooke!
Alyksandr S.,"Houston, TX",58,32,82,1.0,5/8/2016,"I should've read the reviews before entering this location.  Before getting our table, we were speaking about how long it had been since the last time we ate at a Chili's. We were complementing the nice decor, food selection, and drink selection. We were so eager to try this restaurant again, but that all changed as we walked in.  As we entered the restaurant, the location was pretty much empty with exception of 3 tables that were fully occupied. First, It took approximately 10 minutes to sit us at a table. As we sat down, the friendly waitress took our drink orders and then brought us our drinks. She then took our food orders and basically disappeared. 45 minutes later she came to ask us if we needed some refills but at this time we were upset because no one had come to explain to us why our orders were taking so long. Before thinking about walking out, the waitress informed us that the manager was helping her serve our food to bring it to us. Finally, after an hour long wait (in an empty restaurant) our food was brought out. To make things worse, one of the orders was wrong and we just returned it.  I do not understand the service in this establishment and apparently we have not been the only ones who experienced this poor service. We were expecting the manager to come and apologize and check on us to see if everything was ok after we had been served, but NOPE. He didn't acknowledge the only table he had on that one section. No apologies for wrong order nor the long 1 hour wait. We will definitely not be returning to this establishment. Such a disappointment!"
Faisal I.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,2/19/2017,"I am a regular here because I love their chocolate cake. I have always ordered to go and tonight was my first time dining here. We were seated right away but when our server came to our table he did not even introduce himself. He was very rude, did not greet or smile and pretty much there the menu on the table and walked away. I ordered a salad and when it finally came I was not given silverware to eat with until asked for. I will probably keep coming here to pick up their cake but not dining here again. BAD AND RUDE SERVICE"
Cody W.,"Rosenberg, TX",71,23,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"I feel like you know what you're getting when you go to a Chili's.  Acceptable food and average service for a reasonable price are the drawing feature to this restaurant chain.  This particular location, unfortunately, fails to meet the very attainable standard set by Chili's restaurants. We have come to this location on a few different occasions for a small late night bite to eat and a drink or two.  The service is always questionable and the food and drink is never great, but it serves the purpose for which we are looking.  What I would normally rate as a two or three star establishment dropped to a rare one star rated location yesterday. We walked in to try lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated quickly, but that's where the service stopped. We sat there for almost fifteen minutes and no one even came to acknowledge us. There was no drink order, no waters, or even a hello.  More than three different servers and staff members made eye contact with us as we patiently waited, but nothing.  Finally, in awe, we smiled, laughed it off, and stood up from our booth to walk out. On our way out the woman who had originally shown us to our seat glanced our way as we walked by and then continued to go about her business.  We are never rude, regardless of the situation, and we were not this time either, but we did have to leave and walk to the McAllisters next door."
Priscilla G.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,6,1,1.0,12/26/2016,Horrible hostess  was excited to eat out with family but as we went in the hostess  immediately showed her overwhelming attitude.  She smacked her lips ND rolled her eyes  while working. We sat down waiting  to be asked our drinks no one came and we decided to leave. Never again. I struggled to get my husbands  wheelchair off to eat there  just to see the attitude  to turn bk and leave.
Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",73,247,131,2.0,12/1/2015,"I came here at 1:30 on a Tuesday. For a light lunch. I do not know my waitress's name, she never said. If she come back I'll ask. I was seated in a corner of one section, 4 feet from another couple and near a table of 5. The dining room cleared out by 1:40 and the other people near me had their food. My drink came at 1:46, although I'm not sure why it took so long.  No sign of the waitress as I type this.  My food came out at 1:56, almost 30 minutes after I ordered. My salmon was hot, the shrimp and potatoes were hot, and the broccoli was more raw than steamed but I'm good with that, usually. I'm very pleased the food was good. I was frustrated that the waitress was not more attentive. That's too bad. I'm afraid this review is more along the lines of the others I have read. The food was good, the service was not. The restaurant was clean, I watched the hostess clean several tables during my visit."
F A.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,11,2,1.0,4/15/2017,Worst location ever. I would just drive further out and go to the one near Williams trace location. The manager at this location is unqualified to be in the position. All staff here are kids that can careless about customer service. One waiter smelled so bad it was gross to be served food from him. We just walked out and left. The place has barely any customers yet they take over 30min to get the food out. They should just shutdown this location.
Tom H.,"Richmond, TX",22,72,3,1.0,5/30/2016,"Chili's needs to stop. Stop changing your menu every couple of months and stop Hiring people who are either incompetent at best or those who hate their job.  Im not expecting butt kissing or cartwheels but damn you could feel the bad attitude coming off this bartender.  No follow up service, no asking how everything was. No thanks I learned my lesson. Not to mention the wings got there cold"
M. L.,"Houston, TX",0,23,26,3.0,9/19/2016,Been Chilis customer for a long time; this by far the worst experience. Waitress was nice but service was subpar - no napkins then took forever to get some and I had to the take out area to request them for my table; forgot avocado on nachos and very limited sour cream. Just not good ..
Amber S.,"Richmond, TX",37,19,,1.0,8/25/2015,"Have had really poor service on more than one occasion, but tonight topped it all.  We ordered our food and waited for more than 40 minutes. Mind you we ordered a salad, a burger, a kids pizza, and a kids corn dog.  At this point, we asked the waitress to check on the food, 10 minutes later after not getting an update we informed them we were ready to leave.  The manager comes over and informs us that our food order was just put in 10 minutes ago.  Are you kidding me??? Won't be back...atleast not to this location. Forgot to mention that we also had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant because we were told there were only 2 servers and the one we would be getting was in the back making something..."
Jon R.,"Bay City, TX",32,52,13,1.0,6/28/2015,"The only reason this is one star is because I can't have a lower rating. The service was horrible. The waitress was more busy talking to other customers to even take our drink order to begin with. While waiting on another beer, the bartender was walking around and chatting with other customers while I waited more than 10 minutes for a beer. The bar had 8 people total in it, they weren't busy.  The food was decent, but the service made me more than willing to never return. What a bad experience."
Jerry R.,"Richmond, TX",0,7,,3.0,8/13/2016,It's been many years since I had been to Chili's so I decided to stop by with my cousin for an appetizer and a drink. The guy who took our order was polite and all and got us our drinks pretty quick. Now the appetizer on the other hand took forever! Went to the men's room and it was filthy. A roll of toilet paper was unrolled on the floor and as I was going back to my seat I was looking about and seen paper napkins on the floor and two waitresses just standing around talking. Never again will I be going back! Update:  Since my visit I was contacted by Chili's and they assured me that they would address my issues regarding my last visit so I reluctantly went back about a month later and yes my experience there was much better. But I will only give them a three star rating even though they corrected the issues and hopefully it will stay that way.
Tracy S.,"Rosenberg, TX",52,54,4,4.0,5/2/2016,We were sat super fast. Service was good and the food was great as always. Server didn't try to sell any drinks for happy hour even though we were sat in the bar area. Presidente Margaritas were only $5 and had we known that from the beginning of our meal we would have ordered more than one. Everything appeared to be clean. Food came out quick and it was delicious. Can't usually go wrong with Chili's! :)
Bob O.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,63,,5.0,1/6/2017,Always stellar service! Always good food. Occasionally slow because they're understaffed but that is not the service staffs fault. Tip the service staff but toast the tight wad manager. It 's management fault for not having their resources allocated efficiently. The little lady that is the hostess has been there forever and is always cheery and happy! Bartenders / waiters are always on their game and are great!
Douglas L.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,20,2,3.0,5/20/2015,"The food, well it's Chili's so nothing spectacular in my opinion.  I will admit I have not tried the new Tex-Mex items. I do like the Cajun chicken pasta a lot! Its not too spicy but Tabasco sauce will fix that right up! The guacamole is pretty good also. Every time I've been here the service is slow!"
Katie J.,"Austin, TX",14,8,,3.0,8/20/2015,"I'm in town for business and figured Chili's was a safe bet.  The hostess (sweet lady) noticed my drink order hadn't been taken about 5 minutes after being seated, so she took my order. The waitress was attentive until a large group of men came in halfway through the meal. Service went down hill after that. The hostess came back around and offered me a to go drink. She was the best part of the experience. She went above and beyond her responsibilities, because the waitress was not providing good customer service.  I ordered the smothered chicken burrito (new item). It looked nothing like the picture - way bigger and kind of sloppy. It did not come with a side of black beans, as advertised. The taste was okay. I ordered a dessert to go and when I got it back to my hotel, there was no plastic-ware. It's Chili's though, so I don't know what I expected."
Chris H.,"Bellaire, TX",5,4,5,1.0,6/17/2015,Ordered the turkey burger with guacamole and it did not look good.  Had to get in my car to return it back.  Manager gave me a new one but offered nothing more for my inconvenience and additional wait time.
Makayla S.,"Houston, TX",118,8,6,1.0,3/24/2016,"My husband and I love chili's and we were so excited when we moved out here to see how close this one is, sadly it's horrible.  We've ordered to go 3 times from there with the same result each time. When we got there we waited 20 minutes for our food to be ready, even though we went at the time they said it'd be ready. We've had to check out order before leaving the restaurant because each time they have left something we ordered out of the bag, the food is cold, not just a 5 minutes drive home cool, but cold when we pull it out of the bag, when we've gotten burgers the buns are ripped and they look thrown together, the salad looks disgusting and has wilted/brown lettuce. It's just a very poorly managed location. We've tried calling about the quality of the food once or twice but it doesn't do any good. We've also eaten inside twice thinking it was just the to go, it's not. The food and service is the same quality inside as it is in to go. It's worth the drive to go to another location, even the one 20 minutes from us, the food is still warm and put together by the time we get home."
TexanGal 4.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,20,32,1.0,4/4/2016,DO NOT try to have lunch at this Chili's unless you have more than an hour to eat. The restaurant is never even 1/2 full however the past few times we've tried to have lunch there it takes 45 minutes to get our food. Then when it finally arrives it's never how it was ordered. The waiters have zero sense of urgency even when told we are on our lunch hour. Mediocre food + bad service = unhappy customer
Sherri S.,"Georgetown, TX",18,11,2,3.0,9/27/2015,I hate that my child likes to eat here! This place is so filthy.  I feel like I need a shower after touching the menu.   They are always short on wait staff.... Wondering why???  Thank goodness we had a good waitress today or I might have lost my shit (3 stars are all for her!).  I could see the fear in my son's eyes as we sat down at the table. He was quietly pleading with me not to freak out.  Sorry buddy! I just think that a place of business where you pay money for food should be clean and offer good service... Is that too much to ask????  Not mentioning the food because I know what to expect here and if you're honest with yourself so do you. It is what it is.
Jim M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,,3.0,9/18/2015,And so ends the streak of good luck and Chili's.  Slow service. Indifferent wait staff. Lousy plate presentation.  But the food was good.
Paula R.,"Richmond, TX",0,25,5,2.0,6/1/2015,Overall I love chills the food is great every time I go there. Except for the past few times I've gone with my family the hosts seem to be the issue. They are extremely rude not on the same page so we got skipped numerous times and when we made them aware of this she tried to give us attitude claiming that those people came in before we did. Umm no ma'am we had been sitting there while these people were coming in they had the same amount of people we did so no excuse and they would get sat at booths which is what we asked. Other then the hosts being horrible everything is great.
S L.,"Houston, TX",1,42,11,1.0,10/23/2015,"We had dinner here, and the entire experience was terrible. The waitress was nice but when I ordered boneless buffalo wings, she looked at me as if I was speaking another language. I had to explain to her what I was talking about. Maybe nobody calls them that anymore, but she was so confused.  Walking past the kitchen to the restroom I was appalled at the condition of the kitchen floor. There were chips among other things all over the floor. We ordered chips and queso, and the queso was cold.  The food arrived in a timely manner and the order was completed correctly, but as we were eating our dinner someone in the kitchen continually kept dropping the f bomb. It was not a pleasant dinner and we will not be returning. There was not another adult in sight for us to even speak to. Just the teenagers running this joint."
Margo S.,"DeSoto, TX",1,39,3,2.0,6/1/2015,"Horrible service when i visited on 6/1/15 while visiting Houston form Dallas. Ordered take out and 30 min later order wasn't ready. But the party I was with's order was ready (with missing items). Every time they would check on it and say it's coming up but never could tell me how much longer. This happened twice. I finally asked for my money back. The waiter told the manager. Another 5 minutes passed by. I asked to see the manager. He finally came out and handed me a receipt for my refund. No apologies, neither did he offer to rectify the situation. Just gave me the receipt and said here is your refund. MOST restaurants would have compensated me by giving my food free, especially since it was already prepared."
Jessica G.,"Rosenberg, TX",5,21,32,5.0,11/11/2015,Came in for a Veterans Day Dinner with my husband.  We received excellent service from Roderick. The husband said the old timer burger was excellent. Thanks for all you guys do!
Vic C.,"Houston, TX",12,244,8,3.0,6/14/2014,"Don't ask me why I just ate in a place with an 88 sanitation rating.  OK, ask....  Because we'd already walked in, I hadn't checked the rating in advance, and hubby hates going from place to place. It was actually OK.  Food and service were both satisfactory.  Video screens with advertising very annoying, but I just turned ours around. I'll not be back unless they improve their sanitation, though."
Tara R.,"Angleton, TX",1,14,18,1.0,10/20/2015,"The food is fabulous if you can get it! They never seat you on days there is no one there on weekend they are super busy but at least you get to eat at some point! If you are craving there food I suggest you call and pick it up that's the only way you get to eat it. I've been here several times and it's either busy or empty with no service. Just call and be satisfied. Food I give 5stars hats off to the chef, front of house service I give a 1.  I left today and went to Texas road house I was to hungry to call and wait."
Bibin T.,"Missouri City, TX",24,32,78,1.0,2/25/2014,"I guess I had everything go wrong!! I was seated in a timely manner I'm good there the table was dirty looked like someone wiped it with a dirty rag I was hungry and wiped my table with my napkin.  ordered the food and it took 40 minutes to get it, in my books that's too long for an Enchiladas plate.  I was not so happy but I kept my mouth shut and didn't mind it much told the waiter to get me a togo box and my bill, what blew my top was it took her another five minutes just to get the bill and when I got the food packed up all I had was a soup spoon.   A SOUP SPOON!!!!   WTH! would eat an enchiladas with a SPOON.    I understand chilis is not fast food but there's a level of understanding on how long it takes to cook something.  on the positive note I got my water real quick.  I did tell a manager about this event I didn't explain all of it since I was really pissed.   I'm well known in this area I'm always welcome many other places and Ill be taking my business there wont be going there again.  And there was a guy who looked like a manager who was busy flirting with a customer and just chilling in her booth didn't want to be a cockblock."
