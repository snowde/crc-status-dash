Susan E.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,18,1,2.0,7/2/2014,"Eh, what can I say about this Chili's? For starters more often than not the service is sub par, sometimes bordering on rude.  I have been a fan of the food for years, but they've recently changed ingredients or preparation of the items that I usually order and the changes have not been for the better. I don't usually eat in the restaurant anymore, but I do still order take-out occasionally. The take-out staff is always friendly and helpful. I have no complaints about their service."
Lauren M.,"Houston, TX",1,6,,2.0,2/17/2016,"We recently moved to the area and decided to call in food for dinner. I called four times and got the busy tone each time. Called the fifth time and someone finally answered, but I waited 5 minutes on hold before hanging up. Gave it about 2 more minutes and called back and I got a hold of someone to answer my call and place my order. I show up 10 minutes later to pick up my food - understandable that it wasn't ready - but the poor guy next to me had been there for 20 minutes and he placed the order about 15 minutes before he showed up. The waiter had accidentally given his order to the lady who had just walked out so he had to chase her down to get the food back. 10 minutes later (20 minutes now) I'm still waiting for our food. They weren't busy in the restaurant, but the to go service was very busy. The location infront of HEB closed because of poor service and not enough revenue, hope this one isn't. Unsure if we will be back."
Amy K.,"Richmond, TX",3,7,2,1.0,10/3/2014,Normally have pretty decent food and service here but not this week.  Terrible food (twice in the same visit) and terrible service from manager. Sure we will be back because not Alot of restaurants out here but still nasty!
Benjamin T.,"Richmond, TX",43,35,176,3.0,8/21/2014,"It's Chili's so you know about the food. I have been at this location about ten times. Seven of those time the service was below average. Usually when I go it is not busy, but the service is poor. As I speak I ordered wings with ranch, and they brought me blue cheese."
Roel R.,"Wharton, TX",0,8,,1.0,11/6/2015,"I wish I could put 0 stars.  Came here for drinks and watch Thursday night football.  Basically planning on spending a few hundred dollars over the course of the evening.  The restaurant side had 4 people.  The bar had about 10.  TV was good so I stood at one of the tall tables at the bar with 2 others.  2 more members of our party showed up (5 total) and we were advised we could not stand at the bar table because it was made for 4 people and only had 4 chairs, and having an extra body standing there was a fire hazard for the wait-staff to move between the restaurant.  I looked around, the whole place was essentially empty so I asked if I could talk to the manager to try to accommodate our party.  The waitress says ""oh you sure can"" in a sarcastic/rude way and leaves.  The manager comes a few minutes later and we have the same conversation.  I explain that ther bar is empty and I don't see why we could not just stand at the table.  She says there's no exceptions.  I was rather mad by that point, so I told them I could fix the problem by having zero people at the table, and B-dubs across the plaza was jammed packed because they treat their customers better than this.  I wasn't going to beg to stay, so we paid for our first round and left. BTW...as we're leaving there's another party that advised me that they were put on a wait list to be seated, when there was no one there too...said they also had a ""weird"" experience at this place."
Ricardo C.,"Richmond, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/15/2015,"Food was amazing! Cooked perfectly, and arrived on time. Our waiter Ben is the best server I've ever had anywhere. He was quick, attentive, and very nice. I will definitely come back here again just because of him. Granted everything else was great, service is my number one concern when trying a new restaurant or new location. This place had it all!"
Mark S.,"Sugar Land, TX",10,23,6,1.0,11/30/2014,"Everything was good until the food came out. My wifes burger was, well, basically bleeding. Way indercooked. It was still raw. The place was dead so no excuse. They did make another one but it took more than 15 minutes and in the meantime my food was cold because I didnt want to eat all my food while my wife watched. The manager did appologize, but that was it. He should have made sure my wifes food came out much quicker."
Chase W.,"Needville, TX",23,4,,4.0,12/4/2013,"Food is always good at Chili's but this time our waiter sucked horribly. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get refills on my sweet tea. It was to the point where I almost got up and served myself. Not fun when you have 2 young kids with you that need refills also. But like I said, food was awesome, had the bacon cheddar burger with fries. Will definitely be going back again, just hope I get a different server."
Lissa B.,"Needville, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Worst experience ever!  I'm a health care professional (nurse) and my coworkers and I decided to go have a COUPLE of drinks after work, which is rare for us between work, kids,  husbands, etc. Had a great time venting/socializing to each other until the check came and some of us were charged for an extra drink.  Would have been fine if they would have just corrected the bills BUT we had to go through the waiter to a manager and then to another manager (MARIBEL) that had the audacity to say if they ordered extra drinks they would be sitting on the bar and there were no drinks on the bar.  Pretty much calling us liars! She then went through the whole visit with us from round to round as if we were alcoholics trying to get free drinks! While trying to explain to Maribel over and over that we did not order/drink those extra drinks added to our ticket she rolled her eyes and said ""It doesn't even matter"" and finally fixed our check! Wow!  Worst/childish/unprofessional restaurant manager ever! Besides that mess the food was good!"
J S.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2015,The cook was eating and working on our food.  The manager saw us watching him and told him to move out our line of sight.  The food was cold and the service was awful.
Kevin T.,"Buford, GA",34,44,38,4.0,7/3/2013,So Chilis is Chilis but as soon as you walk in you feel like family! Everyone are talking drinking and having fun! so far I have felt welcomed to an elite team lol I just saw where one of the guys poured Tabasco sauce in his miller! Supposedly everyone here does! Great times decent food but wonderful regulars!
S C.,"Richmond, TX",1,11,2,1.0,4/26/2014,Wow!  Worst experience ever at Chili's.  We were  there an hour and a half.  Waitress made an error inputting our order and it was never sent to the kitchen.   She would have known this if she had came by our table the next twenty or so minutes after the order.  Another waiter refilled the chips and salsa. Another one had refilled our drinks before we ordered food.   To me the worst part was never having the manager come over and apologize.   Food was okay.  Came out after each part was cooked so it was separated. Will not go back to this location.  (Was told they are about to go through a remodeling)
Dottie H.,"Rosenberg, TX",2,68,,4.0,2/10/2013,"I lived in Sugar Land for 35 years. The Chili's in SL has consistently gone downhill, so much that we would not go there. Service was just dreadful and very slow (if you could get a waiter at all), orders mixed up. Poor manager. This one in Rosenberg, however, rocks. Service is fantastic, waiters friendly and caring about you, and food is generally good! Always a line of people. However, I do always order the Carribbean salad and the chicken is very bland. No taste. They must keep it in a water based heater like McDonald's. Blah! But the enchilada soup is very good! Hubby likes his orders. And I love any salad with Honey Lime Dressing. But they DO need to fix the bland chicken."
Karla M.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,4.0,3/17/2013,"This chili's probably had the best costumer service I've ever experienced from any chili's I've been to. Our waiter Bryce, or Brice was really interactive and provided us with an unforgettable time."
