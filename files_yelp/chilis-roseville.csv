Aaron T.,"Rocklin, CA",382,188,116,4.0,11/28/2017,"This review is a tough one. Chili's is a chain restaurant and you know what that's all about already. Satisfactory food. That in of itself doesn't tell you much. As noted, the food is fine. You pay for -- in this case -- cheap Tex-Mex food. The margaritas are adequate, the chips are good, the salsa is better than expected and the rest is Tex-Mex-iness.  The space itself is, again, unremarkable. The restaurant itself is on the cleaner side, so I'll give it that. Chili's staff are friendly, nice and chatty.  I'm torn, since three stars (""A-OK"") seems low because, as a chain restaurant, I'm not holding this place to the same standard I would a unique establishment. I'm giving Chili's four stars not so much because I'm a fan but because it's a bit better than other bland, unremarkable, boring and blah chain restaurants. Thanks."
JennyLynn J.,"Fresno, CA",50,4,,1.0,9/16/2017,"We had a server that we only saw long enough to take our order (which didn't come back correct) and didn't see him again. Very inattentive. We were to an an excuse for him by another server but that's not our fault as a guest. Hamburgers were burnt on the outside and both burger and buns were dripping in grease, (as if painted on) so bad there were puddles on the tray.  Won't be back to this location!"
Elaine N.,"Sacramento, CA",8,8,12,1.0,9/14/2017,"We got food poisoning here!!!!!!! Pease avoid!!! My boyfriend and I had the chicken strips and some other things, we threw up everything over and over again that night and were sick for a week after.  I would hate for anyone else to have to go through that."
Tania F.,"Lincoln, CA",64,6,,5.0,1/10/2018,Best serving staff ever!!!! Luke is our favorite but everyone is super nice!!! The food is great too!!
Lauren M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",6,8,1,2.0,1/6/2018,I am a huge fan of chillis and came to this location while visiting the area. The service was fine and so was the food. My only reason for such a bad review is how absolutely disgusting this location was. We were sat down at a table with ketchup all over the place and dirty napkins on the table and crumbs everywhere. It clearly had not been wiped down at all. There was only a few other customers here so there was no reasons for this. When asked to get our table clean the waitresses asked the buss boy that was sitting at a table with his friends to clean. He grab a towel and simply pushed all the trash on the floor and sat back down with his friends. All the empty tables were equally if not more dirty then ours. Mean while all the waiters sat around talking and continued to  walking around the mess
Phani K.,"Roseville, CA",0,13,12,3.0,12/19/2017,"Decided to go to chili's after so long. The server was very nice but the service was really slow. Ordered French fried, onion rings and nachos for appetizers. The nachos were cooked in a way where each chip had a lot of cheese on top, but taste wise it was average. It was lacking more toppings. Then for main course I ordered the grilled chicken fajitas. It was a huge portion, came with 4 small tortillas and lot of chicken. I added my own little touch and put fries in it too, it was satisfying.  I just wish the wait wasn't that long, but overall food was decent."
Estella J.,"Roseville, CA",125,4,3,3.0,1/5/2018,Blue lagoon fizz(drink;BEST DRINK EVER even though it has sprite and fruit punch in it it is very tasty looks like an ocean with a lot of detail like gummy fish in it they only have this drink at the movies when you see finding dori there salads are delicious but there crispy meat is not very tasty i have tasked better it I think it is discussing and ok at the same time
Calvin W.,"Sacramento, CA",11,10,6,1.0,12/27/2017,Managers very rude ! I order the chicken nachos every time I come to chili's ! There always the same ! First time I complained the manager called me a lier to my face ! Won't be revisiting this place in the future ! Update I have bad stomach issues and since I ate a couple of the nachos I have been in the bathroom with terrible terrible problems ! I never ever had issue from this place till tonight !
Valerie K.,"Citrus Heights, CA",501,648,933,5.0,3/5/2017,"Good service and good drinks. The only thing that irked me is that if you click on the apps on the table tablet, it'll automatically charge you for games. Our server removed the charge without an issue though. Blood orange alcoholic beverages were great. I had the blood orange punch and it tasted amazing."
Anthony M.,"Lincoln, CA",1,29,23,4.0,12/10/2017,Chili's is a great place to eat! They have a wide variety of food that the whole family will enjoy. The staff was friendly and the food was great. And if your in the mood for just a drink they have a big bar right when you walk in with TVs to watch the games.
Joshua B.,"Rocklin, CA",122,20,12,2.0,11/12/2017,"Came here for veteran's day dinner last night, our server was Francis (I'm pretty surr) at table 53 last night. Initially went well until our food came. Two meals came with cheese when we both asked for no cheese. Took Francis and two other waiters 10mins to bring us a side of ranch, really? We get the tab and we're initially charged for the free veteran's day meal, but he quickly changes that. I had the chicken and waffles, which was really good. Overall service wasn't that great."
Lilliflower J.,"Roseville, CA",3,57,37,4.0,8/11/2017,We had a really nice lunch here. Service was good. The food was fresh too. My only complaint is that the lunch crowd left the place a little messy and the floor wasn't vacuumed and the door going in and out was dirty. Big deal though
Beverly V.,"Roseville, CA",0,15,16,4.0,10/3/2017,"Have always loved this place.  Loved that they HAD expanded the menu to include burritos and various semi-Mex plates.   Well, that didn't last long and now their menu is very limited.   Loved the big prime beef burrito.   All gone now.   Bring the expanded menu back, please."
Spencer H.,"Mendocino, CA",0,7,7,1.0,7/24/2017,"This place has gone down hill.. service with no eye contact, delivering the wrong food.. frozen burger patties reminiscent of school cafeteria food.. wait, that's a disservice to school lunches.. Restroom smells like rotting food and mildew, oh and we actually counted the fries, 21 on my wife's plate, 18 on mine.. wilted salad, surprisingly her soup was spot on.. but her turkey club was delivered sans bacon, or avocado.. and no one checked on us.  Not going back."
Diala M.,"Palmdale, CA",37,9,1,1.0,10/12/2017,Worst food ever ... my pasta came undercooked and cold my husband chicken fajitas was awful don't go there
J Z.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,4,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Fathers Day has to be the lowest point in this locations existence. Filthy, noisy, unfriendly staff, wrong food. Just an all around disaster. I tipped 0.00 Can't recall ever doing that. It was the only way to make a point. The manager wasn't interested in making things better. It was so bad I went onto the Chilis website and left a detailed account. No response yet. Won't be back. Won't recommend. And no response from Chilis. We've both moved on apparently. Haven't been back. Won't go back"
Valerie D.,"Elk Grove, CA",40,22,3,1.0,10/16/2017,Never Again I'm not a fan of refried egg rolls smh. How can a top shelf margarita taste like water. No need to speak to Management paid for my drink that was left on the table and we left Never Again.
Blake M.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,24,10,5.0,6/23/2017,"I know..... I know...... Just another Chili's. We come to the Rocklin/Roseville area about 10 to 20 times a year for my teenage sons basketball games/tournaments/camps. We normally stay in the hotel across the parking lot & have never had a bad experience here EVER! Staff is AMAZING! Most times a wait to get a table but worth it. Normal American Cuisine with a twist like every Chili's. 10+ beers on tap. Food always comes Out QUICK, even with a group of 20+. Still the staff is what keeps us going back! We come here almost every time we come to town. Never disappointed. If you go to any national chain come to this one! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
Kerri B.,"Roseville, CA",37,70,17,5.0,9/23/2017,We had lunch here today. We sat in a booth in the bar area. We received great service with a smile. This is a great place to watch a college football game and grab lunch on a Saturday.
Alexandra C.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",8,26,26,3.0,2/6/2017,"Great food, but not the greatest service. Are bigger on having personal conversations vs customer service."
Raky R.,"Rocklin, CA",0,16,,1.0,1/30/2017,"1st visit to this location and how was my experience : HORRIBLE !!! We were party of 3.. After a small wait our food arrived. None of our entrees were good. Informed the waiter the same and he said pick something else - (well, we picked up something from the menu already). We just decided to pay the bill & leave..now more troubles..The smart kiosk they have on our table has the wrong bill since there was a mix up with our backtable who had our bill which was half of their actual bill (which we had) & apparently they paid that showed up on their kiosk and left. Waiter informed they are fixing it & disappeared for 20 mins. He then comes up with a paper bill & disappears again which was still wrong. He comes back to serve table next to us & then he took it back to got it fixed finally.  Alright tasteless food, 25 mins wait to pay your bill, terrible service. Do we need anything else to spoil your saturday everning ???"
Wes S.,"Lincoln, CA",41,354,23,4.0,7/1/2016,"After all these years I am still down with some Chilis. And right now they are having a heck of a deal which actually tastes pretty good too. It also helps that my buddy paid for my dinner(plus 2 tall beers) since he lost a bet. Seriously though, running through July 3rd you get a side salad, half rack of ribs, french fries and molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream/hard shell chocolate (drum roll please!!!) fooooorrrrrrrrrr $10.99. Good deal!!! Make it a full rack for $6 more. I was all over that like flies on sh!t. Of course I made it a full rack, since, you know, I wasnt paying. Lol. Another cool thing you can split the half racks into two different flavors. It was well worth it and some good grub. Plus watching my A's pound the Giants was a special added bonus. Ya!!!"
Jenny P.,"Midtown, Sacramento, CA",1076,509,3792,4.0,10/26/2015,"I really miss the Chili's on Eureka and Rocky Ridge, but this one also gets the job done. It's tradition with a group of my high school friends that we end a night at Chili's. We did this recently to conclude an evening of screaming ourselves hoarse and blowing out our hearing at Aftershock 2015. There are two things that stand out at this Chili's, making it a dependable choice in the Roseville area. 1. Service The waitress we had was a doll. They seem to always be on top of it here. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees were out without much delay at all, and it seemed to be reasonably busy for a Saturday night. They were out of a seasonal cocktail still listed on the menu, so the waitress gave me a recommendation that was on point with what I was originally wanting to order. It was super yummy! My friend asked for a little bit of soda to take care of his low blood sugar, so she brought him a kid's cup and didn't charge him. That kind of thing really makes me want to come back to a place.  2. Quality of Food Chains are often all over the place with food quality, I've found. You visit one location and it could be a completely different experience from another location. I went to a Chili's in San Leandro and it was cold wings and soggy fries. This location serves food that looks exactly like it does on the menu. No gross textures or lukewarmish cold plates to be found here. Good job reppin' R ville, Chili's. Nice to know we can still count on you after all these years."
Jenni T.,"Roseville, CA",346,970,7114,3.0,10/10/2015,"I came to this Chilis location with my Husband and Mother in Law for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. They weren't busy inside which was nice, because we were able to find parking and a table easily. Let me say up front that I HATE the new stupid iPad like tablets that they now have on every table. You can order food and pay on then (credit cards only) but isn't that what a server is for? You can also play games on them but I think eating out should be a special occasion and an event to spend quality time with your family and friends. Not one to have your face buried in another electronic device. Does this make me old? Maybe. My Husband and I always order the same thing every time we go to Chili's. He has the Buffalo Chicken Salad which he loves. It's an ample sized salad with a good amount of crispy spicy buffalo chicken. I always get the Unlimited Soup and Salad Combo which comes with Chips and Salsa, a House Salad and a bowl of Potato Soup. The salad is ok (I'm not a big salad fan) but the Potato Soup is really great. Super cheesy and flavorful and it can be made Vegetarian by taking the bacon off the top. The chips and salsa are really good too, but think they should come free with every meal. They do give a large basket though which is enough for the whole table to share. I can only finish one serving of everything even though it's unlimited. They also have A Black Bean Burger, Enchiladas and a Flatbread Pizza for Vegetarians as well. Service was good and the place was kept clean. I would come back again for lunch because of the unlimited soup/salad/chips combo and the prices aren't bad. Not the most healthy meal, but good for the occasional treat."
Justin R.,"Penryn, CA",4,22,6,2.0,3/29/2017,"Seriously disappointed, Chili's. -.-  $34 for food, and less than mediocre is the quality I get.  Our food looks like something I could have gotten from a fast food restaurant, for less money.  I'm NOT HAPPY, Chili's.  I know you can do better than this.  The only thing appetizing was the order of Southwest Eggrolls."
Ammar E.,"Sacramento, CA",2,11,3,5.0,2/22/2017,"This is my second time here , there was a new menu and excellent service, Brittany our server was nice and patient, I will be here again for sure not to mention the food was delicious as well. Thank you Brittany."
Mandy A.,"Roseville, CA",1,16,,1.0,12/17/2016,"If you like horrible and slow service, this is your place! At 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, with not that many people in the restaurant, it should not take 35 minutes for appetizers. Ridiculous!"
Derek M.,"Roseville, CA",9,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,Really good food. Two for 22 deal pretty solid and enough for leftovers. Even if they make a small mistake they will quickly make it right. Nice little place to go after Saturday bowling
Bobbie R.,"Sacramento, CA",89,362,926,4.0,6/5/2016,Our waiter was very efficient.  Food was all good. My dining mates said the margaritas were yum. All good.  We came in on a Saturday evening and were seated right away.
Kristin P.,"Citrus Heights, CA",75,35,29,5.0,6/23/2017,"Excellent service. Chips, guac, and salsa are the best! Drinks are never empty. They have great coupons too so it's a great value."
Jennifer S.,"Roseville, CA",641,207,2,4.0,9/26/2016,"Ok, so I probably eat here at least once a week, sometimes more.  I always order my food to go and lately have been ordering online.  I like that their online menu has the option to customize each item.  Sometimes the wait time can be a little off though, depending on the day and if they're really busy.  The young woman who works in the take out area is always super pleasant, she's there most nights that I go and always greets me by name.  They usually get my order right, there's only been a couple times they've forgotten an item.  My favorite entrees are fajitas, margarita chicken and Cajun chicken pasta.  They have a 2 for $22 dinner that includes an appetizer.  It's always a cheap and quick dinner and pretty yummy!!  If you dine in, make sure you try one of their tropical sunrise margaritas- they're quite delicious!"
Robb S.,"Roseville, CA",31,91,2,4.0,6/11/2017,The BEST Chilis I've ever been too.  There new Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers and Waffles is AMAZING... There new Watermelon Margarita and Watermelon Cooler is truly refreshing.  The staff is totally friendly our server Tammy was great and I hope they appreciate her because I would totally steal her for my work..
Robbie R.,"Rocklin, CA",15,322,991,4.0,4/18/2017,"Out of all the chain restaurant/bars we have around here in Rocklin/Roseville, Chili's is prob my fave, above like Applebees and the like. I like to sit in the bar area for happy hour. I do get all these food offers in my e-mail form Chili's, so that makes it more worth coming too. The President's Margarita is really done well, even though the Margarita is from a powdered mix out of a big plastic bag, it still taste good. The burgers are good here and then they have the lava cake. I probably come here every couple of weeks, and service and food have always been just fine."
Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73,4.0,1/18/2016,"I have to be honest with you. I was absolutely *SHOCKED* by what Chili's has to offer these days.  I haven't been to a Chili's in at least a year and their revamped menu is legit. They've revamped the whole thing... and it was clear right from the get-go.  My wife ordered a side-salad and she was totally expecting a pre-packaged, iceberg salad.  Instead, it looked like fresh mixed greens with leafy lettuces (rather than iceberg) as well as other greens.  We were all pretty surprised. All of us ordered something from their new Mexican food menu, beginning with the appetizer.  We ordered chips and guac.  There are two options on the chips and guac - one is table side and the other is ""fresh"" guac... I don't know the difference, but since it was $2 less to have it sent from the kitchen rather than in front of me, I figured I'd order it from the kitchen. For $5.49 you get a ton of guac - probably at least a half-pint.  The bowl they put it in was overflowing and it was very, very fresh... it seems as if they made it back in the kitchen as there were several pieces of guac that weren't fully cut up (but that was fine.. I smashed it up myself).  It wasn't the best guac I ever had - probably because it is majority guac and salsa/veggies rather than what they do at Chipotle - which has serious amounts of other items (like cream). I ordered the three tacos plate.  It came with black beans and w lime/cilantro white rice (notice everyone is moving to this?).  I had one carnitas and I wanted to try their new prime rib tacos so I ordered two of those.  The carnitas had more flavor (as it should) but I can't hate on the prime rib tacos.  They were very tender.  They also put cheese, rice, salsa and a slice of avocado in the tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla (one thing I didnt like... I'd prefer corn). My wife ordered a chicken burrito which she finished... and she NEVER finishes her burritos.  Usually she takes half home. My father in law had fajitas with the prime rib and shrimp.  They looked really good... although I'll admit - they looked significantly greasier than Chevy's.  But he loved them and definitely cleaned his plate. My mother in law had a salmon plate with broccoli.  The broccoli looked like it was just steamed - still a bit crispy and not mushy. My son wanted pizza.... so that is what we got him.  It was almost exactly like Pizza Hut's personal pizza.  Looked and tasted the same.  I don't think they're owned by the same company (Yum brands) - but it seems there is some kind of partnership going on... there are also tweets about it. Anyway - the place was great... have to commend them for getting fresher and healthier. Don't get me wrong, you're not going to save a bunch of calories by going here.... but you'll have much better options. This restaurant is one of many (Red Robin being another) that has that stupid tablet device where you can pay your bill and order stuff.  The ordering didnt seem to work... so it ended up being a huge paper-weight during our actual meal.  The nice thing was, with a 2.5 year old and 8 month old, being able to pay when the kids start to lose it."
Jeffery M.,"Sacramento, CA",63,26,1,5.0,5/3/2017,It's our most favorite place to eat we've been eating there for a year everything is pretty much stayed consistent. Service food price. I would recommend this for Monday through Thursday crowds too heavy on Friday Saturday or Sunday.
ColaroyaI ..,"Carmichael, CA",2,23,,2.0,1/10/2017,5 onion rings in an order.  My sprite was refilled with water.  Burger was OK I scraped the thousand island dressing and the McDonald's class bacon to the side.
Sonya P.,"North Highlands, CA",0,6,9,1.0,4/10/2017,"Tried calling to ask a few questions regarding a 16 guest party. All I got was someone picking up and hang right up. If your busy and need me to call back at a different time, i would do that if told to. I called 4 times and they just kept picking up and hanging up. Lost business."
Joe S.,"Rocklin, CA",480,199,125,2.0,10/8/2016,Chili's hasn't changed much since we were going to the Fair Oaks location. The food is pretty good but the service is awful. We had the sliders and some fajitas which were both quite tasty but the waiter never checked on us and my drink was constantly running dry.  This is a waiter that we used to get in Fair Oaks so I know he's been doing it a while. You would think he'd have gotten better at it...nope. Don't know if were gonna go back or not. I just wasn't that impressed.
Kimberly M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",133,90,116,3.0,3/24/2016,"Vegan review!  I will forever love Chili's Presidente Margaritas. You just can't go wrong with it honestly.  It's strong, but not overpowering. It has always been executed wonderfully in various locations.  And this spot did it well. Five stars for the margaritas and signature cocktails. Pricing is moderate, but it's whats expected from a restaurant.  As for the food selection...it's okay for vegans. I honestly go for chips and table side guac and I'm a happy camper.  Recently, I was actually hungry for more than booze and guac (shocker) and ordered vegetable cadillac fajitas. I'm used to any fajita plate they offer coming with tortillas. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was TONS of rice. I was too hungry to care and inquire.  My veggie fajitas consisted of some onions, some bell peppers, a bunch of broccoli (which I wasn't expecting) and rice on top of the platter. I'm used to my rice and beans being on the side....which I still got. So I had a TON of rice.  I would have definitely preferred tortillas to enjoy making my own tacos, but I was really there for the margarita anyway.  Long story short: I'll stick to just drinks and guac here :)"
Kelley V.,"West Sacramento, CA",18,30,,2.0,8/3/2017,Santa Fe salad was very wilted and only had a few tortilla strips on the bottom of the salad. I provided feedback and received a $10 gift card.  That's not even enough to pay for another salad. Very strange.
