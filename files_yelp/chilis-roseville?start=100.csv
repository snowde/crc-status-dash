Sadie M.,"Lincoln, CA",2,58,,2.0,2/8/2015,I'm giving this place a 2 star only cause the waitress was nice. But my tummy hurts from dinner. My bf is also feeling funny. The shrimp was just funny looking and the broccoli was brownish. I wouldn't recommend this place.
Travis S.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,108,31,3.0,12/14/2014,This is a good chilli's but not the best. What makes the best chilli's is the cooks and these ones seem lazy. Our corn was boiled for a couple days and when they gave us a new one you could tell it was fresher but they probably hadn't changed the water in the pot for a while because it tasted like a sour corn tortilla. They gave us a free corn dog though so that's cool I guess. My pasta sat under the heat lamp too long so the noodles on top got hard and rubbery. The chips from our chips & salsa were literally dripping with grease. Other than that everything was okay. We will definitely stick to the one closer to our house
Don B.,"Antelope, CA",39,30,,1.0,8/18/2013,"Walked in party of 2, the restaurant was full. No manager in sight, teenager running the floor. She was the bright spot. She got us seated quickly, server came right over and took our order, we never saw her again until we got the check. They seem to have a ""team"" approach to waiting tables. They put 2 servers in a section, you would think that would prevent anyone being ignored, you would think, not so. In the meantime they sat a large party behind us, which became their main focus.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, my wife got the bacon ranch quesadilla's. Her's came out hot and fresh. Mine was stone cold including the rice and beans. I pushed it aside and had to flag the hostess to send them back. The only time we saw a manager, she came to tell ""just so you know, the slaw and salsa on the shrimp is cold so that will make the shrimp cold!"" No kidding? What about the rice and beans? Shouldn't they be hot? The reality mine died in the kitchen waiting for my wife's. She left in a huff and had the tacos remade. The beans and rice were obviously microwaved, The beans were still bubbling when they got to me.  After we were done our sever came back by and in her highest cutesy voice asked how everything was and if we wanted dessert. No, just the check. We then had to wait until she refilled the beverages at the large party behind us to get our check.  Hey Chili's, here's an idea, there are no customers in the back of your restaurants, hire and train expo people and get the managers out front to run them.  If your a manager never ever scold a guest because the food isn't what was expected. I've had food and service as good a Taco Bell.  If your a server had a copy of the check ready to go so your customer doesn't have to wait. That one little detail would have saved her tip. I didn't stiff her, but I only left the 8% the IRS will tax her for."
Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33,5.0,1/12/2015,"Brand new building conveniently within stumbling distance of two also new Marriott properties, a Springhill Suites and Towneplace.  Convient access right off the highway, TV's abound, and a very friendly staff and atmosphere.  Same menu you get elsewhere, but you come back and it still feels new.  5 stars because of the cleanliness and staff.  I think that deserves special recognition, you're not going there expecting fine dining or a elaborate experience, so I'm rating accordingly.  It was obvious some friends there enjoyed the 5 TV's they had in a row at the bar covering the games.  Thanks guys, look forward to stopping by again sometime."
Robyn A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/18/2015,Awesome food and service.  I love bringing the kids here for the lunch specials.  Our server Max was beyond awesome!
Christine L.,"Rocklin, CA",1,12,,4.0,7/15/2015,"Their food is consistently good...not great. The appetizers are good (try the deep fried pickles). BUT, hands down the best margaritas anywhere. The El Presidente is fabulous....or try the El Presidente blackberry margarita. Yummo"
Jaime L.,"Roseville, CA",0,22,27,1.0,10/16/2014,"Rarely go to Chili's and the last time was about two years ago. Decided to go here for lunch today. Tried out their lunch specials and selected two appetizers, a chicken enchilada cheese soup and a small bowl of chili. Our lunch entrées were a double cheese burger with fries and a chicken fajita plate. The food was poorly prepared. The chili was sent back because it was served cold, not even warm. The soup was warm, not hot. The burger was average, but no better than a fast food burger. The precooked chicken fajita meat was cold and served in a hot skillet. We had water with our two lunch special meals and the total bill was $20 including gratuity.  We will not be returning for awhile as there are many other restaurants nearby."
Teresa S.,"Roseville, CA",0,35,,5.0,8/4/2015,"We just ate food from Chili's to go on Fairway in Roseville. I have to say it was great! Four of us all ordered different food, and everything was right on~ We have avoided Chili's since we were unhappy after a few visits when they first opened. Mostly for poor service. Tonight we had the Fresh Mex pairings, Fresh Mex bowl with carnitas, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, and Quesadilla Explosion Salad...All were great, including the packaging, which was top rate! When we got there, Nicole took everything out of the bag and made sure it was as ordered. Great experience!"
Kate F.,"Rocklin, CA",89,73,111,3.0,1/19/2015,"It's your standard Mexican food chain restaurant - nothing more, nothing less.  Menu contain Mexican options, as well as hamburgers, chicken entrees and some fish.  Salads are my go-to here.  Highlight:  great bar area to watch the game and enjoy happy hour and the table top game tablets to keep the kids busy."
Lisa R.,"Roseville, CA",0,38,1,5.0,10/25/2015,I eat her once a month and it is the best!! The food is bomb and the servers are amazing! The queso and chips are so yummy!
Chris S.,"Bakersfield, CA",76,349,1772,2.0,4/3/2013,The food is good but the menus were so dirty our hands had to be washed twice. That leaves a bad impression and makes you wonder what else is dirty.
sherry w.,"Rocklin, CA",5,18,,2.0,7/12/2015,"To start, my husband walked in, told the hostess, table for two, she looked at him and yelled, ""i am busy"".... well not a good start, then to find out they took potato skins off the menu... overall , not a good experience, will not be  back."
Cheenong V.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",10,2,1,1.0,6/23/2015,Got to the Resturant and the server was just horrible. I know it is late but they didn't have to be rude about it. I just walked out. Didn't even order nothing. Don't deserve my hard earned money.
Terry W.,"Roseville, CA",41,162,41,4.0,7/23/2013,We stopped by 7/21 before our movie. This store has had a remodel and the bar with the TV set up is way better to watch a game. Looks like they got alot of new servers that were hustling! We only had drinks but the bartender was doing a good job.
David M.,"Roseville, CA",5,84,5,2.0,8/3/2014,"The food here is pretty good but the service has always been pretty bad. I really don't like the new table electronic devices they have...can't sit down for a meal without the ""Man"" trying to get money out of my pocket and it's a big fight with the kids....also its another way to down size employees and takes the personal service out of a Dinning experaince."
Leah M.,"Carmichael, CA",42,12,,1.0,4/10/2015,"My husband, kids, in laws & myself went here tonight for dinner & honestly it was one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes we waited a hour. They brought waters out & one of the cups had mold on the inside lower portion of it all the way around (not sure how that was missed) we all agreed waiting another 30 minutes to a hour somewhere else was to much at this point & could just be an isolated incident. We waited forever for our food, people who were seated after us were being served before us. Finally it came & my steak was raw I asked for medium rare so I sent it back. Well it came back with a long black hair. Needless to say I had no idea you could have so many bad experiences in one sitting. They took my meal off & the kids meals. The waitress acted like nothing was wrong & I left hungry. I would not recommend ever eating at this location!"
Kristina P.,"Roseville, CA",16,19,13,5.0,6/3/2014,"Awesome service, great drinks and food and really good deals too!"
Nicole C.,"Lincoln, CA",2,3,,1.0,7/26/2014,"Chillis is by far my favorite place to eat but tonight I was externally disappointed by my server, he couldn't keep our drink cups full and when I asked for mango flavored tea I didn't receive a single one. Also he didn't clean up very well and would run away from the table before we could make I could make any kind of request. Pretty damn bummed...."
Lezli D.,"Roseville, CA",2,63,,5.0,4/5/2013,"My fiance and I go there at least once a week for our favorite salad, the ""Quesadilla Explosion,"" and to use our email coupons for a free appetizer or dessert.   The best part, however, is the staff.  Haley is a wonderful hostess; I can't wait until she becomes a server!  Alex is awesome!  No matter where we're sitting, he always comes over to greet us.  Tammy is a sweetheart and has the prettiest smile.  Kiera we don't see much anymore since she works more in the bar area; we miss her.  Honestly, everyone there is great.  It's also nice to see all the familiar faces every time we visit.   Thanks guys, for the food and exceptional service!  See you soon."
