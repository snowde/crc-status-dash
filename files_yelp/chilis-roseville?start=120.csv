Mike C.,"Antelope, CA",47,15,,1.0,1/8/2016,Not a good family night.Took 15 minutes to get water and 15 minutes to get chips and salsa.Waiter kept doing a disappearing act.Then I made the mistake of ordering a rib eye.I ordered med well and it came out 10 minutes after chips and came out medium rare.I showed waiter when I saw him he said hed get a plate to put steak on and hed throw back on grill.He brought it back in 5 minutes.The steak still pink.By this point Im hungry so I attempted to eat it.It was tender but Grisel throughout and still parts rare.Broccoli could've came from target next door.No seasoning on Brocoli nor the steak.We sat there in discontent for 10 minutes after we attempted to consume what they call ribeye and finally bill came up on play screen at our table.Paid bill electronically and walked out.Waiter did'nt say thanks or anything.
Kay M.,"Placer County, CA",0,18,,3.0,5/7/2015,"Food (sirloin steak this time) was good as was the ambiance. Service a little slow. However, what really pissed me off was being sat at the Crap Table next to the kitchen. The restaurant was less than half full, so there was no shortage of available space. And my husband and I were dressed up for our night out, so it wasn't like we were a couple of bums who had just wandered in off the street. I think this was a case of ageism ... senior citizens aren't considered ""cool"" customers by some young hostesses who like to play god. Management needs to train staff to value every customer, no matter their age."
shalini c.,"Rocklin, CA",811,185,1358,3.0,1/1/2011,"Been eating at Chili's for years. It's my nieces favorite joint. I usually get the same thing, the old timer burger. The cool thing is that now with the invention of Foursquare, when I checked in, I unlocked a special for free chips and salsa. RAD Great family place, the staff is very attentive, and their bar is huge!"
Affy L.,"Vancouver, Canada",21,58,10,4.0,7/19/2014,"Our waitress was cool. I like their new ordering and pay system. I love the chips and salsa here too. I order from the ""light"" menu and it's so flavourful and not too overwhelmingly filling! Just right!"
C C.,"Roseville, CA",1,19,2,2.0,1/24/2011,"I've been to this place twice in the past couple of months. All I can say is they are nothing fantastic, kinda boring.   Don't get me wrong on the service though: the staff is attentive, and try very hard to satisfy the customer, but there's something about their eagerness that gets annoying...I don't know how, but I'd gotten some hot sauce on my fork handle and was wiping it off:  ""Can I exchange that fork for a fresh one, ma'am?""  -- Really?  Call me an ingrate, but that was just weird to me. The food:  On my first visit to this particular location, I ordered their Caribbean Salad with Grilled Shrimp: (The menu says: Fresh pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cherries, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds and honey-lime dressing. With your choice of grilled chicken or grilled shrimp). The salad was fresh and I was quite surprised at the abundant quantity of Grilled Shrimp I got, but the Dried Cherries and Sesame Seeds were missing! My girlfriend and I hadn't seen each other for quite some time and were gabbing it up a lot, so I didn't find the opportunity to mention it to them. Perhaps the abundant Shrimp trumped my complaint...? On my second visit with my husband at around 8pm on a Saturday night we ordered the $20 Dinner for Two; we chose: Chips n Salsa, Fried Shrimp and the 1/2 Rack Baby Back Ribs. The Salsa is boring and tastes canned, the chips were fresh and warm, tho'. The Shrimp and Ribs were at the perfect temperature when they arrived; the Shrimp was but plump and juicy, but flavorless. The Ribs were tasty but were quite dry at the bone, so you end up pulling/flossing much of it out of your teeth because it's dry. Both came with fries, in addition the Shrimp came with Cole Slaw (does anyone really eat soggy cabbage?) and this weird ""Tequila Lime Sauce"" for dipping the Shrimp; we didn't like it. The fries had a lot of dried and overcooked pieces hidden under the fresher made pieces - slick move Chili's...   Of particular note: They should offer a salad or veggies appetizer in this $20 Dinner for Two - wayyy too many carbs.... I won't be going back anytime soon - there are many other restaurants in the area to choose from that I know I won't be bored with..."
Frank S.,"Union City, CA",7,74,47,1.0,1/10/2012,"Nobody cares about you it seems when you show up. A group was front of me, then they waited for a bit too, and finally then got seated by someone who had a ""bad face"", without even welcoming me, nor telling me something, about the fact I will be seated  or something. :( 10mn waiting more, and still nobody come back to me. Walked in the whole place, trying to find anybody that could help me, but instead I encountered ""I am busy right now"" faces instead. I just left the place, and went to Quiznos after instead. At least, the experience saved me some money on lunch."
Heather L.,"Rocklin, CA",2,26,,4.0,8/9/2015,Historically I've never been a big Chili's fan. It was one of those places that you went with co workers for lunch and was always OK. We recently got a gift card and so we went one night and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems like they had overhauled and greatly improved their menu. I had the tacos which were excellent. I especially liked the grilled fish taco. We all enjoyed our meals. Another big plus was you can pay on the little machine at your table and not have to wait around for your waitress to finally decide to check you out. A great idea for a place right next to a movie theatre so you don't have to worry about catching your movie. The prices were pretty reasonable too.
Mike G.,"Lincoln, CA",2,21,11,1.0,3/30/2014,"Got food poisoning from an undercooked steak! took 2 bites noticed it was raw then told the waitress. the steak dinner was comped, the rest of the meal wasn't. the manager (im assuming it was the manager) came over to talk to me with no introduction and said she had removed the steak dinner from the bill. so we paid the remaining balance and left. shortly after i got home i became violently ill and still feel like crap today. thanks for nothing, Chili's. your service sucks! I'll never come back and guarantee i will tell everyone i know not to ever go. i want my money and food i haven't been able to keep down back you bunch of jerks."
Dominic R.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/6/2013,First place I've been in 2 weeks where I didn't physically use my debit card. The morning after eating here someone tried to use my card information to buy 1000$ worth of women's clothes and perfume. Good thing I have fraud protection. Coincidence that every worker in the bar area was female???
Ashton C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,25,,5.0,3/25/2014,The service here is so awesome! I always feel right at home when I eat here! The beer is always cold and the fajitas are delicious!  The chips and salsa here are awesome and I thinj thwy have a great deal on a sirloin plate! This is the best Chili's ever! I really love Meghan who works in thw lounge/bar area she is the sweetest and so helpful!
Dave K.,"Sacramento, CA",296,121,11,2.0,10/7/2014,This may have been an off night.  There was one big party that showed up before us and it may have slowed down the kitchen.  Chili's has revamped their decor and changed up their menu a bit.  They have also added these new fangled video screens at the tables that makes paying your check easier.  NOT!  If you pay cash you will have to wait twice as long.  It almost seems like the servers are confused at the whole concept of paying cash.  Service was so incredibly slow.  I looked around and there were lots of families with little kids in there.  They need to see this and get food to them quickly and get those families out of there.  I hope this criticism helps because it was so slow that my wife said she'd never come back.
J B J.,"Roseville, CA",0,28,12,4.0,12/17/2013,Catering for 20 people. Food was good but not plentiful. Very accomodating regarding vegetarian needs. Chips all in small pieces. Free delivery.
Michael S.,"Lincoln, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/1/2015,Good food and service at this location. The price is always reasonable as well. It's not gourmet fare but pretty good for a chain.
Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",375,450,411,4.0,2/27/2011,"LOVE Chili's. Yes, it's a chain.  But it's still one of my faves.   Usually when I come here, I eat pretty light with no heavy dishes.  I can usually fill up on their bottomless chips and salsa.  However, when we were given our menus, I saw that they had a new starter.  The skillet queso.  Served with chips and salsa.  How could I pass that up?!  The dip was served sizzling and hot, and with my first bite, it was so tasty!  I actually ignored the salsa and focused on this cheese dip.  Seriously, you gotta try it. For my meal, I went with my usual - chicken enchilada soup.  It's delicious and full of delicious flavor.  I recommend it!  I love the chunks of chicken, tortilla, tomatoes, and cheese.   Finished it all off with a strawberry lemonade, of course!"
christy r.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,50,39,1.0,12/12/2012,"I am giving it 1 star because the service is so terrible. My friend and I were very hungry and remembered that chilis had a cheap happy hour I put my order in first because she was not ready, she put hers in about 3 minutes after me and her food never came I was completely done eating before she had to get up and ask for our server and you say that we wanted our check and we would find her food somewhere else. Our server never came to apologize which seems kind of Cowardly to me. A manager came and apologized and said she would take care of our tab (cool) - redemption points. Oh and we had to ask people to fill our drink because our server didnt pay attention"
C C.,"Foresthill, CA",32,49,15,4.0,3/30/2013,"Before moving here, I had never eaten at Chilis and I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. I am a pescetarian and the seafood selection is pretty good. I am unsure if they have a veggie sub for the burgers. Not vegan friendly."
Casey H.,"Roseville, CA",33,9,8,2.0,2/15/2012,"I have always had good service here, but the food is just OK.. I prefer Chevy's down the street over this place.  Multiple times I have ordered the Molten lava chocolate cake and the inside is hard not lava at all which is super disappointing :(  We usually only come here if we have a gift card or two..  The El Nino drink is pretty good tho!"
Michelle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,43,46,2.0,12/2/2011,I'm going to be completely honest.... Back home in so-cal they don't charge for the chips and salsa ... So I started off kinda bummed because I look forward to those as I wait for my meal... I still ordered them but was really disappointed when I had to wait 20 min for my meal then when it did come it was terrible. Those new chicken strip they have are nasty. I should have stuck to what I usually order (boneless buffalo wings) but I wanted to get the two for 20 dollar deal :/ I honestly don't see myself going back. Sorry Chillis you were one of my favorite happy hour places back home ... But not in Roseville :/
Ryan E.,"Roseville, CA",1,23,35,1.0,7/9/2013,Me and my wife went in a couple days ago and noticed they remodeled the place.  It looks ugly now. It's like they are trying to be an upscale restaurant serving frozen food cooked in a microwave. We ordered the same thing we always do and it tasted like crap! I will never eat here again! The employees are rude now too! Probably due to the amount of complaints they get. Garbage!
Rob D.,"Roseville, CA",10,41,1,3.0,9/9/2012,"$20 dinner for 2 was good.  I had a small steak and Syl had the shrimp. It was good.  Service was attentive.  The A/C was so cold we couldn't wait to get out of there.  No chance for a beer or margarita. It is freezing .  Never sit right near the door, the vent is right above you.  Did I mention how cold it was?"
