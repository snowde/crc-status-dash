Kyle C.,"Roseville, CA",26,4,,2.0,12/27/2014,"My boss took us here for a business lunch, and Im glad, because I would have been very upset had I payed for the food and service myself. I ordered the ""cajun"" pasta. There was nothing cajun about it. There was no spice and the sauce was extremely rich and boring. The shrimp was cooked and seasoned well, but that was the only part of my dish that I enjoyed. Our server was a tall young man who seemed very disorganized. The restaurant seemed to have average traffic for lunch time, and this kid was running around like a chicken without a head. He was very distracted and it was difficult to flag him when we needed something. We couldnt tell if he was ignoring us, or just that oblivious to his surroundings. I didnt realize my pasta meal came with garlic toast until the server randomly brought a slice over to me once I was almost done with my meal. He said ""heres your toast"" and walked away. I understand customer service isnt what it used to be, but theres got to be a line drawn somewhere before it goes completely extinct. I will not be returning to this location, at least not on my own dime."
Paul S.,"Sacramento, CA",13,5,,5.0,11/8/2012,Easily the best Chilis experience ever. Best staff! Great food!
Lexie M.,"Post Falls, ID",0,44,,4.0,4/3/2013,"Was here last week. Food was great, can't complain. I got the 2 for $20 deal, and they were more than generous with refilling sodas, and chips & salsa. The restaurant tends to be a little loud, but service & food is worth it."
Julie K.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/12/2013,"Tried to give this place another try after staying away due to previous horrible service and nothing has changed. After sitting and waiting at a dirty table in the bar area to be greeted and have our table cleaned off, no one came.... So we left!!! Never again at this one!!"
Demitri F.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2014,The service was great but the food quality is terrible and has gone down in the past few years.
Steve M.,"Roseville, CA",0,46,,2.0,2/3/2014,My wife and I went for dinner on Friday night. They sat us on the table next to where everyone stands to wait. We had people standing over our table while we tried to eat. My wife's soup they forgot and my enchilada was firey and for the most part unedible. Forget the rice. We'll try someplace else next time.
Brad F.,"Sacramento, CA",18,110,9,3.0,7/18/2012,"Standard chain place, but hey I work in Roseville so it is bound to happen every now and again.  Plus hey I see all of their commercials so I feel it is my duty to at least try their sliders.  I have to say between happy hour discounts and the attractive staff, not a bad deal at all."
Amanda R.,"Rocklin, CA",65,5,,5.0,9/21/2012,"This was one of the best, if not the best visit I have ever had at a restaurant.  The food was incredible, but what really made the experience was our server. This server  Was extremely prompt, offered suggestions, and made sure that we felt like his number 1 priority. We will be making this a place we visit more. Thank you for the excellent experience!!!"
Mike O.,"St Paul, MN",0,42,,1.0,5/5/2014,"The to go service here is just awful! Rarely have your order ready, or can even find your order in their computer. The order is also not usually correct. Ordered my food for 5 pick up. Got there and the place was empty. Still had to wait until 525. Not one apology or even any sympathy from any of the workers. This has happened several times now! We are done ordering from this terribly managed place!"
Leslie G.,"Rocklin, CA",76,15,5,5.0,1/7/2012,"This is one of my favorite nearby restaurants!!  Staff are friendly and food is good and pretty quick to receive.  My fave is the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, and the Blackberry iced tea (also have mango tea)."
Corky C.,"Roseville, CA",1,118,,3.0,10/19/2012,"You kind of have to be careful what you order.  Some of the dishes are quite good, but for example the hamburger is very average and not worth the price (it's like a Costco frozen meat patty, could have done much better making it myself).  Avoid the 2 for $20 deal because you are too restricted in your choices.  Service is fine, environment is fine."
Katrina H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",41,81,2,4.0,1/27/2014,"Went on a Saturday night after 8pm, They were packed. It took 5min for them to seat us. As we go to our table an awsome guy Kevin (our waiter) before we sat asked for our drink order!  I love that. He was very personalble and friendly. The atmosphere was upbeat and the food and drinks were perfect and cae out fresh! It was served in record time with the best service there was."
Stephanie D.,"Sacramento, CA",20,7,1,5.0,6/13/2012,Love love love it!! My boyfriend and I go in weekly for texas cheese fries and margaritas!! Erin is the best bar tender and has helped to make this place one of our favorites!!
Howard M.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,21,,4.0,4/22/2014,"This Chill's is far above average. Our lunch was great, as always. I have never had poor service here. The manager should be proud of his/her staff. This restaurant is very clean. We will always return to this Chili's when we are in the area."
Shyla B.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,1,2.0,6/19/2013,"My husband and I had lunch there this past monday. When we first walked in we were greeted and promptly seated. It was pretty dead in there, but it was 2pm. It took about 10mins for our server to come to the table. We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and our meals. We ordered the southwest egg rolls for the appetizer, which came out promptly.  They were ok, not as good as I remember. Five minutes after we received our meals. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos and my husband ordered a plan cheeseburger. The tacos were supposed to come with coleslaw in the tacos with the shrimp. What I got was dry lettuce,  which made the tacos dry. There was some sauce with the shrimp, but the shrimp was pretty dry and overcooked. The meal also came with your general rice and something they call beans that were in a soup cup..it was really watery and very unappealing. .gross. my husband's burger was dry. The service was not great. As soon as we got our food, she went to the table behind us and picked up their check and then came back to our table and asked how was everything. .seriously? You just dropped off our food 2 mins ago, I havent even touched it yet. Another pet peeve of mine, the biggest actually, is right when she put the food down on the table she dropped off the check.  I HATE that. It is so rude, it is trying to rush us and gives off the vibe that they dont care. I kinda understand, to an extent, if they are SUPER busy, but come on. We were probably the fourth table there.The server only came by to refill our drinks and take some plates.  Never said thankyou or you're welcome. So the food is enh..service is really lacking."
Elsa M.,"Roseville, CA",38,64,75,4.0,11/8/2011,The people here are very friendly.  I usually sit and eat at the bar.  The food is always good and reliable and people there are great.
James H.,"Lincoln, CA",0,6,1,2.0,4/9/2011,32 minutes and NOOOOOO food. Waiter is obviously attracted to my wife though. It was so obvious even the kids commented on it. All in all the meal ended up being great but the beginning ruined the chance for 3 stars.
Jessica H.,"Roseville, CA",35,14,2,3.0,1/4/2012,Did online ordering. Super easy.pick up was easy...food wasn't as fresh as in the restaurant....
J N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",20,64,23,5.0,12/18/2010,"I put in an order during work, so I could pick it up when I got off... I walked in as a waiter was walking out. He had his phone out and a drink, so he looked like he was going on break. He stopped and greeted me and asked me what I needed. I told him about my to-go order and he referred me to a bartender who was supposed to process my order. I waited ... and finally they figured that I paid online and gave me my receipt. This went on while the waiter went into the kitchen to grab my order. I thanked him. I was glad to be done, so I jogged back to my car. I got into my car and checked my food. I had an order of artichoke dip without chips? I was pissed because I really just wanted to go home and eat.  I walked back in as the waiter was trying to walk out again, and he stopped and asked me what was wrong. I told him my issue and he dropped his things and ran into the kitchen. He handed me a BIG bag of chips and apologized for the inconvience. I apologized to him because he looked like he has been trying to go on  break, he told me it wasn't my fault and that he actually is off. He wants to go home too! But I couldn't tell because he stayed with me and made sure I was happy! I love it when people treat their customers like they are right. Which has been very hard to find these days (at least for me). There is nothing I hate more than an associate of a company (or a manager for that matter) is trying to excuse their wrong doing. Repeat with me slowly ... THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. I'll never forget Elliot and his treatment. He corrected the error and made me forget about why I was mad. Also, he was trying to go home too ! Psh, I'm not even sure I would've done the same thing :P I called a manager the next day to tell him about Elliot.  I don't mind returning to an establishment with great customer service :)"
Andrew P.,"Lincoln, CA",4,14,5,4.0,12/30/2011,Chili's to me is just another chain restaurant but this time it was made better by a great server. We were seated and our drink order was taken promptly. Once or drinks were delivered our order was taken and no sooner than a 15 minutes our order was brought out to us except my daughters food. Our server Juan had come back to our table with Mandarin oranges for my daughter who was already getting annoyed by not getting her food with ours. Juan told us of a mishap in the kitchen and my daughters food will be out in a few minutes. because he was quick thinking and brought out something for my daughter to eat while waiting for her food we were spared a pout session. I will go back again with the hope that everyone that works there has the same foresight and attention to detail.
