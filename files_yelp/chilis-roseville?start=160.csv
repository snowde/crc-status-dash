Darren M.,"Roseville, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/1/2014,"My wife and I stopped in to have a late lunch. We sat on the bar side to get in and out a little quicker. I order the nacho and she ordered the triple dipper with wings and burger bites. Just appetizers, nothing special. Oh and we order two cokes. It took 30 minutes to get our order. I'm a patient person but 30 minutes for appetizers is ridiculous. The nacho was a joke. On the menu the nacho comes regular and large, I ordered the regular. I assumed (and yes I know what happens when you assume ) that it would be a plate with a decent typical nacho. Nope it was 8 nacho chips with cheese, a bit of meat and a jalapeño slice on each. My wife's wings were barely warm. We asked the waitress about the nacho when she brought it and she stated that the menu says the number of chips on the nacho. Of course my wife immediately looked at the menu and it doesn't state that. At that point I just wanted to eat and get out of there. No use in arguing over the number of chips, it was the fact that for the price it should be ""regular"" nacho. I didn't expect much from this restaurant but expected better service and food than what we received. The bill came to 26 dollars and change. What a waste of money. We won't return again."
Kasey G.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/25/2013,"My family likes to place To-Go orders from here. We've had problems in the past before where they forget a small item, but the employees working the To-Go counter are always very nice about it. I think they have incorporated into their routine to show customers the food they ordered to make sure nothing is missing because they've been doing that lately and I think that's a great idea. Can't comment on the floor service since I have not sat down to eat in there in a long time."

HappyReviewer J.,"Rocklin, CA",0,16,,5.0,8/6/2011,"Ok, I will eat bugs if the service is good enough. Fortunately for Chili's, their food is good. But tonight I was a little disappointed when my boyfriend and I got take out and when I got home, my burger was so pink! Not even a rare pink... Like... Not cooked pink. We called and the manager, Todd, was so great. He offered to replace the burger (which was cooked perfectly!), fries, and even threw in a complimentary dessert. We didn't want anything for free, in fact, I think it is super rude when customers expect something free when the service is not to their expectations. But we thankfully accepted Todd's hospitality and will DEFINITELY be coming back to this Chili's. Its the little things that count! =) Thank you so much Todd and staff!!"
