Nic S.,"Los Altos, CA",0,7,12,5.0,6/25/2016,Savanna you are amazing.....your customer service was outstanding and the food was fresh and tasty at 11:01 pm on Saturday night. Thank you.
Michelle W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/23/2017,"If there was a separate rating system based on service, I'd be giving ZERO stars.  We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday.  They called ahead to make a reservation for a party of 8, and were told a reservation was indeed needed for a party of that size.  The hostess called back to ask if we could move up the reservation time from 7:00 to 8:15, which was fine, and we all arrived promptly on time.  When we arrived, the host was incredibly rude and had a real smart mouth and attitude.  He said we didn't have a reservation, because they don't take reservations for parties of less than 10.  If that's the case, fine, but there was no need for the rudeness.  A less abrasive, more service oriented approach would have been, ""We're sorry for the confusion with your reservation, but we'll try to get you a table as soon as we can"".  The host just shrugged, as if to say, ""Oh well, not my problem"".  When we asked if a table might be available for us at some point, he responded with, ""I don't know.  Maybe 30-45 minutes"".  We didn't expect to be catered to, but WE didn't make the reservation mistake. This isn't the first time this host has been incredibly rude.  My husband and I came here for lunch a couple of months ago, and this same guy was just an absolute jerk.  I wish he had been wearing a nametag so we could let the corporate office know his name when I call to complain.  I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but seriously, if this is how you treat your customers, you need to get out of this line of work.  We all have bad days, and I get that, but to be so rude, and to be the first person a customer speaks with when you walk in the door, is a very poor representation of Chili's. We didn't let it ruin our fun time last night though.  We went across the street to Applebee's and had a great meal, a great time, and great service.  None of us will be returning to Chili's and I would imagine most of our own family and friends won't be going back either."
Kyra M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/22/2017,"The arrogance and the rudeness of of the host was surprising. We had made a reservation. Upon arrival, we were told that reservations were not available for parties under 10. We had even been called back by a worker to confirm a later time. The host showed no interest in resolving the situation and would not accept any blame on the side of the restaurant for what had happened. We left and went across the street to Applebee's. I am only leaving one star because i can't leave any lower. There are not enough negative stars to give this restaurant."
Jeff F.,"Antelope, CA",32,30,28,1.0,6/15/2015,Chills chilis chilis where do I start the game was great lets go warriors but I noticed a older woman complaining. The only this that was going through my head was why. We had to wait 29 minutes after getting our margaritas and it wasn't because the server came over and check on us I was just tired of waiting and called her. You would think selling food would be there number one priority but it isn't I guess. Also don't restaurants ask if you want desert I ended up going to Johnny garlics down the street for desert. Food is ok. But the service is SHIT. I used to be a server for 3 years so I know what you can get away with by doing the minimum and we by no means even got that. Do not recommend (also 2 managers were on the back wall the whole time standing like they were in a club get your lazy asses up and help your servers deliver better service.)
John J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",100,448,113,2.0,3/27/2015,"Run of the mill chain restaurant. This is the closest Chili's to my house so I have it up a few times. I would probably hit it up more often but there is just nothing special about it.  I have tried out both the main side of the restaurant and the bar. I would recommend the bar side. Service in the main restaurant is way off. Service at the bar is okay, but you should reorder before your drink gets too low. The other day I came in behind a group of guys for the March Madness games.  I ended up sitting at the bar next to them and had the normal bar banter with them. When I asked for my check the ""lady"" bartender said mine was included with my groups tab.???? I asked for it to be separated since I was not with the group - Huffy attitude -. Kind of the trend at this place, service is just inattentive and a bit off. They have several on the bar side TVs so it's not a bad place to catch a game. The food is standard Chili's chain stuff = Not bad, Not great."
Jason S.,"Roseville, CA",543,716,1840,3.0,1/11/2016,"Wish I had more to say, but it's well you know Chili's...came here last night with a large group after a cheer competition and great thing was they took a reservation for our party of 14 and held a table for us which was pretty cool even though they were pretty busy! But everything else was just Chili's...the best part for me was my wife and I as well as our 2 girls all did the 2 for $20 and had water so relatively got our pretty cheap..also the best thing on their menu is realistically the guacamole/salsa and chips and that's what we had as our appetizer. For me I had the margarita chicken and  my wife the sirloin both were meh and that's what you expect so yes a 3 star and sure wasn't expecting much more. My girls and all the friends were super happy and nice to un wind with close friends after a hectic day."
John B.,"Olivehurst, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/10/2016,We went to Chilis in Roseville and had to wait 45 mins for our food! Our server never checked on us and my husbands burger was over cooked! It was not a good experience and we wont be back! The manager didnt even come out and check on us.
Jami N.,"Roseville, CA",415,400,416,5.0,12/27/2016,My family and I came here for dinner very helpful and friendly wait staff chips and dip are very good I will be back for future visit
Fred D.,"Los Gatos, CA",90,106,4,4.0,12/18/2016,"Better than some of the other Chillis Ive been too.  Better staff, more friendly.  Food presented faster and in a more courteous manner.  If you have been to this chain and like the food this is the one to go to."
J V.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/7/2016,"First of all, Kayla gave us excellent service. She made sure our every need was met and she had a smile on her face the whole time. I love to see waiters and waitresses who seem like they're happy to be there. Second, the food was great. Will be going back."
Chris M.,"Rocklin, CA",1,11,,1.0,7/28/2016,"This is the only restaurant's where your rewards points ""expire"". Bj's, Red Robin, Applebee's, just to name a few I have had points for over a year that I saved and didn't use and they are still there. I had 164 points and they expired so now I'm back down to zero. Never again. I'll be going to Applebee's across the street or one of the other eateries nearby."
Francine B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",131,228,338,1.0,6/17/2016,"Usually a big fan of this place but our last visit was rough. Our waiter dropped our tray with two of our entrees on it- not a big deal accidents happen and he was very nice about it. This has no influence on my review. Party of 8 with 3 kids, restaurant steady but not slammed. Took 20 minutes for drinks to arrive, another 10 to place order and about 30 minutes for food to come. Since our tray was dropped by son got his meal ten minutes after everyone but my husbands never came because the waiter didn't realize his burrito was on there too. We had to flag down the server for a refill on the kids drinks when we were sitting there for a  very long time in between each and every step. We asked for napkins a few times before they came. We never received water. It took two full hours for just 8 entrees and three desserts. With kids that is brutal- should have only taken an hour max. They said they would comp one dessert which they didn't and we had to wait 15 more minutes for them to fix the bill. Food was ok but the service was pretty subpar. Accidents happen but after the service we received and how long we had to wait no one had a fun time."
Mary B.,"Sacramento, CA",28,29,98,4.0,1/15/2016,Great place to have soup and salad. Service is quick and nice. Friendly staff. Food is excellent.
Lawrence S.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/19/2016,"I called about 5 hours ago on Father's Day and asked if I could order just some full racks of ribs. The person who answered the take out phone desk said yes, a full rack of ribs (10) would be $13.99 and would include no sides. I told her I didn't need sides because we were making the rest of the meal, I just wanted to order 4 full racks of ribs only. I asked her how long it would take and how far in advance I should place my order today and she said give them about 1/2 hour because it's busy today (which I expected). But...when I called about 4:30 today, they said there was no such price for a full rack of ribs and that I could only buy the full rack meal with both sides. I told the manager I already had the salad and meal prepared and we only needed the ribs for Father's Day. They said they there was no way they could help me and someone gave me the wrong information. This just ruined our plans for today and we had to rush out and buy some chicken instead. To say the least, I am extremely disappointed that they couldn't work around their ""system"" and help us out, after they gave us the wrong information earlier. That's what I call POOR customer service."
David W.,"Roseville, CA",341,63,398,3.0,12/24/2015,"It's just another Chili's. With chain restaurants they are mostly all the same regardless of where you go. That can be a good thing. I know what I like to order and now and then they have cool new stuff to try. The thing that separates one from the other of course is the people and atmosphere.  I'm not going to criticize this location, this location is just fine. In my opinion it is like every other restaurant in the area and unfortunately a seemingly growing trend in regards to ""people and atmosphere"".  I try to think of an analogy and think of an amusement park. You know you wait in line excited for a new ride or even a familiar ride and wait, and wait all the while observing the employees manning the turnstiles, collecting tickets, seating a never ending stream of anxious customers to their designated seats while talking amongst themselves about what they are going to do once they finish their shift of this humdrum job.  Again I am not being critical of this Chili's rather what seems to be a widely accepted atmosphere, especially here in Roseville/Rocklin/or California as far as that goes. Most places in this area can get slammed and I understand the pain that must bring. Other industries would love and welcome such a pain!  So ""how was the ride"" you ask? it certainly wasn't exciting or fun for me. In fact I didn't see anyone that appeared happy to be on the ride. I'm not sure it was worth the wait but at least I got on the ride. After all, I was hungry.  To summarize my visit: Sat down order taken food delivered asked to have my bill corrected paid my ticket left successful transaction for Chili's"
Georgia H.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Very disappointed.  Don't plan to go back.  The frozen margarita did not taste like it had any mix or tequila in it.  The quesadilla explosion salad was tasteless and the lettuce was soggy.  The waitress was friendly but not very well trained on the new computer app.  Our ""split"" bills on the kiosk on the tables were both incorrect.  The waitress tried to fix it and finally came back with a paper bill."
Chelsea R.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,9,7,2.0,12/29/2016,"Pretty bad food... we tried the skillet queso ""with seasoned beef"", but there's no beef in it... they'll tell you there is, but couldn't find one bit. The fajitas were okay, but the steak wasn't very tender. They also charge extra for sharing a plate. I won't go back."
Josh N.,"Folsom, CA",611,1292,568,3.0,6/11/2015,"As a young couple the Mrs. and I would frequent a Chili's at a chilling rate. In recent years we had grown apart from Chili's. Today I had a work lunch and Chili's was the choice. It was comforting to see nothing has changed. They had a good lunch deal, House Salad and Chicken Fajitas, for 8 bucks. The fajitas were tasty just like old times past. The service was alarmingly slow for not being packed but it was nice and friendly. It was a decent experience."
Randy S.,"Honolulu, HI",28,305,57,1.0,6/7/2015,REVOKING MY PREVIOUS/BETTER REVIEW - TONIGHT'S DINNER WAS HORRIBLE. AND I MEAN HORRIBLE I had the 6oz steak from the light menu. It was full of fat and gristle and was unedible. Every time I cut into it i found another layer of fat. I left it on the plate virtually untouched.  My wife had the mango tilapia. It had the flavor of fish that was turning bad. Much of that was left on the plate too. My daughter had the kids meal mac and cheese with corn on the cob. Now bear in mind: she is a mac and cheese eating machine. She left half of it in the bowl.  All in all we had a very disappointing meal and we never heard from nor saw a manager. I made it a point to express my feelings on their ziosk survey too. I hope someone sees It. If i ran my business that way I'd be out of business.  I expect some sort of contact and a comped meal at the very least.
Christine N.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,27,1.0,4/16/2016,"If there was a way to give zero stars it would have been for this visit.  Chili's is just another ""box eatery"" - I don't know what an equivalent name would be so I'll steal the gist from 'box store'.  I don't have incredible expectations, but because this is that type of eatery, I hold my customer service standards to be of the norm.  Even then, it was far from met.   Usually Chili's is a great place to take kids because no one really notices if your kids are being a little loud.  It's family friendly.  Menu is the same everywhere.  However, I won't be returning to this particular Chili's due to subpar service, all around.  What a difference a location and its employees can make on an experience.  (See my rating of a different Chili's).   A) We got into Chili's and asked for a high chair.  We were given one with just one strap.  We asked the hostess, as she literally walked away from the table, if we could have another one because of the missing strap.  As we were doing so, a table adjacent to us decided to also use that opportunity to complain about their highchair.  (This table had been at the establishment long enough to already be eating their appetizers.)  The hostess then went to go look for other highchairs; turns out they only had one chair in complete condition that was available.  She came back with the chair, went to our table first to let us know, and then also told us that because the other diners were there first they were going to get the working chair.  She would bring us a chair if one became available.  We asked as to why they were getting the chair first even though we complained first and she offered no reason or even apology.  Issue was never revisited by hostess or manager, etc.  When we inquired again, they brought out a chair with a partially broken clasp - but a chair that clasped and did work nonetheless.  Why they thought this chair wasn't as good as the one with the missing strap beats me.   B) Our server took a long time to come by the table to get our order.  We asked for the kids' meals to be put in first (and it made no difference).  Our server took a long time to check on us.  Our server took a long time in general.   C) Food was delayed.  It was not extremely busy nor packed.  We were seated right away and there were plenty of empty booths and tables still.  There is no reason the kids' meals should have taken as long as they did.   D) We ordered our entire meal with dessert all at once.  The server decided to withhold the dessert order AND forgot.  She came to the table to tell us about how we could pay at the kiosk and then remembered she hadn't put our dessert order in.   E) Our server was missing.  A lot.  We had to go to the hostess or other servers for things like napkins, to-go boxes.   F) Our kiosk didn't print out a valid receipt.  If you're going to rely on a kiosk to do part of your job, make sure it's doing the job.   Oh, and yes, we did leave a review (available on the kiosks) and we did let the server and hostess know that we were upset about the delayed dessert order and highchair.  It didn't seem to make a difference."
