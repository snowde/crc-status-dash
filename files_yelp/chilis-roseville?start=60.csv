Gene K.,"Pacifica, CA",3,119,14,1.0,6/7/2015,"Was coming every so often until my last visit. The picture of the smoked wings on the menu looked really good, all spiced up. When I got them, they were bland with a little spice on one side only..terrible terrible wings..needed ranch dressing to have some sort of flavor. Should of complained right there and then, but didn't.. E-Mailed Chili's guest relations (Brinker) with my issue...got a response telling me they will have the Chili's Roseville management contact me..nothing, I e-mailed guest relations 3 times and to this day no contact from anyone at Roseville...I was a regular at the El Dorado Hills Chili's and loved it before it was closed down...I guess Chili's in Roseville really don't care about customer service. I know it's just chicken wings, but it's the principle...NEVER again!!!"
Caitlin S.,"Livermore, CA",0,38,1,1.0,1/4/2017,"I tried to order take out tonight (Wednesday) starting at 915 and was hung up on over and over because I'm assuming whoever was working takeout did not want to take the order. I work in the industry, I know what goes on. If 45 minutes is too late to place an order before closing, fine, but I think I deserve the decency to be TOLD that instead of being hung up on. Finally, someone answers the phone at 935 and tells me they do not take take out orders 30 minutes before closing. I didn't want to place my order after any of that but explained my situation and his response is ""thank you"".  Such awful costumer service and I hope management takes note of this."
Alfie C.,"Lincoln, CA",266,112,52,4.0,6/8/2016,"This location is a local favorite for us.  It is near our home and very accessible near the freeway.  This location does get quite busy after about 5:30 pm.  They do offer call ahead seating.  If you install the Chili's iPhone app you can see what the wait time is and if there is one it will let you know how long the wait is and allow you to do call ahead seating.  We've always had great service here.  The staff is very kind, attentive and service is efficient.  Our favorite appetizer is the Skillet Queso.  It's basically fresh tortilla chips with chili cheese dip and salsa."
Natalie B.,"Rocklin, CA",28,5,4,5.0,4/10/2016,I called at the last minute to place an order to go. They were super nice about it. I have ordered to go several times from here. They always get everything exactly how I ordered it. It's a great place to get a fresh salad to go. They are very fast with the orders and accurate with time estimates.
Brooke R.,"Roseville, CA",23,33,14,1.0,4/13/2015,"This location can NEVER EVER get a to go order correct. I stopped going to this location awhile ago but since the Douglas location closed (who knew how to do to go orders correctly), I thought I would try it again. Totally regret it.  I ordered the 20 dollar dinner for two,  both with chipotle honey crispers,  which i have in the past,  and they've given it to me with the chipotle sauce on the side so it basically chicken strips with sauce. Completely impossible to eat it the way its served in the restaurant if your actually on the go. I'm completely aware of this and ask EVERY single time if they can toss it,  80 percent of the time,  it is not. And surprise, surprise, this time it was not either.  I paid extra for onion rings (1.00) and there was literally 3 onion rings on my boyfriends plate. My sides were a salad (1.00) and loaded mashed potatoes,  which I didn't get at all. I also didn't get any ranch or dipping sauces for any of the crispers. Just the chipotle sauce that was supposed to be tossed with my chicken. I hate having to go in and finish making my own meal when I just paid and tipped someone to do that for me.  Also the to go area was dark,  I had to go up to the bar area and chase down the bartender to pay. It took an extra 10 minutes or so,  so I was sitting in the dark to go area when the bartender calls my name from the bar and just stands there bag in hand staring as if I was wasting her time.  I will not be back, I've encountered better customer service before,  but I've spend too much damn money here to justify getting ripped off every time I order from here. Avoid,  unless you like babying employees on how to do thier job."
Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403,1.0,5/28/2014,"In February 2013 I had one of the two worst experiences at Chili's. Unlikely ever to come back to any after this last trip. My woman and I wanted to partake in Happy Hour. We proceeded to sit in the bar section and was not acknowledged for a good five minutes. The staff then gave us a menu and did not return for a good five minutes without any offer for beverages or appetizers while getting to order. We finally got to our order of Happy Hour items and menu items. We did not order anything away from the menu. No special customization. When we finally got our order in the beverages took another ten minutes. The first of appetizers didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Our drinks were finished but the server never came back around to check if we wanted another beverage. I didn't bother order anymore beverages. Another family sat down nearby at this time. The got there and was given there beverages within five minutes. At this time my woman and I have already completed the first of two ordered appetizers and our only ordered drinks. Our second appetizer arrived after the family's order showed up. I would say another 15 minutes later. We finally get a second drink, the water we had to ask for and refilled. The rest of our meal shows up ten minutes after. My women and I proceed to dine. We somehow still finish our meal before the family. I gave method of payment for the meal and I had to wait for another tens minutes for the change. The family still ended up with their check and payment before I even get my change. You never know how food will settle with your stomach. You do know when it was not prepared correctly. My lady and I definitely paid tribute to the restroom when we got home. I don't know what was more infuriating.  1- A two hour meal for my woman and I. As opposed to one hour for the family. 2- Wondering why the food took over 40 minutes to get to us. 3- Waiting waitress to come back around so I can order another beverage. Only to wait too long for any attention and not wanting anymore and just wanting to leave. 4- Having to continuously ask for beverages when the staff never came back.  5- Why the waitress hung onto my payment for so long. 6- Why the manager on duty never checked on the dining patrons. 7- Getting sick after going home.  Lastly, the restroom in this facility had COLD water. Anybody that understand sanitary standards, understands this is a most grievous food safety issue. When an employee washes their hands, they have not effectively used the soap to wash away their bathroom business.  I consider service and quality of care to customers as a basis for tips. Service wasn't good, but I still gave my server a tip in spite. By any means this server needs to learn to do a better job. Or this server needs to have a manager that will work. She needs to understand hard work pays. I have already filled out a receipt survey about the location. I have already filed county food violation form. Thank you Chili's for any survey feedback. Perhaps you should not have surveys printed on receipts if you don't address them in a timely fashion. I definitely won't be coming back. Update I was contacted by Chili's staff shortly after the complaint. I revisited another Chili's. My opinion remains unimproved and unimpressed by the chain. It is a shame that quality and service are not what it was once was before the experiences."
Dave K.,"Rocklin, CA",0,1,8,3.0,10/28/2015,Good Food at good price close to home and right off the freeway near plenty entertainment and hotels for corporate guests.. Take out has always been accurate and timely for busy schedules
Don H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,18,11,4.0,7/20/2015,"It's been awhile since I ate chili's and I don't know why it's been so long. The food was good and the service was expectional. Burgers, ribs & the Mexican trio meals were great. Our server, Nicole was not only beautiful but very efficient in providing excellent service."
Mike B.,"Lincoln, CA",2,14,4,5.0,5/22/2016,"Duke is a great server! We've had the pleasure of being seated in his area a few times, and he is consistently awesome. Shout out to Jordan too. Thanks Duke."
Susan F.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/15/2016,Used to bring my children here often then stopped - and tried again last night. We sat at a table in the bar area & had a waiter named Luke. He seemed pleasant at first then acted irritated/put off....seemed to forget about us. My children heard him muttering curse words about someone or something when walking by. I will never come back here again with waiters like him who needs it! Potty mouth & poor service as my 6 year old said!!
Vivian P.,"Roseville, CA",166,299,90,5.0,2/27/2015,Always a wonderful time at Chilis :) great staff in the bar and the food is always great and consistent. Never disappointed! We usually only come on Sunday's during football season but we came today and it was a wonderful experience :) plus the lunch menu is a great great value!!
Stephen R.,"Roseville, CA",11,53,16,5.0,10/29/2014,"A bit startled by some of the negative reviews. I've been to this location several times throughout the last few years with many different clients and business partners. Service and food was always on point. Nothing to complain about.  Came here tonight with 5 other family members and a 10 month old. No waiting to be seated for a party 6 at 7pm on a Wednesday night. Our servers were Keenan and Kayla. Never actually met Keenan cause Kayla took care of our table during the entire visit. Very friendly, polite, and patient despite our indecisiveness. Had no issues with our order.  All the staff were on top of their game despite being slightly busy for the 2014 World Series game 7 (the Giants won! Whooooohooo!). They even had 3 different tables to sing happy birthday to! Salute to the servers and cooks for a great visit. Will be coming back again in the future!"
Beckie V.,"Modesto, CA",0,13,1,5.0,10/13/2016,Just had the best experience at this Chilis in Rocklin. I am staying at a nearby hotel and ordered my meal online after a long day at work. When I picked up my order the Chilis an employee could not find my online order.  Her manager Hiram came out to review my order. He explained the timing may have resulted in the order being pushed out to the next day since I ordered close to closing.  Hiram was so kind to take our order and make us comfortable while we waited. He even offered us a complimentary soda.  When he brought out our order he took care to give us instructions on how to prepare our molten cake using the microwave in our hotel room. He put the cold items in a separate bag from the hot items. Through all of this he was very gracious and kind. He said he puts himself in his customers shoes and creates an experience he would want for himself. GIVE HIM A RAISE! Chilis should acknowledge and value employees like this. Rocklin you are lucky to have Hiram represent your establishment. It is amazing how one person can affect your view of an entire company.  Hiram turned what could have neen a bad experience into a positive one.  Chilis is on my list of faves now!
Brie M.,"Sacramento, CA",21,104,11,3.0,2/13/2016,"I used to love Chili's consistency and quality but this location was lacking. Yes, they've a variety of menu selections but food quality was nill. Hot wings were cold. My salad was good but drenched in dressing and was missing enough lettuce to call it an entree. It was more like a side salad size. Hubby had good ribs which is the only reason I  gave them 3 stars."
Rich D.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",5,16,2,4.0,2/19/2015,"It's Chili's, a chain restaurant. You know what you're in for before you ever even enter the place. This one met every expectation. Good, not great, food. But that's what you expect for the $$$. The service was very good, friendly, attentive, and fast. I sat at a table in the bar area just after 9. Was made to feel very welcome. Good experience overall."
Keith S.,"Roseville, CA",1,18,4,4.0,1/20/2016,"I'll start off with the menu selection.  I haven't been to Chiles in 3+ years. It was incredible, along with the old favorites there were many new items. Of course the chips and salsa are something we always go for. Very consistent and delicious. Next was a smokehouse bacon burger with fries. This was cooked perfectly and very delicious. My wife had soup and salad which looked very fresh and the chicken tortilla soup was delicious as well. We also indulged in a Southwest eggrolls, one of our longtime favorites... Brings back memories. Our son(2 1/2)had a grilled cheese sandwich and a large piece of corn, he ate half the sandwich and the whole piece of corn and was very happy. We were greeted at the door and shown our seats there were quite a few people there for 1130 on Wednesday morning but the service was great. Overall this reminded us how much we enjoyed eating at Chili's and will definitely return."
Page W.,"San Jose, CA",107,25,16,5.0,3/7/2016,Top notch service and food is good. What can you expect from chilis? Seriously people. I've never been disappointed.
Erica Q.,"Carmichael, CA",49,54,79,2.0,10/11/2014,"My wife and I usually don't eat at Chili's but, we were given a gift card as a wedding gift. We ate here for lunch last Saturday afternoon. We had to wait way too long at the host stand to be sat. The restaurant was not busy and most of the employees were kind of standing around talking. We had to wait even longer for our server to come to our table once we were sat. The waitress brought me the wrong drink and then forgot about my drink altogether; I had to remind her twice to bring it to me.  The food was well, it's Chili's so, you get what you pay for in service and food apparently. I usually tip at least 20% to servers if I feel they are deserving of it but, I only gave our waitress $1 on a $30 check. Needless to say we will not be going back."
Chris S.,"Rocklin, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/14/2016,"My family (2 adults, 2 children) arrived at this Chilis location at 7:45pm on a Wednesday night, September 14th. We waited at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes, waiting for any of the nearby employees to greet us...we were ignored. We looked around to see if any of the bar tables were open, but the only open tables (3 of them) were dirty. Two servers made eye contact with us, but none greeted us. After a few more minutes of no service we left to eat elsewhere. Horrible customer service...too many better food choices in this area to be treated so poorly here!"
Amanda M.,"Roseville, CA",0,16,2,1.0,1/29/2017,I called and a woman answered to say hold please. Never came back on so I called again for call ahead seating and a guy answered said no wait but we will put your name down. Get there and no name. The greeter seemed to have attitude. Said we will seat you anyway. We sit down to the slowest waiter ever. The entertainment thing on the table isn't working. He finally comes to take our drink order and I asked if he can get chips/guac/salsa out asap since we have a 3 year old at this point having a fit. He brings out our chips and salsa and says guac coming soon. We get our drinks and says that guac is still coming. We eat all the chips and salsa at this point no point in getting guac but it comes no apology or reason why. Than comes our food wilted lettuce on the burger and dry sirloin steak not sure where the meat comes from but it was horrible dry mashed potatoes so I ask for some butter sure enough it comes out later and melted. Wtf?!? Do we not have regular butter? Anyways the service and food in my opinion has gone down hill for sure at this location.
