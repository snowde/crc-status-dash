Joseph N.,"Roseville, CA",1,15,3,4.0,3/12/2016,"We go here at least once a week. The food is consistent and the service is hit and miss, but most of the time it is good. We usually sit in the bar area tables. If you want it a little quieter, be seated in the Resturant area. A new feature to their phone app is ""getting in line"" from your phone. Go try it, download the Chili's app and see, you won't be disappointed."
Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84,4.0,6/14/2014,"Our waitress was very friendly and constantly checked up on use. There was plenty of parking and we were seating immediately. We both ordered the watermelon cooler, which our first waiter assured us was delicious, and he was right. It was sooooo good.  My friend and I ordered the 2 for $20 deal. We got the chips and spinach dip as an appetizer, which was filling and delicious. I ordered the mango chili tilapia with a side salad and my friend ordered the chicken fingers. We were both happy with the taste and portion size. The prices were more than fair."
Dan G.,"Roseville, CA",0,25,3,1.0,7/29/2015,"Horrible service....wasn't busy at all when we came here.  Ordered a couple of appetizers and it took over 45 minutes for them to come out.  Definitely won't be visiting this place anymore, too many other good restaurants to settle for crap service...."
Amanda V.,"Sacramento, CA",14,13,5,1.0,6/23/2015,"So, I rather than a 1 star i'd give a 0 star but apparently we can't do that on here but After swimming at sunsplash we were super hungry and decide to go to chilis and right when we got there a male server approached us and was being super rude. Just because they're going to close in 30 min. It doesn't matter what time you close but when you got people coming into your restaurant and wanting to eat your got to do your job and serve them. I've worked for many restaurants and never have any of the places I've worked at done that to any of their customers. Even if they come in at 9:59pm. Never coming back here again!"
Michelle K.,"Rocklin, CA",5,118,3,2.0,10/23/2015,"This could possibly be the worst meal I've had in a long time. The chicken tacos were overly salty and had way too many flavors going on that were not even palatable. My husband had the chicken bowl, although it looked pretty appealing, I took one bite and it had the same familiar flavors as the tacos. Again, way too salty. We both left our plates nearly full. The waiter asked if we need boxes to go, ""no thanks."" Although the spinach queso dip was good, the chips are too thin to support the dip, making it difficult to eat. Menu has changed since I've been there last and some of the familiar items were missing. Also didn't care much for the tablet check out. I also forgot to mention that my son was playing with the tablet and made game purchases, he is 5! So, parents beware:)"
Shannon T.,"Roseville, CA",17,13,64,4.0,9/9/2014,"RIAN and Nichole in the bar are awesome. Great for Football or any sports . Fast friendly staff. I have a crazy busy life so many times I'm grabbing dinner alone. It's kind a like ""Cheers""where everybody knows and remembers your name. They have a great deal of two for $20 feel like throwing in a cocktail two for $35 you can have healthy or not it's completely up to you. I found that I usually get the best service in the bar. Megan is awesome. They don't deliver but they have a wonderful option where you can call ahead and just sneak in the side door and pick it right up . Now go get yourself a Presidente margarita delicious."
Jessica G.,"Lincoln, CA",0,20,1,1.0,7/20/2014,I've been here a few times. The servers are always friendly but sometimes a bit slow. When we went in tonight it was busy but not crazy busy. We waited at the front to be seated for longer than I think we should have. Our server was nice enough but pretty slow and not the best. Our guac never came but we were charged for it and my chicken sandwich would have been pretty good if the chicken wasn't ice cold.  . I am big about raving for a great place and giving credit where it's due so I hate to give such a harsh review but it is fair.
Ursula O.,"Lincoln, CA",1046,288,720,4.0,6/24/2011,"Let's see, I walked to the front and waited to be seated... but the server in the first isle just stood there looking at me and continued her conversation with the coworker sitting down.  So I sat myself.  Farrin was my server. She was cheerful, friendly, kept up with all her tables while keeping conversations with us all. So thank you, Farrin for making up for your coworkers actions."
Michael M.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/12/2016,My wife and son eat dinner there Monday after Mother's Day she orders the Caribbean chicken salad and they enjoyed the meal. She orders another Caribbean chicken salad to go. When I opened it up when she got home and it's shrimp on the salad thank God I'm not allergic to shrimp oh wait I am allergic to shrimp thanks a lot threw it away.
Ed c.,"Loomis, CA",0,38,,2.0,6/7/2015,This location only. The food is the same as in *any* chili's but the customer services has seriously declined to the point I do not come there anymore.. I think this all started once they put those little tablet looking thing on the tables in a way to market that you no longer need a waiter to service cause this machine with a few taps can get it done the same way. It also forces parents to deal with kids wanting to play games there for a price of an app from itunes.   There is not much wait time...as am sure others feel the same way. What is sad before those table top items the service was actually pretty good and better than most establishments...now they are worse than everyone else. this rating is solely based on this location and does NOT indicate that the quality of chilis food is any different from other chilis cause its basically the same...Its 100% on customer service
Jeff C.,"Lincoln, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/20/2016,"This is not normally my kind of place but work was having a group dinner here.  It was one of the worst meals and experiences I've had in years.  The top-shelf margarita was good while I waited for food and I should have stopped with the margarita.  They have a very broad menu, none of it classic Mexican, but I still tried to choose very simple, hard to get wrong food.  I ordered the wings with a side taco.  Both were inedible.  I thought anyone could pull some wings out of the freezer and drop them in a deep fryer but they were overcooked and tough.  The taco smelled bad and tasted worse.  The floors in the bar and bathrooms were sticky and I didn't really want to think about what the kitchen must look like."
Jenifer P.,"Carmichael, CA",17,5,3,1.0,7/10/2015,"Normally our go to is Chilis and we typically have pleasant experiences but for some reason tonight was the worst service we've ever experienced. We checked in at 8:30pm, on a Friday night, I get you're busy but to not get served dinner until 9:50pm seems a bit extreme. We tried to be patient but after two chip refills and three drink refills we were no longer hungry once our dinner was served. I'm not one to ever not leave a tip but for one meal being three tacos and another meal being shrimp fajitas it's not like it takes an hour to make. We left with two boxes full of food and being full from chips. Defiantly not worth a $35 night out. We work hard for our money and to go out is a privilege that doesn't happen all the time. No wonder the people in back of us walked out after waiting too long. Major disappointment tonight."
Samanths M.,"Sacramento, CA",68,22,40,5.0,6/21/2014,"I've only been here once so far, but it was such a nice experience and I look forward to coming back.The server was awesome and I got some sorta chicken avocado pizza thing that was delicious. I recall commenting on the variety of options on the menu. Zero complaints, I'll be back."
Jess G.,"Roseville, CA",53,56,7,5.0,8/12/2014,Excellent customer service and the food always tastes great! I am never disappointed when I come here!
Carrie V.,"Rocklin, CA",0,10,,1.0,6/30/2016,"Well, we are crossing another Rocklin restaurant off the list!  The last two times we've visited this restaurant, there has been something wrong with our order!  Monday night - the order of sliders were burnt to the crisp and the flatbread pizza also burnt.  Service was very slow and place was only about 1/2 full.  Looks like we will stay with Pete's Brewhouse and Primo's...have never had a bad meal there!"
Shaya Z.,"Rocklin, CA",7,30,1,2.0,4/5/2015,"This Chili's is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. With only going there a few times we had a couple incidents. My mom is vegetarian and we asked for a bean burger, and they ended up bringing a hamburger. My mom had to wait an extra twenty minutes to get the burger. My dad got a hamburger and the meat was red inside. My sister told the waiter that the burger looks like it will get up and go eat some grass outside because it was that undercooked."
Ashley N.,"Roseville, CA",98,70,57,4.0,2/16/2015,"Ok some of these reviews are too harsh. This is a chain restaurant, that is in my opinion , inexpensive. Your not going into this place expecting the best meal you have ever had. That being said I really love this place for a family night out. It's loud so no one is staring at my kids making a bunch of noise, and its pretty cheap to feed a family of 6. I have noticed they revamped the menu over the last few years, and I do like their new menu much more. Also if you make it in for happy hour , you can not beat the price for drinks/apps. I personally love the Presidente Margarita with Texas Cheese Fries. Yum!"
Lena L.,"Rocklin, CA",0,7,7,5.0,5/25/2015,I get take out here all the time.  By far the best chips and salsa I've ever had.  I wouldn't expect that but its true.  I usually order a hamburger and my boyfriend gets ribs.  Both are excellent.  The chicken enchilada soup is great too.  The staff is friendly and fast.  Great experience always.
Eric L.,"Lincoln, CA",5,275,7,1.0,11/18/2013,"4 adults and 2 kids walk into Chili's for lunch... Not a joke here, just a fact.  we were there around lunch time and the place was, at most, half empty.  The food took forever to get to us during the ""lunch rush"".  When our food finally came, my Dad's order of the chicken tacos had the rice still in the bag.  THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID ""IN THE BAG""!!!  frozen rice ""fresh"" out of the microwave.  You want to know why I don't like chains?  This is why, corporate management that detached from the site and frozen food served to you ""fresh"".  The waiter was embarrassed, but not embarrassed enough to take it off the bill or give my Dad a free scoop of ice cream.  I wish I could give negative stars, but 1 is as low as I can go."
Ken C.,"Rocklin, CA",1,6,1,5.0,5/4/2015,"We always get great service at the Roseville Chiles on Fairway Dr.  The staff and food are always great!  Special shout out to Amanda at the Roseville Chile's on Fairway Dr. in Roseville.  The bar area was crowded and she looked to be covering a lot of tables, but did a great job.  She took our order immediately and got our food to us very quickly.  This was on Friday, May 1 at lunch time."
