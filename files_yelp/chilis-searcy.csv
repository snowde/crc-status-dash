Dee W.,"San Rafael, CA",14,12,15,5.0,12/24/2013,The food is typical standard chilis fare but the service was great. I will say that the waitresses needed some help not a manager or busser in site!
Bryan S.,"Mountain Home, AR",13,9,,1.0,12/19/2016,"They microwaved my food for too long, I guess. The tortilla was hard and crusty, and the cheese and beans had burned to the plate (which was unbelievably hot). I mean, if you're going to serve awful food, you could at least know how long to microwave it for."
Heather S.,"Enid, OK",12,16,1,1.0,7/11/2016,"My husband and I ate there yesterday. We both found a hair in our food. Comes to find out they are not required to wear hairnets in the kitchen. Also, the food was very bland and disgusting!! We will not be going back there to eat."
Susan C.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,44,9,2.0,5/24/2015,"For the Most part Chili's is not fine dining, but should consistent with the rest of the chain. This one is however horrible, sorry guys, our food was lost, then burnt to a crisp, on our fajitas. Just yuck all the way around. And seriously are there really still dry counties?? YES, Searcy, so keep on a rolling to the next town. I so needed a drink Bahahahaa"
Jana B.,"Shasta Lake, CA",14,37,47,1.0,10/18/2015,"Ugh. We have always wanted to try Chili's,  I wish we had tried it somewhere else besides Searcy. They were busy but the host cleaned a table for us pretty quickly.  Too quickly actually, there were CHUNKS of food still on it. I'm pretty sympathetic to busy servers and bussers so I wiped them off with my napkin. Our server was really friendly and got our drink order right away. My hubby ordered the Sirloin medium well and I ordered the Rib Steak medium rare. Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  About 35 minutes later we got our food. The server said she would be right back with a missing side dish of mashed potatoes, then left.  The first thing I noticed was my husband's plate. It had obviously sat on the cook line for a long time. Juice from his steak was dried on the plate and the Broccoli was wilted and dry, the steak was shriveled and dry... yuck! Then I looked at my steak. The cook committed a cardinal sin, he had made a big cut in my steak to check the temp. This is the mark of someone who shouldn't be on the broiler. You never cut a hot steak to check the temp, send that guy back to training! Because the steak was cut on the broiler, it bled, then the server left our food sitting forever. What I got was a well done, dry, ruined $18 dollar plate. Hot lights on the line only keep food warm for 5 minutes, our plates were probably in the window for 15 minutes. We let the server know when she finally came back with our missing side dish. She apologized, sent the manager over (all this time the mgr was on the floor bussing and didn't notice a table waiting that long for food...?). The manager offered to replace the dishes but we were so hungry we declined and went to Sonic, got a couple of dogs and went to our hotel. The managers approach was super smooth, like she's so used to saying the words, it's automatic. The cooks here need to be trained, they're cooking with no clue. The server who also messed up was very quick to blame the kitchen. This place is a hot mess, I'll try a different Chili's sometime,  but never again in Searcy."
Tammy T.,"Searcy, AR",0,8,,2.0,7/13/2016,"Ok so 10 of us went to Chilis last night to celebrate a friends BD. Want to say first off that the server (Donovan)was awsome. We joked around with him the whole time and he just laughed and kept doing a great job. But let me tell you about the bad part of this visit!! When we sat down he told us first off there was a few things they were out of (mind you on a slow Tuesday night!!! ) In all It ended up being 6 items and those items were   pasta, fish, chili, sour cream sauce, kiwi and they were out of hamburger buns but he informed us they ran to McDonalds and borrowed buns from them!!! Of course at that point we just burst out laughing and joked about how  we could just order a Big Mac now !!! Seriously come on someone is dropping the ball here!!!!! We could have understood if it had been a couple things on a very busy weekend night but just shocked that those many items we not available on a Tue night and it was slow on top of that.  Ok on to the food part: 3 of us ordered the southwest egg rolls can't mess up there!! 2 of us ordered steak and needless to say I won't ever order a steak there , whoever the cook is needs to be trained on what is med-rare!! That does not mean WELL DONE!!!!! most of all the other stuff that was ordered was fried or salads so in general if you just order something simple and of course if they even have it!!!!! you should be ok!!!"
Dale R.,"Little Rock, AR",155,239,113,2.0,1/5/2014,There are so few choices in Searcy for decent food we bit the bullet and came back. Either here or McDonald's. I have never been to a Chili's anyplace in the US that has such consistent poor service and poor food. A lesson learned finally. Drive the 45 minutes to another city. Even the free chips and salsa for a foursquare check in wasn't worth the price. The salsa is straight out of a can. One extra star because this place was closer than Little Rock or Cabot
Matthew F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",435,84,,3.0,8/3/2013,"Passed over the Chilis on my roadtrip from Nashville, TN back home to Los Angeles. My girlfriends sister works there. Pretty much the same quality of food as all the Chilis ive been to."
Chuck C.,"Vernon, CT",116,190,3,1.0,7/30/2011,"Pass over this Chili's. We've been coming to this restaurant for about a year now, since we've moved to Searcy. There isn't much else to do in Searcy besides going to Chili's. The food has been getting progressively worse, and finally, we decided that it is worth the trip to Conway or Little Rock when we go out to eat. The kitchen carelessly overseasons, and you cannot find a good plate on the menu. The manager is great, and he gave us a coupon for the next visit, but it just didn't get any better. The service is a mixed bag. There is one waitress that is perfect, while the rest are far below standard. I'd advise skipping past Searcy to eat in a larger town with more options."
Whitney B.,"Heber Springs, AR",73,2,,5.0,12/6/2010,All my friends and family love Chili's every time we go out of town we always have to stop. I've always have had good service and quick. The food is always hot and fresh. Some night we travel 30 minutes to the closest Chili's just to eat dinner and come back home. LOVE LOVE LOVE CHILI'S!!!
