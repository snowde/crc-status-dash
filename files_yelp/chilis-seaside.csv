Naomi J.,"Seaside, CA",63,44,16,5.0,10/26/2017,"I may be biased because I grew up on this restaurant, but Chili's can do no wrong in my book. I love their promotions, from their frequent email discounts to their 2 for $20 back in the day.  Appetizers: I have tried almost every appetizer on the menu and they are all spectacular, except for I wish there were some bread/fried-free options. Their guacamole is almost as good as Chipotle's, and the southwestern egg rolls and Texas cheese fries are unhealthy and outstanding.  Food: Their honey chicken crispers are full of flavor and crunch, their house side salad is superior to most side salads that I have tried, their molten chocolate lava cake is worth melting for, their mango chicken manages to be tender and juicy (and a little too small), and the chicken tortilla soup I just can't get enough of (also incredibly salty, so can't get enough water either). The only thing I have ever tried there that I don't absolutely love is their ribs - could be juicier and more tender. Drinks: Chili's drinks are affordably priced and far more delicious than most places I have been to. If you don't like your drinks to be that strong, I think their margaritas and coolers are refreshing and fun. This restaurant consistently reminds me that I want everything on the menu."
Kyle C.,"Monterey, CA",108,25,4,1.0,12/11/2017,"It has been a long time since I've felt this kind of disappointment from any restaurant. My girlfriend and I were out on a date night and decide to try Chili's out instead of our usual spot. What a mistake we made. The wait time for a slow night was 10 minutes and as soon as we got seated we decided to order, thinking that we might be here for a while. Our server promptly apologized for the wait and said he would take care of us. After receiving our  appetizer we waited 20 minutes for 2 identical orders of ribeye steak. During the wait another server who was acquaintances with my lady, sat down in our booth and overstayed her welcome. The steaks were served and she kept sitting st our table! How unprofessional can you be? Both steaks were ordered the same but we're cooked completely different. We waited for our server to come back to inquire about it and he was no where to be found for 15 minutes. We decided to try eating them to see if we were just tripping, and we weren't. I decided to eat as much as I could because I was about to pay $20 for it and at this point, felt like nothing we would say is gonna make a difference to this establishment. I haven't felt that uncomfortable in a long time. Don't waste your time here."
Bonsai T.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2017,"Man what a disappointment! I just started working in an office close-by. Phone option for pick up orders #2 kept dropping my call.  Girl at bar was pleasant on phone and took my order. SALAD!...was not ready when I got there.  Sat for what seemed like forever. Notified staff that my lunch break was coming to and end. $22.67 for a coke, Southwestern Chicken Salad and Cauliflower Appetizer plus 12% tip. Got to my car, started eating appetizer....soggy. Got to the stoplight, coke was flat! Opened to peek at the salad, chicken was cold. Got to work, salad was mostly a shallow bed of brown wilted iceberg.  Never seen so much rotten lettuce in a served salad! Absolutely NO avocado as advertised in the picture. Reluctantly ate a chicken strip, cold and rubbery. Got into my second chicken strip, stared down and spotted a fly! If I get ill shortly I will be calling to complain officially. According to the other comments on Yelp, management doesn't much care. It's too bad. I had such high hopes when they first came.  It was good when it first opened!  Will not be ordering there again, my co-workers were horrified when they saw the fly!"
Sanchez R.,"Seaside, CA",0,11,2,1.0,1/5/2018,"Avoid this location. I was served by a server named Kelsie and she was so rude. I received one of the worst services ever, seriously. I don't care if you had a bad day, you should be professional at any circumstance. You're serving people, you need to be a little more friendly to customers. Please read this and change it. I used to like this location, but after being served by this server I changed my mind.  Avoid this place, also I got food poison after eating their Smokehouse Combo, disgusting. Please consider to check how cooks do their food procedures because after reading so many reviews I can see that their is a problem with the way this location is serving their food."
Nathaniel S.,"West Fresno, Fresno, CA",25,11,,4.0,12/15/2017,Simply delicious. I found my favorite dishes here. The staff were fine and delightful.
Sam T.,"Reno, NV",0,10,,4.0,12/11/2017,"Derrick is a wonderful waiter- attentive, responsible, and personable. He's always on it with orders and such. The food is pretty consistently great, even if they forget to switch out my broccoli for corn on the cob (which they brought way later anyhow). That being said, the remaining staff did not strike me as particularly great tonight. The runners forgot the chips we ordered, brought drinks pretty late, and nearly threw the entrees down (I get the plates were hot, but seriously?) All the same- we'll come back."
Mr L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",10,194,98,3.0,3/10/2017,"The food is pretty much what you'd expect. The music was John Mellencamp. Rufus. Queen. Tom Petty. I ordered the ribeye. The cut wasn't as good as an expensive steakhouse but it was fine. My waitress Sarah was fast and friendly. Checked on me twice and told me my food was coming right up. Service was better than the food. They have ziosk, a kiosk at the table where you can pay your bill. Pretty cool. Saves time."
Izzie M.,"Monterey, CA",191,11,,4.0,11/18/2017,The staff is always so nice and I hate to admit it but I adore Chili's and they always seem to remember us when my friends and I come in. They are flexible in their menu items. I have never come to this restaurant and had to wait for more than a couple of minutes for a table!
Brooke K.,"Moss Landing, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,"The food is average, but the one star goes to the employees and management. I've been to this chilis quite a few times and I keep hoping for a more pleasant experience. I've now had two waiters that were extremely rude and had no knowledge regarding their own menu. The waiter today told me I could read the menu myself if I wanted to know the happy hour deals. When I read the menu and decided what I wanted, the waiter told me my government issued ID was not a valid form of identification. Sadly, when I spoke with the manager, he told me too bad and I was welcome to eat somewhere else. I am extremely unimpressed with the lack of simple human kindness at this Chilis and I truly hope this does not reflect the organization as a whole."
Timothy P.,"Salinas, CA",2,17,26,5.0,10/3/2017,"One of our favorite restaurants. Burgers, Ribs, Corn on the Cob, Mashed Potatoes, Broccoli, we always find something great here."
Maribel M.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,9/13/2017,"I've had a pleasant time at this location every time. All the waiters have been great and I've had a few different ones. The food is very consistent which is good because when I get the same thing every time I want it to taste as great as before. The menu changes occasionally. They should add more pasta dishes but hey, that is just me. The bacon cheeseburger is my go to. Can't go wrong with it if you're undecided."
Kristian C.,"Monterey, CA",183,122,444,2.0,3/28/2016,"Man, the TV commercials always get me. The food looks SOO good. Then you get there and the menus make the food look delicious, then your food comes... The let down. This is a quick and easy place to get decent food. Not great, not trash, but decent. I guess one doesn't come here for fine dining, or excellent service. But for a quick, semi clean, open late, place to talk, eat, and relax.  Best part of Chili's is the chips and salsa. Ever since Chevy's closed in Salinas we can not find hot, thin, crispy tortilla chips. Every other place serves thick, cold chips. Not here, thin, hot, and tasty. Give'em a try! Enjoy!"
Brenda B.,"Marina, CA",17,32,40,4.0,7/3/2017,"Okay went there Saturday order the beef burrito it was very good my friend ordered the surf and turf they enjoyed it. service can be slow as usual sometimes makes me wonder who I have to.... to get the attention for just a glass of water, but this is Chiles, It's not the Taj Mahal okay!! it comes in handy when you need a bite to eat."
HeyItsNatalia 8.,"Soledad, CA",28,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,"So i was brought moldy food at this restaurant. Then when i brought it up with the manager he made me feel like i was the one in the wrong. He was so rude and unprofessional. As if i was the one offering him moldy food. Then just for kicks, he made us pay for said moldy food. I will never go here again."
andrew s.,"Marina, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/30/2017,"***FOOD POISONING ALERT***  I had dinner at Chili's in Seaside on March 23, 2017 and became violently ill after eating a chicken bacon avocado sandwich. This restaurant it's run and staffed by teenagers who are unfamiliar with safe food handling principles and practices. If you become ill after eating at Chili's contact their risk management department at area code 972-770-8807 and file a complaint. Furthermore, you may also submit all of your medical records and bills for reimbursement."
Boon D.,"Visalia, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/23/2017,We ordered online for pick up and it said it'll take 24 minutes. My husband went to pick up and it took him over an hour to get the food. Reason was because they said they were waiting for the grilled asparagus and of course there wasn't any grilled asparagus. We got charged for something we didn't get. We got beans and rice instead of our order grilled asparagus and beans. The shrimp tacos was cold to where the tortillas was stale. All the food was cold when my husband got back to the hotel room.  I would not recommend dining or online pick up at this Chilis.
Johnathon W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/24/2017,"My roommate and I discovered our love for Chilis one Thursday night 5 weeks ago when we came in for some apps and drinks in the bar. Jessenia made us feel super welcome,even though the bar was busy, and told us about the 5 dollar presidenté margaritas every Thursday. Since then we've been every Thursday! We love their steak fajitas and we love the drinks and service. Javi has been running our food for the past few visits and he's always on point! Our last time here the manager, James gave us some tips on how to make great Mexican rice like we get with the fajitas! Always a great experience!"
Catherine M.,"Hollister, CA",7,7,9,1.0,8/8/2017,"Called at 2:30pm to make a same-day reservation for 15 people for 6:30 and was told that 6:30 is their peak hours and cannot accommodate us at that time but if we come in at 6, they'll have a table for us. We got there at 5:45 and was told they gave the table to someone else. Spoke to a supervisor and he said ""that the morning supervisor made a mistake...sorry"". I've never worked in a food Industry before but maybe...maybe next time before you blame your other supervisor, do something about it instead putting blame on others."
Yolanda M.,"Salinas, CA",22,8,,4.0,4/23/2017,Service was great..waitress was very attentive. .she made sure are cups were filled and napkins replenished.  Food was very good..appetizers came out quick and were nice and hot.  Main courses were good..steak was tender..cooked perfectly medium rare.  Ribs were not as tasty..they tasted steamed then a brush of bbq sauce.  Veggies great... mashed potatoes were decent.
Richi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,212,188,4.0,12/16/2016,The ambiance and service was good. Ordered the chicken burrito that was delicious but the appetizer combo with fried pickles just soggy and overly salty.
Winona B.,"Orange, CA",36,21,14,3.0,11/22/2016,"My friends and I came in at lunch to see that the place was busy, but we were seated right away. Our server was very patient and kind about my friends and I finding ourselves a little undecided on the menu, which I appreciated. Overall the experience here felt a bit average, though. The highlight was that our server tended to us really well without being overbearing, but the food wasn't terribly special or bad at all. There were also a lot of staff just waiting around and making small chat with each other which was a little unusual to see.  If you're looking for just anywhere to eat with a typical restaurant chain setting and food quality, this place fits the bill."
Shante G.,"Vallejo, CA",167,41,76,1.0,11/16/2016,I got a message back from the company but I can't seem to find the way to contact them back. Hmmmm..... address that was given is not working!
Heather A.,"Redding, CA",15,124,25,2.0,7/27/2016,"I am a HUGE Chili's fan, but this Chili's disappointed.  Service very slow...  Management very inconsiderate & sadly they couldn't cook my husband's egg over-easy. Received the burger & the egg was cooked hard, asked for another hamburger, with the egg over-easy, fourteen minutes later, received the meal, with the egg, again, cooked hard..... Bit of a bummer for the family meal!"
Nadia M.,"Novato, CA",7,43,317,2.0,6/19/2016,Costumer service is OK. Needs too much improvement. Food looked frozen or cold. Worst experience
Cody H.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,3,3,2.0,4/21/2017,"Had the caribbean shrimp salad. Frozen shrimp, too much pepper. Even double dressing not enough to bring the salad to life!"
Amy L.,"Monterey, CA",35,44,7,2.0,12/20/2016,"I'm a busy working mom. There aren't many places my kids like and Chilis makes that coveted list. Every single time I try to place an order online, the app says I can't place my order online and to call. Every single time I've called, they've either completely butchered my order or ""couldn't hear"" when I had perfect signal and I heard almost no background noise. So my suggestion might be to buy a phone that works or fix your website. Because I got that MILF money and sometimes mama doesn't wanna cook."
Kelley S.,"Chicago, IL",75,463,104,3.0,1/16/2016,"Chili's is a chili's is a chili's... that's what chains are all about right?  Consistent food under one name....  makes it reliable but also somewhat boring. For that reason we only come here on ""special"" occasions... i.e. when military can get a free meal :)   Our server was good, the food was as expected and the place was packed."
M A H.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/10/2017,"Worst meal ever at a Chili's restaurant. Lettuce old, fajitas straight from refrigeration-- pan not heated, begs uncooked."
Cin G.,"Seaside, CA",4,39,163,1.0,4/16/2016,"I really want this Chilis to be good. Its so close to home and stays late. But... Its always a miss.  9pm - close weekday happy hour for drinks and appetizers. Texas cheese fries and buffalo wings were OK, probably the only thing that isn't ever messed up. My pasta was very dry. Chiken was blah.  My friends steak came out while she had to wait a few minutes for her side?!? What the heck Slowest service I have probably ever received.  We ate our food and once finished we still chatted for about 40 minutes waiting ... While our server was MIA. Went to grab a quick bite with a friend and ended up being the last people here. We just wanted to wrap up and head out.  Why can't this place be better."
Nicole K.,"Oakton, VA",263,114,50,4.0,4/29/2015,"Chain restaurants tend to be the same - lack luster food with average service.  This Chili's (and their new menu) took that expectation and threw it out the window.   I was in Monterey for the Big Sur marathon and this restaurant was conveniently next to my hotel (Embassy Suites) - and while I typically look for a more 'local' place, this was so convenient and I was tired from a long flight.  The wait at Chili's was less than a couple minutes and my friend and I were sat in a booth.   The restaurant was full with runners and the bar was packed.  We ordered two skinny margaritas from the bar and only had to wait a few minutes before we got our drinks.  Let me just say, the skinny margaritas are delicious and do not taste 'lite' at all!  We even asked if they were accidentally made w/ regular mix!    For our dinner we both opted for the fajitas.  I got the steak and shrimp, and my friend got the chicken and shrimp.  The fajitas came w/ 3 tortillas and a slew of toppings on the side (spicy sour cream, jalapeños, salsa, guacamole, cheese) and a huge helping of shrimp, steak, and veggies (onions / peppers).   The shrimp was good and perfectly cooked.  The steak was a tad tough, but had decent flavor.   The price for 2 dinners and 4 drinks was under $70!   Good value and good food for a chain restaurant."
Cathy P.,"Portland, OR",464,382,5,4.0,2/21/2015,"We had some shopping to do in Seaside yesterday and wanted a quick, semi-healthy lunch (like salads) and happened upon Chili's. I've had a few bad experiences with a Chili's at another location and was a little leery of trying it again. Apparently, like Applebee's, they have really revamped their menu and that's a good thing! We opted to sit in the bar since it looked relatively quiet - no kids - and mostly empty. There were lots of TV's turned to various sports venues and our waitress greeted us very quickly, took our drink orders (iced tea) and left us to peruse the extensive menu. There were the usual suspects: appetizers, salads, chili (of course), burgers, wraps, sandwiches, ribs...you get the picture.  Being sometimes fans of Chipotle's rice bowls, the Chili's version caught our attention. I decided on the Margarita Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice, topped with house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a perfect drizzle of margarita sauce. I added chicken to mine and didn't get any tortilla strips but they weren't missed. Not bad at all! My husband ordered the hotter Chipotle Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice & chipotle pesto. His was topped with cheddar cheese, house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a drizzle of cumin-lime sour cream. He also added chicken to his. Both were a little under $10 and just the right amount of food. Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and gave us just the right amount of attention. Also like Applebee's, there is that gadget contraption on the table you can ""play"" with but I mainly ignored it ---- until it was time to pay the bill. Our waitress encouraged us to use the thing, so not wanting to be labeled an old curmudgeon, I swiped my debit card, added the tip (got tricked into taking a survey) and printed out my receipt. It was painless really, but is the future for all restaurants? I hope not. Anyway, Chili's has renewed my respect for the brand. Not that I'll be a regular customer but at least I won't have the negative view of them any longer."
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,238,348,2.0,2/23/2016,"High levels of chlorine in the tap water. You can taste it in the iced tea too. Monterey Peninsula is known for high levels of chlorine in there water and seaside establishments are the worst in my opinion. If you order a soda, alcohol or something not made with water, you will be good.  The food is decent for a chain restaurant; Chilis. I usually have to send it back most of the time because it's cold or not well made.  Just kind of thrown together. The steak has been cold before :|  The Chips and salsa- the chips should always be hot. Always hot. This is not the case most of the time. Like the heater is off in the chip dispenser or something. Friendly staff but just not quite ""on it"" most of the time. We come in and usually wait in the waiting area for about 3 minutes before a hostess arrives despite the bar tenders and other servers looking at us. We are not a priority and they are not very attentive usually.  To avoid disappointment, I order the Buffalo Chicken salad without pico and I add the corn salsa which is a nice addition. It's a very tasty salad and I'm not ever disappointed with it. That's a good safe play."
Danielle M.,"Salinas, CA",1,51,21,1.0,7/24/2016,Food is horrible every time.  Service is a hit or miss.  I think the only reason we come back is the Lemonade and the spinach queso and endless chips.  It's nice you can get points to get free things.  Especially since their food isn't good.  I feel the chili's in Salinas does a little better on food quality but really they are the same.  No taste in food and everything has a southern mexican tex mex taste.
Dan A.,"Monterey, CA",3,106,25,3.0,1/29/2016,Chain is a chain. But this one has great customer service. Good food. Love the improvements inside. Feels more roomy. Love the big mouth bites. Everything is just good here. I with that still had the football and baseball memorabilia above the door.
Andy S.,"Fresno County, CA",4,36,42,1.0,2/20/2016,"Horrible!!!!!  I've been to MANY child's around the state and this is by far the WORST!!!  Our salad came out with 10 leafs of spinach and that's it!!! It's like they were trying to save on lettuce. Awe aske to speak to the manager- he accused us of ""eating"" the lettuce. When we told him the food was subpar, he said ""well, I have nothing to say to about the food coming out like that"".  The manager offered no resolution. Go to any restaurant other than here."
Melissa N.,"Monterey, CA",7,99,169,5.0,3/23/2016,"always taken in right away when i come in, food comes out quick, and i always get the same food which is the cajun pasta& honey chipotle crispers . p.s: customer service is great"
Chris J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,34,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Just so everyone knows, the comment being posted by Chili's on several bad reviews are nonsense.  It's just a way to make them seem concerned without actually doing anything.  The ""feedback"" link they post doesn't work.  Click on it yourself.  Avoid this Chili's like the plague!"
R S.,"Monterey, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/23/2016,Going down hill fast. Day manager from about a month ago is not into customer service. Had hair in my meal and waitress was great and took it back but we were put in the end of the que. all of our other meals were eaten and table was cleared by bus person like it should be and finally the hairless meal was served. We told them to take it back as we were done. Mgr came out and we asked him why we weren't put into the order que a little quicker. No answer. Gave us some gift certificates   He was not friendly as I think he could of been. Not dressed professionally. Maybe he was the cook also
Julia R.,"Las Vegas, NV",286,3,,5.0,6/2/2017,"Great service, great food! We got there a little early, and one younglady was greeting, seating and serving in the bar, and she was awesome! She kept her smile going and made everyone comfortable and welcomed. We tried the new chix n waffles and fried asparagus, would highly recommend them to anyone! (Grear flavors)Definitely going back"
Olivia D.,"Watsonville, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/13/2017,"This place was disappointing. I usually go to one closer to home which never disappoints.  I ordered a blue pacific (my usual) I got one that wasn't made right it wasn't drinkable I sent it back. The bartender was in no hurry to replace my drink I watched her chatting with a customer by the time I got my replacement drink I was finished with my appetizer, the second drink wasn't much better & our waitress made the drink while the bartender chatted. Nonetheless I received my replacement drink over 10 minutes later during a time the bar area was not that busy and the food was less than average"
