Diego S.,"Monterey, CA",314,131,9,2.0,4/13/2012,The food was cook and very salty. The service was very slow. It's getting worse every time.
Rafal H.,"Newark, CA",2,2,,1.0,12/30/2013,"Guys, if you happen to visit Monterey more as a tourist - enjoy the beach and great views and ..... avoid Chillis. Food is greasy, heavy and makes you feel unhealthy just by how it looks. Eventhough my pick up came 15 minutes , they still missed one order and half of meals were already cold. Time on such a great coast deserves something better. I know it is a chain, but still ...."
Stacy A.,"Brea, CA",45,26,27,1.0,11/23/2013,"This Chili's gives others a bad name and I don't like Chili's to begin with. Dirty tables, cold food.. I've had a host of problems here. Even using Chili's To Go service, my husband and I have had bad experiences. We are definitely not returning to this Chili's again."
Alex R.,"La Mesa, CA",31,10,1,2.0,6/6/2014,"Open late...only good thing about this place. Service sucks, the food is horrible, and I can't get a drink that doesn't taste like dish water. Bar tender seems nice enough but the restaurant is understaffed and unoriginal.  Sure, certain entrees are good, like the Monterey Chicken, but avoid food along the lines of nachos and fajitas. I'd recommend going about anywhere else for food and coming here for a end of the night beer or two. Again, the staff seems nice but the franchise needs some work."
Ginger C.,"Monterey, CA",2,17,35,4.0,4/24/2014,"Went here several years ago and was disappointed. Loved the one in Scottsdale, AZ!  Now they have a new manager and what a difference! Try the burger small bites...fabulous little delectable burgers ( added avocado...mmmmm). Unbelievable Triple Dipper for $10.59... More than enough for two people. I chose 2 Big Mouth Bites, loaded potatoes and the hot spinach artichoke dip with HOT fresh chips!  Service was fast friendly and accommodating (I wanted a booth in a closed section).  We will be back!"
Jackie A.,"Monterey, CA",0,35,34,4.0,5/29/2014,Great service! Love the chicken sandwich with a side of ranch dressing! Kids love the mac and cheese made by Kraft! Plus the mash potatoes are great!
Ivy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,157,310,5.0,5/20/2012,"Monterey County and Chili's are quickly becoming 2 favorite places of mine xD I haven't ate at a Chili's restaurant since the early 2000's. Since I heard the service wasn't as good anymore, I avoided the trouble altogether and took my food to go. No regrets at all!  Even though I had to wait a grilling 20 mins for my food, it beat waiting in line 45 mins to be seated in the noisy, (predominately kid) crowded restaurant. My food was WONDERFUL. I intended to get some pictures for you yelpers, but after the first bite, I was unstoppable! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich and was delighted to find that no only was the chicken juicy, but it was bigger than the bun itself!! Just writing about it is making my mouth water =P  People, if you suspect (any) restaurant may be filthy or lines may be long, take your food to go! It's not a sin! I strive to enjoy my food as much as possible, and won't hesitate to eat my meal elsewhere if I have to. I don't know about other peeps, but I'm not about to wait in a long line or listen to 2 hours of screaming kids when I eat."
Christopher S.,"Salinas, CA",121,39,1,5.0,8/5/2015,Service was great. Have not been here in a long time. Macie was our server and she was so nice and friendly. Food came out hot and refills were right in time.
albert r.,"Quantico, VA",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2013,"My worst Chili's experience, ever. Bad service from the hostess and server. Cold and bland tasting food. Over and under cooked steak. Save your time and money, stay away from this place. I recommend going to LaLa Grill.  The story.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews, but I feel especially compelled to write this one. Came for dinner with my family on Friday, Aug.16, at approximately 9:30pm. Had not been to this Chili's restaurant in Seaside in over 2yrs. I have had great dining experiences at other Chili's locations I've been to so far; usually ordering the classic sirloin steak. We walk in and are met by the hostess. We inquire about their Happy Hour, asking, ""what time does your happy hour end?"" The hostess did not know this basic information and tells us so. So we ask her, ""is there maybe someone you could ask?"" She asks a nearby coworker who also does not know. The hostess turns back to us with a blank look on her face and again tells us that she does not know. She then stares at us for several seconds rather than find the answer to our simple question. I say in my head, ""well, go find the answer!"" My sister takes initiative and walks over to a table, picks up a menu and locates the information in less than 15sec.  We were seated with no wait time. I looked around, and noticed the place seemed unusually slow for a restraunt on a Friday night.  I ordered the classic sirloin steak, cooked to medium (pink in the middle), w/ mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and Texas toast. My wife ordered the same meal as I, except she ordered her steak cooked medium-rare w/ no Texas toast. We waited 17min. for our food. It did not arrive hot and my food was pretty bland. My steak was cooked practically to well done as there was was very-very little pink left. It looked like shoe leather. My wife's steak was cooked to medium and there was toast on her plate.  I showed my steak to the waitress and she returned it to the kitchen. While I waited, I went onto Yelp to check the reviews for this place and it only had 2.5 stars out of 69 reviews, highlighting horrible service and cold food. 7min later she brings my plate back. My steak was cooked to med-rare this time.  Not wanting to send my food back a third time in fear of them tampering with it, I cut my losses and started to eat. Everything on my plate was Luke warm. The steak was undercooked and unflavorful. The mashed potatoes were decent but cold. The broccoli  and Texas toast was also bland and cold. I will not patron or recommend this restaurant (Chili's in Seaside, Ca) to anyone in the future.  Recommendations for this restaurant to improve their customers experience: Train all employees on general knowledge of the menu. Train servers and especially hosts on politeness and professional courtesy. Train kitchen staff on proper cooking time/temperatures for meats. Employ more experienced chefs to run the kitchen.  Employ a supervisor to oversee, instruct and improve employees' work performances."
Jason H.,"Monterey, CA",3,8,4,5.0,5/23/2014,"Came here to have a beer and watch some Oakland Athletics baseball. Bartender was awesome and put the game on the TV closest to me, staff was friendly and the IPA was cold. Good experience."
Sarah A.,"Merced, CA",6,86,6,4.0,2/2/2014,"Chilis is one of those restaraunts you go to because everyone in your party agrees its ok (not the best, it's ok). This Chilis is like every other one I've ever been to. It's clean, service is a bit slow - though they are very busy, and the food is fine. Done."
Jessamyn W.,"Oakland, CA",161,524,165,2.0,2/22/2012,"The service here is AWFUL. I was there with some friends for almost 2 hours. THe restaurant was crowded tonight, which seems slightly unusual since it's in the middle of the week. But then again, it is near the Embassy Suites. THis place is also crawling with kids. Noisy kids. Whey my friends and I were finally directed toward a table, it was filthy. Even after it was wiped off, it still felt sticky. Meanwhile, the floor under our table was filthy. The food was pretty decent though. It's a good thing I hardly ever go here..."
Mike L.,"Seaside, CA",35,151,87,3.0,4/11/2011,"Let me first say that I absolutely hate when people preface their thoughts with the ever ubiquitous, ""It's a chain"" disclaimer, almost like it automatically connotes that the food is going to be bad.   There's nothing wrong with ""chain"" food, some of the most successful businesses are, YOU GUESSED IT, chains.  This is especially true in the restauraunt industry.  Working in the local financial sector, I know that aside from select car dealerships, Chili's brings in more tax increment than almost any other business in Seaside, which only benefits the local economy. As a work-in-progress society, it seems the ""cool"" thing to do is revolt against big business, regardless of the industry and spread anti-corporation sentiment as far as the eye can see.  Get over it, there's a reason these businesses are lauded, they know what they're doing. With that said, being that it's a ""chain"", you already know what to expect when you walk into the place.   The walls are saturated with Tex-Mex decor, the lighting is dim and overall the environment is pretty relaxed.   As others have correctly stated, the food is just alright, well...aside from the White Molten Cake, which is probably one of the best dessert items ever created! Chili's gets a three because the food quality and the service are inconsistent.  At times, the food is very good.  Other times, not so much.  At times, the service is on point.  Other times, not so much.  Chili's is hit or miss and if you don't mind occasional lackluster service, then give it a shot."
Seaside living s.,"Aptos, CA",1,51,24,1.0,4/10/2011,"Took my teen here a couple weekends back.   There were maybe 10 people in the place at lunch on a Sunday, so we were seated right away. Noticed right away it didn't look very clean - floor dirty & dirty tables not cleared.  Teen ordered the shrimp taco & ended up eating a little of the rice & picking out a couple shrimp, which were pronounced awful.   My chicken taco was dry, tasteless, & the tortillas were dry beyond belief.   We couldn't wait to get the bill & leave.   A complete waste of time & $35.  We will never, ever go back."
Gene G.,"Monterey, CA",1,19,,1.0,5/31/2013,"Chilis was a regular event for my family but then we noticed an extra $10 added to the tip. I spent the last few months dealing with managers, customer support, corporate office and no one will admit the problem or help fix it. I won't go there again. Letting waiters run a crime ring is not a good thing at all!!"
Jason M.,"Seaside, CA",5,13,,4.0,3/25/2012,"I went tonight during March Madness and expected terrible service, long lines, and a crowd. I sat at the bar and the bartender, Briana, was very customer-friendly. She refilled my waters extremely fast, got my order right on the first time, and was very friendly. The food was good. I ordered a 6oz steak and Margherita chicken breast, and they were both done perfectly. The sides of broccoli and mashed potatoes were just fine. If you're staying at one of the nearby hotels or are just looking for Chili's fare, this place is pretty solid.  No cons that I can think of, but if a store manager is reading this, it would be great if they expanded the selection of beers on draft, as it appeared they only had 4 or 5 :)"
Jeana M.,"West Linn, OR",13,2,,1.0,3/26/2015,Awful service. Awful bartenders. Messed up a simple White Russian. Food was so so   Will never go back to this location. Ever.
Mark W.,"Fort Hood, TX",36,178,116,4.0,3/1/2009,"I'm a big fan of Chili's - especially for their boneless buffalo wings (my makeshift Hooters replacement).  We've been several times and usually have no issues with service or food. We ordered Chilis-to-go lately though and had a different experience.  The food was ""warm"", no sauce of the wings - and they looked they'd been sitting under a heat lamp. So - Good for eating in - i'm hesitant to order to go...."
T R.,"Seaside, CA",1,22,,5.0,5/3/2014,"The food is mediocre like most Chilis restaurants. We always get excellent, quick service. They have new touchscreen monitors at the tables where you can now order more drinks, appetizers, and/or deserts. You can also pay without waiting on the receipt.  We loved it!"
Richard C.,"Monterey Park, CA",88,27,6,2.0,4/25/2013,Typicall Chili's. I only came here to use my gift card. Fajitas trio are mediocre...precut and warmed pieces yet mine were cold on arrival. The servers attitude when I brought it to her attention was not impressive to say the least. Watered down beer as usual. Oh well. At least ny boy enjoyed his ribs. He just doesn't know any better yet. They looked very unappetizing. Plenty of good places around the area. Do yourself a favor and skip the chain restaurants while in the Monterey area.
