Kellee C.,"Pebble Beach, CA",35,57,51,4.0,9/16/2013,"We've always had pretty good service here. The food is consistently good and fast. The hostesses could work on being a little nicer, but not a big deal. Overall it's a good place to eat."
Dre J.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,1,2.0,11/28/2014,"Overall, my lasting impression from this most recent and last visit to this chain, is that they use WAYYYY to much salt. The server attempted to be pleasant but was quite clearly lacking in support and had too many tables to handle (which is not her fault!). However, even the speediest and most amazing service would not have compensated for the abundance of salt in every item we ordered."
Samantha G.,"Monterey, CA",26,4,,2.0,12/18/2013,I've been to Chiles many of times with friends and every time I go it's packed and when your waiting for your table there is not a lot of room to wait. They should have a locals menu for the locals or happy hour. They need more staff and more lighting in there cause you can barley see your food
John H.,"Poplar Grove, IL",0,50,4,5.0,2/27/2013,Great service and great food at a great price. I had a coupon that expired before and they still accepted it and were really friendly.
Lenny G.,"Monterey, CA",119,9,9,1.0,5/6/2012,"Very disappointed on their way of checking for IDs I understand that it's the law to be 21 and over to consume alcohol but were does it say that you have to posses a CA ID in order to consume alcohol, some people are not from CA and will like to drink and we have to go to another place and consume.  The manager at this chilis it's very discriminatory and rude about his new rule, the servers and bartenders are very nice and they are sad to implement this absurd rule.  If you like chilis, sad to say go to another chilis since this rule only applies to the one in seaside, near Embassy Suites."
Tylor M.,"Seaside, CA",39,94,3,3.0,3/22/2011,"Just alright.  The food was pretty good, but a little too rich and ""chain-restauranty.""  Living on the peninsula has raised my food standards a bit and this place just doesn't do it for me anymore. Considering the place wasn't that busy (1 pm on a weekday), our service was less than spectacular.  The server introduced herself and her partner (we get two servers here???), but we actually got less attention than I'm used to from one server.  My drink never got refilled once in the 50 minutes we were there.  Our main server also seemed like she felt awkward the entire time she was serving us.  I actually felt bad for her. Not bad if you need a quick and affordable lunch, but there are better places that are just as fast and affordable right down the street."
Ryan C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",259,112,50,4.0,7/6/2010,"Sure, it's Chili's. It's a chain. But hey, when you're in the Monterey Bay where chains are few and far between (unless you venture out to Salinas), this is about as good as it gets. I come here a lot with my family when I'm down home for the weekend. Everytime we come around, the servers are nice. Lots of refills of strawberry lemonade and extra ranch dipping sauce. Sure, we do come around so often that all the servers know my parents, but hey it works. If anything, you know what you're getting when it comes to the food, and that's good enough in my book."
Charles D.,"Monterey, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/31/2013,"Ordered the combo half rack of ribs and lime shrimp. was just going to just get the ribs, but decided to ""go big"" and add the shrimp, cost was $17.99 vs $9.99 for the ribs, so $8 more. It came with 5 small one inch shrimp. bummer. Not worth it, and we arrived to a mostly empty resturant at 11:40 and were served at 12:20.  We had to be somewhere at 1:00 so we were getting anxious. This was only my second time there. Not sure if this was an off day or always like this."
Channon F.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,3.0,10/7/2012,Stopped in for a drink and an appatizer with a girlfriend. Cocktails took 15 minutes to get to the table. By that time the ice in my margarita glass melted and asked for a new one. My server forgot so my girlfrind walked to the bar and got me one herself. The appatizer took 20 minutes. The server had a cute personality but that's as far as it went. Other chilis are ok but not this location!
Cathy K.,"Seaside, CA",94,162,98,3.0,4/14/2012,"Ok - so I hate to admit it, but I LOVE Chili's, albeit not as much as some folks.  After spending a couple years in Washington, where there is one Chili's in Spokane and one at the airport, you start to crave a little mass-produced grease.   Beat up chain restaurants all you want, but one thing they strive to be, is consistent.  You always know what you are getting and how it should taste.  This location is no different and I like the ability to order the margarita chicken with black beans and rice.  This is a light option that I often appreciate and doesn't suck.  I chased my chicken with a glass of house chardonnay.  Again, not a huge fan of Barefoot, we let's face it - when you can't splurge on Opus One and Foie Gras for dinner all the time, this will do.  In the words of the farmer...""that'll do pig....that'll do.""   The service was good, as well.  Again, no complaints here at all.  Our server was on her game and had the water always full and the check in and out quick.  She got a great tip and she was still busy.  She managed to treat us better than many restaurants we have been to at much higher price points. Our food was warm and she didn't roll her eyes when I had a million little requests such as no cheese, dressing on the side, etc. etc.  Thank you for that!  While I am not ""Sally,"" I know all those details are sometimes challenging for some servers to keep up with.   For those of you with kiddos, they often run specials where kids eat free.  For those of us trying to stick to a budget, that can be a huge win! Good job, Chili's.  I am giving you a three because you are just fine the way you are and I save my 4 and 5 stars for non-mass produced food.  Don't let it get you down though, because we will definitely be back."
Mariah N.,"San Ramon, CA",0,14,8,4.0,5/23/2013,"As a college student going out with friends for drinks and food is always a must, Chili's is a great restaurant. The servers here are awesome and really make sure you are satisfied. The deals are the best part, 2 adult meals for 20$ including an appetizer. I receive coupons through email which consist of free appetizers and desserts and even kids meals! Always a good place to go to eat, large variety of food, my favorite is the honey chipotle chicken crispers, the taste is addicting! Can be crowded on weekends but weekdays you can usually be seated right away. Recommended"
Rachel C.,"Camas, WA",23,153,15,4.0,1/23/2010,"Went last Sunday with a friend of mine, it was 5pm and we where seated right away. Our waitress rocked, she was fun answered all the questions we had and, also gave us a tip about the dessert for the 3 course $20 special. :-)  So breakdown was this we got the  one app, two entrees, one dessert  Chips and salsa, very tasty (chips where still warm), the mini tacos smoked chicken (they where QUITE good), and the memphis rub half ribs (these didn't have a sauce but much better the ones I have had there in the past), and then the choc. molten cake (i loved it, i would have eaten it all if I wasn't on my diet.)  All in all I think I like chilis again. If they keep up the good service. Thanks chilis for warming my heart back up to you again. Now try not to screw it up."
Jake T.,"Monterey, CA",4,18,,4.0,1/12/2013,This is our Monday staple.  Austin takes care of us every time!  One of the very few chain restaurants around here and it's just a great stand-by.  We signed up for the coupons and get a great deal every week.  You know what you get with Chili's and we like it.
Adrian T.,"Surrey, Canada",0,1,,5.0,9/6/2014,"Poor reviews undeserved in my mind. Sat at the bar, ordered fajitas trio after my neighbors got theirs. Perfect!"
Kathie B.,"Chico, CA",113,70,34,4.0,7/27/2010,"Date of Visit: 7/25/10 Went there race Sunday (annual motorcycle races at Laguna Seca that bring in people from around the world), so very, very busy. Got a table in the bar that wasn't completely bussed (all other open rounds/booths were still topped with dirty dishes/baskets/etc. and with customers standing next to them waiting for those to be bussed, too), grabbed a rag from the nearby service counter and cleaned it off for the college student server that came shortly after.  Great service.  _Excellent_ food.  Decent price.  Even clean bathrooms.  To be a 5-star, the tables should have been cleaned pronto. Yep, even on Race Sunday because you've known for months it was Race Sunday."
Eric N.,"Salida, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/3/2014,Was enjoying my meal watching the Orange Bowl game when suddenly the TV I was watching changed to a basketball game. I got up... found a manager... told him what happened... and what a jerk! Told me to calm down but I wasn't even being argumentative. They finally switched the TV back but only after 5 more minutes (missed a big Clemson TD). Meal was ok (quesadilla I ordered was mostly tortilla and VERY little chicken or cheese)... service was ok (took quite a while to get refills or sides requested during ordering)... but manager was a jerk. He even came over to my table to try to make a joke about me being able to beat him up... no class. Stay away from thus location.
Yo M.,"San Francisco, CA",189,517,8,3.0,10/24/2011,"Solid. The Boss and I arrived promptly at 12 pm to find that there was no wait for a table.  We were intrigued by the combo lunch options - I opted to do the soup and ""over-the-top-cobb salad"".  At $7.00 this was a nice portion of cobb salad.  it came with iceberg lettuce which is my least favorite of the letttuces, however, it had ample chicken, cheese, tomatoes, eggs, bacon and avocado.  I was pleased.   The Boss who is blessed with a warp speed metabolism managed to devour a really nice creamy looking chicken pasta and a creamy enchilada soup.  Both looked really good. Service was adequate.  When I needed a different dressing, I just flagged another server down.   The food took a really long time though and the restaurant is VERY cold!"
Rachel S.,"Pacific Grove, CA",14,79,39,3.0,1/30/2014,"First time ever at a Chili's Grill and Bar and for being a chain restaurant, we got what we expected. Surprisingly, for a group of five adults and three kids ages five and under, we were seated pretty quickly. Our waiter is the only reason why I am giving this location three stars, she was very accommodating to all of our requests. I ordered the parmesan encrusted tilapia  which came with a side of broccoli and their rice (which was not Mexican, I thought that was odd) and the chicken was placed on top of the rice, ultimately causing the rice to be drenched in oil and fat that probably came from the deep fryer the chicken was cooked in. THE BROCCOLI WAS PERFECT. I am very picky with how my broccoli is cooked and the green vegetable was just perfect. The tilapia for one smelled fishy and I after I got through half of the large fillet I literally choke on all of the spices, which for the first half of the fillet seemed non existant, and our lovely waiter comes over and asks if I was okay and I would like my dish traded out because she could smell the overload of spice from three feet away. Another person in our group had soft tortillas as a part of their dish and they were hard like a tortilla chip. The service here is above par for a busy chain restaurant, the food was what I expected, yet I still hoped for more."
Kelly M.,"Carmel Valley, CA",20,15,,5.0,5/15/2013,"ok, i never thought i would be so excited about a 'chain' type restaurant, but i am in love with the Mango chicken dish!! when i crave it , i can always count on Chilis to be consistent! also, the bartender is awesome, i think his name is Wade? he make the best skinny  margarita!! the place is just plain good when i have a craving for that mango chicken!!"
Shiho F.,"Carmel by the Sea, CA",4971,2834,2440,3.0,2/6/2011,"3.5 I want my baby-back, baby-back, baby-back, baby-back ribs ... Sorry had to, that is the first thought that came into my mind when a friend suggested that we come here for a late night dinner.  They were open until 11pm tonight which was nice since most every other dining option in Monterey would have included a bunch of drunks and people spilling booze all over you.  Saying that, I'm usually on the other side, and I rarely go out to eat dinner past 10pm, I just go to get semi-faded. So my last visit to Chili's was in Denver off 15th Street or was it 16th Street (the main drag) where Chili's is a happening spot in D-town... lunch, forgetaboutit packed... the time before I hadn't hit puberty yet.    True story. This awkwardly located Chili's (behind the enormous also awkward pink Embassy Suites) is also huge inside and reminded me of a better looking Chevy's.  We had a solid time and the staff was uber friendly and we enjoyed our dinner on one of the booths near the bar.  Bartender looked like a nice guy (I was being very good not ordering a Marg or two) and our main server was super friendly as were the other guys that stopped by to check on us. Food was fine.  I was stoked to try the Texas Cheese Fries (reminds me of Irish Nachos) and not bad with their Ranch dressing, I dug the pickled jalapeños but surprisingly the bacon bits... not so much.  I like my fries soggy just putting it out there.  We got the 2 for $20 combo which is a stupid deal (good that is) and I got the Ribs and my friend the Bacon Burger.  We were going to split them but I ended up eating all the ribs (only half rack or 4 ribs) and there wasn't much meat on them and they weren't falling of the bone but they were tasty and I enjoyed the BBQ Sauce (Shiner Bock BBQ Sauce).  I took a bite of the real bacon from the burger and it was lovely.  The burger looked perfect, medium rare (executed perfectly), fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes and the bacon nice and crispy.  The bun was even soft and fresh.  Amazing. Oh we upgraded our side on the entree for salad which was a buck more and although it was a standard salad it did have some cheese (yeah it was shredded but what do you expect), diced cucumbers (never have been served diced cucumbers before), cheesy croutons (not talking with cheese) and a whole bunch of sliced red onions which I love but there were just way too many.  But overall not bad. I've always thought of Applebee's and Chili's the same (level of everything) but I'm started to think Chili's is a nice step up from Applebee's whose atmosphere is always dark and dreary.  I've only been to Applebee's twice, both times I had to be dragged in and I've only enjoyed the steak there and I was recently told by someone who has a friend that had worked in an Applebee's kitchen that the reason why their steaks are good is because they sprinkle some of that MSG right on there.... but it's just sugar right??? Anyways, the ambiance was warm and inviting tonight at Chili's even though the majority of the front portion of the restaurant (right side when you walk in) was closed and roped off by an imaginary something.  I'd love to go back here and grab a drink at their nice looking bar.  Hope the margaritas are good because I can't stand a place that can't make a good one... come on people it's not that hard."
