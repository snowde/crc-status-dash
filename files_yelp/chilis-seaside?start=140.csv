Meghan B.,"Monterey, CA",292,51,,4.0,3/4/2012,"Chili's is your average chain restaurant.  They do have some great specials that aren't to be missed.  Their two for $20 dinner is great, you get one shared appetizer and two entrees.  Right now, they also have a two for $35 dinner where each person gets a margarita, you get one shared appetizer, two entrees, and a shared dessert. Always great for a quick and reliable meal."
Abisheg E.,"Wayne, PA",0,1,,1.0,5/27/2014,Extremely rude. I would never go there again! They really need to learn how to treat customers. They were so arrogant I left after being there for 20 mins.
Dan D.,"Sonora, CA",15,73,3,2.0,2/12/2012,Took our food as a take out. Didn't notice until back at the hotel they shorted us two items and condiment sour cream for the baked potato skins! What a pain! Just get it right the first time! The reason that got 2 stars was that the food we got was good.
R A.,"San Mateo, CA",1,10,2,2.0,9/17/2011,Food is ok. Had the margarita and the only thing I tasted was the margarita mix.... I would've given a star but our server was great !!!  Thanks Brittani.....
Seth L.,"San Jose, CA",20,37,,3.0,9/28/2012,"It's like any other Chili's. The service is decent, the food is great, the parking lot is spacial, and the location is convenient to those who live in Monterey or Sand City."
S W.,"Monterey, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/28/2012,I used to take my wife here every once in awhile for lunch dates or evening dates. Our opinion of the place has kept going down as of lately. The food isn't exactly spectacular and the waitstaff is ok. I wish they would bring up the standards a little bit. We might stop by more often.
Dave S.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,14,,3.0,5/9/2010,"You know, the place is just ok with the way it is with places like Applebees, Carrows, Denny's, and the like. I have never really had a bad experience here. The waitstaff has always been nice. There was one waitress that was super-attentive to everything. Especially being the lunch rush. She must be new and hasn't been exposed to a lot. But I would say she was overly pleasant. Can't go wrong with that. The food is good. I haven't ever gotten the shits from it. So I guess that's the best I can come up with.  P.S- Don't expect fancy people. After all. It is Chilis. We aren't going to expect a extravagent dining experience."
B U.,"Monterey, CA",10,1,,1.0,6/13/2013,"Wish I could give 0 stars, created Yelp account just to let all you Yelpers know how horrible this place is!  First, people that came after us were seated first (same party size and same demographics of family). The server never told us her name, rarely checked on us and didn't even seem to care about us visiting this establishment.  After taking just our appetizer and drink order the waitress disappeared for 10 minutes and didn't show up for another 10 minutes, I highly doubt this is company policy. We saw her walk by several times not once asking how things were. While I was walking my 10 month old around the dining area, there was straws, broccoli on the floor. Many tables, at least 5-6 were not bussed. I noticed garbage all over the kitchen floor.  The french fries were over fried and unedible, the steak was very chewie ( when ordered medium rare). The other oddity was that the manager checked up on us only and none of the surrounding tables, which we really didn't understand. Will never eat at Chili's again."
Yennie N.,"San Francisco, CA",82,136,63,4.0,9/29/2011,"I dont normally eat at Chili's and everytime I go the experience is average. This place though deserves a kudos just for the waitress alone. She was attentive, was on top of all her tables and made excellent suggestions. The food was very good as well ( it may have to do with the fact that i was extremely hungry). Over-all great job guys!"
Jade D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,21,1,2.0,7/9/2011,"Got here about 6:30 and the place was full roar (loud).  After a week in Monterey, we decided we wanted a steak & couldn't see anything in the area that looked like what we were after, so we settled for a chain restaurant knowing that the food is pretty much standard wherever you go.  We were seated promptly & served relatively quickly for the crowd they had in there.  Steaks were done perfectly.  I thought mine was a little salty, but then I don't care for salt so that's expected.   The kicker for the 2-star rating was our server.  My husband's water was down about a inch & she was over immediately to refill.  Mine was empty - I couldn't even catch her eye to refill, but she saw my husband's hand in a heartbeat.  (ok)  She came over to ask my husband how his meal was.  I waited for her to ask me ... not.  (ok)  My husband was asked if he was interested in dessert?  me ... quick glance & gone.  (ok)  The really, really fun part - my husband doesn't pay & if he does, he doesn't tip.  He doesn't believe in tipping.  So you can imagine the look on the server's face when I pick up the check after she's been buttering up the wrong guy all dinner.  OoPs."
Paul L.,"Carmel Valley, CA",50,251,3,3.0,7/12/2011,It's Chilis. Do you really need to read a review?
Jonathan D.,"Berkeley, CA",181,180,5,3.0,6/15/2008,"I was with two kids all day and my wife was in a conference all day - we were tired and Chili's was close to the hotel (it actually shares the same parking lot with Embassy Suites in Seaside. Pretty textbook Chili's I'm guessing.  The menu looks like every other large chain restaurant I have been in - lots of colorful pictures that are perfect airbrushed versions of the food they bring to the table.  Eli had Kraft Mac and Cheese and Annie ate the baby food we brought in.  Kate had a Margarita (she had plans for dinner later) and I had the combo fajitas.  They got the order wrong for mine.  I wanted the mix of chicken beef and shrimp and I got the chicken and beef (oh well) it was still yummy.  The tortillas were nice and warm and the plate of veg/guac/sour cream was fresh and delicious.  I had a couple of house margaritas which were good and salty.   I am guessing if I went back in 3 years the entire staff would have changed over and the experience would be identical to the one I had - very formulaic.  Totally acceptable and completely benign, but formulaic."
John K.,"Newton, MA",11,15,,1.0,5/9/2009,"This particular location of Chili's started a now lifelong aversion to the chain for me.  This was back in about 2005.  I never liked them previously- all salt and fat with no flavor - but I'd eat at them occasionally on a work trip.  Then I went to this one and got some kind of southwestern/mexican dish, fajita maybe, and it was the usual tastelessness, but really exceptionally missing some depth of flavor.  This thing was screaming out for some seasoning, so I asked the waitress for some cumin.  ""What'd you say?""   I try this about 3 times with her until it is clear she hasn't ever heard of cumin.  She does humor me by going in back and asking for some, and comes back with a shaker of their seasoning salt mix.  I know and you know that one can't expect too much from a chain restaurant, but come on here.  Chili's presents itself as a southwestern/tex-mex kind of place that seems like they ought to have some idea of what to do with a reasonable variety of spices.  Their tagline is ""Life's too short for bland meals."" after all.  Now I'm packing cumin on business trips and generally avoiding Chili's."
Kieu L.,"Brisbane, CA",1,7,,2.0,4/27/2011,"Sunday afternoon, 1 customer (me)  Time for server to show up: 15 mins.  Time for the food to show up: 35 mins!  Time for me to inhale the food: 10 mins (it was good).  Time for me to get the check: 5 mins...  You be the judge."
Romeo J.,"San Ramon, CA",1,15,,4.0,7/8/2011,Food not so great... but the service was good.. the server Sean was great and on point! Got the drinks and food on time and wan very helpful on the menu...
Gina D.,"Monterey, CA",36,17,66,1.0,6/6/2011,"Really have gone down hill. The last straw was a milk shake that I ordered that wasn't even ice cream, yuck"
Sylvia M.,"Benicia, CA",48,12,13,3.0,5/29/2011,"I LOVE Chili's and this one in particular was not the best I have ever been to. We went on a holiday weekend and they weren't too busy, we were actually seated right away. We had a baby with us and told the hostess we needed a high chair before she sat us, she sat us in a booth and went to get a high chair then came back empty handed saying that they ran out. Reall?!?! You guys aren't that busy to where you should run out of high chairs! We had to sit the baby on the table to feed her until a highchair became available, luckily one became available before our dinner was served. Prior to our dinner being served I notice a piece of paper folded in half sitting in the middle of our table, I grabbed it to take a look and someone had wadded up a piece of their ""ABC"" gum in the middle of the paper, I guess the bus person missed that when they cleaned our table! I gave this a 3 stars because our waitress never left our glasses empty, our food was served hot and in a timely manner but just wasn't happy how things turned out prior to ordering."
Felix S.,"Rogue River, OR",1,7,6,1.0,8/16/2011,"I waited for a long time (15 minutes?) and had no one attend to me - I walked out. They were busy, but the waiter who was waiting the tables next to me walked past me several times w/o acknowledging that he wiould be right with me. Meh."
Rachel C.,"Salinas, CA",7,15,4,2.0,8/27/2014,"The minute we sat down our waitress informed us that the kitchen was going to be closing down soon and that we needed to make a selection if we wanted something specific. Wow, why even seat us then? We googled to see when they closed and it said 1030 online, but she informed us that that was incorrect and it was actually 10p. Ok, not too bad since we arrived at about 9:30p. So, right then and there we had to make our order. I didn't even peak at the menu and just went with the thing I loved to eat at the Salinas location, Monterey Chicken. The chicken was cooked pretty well, but the sauce tasted weird and sour. I guess different locations make their own interpretations of a dish? The gravy that we had tasted off too. It just wasn't a good experience at all. Oh, and not to mention the silverware!! It is totally distgusting. First set I had had some leftover green sliver of food and the forks are grimy with bits and pieces of food. GROSS!  I had to wipe down my own silverware. I know this is a chain restaurant and I can't expect 5 star quality, but that is just not sanitary. I will say that throughout the meal the waitress made up for her rudeness, but it was just not enough. I do not plan to eat here ever again. Drive or walk a bit further and enjoy some Black Bear or shoot, Denny's has better food and service then here. We tipped a decent amount because being a server is hard work, but it would have been more if our meal didn't start out with us feeling unwanted and rushed. And those new kiosks are such a pain in the butt especially if you have impatient and tired children.. They just get in the way and cause unnecessary issues."
AJ C.,"Monterey, CA",7,25,6,4.0,3/23/2010,"Great place to have good food at a decent  price, burger selection is very good and the drink selection also very good....great place to go with some friends and have a few drinks and food and hang out...."
