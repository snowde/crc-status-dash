George B.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,1,1.0,2/6/2013,"Checked in early to watch the Super Bowl, eat and drink.  Awful food...but good thing that the prices were based on Happy Hour.  The TV channel they put on totally missed the every second of pre-game activities.  When I asked them to change the channel, the waitress gave me a nasty look, said nothing and walked away!!"
Liz B.,"Marina, CA",63,53,11,5.0,12/18/2009,"They have the best ribs and great service . I love their 3 for 20 meal, three courses for $10 a person. We go here weekly. One time they messed up our to go order but fixed it and refunded us our meal and gave us two huge drinks. We're happy."
L K.,"Seaside, CA",4,26,8,2.0,2/28/2010,"I've been to Chili's before, about a couple years ago. But somehow it's not that great anymore. The service was slow and took foreverrrrrrr. The food is ok, but I'd rather go to a fast food joint. I will never want to come here again, unless dragged."
Patty L.,"Seaside, CA",47,43,5,1.0,5/26/2008,"Scott - Our waitress was really really ditzy.  Did not listen to any of our requests or forgot most of them.  All me and patty ordered was the bloomin onion and a strawberry lemonade while her friends ordered the triple meat mexican thing with tortillas, and the old fashioned hamburger.   The regular water was just tap water.  Even the water that is used to make the lemonade was made with tap water. The bloomin onion looked pretty nice when it came out.  It was amazingly salty, saltier than other chilis chains.  We had it with ranch and BBQ.  The ranch wasnt very zesty and the BBQ sauce was too zesty.  The BBQ sauce tasted more like ketchup gone wrong. I had a quarter of the old fashioned hamburger and well, it was a hamburger.  The triple meat tortilla thing was alright.  I made a taco first, found out it was terrible, then just ate some of the meat by itself. Our bill was $40 total.  I could have easily spent the same amount of money with just me and patty (2 entrees and an appetizer), but im glad i didnt.  I didnt fill myself up with all the terrible food so im writing this review a little hungry.  I do have a stomach ache if that counts towards anything."
Kim S.,"Monterey, CA",59,225,15,3.0,3/2/2008,"For a chain, Chili's is pretty decent.  The food is good, and they have a nice selection of choices.  Yes there's a lot of fried stuff, but sometimes you crave fried stuff! As a vegetarian I have always loved them for the fact that they'll substitute a black bean patty on any of their burgers.  The black bean patties are tasty, and there's nothing better than being able to order a burger and fries like a normal person. Plus compared to a lot of restaurants in this area they're cheaper, and I've never had a problem with the service here."
Garett T.,"San Francisco, CA",201,472,499,2.0,9/21/2006,"Good enough food, but it's all fried!  Fried, fried, FRIED, which is terrible when you like their ""awesome blossom"" dish (fried onions). Things are too expensive, service can take forever, and something awful happened there to a friend.  'Nuff said."
Raymond W.,"Volcano, CA",8,54,,2.0,3/8/2012,"We like the menu at Chili's and have been to several of their stores.  The food is consistently good and they have a full bar.  When we went to the Seaside Chili's this month, we encountered the worst service we've had, in any restaurant, in any country, in 20 years.  20 minute wait for a refill on Coke or wine, children's meals delivered without fries (they came separately, 15 minutes later) - the list goes on.  They have no idea what they're doing."
Emme A.,"Leander, TX",23,43,,2.0,9/7/2009,"I want this Chili's to be a good one, because I live nearby and there aren't many restaurants open late. But every meal I've had this Chili's is mediocre at best-- so bland that I generally give up and leave most of it on my plate.  The service is spotty, and I think that most of the wait staff is not paying attention when they take your order. I thought it was terrible when my son order a salad without any chicken (he was vegetarian) and it came chocked-full of meat.  I know the waitress heard us, because she quizzically asked my son twice if that's what he said. Well, the only positive thing I can say is that their margaritas decent."
Leo T.,"Belmont, CA",148,478,,5.0,10/7/2008,"Chili's is a great family-friendly restaurant! Try their Baby Back Ribs,their Guiltless Grill Shrimp Pasta-and for dessert,don't forget their Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. If you've got a birthday coming up and you're bringing family/friends to dinner who are watching their cholesterol or have food allergies,come to Chili's as they have something for everyone."
Ashley D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,16,1,1.0,6/20/2013,"Our experience here was horrific. We came in for an early lunch at 11 to beat the crowds, we were greeted and seated in a timely manner. Our waitress brought us our drinks and took our order...and from there it went straight to hell. While waiting for our food a huge group of 30+ people came in, they chose to sit this group all around us in different booths. I soon couldn't even hear myself talk because of the yelling this party of people was doing back and forth to each other. They were hanging over the booths, running from table to table, kicking the back of the booth seats...you would have thought these people were wild animals. They sat all 8 of the children which had to be 12 and under together in the table directly behind us with no parent. Come on, really? Where are these peoples manners? We waited for our waitress to come back to our table for a good 20min, hoping she would move us and by now I'm sure everyone can tell we are very annoyed. Another 10min go by...no waitress. My husband finally gets up to go look for her. Keep in mind we have been waiting for our food for close to an hour now. He finally finds her and she sends her manager over. We explain our unhappiness and ask for our food to go. She apologizes and says she will give us one meal free. We don't even wait at the table for our food. We get up and wait by the entrance and before they can even clean off our table the group of ""animals"" rushes in and starts eating off our Chips and Salsa plate. I'm shocked, and disgusted. They finally bring our food out to us and we go to the local 20th street park to eat , only to realize they haven't given us utensils with our ""to-go"" order or even napkins for that matter. By the time my husband drives back and returns with our utensils our food is not even warm anymore. My husband had ordered the fajitas and when he opens his box, they had forgot the tortillas. So he returns for a 3rd time. The manager apologizes over and over. By now we just want our money back. But the manager decides it fair to give us $30 in ""Chili's Cash"" instead, when our party of 5 clearly payed over $70 with lunch and drinks...really? Like I'm ever coming back here again! Please, don't waste your time. I'm disgusted and horrified at the service these people have. Keep it up Chili's, you wont last much longer."
Andrew W.,"Hurst, TX",1,33,9,1.0,8/27/2009,"I've been a huge fan of Chili's since I lived in DFW. (where they actually care about the service you recieve with your meal) Since then, every other Chili's that I walk into has been a chaotic mess of incompetent wait staff. This place is exactly that. I've actually gone in there and told the waitress to just randomly give me something off the menu, because anything I order will come back wrong anyways. On a side note, they are horrible about bringing out the adult's food 10 minutes before your kid's. This drives me crazy..."
David G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,121,,3.0,1/23/2010,"Average food, here. Good service.  I had to send my Cobb salad back as it looked unhealthy with breaded chicken.  There was only a teaspoon of the ""apple cooked"" bacon crumbs, when we expected at least one or two ounces of pieces of bacon (instead of a few tiny bacon crumbs).  Normally, a cobb salad has a whole egg cut into quarter pieces, but I received only a few egg crumbs.  We sent it back and ordered a better caesar salad.  Clean restrooms. Good parking."
John B.,"Berkeley, CA",6,37,,1.0,1/30/2009,Chilis is terrible. Awful food that makes me feel sick afterward and has far more salt and fat than anyone should be eating. Just gross.
Jacob H.,"Salinas, CA",110,188,1,3.0,10/28/2006,I have had good service here.  The food is chili's nothing unique... Fried fare...
