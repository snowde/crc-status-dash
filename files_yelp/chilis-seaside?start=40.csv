Vicky L.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",25,2,,1.0,7/28/2016,"Servers need to be trained. Our server didn""t introduce herself and didn't smile at all. Our drinks came after 10 min. Food came out after 30 min, part of order is missing, a sizzling order was cold. Our server didn't bother check us. We were given 50% but this won't cover how poor this restaurant is. Train your servers! Praises for Adam for stepping up!"
Thomas T.,"Seaside, CA",3,25,12,3.0,10/10/2016,"I've been to other Chili's restaurants and always enjoyed the food. This location though needs to educate the staff. I ordered the sirloin medium rare. It came nearly well done, cooked completely through.  Not even close to what I ordered. Stephani my waitress was very apologetic but she was not responsible. She did talk to the manager who gave me a generous 50% discount on the entree which was ample compensation but the food cooked the way it was ordered would have been better."
Grachelle L.,"Seaside, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/4/2017,Kelsey gave A1 customer service. I ordered the sunrise burger and it was pretty good. The place is clean and food comes out pretty quickly even though I dined on a busy night. 10/10 will come again.
Samantha S.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/29/2017,"The restaurant was fairly empty when we got there and we were sat right away, but after that it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us again. We had to ask the host while she was passing by to remind our server we were there. Once she finally came to our table she was very attentive. When the food came out though, it did not look appetizing at all and tasted just bad. The ribs I ordered were tough and the BBQ sauce slathered on top was cold. I would not recommend eating here."
Bill H.,"Monterey, CA",260,110,206,5.0,8/27/2014,"I love chili's. I know what I'm getting.  Even of I know I'm getting two days worth of sodium in one sitting, I'm good with that.   I try to eat right and exercise so that I can indulge myself in some Texas cheese fries and a tall cold pilsner from time to time. While it's true that I could fill up on some kale or quinoa creation, neither of those will fill my soul like some potato skins or fajitas will."
Jody C.,"Marina, CA",104,2,1,1.0,9/30/2016,"I enjoy chili's. I enjoy the service, but tonight was just unacceptable.... I found a dead caterpillar (about the length of a nickel) in my to go order. After this, I get the feeling that the food here is not thoroughly washed. This is disgusting!"
Jeffrey P.,"Vacaville, CA",483,16,18,1.0,3/31/2016,"I placed an order online and received a confirmation email that my order was to be picked up at 10:04pm. It's was placed at 9:53pm. I got a call from Brittany saying that the kitchen closes in 1 minute and they will not be able to make my order. That it needed to be placed an hour before in the restaurant. Now, how does this make sense when I'm placing a to-go order online. I don't want to drive down and place an order when I can do it online!!! I'm on a family vacation and this was by far the worst thing that could be done. If your staff wants to get out early then you need to not be in the restaurant business!!!!"
Bia N.,"Seaside, CA",4,9,2,2.0,8/12/2016,"Not good, not bad. Boring. Dry pasta and also the mashed pototoes kinda taste off. The service is alright. No complaints. We are taking a break from Chili's after we had 3 times in a row bad luck."
Emily G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,128,1,5.0,6/13/2016,The food and service were awesome! I especially enjoyed the cheese nachos and steak fajitas :)
Corin N.,"Marina, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/8/2016,"Service was prompt and place was clean. The Food was...ok. The plate was a mess, looked like the beans had run over the side in a few places and the juice was baked on. Bean juice on plates without beans on them. Nothing special but it put food in the belly. Have not tried the drinks."
Ron P.,"Monterey, CA",49,2,1,1.0,7/7/2016,Poor service The tableside guacamole was terrible. Appetizer came out cold and the top of it my wife came to meet me for dinner exactly at 10 and the manager told me it's against the store policy to let anybody in after 10 so this is the last time I will be eating here!!!
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,3.0,1/4/2016,Came in on Christmas Eve. Wait time wasn't too bad. Service was decent....then. Now service isn't so hot. I've been in over a handful of times and it's all just meh. Staff is just lackluster and not as attentive as they should be. Maybe they just need new staff in here to do a better job. Food is good though.
Bert K.,"Mountain View, CA",61,1206,,3.0,5/12/2014,I enjoyed my Two for $20 deal. my part was mango tilapia; it was tangy and spicy and cooked just right; a side of brown rice worked well too. I paid a buck more and ate a good green salad. Parking: plenty. Props: walking distance from Embassy Suites. Customer service: friendly and fine. Bathrooms: clean.
Alice B.,"Castroville, CA",0,40,13,5.0,12/5/2016,A nice hot bowl of chicken enchilada soup.. it was so good the mid evening while I was sitting there the waitress paid my bill.. wasn't that nice of her.... she said feels  good for giving for Christmas .. bless her soul
Shacara P.,"Monterey, CA",63,18,2,2.0,6/1/2015,"So I've been twice in the past couple months. The first time we went we ordered dessert and it took over 15 minutes of the dessert sitting there for us to get spoons. Meanwhile the entire staff was clapping and singing. Just wanted spoons!  I go back again, this time with my mom. Order a sandwich with no mayo, and of course it was all over it. The other thing I thought was weird was I only got the sandwich and was told my fries would be out separately. The came out five minutes later in a doggy bag. Uh, okay. Never got an apology, just took it back and brought me another one. Even worse, this one was cold. The bread wasn't toasted and the chicken was freezing. And because of this, the cheese hadn't even melted. How delicious."
J R.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,28,2.0,3/27/2016,Food was ok. Only reason we went there was because its next door to Embassy suites( didn't feel like driving ) our bartender was terrible. Manager was worse asked if I could log into my rewards from kiosks they have on bar just got ignored. Next time I will drive to another place that visit this Chili's
Samantha E.,"Pacific Grove, CA",75,4,,1.0,11/13/2016,"This place was great a couple years ago. But last time I went, every single order was wrong in some way. My salad was made completely wrong, the chicken felt like it came right out of the refrigerator, my husband's corn on the cob was cold and soggy, his sauce was wrong, and much more. It took a while to get the food, so why it was cold, I have no idea. I called shorty after (it was a take out order) and spoke with the supervisor Angel, and expressed my disappointment and requested a refund. I was told refunds are not allowed, but he would send me a free meal coupon. Which was weeks ago. And I still don't have the coupon. Very disappointing. At least In 'N Out is next door"
H G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/5/2016,Food was underwhelming (even for Chili's). Took 30 minutes to get our drinks (which were half full). Never coming back. (Service was okay).
Teresa D.,"Seaside, CA",20,17,7,2.0,10/3/2016,Bad service all the way around gee thanks for having us wait and wait for our drinks and for trying to charge us for table entertainment that we never played!!! Check your bill people!
Brenda B.,"Monterey, CA",14,11,1,2.0,3/28/2016,"This location is nice but, I wish  the service was better.  It takes a while on nights where it is not crowded still takes the server a long time to deliver food.  The check out machines NEVER have paper for the receipt.  Fajitas dont sizzle.  Not impressed"
