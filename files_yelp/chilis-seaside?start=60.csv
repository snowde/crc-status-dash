Sarah R.,"The Villages, FL",1,41,4,3.0,2/13/2016,"Service is either terrible or alright, never once has it been great. Love their food and prices are good. Great place for family or if you want to watch a sports game in the bar area."
Fred F.,"Monterey, CA",0,20,,2.0,8/9/2016,"Other than the service, rest sucks. Both of us had upset stomachs rest of night...order your meat raw and it might come med rare....ruined both a steak and hamburger that we ordered med rare by cooking it till over well....and when we sent it back, we were told that in the light it was red...we were sitting next to the window!"
Gabriela J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,8,5,4.0,1/6/2016,Came in for a light meal since it was a little late. The place was nice and the bartender was very nice. Food as usual was good.
Maddison B.,"Lake Forest, CA",247,25,,5.0,8/22/2016,Best service I've ever had at Chili's and food! Adam was great. He was very prompt and checked on us multiple times! Every restaurant needs an Adam! Thank you Adam
Manina C.,"Monterey, CA",50,47,10,1.0,4/19/2014,"Personally, I haven't eaten at this Chili's for over a year.  It's not worth the time or money.  The food is awful.  This was confirmed again this week.  Two different acquaintances made the mistake of eating here this week on separate occasions.   One had a confirmed case of food poisoning by the doctor on Thursday.  The other is still too busy throwing up after eating there last night to make it to the doctor. Unless you wish to spend the next day worshiping the porcelain god, avoid this place."
Rick S.,"San Diego, CA",0,36,1,2.0,5/18/2015,"Beer selection is below average (all the fizzy pale girly yellow lagers you want and one IPA plus the usual uninspired assortment of mass-produced overpriced bottled beers.).  I ordered a bowl of their Terlingua chili - in other Chili's restaurants I've been disappointed in the quality and amount of chili served and I hoped this one more attempt would be rewarded with a better experience.  Nope. The bowl was less than half full of chili.  LESS THAN HALF  Just for giggles I counted the number of spoonfuls in the bowl - 9 and a quarter.  9.25 spoons of chili for $5.29.  Now I know I can go to the 99 Cent Store and buy a can of chili that easily has more than three times what I was served for about a sixth of the price, and Chili's chili wasn't even as good as the stuff from the 99 Cent Store.  I counted three measurable chunks of Mystery Meat among my 9.25 spoonfuls of watered-down tomato-based soup.  No crackers, no chips, just 9.25 spoonfuls of tepid sludge and a pinch of shredded cheese on top trying desperately to melt. Seriously - a place called Chili's should be proud and loud about their flagship dish.  The cookie-cutter franchise mentality of the chain is evident.  The only reason it gets two stars is Jessica the bartender - she was attentive and efficient."
Anthony P.,"San Jose, CA",73,187,339,2.0,7/6/2012,"I came here with my roommate since I had a $25 gift card given to me some time back. We got the $20 for 2 deal.  We split a half order of Texas Cheese Fries which was melted cheese, bacon and green onions with ranch dipping sauce. The fries were alright. The cheese had hardened by the time the fries made it to our table so I didn't get the cheesy texture I was looking for.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta with an Alfredo sauce. This has to be by far the worst pasta I have ever had. It tasted like it came out of a Kraft box. As an Italian, I am ashamed of eating such a catastrophe of a dish. My roommate on the other hand enjoyed his meal just a bit more than I did. He got their half rack of baby back ribs with home fries.  Final Thoughts: Bar far the worst chain restaurant I have been to to date. The service was superb however! Our server was very attentive. Its such a shame he is wasting his talent working at a shithole!"
Sandy L.,"Fremont, CA",25,48,248,3.0,4/1/2014,"Came in for a quick lunch before heading to the beach! It's what I expected Chili's to be - friendly server, large dining area, adequate food. We sat in the bar area ( fully equipped with several large TV's with the sports on) and a huge island bar in the middle. Not a lot of people at noon, so we got a lot of attention from the servers.  Food quality - it was ok. Edible but not delicious. It's Chili's, what do you expect"
Vladimir M.,"San Francisco, CA",17,1,,1.0,11/2/2015,"Called to place an order. Was told to come to restaurant to place a to go order. Was told i could do it online, tried, website tells you to call the restaurant. Told the guy at the restaurant, he tells me something is wrong on MY end. Tried giving him a card to pre-pay, cant take it over the phone for ""security reasons""."
Alanna E.,"Fresno, CA",3,26,3,4.0,8/15/2015,"I'm not sure why this restaurant has such a low rating. I think the environment is pretty relaxed, prices are good. My boyfriend and I got the 2 for $20 for dinner and it comes with an appetizer. Pretty good deal for two full entrees, we even had leftovers. It looked like they had great desserts but we were too full to try them. Service was good as well, overall a good experience, we'll definitely be back again."
Glenda G.,"Monterey, CA",11,11,3,1.0,2/16/2015,"We ate at Chili's tonight, as we have on many occasions. Tonight our server forgot our salads, the host or manager (not sure what his job was) was bussing a table and wiped the floor then used the same towel to wipe the table. The family that sat at the table after with three small children!!! Several minutes later the same employee cleared the table across from us and when he was done cleaning the table he used the towel to wipe his shoes!!! I was in disbelief that anyone would do this. I cannot imagine what happens that we don't see? I have NEVER seen this happen in any restaurant I have been in, ever. We will never go back to Chili's again"
Serenity A.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,96,147,4.0,7/5/2014,The service at this place is really good not very crowded located easily off of the freeway we had the Texas cheese fries they were delicious my husband's hamburger was a little messy but it tasted great I had the to heat a chicken and they were very good you can never go wrong with chilis bar and grill yummy for my tummy
Don H.,"Pacific Grove, CA",5,35,11,2.0,7/25/2015,"Friendly staff and good service but the food is edible. Had steak-really bland, and grilled shrimp. It was frozen and not fresh. Not going back."
Terry S.,"Santa Ana, CA",137,66,5,4.0,6/3/2015,"This Chili's gets 4 stars because of service, speed, and friendliness of staff. I was there on a Wednesday night. Super busy, however they managed very well. No mistakes, good service, and the Classic Bacon Burger was pretty good. Often in the area once a month. I would venture there again if all else fails."
Floyd S.,"Yuma, AZ",9,24,23,4.0,7/19/2015,Was sitting at the bar having a Bloody Mary and my favorites. Chicken enchilada soup and skillet queso.  Is there really anything that cheese doesn't make better?
Lauren S.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,1,1.0,8/19/2015,"Decided to order take-out at this location and figured chips and salsa would be the quickest thing since I had family from out of town visiting at a hotel near by here. Once we arrived we put in our order and the take out woman (Margarita I believe was her name) said it would just take a minute and she would go and grab it for us. Well my Father and I waited for about 4 minutes as she just stood there and helped other guest after us. Then once 10 minutes rolled around she confronted us again, saying ""I will go grab your chips now."" Which is what she had said 10 minutes ago. Then she came back with no chips, eventually after waiting another 10 minutes the manager started helping guest and we let her know that we had been waiting for chips and salsa for 20 minutes. Even after the manager went to find the take out woman she still wasn't getting our order. Horrible customer service!  And thank you for wasting that 20 minutes that could have been extra family time."
Mike S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",5,9,,1.0,6/9/2013,"This place was absolutely the worst. I don't actually take the time to review on a regular basis however this place was so bad that I thought it deserved special attentions (which is not what we received at this armpit of a restaurant). Please do not go here and save yourself from horrible service, cold food, and generally just bad management. Upon being seated we waited no less than 15 minutes for our waitress to grace us with her presence. Once she finally came over I had to take a look around and make sure that we weren't on some reality show because there is no way that a waitress this bad with this amount of attitude should still be employed. We ordered appetizers that came out cold AND with the rest of the meal. We ordered the chicken fajitas and they were just blah. Our kids had mac and cheese, also cold (more than likely because our horrible waitress was running around accomplishing nothing). I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this place. Just to summarize...This place sucked, don't go there. Save your family from the agony."
Margaret M.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,9,1.0,6/20/2015,Worst food of any Chili's I've been to.  Service was horrible (Jessica was her name). Skimpiest servings ever. My Flatbread literally had 1 tiny piece of chicken on each slice + 1 sliver of Avacado. The manager was very helpful & adjusted the cost of my meal because of the horrible meal & service.   I wish I would have taken a photo of my food!
Vicki D.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",59,102,42,4.0,12/3/2013,We went to this Chilis because it was next to our hotel. We had a late dinner. I had the avocado bacon jack chicken with broccoli and rice. It was really good. The chicken was moist and the broccoli was cooked perfectly. I also had a blackberry margarita that was excellent!
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,1.0,9/1/2014,"Avoid this place.  Food served could not be chowed sufficiently to allow a shallow.   Meat was fibrous and appeared undercooked.  Service was lazy with no refills and several changes of waitresses.   Much worse than the worst Dennys or CoCos.  I ask the waitress to tell the manager they were serving food that could not be eaten and that they should stop serving it.  She offered an electronic tablet to register my complaints and a check for $33.  I paid the check with a 15% tip and told her to read my review on Yelp.  She said ""...whatever"" and walked off.  I recommend you not go here.  Sad but let's vote with our feet."
