B C.,"Marina, CA",19,141,3,5.0,4/11/2015,Food was excellent. Our server was named Casey and she was awesome! She seemed really mellow and cool. If I smoked weed I would totally smoke a bowl with her.
Gina B.,"Salinas, CA",42,40,,1.0,10/7/2014,"This place is truly awful. They couldn't even get nachos right - it was literally 6 chips arranged in a circle on the plate with a piece of cheese melted on each and a jalapeño slice. 6 flippin' individual chips. I find no redeeming factor in a place that messes up NACHOS. Also, the service sucks. Food is just not palatable. Avoid at all costs!"
M S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,67,14,1.0,10/28/2014,"Ate here while traveling through Monterey. It was around 9:30 p.m. and just wanted to walk some place. This was one of a few options. Bear in mind, all over the restaurant they now have signs that say ""Fresh"" and the like.  Got the onion rings, a burger with bacon and such, and the healthy choice 6 oz. beef tenderloin.  I only expect food offered by Chili's to be grade D or whatever is the edible rating now as labeled by the FDA. However, their onion rings have to be fully frozen because each onion ring had an onion ""skin"" inside but no real onion. You know, like when you peel an onion and there's that sort of skin that has a bit of a membrane. That's how thick the onion was in every single onion ring and the whole onion ring is actually huge.  The beef in the burger did not taste like a burger. However, the bacon and whatever else was on the burger did taste good.  The broccoli with the tenderloin was good and seemed to just be steamed without butter or oil. I liked that a lot. A big plus while traveling and eating a lot of road food. The small tenderloin was really salty -- must use the salt as the tenderizer because it was extremely tender. I love salt, but I couldn't finish it because it was just too salty so the husband got a few bites too. Is was more or less cooked to the doneness ordered - medium rare. We had wanted dessert but passed since dinner didn't taste good."
Noelle J.,"San Jose, CA",557,881,11402,3.0,3/1/2011,"The World According to Noelle Allergic Girl's Guide to Life Day/Time/Crowd: Monday, 12:30 p.m., Decent Sized Our Order: deep fried onion appetizer  chicken quesadilla chicken crispers chocolate molten cake diet soda iced tea Details: We were seated promptly and our order was taken fast. Food was on the slow side. Appetizer was okay tasting. Entrees & dessert were just okay. It took forever to get the check. After lunch we felt sick. I was fan of Chili's (despite the fact we haven't dined at Chilies since December 2009 in San Jose) but after this most recent food experience we won't be back anytime soon. The food was just subpar. Do yourself and your stomach a favor use Yelp and do a search for a mom & pop restaurant with fresh food :) Noelle's Notes Skip it!"
Smart G.,"Anaheim, CA",2,112,38,1.0,10/26/2012,"Even for a Chilli's this was disappointing.  The food was just OK but the service was horrendous. The guy took forever to come around and took longer than 10 minutes to get me another round of beer. I wish I had written down his name, so you could avoid him in case you were held at gunpoint to have dinner or drinks there. Even though I was just visiting the area (CSUMB), I would never go back to this Chili's."
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,61,19,3.0,7/25/2013,"First off, let's be honest. It's a Chilis.. It's never going to be a gourmet restaurant or have foie gras so we all know it's got what American's love. Burgers, Nachos, Salads, and the like. That being said, this place isn't all that bad. It has relatively quick seating, and the staff I have found to be rather friendly.  As for the To Go options, I had my first experience ordering online, and paying before hand online as well. Unfortunately, when I arrived they were out of the sweet potato fries I had ordered and asked if I wanted regular fries. I was fine with that, but I assumed they would change my bill and refund me the extra money that it cost me for sweet potato fries. Unfortunately I was wrong. I wasn't asked about it and when I did, wasn't offered the money back. I wasn't overly upset because it was a a buck or two more, but still, money is money.  Bottom line, if you go here, go for a sit down meal. The online to go option is a little lackluster. Other than that it's an nice option for some American chow."
Travis H.,"Fresno, CA",60,434,57,1.0,4/25/2014,"Avoid this place is possible. Our server looked like a punk rocker (okay, that's cool) but the problem was the attitude went with it. There was no customer service and once out order was delivered there was no waiter! Food was eh' nothing spectacular and trying to get more salad dressing became the hunt for the holy grail. Drive another exit or two down the freeway, much better choices."
Michael H.,"West Sacramento, CA",440,212,415,3.0,10/13/2010,We came here for late night happy hour on a Monday night and I ordered the Boneless Buffalo Wings and a rum and coke.  The server was friendly and helped out our large group as we just came into town and wanted to unwind.  The food came out quick but my drink was not as strong. I came here the following night (Tuesday) and the server was not in a good mood.  Our group arrived at 10:30 p.m. and we just wanted to have a couple of drinks before we headed back to the Holiday Inn Express to call it a night.  The server was rude and forgot to bring our group chips/salsa.  Last call was at 10:45 p.m. when it was 11:00 p.m. the night before. The three stars were based on two consecutive nights I went to this restaurant.
Amelia M.,"Reno, NV",173,44,1,3.0,6/2/2014,"Not terrible, but could be better. I came in with a group of five and the hostess had no idea how to seat us since they didn't have more than 5 person booths. We ended up having to push two tables together ourselves. Service was slow at first, but once things got rolling it didn't take long."
Bill T.,"Carmel, CA",0,68,,1.0,5/11/2014,"It's a Chili's, and I don't come here for gourmet food.  Came here for lunch today, and the food is expected. What is bad is that all the bar servers are, umm, cognitively challenged and cannot figure out a bill or the touch screen POS system. I feel sorry for these guys; they can't even operate an automated retail machine at Chili's."
Andrea J.,"Atascadero, CA",5,9,3,5.0,9/5/2015,"My and my daughters ate here on a Saturday evening. We arrived right in the middle of dinner rush. The place was packed!!! There was a little bit of a wait, but we were sat promptly. The hostess was pleasant. Our waiter was great! He got our drinks and appetizer order. Drinks were out within 5 mins and our appetizer came out within 15 mins. The food was great. Hot, and exactly what we expected. We eat at Chilis often where we live, but this was the first time visiting this one. I was impressed with the amount of teamwork. Mangers were carrying out dinner platters and desserts. Wait staff were all working together. We had several different staff members visit our table to check in on us. It was so busy and they kicked butt! Even the manger came around and checked on us. Our server was amazing! He was busy and refills for our drinks took a little bit longer than expected BUT he did the best he could and we had no complaints. We will be coming back!!! Thank you Chilis!!!!!"
M D.,"Corvallis, OR",9,18,,1.0,7/19/2014,"Food was standard so-so,  but the real thumbs down was the fact that there were TVs everywhere AND kiosk screens on every table.   Remind me why I was eating out with my family?  Oh,  that's right, so we could be out together.   And then offer to pay on the same kiosk I'd had them take away when we sat down?  Yes we did tip, but beg the question of why and why ever go back?  Once again certainly not for the food."
Guillermo N.,"Seaside, CA",0,28,,3.0,11/20/2014,Long wait good food  at least what I order they need a better happy hour menu for drinks and appetizers.
Kayla M.,"Monterey, CA",30,40,4,3.0,8/5/2012,"I mean, I guess I like Chili's, but I have been eating at Chili's since the time I ordered from the kid's menu. As the food is now good, not exceptionally great, it really is not the same as it used to be. It is decent for the convenience and price though. The food used to be really, really great. Not five star, but not one step above fast food, (which is what it has become now) either. I have been visiting this restaurant for well over a decade, and I have seen about five major menu changes/overhauls.. each time the prices rise, the menu items change, or are adjusted, and the quality of the food is affected poorly. There is no avoiding it. I used to visit for the hamburgers. They came with an amazingly fresh tasting, juicy patty which came packed with all sorts of flavor. Then topped with juicy, meaty bacon, real cheddar, quality bread, fresh, crisp produce etc. All coming together for that certain ""great burger"" flavors giving us that taste our mouth's water for. Their burger nearly had it all, and they have slowly let it slip away.... Now they remind me of a $6.00 burger from Carl's Jr. Well, if you join their email club you get a free queso dip for doing so and receive coupons and notifications for the kids eat free days and what not. I enjoy redeeming the free appetizer or dessert coupons.  The egg rolls are amazing. The QUESO dip is grrrreeat! The chicken enchilada tortilla soups is super good too. Sliders are pretty good. Burgers ok a little dry, inconsistent, some days better than others The Philly cheesesteak is actually not bad if you order no cheese sauce and get regular cheese. It is too greasy the way they serve - even thought thats the classic preparation. Decent fries. Pretty good buffalo chicken ranch sandwich.  Decent bar. Good for a quick/casual meal or drink with out any serious expectations.  I would have rated five stars if it were five years ago."
Rachel D.,"Monterey, CA",2,31,,5.0,6/30/2015,I order food from here often and have it delivered through a local delivery service. Tonight was the best food I have ever had from this Chillis..so good i needed to write a review. I want to give big props to whoever the chef is tonight..the steak was PERFECT! my loaded mash potatoes and corn on the cob were also excellent. I felt like the chef actually cared about the food they offered. Loved it and will definitely continue to order from here!
Tabitha B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,52,1,5.0,9/5/2015,I went here today and I've been here before but this review is specifically for the service I got from Stephanie. She was very attentive and helpful! During my previous visits I wasn't really impressed but she changed it this time.
Charyl D.,"Glendale, AZ",13,6,,2.0,10/28/2015,"Been here twice.  Both times I have received a not so attentive waiter.  Will not leave a tip if I have to flag people down to get refills on drinks.  They bring your food, walk by several times, don't bother to ask if you need something or how is your food..  poor service"
P G.,"Monterey, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/26/2014,"My usual go-to dinner at Chili's has been the Salmon & Grilled Shrimp with broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes (or double broccoli when willing to deny myself the yummy richness of the potatoes). When there last Saturday, I thought I'd try one of the new burger options. Our server, Jessica, smiled with genuine friendliness when I asked whether the kitchen would mind a custom order. ""Not all all,"", she said. So: ""turkey burger, instead of beef, but not overcooked; no bun, but with bacon, crisp"".  Delicious!  Next time, to champion Chili's effort in continuously updating the menu, I will try the same burger in the bean option. Quality and friendliness. Two essentials for building loyalty."
Mary Y.,"Monterey, CA",14,17,1,3.0,3/2/2014,Limited choices and this is a fall back place to eat. It is okay nothing too great. Would recommend if you are out of options. Happy hour has free chips and some deals.
Courtney R.,"Manteca, CA",52,10,6,1.0,9/30/2014,"SAVE YOURSELF, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! by far the worst chilis I have ever been to! I went two years without eating here because it was so bad, I thought after two years it would be better, but nope. Order a sandwich togo, ask for NO MAYO because i am allergic, get home and it was seriously like they put extra mayo on it. Tonight went in with my family, ordered an appetizer,  never got it, i had to actually ask for it when my meal came and it was cold! Ordered two sodas, was only given one, so I stopped another waitress and asked for the other. Ordered a side of the honey Chipotle sauce for my ""crispy"" chicken strips, was given wing sauce instead. The only time my waiter came and checked on us, both sodas were empty, yet he only refilled one! Had to wait up at the front to pay for our check because the waiter never came back. This place sucks."
