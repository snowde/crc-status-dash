Rohit G.,"Maywood, NJ",38,123,224,3.0,12/18/2017,As you all know it is a chain restaurant with plenty of choices and drinks. But what makes this visit special is our server Jonathan. He is the kind of person that makes you feel important and cares for even it is chain/ fast food place. I wish some how Chili's can use his skills to train rest of the staff and make them kick ass. 5 STARS FOR HIS IMPECCABLE SERVICE!!
Sheena D.,"Belleville, NJ",83,35,2,3.0,12/18/2017,"The service wasn't bad. Gentlemen greeted us very courteous. Food was pretty good, the need some better fries though. Overcooked and dry. The drinks weren't great, pretty much all juice."
Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134,3.0,10/27/2016,"I'd try to give it 3.5 stars (see why below). I was on the fence about this spot. I haven't been to Chili's in maybe 5 years, and oddly enough it was this exact location. But I had heard good things about the franchise as of late so we decided to stop by for a late dinner since we were at the expo center earlier. The pros and cons were on & off all night. The restaurant wasn't busy but we still got seated too close (chairs were literally back to back) to another table. The service was slow but when our server was around, we felt like we were getting good attention. But we never got refills and I suspect she left for the day near the end because someone else came to clear our plates and give us the check. No one ever came to take our payment (had to switch from card to cash & leaving). Extra 1/2 star for the manager trying to make things right with our meal. We ordered shrimp tacos but got chicken tacos instead for whatever reason. He was very apologetic & understanding, even took the value off the final bill. The food itself was good - actually a lot better than I remember! And our dessert (molten chocolate cake) was perfect... Moist cake with nicely melty insides. But like I said, service was almost non-existent and we waited for a good 5-6 minutes and couldn't even find someone to take our money. If you're not in a hurry, it may not be a problem for you. Food was still good!"
Sandra B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",57,5,1,1.0,12/28/2017,There are bugs in the kitchen and a roach was in my food!!!!! This place is so dirty and I would never eat or bro g family or friends to eat here again!!!! Disgusting!
Marissa Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",739,1111,1531,3.0,11/9/2016,I only visited this place one time and one time only I think for a neighbourhood lower middle-class establishment I thought that the prices were actually way more expensive than I could ever remember Everyone at our table was very very shocked when we saw our bill  The food was mediocre are the service was mediocre atmosphere was nice and the location is nice but parking is very difficult I won't be returning
Keigo I.,"West New York, NJ",5,94,189,3.0,1/26/2017,"This restaurant is always crowded on weekends. Not quite huge floor and many tables. They are just a normal fast food restaurant, but staffs are nice and friendly. Their soup is always tepid... better ordering tacos or other baked meals."
Wilson S.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",247,2,,2.0,11/12/2017,Terrible service. Takes very long time for waiter to get to you. Food is ok. Chicken cripsy's are always dry when you order the 2 for 22.
Janae S.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",19,40,12,1.0,4/14/2017,"If you dine here after reading this review- I'm judging you! I visited three weeks ago with a friend, I screwed up on movie times (AMC theater across the street) so we had a few minutes to kill. I walked in and almost immediately turned right back out. This place was filthy. Scraps along the floor and a dirty bar. The garbage was visible and piled sky high, it really grossed me out. I had to use the ladies room, which was probably cleaner than front of house--imagine! Left out immediately after use of b/r. Walked out to napkins and a hair tie on the ground. I will not be back!"
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,2.0,9/17/2016,"Just barely passable.  The service was spotty and we had to flag down our server several times.  The food itself has deteriorated in quality.  This was my first time back at Chili's in over 5 years and the quality has definitely gone downhill.   A recap: 1. Original Baby Back Ribs: STAY AWAY!  Dry with a tiny portion of meat and an overly tangy ketchup-like BBQ sauce.  Just awful. 2. Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger: Just ok.  The patty was small and on the dry side although the buttered bun was a nice touch. 3. Skillet Mashed Potatoes: Very meh and on the bland side. 4. Fries: Just ok.  Your standard fries. 5. Cajun Chicken Pasta: This was actually the best part of the meal.  They were able to add some broccoli and it was a very solid dish, overall, with chicken strips and a decently creamy sauce.  No, it's not the best pasta but compared to everything else, it was the winner. Price-wise, portions are small for what you pay and the overall bill including tap and tip came to about $45 for 3 entrees and a coffee (which you should NEVER get here - lesson learned).  definitely heading to Red Lobster next door or driving to a Ruby Tuesday.  At least their ribs are edible!"
Marlo V.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,35,20,5.0,9/18/2017,Great experience at the bar me and my friends ordered chips and salsa and queso those chips are thin and delish.  We ordered this strawberry coconut rum drink it was out of this world and fries with honey mustard.  The bartenders were super nice and attentive
Marvin J.,"Jersey City, NJ",95,6,2,1.0,5/16/2017,"*Review for a visit on Wednesday the 8th of February 2017* I actually enjoy Chili's since they're a little more different than the average chain restaurant focusing on Tex-Mex-esqe fare. The restaurant seemed to have been understaffed for a weekday night which is understandable considering a smaller crowd expectation during my visit. However it took 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us, and after we were seated for 25 minutes without our arrival being noticed by the wait staff I had to find the hostess to ask for the waiter and after waiting another 10 minutes, we just left the restaurant.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to offer a complete review of my experience, maybe it could serve as a cautionary tale instead."
Par S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,1,,2.0,6/12/2017,"It's been 2 weeks and my issue still not resolved. Location Mgr advised that it will be taken care that specific day and it's going on its 2nd week and forget about the promise of returning same day call back... I am finally writing to advise others who visit this location to be aware of the billing/using machine calculated tip!! To chili's, feel free to email me your feedback... I sure would love to hear from you on the matter."
Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",251,682,365,3.0,11/21/2016,"This one was OK.  I did find it slightly annoying that we stood around for about 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged and seated.  Otherwise, it was typical Chili's fare meaning it was good but not great.  Our server was friendly but should have on her own checked back on us on  her own without the need for us to flag her down for something."
Sherl D.,"Newark, NJ",33,4,3,1.0,4/16/2017,"My boyfriend and I came to this location for the FIRST time and it was a big loss.  ** I am not a chillis fan because the food is all microwaved but my boyfriend wanted to try the lava cake so bad and it was little quick bite before catching a movie and we decided to go there and we REGRETTED to the maximum). *p.s my boyfriend didn't get the lava cake because of the bad experience.   (Ronnie our server was OK) he would of been BETTER if he had proper training but I can't really blame him because the so called MANAGERS, Shift leaders or supervisors WERE NOT doing their jobs properly. 1) the hostess was wearing a "" slippers "" like are you at work or in your bedroom???  2)she sat us at a STICKY table and the floor was dirty, and just dropped the menu to the table and walked away , didn't even say anything else to us. 3) WE MOVED to the next table 92 and it wasn't a smart idea because we could see how filthy the bar area was....papers on the floor, the broom and dust pan facing us and 10000 of ""workers"" walking by and not picking them up. YOU CAN TELL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO TEAM WORK OVER THERE.  4) Finally our server Ronnie came to the table 10 minutes later after we got sat .  I HAD TO ASK HIM TO SWEEP THE FLOOR  where my bf and I were sitting because it was gross..... * my boyfriend had the full baby back ribs and when the food came to the table, RONNIE didn't even bring an extra plate for the bones and Asparagus had NO TASTE whatsoever . 5) NONE of the 200000 ""managers"" checked on us to see if everything was ok ..they were too busy standing by and watching the game that was on. 6) a FOUR top came in and the hostess had them sat on the table in front of me and THEY POLITELY asked the hostess if they can sit by the window and THE HOSTESS REPLIED """"""""that section is closed"" like WTF.. you're supposed to satisfied the guests. AND WALKED AWAY.  7) a girl was running food and she was screaming on top of her lungs, HOT DISHES, hot dishes from the kitchen to the bar....like don't you know the plates were hot before you even picked them up????  8) BATHROOM WAS GROSS, PAPERS ON THE FLOOR ALL OVER, GARBAGE WAS FULL 9) some girls (WORKERS) were standing by the bar and taking selfies... and hostess walking with a drink in her hand while sitting people...VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  P.S we only saw 1 girl who was actually cleaning her section (sweeping the floor etc) that was the girl at the bar by the window) she needs to tell her coworkers how to do their jobs.  THIS PLACE NEEDS TO LET GO ALL OF THE MANAGERS WHO WERE ON DUTY and all of the staff who was sectioned at the bar area including the hostess who was wearing the slippers  ON SATURDAY NIGHT  APRIL 15, 2017 . They seem careless and clueless.  IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME TO THIS LOCATION AND IT WILL BE OUR LAST TIME. BECAUSE IF THE DINNING AREA WAS GROSS I WONDER HOW THE KITCHEN LOOKS LIKE."
Ariff I.,"Vienna, VA",16,25,26,3.0,7/30/2017,"5 star to our server but not the management. Toilet were disgusting, kitchen floor was a mess and its only the start of dinner. Managers do you even care bout your workplace?seriousely? The worst Chilli's ive been to! Hopefully you guys read this!"
Melissa S.,"New York, NY",50,90,23,1.0,3/24/2017,This place is absolutely filthy. Walked in here with a friend to grab a quick drink before a movie and upon inspection there were dirty napkins and food on the floor behind the bar. Thats when we decided it was time to get the hell outta there. On the way out we ran down a path of litter on the floor to the exit. Do not eat here.
Sara C.,"Wayne, NJ",165,214,95,3.0,3/12/2016,"As far as the menu and food is concerned, this place is pretty standard. It is spacious and there are plenty of tables/seats around the bar. There were two things that stuck out on my most recent trip here: 1. The ziosk on each table. It allows you to play games (for $1.99), look at a menu, order dessert, log into a rewards account, and pay your bill. We used it a couple times throughout the night and I was really impressed at how it printed a receipt after we paid. The only thing I wish it had was a page server button so you can call one over when you needed something.  2. Our server Louis was amazing. He was very funny, nice, and even helped accommodate dishes. I would go back to this location for him alone."
Lisa R.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,81,1,2.0,10/15/2017,"It could have been a lot better! It was lunch time on a Friday so you would think that the service would be 100% took my mom there and we both got the lunch special! Soup with hamburgers! The soup was not even hot. When our meal came, my mom asked for mayo and the waiter forgot. Another worker came over 5 minutes later asked if we needed anything. She brought out the mayo instantly and then shortly after our waiter came over and said ""oh you have mayo? I was waiting in the back to get it!"""
Mike E.,"Waltham, MA",41,4,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Sat at the weirdly located brightly-lit bar (covered in salsa or some shit), watched the bartender dump a dirty glass out, dunk it in water for less than a second, and make a new drink for someone. I'm pretty sure there are more pint glasses on my coffee table than at that bar.. wash that shit in a dishwasher- 4 thumbs down"
Derek M.,"Springfield, MO",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Shitty ass service, all Latino workers can barely understand them. Sat there for 10 min and someone finally came to get our drink orders. Then once they did it took 8 minutes to get our 4 waters. Just shit service for a mediocre place. Not to mention our glasses weren't clean, they had some sort of food all over the side of the cup. I can not stress how bad the service is. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you because there's plenty of Other options around. Who knows I might be having to write another review after I try my food."
Pam P.,"Union City, NJ",45,4,,1.0,9/17/2017,"so today saturday was 3:00 pm and it's my first time in chillis me and my family immediately walked in, there no one at the door to assign us seats ok. after waiting a few minutes we decided to go in and take a seat by ourselves , the young girl with blond hair who is supposed to assign seat saw us sitting down and not bothering to even give us the menu.  after waiting 30 minutes sitting there all the servers and this girl just looked at us and did not take care of us at any time,  the costumer service of this girl is horrible!!!! She does not want to work!! They are losing customers because she did not want to attend and was not busy where was the manager at this moment? at the end she saw us leaving and didn't say anything we had to go to Applebee's that had better customer service."
Cintia H.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,8,,2.0,5/24/2017,"I decided to visit this location because I did not want to go to the one in Jersey city. Huge mistake ! It was a Friday evening & I understand it gets busy, but we waited about an hour for two meals.  The waitress was very nice & apologetic about being backed up in the kitchen, but I will not be back."
Nate S.,"New York, NY",367,300,211,4.0,10/24/2015,"2.5 stars average..why?? Don't ask me the server's name but he was on point: he made good suggestions and he kept it real about what to avoid including drinks. We came in a group of 4 on a Saturday night at 1145, bar had a last call of 12. He recommended the Tito's punch which I was concerned was going to be too sweet and too fruity..but he kept recommending it, said we should get two each since it was last call.. and he was right..it was strong, refreshing and tasty..if you like rum punch with tequila you won't regret it. Food wise: we based our selections on his suggestions..which were all apps..the Buffalo wings (8 pieces), the guacamole and nachos (guacamole could've used more salt..too bland..saved by the salsa which was good), the chicken and something Flatbread (excellent), and then the egg rolls (beyond excellent). Bill with everything plus a lemonade was $82...didn't feel rushed to pay even though they wee clearly closing as evidenced by them dusting, turning off tvs, counting registers etc..we might as well have been part of the clean up crew. Not a Jersey resident so I probably won't be back..but definitely part of the better experiences I've had at a Chili's in a long time."
Vanesa L.,"Linden, NJ",30,48,37,2.0,2/14/2017,"We were very disappointed this weekend with Chil's in Secaucus, NJ. My friends and I went there after seeing a movie and ordered some appetizers and main dishes. One of my friends asked for a side of grilled shrimp and received a TINY container (it was the size of the containers they use to put condiments) of about 4 baby ""rubbery"" shrimp.  When the waitress came to bring our checks she kindly removed it from my friend's bill.  They should be embarrassed to call this a ""side"" dish.  The service was good and the food came fast, so I gave it 2 stars for that reason.  However, 2 out 4 of us agreed we will not eat here again. The food is poor quality, and the next day when I warmed up my leftovers (boneless buffalo wings) they were not edible (they had a horrible texture and taste)."
Melissa M.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2017,Got some nachos for car side to go and they were awful. They were obviously microwaved and the cheese was hard. There were like 5 nachos and they were horrible quality. Waste of $10
Matt T.,"Chesapeake, VA",14,7,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Worst parking I've ever seen in my life! Drive around for 10 mins, witnessed 3 accidents, so I left!"
Andrea D.,"Union City, NJ",0,6,2,5.0,4/25/2017,Helen was a great bartender! Very attentive and amazing triple berry margaritas! Sunrise burger was delicious and the loaded queso is the best appetizer
Brittany Q.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,,5.0,6/18/2017,Brandon was my server and he was beyond amazing! His energy and politeness was beyond exceptional. He made my experience here magical.
Anggie T.,"Jersey City, NJ",27,9,2,1.0,4/21/2017,I don't give reviews unless I had a bad experience I went today with a friend and my 4 month old daughter I had her car seat I explained to the hostess I needed one of those things to put the car seat in 3 minutes later a gentleman brings it out and I'm trying to figure how to do it and he's just standing not even helping while I'm struggling with the car seat while my daughter is still in there at the end my waitress accidentally dropped some sort of sauce and it landed on me and my purse luckily it didn't land on my daughter but some was on her car seat smh she offered a free dessert but doesn't make up for her almost getting something on my daughter!
Ed W.,"Jacksonville, FL",20,8,,1.0,8/14/2016,"I tried to be very clear that I would like a hamburger with Swiss Cheese, medium rare and absolutely plain. The hamburger arrived swimming in mustard and pickles and over cooked to the consistency of a hockey puck I don't have a lot of confidence in these chains and that suspicion continues."
Gabriela I.,"Union City, NJ",30,3,,5.0,3/11/2017,Love the service and food they made sure they accommodate my family and it's wasn't a problem with leaving my son in the stroller .. overall it was a great experience
Ariam A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",35,9,2,1.0,12/21/2016,"I had a bad experience in this place here I left my navy blue polo hat here , i came back the next morning and asked the waitress that was working here last night, about the hat she eaid she gave it to the hosts , the host is no where   found and eother is my hat , i called to speak to the management and got rejected 4 Times they made me wait an hour to talk to manager , she com's out and says she can't help , my opinion is that the host stole my hat. I'll never come here again or suggest Any of my friends or family to come here , i feel very disrespected the waitress  I was treated and they steal the customers stuff if you leave it behind . Thumbs down for this place"
Eugene O.,"New York, NY",404,428,1582,3.0,5/10/2014,"Average neighborhood Chili's.  I been here quite a few times, for Lunch, Dinner, or just drinks  and watch a game. Parking can be challenging since they share the lot with a bunch of other restaurants and the movie theater.  If you are lucky enough to get a spot on a busy day count your blessings.  I normally run in, get my name on the list to get the pager and then go looking for parking.  2 birds, 1 stone. Restaurant area is nicely kept, also now they installed the Zoosk virtual water sorta program.  You can pay your bill, play games, and order drink refills and desert.  Pretty neat and long overdue if you ask me. The bar area is nice and large with all seats having great viewing angles to watch your favorite games.  It also tends not to be very busy if there is a long wait.  So if you don't mind eating at the bar, which I never do this might be your best bet. Now to the food. Food here is your average selection of Mexican dishes, burgers and ribs,  Everything I order always comes out warm and tastes the same.  Nothing to write home about.  You can always do better if you go to an authentic Mexican joint, but this is Chili's! Beer is cold, good selection,  Bulldogs (Margarita with a Coronita upside down) always hits the spot, especially on hot days.  There is also a good choice of bottled beers.  Drafts are your normal selection of american favorites and my favorite Stella! I had never had a terrible meal or a bad experience at this location.  I will return. Staff is also friendly, young, and accommodating here."
Justine G.,"Manhattan, NY",70,7,,1.0,6/21/2016,"How do I start, i know. Have you ever been hungry after dropping a hard days work for the family at a restaurant? Then you know the feeling. First things first. Half a rack of ribs and broccoli was my order. After half my beard went grey the server is bringing out the food, she then proceeds to give my wife and son their food but as she reaches for my sons plate, there goes my ribs like a body in the Hudson River with cement boots to the floor. I get an oops, not even a sorry. Remember the broccoli? Forget about that i get fries so salty my lips looked like i was 90 after 2 bites. It continues, my wife had a burger that was so greasy the bun turned back to dough and my sons corn on the cob was cold as could be. After i received my ribs, if you want to call them ribs, since i didnt even need a napkin to wipe my hands after i consumed them let alone a wet nap the server disappeared to get my wife her Texas cheese fries that she forgot.  Finally, i ask for the check and then im asked if i want the dessert that comes with my meal to which i reply no. ""Would you like it to go?"" She says. I reply ""i dont even want it to stay forget about to go""  I told my wife even if the dessert was something decent it would have been 3 times the taste of the meal. Worst decision to eat there, save your time and money let alone you stomach for the after party.... you know what i mean."
Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7140,2.0,5/17/2015,"I like the bar area of this chili's. There are a lot of tv's with sporting events.  The location is also nice as its next to a movie theatre and other shopping area. The food however, for lack of a better word, BLOWS. Their fried food all comes with a nasty after taste (the oil is old). Margaritas tasted like pure sugar with no alcohol at all. The boneless wings were 85% breading and hardly any chicken. If you are coming here to watch a game and have a beer it's a win. If you decide to get any food or cocktails you won't be so pleased. Bar service was also quite slow and inefficient. Our server never came over to ask if we needed anything or if all was okay. Good thing we can pay the check on the kiosk instead of having to wait forever."
Elizabeth N.,"Secaucus, NJ",18,9,7,1.0,1/2/2017,We sat down at the bar and the bartender quickly greeted us and gave us our drinks after that it was the most we saw her all night. It took us 45 minutes to order because she was off talking to her friends on the other side of the bar. Every time we needed something we had to flag a waiter down and it was always another waiter that saw us with our hands in the air trying to get the bar tenders attention and would have to go interrupt the bartender talking with her friends and tell her we needed her.  I'm sorry her job is to work not to talk to her friends all night. Even though this is close to my hotel I probably won't be coming back again because her service was so horrible.
Kathleen C.,"West New York, NJ",89,18,8,1.0,10/4/2016,"This place is a complete joke , I went with a group of about 12 people and the waiter we had was completely lost we had to ask for napkins , which we had ask like 3 times for them he never came to our table to ask if we needed anything  he brought the wrongs drinks and all of us got our food at different timing none of us got to eat at the same time and then when the bill came he made all of us stand in a line to pay each part and said only one can pay with card that's when all of us got furious and called the manager and all he said is I understand and am sorry ! Wow I wish I can zero stars"
Ahmed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",663,359,566,1.0,2/28/2015,"Absolutely the worst food I ate even for a chain as big as this. I do not know what happened to the food quality for chilis. I ordered the best thing on the menu the combo with ancho salmon and shrimp. The shrimp was undercooked and the salmon did not taste that good. In addition, the broccoli was under cooked and asparagus was over cooked. Like who is working back there in the kitchen. I barely ate half the plate, paid the check and left. The server could not even recognize the food was bad smh. In all honesty this company is going down. The food quality is horrendous now and I will not come back. This is why the mom and pop shop restaurants are much better!"
John G.,"Wayne, NJ",6,21,,5.0,2/12/2016,Very nice place to eat and hang before a movie! Margarita flatbread and Calif flatbread are great.
L B.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",1,4,,1.0,11/17/2016,"I love the food at any chillis.  It's pretty basic so it should NOT be hard.    This location is THE WORST !!!     It's like my 5th time here, because it's close and convenient to work but def my LAST !!    I'm always alone yet It takes about 15 mins for someone to greet me and no matter what I order it's always missing something, but yet I DEFINITELY get charged for it.    I don't even want to give them a ONE star.    Once is ok but 5 times.   Enough is Enough !!!!!   Get it together Chillis in Secaucus !!!"
