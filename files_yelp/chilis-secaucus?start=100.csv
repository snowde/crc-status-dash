Atul R.,"Union City, NJ",0,50,17,1.0,4/9/2015,Horrible! Bad service. Waiters are just bunch of jerk. Even the manager is 100% lazy and jerk. Not once but Always they confuse our food.
Dr.Navin ..,"New York, NY",0,26,10,1.0,12/19/2014,"I had been to this Chili's at least 5 times till now and every time,  there is no one at the entrance to receive you and help you get seated. They don't care even if you are standing at the entrance for 10 min . Very unprofessional by the staff. Management need to look this up very seriously."
Kai R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,627,,2.0,9/8/2015,"Low rating for one simple reason - HORRIBLE service.  Went for lunch / place was not even close to being busy, but our server was very slow (took 10 minutes before he even came by the table).  Dude could have cared less based on the service we received.  Won't be going back."
James C.,"Jersey City, NJ",89,156,9,2.0,12/25/2012,"I mean its Chili's, what can you really say.  Food is what you expected it to be at a chain.   I will say this.  I went with the gf at an off hour - 4 pm so there was only 1 table in there and most of the staff is on their meal break.  Ok, no problem.  So the place is completely empty.  I'd say 40+ free tables, but the brain surgeon host tries to seat us right next to 2 of the waitstaff in a booth who are yakking it up and eating on their break.  Come on now, use your noodle 1 drop and realize that people do not like to eat on top of other people.  I ignored him and sat elsewhere.  Aside from that it was an uneventful less than ordinary meal as expected.  Food shouldn't take 20 minutes when you are the only table in the joint either.  But hey its Chili's Eff that place."
Panos N.,"Union, NJ",14,2,,1.0,8/29/2015,Came in to have lunch.. Was seated and passed by a totally filthy table that was just there and it seemed like no one cares to clean it. Opened the menu and it was falling apart sheets being separated and totally wet. If that's the first sign of a restaurant that is not a good start. We decided to walk out and go to cheeseburger in paradise. Will not be coming back..could only imagine the ineptness and laziness translating to our food.
Liliana G.,"Belleville, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2016,During my visit i sat at the bar with Angela. When we received our drinks we had an emergency and had to leave. We tried to get her attention but she was speaking to waiters. Finally when she got our check she saw that I had not even touched mine because I had been trying to leave but charged me for it. Then left the bar I asked another server for a manager instead she got the bartender. She came over and asked what was wrong and gave me an attitude. I explained and she said I should've relaxed and just told her no need for a manager. I had tried to call her over many times before getting the manager but was blatantly ignored. Finally when the manager came she didn't even speak to me she spoke to Angela then left. I come to chilis atleast once a week I love it. However I will never be returning to this establishment. She was a Terrible bartender with a terrible attitude being supervised by a terrible manager. I will as well be writing on Yelp because nobody should go to a Restaurant and be treated this way. Terrible experience because of Angela and her attitude.
Viki J.,"Lawrenceville, GA",8,7,,1.0,9/18/2012,"Have been to this establishment twice.  Although it was 2 years apart nothing had changed.   We were seated and waited 10 minutes before anyone came over to the table.  No it was not crowded.  We even had 2 waitresses. We waited 10 minutes just to order drinks. Asked 4 times for a glass of water....nothing.  Felt as if waitress(es) didn't even know we were there.  Placed our orders, 2 meals and a side salad.  20 minutes for the meals to come out and NO SALAD, nor were we given utensils.  As we sit there waiting to eat our meal we had to wait an additional 5 minutes for utensils.   The waitresses seemed rushed.  It was not crowded, we did not go at rush time. I will not return to this Chili's the next time we are in town."
Matt B.,"New York, NY",28,66,35,1.0,12/7/2014,Went in for a quick lunch without checking yelp..... This place is a disaster....service is terrible..... Food was not even okay. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
Slash R.,"West New York, NJ",2,6,1,2.0,11/23/2014,I usually don't have a problem with this place when I eat AT THE BAR ONLY. If u need a table horrible and if u tryin to call in a pick up they never answer there phone calls
Rachel S.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,1,1,1.0,1/11/2015,"Absolutely terrible. DO NOT come here! Came here on a Sunday around 5pm with a party of four. Restaurant was not busy and some how the server Angelica still managed to take twenty minutes to greet us. When we ordered drinks they either came out wrong or did not come at all. The manager who ran our appetizers to the table told us he would come back with side plates and never did. Once the food was finished we stacked the dirty plates at the end of the table and they sat there as numerous employees including a manager, walked by them. Sides that we ordered were missing from the entrees. Water had to be asked for three times before it came to the table. The server was polite but completely oblivious to the poor service and therefore was unapologetic. At the end of the meal when we brought all these mistakes to the managers attention, he simply said he would go to the back and find out what went wrong. We never saw him again! As a party of four, whom all work in the food/service industry, we understand that mistakes happen. However this experience was absolutely terrible. By far the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant before. Which is a shame because I enjoy this particular chain, however I will not be coming here again!"
Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,3.0,5/3/2014,"Chili's has improved so much. Who knew? I sure didn't. I like the new digital device at the table to order drinks and pay for your food. Also, a lot of nice new menu items. I tried the quesadilla explosion salad for the first time. It was very delicious. The dressing was amazing. I have to give only 3 stars overall because unfortunately I was sick as a dog after I left. My stomach was TORN UP for at least 16 hours after eating there. :-( I dont think I'll go back."
Augustus S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,14,1,1.0,6/10/2014,"Waitress asked us if we liked to smoke pot like here, and even told us to eat somewhere else since this place ""sucked"" when I spoke to the manager, he didn't even take me seriously. Never again."
Nadia B.,"Princeton, NJ",360,537,60,1.0,7/22/2012,"I don't rate my terrible chain experiences but my food came out cold, everything was bland, service was friendly but suckeddd with the length of time it was taking to get everything! From our food to the dessert and then the check.  Never.again."
Sam B.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,11,,3.0,8/6/2014,"The food at this place is decent, but ordering takeout on weekends is an exercise in futility.  They don't answer the phone, the site is down, AND your order is never, ever correct.  Not ordering takeout from there anymore."
Stephanie G.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,3,,2.0,2/3/2014,"If you're looking for speedy service, this is not the place to go. The staff is very nice but the amount of time it takes for the food to come out is ridiculous! I should not be waiting 45-50 minutes for chicken crispers."
Lea T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,214,24,2.0,3/24/2014,"Service was bad.  Food delivered quickly, although it didn't look like their skillet queso to me.  The ""cheese"" slid off the chips, leaving a pretty oil sheen on the chips. Chips were good like always.  After waiting 30 minutes with my credit card out, finally had to go to the bar to ask for my check. I usually love Chili's but this one is sad.  Also, the lights in the bar are a little bright."
Pizza M.,"Clifton, NJ",0,59,18,1.0,5/26/2015,"Where do I even begin? Oh,I know where, with the bored-out-of-his-mind greeter who didn't even bother to make eye contact.  I sat outside with a guest just to have a beer on a sunny day. The place was perhaps only 1/8 full at best.  I wondered why all the patrons looked aggravated and all of them around me immediately asked for their checks when the food was delivered. Wonder no more. The waiter came outside four times and did not acknowledge us.  15 minutes later, he finally asked what we wanted to drink.  We ordered two beers.  20 minutes later in the blazing sun...still no beers. I want those 35 minutes of my life back and yeah, stiffed them for the beers.  Stay clear of this horribly mismanaged place and awful waiters."
Juilious B.,"Bronx, NY",1,10,2,1.0,4/25/2015,"so i just ordered via pc to have my order ready at 730, im just confused WHO IS RUNNING THIS PLACE? your in a perfect location so im ANNOYED  by the lack of customer service as well as food preparation, so my egg rolls didn't come with any sauce, no napkins ,utensils plus i order two BOWLS of chilli and received two CUPS, chilli is 6 dollars a BOWL, the lack of effort is amazing, i clearly see now ordering online or seating at this location is a waste of time and effort, A BUNCH OF MORONS"
Zach P.,"New York, NY",0,237,2251,2.0,8/16/2013,"I am from Texas, the birthplace of Chili's. I was really disappointed with this Chili's location.The food was very bland and not as flavorful and delicious as any Chili's in Texas. I don't know if it's just one of those things where it's not as good because it's Southern food in the Northeast or what, but I was just not a happy camper. They were lacking staff and we could never find our waiter when we need him."
George L.,"Kearny, NJ",0,3,,1.0,4/10/2015,"Horrible! On my way to the bathroom, I regretfully caught a glimpse of the Kitchen. I am never coming here again disgusting! I finally get my plate, the food was half eaten; instead of giving you a new plate, I guess they just see the nearest leftovers that looks presentable and stick it in your order. DO NOT COME HERE! Friendly staff but poorly managed and extremely dirty!!!!!"
