Daniella K.,"Union, NJ",0,10,1,2.0,5/5/2014,"This is supposed to be a fast food place....could have fooled me! It took 45 minutes to get our food and at least another 15 minutes to pay. Server did not come to check on our table or offer us more water or drinks. We came here for lunch expecting it would be quick because there are a lot of offices around, but that was not the case. Oh and they have these stupid trivia things here now to distract you from how long it takes to get your food!!"
Nicole D.,"Bayonne, NJ",33,2,,1.0,3/13/2013,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! From the moment we walked in to this dump! Waited 10 mins to be seated. The area where we were seated was loud. We got our drinks pretty quick. The beer was probably the best part of our visit. My chicken crunchers were filled with NOTHING BUT GREASE! My fries were cold, but the corn was good. My boyfriend steak was purple, Mac and cheese was frozen and his mashed potatoes were SUPER COLD! Manager was nice and deducted the entrees and also gave us a free dessert - but this will NOT bring me back! The couple next to us also had issues with there food so it wasn't just us!! Sad that it was our first time and also our last!! I DO NOT recommend this place AT ALL! We should have went Red Lobster and we don't even like sea food. But anything would have been better than this!!!!!"
Food L.,"West New York, NJ",9,135,,2.0,4/5/2013,"There are many reasons I don't come here.  First off it's a wanna be mexican/ american chain.  I usually don't enjoy any fake mexican joints (chipotle is the only exception).  Then their portions aren't what they seem to be.  My wife ordered a baby back rib rack, and it was tiny.  It must've been from a just born cow.  And i had some type of chicken finger dinner.  I knew it was going to be lame, but man did they over do it!  The servers themselves aren't bad at all, but the food and their portions can really throw me off.  And apart from this, this parking lot gets full fast on the weekends at peak hours.  One thing that is good are the tvs....plenty for everyone who wants to watch a sporting event."
Maggie L.,"CORONA, NY",7,217,98,4.0,2/26/2013,Good food. No matter how long the line is I feel like the wait would be approx 30 mins. Which is not bad compared to other restaurants that makes you wait 1 hr. Good finger food. People should try their fries with cheese and jalapeno. They staff are really nice.
Damian S.,"Dumont, NJ",188,252,272,2.0,9/1/2012,What can you say? It's Chili's. The name (if you've never been before) leads you to believe it is a Tex Mex place....it's not...it's mainly burgers and ribs....and for that their name is forever inexcusable to me! Their ribs suck.....their burgers are okay and benefit from a tasty roll. The only time I ever come here is when there are no spots at the bar at neighboring Cheeseburger In Paradise....sorry to be blunt but it's true.I've been here four times and all four times I only ended up here because CIP was packed.
Doa O.,"Edison, NJ",1,6,,5.0,8/5/2014,I used to live in Hudson county but moved to Edison. The local Chillis in north brunswick on rte 1 is dirty and the service stinks so I travel all the way up to secaucus when I want to eat at chillis. This place is clean prompt polite service and the food looks like the picture in the menu
Uni R.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",4,1,3,4.0,3/23/2014,"Husband and I are regulars here lol.  We always sit at the bar, bartenders are always nice and friendly. The food is great and margaritas are a ++++"
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,3.0,2/6/2012,"Nothing special or out of the ordinary will be found on the menu here, but maybe that's what makes it a safe choice. I would never decline an invite to meet up at a place that serves delicious, pretty blue margaritas. Wash down some chicken fritters, or anything deep fried from the menu, and ya got it made."
Julia W.,"Milpitas, CA",215,449,3,2.0,5/4/2009,"As much as I love Chili's, this location was one of the not-so great experiences I've had.  The food is on par with all the other locations in the nation but the service was really slow.  Still, our waiter (Edgar) was smiling and really eager to make sure everything was okay. Too bad that our chips didn't come out with our drinks and the lemonade machine kept breaking.  It took forever for us to get our food and our check, causing us to miss our starting time which made me miss my flight back to California in the end.  If you do decide to eat here, make sure you don't have a time constraint!"
Patriot ..,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,41,2,2.0,6/14/2014,This place is not good . The people working there are second rate . The food is brutal .$70 for family of four . It's just not worth it . At least 5 better choices right in that area. From the enchiladas to the tacos . Not good everything taste like it's from a can . Chipotle Bdubs Red Robin Outback hell even Houlihans is a better option . You can take your family twice to Chipotle for that price with a much higher quality of food. But the table made Guac is good. Service ok.
Tamara O.,"Queens, NY",39,151,29,4.0,11/8/2011,"Decent food at a chain restautant.  The service was great though! Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and helpful.  We ate here during happy hour; certain drinks were half-price and our appetizer was free."
Ashley Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,,4.0,1/27/2012,"In my opinion, it is a good chain restaurant for Mexican food. I ordered the Quesadillas which is new on the menu. The food is very good quality and healthy."
Jim B.,"North Bergen, NJ",84,90,6,5.0,12/14/2011,"Appetizers are GREAT and reasonably priced....combined with great happy hour drink specials, lots of TV's in the bar area and friendly staff, this place rocks!"
Vincent T.,"Glen Head, NY",45,39,,3.0,11/1/2011,Regular chain restaurant with the same food and menu as every other restaurant in the chain. The great thing about this location is that the bar area has a great staff that make everyone feel like you at your local water hole.
wilbur l.,"Union City, NJ",21,41,,3.0,7/9/2011,"good old american chain, like it for its fast service and their 2 for $20 dinner deal, which includes a quite tasty burger or a generous portion of cajun chicken alfredo pasta.   All heavy stuff, but what do you expect from a chained-restaurant?"
David B.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,28,,1.0,12/6/2013,My Girlfriend and myself order curb side every wed night and every time I have to call the manager to take my order because the four prior phone calls that I made just rang and rang and rang... We did this for seven months!!!! I'm finished now..Heres a great  tip Chilis STOP HIRING 17 YEAR OLD KIDS TO ANSWER A PHONE...They are clearly too busy playing on other devices such as smart phones or tablets to mess around answering resturant buisness lines.
Nell H.,"Denver, CO",1,6,,1.0,3/26/2013,"I hate giving only one star, but this place deserves ZERO stars. Chili's in general as a chain has gone FAR south and I won't ever be visiting one again. This one in particular was disgusting. My grilled chicken sandwich was cold, the bread was stale, the lettuce was brown, and it was served with 10 cold fries. The service was bad, we did not have one waitress but a couple different waitresses that failed to refill drinks or attend the table at all. The manager is rude and non-accomendating. Overall I suggest you avoid this place, it's not worth your time or money."
Rohan V.,"Secaucus, NJ",42,5,,1.0,11/20/2012,"Worst service ever. Steak was stale, sent back twice n frustrated.. Never again"
BTT D.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",0,59,55,4.0,11/13/2012,"""GREAT service! wifey ordered steak medium came out a bit well done..so had it changed and it just came out perfect plus 4 ppl came over just to check the steak came out ok this time GREAT FOOD for $20 didnt expect anything to be this good for a chain and for $20k for 2 ..."""
Devin K.,"Secaucus, NJ",1,65,,2.0,12/22/2010,I don't know why I continue to go to places like this. It is 100% forgettable like most of these chains.
