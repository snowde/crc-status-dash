Marianne S.,"West New York, NJ",0,107,,5.0,11/10/2011,"I go to this Chili's location quite frequently. Service is fair, slow in some cases from what I have noticed. Their food is delicious and the surrounding atmosphere is pleasant. The host/hostess and wait staff are very knowledgeable as well as for friendly. Friends and family of mine have reported all positive experiences. I will certainly be returning. Prices are decent, parking lot gets rather crowded because of the surrounding restaurants sharing a single lot."
