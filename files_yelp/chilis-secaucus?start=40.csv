Christina J.,"North Arlington, NJ",0,1,,1.0,5/19/2017,"Food isn't bad but it's not the best I went with my friend and sister and had terrible service I'm a waitress and know that you should always be attentive with your tables, but this guy wasn't! I tried once again and there was still horrible service had to tip because it's the right thing to do but it wasn't deserved!!!"
David H.,"Falls Church, VA",324,1217,1892,3.0,10/24/2014,"It's an average Chili's in a large outdoor mall but when you've been in the car for an hour in NJ traffic from the airport to the hotel, average chain food tastes mighty good. I had one of the chicken and rice bowls with some salsa, vegetables, etc.  The service was very friendly and they didn't try to rush us at all, but then again it was around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon so the place was empty. They have these new high tech handheld tablets so the waitress was able to run the checks right at the table....at least until it broke as she was using it.   Chilis's food has declined over the years as their prices have increased but for average chain food this location did its job."
Andrew C.,"Jersey City, NJ",82,83,15,1.0,8/2/2016,The worst service ever. The drinks were late the food was late and some of it never even came out. The waiter hardly ever came to our table to check if we need anything. Even after everything was said and done it took them more than half an hour to bring our check. I will not be bring anyone here. If your reading this right now don't go to this chills.
Dani P.,"Arlington, VA",77,712,534,3.0,1/5/2015,"We came here because Secaucus was convenient for our travels, and it was somewhere that a group of 6 girls could find something for everyone even with vegetarian/gluten-free etc restrictions. The food was fine and the service was good. One of our party members decided to treat all of us which was wonderful of her, but somehow the restaurant charged her for the wrong table's bill! They caught us as we were leaving so that they could correct it."
Millette D.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,39,69,4.0,1/31/2015,"Second time here in 5 years. The first time was a not so good experience that I couldn't bare to come back but years have passed its time to burn the bridges. Natalia our dearly great server, we never really had to ask for anything she kind of just read our minds, my bf would tell me we need more napkins and out of nowhere there she goes with napkins, I whispered to my bf, Babe you need another soda, Natalia within a semi second with full cup of diet coke. Ok so it's not mind reading but it is good service.  Since when did the menu change? It really is completely different from the past, CHANGE IS GOOD! I ordered under the under the calorie menu, Salmon with steamed broccoli and citrus rice, I regretted it the moment our server left, WHY WOULD YOU ORDER SALMON IN CHILIS? so I had very low expectations uhmm I was wrong it was very well seasoned, not dry at all, for under 600 calories I can  have that salmon everyday. My bf had some smoky bbq bacon, well he didn't leave a crumb. Semi pickled pickles with dill I believe , WHOA I can eat a plate of those and go home satisfied. I'm a Spinach Dip kind of sore (lol) I order it everywhere and that was the only one I wasn't really a fan of, the chips were heavily salty and the spinach dip came in a skillet but the middle was cold BUT all is forgiven I can deal with the salty chips I will be back again in less than 5 years I promise :)"
Juilious B.,"Princes Bay, Staten Island, NY",36,4,,1.0,10/1/2016,"This place is a JOKE  like seriously a joke!  A coworker and myself decided to grab a bite , walked into establishment was greeted and seated within a min (this was the only positive interaction) waited for about 15 mins before I decided to find a waiter/waitress 1 strike  After waiting another 25 mins just for two beers and water we deceived to just place everything in at once ( that's strike 2) the wait for food was about 15 mins which is totally normal , my co workers food came out cold ( she ordered a burger and a side salad) my food came out on a dirty plate  A DIRTY ASS PLATE , I said to the waitress who had to be about 18 and clueless to life and a job ""what the hell is this "" she looked as if there wasn't a issue , I immediately returned my food and asked it be remade and sent out on a CLEAN WHITE PLATE , 5 mins goes by my food returns on a clean BUT   food wasn't remade at all , The food that was currently sitting before me was in fact the same contaminated food from the dirty plate  I requested the manger explained to him about my horrible situation and he decides the meal is on him , DO YOURSELF A FAVOR SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS AND FIND A BAR THAT  SERVES  FOOD WITHIN YOUR LOCAL AREA , THERES ALOT OF HIDDEN  GEMS AROUND"
Rashid M.,"North Bergen, NJ",366,1,,1.0,9/1/2016,This place was terrible I walk out on a table full of food. We sat more than an hour for burgers we didn't eat. They said they forgot about us manager was unapologetic and lacked leadership. The fries were cold and had a ton of salt on them. My sons burger they microwaved it and the bun was hard and burn when I showed the manager she said you want me to get a new bun. No you should have ran to get a new burger. Who wants to pay for food that is handled like that. She doesn't deserve to be a manager. She is clearly a worker. This place has fallen off badly I would never go again and I suggest you don't either.
Jane M.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,32,1,1.0,7/15/2016,"I have never given a place one star before, so you can be sure this place deserved this. Don't even know where to start. Fajita was cold and mediocre at best Quesadilla lacking veggies Pick 3 entrée was just tortillas covered in cheese Service very slow! Couldn't pay with cash because the server just didn't come back so I paid with credit card at the table and left. Not going back."
Jeff B.,"Bergen County, NJ",142,154,10,2.0,6/13/2016,"The service is friendly, place has a nice enough atmosphere, but compared to similar chains that are all in the same general area, the food just doesn't match up to say a Houlihan's, Red Robin's, or Ruby Tuesday's.  Kind of my last choice among such chains, and I'm not saying this to be unkind but simply to provide impartial information to anyone in the area looking for a bite to eat and considering between local chains.  This one is not altogether unpleasant, but taste-wise it's just not one of the better ones compared to other choices in the area."
Brian O.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,,1.0,8/18/2016,Horrible service and food the fries were stale and ice cold laterally could not eat it and told theserver and he said sorry and walk away to only return with the check not good. Management sucks i will never eat here again
Jessi D.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,8,,1.0,8/18/2016,Worst service ever I ask for chicken quesadilla not onions and it had more onions that chicken I told the waitress about that and she say to sorry and she said do you wanna to go !! What parts of  not onion they don't understand!!!! I will never come back this place !!!!
Joe K.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,19,,2.0,8/6/2015,"The reason for the two stars is that the food was decent and they got the order right.. The problems were that the service was terrible, the server came back once to ask if we wanted more drinks (clearly to run up the bill and get a bigger tip).  Our food was either microwaved to sitting under a heat lamp, it was certainly not hot or fresh. This was during an early Tuesday evening as well, they were certainly not crowded."
Ian S.,"Sacramento, CA",322,272,308,3.0,5/14/2015,"Stopped in to grab some food to go real quick. Burger and a salad bowl took :25 minutes at 2:30 in the afternoon (well after the lunch rush) and when I got back to where I was going to eat they hadn't given me any utensils to eat the salad with. Grrrr. On the plus side, the bartender comped me my arnold palmer while I waited. Once I did fine a fork, pretty decent chipotle chicken salad bowl."
John C.,"Mississauga, Canada",253,344,1615,1.0,7/18/2012,Bad BAd Bad... This is the first bad review I have. We went to a Chilli's in Chicago and that was a 10/10 but this time around it was a 2/10. The food took  a long time to come out and when it did they gave are soup / app with are dinner all at the same time. Soup was good the steak was cold . The worse steak I have had in a long time . They offered free desert . But I did not go there for desert so the fail. I would think twice about going back to Chill's. It looks like I am not the only to complain about this. So good luck to you if you go here.
Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",377,300,2058,4.0,5/21/2014,"This place is in a great location. Had dinner with friends here and drinks while watching the Miami heat and Indianapolis pacers game.  The waiter was attentive until we were finished with our meals. He didn't check on us during or after. But it was super nice of other waiters to keep asking us if we needed anything. That was really kind of them. Used the Ziosk to reorder our drinks and it came in no time. That was awesome. Their frozen margaritas are really good. They have raspberry, strawberry, and mango. The strawberry was out of this world. Best flavor in my opinion to choose. Well I didn't try the raspberry one but strawberry is a ten out of ten.  The southwest Mac and cheese and burger bites were fantastic. The Mac and cheese has chives and something with a spice in it that separated it from regular Mac and cheese. Also the cheese is so creamy and the noodles so soft. It's a great side dish. The burger bites happy hour item came with two mini burgers and fries. The burger meat was so fresh. It tasted like they grind the meat, mold the burger, then freshly grill it to order. It was super super good. It comes with bacon and cheese and a side of ranch which was the perfect condiment to put in the burger. Great night here watching the game. They put the volume up so you can get in the sports mood."
ML T.,"Manhattan, NY",86,22,5,1.0,4/9/2016,"I'm sure you've read the reviews that start with....""If I could give this place no star at all, etc.."" Yeah, this is one of those.  I dislike the fact that I even have to give it 1 star. Horrible, horrible service. We live in NYC and I was craving that molten lava cake. I used to live in florida and they have a chill's in like every corner. But coming  back home, I couldn't find not one chilli's in the city. I googled it, the nearest one was this location. Which is about a 30 minute drive more or less, plus toll. My point is that it was so NOT worth the drive or the trouble because I didn't even get to have my freakin molten lava cake and I'll tell you why in a second. This was a couple weeks ago btw. Just hadn't had the time to sit down and write these paragraphs of how horrible the experience was, till now. Warning: This is a long review but worth the read.  Our waiter was so unprofessional, young kid and probably didn't know any better. He kept calling me sweetie after taking my orders for appetizer and entree... ""ok, and what would like to drink with that sweetie."" While my boyfriend was sitting there next to me. If it was the other way around and a female/waitress was calling my man sweetie, it would annoy me. It was just strange and as I said unprofessional. Like hello kid, you aren't with your friends hanging out somewhere. You don't know me on a personal level. I hate when people try and be extra friendly to get a better tip. Just do your job, get our orders right and attend to us in a timely manner and you will get a good tip. It's simple. There is a more professional way of doing things. This a business. Period. Moving along, I ordered the chicken alfredo or something with pasta and ok yes, it is a fast food restaurant but I really had no idea almost everything was microwaved. It tasted like a frozen tv dinner. I could have stayed at home and cooked a phonemail meal instead of eating this garbage. I didn't even take two forks at it and I was immediately looking for my waiter to tell him I didn't want it....he was nowhere to be found. I saw him 10 minutes later by the bar talking  and laughing it up with his coworkers, I kept putting my hand up and trying to make eye contact with him and nothing. Didn't even look our way. So I caught another waiter on his way back from serving a table near us and asked him to get the manager bc my food is horrible, I wanted to try and order something else and my waiter is nowhere to be found. (Wish I remembered his name.) Manager came over, I pointed him out and she apologized, admitted to the pasta being frozen and microwaved and said she is surprised we are compiling about one her best waiters. I said listen, the kid is charismatic but he's slacking. She comped my meal and asked if we wanted dessert on the house. I said ok yes...I'D LIKE A MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. (You know the one I had been craving and drove these miles to have after my meal) She said no problem we will get that for you in a sec. She apologizes again and walks away.... I guess she went back to tell the kid we had complained about him and how he didn't provide not even decent service. The kid walked over to us and said he was pulled aside by his manger. Is there anything else he can get us. My boyfriend told him straight up, no thank you, dude, you're a horrible waiter. I thought it was harsh but it really was horrible service. He was without a doubt offended, he apologized and walked away. ....guess who came to bring us our dessert.  The kid!!!....and he came to our table with the meanest face and his tone of voice sounded like he clearly had an attitude. I felt like I was back in high school. smh. My boyfriend and I looked at each other. The same thought crossed our mind.  WE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT EAT THE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. The kid probably spit it in or something. We got up, left the cake on the table and left. I was so angry for like 2hrs over this freaking dessert. Kept telling my boyfriend he should have waited till after dessert. lol ugh."
Dino L.,"Jamaica, NY",13,6,,1.0,6/18/2015,"Horrible! Don't go here!!! First time here- I was traveling in the area with two business partners today and decided to get a quick bite to eat here. I should have walked out when we walked in and didn't get any service for 15 minutes- I mean there was absolutely no one at the front check in. A couple who were there before us left a few minutes after we arrived, grumbling under their breath about something. I didn't quite catch what was up but suspected that they were waiting for some time to be seated with out being approached by anyone in the restaurant. This is exactly what happened to us as we waited at least 15 minutes without so much as a ""hello"" or "" we'll be right with you""... Zero acknowledgement. Finally the bartender came over and seated us...she just seamed completely disengaged- no smile, didn't ask if we wanted drinks or appetizers.. No personality. This was embarrassing as this was a business colleague visiting from Georgia and it was just an embarrassing representation of the NY/ NJ area. Again this was just a quick bite and chance to rest up and talk shop. Unfortunately not only was the experience poor, one of my colleagues became ill apparently from the food and we had to cancel evening dinner plans.  To the franchise owner- get with the program, customers are walking out! To Chili's - get your corp people down to this location and kick this restaurant  back into shape they are killing your brand or pull their franchise license- this is probably going to get worse without intervention"
Damali C.,"Katy, TX",3,27,1,1.0,6/16/2016,"My stomach hasn't been right since I ate here. First, we stood that the little entrance for a while, waiters passing us, looking at us but not seating us. So here comes the manager and he reprimands them for not seating us. We had a young server, fine but he was uninterested in serving, seems to like socializing with his coworkers. We had a good size party-6 of us, but the food take a little while to come out. Food was hot, classic American, he did keep the soda coming. Dessert was tasty as well. So later that night the stomach assault began. I'll save the descriptive language, but it was horrible. The kids were saved, they only had a touch of it. In general, the service at the restaurants around the hotels is horrible, the food is not far behind."
Desiree D.,"Edgewater, NJ",1023,762,1071,2.0,5/12/2015,"Ive had better service in other Chilli's. It always takes forever to get something, HOWEVER i do enjoy how they added some little machines to make orders (for drinks and other small items) to  some of the tables. I havent seen this at other Chilli's yet."
Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1227,709,908,3.0,3/4/2014,"3.5 stars. Definitely a plus for the nice service here.  Our waitress was very attentive and really took care of us very well.   The food was served quickly and came out just right.  I'm a sucker for their chicken crispers - gotta love the fries and corn that come along with it.   As always, I only go to Chili's once in awhile as a guilty pleasure.  The drawback of eating here and other chain restaurants is that the food can be exceptionally salty.  But hey, if you're looking for a quick, no-brainer kind of lunch this place will do the trick."
