Kenna M.,"Jersey City, NJ",96,229,31,4.0,4/19/2014,"Randomly decided to grab lunch before seeing a movie at the Kerasotes theater next door. We were the first few patrons - this this might explain the quick service and food carefully catered to our liking.  I had a medium ribeye - it was $16, with a side of broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes.To be honest, I was pleased. I didn't expect to be amused by a steak from here, but I give them credit for making the steak medium, being sure not to overcook it. Its been a consistent issue of mine, especially at TGIFridays (Bayonne), which makes me iffy about ordering steaks at ""slow fast food"" places. Boyfriend had a smokehouse burger - included bacon, cheese, and friend onion rings - plus all other vegetable fixings. He was satisfied - very.  Here's the highlight of our lunch - It was BOOZY. We ordered margaritas - house ($3-ish) and flavored ($4.50) whaaaaat. Even better, they have these new tablet things for each table where you can reorder your drinks (or order a dessert). Needless to say, we left BUZZY. It was convenient. Even more convenient (I'm on the fence about), for the parent whose child relies on technology to behave, you can pay .99 cents to activate the games on the tablet.  Hopefully our future visits here are just as nice!"
Alberto B.,"North Bergen, NJ",2,21,37,4.0,2/20/2016,Nice food like always nice environment great price  the fajitas was great and the  the sirloin was ummmmmm great
Anthony P.,"Boonton, NJ",28,84,22,1.0,2/28/2016,"No wifi.  Bad food.  Badly cooked and over priced.  $4 for chips?  Really?  Come on.  For a Mexican place you'd think they would at least give you chips for the table.  One of the dishes was a salad featureing rubber chicken.  When told,  they took off the prorated 50%. Come on really? From what I've seen,  this company isn't going to be around long."
Denise M.,"Union City, NJ",37,2,,2.0,5/18/2016,I've been to this location several times due to my office being about 5 minutes away. The service is always terrible. I ordered Chilli's to go. I was told 15 minutes for pick up. I gave them 20 minutes. I sat in the to go area for about 15 minutes and no service. A waiter walked in and out and did not great me. I waited about 35 minutes before I was able to get my food only to be disappointed.  I won't be coming here anymore.
Jared F.,"Coplay, PA",17,201,57,5.0,4/7/2015,"We stayed nearby at the Embassy Suites, were hungry so I ordered Chili's to go via their website. Went at the appropriate time to pickup the food and the guy at the counter was very polite. Nothing was an issue, prompt service and everything was done as ordered. Will gladly order from there again if we're back in the area."
Sonia P.,"New York, NY",4,25,3,2.0,1/29/2016,"Meh - I was really hoping this Chili's would not disappoint but it was mediocre at best. I ordered mashed potatoes as my appetizer and they were amazing to say the least. Perfectly seasoned, cheesy, just enough garlic, and a great cilantro garnish. My boyfriend got buffalo wings as his appetizer and said they were amazing and cooked perfectly. I think the manager or assistant manager took our entree orders - my boyfriend got a smoked chicken burrito and I specifically asked if they did vegetarian enchiladas and she said yes so I went ahead and ordered an enchilada with black beans, onions, and peppers in it. My boyfriend said his burrito wasn't seasoned enough and was way too salty - it was mediocre. My enchiladas were dry and they were not stuffed with black beans like I had asked, but instead stuffed with broccoli (and onions and peppers) which I had not asked for. The enchilada was a little tough to eat because it was so dry... Isn't there supposed to be sauce smothered on the enchiladas?  Probably wouldn't come back here again."
Raul C.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,4,,2.0,5/3/2016,"Amazing food i always go and order the 35 dollar course for 2 people which includes 2 margaritas one appetizer one main course for 2 and dessert. Last time i went i had very bad service with the server. Jared the server that night was lost forgot about our food, forgot to bring my food non spicy, i asked for dressings on the side which they never came. He also added the desert in the bill at the end. I had to remind him for the second time it was the special of 35 dollars. He took for ever to change the bill again. Other than that food is always excellent but service sucks"
Omar K.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,7,,1.0,10/27/2016,"I have just returned from the most horrible restaurant experience in my life. We walked in around 7PM tonight (3 adults, 3 kids). Waiter took our order and appetizers came out about 20 minutes later. No plates not enough straws. Never got plates until complained to waiter 3 times.  Kids, especially my 2 year old, were starving. 2 year old has food allergies so limited options. We had put in order for chicken nuggets at same time as appetizer order. After 800 hit my son was eating decorative lettuce off of appetizer plate he was so hungry, as main courses had not come out. We were assured by waiter chicken nuggets were coming out right away. 810 hits and no main courses. Called manager who insisted nuggets were coming out immediately.Made major fuss at which time manager says we dont have to pay for meal. This does not solve problem of my 2 year old still starving. They have no answers for food delays.  All the while we see 2 parties who came in well after us get food, eat, and leave. Perhaps this was a case of racism, not sure.  Unacceptable experience. Will never go to this Chili's again and suggest you do not either unless you want to traumatize yourself and your kids."
Anu G.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,3,,1.0,9/5/2016,Extremely poor service. The waiter never came back to check. Food came after long wait and was cold. We will never go to another Chili's again.
Tolga A.,"Secaucus, NJ",75,17,,5.0,3/5/2016,Amazing food and great drinks everytime. Love their selection of healthy meals as well. Also never had any bad service so that's just a big plus.
Rosa M.,"Paterson, NJ",5,24,21,5.0,2/6/2016,"I love chillis, their food is amazing. I always go with my boyfriend on our dinner/ movie, however we come here & we go directly to sit at the bar. We love Desirade, shes the best bartender there. So friendly & always on point. Last time we where there, there was another female bartender, i forgot her name, thats how much she was around lol! Her service was terrible. She wasnt around we had different people comimg up to us doing her job! I put in a drink thru the zioks & it took for ever. Funny how she was doing drinks but never saw my drink ticket. She kept dissapearing. I didnt like her attitude either. So we just going to  make sure desirade is there for now on."
AmanS G.,"New York, NY",1,26,2,4.0,7/9/2015,We usually go here quite often...partly because its near to where i live and partly because they have decent  food and service.The quantity per person is decent as well.Their 2 for $20 usually contains very decent options. It gets crowded a bit on weekends so if possible go their on weekdays.Also you get happy hour beer during weekdays.
Michele T.,"Bloomington, IN",147,58,292,1.0,9/25/2014,"We went in to grab some dinner and there was no one at the host stand.  Being that both my husband and I used to work at a Chili's we sat at one of the tables in the bar since they are usually seat yourself.  The server passed us a few times then repeatedly spoke with what looked like the manager while they both looked at us. We figured they were busy (though the restaurant wasn't) and waited.  We figured someone would be by to wait on us or at least ask us if we had been helped.  Nope! That server, other servers,  the manager and bartender all took notice of us sitting there not being helped and did nothing.  Some passed us multiple times.  What got us was that the manager choose to stand around and chit chat with the servers rather then inquire about the guest that were sitting at a table for over 10 minutes without being greeted.  Finally we just got up and walked back to the door.  We passed both the server and manager who said nothing.  We mentioned to the host that we hadn't been waited on and he didn't seem to care.  At that point we had had enough and went to another restaurant in the complex. I was really surprised by this experience,  especially from a corporate restaurant.   on top of that they are in a complex with many other restaurants and should want to stand out when people are choosing where to dine."
Andie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,597,4,2.0,9/25/2015,"Lapin, Nika, Johnny and I came here one night for a group dinner. We were seated rather quickly and there wasn't much of a wait. Lapin and I ordered the Triple Dipper (Spiced Panko Onion Rings, Boneless Buffalo Wings, and Boneless Honey-Chipotle Wings). The food came out in a decent amount of time (felt like forever when you are hungry) and it was tasty enough. We were still hungry so we ordered the Chipotle Chicken Flatbread and it never came. We had to follow up three times only to be told that they ran out of Flatbread. When we checked the digital menu that was on the table, we saw it was still on our bill. We had to follow up with two more times before they finally removed it. Johnny and Nika got  the Wings Over Buffalo, which wasn't breaded but looked broiled. The wings looked meh and meager like there was hardly any flesh on it. They liked how it tasted though.  Nika got the mix and match fajitas which came with a lot of food and Johnny ordered steak. The food was decent and around par with other American chain restaurants of this caliber (Applebee's, TGIF Fridays). Our complaint was the lackluster service we received."
H S.,"Dumont, NJ",33,31,,1.0,8/24/2015,"Worst service ever, seriously what is going on with this place? My husband and I came in for a quick bite on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was empty but was teeming with employees, none of whom seem to have any interest in.....well, anything. Our waitress actually got rude when we needed a few minutes to order and then took forever to come back to take our order. When we finally got our food another half or or so later, it was disgraceful. This is a chain restaurant, there's no excuse for the quality of what we were served. Needless to say we never saw our waitress again and paid using the tablet on the table. I should mention that the place is also filthy, from the tables to the menus.  To boot, watch your things at all times. The lady at the next table left her phone on her table for less than 2 minutes and when she realized, she came back and was told ""oh no one found a phone at your table."" I told her I watched her waitress clear the table and when she asked again, the phone ""magically"" appeared. This Chili's is a disaster. Stay away."
Laura A.,"Totowa, NJ",73,7,12,2.0,7/2/2015,"Food was old, tables were unclean. They were understaffed for a 4th or July Holiday???!!! It kinda doesn't make sense. This place always disappoints."
Kaila L.,"Ridgefield, NJ",320,9,8,1.0,6/27/2015,"This is a HORRIBLE branch of Chili's. Customers do not feel welcomed. A waiter did not approach our table after beating seated for 15 whole minutes. AWFUL EXPERIENCE at this branch. If you're at Harmon Meadow, just go to the neighboring restaurants. Chili's was such a disappointment. We just left from our empty, unattended table. I was looking forward to their ribs but I refuse to pay anything toward a business that doesn't respect their customers."
Yennifer G.,"Jamestown, NY",13,39,9,4.0,12/5/2015,This was my first time in chilli's. I gave it 4 stars because I waited about 15 minutes to be approached. It was a Friday night so I know it was very busy. My waitress was very nice. She got one of my orders wrong (asked to have jalapeño removed) but it was easily fixed. Overall the food was great.
Lisa M.,"ELMHURST, NY",63,2,,4.0,11/26/2014,"Every time I come here I have a nice time.  The food is good, the waiters are nice. The only thing is when its crowned they take longer to serve you."
Samantha R.,"Little Falls, NJ",13,14,3,1.0,4/25/2014,"Usually I wait until after my meal to write a review, however, this has been such a horrible experience that I feel the need to type this mid-meal. My boyfriend and I frequent the Chili's in Totowa and while we don't have GREAT service there on a regular basis the food is always on point. We usually order the margarita flat bread, sweet potato fries and a few beers. Tonight we tried the Secaucus location because we were catching a movie. However both the kitchen AND staff failed to deliver. After waiting over 20 minutes for a round of beers (because there were no clean beer mugs) we waited 30 minutes for our apps which came out cold! The server while pleasant lacked any personality whatsoever which was a bummer especially since you couldn't hear/understand a word she said. Needless to say I would have done much better damage control. I would give them half a star if I could"
