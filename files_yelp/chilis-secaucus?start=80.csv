Christie M.,"New York, NY",229,57,114,4.0,9/7/2012,"My roommate took four of us out to this Chilli's last night because she had a $50 gift card she needed to use. I know Chilli's is a chain, but I haven't been to one in a while and the food was better than I remember it being.  I give this Chilli's 4 stars in the category of casual dining/chain restaurants. I mean, I know this is no five-star place, but if your looking for some good bar food at a decent price, I have to say that Chilli's is a great option. The spinach and artichoke dip was delicious, and my burger was great. I was ecstatic to find they had grilled the bun in butter or oil (that's the key) prior to assembling the burger. I topped the patty with swiss, avocado, and bacon (which was crispy and cooked just right). I washed it down with a bud light draft and felt very satisfied- maybe too satisfied... I definitely ate too much.  I have to say that Chilli's was a win, especially since I only had to pay half price."
Chirag P.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,1,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Came for late afternoon lunch, received my apps after my lunch, charge me for soup which I received after my meal. Waiter and manager never apologize for their mistake that they accepted as fault. Also it's not like it's busy where they can't service.  Good luck to all who comes here"
Alex L.,"Morristown, NJ",0,56,4,1.0,7/27/2015,"I expected better for a chain. Went to Chilis a few days ago and had one of the worst experiences 1) Waited for over 5 minutes to be noticed and seated a table; there was roughly 10 people eating at that time and no one in front of us.  2) When finally seated, there were fresh ketchup stains on the tables and a dirty steak knife; definitely did not clean the tables before getting seated 3) The food came out very salty; overheard the waiters mention there was 1 cook in the kitchen and had to rush out orders 4) Waitress ignored our requests for extra napkins and condiments; had to ask other waiters for them Like the other comments said, terrible service; definitely needs improvement."
Joe P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Awful! Poorest service I've had in years. The place was not busy, we were sitting next to the bar and it still told 15 minutes for a beer. I was so close I could have poured it myself! Awful staff, had to walk up to the manager to order ice cream for the kids and they still over charged it to us! Just stay away!!"
Danice Z.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,4,2,2.0,12/20/2015,"Food is kind of fast food type,  not sound and taste like maxican food. Okay to go once a year to have different  taste"
Thomas K.,"Rutherford, NJ",78,502,401,3.0,11/12/2012,"FYI for you vegetarians:  not much to chow on here, maybe a couple of apps, and they'll sub a bean patty for a burger. Service was good and the atmosphere was comfortable.  It won't hurt to eat here, but more variety of meatless stuff would be appealing."
Josh S.,"Portage, IN",0,6,,5.0,7/18/2016,"Food was good, service was wonderful, whenever we needed him he was their! Not from the area the one buy us is terrible! I would recommend this one to anyone!! Definitely better than Red Robin down the street."
Delia R.,"Passaic, NJ",11,23,6,5.0,7/25/2015,"Bravo! We were seated promptly, not like Houlihan ' around the corner. Service excellent"
Kyle O.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",90,286,217,2.0,6/3/2015,"Chili's has good food, new menu items, and nice servers. But the host and manager here are awful.  Small Asian young guy didn't have a clue how to seat people or assign his servers to tables so we sat outside for 10 minutes with no menus or water or help, until finally a server just picked up our table. It is not hard. Seat us, give us menus, and assign a waiter, that's your role. No apologies were given, and the table was so wobbly it was impossible to eat there, so we had to move ourselves to a dirty table. Awful management..."
Jennifer L.,"Albuquerque, NM",81,369,405,2.0,2/27/2014,"Yikes.  Service here gets 0 if possible, but my food was pretty good/average for Chili's.   Don't come here in a rush, or if you want refills, or if you like when the waiter/waitress 1. pays attention to you or 2. asks how your food is (just for the sake of asking, not because we're going to discuss the quality of Chili's Tex Mex Tacos or whatever the hell they have) 3. offers you the check when you've been done eating and your napkin has been sitting on top of your plate or 4. again, if you want refills."
Catalina F.,"Miami Beach, FL",489,26,17,2.0,3/31/2016,"service is brutal, no hostess to seat you. only come here if you have plenty of time on your hands because you will be waiting for a while. only 2 people working (feel bad for them) alternating between about 20 tables. food is okay but not great, unfortunately new menus doesn't mean better food .."
Elizabeth D.,"Hillside, NJ",6,19,,5.0,7/10/2015,"Nothing but good things to say about this chili's, as soon as we arrived someone helped us to a table and the waiter came right to us! The food was delicious great lunch deal!!"
Mhari E.,"South Orange, NJ",1,9,,1.0,9/10/2013,"I like Chili's food, but I hate this particular Chili's. Screw this place. It's progressively taken a downward spiral into restaurant hell. The last two times I was here we waited almost 45 minutes to get our food, and one is from the curb side pick up. When we finally got our food, I was so anxious to get out of the hell hole that we just dipped as soon as it came out. Of course, they forgot my salad dressing for my salad, and messed up my bf's order.  The other time we went there, it was for a simple dessert. WHAT DESSERT TAKES 45 MINUTES TO MAKE? To top that off all the workers try to avoid my death glares so they don't have to explain the wait. They look like they are socializing with each other more than they are working.  Oh and beware of slippery floors, saw some lady beast at management for face planting due to the slippery floors.  The cups have handles for reasons, use them and stop dropping drinks on us.  I will never go here again. -___-"
Rdg J.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2016,"Awful, nauseating hamburger was so disgusting I will NEVER go there ever again. Bartender couldn't care less and went so far as to say dismissively, ""it couldn't be all that bad"". Hamburger tasted as if a miscreant in the kitchen was deliberately trying to create a garbage meal on a bet. Save your appetite and go to a quality DINER or to a franchise restaurant that is managed competently. I am not disparaging the entire Chili's chain, rather I am specifically disparaging this Secaucus Chili's and its management that permits such trash food to sporadically be served at the bar."
A K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,,4.0,1/31/2015,"Nothing beats two hot skillet fajitas sizzling with pork and chicken topped with grilled peppers and onions along with sides of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and hot sauce! The entrees were 2 for $20 and came with our choice of appetizer. We ordered chips, guacamole and salsa. The bowl of chill had freshly topped mozzarella and cheddar cheese that melted and tasted so yummy because it was hot! The waitress was friendly and checked on us often and we gave her a nice tip for being nice. Needless to say we will be back. The only suggestion I have is to turn up the heat in the winter. Otherwise,  it was a pleasant experience."
Michael G.,"Union City, NJ",7,7,3,2.0,4/25/2015,"The food is good, if they can manage to get your order right and bring it to you in a timely manner.   The first time I went here was at lunch time and for whatever reason it was deserted,  so we actually managed to get our food.   Two other times it was too busy and the staff gets overwhelmed very easily, with the manager having to cook food.   The food still didn't come out on time even with the head of the establishment manning the grill!  Finally I just did a ""To Go"" order where I got about half the actual amount of chili I was supposed to get.   So yah,  I would skip this place because there are so many good restaurants in this area that I've had so many great experiences with."
Franco B.,"Jersey City, NJ",68,108,535,3.0,2/4/2014,"I've come here a few times and I admit that the service might be a little slow but the food did not disappoint. The waiters were nice and helpful. We got the margarita grilled chicken and the original chicken crispers. We were satisfied with our order. The food was not cold like I read previously. We would come back again.  They finished renovating the dining room, looks great!"
Daniel F.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,9,1,1.0,6/22/2013,"If I was allowed to give less than one, I probably would. Simply because, quite literally, nothing happened there.  I went here with five of my coworkers, got seated, and then nobody ever came. For twenty minutes we sat and waited, just idly chit chatting. Nobody came. No drinks, no orders, no hellos. We all made separate eye contact with the people working there as they walked by our table but never stopped. After twenty minutes, we decided to go to Cosi near by. Truthfully, the food was probably better and cheaper then whatever we would've gotten in Chilis, but also much, much faster.  Come to think of it, maybe it was their way of telling us that we should completely avoid Chilis. Message received and understood! Never again!"
Robert J.,"Mebane, NC",0,7,3,1.0,11/11/2014,"Open tables everywhere at 8:30pm and told I'll have to wait 25 minutes or sit at the bar.  When asked about the open tables I was told the kitchen was backed up.  I asked what the difference was of ordering at the bar versus a table and the host didn't know.  I asked for the manager and Leo showed up, folded his arms and asked 'is there a problem'.  He made no attempt to accommodate and gave me the GM's name if I was unhappy.  Apparently the GM, Salio, supports the horrible service.  Too many options in the area...stay away!"
Jenn S.,"Montclair, NJ",13,34,,2.0,6/26/2013,"Chili's? More like Takesforeversi's! The food is okay, but the service is always so slow. If you've only got an hour for lunch, try any of the other restaurants in the plaza."
