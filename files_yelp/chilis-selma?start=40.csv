Keith A.,"San Antonio, TX",484,93,32,4.0,9/29/2010,"I hate to admit it but the service, the burgers and the entire experience was great!  I was always told ""Chili's"" and similar chains were the ""devil""  and death to mom and pop businesses but it is what it is...We had a great experience."
Sarah D.,"Castle Hills, TX",1,29,,2.0,3/11/2010,"I actually didn't mind chili's too much. However, my most recent experience was shocking. #1 They did away with my favorite nachos.  That's pretty much the only thing I eat there. #2 The server had us sitting there (without asking for drinks or anything else) for about ten minutes. #3 When she DID arrive, she annoyed us. ""Hey, what can I get you to drink?"" (me starting to think) Uhh ""Oh, I don't think we have uh, we might have um but not uh."" After we ordered our drinks, and she scampered off to get them, we walked out of the restaurant."
Frances S.,"La Vernia, TX",0,1,,4.0,6/30/2010,"The food is always good, even though portions have gotten smaller.  I especially liked our Chili's because they still had a smoking area in the bar.  I respect other peoples right to not smoke and think there should be separate rooms in the nicer chain restaurants."
Robert L.,"Schertz, TX",5,1,,5.0,7/29/2011,"After a long hot day, my family freshened up and went to Chili's.  To be pampered, spoiled, and fawned over by such a positive, courteous staff with such wonderful attitudes changed our day to one of bliss.  All that, even before we were served a variety of divinely tasty dishes that we could share with one another while we enjoyed a newly found party atmosphere!"
