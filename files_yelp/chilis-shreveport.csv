Saxony G.,"Metairie, LA",0,4,,2.0,12/30/2017,This is the second time I've come here way before close and i have bounced back and forth between the to go station and the bartender just to place a to go order....that's absolutely ridiculous. After i informed the to go hostess that the bartender sent me to her she proceeded to be rude and tell me she was cut but would still take my order....i had to go back to the bar to pick it up the bartender didn't acknowledge me or ask if my order was placed. Your team needs to have better communication about to go orders for customers especially when you all aren't busy it looks bad... Mattie a server in the bar recognized my frustration and made sure my order was brought out in a timely manner and asked if i needed anything she's the only reason i will return to this establishment.
Summer G.,"Shreveport, LA",6,5,7,1.0,12/19/2017,Sad. Staff is horrible. Takes forever to get anyone to take care of you. Hardly come back. Sad to see this place go down.
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,3.0,6/24/2017,"In general, i like Chili hamburger and fries. Sometimes, depending upon the cook and the restaurant location, the fries will have seasoning on it. Today they were void of seasoning. Oh well. I hamburger was hot and fresh, however when i actually ate it, it started to cool down, why? Glad you asked. I ordered it with mayo. Sandwich ain't a sandwich without mayo. The waitress forgot. Then getting the drink order, appetizers etc...to her other tabled, my hamburger sat, waiting on mayo. Didn't know it came with a ton of mustard on it thou. I just used my knife and scraped it off. The drinks were good. So this wasn't the best trip although i am pro chilis in general and i will go back."
Anthony G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,2,1.0,11/3/2017,Horrible! How do you make ice tea taste so bad?!? Using grey water?? And how does a Chili's Restaurant serve cold Chilli????  It must have been the cold cheese heaped on it. Hard Pass on this location.
David B.,"Maud, TX",12,98,216,3.0,5/2/2016,Another chain that does a great job of being consistent. We had a great lunch with excellent soup selections and tacos.  The sweet tea was fresh and delicious. I like that they adjusted the air conditioning to match the outside cold air temp. Many places will leave it cranked up no matter the outside temp. I didn't freeze during my meal.  The server was helpful in suggesting items and attentive throughout our meal.  Nice clean location and I would return.
Kelly D.,"Bossier City, LA",0,7,2,2.0,6/15/2017,Very unhappy!  We ordered Cajun chicken pasta & chicken Fajitas.... his pasta came out with very little sauce and no piece of garlic bread which is expected. My fajitas were bland.. the tortillas were brought to me not warmed up at all and the side dish of black beans were no were close to being warm!  Disappointed & will never go back!
Brittany N.,"Tampa, FL",36,170,22,1.0,12/13/2015,"Before coming here I saw that it was rated 2 stars on yelp and thought 'it's a chilis, how bad could it be?' Never again. We walked in the door and were greeted slightly by the two girls standing in the front. We sat in the bar area because we thought it would be quicker.  Our server was HORRIBLE! Worst service I have had in a long time. She wasnt genuine at all, didnt check in with us often and just didnt care. She dropped or food off at the table and began talking to the table next to us. The food came out at a decent time after we order but wasnt a little warmer than room temperature. Overall the experience was not positive at all and I will never be going back."
Billy Joe J.,"Shreveport, LA",1159,660,16246,1.0,6/28/2015,"Sometimes you're just doomed from the get-go. Fate sends you spiraling down a path that you didn't plan, nor intend, and yet it leads you to the most unlikely, and unexpected of places, and in this particular instance also the most undesired.  So, as it were, we set off on a Sunday afternoon for our preferred destination of local neighborhood Tex-Mex haunt, El Potrillo, and upon entering this other restaurant, we were informed that their credit-debit card machines were down, and they could only accept cash or check? Ok. Cash. Who carries cash on their personage these days, and check? What is this, Little House on the Prairie? The Waltons? Here's my hand-written promissory note for dry goods and services. So, we exit El Potrillo unfulfilled (and unfilled) and unsure of where to go next. And there was this Chili's right across the parking lot. It didn't seem that busy and there wasn't a wait, and I can quite honestly say, I have not been to a Chili's since at least 2009! It's just not really my scene. But here it was unexpected and convenient.  Upon a quick look through the menu, I knew I was in trouble. No lunch menu or specials on weekends. (Of course!) and there is virtually nothing, NO-THING, that doesn't add up to at least about ten bucks a person on their cheesey menu. Not a burger. Not an appetizer. Not a one of em ain't staring back at you for less than ten bucks! Really! And when did appetizers become comparably priced to entrees? Remember when apps were at least a few bucks cheaper? Just ridiculous!  So, I ordered the skillet queso and a bowl of their Chili. Two of the cheapest items I could find. The queso was a revolting, tasteless, brown mushy goo of a disaster! Ugh. Ick! The bowl of chili came much later, cold to the touch of the palate, and the cheese wasn't even melted on top, it was still recognizably grated into individual shards, and was as disgusting and as tasteless as the queso, but the chili went the extra inch with a negative temperature and a yucky, all-too-chewy texture, that makes one wonder, 'Is this really beef, or could it be something else?'  I got the bill for just my end and with tax and tip, I walked out completely unsatisfied, disappointed, and mostly revolted for a bill over $15.00.  This experience not only turned me off of Chili's maybe quite possibly forever, but also from eating out altogether for the time being!  It was soooo nastyeee!! : ( So gross! Worst fifteen bucks I've ever spent, ever!  I'm equally as mad at El Potrillo and their unreliable credit-debit card machines and I blame them at least partially for unwittingly sending me Into this horrific dining experience! Muchas Gracias, El Potrillo!!"
Tieon O.,"Shreveport, LA",128,172,829,4.0,4/16/2016,I love this place! The  food is very good. The alcohol beverages are great!  The customer service can be a hit or miss at times. Over all this is one of my top 10 places to eat good!!
Bobby S.,"Shreveport, LA",26,26,28,1.0,6/21/2017,"Waited until the rest of our party was served to tell me that they were out of large tortillas for the smothered burritos. I grabbed drive thru on the way home. Definitely will not return, if my family insists, I'll just stay home."
Leah R.,"Bossier City, LA",42,49,12,1.0,11/14/2016,"Went here on Nov 11 at around 6pm. It was a little, busy and I expected a delay in service, but it was too slow. Our server was cordial, but his service felt rushed. He rarely stopped by, forgot to give my kids their utensils, and our food was lukewarm as if it were sitting for a while. Unsatisfied with my dinner, I ordered a molten lava cake because how can that be messed up? Well it was! The cake arrived warm. I knew it had not been thoroughly heated all the way because the chocolate core was still solid. Ugh! I did see the worker in the back heating up the cake in the microwave. While it was heating, she opened the microwave and attempted to squeeze another plate of someone else's cake in with ours! I clearly saw what happened from our table. We will never be back at this Chili's location again."
Chet S.,"Bossier City, LA",0,6,,3.0,1/3/2017,Feels a little dirty and old but the 2 for one beers are good. Food is good. Especially the aps
Joel M.,"Shreveport, LA",5,62,118,2.0,4/10/2015,I've been here many times over the years and sadly the experience is always forgettable.  The food is only mediocre.  The service is usually good and the staff are usually polite but the food is just not very good.  A major downside to this restaurant is the noise level.  It is so loud in here you can't even carry on a conversation with the person sitting across from you.  There's no door to the kitchen so all that noise added to every table trying to scream over each other added to the mediocre food makes this an experience you could totally pass on.
Danielle M.,"Shreveport, LA",71,17,1,1.0,11/2/2016,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Took my family to eat here. Waitress was always missing. Had to get up and ask for refills, plates, silverware, everything. Even after waiting a long time for waitress each time. Came back another night and waited 10 minutes to be seated. No one even acknowledged us. WE WERE SEEN, we were not, however, helped or acknowledged. When my family and I decided to just go somewhere else, the bar area waitress looked up at us and smirked. No one planned on helping us- we wasted our time waiting. I will never come back here again. We went to Applebee's instead and they were so very kind."
Mike A.,"Chicago, IL",41,696,246,1.0,1/8/2015,"This review will be short and sweet: Came in on a Tuesday night and after the hostess wiped down the seats and table; sat down.  - Waited 10 min for waiter.  Told him I was ready to order, placed order for soft drink, app and dinner.  - Waited 15 min. No sign of soft drink,  saw the waiter deliver a drink to another table. After 25 min of just sitting looking at an empty table: WALKED OUT; telling the hostess to inform my waiter to cancel the order. The place was not busy, so to completely ignore a customer is unacceptable. Based on other reviews, I assume the management at this location is clueless!"
Tricia G.,"Bossier City, LA",66,110,78,2.0,8/10/2015,"Thought we'd grab a quick bite here after a long morning of shopping. Unfortunately, there was nothing quick about it. Despite lots of empty (and dirty tables) and lots of waitstaff standing around, it took a while for us to be waited on, and longer to get food and drinks (about 45 minutes). I sent my chili back after it came so cold that the cheese wouldn't melt and full of chunks of fatty gristle.  Absolutely disgusting. The server was ok, but seemed indifferent and would disappear for long periods of time.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are much better and healthier options nearby."
Carlton C.,"Shreveport, LA",4,31,2,1.0,3/29/2016,Sat in Brittany's section for over 20 minites and was never asked by any of the servers if we had already had our drink orders taken and we never even saw our server. Worst service I have received in a long time. I will not be going back to this Chili's.
B L.,"Flower Mound, TX",14,86,10,1.0,7/18/2016,"This chillis is the worst chillis I have EVER been to.  The service is a hit or miss, but the food is truly disgusting!! Every meal I've had here has been  a major disappointment. Taste like everything was frozen at one point. I avoid this place like the plague."
Jeff N.,"Bossier City, LA",1,5,,1.0,4/9/2015,"I will not be eating at this Chilis any time soon.  The whole restaurant seemed dirty and humid and there were bugs on the table.  Also, It took the appetizer (chips and queso) 30 minutes to arrive, the drinks were wrong, and the main course arrived after an hour and did not include the French fries which arrived 20 minutes later and was only for 1 person instead of 3...probably would have been longer had I not said we were about to leave.   Food is average and not worth the wait for the price and poor service. I also would like to mention that they messed up the order on the table next to us as well."
Luai B.,"TX, TX",2,12,2,3.0,7/25/2015,I think the food looks better than it tastes  .it was not bad but it is not good .they  had good service I think it is cool you can play on an iPad and order on the iPad and pay on the iPad . I had fun .the steak is the best
Jason C.,"Fort Smith, AR",17,17,8,1.0,11/25/2014,Worst experience I have ever had at a Chili's restaurant. Placed a ToGo order and showed up at the time stated on the order. Took 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge your existence at the Take Out counter. Several other customers waiting for their orders as well. My order was finally brought out 15 minutes after the promised time without any apologies for being late. Horrible customer service and I will never be returning to this location. Go somewhere else and hope for better service. The manager should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant.  At least they got my order right.
Melissa M.,"Orange, CA",14,46,,1.0,12/26/2015,"This was horrible, not at all up to the standards for the chain.  Table was dirty,  floor was sticky,  and service was horrible.  The hostess greeted us, said 5-10 minutes, seated in 30. Funny, she told everyone 5-10 minutes.  20 minutes for the drinks to come out after we asked the waitress if we could order and had to ask again to order appetizers and food. Waitress carried the bottle beer to the table tucked under her arm. Another waiter brought the appetzers out, cold. Go to another location, this one is horrible."
Liz M.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",70,30,3,5.0,7/5/2015,Perfect service from Fatina.  Light style steak for 400 calories and spicy tacos were delicious.
Don'Chunte F.,"Dallas, TX",1,16,,1.0,6/20/2015,"The slowest service ever. We even witnessed a table of teenaged girls getting poor, rushed service. This is after they had to wait an extended period of time for their food. Don't bother."
Gary R.,"San Antonio, TX",5,33,18,1.0,2/16/2014,Pi$$ poor service and not bringing what the menu promised has ended my sojourns to this sad excuse of a restaurant.  I regret that I succumbed to the social pressure of tipping!
Roger S.,"Logansport, LA",0,10,8,1.0,3/14/2016,Came in on a Monday night. Took 10 minutes to get our drinks. Restaurant didn't seem busy at all. I know you can't expect much from chilis but oh well.
Holly W.,"Haughton, LA",16,34,70,1.0,9/29/2014,"Worst Chili's I have ever been to. Outside was dirty, trash cans needed to be emptied, plants all dead in the rock beds. Inside looked dirty too, our table looked like it hadn't even been wiped down, most of the empty tables were either dirty or needed to be wiped down. Waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to at least get our drink order, but no one came. We decided to leave. Wasn't busy, now I see why!!!"
Andrea R.,"Shreveport, LA",1,17,7,3.0,8/27/2014,"I like chili's, but today they messed up almost everyone's orders for the Chili's ToGo. When we called, they wanted us to come back but we were already back at work. A coworker went back to pick up the corrected food. They redid the whole order that was completely messed up. The manager was James and he was very helpful and kind."
Rachel B.,"Shreveport, LA",11,8,,1.0,8/24/2014,Terrible experience here.  We waited 20 minutes for chips and queso.  Complained to the manager and we finally got it.  The waitress then took our order- we waited 1 hour for our food.  When we got it we sent it back.  My friends hamburger tasted like salt on a bun - literally and my fajitas were cold.  It was 1 o'clock on Friday.  They were not busy - just super slow.  We won't ever be back! :(
Courtney A.,"Bossier City, LA",4,12,,4.0,5/2/2013,"The service at this location is always good. The Bossier location its kinda like a hot or miss. Lol But, this past time my boyfriend and my oldest daughter went and it was spectacular! Our waitress always had a smile on her face. She never let our glasses reach the half way point, our food was brought out hot and fresh!"
Sarah M.,"Bossier City, LA",8,17,34,1.0,10/13/2013,Horrible Service!! Water in the women's bathroom so hot it burnt my hands! Never again!!
Bill S.,"Dallas, TX",81,348,33,3.0,7/27/2011,"Yeah it's a chain, but it's also Shreveport so this is pretty darn good for Shreveport.  When I'm out of town Chili's is one of my ""go to"" places that I can count on for a decent, familiar meal."
Jes-a-saur M.,"Hollywood, FL",8,23,5,1.0,4/10/2012,"Went here on a Monday night.  Ordered tacos.  Didn't even get that order right.  We had 3 waiteres that night and even then they didn't check on us and we Had to  repetitively wave them down  to get drink refills and it took forever trying to get the bill. Food was ok.  Wanted chipotle sauce, asked twice but they kept bringing me BBQ sauce instead, wtf so i jus gave up cuz they obv didnt know their sauces. Overall BADDDD service..  wont be going here again..."
Cristie C.,"Bossier City, LA",30,29,2,4.0,7/29/2012,"I was never much of a fan of the chain, but this one is pretty good...especially for the area. The price is good, and I've never had a bad meal. The 2 for $20 deal is great. We usually get the Texas fries...they are really good. And I like the chicken fajitas. We've had good service."
Vanessa R.,"Skull Valley, AZ",1,37,2,1.0,4/26/2014,"This is place has everything wrong with it. We walked in and all the empty tables were dirty, the booster seat we were handed was covered in grease and salt but the waitress pretended she didn't see us cleaning it off. Food took almost an hour to get to us and that was in 3 trips with the last person getting their food almost 20 minutes after the first. My grilled shrimp tacos looked nothing like the picture and they were definitely not grilled, they also came with a nice little piece of bone. We were only comped for part of my meal since I didn't find a bone in the taco I ate, the rice or Beans. Never again will we come here, I should've known from previous reviews to go to the Bossier one instead but this one was so much closer, definitely not worth the 5 minute drive we saved. Avoid this location!"
eric r.,"Longview, TX",0,12,,4.0,4/7/2011,"It's the same as most all chilis, cool, laid back place to eat and hang out with friends and fam. The food is decent and they have 2 for 1 drink all the time, u just gotta sit at the bar."
Jerome L.,"Nashville, TN",515,3,2,5.0,5/13/2010,"I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE Chili's  it is an awesome place to go and relax and enjoy a good meal. All of the servers are friendly and the food is amazing. My favorite entree is the cajun chicken pasta. I also love the chocolate molten cake. I would recommend this place to my Best friend as well as my enemy. Everyone should try,"
