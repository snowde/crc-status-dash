Zohra G.,"Niles, IL",249,71,19,5.0,12/27/2017,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for here yet as I've literally been coming for over the last decade!  Chili's has NEVER done anything but please me and everybody I come with! Their service is PHENOMENAL!!! I can literally go on and on at how amazing our server Alesha was on my last visit and we had a tiny glitch with the bill that the manager Terrell fixed instantly and kindly for us! I can literally go on and on about their service alone but I'm sure reviewing the food would also be helpful! Their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers (or even the Honey Chipotle wings) are amazing! They are my go to for many years! They added a Roasted Street style corn option on the menu which is delicious! For app, we usually do the triple dipper with their southwest eggrolls, onion rings, and honey chipotle chicken wings. The eggrolls are not your typical eggrolls, they are filled with lots of good stuff like corn and spinach and have a pleasant, spicy kick to them. The tostada chips and guac are always on point with their warm chips too! I've had the mango lime grilled chicken a couple times as well, their fajitas and quesadillas, and almost all their soups and salads and they NEVER disappoint!!!! I could literally eat here everyday!  For dessert my go to has always been the molten chocolate cake.... it is literally to die for!!! They came out with a mini molten and also a caramel molten but all in all, the regular Molten Chocolate takes the cake! Their other chocolate chip cookie a la mode dessert is good too. All in all, I can say great service, great food, and reasonable prices. I am, as always, super pleased!"
Julie Ann I.,"Skokie, IL",148,95,321,4.0,12/2/2017,"Actually a great place for dinner for a chain restaurant, I Love the volcano chocolate cake. My friend and I have been having dinner here before we watch a movie and we like to order the meal for two deal, share an app, each has an entree, and share a dessert. You also have an option to add a margarita which is good. The portions are pretty large for a meal deal.  The ribs was cooked perfectly had it with house bbq sauce. My friend had the bbq chicken quesadillas (they gave her alot) and I can't gush enough how I love the volcano cake! If I didn't need protein I can so totally have the cake for dinner.  Service is good, we usually stay by the bar. Love the tablet machine thing on the table where u can order your food. Which is good if it gets too busy and the waiter gets bogged down. Plus you can pay using the machine and you can easily split the bill too!"
Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194,3.0,11/24/2017,"The only thing i like at chili's is their fajitas. Service could be A LOT better. Waitress forgot we existed. Food is okay, nothing spectacular. Not authentic either. They tend to have false advertising.... because last time i was there, right as you walk in there was a sign saying ""kids eat for free on Tuesday"". Well, it was Tuesday and my daughter's meal still showed up on the receipt.  And for some reason, the women's bathroom always looks like it got teepeed... :/"
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,3.0,5/24/2017,"I love and hate this place. They make good food, but one day you can be lucky and get great service/food and then another day you can get the worst there's ever been. There's no in-between with this location.  I will keep coming back though. I like their chicken."
Raul T.,"Chicago, IL",40,58,,5.0,8/5/2017,"I must confess that I love chilis Chips and Queso appetizer.  I ordered this while waiting for a friend to meet me for lunch.  Our lunch date was planned for 12 noon, so I arrived at 11:50 to secure a table and order us a celebratory margarita.  My friend just learned that she is going to get a job with NASA.  She will help space ship development for some lunar mission.   WOW!  I sat down and ordered the chips and queso.  It came out quick.  10 minutes pass and I am half way through it.  Then another 4 minutes pass and I am scraping the bottom of the bowl.  No problem, I asked for another order.  She arrived 19 minutes late just as the new chips and queso arrived.  I demurred when she asked me to dig in.  We polished off that plate and ordered fajitas.  I wasn't hungry so I took them home.  I later had indigestion. 5 stars for QUESO!"
Joanne B.,"Skokie, IL",120,295,56,3.0,2/2/2017,"I have been coming to this Chili's for many years. The food is decent, and you can get a lot of food for really cheap. My biggest issue with this location is their crowd control. if you come after 6 pm on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait. Unfortunately, it is so crowded that you cannot get a seat at the bar, and you may not be able to sit on the bench. Also, you do not want to walk away for a bit to do shopping in Village Crossing since they may call your name and put you at the end of the list.  The servers also seem overwhelmed at times. Our last server was great, but you can tell she was exhausted from all the people."
Patricia F.,"Chicago, IL",19,120,334,3.0,8/6/2016,"Great deals on the two for 20.00 Service was ok. Food meh. Company was the best. Nice lively atmosphere nice energy. Steak tastex bland and my corn was luke warm at best on the ends. Bbq sause tasted like a tangy tomato ketchup. Not great, not bad...just meh."
Francis F.,"Chicago, IL",163,417,4432,1.0,12/29/2016,"It's not that I don't like to wait to be seated, but what makes me mad is when the person you make a reservation over the phone says it's 20 mins and when you get there it's another 15 min wait. Apparently Wednesday night seems to be busy for them... Unfortunately, after we got seated we got an additional 7 min wait before our waitress saw us. My nephew got kids meal pizza, I really liked the Boneless buffalo chicken salad but the Southern smokehouse burger which comes with Chili's signature BBQ sauce I didn't like the BBQ sauce; however, the burger was OK! And seriously more waiting when all I wanted was a refill for my nephew's drink and a to-go styrofoam container and possibly better BBQ sauce. After paying I just wanted to leave and what made it worse is after I paid and clicked for a copy of receipt, the tablet went into a reboot...I would have to reconsider going back here."
Michelle Z.,"Chicago, IL",15,38,40,5.0,5/10/2017,"I had a great experience here! The service was very quick and attentive. I didn't have to wait a long time and server was quick. I got an appetizer for around 13.00 and it had boneless wings, cheese bites, and egg rolls. Everything was very delicious and well cooked. Came with three different sauces and was so tasty. Good appetizer or even lunch plate to eat."
Jeff g.,"Chicago, IL",1,48,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I've been coming to this Chilis location for 7 years. But this year I have been asking my wife why we keep coming to this location. They made the menu smaller which is a good idea since having such a huge menu not only confuses the customers but it also makes it difficult for the kitchen to make food quickly and well. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case for this location. This is supposed to be the flagship Chilis but they don't seem to be acting like it. I knew an employee for Chilis that had told us that they were going to start using a conveyor belt oven to cook all of the food, when I heard about that it seems like all the trouble started happening. The service is horrible, waitresses will show up to your table once in a while. Good luck getting a refill. Food is always late or never shows up. Food is frequently cold. And some of the changes to the menu are not good, the queso dip for example which used to be really good is now just a gross mess. The chicken crunchers are different as well, I don't know why they messed with the recipe. The manager however is always very understanding of the situation but I don't understand why they can't fix the problem. It's really sad to see a restaurant that I used to enjoy bringing my family to become so dysfunctional.  So in conclusion, the food quality is very inconsistent and the service is terrible. This has happened too many times and every time we give them another chance they screw up. I don't know about the other Chili's locations but this one really needs to clean up house and get staff that actually care about what they are doing."
Jessie B.,"Portage Park, Chicago, IL",2,5,3,5.0,5/15/2017,Honestly I love this place. Their mashed potatoes are the best. Overall pretty much all your staff is friendly!
Abril P.,"Chicago, IL",2,16,,4.0,9/22/2017,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants . I highly recommend the $35 meal plan for two . You get one appetizer ( recommended : loaded fries ), 2 entrees ( recommended : mango-chillo chicken ) one dessert ( caramel mount cake) , and two margaritas . Each margarita is enough  to refill the cup three times ! For the price you're paying I think you get a great deal . The waiting list for the table is about 25 minutes but you can always get a seat in the bar or the little area next to it . It's first come first serve so just stay around and you'll get a seat quick . Servers take a while to go to your table too."
Parish F.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,1,5.0,9/4/2017,Javier server is amazing!!!! Literally! From the poor service I had earlier from another restaurant to here is refreshing!!!!! Grade A server
Bella F.,"Chicago, IL",86,117,42,5.0,2/9/2017,"I order the new ultimate bacon burger and OMG, was so good. I couldn't finish it. If you are extremely hungry, this is the right choice."
Liz V.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Worst experience EVER!!! first i ordered appetizers of which took forever to come. Then i ordered my meal for myself and husband of the ancho salmon and steak i made it a combo ""as i always do"" every time i come here never an issue!! Then i get this waitress that makes the 2 combos into 4 because she said it just sounds wierd to order!! Then when  i advised her its wrong she tried to debate with me!! Like huh.. aint i the person placing an order here NOT YOU!!  Then the manager came out and tried to debate my order aswell!!  Like are these people foreal! It was so much back & forth that we left we did not eat! We paid for the appetizers that were eaten then left! Im sorry chilis wont be getting my buisness any more atleast this location EVER! Especially at this time of day!  HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"
Phil G.,"Glenview, IL",1,78,1,3.0,10/24/2017,Overall good food. I think the fajitas are one of the best things they offer. They changed the menu and removed about half of the food choices. I was disappointed with that. Stopped in for lunch and paid $16 which included the tip. Thought that was expensive for a cup of soup and a half chicken sandwich.  The prices are high for what you get. $3 for a Coke?  I enjoyed their old menu better. Of course they're charging more for everything hence the new menu.
Maryana S.,"West Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",287,323,543,3.0,3/13/2016,"Like others have said, this place is a hit or a miss. It a nice spot after shopping in the area. They offer a good variety of food. I never had a bad experience here with the food, always delicious. However, the service needs some work. It's very very very slow. After we got seated it takes 8 min to get the waiter to our table, on a so so busy lunch. The food always takes a while, a salad and medium rare should not be that long. It's convenient that they made the self checkouts now, you don't need to be kept hostage to pay your bill."
Lauren K.,"Chicago, IL",9,173,6,4.0,9/12/2017,"Chili's always seems a little sticky to me - probably because of all the families and babies, but this location is pretty nice. My husband had the sirloin tacos and I had the shrimp fajitas and we really enjoyed both. Our server was super nice too."
Bing N.,"Chicago, IL",6,65,301,3.0,8/30/2016,Food ok as usual but our server today don't seem happy serving us. Maybe because it's already past 9pm and he is tired. He does not look like a happy camper.
Annie V.,"Chicago, IL",240,132,346,4.0,1/29/2016,"4 stars for my recent visit. The staff were friendly and attentive; the restaurant was clean, bathroom as well (I can't speak for the men's since I can't go in there!); the food was good.  I ordered the fajita trio- which you can choose 3 types of protein... It came with 3 flour tortillas, sour cream, guac, cheese, salsa, and tomatoes. It was very good! Meats were really tender and flavored so well--- I wasn't expecting that from Chili's! It fed the 2 of us adults with some to spare! It only costed $16.99. (The only thing I will say is that the presentation of the sides could've been a little more appetizing, and they could've given more tortillas or at least stop by and ask if we needed more tortillas... ) What was even better was we happen to come when kids eat free. So my daughter got her fave, grilled cheese, and her side choice of mashed potatoes. I tried the potato and it was so good it had to be artery clogging good. That's a good-bad thing   Bill with tax and tip came out to $25-and I didn't even have to wait for the server to give us our check. The tables have little tablets you can pay from! Good service & food, no waiting time, free meal--can't beat that!"
Stephanie M.,"Skokie, IL",63,6,,5.0,6/19/2017,Just wanted to give a shout out to this Chili's. I brought my class of like skills special education students to practice different skills and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We really appreciate it and will be back!
Joani O.,"Skokie, IL",143,423,927,4.0,6/10/2015,"Always a good time, good food, good service. The 2 for $20 is a great value, or you can get two select cocktails and do 2 for $35. The two for's includes an appetizer for two, two entrees, and a dessert. My family loves the ribs, the cajun pasta, the sirloin steaks which are always cooked to perfection, and the loaded mashed potatoes! I can only eat like this every once in a while, but when I do, it's often Chili's! Also, if you're a chocolate lover, the molten lava cake is a must!"
Mark B.,"Evanston, IL",0,17,,4.0,4/14/2017,"I almost never write reviews of big chain restaurants, but I've been to this Chili's several times in the past few months because it's my son's new favorite restaurant and after half a dozen meals there I have some good things to say about it: 1) The staff currently running the place seem to really have their act together. There's usually a wait on weekend nights, but you're right in the middle of one of the last decent shopping centers on the north shore, so there's stuff to do and see while you wait, and they'll just text you when your table is ready, which I thought was a convenient and handy touch. The place is clean and well-appointed and there are always plenty of staff on hand to direct traffic, clean tables and places, seat guests, and take orders. Their attentiveness is broadly excellent by any standard, which was one of the first things I noticed because it's usually what's missing in chain restaurants like this. 2) The drinks and orders come out quickly and correctly every single time, despite the fact that they do get very busy at peak mealtimes. For me, this translates once more into strong management and staff that know what they're doing. Their teamwork seems smooth and seamless when shift changes or unexpected things like large parties show up and land on them. No one ever seems stressed or quietly irritated, and a couple of occasions we even got a friendly conversation with our servers who made a good show of treating us like we were the only table in the place for those five minutes. When you work at full-speed, as these folks do, that kind of adaptability, professionalism, and consistency is almost like a magic trick.  3) They have these little iPad things for kids to play with at their meals and on which you can pay your bill directly instead of having the waitstaff take your card. It's convenient enough for what it is, and my son certainly appreciates the distraction and games, but the only star I'm taking off for this review is that these things cost $1.99 to use every time. It's not horrible, and I buy it every time for my kid, but I'd much rather give the servers the extra $2 for the great job they're doing than feel like I'm renting a piece of technology we have a better one of at home. Know what I mean? Just buy a couple dozen of these things and eat the cost and let us bask in the superb flow of the place without a $1.99 frowny face on the bill. 4) The food is mostly consistent with other Chili's restaurants, but it's only positives here too. They never scrimp on anything, seasonings really grab you, plates generously overflow, empty bowls of salsa or other condiments are refreshed instantly and without having to be asked, the drinks are satisfyingly mixed and their drink menu has just the right amount of variety. Their lava cake threatens to give you diabetes, but you sweets-lovers will get this every time because it's delicious and the right size for two. Speaking of two: they offer a ""dinner for two"" one-price special where you pick a starter, mains, desert, and drinks. Totally worth it. Last time my wife and I had the half-rack of ribs and Margarita Grilled Chicken which were both delicious (the ribs especially), and I drank both of the included, salted house margaritas myself. Reasonably priced and perfect, and I left our attentive server a 30% tip with zero regrets.  In a way, this Chili's answers some interesting questions about what a restaurant with machine-enhanced service could look like, and I'm happy to report that it looks... good? Who would have thought? There still seems to be plenty of people in the kitchen and dining room, and if anything the little iPad things that can take orders and check you out free up the rest of the staff to just make your experience better. I would feel bad if that kind of tech cost anyone their job, regardless of how much convenience or efficiency it offered, and I didn't get the sense that that was the case at all at this Chili's. The verdict: keep up the great work, guys (especially whoever is managing this place). We'll be back."
Marge F.,"Chicago, IL",4,10,,3.0,4/1/2017,"Well the food here is decent as well as their prices.  The experience itself had much to be desired.. went early on a Thursday so not many people there.  Waiter was nice but I think he was a bit frazzled cause I think he was the only server there.  My Strawberry Daiquiri was terrible, had salt around the rim and tasted awful.   When the waiter came back with a new drink I realized that the bartender most likely poured the drink in another glass w/o salt on the rim.   I put it on the edge of the table and said I just stick with water... no apologies, or asking what was wrong with the drink.  The management needs to run the business a bit better, probably not going back there any time soon."
Dixie S.,"Chicago, IL",3,56,37,4.0,7/24/2016,Great place in the Summer.  A large menu of lighter items and salads.  You can always find something for the kids too. Lately we come here more for lunch after a movie.  It's just too crowded at dinner time.
Bill F.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,1/12/2017,"My wife and I have Iowa ID's because that's where we're from, and we're temporary residents in IL, so they advise you to not change your ID unless you plan on becoming a permanent resident. You also cannot renew an Iowa ID until it expires, not before. You renew online and they send you a new one through the mail, your old one remaining valid until your new one arrives. We're both 24. The doorman was very nice, the waitress who seated us was nice, the manager tried his best to be nice, but in the end he kept saying his 'hands were tied' when they really were not. He 'couldn't' accept my wife's ID, even with my wife being 6 months older than me. If he would of scanned it, he would have seen it was a valid ID, but he said they don't have an ID scanner. That would have been fine, had the manager been sensible. Common sense should have gotten us through this whole situation, as I lay out below. 1) The ID had her age and birth date on it. Last I checked, going backwards in age when renewing an expired license isn't something the DMV offers. 2) If you thought it was fake, maybe then think, 'why would someone have a fake EXPIRED license?' who the hell would be that stupid? Furthermore, 'Why would a wife bring a fake expired license, while her husband brought a real non-expired license, right next to her?' Without a scanner, a fake ID with a non-expired date could easily pass your eye inspection, but our real IDs couldn't. Wait, oops, just my (6-month-older-than-me) wife's couldn't... 3) If you're going to have a policy on a manager checking all 'out-of-state' IDs, common sense tells us that having a manager with AT LEAST basic knowledge of how 'out-of-state' IDs work would be appropriate.  We left, but I came back in as we were walking away and calmly told the manager that I was going to leave this very review. He offered to buy us an appetizer, but that didn't make my wife feel any less degraded. I shook his hand and we left. We went to Binny's, used the same IDs to buy some whiskey and then went to Chipotle on McCormick, where we used the same IDs again to buy some beers while we ate. Binny's cards hard. Harder than anywhere. They accepted my wife's ID because it was real. Really wish this place would have seen that. It was freezing out, sleeting and we just wanted to enjoy a night out at someplace a step up from home, but it looks like we'd have been better off inside. For advice? Get a scanner, get some knowledge in out-of-state IDs, but most importantly? Be more human, and get some sensibility."
S S.,"Chicago, IL",0,23,4,1.0,8/28/2017,"Was seated and waited 15 min...looked at my husband and asked if he was ready to leave, he said give it 5 more minutes..if nobody comes we will leave. Meanwhile the employees are standing by the bar laughing and having a good time, several looked at us but didn't want to be bothered. So the 5 more minute mark hit and we got up to leave..I wanted to talk to the hostess only couldn't find one...so we left and are now at Red Robin..."
Magic M.,"Highwood, IL",61,59,45,2.0,1/26/2017,"I've never been unsatisfied with the food here but my problem is I came one night and I had a 25 dollar gift card so i gave it to the waitress my bill was 42 something so my total after the 25 dollar deduction should of been 17 something right? Well she tells me the card had no balance on it, I find that hard to believe since I got it a few days earlier as a birthday gift...she was like ""Yeah, no balance!"" Sorry"
Wren G.,"Harwood Heights, IL",45,4,,5.0,9/11/2016,"Our visit on Saturday Sept 10th during lunch.  It had been over a year since I had visit this location.  We had anticipated them being busy however there was no wait when coming in.  We were sat in the bar lounge having Rhianna as our server.  My boyfriend is always anxious when going out, but Rhianna made him feel very comfortable and relaxed.  She smiled as she spoke to us, her tone was very genuine and professional.  She had given us a few ideas on what to order and also recommended a few featured items on their new menu.  We shared a triple dipper app consisting of Southwest Egg Rolls, Honey Chipotle BBQ Wings and Cheddar Bites . . . OHH MY GOODNESS those Cheddar Bites were something I've never had, sooo delicious.  I ordered a carnitas burrito with grilled asparagus and bf ordered a Grilled Chicken Burrito with beans.  Loved all of the food, and the music. I noticed a great special for a $6 Old Timer Burger on Wednesdays so I guess I'll be coming back very soon.  I'd definitely recommend coming and sitting in Rhianna's section.   Thank you so much to the staff and management.  We had a lot of fun."
Wil M.,"Chicago, IL",38,3,,5.0,1/21/2017,"I decided to eat here with my wife and daughter. I noticed that my order (steak) was not the size I had ordered. Matthew, one of the managers, told us that the kitchen messed up my order. Matthew apologized for their mistake and the way he handled the situation was beyond our expectations. Great customer service from Matthew as he followed up with us to make sure everything was fine. Definitely coming back."
chris k.,"Chicago, IL",63,53,4,2.0,4/6/2016,"What has happened to this Chili's over the past few years?   I had a craving for the fajitas, so we stopped in for dinner.   We were looking for our standby Potato Skins for an appetizer and evidently they didn't  make the cut on the reworked menu.  We passed on the appetizer and ordered.   Along with wanting fajitas, I also wanted soup, it seems the awesome cheddar broccoli is no longer on the menu either (after being on the menu since forever).  I opted for a cup of the cream of potato soup and that serving size was the smallest I'd ever seen in a restaurant, only about five spoonfuls in total.   it was busy and our entrees were delivered by a manager.  The fajitas were not sizzling as usual and the onions and peppers weren't cooked, just one step over raw.  The other entree, Monterrey Chicken, I was told was ""just ok""   Needless to say, it wasn't a great or even good experience.  I really looked forward to those fajitas, I've have had better ones at the TBK down the street"
Steve H.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,41,,1.0,10/13/2016,Poor food and very poor service. We ordered the classic nachos. It consisted of 12 tortilla chips topped with cheese and a jalapeño slice for $10.  What a ripoff!  The waitress never came around for refills on our drinks. We also ordered the combo fajitas. Hardly any meat mostly onions for around $15. We should have known to stay away from a chain restaurant for Mexican food.
Asya K.,"Norridge, IL",5,73,35,3.0,11/14/2016,"I met a friend at the bar area for lunch. The table we sat down on was dirty but the waitress noticed it as soon as she greeted us, and took care of it. We both had a burger and we enjoyed it very much. However we both thought that the fries had way too much seasoning and I did not care for the garlic pickles ( I wished that there was a choice). The only thing that turned our experience off was that the waitress dropped off the check without asking her if we wanted anything else. We both understood that it was shift change and we were fine with closing our check but we thought it should have been handled better."
Bunny F.,"Lincolnwood, IL",0,4,,3.0,5/24/2017,"I think the food is really good and pretty affordable but, like other reviewers, I've noticed that the wait times are kind of excessive on weekends and sometimes even weekdays. The waitstaff seem overworked and usually food comes to the table with a long wait as well. One time my husband got upset because our drinks came late and then our appetizers were late and then our main entrees came out just a minute after our appetizers. He asked them to bring the entrees back to the kitchen and keep them warm so that we could enjoy our appetizers. If it weren't for the overworked waitstaff (and by the way I think they are doing the best that they can) I think this place would get mostly 5 star reviews."
Alex H.,"Chicago, IL",1,10,,3.0,8/14/2016,"Took too long to be served Food needs more flavor, i try the rib eye burrito twice because i thought that it will be different this time but i got disappointed again"
Yoly Q.,"Skokie, IL",33,3,18,4.0,1/20/2016,"They have many choices that I like  and all those I tasted was so good, and coming back love this place and my free appetizers"
Big Al A.,"Morton Grove, IL",4,24,17,3.0,3/29/2016,"Sunday go this my kid , have lunch, cant call this plase Mexican grille, but food is ok, service can be better, spend $37 , it ok to have lunch, but iff u looking Mexican- go different places"
Tom A.,"Palatine, IL",18,90,25,4.0,5/11/2016,"Invited back by the area manager, my lunch mates and I enjoyed a nice meal and excellent service. Ultimately, Chili's is a chain restaurant, and lives and dies on price and service. Based on our most-recent visit, this locations deserves a spot on our regular rotation."
John B.,"Chicago, IL",11,35,78,2.0,6/28/2016,It us annoying to show up at a restaurant to see a line when half the tables are open.  Bad bad management.  Terrible use of space.  And just lazy staff
Lucette M.,"Chicago, IL",236,2,,5.0,8/21/2016,"The food tasted so good and the ambience was very friendly. I recommend the lunch combo: fresco salad and smoked chicken quesadillas. It was honestly the best salad I have ever tasted. The sauce may be mildly spicy; I normally don't like spicy food, but I crave this sauce each time. I heard the chili steak also tasted very good. This place is at reasonable price for consistent good quality food service."
