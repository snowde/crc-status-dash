M R.,"Land O' Lakes, Tampa Bay, FL",1,141,137,1.0,3/15/2014,"What a horrible experience. The food at chili's has never been great but this experience will be our last one with them.  We took my son to the New Tampa chili's for his birthday at his request.  We arrived early (before 6:00pm) in order to eat and see an 8:00pm movie. It took over an hour for our food to arrive an when it did, everything was over cooked and dry. We mentioned it to our server and she completely ignored the situation. I finally stopped our waitress after watching my husband chicken down the swill they served us and asked her to redo his meal.  At this point, we were running late, my husband was disgusted, and we were over the whole experience. The staff, from server to kitchen, to management completely ruined our dining experience.  We won't be back!  Wake up before you lose more customers?"

James N.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",19,30,11,1.0,3/5/2012,"I used to love Chili's, especially their mushroom jack fajitas. Recently though, I have been very disappointed with their service. In the last few times I have gone, the service has been poor overall and the food has been lack-luster. The last time I went though, I was driven away for the last time. When we were waiting on our food, I noticed that there was a dead cockroach on the window sill right next to our table. After pointing this out to a staff person (either a manger or host, they never said), they picked it up with their fingers, dropped it, picked it up again and walked away. There was never a word said to us, never an apology rendered, never a mention of the incident at all. I even took the internet survey to let them know and they never got back to me. After that, I started looking closer and every table was dirty, there a dozen or more other bugs on window sills around me, and everything was sticky. I was disappointed not only with the condition of the restaurant, as it was not busy and someone could have definitely cleaned up, but also with the lack of response of the staff to my complaint. I hope that things will change, but I will not be going back and neither will anyone that I know that I have talked to."
Toonces Z.,"Tampa, FL",3,23,,4.0,7/20/2008,Great food at a great price! I love the chips & salsa here. I would give five stars but the curb-side delivery needs help. Some times it's fast.... some times you have to walk in to get your food. I guess it depends who is working that day....
