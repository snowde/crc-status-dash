Robert M.,"New Port Richey, FL",14,3,,5.0,8/4/2010,"We just love this Chilis. It is filled with the greatest staff you can ask for.  We have never had a bad experience at this restaurant and everything we've had was just outstanding. The prices are very,very reasonable and the atmosphere is very relaxing. You can't lose dining at this Chilis. Be sure to say Hi to Meg,Jen, Jenna, Crissy,Gina or Heather when having a cocktail."
Lisa K.,"New Port Richey, FL",4,25,,5.0,10/27/2006,"This is a newer Chili's, so it's got a great atmosphere and is really clean.  We've always had excellent food and excellent service here.  Our favorite is the Boneless Shanghai Wings with Wasabi Ranch dip.  And the other thing we love is their all day happy hour.  Two for one on most drinks.  Of course, they are a busy place and go on a wait almost every night for dinner, so plan ahead.  It's a great place for kids since it's noisy in there already, and they have a good kids menu."
