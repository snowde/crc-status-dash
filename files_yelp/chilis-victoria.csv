William N.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,5.0,10/31/2017,Every time we decide on Chili's we are 100% satisfied. The service is always out standing. And the menu has something to satisfy what ever we are craving. The quality of the menu items are always consistent. The deserts are fabulous. Chili's is one of our favorite spots when we decide to dine out. Their specials fit everyone's budget.
Bay L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,5,2.0,11/4/2017,"Slow as molasses. It is Saturday night but isn't busy, just steady. I'm a server myself (at another restaurant)and this is ridiculously slow. I ordered mixed fajitas and they came out without tortillas which took about 5 minutes to come to the table after the fajitas arrived. Our waitress hardly checked on us and I see a lot of staff just standing around talking and drinks took forever to come out in the beginning (iced tea). The food wasn't bad. Wasn't the best I've had at chillis before though either. The booths seats and floor was very dirty. The booth definitely needed to be wiped down more when they sat us."
Macie K.,"McCoy, TX",99,8,,3.0,4/28/2017,"Food was pretty good. I got a healthier choice today and it was chicken with black beans and a bed of rice. It was pretty good. Waiter was good, the hostess was sort of rude. Its bar is super small. Its chillis nothing out of this world but nothing bad either."
Brittany B.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",117,28,66,1.0,8/12/2016,My boyfriend and I frequent chili's because we enjoy the queso. Well- we've been here at least two handful of times and each time we leave pissed or complain to the manager. the best waiter here is the bartender and of course he's running the bar.  The staff is horrible and don't know how to keep drinks full or properly place an order.  We've decided to never step back into this location. We've given it many times and it's just not worth it anymore.
Uyen T.,"Houston, TX",1,15,3,2.0,4/14/2017,Everything was good but I ordered a steak and it was over cooked than the way I like it it was also kinda dry but the wings it's really great! But hopefully ya can LEARN HOW TO COOK MEDIUM RARE STEAK.
Alex G.,"Victoria, TX",17,3,1,1.0,3/2/2017,I use to love this place but the last few times I have been there they have ran out of dos on draft and they have terrible management.
Laura R.,"Lake Jackson, TX",74,112,343,1.0,12/13/2015,"Failed to seat me so I left. I arrived at around 3:20 PM. They did have customers but there was no reason to leave someone standing around waiting for a table in the middle of the afternoon. I am a fan of Chili's, but there are many other good options in Victoria so I doubt I would go back to this location."
William H.,"Highland Village, Houston, TX",209,29,64,5.0,9/23/2015,"I didn't find anything wrong with my visit. Good was good. Utensils, glasses, plates, and restaurant was clean. Not sure why people had back experienced before. Wanted to bring their rating back up because I feel it was just another Chilli's visit to me. I'll be back."
Emily S.,"Victoria, TX",0,9,,1.0,4/14/2016,At first the server was good but that lasted all of 5 minutes. He waited 15 minutes for our appetizer and its been almost 30 for our main food and we r still waiting and to get a refill i almost had to trip him. He is tending more to the bug tables than us. I guess he doesnt know that small table tips good too.
Tony A.,"Houston, TX",16,36,11,1.0,7/12/2014,"On 7/12/13 my wife and I ordered a triple dippers with potato skins, chicken crispers, and southwest egg rolls and a guacamole burger to go along with chips and salsa. When I went to pick up the order they seemed very confused with how to handle someone picking up their to go order, it evidently requires 3 people to accomplish this monumental task of serving a customer at this store.   When they finally managed to assemble the three items I listed above I noticed I was missing the extra salsa we had ordered so I told the server and was quickly notified that the one container was the extra salsa. I tried to explain when we've ordered the same thing several times before that I get two containers not one and I was told that they have been doing it wrong before, so in lieu of arguing I paid and left.   When I arrived home and opened our order I found that everything except the fries with my burger was burnt to a crisp rendering it pretty much inedible( see the photos). I wish I had more options for dining out in Victoria because I will never return to this establishment."
Chad G.,"Portland, OR",13,23,,5.0,11/14/2015,Daughter loves the chips and salsa. Food is always cooked the right way. Service is typical for Texas. Seems like they change service quite often.
Allen B.,"Edna, TX",0,5,,4.0,1/7/2016,"Food is better than most chain restaurants. The margaritas however are freaking awesome!! Service is hit and miss, at times could not be better, other times it leaves much to be desired. It is also an excellent idea to call ahead for reservations as there is typically a wait. This could probably be remedied if they could find or schedule more wait staff."
Alan G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",2,10,1,2.0,6/21/2015,Walked into this place that was empty place and asked for a table not a booth... The host says it will be 5-10 minutes... Really maybe 3-5 other tables full in the place !!! The he comes over and says we only have a high table at the bar. I said jut give us a booth. Seated and our waitress must have been having a bad day although it's 11:45 am!!! She was not friendly at all and just didn't seem happy to be there. Good came out fast and it was just ok. Not good and not bad. The service ruined my whole Father's Day lunch with my family.
R G.,"Houston, TX",30,35,8,1.0,6/20/2015,"Disappointing.  Dirty floors, sticky tables, very slow service but food was suprisingly good but took forever to get. Wont be going back."
Eric C.,"Victoria, TX",11,3,,4.0,7/5/2015,"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Victoria. I always know I'll be able to get something I like. The sliders are my go-to, but the actual burgers are good. The pasta's good, too. I wouldn't really recommend the tacos, though. I think the cook went a little heavy on the seasoning. My waiters are always really nice and super helpful. If you go earlier in the evening, you can usually find a good place to sit. When it's slow, I've never had a wait time. And even when it's busy, I've only waited about twenty minutes for a seat. It's a good place for lunch, too."
Sherri D.,"Victoria, TX",8,8,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Please don't waste your time! I have tried this Chili's twice. The first time was in March 2015. The service was terrible and they were ""out of"" skillet queso????? Today we arrived around 1:40 PM on father's day knowing there would be a wait. There were a lot of pissed off people in the lobby. The hostess told us it would be at least 40 minutes and we were ready to wait until....the other people started talking. At least four groups had been waiting over an hour. Meanwhile there were at least four empty tables in sight. They seemed to be confused about the whole situation and at one point stopped answering questions.  They don't know how to run a restaurant.  We went next door to caring and we're seated in 5 minutes."
Kevin W.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2013,"I've been here twice. The first time I came here I had terrible service. Our food came in a span of 30 minutes meaning people finished their food before others got their order.  I assumed it was just an unlucky experience so I tried this place again. We were seated and waited about 15 minutes and no one came by to get our orders and had to ask the hostess for waters. After not seeing our waiter, we decided to just leave. It's sad how poor the service is. :( The food was fine during my first visit in case you wanted to know. Good luck if you want to try this Chili's!"
Rachel J.,"Victoria, TX",20,56,2,1.0,7/6/2012,"Expect to wait 10+ minutes before you ever see your server and 45+ minutes before your lukewarm, overpriced bar food makes it to your table. Chili's servers are given a section of 6+ tables to mind, which means that your requests que in the server's mind with roughly 6 billion other requests. Try not to make any changes to the menu if you plan to eat here, because your poor server will be doing great to get your food to you at all.  Another point of contention with me; Chili's has changed many of their staple menu items. They've removed items as well as changed recipes to items they still offer, and they are absolutely disgusting now.  Unless you have to use up a gift card, STEER CLEAR!"
Jerry Y.,"Dallas, TX",42,306,,3.0,4/17/2012,Chili's is Chili's.  The food was as expected.  I had the fajitas and they were good as always. Service was slightly on the slow side but that seemed to be the case in the area overall.
Nivek M.,"Victoria, TX",9,3,,1.0,8/2/2013,By far the worst place in Victoria.... Server pushes away dirty dishes on a table with a tray of food to serve you... The hostess is just a fixture god help her if she would do anything to help the wait staff or bartender. The food comes out in no specific order you can have appetizers after your meal........  I use the parking lot to go to Tokyo Grill....
Kristi I.,"Inez, TX",7,17,,3.0,9/6/2013,"Here's the thing, a Chili's is a Chili's. Once you've eaten at one, you've eaten at them all. The food isn't anything fantastic. Its great if you're trying to raise your blood pressure or cholesterol (even the ""healthy"" dishes aren't very healthy.) The only thing that really sets them apart from one another is the service. Victoria is known for crappy service and I feel like this place is a big contribution to that reputation. Now, if you sit in the bar area, your chances of good service go way up. But as you move further and further away, it just gets worse and worse so try and sit in the front. It's a good place to watch a sport or sit and have a few drinks but nothing much more than that."
Michael B.,"Missouri City, TX",0,8,,1.0,5/10/2014,"Worst service ever! 11am 20 separate parties waiting to be seated. No hostess, no servers, why are they open? Don't come here or to Victoria or better known as Ictoria!"
A M.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,1.0,8/25/2013,"Been here twice. First time boarder line inedible food and terrible service, 2nd time after waiting 5 min at the front for a hostess and having been ignored by 2 servers and the bartender, we just left and walked across the parking lot. Skip it and just go to road house."
Mike D.,"Victoria, TX",3,29,1,2.0,8/14/2012,If you like bad service and eating around dirty tables. They should hire a bus boy because the servers don't bus the tables in a timely manner
H C.,"Bay City, TX",1,16,,1.0,1/16/2012,"The Victoria, Tx Chili's has the worst staff imaginable. The hostesses are rude, the waiters ignore you. In the end, you have to have the bartenders take your order, and the manager refill your drinks. A tip: don't go while a game is on, because your waiter will sit at the bar watching tv, and you'll have the pleasant experience of hearing the cooks yell out ""There's a bunch of food sitting here and no ones taking anything out!"" and I do mean yell. I've tried time and time again coming here, thinking maybe I got then an off day, but no, it's just an off restaurant. No one gives a crap about the place, from the hostesses to the owner."
Jill B.,"Victoria, TX",17,8,,1.0,2/6/2011,The wait was long. The hostess was rude. The waiter was horrible. We only got one refill on drinks! Food was great but we are just going to order carry out next time.
