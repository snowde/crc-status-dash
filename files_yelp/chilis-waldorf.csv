Ashley R.,"Washington, DC",175,51,121,4.0,7/30/2017,"You don't go to Chili's expecting a fine dining experience. It's a chain with a lot of options, and you go with that expectation.  That being said, me and my friends had a great experience for dinner last night - primarily due to our awesome waiter DJ. He was attentive, accommodating, and helpful. One of my friends is pregnant and asked about a virgin daiquiri. While he said they do not have those on the menu, he personally went to see what he could do and came back with one for us. Great service!  Food wise - my Tito's margarita was really good, as was my guacamole burger. From my friends reviews, the fajitas were good (but the steak was overlooked). I would definitely come back here - for DJ specifically!"
Deborah F.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,3,1,1.0,8/26/2017,The service was poor.  When the server arrived by the name of Anthony when ask why it took so long he stated he was washing dishes.  He was rude and we left.  If you have an hour to wait on service once seated at a table this is the place to you.
Rachel B.,"La Plata, MD",52,40,7,5.0,6/4/2017,"Great experience at Chilis today. My fiancé and I did the $35 deal that comes with 2 meals, appetizer, 2 margaritas and a big dessert! The waiter with dreads was our server and he was so nice and polite! Was full and happy at the end. Thank you for giving out roses to all the ladies on Mother's Day too!  Came again (June 4th) and once again, great service and lots of delicious food. Thank you!"
J D.,"White Plains, MD",0,20,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Have been to this location several times.  The food is always good and we've had good service in the past.  However, the last few times we've been here the service has dropped off big time.  The last 2 times in particular we've had the same server and she is just horrible at her job.  I hate to be that blunt,  but she's just bad and it appears that she's not even trying.  Last time we were here , the hostess had to go get her after we'd been sitting for 6 or 7 minutes and she hadn't come out yet.  Then she disappeared for long stretches and would eventually come by, smelling of cigarette smoke.  We asked for extra chips for our queso and she didn't bring them until we were done with our meals.  All this and she only had 2 tables.  This time was much the same experience.  I had to go to the bar to get refills on our drinks after sitting on empty for 10 minutes.  It truly is the worst service I can remember getting in a restaurant.  I was frankly stunned to see she was still working here. We will not be coming back to this location."
DeeDee H.,"Capitol Heights, MD",57,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,Thank you Tim for your generous help yesterday. .  Thank you for making my Daughter Birthday special.
Warfare S.,"Washington, DC",19,80,1108,2.0,4/20/2016,Well I guess after waiting for 17:23:08 min/sec that our waitress finally came and had another in her hand that she drop the Ribs on the floor of the customer ...Omg And then then a turn around the bar area and gave it to the customer. So we decide just to order something quick & sliders and leave. Not worth.
King S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",37,19,82,1.0,7/9/2017,"This is easily the WORST Chili's I've ever been to in my entire life. Someone please shut this place down. The food was horrible, I send the same items back to the kitchen several times. The rest of the food was terrible I will never eat here again. This place is possibly the WORST place in Waldorf"
Tameka Y.,"Bryans Rd, MD",100,18,12,1.0,4/28/2017,Not a good happy hour spot. Absolutely the worse service ever! Food was decent. Drinks were watered down. Whats the purpose of having the capability to order from the tablet on the table if its still going to take at least 20 mins to get spring rolls and chicken and easy nachos??? I will never return there. Unless it's the apocalypse and thats the last place that has some food left that the zombies hadn't gotten a hold of!!
Lashawn D.,"Prince Frederick, MD",0,1,,2.0,2/19/2017,"No hostess, so, we sat at bar. The bartender was attentive thank goodness for her....had the chipole chicken bowl. The rice was soggy, lettuce was hot, but chicken was good, so i ate that. Restaurant was clean. Did not feel like waiting so, i didn't send it back....Giving it to my dog."
Danielle M.,"Bushwood, MD",170,9,19,3.0,2/10/2016,"I decided to go to Chili's Happy Hour in Waldorf, MD because of the great happy hour prices. Chili's Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 2pm-8pm (BAR ONLY) which is a great because it gives you more of a open window. I have been here 3 times so far for the happy hour. The first two times were cool. I was able to get a good seat and was pleased with my visit. When it comes to bar food, it is pretty much idiot proof unless you chef/cooks are just plan inexperienced. The food is nothing to celebrate over but it's good enough to help coat your stomach for the alcohol. The servers are cool but, overworked. Apparently today, the server on staff is by himself and overwhelmed. I walked in the bar today to a packed house with about 2-3 cocktail tables. I had to ask the host to clean a table off for me in a corner section of the bar. He was pleasant and didn't hesitate. My server, not sure what his name is because he never introduced himself, was running all over the place. I sat down at 6:11pm and I took about 7 mins for him to give me a menu, which I told him I knew what I wanted. I order the wings(fried hard), a glass of red wine and a margarita for later.  The kitchen was pretty fast because by 6:29 I had my food. Piping Hot! So word of advice, let your wings sit alittle. My margarita came and I forgot to tell my speedy Gonzalez server no salt around the rim. Once again I wasn't asked, which I'm used too. So I asked if they could make another? He offered to wipe the rim off instead of making a new one. I told him that regardless some salt ended up in the glass and I will taste it. He kind of looked at me like it was a issues but called the manager on his little walkie talkie and said ""I need the Margarita to come off"" then, he said loud enough for me to hear ""No! It's not our fault"". I'm like WTF? Broadcast? When he returned I had a margarita in a DRITY GLASS. Then, the restaurant cleared, my server disappeared.  The only reason I am not giving Chili's a 2 star is because of my pervious two visits. I will try again but and reevaluate if my next experience is better. Kisses"
Sarah M.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,11,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I had lunch at chili's for the first time ever, that was my first and last time there. The place was not very clean.  The waiter we received was sweating perfusely and appeared to not be the cleanest person. It seemed as though he was on something."
Amanda T.,"Decatur, AL",0,8,5,1.0,3/11/2017,"My family and I have been here twice in a month and have walked out both times before being seated. 3:40 on a Saturday, tables empty and being told the wait will be 5-10 minutes. 10 minutes later still not being set. Seeing other customers sitting at their tables with empty drinks and coming up to the desk to ask when they will be waited on. Seems to me the management does not have their restaurant in order. It's a shame my family really likes the food at chili's. Cant say we will be back anytime soon."
Mattie B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,Went in to Chili's to get some lunch. Was very hungry after a long morning. Had a long discussion with about four different people... at least two were managers... about why I was ordering just a burger and no sides. After they finally figured that out (I just ordered a burger with tomato and lettuce) we waited for about a half an hour before we got the order. There was cheese on it. It was cooked to well done. I walked out. I went to Five Guy's instead. Waited 6 minutes and had a perfectly done burger that did not betray my fructose intolerance. What a waste of time at Chili's.
Will N Shirlisa C.,"Walkersville, MD",9,24,1,3.0,2/7/2017,"We went to chillis for dinner and the food, waiter AJ was on point. We got there between 8:45 & 9:00pm and we were having a really nice dinner until your staff that was hanging out at the take out pick up area decided to have a loud conversation. My wife and I could not even hear ourselves speaking to each other because they were so loud! AJ came by to check on us and asked if we needed anything else and we told him no but the people back there are really loud and he said he would relay the message but I guess they were not happy after they got the message and got even louder. One lady started loudly expressing after she obviously got her new work schedule, awww hell nawww, awww hell nawww I ain't working no weekends, I mean really!!!! A new staff is what you need Chilli's because these grown folks that was working need some taming in a bad way. One girl on staff made sure as she was leaving to yell at everyone Goodbye yall. My feelings on that is, if you had feelings about me saying you were to loud then you should have stopped by my table and we could  have handled it right there on the spot instead of walking out the door yelling and getting in your mother's van that came to pick you up. Your staff is rude besides AJ who handled us professionally. Thank you AJ and Chilli's you don't have to worry about seeing us anymore you ruined our quick anniversary outting!!!! The 3 stars you see is for AJ and the food and because of them I didn't give you one star for great parking!!!"
Aly B.,"Hollywood, MD",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,Had the most disrespectful waiter ever. My mother asked if they had anything on the menu involving noodles since she has never been to a chili's before and the waiter told her she needed to go to another restaurant. He slammed silverware onto the table and we had to wait 20 minutes to get a drink. Will NOT be returning.
Riana E.,"Waldorf, MD",0,18,31,5.0,6/8/2016,"I went here just before closing and the waiter was still really nice to us. There was barely any one in the restaurant so we had very quick service. I ordered a watermelon lemonade which I always order whenever it's in season. And I got chicken quesadillas with rice, black beans, and an enchilada. Everything tasted great!"
Sewell T.,"Accokeek, MD",10,178,1,1.0,4/17/2017,Almost left before we were waited on. It was a long wait before a waiter came over after being seated. I had the spicy crispers with fries. The fries were hot but the crispers were cold. The Service what is agonizingly slow from start to finish. Not sure that I will be coming back here.
Karen C.,"Fort Washington, MD",9,8,1,1.0,5/6/2017,"Not sure why I waste my time and money. The carryout/curbside will screw up your order everytime. While ordering they will repeat the order, yet the screw up is unbelievable. Minimum skills equal minimum wage."
Katy R.,"Waldorf, MD",111,259,277,2.0,2/16/2016,"We came here last night at around 10:30. The menu isn't really my type, I guess it's kind of Tex mex? I never knew that about chilis. Anyway, me and the fiance shared the 2 for $20. They don't have many good choices for appetizers so we got fried pickles, which make me nauseous thinking about them. I got a 6 oz steak with mashed potatoes and salad, i finished the steak but didn't really touch anything else. Staff was nice, but the food isn't great."
Linda N.,"Accokeek, MD",1,8,,1.0,9/6/2017,"Wish I could give -10.  Made the mistake of going to this Chili's with family.  Was greeted and seated right away.  After that all downhill.  Waited and waited.  This is the 2nd time this has happened at this location.  Went up front to ask who was the waiter.  Hostess said she would send them over right away.  Well, this guy (Anthony) would had been fluttering around the dining room with other patrons finally come over full of attitude.  When asked what happened he stated he was washing dishes.  Well, that was a flat out lie because he was waiting on the table in front and across from us.  Mister was full of attitude, rolling his eyes and sucking his teeth.  We placed our order and then had second thoughts.  What might he do to the food back in the kitchen?  Well, we asked for the manager who was apologetic.  However, when I spend my money I don't want apologies, I want service.  I'm done with this Chili's.  They used to be good, great wait staff, good food, decent prices.  Not anymore."
Tam J.,"Washington, DC",7,85,19,2.0,6/28/2016,"SLOW SLOW SLOW...Did I say slow?  Went there twice in a week.  First visit on a Monday and we sat in the bar area and saw a waiter 10 minutes later.  ""We have to ""FIND"" your server??? There were probably 8 other tables dining and two other tables in the bar area with seated patrons.  First, why do you need to FIND my server?  This spells poor management PERIOD.  Servers should have designated areas and help out in other areas when the need arises.  So, finally we had a server and he was nice (seems most area nice).  The food came out and was ok. Can't mess up fajitas and a drink.  We saw the server far and few during this visit.   Came back again on a Saturday. Sat down at 2:00 in the bar area (no one was in the front so we seated ourselves).  Finally after seeing no servers we were about to get up and get menus when a server arrived at our table. We placed our drink order (water and an iced tea as well as a margarita).  Ten minutes (2:10) later we placed our food orders, after the server took orders of tables that came in after us, yes, we needed a few minutes to look at the menu but when he finally returned, he should have taken our order first.  At 2:40 our food arrived...2:40...a salad and fajitas......totally unacceptable, as again, there were about 6-8 tables being served in the entire restaurant at the time of our visit. Why did it take 30 minutes for our food?  I ended up cancelling the margarita with the server who looked bewildered...but evidently he never put the order in or it was never sent to the table, either way...unacceptable. There also was a big disparity in the fajitas. We ordered the same dish on our prior visit and the quantity in no way compared to what we received this visit. The kitchen was throwing a loud party on Saturday, which I assume is why the food took so long coming out and was plentiful.?? Doubt I will go back here again.  Management really needs to step up to the plate on this place, I am sure they see the horrible reviews. Will also be sending this review to corporate."
Mike P.,"La Plata, MD",0,31,,1.0,4/2/2017,We requested a table for 10 and were seated at a table for 8.  THATs embarrassing. Now I know where groups aren't welcomed. Lemons that came with my water were black in places.
Margarita C.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,,1.0,4/7/2017,Unfortunately Chili's in Waldorf has not delivered the last few times we've come in. The food has been sub-par but the service is the worst. Waited 20 mins just to order drinks after being seated and our food took almost 1 hour. Totally unacceptable. We'll not be visiting this establishment any time soon.
Suzanne A.,"White Plains, MD",0,4,,1.0,3/29/2016,"My husband stopped here for lunch today . After waiting several minutes we were eventually greeted by host and brought to a table, after waiting almost 15 mins at our table without even having our drink order taken we left . This is our third visit to this Chili's recently , each time we have had unbearably slow service. The new menu is good but unless you have two hours for a lunch break don't go to this restaurant."
Ryan D.,"Mechanicsville, MD",83,3,1,1.0,2/11/2017,"Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. It then took about 10 minutes before we saw our waitress with another waitress telling us our waitress would be with us shortly about 3 different times. Once our waitress showed up, there was no introduction, it was simply ""what do you want to drink."" We also gave her our entire order figuring who knows how long it would be till we saw her again. She delivered our drinks and disappeared before I realized she brought the wrong thing. We didn't see her again until our meal came out. She dropped the food and disappeared before we even realized that we didn't have silverware. We both got ribs that tasted like something you would expect from the freezer section at the grocery store. The mashed potatoes, I have had better instant powdered potatoes. Now we are both sitting here with upset stomachs. We have no intention of returning again."
Milleth B.,"Hanahan, SC",27,29,237,2.0,6/14/2014,"Service was slow even though there was barely any customers. I really didn't like how they seated the customers in one clump when there were many vacant tables. Yes it's easier for the servers, but horrible for us who doesn't want a random kid kicking the back of our chairs or loudly whining about something while we are trying to eat dinner. On the bright side... place was clean and food was good... er...at least I think it was good (coz I was hungry?...) #babybackribs"
Jaylene D.,"Lusby, MD",36,10,1,1.0,5/23/2016,"The hostess didn't speak, wore a look like she could slit my throat. Bathroom was nasty. Noise level horrendous. Should have gone to Genghis Grill!"
Shauna L.,"Capitol Heights, MD",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2016,This place is horrible! Terrible customer service one lady came to me and my boyfriend 20 mins after our order and everything was taken saying she can assist us? Drinks came but the cups were dirty! Food took 35 mins that never came! Me and boyfriend left
Mackenzie B.,"Clinton, MD",4,10,,5.0,5/26/2016,"Currently sitting at happy hour and I must say this is the best happy hour in Waldorf. With half price appetizers and $3 drinks I am a happy camper. My server, Ashley, the manager Aaron, and Bartender Aj, took awesome care of us. They went the extra mile to make sure our experience was enjoyable. Feel free to stop by and check it out. I promise this Chilis is worth a try!"
Tina J.,"Waldorf, MD",0,43,48,1.0,10/5/2016,"I was extremely disappointed with the menu, they turned everything into Tex mex and not everyone can eat that. I ended up ordering a smokehouse burger that had no taste, I'm still trying to figure out why they call it a smokehouse burger. Everywhere I've had a burger u knew u were eating a smokehouse burger. I will never go here again, the only thing that was good was the waitress"
Rydell V.,"Norcross, GA",51,11,16,2.0,3/26/2015,"The kitchen staff sounded like they were having a party. Our waiter was nice he is young so it's understood. But shouts and laughs from the Kitchen were louder The music speaker above me.  1 out of 5  Side dish mac n. Cheese. (2) needed more crumbs and oven-heated. Instead it was microwaved. Then threw the crumbs on top. WTF Fish tacos  Mango tilapia  3  Chicken Alfredo Pasta,  damn I was expecting it to be larger shrimp for 3 bucks.   I'm sorry I feel this review is unfair I should have come during the morning shift. Or something. This is all for now. I still got love for chili's  cause all the Atlanta Restaurants Keep customers satisfied #southernThing"
Lori H.,"Baltimore, MD",0,38,2,1.0,8/20/2016,"Disappointed we usually receive okay service and the food is on point.  Tonight no such luck, the waitress got our order wrong,  appetizers took too long so we had our entrée and appetizers together.  My husband's meal was not hot.  The replacement meal was incorrect as well.  Not sure when or if we will go back to this location."
Spike P.,"White Plains, MD",17,90,3,5.0,2/2/2016,"After a long day of shopping, we decided to stop by for a meal. We ordered the loaded boneless wings which were awesome!!!!!! Try them!!!! I had the Ancho salmon and it was cooked great and was a perfect lunch for the whole family. The staff was nice and the place was clean."
Ed B.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/6/2014,"Simply terrible! First off its not a nightclub . Get rid of the jukebox. It was way too loud. And when the music gets loud the guests have to yell at each other. Ordered a Blue Moon. Worse one I ever had. Tasted like swamp water. Didn't even finish it. Then I ordered the carribean salad with the chicken. After waiting 22 minutes I knew this was not going to turn out well. Chicken was cold and they had to have used half a can of cranberries .  As a result of this visit to Chilis , I am all done with them! Good luck to all who go here!"
Diana J.,"Fort Washington, MD",152,80,65,1.0,7/7/2015,"OMG, im so late in posting this... but I really feel like I need to let folks know! I've been to this place a few times, but these last two times gave me the blues!  The wait staff were very nice and attentive when they were at the table, but it was the quality of the food & the dishes that the food was served on was what made us leave! So the first disappointment was getting our drinks, yes that's right we didn't even make it passed that, we ordered a glass of sprite and some hot tea.  They were brought out to us w/a smile!  It was when I got ready to take a sip when I realized what I did, the hot tea cup had lipstick stains on it, and the sprite had black floating debris in it!!  So I called the waiter to take it away and bring us another of both... he returned and this time the tea cup had a hair floating in it!!  At this point my husband was fed up and said look I can't sit here in confidence thinking that the food will be any better, if bringing us a CLEAN cup and a drink w/out mold/dirt in it was an issue; with that being said we left! I decided to go back w/a friend this time and see if it was maybe just that day that things were off... WRONG!  This time my friend ordered and when it was brought to her it seemed like the food was literally made on the plate and given to her all sloppy then you could see where they didn't even try to combine the seasonings in it & when she still decided to try it and see how it was she ended up spitting it back out immediately, they had put in too much hot spices so it made the dish inedible.  They did send the manager over and asked if it would be ok for them to make her another plate to replace that one she agreed to it, that one was much better, but it just seemed like it was a frozen dish that was microwaved and they sprinkled some seasoning on top...SMH.  It's unfortunate because we really liked going to Chilli's, I'm not goin to this one ever again!  & if you decide to go on your own, Good LUCK!"
Alexis B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",76,9,,1.0,7/19/2015,"I never understand why people eat here. I'm pregnant and I needed food unfortunately the stop was here. We started with fried pickles. How do you screw that up? I had California grilled chicken flatbread. I couldn't find a flavor other than salty and greasy. But I can say when we order our sizzling cinnamon roll to go , they gave it to use cold so we could hear it later. Great move. It lacked the icing and pecans. If you stop here I suppose all places surround were currently on fire."
Sal G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",19,76,125,3.0,8/3/2014,"On this particular day recently I just felt like eating fajitas so I stepped on in. The place wasn't busy at all but the girl who brought me over the menu told me it would be a wait of like 35-40 mins for fajitas. I really couldn't be arsed so I ended up going for a burger instead. It was the usual alright quality but it was a sloppy second considering I really wanted a sizzling plate full of chicken and beef fajitas.  In the end the burger was tasty and the fries were not just warm for a change. Two beers rounded out this wee pit stop quite nicely and I left a satisfied chap that early afternoon. I couldn't figure out why it would have taken the kitchen so long to bring out certain food if the place was pretty dead. It was disappointing, almost as much as the table I was led to on arrival. Possibly the vestiges of the previous night's last patron; the last waiter/waitress could have easily followed Mr Miyagi's ""wax on, wax off"" self-help advice, as it would've certainly come in handy. I've been here a few times now, and this was probably the first time I had slightly below-par service. So on that visit, yay for the food, boo for the cleanliness/service."
Scott F.,"Waldorf, MD",0,4,,2.0,6/8/2015,This place has changed significantly over the years. The last time I ate there the food tasted like it was microwaved. The queso dip was the consistency of paste.
Lauren H.,"Waldorf, MD",110,10,,1.0,6/14/2016,"Went there for lunch the other day -- they were understaffed. I feel sorry for my server because she did the best she could but our lunch took 2 hours from start to end because the kitchen/service was so slow. It took 30 minutes from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks. After we waited over an hour for our food my food came out wrong. I am not the type of person to send back food but the plate came out is not what I ordered at all. I did one of those pick three mexican combos - my food came out as a pick two and they werent even two of the options that I had chosen. I hate to say it, but very disappointed with the whole experience there. I will not be returning."
Ti'Anne B.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,,1.0,2/2/2015,I had to tell someone that i wanted to be seated in order to sit down. The guy who sat me down was impersonal.  Went to the rest room after being seated and on the way saw vomit on the floor...got out the bathroom there was bowel all over one sit...and when i got out the restroom the vomit was still on the floor.  All of this while i watch a employee walk in front of me and go into the mens rest room so someone knew it was there. The food was not good at all....i had to continually call the waiter over for things such a forks and mind you i went when the restaurant was empty
