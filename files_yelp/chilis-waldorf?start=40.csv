Dr. M.,"Washington, DC",7,150,30,4.0,4/19/2015,"Here's a positive update regarding this visit... I contacted Chili's regarding my this visit and they were very interested in my comments.  I appreciated their attempt to remedy my less than positive experience and rectify any future problems.  I made a subsequent visit and it was GREAT!  I wish I could remember the servers name because he exemplified what customer service and a great dining experience should be like, and the food was delivered hot & delicious.   Lastly, the drinks from the bar were even tasty!  How's that for service!? Chili's saved the day and a customer!!!!"
Trish J.,"Newport News, VA",2,14,11,1.0,8/2/2015,"I posted this in another review page, and now adding here, this occurred in June 2015. I walked in and stood at the area where the hostess checks in guests. The hostess never made eye-contact or greeted me and my guest. We stood there and continued to look at her, she never looked at us or acknowledged us and we were standing directly in front of her. Then someone who looked like he could be a manager asked me and my guest to excuse him as he was trying to walk in the path we were standing in, never dawned on him to ask if we were assisted yet, clearly greeting customers as they arrive is not a priority, but we patiently stood there for 5 minutes, even after that happened. It was about 2pm in the afternoon, and there were empty tables, so it wasn't a matter of a busy lunch rush, after five more minutes my guest and I left and enjoyed a great meat at a place walking distance away. Hopefully their other locations have better customer service than this place."
Mattie C.,"Suitland, MD",46,5,,2.0,12/16/2013,The food was ok.  But the service was REALLY slow! The restaurant was only moderately busy and it took about 30min to get our food. Our waitress never came by to refill our waters and when it came time to pay she gave us attitude when we asked how the pay at the table POS system worked.
Michiko S.,"Waldorf, MD",4,13,23,2.0,2/16/2015,"I never had Chili's ever so the family and I decided to enjoy the experience together. The wait to be seated was not long at all. However, we did not see our waiter for quite some time before we even got to order our drinks. The wait for our appetizers alone was terrible. Once our entree had arrived the experience was beginning to crumble even more. They messed up the order of my meal and a family members salad were brown on the tips. Overall, I will not be coming back."
Adam B.,"Laramie, WY",142,27,5,1.0,12/16/2014,"The wait for a slow night to get our food was ridiculous, but that isn't the reason I'm writing this bad review. I have been up all night with food poisoning from the chicken crispers and have no desire to return ever again."
Cheyenne B.,"White Plains, MD",0,5,,5.0,12/13/2014,Andrice was our waiter she was amazing i came late to my dineer party and it was so amzing her service was on point she took care of me and everyone  esle at the table like gods and goddess.  She made my friends  birthday. MAKE HER EMPOLY OF THE MONTH!!SHE GETS .she needs a raise or a extra vaction day  she needs a hefty award
K D.,"Washington, DC",2,14,6,3.0,5/22/2013,Nice place for food and drinks. The staff is a little slower and the workers and waiters are loudddddd in the kitchen.  Cheers to the bartenders.  The rest needs to be more customer service driven.   Thanks Kod
Rick P.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,,2.0,7/25/2015,"Despite all the bad reviews, I decided to try it anyway since I knew what to expect. Wasn't disappointed.  Even tho the place wasn't crowded, it still took too long for service. Was going to order an appetizer when the waitress took my drink order but she flew off to her next table before I could get a word out. So I ordered the appetizer when she took my meal order, and it came out after my meal (59 mins later). Every time the waitress came by, she'd say she'd check on in, but in the end I just had them take it back and make it to go. The food taste was marginal to OK compared to other Chili's. I doubt I will return to this one even for a to go order."
Jane W.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,17,,3.0,7/1/2015,The taco tasted like sloppy joe mix and the tostada was like thin cardboard. My knife was dirty and the table machine didn't give me a receipt as requested. The waiter was polite and did bring me a clean knife and kept my drink filled. This used to be a good restaurant with consistent food. What on earth happened?!
Brian F.,"San Antonio, TX",39,387,199,2.0,4/2/2013,"I've never really been impressed here.  The service is okay at best and the food is average.  I like their table POS systems though, that's nice."
Leroy R.,"District Heights, MD",16,4,4,2.0,6/17/2012,"The service is always good, however I am not sure if it's just me but I like the atmosphere at Fridays over chili's. If I was'nt hungry and just wanting food I might have gone to Mcdonald's and get a big mac and some fries. It could have been an off day for them but I call it like I see it."
Ed C.,"Cheltenham, MD",0,19,,2.0,10/1/2013,"Had lunch today.  Ordered a ""Triple Combo"" to share and a bowl of chili.  My wife had a plate of nachos.  We also ordered iced tea -- $5.18!  That was a bit much for a couple of glasses of tea.  The combo had southwestern egg rolls -- not bad, spinach dip -- just as good as out of a jar, and boneless honey-chipotle wings -- pretty much flavor free.  The chili -- way too much cumin and way to little meat.  Pretty disappointing for a place that call's itself ""Chili's"".  Maybe it's named after a fat guy who shivers a lot.  The chili was more like soup.  The service was good.  Our server was attentive but did not hover. Of course, Waldorf is pretty much a wasteland as far as decent food goes.  So, I'm sure Chili's is at the top of the list for plenty of the locals.  I'll stay home when I'm in the mood for chili or open a can."
Jess B.,"Waldorf, MD",12,61,7,4.0,12/2/2012,"Fun place to be! The staff is really friendly and if there is an issue they do their best to fix it. Mondays are great, with twice the serving of fajitas for the regular price and top shelf margaritas for $3. The sausage queso is utterly delicious and makes me want more."
Elizabeth W.,"Brandywine, MD",3,7,2,1.0,5/8/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to do an early dinner here since we found some unused gift certificates from Christmas. We usually don't eat at chain restaurants so we thought we would give it a try. The food wasn't great. I had the shrimp tacos that were bland and Em had a chicken sandwich. The service and management was awful. The waitress actually told us she forgot that we were her table. She forgot half out meal so our sides came 15 min after our entree. We didn't realize we had to use the pos system to pay and got attitude when we asked for our bill. I tried paying with the gift cards and the system wouldn't let me use them so I asked the waitress. She took then in the back and got the manager To try and help. She came back and said they wouldn't work but the manager could come over. Well it was an obvious struggle to get her to come because we watched her walking around aimlessly for 15 min before coming. She told me there was nothing she could do and would not honor them. I am 100% sure they have not been used and was offended by being accused of using blank gift cards. In the end we spent money we wouldn't have at a restaurant for average food, bad wait staff, and a terrible management. All corporate did was give us one free meal. That does not cover everything we spent money wise and I have no need to ever go back to that place!!!"
Chris D.,"Fairfax, VA",17,280,114,3.0,3/6/2011,Standard Chili's Grill & Bar. Nothing fancy. The service is good and the prices affordable.
Dave M.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",2,9,2,5.0,1/18/2014,Food was good and the service excellent. I really like their nachos. The ribs were tender and tasty.
Aaron W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,43,,3.0,7/29/2010,I love Chilis. I had the fried chicken soft tacos. Great food. Good service.
Rick G.,"Waldorf, MD",1,4,5,4.0,7/31/2010,"Always a great selection with new dishes rotated in. I had the margarita chicken and loved it. Not much of a dark beer selection on tap, but they did have Sam Adams."
Lyndell W.,"Newark, DE",25,42,3,2.0,8/23/2010,"My BFF and I decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat after shopping at Target. It was pretty late so I went inside to find out what time they closed. First of all the host(ess) was nowhere to be found so I wandered up to the bar to ask. What a lively crowd!!  By the time we parked the car and came back, there was the hostess who asked ""would you like to sit in the bar area?"" Immediately I replied ""no thank you  well take a quiet table -lol  our waitress was really nice  she did and said all the right things. Although when our food came out I had to wonder if their was a french fry shortage in the kitchen. At any rate, we had a great time catching up! One suggestion, that molten cake should have coconut sprinkled on it!"
Amanda A.,"San Diego, CA",3,2,,4.0,6/25/2011,"This Chili's is probably one of the best I have been to. It's always very clean, speedy service, and great food. We have only ever had one bad experience with the waiter, and we go there 2-3 times a month so that's pretty good! Everyone is always super friendly when you come in and we never wait too long for good. Chili's are great for families too!"
