Brandon R.,"Utica, MI",7,3,1,1.0,6/17/2014,Was served my chicken salad on a dirty plate. Not to mention the couple bites I did take before noticing the plate. The salad was limp with brown on the ends. Sorry to say this is a very poor managed establishment. Additionally when I arrived for lunch almost all the tables had been neglected with with dirty dishes from customers that they hadn't bothered to clean. They definitely were not busy enough for the restaurant  to be in such disarray.
Debbie Z.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",284,278,51,3.0,1/27/2014,Went here after a funeral - another one!  Ugh.  Nothing great about this restaurant - food was about average - a C I would say.  Everything was just alright.  Probably will not go back because it was not monumental at all! Parking was convenient. The waitress had an attitude. Oh well.  Won't be back Chili's sorry.
Matthew K.,"South Lyon, MI",25,306,26,4.0,5/15/2013,"Better than Applebees (at least, when comparing the Warren locations).  But still high calorie, high fat food.  Although some of their under-500 calories dishes looked appealing, it's a shame they're over $10 for a lunch when you can get a filling (albeit calorie dense) lunch for $6 off their specials menu.  It's pretty obvious they're catering to the fat crowd, which is a shame. I ordered the Guacamole burger and my wife ordered the quesadilla lunch special with the loaded potato soup.  We enjoyed the food, although my burger was already getting soggy by the time it was delivered.  We had a free dessert coupon and went for the molten fudge cake w/ice cream.  A 1000 calorie monster!  Which I'm ashamed to say we finished, haha! I've never had bad service at this Chilis, and the food is at least consistently good.  I couldn't handle going here more than once every few months, but it's a guilty pleasure we like hitting up occasionally."
Ian C.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",6,5,,2.0,6/16/2014,"This place is soooo slow! I got in around 9:20 and placed a carryout order and 35 minutes later I'm still waiting. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the food tastes better than the average Chili's. The bartender, Robin, is polite but definitely takes her time getting anything you ask for and randomly disappears for several minutes without checking on anyone."
Brooke B.,"Auburn Hills, MI",1,8,,1.0,8/19/2014,"My server was good but I thought the place was disgusting it was filthy.. everywhere I looked there was filth; there was food all over my silverware and my skillet handles, the screens that you got to play with mind you you get automatically get charged .99 those were filthy the bathrooms are disgusting and the food wasn't really that good the only thing that was pleasant was the server I don't think I'll be back,, no I know I won't be back the portions were so small even though it was 20.00 it was so small,, I was beyond disappointed..."
T S.,"Warren, MI",0,3,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Experienced angry manager who went from 0 to 100 hollering & yelling at me because I told her what was wrong with my to go order (burnt food,way smaller portions than other Chili's,zero sauce on chicken) and refused to pay if it wasn't made correctly. She ORDERED me to pay or she would call the police, then she flipped again & told me to get out & never come back all over $30 worth of food they made wrong. I was amazed at the emotional roller coaster the leader of this place went on in all of 5 minutes in response to easy to fix problems. While waiting a long time for the food to be brought out (even though it was almost empty in there, & the order had been called in over 30 minutes prior) I witnessed the bar staff put sudsy glasses on the bar to dry, a waitress scoop fries from a bin of fries onto a customers plate without wearing gloves, & a different manager roll her eyes and trash talk with waitresses about another customer who also complained of poorly made food. I now know why it was so empty at dinner time on a weekend."
M L.,"Warren, MI",0,6,2,1.0,3/27/2015,"Poor service & horrible food!! Walked in...the restaurant was pretty empty...there were 3 parties waiting for a table and no one was to be found....that should've been our red flag, but we stuck around....alcoholic beverages were just okay. All the food we ordered.....nothing hit the spot. Waitress got mad when we mentioned the beer we ordered tasted funky and watered down. Just overall horrible. We were there less than 20 minutes and left irritated...as we were walking out, a customer was complaining to her buddies ""the drinks suck, food doesn't taste good and service sucks!"" Took the words right out of my mouth!"
Alan M.,"Warren, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/16/2015,Decided to give them another chance and tried to order some carry out online and it said to please call the restaurant. I call the restaurant and it directs me to press 1 for carry out so I do so. The girl answers and I tell her I would like to order a carry out. She transfers me to carry out (what's the point of pressing 1!) Where I proceed to wait about 7 minutes with no response.  Ended up at Qdoba. Glad to see they have made efforts to improve thier service.
Teresa G.,"Warren, MI",1,27,7,1.0,9/30/2014,"Took my family to what I thought would be a nice dinner out and was sorely mistaken. The entire experience, from the waitress to the food, was just horrible. The kitchen couldn't get the kids cheeseburger bites right - probably the easiest thing on the menu - they arrived with no cheese and the wrong side! That was a testament to the quality of what we received,  3 of the 4 meals that were ordered had to be sent back. My husband and I had cold meat and potatoes and RAW, hard-as-a-rock broccoli ... our waitress had to reenter the orders so that the kitchen would remake them and then didn't bother having them removed from our check until I pointed  it out so - had I not checked before handing over my credit card - I'd be paying $81 instead of $57. Talked to the manager, who only offered us one dessert or salad or soup while we waited for the kitchen to take a 2nd try at cooking correctly. Very insulting that no % was taken off the bill for poor quality food and experience and instead we were offered things we didn't order. Very slow night, we should have felt like royalty but instead felt anything but... $57 for very poor food and service, what a waste."
Mike L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",1,3,,2.0,12/25/2014,"I love me some Chili's. I can't even count the number of times I've gone. But this Chili's on Mound is just awful. The food is normally always delicious, no problems there. By biggest problem is the fact that three separate times now we have waited in the lobby for over FIVE minutes without anyone greeting us! I've already walked out once because of it. But this last time we waited, and five minutes later, the hostess decides to show up and act like nothing is wrong. You have 5 groups just standing around in your lobby blocking the door because no one knows what's going on! I can understand running to go get something or taking a break, but if you do that, can't you have someone else watch the front for you? Completely ridiculous. If you can, I recommend the one on Gratiot. Amazing service there. No matter which one you go to, you'll get amazing food, but if you like to be seated promptly and without attitude, you'll avoid this one."
Pauly G.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",2835,261,658,3.0,7/17/2010,"I always thought it was Chili's Grill & Bar! This use to be one of our favorite restaurants. It just hasn't been the same lately! We still love the chips and dip!!! I guess when you eat at a restaurant for over 10 years and things change, it makes you sad!!!"
Justin H.,"Warren, MI",5,10,,1.0,4/24/2012,"Went there twice. The first time we had about 6 people for a birthday party. It was not busy at all and they took forever to get us drinks, appetizers, and our food. We thought it would be quick and it took us 2 1/2 hours! Terrible service!! Then we went last night. We only had 3 people. They sat us, again not busy, and we waited and waited and waited. We sat there for 30 minutes, ask 4 times for a server, which passed us multiple times, and finally got up and left. The hostess that sat us acted like we had eat already... I will never go there ever again. Usually didn't have bad servers in the past but they have lost my family and friends business."
