Jessica K.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,253,111,3.0,4/3/2008,"SO i don't know what the big deal is with this place. They are all over and i have eaten here so many times i cant even count. There are not more than 5 things on the menu that i like. I like the chicken crispers, the bloomin onion and the broccoli cheese soup. OH and the corn on the cob cause the spiced up butter is damn good.   They have a guiltless grill menu and WHAT that shit is like not even guiltless. A grilled chicken platter is 600 calories..Damn! How you gonna call that guiltless..my ass! That is like 3/4 of my recommended daily caloric intake.   OK on to this chili's..This location is not the best. My friend and i were here once and there were only a few tables (it was like 3PM). Before we ordered, A damn flying cockroach flew across the room and onto our table..So of course we did the girl thing and shrieked, the people across from us saw it too. Well the manager came over and gave us free food and our neighbor free food, told us to order whatever we wanted.   So we just ordered one of like everything-even chocolate malts to go. Now that i think about it, we shouldn't have even taken the severance -that shit is just nasty. we should have left right then and there! I hate to call a place out like that and i know there are bugs in Texas and all but a flying cockroach coming at you like 30 mph before you even order..Are you for real!?"
Michael C.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,1.0,7/23/2013,"This location has disappointed me more than once I will not be going back this time. Saturday night around 8 the place was deserted that should have been a clue. The floors were filthy walking to our table, the table next to ours was trashed,food all over the floor. Service was as bad as the place looked. The food was ok no problem there. We had to ask for silverware after the food was brought to the table,though. Took forever to get our check and the trashed table was not cleared throughout our meal despite there being hardly any customers. I felt like I needed a shower after I left."
Karen R.,"Bacliff, TX",0,5,,3.0,8/31/2014,"Food was decent. And the food comes out in a good timing. Our waitress tonight gave somewhat good service.  When we ordered our appetizer  she didn't bother to ask us if we were ready to order our entree and walked off before we could tell her we were ready to order, so we had to wait  an extra 10 mins until we could actually order.  She tried to give my bf a refill on iced tea and forgot to bring back our drink.  Not to mention it took a long time to get our check."
Paul G.,"Pearland, TX",1,22,4,2.0,8/31/2014,"Like all Chili's Restaurants, the food quality is practically the same.  The differences in the restaurants are the service and overall experience.  This particular Chili's not one of my favorites.  This restaurant allows smoking - so no matter what, the entire restaurant smells like cigarettes.  If you come in for lunch, the place smells like bleach.  I assume they are trying to dilute the cigarette smell.   The best way to get rid of it is not to allow smoking.  I will only do Take Out from this Chili's, I will never dine in."
Lauren A.,"Heber Springs, AR",106,192,57,1.0,11/20/2009,"How is it that Chili's chili isn't good? Isn't that what they are famous for?!  My family decided ""let's eat at Chili's"" one evening and I'm not a huge fan of the place but I went along willingly enough. Signs for Chili's Terlingua Chili were hung all over the place so I decided to try to famous dish that the place was named for.  I was not impressed with Chili's Terlingua Chili. First of all, there is WAY too much chili powder in that dish. WAY TOO MUCH. Second, they don't serve onions with it, just cheese and sour cream and crackers of course. The cheese I can get on board with, but sour cream just seems odd and foreign to me so I opted for no sour cream on my bowl.  Also, a bowl is way too much chili for anyone to eat unless their stomach is made of iron. A cup, maybe... but as rich as the stuff is, I'd think maybe even a cup would be difficult to finish. The crackers are essential to eating this chili. Without them, I see no way to eat it. A spoon? Nay. It's too rich to shove spoonfuls into your mouth without something to dull it down a notch or two.  I could see maybe ordering some fries and then dumping the chili on them, but then you still face the iron stomach issue. It's just way too rich to be eaten by man."
Patricia M.,"Houston, TX",2,9,3,5.0,1/6/2012,"Wow, what is up with all the bad reviews??? This place is so awesome.  I mean, come on...where else can you sit at the bar area, eat a decent meal, watch the game, drink your beer, and smoke?  Not very many places left in this area where you can do that unless you go to a crowded little bar.  But to do that in a restaurant....now that is KING!!  Love their food and service.  Our server always happens to be Ryan and he rocks.  He keeps our Presidente Margaritas (no salt) coming and always refills our chips when we run low.  To us, he makes this place what it is."
Alexis B.,"Cypress, TX",159,11,2,1.0,1/31/2012,"This was the worst Chili's I have ever eaten at.  The service was horrible, the staff was rude and forgetful. They forgot to ring in my child's meal, so I have a starving toddler.  They brought out my salad and it was soggy like it had been sitting in the back window, my friends burger was cold.  With a kids meal you can choose milk, juice or soda - I requested apple juice. They do not carry apple juice because that is not stocked in their bar - umm are you kidding me.  My options were pineapple juice, cranberry juice and they ""might"" have orange juice.  My child drinks none of those and I have a sippy with milk in it already.  There was no option to not have a drink so I can pay $5 for food that didn't get rung in and a drink he doesn't need.  When I spoke to the manager she was apathetic at best.  I was so unimpressed!  I will not eat at this location again."
Marisa F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",335,245,212,1.0,12/1/2008,"I wouldn't suggest vacating this Chili's.  I should have gone to Mc Donald's had I known the food would be so bad.  I ordered the fajita chicken salad and chips and salsa.  The fajita chicken appeared to be the prepackaged style chicken that gave the appearance that it was grilled.  The salad was old, saggy and limp, there were about 5 black beans and 5 corn pieces, I sent the salad back and ordered the broccoli cheese soup only to be more disappointed.  It looked like melted cheese and tasted like relish instead of broccoli.  I couldn't take a second bite of either the salad or the soup.  Needless to say the fries were terrible too, I stole some from my date's plate.  I would stick to what Chili's is good at, their fried boneless buffalo wings.  Although, my date did say that his ribeye was good, he prefers to go to Chili's because their ribeye is cheaper then Outback."
