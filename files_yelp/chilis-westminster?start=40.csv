Jamie L.,"Broomfield, CO",307,908,1148,2.0,7/11/2010,"Chili's is within easy walking distance of my house... and we've been maybe 3 times in 3 years.  The food just isn't great, even for ""Chain Food.""  I remember loving their sizzling fajitas when I was in high school... I'll chalk that up to young taste buds, or Chili's fajitas have taken a *Major* nose-dive.  Their drinks (unless it's the 2-for-1 Happy Hour) are a tad expensive... especially for mass-produced, weak-for-the-masses cocktails.  Their burgers are ordinary, and it's like their menu can't make up its' mind what to be.  Mexican?  American Comfort Food?  BBQ?  Pub?  Then there's the service... what I can only explain as High-School aged children or maybe Barely-18 (They do have to serve alcohol) but definitely not experienced, attentive, or friendly.  Not even fake-friendly, in that ""I'm reading my corporate restaurant's script"" manner.  Ick. Chili's is just one place I'm not feelin'."
Taylor G.,"Denver, CO",11,232,8,4.0,2/16/2015,"My review will be regarding both my experience with the food and the drink I ordered at the bar. My boyfriend took me here wanting to see what has changed with the place and see what they offer now. We got an order of nachos, with chicken and I was kinda surprised when I could literally count the tortilla chips on the plate, not too bad but definitely skimpy on the sour cream and salsa. I could have done with the cheese being melted a bit more, but generally not too bad. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger with bacon and I got a 3 -part deal with soft taco enchilada with beans and rice. While we were waiting, I decided to check out the bar and grab a drink. I don't remember if it was happy hour but I prefer not to drink well options so I ordered a spicy bloody mary with grey goose. $8.75 . Yikes! I was hoping she would put Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, lots of pepper and green olives . Nope, but what she did do was give me nearly a triple shot of grey goose, I suppose to compensate for the high cost of the thing ...but sometimes too much of something isn't a good thing. Anyways, I went back to my seat and I added lots more tabasco and a lot more pepper.  I noticed she didn't really ""mix "" my drink, she just poured liquor and then put tomato juice on top of it.. ya I remixed it myself when I sat down. I still chugged the thing and got on to dinner. I have to say, I was impressed with how much more flavor their food has. The enchilada chicken was tasty and the ""sour cream sauce"" wasn't anything I was expecting. It was good! My soft taco was great and I even liked the cilantro rice I asked for extra salsa, and although I would consider it mild, adding a little tabasco on it made a difference.. My boyfriend loved his hamburger and ate most of his fries, it was good sized and I was surprised how thick his meat looked . All in all, not bad service , decent food and not bad for what their prices are. Aside from the over-poured drink I had .. I recommend the food , however I think I'll just stick to beer next time I go in."
Michael W.,"Denver, CO",0,33,,2.0,11/1/2013,"I liked being able to use the website to enter my order online, but regret ordering from this particular Chili's. I had a huge craving for a nice juicy medium-rare steak and I've really enjoyed the crispy onion strings in the past, so I entered the order and drove to pick it up at the designated time 30 minutes later. The onion strings were cold and soggy. The rib-eye did absolutely nothing to satisfy my craving; it had no sear, was brown and dry throughout the inside, very under-seasoned, and measured in at just under half an inch in thickness. I'm still hungry and don't even want to finish this sorry excuse for a steak. I feel foolish for thinking I could get a good steak from Chili's and I won't make that misteak (ha) again."
Tiffany M.,"Littleton, CO",2,14,,2.0,1/23/2013,"Not the same as it used to be! I loved going to chili's but now I feel like they are lacking food quality! Every time I go the food is over cooked, dry, or tasteless I'm very sad this is not my favorite stop anymore!"
Shane R.,"Broomfield, CO",18,64,5,3.0,5/4/2010,"SO my buddy and I went here after wrok to watch the Rockies game. We sat at the bar, and had complementary chips and salsa with our beers. You can't really go wrong with chips and salsa, but I do have to say that our bartender was crazy good, and very hard working on everything she was doing. I mean I was just getting tired watching her work, I guess i should take a nap now from that. haha. Anyway, food (chips and salsa) was good, and the service was great, moving Chili's up a star. I will probably be back to sit at the bar and watch another game."

Laura G.,"East Palo Alto, CA",4,8,1,1.0,5/7/2011,"My husband and I ordered to go from this Chilis. The service was fine - slow, but fine. When I arrived I had to wait because they had incorrectly made our food.  But the food was terrible. Our main meals were mediocre at best but the cheese fries we got as an appetizer were hard and stale. It tasted like they gave us the fries that had been either left under a heat lamp or left out for hours. Even the fries with our meal were stale and un-chewable.  Definitely won't be visiting this Chilis again - ever."
Jackie G.,"Arvada, CO",29,54,1,4.0,5/28/2010,"I still think Chili's has the best fajitas - that's my favorite and what I usually get when I eat there.  The fajita trio is excellent.  Happy hour is good too with 2 for 1 beers, wine and well drinks even late night.  Service is usually good, too.  My kids like their food, as well."
Anna C.,"Denver, CO",23,73,2,3.0,3/24/2010,"We go here now and again for the deals. Always seem to have a new menu with new items.  Food is standard Chili's fare if you've been to one.  I always like their chips and salsa.  Tried their new green chili chicken soup, actually pretty good but no spice at all to it.  We'll likely be back when we're short on ideas and hungry.  Never had bad service."
Josh T.,"East Wenatchee, WA",8,1,,1.0,10/3/2010,"Cockroach queso is what was on our menu. My girlfriends family and I were in town and we were looking for somewhere to grab some late dinner. We had a coupon for free chips and queso with the purchase of an entree. After our server was nothing but rude to us, we had to pretty much had to start a debate team to make our coupon valid even though it was completely valid to begin with. They finally brought out the chips and queso. We started eating it and about 15 chips in my girlfriend noticed an unfamiliar substance surfacing in the queso. We began to shovel it out for examination only to disgustedly discover that it was a medium size black beetle type bug taking a late swim in our appetizer. Utterly repulsed at the idea that we had almost made this our next bite. We immediately left feeling violated and disturbed at the idea that either this could have been on purpose from the hard time we got for using our coupon,  or that their kitchen was so dirty that they are hosting and insect inn, including a steaming cheese spa. We will never step foot in this Chili's or any other. I give no stars(except the 1 I automatically  have to put to finish this review) and good luck to anyone that attempts to dine bug free at Chili's in the future."
Daniel G.,"Boulder, CO",0,16,,1.0,9/23/2009,"Used to eat at this Chili's all the time, until both service and food quality began to slip. Six months ago, after 15 minutes of waiting for a waiter to arrive, we got up and left.  Last week, we decided to give them another chance. The service is still bad, the prices are the same even though they've cut portions and removed items that used to be included with the meal so that you have to pay for an ""extra"".  Not going back ever again..."
