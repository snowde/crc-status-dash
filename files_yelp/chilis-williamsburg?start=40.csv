Amber R.,"Yorktown, VA",98,22,27,3.0,4/11/2010,Good South Western Egg Rolls. We went on a Sunday afternoon. There wasnt a lot of people in there. We ordered our food and appetizer at the same time and it took FOREVER! They must've been short staffed or something...but when your hungry.... every minute counts. Aside from the long wait for food everything was scrumptious. MMM Chicken Crispers.
Mark B.,"Richmond, VA",0,12,7,4.0,5/24/2010,"My wife and I went on a Saturday night. The place was full but, we didn't have a wait for a table. Our waitress was great!  The Blackberry Tea was awesome, if you like your tea sweet. We had the Custom Combinations. The portions were good and the food was great."
Jeff L.,"Gassville, AR",3,256,,3.0,8/5/2011,"Typical Chilis that you find everywhere.  Same menu, same food, same layout.  Table Service was excellent, and the food was very good.  My only complaint was having to wait 25 minutes to be seated at 9 PM, not because all the tables were full, but because we were told that ""there weren't enough cooks"" to keep up with orders.  So instead of at least being able to be seated and get drinks, they made us wait in the entrance area until 4 or 5 tables had emptied out.  I guess the cooks must have been caught up by then, so we finally got seated.  Very odd excuse for making people wait, and very irritating as well."
