Danielle L.,"Woodstock, GA",158,2,,4.0,1/10/2018,"The food and our service was great, we came in 30 minutes before close. However, the staff and kitchen we're making snarky remarks on how we got there 30 minutes before close. We are both servers and made it a point to tip well and be out of there before closing time. Honestly it was just very unprofessional and the server we had was amazing but we will not be returning due to the negativity at this specific location. We tipped generously because our server was excellent and understanding. But this was such a rude experience."
Ryan C.,"Canton, GA",58,8,,1.0,11/21/2017,"It's just as the other reviews state. We waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. We also ordered an appetizer we never got. The food was cold when it came out 55 minutes after we ordered. This wouldn't be an issue but there was literally only 4-5 other tables that had people in the entire restaurant. When our food arrived, I reminded the waitress that we didn't get our appetizer. She apologized and stated she forgot. No big deal, things happen. But she also never came back with refills. Not once. We finished our meal with no drinks.  We will not be back. This is about the third time I've had a bad experience at this location.  Stay far away from Chilis on Towne Lake Pkwy."
Andrew M.,"Canton, GA",22,10,1,1.0,11/16/2017,Chance after chance. Just got home with hot fries I had to wait on btw and fridge held tacos. They were never cooked. It's obvious by the fact that the cheese isn't melted. So tired of the bad experiences. On more than one occasion I've dined in and been forgotten about. Sat two hours waiting for food and then only offered a free dessert as compensation. You must be kidding yourselves Chili's. You have an issue at this location and it's been long term. I expect to be refunded for poor service and uncooked food not glad handed with a free dessert. Complete and utter BS.
Hali M.,"Woodstock, GA",228,11,,2.0,11/28/2017,"I've had good and bad experiences at this location over the years but the last few times have been so bad, I will drive to barrett parkway if I really am in the mood for chili's (which let's be honest is not super often) The staff is rude, you're hardly greeted at the door, the wait is insane (if you even choose to stay) and something is always wrong with your order. Last time we went, my fries were cold and they messed us several things about our order. Just not worth it. There's too many other good restaurants in this area."
Jeff P.,"Marietta, GA",0,5,,2.0,11/27/2017,"Decided to give this location one last try. Stopped in at 7:15 on a Monday night and was one of three customers at the bar. The bartender greeted me promptly and courteously, brought my drink, amswered questions about the menu and took my order while we had a breif conversation. Never saw her again. Food took about 35 minutes to come out. No one came by to update me on the progress of my order, ask how things were once delivered or if I needed a beverage ( I did ) Finished my meal and waited 15 minutes to get someone's attention to bring me a check, which they did and left promptly while I was opening my wallet to pay so I could finally leave. Thought perhaps I could pay with a card on the tabletop unit and go.  It wasn't working properly. Covered the check with change I could make on my own and left it on the bar. Did I mention I was one of only three people at the bar? Wow"
Kara M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/12/2017,I sat at the bar and maybe saw my bartender a total of 5 minutes behind the bar the entire hour or so I was there. I ordered a ribeye mid rare and it came out well done but I never got the chance to tell my server about it since she barely came around. The restaurant is nice but service lacks badly
Kristy R.,"Woodstock, GA",49,5,,4.0,11/13/2017,"I don't know why this location has such terrible reviews. I feel like most people who go to chain restaurants are the WORST. I have been here probably around 10 times and have never had a bad experience. Sure, we may have a different server every time, but the service is always prompt, friendly, and accommodating. The food is always delish as well. Never had to send anything back. Maybe this location went through a rough patch, or maybe a bunch of asshole yelpers have taken up arms against them, but I think this Chili's is a solid 4 stars. My only complaint is BRING BACK THE CORONARITA!!!!! Can I start a petition?"
Natalie B.,"Woodstock, GA",24,18,4,1.0,7/30/2017,"Just left Chili's and am shocked by the experience. We waited 5 minutes or more before someone greeted us at the door (other people ahead of us left because it took so long). As we were being seated, we were walked past at least 6 dirty tables. The bathrooms (both) were extremely unkept/dirty as well. As we were eating, we could see and hear the kitchen staff horsing around (spraying each other with a water-filled glove), and we also heard them yell out explicative words several times.  The food was also subpar compared to what I have had in the past. My chicken salad was over saturated with dressing. The one positive is the young man who was our waiter (Michael? Mitchell?). He was excellent! Very attentive and sweet. Unfortunately I don't think we will be back to this location."
Mike B.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Horrible service. Went there before a local church service. This review sounds like Ryan's below. After a half hour- three people came by and said, ""Oh we thought you were already done."" My son then thought he saw one of the waiters put our order in. Then 2o minutes later the food arrived finally- cold with wilted lettuce, and soggy cold fries. They offered us a free dessert but why bother. It has been along time since I demured not to tip at a restaurant, but this was extraordiarily bad. Never again. Goodby  Chilis -you gave me the willies. Three other tables next to us were served while we somehow disappeared."
Lindsey F.,"Woodstock, GA",108,8,7,1.0,5/31/2017,I don't know why I keep going here thinking I will have a different experience but every time I come here the service is terrible.  I went at 1230 today for lunch with my children on my lunch break and I sat for 22 minutes and no one had greeted me even after I asked for a manager so we finally had to walk out.  Ridiculous.
Bob S.,"Cumming, GA",0,6,,1.0,5/31/2017,Salad came out with 5 times the dressing anyone could eat.  Dinner/ sides came out 15 mins apart.  Didn't get refills for drinks were very slow and we had to chase waiter through another waiter.  Food was ok. The new fried chicken was very good.  Service poor.
Suzy S.,"Marietta, GA",1,45,4,1.0,7/4/2017,"Food poisoning.......  Should have seen it coming when the table next to us sent their chicken back. Order the chipotle Tex mex bowl, which was good until the cramps started.  Been up all night with diarrhea and vomiting."
Brian N.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,,1.0,6/27/2017,"Great location in Woodstock.  Very reasonable priced beer.  Friendly staff. But, the restaurant has big issues.  Our dinner this past weekend took 2.5 hours.  The managers were cooking.  The waitress, who warned us, took 30 minutes to deliver our beer.  The place was a mess, with multiple tables covered with dirty dishes and food.  The food was OK, but waiting 90 minutes was a bit much.  Of course, we paid full price!"
Nicole C.,"Acworth, GA",0,11,,1.0,5/12/2017,"Lord... Where do I begin. The only reason I am writing a review this long is because we've given this location at least 10 chances hoping it would get better because we LOVE the Chili's on Barrett Parkway, but this location is right down the road from me now. 1. My boyfriend and I have given this location too many chances like I said. Constantly empty, yet we are asked our name and told to wait when I can clearly see 15 booths open. Why should we have to wait, when the restaurant isn't even busy...? 2. When we have been seated, we literally wait 15 minutes for someone to greet us and ask for drinks. I am not exaggerating. We started a stop watch from the moment we sat down and gave the server 15 minutes (ridiculously generous) to get to us before we said we would walk out. I was a server at an extremely busy restaurant before, and let me tell you - if we didn't approach the table within *30 seconds* of customers sitting down we were in trouble. However, many servers (including the manager I can only assume) walked by our table there numerous times and said nothing. By some miracle, a server came up 13 minutes into the test and greeted us with no apology... As if they had no idea we had even been there? Sigh. 3. Very understaffed. I can only assume the turnover rate is up the roof. The staff don't communicate and have no idea who has already spoken to customers, whose table belongs to who, etc. After giving our drink order to the boy that approached us first, another girl came up and asked us what we wanted to drink. Next, after we ordered the queso and chips appetizer and it was brought to us... the girl brought another batch out and looked surprised that we had gotten our food. She literally said: ""oh, these aren't for you?"" we shook our heads. She then turned around and said to the other table ""well would you guys like free chips and queso"" and set it down. Are you kidding me? 4. Our drinks weren't filled ever again through the entire meal. And it took a good 20 minutes of sitting with dirty, empty dishes in front of us to get our check.  I think it's safe to say we will not be coming back... which is too bad because we really wanted to like this location :("
April B.,"Woodstock, GA",10,18,3,3.0,7/14/2016,"3 stars bc our service was on point.. -Egg Roll app was ok, came out hot, very oily and got cold quick- overall rated MEH -Chicken Caribbean Salad looked as if someone took a small handful of half good/half spoiled lettuce, threw it haphazardly on a plate, drowned in some kind of hot lemony greasy-looking juice without even bothering to wipe the excess from the sides before serving to me with meat. Best thing was the fresh pineapples, I assure u it didn't make up for the dish.  Partner had the ribs, they were dry and smelled fishy?? No complaints made bc our server was really cool. No mas Chilis in Woodstock!:("
Paul K.,"Acworth, GA",0,5,1,5.0,2/7/2017,We returned to Chili's this evening and was thoroughly pleased with our service and food. They totally redeemed themselves.
Macy T.,"Birmingham, AL",15,163,430,5.0,8/28/2015,"Great service and very friendly staff here. The bar area is usually my preference to sit at in either a booth or high top table to be around all the tvs. The 2 for $20 is a great deal and the unlimited chips and salsa is worth it. The chocolate molten cake is one of the best desserts ever! Great experience here and consistently great. Sign up for their rewards program and get discounts. The Togo has some flaws, but it is nice that it's curbside."
Kevin H.,"Woodstock, GA",1,14,,1.0,6/24/2017,"We walked in and the hostess said they recently had a power outage and were trying to reboot their computers, and would be unable to seat anyone for 15-20 min.  The power was on, they were serving food, and using terminals to print receipts.  How can you not wear anyone in a clean, empty seat?  They can cook.  I have cash.  Has our society become so dependent on someone being able to push a button that we can't handle a piece of paper for an order."
Ed H.,"Woodstock, GA",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Just ate the location. Not busy ,9:15 at night. Server forgot the appetizer, when food finally got to the table after 50 minutes everything was very cold. Worse location I have every visited. I will be following up with the regional manager."
Chelsea G.,"Canton, GA",1,231,75,3.0,3/4/2017,SO SLOW! We came in around 10pm. Not many people in the restaurant. The bartender/server was very nice and turned the TV onto the sport we wanted to watch. She took our order quickly enough but it took FOREVER for our food to actually come out. We didn't get anything that should have taken that long - chicken tenders and big mouth bites. They definitely need to work on improving their kitchen speeds.
Camille E.,"Woodstock, GA",68,10,3,5.0,1/30/2016,"Food is always excellent as is the service. Our server today was John and he went out of his way to make our family meal wonderful. We used the 2 for $20 special and got yummy food and appetizers at a reasonable price.  We loved the chips, salsa, and guacamole. Too full for dessert this trip but we know from past visits that it is yummy. Love the new open design and the updated menu is awesome. Definitely will keep going back. Great job management. Chili's Towne Lake rocks!"
Cory J.,"Atlanta, GA",5,24,44,5.0,12/1/2014,"The chips and guacamole are great. They make the larger sized guacamole by hand in front of you so it's really fresh and you know what's in it.  Definitely a good thing to order.  Also, the chocolate molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream is awesome.  Vegetarians won't find too many options, but there are some (i.e. mac and cheese, apples and cinnamon, rice and beans, etc.). I tend to come for the chips and guac and of course the desert.  Oh, and yes it can get busy during the week later in the evening, but that's probably a good indication that the food is good.  The staff is friendly, by the way.  Good place to go!"
Brian S.,"Canton, GA",3,48,2,4.0,8/4/2015,"Good food, awesome bartender, perfect place to stop for a quick dinner. Here is a tip; Sit at the bar, full menu and always great people to conversate with."
R J.,"Canton, GA",0,8,,1.0,9/24/2016,"This location is one of the worst. The server forgot to put our order in. 20 minutes later, we asked about our food and she apologized that she forgot to put it in. 30 min later when we FINALLY got it, There was hair in my food and my sons food. Manager didn't care and only asked if we wanted a replacement. We walked out thoroughly disgusted and will never return."
Olivia E.,"Alpharetta, GA",3,52,6,1.0,2/20/2016,"The service here is horrendous. By the time your food comes out you're most likely dead or close to it and won't need food. Also don't bother ordering online thinking your food will be ready by the time you get there, because it won't. Not that you will know because even if you select for them to give you the food in your car they will let you rot out there waiting in your car until you either die of natural causes or a loved one calls the restaurant for you because you're so hangry you can't call. HOWEVER, great news! There is an APPLEBEES (they actually bring out the food AND are friendly) and a Marlows Tavern and a five guys just one exit up with excellent service! Also there is a La Parilla across the street, with actual Mexican cuisine."
Maria R.,"Rome, GA",3,8,,4.0,7/2/2015,We were seated promptly the hostess was very accommodating and asked where we preferred to sit. We ordered the 2 for $20 dinner- chili cheese fries as appetizer and sizzling fajitas as an entree. The food was great!  Additionally-We did not have to wait for the server to bring us our bill as there is a Ziosk system at every table that allows you to pay your bill along with leaving a tip. No more waiting!! All restaurants need to invest in this type of technology.
Dennis B.,"Woodstock, GA",0,14,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Sometimes it takes a less than satisfactory dinner at a competitor to make you truly appreciate what you have in your own backyard.  We ate at the Applebee's in Snellville and it was over-priced and terrible food.  The salsa for their chips & salsa was served in a tiny condiment cup like the kind used for serving butter.  No lie.  I so wanted the bottomless chips & salsa at our local Chili's instead!  In fact, I've actually made a meal of Chili's chips & salsa before and ended up taking my entree home for the next day...The salsa is delicious and the chips are always made fresh, not stale like the ones at Applebee's. I almost always get the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich & fries at Chili's.  It's simply a great sandwich!  They seem to have made the bun smaller to make the chicken look larger, but there was no reason for this.  The chicken breast on this sandwich has always been huge!  The only thing I would change is give the option of blue cheese instead of ranch to compliment the buffalo sauce. We sit in the bar area where there's usually open tables and plenty of sports channels on.  The free kid's meals coupons through e-mail are nice, but they kind of screwed up the new rewards program.  Can't use the coupons and redeem rewards at the same time.  If I've EARNED the rewards then I should be able to cash them in without limitations, right? Service is great here!  So much better than at Applebee's.  Can't remember ever complaining about a single meal here over the course of years.  Keep up the good work Towne Lake Chili's....You're the BEST!"
Theresa U.,"Canton, GA",14,119,79,5.0,7/1/2014,"This Chili's was a hot mess in the past. Whatever they changed it worked. We had great service and great food. Our drinks were refilled before we asked and it was clean.  We ordered two plates of the big month bites, I've included a photo.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the experience."
Kevin W.,"Atlanta, GA",18,20,2,1.0,12/1/2014,"Came in after work to relax and have an enjoyable meal. I walked in expecting to be greeted by someone, but after waiting a few minutes without seeing any employees, I decided to goto the bar area.  There were 3 gentlemen at the bar already, so I saddled up to the bar to get a good meal on a Monday night. The bartender was kept busy with orders from around Chilis for a good 5 minutes before looking my direction. I finally got my drink and meal order in. I ordered the Sweet and Smoky Craft burger. 15 minutes later, he comes back to me and states that they have run out of onion rings. I find that odd for a light Monday night, but okay. Give me fries instead. Finally, the food comes out. The pickles that are hyped beyond belief - taste like they were left in dirty dishwater. The burger - looks and tastes like Wendy's burgers, for twice the price. The fries - very small handful, but edible. Not coming back anytime soon."
Kate M.,"Dunwoody, GA",218,141,77,3.0,10/16/2014,"This Chili's is similar to others I've visited - no better, no worse. You know exactly what you're getting and the experience is predictable. I visited this location with my brother and we were seated immediately on a weekday evening. The interior was definitely upgraded since the last time I had visited and it looked nice, until we got to the table. Now the have mini-screens available for you to play games, order food, pay your bill, etc. You can also watch tv and clips from online sources. Uhhh isn't the point of going out to dinner with someone to make conversation with them? As if looking at our phones all the time wasn't bad enough, now we have another screen to add into the mix! Our server was friendly and helpful. I definitely didn't want to replace him with a computer screen! He was able to answer our questions and get our orders in promptly. One thing I loved seeing was that they have expanded their 2 for $20 menu. There are a lot more choices in the entrees section and they have included LC or lighter choice option as well. It made it a lot easier for me to go for the veggies than my usual chicken crispers.  The food itself was pretty standard. First came the appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and the person from the kitchen was certainly in a hurry. He came out, through the dish down along with plates, and at a speed where if you blinked you would have missed it, he was gone again! He didn't say anything, threw the food down, and didn't offer to refill our drinks which were noticeably empty. I'm all for prompt service but there wasn't really any serving in this equation - it was a drop and dash. The sticks themselves were pretty cool and the marinara lukewarm. I was glad they didn't immediately burn my mouth but I would have liked them at least a little hotter. My brother got the chicken crispers and he loved them as always. Crispy, gooey, and well seasoned, I was happy to steal a few bites. I got the 6 oz. sirloin with broccoli. I didn't care much for the pico de gallo topping on it, but the steak was cooked well and the broccoli still retained some crispness. I hate mushy vegetables and was glad to see that there was actually some semblance of crunch when I dug in. Our waiter came through a few more times to bring us refills, make sure everything tasted good, and offered some dessert offerings. We politely passed and he told me that if I was paying with a card I could swipe it right there at the reader on the table. After following the instructions I was able to determine my tip and a receipt printed out for me to take. They offered options for no receipt and email receipt as well. I guess this was a handy feature and you know the final total with tip since the server won't need to re-run your card afterwards. I just hope this technology doesn't replace the quality assistance servers provide. I can see it helping even the scale though if they are understaffed or overwhelmed with customers."
Sam D.,"Acworth, GA",0,9,1,1.0,8/2/2015,"Full discretion: the food was very good.  HOWEVER... the service was atrocious. I placed an order to pick up after work last week, looking forward to having a nice meal as soon as I got home. When I arrived at this location, I waited briefly in my car as I had chosen the curb-side service online. After not being served, I decided to go inside to get my food.  I then waited at the ""To-Go"" counter for 5 minutes as NO ONE acknowledged my existence. At least 4 different employees made eye-contact with me, but I received no, ""Can I help you?"", no ""Just one minute"", no ""Someone will be right with you"". Nothing.  (to clarify: I don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for my food, but I expect to be greeted within the first minute or two) Finally someone came up to me and asked if I had been helped. I said no, and another associate eventually came to take my card, placed the receipt on the counter for me to sign, and walked away. No ""sorry for the wait"", no ""thank you"", no ""have a nice evening"". Again, nothing. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed with my experience at this location (Chili's on Towne Lake Pkwy next to the QT), and I will not be returning. If you take pleasure in being ignored and treated poorly, then I would strongly recommend going to this Chili's. However, if you are a normal human being who enjoys being treated respectfully, I would take your hard-earned money elsewhere."
Anissa S.,"Woodstock, GA",16,132,4,3.0,6/23/2015,Food was fresh and service was quick. I don't really appreciate being called Hun or honey by servers nor do I like having the server sit at my table while I place my order. Not professional at all.
Cadi D.,"Woodstock, GA",44,11,9,5.0,9/18/2015,"Great service and food for the price point,  chips and salsa are by far the best in town and I love the newer table side guacamole!!  The management at this location has it together!"
Jennifer D.,"Woodstock, GA",104,208,361,4.0,7/29/2015,We were seated promptly for lunch although there was a large lunch crowd. The southwestern egg rolls are consistently great. There are plenty of reasonably priced lunch options and the pay at the table feature is so convenient.
Olivia E.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,157,221,5.0,8/16/2014,"Great bar specials! The house margarita doesn't disappoint. Great service and atmosphere, too."
Nancy K.,"Woodstock, GA",11,88,15,3.0,7/25/2014,"Average at best.  Went today for lunch with my daughter.  We were seated immediately and had a chance to look at the menus for about 8 minutes before anyone else noticed we were there.  The location was 1/2 full at most. The Texas cheese fries were cool when they came out and had to use a knife and fork to separate the fries since the ""melted"" cheese was solid again. My entree was warm but not hot.  The chicken crispers were almost rock hard.  My daughters fajitas were actually good and well thankfully she let me eat her onions and peppers.   It was her idea to come here as I wanted to dine at a bistro that we never tried before.  Next time mom will choose the restaurant! They now have a pay at table service and while it is convenient it is very impersonal as no one ever thanked us for coming or anything.  We never saw the server once she pointed to us using this.  It was also filthy."
Kelley W.,"Woodstock, GA",1,26,2,5.0,2/14/2015,"Maggie and Kristin took excellent care of us at the bar! They were quick to bring our drinks and made good recommendations on what to order. Our food came out fast, and correctly with special orders."
Ralph S.,"Woodstock, GA",13,146,199,4.0,4/10/2013,Beth and I enjoy this location for lunch and an occasional dinner. Food is always good and the bar keeps us refreshed!! Manager is great and waitstaff is always friendly! We often meet after work for a drink and appetizer.
William G.,"Woodstock, GA",0,11,1,1.0,10/26/2013,"Bad service. I'm not sure who our server was, because we had 3 different people visit our table. It took far too long to get any service from anyone. The staff seemed confused and nobody knew what the other was doing.  When our appetizer finally arrived, it was missing the sauce and the girl who delivered it didn't ask if we needed anything. By the time we flagged down an employee and got the missing part of the appetizer, the main course had appeared.  The server was awful and looked dirty, which is disconcerting in a restaurant. When this particular server actually visited our table, he didn't look at us. He was just reciting scripted remarks while staring at a girl's behind."
Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,4.0,4/17/2012,"There are some bad reviews of this location.  I often stop in here, and yes I have gotten some terrible service in the past. I have gotten good service, as well. This ocasion I sat at the bar and had my meal with Eric as my server. My food was fresh and hot and my drink was always full. I can't really ask for more than that. Even the bathroom was fairly clean."
