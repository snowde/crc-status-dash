Elisabeth F.,"Canton, GA",69,13,1,1.0,8/23/2015,Our waiter was the worst! He fluttered around the restaurant not bothering to check on us.
S K.,"Woodstock, GA",0,36,6,1.0,3/24/2012,"What happened to our neighborhood Chili's?  We could always count on going to Chili's for a decent meal before the movies or just a place to dine with the family.  This visit to Chili's wasn't so good.  Granted it has been sometime since we've been there, for a nationwide chain to have gone the way this Chili's has gone is inexcusable. The service was sub par, my wife had to ask for crackers three time before receiving them, in fact she finished her bowl of chili long before they arrived.  She said her salad was good, tough to mess that up I suppose.  My entree was horrible.  I ordered a new item from their menu, the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  First of all they didn't put any cheese that I could tell on the sandwich.  Second, the meat was far a few between, more peppers and onions than meat.  Third, the meat - it had a very plastic taste and hate to say it, but almost a rancid flavor.  My stomach is not feeling all that well right now.  Side note, the fries were good. The employees seemed more interested in socializing among themselves, creating a bit of a stir in the far back seating area of the establishment where they were rolling silverware.  A member of management was there eating his Reuben sandwich, allowing this behavior one booth away from ours.  Seriously, there must be somewhere else in the establishment this can take place, perhaps the ""back of the house"". I suspect the Chili's Corporation is keeping this location alive; but that may change soon when they realize the financial burden is too costly.  Time to flip management staff"
Rick C.,"Woodstock, GA",0,7,3,1.0,5/29/2015,How can any resturant not have ceaser salads on the menu. Chili's continues to change the men. This has always been one of my families favorite places to eat but we no longer consider it on the list. I would not recommend this restaurant chain to anyone at this point.
David P.,"Dublin, GA",29,226,19,2.0,6/13/2012,"After a Woodstock HS dance recital a group of 11 arrived for lunch.  We got seated in 4 m.  Most of the table ordered water and the kids got milk, 2 got soda(pretty easy right?).  The waitress took our food order and then the fun began.  I guess updating your facebook account was more important than my table.  Every drink was dry and half the food orders went to the wrong person.  This seems to be the new thing with Chili's, they hire these hip kids and they could care less about the customer.  Fries were too salty and the food was average at best."
Tom N.,"Woodstock, GA",51,362,204,1.0,8/6/2012,"So another horrible experience at this location. We did a phone ahead on a Sunday they said come in at one no problem. We do just that hostess tells us it will be a few minutes. The rest of our party arrives 7 total, they knew this on the phone. Now the waits over an hour? Wtf mate. They then say we can sit at 2 separate tables, what a joke. This place is a mess management wise. We dipped out and went to La Parilla right across the street. They were packed but we were seated without hesitation."
Tj M.,"Canton, GA",0,6,,5.0,4/10/2013,"Love this Chili's! My husband and I have been frequent customers for the last 5years. We have had a couple not so perfect visits...but more consistently we have had great service. This place is frequently packed at dinner time, so plan for a long wait. My only negative is...people who sit with their kids in the bar area! If We wanted to eat around children, We would sit on the family side...sheeez!!"
Lena R.,"Woodstock, GA",2,80,50,5.0,1/27/2011,"I love CARIBBEAN SALAD! This is the best salad I have eaten in a long time.  I ordered it every time I went there since last September of 2010.  I would have eaten it more, but cannot afford going to the restaurant more often."
john d.,"Acworth, GA",0,23,2,1.0,12/30/2010,"My wife and I have been going to this Chilis for the past 2 years. However we only go to this one when we don't want to travel to Kennesaw since we live in Canton.  That is because the service is so incredibly bad! The employees are rude and the managers are even ruder. However the food is typical Chili's food, awesome bar food! Our last visit was exactly that the last visit to this location. My wife and I showed up at 5:54pm (Yes it is strange to know the exact time. I check my clock every time I roll into a Chilis) While we waited for the waiter/waitress to greet us 3 waitresses walked by, 2 waiters and the manager on duty Michael Prior. When 6:25 rolled around (I set my alarm clock on my phone) and no one had greeted us or taken a drink order or even acknowledged we were sitting there we figured it was time to leave. On the way out we noticed 2 groups that came in after us eating apitizers. So my wife asked for the manager on duty Michael Prior. When she told him our experience and that this was not the first bad experience at his restaurant all he said is ""All I can say is it is just messed up!"" All I could do is laugh and walk out. I informed Chilis HDQ about my bad experience and they did what they most preach they ignore my frustrations with them. So as long as they keep serving good food that is all they will have going for them. They stop that and they are screwed."
