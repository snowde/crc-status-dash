Albany C.,"Albany, NY",0,2,5,3.0,12/26/2017,"Positives: Staff was all very polite, food quality was great. Negatives:  Cutlery did not have a clean look, plate was dirty,  food order was not accurate,  drinks were not topped off. The staff were all very polite. We were seated quickly, the restaurant was clean. The steak was requested with no peppers but was brought out with peppers. after bringing that to their attention their remedy was to bring the stake back to the kitchen take the peppers off and give us the food back tasting like peppers.  The whole purpose was to avoid the taste of peppers, if I had an allergy, this could have been a major problem.  The cutlery did not look very clean  And the bread plate was dirty. It's possible that someone was spraying cleaner on a rag and a nearby stack of plates were sprayed with cleaner.  The drinks were not refreshed at all,  after one hour even if a cup is half full of soda it is water down at this point and should be replaced. The taste of the food was great. The food quality was great. There were a few annoyances but over all good enough for me to return."
Joan R.,"Fort Mill, SC",13,145,670,4.0,11/19/2017,"Although my friends have eaten here before and enjoyed their meals, this is the 1st time my dining mate and I had lunch here .  I do have to say the menu is incredible , perhaps a bit overwhelming with so many choices but I like  that the menu also offers  lesser calorie count items.  We had friendly attentive service and even though this was a busy Sunday we were seated within 5 minutes for a booth for 2 . Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and explained any questions we had about the menu . I opted for the soup of the day which was a chicken  artichoke shitake  mushroom soup . It was creamy and delicious. I also ordered the appetizer of a chicken butter lettuce wrap with side sauces and a side of sweet potato fries . My dining mate   ordered the Sheila's chicken salad which had  a citrusy peanut vinagrette . He said it was delicious and refreshing . Portion  sizes were plenty , food came out nicely plated and hot food came out hot . Menu a bit pricey in my opinion for some items . Our lunch for two, over $40. No Room for desserts but the cheese cakes and desserts in the glass cakes looked splendid It was a busy Sunday and it seemed every employee was doing their job to please the customers in every way . I would certainly come back again for a dinner meal."
Jessica G.,"Margate, FL",481,618,1408,3.0,10/25/2017,"This was the first time I have ever actually had a real meal at The Cheesecake Factory! I am no longer one of the few who has never been. We chose this location for a little family reunion of sorts...about ten people, a few kids, on a Tuesday evening. My aunt had called ahead to make sure they'd be able to accommodate our somewhat larger group and they were great about getting us all a table together in the bar area and making us happy...so thank you to the staff! My brother an I arrived a little early and decided to grab a drink at the bar and take advantage of happy hour pricing. Happy hour here only goes til 6pm (boo) but it includes well drinks, house wines and a few fancier cocktails for $6. Draft beers are priced a little lower. They also have quite a few happy hour bites available at a discounted price, but we didn't partake since we were waiting for dinner. Once the whole family arrived we were seated and began looking over the menu. It took us awhile to order because we were catching up with each other and having a great time, and the menu is HUGE. I know eating out is never really a healthy choice, but seeing the calorie counts on the menu were kind of terrifying. I automatically steered myself away from the pastas and the fried items because just seeing that calories was so scary. I ended up going for the vegan cobb salad and added shrimp...so not so vegan anymore. The food took quite awhile to come out, but we were happy because we were chatting. The salad was large, I took half home, and was a bed of romaine covered in avocado, asparagus, chickpeas, tomato, beets (red and golden), and of course my added shrimp. There were only four but they were a decent size and had a nice char to them. My cousin's salad was lacking avocado despite being listed as coming with it and the waiter was happy to bring her out a plate to correct the issue. Overall it was a good meal. It seems you can't leave the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake so we ordered a few slices to share among the table. They're huge so unless that's all your eating I can't imagine finishing a whole slice. At the table we had cookies and cream cheesecake, and salted caramel cheesecake that I tried. Both super rich and sweet...I'm not too big on sweets but it is the Cheesecake Factory and they have it down. The salted caramel did a decent job of cutting the sweet so I could really enjoy it. Overall great place for upscale family dining, but all that considered it is a chain and they aren't doing anything too unique or amazing, so three stars it is."
Yaran S.,"Pittsfield, MA",109,189,943,3.0,10/18/2017,"This is my very first Cheesecake Factory experience. Things we ordered here were either a hit or miss. First of all, complimentary bread. I love to try all kinds of bread. Their bread came out warm, and I immediately fell in love with the brown oats one(don't know the name). I ate all of them with butter :p We ordered several appetizers. The only thing impressed me was nachos. So delicious! Those tortilla chips were so crunchy and tasty. Highly recommend! I had herb salmon with asparagus and mashed potato which was quite disappointing. Just mediocre salmon and mashed potato in a bland weird sauce.   I tried several cheesecakes but none was impressive. I love desserts but really not a fan of their cheesecakes. The Godiva brownie sundae was good, especially those chopped almonds. I will only go back for the nachos"
Courtney W.,"Mankato, MN",1,50,,2.0,1/7/2018,"We tried the egg roll sampler, and two out of the four were very good. The salmon egg roll and avocado roll are definitely worth ordering again. Our main dishes were disappointing. As a southerner, I was happy to see southern fried catfish. Well..there was nothing southern about it. Instead of a traditional cornmeal breading, they used a chicken batter. Also, they served the belly meat with the gray fat left on. Yuck. The fish did not have a good flavor at all. My husband ordered spicy cashew chicken. The chicken was tender, but the sauce was terrible. It tasted nothing like cashew chicken.  If we go back, we'll choose something different or play it safe and order the egg rolls we liked."
Daisy R.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",22,32,250,5.0,12/28/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory it's a excellent place! Sea food, steak, pasta salad, of course the cheese cake it's really delicious, very trendy, excellent customer service, the decoration it's really amazing, clean environment and professionalism! Always my pleasure visit them with my family and friends! Keep the good work Cheesecake Factory! Between Juniors & Cheesecake Factory it's hard to choose!"
Anuja T.,"Indianapolis, IN",31,53,420,4.0,10/31/2017,Got cheesecake to go . The kid( a girl ) at the counter was really really helpful . She gave us all the options really properly . The waiting area was full but we were given full attention :-) She was the sweetest person :-) i just wish I remembered here name  :-( ..
Roger K.,"Clifton Park, NY",127,583,2672,3.0,6/1/2017,"Twenty-one pages!  You don't even need to count them because they number them.  That's right, the Cheesecake Factory menu is 21 pages long.  BUT WAIT!  There's more... there are also ""Specials"" inserts and other inserts that they want to call your attention to. I don't know about you, but unless I already know exactly what I want before I arrive, or am willing to just look at the pictures and let others at the table order family style for sharing, that is way too much decision making to deal with when attempting to enjoy a relaxing meal. And don't expect to relax much with the loud din of conversation going on all around you, even when the place is not packed - not to mention the clanking and clatter of silverware and plates from the service areas reminding me of the sounds in the old Automat cafeterias of NYC.  Oy Boy! Did you know they only have three beers on tap?  Sure, they had a few bottles too, but if you're a draft nut your best bet is either the Southern Tier IPA ($7) or the Bell's Seasonal ($7) which this night was an Amber Ale. My wife came with the intent of ordering Guacamole.  I was the first to find it on page five, I think.  It is billed as Guacamole Made-to-Order ($11.95) and our server asked us how spicy we would like it - mild, medium or spicy.  We requested ""spicy"" but we think they may have forgotten to put any jalapeños in it.  The salsa that was also served with the chips had more spice to it than the guacamole.  Other than the lack of jalapeño flavor it was OK.  At least it was freshly made. My wife also ordered the White Chicken Chili ($13.95), no I don't recall what page it was on, but I think it was listed on both the main menu and the Skinnylicious ® menu.  The pieces of chicken breast were mixed with white beans, roasted green chili peppers , onions, garlic, and cream, garnished with steamed rice and salsa.  It was a large portion so at least half of it came home, and it will probably taste even better after all the ingredients have a chance to meld. I zeroed in on the two-page Specials Menu and selected Pasta Napoletana ($13.95).  On top of parmesan cream pasta was Italian sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, mushrooms, pepper, bacon, onions, and garlic with a tomato sauce.  The best part was the sausage which had a good flavor and a little spice.  The thin pepperoni slices had a nice crispness, maybe from being sautéed.  Nothing special from the meatballs, but again half of this large portion came home and I'm looking forward to all the flavors blending together over time. Our server was friendly, attentive and conversational.  Maybe our next visit will be simply for some cheesecake to-go!"
Melissa F.,"Albany, NY",82,91,22,3.0,11/28/2017,"Been here a bunch of times - there is always a wait. I enjoy the orange chicken and tasting different cheesecakes but the wait time and cost always deter us from going their more often. The quality of the food is not really worth the price. I wish they had a sampler for cheesecake as it's always too hard to pick just one! We may go back in the future, but not in any rush."
Eric S.,"Latham, NY",3,66,16,1.0,9/29/2017,"15 years ago, a Cheesecake Factory was a fresh, original concept.  Today, an 18 page menu results in too many poorly made dishes that are a mishmash of castoffs from an old Bennigans or Friday's menu.   Service is frankly painfully slow and if I must be honest, even the desserts are tired at best.   I do feel a little bad for the servers as they try to comfort the masses, tired of waiting for their orders...in the end, bearing the blame for a concept that is unsupportable in the end.   If I have to hazard a guess, the Cheesecake Factory will be going the way of many other outdated American factories...by 2020, they're only a memory."
Chantelle L.,"Schenectady, NY",831,414,1246,4.0,8/13/2017,"The spicy chipotle pasta never disappoints and the cheesecake is always the reason we go. The chipotle pasta needs more vegetables like the asparagus and peas, thats the minus one star, it's not consistent every time I go. The waitstaff is awesome, their cocktails are pricier than some of the meals which is a little absurd. $12.75 for a mojito is a bit much.  I love the location and refuse to come on weekends due to the lines. Great appetizers and they do have a happy hour with all my favorite appetizers on there."
Rebecca M.,"Middletown, NY",149,35,29,2.0,9/8/2017,"It took our server 7 mins to acknowledge us, rudely placed the water down without even introducing herself.  Asked for extra lemons and gave me one slice. Silverware and cups were extremely dirty. Normally I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory but this location gave me an unpleasant experience."
Emily Z.,"Albany, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Not family friendly AT A MALL with stroller.  I walked an hour around the mall trying to get my baby to sleep on a stroller.  When he finally fell asleep, I wanted lunch at cheesecake factory but they said they can't accommodate a stroller.  They didn't offer to move a table or tell me to wait to see what they can do. They said it was a fire hazard and that only if I had a car seat.  I understand that I can't park the stroller on the aisle but they didn't offer any other solution.  They could have asked me to wait so they can rearrange a table so that the stroller can fit.   This is at a mall location, how they could not accommodate a stroller is beyond me. A tired new mother don't have time to deal with this shitty customer service."
Alyssa B.,"Schenectady, NY",15,6,2,1.0,10/9/2017,This is ridiculous - I asked for a cheddar cheeseburger and was given a hamburger. I told the waiter after waiting 15 minutes and having to actually get up from my seat to search the waiter out and let him know. He apologized and gave me a peice of cold cheddar cheese to now go on my cold burger... is this real life?? And we pay $16 for a plate of this?? GET OUT OF HERE!!!!!! Never again. Do not go to this place. You will be sorry.
Lesley O.,"East Meadow, NY",1442,604,1483,4.0,9/25/2017,"Well, I didn't eat but I did get a slice of cheesecake to go because I was staying across the street at a hotel while in Albany this weekend. It was very crowded with a wait I would assume to be 25-40 minutes, which I am pleased to see still occurs for the restaurant corporation that was once my life for 13 years. I can appreciate that I saw servers and bussers pre bussing tables on the patio, and even more impressed that the cheesecake display was full and accurate. Each cake was full with at least 4 slices ind the glass was clean and spot free of handprints. The cashiers were incredibly busy with the phone ringing off the hook with orders coming in (which I have lived through this experience oh too many times), but even when I was on the phone taking an order, I'd make eye contact with guests standing in front of me to acknowledge I know you are here and will be right with you. The second cashier came up and was kind when I asked which cheesecake I should order because I've had them all at least a dozen times (probably more) and wanted to try one of the new ones. I was conflicted between the cold Brew Coffee Cheesecake and the Hazelnut Nutella Crunch and she told me to go with the coffee one. I'm glad I listened because it was delicious! The various layers of Coffee Cheesecake and Coffee cream with chocolate pieces mixed in was divine. Im glad I went and got one, it had to been way too long."
Jenna C.,"Pittsfield, MA",0,2,,4.0,12/19/2017,LOVE THE CHEESECAKE. however the decor is bad. generic warm tones all around
Shady C.,"Rock Tavern, NY",3,10,1,2.0,8/27/2017,"Let's start. Dirty flatware,fly or flies not sure if same one throughout the entire meal. Ordered famous meatloaf. Super salty gravy over loaf and mashed so had to scrape gravy off to attempt to get through meal. When trying to eat mashed I found black beans in parts of my mashed that were not supposed to be there. Manager came over with so lame excuse of beans being next to mashed and did nothing but offer his apologies.  No worries as this is my first and last visit this this overpriced crap food loaded with sodium. Will find a Mom and Pop restaurant next time like I should have to begin with."
Tenesia B.,"Schenectady, NY",106,20,91,4.0,9/20/2017,"Wanted to celebrate my friends birthday with a few drinks. Truly one of my favorite places to visit for an awesome wholesome meal. Portions are generous. Usually leave with leftovers. Red velvet cheesecake is delicious. I would recommend everyone to try. But there are so many different types of cheesecake, finding your own favorite won't be a problem."
Nicole M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,28,1,3.0,12/29/2017,"My fiancé and I visited for an early dinner while driving through Albany on the way to Vermont. Generally, we are Cheesecake Factory fans. The food and service are usually pretty consistent and there is something for everyone on their extensive menu. This visit was lacking in terms of service and general politeness. When we entered, there was a line for the hostess stand, which we know is typical for dinner time at any Cheesecake Factory. After a short wait, we made it to the front of the line and were about to walk up to the desk when two women walked up from the side and abruptly cut in front of us to put their name on the list! Yes, extremely rude, but we'll get over it. Finally get our name on the list and ten minutes later, my name is called. Before my fiancé and I can even walk back over to the host stand, another group walks up and the hostess seats them. Here I am thinking, ""Okay, I have a generic first name so she probably shares my name."" However, over the course of the next few minutes, our name is not called while groups who came in after us were. Went up to the hostess stand again and sure enough, the wrong group took our table. We were apologized to and assured that we would get the next table. However, more time passed and we were still not called. Went up once again and the woman I spoke to did not even remember talking to me, but finally brought us to a table. Not a great first impression. At the table, we were happy to be finally have the chance to relax and enjoy a nice meal. After looking over the menu for about ten minutes, we noticed that none of the servers had greeted us yet. We continued to wait, but sure enough, none of the servers in our section stopped to greet us or even bring over some waters. We were eventually able to politely flag over a server, and the rest of the meal was fine, but that was certainly strike three for our experience. Considering the fact that we began to question whether or not we were invisible to the surrounding guests and employees, we were not impressed."
Mike M.,"Clifton Park, NY",44,99,208,3.0,9/7/2017,The place is always good! I ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp. Bad choice .... food was wet. Took forever for it to come out. And then they took it back and gave me the skinny streak medallion. Again took forever !!!!! Service is very slow.
Kate B.,"Albany, NY",79,3,,3.0,1/6/2018,"Our server was great, he was efficient and timely, we never had empty drink glasses.  He was friendly and helpful when it came to accommodating our baby- I wish I could remember his name. The food was delicious. However, the hostess table seemed a bit disorganized and the hostesses and were not warm or friendly. My husband forgot to let the hostess table know we had a baby and so we had to wait much longer then expected in order to have a high chair.  When I inquired how much longer our wait was bc we couldn't stick around another 30 minutes with a hungry child and had already been waiting an additional 20 after being told 10-15 minutes, the hostess reminded me that we made the mistake and now we had to wait and refused to give me an estimated time- she could only tell me, ""when the next large table becomes available"". She was demeaning and very rude when I was simply inquiring as I have a hungry baby and needed to plan accordingly- and explained so.  They also need to be a little more discreet when sizing people up to see if they will fit in a booth.  The hostess staff are the first impression so it's important that they are trained to accommodate guests and show grace when mistakes are made rather than make us feel punished for a misunderstanding.  Your staff also need additional training in accommodating children as this was not our first negative experience."
Abdullah Z.,"Pine Hills, Albany, NY",11,1,,1.0,11/22/2017,This restaurant is not at all worth the price point.  The cheesecake is overpriced. If you're thinking of getting a strawberry cheesecake DON'T. It's literally a tiny piece of cake with strawberry and whipped cream ON THE SIDE as Opposed to on top where it should. Save your money and go to the whole foods next door and get yourself some gluten free cheesecake.
Xenia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,242,468,5.0,12/31/2016,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory location was great. Despite some of the negative reviews, I enjoyed my time here. We came in for lunch around 1:00 and was seated immediately. I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo, which was very delicious! It had a nice amount of spices that really give it that authentic gumbo flavor. I also ordered the red velvet cheesecake which was very rich, so I had to take that home and eat in multiple settings."
Dutch S.,"Albany, NY",0,8,2,4.0,10/22/2017,Good ambiance and decor for an attachment to a mall. All the staff I've encountered are very engaging especially the bar staff which are all trained in house. A nice change of pace from the food court or a five guys if your willing to spend a couple extra dollars.
Heather O.,"New Windsor, NY",62,61,5,2.0,8/19/2017,"Loud, crowded, slow service and they DOUBLE CHARGED me.  It really is a factory and patrons are cattle."
Bushra A.,"Vero Beach, FL",72,104,361,5.0,8/18/2017,"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews about this location but all the times I have been here, the service, food and quality has been consistent. We have had many big outings with large groups and even those were handled great. The cheesecakes are definitely the best items there. My favorite is the Dulce de Leche. I also try to make it there during National Cheesecake Day when they have half price cheesecake"
Matt S.,"Voorheesville, NY",0,13,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Total disappointment never even ordered. Attitude from the server because we didn't want to sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple. Then we were put at a dirty table surrounded by dirty tables, and this is at opening! Then left waiting for someone to come clean it. We left  Wow Cheesecake factory get your act together. Your managers don't walk the floor before opening? Not a very good impression for first time customers."
Riff R.,"Albany, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/16/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is filled with not only elegance, but great stature as well. unfortunately, the food was not up to par with my families great obsession with food. I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing evening and thought the food was 2 apples"
Steve F.,"Kingston, NY",0,11,2,1.0,10/14/2017,"We've been coming to this location for over 10 years, but I felt I had to write a review. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, they were awful, the dish tasted like it was microwaved. The rice and the black beans inedible. My wife had the chicken piccata, which she had in NJ 2 weeks ago, no taste , no capers, the chicken looked slimey. It's really gone downhill. And to top it all off the waitress never asked how anything was. So let her know it's awful here, way below the others cheesecake factories I've been to."
Courtney P.,"Nashville, TN",20,1,,1.0,4/22/2017,"If I could give a zero star review, I would. This place is terrible. I have been to multiple other locations in many other states. I believe this one is riding on the coat tails of the others and using the name to create business. We went in today for lunch. We arrived at 12:30 with a party of 6. We waited for 30 minutes to be seated which was what we were quoted so that is fine. However, it is what happened after that solidified the dissatisfaction. We waited for an hour for our food. We watched others that were seated after us now have eaten, had dessert, and were leaving. The waitress continued to say that it would be only a minute more. We finally received our food. It was mediocre, and it was now 2:30. We continued to wait for boxes before flagged some other poor soul down to get boxes and order a few desserts. After all of this, we finally noticed a manager as we were exiting the building. We told him about our displeasure, and he proceeded to blow our claims off saying that maybe our waitress didn't put our food in right away.  Needless to say, we will never be back for anything more than the cheesecake. Don't bother going here. The food is high priced, the service is terrible, and it is not worth your time."
Matt M.,"Watervliet, NY",35,9,,2.0,3/1/2017,"Packed house on President's Day for Dinner, but seated in 20 minutes.  We went here because we had a gift card.  The ambience is faux elegance.  Two of us and we were seated so close to another couple that we might as well have came with them.   If we pushed our table 8 inches to the left we would have been a 4 top.  Three requests and a 20 minute wait for water.  No huge deal.  Wife's straw was in a wrapper, mine unwrapped with waiter holding / pinching the end.   Nasty.  Probably came from the table over yonder.  Didn't use it obviously. Hamburgers and fries were timely and good, no complaints with the food.  Cheese adds $4 bucks to the burgers.  Not enticing enough to come back with so many other places to eat.  Man what a CASH COW this place must be, I just don't get it.  Sign me up!"
Nathan L.,"Norfolk, VA",0,1,,5.0,9/30/2017,"You know what you're getting into when you come here. The quality is consistent and the service is polite. The most difficult part of eating here is selecting from their giant menu, good luck with that."
Ashley G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",28,8,11,3.0,9/3/2017,This was my first time going here at Albany for my birthday. It was very busy for a Thursday night ( we had to wait for 1 hour to get seated even though they said it was only a 20 minute wait). I asked the waiter to surprise me in serving me food & he did not fail to impress. I may definitely be coming back and try better food.
Karissa J.,"Schenectady, NY",53,8,,3.0,12/28/2016,It is hit and miss here. The first time we went was the worst restaurant experience we had. We didn't even see a waiter until 20 minutes into being there and we were switched throughout with different waiters. The noodles were burnt and dry.  That being said we returned once with friends and had a great experience and the food was great. I would return quickly if I didnt have the first experience but I do not know if this time or the last was a fluke.
Joseph K.,"Schenectady, NY",0,10,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"Tonight I called at 6:33 and spoke to Zackary. I told him I would like to place my name on the call ahead service for a party of three. Zackary told me they currently had a 30 minute wait and he said he would take my name and number and add us to the list. I thank him and told him he was great, his reply ""I try"". He said a Joseph we will have a table waiting for you in approximately 30 min. We will see you when you get here. I again thanked him and hung up the phone. When we got there the placed was packed elbow to elbow with people. When I checked into the podium, the young lady chuckles and said I'm sorry, it's a 45 minute wait and offered to give me an buzzer that would go off when our take is ready. I tried to explain that we had called and spoke to Zackary and he said it was about a 30 minute wait when I called and that he would have a table waiting for is when we arrived. A manager was standing within an ear shot of this conversation and walked over and told me I was wrong, that they don't take call ahead seating and that now I was at the restaurant, I would have to wait my full 45 minutes if I wanted a table. I noticed that there was a young man with dark hair and glasses standing behind him acting sheepishly, I looked at the name tag and the name on it was Zackary. When I asked to speak with him, his manager whispered something in his ear and he disappeared. Less than 20 seconds later another manager appears and chimes in said obviously you have never dined with us before and informs me that they don't take call ahead seating and if I still wanted a table I would have to wait the new quoted time of 45 minutes. At that time, I mentioned to him we live in Colonie and have been there several times in fact our friends and family had bought us gift certificates in the amount of $100.00, and we were there for dinner to redeem them before we lost them jokingly. At this point, the second manager to arrive takes it up a notch implying that I was hard of hearing and loudly states that the wait for a table was 45 minutes. He stood there with his arms folded in front front of himself glaring at me posturing as if I was crazy and dared me to say another thing. At that point I was discussed with the level of service and all I could do is reach into my pocket and hand him the gift cards and said we would never be back.  We went to Texas Roadhouse and waited less than 10 minutes and were seated.  So in summary if you want to be lied to over the phone, wait a ridiculous amount of time after you've already been quoted a 30 minute wait, and brow beat and shamed by both of the house managers go there. I hope you have better luck than we did.  One more thing, I also work in the service industry and manage 3 high end salons in the area don't think I won't use this as a perfect example of how not to treat our guests in the next training session."
Hugh B.,"Mechanicville, NY",61,170,2,2.0,1/9/2017,There are so many better places to eat in the Wolf Road area all I would say is just pass on this one. As others have commented it's hit or miss. Most evenings it can be very crowded and they lack the staff and when you read the calorie count on the menu you realize just how unhealthy it really is.
Corazón V.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,2,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Terrible terrible service. Today we had a reservation at 12:30, sat down within 5 minutes, had Micheal C. as our server, gave our drink order and food order at the exact same time (there was 8 of us) drinks came out right away, bread took a little time maybe (5-10) server was nice but wasn't very involved with the table. One of the waters had a nice smear of butter on the out side from a finger from a waiter and something in the inside of the cup, so we pushed to the side/center of the table and was never addressed. Appetizers that 2 people ordered, which was 2 salads, and (1) taquitos plate with 4 small taquitos. That took maybe 15 minutes to come out. Then we didn't get out main dishes until about almost and hour after initially sitting down. While I understand courses are typically spaces out, even during the items shortly after they were deliver so that it arrived in an appropriate proportion to when the appetizers were done. So, after speaking to the server 3 different times it amazes me that he didn't notify the manager to touch our table to possibly resolve the issue. So finally, after talking to a one of the many managers I believe it was Johnathan, our food cane out quickly but only two dishes at first, maybe after a few minutes followed by alot of dishes and people helping to deliver the food, then to begin eating, both soups were lukewarm, my pasta had a top layer of dryness to it, the sandwich was extremely toasted, clear something's were sitting in a window, and at one point was told that the side to the burger was in its way and that they wanted to get the food out--fries never touched the table. Still, no manager stopped by, no asking if matters were resolved or what had happened. In the end I'm not quite sure what the issue is, I'm not sure if it stemmed from the lack of food runners or kitchen staff, or a terrible management system, but something wasn't right and it was very sad to see people have a bad experience and no one seems to want to recover the business. In the end the manager could have comped drinks, or provided an explanation and an apology."

I did go on a Wednesday close to 8:30pm so I didn't have to deal with any long waits. Our waitress Layla was incredible, I think the friendliest server I've ever had. My asian pear martini was perfect, and my fav fried zucchini was good, maybe just a tad undercooked but acceptable. My daughter had the spicy crispy chicken and it was on point."

If The Cheesecake Factory is as mediocre as most yelp reviews claim it is, why is it always packed? Not just packed, but has hours long waits at times?  If you're not sure, let me help you with some possible answers. Everyone's cousin dragged them there because said cousin loves: ""Portions big enough to choke an elephant!"", even though they know he has poor taste in food, and thinks the breadsticks at the Olive Garden are ""The bomb"". They're in Colonie Center, and are hungry, but they're too lazy to take the elevator up to the food court, and the giant horse in front of that Chinese place frightened their 3 year old. They have an English exam the next day and decide to read through the entire 27 pages of the menu as prep for the exam. They're in training to become the worlds fattest person, so they order two of the many entrees that are more than 2000 calories each and eat all of it. OK, bad jokes aside, why, despite a completely mediocre 3 star rating is the place always freaking mobbed? This may be hard for some to understand, so pay close attention. Cheesecake Factory is always packed because...  THE FOOD IS GOOD. Yep, it's that simple. And I don't care what the negative reviews claim, the food is made from scratch, and is better than most every other chain restaurant you can name. In fact, The Cheesecake Factory is the best casual dining chain in the country. Period, dot dot. End of argument. Is everything on the menu awesome? No, of course not, but that doesn't mean most dishes aren't good, and some are very good, and when you discover one of those amazing dishes, you'll be hooked for life. Ignore the naysayers who love to hate on the Cheesecake Factory. Go, and start with one of the popular dishes, which are popular for good reason, and then come back to Yelp, and set the record straight.  The Cheesecake Factory makes fresh, delicious food. Plus there's something on the menu for absolutely any palate. And don't fret over the portion sizes. Eat half, and take the leftovers home for lunch the next day and enjoy that delicious dish a second time."

We enjoyed what we ordered - bf got the chicken enchilada dish and I had the steak Diane gluten free preparation. We both really enjoyed what we ordered - very tasty preparations.  They have a pretty good number of items that can be made gluten free. No need for an appetizer as the portions are huge. Our server was wonderful and friendly (Her name was Brooke) - so attentive despite it being bustling. - no room for dessert. In fact, I have never been able to eat everything and have never had the cheesecake as a result. We had a nice booth and a great time together - even though the place is very loud, you can tune it out in a booth."
