Wendy N.,"West Sand Lake, NY",4,121,,4.0,12/15/2011,"Recently diagnosed with Celiac (thereby not being able to eat anything with wheat/gluten in it) I was a little nervous about going here and finding anything that I COULD eat on the menu.  I asked our server if they had a dedicated gluten free menu, which they did not.  To my surprise, the server was pretty knowledgeable about what options I could eat on the menu and what I needed to steer clear of.  He even went back to the kitchen to confirm what I was going to have didn't have any hidden soy sauce in it.  I settled on the Kobe Beef Burger with no bun and a side of mashed potatoes.  Everything was DELICIOUS!  For dessert, I splurged on the one thing on the menu I could have....the Godiva flourless chocolate cheesecake.  WOW.  It was VERY rich, so I could only eat half, but it was delicious.  Our server was fantastic, I wish I caught his name, but he was very personable and very helpful."
Alaina J.,"East Greenbush, NY",102,137,51,5.0,1/5/2012,"A couple of years ago, I would not have given this place above three stars, due to the slow, unimpressive service and the mediocre food that came in giant portions.  I actually refused to go here for quite awhile, and then one day my husband and I were at the mall and got hungry and figured, what the hell, we'd give it another shot.  I'm very glad we did.  For the past year I've had nothing but really outstanding service, and I haven't had a single dish I didn't like.  They have a catfish special quite often that is absolutely freaking delicious, especially considering how hard it is to find good catfish in upstate NY.  The small plates are fantastic, and it's easy to have a light but diverse meal without a whole lot of calories.  I really recommend this place, especially if you were once turned off by bad service or food."
Keith P.,"Hudson, NY",17,32,17,4.0,4/26/2014,"For my first visit to the restaurant it definitely surpassed my original thought of what the restaurants atmosphere was going to be like. Very causal and relaxed atmosphere. Very short wait time for seating. The offered both indoor and outdoor seating. Which is a great option for most places usually did to offer that option. The menu selection is very diverse with options of pasta to burgers. On my visit I had a turkey burger which came with the choice of fries or a small caesar side salad. My fiancé had the buffalo chicken burger. Now in the past at places I've ate, the burgers have been your average run of the mill frozen patty. But with this one it was obvious that it was a fresh pressed patty. Very plump and juicy, full of flavor, served a freshly toasted bun. On the side was a great garlic aioli. With the buffalo chicken sandwich, it was very visible that the chicken was fresh split a chicken breast that was coated and fried. Before we left we peeked at the desert menu, because honestly you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not want to at least look at the variety of the cheesecakes available. We both agreed on picking up a slice of tiramisu cheesecake. Of course we got it to go. But once we got home and had shared the slice, it was DELICIOUS!! So when ever you get a chance to either have a casual dinning experience or night out for dinner and a movie, definitely stop in and have a meal"
R M.,"Troy, NY",0,17,,3.0,12/7/2011,"This one is like most others. I like the chain because of the large menu where everyone can find something to eat to suit their tastes. I also like that the calorie count is listed to help those who want to, make informed choices.  The two problems I have over and over is (1) that when I am told that they will, without an extra charge, substitute something for something else, often I will get an extra charge on the bill, so I asvise to always check your bill for accuracy. (2) The kitchen often make mistakes. I have gotten the wrong salad and I have gotten the right salad with what looked to be veggie-waste products in it (like the ends of a carrot that you cut off and intent to throw away). The staff is nice when you bring it to their attention, but it would be nice to not get so many mistakes. But then that is where the bill problems came in. The staff apologies for the wrong/messed-up salad and says they will take it off the bill, but when the bill comes, the item is still on the bill. So, if the Cheesecake Factory can correct these problems, I will then give them a higher rating!"
Dorene B.,"Utica, NY",6,26,2,4.0,7/22/2011,"This place is awesome!  There are so many wonderful choices on the menu, it takes me forever to decide. Went at 5:30 PM on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for a seat. Usually the wait is at least an hour.  I can't wait to take a trip back to Albany!"
Susan G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,21,1,2.0,7/18/2013,"Service was great, dessert was great but the food was awful.   We had the four cheese spaghetti and it had a bad after taste, also had the tacos and they were much better but rather bland.  The cheesecake was excellent.    Over the last two years the quality of food has decreased.   Just go for coffee and dessert, otherwise it is a waste of money."
Ashley S.,"Panama City, FL",67,98,15,4.0,8/6/2011,Yummy!  I had a salad and sandwich and it was super yummy.  The restaurant was very busy but the service was quick.  I enjoyed my food and atmosphere.  The only thing I didn't like how close the tables were to each other near the bar.
Allie D.,"Albany, NY",30,15,2,3.0,7/1/2013,Food is always great but the service is SO SLOW. My husband & I were there today for lunch and it took almost 2 hours from the time we checked in to the time we left. It took almost 30mins just to get the bread. And the tables are WAY too close. I felt like we were eating lunch with two other couples. You can hear word for word what the tables beside you are saying.
ThinkAnd D.,"Albany, NY",45,148,44,3.0,10/20/2008,"In Shopping Mall Alternate Universe, Sumerian-Italian restaurant decor is as plausible as large olives stuffed with goat cheese finding their way into dirty martinis. And wasabi-encrusted ahi tuna means wasabi sauce with the texture of shaving cream is slathered on top, and vegetables julienned to microns float in one tablespoon of burre blanc.  Nonetheless, it was tasty, but not what was anticipated."
Sarah A.,"Milton, MA",159,1158,145,2.0,3/18/2009,Had a very bad experience here a while back while trying to order breakfast. I wanted some poached eggs and was told that they could not poach eggs. Wtf? I will come back to the kitchen and poach them for you. What kind of restaurant does not offer poached eggs? So wacked. I hope they have found some kitchen staff that can make eggs. I'm also just not a fan of this place in general. The portions are too huge and the food I find to be a bit plastic-y.
L S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,1,1.0,7/17/2013,Got super sick from my meal due to MSG. I eat the same thing in Vegas but man was I sick all night from The this location. It was the only thing I had eaten for 8 hrs so I know it was from the Tuscan chicken. How disappointing.
Sylvain P.,"Newmarket, Canada",29,132,16,1.0,11/25/2010,"I could never really figure why the decor in The Cheesecake Factory is so over-the-top but now I know why. It's to mask the taste of the food or, the fact that there isn't any taste. Yep, nine of us and we all had the same complaint. The food didn't taste like food. At least the service was good but it doesn't make up for the bad food."
Jess P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",79,380,,4.0,1/8/2008,"Normally the idea of eating at a chain restaurant in a shopping mall is enough to make me break out in hives. And judging by how swamped this place was when I passed by on a Sunday, doing so on a weekend would probably send me over the edge.  But...somehow my foodie boyfriend ended up with a gift certificate here so we decided to try it out last night after spending several hours trying to find me a new business suit.  It was around 5:30 p.m. on a Monday so we were seated right away. The decor is basically hideous - gawdy and completely over-the-top. It seemed like something you might find in Vegas. I'm still not sure what exactly the thematic scheme of the decor is supposed to be - Ancient Greece-does-Hollywood? Who knows?  We had the lowest of expectations and decided to start out with appropriately gawdy seeming cocktails. He had the Tropical Typhoon and I had a Red Raspberry ""Martini."" Although steep at $10.50 (are you serious?) it was pretty good - I was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of real raspberry juice and not just some artificial mixer.  He had a burger topped with steak, cheese and bacon that he claims was absolutely delicious and far too large.   I had the lemon-herb roast chicken and it was surprisingly good - an entire 1/2 of a roast chicken with real red bliss mashed potatoes, carrots and a light garlic-lemon sauce. It was huge for $14.50 - I had leftovers for lunch today. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Our waitress was spot-on - very helpful and very nice.  By the end of the meal, we felt sort of ashamed for having made fun of this place so much.  We decided that while it wasn't a place we'd likely come often (I like to avoid malls most of the time,) we couldn't honestly degrade this place too much.   I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't try the cheesecakes - I was too stuffed."
Jessica L.,"Troy, NY",110,247,67,3.0,2/14/2010,"When this location opened up, I was super excited cause I had heard so many wonderful things. I expected the cheesecake to be so good that I would want to fast for days so I could shove my face on it til I couldn't fit anything else in there. Granted this is an overstatement, but the point is, there was so much hype that I was really sad it didn't quite meet the expectations I had for it.  Don't get me wrong, it was great, but I've had better, and I've had worse.  I'm very grateful that the wait time rarely gets to the 3 hour waits it used to have, very grateful.  First let me talk about the eats I haven't quite loved. First - my first trip there, there was a 2 hour wait, which was fine but I was starving, so I decided to get a slice of cheesecake first for the wait. I got the Oreo cheesecake, which is supposed to have an Oreo crust, so I thought I'd really like it, cause I love Oreo's. The taste of this cheesecake....particularly the crust, I can only describe as what I imagine dirt to taste like. It didn't give me high hopes for the meal that would follow.  Another disappointment, once I ordered what I remember being some sort of shrimp scampi, but the shrimp was a bit too chewy and the flavor was just a bit off. Now the average meals - I ordered a burger that I think was called the tons'o'fun burger, which to me was a more gourmet Big Mac - good, but way too much for any one person. The buffalo chicken strips, and Thai lettuce wraps are also just mediocre appetizers, good, but I wouldn't die without them.  The things I love - the bread, its so good. The strawberry lemonade - keep em coming, cause I can easily drink 4, they are so refreshing, that you can't stop drinking them. Favorite Meal - Lemon Herb Chicken, it is so succulent, and sweet, and tangy! You can easily feed 2 people off it, and usually I split it with someone. There is also plenty of juice that you can dunk your potatoes or bread in. Lastly, the best dessert - Chocolate Truffle Cake, it can only be described as heaven in my mouth.  You can have a good or bad experience here, you just have to figure out what you like.  If you don't like crowded seating, you might want to stay away, cause it is definitely a very ""intimate"" ambiance. Alot of the tables are super close to each other, and it can be quite noisy. In many way it is reminiscent of some restaurants I have eaten in in NYC."
David W.,"Hooksett, NH",2,12,,4.0,12/24/2010,"Very good... Salads were fresh, clean and tasty. Pasta dish was very good. Third visit. Always enjoyed."
Crystal C.,"Troy, NY",31,212,47,3.0,6/16/2008,"The food is pretty tasty, for a chain. But a bit pricey, for a chain. Being lactose intolerant, I've never been able to indulge in the cheesecakes, but I have tried the blackout cake, which was over the top good. This place is ok, but there are better places to eat in the area. Don't believe the hype."
Tracy V.,"Ulster, NY",51,37,13,4.0,2/19/2008,"Okay, word to the wise... NEVER try to go to The Cheesecake Factory on Valentine's Day for dinner.  Oh MY GAWD!   We figured that by getting there right after work at 5pm that we would be early enough to beat the dating crowd.  Ehhhhhhhh! Wrong.  It was blatantly obvious that hundreds of other daters had the same plan. We arrived at 5:15 (after fighting through hellish rush hour traffic on Wolf Road) to find hundreds of people crammed into the restaurant like little sardines, many of them spilling out into the hallway.  Adorned with beeping, buzzing pagers in hand, many were pacing the floors of the mall, smoking cigarettes outside, or chattering away on cell phones. We decided that we might as well join the crowd, since at this point I was starving and already annoyed with traffic...I was not about to try our luck at another place.  So, we too, (after wading through all the people standing around, trying not to get in the way of all the waiters scurrying around with hot food and drinks) got our own special pager and asked the host how long the wait would be.  30-45 minutes.  Ok, we can deal with that. After roaming the mall for 45 minutes, we returned to the restaurant to find it even more crowded than it was previously, with customers looking more hungry, tired, and anxious, and the waiters looking a bit more frazzled and frenzied. We stood there for about another 15 minutes, trying not to be in the way, which is impossible, since the path the waiters travel between kitchen, bar, and dining tables is exactly the same space as all the waiting customers.  Our pager FINALLY went off to our delight and not a moment too soon... I was starving! They took our pager and herded us over to yet another waiting spot to wait for someone to seat us with about 4 other couples.  It was similar to being a finalist in American Idol, waiting to see who the winner is.  And the winner is.... us!  They call our name and show us to our table, which is crammed in between rows of other diners. Our waitress was very nice and very professional.  She came to our table promptly, took our drink and appetizer order quickly, and delivered our food while it was still hot.  All amazing, considering how nuts the place was.  So she forgot to bring us our basket of bread.  We just asked the waiter who brought us our entrees. We had the calamari as our appetizer which was very good.  J had the shrimp scampi/steak diane combo and I had the chicken something/steak diane combo.  We were both pretty pleased.  The sauce on the steak was a little weird, but not inedible.   By the end of our huge meal, we were so stuffed that I actually laughed when the waitress asked if we were ready for dessert.  Yeah, right.  But still, I felt I had to get a piece of cheesecake since this IS the Cheesecake Factory.  We ordered two pieces to go.  J got the peanut buttery and chocolate one, I got the pistachio cheesecake with flourless chocolate crust.  It took me two days to eat all of it, it was so rich. All in all, a good meal and a really oddly decorated restaurant ( I agree with Jess's description of the decor), with really good service considering the mob scene.  Next time, I will go back during a weekday for lunch, when it will be less crowded."
Susan R.,"Arlington, VT",25,380,301,4.0,4/6/2009,"I have to reiterate---as much I rebell against  food chains ...we have never had a bad meal here- not even close. We were foolish enough to go on Saturday night, with over an hour wait- and  starving! As I am on the DAMN South Beach Diet and the first two weeks are very restrictive, I knew that  I could count on a fresh piece of fish and a decent salad. That's what I got - actually, perfectly Grilled Mahi Mahi, with some jerk spice thrown in- my it was tasty and there were 2  generous sized fillets. Instead of fries, they kindly substituted a mound  of perfectly steamed  broccoli and string beans. I also had a side of tasty black beans - which cooled down too fast in the draft. Other's salad with beets, crisp, honeyed pecans,and goat cheese was fabulous - and a bargain at $4.95. A lovely presentation, and cheaper than a glass of beer! His Jamaican style shrimp was pretty good, though a tad sweet for me. Nice that it  even came with fried plantains. I marvel at how this place runs with great efficiency.  They are well-staffed and the staff is well trained. We make a point of talking with them each visit, and they are always incredibly friendly  - despite being totally slammed every weekend. And gee folks, how can you complain about the portions being too large? Isn't it NICE to have a doggie bag and a free lunch or dinner the next day? As long as Quality is not compormised for Quantity. I have no problem with that!!  I do wish that the drinks were less expensive and that there were some marvellous alternatives to cheesecake, for dessert, but hey, it is their namesake after all."
Craig C.,"Greenville, TX",88,15,1,5.0,2/8/2010,I love this Cheesecake Factory!!! Consistently great food and the best dessert!!!
Gail S. J.,"East Nassau, NY",0,23,,3.0,10/17/2012,"Fun place, average food, and I agree with others, too many choices!!!! Four of us went for a birthday lunch. We all had something different and enjoyed it. The mushroom soup was a little too much mushrooms for me but my husband finished it. Three of us got Tropical Ice Tea and NONE of us took more than one sip. It tasted like dish water!!! The birthday girls shared a piece of White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake which was delicious!!!! Service was great and we didn't feel rushed."
