Chris B.,"Red Hook, NY",7,822,459,5.0,3/25/2016,"I'm surprised by this business. Up until yesterday, I had never went into a cheesecake factory store due in part to hearing that prices were much higher than the average price of cheesecake elsewhere. When going in, I saw their display case for their ""take home"" line of products to order from.  I knew they were a little expensive, so I planned accordingly. From three longer shelves, I picked one that I felt good enough to order (with my Irritable Bowel Syndrome (which the richness of most cheesecake's affect me) and all).  I looked and the one that struck me was the ""Snickers Bar Cheesecake"" which was sitting on what appeared to be the same plate of cheesecake as the Hershey Chocolate Bar cheesecake. ""Oh boy,"" I thought. And I definitely was in for a treat on the rest of the order - but little did I know that their ""Take out menu"" featured an even larger selection of cheesecake and other cakes. It took a few minutes for the last person in line to finish their order and receive it. But I Made it after a few minutes. Things went smoothly, and the employee took my order.  She joked with me a little.  Although I could never read minds, I could tell that she could tell that this was my first time into one when I asked for that piece.  The last person had ordered several cheesecake pies and I seriously thought to ask if they even sold them ""by the piece"" (which I sort-of half knew before I asked anything)?   The rest of the order here went off without a hitch. The cheesecake was so de-licious that I can't even describe it without loosing that specific styling that only a cheesecake factory location would impart. Thank you.  I'm surprised. Yes, it cost me a little more than $8.50 to savor this cheesecake, but it was definitely worth it in the end.  But be careful with their selection of cheesecakes on their shelves, some aren't even cheesecakes themselves - such as the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake (which someone in my party actually tried on a second trip into the establishment, but that's not something I'm commenting on). I hated not giving them a tip on my bill, but I had some quarters on me.  For the wonderful time I had, I had to give them some money for the wonderful service and great product. Personally, seeing their prices, I don't think I'll ever eat here for other products that they sell here, but the cheesecake was so good, I'm coming back in a few months.  Keep up the great work and the great products!"
Lauren A.,"Pottersville, NY",0,12,,2.0,1/1/2017,"Waitress was very nice but over all very bad experience. Food had no flavor, waited for ever for straws and basics and everyone was going by so fast you could not even stop someone to ask for something. Management needs to be on the floor supervising and walking around asking if people are ok, if they need anything? It's always busy here so they should be able to handle that."
Tina B.,"Plattsburgh, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Alright food, but over priced. Extremely rude manager and horrible customer service if something goes wrong."
Chris F.,"Whitney Point, NY",1,39,5,3.0,7/16/2015,"While on a corporate training retreat my colleagues and I want to greet ourselves to something we rarely get to have where we are from. After looking at what Albany had to offer we decided to check this place out. I've personally never been to one before but it was a pleasant experience. I was given a per diem of $35 and since this was our only stop of the day I decided let's just be silly and use it all. Heck, I wasn't paying for it. I started off with the Buffalo poppers and they were greatly enjoyable. Basically chicken and cheese bits fried in what seemed to be some kind of tortilla shell with a side of buffalo dipping sauce. For my main course I chose the Fried Cajun Chicken. It came with a side of mashed potatoes, which were excellent, and then I substituted some fries in. I'm sorry to say I just didn't get the Cajun feel. They seemed like some slightly seasoned chicken tenders. The overall portions were hugs and all the meals we had were take home meals, because none of use could finish them. Now I may have commuted a sin, but I didn't order cheese cake. I know, crazy, right? But I had already maxed out what I was allowed and I'm not that found of cheesecake. Our waitress, who seemed to be new, was pretty slow. We waited quite a while to get or checks and for my colleagues to get their slices of cake. Now if a place is crazy busy, I don't blame the server, I understand how it can be. But it wasn't exceptionally busy and fairly late in to the night. Would I go again? Probably."
jaime m.,"Somerville, MA",41,11,,2.0,11/23/2016,"Dirty silverware and glasses.. ours and our neighboring table. Cobb salad drenched in dressing. Kale salad not cut small enough nor ""massaged"".  We also waited excessively long for the meal, but waiter was nice."
Debbie S.,"Flushing, NY",8,40,81,4.0,3/17/2016,"This place is always pretty consistent. Good spot to eat with my daughter during our Albany college hunt.  The place is nicely designed and music is always good and at the right column. Wait staff is courteous.  Food is good, especially the Asian chicken Salad."
Eric S.,"Schenectady, NY",13,13,4,4.0,7/11/2015,This is the chain that I love to hate.  The small plates are great. Drinks and always good and of course the cheesecake is awesome. The one thing I can't understand is when they serve you bread the butter is always fresh out of the freezer. Why can't the serve room temp butter? They put the effort to serve homemade bread but skimp out and serve pre packed almost frozen butter. Other than that I have no complaints
Susan M.,"Menands, NY",2,63,22,1.0,11/9/2015,They are over priced and their food is terrible.  Not to mention that we had to sit so close to other diners that we pretty much were eating at the same table.  My husband and I came here to try it over the weekend.  We asked for a table for two but were seated at a table with guests on either side of us no more than 2 inches from us and with no separation.  I felt as though we were dining with these people.  The worst part of the dining experience was the food.  My husband had chicken Parmesan and it was terrible.  I had a pork chop which was edible but not good and very small and the French fries weren't very good.  For $65 I expected much more.  We were very disappointed so we didn't order dessert.
Peter B.,"Mahopac, NY",11,2,,2.0,12/19/2015,"The appetizer was wonderful. We had the fried macaroni & cheese balls. The main entrees, chicken Marsala and rigatoni sausage & shrimp were something much less. Chicken had a 'off' taste & the rigatoni was not hot when served. The cheese cake was first class. So the moral of the story; have appetizers & cheese cake. The service was also not up to par. It was a busy Saturday night; but still was somewhat inattentive. We told our waiter that the chair a gentleman was sitting in across from us was broken... He did absolutely nothing. We watched as the legs spread more & more... Needless to say, we didn't feel it was our responsibility to tell the other patron. But I did advise the management when we left and tipped according since our waiter couldn't have possibly cared less. Overall, I'd probably come back for cheese cake but not much else."
Marvin K.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,15,,2.0,5/1/2016,"Service itself was good but the food itself was, well - debatable. The Jambalaya Pasta I chose had a really good taste, but most of the pasta itself was stuck together, creating one huge Pasta blob with the (pretty good) Jambalaya seasoning and chicken/shrimp as a topping.. What killed it was the pizza: My wife ordered the Date-Bluecheese-Bacon Pizza and it arrived without dates and without blue cheese. How can you screw up to that degree? Like not notice that two thirds of the ingredients are missing??? No idea... Since we were short on time, we did not return it but my wife ate half of it (it was not very good)."
Arty H.,"Clifton Park, NY",0,15,,5.0,2/18/2016,"If you (foolishly) decide not to ever have an appetizer ever again,  you have to have their avacado eggrolls before you make that decision.... the main dishes are really good too."
Emily O.,"Bayside, NY",193,4,,5.0,2/23/2016,"Had an amazing waiter the last time I went, he was super friendly and seemed like he really enjoyed his job and interacting with his customers. The food, as always, was delicious! Love this restaurant!"
Vic W.,"Charlotte, NC",12,67,88,5.0,9/29/2015,Justice and Chelsea get mad kudos! Just amazing customer service. I will write a formal letter to the Corporate office.
Allen L.,"Delmar, NY",6,11,,5.0,3/2/2016,"I have to rave about the Classic Burger.  Grilled to perfection and served with grilled onion, lettuce and tomato.  I have had this burger many times over the last few years.  I urge anyone really serious and knowledgeable about the ""perfect"" burger to give it a try!  I guarantee you will find this the benchmark of the American Hamburger!"
Kate K.,"Peekskill, NY",448,466,202,2.0,10/23/2012,"Why anyone would bother to stand the wait here is beyond me.  You are guarenteed a 40 min to hour and a half wait here and for what? Oh, over priced food that takes another 40 minutes to reach you, 10-15$ drinks with half a shot of liquor in them if you are lucky and a loud ass venue with mostly screaming kids and annoying familes talking hella loud about shit you dont need to hear. You literally have every option out there food wise and culture wise in Albany so it baffles me that this place is always poppin.  But then again its filled with your typical LL Bean white folk who are petrified to try any spice besides garlic.  Mostly freshman families who have yet to discover the array of cool ass stuff in and around albany, and just want some reliable chain BS. GAG.  I refuse to go here anymore and while the food is ok and has decent size portions, I am all about tryng new and small locally owned restaurants.  I beg all of you to steer clear of this trap.  Wolf road alone has so many other places to try that won't make you wait over an hour for some grub.  And if you need a date spot, try downtown  or even better Lark Street.  Drinks are nicer and you can get three for the price of one drink downtown.  I'm sold in that fact alone."
Kathy B.,"Saratoga County, NY",0,10,25,1.0,10/25/2014,"The food is usually pretty good. But that is ""if"" you get what you actually ordered.  We were told a 20 minute wait, the people ahead of us were told 15 and it was 30. Not the worst, but still. Once we were seated, we had no server. The people on our left and right had servers. It was as if our table was in a ""no servers land"" if you will. After speaking to a couple of different people,we got a server from another section. I ordered lettuce wrap taco appetizer and he said skinny tacos? I said I guess thinking this must be what they call them. Not at all what I got and was charged the additional 4.00 which was the price difference in what I ordered and what I got. I was disappointed, but they gave us a slice if cheesecake for our trouble.  No, I don't believe I'll go back."
Jerry C.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",8,147,267,4.0,1/20/2013,"Oh no, its a chain restaurant, omg its going to suck and be bad and ahhhh! No, actually this cheesecake factory has been consistently good to me. I've been here 2-3 times without problem.  Let me tell you why, listen up. it's not the same old same old that is Chili's TGI Fridays and Applebees. I mean those three places might as well be the same restaurant.  Yes, you will pay a bit more at the Cheesecake Factory but I've never been disappointed with a dish. Its always above average and tasty.  Last time i went i switched it up a bit... Instead of an appetizer and entree, my guest and i had 5 appetizers. It was fun almost like a buffet. We got the following:  Mozzarella Sticks. Crab wantons Avocado Egg-rolls Stuffed Mushrooms And Fried Zucchini. You may be thinking, but hey most of that is deep fried,, all deep fried food is good!! Yes yes, but that's why i go it. It was delicious, not too expensive and i had a gift card so i was happy as a clam. I will go back here in the future."
Anthony W.,"Watervliet, NY",0,5,,1.0,6/21/2015,Waited 1/2 hour past our Rez time. When we talked to floor manager he started off telling us all the things we did that were wrong - they don't really do large parties (we were 9) - see their website) and they don't take Rezs (see Yelp). Where do they train these guys in a car wash?! The service after we were finally seated was efficient and cheerful although it took 3/4s of an hour before food arrived. The meal was adequate. Tough to imagine we will ever come back.
Ajay R.,"Round Lake, NY",47,38,,1.0,5/22/2015,"Had the worst experience at this place last night (05/21). My wife and I walked in at around 9.45 pm.  We were seated immediately and saw server(s) walking past our table multiple times but no one had the courtesy to even say "" I will be right with you"". Finally, we had to stop a server who was walking past our table for the nth time and asked him if anyone is actually going to attend to the table?? We got a big rude stare from this guy and he walked off. Another server stopped by and we asked him the same "" Is anyone going to attend to this table and are we going to be offered at least a glass of water""? He gave a fake and a very sarcastic apology and finished with "" Oh you need water??"" We had enough and we decided to walk out.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"
Arlene W.,"Houston, TX",11,52,27,5.0,7/25/2014,"This is our usual date night hot spot. Yes, it's a chain and can have long waits (because it's good), but it's consistently delicious with a big menu so you can keep trying new things. We have gone countless times since moving into the Capital Region and there's only been about two times where the food wasn't as good as usual, which was quickly corrected and usually removed from the bill.  In general, this is a spot where you're sure to get a yummy meal. Plus who doesn't like a Georgia Peach and some cheesecake??"
