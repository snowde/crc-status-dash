Soleil S.,"Mississauga, Canada",515,706,2462,3.0,10/7/2012,"I was dragged here for a business dinner and I was dreading every moment. I was already warned by others that this is the epitome of American chain foods. Huge portions, unhealthy, haphazard service, and obnoxious flavourings.  I guess you can say 'large and in charge'. When I arrived, I was surprised. It wasn't as bad as people make it out to be and the service was actually good. It's already been said but the menu is a novel. I've never seen anything like it. It's all over the map as well. Asian this, southern that, deep fried this, comfort food that, and a decent throw in of healthy food.    Seeing we are at the Cheesecake Factory, I made calorie room for that. I shared the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer with the table and had the seared tuna entree. The service was pretty good. The waitress was friendly and the dinner pace was quick. We never waited for anything. Drinks were constantly refreshed and our table of 8 was looked after for everything. The food quality and taste didn't rock my world but it didn't leave me gagging either. The chicken lettuce wrap had fresh vegetables and nothing wilting. The chicken was slightly dried out and yet a bit oily at the same time.  The seared tuna entree was 'healthy' portioned. The tuna quality was ok. It wasn't great sashimi grade and buttery soft. It had a bit of tough chew to it.  The sear did impart a nice smokiness to it.   As for the cheesecakes, dear lawd, thank goodness we shared because they're incredibly indulgent. Rich, creamy, and I'm sure high in calories. Probably the best part of the meal. We tried the Godiva, blueberry, apple strudel, tiramisu, and the Oreo. The tiramisu was my favourite. Great coffee flavour and it wasn't brick dense. The Godiva one was really good too though you need to be a chocolate lover. The blueberry actually tasted of blueberries instead of fake sugary blueberry jam. I wasn't a fan of the apple but then again, apple pies are not my thing. The Oreo was like a candy bar. True to the cookie taste but it was sugar overload. I don't think I'd come here on my own again but if I'm dragged here, I wouldn't fear for my taste buds. I'd just fear for my waistline."
Voguiee W.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,49,4,3.0,9/16/2015,"I think that the utensils are very dirty, it doesn't look clean. The food was ok."
X.O. V.,"Albany, NY",0,3,,2.0,7/2/2016,"Most always a fun meal, albeit a hair pricey and screw your diet, but you knew that. Unfortunately, our last visit wasn't fun at all. Our waiter was bouncy and personable, but after first contact we sat there for 20 minutes without water, drinks, bread, anything, while he was flitting about the room being bouncy and personable. We finally got up, told the hostess we were leaving and why, and walked out. Inexcusable."
Yaika D.,"Albany, NY",46,6,4,3.0,10/12/2015,This is subpar food with just a really high price tag. There service is great staff was really nice and friendly but food kind of sucks. Cheesecake feel like those you get from a box at the supermarket and I hope that's not the case because it would truly be sad. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for a.reason and I hope they are made from Scratch
Henry L.,"Nesconset, NY",5,10,,1.0,6/28/2015,"Waited for 40 mins when I was told only 10 mins wait, ends up it is due to a bad beeper. This Cheesecake Factory in particular always can find its way to surprise me."
Sara V.,"Seattle, WA",349,159,1201,3.0,4/28/2012,"Dinner food is all right, try it once for the experience then just stop by here if you ever want a cheese cake. All cheesecake factory restaurants seem to have the same decor, but I'm usually impressed by these things anyways so I ogled at the little statues and furniture everywhere. When I went here with five other friends, we were seated in a circular booth with a big table with mirrors behind us. It was really cool. The ambiance here is nice, but it's very very loud. You will always hear the drone of other patrons and the clacking of dishes non-stop. You will always have to wait to come here even if you make a reservation. I wasn't too happy with my server. Every time he came to the table, he said his name and repeated his question to everyone. ""Hello, my name is ___. What would you like to drink? Hello, my name is __. What would you like to drink?"" I don't know if he had a short term memory loss issue, but it freaked me out. Halfway through my meal, we got another waiter. Either the other guy was fired on the spot or something happened to him. I didn't know who to tip at this point, so as we were leaving, we split the tip in half and put it in two different piles. Coincidentally, both waiters had the same name. I remembered because the first guy said his name over ten times. The food re-heats up okay. I wouldn't do it more than once or eat it more than 2 days after you go."
Gabby D.,"New York, NY",26,64,274,5.0,6/12/2014,So firstly I wanna say Marissa is awesome. I've been here twice and after my first experience I had to return. The staff was pleasant and my waitress Marisa was very delightful. Everything I ordered meet my expectations and exceeded. Great food great service what more can you really ask for in a restaurant. It's a bit pricey but pricey gives you these great qualities I guess.
M. J.,"Troy, NY",8,91,,4.0,12/14/2015,went Christmas shopping with the mrs..... GROAN     - at 1 pm was as hangry as hangry can get....   she suggested cheesecake factory - I wanted a beer..  I got that and more- good solid spot on food.... no hassles here- service (Emily was our server/waitress) was fantastic- yes the joint was busy but it was lunchtime the week before Christmas so yeah theres that.. I did like the caloric listings yes some were uberhigh but there is some food on the large menu that will satisify and not break the daily calorie count........   finally... if you have a lil patience it is all good at colonie center cheesecake factory....
John W.,"China Grove, NC",2,18,6,5.0,12/2/2015,"I had never been to this place before and I had always heard about it from people all over. I decided it would be a great place to take my wife for her birthday. It was absolutely wonderful! The waiter was insanely nice and patient with the time it took us to order and he refilled our drinks at the perfect times! Outside this place looks fancy, but inside is where it really shines! The atmosphere is astonishing and absolutely beautiful! You would think a place that is called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" wouldn't be so luxurious and nice, but it is! After being surprised by all of that, the food was even good! We both got a chicken dish and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Finally, the one thing that they are famous for is desert, and we could not have been more satisfied! Everything was fantastic and even the price wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be for a nice meal like that! Definitely recommending this place to everyone!!!"
Lee T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,12,13,2.0,7/3/2015,"With a reservation for 6:00, we finally got seated at 6:45. After promising to take an appetizer order and have it ready when we were seated - we waited 20 min for them. Ordered dinner and waited 40 min for food - which was average at best. Serious disappointment all the way around. Wait staff was very pleasant and perhaps the kitchen let them down. Cheesecake for desert was the best part of the experience."
Blake B.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,179,77,4.0,12/30/2013,"I was pleasantly surprised with my first try at The Cheesecake Factory. It turned out to be a perfect Sunday night dinner with friends. Even though service is on the slow side, the very cordial server and the delicious mouth watering menu made it worth while. As you can probably tell from the name, they specialize in ""cheesecake"", however with the wonderful selections on their menu, the Salad, Pasta's & Farfalle are just too  hard to resist!  The Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic I ordered was terrific, blanketed with a rich and creamy Parmesan cream sauce. I also tried the Chinese Chicken Salad; what an amazing way to start a meal! Sliced grilled chicken breast, rice noodles, mandarin orange and other delightful goodies consist this refreshing starter! Our table have become a smorgasbord of generous servings of aromatic and mouth watering pasta dishes! With marinara or white sauce, they all looked amazing and tasted fantastic! I have to say, The Cheesecake Factory impressed me, Often I just zoomed and scrolled past it when looking for dinner place suggestions, with the fantastic service and generous delicious food serving that we got, I highly recommend giving The Cheesecake Factory a try."
Dalton N.,"San Francisco, CA",238,291,429,5.0,2/16/2014,"Overall, this Cheesecake Factory is great. It is at the Colonie Shopping Mall center and closed late, which was why I ate there. I was promptly seated as I walked in the door. Our server was very helpful, positive, and smiling. Our food came our very quick, which was awesome. I ordered a side salad, pasta di vinci, oreo cheese cake, and strawberry lemonade. My girl friend ordered the miso salmon, sangria, and the white chocolate cheese cake. All of our hot food came out hot and delicious. The balsamic dressing was just right. Everything seemed to be made well. The drinks were on point. Also, our server was funny, so that was a bonus."
Lauren G.,"Abington, MA",82,26,3,2.0,3/14/2016,"very slow service.... 15 min for someone to come and take our drink order, another 15 min for the drinks to come... and 40 min later still no food.... oy"
Arun M.,"Coralville, IA",36,340,11,1.0,7/18/2013,"Now I know there are people who will consider it a ""treat"" to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and it's management style has been widely reported in magazines like The New Yorker, and people want health care system to be like The Cheesecake Factory! But sit back and think about it for a second, REALLY!! This place is horrible.  I don't like this place that much. First of all the atmosphere is like of a casino. The waitresses have just behaved like it is a privilege that we will get a place to eat. Tables are most often cleaned after I have already seated and requested to be cleaned and cutlery has never been clean! They have good selection of food with huge portion sizes! So if you are looking for food that will be good for two people, this is your place. Now I have warmed up their food the next day and finished it, but it is not the same. Some how after overnight freezing all the fat in their food changes taste! Of course, there are not many vegetarian options on their menu for people like me.  After eating there for last two times, I have decided that I will never eat at the Cheesecake Factory if I am the one who is responsible to pick a place."
Andrea M.,"Schenectady, NY",7,3,,1.0,8/4/2015,"What a disappointment. Came here for lunch with my mother who was in a wheelchair. Was seated promptly. However, our waitperson would rather have talked to coworkers dining there then wait on us. Waited 10 minutes and then left. Maybe a one time occurrence?"
Scott S.,"Morrisville, NC",0,163,,3.0,3/20/2016,"The portions are smaller than in the past. I ordered chicken picano with angel hair pasta. It was regular pasta and a small portion. A part of the chicken was rubbery, I wonder if it was cooked correctly. A side portion of broccoli was expensive."
Tammy P.,"Niskayuna, NY",16,76,135,3.0,3/9/2014,Not too fond of the hostess. Not friendly. I understand it can be crazy annoying with hungry grumpy people who's hounding you for a table but if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen. They need to replace more friendlier faces vs frown ones and teach them not to take their frustration on the next customer when they are clearly mad at the one right before.  Besides that I love their miso salmon!
Sam W.,"Loudonville, NY",13,42,1,1.0,5/4/2015,"The design is great the food is wayyyyy too heavy. I came here twice after I finish the food I get the worst heartburn ever! This is way they are ranked the most unhealthy food chain in the USA. It's very pretty the service is great, but the food is mostly just cream and heavily salt it, pass for me I don't want to burn a hole in my stomach."
Colleen D.,"Troy, NY",154,483,129,2.0,6/17/2013,"Big.  Everything is just BIG.  It takes skill (and stones) to fit 600 calories into a salad and then put it on a menu entitled skinnylicious (which has about 50 different items on it).  The menu is huge; 17 pages (but to be fair every other page is menu and the other pages are fluff).   The waitress was great in accommodating my need for GF food and had the cooks modify the seared ahi salad to meet my needs.  The salad was ok; nothing to write home about.   The white uniforms kinda freak me out like I'm at some strange spa (I don't want to think spa when I'm hungry, I want to think food).  The ""uber"" high ceilings make it extra loud even when it is only half full.  The faces at the tops of the pillars completely annoy me."
Kathy C.,"Voorheesville, NY",19,7,3,3.0,5/21/2013,"About two months ago we went here and I fell in love with one of their pasta dishes.  I've never been a big fan of the place because it's noisy and the food is just ok, nothing in the past that would have me waiting an hour for it. We decided to do dinner out the night before Mothers Day, instead of on the actual day.  Got there about 8, still had an hour wait (I would say not their fault, but...), then waited another 45 minutes for our meal, with one stop by the manager made to tell us ours was about to come out.  We didn't have appetizers, just the main meal. Our waiter was a nice guy, doing the best that he could really.   Kept our drinks filled, brought us the bread basket quickly (thank goodness!).  When our meals finally came, my pasta was had just enough sauce to say there was sauce on it, certainly not enough to give you all the flavor of the dish.  My daughters chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce had about a quarter size spot of sauce on it, and what they brought her for more was just watery hot sauce.  My sons club sandwich was burned on one side, but not so bad that it was inedible, but definitely burned.  My husband and other son had minor issues with their meals as well.  So for over $100 bill, we had a 2 hr wait - again, if the kitchen wasn't clearly behind the wait would have been less, so while I won't hold it completely against the place, it wasn't just a busy time we hit either, and poorly made food. So sadly, I'm back to the attitude that we may go here once every year or so, when it's just more convenient than somewhere else, but I won't be knocking down the doors to get it."
