Kimberly F.,"Latham, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/22/2016,"First of all I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake factory. It's somewhere I do not go very often, but when I do I splurge.  I find the cheesecake factory is a busy place, and on a weekend night even more, but they do a good job at turning tables and provide excellent service. Sadly last Friday night that was not the case. It's was my birthday and the cheesecake factory is where my husband and I had our first date, so it's suppose to be a special place for us. There was a wait, which was to be expected and fine. When we were seated though about 8pm the server took our drink order but then took forever with the food order. You think he would have asked us if we were ready to order when we got our drinks. On top of that sadly a table of 11 people, (we were a table of 7), with the same waiter, got their food and dessert in the time it took us get the food. Then another table got food and drinks at same time before we got our food and were leaving before we did. We also ordered salads and sandwich's and one basic pasta dish, so nothing special on the menu. When we were done with dinner the waiter came to ask if we wanted boxes but then took forever to come back like 25 minutes at least and did not ask what we wanted to dessert when he came over. I do not remember him ever asking how our food was. When he finally came to take the cheesecake order, we were annoyed, but I really wanted cake for the birthday, so waited. That took another 20 minutes. By this time we got cheesecake the 2nd batch the 11 people sitting next to us were leaving.  It honestly felt like, he was serving that table  of 11 with much more service. This night out put such a bad taste in my mouth to write a first review, we will buy cheesecake again, but it's going to be a  long time before we go to dinner there again, if ever."
Norma L.,"Schenectady, NY",33,12,,3.0,3/8/2015,"After waiting 40 min for a table for 3 on a Saturday at 2:30 in the afternoon, we were finally seated. The food was fairly tasty, a burger, a spicy chicken sandwich and a pasta dish. The wait for the food was incredible, even when we put in, our dessert order took sibling to get to us that we were on the verge of skipping it and leaving, except for the fact that we had already paid for it."
Chicoman67 ..,"Albany, NY",17,6,,2.0,5/25/2015,Cheesecake Factory is for people who don't know what good food is. Most of their food I have tried at this restaurant is lacking in taste. Most entrees are loaded with so much salt it ruins the taste as its all you taste. Their prices for alcohol and mixed drinks are so ridiculous they should supply a complimentary jar of vasoline with them because they are f**king the consumer when it comes to drinks. $8 for a domestic beer and $10 and up for a mixed drink is too expensive when the cup is 80% ice. I honestly don't know how people can think its good food....its below average but their portions are plentiful...that about all I can say that is positive. Their prices are slightly higher than normal for a chain restaurant. Expect to pay between $65-$90 for two people with a drink each.
Daniel B.,"Albany, NY",1465,792,1958,2.0,11/23/2008,"Here is my list of demands for The Cheesecake Factory: 1) Halve your portion sizes 2) Cut your prices by a third 3) Increase the quality of your food 4) Trim down the menu to maintain food quality Let me be specific when I talk about food quality: - The lettuce leaf cups for the Thai Chicken wraps were ""a little muddy"" as described by my wife, who cleaned a few of the worst offenders herself at the table - The garnish of cilantro leaves on the plate was so wilted, it was as limp as overcooked pasta - The wrappers of the avocado egg rolls tasted a bit gummy, almost like they had been sitting around just a little too long before being fried off That said, the small salad of bitter greens, blue cheese and pecans was perfectly fine... if not exactly small.  And it was the best part of the entire meal.  Mostly because it was the only thing that wasn't overly sweet. The Mai Tai I ordered was huge, but disappointing.  Trader Vic would roll over in his grave.  Luckily we had a good server, and she delivered a few additional wedges of lime, which were enough to make the $9 cocktail drinkable.  This is a great place if you like dumbed down versions of classic dishes or are looking for the greatest amount of calories to the dollar.  I will happily gorge on great food when the food is worth it (like the time when Raf and I devoured the lobe of foie gras poached in goose fat).   But even splitting a small salad and dining on one appetizer a piece, my wife and I waddled out of the ""restaurant"" unable to even consider dessert.  I felt gross.  And we were probably the only people to ever leave The Factory without a doggie bag."
R. K.,"Valhalla, NY",12,423,1,2.0,10/19/2013,"What's amazing about this restaurant chain - whichever one you visit - is the long lines / waiting time. The food - at best - is expensively average.  We found our visit here disappointing. One plus was the mall this particular restaurant was attached to. With the standard 40 min wait we ventured inside and returned just in time to be seated. For starters we shared the ""Chicken Samosas"" (4). Tasty and flavorful these were the highlight of the evening. Our main meals included the Santa Fe Salad / Fish Tacos / Chicken Sandwich. The Tacos were bland and boring. The salad was heavy on lettuce and light on everything else - including dressing The sandwich - nothing special.The cheesecake desserts were enjoyed but man does not live by dessert alone. Service was friendly and professional. We waited a bit for our food which was understandable as the place was packed. Ambiance? Like everything else with the place.  You've seen / eaten at one - you've seen / eaten at them all..."
Pete P.,"Albany, NY",0,11,,2.0,3/8/2015,"Not sure why so many people like this place.  For what you get its overpriced junk.  The cheescake may be good, but the food isnt."
Steve J.,"Troy, NY",0,16,,3.0,4/17/2013,"Ordinarily, I avoid Wolf Road like the plague but my friend had a gift card for CF so I decided to check it out. It was very busy, even for a Tuesday night. They're not breaking any new ground with the food but the portions were pretty big. It was a little disconcerting to see the calorie counts but I had a fair amount of food left over. The service was very good Having said all that, I'm not in a rush to go back. It was very loud and you're really packed in. It's not a place you want to linger and relax. As I said, the food is good but nothing worth seeking out. I didn't think the cheesecake was good at all"
Alyssa J P.,"Naperville, IL",259,857,59,1.0,4/23/2010,"There are so many awesome places to eat in Albany that I have no comprehension why anybody would want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. For starters, they're a giant, faceless, soulless chain that doesn't even have any roots in Albany. For second, it's huge, you always have to wait, the service isn't that great. And for third, there's NOTHING on the ginormous advertisement-riddled menu that's vegan. Except maybe a lettuce wrap without chicken (which sounds disgusting, thanks) and the chips and salsa. Seriously, just don't go here. I can think of so many better places in Albany/Troy to eat off the top of my head. Bombers, El Loco, Blue Spice, My Linh, BFS, Pump Station, Brown's Brewing...  And to make matters worse, their drinks are ridiculously expensive. For the price of 2 mojitos I can buy a whole bottle of rum."
Amanda S.,"Albany, NY",21,155,7,3.0,2/28/2013,"I have really mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. The food is really overpriced and only decent tasting. And HORRIBLE for you. I'm no health buff, but it makes me sad to look at the calorie counts. There are definitely large portions, but even divided into two meals the calories....yikes. The cakes are very good; I haven't had a bad one. The servers have always been decent and knowledgeable about the products. But at the end of the day, it is a chain restaurant who serves okay food."
Jae L.,"Jericho, VT",177,179,1700,4.0,1/13/2011,"I never met a Cheesecake Factory I didn't like. Looking for a place to brunch as we drove home to Vermont from Rochester, I Yelped and was please to find CF was right off the highway. Feeling an intense need for protein, I ordered the steak and eggs.  The meat was tender and tasty, and the preslicing made sure it was cooked just right. Our son ordered the Bourbon Street omelet (excellent andouille sausage), and our very-disciplined daughter got the healthy Energy Breakfast (scrabled egg whites and chicken). The chicken (which I normallt hate) was surprisingly good, moist and well seasoned, and came with some vegetables. (Interestingly, the menu listed the calorie info for each dish.  I wonder how much it it affects peoples' choices when ordering.  I can state with utter confidence that it affected mine not at all!) We were a little disappointed by hash browns-- tasteless and a little burnt. But what knocked my socks off was the French Toast Napoleon, which we ordered for dessert and split 4 ways. The three slices, drowning elegently in strawberries, pecans and chantilly cream, would not have been enough for me had I ordered it alone.  No amount would have been enough, not matter what the menu said of its calorie count.  (I pointedly refused to look at it at the time.  But it is 2460 calories.)  This is going on my ""what I want to eat at my last meal"" list.  In fact, I'm just about ready to get out of bed right now and drive the 3 and a half hours to the nearest Cheesecake Factory... Oh, Cheesecake Factory, how I miss you, your Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and your French toast!  When are you moving to Vermont?"
Richard C.,"Utica, NY",23,8,1,3.0,12/18/2014,"I know that the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, and often food at these franchises tastes all the same, but I was pleasantly pleased with my dinner at this location.  I really enjoyed the chicken entree although I can't recall the name of it.  A tender breast, thin, moist, and breaded with a crunchy Panko-like coating, served with al dente pasta with the right amount of marinara, just to flavor and not to drown.  Some negatives: loud acoustics, and merely okay service.  If not for that...4 stars."
Matt R.,"Albany, NY",31,49,160,3.0,12/9/2012,"I would say four star but it loses one for being a chain. That being said, as chains go the food is above average than the cheap eats at other chains. But you pay for that. The cheesecake selection and taste makes the trip worth it !!! Great date stop not so much for family in my opinion."
Mer C.,"Toronto, Canada",1,56,18,4.0,3/13/2013,"1st time here to see what the big deal is about this chain. Our waitress was polite and attentive. The Kobe burger was surprisingly good. The cheesecakes were not as good as I had expected. Big portions, so had to finish the rest of our cakes at home. It was actually better at home. Maybe too full from the mains.  Worth a try."
Heather L.,"Saratoga County, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/20/2016,"We try to avoid this place due to the wait to get a table and the price of the food.  The food itself is generally quite good (though the calorie count is insane) and the cheesecake is delicious.  We thought we'd try it out on Father's Day and were surprised that it wasn't too busy.  We put in our name and were told that it would be about 5 mins with only a couple of people waiting for tables.  Soon ours was the only name left.  Then an influx of people came in, and we thought no big deal when we didn't get seated as they were seating all parties of 2.  Then they started seating parties of 4 and a couple of large parties of 7 or more.  My husband approached and asked when we would we would be seated and were told she knew and a table was being cleared and we would be seated any minute.  Then several more parties of 4 were seated and then several parties of 3.  My husband asked a 2nd time when we would be seated and stated that guests that had come in after us had already been seated and again were told that she knew and our table was still being readied.  After 2 more parties of 3 were seated before us my husband told them to stuff it and we ate somewhere else.  We were there waiting for about 25 mins in total for a table.  My suggestion to Cheesecake Factory is to not use little pieces of paper that are shuffled around by your hostessing staff to seat people or your going to lose more business....."
Tracy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,213,292,1.0,7/23/2012,"This was my first visit to the Cheese Cake Factory it's true what they say "" you never get a second chance to make a first impression"". With that being said the drinks were ok nothing to brag about the Long Island Iced Tea could have been much stronger. The J.W.'s Lemonade could also have been much stronger it basically tasted like a juice instead of a cocktail.  The appetizers were good the choices were Crab Wontons and Fried Macaroni and cheese.  The only thing I would change is the sauce that comes with the wontons it seems out of place and doesn't compliment the dish.  Entrees were a complete disaster presentation was a zero and taste was non existent. The chicken and shrimp jambalaya with linguini came highly recommended it was a total let down. It looked like a bunch of pasta and peppers tossed together and then up chucked into a plate. The second entree was the pepper shrimp and chicken with plantains, white rice and black beans with a few pieces of pineapple for decoration. This dish was sad the chef didn't take the time to devein the shrimp. Long story short it was discarded before we left the restaurant. The cheesecake factory has a massive menu, which leaves a big chance that executing many of these dishes will fail. I have no plans on visiting this chain again. The place was clean service was decent but the main courses flunked the test. I didn't try any cheesecake I just couldn't accept 1550 calories in a single slice of red velvet cheese cake."
Regular G.,"Troy, NY",57,91,1,4.0,6/8/2014,"Huge menu, each choice has been good. Always quality for a large chain restaurant. Staff is nice as well."
Stella M.,"Waterford, NY",0,3,,5.0,11/15/2015,Love the bacon cheeseburger it is my favorite. Our server was very friendly her name was Dannie
Linda G.,"East Hanover, NJ",128,13,3,2.0,7/31/2015,This was the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The food was not good and seriously underserved. Our portion sizes were one third of that of a regular Cheesecake Factory and I felt scammed paying so much for so little food. Avoid this Cheesecake Factory and go elsewhere in Albany.
Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928,4.0,8/15/2007,"When this Cheesecake Factory opened in August 2006, the place was so MOBBED you could barely move anywhere, even to the cheesecake display case for to go orders. It was like going to the mall on Black Friday. The waits for a table were so insane, more than 2 hours on a good night. I decided to wait until the novelty started to wear off before visiting this location.  If you don't want to wait to be seated, I suggest going here Monday through Friday for lunch and during off-peak hours to avoid the mall crowds. I'm usually seated immediately on typical weeknights after 8:00 PM. The dining areas have high ceilings with huge columns and dim lighting, a good place to have a relaxing meal with friends. I enjoy the great food and cheesecakes here. The service here is usually decent. A complementary basket of breads brought out with the drink order. The menus are thick with lots of choices to suit everyone's palette including comfort food items taken to the next level, appetizers, salads, steaks, chicken, seafood, southwest favorites, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, egg dishes, Sunday brunch items, a long list of cheesecakes, and other delectable desserts. My favorite menu items are the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Grilled Eggplant Sandwich, Fish Tacos, and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The food is tasty and the portions are generous.  The Key Lime Cheesecake is soooo good!!! The Factory Mud Pie is very sweet and rich and it's HUUUUUUU-JAHHH!! (I borrowed that tagline from a ""well known"" car dealer). My friends are more than happy to oblige and indulge on this monsterous dessert."
Mike L.,"Latham, NY",52,450,419,4.0,11/28/2010,Great place for a chain. Only drawback is the wait time. So many people go here that its usually at least an hour long. Soup is always good. Love the avocado eggrolls. They are a must have. The only entree I have tried and not liked is the Bang Band chicken and shrimp. Its is bombed with toasted coconut and just ruins the taste. Lots of people love it tho. The quality is far superior to other chains. The cheesecake itself isn't the best i've had. Its very filling and pricey.
