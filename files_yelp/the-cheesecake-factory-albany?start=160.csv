Mister F.,"Troy, NY",13,74,3,4.0,7/8/2014,"I have not been to many Cheesecake Factory locations so I can't compare this one to many others, but I have had great service and food the three or four times I've been to eat at the Colonie Center Cheesecake Factory.  The bread is warm and the servers are great about refilling water and soft drinks.   I had a ""skinnylicious"" salad this past Sunday that was just ok - it didn't have much of the advertised edamame and was overdressed (error on my part, I should always order dressing on the side), but the ""regular"" menu items my parents had were AWESOME.  Orange chicken was decadent and perfectly crisp, and the shrimp/chicken/sausage gumbo was superb.  In the past I have had chicken enchiladas or some variation thereof that were excellent (corn cakes were a highlight), and a vegetable/goat cheese pizza and salad at lunchtime with a friend visiting from Japan (she is a restaurant owner and was impressed).   I've had some of the cheesecakes - they're ok!  I feel I am unfit to judge cheesecakes because I don't particularly like or seek out cheesecake.   Pricing is very fair given the portions you get.  Portions are huge and given the calorie counts listed on the menu, I will go out on a limb and surmise that the recipes must call for a lot of butter, cream, salt, and sugar."
Jeremy K.,"Glastonbury, CT",195,799,,2.0,9/2/2012,"yea, 2.5 stars right down the middle between good and bad in the garden of restaurants, round down for the people. we were out, you know, just 120 miles from home just tooling about in the family truckster and decided to revisit colonie center, been a while my slightly less wt than usual friend. j/k we met some fam up here, midway point and thats the point, dont come all the way out here for this.  i think its been a few years since our last contract with the factory, whats new? hummm, well not much that i cared about other than them putting the calories on the menu. eww  service was really good, for what its worth, nice to see that they wanted their tips and not just assuming there entitlement. believe it or not, we got the same thing as the last time, call us old fashioned, and just like the last time i yelped a cf, the food gets old tasting quick. i dont know, not that much to say other than there is 700 places up and down wolf road that gotta be worth taking a stab over here. i know you know, but 1800 calories for a piece of cheesecake?"
Stephanie R.,"Saugerties, NY",0,18,1,3.0,7/18/2015,"Food was good, but I'm sorry $11 for a glass of sangria packed with ice. No thank you."
Elizabeth E.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,3,,4.0,8/10/2014,I love going to the Cheesecake Factory. I'm always greeted by friendly hostesses and the servers are very accommodating. The only reason why I don't give the restaurant 5 stars is because I feel so limited with my choices because of the amount of calories in most of their dishes. It's great that they now have a Skinny menu but it's only one page out of the entire book they have of a menu. I'd like to be able to try more options on their menu.
Lauren M.,"Whitesboro, NY",0,6,,1.0,11/13/2013,"Horrible service food came wrong took more than 10 minutes just to find the waitress to tell her it was wrong took another 30 to redo, husbands food got cold sitting for the whole time manager offered to redo his also, 30 mins later waitress came with my food and said it would be another 10 for his!!! Over an hours sitting there not eating. No apologies no here's bread while u wait for an hour nothing! I will Never set foot In this location again."
Juli W.,"Texas City, TX",72,57,9,3.0,11/5/2012,Well besides the cheesecake being awesome ...my cousin was right. The food is mediocre and the place is way elaborate. I enjoyed my tomato basil pasta but for the price really wished I could have had a salad or some bread to go with it. My cheesecake was the 30th anniversary one and it my dear was delicious. Moist and rich in flavors I will go back for desert but not for meals.
Adam P.,"Bryan, TX",10,26,1,3.0,9/16/2014,Hostess and waitress were great. Food was pretty good. The calories of the food were absurd. A single slice of cheese cake after a meal makes for a lot if food. The Oreo extreme cheese cake was very rich but good.
Sandy C.,"Queens, NY",236,550,437,3.0,10/22/2009,"Best Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to! For a while, I blacklisted them because the wait was just ridiculous and the food was overpriced for what it's worth.  But that's in LI.  This one in Albany rarely has a wait, and if there is, it's only about 15 mins (even for large parties).   I like the Chicken Marsala and I almost never make it to dessert.  The portions are just way to big, so I always take my cheesecake slice to go. My dad thinks this is a fancy restaurant cuz of the size and Italian deco. The only thing hard to find is parking around here.  It's in a large strip mall."
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,3.0,2/5/2014,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. This location in the mall has good service (we had a cute waitress, who was very nice and attentive) and the same standards as with all in this chain. No matter what you order, it's good and comes the way you asked for it. Clean spot, good service and good food."
Katie B.,"Albany, NY",137,10,2,4.0,8/21/2014,Service was prompt and engaging. I ordered the Steak Medallions on the Skinnylicious menu because I wasn't super hungry- perfect size and SO delicious.
Jonas C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",121,321,9,3.0,12/28/2011,"Well, they're obviously doing something right that they can still be packed after a predicted 25 minute actually 55 minute wait they finally seat us. Of course, I had to go during the lunch on the day everyone has off after Christmas (because Christmas was on the weekend this year), but it was weird to see that apparently only 3 people of the entire staff are allowed to seat people. I felt kind of bad for the hostess sitting in the booth managing the seating computer program thing.  Anyways, service was okay, food there is okay, I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory, it's not hard to anticipate what you're getting. It's a chain, NBA players love it, you get decent food, and given how prices have skyrocketed for other places, Cheesecake Factory has maintained relatively stable prices over the past few years. It'll be loud, it'll be crowded, and they give you a lot of ice in your drinks, but hey, it's a chain, what can you say?"
B B.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,115,36,4.0,2/26/2014,"In town on business decided to go to Cheesecake Factory with a work associate.  Service was well above average we were seated immediately with a pleasant smile and greeting by one of the hostesses.  Our server was there with 2 minutes and was not only very pleasant she was also very knowledgable of the specials and overall menu.  Not an easy task based on the size of the menu.  Atmosphere is nice maybe a little dark.  I find most of the seating to be a little close making the overall noise level higher.  We did get a booth which was nice.  I had angel hair paste and shrimp it was served hot I felt that the flavor wasn't up to par.  Needed more seasoning and garlic advertised as garlic shrimp mmm not much garlic.  It was good but not a WOW or AH HA factory average.  Overall Service was 5 stars, flavor 3, atmosphere/cleanliness 4:"
Andy D.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,7,,2.0,8/1/2014,"The service here is very slow. We have been sitting here for 50 minutes and the food has not come yet.  It took 10 minutes to get our drink orders, and another 10 for the bread to come.  There aren't even a lot of people here. In terms of food, it basically tastes the same as all the other Cheesecake Factories.  The pasta and their hamburgers are pretty good. And a wide selection of appetizers, main courses, desserts, and drinks."
Stephen S.,"Bennington, VT",8,1,,2.0,9/6/2013,"Came with a large group (14) on a Friday night. For some reason, Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, even for large groups. After the hour and a half wait, we were seated in a cramped area and waited a very long time for our food. The overall food quality was on par for a regular trip to the Cheesecake Factory. Getting our bill took almost 45 minutes and  we were told that paying with cash could take upwards of 10 extra minutes to get appropriate change. Overall, good food but incredibly slow service. I will definitely think twice before coming back next time"
Alicia M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,27,7,3.0,4/5/2015,"Can say I've been to better. First off, the girl at the front desk who took our names was very short and indifferent. How about you smile once and a while. When we left she was sitting on the counter on her phone! Next, the waiter must have been a bus boy. Asked us after we had been sitting there with our drinks if we ""needed some bread while we wait"". Yeah we need your complimentary bread that you were supposed to bring out when we sat down. He questioned me when I asked for new silverware because the set I had were smeared with something and water stained. And to top it off, I ordered a salad and asked for a side of salsa. He comes out a minute later with the side and sets it on my table. I waited another 15 minutes for my food and by then the salsa had been sitting on my empty table for that long. Whatever. Salad was good. After someone else brought us our food our waiter came over and asked if we met ""Mark"". He said he'd be filling in for us and so mike went to get us our empty waters that had been sitting on the table for a good amount of time. It wasn't busy. Mark was cool. Only reason I gave a tip was for Marks redemption of our visit. We got the check and left as soon as possible. New York sucks."
Andrea B.,"Arlington, MA",666,520,457,3.0,8/27/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite chain restaurant, and I don't get to go there nearly often enough.  Every pasta dish I have tried there has ranged from average to pretty good (the thai chicken pasta and the pasta carbonara are the two I usually alternate between), but I live for their cheesecake!  My favorites are the red velvet cake cheesecake and the banana cream cheesecake, but I haven't tried anywhere near all of them so I'm sure there are others that I would love too.  The slices are huge, so I always end up taking most of it home to eat as dessert for a week."
Katy L.,"Dalton, MA",4,104,33,5.0,3/28/2014,The menu is like a book. Total food coma after delightful and delicious food. Amazingly huge portions so that you have plenty of leftovers to bring home and leave room for dessert... Can you say epic cheesecake so many choices so little room left in the tummy. There are at least thirty kinds to choose from. My choice was Adam' peanutbutter fudge cheesecake so goooood!!! Definitely don't eat for several hours before you go.
Timothy R.,"Albany, NY",8,95,,2.0,12/19/2011,Only liked the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean (which they removed from the menu) after trying over 20 dishes on numerous visits - many through sharing.  And I was told they removed it because they made virtually no money on the dish and it took 20 min to make from the moment the ticket was put in.  Gotta love big business decision making. It's chain food with a Vegas vibe.  And they don't even have ricotta cheesecake!  Not everyone wants cream cheese cheesecake. Save your money unless you're with a group of unadventurous friends or the mall venue fits the bill. I want to like this place but the food has too many hints of processed flavors.
Diva A.,"Chester, MA",0,3,,1.0,6/13/2015,"I just exited from the restaurant. I am very sorry to have wasted my time at this restaurant on a Saturday evening !! Totally not worth it after an initial wait of 20 minutes which was very conveniently extended to 50 minutes. They are unable to prioritize their customers. Finally after being seated, they brought us wrong orders(chicken in a specified veg. pasta), the jambalaya pasta was absolutely tasteless and the Evelyn pasta was the size of a kids meal. I think this place is overrated ! Cheesecake factory had a reputation (not anymore), which is why this place is a sheer disappointment now, rather choose to go else where for dinner!!"
Diane C.,"Raquette Lake, NY",3,2,1,5.0,4/2/2014,Wonderful service! I recently ate lunch at this restaurant with two colleagues. There was a problem with the particular item I ordered. The manager and waiter went above and beyond to make it right and get me something else to eat. I was  very impressed with the customer service I received and the professionalism of the manager.  The food was extraordinary and the cheesecake was delicious! I can't wait to go back.
