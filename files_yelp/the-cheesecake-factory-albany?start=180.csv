Stephanie S.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",50,95,31,3.0,8/18/2011,"I really want to give Cheesecake Factory 2.5 stars, so I guess I'll round up for 3. For a chain restaurant I think Cheesecake Factory is one of the better.  That being said, I really don't like dining at chain restaurants.  But, for what it is it isn't that bad.  It's never my first choice, but if my friends or somebody wants to go there I wouldn't really object. It's open late which can be clutch since many restaurants aren't in Albany, and it's pretty consistent. The parking here stinks since it's in Colonie Center.  Sometimes I'll drive around and fight people for a spot.  Typically there is a wait, especially on the weekend or special occasions and you can't make reservations, so be prepared to wait a bit.   The menu is huge.  There is without a doubt something for everybody here.  If you have a picky eater they will surely find something.  They really have everything here:  pasta, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, entrees, appetizers, small plates, salads...list goes on.  And of course their long list of cheesecake.  I think out of everything on the menu the cheesecake is the best thing.  I typically stick with some kind of sandwich here.  Whenever I order some entree dish I usually feel kind of disappointed and let down.  When I read it on the menu it seems a lot better than when I get it and have it in front of me.  There are calories on the menu which is pretty scary considering even their salads have 1,000 calories.  The portions are definitely large but it doesn't make up for the oh so corporate feel of it.   The seating stinks if you get one of the tables and not a booth as you are typically on top of people sharing their conversations.   Service has typically been pretty decent when I've come here.  Never really had a bad experience with service.  Nothing to write home about, but not bad.   Overall, if you are in a pinch it's definitely not a bad place to go, but there are so so so many better restaurants in Albany."
Brian R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,22,,2.0,8/28/2011,"So I recently went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time and I was disappointed.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (which was supposed to be spicy, as it was advertised as such) but I kid you not even my sister who hates spicy foods said it was sweet.  It also didn't help that when the waiter brought the dish to me it looked like Thai diarrhea.  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT :(  The other people in my party had a range of other items and they all said the same thing - the food was too sweet.  I don't know if that's the Cheesecake Factory's trademark, to add extra sugar to everything, but it gave the food an unusual and inappropriate taste.  Not a fan. I did love their cheesecake though.  It was literally ""melt-in-your-mouth delicious"".  But, for me, this couldn't overcome the lack of taste and over sweetness of their food.   The service was alright and they do have an extensive menu.  Maybe they should cut out a few items and focus on making the rest better? Just a suggestion... And also, stop adding sugar to everything! Diabetes is an epidemic in this country Cheesecake Factory! Been here once, probably wont come back again unless coerced..."
Adriana S.,"Alexandria, VA",2,10,,1.0,9/29/2013,"My first time eating at the Albany area Cheesecake Factory and I probably will never go back.  A friend and I sat outside and when I asked to be moved to a table with an umbrella, was given an attitude by the waitress.  She told us to find a table and didn't even bother helping us open the umbrella.  Our second server was terrible too.  Took forever to get the food, the spaghetti I had was stuck to together and undercooked and the portions were way too big, even for the ""lunch"" size.  Took forever to get the check, the waitress didn't even bother to ask if we wanted it separate.  All in all a big disappointment."
James J.,"Albany, NY",108,30,77,2.0,12/29/2011,"Ventured here last night and i think everyone in town must have felt like it was too cold to cook at home. This place was packed full, the 40 min. wait wasn't too bad tho'. The waitstaff was decent, i think if she was able to check on us more often it would have been a better experience. The food was really good so i cant say much about that...except its a little pricey."
Kristy E.,"Albany, NY",824,171,569,3.0,11/23/2008,"I've been here so many times, I really can't remember. And it's never my idea, it's always my father's or a friends. It's The Cheesecake Factory, it's a chain and if you go in with chain expectations, you will probably be pleasantly surprised. The menu is gigantic, why I really don't know. I think it gets redundant, but I guess they want to have something for everyone. And I do think it's kinda funny that I can get edamame or fried mac and cheese balls. So random.  The only thing I don't like about the menu's are the tacky ads. I've never seen ads placed throughout a menu before this place. Surely this place generates enough profit to not need to sell ad space to companies trying to sell me jewelry or flooring?? I'm there to eat not check your products out. I like the apps, like I said the edamame is nice, because it's a healthy alternative. When it's an eat like I don't care day, I like the mac and cheese. The entrees are huge, I will never and could never finish one. They're not the most flavorful things ever, but they are better then most chains and are tasty. I got the chicken rustica last time and liked it. The shrimp with garlic wine sauce is also good. My dad loves the meatloaf, because well, it's meatloaf and it's HUGE. As for Jeff A's review.. I didn't know you could use too much water to cook pasta and mine has never been salty here. I myself use as much water as will fit in a pot, and it's comes out however I want it to. I've also never had a server reach over or around me to collect plates, so maybe he/she was new to the business. Most of the time in most places, they'll ask or say ""pardon my reach"" if they need to get at plates/silverware. Oddly enough, I have never had the same server twice, or even seen the same server twice on different visits. I think maybe Jeff's experience was just an off night or a new server.  I would recommend the place for budget versions of dishes that might be pricier at a non-chain restaurant or for higher ingredient count food. The menu is sure to have something for everyine. Date night? No! Leave this place for a casual meal, dinner with kids or for when everyone can't decided what they want. It gets noisy and it's not a lowkey place."
Carolyn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",858,697,232,3.0,10/24/2011,This was a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory. I was meeting a friend of mine here for lunch a couple of months ago and the portions are still as large as always. The food was delicious but they could do America a favor by cutting their serving sizes in half!
Dawn C.,"Wallkill, NY",12,10,2,5.0,4/1/2015,"This is a fun place to go too but seeing the calorie count on all the food was dicouraging. I could not enjoy what I was eating as my guilty consciousness did not allow me to pick what I wanted. With that being said, the options on the skinny menu was plentiful and very good."
Rena H.,"New York, NY",14,126,3,5.0,10/4/2013,"Jambalaya! Always best of my favorites among the menu of cheesecake factory. Cheesecakes are so good, and they can add things you would like to add to the cakes and make it special only for you. Wonderful services, taste, and environment."
Chad V.,"St. Albans, VT",1,4,5,3.0,9/23/2010,"Food was actually quite good for a chain restaurant. Service as could be expected for a busy Saturday night. Ask for a booth tho... worth the extra wait. The tables are close and make you feel crowded. They need a much better selection of draft beer, very disappointed with that.  Overall, being seated at a table next to 2 little kids that were up and down running around right next to me and on the other side of me, a table full of teenagers that I had to be conscious not to move too far to the right for fear of rubbing an elbow with one of them made for a very disappointing evening out. I would like to try this restaurant on a weekday evening and request a booth. They need to space their tables further apart for sure! There are a lot of great places to eat in Albany however and I doubt I will be going back here again unless, like this evening, I am hungry and too lazy to venture from the mall."
Pat M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,18,10,3.0,12/23/2014,Stopped in on my way too montreal typical cheese cake factory always a good stop.  Had the Cuban sandwich and a couple of Mai tai's good way to end the night after a long drive.
Bryan W.,"Garfield, NJ",4,79,,5.0,7/30/2013,"I am giving them 5 stars since they are Gluten Free friendly and the service was outstanding. I had the Chicken Quesadillas that they made with corn tortilla for me and it was delicious. My main course was the Chicken Mediera without the breaded chicken and it was perfect. My girlfriend enjoyed the Filet Mignon... On another note, the Strawberry Lemonades were awesome as well....."
Amanda J.,"Guilderland, NY",2,4,1,4.0,11/1/2013,"Love love love CCF! Portions are huge, atmosphere is comfortable, service is perfect. My only complaint is the wait time but that can hardly be complained about. They're a very good, very popular restaurant so of course it's always busy. It's my dinner of choice anytime I can afford to spoil myself (:"
Matthew M.,"New Bern, NC",0,61,81,4.0,1/17/2013,"This is a tough one to review. I've had many bad meals here and many flawless meals here. It really all depends on what you order for your entree. Drinks, appetizers, desserts and atmosphere are all great at this place. However, with the huge menu selection, sometimes your entree is just subpar at best. I'd recommend getting the Louisiana chicken pasta or the Cajun jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp. Renee's special is also great."
Ernest S.,"Rutland, VT",1,61,,4.0,4/2/2013,"Very consistent chain and I mean that in a good way. Most recently we went here for Easter brunch and were not disappointed. Nice portions, good service and good flavors. As usual we had to take most of our cheesecakes home as we can never finish both the meal and dessert. We've never had a bad meal or bad cheesecake."
Brian V.,"Chatham, NJ",53,282,35,3.0,3/23/2010,"I kinda always wanted to have Cheesecake Factory be one of two chain restaurants (along with Olive Garden) that I could say I had never been to.  I have to cross this place off the list, but Olive Garden, hopefully you and I will never meet. I was up in Albany with two coworkers and we were stopping for dinner after work.  I almost physically cringed when both of them said they didn't want to go someplace local and would prefer a chain, but I didn't want to make noise either.  When they asked if I liked Cheesecake Factory, and I honestly said I had never been, our dinner plans had been decided. The place is enormous, and seems like it is always packed.  We were three on a Monday night at 6pm and had to wait a few minutes for our table.  So basically, don't show up if you don't want to wait. Quick first impression:  HOLY SH*T THIS MENU IS HUGE.  If there's one primary benefit to this place, you can satisfy anyone with the food choices.  Of the three of us, one had a burger, one (me) had a burrito and one had salmon.  We also split calamari to start; not great, but not bad either. Second our food is here impression:  HOLY SH*T THESE PORTIONS ARE HUGE.  I'm well aware of America's continued path towards all you can eat food troughs, but even these portions were surprising to me.  Here's the thing though, the burrito was better than I expected it to be.  Everything was cooked fine and along the plate they had a cilantro lime aioli type sauce that was actually really good.  My coworkers liked their stuff too.   And, of course, because we're saps, we got cheesecake to go.  Honestly, this cheesecake is nothing special.  The best thing about this place is the variety of options.  How does one choose between red velvet cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, snickers cheesecake and the mind blowingly ridiculous peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake.  I went with snickers, and basically, eh. I don't love The Cheesecake Factory, far from it.  But as chains go, it's solid.  Nothing special, but solid, kind of like Albany, and my job performance."
Kelsey B.,"Amsterdam, NY",0,28,,5.0,10/27/2014,"This by far has to be my favorite chain restaurant, the menu here is just awesome for food and cheesecake. I have to travel about 45 minutes from where I live and every time I have been here has been a good experience. I love how big the menu is and find that the items on the menu are different from other restaurants which I like. The one time I went I think they either forgot to put our order in or messed it up so it took a little bit longer than usual but even so I have waited longer at other restaurants for food. I probably wouldn't have even noticed the time but I had an appointment I needed to make so we we were trying to get in and out quick.  They redeemed themselves when the manager came over and apologized and gave us our cheesecake for free, which was about $20 worth of cheesecake. Can't wait for my next visit!"
Jason C.,"Albany, NY",3,33,3,2.0,6/9/2010,"I dislike food chains, and I'll probably never give one more then 3 stars. Cheesecake is where ""everyone"" goes just to go there.... Sheep herd to this place.... There are good items on the menu and there are bad ones, it's too large - get rid of your junk food so are left with all the good stuff.  The Vanilla Mousse Cheesecake is really good, the rest suck.... seriously. If you want some good cheesecake, support a local business like Cheesecake Machismo is Albany."
Heather F.,"Albany, NY",0,8,,5.0,10/5/2014,"Always love the food & service at this Cheesecake factory! love it cannot wait to go back, menu is very large something for everyone!"
Lindzie T.,"Albany, NY",1,27,,2.0,1/25/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is an above average chain restaurant. You can get fairly consistent,""good"" food here. The service is hit or miss. I've had great servers and truly terrible ones. I got sick from bad eggs in a caesar salad once at this location. I do think it was an isolated incident, but ever since then I'm not too keen on the place. (and needless to say, I never got the caesar salad again!)"
Alica W.,"Albany, NY",1,5,,4.0,10/1/2014,"Always a great experience food when I dine here. Drinks are great, food is awesome, and the staff is always very friendly! My only complaint is the small tables for two. They are a little too close together for my liking, but the hostess happily sat us somewhere else."
