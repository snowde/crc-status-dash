Alexandra T.,"Latham, NY",0,4,,1.0,5/4/2012,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Wednesday, May 2 2012 for my brother's birthday dinner. I have celiac disease and cannot eat anything with gluten in it without becoming very sick. When I first went in, I asked the hostess for a gluten free menu; she said that they did not have one, but that my server would be happy to offer suggestions from the regular menu. Our server, Amy, came to the table, and I explained to her that I had celiac and that I would need suggestions as to what could be made gluten free. She told me that I should pick out a few things from the menu, and she would check in the back and see whether or not they could be made gluten free. I selected five different things, and she wrote them down and went in the back to check on them. She came back about five minutes later and explained whether or not each item could be prepared gluten free. I chose the Baja Chicken Tacos, which she told me I could eat as long as I did not have the salsa, rice, or beans. I was happy to have something delicious to eat, and we left her a $40 tip for being so helpful and accommodating. After dinner, I started to feel very sick, with stomach cramps and spasms through my entire abdominal cavity, and diarrhea. My sister called the restaurant, and the manager told her that the chicken in my tacos was marinated in a flour-based sauce. He told her that there was nothing that he could do for us, and we would have to wait to hear from their Risk Services department. She called back less than two minutes later to ask for our generous tip back, and the hostess told her that the manager had left for the night without even looking for him. As she had just gotten off the phone with the manager, this was an obvious lie, and the hostess begrudgingly went to look for him. He told her that should could come in the next day to get our tip back, but that there was nothing else that he could do. The next day, my sister went to pick up our tip, as I was still too sick to go myself. She was told that the waitress had only claimed a $20 tip on our table, so that was all that he could give her. This was a blatant lie, and it is insulting to insinuate that my family would leave only $20 when our bill was $188. Again, she was told that there was nothing he could do about it. She also tried calling their corporate office, but was given the same answer. No one in this company is willing to apologize or take responsibility for their negligence. Food allergies are a serious thing, and I am lucky that I only became violently ill and was not killed; if I had a peanut or egg allergy, I would be dead. They need to take responsibility for educating their staff. I want to make sure that this story is out there because I don't want anyone else to suffer like I did. I am still waiting for a resolution for this issue."
Neil V.,"Lebanon, NH",59,123,2,3.0,3/3/2009,"I have always been one to choose the small locally owned restaurant over the big chain restaurant. Cheesecake factory reminds me why I fell this way but it also offers me some hope for the big chain restaurants. My major complaint is the size of the menu, I hate huge menus. The best menus I have ever eaten from had 15 items or less; the Cheesecake factory must have 85 items on the menu. It was like reading a book. The food was actually quit good, better then what I was expecting. The waitstaff and atmosphere was not up to par with the best restaurants and the prices while fair didn't offer value."
Kris B.,"Hudson, NY",0,7,,2.0,8/17/2009,"visited for the first time in a long while in order to get out of the extreme heat...all mediocre, as expected,  at this ""mega-diner with 'tude"" w/exception of (1) drink prices... $11.25 for Grey Goose on Rocks""  and $8.50 for house vodka (2)  BLT salad...all iceberg lettuce, nearly a full head!!! with barely a smear of egg, bacon and tomato  (must be improving those profit margins)  and (3) ""fire-roast fresh artichokes""...seemed they boiled or nuked them to death before briefly touching them to some heat to add the illusion of grilling....so soggy (and flavorless)that you could eat the entire 'choke including leafs and stems.  But they don't lie...it is a factory and not a culinary arts showcase."
John R.,"Hadley, MA",2,144,,3.0,1/6/2011,"OK, it's a chain, so it's most likely not gonna scramble your brain with deliciousness. My meal here was actually not bad, a Thai noodle affair I ordered and was surprisingly good. I've had other ""not my Thai noodle jam"" dishes and they weren't good though.  The bad: it's REALLY noisy in there. It's almost unbelievable how noisy. Booths are a must, because the tables make it feel like you're dining with your neighbors next to you. TOO intimate if you will. If you are not interested in communing with strangers, this might not be the place for you. Protect your plate, your neighbor could steal a bite you're so close! Finally, while the cheesecakes are pretty good, per slice, they're ridackulously expensive. Last time I was there was $7/per slice or something. I loudly questioned if that $7 came with sexual favors, which made the person behind the counter laugh. It's an experience, go at your own risk!"
Foodie C.,"New York, NY",7,375,12,5.0,12/11/2008,I know it's a chain but they make damn good food. And offer such variety to it to.
ct l.,"East Rockaway, NY",0,24,,2.0,3/28/2009,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night not expecting a large crowd. Well, I was wrong. Was told by the hostess the wait would be a 1/2 hour and ended up waiting over an hour. The waitress we had was efficient but really tried to push those desserts after eating the huge portion of food. It looked like the manager was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Don't know if I'll go back to that particular Cheesecake Factory again. Maybe they better retrain the hostess to tell time."
Wendy S.,"Minneapolis, MN",6,27,,4.0,9/7/2008,I love love LOVE the food here. Their avocado eggrolls are my favorite and their dishes are good. I'm always satisfied whenever we go here
Jeffery A.,"Toronto, Canada",0,13,,2.0,11/23/2008,"Went on a Sat. night. 1) Pasta over salted - someone must have not been looking when they dumped too much salt into the water for cooking pasta.  Everyone's pasta @ the table was over salted. 2) The ""non-pasta"" portions of the dishes was fine.  Not great, but fine.  I had the pork tenderloins w/ bacon and portobello mushrooms.  Anything w/ bacon tastes good.   3) Service - please, don't start collecting dishes and plates over still eating customers.  Sure, take out some stuff to make sure the table isn't crowded, but there is no reason to reach over, under, and in front of me. 4) I think we'll stick with Sunday brunch."
Michael S.,"Patchogue, NY",36,29,6,4.0,7/29/2010,"I was really impressed with this place compared to what I would expect from a chain restaurant. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory. In my experience they are mostly all located in large shopping mall locations as the only 3 I've seen have been. We had just gotten back from Saratoga Race Track and were looking for decent food that wasn't overpriced like most of the restaurants in the vicinity of the Saratoga Race Track. Besides the half hour wait, this place served very well. The decor was more then I had expected since I had never been inside one of the places. I saw a review where someone said they didn't like the decor but usually IMO you don't see too many restaurants that have the amenities this restaurant has such as the cathedral ceiling and very ornate decor and for the price it was more then reasonable. The food was pretty good, not as good as the decor would insinuate but good enough for what I expected. All in all a great place to go, reminded me VERY much of the Grand Luxe Cafe but a little nicer. I've heard they have the same owner."
