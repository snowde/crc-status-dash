Ely D.,"Troy, NY",0,10,2,3.0,7/7/2017,"Love their brunch menu on Sundays. But don't ever sit outside!! You will wait forever for service. It has been the same story for me every time I sit out on The patio area. They forget about you! And usually bad servers too. I do go here often, inside I usually don't have any issues, except maybe for the humongous portions."
Ernest T.,"Culiacán Rosales, Mexico",5,9,22,1.0,10/16/2016,"A noisy crowded place. It has an extensive menu that can accommodate almost any taste. I had the poached eggs over a crab hash. Companion had chilaquiles. My Mexican companion liked the dry pork. However, the dish was not Mexican nor was it texmex. My companion recommends to avoid this dish. My crab hash was loaded with green and red bell peppers and very little crab. The potatoes were over cooked and oily. The service was deplorable. Our waiter disappeared several times. He turned up fifteen minutes after I finished. After he gave me the check, he once again disappeared. I had to flagged another waiter who was more concerned with customer service, All in all, it was an extremely negative experience."
Tammy A.,"Staten Island, NY",0,9,,1.0,9/21/2017,"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time.  We went on a Thursday night. Restaurant was busy but nothing crazy. Took about 5-10 min to get a table which is fine. We waited over an hour for our main meal! Appetizer came out in about 20 min. With 2 little kids, waiting that long for a meal is just so painful. After the meal it took another 20-30 min for the waiter to bring our check! The food wasn't great either and my mashed potatoes seemed hard and didn't taste fresh.   Never going back."
Aleyna S.,"Watervliet, NY",6,54,61,5.0,1/19/2017,"I just love this place. It never disappoints. I go monthly and I always walk out happy. It's a really popular spot, and gets really busy on certain days. It's best to go when there isn't as much people :)"
Alli D.,"Troy, NY",167,38,4,1.0,3/6/2016,"1. Waited over an hour for just appetizers. 2. The waitress seemed completely annoyed to have a table. She hardly checked on us. Left us waiting for food without refilling our water or bread. She only started coming up to us after we spoke with the manager. 3. Burnt bacon on both burgers that came out to our table and the top of the biscuits were solid. Overall, the food was bland and left under lights too long. The service was AWFUL. Never returning."
Leila M.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,12,,5.0,1/26/2017,"Visited this location for the first time today. Our server (Spencer) was not only attentive to us, but he made my six year old daughter feel so special. He chatted with her and was so friendly. My daughter kept telling me how nice he was and wants to go back. Customer service is a very big factor for me.  We will return and I hope all the servers will be as kind as he was.  Cheesecake was delicious of course!"
Rodman J.,"Burlington, VT",22,7,,1.0,7/8/2017,"We love Cheesecake Factory and have been to many locations, however this must be the worst we have ever been too. First off other locations have always taken reservations for larger parties, when I called to make one they said only after 9:30.....even though the web and yelp said they took them. When I mentioned that to the hostess and manager at the counter they disagreed with me in a disrespectful way. All I wanted was to bring it to their attention. We were told that the wait time was 30 minutes but after sitting there for 45 minutes we asked. The hostess said that they had paged us (which was always being held and never went off) then they said called our name, which must have been a whisper since again we never heard that and we were SITTING right there. Overall wait time was an hour. And after all that the meals were less then desirable. I would not go back to this location again."
Marcelle M.,"Rensselaer, NY",3,14,3,5.0,7/5/2017,"Just recently went here for a birthday dinner. Our waiter was Blake, and he didn't care how much bread and drinks we requested. Our food came pretty quick, considering the amount of people in the restaurant. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, and it was very well cooked and prepared. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory never fails to impress. I cannot wait to come back again."
Janny N.,"Tulsa, OK",91,5,7,1.0,5/21/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. If there is an option for 0 star this place deserves it. It was last Saturday when we went. Understood that we had to wait because of the large party. They told us to wait 1 hour to one and half. So we waited 2 hrs later still no table. Waited 30 more mins they finally got us a large table. They set us aside and tell us to wait more. I think they didnt had enough employees that night so the manager had to seat people. He was very very rude. We finally got seated at 10:30. The food was not good at all. They messed up most of the orders. I give the one star to the waiter he was actually nice and helpful. Overall I don't think me or my family would ever visit this Cheesecake Factory ever again.
Evelyn S.,"Saratoga County, NY",31,12,4,1.0,5/30/2017,"I had a shepherd's pie today and I don't recommend it. It was a greasy, cold, and nasty mess! I had about 3 bites and left most of it. I could see that the concoction was thrown together with some bad ground beef, a gravy that didn't taste like beef, some peas and carrots and slivers of zucchini. They plopped a small portion of mashed potatoes on top and browned them with a torch. All of the bad flavors contradicted each other making for a very nauseating dish! I am surprised that the waitress did not ask me why I didn't want to take it home. I guess she was not astute enough to see that I didn't like it. I had to tell her to tell the kitchen that it was very greasy! Dumb, dumb, dumb! I got home with such a stomach ache! I don't know if I will return. I've had such bad luck with the Cheesecake Factory!"
Bob L.,"Waterford, NY",0,1,1,1.0,10/1/2017,"Disgusting over priced garbage.  With terrible service to boot.  Our waiter seemed to be the one out to lunch. He didn't even notice the pile of dirty silverware with chunks of food stuck to them that we put at the end of our table. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich and a turkey club.  You would think at around $15 per sandwich and wait almost 25 minutes it would be awesome. Nope. My club was ok, I've had better at most diners.  My wife's chicken salad was gross and they even used the end of the bread loaf and flipped it over so we wouldn't notice.  We did. We sent our fries back because they were dried out and cold.  We skipped the cheesecake mostly because we kind of lost our appetite and figured Jeremy B would get lost on his way back to our table. We don't usually eat at chains. I'm sorry we we did. I will never set food in that place again."
Linda C.,"New York, NY",29,136,171,2.0,2/13/2016,"I've been here twice before and had no issues with any of the food and I absolutely love their cheesecakes. However, I came back last night with a few other friends since I've been really craving for some pasta and the first place that popped into my mind was the Cheesecake Factory.  We waited 40 mins on a busy Friday night but that was to be expected anyway. I ordered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm just gonna get straight to the point for this review. The pasta was good, until after a few bites. My stomach started to hurt like crazy after I ate a piece of chicken. I had to go to the bathroom twice because I knew that I ate something bad and my stomach wasn't feeling it either. After I returned, I didn't feel like eating any more of the dish but I still wanted some cheesecake. A friend and I shared the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake because we both love cookie dough. The crust and cookie dough part were SO hard. I've had this particular cheesecake before and it was never that hard. Our spoons couldn't even get through to the bottom and we were only able to eat the top half of it.  Sadly, I was disappointed with the food last night. While both the entree and dessert tasted good, they didn't leave my stomach feeling too good. My stomach still hurts 20 hours later. Not sure if I'm gonna be going back anytime soon."
Al M.,"Shelton, CT",0,17,,2.0,5/10/2017,"I see why it only had three stars. Mediocre food at best, server clearly overwhelmed. Had to ask for bread and she kept walking by us over and over before taking our order. Far too long of a wait. Forgot fries that were supposed to come with my lunch, didn't even offer an apology. Turkey burger tasted gamey. Even a group of elderly women in our section were complaining about the food quality to the manager. Easily the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to."
Sharon W.,"Rensselaer, NY",37,137,117,2.0,7/24/2016,"Absolutely the worst service ever- Sunday at 7pm reservation for 10 people. Not seated until 730. Ordered the top of the line champagne it took- 20 min to get. Kids menu spaghetti  and and meat balls they were out of- another dinner was told after we all got our food-sorry they were out- then we had to ask where sub was.  We had all finished eating- BTW- it was only lettuce wraps!  Ok so, we orders another bottle of champagne asked to speak with manager- still took another 30 min and we had to ask about the where bouts of the bottle. The manager talked a lot.  Then the bar tender who came with our second of bottle told us that we had to realize there were 50 other guests.  We subsequently told them we didn't want the bottle and to just get the kids dessert to go.  They did comp the desserts, but seriously---"
Danielle S.,"Clifton Park, NY",86,20,16,1.0,6/21/2016,"Worst time ever. Waiting almost 2 hours for our food. And an hour and a half for our appetizers. I can't believe it. She said they burned out app then it was coming out at she was saying that. Said a salad was included in our meal then charged 6 dollars for it later. Spilled fries all over me. Not just like one, but the entire thing. She never came over to see how our food was or anything. I understand if we came in at 1030 or even 10 considering they closed at 11. We came in at 9pm. Never offered an apology or an I'm sorry. Never offered to credit anything on the bill until we complained about the $6 salad. NOTHING."
J S.,"Island Park, ID",44,10,3,2.0,7/26/2016,"It's always busy and crowded but it's almost always reasonably quick. Not tonight. We were seated over half an hour ago. Waited for initial contact. Waited for bread. Waited for more bread that was only half as full. Still no meals. Disappointing experience given the time we had to wait to be seated and now have to wait for meals.  In regards to cheesecake factory's response I wasn't upset about the wait to be seated. I expect that at your restaurant. What was disappointing was waiting over 45 minutes from the time we ordered food until we got it. Never mind that we ordered sandwiches and salads so I doubt it took that long to cook. Never received an apologist or explanation from the waitress during that entire period. Then we ate and ordered cheesecake and it took 15 minutes to bring out cheesecake. 15 minutes for our waitress to walk over to the cheesecake area and pick up the slices. Unacceptable. Again no apologies.  I ended up getting up and speaking to the manager. We spent almost an hour and 45 minutes having dinner mostly because we waited and waited. I got a poor apology from the manager with no explanation for the delay (mind you people at other nearby tables with our same waitress looks board out of their minds without their meals too). The check was adjusted by the manager and the waitress brings it out and only manages to say ""here's your adjusted bill.""  Still no apology or explanation.  I could have lived with slow service if it had been accompanied by good customer service, but this was pathetic and is what made the entire experience bad."
Jane A.,"Albany, NY",0,7,3,2.0,1/22/2017,"Pissed off beyond belief this specific night. My friends and I were given a beeper and told the wait was 50-70 minutes. My friends and I  waited AT LEAST an hour and 45 minutes,before we had enough and left! as we watched people get seated that came 10 minutes after us and only waited 5 minutes! Not fair!  I do not understand what goes thru people's minds! how is it fair that people who wait 2 hours are ignored while people can walk in and be seated in 10 minutes!?!?! The place was humid and hot and I got a horrible migraine. I put the beeper down and walked out to an Indian restaurant around the area,I was pissed. Another thing that pissed me off was the fact that able bodied men were sitting in the waiting area! I saw no woman sitting down and no child sitting down! I do not know how it doesnt bother a 30-50 yr old guy sitting down with his legs sprawled out while pregnant women were standing around and children were standing.   I was standing near a little child, this little boy was  so respectful and quiet. Have some decency and class to at least stand up when you see a kid standing! no morals these days! I was sick of it. The humidity,the long wait,standing there watching as people get seated when they came literally 10 minutes after me and waited 5 minutes when my friends and I waited 2 hours! AND THE BEEPER STILL DIDNT GO OFF! ridiculous! common courtesy,I hope the manager is reading this because this is not an upscale restaurant to be treating people like this.I have been to many upscale restaurants from NY to LA, and they treat their customers with respect.I am a very patient person and I dont mind waiting, the wait isnt what ticked me off.It is the total disregard! the hostesses were making full eye contact with people standing there! couldnt you notice people were standing there as long as your shift was? I am not going to be too hard on them because I have dined in this place and the food was amazing.Proportions were huge! waiters were very kind and helpful. I would recommend the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer. however, this place needs  a new system of seating people! because it is not right and not fair for people to be standing for 2 hours, while some people are seated in 3 minutes.  Because what is going to end up happening is these people are going to leave. Nobody is crazy enough to wait 2 or more hours. Without sitting! because apparently those seats are always taken by grown adult Lumber jack built men who cant stand with the rest of us women,children and pregnant people.  MANAGEMENT: if you are going to have people wait ridiculous amounts of time at least put more seating out! so I dont feel like Im playing musical chairs and I'm standing around with no seat. I literally had a throbbing migraine and a turning stomach from the smell of food,humidity,synthetic cheap $1 store body spray from SOME customers who passed by, or the smell of old dirty winter clothing from other customers. It was so packed that people were standing back o back like old school fire drills. So if anyone had bad smelling hair or bad Body odour,it was in full effect. You can not have people standing around. People are standing around in a crowded area while others are coming in, so I was constantly bumping into people by accident. Come on now, you cant be having this. Do better."
Erin K.,"Port Ewen, NY",15,26,7,2.0,1/22/2017,"This location is definitely hit or miss. Last time we came here, we were extremely happy with our food and service. This time was different. When our drinks arrived, there were crumbs and specs of something floating in them. I ordered my meal specifically without asparagus and was served extra asparagus. When I told the waitress, her reaction was oops. I decided not to have them redo the order because everyone else's meal was already served. There was no apology. When the waitress gave us our check, she tossed it on the table and didn't even thank us as we left. Definitely not an atmosphere I enjoyed. I love the cheesecake factory in Tucson, AZ. This was a disappointment."
Alexa A.,"Woodrow, NY",163,118,72,5.0,1/22/2017,Ate here twice since ive been in albany. Both servers were super friendly and was very attentive to my table. Everything was very good especially the food I have ordered. This will be my go to place in albany
Travis J.,"Rensselaer, NY",260,32,25,2.0,7/30/2016,Tonight was not a good night out. We were greeted by a long wait time. Our waitress almost gave us plates that had something crusted onto it. Then we ordered some wine and it had fruit flies in it. It took forever for the food to come out. The only thing saving tonight was that the food tasted good.
