Kayli R.,"Newburgh, NY",0,27,,5.0,5/2/2017,"Had a good experience here for an unexpected date night traveling through Albany. Service was fast and friendly, the angel hair with shrimp is to die for, and the desserts are huge! Tip: don't look at calories. Just don't do it!!!!"
Philip D.,"Albany, NY",0,11,,4.0,9/2/2017,"The food is decent, cheesecake fantastic.  I've been many times and always had competent staff."
Bill F.,"Charlotte, NC",6,72,90,4.0,1/15/2017,"My experience here was just fine unlike the many negative reviews. I was here for Sunday brunch, was seated within one minute, placed my drink order immediately which is brought very quickly when I placed my meal order. 35 minutes later received my Montecristo sandwich which was excellent. My waiter checked on me several times while I ate , refreshed my iced tea, and brought my check when asked."
S D.,"Troy, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Went here as a suggestion from my g/f for our anniversary dinner after catching a movie. Placed our order for an appetizer of mushrooms, came out pretty quick and was tasty. And here is where it went sour. I placed my order for a combo dish, I knew the portion would be smaller due to it being a mix but I wanted to try both. I ordered Steak Diane and Salmon, our food comes, and I get Salmon and Shrimp. I tell the waitress that I ordered steak and salmon,she takes the food and returns 15 mins later with steak and shrimp. The steak was barely cooked and I was just done trying to get my order right I would have been there all night.  Won't be coming back here, plenty of cheaper options to eat that can take an order right and have it cooked properly."
Martin L.,"Hovedstaden, Denmark",1,7,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Love the cheesecake factory and have been to many across the US and abroad. This branch is categories below normal standard. Food was not well prepared had to wait 40 minutes for the entrees, 1 entree missing, came 20 minutes later - Upside: it was the only one that was freshly prepared. A soggy pasta carbonara, that had been sitting somewhere for a loong time before being served a crusty paremsan chicken that was completely soggy, and steak chicken combos with mashed potato that was claery reheated and brick hard. got 45 taken off the bill and the free cheescake, but still paid 150 for really bad food. CheesecakeFactory - Check this branch, something is way off !"
Samantha H.,"Mechanicville, NY",30,5,,1.0,11/9/2017,"I was here a couple weeks ago with my family for my birthday with a party of 9. We were seated pretty quickly. It did take a while for us to order as the party members did get there at separate times, but as soon as everyone was there it took over 30 minutes for the wait staff to check in on us and check on drinks or ask if anyone wanted appetizers. So we place our orders and it takes over an hour for us to get our food, and meanwhile, no one checked in on drinks or to even let us know what the status of our order was. I had to ask after almost 90 minutes because no one was going to volunteer that information, clearly. So our food finally comes out, everyone's plate except my husbands. Again, there was no acknowledgement made in regards to this at all from any of the 4 food runners that came out to give us our food. So at this point I pretty angrily inquired about why my husband wasn't brought his dinner. Our waitress asked for our patience while she spoke with a manager to find out why his food wasn't ready. So 20 (!!!!!!!!!) minutes passes by with no response, so I had to track our waitress down to which she responds ""I forgot to ask!"" I'm sorry are you freaking kidding me?!?!?!?!?! So about 3 minutes later she comes to our table and says that the kitchen didn't make his food right the first time so they're just now working on his dinner, meanwhile everyone else has had theirs, but has refrained from tucking in so my husband isnt at the table watching everyone else eat. So his food finally comes out 10 minutes later so for a total calculation my husband has been waiting almost 2 hours for his food which is freaking obscene. The waitress was apologetic and offers a free piece of cheesecake but the slice can't exceed $6?!?! are you serious?!?! So I flipped, I won't lie. Not only does she have the audacity to act like its not her responsibility or her JOB for that matter, but to try to reimburse my husband for his 2 hours wait time for a simple freaking dinner and put a cap on how much she'll reimburse for 2 hours wasted....I could have MADE dinner for 9 people in 2 hours. I insisted she take his dinner off the bill and I shouldn't have had to. As someone that worked in customer service for 10 years, I would know, that this is not acceptable. I'll be honest the total bill was almost $300 and we left her a $50 tip, but she's lucky she got one at all. On a side note, turn the freaking lights on in the restaurant would ya?! there were people trying to read their menus with the flashlights from their phones!"
Ben I.,"Albany, NY",2,14,,1.0,4/11/2016,"If you're thinking of going here and you're picky enough to read reviews...click on somewhere better.  First impression : place is gigantic, packed, noisy, and looks like a casino floor. Half an hour wait to be seated. Is it really so great, or is it location, location...anchor store right in the center or colonie center with a big sign facing the parking lot. I've never been here despite holding a gift card to the place for 2+ years.  My hopes are very low.  The best I can imagine is a 'good' chain like recovery room, but when cheesecake is your main claim to fame I am not even expecting that much.  We're seated. Server immediately arrives and asks if we know what we want. The menus are sitting untouched on the table still.  Not the most observant chap. We get things going.  I skip the apps, although several options sound good.  I am hoping not to spend 'real' money here still. I ordered fish and chips.  I figure that's pretty easy for a place like this, maybe they'll have a decent offering. My dining companion goes for huevos rancheros. Sadly, no.  One can get a better fish and chips at mcdonalds for less than 1/3 the $19 this disappointing option set us back.  First problem, it wasnt one large piece of fish, or even large-ish pieces. They were small, factory-reject looking pieces. Glistening with greasy sweat, too, with the batter torn off some pieces from mishandling.  One step down and you'd basically have gortons fish sticks here, poorly perpared fish sticks to boot. The flavor - was nonexistent, just the taste of fried flour and the blandest whitefish. I'm not even sure if they put salt and pepper in the batter...the tiny cup of tartar sauce is quickly drained. For a 20 bill, I can't even get a legit portion of tartar sauce?! What kind of barbaric establishment is this?     But how about those chips!? Who doesnt love fries - and a popular place like this must have decent fries, right?  Wrong.  They're edible, but bland. Again, I'm left wondering if this could even stand up against fast food fries. Bleh. Like eating fried cardboard, flavorles, dull, stale.  The coleslaw, predictably, was a fail too.  My counterpart's mexican eggs look somewhat better, (and by better, I mean like something edible a grade schooler might put together) but I don't hear any rants and raves about how good it is. It's basically eggs unceremoniously plopped on a tortilla with some can black beans underneath. Oooh, but there's a couple avocado slices! Wow!  I could put this whole thing together in a couple minutes for probably a dollar a plate.  We skip the cheesecake.  It's easy enough to make and kind of just a boring, filling option. I'm sure it's outrageously overpriced. Which seems to describe this place well overall.  To sum up - crowded, loud, long wait, boring, flavorless, filling, overpriced.  I imagine the food comes from some kind of bland gluten machine in the back which presses ""food"" into various shapes and sprays a skin on it after to make it look like food, which providing the cheapest factory fill-u-up calories possible.  Needless to say, I won't ever be going back to one of these.  It baffles and troubles me that many other people line up to eat here, but that seems to be the way of the world."
A I.,"Johnstown, NY",14,8,,1.0,1/14/2017,"Said the wait would be an hour, took over an hour and a half plus the buzzer rang twice and we were told we were only there for 38 minutes and they kept finding us different fobs. Many people went ahead of us that seemed to be there for less. Hostess was demeaning. Shouldn't have to wait so long for mediocre food."
Jermaine L.,"New Windsor, NY",0,3,10,1.0,5/21/2017,"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. Food was even worse. Had a 630pm appointment. Arrived at 545pm. Lines were moving and we checked in early. Everyone else was sat down before us. Larger and smaller parties so there was no excuses why we were over looked and not sat down until 7:04pm. Didn't see a waitress until over 10 minutes of seating. Came to the table and acted like any questions we had was a problem and that we interrupted her break. Facial expressions and body language was all off nevertheless ordered our food and after three trips to the table with the wrong orders finally got our order after an hour. You can tell they forgot the food under the lamps because my pasta was stuck to the plate and hard( which the waitress seen and agreed yet still delivered it to the table like I wasn't worthy of good service or food) Everyone at the table food was cold.  When we advised our waitress of the food she agreed yet still acted like it was a problem that we complained about our food. Took my plate back to the kitchen which took less than five minutes to bring back to the table only to find out it's the same pasta that left the table, they just put in and reheated it. Pasta was still hard on the bottom. When I advised the waitress just to give me the check and let me get out of here it still took over ten minutes to get the check which she over charged me then took another ten minutes to correct the problem with managements help. The manager came to the table and mind you I'm paying for three out of eleven people at the table and all of our dishes were messed up didn't even apologize. After paying over $85 for three nasty and disgusting dishes which all were taken out the restaurant and thrown away in their trash outside( mind you nothing was taken off the ticket knowing how bad the food and service was) I asked the manager for his card and started explaining what went wrong and he totally brushed me off and basically was told to go back to my table that they were working on it. Bad as it all was the manager didn't even know the waitresses name. She looked so offended when he got her name wrong. I wish I could say that this was the end of my horrible night which was suppose to be a glorious day because my sister graduated college after all the obstacles that she has gone through. As I started to drive home which is about two hours away, I had to make two stops on the side of the road due to me not being able to hold the food down. Threw up all over my dashboard and inside windshield was the first stop and next stop was to wipe down and clean my car out. Do you know how hard it is to clean throw up out car vents while trucks are passing you at 70mph? My two year old son just fell asleep after two diaper changes in two hours. I don't know how you guys stay open with horrible customer service and disgusting food. As I see the comments and reviews I get even more mad at myself for not reading all these before entering this establishment. The replies are so generic and could care less about your experience. So to Oliver Sanders the manager who gave me his card please continue to work on your training and how you talk to people. Take care of your customers, if it wasn't for us you wouldn't have a job. Just a little food for thought. Server 0689 Cierra L. You tried. The Georgia peach was on point from the bar. Everything from the kitchen was horrible. I even wrote that on the credit card receipt, not that anyone one in there cared. The palisades mall Cheesecake Factory is still the best."
Staycia S.,"Queensbury, NY",20,3,,1.0,5/17/2017,"On May 3rd 2017 I went to the cheesecake factory in Albany NY. I was accompanied by my mother-in-law and my son. I notice that our silverware was just placed onto the table with no napkin or plate underneath them. So I gathered all the silverware an was going to ask for clean ones before we ate. (Im not a germaphobe but I've worked as housekeeping in a hospital an it opens your eyes to a whole new world of germs.) I look to the left and I noticed the busboy quickly cleaning the table not noticing how he ""cleaned"" the table at the time. As I sat there and talked to my very excited 5 year old about his pizza he so wanted badly...The bus boy came to the table to the right of us he quickly scoops the plates into his ""dirty plates bucket"" and resets the table not cleaning off the table with a rag (even though the rags aren't always that clean anyways still seems more sanitary then the person sitting there prior.) He then sets the new ""clean"" silverware on the dirty table. So I began to look at the silverware we had gathered into the middle of the table. Mind you we had not ordered anything prior to this. As normal there was dishwasher water spots on the knifes but what grossed me out the most was lettuce stuck on the fork I was going to use to eat my food. (It actually made me sick to my stomch) As I finally flag down our waitress here comes our food so I refuse the food. I told her nicely I'd pay for the drinks but not the food an we were leaving. She got the manager and told him what I had told her. He said drinks were on the house. Now mind you my five year old son was very anxious for that pizza that was about to be served to him. ( to the point of crying an my mother took him to the car so there wasn't a melt down.) I could not let him eat that seeing how they cleaned their customer side of the restaurant. How was the back of the restaurant cleaned? How was my food prepared? I could not see what happens behind closed doors but definitely saw what was in front of my face. I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory and I have heard so many good things about it. I will never return to this one!!!! Possibly give another one a try but this restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth for life!"
Daria L.,"Watervliet, NY",11,34,,3.0,2/10/2017,I love the cheese cake factory however the last time I was there a few weeks ago and the service for the second time was ridiculously slow. Inattentive waitress  not good but second visit was better than first won't be going back anytime soon
Marisol B.,"Clarksville, MD",1,7,2,1.0,7/27/2017,I just had another horrible experience with cheesecake factory   they are not allergy friendly   couldn't even have an omelette. It was 3:30 and they had mixed the eggs with sour cream in the morning. And. Refused to make fresh eggs for me.  Great place.  Not!!!
Jeff R.,"Syracuse, NY",15,8,2,4.0,1/28/2017,"Saturday lunch, not to crowded but filling up as we waited for our food. Cuban sandwich day and Cobb salad w/salmon for the wife. Staff. Wry friendly,took a while to get our food, but it tasted great!"
Michalina S.,"Feura Bush, NY",165,12,1,1.0,6/4/2015,"What a disappointment. My husband and I travel and eat out extensively. We always see The Cheescake Factory busy and wanted to check it out.  Decor was nice, wait staff friendly and menu was pages long of choices. The number of options may be why the food was an epic fail. My entree was a sausage and shrimp dish and my husband had a Gumbo over noodles. I was horrified to bite into raw shrimp! COMPLETELY RAW. We looked through the rest of my dish and ALL of the where shrimp were raw not, not cooked enough RAW. We sent it back and manager apologized. My husbands noodle dry as can be. The table next to us had BURNT nachos brought to them twice! They never stayed for their entrees. After being served burnt apps and being there over an hour they complained and left.  Due to our entrees being unediable the manager offered us free desert. We took it home. Ah, ha finally something good! Cheese cake was amazing! So if you are just looking for a cocktail and or desert ok Meals no,no,no.... NO"
Sean M.,"Albany, NY",119,3,,2.0,6/27/2017,"I wish I could rate the food and the service apart from each other because the service aspect was extremely lacking on this visit.  Arrived on a Sunday afternoon around 2 clock and was able to be seated on the patio since the weather was so beautiful.  Was greeted by our server and ordered two waters, lemon , a coffee and a cocktail.  Half of the drink order was brought over to our table and needed to be requested again because it was clear that with no mention of the rest coming, that it was just overlooked.  Okay, so not a huge deal.  Ordered the lettuce wrap appetizer to share and two club sandwiches.  After 25 minutes of waiting for the appetizer I asked our server if it was coming out first as I did not want the food all at once.  The server said it would be coming out first but gave no mention or reasoning as to the long wait time.   Okay, still not the biggest deal until it finally arrived.  At 28 minutes, the appetizer came out but the server brought no sharing plates.  She recognized this on her own and asked if we would like plates.  We responded yes and ordered another cocktail.  Well five minutes went by and our appetizer was still just sitting there because she never came back with the plates.  Seeing that there was this huge server station on the patio, I stood up, walked over to it and got my own plates so we could enjoy our food.  Exactly why did she walk by this station to go back inside without grabbing plates is beyond me.  It would have taken her 30 seconds instead of letting us sit there with no plates to eat.  The kicker is that when she finally did come back with the drink order, she had no plates in hand  After the appetizer and a order of edamame that we ordered half way through our sandwiches came.  Food was great.  For some reason the fries on my sandwich were cold and my companions were hot.  Honestly, at this point, cold fries are hardly something I care about so I just let that go.  However once we finished our sandwiches our server disappeared...for over 20 minutes.  We sat there needing boxes and the check.  I once again after getting frustrated waiting again, stood up and was about to head to the server station when my lunch companion flagged over a busboy who was quick to get us what we needed.  We packaged up all our food and when the server noticed us doing this, came over promptly with the check and to get the payment.  Maybe she was finally catching on to the fact that we did half our service on our own.  Overall, all the food was great except for one order of cold fries on the sandwich plate.  The service however seriously lacked and is one of those experiences that when your left to wanting to go out to a restaurant for a relaxing experience will make you think twice before deciding to go again.  Perhaps the server had a lot of tables inside and was really busy, I'm not entirely sure, but again, she walked by a station where she could of gotten plates.  That is just plain unobservant."
Dennis C.,"Latham, NY",62,39,14,4.0,5/11/2015,"This place is so weird, I both love and hate it - probably more love than hate though. For starters, if you try to just show up on a busy night.. like Friday or Saturday, it's like not even worth it. You'll wait forever because the whole world seems to want to go there and they don't take phone reservations... booo. But when you do actually get there it is great, they have SUCH a huge menu its unbelievable. Like I am shocked they can keep up on the food quality the way they do when they serve so many different options. They do though - meals are always fantastic!! I will complain a little about the seating... while sometimes you luck out and get a nice table with nobody next to you, but twice I had to sit nearly shoulder to shoulder with another couple. The privacy was terrible and it made me a bit uncomfortable. It was one of the ""busy"" nights though so was to be a bit expected. All in all. Amazing place and yes what they say is true about their cheesecake. Its god's gift to the world. Go get some if you never tried it."
Amy S.,"Long Island City, NY",0,16,7,4.0,1/15/2017,"The food was amazing, staff on the other hand (our waitress actually) was very inattentive to our table, we had to wait a while just for a glass of water. Other than that, I feel as though as far as the typical restaurant goes and how huge this menu selection is, the food isn't half bad. The Baja chicken tacos were superb, I also had the chicken samosas as an appetizer. Although they didn't taste much like samosas (an Indian appetizer) they tasted more like a fried dumpling. Still very tasty though. As for cheesecake, we always order it on the go. I love the 30th anniversary cake and I am a die hard fan of the red velvet. But the actual cheesecake is defiantly worth trying."
TS C.,"Latham, NY",24,27,19,1.0,1/31/2016,"They should really carefully check on the food chef they made! Every single time i order the same food ""angel hair with shrimp"" will came out different size and different taste! Sometime they came out only with 3-4 bite of angel hair! the manager in cheese cake doesn't know how to handle customer ! I think he's the new management!!"
Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,95,2.0,1/16/2015,"In line with all other Factory experiences, the only thing worth getting here is maybe a salad and the cheesecake. Skip the rest of the food, as it's quite blah.  Bottom line: Cheesecake only."
Xiaohan L.,"Framingham, MA",131,10,15,2.0,12/31/2015,"Our waitress politely came to us three times asking if we needed a to go box, while my entree looked/was merely touched. She did not even ask if we wanted dessert today. This is definitely my worst New Year's Eve dinner ever. Gave one more star overall because the food was 3-star food. I come for the chocolate mousse cheesecake every week."
