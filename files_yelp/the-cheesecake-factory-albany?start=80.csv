Christen G.,"Greenfield Center, NY",1,7,,2.0,7/30/2016,This place was disappointing from the start. Always a wait here (which is fine) but everything took FOREVER to bring - even drink refills. Our server was MIA for a full 20 minutes while we tried to just pay the bill and get out of there. Just meh on the food and definitely not worth the price.
James D.,"Corinth, NY",106,189,834,3.0,2/21/2015,Always super crowded and the last two times I've been there our food has been served lukewarm!   No excuse for that. Prices are high and the value isn't that good.  8 bucks for a slice of cheesecake...wow. What happened to value????
Cooper N.,"New York, NY",15,43,78,4.0,12/13/2014,"Not a bad place. I went with my girlfriend and we split an entree with an appetizer.  The appetizer - avocado, mushroom, and zucchini fries - where great and inexpensive enough. The entree - we got fish tacos - left a lot to be desired. They may have been the most tasteless tacos I've ever eaten. The side of rice and beans though where just the opposite. Seasoned and spiced and delicious.  BUT. The appetizer was good, The coffee was fantastic (and I'm a coffee snob), and the service and atmosphere where great. I actually want to give the coffee its own paragraph. I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a large glass mug. I drink it black, and I was happy to find it robust and not at all bitter. They really do coffee right, which I'm a fan of. I'll be going back but trying a different entree. The menu is gigantic so I'm rating them as I am because of the service, coffee, and selection. Keep in mind though, they are pricey.  Skip the fish tacos."
Kristen M.,"Central Manchester, CT",63,25,20,4.0,12/12/2015,BBQ chicken salad is my favorite salad that they have.  Full of flavor and enough for 2 meals.  Service was quick and the wait staff treated us well.  I would definitely go back.
Michael S.,"Burlington, VT",3,10,29,3.0,10/11/2015,"As always the atmosphere is fantastic, full of energy. Ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  A well blended taste with spicy heat.  Portion was large enough for two.   Still the wait time to sit down and order was unacceptable., thus the low rate."
Dinah W.,"Alexandria, VA",165,98,262,3.0,9/14/2014,"Walk in to this restaurant knowing you'll consume over 1, 000 calories excluding those delicious bread they offer with butter! Oh ueah, and the fountain drink you're probably going to have to wash it all down. The food is delicious, but they just can't seem to get their orange chicken right. I've ordered this exact meal more than once hoping they would get it right. But it's always bland. Don't even try eating it in the morning after saving it in the refrigerator.  It turns soggy, and what was chicken before turns to something that's all flour paste. The chicken also have a lot a gristle.  Anyone else experience this? I also don't like how close the tables are in this restaurant.  My husband and I were seated at a really small table across from the bar,  and there was hardly room for our plates and drinks, let alone a personal conversation. I think they intentionally do this to get in as much customers as they can, but it's not something I like for date nights. Better off ordering to-go."
Amanda M.,"Long Island, NY",383,796,567,4.0,7/3/2013,"Their menu is HUGE, but our waiter def gave us enough time to read over it. Even the  dessert menu. I got a blueberry mojito and it was amazing. The bread was good also. I got the Monterey Burger, medium rare, I enjoyed it, also the fries. Although they put the fires in a cup, it sure is annoying to be trying to eat a burger and it being in the way. The tables are close together, but easy enough to get in and out without bothering the other table. I don't really see why everyone raves about this place. The cheesecake was good, light and creamy, but I've had better. We also shared a piece and they actually cut a piece in half for us so we had our own plates without asking."
Miss P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,6,2.0,2/5/2017,"Seriously, this place needs to get it together. You can't make reservations until after 9:30. Their service is super slow. I had visited from NYC and had a large group. I called the restaurant and asked if we could make a reservation to avoid the wait and confusion of seating a large group of 13. I was told I could not. My group and I waited over an hour to be seated. I asked during my phone call and when I arrived if they could accommodate us being seated at one large table. The hostess told me I wouldn't be a problem. We were broken up into groups and seated in booths, which totally ruined our dinner. I spoke with the manager who acted as if he could care less about our problem. He offered a free appetizer. (Wow. That helped a lot ) The staff here is not equipped accommodate their customers. I didn't enjoy my food at all. I gave an extra star only for our waiter who was just ok. He at least tried as I can appreciate effort."
Marie D.,"Delmar, NY",11,258,217,4.0,9/8/2015,"i wish I could have a lovely dream, where I am ordering at Cheesecake factory and there are NO calories in any of the food!  I love, no LOVE, the avocado eggrolls, and most other foods they serve, but the calorie count is terrifying! SO, I have to commend this chain for coming up with a lower calorie menu that is very tasty and diverse.  I had a Skinny Mojito (140 cal) the beet salad with lemony dressing, and shared a low carb cheesecake, so was very happy with my meal and stayed within my ""Lose It!"" goal for the day.  Maybe Yelp should pair up with ""lose It!"" for a Yelp ""Delete"" weight loss squad? P.S. The low carb cheesecake was very good, but the low carb whipped cream was not.  Get the real whipped cream- it's not that many calories."
Aaswad S.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",438,43,5,4.0,1/22/2016,"I have always been loving the cheesecakes here. I mean few of the best cheesecakes Ichave ever had. Have been having Traditional, Godiva, Hershey's, Tiramisu, Red Velvet, Oreo, to name a few of my favorites. But the food isn't as awesome as I expect it to be. Chicken Samosa is one of my favorites here."
Patrick C.,"Westerlo, NY",0,10,2,2.0,3/13/2016,"Made our annual visit to The cheesecake factory this morning for some Belgium waffles w/strawberries and whipped cream.  Today we walked right in and the place is fairly empty and I'm wondering why !? We both have the same breakfast ... just like we did a year ago. I couldn't wait for those large, hot , crispy around the very edge  waffles....  What a disappointment to be served a pre made frozen , microwaved , moist in the middle,  smallish waffle.   Did I mention we were disappointed with the waffles  On a good note the place seems clean and the staff was nice."
Tanya B.,"Woodford, VT",0,3,,5.0,3/7/2017,We had Jake as our waiter!!! He was amazing!! No empty drinks. Pleasant smile and attitude!!! He got an amazing tip!!!
Nancy J.,"Huntington, NY",0,19,1,1.0,5/12/2017,"One of the WORST PLACES YOU CAN GO IN ALBANY.  IF you Go here either you have never eaten out before or have never tasted restaurant food.  AS WE WALKED IN THERE Unfortunately there WAS A FUNKY SMELL. THE CESSPOOL?! Tonight I asked for a booth to sit in.  A few minutes after sitting down I noticed A NASTY SPIDER CRAWLING OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TABLE TOWARDS US.  THEY NEED EXTERMINATION.  WE had to wait a few minutes and they moved us.  After we sat down we were served.  MY food was ICE COLD after waiting 30 minutes.  The food is SUB-PAR.  I reordered Quesadillas, which were supposed to include Chicken.  There was NONE and they were cold also.COLD FOOD NOT COOKED TO PROPER TEMPERATURE MAKES PEOPLE ILL.  VERY ILL.  THIS RESTAURANT IS A JOKE.  We asked the waitress for the bill after not eating much.  The bill was $65!  The waitress never apologized and when I asked to see the manager we were made to wait.  The Manager told me I was charged FULL PRICE for drinks even though it was still happy hour. HE said that is just for the bar area.  OUTRAGEOUS!  HE did not want to give me any money off even though the food was horrible!  AFTER EXPLAINING I was not happy to the manager I was Begrudgingly given the $12.95 off.  HE DID NOT APOLOGIZE!  OUTRAGEOUS!  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS EXPENSIVE DUMP!"
Patrick E.,"Raymond, ME",0,43,78,4.0,2/28/2017,"First time at CF. Decor --- not quite  sure what the theme is---mixed Greek and oddly english. Guess hard to match up a theme decor  to cheesecake. Went at 3 pm on a Monday and fairly quiet.  Quickly seated and drinks and bread arrived. Bread surprisingly  good. Started to read and read and read menu. 15 pages more or less. Waitress came back several times...slow reader I am. Lol. Finally decided on chicken belliginio and pasta chicken dish (lunch size) meal came within 10 minutes. Both huge portions (had rest for dinner next night) pasta well cooked...Chicken incredibly tender and flavored  well. Waitress attentive but sure could have slowed down a bit...and relaxed. Always seemed rushed even though seemed she only had 4  tables max at any time. So...main course over and time for desserts. Dozen 8f cheesecake options with another  10 is so non cheesecake options. Not the biggest fan of cc, but had a red velvet  cake cheesecake Cobo that was great. Good resturant is up front on calories...but sure is kinda if scary.  Lunch was several thousand calories."
Ann L.,"Montreal, Canada",7,5,,5.0,8/4/2016,If you are in need of fried food this is the place. Everything I tried is tasty and...fried. The mac&cheese fried balls are surprising delicious and decadent. And as for the cheesecakes well...bliss... I wonder if they will come up with fried cheesecake... Maybe they have it already and I just didn't notice it. The ambiance is great and clean and the service is extremely friendly and casual.
Niko M.,"Troy, NY",0,3,,2.0,3/10/2017,"The famed ""Fettuccini Alfredo"" had me wondering if I had gone to a different restaurant. It was bland and runny, the chicken didn't taste seasoned at all. Total disappointment. The bread was good and the cheesecake perfect which is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star."
Wanda S.,"Albany, NY",8,1,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Party of 7 Sunday after nieces graduation service was horrible. Took 4 minutes to be seated understandable graduation weekend but, it took about 15 minutes for waters and sodas to make it to the table..then after about 60 to 90 minutes later the food arrived kinda 1 person had requested no mushrooms and hers arrived with nothing but the pasta and chicken all of the vegetables were missing..mine was a no show for about 20 minutes meanwhile girl with no Vegetables returned hers this was returned with ice cold vegetables back to the kitchen it went..finally after another 15-20 minutes it was returned right...ordered cheesecake and coffees yet another 15 minutes for the cheese cake..the manager did remove the 2 messed up meals...we got there at 5:45 & did not get out of there until 9pm...never again."
Alyx N.,"Emeryville, CA",12,38,42,4.0,6/1/2015,"I've been to this location many times with friends and family and have always had a great experience, love the food selection. The portion sizes are also generous so I always end up with leftovers for lunch the next day. They do occasionally miss a few things or screw up an order though."
Krista R.,"Albany, NY",57,177,293,2.0,3/9/2016,"I generally avoid the Cheesecake Factory because it is almost always packed (not unlike the Olive Garden, which I also avoid), the food is not belly or wallet friendly, and we almost always get seated at the banquette, which I despise. I feel as if I'm eating inches away from total strangers at those dreaded tables. A large portion of the restaurant is comprised of banquette seating, too, so unless you're with a large party, this is probably where you'll end up. Having said all that, my husband and I went to TCF for dinner last night, mainly because we had received a $25 gift card through a raffle. Seated at the banquette (grrrr), we each ordered a drink from the Happy Hour menu. We had no complaints about the beverages. For dinner I ordered the country salad from the Skinnylicious menu, and subbed tomatoes for the beets. I was shocked to see that I was charged for this. I was substituting a menu item, not adding one, and it's not as if tomatoes are expensive. My husband ordered the chicken pasta and instead received chicken tacos. I guess ""pasta"" sounded like ""tacos"" to the waitress. In her defense, his voice probably could not be heard over the tremendous din in the restaurant; it is always very loud in there because of the enormously high, smooth ceilings. She offered to take it back but my husband accepted the tacos to make things easier. So, in some minor and major ways, we were not entirely pleased with our meals. It was not terrible, and it was not great. It was just lackluster, in a handful of ways. Ultimately, the Cheesecake Factory is sort of like an upscale Ruby Tuesday, but at least RT has the salad bar and has its prices under control. Unless we receive another gift card, I doubt we'll be coming back. There are just better places to go."
K R.,"West Branch, MI",0,14,3,5.0,6/23/2016,Group of 6 went just for cheesecake and we all ordered different ones and shared to try them all and each was very good and surprisingly not overwhelmingly rich.  Generous potions.  Well worth the trip!
