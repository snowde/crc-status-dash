Andrea R.,"Sundts Industrial Area, Albuquerque, NM",282,17,34,4.0,11/19/2017,"I've eaten here a variety of times. The reason what keeps me coming back is the variety of plates they offer and how delicious their food is. This time my boyfriend and I ordered ""chicken samosas"" off the skinny menu. They were seasoned chicken wrapped in a freshly fried crispy wonton served with a cilantro dipping sauce. So good!  As for entrees we always like to try something different. I ordered the fried shrimp platter and my shrimp were butterflied, lightly breaded and perfectly crispy. They were not greasy and were the BEST FRIED SHRIMP I've ever had! It came with a garlic tarter sauce, yum! The fries however were dry and over salted.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. It came with marinara and he upgraded to sweet potato fries. He was in heaven and once I took a bite of his sandwich so was I! His sweet potato fries were even saltier than mine he didn't even eat them. They were salt with a side of fries.  Every time we've been here, the service sucks! On our first date ever we came here and sat on the patio. We had an older man who made us feel like a nuisance. This time we had a middle aged woman who was really slow. She also checked on the table across from us way more than us and we felt slightly neglected. As a server, I know it can get stressful but there was barely anyone in the restaurant. And there's a way to handle things even when you can't handle it yourself.  If this place had better service it would of gotten 5 stars. (And no salty fries)"
Kaitlin J.,"Albuquerque, NM",82,6,4,3.0,1/8/2018,"First impression: I thought going on a Sunday night wouldn't be so bad as far as wait times, and when we put our name down we we're given a 15-20 minute time frame which was fine with us. We saw about 3 different couples who came in after us get seated before us. And a family of 4 who came in and within 5 minutes of waiting they were sat as well. We ended up waiting 35-45 minutes until we got seated. So that put a damper on the night so far.  Server: Once we were seated our server greeted us quickly got our drink orders, and put in our child's food. When we came back around the second time we asked him about the Crab and spinach dip he said it was amazing its not the fake crab/imitation so we said we would like to try that we also put in our main course during this time. We hadn't seen our server since we ordered our food but child's food came shortly after which was brought out by another server.Maybe after 20 minutes or so still no server our main course came out, we didn't get our appetizer and my sides were wrong on my plate. Finally our server came to check on us to make sure everything was alright I let him know about the app and the sides. I'm assuming he never put in the app because when we asked him about it he tried to play if off like ""oh well let me look into that for you."" We told him we didn't want it now but it think if we were paid attention to more this obviously wouldn't have happened. After this it seems like he was rushing us to get us out of there.  Food: Fish & Chips: More batter than fish, was okay nothing special wont be ordering again.  Fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken: Good full of flavor Kids Mac and Cheese: Very cheesy in flavor but good size portion. Overall: We will probably be back again but on a slower day than the weekends. I don't see why people like this place so much."
Breeze H.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,12,5,3.0,8/25/2017,"I give it a 3 and half stars. Atmosphere: Good: Not too many people, nice lighting with big lamp looking things coming from the ceiling, and the way the booths are set up makes the seating very intimate. Food: Good The taste of the entree was decent, but like I said, it felt like it was missing something.  Steak was succulent, mashed potatoes were chunky, the sauce was a little too much salt, and the onions for some reason were hard to eat. The Caramel Cheesecake on the other hand was off-the-hook, lots of layers of flavor and wonderful texture. It is an art form. Price: Not Great Even though you get a big portion size, and you can most likely have a meal or two (or three) I feel like that should be an option. Maybe ask if we would like like a half portion as well for us that don't want to spend $20 on a plate of spaghetti, when we might as get a damn steak. -Desert Breeze"
Diana H.,"Albuquerque, NM",139,76,136,3.0,7/24/2017,"The highlight here: KFC. No, not Kentucky Fried Chicken. Korean Fried Cauliflower! At a whopping 1,000+ calories, this small bites plate (about the size of two handfuls) might kill your diet, but not your happiness! Crispy, savory, and flavorful all-in-all. It even won the heart of my sister, who despises cauliflower. Most of the entrée plates here are on the pricier side, but worth the portion, IMO. However, on my most recent visits, I've been sticking to the appetizers and shareable plates, as the complimentary bread/butter is rather filling. The service here is either decent or iffy, depending on the day of week and time of day you're dining I guess. I came here with my family (party of 4) a while ago on Sunday night, and we had to wait so long for our entrees that we needed to flag down our waitress, who said the food was apparently sent to the wrong table. Returned with a friend a couple months later during a weekday afternoon, and we were in and out within an hour.  I'm certainly not one who would spend around $7 on a single slice of Cheesecake, but my boyfriend has unashamedly done so many times here. As their signature (hence the chain's name), they were admittedly quite tasty. I did enjoy the tiramisu cheesecake, but it didn't blow my mind, to be worth that price tag, and for such a small slice. I will, however, return for that yummy cauliflower!"
Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,220,325,4.0,7/5/2017,"Okay, so...obviously I've been to dozens of these places before. The problem was I wasn't Yelping back when I lived in Oklahoma and would frequent this place constantly every other weekend when I would drive up to the capitol. If I were, I would tell you guys that they are just as amazing as ever, regardless of which one you go to. But the experience varies based on service. The food is almost always good. Usually. Let's talk about the first night I went to the Cheesecake Factory here in the land of enchantment. I ordered the shrimp scampi, which is a bistro take on the traditional dish. Basically, it's deep fried shrimp in a scampi sauce. In this iteration, everything as far as the sauce was spot on. Unfortunately, they took the misstep of burning some of the shrimp. So I thought to myself, ""okay...everyone has a bad night. no biggie. I'll let it pass."" I mean, we were already planning on returning here our last night in Albuquerque, we love the place that much. This second visit, I was determined to try the steak diane. But I didn't want that to be the only protein I had, just in case I didn't like it for whatever reason. So I got the factory combo of shrimp scampi (almost everyone deserves a second chance, after all) and the steak diane. Firstly, I am happy to report that the scampi was MUCH better this time around. All the shrimp were cooked perfectly with nothing singed or burnt. The sauce was just like I remember it. Plus it all blended beautifully with the mashed potatoes. Yeah...the combos come with mashed and Cheesecake Factory actually makes a damn good mashed. That said, we can discuss the steak diane. It was....different for me. Took some getting used to because honestly, I have nothing else to compare it to. I've never really had a steak diane before, much less know much about it. I know that it's a recipe generally consisting of a pan seared steak of sorts, tossed in a mushroom-ish sauce with black peppercorn and onions. Only the sauce Cheesecake Factory uses is slightly sweet. Again, not quite what I was expecting. But overall, it wasn't bad. At least I had the benefit of the mashed potatoes to counterbalance the mild sweetness brought on by the sauce. The steak itself was cooked a perfect medium as requested. But you'll notice from the pic I took that they serve this steak *almost* hibachi style. That's what it reminded me of really. Most places just leave the whole piece of steak uncut. This one came in pieces. Not really a deal breaker for me; just....different. I know that some of you will probably scream bloody murder when I confess this. But no...I did not order any cheesecake either visit. The main reason being is I'm not much of a dessert guy. And even when I am, it's WAY after the fact. The thing is I just genuinely get way too full to consider dessert immediately after dinner. I mean...who, over the age of 12 that isn't female, eats dessert *immediately* after dinner? Really. Guys...my metabolism isn't what it used to be. The ultimate takeaway from all this is simple: if you happen to be in a town or near a town that has a Cheesecake Factory in it, you are absolutely CRAZY not to go! They pretty much never miss the mark when it comes to the actual recipes. The only thing that could ruin your experience would be if you got subpar service. So stop on by! It will change your life. I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory in the land of enchantment 4 big juicy scampi shrimp with no burnt pieces out of 5."
Thomas G.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,30,16,4.0,10/20/2017,"Wife and I came on a Friday night , got a quick seat at the bar. The wait to dine in the dining area was 15-30 minutes but we got lucky at the bar. I had a la cumbre Pilsner which was tasty - I was surprised to see a few local drafts on the menu of a national chain. Wife had a lemon drop and it was a little on the sweet side but still tasty. We skipped right to dinner - i had a simple green chile cheese burger which was pretty darn good. Wife had a pineapple chicken and shrimp dish. She said it was good. We skipped on the cheesecake for dessert since we were full. The cheesecake is the whole attraction and we have had them before - all of them have been tasty. Overall, service and food were solid."
Judy B.,"El Paso, TX",107,256,1067,5.0,6/18/2017,"Never fails to please this happy yelper!!  Always brace yourselves for a long period of waiting if you come during the lunch rush and ESPECIALLY dinner!! I was worried about getting a table for 2 when we got there a lil after 6pm.  My husband hates a long wait and i was craving their thai lettuce wraps again for the longest time.  To my luck, only a 30 to 40 min wait! As long as it wasnt an hour or more, he was willing to wait lol. Yay me! My ultimate weakness and what i diet for.... THE BREAD BASKET!! Ugh i could live off their bread and butter basket.  They always have a honey oat and white option and i love tearing into the honey oat.  Luckily its only half the basket so i dont become a complete gluton before my actual meal comes thru.   I always order the thai lettuce wraps and the small plate of chicken somosas.  I just cannot imagine it any other way!! Thru the years, i have tried a bunch of other options. Of course its impossible to try them all but something about the healthy choice and AMAZING flavors from these wraps that just bewitched me! And those somosas? If even my husband goes for it and yet he hates curry usually, then you got something worth while! Lol. He always has a hard time ordering stuff since he is a menu price Nazi, but he ended up choosing the French Dip with sweet potatoe fries. He was actually impressed! hallelujah! Lol  And the cheesecakes? Need i say more? Lol the only thing i suggest is order from the front counter. The slices you can get to go from there seem way bigger than ordering from the table.  Either way you do it, quality is top notch! Service is always great because thats whats expected of their staff.  I only had a few problems over the dozen times coming here so there's always a few bad apples.  Other than that, truly a worth while experience coming here.  Whether you're feeling fancy or just casual, this factory welcomes all!"
Trish S.,"Albuquerque, NM",42,49,151,4.0,12/6/2017,"It's the time of year for Team Celebrations! My manager told us we were going to lunch and then said The Cheesecake Factory and my face fell...I had been here twice before and was not impressed either time so wasn't really looking forward to our lunch. This time however I was pleasantly surprised by both the service and food!! Our waitress took care of all 12 of us by herself and our glasses were never empty, she smiled the whole time, and didn't roll her eyes when some of us struggled to figure out what to have from the very large menu. Last time I was there with a party of about 8 and the service was super slow and our waiter seriously huffed when we were a little slow in ordering. I got the Chicken Reisling this time around and it's was melt in my mouth deliciousness!! Because of our wonderful waitress (wish I had gotten her name) and the yummyness I will give them another chance without being dragged there! Hopefully they can keep this up..."
Amanda P.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,1,1,5.0,11/29/2017,Came out for an evening meal with my partner to one of my favorites restaurants the Cheesecake Factory which did not disappoint. I ordered the herb crusted filet of salmon and Despite the spider like appearance it's amazing!
Tasha M.,"Albuquerque, NM",92,51,195,4.0,9/26/2017,Went for an early dinner to avoid the crowds around 3pm. It wasn't that busy and it took about 10 min still to get a table. Our waitress was very polite and was there to answer any questions concerning food allergies of one of our guests. She also gave other recommendations to try and brought us fresh bread. The prices are a little high but the portions depending on the item are large. I got the chicken parmesan pizza it was massive but delicious. I need to visit again to try the many cheesecakes.
Carla L.,"Pasadena, CA",10,111,95,5.0,4/24/2017,My mom and I went shopping at the mall. We decided to come to Cheesecake Factory . We sat in Alexis R. area and she was a very friendly & attentive server.  Thank you for the enjoyable experience Alexis!!!
Rand R.,"Albuquerque, NM",63,422,57,4.0,11/28/2017,"A good chain restaurant in a good location. My first visit to ABQ's CF was a hit. Great service, great food quality. You really can't go wrong with anything on the extensive menu."
Myhan V.,"Rio Rancho, NM",9,76,62,3.0,11/14/2017,So excited when they opened up. Place is nice and clean. Kids friendly and good service. Foods and cheesecake is kind of overpriced.
Alayna P.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,1/8/2018,"Literally amazing. I love food hear, the cheesecake menu has so much to choose from. Go in and smell all the sweetness and fill your sweet crawings!"
John S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,7,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Wow. Unbelievable. If I could do less than one star I would.  I bought a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. I should mention that the young lady at the to go counter was sitting on the counter, the counter the orders are placed on, when I got there.  Upon arrival Home, less than an hour later, the cheesecake was stale to the point of being inedible.  I called and spoke to John the manager. I told him my issue and he started laughing. Saying he couldn't believe it could be stale.  I told him I wouldn't take time to call if it wasn't and his reply restated his position that they sell so much it couldn't be stale.  I don't take being called a liar easily so I told him I would call his boss on the morning.  When your restaurant is called Cheesecake Factory, you should at least get the cheesecake right."
Iara M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",6,21,53,4.0,1/28/2017,"My family and I went here for my birthday. My son had spaghetti and meatballs, my husband and I shared the chicken and shrimp gumbo with brown rice.  It was really delicious and perfectly spicy.  I ordered a pineapple Moscow mule that tasted like juice, I couldn't taste the vodka at all. It had very little. For dessert my son had the red velvet cheesecake, my husband had the salted caramel cheesecake and I had the ""ultrarageous Chris"" cheesecake. My son and I couldn't finish our cheesecakes, they were really rich and quite overwhelming. Next time we are going to try the plain one.  A little bit pricey but it was worth."
Ashleigh D.,"Albuquerque, NM",197,239,302,3.0,5/25/2017,"Ok, so Cheesecake Factory is one of the big chain restaurants I really like nowadays.  I know it gets busy, but the food and desserts are pretty darn good with 5 million choices as well. I came here on a Saturday night with a friend.  We had a 15 minute wait to be seated, not bad for a Saturday night at 6:30.  The first thing the waitress did when she came to the table was say how busy it was, and she looked incredibly flustered.  Um, I'm sorry, any other Cheesecake Factory, this would be considered slow. When we ordered, my friend asked if she could keep the menu to look at it for desserts.  The waitress was really pushy saying she wanted it back.  She did let us keep it for a little bit while waiting for her to come back in a few minutes.  When she did come back, she twice asked, ""Can I have the menu now?"" in a very annoyed tone.  I responded ""yes"" twice, but she didn't acknowledge me.  When I looked up, she was giving my friend a death stare and waiting for her to say ""yes.""  Apparently, I didn't count. I asked for more sourdough bread, which took a while to come out, and she dropped it on the table and quickly walked away.  We didn't even have a chance to ask for more butter.  Really?  You don't bring bread and butter? The rest of our time there wasn't as annoying, but if I ever have this person as a waitress again, I'm asking for someone else.  Good thing Cheesecake Factory has a bunch of stuff I like, or I definitely wouldn't be back."
Neil M.,"Albuquerque, NM",123,48,24,3.0,7/25/2017,"Why do people like this place so much? It's okay, but I don't think it's worth waiting 45 minutes for; well actually, I don't think any national chain is worth waiting for when you have so many great local places without a wait. Anyway, once you are eventually seated you get to sit down and read a good book; sorry I mean the menu. I think it's possible to have too many choices. Also, bring a flashlight, it gets dark at night. I love the way it is decorated, from what I could see. The food is not bad, but if you want to feel good about yourself don't read the calories. If you are on a diet with a cheat day this visit counts as 3 cheat days, sorry! :-( The Pasta Carbonara with Chicken is so good and only 2,290 calories! To be fair, if you ask the staff for a to-go box and immediately put half of your meal in it, I guarantee you will be full and still have food for lunch tomorrow. By the way, the cheesecake is awesome."
Celeste K.,"Mesa, AZ",1,56,17,1.0,12/1/2017,"Have never been here before today was going to be my first time. I was at Victoria secret and messaged my mom to get us a table. 5 mins later, I noticed my mom was having a hard time getting attention from the hostess. I went up to the hostess and asked her "" how long is the wait?"" She replies back snooty "" For however long it takes us to seat you"" My mouth dropped and I said wow you didn't have to say it like that I was only asking because I have a dr appointment so wanted to know if I would have time. I said never mind I won't eat here and I won't ever go back."
PJ U.,"Los Alamos, NM",0,51,,4.0,11/25/2017,"Had a very good experience here for dinner on Black Friday. We had a party of 5 and came in right at 5 pm. Waited less than 2 min for a table and our waitress promptly took our drink order. We've been here a few times before and has less than stellar service so I was apprehensive about returning but everyone was craving something different and CKF has a huge menu.  I am glad we came here, the service was great, our food was very good and the ambiance also nice.  We had a great time and will return soon!"
Jessica V.,"Taos, NM",1,2,5,5.0,11/18/2017,"Delicious! This place never disappoints, friendly staff and clean environment. Definitely a favorite place to visit. Love the s'mores cheesecake!"
Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,4.0,9/4/2016,"I'm gonna go against the grain here and say the Cheesecake Factory is awesome. I've been to the Albuquerque location a few times, but as a well-seasoned patron in other states, this is one of the better locations. We love coming here for appetizers and/or desserts and the service has been superb every time we've been here.  Recently, I tried the Apple Crisp which was perfect in my book! The ""crisp"" is more like cobbler served with warm, cinnamon-y apples and ice cold vanilla ice cream. Thanksgiving is around the corner and I could eat this everyday (Fall is here!). This last Friday we sat at the bar. The lady and gentleman who were there were personable and fun! You may wonder why people love eating here, when there are so many other amazing restaurants that rock Albuquerque. It's the perfect combination of service, location, variety, and setting. The menu is large, but that works for big groups. The plates are generic enough, there's nothing you can turn down...no... not even the cheesecake!"
Cecilia L.,"Albuquerque, NM",73,57,1772,4.0,12/15/2016,"Cheesecake factory is a chain restaurant that has promising arrays of delectable burgers, padta, some Asian flares and of course, large amount of variety of desserts"
Jordan F.,"Albuquerque, NM",195,53,38,5.0,1/19/2017,We went on our first date night in a LONG time and decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted by our server who rushed to get our order in to make the happy hour prices! The food was incredible and the prices were even better. I would definitely recommend their happy hour to anyone! Great food and drinks at great prices!
Laura P.,"Riverview, FL",1,64,20,3.0,3/23/2017,"I so want to give 5 stars but it's just not possible. We decided to order to go so we called the main number to place our order. It took over 15 minutes just for someone to pick up the phone, and we were calling around 330.....so once they finally answered the phone we placed our order.  We ordered the Buffalo blasters and pot stickers for appetizers. I ordered the spicy chicken Chipotle pasta and my husband ordered the jambalaya. The girl on the phone asked if we wanted lunch or dinner portions and we ordered dinner. We ordered extra orders of bread and 2 slices of cheesecake.  The girl was fast coming out curbside with our food and was nice. Once we looked at our order though things were clearly wrong. They did not give us the extra bread and our portions were lunch size yet they charged us for dinner size. My pasta had maybe 3 chicken nugget sized pieces of chicken. Don't get me wrong it tasted amazing but it was extremely disappointing when you pay good money for a messed up order. Clearly they need to improve curbside and correctly making orders."
Yvonne D.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,19,1,4.0,10/22/2017,"Came here for dinner with a friend. Pretty busy, but said it would be about 20-40min. which was fine because we were able to run into the mall and shop for things and look around. After 30min. we returned and got seated 5min. later. We sat outside in the patio area and it was quite chilly out, but with the heat lamps, it was quite comfortable. I even took my jacket off. Service was good and the food was descent. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi which was not bad. Good portions. I had to take the rest of my food home. I was actually really excited that they had their pumpkin cheesecake, my favorite. I like the more NY style Cheesecake, which is more dense. The CF cheesecake is more light, but they only carry the pumpkin in the fall, so I couldn't miss out. Good ambiance and sitting outside wasn't too loud, so it was a pretty enjoyable evening."
Cassidy L.,"Columbia Falls, MT",106,325,740,5.0,11/2/2016,"Just like other quality Cheesecake Factories around the country. I'm certainly impressed with the high standards this place offers on a consistent basis. It's never failing and ever strong.  I love their Long Island ice teas. And avocado egg roll thingys.  I love the chicken biscuits, despite its overwhelming white people taste. My little guy loved it too.  The service was exceptional as always. These guys are trained beyond your imagination could ....imagine.  I love the rye bread and butter. Don't forget you need a pad of butter per piece of bread.  You can not go wrong with dessert. Move out da way Flying Star. Cheesecake Factory still has THE BEST dessert."
Josh B.,"Santa Fe, NM",9,18,,5.0,9/22/2017,Really good food they have a lot to choose from on the menu staff ideally nice and friendly and sweet!!
Laurel S.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,32,18,4.0,7/9/2017,"We had a super great lunch here yesterday, although I have been trying to save money for our credit card.  But O M G, it was well worth every penny.  But D. wouldn't let me get my usual--spaghetti and meat balls. Instead I got the green chile cheese burger.  It was cooked absolutely perfectly. And the flavor was really good, as if it was ground NY strip steak.  Chile good.  Bun good.  French fries - good.  Service - friendly, thorough, professional!!! D. Had mashed potatoes which were to die for, asparagus, but I can't remember what his main dish was.  But the bill was pretty reasonable for such good food and what atmosphere! I almost don't want more people to come here! It is that good. One of the best places in A. At least come here for your birthday. Save up!"
Lisa H.,"Albuquerque, NM",26,32,86,2.0,10/18/2016,"Okay, the Cheesecake Factory has good food, but here's a little about my experience when I went there earlier this semester.  The service was not great! Worthy of a $1 tip kind of horrible. My friend and I went recently and we were seated just fine. However, when drink orders came around the server forgot her drink. Not a huge deal, but his service just got worse. He hardly checked on us. At one point I had to ask a bus boy for the side of honey mustard I had asked for that he had forgotten. We had to wave down other waiters for our check and refills. He was just neglectful. To top it off, my friend noticed him counting his tips while we waited for refills and her salad and my side. It's one thing to be slammed, it's another to just be a bad server. And I can speak from experience, as I have been a server. I really only give such abysmal reviews if the service is bad! They get 2 stars just because he wasn't rude, at least.  Overall, you will get your typical Cheesecake Factory food with terrible service."
Mercedes M.,"Albuquerque, NM",21,16,,4.0,10/20/2017,"Went in on a Monday night, was quite empty. Walked in was seated right away, ordered something to drink then ordered dinner. Waiter was friendly and helpful, I believe his name was Nicholas. Got the check and left! The food was great was a bit greasy maybe because it was pasta. Overall was a good experience!"
Annie P.,"Albuquerque, NM",94,126,11,1.0,5/5/2017,$9 for a puny slice of cheesecake???  Really?  It wasn't even worth it.  Tasted like Costco cheesecake but with more sugar.  Service was okay but there was some confusion as to what we ordered so having our food getting passed back and forth from the kitchen wasn't an ideal start to eating.  Not returning.
Andres V.,"Tulsa, OK",0,2,2,1.0,7/22/2017,"This was the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Our server Michael was absolutely terrible. He was very rude, when we needed something he wasn't around at all.  They took about 15 minutes just to bring out our WATERS and when they brought out our WATERS  there was a cup that was just filled up with ice no water. Also when they brought out our bread it wasn't fresh. the bread was VERY cold. I had to use the restroom and it was so disgusting that I couldn't use it. There was no toilet paper there was paper towels all over the floor also there was poop on the seat. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
marlene L.,"Albuquerque, NM",33,8,1,1.0,10/3/2017,"I gave it 1 star because of the food and the size of the restaurant ..i ordered fried mac and cheese... to much cheese and not enough mac..and I ordered a margarita pizza it was dry and tasteless ...i couldn't even give it away..  I think that your menu is so large that, I think is impossible for to perfect your dishes. I think in this case,  less would be better."
Bella B.,"Albuquerque, NM",420,312,8056,5.0,2/26/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory lives up to its expectations as always, exceptional corporate food and definitely is a standout to me in comparison to all the other corporate chains that I will not  frequent, but The Cheesecake Factory is the only one that is always my exception. Fresh Food, Friendly Service and modern swanky decor.  Anthony our server was friendly & attentive, and yes it was the the Opening day and it was very hectic. I know some people were frustrated about the service and wanna complain about this & that but this a fresh newly opened business and when people who dont even bring there ""A"" game from appropriate attire, to manners, to proper vocabulary....... have some couth..... and some respect as they are working through the kinks but most important stimulating our economy in the Q. Avocado Egg Rolls is always a must and but of course a slice or two of Cheesecake LVE has me every time."
Victoria H.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,23,12,5.0,5/18/2017,"Perfect place, time, and service for lunch. Our server was very attentive and made sure everything was great every few minutes. From the cucumber lemonade and cucumber mojito, the stuffed mushrooms, and the entrees with salad and pizza and lemon garlic shrimp everything tasted soooo good. Everything was paced perfectly and service was phenomenal. We sat on the patio and even though it was a little chilly they made sure the heaters were on to make it comfortable for us. Definitely returning soon."
Jennifer M.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,65,73,1.0,3/7/2017,"Been here a few times and have yet to figure out why everyone says this is such a good restaurant.  Our last trip there seals the deal for why we won't be back again. Friday night, after waiting for a table we finally sit down. First, they're ""out of beer""--something about being out of CO2.. they're also out of the artichoke appetizer. The server said it's because they got a bad shipment last month and they haven't had them since, which I then posit the question ""you only order fresh produce once a month?!""  Ordered the crab dip appetizer and waited to order entrees. We specifically told the server we wanted to enjoy our appetizer before the entrees. Even after waiting to order entrees, our appetizer was out only 2 minutes before they flung entrees onto our table as well. I suppose that was a good thing because we had no appetizer plates and had been eating the bread using our menus as plates beforehand. Asked for another bread basket from the food runner that never arrived. Asked for more toast for the crab dip appetizer that took another 15 minutes so the dip was cold by the time that came out.  Now on to the entrees-- chicken pasta my friend ordered tasted as if they spilled a cup of sugar on top. The salad, which I had added chicken to came out with a cold leftover-looking piece of dried up chicken. So we don't cook the chicken fresh to order. Oh but they were able to microwave it up for me to dry it out even more than it already was--how swell.  At the end of our meal we asked about desserts but made sure to ask what they were out of first; which I believe it was 3 cheesecake flavors. Mentioned again how crazy it was they didn't have beer on a Friday night to our server who then said ""oh yeah they fixed it"" --Awesome, would've been great to know that so we could've ordered one.  The food quality is low, the servers aren't trained properly, and there's little reason to come back when with all the mishaps not one manager seemed to be on the floor putting out the fires. Not impressed."
Reese S.,"Tucson, AZ",58,87,13,2.0,3/9/2017,I've been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants in different states. This one I will have to say is the worse when it comes to customer service.  I called an order in for take out. Once I got there is was directed to go to the area for take out. There were 2 employees there behind the chessecake counter. They both saw me but neither one of them acknowledged me. So after a few minutes had passed. I got her attention and told her I was the re rot pick up an order. Her response was the cashier stepped away and should return soon. So after waiting again for another 10 mins. The cashier finally showed out. Since I was about 2 seconds from walking out the door.  This location needs to train their employees to acknowledge customers even if you can't help them.
Alicia L.,"Albuquerque, NM",8,79,56,3.0,4/28/2017,I feel this place is over priced and the food is just okay. Desert is good but not great. Also be prepared to be here a while at least an hour or two.
James W.,"Rio Rancho, NM",21,13,2,1.0,1/29/2017,"First off I will say that this is my wife's favorite restaurant, and we have been several times before with great service.  So here's where it gets bad.   1. Was given the mandatory pager and a 15 minute wait.  After 35 minutes I asked the hostess the status and she said she realized she gave us the wrong pager, hence reason why 6 groups were sat before our party of 3.  2. After being sat we waited 15 more minutes for our server Brian to get our drinks etc.  And 45 minutes for our food.  3. Food was horrible, and tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave.  Server messed up order 2x.  4. They were Out of wife's favorite dessert. (isn't this the ""cheesecake factory?"").  So overall I was very upset with many aspects of this visit.  The only reason i didn't complain was that my wife didn't want me to cause a scene.... She's more compassionate having worked in the restaurant industry."
