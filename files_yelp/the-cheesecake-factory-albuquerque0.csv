Terri D.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,3,,2.0,8/16/2016,Poor service. I  went during lunch it wasn't too packed yet had poor  service. The food was mediocre. Was very disappointing.
Nico S.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,2,,1.0,3/25/2016,"Don't bother.  They make people line up around the building for no legitimate reason, they do not open the door inside the mall, and they have incorrect signage.  You are better off cooking at home, or hitting up a McDonalds.  To add insult to injury, the staff is clueless and rude.  It is not worth it."
Cat B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,2.0,3/19/2016,"Ok, I know this place just opened, but really!  Came here at 5:00 with my family.  Wait was quoted at 2 hours.  Decided to just get cheesecake to go, and eat dinner elsewhere.   Stood in line at the counter for 40 minutes just to place a to-go order of cheesecake.  Then was told I'd have to wait another 30 minutes to get my order.  Waited the 30 minutes and then could not get to the counter to pick up my order.  Counter was being blocked by hoardes of people.  What type of system is this?  People swamping the counter, pushing and shoving.  An hour and a half of my time and $40 later, I squeezed my way out.  Cheesecake was good, though.  We do live our chain restaurants in Albuquerque!"
Lois R.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,5,,2.0,4/8/2016,"I don't usually write a review but feel compelled to today. I ate there at lunch today with two coworkers. Although the line was long, it didn't take too long to get in (about 20 min).  When we finally got it, we had a choice of the bar high top or the patio (it was a cold and windy day).  We went with the high top.  After a bit of waiting for food, a regular table opened up close to us. We asked to be moved and were promptly told 'no.'  We just got our food and the waitress wanted to take the bread, we said 'no.'  I asked for a doggie bag for my soup and she said she would box it. She started to pick up the bowl by sticking her finger down in it and realized she shouldn't do that but piled dirty dishes on the plate as she took it off the table.  She also reached over my coworkers dish and almost put her arm in her food. The manager never came around to tables to see how folks were doing.  I was not impressed.  I won't be back."
Carrie B.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,21,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"After waiting for over an hour to be seated we were met with a kind but overly harried server who, though she tried hard, really needed more training.  Her effort is the only reason why this Cheesecake Factory earned any rating whatsoever from us.  The food was absolutely, positively disgusting and we really do eat anything.  I honestly believe that there's less salt in the Dead Sea than there was in our appetizers and main courses and this rendered the meal inedible.  We did not stay for dessert since, one, the place was packed and there was an overall sense of lingering not being welcomed and, two, we didn't particularly wish to linger as we were hungry for something edible.  If you're looking for a crowded, rushed environment, frantic waitstaff, and remarkably awful yet expensive food, this Cheesecake Factory has you covered on all aspects.  For their sake, I do hope the cheesecake is good, but I can't recommend and won't return."
michelle s.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,26,7,2.0,2/23/2016,"Stop overrating ABQ.  Yes, it's exciting to get a new name in the Q, but the food is simply average.  Service at this point is nice because country wide trainers are here for the hiring expo.  Hopefully the locals will remember the training."
Richard A.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,20,1,1.0,3/27/2016,"We've been twice since The Cheesecake Factory opened in Albuquerque.  The first time, we waited over an hour to get in and once in, service was bad.  Because the restaurant just opened, we gave the bad service and wait time a pass.  But after being opened for over a month now, we decided to try the CCF again.  This time, we waited 30 minutes to get in and the service was HORRIBLE.  We waited 20 minutes after being seated at our table before a waitress (Kaitlyn or Caitlyn) showed up to get our drink order.  It took her 10 minutes more to bring us our drinks. During the course of the meal, our glasses were empty, and stayed empty.  The waitress passed our table several times and ignored the fact that they were empty.  The food took 20 minutes from order time to table time.  I got the fish and chips and the fish was mealy and chewy.  This tells me the fish wasn't fresh.  It was not very good at.  We had fried Zucchini as an appetizer. The appetizer was cold.  How can an appetizer be cold?  This place with it's high prices needs to vastly improve if they want to stay in business.  Our waitress was so bad that after we finished eating, we waited 20 more minutes before we got our check and another 10 minutes for her to return our credit card.  Drink glasses were empty most of the meal. It was a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."
Lisa S.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,5,,5.0,7/24/2016,"in and out of there is no time, was totally impressed for picking up two slices of cheesecake for desert at dinner."
Josh J.,"Albuquerque, NM",49,8,1,2.0,3/14/2016,"I realize the Cheesecake Factory is new to town, but they could do a better job to accommodate the crowds wanting to try something new. I wasn't that thrilled to go there in the first place having been in other states, but a large group of us wanted to try it out for someone's birthday so I obliged. Two of us arrived early to reserve a spot for 10 people, and we were told we needed a manager's approval for groups of that size, so I was pulled out of the line to wait. Meanwhile, they are accepting names for other parties pushing us further and further down the list. A manager eventually came up to us and told us it would be 2.5 to 3 hours for a group of 10. When we asked why they didn't accept reservations, the manager told us it was because guests waiting in line get mad when they see empty tables being reserved for other guests. Hmm, I wonder how other restaurants get away with it? Perhaps they don't have long lines of guests waiting and getting mad because they accept reservation for large parties to begin with. I may give Cheesecake another try, but it will be after a long, long period of time to let the newness wear off."
Shanna T.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2016,"The hostess was incredibly snotty and short tempered with my brother in law when we went to put our name in for waiting for a table. (I feel she judged him based on his clothing at the time...it was so terribly rude that I have never seen a potential customer treated this way in a very long time) She refused to let us put our name in, refused to give us a beeper for the wait and told us it would be ""over 2 hours"" to even be put on the waiting list that evening. When I got there, he and I went back to ask her a question about waiting, she obviously ignored us standing there and seemed to be talking to some personal friends instead. We decided to just grab some cheese cake while we were there and head home. (And also noticed that the wait line wasn't nearly at ""over 2 hours"" capacity and many many booths and tables were in fact sitting empty!) Wait staff screaming  ""out of the way"" at customers as they were moving cakes to the counter. Children in the line to buy cake were touching orders left on the counter. Pushing and shoving, absolute chaos the whole time...almost took 45 minutes for 4 slices of cake to go! I probably won't go back...being THAT rude to a potential customer is just unacceptable no matter what the circumstances."
Walt L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,41,27,1.0,3/1/2016,"This is an update to my earlier review, I should have exercised better judgement and not eaten the meal my server delivered, I puked my guts out later that evening. Today is Tuesday, I puked so hard my sides are still sore. Eating at this location is hazardous to your health."
Liz D.,"Cedar Crest, NM",0,5,,2.0,7/13/2016,"The food is just as good as other CF's, but this location has the worst service of any I've been to... really of any restaurant. Make sure you have at least 2 hours to devote to your lunch or dinner. Even without appetizers or dessert, you'll be here for that long. Has happened to us 4 times in a row now. I am not excited to go back."
Mystery K.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,11,1,5.0,5/12/2016,"We went yesterday evening; the wait wasn't bad at all (party of 4), our server was extremely nice, and the food was good! Cheesecake to go was convenient (:"
Justin H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,1.0,4/1/2016,"Food was ok, but it took nearly 4 hours for lunch, and the bill was over $100 for 4 people.  Won't be going back anytime soon...."
David P.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,1,5.0,2/19/2016,"I was fortunate to be able to go and eat before they open to the public, and I cannot believe how great it was.  The limited menu they offered was still bigger than a lot of restaurants total menu.  The portions are humongous!!!  From the appetizer to desert, my wife and I were unable to finish.  One could think that the quality would suffer with giant proportions, but it was all top quality, best food I have had in a long while.  The staff was great to a fault, even though it was chaotic due to training. When they open, GO, you will not be sorry!!!!"
Allan R.,"Las Cruces, NM",0,6,1,2.0,4/25/2016,"Food was alright, overpriced but comes in very large portions. Also, thanks for the food poisoning! It's too bad that chicken fettuccine Alfredo  didn't taste as good coming out as it did going in. What a great way to spend my 20th birthday! The servers were very polite and well attending tho!"
Juan L.,"Estancia, NM",0,23,,2.0,5/27/2016,"We went with a party of five on a weekend without a reservation. Don't do that! It took over an hour to be seated. The food was average at best. It took forever to get to us and didn't taste all that good. It was very expensive too. I can think of better places to eat for the money. The cheesecake was great, but I'll never eat anything but that there again."
Janet R.,"Edgewood, NM",0,3,,4.0,6/10/2016,"I was quite pleased with the service.  Colton was our server; he was attentive and went out of his way to meet our needs.  He even apologized for the lengthy wait, which was beyond his control Also, the food was good. My husband, daughter, and I enjoyed ourselves."
James S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,26,,3.0,5/14/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country. Consistent quality is the norm with a large selection of items. The new Albuquerque location is no different. But, the value could be better. You can get a better rib eye steak at the local Monte Carlo restaurant on west Central. Locally established restaurants of Monte Carlo's quality are my preference for good eating and beat national chains like CF often."
Jacob H.,"North Valley/Los Ranchos, Albuquerque, NM",0,9,9,5.0,4/1/2016,"Great waitress, amazing food. A new favorite restaurant."
