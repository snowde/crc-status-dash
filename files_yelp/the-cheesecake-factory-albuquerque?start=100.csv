Tracia H.,"Eastside, Albuquerque, NM",22,54,102,5.0,10/22/2016,"Amidst the few negative reviews let's take a moment to acknowledge that 50% of the experience is the service and 50% is the food. I have been to this location twice and they gave both been positive.  My latest visit our server was Joe G. We were seated at our table with no service for 3-5 minutes initially but I'm ok with that. I like to be able to look at the drink menu before being pounced on. He arrived at our table with a smile and quickly took our drink orders. Mai-Tai for a friend. Classic Mojito for me. Water with lemon all around. My Mojito was on point. Delish. My friend said he wished his Mai-Tai was more fruity than he was given but I didn't taste it so I can't judge on that.  Joe brought our basket of assorted breads and we placed our orders. One Jambalaya, one chicken and biscuits, one veggie burger and i had the Asian chicken lettuce wraps. I did not taste off of anyone's plate but my own but I will say that my lettuce wraps were crisp and fresh and yummy. I had the veggie burger in my previous visit and it was very flavorful. Same reviews were given by my friend on this visit with her veggie burger. My husband loved his chicken and biscuits. Just his kind of meal. Hearty and hot. Now my friend that ordered the jambalaya orders this same dish every time he comes to Cheesecake Factory. I think he dreams about it at night. It is by far his absolute favorite. I don't know why he even looks at the menu.  Of course we rounded out the meal with cheesecake. Always fantastic but then again they are the Cheesecake Factory! Joe G did an awesome job with serving us.  Our water glasses never ran low and we felt very well taken care of. He was very attentive when our bread basket ran low and very accommodating with our request to be provided wheat bread only. Their wheat bread is mouth watering!  That's what I dream about at night!"
Anonymous Z.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,35,,2.0,1/22/2017,"Really not sure what all the fuss is about, it's honestly just another chain restaurant.  I have been  here twice and not really wild about the food.  My suggestion, go there for dessert and skip the food.  Oh and be prepared to wait, it doesn't matter if it's a week day or weekend you might have to wait up to 70 minutes."
Anneliese E.,"Eastside, Albuquerque, NM",31,92,7,4.0,4/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is massively hyped, usually in connection to thousand plus calorie meals. So when they came to ABQ, I gave it a month and then went twice in a week, once with the family and once with a work friend.  It was honestly better than I expected. The weekend visit with my husband and son was mixed, as we got shuttled out to a heated patio on a cold, drizzly Saturday. Service was quick, if not terribly polished. I got a burger, my husband got chicken Parm sandwich, and my son got pizza. Burger was surprisingly good, and my husband and son both demolished their lunch as well. Soda refills were sporadic, and honestly it was a half-step above Chili's. Good but not worth the work of standing in line and shivering on the side patio.  The second time was much better, on a noon lunch. My friend had the club salad and I had the ahi tuna salad. Really tasty and fresh, and we had better seats by the bar. The cheesecake is FABULOUS (it was my friend's birthday so we had to indulge!) We got a variety with caramel on top and finished very last bite. Service was better, too.  So averaging a 3 star experience with a 4.5 gives Cheesecake Factory a rounded 4 stars. I highly recommend going on an off time. Just not worth it otherwise. I don't see this becoming a regular hangout, but I won't refuse an invite."
Rachael T.,"Albuquerque, NM",61,100,178,5.0,3/2/2016,"It's pretty exciting to see a franchise from California finally coming to Albuquerque! Very well known for their variety of cheesecakes, bread, huge portions, upscale decor, and drinks. Now I don't feel too bummed when I see my Cali friends enjoying their meals and cheesecake positing on social media. Feels nice to enjoy Cheesecake Factory once again! Since this is the first one in New Mexico and people complaining about it's a two hour wait. It's expected and they have employees from other states helping the Albuquerque employees get on their A-game. Give it a couple of months and surely every waiter/waitresses will know mecca of Cheesecake Factory by heart. It's very well worth the wait and yes you will need to order another cheesecake with you the go. No judgements it's just how midnight snacking is done right! :)"
Wynne C.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,8,2,5.0,12/3/2016,Came here for our daughter's 16th birthday. Food was great. Louie (manager) and Miranda (server) were awesome!!
Kristie A.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",55,240,166,5.0,3/1/2016,I will admit I was skeptical when we decided to come dine but we had a gift card so here we are. Upon entering the restaurant is beautiful and the line for cheesecake is long. To our surprise the bar has a Happy Hour from 4-6 so we decided to have a seat. Service was outstanding and the happy hour menu was generous with diverse choices for anyone's palate.  The avocado egg rolls were amazing! We finished with the Kahlua cheesecake which was the perfect ending to a delightful experience at a corporate establishment.
Thomas M.,"Albuquerque, NM",17,9,7,5.0,2/22/2016,"Attended the mock service on Friday February 19, 2016.  the restaurant is beautiful inside and out.  The owner of all The Cheesecake Factories was in attendance and was mingling with everyone. The buffalo wings were delicious for an appetizer.  I ordered the new to the menu, shrimp sandwich. It was huge and very delicious. My wife had the Sheila's salad and that was also huge and delicious!  We shared a vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert. Best cheesecake i have ever eaten.  I'm very happy The Cheesecake Factory finally came to Albuquerque, NM.  Totally recommend it!!"
Mara M.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,17,4,5.0,7/2/2016,"Honestly, I didn't come here expecting to be wowed. The last time I ate at a Cheesecake Factory, I felt it was overrated. But (!) this experience was great. Service was exceptional. I had the chicken piccata and it was delicious. Later, I had the key lime cheesecake, which was sinfully excellent. Yes, a bit pricey, but I expected that."
Krystle P.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,32,71,4.0,9/27/2016,"I'll start off by saying if you don't have any patience for waiting I highly suggest you save cheesecake factory for another time.  After some shopping me and my girlfriend decide to eat at cheesecake factory because cheesecake!  We knew we would be waiting awhile which wasn't a big deal.  We got our buzzer and sat outside and chatted.  Our wait time was 25-40 minutes.  Not a big deal we came knowing this.  As time went on it seemed though like we would never be called.  At one point we contemplated going elsewhere but decided since we've stuck it out almost 40 minutes it would seem like a waste of time to leave.  At exactly 40 minutes our buzzer went off.  Thank goodness because my tummy was screaming at me! We were sat at a table in the bar area which was nice because it was Saturday night and I got to watch college football. We ordered some appetizers and my girlfriend had a beer while I had just water.  When out waitress came and took our dinner order I orders  I ordered pasta with mushrooms and veggies and my girlfriend ordered a veggie burger.  At this point our waitress asked how she wanted it cooked and we both looked at each other like ummm all the way thank you and my girlfriend said isn't it fully cooked? The waitress said well I think there is still meat in it at which point we both stared at her like excuse me?! We both told her its a veggie burger there shouldn't be any meat in it at all.  Our waitress then picked up the menu just to make sure.  She said og your right, I'll put your order in and have your food out.  After she left we had to sit and think about what she just said.  I'm just saying its a veggie burger not a veggie and meat burger.  She was a nice girl bit the fact that you don't know that simple is kind of a let down.  Although she was very attentive to us that was her only flaw.  We both and cheesecake and I also had a hot chocolate.  As always the cheesecake was amazing, I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which was amazing!!! The hot chocolate was also chocolatly and delish!  Our expierence was good and we will be back again!"
Jennifer L.,"Midtown/University, Albuquerque, NM",1,40,2,2.0,4/24/2016,"Beautiful space, good servers, yummy cheesecake, mediocre food. All in all not worth the price. Cheddars is a better choice for my dollars!"
Bobby K.,"Albuquerque, NM",107,29,74,4.0,3/10/2016,"Been to cheesecake factory in cali and in phoenix so the expectation is always high and this cheesecake factory didnt disappoint....great atmosphere...got to sit outside under some heat lamps and fires burning...great great ambience.

Ryan G.,"Albuquerque, NM",82,12,1,5.0,2/23/2016,"Beautiful restaurant, with the same massive menu that they're known for. If possible, ask for Jessica, she's hilarious and such a great server even at the end of a hectic opening day. Also, ask about the Georgia Peach. It's great."
Teri N.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,15,1,5.0,11/1/2016,"One of my top favorite places in town (for a chain).  We have had excellent waitstaff and wonderful food.  And who can't beat those deadly cheesecakes?  Haven't tried a single one yet that we don't care for.  Reese's Peanut Butter is still our favorite.  Drinks (adult) are tasty, food is divine.  Patio for people watching and taking in the fresh air.  What is not to like about this place (except for the wait to get a table sometimes!)"
Rich B.,"Albuquerque, NM",41,23,32,4.0,3/7/2016,"Albuquerque is so fortunate to finally get a Cheesecake Factory! Absolutely my favorite restaurant. I hear complaints about the wait but that is to be expected. Once things settle and the staff gets accustomed it will be better. I have never had a bad meal here. And trust me, that is a lot of meals at Cheesecake Factories across the country."
Ashley M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,1,3.0,11/14/2016,"Food is always great at The Cheesecake Factory, no matter what location you visit. However, Albuquerque has this amazingly unique talent to destroy the image and standards that major chains, such as The Cheesecake Factory, Nordstrom Rack and Ruth's Chris steakhouse, just to name a few, work so hard to achieve.  The service. The quality of people hired.  You can shine a penny over and over and over again but that sh*t will never be a dime.  Suggestions: staff, loose all attitudes. Hold yourself to a higher standard. Try to look like you belong working at a high end restaurant not hookin' on Central. Don't come to work high. Always respect your guests because they are the people that pay your rent! Don't be easily irritated. Move with purpose!  If you go, just be prepared to have the average Albuquerque service experience with top notch food. Maybe tip the cooks instead of the crappy servers."
Rubj Q.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,1,5.0,11/13/2016,Great service and great food! This place is amazing! It is always worth the wait. The prices are a tad bit high but it's what is expected from such a nice place.
Kevin F.,"Albuquerque, NM",42,9,6,4.0,5/14/2016,"A little bit of a wait for a large party and no reservations, but: Food . . . Good; cheesecake . . . Good; drinks . . . Good.  I got the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection."
Dennis O.,"Placitas, NM",0,5,,5.0,5/13/2017,"My wife and I have been here a couple of times. The servers have been nothing short of wonderful. The food has been outstanding every time we go. One of my favorites are the carne asada steak medallions. Really delicious, as are the chicken tacos. Looking forward to our next visit."
Andrea H.,"Albuquerque, NM",51,68,4,3.0,7/31/2016,"I've been here several times since they opened, and overall, the food is good, but not amazing, and despite the large portions of some of their entrees, it's too expensive for what it is.  The main draw is of course, the cheesecake, which is delicious, and they have a huge selection, which is great.  The service can be hit or miss, though, and the last time we went as well as tonight, it was way below par.   We had a gift certificate so we chose to eat here for dinner tonight, and I hate to say the overall experience was disappointing.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad for this place, but it took longer than it should have for a server to greet us and take our drink order once we were seated.  When the server brought our drinks, we asked to have a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat because their menu is so large, but our server disappeared for a really long time before returning.  We also had to ask for sweetener for the iced tea as it wasn't on the table and wasn't brought out with the drinks.  We were never offered any bread, even though all of the tables around us had bread.  We thought our server had gone to get some after taking our order, but she never came back with any, and our food came before we had the chance to ask for some, and by then we didn't want any.  Our food was delivered by someone else, who also had to bring us silverware, as there was none already on the table.  I had a late lunch, so I ordered an appetizer for my meal.  I've done this a few times here, as most of the appetizers are pretty filling on their own and less expensive than the entrees.  I ordered the chicken potstickers, which are listed at $10.95 and I expected to be as substantial as some of the other appetizers I've had, but I was shocked to receive a plate with FIVE potstickers.  They were actually really good, and I know they are meant as an appetizer and not a full meal, but I didn't think the price was justified.  My husband got the bang bang chicken and shrimp, which he said was good, and there was a fair amount of chicken and shrimp, but it was mostly a large pile of rice and sauce, and cost $18.95.  Our iced teas were never refilled once during our meal despite our empty glasses.  It wasn't until we were finished with our meals and our server asked if we wanted the dessert menu that she offered a refill on tea.  She came back a long while later with the menus, but no tea.  We politely reminded her as she went to put our cheesecake order in about the iced tea, which we then received.  The cheesecake was definitely the highlight of the meal, as always (it's called the Cheesecake Factory for a reason, after all), but for a full meal, I just can't justify the expense for average food and lack of service.  I did give three stars overall instead of two because of the dessert.  In the future, I will be more inclined to come for dessert only instead of a full meal."
Travis C.,"Albuquerque, NM",13,2,3,5.0,2/24/2016,Amazing! Food was very tasty and came out fast. Not bad considering I waited 90 minutes which is fine and I didn't  mind specially for day 2 of being open. Waitress was very good and nice and management was great. Very clean! Will be returning soon.
