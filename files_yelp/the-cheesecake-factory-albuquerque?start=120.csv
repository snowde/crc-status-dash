Hellen F.,"Albuquerque, NM",23,46,30,5.0,7/17/2016,I have always heard great things about the Cheesecake Factory but never had the privilege to try it. So when I heard that one was opening up in Albuquerque I got a little excited  so going in I had high expectations and I must say I'm not disappointed.
Gregory R.,"Corrales, NM",12,4,,3.0,10/25/2016,"This was my first time in the cheesecake factory in albuquerque. I ordered and received a green chilie cheese burger. It was cooked exactly right and tasted fine.  My question is, how can you serve frozen French fries with a burger like that. That ruined the plate.  The atmosphere suggests higher end food but you serve frozen fries. Not difficult to serve fresh fries....bummer..."
Teresa M.,"Bernalillo, NM",0,21,1,5.0,4/24/2016,Gluten-Free - YES!! My best friend and I went to go visit the cheesecake factory in Albuquerque. They're gluten-free free menu is amazing and their food was generous in portion and absolutely delicious!!  Five-Stars!!!
Jonathan M.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,6,,3.0,7/30/2016,"I have been here twice now and both times have been sat away from other people. Both times I had my service dog with me. He has a vest with proper identification. Thanks for making your disgust towards my service dog even more obvious. It's hard enough having a disability, but then to get isolated because of it just turns the knife. At least your food was very good. Please improve your training with ADA"
Sonya B.,"Albuquerque, NM",80,58,244,1.0,6/14/2016,"I have a confession to make. I am a server myself and I considered applying here. Dodged that bullet because I really hate disappointing people. You know how people say, ""KILL IT WITH FIRE!"" when they see a large, hairy, evil spider or something equally repulsive? That's how I feel when I think of The Cheesecake Factory. I was so excited when I heard they would be opening up a Cheesecake Factory here in Albuquerque. I have been to one in Seattle and both the food and service were great. Absolutely not the case here. I've tried this place three times and the only thing that has been consistent is the cheesecake. And that's because it's not even made here. Service sucks, food sucks. Very slow. Twice we waited for a very long time to even be acknowledged at our table. We told our waitress we needed one more minute with the menu and she didn't return for 20 minutes!! She literally showed up one minute prior to when we said we were just going to get up and leave. Ordered nachos and they were cold. Boyfriends pasta tasted like it was boiled in chlorine/swimming pool water. He had to send it back one time because it was absolute mush. My spaghetti was BEYOND salty. The kind of salty that left us both gasping for water. I have never in my life sent a plate of food back, but we both had to do that here. I do like the macaroni and cheese burger but it is very salty as well. This place is overhyped and overpriced. I will only return for to-go cheesecake."
Mallika H.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,17,7,1.0,5/21/2016,"The most racist and disorganized establishment ever. Waited in line and was so excited on Saturday, May 21 2016 @11:30 am.  We were the first one to sit in the patio, but waitress continued to ignore us for 15 mins and took orders from every other table that came after us and I still stayed patient until it was obvious. The only difference that they happened to be Caucasian. When you charge  outrageous prices for basic food, invest a little class in treating your customers with some respect. Nobody should be purposely made to feel so disrespected. I eat out a lot and this is one restaurant that will never be a place I come back to. Take your greedy racist attitude and get out of my town where we live in harmony and treat everybody with respect regardless of their race. It's a community built with loving minorities and Cheesecake factory does not fit in here."
Kim I.,"Albuquerque, NM",8,108,96,3.0,8/24/2016,Emmitt was our server this afternoon and I was very impressed with his professionalism.  The food was tasty but I can't help but wonder why they need 22 pages of items? We sat outside and I was glad as the noise inside is a bit too much for me.
Chris K.,"Farmington, NM",1,31,43,3.0,10/13/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory isn't up to par as the other Cheesecake Factories I have had in other cities such as PHX, SLC and Las Vegas. The service is hit and miss. The Cheesecake is still good here but the factor of not knowing what type of service your going to get is troubling. I will return reluctantly because of the Cheesecake but I had better food and service at the Elephant Bar and the Melting Pot."
Juanita J.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,5,1,5.0,10/8/2016,The food was delicious I ordered the Louisiana chicken Pasta it was a very large portion I had leftovers and I did not let them go to waste.....the service was amazing! We did go on a week night which was not busy so there was no wait and everyone was very attentive and kind. I plan on going back again soon I probably will not go on a weekend because of the long wait time but I will be back!
Ave L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,4,,2.0,9/5/2016,"We came here for my mothers birthday. The wait was short, 10 minutes on a holiday. My dad is on a special diet so he can not have carbs and must eat low-sugar items. The waiter was kind enough to make sure his burger was lettuce wrapped and with a salad on the side. I asked for a medium well burger with no mushrooms. When we got our food, we realized we had no forks and asked for some. We asked three times and were nearly done with our meal before receiving them. Unfortunately my dads salad was sugar coated in a dressing that he didn't ask for. He then asked for another one, which the waiter got no additional charge, but the new dressing was still sweet. My burger had no toppings at all and was well done. Moms/birthday girls meal was perfect so luckily she still ate happy.  The dessert was good. No problems here and got what we wanted with free of charge coffee thanks to the waiter.  The main issue was the price versus the quality. I think we would've had the same food made better elsewhere. Come for the dessert but maybe go have savory meals somewhere cheaper and local."
Priscilla D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,,4.0,4/3/2017,"I don't care for Chain restaurants, but this place is one of my favorites to go to.  So far, everything has been really good...sometimes there is a wait, but worth it."
Ronnie M.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,2,,1.0,10/1/2016,Terrible treatment due to being in a wheelchair. Out of everything on a Saturday night. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's all over the place. They just opened this place and I feel they would best served by just closing it. Doesn't meet the standards their other locations set.
Rod S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,13,,5.0,10/28/2016,"I was blown away by how good the food is here!  We tried several different items from the extensive menu, and found everything to be absolutely delicious.  They put a lot of work into finding unique flavor combinations to please your palate.  The service was friendly and helpful.  The prices are pretty fair for the quality that you receive.  I can't wait to go back."
Tony E.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,3,5.0,3/30/2016,"There was a bit of a wait but that's expected of a new restaurant.   The food was great, generous portions.  I recommend the eggplant parm.  Plus the cheesecake was to die for."
Melanie L.,"Albuquerque, NM",83,149,5,4.0,12/14/2016,"I didn't want to love this place. ""It's an overpriced chain!"", I told myself. In truth, I was planning on eating here and feeling dirty after, like I was having a secret best friendship with my best friend's cousin but she could never find out cause she'd be heartbroken. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service I received a few Saturday evenings ago right around 5. We had a baby and a toddler with us so we were primed to pick apart anything we deemed unworthy of a yelp 'whoohoo' review star. The menu itself is about 20 pages long so please bring your glasses if you need them and some patience;. If you're not great at making up your mind even when looking at smaller menus, this may not be the place for you. My issue with expansive menus is that I can't determine what it is they're good at cooking if they make everything. In order for a place with a 20 page menu to succeed, all of the menu items have to be at least a little better than average.Their cheesecake meets my guidelines. The appetizer was an array of fried avocado and zucchini which I really enjoyed. For dinner, I had pasta dish made with garlic sauce and tossed with veggies--it made me happy. I have to say that the service towards the end was a bit spotty because the servers were in the midst of shift change so if I had feedback to offer it would be to wait until your last table is served to tag team in your partner. Other than that, I'd go back for the cheesecake alone. If you want to dine here but don't want to pay an arm and a leg I suggest you visit during the week and dine on an appetizer and a split a slice of cheesecake."
Jennifer J.,"Rio Rancho, NM",2,43,19,4.0,1/31/2017,"The Cheesecake factory is excellent! I am so glad we finally got one in NM. I had a minor problem with my burger (the bun was totally hard on one side, probably from the heat lamp) but I told my waitress and she gave me a new one right away. It's always amazing tasting and the price is right for the quality and quantity of food you get. I always have to get a box since I can't finish it all. The ambiance is great and I will be returning here again and again!"
Joan Marie Y.,"Albuquerque, NM",467,46,16,3.0,7/19/2016,"First time there, it was large, a decent wait but it was dinner time. The atmosphere was very pleasant! The colors, the mirrors and the lights really added a really ""breakfast at Tiffany's"" touch. I was with a group of friends and it was our first time all together. The food portions are huge, which was great for the price. However, my one thing I found off putting was the price of the drinks. The prices were not listed, but they also were the most expensive thing on my bill. Considering I ordered food, a drink and cheesecake. The cheesecake was the cheapest and the absolute BEST! So many flavors to try and it was great! Definitely lived up to the hype for dessert. Plus there is a ton of parking where this location is which is a great plus. It was too hot sit outside, but the patio they have looks delightful."
Amanda R.,"Albuquerque, NM",41,31,,2.0,6/28/2016,"Here goes. Right off the bat, we were disappointed. When arriving at the hostess counter, I was asked if I would prefer an indoor or outdoor table. I said, ""either, whichever is ready faster."" I had my service dog and my partner with me at the time. The hostess was very polite when she asked us to stand aside and wait. However, in the time that we were waiting 2 or 3 couples of just two individuals (like us) arrived without reservations and were not asked to wait. They were immediately shown to tables. When I asked why this was I was told that our table was being cleaned. Although I spotted several clean and empty tables inside. We continued to wait and heard our hostess whispering with another individual about seating us outside because of ""the dog."" Little did she know, my SERVICE DOG, is a licensed medical device. We were ultimately seated outside. Other servers walked by, who were incredibly excited about the service dog. I feel that when it comes to dealing with disabled customers, all of their staff definitely needs more training, as they appear to have none and very little etiquette when it comes to such matters.  The food itself was good, and they have a great veggie burger. However, their menu is very overwhelming. For being the place that is supposed to be known for their Cheesecake, it was quite underwhelming."
Hadeel D.,"Albuquerque, NM",32,2,,1.0,6/15/2016,Horrible experience got my order wrong didn't even apologize nor take it off the bill. Waited extra 30 minutes until they fixed it while everyone at my table ate enjoyed and finished I finally just told her I didn't even want to eat it there anymore and to just box it for me.
Karen M.,"Albuquerque, NM",36,208,123,3.0,6/29/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Vegas. While shopping we decided to give this place a try.  I can't really say anything bad, but I can't really say anything wonderful. Service was average.  The food was average.  For the price I expected better. I will say it is very pretty.  There is a lot to choose from that's for certain.  Hmmm.  Not much to say.  Average."
