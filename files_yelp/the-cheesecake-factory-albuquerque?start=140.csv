Angelika I.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,3,1,3.0,7/13/2016,"I've only been here once because the wait time to be seated is ridiculous. We waited for about an hour or so. I think that's only because it's new, so it's still a hype. Once that dies down, I'll probably be back. It's a bit pricey, but the serving size was pretty big. Our server was really nice; she even got in a conversation with my brother. However, we couldn't get a hold of her often because of the crowd. I'm glad that we ordered an appetizer because it took a long time for our food to arrive. I ordered the carbonara, which was good. I already kind of lost my appetite by the time the food was served though so I ended up taking the rest of it to go."
Kelsi B.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,49,21,2.0,7/11/2016,Don't waste your time with curbside. We were told 25 minutes but waited an hour. Finally received mediocre cold food. $50 for a couple of appetizers and 2 slices of cheesecake. I know they are busy right now but if it's going to be an hour just tell people that.
LJ E.,"Albuquerque, NM",75,96,396,4.0,4/5/2016,"Recently I decided to go gluten-free for health reasons, and that has been a lifechanging experience for me (at least when it comes to eating out ;) ). One of my friends went to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and said ""Hey LJ! Guess what? They have a ton of gluten free food!"" which of course made me say ""Let's go. NOW."" I got a gluten-free pasta dish and it was sinfully delicious. I was a little sad that there weren't many gluten-free appetizer options, but the guacamole was delicious. And then...there was a Godiva gluten-free cheesecake. I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but I was desperate for a guilty, sinful, glutenless dessert and my desperation led me to a DELICIOUS slice. Our server was great, the food was good, the ambiance was nice, and I got to stuff my little gluten-free face. Overall, a great experience."
Bilal K.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,3/23/2016,"Discrimination wrapped up in a factory of unprofessionalism. Most of the cheesecake factories I have visited are busy. As is this new one in Albuquerque. We had waited long enough. I have been to  and people have waited long enough. I understand even though this is my country as much as anyone but I do expect suspicion when I step out of the house. May be I would be suspicious too if I belonged to a different denomination. The manager himself was asked to show us to our table. He literally ran away from us. We thought it was a new place and his hands were full. We were helped to our seats very politely telling us the manager had gone to find us a high chair. I am no longer sure if that's the truth. Our waitress kept asking for our order. She returned to our table three times under three minutes. We hurriedly ordered. The waitress served bread baskets all around but we were simply ignored. After an hour we were told she forgot to place our order. I demanded to speak to the manager. When I finally did get to talk to the manager he did not have much to say. When I told him this was the first time in five years I had felt like this in this city he told me he was sorry I felt that way.  I can live without going to the Cheesecake Factory. They do have a big menu. But the way I look at it its just a fancy Mcdonalds that serves expensive cake.The founding fathers had a vision for a new world. So left some provisions for the people of the future to work with. But in each time we find the worst in us have the better of us. Find new people to spit on from around us. The dreams the men of old times dreamt seem more like a mystery than a vision, where time falsely hints to a future yet we remain stuck in the past. Don't waste my time by being appropriate as to how to spell Moslem or Muslim or whatever. If my business is not welcome just put it up at the door. I will happily not come in."
Lindsey M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,4.0,8/14/2016,So glad we finally got a chance to eat here!  They have a huge menu with a little  something for everyone and the service was great! Also very quick. Everyone should try the cheesecake factory at least once!!
Kim P.,"Cedar Crest, NM",14,59,12,1.0,3/13/2016,"Will not accommodate handicap persons! Was quoted 30-40 min wait on the phone by a receptionist. She wouldn't take my name down unless we were there physically. I said I have a person in a wheelchair I can't leave them she said I'm sorry  SO I Left my handicap family member alone because she wanted to eat there really bad, while I literally ran to put my name in and was told when I got there which was less than 5 min that it's 1 and a half hours wait!! Talked to manager who was completely of no help. His response was well we're learning. Learning what? To misquote people especially handicap. This place isn't worth that wait! Trust me I grew up in California and have been there before. I'm more appalled at the lack of customer service especially towards people with disabilities! No wonder why their ratings in this new place are so LOW!"
Carol A.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,19,9,1.0,4/22/2016,"NO!!! Don't waste your time and money here, and you will spend a lot of money here, this place is super expensive for the type of food you are served. Everything comes from a box!! Please, instead go and support your local restaurants. There are so many great places in Albuquerque and this place unfortunately is not one of them! Yes, the place is huge and it looks great but the food is not tasty, maybe if you want dessert you can come here from time to time but my suggestion will be no and go find another local restaurant! Thanks!"
Heather B.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,33,3,1.0,3/20/2016,"If you dig a 3 hour wait, only being seated if your full party is present after said 3 hour wait and, finally, crappy food all around, then this place is for you.  A true slice of all that is wrong with chain restaurants. My niece wanted to go for her birthday, otherwise would have never considered it. Proved right. Can I give zero stars?"
Robert G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,2.0,5/21/2016,"The service at this cheesecake factory has gone downhill in a hurry. I've been to cheesecake factory's in AZ, CO, CA, NV, FL,TX And this is the only one with poor service we've been sitting here for 20 min finished meals and no service. This needs to be addressed."
Theodore B.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,16,11,5.0,6/23/2016,"We waited 7 months to visit this place because of long wait times. We arrived at 2pm (not exactly lunch time) and picked the bar because there was still a 20 minute wait time. Food was awesome which included fish tacos, pasta Bellagio and Tuscan chicken) but the best part of the visit was Ashley who was friendly, efficient and genuinely engaged with her customers. We'll be back, but maybe at 3pm."
U. K.,"Corrales, NM",1,40,,2.0,8/1/2016,"Very Las Vegas; giant, fancy, kinda pricey for the fare."
K B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,2.0,3/16/2016,"So, I ate here twice so far; both times very disappointing. A simple hamburger, which was requested to be cooked ""medium"", was clearly instead overcooked to ""well done"". My friend ordered the vegetable salad, which was fine, but way over-dressed. She couldn't finish it for this reason, but chose not to say anything to staff. For the second trip, I tried the ""Firecracker Salmon"" appetizer, which was tasteless and not worth half the cost.  I was thinking of trying this place out for its Happy Hour. Now, I think instead I'll just go someplace else. Not worth the wait, at least not based on these two experiences."
Alabama J.,"Albuquerque, NM",15,38,89,1.0,2/27/2016,We waited for 2 hours and didn't even get in the building. The hostess kelps telling us the wait would be  2 hours. After talking with some people that were seated they said they had been waiting 1 1/2 hours on the food. What a disappointment .
Tammy S.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,19,6,4.0,7/26/2016,Always a reliable good meal. Definitely explains why this place is always so busy. I would love to return.
K M.,"Malibu, CA",4,78,1,2.0,6/3/2016,"It would be 1 star if it weren't for such a kind and understanding waitress.  The food itself was salty to the point where we had to return 2 dishes--Orange Beef, and Cashew Chicken. I'll go to other Cheesecake Factory, but not this one."
Amanda L.,"Albuquerque, NM",30,5,2,3.0,7/24/2016,"Good food, large portions, not too expensive. Great cheesecake!Place was really busy and we had to wait for glasses to be washed to get our drinks. Our bread plates and a knife weren't clean, they had caked on food still on them. The waitress exchanged them right away for clean ones."
Michael W.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,5.0,12/19/2016,I've been there 4 times and I love this place. They offer variety items on the menu. And I always take some cheese cakes to go after I finish my meal. Will be back soon!
Christopher B.,"Albuquerque, NM",21,31,27,5.0,5/28/2016,"The banana cheesecake is the bomb . The service could be better, but as far as food.. the chefs in the back keep me coming back!"
L D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,10,,2.0,4/5/2016,"I really wanted to like this place but can't recommend it. I had the Sheila's Chicken Avocado Salad. It was huge and very good. I have since discovered that -- despite being called a salad -- the thing was 3,000 calories!!! There were decidedly too many downsides to this place to warrant going back: 1) Crowded  2) Loud 3) Pricey 4) Discouraged from lingering  I've never been in a restaurant with so many tables short of Chinese cafeteria-style dining. The consequent noise level was awful. The aisles between were so narrow and busy it took nearly 5 minutes to exit the place!  While the salad was tasty it cost nearly $20, certainly not worth the price. No reservations accepted.  Won't. Be. Back."
Danielle G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,2/13/2017,"We ordered Avocado egg rolls one of them had a hair inside the avocado. My half chicken came out broken into pieces, dry, over cooked and cold. The skin on the chicken was shriveled up like it was old, definitely not freshly cooked, the mashed potatoes were somewhat warm. We were on a double date with another couple so I didn't want to say anything. I've been to many different Cheesecake Factory's in other states and haven't had any problems before, sorry to say this one was disappointing."
