Elizabeth C.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,19,,4.0,7/21/2016,"I had the lemon cheesecake and it was very good. The Chicken Bellagio is tasteless and not good at all, definitely not worth $17.99. The service was very good and the food came out quickly. I would recommend trying to go between meal hours or on Monday night; the wait can easily be 2 hours on a Friday night."
Brady W.,"Ogden, UT",142,5,,5.0,6/15/2016,This is always one of my favorite places to dine! These guys sure know how to take care of people. The food is always so tasty. I enjoy the atmosphere they have created in their restaurant. Great prices as well!!!!
Melita W.,"Albuquerque, NM",27,17,1,1.0,2/26/2016,"I don't mind waiting considering it just opened. I expect it. What I do mind is being told 1:15 minutes...2:10 minutes ago. When I went to see how far down we were on the list, I was told :25 minutes. This was an hour ago. I just asked where we were and was told another 45 minutes. They offer bread and bananas to toddlers--I could have asked for that an hour ago if someone would have just been honest. I'm more concerned about feeding my 3 year old. Or...maybe I could have gone somewhere else to eat.  Whatever your wait time, add an hour. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the food or the service. My toddler tore up the bananas, though"
Dianne C.,"Albuquerque, NM",49,1,,3.0,2/24/2016,"The service was horrible had to wait 30 mins for my drinks, another 45 mins for my food and addition to that another 45 mins for my cheesecake that was ordered to go. I hope this place gets better on serving people's food instead of running around thinking what they need to do. Don't get me wrong, I am glad ABQ finally has a cheesecake factory but jeez its just absolutely ridiculous on the wait for the food and drinks."
Jacqueline M.,"Westside, Albuquerque, NM",39,49,13,5.0,3/1/2016,I love this place. I'm so glad they built one here in ABQ. Our wait was only 15 minutes. It was so awesome. We went at about 3pm so perfect for after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush. Our server Karen was so amazing and super sweet. Our food came out hot and delicious and in a reasonable ticket time too. We also got cheesecake of course. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and my husband got the carrot cake. We both highly recommend them.
Leslie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",53,8,,2.0,4/12/2016,"My husband and I went on Monday night at 10pm, so the restaurant was empty. We ordered cheesecake to go. It took 10 minutes even though there were three people behind the counter and no other customers. I got the Oreo deluxe and my husband got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake. My husband thought his had a strange after taste and did not finish it. The Oreos on mine were good, but the dessert was too sweet and tasted like it was made from low quality ingredients. I did not want to finish mine because it was not very good.  We both  miss Dee's Cheesecake Factory. This is not a place for good cheesecake, it is a place for extravagant looking desserts that taste Meh."
Mark C.,"Phoenix, AZ",312,18,1,5.0,4/15/2016,"Visited just a couple weeks back with my work team. It was very busy on a Thursday during lunch hours, so we ended up finding a spot at the bar for all 5 of us. The food was good and the bar staff was very friendly like you would expect if you were sitting at a table. I want to visit again once the hype slows, because I want to enjoy the overall experience, rather than just a quick midday lunch."
Sanjay B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,4,1.0,6/10/2017,i'm giving this place a single star do to the service or the lack there of.  we were sitting here for almost 2 1/2 hours waiting for our order.  the kids were waiting even longer for the desert.  I find it really impossible for a place of this stature has this type of serviceus.   cheesecake used to be one of my favorite places until I came to albuquerque.
Kate M.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,16,2,5.0,5/13/2016,"I ordered the mushroom burger. It was sooo good. The seasoning on the mushrooms was perfect. If you like garlic butter you will like this burger. The service was fast and friendly,  I will definitely come nack."
Ricky S.,"Santa Cruz, NM",0,17,,4.0,12/30/2016,New restaurant it is very clean and classy place. we were told that wait was 45 minutes but we were able to sit at the and order dinner. This only took about 15 minutes. The plates are huge and very tasty. I recommend the soups and the chicken parm. sandwich. The drinks are priced right as well. This place is a must-visit if you're hungry for a good meal that's priced reasonably. We'll go back for sure!
Andrea B.,"Los Lunas, NM",0,13,,2.0,3/7/2016,The Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite restaurants but I would recommend not going to this location until they get their stuff together. Our waitress was horrible! My husband ordered the Garlic noodles with Shrimp and was sick all night puking! So disappointing
Bruce P.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,4/16/2016,I went for my birthday and I had to wait 2 hours for a table then I go to ask if my table is ready and they asked me if I could wait a bit longer so I went across the street to the Elephant Bar this was on a Wednesday night thanks for ruining my birthday Cheesecake Factory
T L.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,12/24/2016,Our service was fantastic! The best experience  we have had here. Jonathon C was attentive but not hovering and very helpful with suggestions. Our food was great! Great experience!
Carli M.,"Gallup, NM",67,20,52,5.0,4/26/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory and am really glad my friend told me about this new location. I only come into town every so often, so who knows how long it would have taken me to figure it out."
Leah E.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,2.0,6/10/2016,"When my party of three arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, we were seated right away. But then we waited. And waited. And waited. After twenty minutes, my friend went up to the hostess to tell her we hadn't been helped yet. She said she got our server's attention and that he'd be right over. But he wasn't. We waited ten more minutes and in that time we saw people at the table next to us be seated and helped right away. So my friend alerted the hostess again. The hostess said she saw our server (named Kevin) lounging at the bar so she changed us to a table with their best server (Ty).  After we were re-seated, everything was excellent. But I've never had to wait at a table for thirty minutes without being helped before."
Jamie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",20,4,,5.0,5/8/2016,Amazing food with huge potions. The food taste homemade and the new Cheesecake Factory is beautiful. I can't wait to go back!! 5 stars
Nina G.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,19,,1.0,9/17/2016,"All I can say is this place is diabetic danger zone! Everything here is so sweet and I am not talking about the cheesecake! This is a dangerous place for diabetics and I'm sure many left in diabetic comas. Horrible, low quality, high sugar food."
Amanda L.,"Uptown, Albuquerque, NM",1,2,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Food wasn't bad, the service sucked.  The hostess kept stepping on my daughter and didn't bother to apologize,  the wait for the food was over an hour and request for drink refills took forever.  Dessert took another 30 mins.  For all the people that applied for a job there, looks like the top servers were not picked.  With a restaurant thats busy a long wait is expected but, almost 3 hours is a bit much."
Ian S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8,6,,3.0,2/26/2016,Okay food is obviously delicious. I'm only rating 3 stars because of the drink quality. I ordered the ultimate margarita and I tasted more triple sec than actual tequila. Kind of disappointing seeing that I was in Denver the week prior and dined at a cheese cake factory there and they made a really good ultimate marguerite there. My main disappointment stems from that because I'm in New Mexico and should only expect any top notch margarita or one that has at least an inkling taste of tequila.
Mike G.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",17,5,,4.0,2/24/2016,"Attended the soft opening on Friday, February 19.  Sat at the bar and ordered the wings to start, followed by the Cuban sandwich, with a slice of cheesecake to go.  Very tasty.  Staff all new, supplemented with managers transplanted from within the organization.  All are eager and motivated, given that this is the first CCF in New Mexico.  Within a week or two, you will start seeing quite a few five star reviews."
