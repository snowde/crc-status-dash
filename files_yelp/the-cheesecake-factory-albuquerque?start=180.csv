Sophia D.,"San Pedro, CA",91,2,,4.0,3/31/2016,"Great service .. Food was delicious, only down fall was the wait! Their Raspberry cheesecake was the best!"
Deya C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,1,5.0,5/13/2016,"Everything was great, the food,  the service , etc. It was pretty busy , so the food took a little time to arrive, but is understandable. The fact that the buzzer works in a couple of stores in the mall is nice. One hour of waiting goes by fast when you are shopping!"
Isabel J.,"Albuquerque, NM",72,8,1,5.0,5/4/2016,Try the lemon raspberry cheesecake. All of the fruity cheesecakes rock! The food is always yummy too.
Hunt J.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,73,183,5.0,3/19/2016,this was a great Cheesecake Factory. the wait was 2 hours because it is a very new restaurant. the food was amazing & the staff was really nice. the bacon bacon cheeseburger was the best. everything was well prepared & yummy. everyone was nice. the Oreo milkshake was delicious and so was the vanilla bean cheesecake. this trip was definitely worth the wait. look for the gentleman with long hair & glasses. he is very nice. oh! and also the decor in the restaurant was so lovely!!! the low light and amazing art work was the best. :) when they tell you that your going to be waiting a certain amount of time you can shave off 15 minutes give or take. the atmosphere is great. I would assume that this is a great place to go on a date or double date. you have to get cheesecake. if you are too full from that chicken bellagio then get it to go.
Steph D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,2.0,5/1/2016,"We went on a Saturday night, which was understandably busy. We decided to skip dinner and order cheesecake to go. We placed our order, and waited for over an hour. Finally we asked about order, we were told it would only be five more minutes. Fifteen minutes later we were getting a little upset, another waitress in the cheesecake area noticed and asked us what order we were waiting for. As she looked into what was going on, it was discovered that they lost our order. The waitress that originally helped (and told us it would only be five minutes longer) had done absolutely nothing. The cheesecake was good, but be prepared to wait at least two hours, and don't expect an apology from staff if they loose your order."
Maria G.,"Los Lunas, NM",0,6,,5.0,4/30/2016,"We went on a busy Saturday evening and it was pretty pact, so the wait was a good 45 minutes, but it was worth it. The seats looked like cozy sofas and they were very comfortable.   We sat outside and it was chilly and started to rain, but the waitress was quick to turn on the heaters. The  restaurant is clean and beautiful and The service was awesome! The menu was an outstanding vast verity.  My husband had the meet loaf and I had one of their steaks.  It was cooked perfectly with a side of  fried green beans, sprouts and mashed potatoes with bacon in them.  Delicious! I had it with a glass of red wine, perfect combination!"
M A.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,2.0,4/29/2016,I forgot golden rule. Do not order anything other than dessert from The Factory.  Fettuccine was not worth it. Staff were great though.
Kimberly M.,"Westside, Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,5.0,4/22/2016,"First time at this or any CF in a long while. The wait we were given was 45-60 min, and it was on the long end, but they seated us quickly. The menu's a lot longer than I remember, but everything sounds delicious. Got the Crispy Shrimp sandwich, which is a lot bigger than I anticipated. But the Chinese Chicken Salad my mother got is ridiculously huge (might get it next time lol). Our server, Brian, was very helpful and had an answer ready for our questions. Need to make sure I get a smaller plate so I have room for a slice of cheesecake next time!"
Design C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,5,,3.0,10/18/2016,"This place may take a few years to get up to speed. LONG WAIT TIME, and the bar staff needs an attitude adjustment and training at the very least. Been going to the locations in Scottsdale and have never been disappointed, so I have hope for this place down the road."
Vitamin D.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,11,1,4.0,5/14/2016,Came here for the first time and this place is pretty good! The atmosphere was very unique and the food was delicious.  Didn't get to try any cheesecake but will definitely try next time.
Mack M.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,2,,1.0,3/13/2016,Went on friday.  Was told the wait would be 2 and a half hours.  I asked if I could make a reservation for Saturday.  I was told they do not take reservations.  Went to the standard dinner.  10 minute wait.  Great food.  I will try a different day but given the poor service reviews I am not expecting much. When the novelty wears off they better have their act together.
Cristian C.,"Albuquerque, NM",18,21,17,5.0,2/26/2016,"Good food, delicious cheesecake, great service. Long wait as expected but worth it! Had the crispy fish tacos and an amazing white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake."
Markus C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,13,2,4.0,4/6/2016,"So excited for Albuquerque location to open.  We waited 3 hours first time....well worth it.  Have been here twice since, service great, food good and server (twice) Tyler is exceptional.  Only negative is that I have yet to have a cocktail that's fixed correctly.....bartenders need help.  Try happy hour bar menu....it's great!"
Dorein R.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,9,,1.0,7/23/2016,"Extremely expensive the jambalaya was nasty the Linguini was nasty everything way too salty it's like they didn't even know what other spices could go in the food except salt. They put the utensils fork and knives on the table that rarely gets wiped sufficiently to be clean and they put the napkin in a cup the utensils should be in. an elevated place to eat fine.... dining.... I have never in my life seen my fork and knife directly on the table where other people spill food, drop food out of their mouth, spilled drinks, kids touch so unsanitary it's ridiculous, that is the worst dining experience and the poorest most disgusting thing to do in a nice supposedly elevated restaurant. the only thing good about this place is the cheesecake and that is expensive and very small slice and their out of many different kinds it's a Cheesecake Factory how can they be out of any kind of Cheesecake ridiculous. do not come here way better to go to crackin crab."
Polly A.,"Albuquerque, NM",90,6,1,5.0,3/31/2016,Have eaten there twice since it opened and have been happy with their food and service. Try the vegan Cobb salad!
Cat W.,"Albuquerque, NM",18,11,9,2.0,3/30/2016,Long wait for food. Loud loud atmosphere.   Lots of screaming children. Really hoped the food makes upfor this. The bread plates were dirty. The water tastes like pool water. Samosa app too salty. My dining companions liked the Asian salad and chicken tacos. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I guess some people like this.
Jack T.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,,2.0,9/18/2016,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake. Service is just ok and the food is edible but not so flavorful. Plus, it is overpriced. In short, eat somewhere else and then go to the cheesecake factory for dessert."
Lori B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,2.0,9/14/2016,"We weren't happy with the quality of the food for the price.  The service was lacking as well..our order was mixed up with someone else's after waiting for 25 minutes to get it.  Not a big fan, the best part was of course...the cheesecake."
Lexie R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,38,,2.0,9/5/2016,"Not impressed with our overall experience. When we were seated, our booth had crumbs all over the seat, which I just used a napkin to wipe off. Our waiter was not very personable and we had to ask multiple times for things (like a replacement napkin and our appetizer...) We ordered the macaroni balls which were my favorite, falafel ball salad which was not good, the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was ok and the kids pizza, which my son enjoyed but it didn't look very appetizing.. The falafel balls tasted microwaved and there was way too much kale in it. The dressing they used was good at least. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was mostly sauce and little bits of chicken and shrimp. It seemed as if they had made a big pot of it and we got the serving that was scraped out of the bottom of the pot. It would have been good if the chicken chunks were larger and they used whole shrimp instead of chopped up shrimp. There were also no vegetables which I thought was strange... The pepperonis on the pizza were all burned around the edges, which thankfully, my picky toddler did not complain about.  He had an upset stomach shortly after eating, which I am wondering could be related to the pizza he ate?? It might be worth it to go there just for dessert, since that is what they're most known for, but if you are looking for a good quality meal, you might want to try elsewhere.."
Rose S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,109,10,1.0,3/27/2016,"Hubby and I have dined at Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the U.S.  Favorite menu items are Miso Salmon and soy sauce, sesame seed Edamame.  Hubby ordered a burger and I ordered my usual.  The Miso Salmon arrived with a huge trim of burned, black char around the entire piece of salmon and the driest inner salmon I've ever seen.  I looked at the server and explained that I order this item once a week at other CCF's and it never arrives so overcooked as to have a char edge around it.  The server agreed and sent it back.  A manager came to apologize and said they were remedying the situation.  A new plate of Miso Salmon arrived.  I cut into it and it was like raw sushi, not cooked at all.  The edamame arrived and was undercooked.  First time that has ever happened.  How hard can it be to pan fry edamame?  I didn't complain about the edamame as hubby said he'd bring it back and microwave the order.  I sent the salmon back and asked for it to be removed from the bill.  The manager came over again and apologized.  He said the Miso Salmon would be removed from the bill; however, he'd sent it back to be properly cooked.  The manager sounded confident they could get this right; thus, I agreed to wait. The waitress arrived next and presented the bill, Miso Salmon removed.  Since the bill arrived with the Miso Salmon removed as promised but without the Miso Salmon re-cooked, I figured the chef had screwed up a third time.  The manager showed up again, apologized, said there had been a misunderstanding of my instructions and the salmon would not be coming out.  I just wanted out of there at that point so I could go to the nearest Taco Bell, where they always present a perfect Taco Supreme.  This particular CCF needs to charge Taco Bell prices until they get their act together.  Additionally, given the myriad Yelp complaints about this CCF, their corporate management should terminate the manager/chef, bring in a new team overseen by someone from the Atlanta, GA or San Mateo, California CCF restaurants to oversee things until this locale lives up to the name.  At present, they are ruining the good will and solid reputation that other CCF's have built over the years."
