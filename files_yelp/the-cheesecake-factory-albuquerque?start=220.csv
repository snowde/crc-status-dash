Justine M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,2.0,4/11/2016,"We were seated immediately but when we asked to sit at a different table they said no because there was no server for that table. 2-3 minutes later another family was seated at the table we wanted. We ordered food and waited 25-30 minutes for it to be brought out - definitely order appetizers! We all asked for our burgers to be well done but were all cooked differently - one was well done, one was medium well, and one was about medium. Finally, at the end of our dinner our server brought our ticket without offering dessert. I was disappointed, maybe once the hype goes away I'll try it again!"
Roberto E.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,28,1,3.0,7/16/2016,"Nothing tops off an afternoon of shopping better than a great meal at an amazing place... or so we thought. When we first walked in we expected the crowd at the front so we were ready to wait until we were told we could sit in the bar area which we took full advantage of and thought to ourselves SCORE!... no wait. A couple of minutes later our waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Ten minutes later we got our drinks and placed our order right away so there wouldn't be too much of a delay since the place was getting busy. 35-40 minutes later we received our entrees, we could tell our waitress left them sitting for a while because the top was cold and it wasn't until we stirred them that they actually were warm enough to eat. During the 35 minutes that we waited we saw our waitress a couple of times and she kept telling us they were still working on our order then she disappeared for a while--the adjacent waitress could probably tell we were becoming aggravated and she came over to check on us and offered to refill our drinks which we were thankful for since our own waitress didn't do so. In fact, we waited so long, the tables that were seated after us received their food 10-15 minutes before we did. Our waitress never apologized for the wait nor did she offer anything else, she dropped off our food and disappeared again. Once we finished she promptly brought us our check, she wasted no time ringing us up--I wish she would have been that quick with our food. I have to give credit to this place for having an amazing atmosphere, the décor is beautiful and comfortable even though it was really busy during our visit. Also, once we received our food, the taste was great and the portion just right. I'm not sure what it's going to take to fix the service and attitude of the workers at this location, none (except for the adjacent waitress) seemed to care, even the on duty manager didn't seemed bothered by the mounting complaints as we saw him comping checks from other unhappy customers. I suppose we could have complained to him directly and maybe had our check comped as well but judging by his attitude and the way he disrespecfully rolled his eyes at the customers he comped, it would have been a waste and I would have had some choice words for him if he rolled his eyes at me as well so we instead called it a loss and left. This is by far the most mismanaged location I have ever been to-- there needs to be change from the top. Prior to posting this review I read previous reviews and more importantly the responses from the ""business manager"" to all the complaints posted on this forum which amounted to no more than a poor excuse for an apology to my fellow yelpers, I honestly expect the same lacking response to this posting. I challenge management to make a change, a lasting change that will save this location otherwise it is doomed to go the way of most big chain restaurants--mediocre and forgettable."
Johnny V.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,62,1,1.0,3/27/2016,"Do you crave overpriced,  mass produced,  highly processed,  caloric intense ""food"" that you wait 3 hours to eat?  Well Albuquerque, does TCF have a treat for you!    Ever since they opened in Beverly Hills in the 70s this gem of an eatery had been churning out food for the masses.  They don't have any professional tasters and why would you need those?  All of their food is chock full of sugar and sodium to mask the true taste.   A 21 page menu....imagine how fresh most of those items are?  Even the cheesecake is flat but oh so full of sugar.  I mean come on.  It is hard to make a good NY style cheesecake!!!   Sarcasm.   I often wonder why, in a city and state so full of culture, hundreds of years of the most unique and tasty food, some of the freshest and most storied ingredients that that we allow a fortune 500 business with subpar food onto the market.  Not only that a large majority of you will wait hours and endure crap service to ravenously give it a 5 star review.  Grow a pair and call it like it is....another corporate chain who got a coveted liquor license in a prime location that probably paid off a New Mexico family so you could drink a fritz sugary watered vodka drink on GNO.   We need to start blocking these places in uptown.   It is enough"
Jon S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,2,,2.0,3/14/2016,I forgave waiting a while to order a drink. And the lack of knowledge our bartender had about the food menu. The salads came out wrong and he apologized and he fixed the check. But when my wife's food got there and 45 more minutes went by before I had to make a scene to call attention that I had no food. It was crazy. Then the manager doesn't even give us the courtesy of coming by. Just has the bartender to ask if I even want it.  Yeah! Still haven't had dinner. I ate while drinking my wife's water cause not only no water refill but no offer for another beer. He honestly hurt himself. I was ready to spend around $120 on dinner. But oh well the bill was 39 and we still have him 10. Never even met a manager. Never was offered dessert. Even though we were looking around at the cheesecakes. Just over all not good. I hope it's growing pains but for me it will be another year before I even care to give them another shot. If at all. First time at any Cheesecake Factory. Don't know that I care to go back. Plenty of great mom and pop places here. They treat people better and at least I meet someone besides the bartender. Obviously I don't blame the bartender for the back of house mistake. But he didn't wow me either. Nor did he even try
Kelli G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,11,,2.0,4/23/2016,"Such a step down from the ones in Denver and Vegas.  The service was so slow, but I was going to let that slide because I know they're pretty new.  But we did have to ask where our appetizer was.  It must have been sitting because when it got to us, it was lukewarm.  We'd ordered the same thing in Denver and Vegas and it was delicious, fried mac and cheese balls ($10.35).  Here, they were bad.  The mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box, and it was very salty.  No one ate it.  Everyone thought the food was okay.  When the waitperson came back to the table at the end of our meal, I explained what was wrong with the appetizer, as it was clear no one ate it.  She replied, ""Okay.  I'll tell them.""  I assumed when the check came, there'd be no charge for it.  Wrong.  My experience in restaurants has always been that you order something that's not good, you don't eat, you tell staff, they will refund it.  I guess I should have just flat out asked.  Maybe my fault.  But we won't be going back to Cheesecake Factory in Albuquerque."
