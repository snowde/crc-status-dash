Marie S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,69,42,3.0,10/1/2017,"The last two visits have been okay. During half price cheesecake weekend, they wouldn't let me get two slices of cheesecake for half price even though my mom was waiting outside. I wasn't impressed with the Pasta Napoletana- more like half grease, half spaghetti. I should've stuck with the chicken marsala."
Jonathan B.,"Albuquerque, NM",654,42,50,2.0,7/3/2016,Waiting two hours for any meal is not a pleasant experience. You might just want to eat  before you go.
James V.,"Denver, CO",0,160,445,5.0,8/12/2016,"Well we finally tried the cheesecake factory. I've been wanting to try this for some time but just never have. while we were on vacation in NM my step-mother treated us to this restaurant. Although we had kinda a difficult time finding this location we eventually did, its in the back of the mall.  We went in a Thursday evening around 9pm and we still had a wait. One thing that is nice is if you are able to use a smartphone you can pull up their whole menu online so you already have an idea of what you want when you are seated. We were greeted in a timely manner which I always appreciate. the menu ranges from what I could tell is from $12-30, and there are plenty of apps to choose from.  They offer several entrée selections that include but not limited to pasta, steaks , seafood, and salads. I had a ribeye steak for dinner which honestly was cooked like I asked and had a great flavor.  My Father opted for the Hibachi steak which he also enjoyed and both our meals came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. My Wife and Stepmother both opted for pasta dishes which were served with fresh grated parmesan cheese, my Son the fried shrimp platter which he didn't choose to offer me a sample but informed me they were delicious, lol.  and they did look like a nice size of shrimp. All in all we all enjoyed our meals, the only thing we regret is we were all so tired from a day of shopping in Sante fe we didn't try the cheesecake or other desserts. So that will be on our ""bucket list"" when we get back to Denver.  So I will recommend this location and stay tuned for our review about Denver's Cheesecake Factory!!"
Maria-Christina S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",140,151,214,2.0,12/22/2016,"I don't get it. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like such a great place but our experience was quite the opposite. First, they say they're open late but what they really mean is that if you come in after 8p maybe you can sit at the bar and maybe someone will be willing to at least take your order at some point but don't expect drinks or bread or any of the other things you'll get in the regular dining areas. So, we came in after 8p, 6 of us. The second we walked in the hostess was less than thrilled to see us and everything went downhill from there. We saw at least 4 waiters/waitresses in the area, none of which could be bothered to help the one server that was taking care of all the tables seated in the bar. Needless to say we got no refills, we had to ask for bread a couple times before we actually got some and the food was not only barely warm and tasted ""meh"", it wasn't even correct! One in our party didn't get his entree until after the rest of us were almost finished. All of that that and then a ridiculously large bill similar to what we would have paid for a nicer dinner somewhere else in the area. I've had the opportunity to go back but opt for other places for dinner, if I ever do go back maybe I'll just have dessert, seems to be the safest bet for my buck."
A C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,31,,3.0,8/21/2017,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory - the menu, the drinks, and the atmosphere.  We eat there about 3-4 times a year.  Our server on this last visit was not friendly or helpful at all.  She NEVER smiled or made us feel welcome. It was early evening midweek, so they were not super busy.  Jennifer failed to tell us about the specials and so we ordered our meal.  We heard about them from the server at the table next to us.  When Jennifer returned to ask about our drinks, I asked why she didn't tell me about the special, because it was a pan-seared salmon dish and I had ordered herb -crusted salmon!  She tried to tell me it was the same thing, and then she tried to say what I ordered was better.  After a short back and forth, and never an apology, she finally offered me the special.  Everything turned out fine and our meals were great, but a server who is disinterested in her guests makes the whole dining out experience very unpleasant."
Aretha K.,"Socorro, NM",1,17,5,5.0,2/3/2017,"Me and my husband went there in weekend for lunch. The ambience was so great and the staff were excellent. In the peak hour, we don't have to wait in a long time. Both of us ordered burger (forget the name), but it definitely the best burger i've ever tried in US. Quite expensive, but the portion also large, complete with side dish. I took salad and my husband had fries.  Salad was so good with the dressing (honey mustard) and fries also tasty, even they didn't put so much salt or other spices. I definitely would come back to try other main course."
Jason P.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,42,1,4.0,8/9/2017,This by far is one of the best Cheese Cake Factory's I have eaten at. I must admit I originally thought the food would be mediocre being so far from the other locations. Man was I wrong. Keep up the good work guys! I will be back.
Jordan G.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,14,6,1.0,6/28/2017,We enjoyed the dessert but our entree was another story. We ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and the teriyaki chicken. The bang bang tasted very strongly of the sweet orange juice concentrate and the teriyaki had several bones and there were fried bananas which still had a produce sticker on it.  We will not be going back there.
Keith B.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,45,105,4.0,2/7/2017,"The white bread  we got was really hard compared to the brown bread .  I ordered the lemon-herb roasted chicken and it was really moist, the carrots tasted great, I would definitely order this again. My friend got the cobb salad . Her first salad  was a little wilted  and the MGR was very nice and replaced it for free.   The waitress started off attentive but I think she got overwhelmed with other tables and forgot about us, fortunately another waitress was helpful."
Cecil G.,"Imperial, CA",2,72,4,2.0,6/11/2017,"This is the worst cheecake factory I have been to, I have been to many up and down the coast of California and in Arizona. The staff at this location lack training in prompt customer service and screening plates before expo. The food takes twice as long to receive as any other location. Even simple appetizers you're looking at a minimum of 30 minutes. This is without it being busy. The bread is rarely fresh and the food is always barely passing off as ok. Don't get your hopes up for the cheesecake factory you know to be, it will disappoint to say the least."
Joanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,154,42,5.0,6/28/2016,"I am not to sure why cheesecake factory dosent have a higher rating. We was so excited that Albuquerque finally has a cheesecake factory, we used to live in Tucson and loved CF until it went down hill but I will save that for another review. We have been to CF 3 times now since it has opened and my oh my we haven't been disappointed both my husband and I have tried something new from the menu each time and everything has been amazing from the pasta, to the steak to the salads and cheesecake oh the cheesecake the choices are far and plenty and the flavors are divine.  Cheesecake factory is my go to dinner place when the hubby asks me where I want to go and I don't foresee that changing. Keep up the good work CF I for one am glad ur here in Albuquerque."
Mike S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,17,6,5.0,7/9/2016,"Very rarely do I give a restaurant a five star review.  Today I experienced 5 star service and 5 star food at Albuquerque's new Cheesecake Factory.   We arrived at opening time,  (11:00 a.m.  Saturday morning)...  Since opening a few months ago, the location  has been overwhelmed with business and it  has been almost impossible to secure a table. I was reluctant to patronize this location after having read several ""negative""  reviews here on Yelp.   But like anything else, food and service is very subjective.    My dining guest  and I decided to experience it firsthand and reach our own conclusion.  Given the fact they have only been open a couple of months, I expected there to be ""opening month""  blunders and lots of them.  That in fact did happen.   Now that Albuquerque's  Cheesecake Factory has had a few months to find their way,  they're ready for ""prime time"".  Bear in mind that I am one of the harshest restaurant critics on the planet earth... Having said that, I must share with you my dining  experience.   We were greeted by a pleasant young man ""DANNY"" , our server.  He was quite knowledgeable about the menu and was personable and friendly. We started with a couple of appetizers. ... Fried Zucchini and Guacamole and chips... They were delivered promptly.   What a pleasant surprise...  The Guacamole was made up of  giant chunks of fresh cut up avocados,  tomatoes and onions and a nice blend of spices,  unlike the usual mish mash you get at other restaurants .  Indeed, the best Guacamole I've ever had in Albuquerque.  My lunch guest ordered fish and chips... I ordered their pit beef sandwich which is a roast beef au jus sandwich which came with a cup of  natural beef dipping  juices  and horseradish on the side.  The fish and chips were  hot and crisp served with tartar sauce.  My hot roast beef sandwich was absolutely delicious...  The beef was  thinly sliced, very tender and  cooked perfectly to a medium and was served with a  slice of cheese and caramelized onions on a delicious seeded roll along with sweet potato fries. The portion was quite generous and filling.  The service provided by Danny was very professional and exemplary. The restaurant's manager, JOHN GARCIA,   came by our table to ensure everything was satisfactory.  Indeed it was and then some. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Albuquerque's new Cheesecake Factory... This is a 'must visit' .   I highly recommend it and proudly give it 5 stars !!!  Mike Santullo Albuquerque,  New Mexico"
Carla M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,10,,1.0,6/27/2017,They do not have drink prices on the menu- someone in my group ordered a skinny cosmo- it was 11.25!!!!  That is a ridiculous price for a drink in Albuquerque- the manager came over and blamed corporate - did nothing else!! Terrible customer service!
Amanda B.,"Albuquerque, NM",49,1,,1.0,8/14/2017,Awful service! Appetizers took forever to come out! Alcohol drinks were served before any fountain drinks. First time going and I will not return.
Angela G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,3,1.0,3/12/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory's across the country and this one is by far the worst. They STILL can't get their recipes right! I have given them sufficient chances going there several times now for dinners and brunch today, which was the last straw. They couldn't even do a simple Eggs Benedict right. The hollandaise sauce was putrid and inedible. Pancakes are served with their ""own syrup"" which is basically melted butter with a splash of maple flavoring- gross! So they gave us some cheap Smuckers Lite Syrup packets, like in an IHOP. Pathetic. Their service is like their food, inconsistent and sloppy. No one stands out as exceptional, they are all par for the course, borderline rude since its obvious they are just as frustrated with their kitchen. I always knew that New Mexico could never uphold this company's culinary or customer service standard and I was right."
Rose R.,"Albuquerque, NM",116,7,,1.0,6/14/2017,"Waited an HOUR for our food to come out!  And purposely went at 2pm to miss the lunch crowd for my birthday!  Place was not busy at all and when our food came out very disappointing. My vegetable salad seemed half frozen half wilted!  Even my 8 year old niece said ""I don't want that tomato it looks old..."" LOL My fiancé ordered a salad and all that came out was a bowl of mixed greens lettuce that's it no dressing no carrots nothing just lettuce!  Could not believe it!  Never going back plus my birthday lunch was ruined.  Oh well...."
Suzie D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,8,1.0,3/28/2016,"The DISHES were disgustingly DIRTY. The first two cups had a nasty red sauce on the handle and on the bottom of the cups, both of them. With a few bits of food around the rim. We asked for new cups. She brought back two more cups which still had food gunk stuck to it. One even had something like spinach stuck to the rim. The silverware? Forget about it. They were sticky with food particles caked onto them. Did they even run them through the dish washer? We asked for plastic silverware to eat with. I didn't want to keep sending the waitress back. Check out the photos. When we spoke to the manager about it, he seemed to not care at all. He was very ""as if"" about it. So, no help from him. He rolled his eyes as we left the restaurant.  I usually love this chain but the Albuquerque one is the worst I have ever been to. I've been to 6 different ones in different states. It's usually my go to. I'll never go back to the Albuquerque chain. Gross!"
Linda T.,"Albuquerque, NM",30,127,50,4.0,5/16/2016,"At least NM now has a Cheesecake Factory.. after a long enough wait. I've been in twice -- once for an actual sit down meal & once to pick up a slice of cheesecake (only because I was craving it). Both times have been quite pleasant -- although the wait was quite longer than expected. The first time I went in w/ a friend around like 430pm on a weekday... I got there first to reserve our spot in line which resulted in a 30-45min wait. I mean, it's cool because I could get in some shopping in the meantime. I came back 30-45min to get seated at a table near the bar. The waitress waiting on my table was very attentive & got us our food in a reasonable amount of time. I got the mac & cheese burger & it was pretty filling. The amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I also got the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go & that was a pretty good decision. The second time I came in was for a cheesecake run... at like 10pm on a weekday night. I was literally the only one in the cheesecake pick up line -- but had to wait like 5min before someone actually helped me. This time, I got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut one & it's def one of my faves. I look forward to coming back here again to try other menu items as well as other cheesecakes."
Lindy M.,"Los Lunas, NM",1,4,,5.0,7/31/2017,Man there fish and chip are pretty good but not the best but I'm glad there's one in Albuquerque there cheese cake is good to
Michelle F.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2017,"One star because the cheesecake is great! From the greeting at the hostess stand,  the horribly long wait (while table after table needed to be bussed)  to receiving our appetizer with the meal,  the meal had hair particles in the soup and under the plate. Ps don't order the French dip sandwich-  couldn't tell what was grizzle and what was cheese! No thanks.....we wont be going back to this place again."
