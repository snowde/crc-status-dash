Junior B.,"North Valley/Los Ranchos, Albuquerque, NM",87,148,375,3.0,4/19/2016,Beautiful restaurant great service but the food just was not there to match. We had a mac & cheese burger and it was tasty but just not there. I would give the cheese cake five stars if I could. I would give five stars to all the staff if I could. But the food was not all that hype. But it's a beautiful place and a wonderful experience
Steve M.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,43,1,5.0,6/17/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is a hopping place. Sometimes too busy.  But I've had three great meals and great service there in a row.  Thumbs up.
Riley J.,"Albuquerque, NM",171,197,10,2.0,9/12/2016,"I can not and will not ever be able to get on the Cheesecake Factory train.  Their food is pricy, but that's not the problem, the problem is it is so incredibly salty I find it barely palatable. Every single time without fail it makes my mouth feel like I have spent an hour licking a salt block. I just can not justify spending that much money for crazy amounts of salt.  The cheesecake is eh. It's good, it's different, it's crazy tall with crazy flavors, but I think you can do better. No, I know you can do better."
Lynne S.,"Los Alamos, NM",21,6,2,2.0,10/13/2017,I have been there twice a year apart the wait is ridiculous more than an hour.  Both times I have been my meal was not delivered everyone else in the party received their food I didn't.  I don't like the way they deliver the meal it doesn't come out for a table at the same time it comes out so maybe half the table receives food and the other half waits.  Both times I have been there they delivered the wrong food to someone in our party.  It is awkward to sit for 15 minutes while the rest of the group eats waiting for food.  If it only happens once I could excuse it but for it to happen twice is inexcusable. Such a poorly managed place.
Amber Rose B.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,7/15/2017,11.25 for one cocktail drink !!! No price for it on the menu either just let you order it totally oblivious to the price gouging. Very disappointed never going back
Jenni G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",6,31,13,5.0,6/9/2017,Yummy yummy. Amazing customer service. I had to speak to the manager just to tell him how satisfied I was. Oh and don't forget to try the salted caramel cheesecake.
Aurelio C.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,11,,3.0,1/7/2017,"Skip the meals. Go for the desserts. I went with my family on New Years Day and nobody was overwhelmed by the entrees. Very bland and slow to arrive. The quality was no better than any other chain diner. The desserts, on the other hand, were outstanding. Next time, we will go for coffee and the rich dessert items."
Raina M.,"Albuquerque, NM",17,23,23,5.0,3/6/2016,"Who knew this place served more than just cheesecake! ?!!  What a fun and hip place to eat while enjoying the company of  family and friends.  Everyone was genuinely happy to help and work.   Loved the music and the decor.  It was non stop from the time we arrived to the time we left.  Not a whole lot of space to sit and wait for extended periods but the buzzers have a pretty decent range so you can check out  near by shops as you wait.  We were fortunate enough to snag a bar table which was a major SCORE!   Our waitress Katie was very sweet and made our experience well worth the wait.  I had the pleasure of eating the avocado eggrolls, Cajun Jumbolya along with a Cosmo what a treat! Kaluha cheese cake to go please it's a wrap!"
Martha L.,"Albuquerque, NM",85,42,54,3.0,3/28/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory- it's the same everywhere you go. The food is good, the cheesecake is yummy!! We had the tiramisu cheesecake, very very good! The service- sooo slowww. Our waitress kept forgetting us, our party of 6 couldn't get a refill. We had to ask other servers for silverware, straws, refills, missing food,ect. Very disappointed with the service.  If I come back, it will be for a slice of cheesecake to go! :)"
Kenjiro A.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,23,2,2.0,8/29/2016,"I can understand the long wait to get a table.  I can understand the long wait for the food.  I can forgive the server ending every sentence with ""my friend."" HOWEVER, i cannot forgive the luke warm food served.  I cannot forgive the rice served with the miso salmon not cooked all the way.  How do you screw up cooking steamed rice? Please get your kitchen together!"
Karla M.,"Cedar Crest, NM",1,13,38,4.0,10/11/2016,"If you come on weekend is a long wait of course but that's not a big deal, the service was a slow. The food was very delicious and their drinks too. Better be! Is pricy! The have a huge list of cheesecakes and they are good big slices you they can be shared. I had the bacon burger the slice of bacon are big and yummy the meat in the burger is prefect! Overall enjoyed it will return."
Bruce H.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,28,,3.0,2/20/2017,"This time was not quite as good. I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad with chicken. It was very tasty, but I could count on the fingers of one hand the bites of chicken that were in it. Also, they had some kind of screw up with our order and it was a fairly long wait to get the food. They came over and apologized, and even comp'd a piece of cheesecake for my companion to make amends. None of this would prevent me from returning, but it was a notch below my last visit."
Delilah L.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,56,257,5.0,3/6/2016,"This place is absolutely fantastic! The food selection, the drinks, the Happy Hour menu, and, of course, the desserts! To top it off, the atmosphere is lively. My husband and I love the bar area. This place is super popular and, therefore, super busy on the weekends so expect to wait. It's worth it! Recommendations: * Tamale corn cakes (appetizer) *Avocado eggrolls (appetizer)"
Matt G.,"Rio Rancho, NM",16,123,22,1.0,8/14/2016,"I can honestly say this was one of the most disappointing dining experiences we've had in a very long time.  The restaurant itself is nice, and our waitress was very good, but that's about it. The food was flavorless to be kind. We all tried something different so we could get a range of their menu, and none of us liked what we were served. We finished with the strawberry shortcake dessert, which was also lackluster, and looked quite a bit smaller than the one at the table next to ours. At this point there is no way I could recommend anyone going here. Maybe someday we'll give it another try, but with so many great local restaurants to choose from, why waste your time with an overrated chain."
J M.,"Clovis, NM",5,219,277,4.0,9/4/2016,Nice atmosphere and seating outside was great. Service prompt and attentive. Food was good. Came for brunch and got eggs Benedict and daughter got thai salmon. Pretty good..green sauce that came with salmon had a weird taste. Salmon glaze was super good though! Got salted carmel cheesecake..yum.
JD W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,122,212,4.0,4/10/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to different ones from different states. We had the warm crab and artichoke dip, salted caramel cheesecake, and tuxedo cheesecake. First off, you can't go wrong with cheesecake. We LOVED the salted caramel and the tuxedo cheesecake. Service was slow and just okay. The food was great."
Adrian G.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,51,28,4.0,10/1/2016,We liked our experience here. Very comparable to a place like elephant bar or an expensive chilis. The menu has like 15 pages so be prepared for lots of choices. Our waiter was great (which is important to us) and the ambiance of the restaurant is very cool. It is a little pricey though and there might be better value found other places. We will be back for dessert for sure though.
Trina J.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,12,4,3.0,9/15/2017,The food is very overpriced for the quality. The drinks are also pretty pricy. But the cheesecake is to die for... so good. The ambience is pretty nice too.
Holly C.,"Honolulu, HI",66,55,37,5.0,7/7/2016,"Service: we sat at the bar area, which is a fCFS deal. However our server was awesome!!!! So sweet and made sure that we were happy! Food: my sister and I shared the chicken Marsala! Holy cow it was delicious! There was for sure enough to share with two adults! Everything was great!"
Isabella C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",232,31,30,5.0,3/8/2016,"The wait was around 45 minutes, which is acceptable since it just opened. I ordered the salmon and it was delicious! Our waitress was a sweetheart and showed knowledge of the menu. I ordered the tuxedo cheesecake and I ate every last bite! I will be returning :)"
