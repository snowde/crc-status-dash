Mark D.,"Albuquerque, NM",23,4,1,2.0,8/3/2016,"A friend and I waited approximately 20 mins. to be seated, after advising the hostess that the first available table would be fine.  We had to let the hostess know that a table was available 10 minutes after our arrival. Our server was absolutely horrible. His lack of attention to our table was unfortunately painful. We had to waive our server down to let him know we wanted more iced tea and soda. He brought fresh luke warm tea without ice. Again we waived him down to advise that the tea wasn't ""iced tea"" as it was missing ice. We finished our meal and waited about 20 minutes before we, again, waived our server down to let him know we wanted our left overs placed in a to-go boxes. Keeping in mind that the restaurant was busy, our server walked passed our table six times prior to our getting his attention. We advised our server we wished to order a couple of slices of cheesecake, also to go. Another 15 minutes went by before we were served our desert on plates. We advised our server that it was supposed to be in to-go boxes.  Our server decided to throw a bit of attitude at us.  I took control of his attitude immediately and respectfully told him of our concerns regarding his serving skills.  Of course this just made him delay with providing our check.  I went to the bar and asked for the manager on duty.  After expressing my concerns to this gentleman, we received our check and were surprised that a discount for our inconvenience was not applied. The server was left with a $2.00 tip and a note suggesting he have a remedial course in proper serving procedures. My review is such:  1.  Initial wait time:  Within reason for time of day.  2.  Letting the hostess know if the available table unsatisfactory. 3.  Food quality and quality:. Excellent 4.  Server's attention to customer's needs: Completely Unsatisfactory. 5.  Discount for inconvenience and Server's unprofessional attitude:. Unsatisfactory As a General Manager for a Restaurant in Los Lunas, this experience was completely inexcusable and the server should be provided corrective action to correct is serving skills immediately and or be terminated. I do not recommend, at this time, eating here at peak hours.  Go on non-peak hours when service should be excellent. The food was fantastic. Props are due without hesitation. The plates provided plenty of food. It was almost too much."
Terie W.,"Albuquerque, NM",26,57,27,3.0,9/2/2016,"The food was good and was served warm.  The cheesecake was delicious as one would expect. The service was painfully slow.  I got there after my husband.  He had requested a high chair for our baby but they never brought one so I grabbed one that wasn't being used.  It was broken and unsafe to use.  The back of the high chair was loose and spinning.  I asked for a different one and this one also was loose and a bit wobbly.  For a restaurant at this price point and being fairly new, I really expected better equipment. The server took a long time to take our order.  It was getting to the point that I was about to walk over to the servers station and ask someone to come take our order.  Then she showed up.  After that our food came promptly and our drinks were refilled but it shouldn't have taken as long as it did to get the process started. I have been to other locations and this one was the loudest by far.  I may go back but it will be a while before I do."
K C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,19,5,3.0,3/23/2017,"Reserve a table online.  Our server, Dillon C, seemed very upset from the beginning. When he greeted our table, he didn't make eye contact, he shifted his weight several times, kept checking his watch, and was constantly combing his bangs to the side. Seemed rushed to clear the table as soon as possible. Forgot that it was a birthday dinner and didn't remember the birthday girl's name after asking.  There are so many selections that it's really difficult to decide on just one entree or sides. The selections are fantastic! The food is great. The desserts are excellent! Service was a total joke. When we were gathering the funds to pay the bill, money on the table was being accounted for each person. We had boxes and bags on the tabletop, when the server asked, ""I can take this right?"" and before we could respond he walked off with the money. The server took the money that was apart of the bill fund. We looked at each other in disbelief. Nice right."
Annette V.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,5,,3.0,4/11/2017,Went there for lunch to celebrate my grown daughter's birthday. The food was good but our waiter was slow and inattentive. There were long periods of time where we had no idea where he was. He only checked with us once during the meal to give us more water when our good arrived.
Josiah L.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,8/22/2017,It's always a treat when we eat here. Never had a problem with our food. The staff is always great too!
Jean C.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,85,427,5.0,7/24/2016,What a blast! I met my group of girls for my birthday lunch and Katie took great care of us. The avocado rolls were really good. I got the Evelyn's pasta dish which was yummy. They brought me my choice of cheesecake and sang happy birthday. Very sweet. The red velvet cheesecake is amazing. Go early! We met at 11:30am and there was no wait but it was packed as we were leaving. Long lines to get in.
Melissa G.,"White Rock, NM",32,129,276,4.0,1/22/2017,"This was our first time to this location. I've been to one in Vegas before. The wait wasn't too bad, but for it being early afternoon (2:15) it was already starting to get packed. Parking isn't too bad as you can always park further out or walk through the mall to get there as well. Our waitress, Melissa, was excellent. She was able to suggest different drinks and food options to us. Food portions are huge even if you order off the lunch specials. If you palm on coming make sure you have an appetite or you'll be taking some home. We had two small snacks, the fried zucchini and cubano rolls. Both excellent options. For our meals we had the lunch meatloaf, the pasta carbonara with chicken and the bacon bacon cheeseburger. You will not be disappointed with any of them. And for the meatloaf and pasta being the smaller portions we were still taking half of it home with us. And don't even get started on the cheesecake options. Too many to choose from that you will be tempted to take some to go to try later. Overall it was and excellent place to get food and drinks. Only drawback is the price for cocktails drinks. To me $10.50 is way too much though it was very good."
Mick M.,"Cortez, CO",0,30,9,2.0,3/19/2017,"Don't eat the Eggplant Parmesan!   It was very bitter and I had to send it back. They need to take it off the menu.   Got a burger instead.  However my wife's fish n chips was good.  I ate some of hers.  A bit pricey for what you get.  Service was OK.  It was late.  But if you want cheesecake and go up and pay for it yourself instead of having the server bring it to you and add it to the bill, expect a 15 minute wait  as the orders go to the servers, not the counter customers.  We had the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake.  Wow, it was great.  Expensive but very good."
Ricky M.,"Gilbert, AZ",197,632,23,3.0,4/26/2016,Cheese Cake Factory is the same no matter where you go except for Albuquerque as everyone knows when something new comes into town everyone has to run out and try it. The wait times are long here I came on a Friday around 4pm to try and beat the rush but there was still an hour + wait. The food is pretty good and they offer a huge selection and have just about everything you can think of. I was told the fish and chips were good so went with that they portions are huge and the food was great. I really enjoyed the avocado egg rolls. But for the amount of wait staff they have running around everywhere you would think the service would be top notch but service was lacking but I figure as time goes on that will improve as this is still a new restaurant. Also prices are a bit steep but overall worth it. Once service improves I will bump up my rating a star.
Keith K.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,1,,1.0,3/16/2017,"The problem with this place is the lack of consistency in both service and food prep. Starting with the hosts, sometimes the pagers work and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they try and find you and sometimes they don't and you end up waiting for a different table. Sometimes the waitstaff is good and sometimes they are lacking. Sometimes the food is what you remember from a cheesecake factory in a different city like Las Vegas (excellent) and sometimes it is definitely not. We've been here six times since they opened hoping that it would get better. It has not. We do not recommend this particular cheesecake factory."
Chris L.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,16,30,5.0,6/27/2016,"I have already become a regular here, because their food is amazing! My 1st dish was Steak Diane. The beef medallions were super tender and flavored with just the right amount of wine. The shiitake mushrooms were a flavorful addition. They paired it with homemade red skin mashed potatoes. My 2nd dish was the Hangar Steak, delicious! It is served with sautéed asparagus and wasabi mashed potatoes. Save room for dessert, because you will have the best cheesecake in the world, hence the name of the restaurant. Stick with the basic cheesecake with the fresh strawberries, pure perfection! The wait time is improving, since when they 1st opened. I'm looking forward to many more tasty meals!"
Matthew G.,"Boston, MA",13,3,2,1.0,6/18/2016,"Drinks are tiny and over priced at best. Margarita's come half glass full, with mostly ice. The service is good to poor at best. Plenty of better options in Albuquerque that provide better value."
Juanita L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,2.0,8/8/2017,"Went to this restaurant for the first time last weekend, and wasn't very impressed. After a 20 minute wait the hostess showed us to our table, and we had to wait 10 minutes for our waiter to come (which was understandable since it was fairly busy). After we got our drinks we placed our orders,  and our waiter said he would bring some bread to the table. We had to wait 50 minutes for our food to arrive, and we never got our bread during our wait. I ordered the orange chicken and my husband ordered the fish and chips. Both of our meals were very bland, and not worth the cost.After we finished our meals we finally got our bread order, which we didn't even want anymore by that point. I won't be going back to any of these restaurants since I don't feel the food is good enough to warrant the cost that it is."
Big E.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,12,,2.0,1/19/2017,"Disappointing. Service was great as our waiter was patient and attentive. He even comped the birthday cheesecakes. However, the food was not worth the high price. Our chicken and shrimp dish had obviously been under the heat lamp for awhile.   The cheesecakes we got were not good. We ordered their 30th anniversary cheesecake.  The chocolate truffle topping was hard, the cake portion stale and the cheesecake well past its ""best before"" date. Obviously these cakes had been in the dessert case too long. Perhaps CF needs fewer cheesecake choices so they rotate their stock a little quicker to provide the customer a better experience.  I'd recommend Flying Star or Range Cafe for a fresher, tastier dessert.  UPDATE:  Cheesecake Factory asked me to contact them through the website so they could better respond to my comment. I did. No response from Cheesecake Factory."
David M.,"Nashville, TN",2,1,,1.0,9/26/2016,"Let me preface this by saying I had worked for this organization for almost two years and took great pride in the food and customer service. I still work in the customer service industry in another capacity and understand that there are times when things are out of your control. And then there are other times when the experience is made poor because of a lazy or poor server. Unfortunately tonight a one star rating is being quite generous. We had a group of 13 guys out for dinner and drinks to celebrate a day off work. The service was poor at best, our server made no mention of any specials, prefaced by saying bread would take awhile to come out and assumed we all wanted water to drink when he first greeted the table. He simply could have asked our drink order and appetizer order and got the night started. Unprofessional table greet and start. Furthermore when we said we wanted to order some appetizers, he only took our liquor orders and then left. By the time he realized he hadn't taken the appetizer order (15min or so) we had decided to just place a food order. Instead of taking our food order when we said we weren't going to order our appetizers and just food, he walked away AGAIN to get our drinks instead of getting our food order. Furthermore upon delivering our drinks he made the comment to one of the guys ""that our drinks are strong so pace yourself, I don't want to have to cut you off""....not sure the reason for this unprofessional comment. After receiving our drinks we assumed the bread that was ""still cooking in the oven"" (as told to us by our server) would be coming shortly. Another 10 minutes passed. When the bread arrived it wasn't even hot. So either he was lying to us about the bread cooking or he was lazy. Furthermore he brought us enough bread for a group of 6 people...maybe. He asked for more bread and he only brought it to one end of the table.  With our food order in, we decided to have another round of drinks. Our server at this point made the comment that he couldn't allow us more than one drink per hour because he wouldn't want to cut us off. We had been here at the restaurant for over an hour and was on our 2nd round. Quite unprofessional and honestly uncalled for. We weren't even close to intoxicated and if anything super frustrated at the poor service we were receiving and yet STILL ordering $10-14 cocktails for our group. Finally after being told on 2 different occasions that our food would be right out, it arrived about 40min after our order. I can understood a groups long ticket time but instead of an apology for the wait or anything...maybe even a manager stopping by...we got nothing. On top of all of that, the guy who was paying for the entire meal did not get his food until everyone was FINISHED eating their meal. He ordered a burger :/ seriously  Our server said he'd try to make it up to us with a slice of cheesecake or something. And yet he didn't have a manager stop by to say sorry or do anything to make up for it. We had 13 people order dinner and 3 rounds of drinks. You do the math on the tab. Furthermore he didn't even do a dessert presentation or insist on the cheesecake slice because of his blunder with the burger. Finally after getting the check and getting ready to leave, the gentleman who was paying the tab for our company outing spoke to the manager on our way out the door. Her only response was ""I'm sorry.""  She offered to do NOTHING to accommodate the poor service and lackluster experience on a MONDAY night.  To say the ball was dropped on this experience would be a generously kind way of venting frustration. After having worked for the company in one of the top performing locations in the country for almost two years, I'm somewhat disgusted by the lack of care for the patrons and guest experience. Obviously ""ultimate guest satisfaction"" was not a core value of the management or staff we encountered.  It's unfortunate from a personal level because of how much time and energy I had given to this organization and yet to have my fellow co workers have this experience. Management please fix this."
Sara M.,"Albuquerque, NM",53,46,,4.0,7/4/2016,"Have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in years and I was pleasantly surprised! We ordered crab bites to share. For main dishes, my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and I ordered the shrimp scampi/steak combo. His orange chicken was really good! it tasted like they used fresh orange zest and I didn't feel like the breading was too thick. Rice was a little dry, but I imagine this is reheated or made in large batches. My food was also good. The scampi was not sopping in butter like at most chain restaurants and the steak was well cooked. No cheesecake this time, but we plan to go back! This last part is more of a personal complaint, but just FYI, the music on the patio was terrible! Very sappy/cheesy pop songs, similar to a soundtrack you'd hear in places like K-mart."
Jenn G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,29,1,3.0,5/15/2017,Got a  to go order based strictly on the reviews about bad service. Cheesecake was great. I ordered the avocado egg rolls....they were good but they didn't put a lid on the sauce served with them so it spilled all over the dish....how do they not have lids??? So that right there tells me a lot based on other reviews.
Felix L.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,14,16,5.0,4/17/2016,The wait was over an hour but if your patient it's worth the wait ! . most of the bad reviews are from impatient people. The service is good and the food is spectacular!
Crystal C.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,3,1,1.0,4/9/2016,Me and my husband went into the Cheesecake Factory yesterday afternoon around 2:30pm. We were asked to sit on the patio. It was a nice warm day and they had the outside heaters on regardless so we were hot sitting out there. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. We waited 20-25 mins and got our entrees.. Then 5-10 mins later the appetizer came. Our waitress acted like this was no big deal and just offered to box up our uneaten appetizer since we were no longer hungry for it. I paid for the entire meal but I won't go back! It's not ok to bring the appetizer after I've eaten half my entree!
M.j. G.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,18,3,2.0,7/22/2017,"We went for Sunday brunch. Very expensive and food is average. Huevos rancheros with black beans? Black beans aren't New Mexican, but restaurants continue to shove them at us instead of pinto beans. Know your customers. Very disappointing after all the hype. Cheesecake is their strength. We took home 1/2 original, 1/2 chocolate mousse, which were excellent. We'll stick to Monica's and The Range for Sunday brunch."
