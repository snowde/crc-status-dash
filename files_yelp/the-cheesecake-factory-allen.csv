Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284,5.0,11/30/2017,"Why do they have to offer curbside to go?!! It's my downfall, oh and the fact that Favor (app food delivery service) will deliver them to your door!! I've been known to pack my jammie clad little ones into the car in the evening because Mommy is craving a slice of cheesecake. I've even found myself stuck home while hubby is on a business trip and I don't want to cook dinner so, Favor to the rescue! We're having Cheesecake Factory for dinner. And maybe a slice or two of cheesecake too. One thing you can absolutely say about CF is their portions do not leave you hungry.  I've recently enjoyed... + Beets w/Goat Cheese salad - fresh, tasty and great portion + Chicken Samosas - great portion of chicken, the flavor and spice are right on. Do yourself a favor and ask for extra Cilantro dipping sauce  + Thai Lettuce Wraps are my favorite - this can easily be a meal, not just an appetizer. There is a great amount of chicken and toppings and the spicy Thai sauces are YUMMY! + Avocado Egg Rolls - divine. Crunchy outside, perfectly cooked inside. Also make sure to ask for extra dipping sauce, it's really tasty + Chinese Chicken Salad - it's HUGE! I request keeping the Rice Noodles off as they just overwhelm the bowl and have zero taste.  + Kids Grilled Cheese - my boys love this one. It's a full size grilled cheese presented in a kid-friendly and appealing way. Plus their fries are so good you'll want to eat them too. And of course Cheesecake. Currently I have three favorites, the Celebration Cheesecake, the S'mores Cheesecake and the new Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme Cheesecake. Insert drool emoji here."
Terri J.,"McKinney, TX",130,339,570,2.0,12/13/2017,"I do not get the fascination with this place. The menu consists of 100 items and absolutely none of them are executed well. The only thing decent here is usually the appetizer bread, which on the past two visits has been cold. We arrived at 4:45 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. You'd think that would be an ok time to be seated immediately. Nope. Fifteen minute wait, due to having zero staff until 5 pm. I could understand that if it was only open 5 pm until whenever, but it's open 11 am to whenever.  We get seated and our server, a middle aged lady, whom is very nice but very slow, takes forever to come to us. By the time she gets there, we give her our drink and food order. We've been there for about twenty minutes just sitting. I tried something new: It was chicken parm ""pizza"". While we waited, the bread came. It was cold. We waited for her to reappear to ask for heated bread, but she didn't come back until our food was ready.  Talk about disappointment. First off, that pasta Alfredo goop in the middle was beyond gross. Snot like consistency and bland and the chicken parm pizza was just weird as it wasn't at all like what it was described as. It was just a huge piece of chicken parm. That's all. It's supposed to be nuts of chicken mixed with breadcrumbs and blah blah...nope. It was just chicken parm super-sized. That would have been fine had even that tasted good, but nope. The bottom was burnt, so you know how that taste permeates everything?  Needless to say I'm not a fan. I might come back for dessert but not for dinner."
Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245,4.0,11/21/2017,"To start they'll bring you some sourdough and pumpernickel bread with real butter.  It's a great start to your meal.  If you've never been, here's what you need to do. Ignore the menu, your eyes will fall out as it is huge. You should choose from the Shepherds Pie, the Meatloaf or the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  Start there, you won't be disappointed unless you like bland food.  On top of that, they have cheesecake! Some of the best cheesecake around.  Do yourself a favor and don't come here on Friday or Saturday night from 6-8p or you'll be waiting that whole time to get a table."
guy h.,"Dallas, TX",93,572,1397,4.0,1/9/2018,"Ok so it's a big chain but, I have to admit it's one with consistently good food served by smiling staff in generous portions. I had the meatloaf and was blown away! The flavors are superb and the portion huge. Served with a corn vegetable medley that was popping hot and outstanding. The mashed potatoes are as good as it gets. It's all topped with a high quality beef gravy. The pre meal bread is addictive and the extensive selection of heart-stopping cheese cake slices is astonishing.  So, while prices may seem high, it's justified by the quality and quantity you receive."
Jessica B.,"McKinney, TX",45,33,74,4.0,11/5/2017,"After a bit of shopping went to get a bite at Cheesecake Factory.  I've never have a bad experience at CF unless you count waiting for a table at some of the locations can take up to an hour.  I usually order the Jambalaya extra spicy but considering it was lunch (and it is one of the items that you can't order half portion)  I decide to try something new.  I order the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken (lunch portion) and had them make it a little spicier. It had a nice crunch, heat, and sweetness with mango pieces and loved the snow peas.   Cheesecake Factory give huge portions - so you definitely need to make sure before ordering too much food.  We def were too full to order a delicious cheesecake at the table.  My number 1 pick is the White  Chocolate  Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake! So good and travels home just fine."
Precious M.,"Menifee, CA",74,7,1,2.0,12/18/2017,"Usually I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the service and food at this location is starting to get bad. Last night when I came I ordered the steak/medium and it came out burnt. I didn't want to send it back because I don't like sending back my food. But I was highly disappointed"
Tokyo C.,"Garland, TX",30,189,467,3.0,9/11/2017,Third time here over the last year and I don't know if it's just me but the cheesecake servings seem to be shrinking!!! Good for my waistline but for $8.50 a slice I'm disappointed.  Coffee was good and strong.  Loved the lemon raspberry cheesecake and my8 yr old liked the original cheesecake.  Lemon raspberry was just the right amount of tart and raspberry was just the right amount of sweet. Really hit the spot tonight for my cheat day. Back to no carbs tomorrow.
Norah J.,"Plano, TX",38,67,291,1.0,4/7/2017,"I got steak dinner last night and have been sick all morning with terrible cramps, diarrhea since 5am, cld not stand up. It's a heart breaking. I miss work bcos of Cheesecake Factory dinner and strawberry cheesecake. I'm trying to figure out which one was contaminated. This is a sad sad experience for me. And will be reporting this.  I understand that you guys want me to contact you but I'm okay today, was furious about what I went through, and don't need any gift cards from you. I will not report this like I said earlier on my review.  Will stay away from that location. I will be visiting the one on Preston rd.  I love cheesecake  by the way."
Israel J.,"Austin, TX",28,29,64,1.0,8/26/2017,"I called Saturday evening to see if they would be able to accommodate a party of 19. The twat that answered the phone told us that we needed to be there for him to give us that info... We didn't want to bring everyone over to see what their wait time was, we asked again and were told that there were a 3 hour wait. We went to Brio instead, ran a tab of $1300. We walked over by this restaurant on the way, it was half empty"
Julia M.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,1,2.0,1/1/2018,"Came In to grab a slice of cheese cake to go.... what I thought would be quick took 23 minutes. It was chaos, orders aren't sent out in the order they were taken so others behind me received their order first. When I questioned why other order were sent out before mine they manager on duty was rude and rude ignored me. 2 stars because the cheese cake is good."
Angela T.,"Raymore, MO",30,37,14,3.0,11/26/2017,"I was a first timer here and had the catfish with corn succotash.  The catfish was ""ok"" but the corn was shaved from the cob.  Someone forgot to take the silks off of it prior to cooking it.  With the lighting so low I took a big bite of what felt like hair in my mouth and spit it out.  HUGE quarter size ball of silks from the corn... so gross.  Waitress was attentive though and promptly took it off our check.  I did try the cheesecake and it was wonderful just wish the dinner entree after a 50 min wait to get a table would have matched it :/"
Chesley E.,"Allen, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"This place is way overpriced and the food is very disappointing compared to the price. Drinks cost about $3, which is a lot more compared to most other places, but they do allow for refills. I had the spaghetti and was disappointed about it. It comes at a price of $17. Quantity wise, the spaghetti is pretty alright, but quality wise it's taste is not as pleasing. The waiter also did not offer me any parmesan cheese for my spaghetti."
Drey R.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",179,12,38,1.0,7/7/2017,"Two of the five people in my party had to wait, at least, 15 additional mins for their food due to an obvious error by the waiter. As expected, the food was average. At the end of the meal the manager came by to apologize with the check in hand. I was very nice and didn't make a big deal out of the error because I did not want to negatively affect the mood of the table. With that, the manager must have decided she did not need to make any reparations for the error. She then took the check she had in her hand and the waiter returned with a check at 100% of the cost. It couldn't have been more obvious. I grew up in the restaurant business and I am never looking for a free meal but at the very minimum I would have offered to buy coffee, a dessert or an appetizer at the next meal to make up for the inconvenience."
Darlin F.,"Allen, TX",7,19,,2.0,8/28/2017,Typical cheesecake factory as probably everywhere else. Long waiting on busy evening and good service.  The desert as always is superb and the steak we get is a bit off. Medium rare is more like well done. Will go to the other location in Frisco to try next time.
Lillian K.,"Frisco, TX",2,73,188,4.0,7/1/2017,Had a great lunch today. Service was nice and food came out quickly. Bread was nice and fresh. My four cheese pasta was yummy my friends enjoyed their meals today as well!
Amanda R.,"New Braunfels, TX",46,29,4,4.0,10/14/2017,"We sat at the bar high tops and had superb service from Wyatt! We come here for dessert a few times a year and I never bother writing a review but had to do so for Wyatt, he was great. If you sit at the bar find his section he will take great care of you. The food is good the chocolate cake is why I went, pumpkin cheesecake is why other members of our party went. Either way you can't go wrong with dessert here."
F A.,"Plano, TX",0,13,9,1.0,4/14/2017,"So we arrive there last night and ask for a table for two, hostess said it would be 15 minutes. That's fine, so talking with a buddy and we're waiting, the little beeper goes off and we go to the counter waiting to be seated.  We are out at a table and sit down, first thing I notice is all the cutlery is dirty. I mean this looks disgusting. We should have honestly left at that point, but we order our appetizers and drinks.  Fried macaroni balls and avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg roll sauce sounded good on the menu, we get this black bubbly liquid that was awful. The fried cheese macaroni appetizer wasn't much better, it was burnt on the outside and undercooked pasta on the in. I order chicken teriyaki and brown rice and my friend orders that truffle honey chicken. We were both planning on dessert but when I bit into my chicken it tasted wet and cold. Skin was still attached and it felt like it was frozen before boiled and teriyaki sauce dumped on it. It wasn't good at all. I went into the restroom and had to throw up from it. There was jasmine rice and something diced and put on the side that looked like chopped onions, something stuck there beside the chicken that was burnt along with the outside of the chicken skin but the inside wasn't cooked all the way through. I just let it sit there on the plate after that first bite and a manager walked by several times we tried to flag but it was too busy.  The waitress offered to box it up for us. I don't know how you can remove all flavor from the chicken while still undercooking it. We left without the to go boxes, I don't think I'll ever come back to this location."
Alan C.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/23/2017,"I had the WORST experience of my life tonight with a curbside to-go order.   When the order for my family was placed at 6:15 p.m., I was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I arrived at 6:35 p.m., parked in the designated area and called to have my order brought out.  I was told that it would be brought out in just a minute.   TWENTY minutes later, still no food delivered!  My wife called the restaurant and spoke to a female manger who said that she would check what was holding up my order.  Now I have been waiting in the parking lot for THIRTY minutes without food or a follow-up call/visit from any manager.   Finally, a server who brought out someone ELSE'S order, (!) stopped at my car to ask my name and if I had an order!!!  I told her the story and she finally brought out my order ... 45 minutes AFTER I arrived and 65 minutes after the order was placed! Just to add insult to injury, NO manager or server even apologized or made any attempt to correct/comp the situation.   TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!   I used to enjoy table dining at the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, I'm not sure I EVER want to bring my family there again! You either perform a service correctly, or you do NOT offer it at all.  They FAILED on ALL counts tonight!"
Nargiz K.,"McKinney, TX",61,92,301,5.0,3/24/2017,"This is one of my favorite places to bring international visitors to. They can try original cheesecake and enjoy the ambiance... I also love coming here for a co-workers lunch and with my family. The cheesecake factory is always a solid place to eat.  The view outside is so amazing! The wait can be a bit much sometimes. The location is super nice, the service is great. Portions are huge. I love their salads. My favorite is chicken,mango, avocado salad."
M. T.,"Allen, TX",0,23,,1.0,7/30/2017,"I'm there about noon for a to go order of cheesecake. If you're going to sell me a frozen slice of cheesecake, at least WARN me!!!"
A. Laura M.,"Dallas, TX",41,221,876,4.0,8/31/2016,"Pretty busy place during lunch hours , we went in for our Dr's birthday lunch today 8-31-16 staff was nice and checked on us constantly and kept up with our refills. I had the orange chicken was good and had alot in it."
Michelle H.,"Dallas, TX",14,25,10,5.0,7/31/2016,"Not sure why there are some bad reviews here, but the couple of times I've been here the experience has been great! Mind you I've only been here for lunch. My brother got the Louisiana Chicken which he said was delicious! I got the Factory Nachos.. and I had no idea the portion was going to be HUGE! It probably could've filled up 2~3 people. Gladly took leftovers home.  Our waitresses I've had were very nice!  They had half off cheesecakes for National Cheesecake Day (which was yesterday). We had to wait 30 minutes for indoor seating, which we waited and got seated promptly. It was a bit chaotic, but it was still worth it! I'm not sure if the staff is different during dinner time, but during lunch my experience at this location has always been great!"
Dan J.,"Plano, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Decided to eat here as it was close to the theater we were going. Upon our arrival at 7pm on a Saturday we thought for sure our wait would be at lest 1/2hr. We were surprised the restaurant was not full and our wait was only 5 min.  After our meal it was clear why there were few people at the restaurant.  We ordered Shelia's chicken & avocado salad and the chicken salad sandwich.   The lettuce in the salad  was all romaine vs mixed greens, had lots of carrots and very little avocado and cilantro. The chicken, however, was moist but sparse.  We asked for the salad to be served with dressing on the side. Salad was delivered with no dressing. Took 5-8 minutes to receive the dressing. Not what you would expect for a $15 salad.  The chicken salad sandwich turned out to be more of a tomato & lettuce sandwich as there was more tomato than chicken salad on the sandwich.  Not what you would expect for $13. Rip-off! We didn't bother contacting the Mgr as we never saw them in our area/section checking on customer's satisfaction.  Our 2nd choice fire roasted fresh artichoke appetizer was fantastic. Our 1st choice ahi tartar was not available as they were out of ahi.  Not a restaurant we will return to anytime soon."
Dawn C.,"Addison, TX",36,20,23,1.0,5/14/2017,Would give this place negative stars if i could.  Long waits. Waited well over an hour for our food. The table next to us was seated 30 mins after us and received their food way before us. this was after an hour wait for the table (which we were somewhat expecting).  Staff slammed plates and even spilled ice tea all over my dad's pants/leg without even acknowledging let alone apologizing and he clearly saw the spill.  Mediocre food at best.  Got the grilled salmon which tasted like had a tub of salt poured on it Take your business elsewhere as it's not appreciated here. We will not be back.
Missy D.,"Mount Airy, NC",12,113,19,4.0,11/4/2016,"Went in for takeout and ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad and a slice of the dulce de leche cheesecake... mmmmm.  Cheesecake.  The salad was HUGE.  Veggies were fresh and the BBQ Ranch part is referring to the dressing, not the chicken.  The fried onion strings were yummy!  Overall, I could've used another serving of dressing since the salad was about two huge servings.  My order came with rolls (wheat or sourdough) and butter.  Everything was packaged up nicely and I had my order ready in about 10 minutes."
Jay L.,"Garland, TX",678,424,71,4.0,8/22/2016,"I received a gift card for my B-day last month and had spent several days finishing the floors and painting in my home so I figured a free meal was in order.  Decor          4 stars  Service        3.5 stars Food            4.5 stars Value          3 stars Its a nice looking place, a cut above other chains. The tables are a tad small so I was happy I was alone. I find many places have these small tables, it bothers me.  I was seated promptly as I arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon. The gal seating me was neither mean or friendly just seemed unhappy. The waitress was of similar disposition. It didnt bother me as she was attentive and I was enjoying being alone. I ordered an Arnold Palmer which was served very cold rimmed with sugar. I really like this as the Grand Lux is the only other place I have had it served this way. It was a great drink. The bread was not toasted well which makes sour dough very chewy. It was not good. I ordered the lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs and it was very good and the right amount of food.  Well it is the Cheesecake factory so it doesnt make sense to me to go there and not have a slice for dessert. (Also why the lunch portion was ordered)  I had the Mango Key Lime slice with a cup of coffee. It was delicious!!!! The macaroon crust with a layer of shredded coconut made me smile.  I did feel it was a bit over-priced at $31 bucks. I left the $25 gift card and $12 dollars. Overall it was a very nice early dinner."
Dee T.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,14,,2.0,6/5/2017,"My sister and i decided to come here for late dinner. I was really hungry so we ordered really fast, I'm not sure the dish name but it was with pasta on the side and sautéed chicken with veggies. It tasted pretty good until my sister saw hair inside the sauce ... I wasn't even going to say anything but the waitress walked beside us right at that time. She apologized and took the plate back telling me they will make me another one. I waited for a while for them to remake it my sister even finished her food by the time mine came , not to mention i was pregnant and VERY hungry and had to end up eating alone. Later manager came and apologized and that was it. They never gave or offered anything not that i expected but my sister was surprised. Food is good service is not."
Roy P.,"Allen, TX",3,6,,4.0,7/24/2017,"This place never disappoints. I try to order something different each time, and so far everything is prepared perfectly. The prices are higher, but what you're paying for is the service and atmosphere, not just the food. Always a great place whether for dinner or a simple outing for dessert."
Cynthia F.,"Richardson, TX",0,29,11,3.0,7/14/2017,Ordered the skinny chicken tacos. Good but not great. My friend had the bone in NY steak medium rare. They did a great job cooking it to his liking. The mash potatoes are very good. True to form portions are super large. We love leftovers
Sarah V.,"McKinney, TX",22,3,,1.0,9/25/2017,"My 1 yr kibash of this restaurant ended recently.  The ban was because of repeated bad customer service.  Went there last Saturday, early evening, with my daughters.  Was told there was a 15-20 minute wait, not bad for a Saturday evening.  Was given a pager and we sat 5 ft from the hostess stand.  After about 20 minutes, I noticed that people who came in after us were being seated, I asked the hostess.  Was told, very rudely ""We tried paging you a long time ago"", uh, no you didn't ""but we have immediate seating outside.  Great, I'll take it.  The hostess tried to sit us at a table covered in bird poo.  NASTY!  Told her we couldn't sit there, not going to make my daughters eat of feces.  She tried to sit us at another table that was worse.  Commented, hoping that she would remedy the issue...have someone clean it up, sanitize us, get us the next table inside.  Nope, that was obviously too much to ask.  My comment was met with a blank stare, i opted to leave.  If a restaurant cares so little about their customers, as I have experienced multiple times over at this facility, I don't need to go there anymore.  Perma-ban of this one.  There are way too many restaurants in the area to subject my family to a restaurant that wants you to eat in poo and be treated rudely."
Xzabria I.,"Dallas, TX",0,13,,1.0,6/12/2017,Waitress was horrible and so was the manager! I complained my food wasn't cooked thoroughly and tasted rubbery. She picked it up and said sorry and bagged it to go. I asked for the manager. He was extremely rude. Took the plate off the table and didn't offer to have it made properly. In fact he asked what did I mean by rubbery. Wtf you don't know what rubbery means sir??? Won't be back. That experience has turned me off from Cheesecake Factory period.
Roy T.,"Lewisville, TX",12,4,5,1.0,9/3/2017,Came to Cheesecake Factory even after having a poor experience before this time not only did everything come out wrong and then they could not process my card and I had to walk to an ATM to get money to pay them. Needless to say I will not be coming back to
Chris W.,"McKinney, TX",2664,646,963,4.0,12/30/2014,"I have to say our server was amazing.  He was very friendly and had a way of entertaining the boys.  If we go back we would definitely ask to sit in his section.  (if only I would have got his name) I get overwhelmed when a menu is a book.  I have no idea what to order when there are that many choices.  I ordered the nachos, bad mistake.  They were not good.  The menu said it came with salsa and they did not have salsa.  It's kind of hard to each nachos without salsa.  The cheese was also gloppy and not evenly melted.    My boys got the spaghetti with meatballs and Fettucini Alfredo.  They were both pleased. Now, its called the cheesecake factory and that was the amazing part of the meal.  We ordered the Tuxedo Cheesecake.  It is layered with fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, and vanilla and chocolate mouse.  It was AWESOME!"
Michele B.,"Plano, TX",30,27,10,1.0,2/5/2017,"Worst experience ever! Normally the staff at the Cheesecake Factory is friendly and welcoming! NOT TODAY! Our waitress was unfriendly, abrasive and curt! When I asked to have the left overs packaged she came and dropped a box and bag ion the table. I would understand if the restaurant was overly busy or something, however that was not the case today.... needless to say her tip reflected the mediocre treatment!"
Cherie N.,"Allen, TX",27,8,,5.0,5/16/2017,"To die for Avocado Toast!  Ordered to go and it was so yummy!  It was enough for two meals, if you weren't sharing.  Loved the bread and the avocados were ripe, not overly or under, but perfect."
Jim B.,"Rowlett, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Ok. It's been 6 months and thought I'd give them another try at making some Bang bang Chicken and Bang bang Shrimp.  Good news is that they didn't overcook it this time... but then i gave the to-go person plenty of warning.  I was NOT intetested in writing a bad review.  I wanted to enjoy that GREAT delicious Bang bang like we used to do 5 years ago.   But, alas,  just as bad as over cooking  is that the flavor just isn't there any more.  My wife said she thought her BBChicken tasted bitter.  She couldn't eat it.  She tried a little sugar on it.  Didn't help.  In the trash it went .. $25 down the drain.  Stick a fork in us cause we're done.  No more Cheese Cake Factory."
Autumn H.,"Lubbock, TX",6,35,31,3.0,1/9/2017,"Today was my first time ever going to The Cheesecake Factory... It may have been what I ordered, but I wasn't impressed. I got a pepperoni pizza. The cheese on the pizza was overly stringy and greasy with not much flavor. The pepperoni was small. The bread and butter was good but it took so long to get to the table that I thought there was no complimentary appetizer! We got the tamale cake as another appetizer. It was decent but I wish that it had meat! Our waiter took forever to bring me a box. The redeeming quality of this restaurant was the cheesecake because... how can a place be called The Cheesecake Factory and not have good cheesecake? I got the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was super yummy. The cheesecake was served with extra whipped cream. Cheesecake Factory is good but I would ONLY go there for their desserts -- I don't care much for their regular food."
Phil Q.,"McKinney, TX",34,96,167,5.0,2/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has the best cheesecakes ever! I'm on a mission to try every single cheesecake. I'm just gonna jump right into dessert. I had the lime cheesecake, and it was creamy, lemony, and sweet! Pure perfection! I also had the Cuban sandwich with cold cuts, sauerkraut, cheese, mustard and mayo, I think, but it was savory, sour and delicious. Too bad they don't have a variety of soups, I would like some soups. FOOD: 5/5 SERVICE: 5/5 AMBIANCE: 5/5 PRICE: $$"
Diane D.,"Rockwall, TX",323,384,282,5.0,1/10/2017,"Gawd I love this place!  You just can't go wrong eating here.  We seem to come here every year to celebrate my son's birthday and always try to get something different from the last time.  They have a HUGE selection of food to choose from.  Two pages of appetizers alone!  Burgers, salads, healthy entrees, not-so-healthy entrees and of course, decadent desserts!!!  By the time we're done eating, we're always too full for dessert but that doesn't stop us from ordering cheesecake to go!  Food portions are huge!  Most places that charge $17 for an entree will not give you as much food as you get here.  A great value for your money in my opinion.  Be sure to pack your patience if you come on a weekend night.  We had a 45 minute wait which wasn't all that bad but if you come around 8:30 at night, you can get right in without much of a wait.  Service was excellent as always.  Never any complaints coming here!"
Gloria C.,"Allen, TX",159,213,633,5.0,12/11/2015,"It's always packed here, but my husband and I came here late on a Sunday night so it wasn't too bad. Wait time for 2 was about 10-15 minutes so at least it was true  to what they said it would be. I hate it when they say it's 30 minutes and it's more like 45 to an hour. I'd rather them lie and say it would take longer and be called earlier than to be late, but perhaps that's just me. You're always welcome to make reservations.  Atmosphere: There's dim lighting, but decor is always extravangant but not too gaudy. It can be loud because of the amount of customers they have. The place has always been clean for me.  Service: Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She came over just enough times to meet our needs without being too overbearing or seem liked she was ignoring us.  Food: I'm always a fan of the complimentary bread and butter. Their dishes are definitely big so it's a good idea to share. My husband and I had the Thai Chili wraps and the shepherd's pie. The wraps are so good and it's huge so it can easily be your meal. You get 5-6 pieces of lettuce, accompanied with marinated and grilled chicken slices, and you can dress it with pickled cucumbers, thai noodles, carrot slices, and bean sprouts. You also get 3 sauces to choose from; sweet, peanut sauce, and spicy. I sometimes throw it all together. This dish can get messy, but it's all good. The pie was so comforting to eat on a cold evening. I feel as if the mashed potatoes encase the rest of the ingredients so well that it keeps the dish warm with every bite and everything is so flavorful. I found myself still picking at it even after I was already full. We were too full for cheesecake this time, but perhaps next time.  I need to try other foods next time, but that's what I said the last time that I was here. I can't stay away from my favorites. Until next time Cheesecake Factory."
