Tom H.,"Collin, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/21/2009,"Denny's with a bar. Terrible, just terrible. 2 mediocre en trees and 3 glasses of wine for $120 with tip?!?? To think we could have gone to Bob's Steak and Chophouse for the same price."
Viren A.,"Wylie, TX",0,3,,4.0,1/3/2011,"Went to cheesecake factory for deserts. I had ordered original cheesecake (classic), linda's fudge cake (amazing), and black out cake (very good). Price per slice is $7 but actually two people can easily share the slice since they are quite heavy. Surely try them if you like to have deserts after your meal."
