Carla S.,"Allen, TX",2,172,1,4.0,11/19/2015,"I've had the beef medallions off their skinny menu twice recently. The last time, the beef was a little too salty but it was still excellent! Portions were just right and I'll be back. Great customer service (even when it was just me) and the food delivery was timed perfectly. Both times we sat overlooking the pond and I really enjoyed that too."
Valencia J.,"Dallas, TX",171,224,1243,3.0,8/24/2014,"We arrived late afternoon on a Saturday. Surprisingly, the wait was less than 10 minutes. I was disappointed to discover they no longer make the Crispy Spicy Beef. And for such a vast menu, I couldn't really find anything I wanted. I got the teriyaki chicken, still love the grilled bananas that come with this dish. I also ordered the Killer Bee; it was extremely sweet; so sweet I almost couldn't drink it (and I have a serious sweet tooth). The ice cubes were sprinkled with nutmeg or some type of spice. Husband ordered the shrimp scampi & steak diane. He was a little surprised that it was only 3 pieces of steak and 3 shrimp. We got a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go. With only 3 strawberries and 2 globs of whipped cream, we weren't happy that it didn't have any strawberry sauce on it.  All in all, a typical CF meal. Nothing special. Service was fine. Don't like sitting in the crammed seat right beside others."
Ruth N.,"Wylie, TX",0,12,25,5.0,2/14/2015,I love Cheesecake Factory !! They have the largest menu and execute each dish I have ever had very well !!! We always save room for dessert and the banana cream cheese is the best !!!! I love this place
Carl W.,"Allen, TX",18,43,93,4.0,9/29/2015,Here again.   Happy hour is so great.  Thanks to our waiter.   Sorry no pictures this time.
Jessica W.,"Houston, TX",187,396,6,2.0,5/12/2014,"Walking in I saw empty seats inside the restaurant everywhere,  but the host (who was not groomed very professionally) told us to sit outside or risk a wait. We sat outside and were greeted by a very listless server named Lauren/laura, who lacked any ounce of enthusiasm, was dressed and groomed unprofessionally as well (was she wearing white vans?), and did not say thank you or your welcome the entire duration of our stay. Took her forever to get out the bread,  and when the food runners brought out the food it was sad that the lunch portions have diminished quite a bit. I swear we get more at the frisco location.  Food quality however was the same. The amount we get though doesn't seem to justify it as a 'lunch special'. We've been to this location plenty of times before and this was the most disappointing visit I've had here."
Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,5.0,10/12/2014,"THE RESTAURANT--You and I have both been to a restaurant that after being seated we ask why are we here. There is no intrigue and the place might as well be part of a haunted house. Not this Cheesecake Factory location. This is a location that you can be comfortable when taking your spouse, your girl friend or business client to lunch or dinner. The inside if the restaurant if very nice with dark woods on the seats and counters and light pastel colors on the walls and ceiling. Just a very nice setting in which to enjoy your food. Parking is scarce out front of the restaurant and more than likely you will have to find a space in the parking garage just a few feet to the south. Parking is free. The rest room for men is nice but very small. There is only one commode and one urinal for men in a restaurant of this size which probably does not meet code standards.  THE FOOD   I have been here many times and I have decided I concentrated too much on things other than the food. We started with some fresh iced tea and coffee. I must have gotten the first glass of iced tea and it was perfect with a  deep tea flavor that had not been watered down by having sat in ice for an hour. The coffee was freshly brewed and as good a cup as you can get even if purchased at a  coffee shop. Bread was brought to the table and that was a loaf of white and a loaf of dark wheat bread with real butter in the basket. The breads were excellent. Today we ordered for lunch, the Herb Crusted Salmon, mashed new potatoes and asparagus with the salmon being covered with a not too overpowering lemon sauce. The salmon was some of the best we have ever tasted and the lemon sauce made the presentation excellent. The lemon sauce is a little tart nevertheless delicious. The piece of salmon was about 1 1/2 inch thick with the size being most generous. The asparagus was crisp and tender and cooked perfectly as were the new mashed potatoes. THE SERVICE   Was met at the hostess counter by a nice hostess who asks where we would like to sit. That was a first time we have ever been ask where we like to sit at this location and we chose a small booth, which we were promptly, taken to. The waiter was outstanding in taking our order and most efficient in brining our food as quickly as it was prepared. The food was still very hot as was the plate on which it was being served. PRICING    The menu at a Cheesecake Factor is extensive. We had decided on the herb crusted salmon at $19.95 when the waiter ask if we desired the lunch portion or dinner portion. There was a $6.00 difference in the price thus lunch was only $13.95. We opted for the lunch portion and that was plenty of food. The menu had dozens and dozens of items on it and is actually like a loose leaf notebook. It will take sometime to browse through the entire ""book"". If you are there during lunch hours (7 days a week) be sure and ask about the lunch menu.  Today was a great ding experience with very good food at a very reasonable price. We highly recommend this location. Trust you get all the same as we did."
Ray M.,"Richardson, TX",0,11,,4.0,12/31/2015,"I love the food here, large portions and great flavor. The deserts are massive, you could easily share with 4 people. The only issue is my family and I decided to visit the location in Allen Tx the good customer service was defiantly lacking that night. It started with us being seated in an area where there was no server. I sat and waited hoping to at least be acknowledged and brought water but nothing happened. A table right next to us with two couples were greeted and brought drinks right away (they were sat 15 minutes after we were), I knew from that moment something was not right, went to retrieve a manager and got a bad attitude from one of the employees seating customers. In the end Todd and David McKinney (both managers) came to the rescue and continuously apologized and our delicious desserts were on the house. The cared about our experience and wanted to make sure we return."
Courtney W.,"McKinney, TX",53,37,15,4.0,8/22/2015,"Known for their cheesecake... Obviously. Went on a Saturday night around 7:30 and was seated almost right away. Plenty of seating. The ambience is a little too dark, though the decor is rad and fun.  The menu is a bit overwhelming because it's a book. About 20 pages. Though they do have a lot to offer, you'll just need about 10 uninterrupted minutes to read through it. I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad-yum! My husband had the Parmesan chicken that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The beans were a bit heavy on the lemon flavor but overall a fantastic dish. Both items could be shared-large portions. Finished with the snickers cheesecake... Yum yum yum! (Comes loaded with whip cream so ask your server to go easy on it if you're not a huge fan). Service was average, but then again, I think part of serving is conversing with your table rather than just taking orders. Anyone can do that.  Great place to go every once and awhile."
Shannen C.,"Vallejo, CA",169,46,15,4.0,7/17/2015,We ended up going here because they seated us faster than Grimaldis. They are insanely fast when it comes to cooking. We ordered calamari and it literally came in 10 minutes. The pasta I got was chicken and shrimp with scampi sauce. It was a little salty for me and good thing I halfedw with another person because I couldn't even finish it.
Travis B.,"Allen, TX",133,65,28,4.0,2/28/2014,"Plenty of Gluten Free options gremlins. The Gluten Free menu, will leave you with so many options you really cant go wrong.  Also the one Cheesecake that is GF is the Chocolate Godiva.  Be warned though each choice will leave you with a full tummy, but over the top calorie count which for many might be a bad thing, but for some a good thing.  Getting seated is the easy part, but it seems even on slow nights the service is lacking.   Our waitress was just in her own fairly land, yes we got our drinks and food, but she sure was slow at it.  Onto the food I decided to get the 5 egg omelette, bacon, onion, peppers and cheese and that  thing is huge.  This Omelette was amazing start to finish, my wife had the Parmesan crusted chicken which comes in a massive portion, so for the price of the food you get alot and you can split this up and not eat it all if you dont have to.  Overall still enjoy the food and the atmosphere! :) Just something to add if your a Lord Of The Rings/Hobbit Fan  The Lights on the booths look like the Eye Of Sauron"
Molly V.,"Plano, TX",2,64,2,4.0,11/21/2014,"I've always been a fan of TCF, and have always suggested it when a group of us go out.  This one location is the only one I have issues w/.  Last Sat. a group of 9 of us went and altho it was cold outside, it was a sauna inside there!  We had to go outside to cool off.  I asked that they turn down the heat, and they did, but it just took a while for it to come down.  When I stood up to walk outside, a cockroach crawled out from under the table.  I stood there saying, ""cockroach, cockroach"" until a server killed it. The mgr came over and told me they would be calling ECon (OK), but it didn't matter.  I kept wondering if there were any more going to crawl from under our table.  I was uncomfortable the rest of the night. On another occasion, I order gluten free and at the bottom of my mashed potatoes, were strings of spaghetti!  What's wrong w/ this location, I have no idea!"
Shahzaib Q.,"Allen, TX",0,4,,2.0,2/18/2015,"The food has never been bad... In fact it's exceptional most of the times... But tonight I called them to place an order for a cheesecake... I was put on hold apparently to be transferred to the bakery... After about  10 minutes on hold, I decided to just head their way... I reached the location but still hadn't hung up... There was not even a single customer at the bakery, 4 employees hanging out, the red light on their phone blinking, yet no one bothered to pick up the phone, even after about being on hold for a total of 20 minutes. How do I know that it was my call on hold? Because as soon as I hung up, the light on the phone went off! Disappointed at the service, but two stars for the food!"
Sammie B.,"Dallas, TX",10,13,61,5.0,12/9/2015,i love cheesecake factory!!!!!
Bob P.,"Allen, TX",0,8,,1.0,12/21/2014,"We have been a repeat customer of The Cheesecake Factory for sometime. The food is sometimes fair, sometimes good, never great considering the prices. The service is all over the place!  We made our final visit last evening.....so disappointing!  I ordered the Alfredo with chicken and sundried tomatoes. My wife ordered Chicken Picatta. One son  ordered a pepperoni pizza and my other  son ordered the turkey burger. When we were finally served my son was served the turkey sandwich. The server took the plate back, saying that the correct burger would be served shortly. We had nearly finished our bland, tasteless entrees when the tiny uneatable burger was served. Although the burger was comped, it did make up for the terrible dining experience."
Courtney W.,"Plano, TX",0,8,,2.0,6/15/2014,"For such a huge menu the food was surprisingly okay,  not great, but good.  The wait time is approx 20 min, which was not too bad as you can wander outside to kill time.  I think the real reason for visits is the dessert menu, with the entree secondary. Otherwise,  a good visit."
Persia A.,"McKinney, TX",308,397,357,3.0,10/11/2011,"I really do like it here, I promise. The only thing is, every time I come, it gets louder and louder and more crowded and less room. It feels. . . just crowded, period. Waiting for the host to call your name is an uncomfortable experience in the sense that there is NOWHERE to go to wait. You can stand awkwardly in front of the door, but who wants to do that? No one does.  The food is always amazing and yummy. The cheesecake is stupid-good! The prices are slightly high, so I'd go with a date who is paying. Or treat yourself to something nice once in a while.  DO NOT go without ordering a cheesecake. You might not be able to finish it, but it will be worth waking up for a midnight snack for!"
Fausto O.,"McKinney, TX",1,12,5,1.0,1/3/2015,The manager Elena Rodriguez is the most unprofessional manager I have ever deal with. Despite waiting for 45 min. And sent to a table of 4 when we are actually 6 people. She did not care and put us back on the list of 6. Very unprofessional and don't care about customer service.
Shane L.,"Dallas, TX",88,67,159,5.0,4/26/2014,Really good. I am stuffed! The burger was cooked perfect and the fish n chips were really good. Waters Creek in Allen is a very nice place. Lots of people and beautiful weather.
Sally S.,"Plano, TX",0,6,4,3.0,6/22/2015,"Typical Cheesecake factory: large variety of food options and great desserts. What I don't like about this location is the parking. I always have a tough time finding a spot here. Also the hostesses at the front are never friendly  or welcoming. The waits are long here especially on weekends, but that is expected with any popular restaurant."
Renee C.,"Dallas, TX",787,187,276,4.0,5/31/2013,"This place really has customer service in mind. I am somewhat of a regular here. If I know my friends or family are coming, I make sure I tag along. On my last visit, I ordered the mushroom burger. When it came time for my table to have its food delivered, my burger didn't make it. A food runner or another server came by and asked if I ordered a veggie burger, which I declined. It turns out my mushroom burger accidentally ran to the wrong table. Honestly, I didn't mind at all, as I wasn't that hungry. Two people plus a manager stopped by my table to apologize about the situation. After a multitude of sorries (which I thought wasn't a big deal after all) I finally got my mushroom burger. It only took like, an extra 10 minutes. The server even said that they will comp my meal...seriously? Well, the people who work here must freak out a lot or are just genuinely apologetic. They must be lucky that I'm not one of those fussy types of customers who get aggravated easily for no big reason. Mistakes happen. I get it.  Speaking of which, I hope a genuine vegetarian didn't mistakenly consume an actual burger - now THAT would suck.  I'm not really going to comment a lot about the taste of the food, since almost everyone has eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, among all corporate-type restaurants. I will say the mushroom burger wasn't at all bad. And be sure to never leave without indulging into their cheesecakes, obviously. That's what their known for."
