Dan F.,"Allen, TX",0,9,1,1.0,9/28/2014,"Waited 20 minutes and called from my car twice for my Curbside To Go order.  Ended up having to go inside and fetch cold order that is sitting there from the clueless hostess.   The manager ""Billy"" was useless when contacted, unwilling to do anything at that time to address the issue. Prices continue to be high with portion sizes continue to shrink.  At this location the service and food continues to go downhill.  If you live in this area and must have CKF I would suggest going to the one in Frisco."
Jon C.,"Midland, TX",116,195,18,4.0,2/16/2014,Cheesecake Factory is a staple in our routine.  Their Cajun pasta is very good.  Macaroni cheese balls are amazing. Usually the service is good.  Prepare to wait at peak times.
Bethany H.,"Dallas, TX",100,29,82,4.0,2/18/2016,"We got a giftcard here for Christmas and decided to go since it had been a while. I have been here a time or two before, although it was my husband's first time. We came here on a Saturday afternoon about lunch time the day before Valentines Day and we didn't have to wait at all, we were seated immediately. It was such a pleasant environment, I love the pillars and lights and i feel like i always have plenty to look at. I got a Pina colada that was very good! Our server was nice but she didnt stop by our table much. If we needed anything we would have had to flag her down, I'm assuming it was just because she was busy. For an appetizer there was bread and butter served. The white bread was hard and hard to eat. The dark brown bread (I have no idea what kind it was) was fresh and much better to eat. I got the Charbroiled Factory Burger and it was very good, and so were the french fries which makes a world of a difference to me. My husband got the American Burger and kept telling me how good it tasted. I think with two alcoholic drinks, two burgers it came out to be about $50. Thank god for gift cards. This is a great date place!"
James F.,"Dallas, TX",3,16,15,1.0,9/4/2014,"As I'm writing this, hunched over in pain. I keep thinking about the manager who stated, it smells and looks fine to me. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times (all great experiences) and had the pit beef dip sandwich before as well. This visit on the evening of 9/4 was absolutely horrible. My sandwich smelled and tasted like fish, yes, a ""beef"" sandwich mind you. Normally this means the beef has turned. I quickly sent this back, and the manager returned stating...before a name, introduction, anything...it smells fine to me. I disagreed and said we were done as my stomach was uneasy. Ok...was all I got back from ""management"". Never again will I visit this location."
Aleesha B.,"Delaware, OH",0,23,6,1.0,11/24/2015,"I went in for dinner, sat at the bar. Wasn't quite sure what I had a taste for once I figured it out I placed my order. The bartender acted as though he didn't want to give me blue cheese olives for my Martini as I requested. I also asked him to restrain my martini because it had ice cubes in it. The manager brought out the wrong food, placed it in front of me in less than 60 seconds came back and picked it up saying he gave me the wrong food. My order came out but it was luke warm... The bartender had also placed a check in front of me with one price however, when he swiped my card and gave it back it had another price on it. Without him explaining to me the change he just sat my copies on the bar, DID NOT say thank you AT ALL. I'm very picky yet polite as I am also in the service industry. I understand people have bad days but the bartender just want the most friendly person. I also called after I left the manager said its ""unlike him"" referencing the bartender and also said he'd speak to him but did you offer to make it right at all besides repeatedly saying ""I'm sorry."" I usually love going to cheese cake factory however, I can definitely say I wouldn't go back to this one."
Valerie G.,"McKinney, TX",0,7,,1.0,11/7/2015,"So I took 26 people to celebrate a graduation then the waiter took 45min to give us our bill which ruined our night because we had other plans... so we asked the manager for a discount but he said ""there's nothing I can do"" so we said no you just don't care and he still did Nothing ..well anyways this is the most awful place to go to considering we have given the Allen location multiple chances but still nothing has changed..so ""I"" say please DO Not Go to this Location because they obviously do Not have good Management! Go too Frisco they have way mite experience and treat their customers apportially."
Stacie A.,"Dallas, TX",83,152,15,4.0,1/19/2013,"I have to preface this review by stating that I've never met a Cheescake Factory that I didn't like. Although I do find their book-sized menu to be a little anxiety inducing, their food is always good. Pricey, but good. The Allen location is no exception. Went there this Friday expecting a long wait but it only took us about 20 minutes to be seated. Service was great. Food was great. Cheesecake was even better. I think the company has even managed to squeeze in some additional cheesecake flavors on the menu, thus causing me to seriously consider spending an unmentionable amount of money to sample a few interesting looking options. Thankfully, my dining partner encouraged me to stick with my usual - the coconut chocolate cheesecake. Yum! The only drawback about this location is the parking. As with all things in the Allen/McKinney suburbs this place is packed and parking is hard to find. Fortunately, the restaurant offers complimentary valet. Now if I could only remember to keep cash on me for tips!"
A B.,"Wylie, TX",0,2,,4.0,4/3/2016,"Great food, great happy hour, great service, but they do not take reservations, so, you might need to wait for a while to be seated at dinner time (we once had a 20 people group and we waited for 2 hours). But, if you avoid that, great place!"
Teale L.,"McKinney, TX",2,11,3,1.0,10/7/2015,"We've been here three times and it's been three times too many. Every time is just awful service. Which is extremely disappointing since I love Cheesecake Factory. The hostesses always act like you're bothering them by coming in. The first two times, both times we were told they were short-staffed. Our second time we had a waitress who, I'll be honest she was downright strange. She acted as if she was on another planet, we had to strain to hear her, and we hardly ever saw her unless she was clearing our half full drinks and I had to wrestle my straw from my glass as she was walking away with it because it took 20 minutes to get the straw in the first place. This last time will definitely be the last time. Our waitress got our drink order and then proceeded to completely ignore us for 10+ minutes. We got up and left and went to Chuy's where we had phenomenal service.  The next time I'm craving Cheesecake Factory I will go to Stonebriar, where we've never had any issues."
Teena T.,"Murphy, TX",3,20,,1.0,2/16/2016,"The food (entrees) is below mediocre. we ordered the spicy cashew chicken which was ok, the shrimp angel hair was terrible. the pasta & shrimp had no flavor at all. we barely ate them. The cheesecake though is absolutely delicious. the service was below average as well. we will continue to get their cheesecakes, but never the food."
MJ S.,"Murphy, TX",90,108,20,4.0,10/28/2013,"Ok, we just went for cheesecake... but wow!! And the waitress was extremely sweet and fun!! Red Velvet Cheesecake is awesome!!! My friend's triple chocolate was good, but we both were loving the Red Velvet!"
Curtis Humanities S.,"Allen, TX",0,21,2,5.0,6/3/2014,"Is the Cheesecake Factory Worth All the Hype? - 2DC With all the hype, I couldn't help but eat here, and the inner critic in me had no reason to resist either. So with anticipating feelings seemingly like that of a college graduate coming into the risky money-sucking adult life, I waltzed in and opened the doors into the famous diner. I ordered an Americana Cheeseburger, with burger cooked medium rare, along with French fries as a side. What came after my meal was given to me was a delightful and astonishing experience that left me wanting more. Right when you walk in, a full team of greeters are ready at attention by a counter on your left, with their black uniforms and the speed they handled things they were like a fully operational SWAT team. As my mother and I were led to our table, walking by fancy Egyptian like pillars, I noticed the cheerful yet fancy atmosphere of the place. You could hear the chatter of waiters and diners, as well as the clinging of plates and pans coming everywhere. We were given a menu as soon as we sat down. The menu was long, a bit overwhelming, but the food descriptions were short yet descriptive. This way, I could know what exactly I wanted. A waiter came to us soon after we were given a table, unfortunately I forgot his name, but he was quite friendly and nice. After giving us our drinks and taking our orders, he gave us some appetizing bread which was well baked. I excused myself to the bathroom, as it is common knowledge that the state of a restaurant's bathroom equals the state of their kitchen. Their bathroom was quite clean and spacey, so I could now fully enjoy my meal knowing it wasn't cooked in a disgusting place. The wait for our food was quite lengthy, about 20 minutes, I expected they would be more efficient especially at lunch time. But when I saw our waiter walking up with our orders, it was like heaven had opened and the angels were singing. My meal was nicely arranged, and it took me all of my strength not to stuff it all down in one go. The burger was quite big, causing me to cut it in half. But as I bit down, the great juiciness and cheesiness of the food hit me all at once. I could tell the meat was prepared carefully, and the delicate handiwork of the chef showed through the food. The fries had the right amount of crispness and saltiness. Everything was perfect. The fantastic meal filled me up pretty quickly, and we asked for some takeout boxes, only for our waiter to take it up and prepare the boxes himself, showcasing the restaurant's great service. Needless to say, me and my entourage left very pleased, and we felt we certainly got our money's worth. I beat myself up for waiting 14 years to dine at the Cheesecake Factory, and I certainly will find myself going back. They have great service, and although the wait is a bit lengthy, it's worth it. I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant, during lunch or dinner, either way you won't leave feeling unsatisfied. Food: *****                     Atmosphere: ****                 Service: *****                  Overall: *****"
Omar R.,"El Cajon, CA",41,17,,2.0,1/11/2015,I had a Sunrise Fiesta Burrito from here this morning and got sick to my stomach. I'll spare you the details but it wasn't good. I love this pace for the cheesecake but I don't know what they did to that burrito.
Eric R.,"Allen, TX",0,8,1,5.0,4/24/2015,"This place is my go-to place! They have great food and tasty. I always get their Oreo Cheesecake, Louisiana Pasta, and Avocado Egg Rolls. I didn't care how much food is in one serving. As long as it is good, I'd dare myself to finish everything. Another top-notch is their service. I always ask for the same server, James. He's on top of his game and everything. He's always around when you need him. He'll give you some honest and descriptive suggestions."
Mark P.,"Allen, TX",20,12,,1.0,12/21/2014,"After 5 years of off and on again promises to never visit this location, yesterday was the final straw. This is the worst execution of a Cheesecake Factory location I've been too.    Let's face it, Cheesecake Factory is (at it's core) is an upscale diner chain. With that in mind, the price points are high but generally proportionate to the ""OMG, I'm going to need a to go box when my order arrives"" sub-theme of success that many chain restaurants embrace now (i.e. Olive Garden, Maggiano,s, etc..). I could go several paragraphs about that corporate restaurant strategy, but back to the subject at hand.    Yesterday, we decided to give the Allen CF another try. Amazingly, we were seated immediately w/o any attitude or clumsiness by the usually inept host staff that has ruled this location with rudeness and indifference as if it's encouraged and rewarded by management. We arrived at 4PM and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Usually a good sign of prompt service we were greeted by a server who (throughout the meal) was consistently 2 steps behind in hitting service points. Each of us (party of four) ordered something different, but nothing unusual - no modifiers, splits or anything that could slow down overall service. At this point I'll cut to the chase: 2 pasta dishes were flavorless and incomplete in preparation another ( a pepperoni pizza) seemed to be a facsimile of an actual proper pizza and the turkey burger I ordered came out as a turkey club. I sent it back (held on to the side salad) and was assured my turkey burger would arrive asap. When it did arrive it was a flavorless mess on a 4"" cold white bun. I had 3 bites and started to envision getting a Whataburger on the way home. The manager did the right thing by comping off the burger but seemed unconcerned that 3 other guests were leaving less than happy.   In short, if you are a big fan of CF, visit any location other than Cheesecake Factory Allen, TX."
Renee C.,"Richardson, TX",97,144,138,4.0,8/5/2014,I came here with some friends for the 2nd cheesecake half off day. I was expecting a long wait for this particular day but there wasn't any at all. It took us like 5 minutes to be seated.  I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta that was delicious. The chipotle sauce is so flavorful without being overwhelmingly spicy.  For desert I ordered the kahlua cheesecake. The coffee flavor was just right and was not overwhelming . This was great especially for half off!
G M.,"Plano, TX",5,40,86,5.0,1/31/2015,Been here twice now. Food and service are fabulous!  I highly recommend the Tuscan Chicken! Under 590 delicious calories!
K T.,"Princeton, TX",507,22,138,4.0,6/17/2014,"Went here for dinner a couple times and has really good food. The staff is friendly and if you come here early, you most likely not have to wait as long with a small party. Also very family friendly..."
Lina J.,"Plano, TX",0,17,,3.0,1/3/2016,"We came here on a Sunday morning after making a reservation. Let me start by saying that we were running late but ended up all making it on time before the reservation was canceled. That being said, the hostess in this place is one of the rudest I have ever seen. I was under the impression that a hostess is supposed to be welcoming. Her job is to seat the customers and also have a smile on her face welcoming them as well. This one's face had the stink eye the whole time since we got there. I don't know what her deal is but something has to be done. At one point I asked her if she was OK and she said I'm fine I'm just trying to figure out the table. That stink face was present throughout the whole time we were there, and was very annoying. Thankfully our server was very pleasant, very good and accommodating. The food was great as usual ,I ordered the California omelette and it was delicious. Everything was on point except for the hostess."
Katrina S.,"Garland, TX",388,9,10,5.0,10/3/2014,Our server (brandy)  was really nice and excellent  service! Thank you for making my sisters birthday memorable :)
