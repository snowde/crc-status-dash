Minjoo K.,"Plano, TX",138,191,162,4.0,1/27/2011,"I give 4 stars to the cheesecakes. I've been to many locations for the Cheesecake Factory, and I don't really care for the food. The food is greasy and heavy. I would be fine if they only sold cheesecake at this place. It could be a dessert place you could go to after you eat dinner! You can serve cheesecake, coffee, tea, etc. (Make it happen people!) But yea, only cheesecake for me."
Ryan W.,"Plano, TX",34,107,5,5.0,8/15/2012,"We went here for a date lunch while the kids were with a sitter on Sunday. Server: Kiki Food: Pizza and salad lunch specials Kiki was awesome! Super nice, very quick and just an all around great character to enjoy a meal with. The food was SO good! I had this negative mentality about Cheesecake Factory, but now I have no idea why, it RULES! Highly Recommend! The place is just as solid as it gets and this location has some nice walking areas to shop and look after a big meal. P.S. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was a little bit amazing!"
Kendra P.,"Wylie, TX",17,9,,3.0,12/31/2014,Cheesecake is generally a very good restaurant. We have been going to cheesecake for years and the Allen location for approximately 3 years or so.. The service and quality of the food used to be fantastic but the last 3 times we have eaten there it has been pretty disappointing. The food has either been cold or over cooked each time we have been there over our last 3 visits. When you have a family of 7 and you go to a restaurant that is over a $100 to feed your family you expect good quality food and this location just has not met the service/quality levels over the last few months.  The location by north park mall is still fantastic but the Allen location has definitely fell off with service and quality.
Natasha B.,"Dallas, TX",441,89,18,4.0,9/9/2014,Tom was excellent!  The food was well prepared and the ambience was stunning.
Neal L.,"McKinney, TX",1,69,,4.0,9/4/2014,"Very well done on all points. Wife had herb salmon cooked perfectly very nice. I had Kobe beef burger, way good lots of beef.   Kids just had pizza they are easy to please, not a food snob like me."
Reba G.,"Dallas, TX",567,688,556,2.0,2/15/2012,"HOLY MOLY, if you expect to get a table here on the weekends, be sure to have patience to wait 2 hours to even get a table.  They don't take reservations at all, even the bar is packed, and it takes a minute to get a drink.  Their menu is HUGE, and they have a ton of options that even include small plates or lighter options.  I got the flatbread pizza here, and it was pretty good.  I tasted the calamari and it was just so-so.  They have a huge bakery selection on desserts especially their cheesecakes.  If you bring in your own birthday cake, they do charge a $1 a person for plates and forks.  The food here is decent, it was the wait that gave it 2 stars."
Matt L.,"Plano, TX",556,62,21,4.0,6/8/2014,The food is always good and the wait staff I've had is top notch. Since moving from Illinois and going to Cheescake Factory in Chicago growing up it ranks hand in hand. I personally love the Key lime cheescake and also the nachos are delicious!
Jason M.,"McKinney, TX",19,74,63,5.0,5/9/2010,One of our favorite restaurants around. My wife and I eat here quite a bit and we both have our favorite items on the menu; although we also like trying something new each time. The menu is so large that we could try something new every time for a long time.  The cheesecakes are to die for and are great to get for take out!!
Sue W.,"Plano, TX",0,69,,5.0,10/21/2015,"I love this place, I've been to the one in Frisco as well and it's equally good. The food, the cheesecakes, the service, the cleanliness are all good. Keep it up!"
Y G.,"Dallas, TX",1,76,32,1.0,12/20/2014,"the customer service was ok, but the quality of food wasnt, over rated. aside from a formal setting and decoration, nothing special about the restaurant. i wouldnt come back if thenplace gave me a free meal and dessert."
Debbie J.,"Wylie, TX",99,258,5,4.0,10/7/2012,"Appetizer:   Tamale cake was the best EVAH!  Lord, help a woman on a diet.  Yum.  Dinner:  I love the skinny options.  I'm in heaven with all of the options and calorie counts are posted on the menu.  I had the shrimp summer rolls.  So good and fresh! My hubby and son enjoyed two different yet A-mazing burgers.   Service: Our waiter was great!   He made wonderful recommendations and seemed to care! Cheesecake:   We were too full.  Next time!!! The only thing that wasn't good was waiting for our table.  There isn't a waiting room and people were coming in and out which made it uncomfortable because it was cold outside.  Brrrrrrr."
Suzanne C.,"Allen, TX",0,9,,2.0,8/16/2014,Took the family to Cheesecake factory last week. Totally mediocre experience. Ordered a Kettle one martini up with extra olives and it was ok at best pretty sure it was not Kettle One. Had a couple appetizers that were sub par that we shared and the kids meals were average. Service was OK but I think I am done with Cheesecake Factory.
Stanley W.,"San Francisco, CA",11,61,3,3.0,4/4/2014,Friday night wait was over an hour - I guess there aren't that many restaurants to eat around Allen.  This is the standard Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  The waiter took a very long time to refill our drinks and the food took awhile to arrive.  Nothing too spectacular about our meal or service
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",267,258,,5.0,3/10/2014,"This is a beautiful location located in Watter's Creek. I went here around 6 o'clock on a Saturday, and was pleased that they made sure that parties of 2 didn't have to wait that long. It was only a 20 minute wait. The wait staff was fanatastic, and was very attentive. Our waitress was very knowledgble of the entress and chessecake, and boxed up our food when we were ready to head out. Was very impressed by the new skinny menu, and let me just say very tasty. I ordered the pasta on the menu....there was only one pasta dish, but the pesto, romaine tomatoes, and chicken was delicious. Always a treat coming to The Cheesecake Factory. By the way, Oreo cheesecake is to die for."
Jolie J.,"Allen, TX",54,17,1,4.0,4/30/2014,"Love this place! Whenever my family and I cannot decide on where to eat, we end up coming here and never regret it. The service is usually great except at peak times.. That can be a hit or miss. Huge selection of items on their menu.. Please bear in mind their portions are ginormous!"
Mi J.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,4.0,7/10/2015,This place awesome. Not only the service was very nice but also food was great. Had strawberry cheese cake and it was very tasty.
D R.,"Garland, TX",4,74,37,5.0,2/17/2015,"to me, there wasn't anything special about this location, but i've never had a terrible experience at TCF.. they're all pretty much the same and you can always count on a delicious dessert! =)"
Kelly R.,"Frisco, TX",4,11,17,3.0,6/14/2015,"Beet vinaigrette  salad with apples, goat cheese and pecans was very tasty. Just enough dressing- light but filling. Also had the chicken samosas but with cashew tamarind sauce instead of the standard dipping sauce it came with. Very good. Our server lacked personality but stayed on top of our refills. Aside from that we had a nice meal."
Tom H.,"Allen, TX",1,12,13,1.0,2/6/2013,"Ok, my wife & I are dog lovers, but this is ridiculous!  We went to the Cheese Cake Factory in Allen, TX (75 & Bethany) and were seated next to a group of people that had a long hair chiwawa sitting on the booth at their table while the owner sat and fed the dog.  As far as I know, it is against health codes to have a dog in a resultant unless it is a service dog.  Has anyone ever seen a chiwawa as a service animal?  Anyways, we spoke to Shawn (a manager) about the situation and asked him to ask the customers to please remove the dog from the restaurant.  Shawn proceeded over to the customers and had a 5second conversation with the customer and then left.  The customer laughed and sat back down and continued feeding and playing with the dog.  Obviously, the manager was more concerned with keeping the party of 6 happy than to follow city health codes."
Amanda S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",92,50,27,1.0,3/28/2011,"This was my first time at this location. Usually we go to the CF by North Park Mall. Our experience at this location was less than stellar.  We went out to celebrate my mom's birthday so it was a special occasion. After a 45 minute wait @ 5pm we finally got seated. It took our waitress another 20 minutes to come over and just greet us. Another 20 minutes to bring the drinks out and then another 40 minutes to actually bring the food!  After we had given her strict instructions about how to prepare our food she got 3 out of 6 of our dinner incorrect. She brought my vegetarian mother bacon on her pasta, my grandma's salad had no dressing on it and my son's hamburger sliders that were specifically asked to put cheese on had none.  While realizing that most of our meals were wrong we were dying of thirst. Our waitress could never keep a drink filled. After my mom approached her about the meat being on her pasta the waitress cleared her plate and took it back to remove the bacon. In the mist of the 45 minutes my mom waited, the manager came over to apologize and tried to smooth everything over. Meanwhile, the waitress brought my grandma dressing....but a different kind. After everyone at our table had finished eating they finally brought my mom's meatless pasta out.  After sitting in front of our empty plates or plates that were waiting to be doggy bagged we waited another 30 minutes for our waitress to come ask if we needed a doggy bag or the check. After getting the doggy bags and the check she took another 15-20 minutes to run our cards.  We will not go back to this location again. If you want better service I suggest going to the North Park location."
