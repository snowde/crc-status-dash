Richard B.,"Allen, TX",7,105,11,5.0,5/1/2013,Server was great and food was amazing. Pizza was done perfectly. The kitchen didn't send our foot out correctly. They forgot my bowl of soup that was supposed to be delivered before my pizza and forgot the sliced tomatoes and side of ranch dressing for girlfriends salad. Great save by staff and managers. Almost immediately after we pointed out the mistake 2 managers was at our table and real quick afterwards we got our order. Super friendly and super helpful. We had a great meal. 5 stars due to the quick response making it right and everything else was top notch.
Amanda B.,"Allen, TX",1,4,1,2.0,3/21/2015,Waited more then 20 minutes for the curb side service tonight for cheesecake we had ordered ahead of time. I ended up having to go inside to pick it up. What is the point of offering the service if they don't bring it out in a timely manner?
Jersey J.,"Wylie, TX",26,37,11,4.0,8/21/2013,I like this place always good food. Pricy enough that I am not a regular but we do go now and then. This place is worth going if you have not been there.
Jerry G.,"Allen, TX",0,3,6,4.0,10/14/2011,Always eat at the Cheesecake Factory for kid's birthdays. Had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta for the first time and it was great. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is the best!
Kathleen T.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,2.0,2/3/2014,"I ordered take out from them today. To start off, the girl on the phone was awesome who took my order. She was very nice and even went to double check that the caesar dressing they had didn't have raw eggs since I'm pregnant. Pick up was a breeze and the girl I ordered from was there and another guy. Such a pleasant place to order from! On to the food. I ordered chicken mushroom lettuce wraps, dinner sized chicken caesar salad and red velvet cheesecake. Once I got home and got everything out, it all looked pretty great. The lettuce wraps are almost laughable though. They give you little thin pieces of lettuce to try to maneuver the chicken onto...I ended up just using the lettuce like giant chopsticks when I gave up on strategically spooning the chicken into the lettuce leaves and having everything fall apart.  The caesar salad looked delicious and I've been craving one for a while. Tried the chicken before eating and it was SO yummy! Juicy and seasoned just right. The dressing...left to be desired for a good caesar. I'm not sure if they gave me the skinny dressing instead of regular (I ordered the regular) but it had a faint taste of yogurt to it and pretty much ruined the salad. Tastes nothing like good dressing should. Red Velvet cheesecake though, that was the best part of my entire meal! Kind of upset that I spent over $30 expecting to get good quality food then ended up pretty disappointed with what they had to offer. This used to be my favorite restaurant but I think I'll stick with Olive Garden and Cheddars and get better food for a better price."
Josh A.,"Allen, TX",110,6,,1.0,8/6/2012,Horrible service.  Waited 6 minutes for a waiter when first sat.  Waiter Laurence seemed preoccupied with other tables.  Drinks sat there unfilled for long periods of time.  Did not bring bread when asked.  Did not check on table.  First time never left tip.  Hope its not like that all the time.
Rebecca H.,"Plano, TX",4,24,,2.0,5/12/2014,disappointing experience.  We love the cheesecake factory but this was a disappointing trip.  We were told to sit outside or at the bar or wait 15-20 minutes even though there were plenty of empty seats in the main dining area.  Server seemed barely interested and took forever before the bread came out.  And they seemed to have signficantly reduced the lunch portions: my luau salad was 1/2 of the size of what it used to be.  May have to start going to the Frisco location instead!
Jason J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",41,153,1184,3.0,2/21/2013,Nothing special. Very commercial. The scenery is inviting. The food presentation is good too.
Bruce C.,"Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA",1,15,15,4.0,7/20/2013,"I was herded into this place by the group that I was having dinner with - I wouldn't have picked it for myself. So, I get on Yelp to read the tips and saw all the bad reviews. I was prepared to have a bad experience. But, to my surprise, the food was decent and the service was awesome. Don't be afraid to give this place a try.  The parking may be a challenge - but if you're eating a big chunk of cheese cake, it probably won't hurt you to walk it off a little."
Beth B.,"Ridgeway, VA",77,187,279,4.0,6/15/2010,"My dish - 2.5 stars Decor - 5 stars Service - 4 stars Menu - wow. My office went to Cheesecake Factory for a group lunch this week.  I had the Navajo sandwich which is grilled chicken with avocado on fry bread.  I was super impressed with the restaurant, the immense selection on the menu and the service but not so much with the Navajo sandwich, which really needed some seasoning to bring out the flavors.  I added a little salt and that was a little better but I won't order that again.  One co-worker had a Thai dish with peanut sauce that looked fantastic.   I really can't get over the menu - two pages dedicated to cocktails, two pages dedicated to cheesecakes, every kind of food you can imagine. I can't imagine how they can keep up with all those different ingredients and recipes."
Dorothee H.,"Plano, TX",1,135,17,5.0,8/10/2013,"I am all about healthy food so I try to avoid chain restaurants but I make an exception for the Cheesecake Factory. I like their veggie burger a lot.  The sweet potato fries are also very yummy.  And of course the cheesecake selection is great and they are very tasty, though most flavors are a little too sweet for my taste."
Tim S.,"Plano, TX",98,498,382,3.0,12/11/2010,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. It was way to bright and strangely painted. I was amazed at how big the menu is. To me, a restaurant that has lots of choices does few things well. I thought I would have the fish tacos and finish with some cheesecake. When I was served, I couldn't believe how much food there was! There were four or five fish tacos and sides of beans and rice. It was crazy! I am glad I chose something relatively healthy. The tacos were actually pretty good. They could have used some sauce or salsa. Beans and rice straight from a package. I never even looked at the cheesecake menu."
Amanda G.,"Little Elm, TX",107,172,59,4.0,9/14/2012,I'd give it 5 stars if it were not so darn expensive! The Shepherd's pie is my favorite....followed up with the Pineapple Upside down cheese cake! MMMMMMMMM...............................
Mel A.,"Little Elm, TX",0,26,3,1.0,2/18/2014,"Really wanted to like this place as it was my first time. Arrived before 6PM and still waited an hour. Thought to myself, wow this place must be amazing. All was fine until we sat down and service went downhill from there. Took forever to receive out meal, watch 4 tables come after us and receive their dinner first. We order simple pasta/chicken dishes. Wife went to the restroom and waitress never came by the table for ten minutes. I left to smoke becasue i was tired of waiting, came back wife had dinner boxed, dessert to go and paying the check. WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN becasue of service!!!"
lisa s.,"Rowlett, TX",21,87,26,5.0,10/23/2012,"Oooooohhhh, I seriously LOVE this place.  From the brown bread and REAL butter before the meal to the Lunch Lettuce Wraps then to the desserts.  Not only the cheesecake is delish, ALL of the desserts are wonderful."
April J.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,1.0,5/18/2013,"Maybe we ordered the wrong meal but our first and probably last visit to the Cheesecake Factory was for lack of a better word ""Horrible"". Hubby ordered the grilled pork chop which was oddly very sweet. His corn was scorched ""only way I can describe  the taste"" and both of our Margaritas were watered down. I ordered the Shrimp pasta. My shrimp were overly breaded burnt and soggy soggy. My pasta was not topped with arugula it was covered with a mountain of this stuff completely ruined the dish. On the upside hubby's mashed potatoes were pretty good and the hot wings were decent  but I've had better at Applebee's and Outback. Needless to say we both ate about 20% of our meal. Decided against trying the Cheesecake and my husband told waitress no thank you on the to go boxes for vast amount of food left on our plate. This made her really uncomfortable but needless to say we paid our 72.00 bill left the customary tip and ran never to look back."
Craig J.,"Wheeling, WV",266,95,28,2.0,9/10/2013,"I hate to give a bad review but I must be honest. I love the cheesecake factory. In fact cheesecake is only of my strongest vices. We went here for my mom's birthday and this place is right down the street from the homestead. This location was not good. Wait time was long but that is completely fine as it was a Friday night. You'd have to be crazy to expect a wait time any shorter than 30 minutes on a Friday night. Our server was obviously over sat and it took him a good 15 minutes or so to even acknowledge we were there. By the time he actually got to us, we had so much time that we had the entire meal already selected. Not to put him down or anything of the sort but you have to at least say something to the table like ""I'll be with you in a minute, what can I get you to drink?"" and then ask for help. But even our server was not that big of a deal to us (we're really laid back). It was my meal...It took about 30 minutes to get it out to the table after we ordered. By that time I was ravenous. I was on this no carb gluten free kick so I ordered a no bun turkey burger. Now out of all the times I've been to Cheesecake factory more times than I can count. I've never gotten the same thing twice (cheesecake excluded) and I've never been disappointed until now. I can't even describe the taste as an actual flavor. Imagine if you will the smell of new born puppy breath. Now take that smell, translate it into taste and put it in some poor sap's burger...that's the only way I can describe it...puppy breath. Couldn't even take another bite I was so nauseated. Ordered something different no problem (my mom's steak was way over cooked also). Over all, not a good experience for my Clan. We will be going back but it'll be a while before I get another turkey burger from them. That reminds me...I want a puppy!"
Ms M.,"Fort Bragg, NC",54,117,19,4.0,12/24/2009,"I love this location so much better than the one in Frisco. The Cheesecake Factory in Frisco stresses me out on any given day. (Of course, being in Frisco is also stressful on any given day).  I love the open airy atmosphere of this restaurant. There is even outside seating for the Spring when they have bands play on the green. We ordered 3-lunch specials, and 2-side salads, for 4 people, and we had tons of food!!! The food was excellent, and the server was attentive. I have never been here for a weekend dinner, but I would definitely try to make reservations, as I could see it getting crazy. All in all, it was an enjoyable time...for lunch, that is."
Lisa R.,"McKinney, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/22/2014,"My husband and I went here to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary last weekend.. We arrived around 5:30 on Sunday night.  All of the servers seemed to look ""messy"", shirts not tucked in, clothes dirty and etc.  They set us next to a table with a woman and 3 small children, the 2 children that could walk were running around the restaurant and the youngest sat there and screamed and cried for about 20 minutes (right in my ear).  We had to ask a different server for refills on our soda's, as our server was apparently MIA.  The food was nothing to write home about.  My husband told me he was sorry for picking such a bad restaurant to our celebration.  We will NEVER go back!!!  Didn't even want to stay for the cheesecakes, which is why we went to begin with."
Salome B.,"Plano, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/12/2015,"My family and I dined here tonight. The table was wet. The waiter, Billy J, was in a hurry. He was running around instead of walking even though the place was not crowded at all. He ran and put some bread and butter on the table without putting any utensils, plates or napkins. We did not have any straws to drink water and the waiter was not anywhere around so we could ask for something. When we had almost finished the bread without any butter since we did not have any knives, the waiter came. I asked him to bring utensils and straws, with a rude attitude, he said, ""Anything else while I'm here?"" Finally, the food came. My son's napkin was dirty but no sign of the waiter to ask for a clean one. We needed more ketchup, but, again, waiter was not around. When we were almost done with our meal, he finally came and asked if everything was OK. The service was horrible. The food, Kobe Burger, was not any special for the price they charged. We never go back to this place. Awful experience."
