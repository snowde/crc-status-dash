Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,2.0,7/31/2008,"I could say - Ditto to Aimee's review, but I think I'll try to be more creative about it.  I should have known from the second I pulled into the parking lot and was stuck in a gridlock because of the idiots that were stopped at where they thought there should be a valet. Umm see the stand over there put away and the no valets standing here? Good. Now MOVE ALONG, but apparently they didn't notice. Finally made it to the parking garage where I passed Aimee - she was going down and I was going up - She advised there was NO PARKING up there so I was able to find a place to turn around before I got to the cluster that was at the dead end of the parking garage (THANK YOU!!!). On my way back down I stalked some lovely people that were leaving and jacked their spot YAY!! Finally. Some of our party had gotten there an hour earlier and been quoted 55-70 min so I figured we'd be eating shortly. Went out and hung out by the water between Brio and CF. Nice little spot, but there was a storm looming and as I looked around I thought if it starts raining and ALL THESE people go inside we'll have issues. I better beat them to the punch. Went inside. Waited ANOTHER hour. Watched 3 ppl come to complain to the manager about their service. I was getting scared. FINALLY our table was ready. I ordered a Georgia peach immediately. After all that chaos I SO needed a drink. The service was decent considering and the food was standard CF. I noticed as we were eating that the table next to us waited about 30+ min for their cheesecake to arrive so I got the jump start on getting the heck out of there by having the waitress bring us our checks and boxes for the cheesecake while we were waiting - and we still waited a long time for the cheesecake. It was delicious, but not worth the 3 hrs of my life I just wasted trying to get it. I might go back here again, but there are locations closer to me so I doubt it. If I'm in this neck of the woods again - I'm going to Brio. I understand it was a special event and therefore mass chaos, but really I hate it when the wait time you quote me isn't anywhere close to what it ends up being."
Aimee Z.,"Wylie, TX",677,661,18,3.0,7/30/2008,"30th Anniversary.  $1.50 Cheesecake.  And apparently the same number of staff as they would have had on any boring Tuesday night.  Friend put their name on the list at 5:55pm for a table of 8 people.  Was told 55 - 70 minutes. 124 minutes later... we were led to a table.  245 minutes total we finally had our meal and cheesecakes and were ready to go home.  The wait and the crowds tonight were just absolutely insane. I will however, have to report that I had what was probably the single best entree I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory before.  I will now take this opportunity to recommend the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ask for extra sauce on the side).  YUM. Unfortunately, they were sold out of my favorite cheesecake... the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake.  I opted for the Pistachio Mousse Cheesecake.  It didn't hit the spot that had been dreaming about white chocolate nutty goodness all day. Next time, I think I will just pay full price for Cheesecake and go on a regular day."
Debra F.,"Hickman, KY",265,24,3,3.0,7/10/2008,"I had the opportunity to try out the new Cheesecake Factory at Watters Crossing on Sunday.  I will have to rate them on the low side, but will add that they have been open less than a month so maybe they are still working out the kinks.  The atmosphere was very festive and pleasant and we were seated immediately.  Both I and my friend started off with a nice glass of wine which took incredibly long to receive and the wait was made worse by our waitress continually coming by to let us know it was on the way. I had the Bistro Shrimp pasta, which sounded yummy in the  description but the shrimp was little under done and too buttery, I can't believe I just said that, I'm the butter queen.  My dining companion had the special of the day, grilled salmon with broccoli and French fries,  We both thought it a little odd that they served French fries with grilled Salmon, so he opted for double broccoli.   The wait staff was a little too attentive and always seemed to show up mid sentence to ask how things were.  I'm sure a few more months of training and they will be able to figure out if interruptions are necessary.  All in all it was a pleasant experience, more due to the company.  I'm not in a hurry to go back, unless I'm craving cheesecake."
Bryn B.,"Dallas, TX",633,207,5,1.0,5/11/2010,"I think I had a bad experience here.  Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations.  Came here on Mother's Day at 1  p.m. had an hour and a half wait.  The weather was a bit chilly and people did not want to sit outside I guess.  I would of but my mom did not want to.  I have been here during the week the service and food were great! However, I'm not so sure about on the weekend and especially a holiday.  My dad calls the Watters Creek area the ""Uptown for Suburbia."" I ordered the fish tacos and the fish tacos were extremely dry...maybe I shouldnt order seafood considering the oil spill...Anyways the only good thing I had besides the bread was the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake! That was delicious!  Other than that...bad experience here."
James H.,"Allen, TX",74,11,,5.0,10/13/2011,their menu has a lot of options no matter what you choose  you can't make a bad decision! I added Cheese cake factory as one of my favorit restaurants to refer to my clients 
Mike F.,"Rowlett, TX",14,50,,5.0,4/16/2010,"I had a craving for some fresh fish tacos......trying to stay away from fried ones.  I had been to this place before and saw them on the menu, but always got chicken.  But today I tried them and WOW!  They were amazing.  When they came to my table the food was worthy of photography!  The presentation was top notch--as was the flavor.  Fresh mahi mahi complimented by lettuce, jack cheese, double white corn tortillas, black beans and seasoned rice.......with healthy scoops of guacamole and ripe petite diced tomatoes.  I was absolutely the best meal I have ever eaten there.  If you don't try these, you're missing out to say the least.  On a scale from 1 to 10, these were a 12."
Amir H.,"Frisco, TX",1,3,,2.0,7/27/2011,Waited 40 mins for our meal. Finally got the food and the steak was not cooked right. So they serve everyone else at the table and take my plate back. Took them 10 mins to bring that plate back. By then everyone else at the table was almost done. Talked to the manager and although she acknowledge they did not handle the situation correctly she never once  apologized and was kind of rude. In fairness she did comp the meal.
Thomas R.,"Sherman, TX",0,17,4,1.0,7/14/2010,"I had read the other reviews and knew what to expect, they where spot on. It was July 1st, the middle of the week, at 4pm. There where more employees then customers. All the food was delivered by different servers at varying times. My sons french fries arrived after he had finished his main portion. The wheat bread did not arrive till after our check was given to us so the server wisely had it packaged to go."
TheLadies R.,"Mesquite, TX",0,1,1,4.0,8/23/2011,The Happy Hour menu is nothing short of awesome and the food options are great. I ate some avocado thing that wasnt that great but the sliders are very yummy!
Alex S.,"Plano, TX",24,37,6,5.0,8/20/2010,"Wow! I love this place! The menu has a HUGE selection of food! The service is always great! Expect a wait on a weekend before 9pm. They are open 11 on weekdays and I can spend a Wednesday night after meetings eating great food. I have never had a bad meal here! I am clueless as to why people eat at On the Border which can be higher priced, and worse food. I get the Baja Chicken Tacos! Three huge tacos stuffed with grilled chicken, sauce, cheese, served with black beans and Spanish rice, guacamole and pico, and fresh limes! My taste buds are happy every time I eat them! The cheesecakes are huge and super rich and  loaded with whip cream! This place is excessive on portions and that's what Texans love, as long as the food is outstanding, and the service friendly, I'll keep coming back for a long time!"
Dwane O.,"Richardson, TX",2,131,1,5.0,11/7/2010,Always a great place to eat or drink! The $5 happy hour menu is a outstanding deal.
S E.,"Lake Dallas, TX",10,196,16,1.0,3/21/2010,This location is the worst around . We had to wait 20 min for two people and there were 7 open tables. After we got to the table we had to wait 15 min before the server came over and took our drink orders. then 20 min before she came back to take our order. then 45 min for our order to get the food and it was cold and it took 35 more Min's to get it back to us and it was hot. We ordered cheesecake with strawberry's the cheesecake taste like it was made with water it was very soft and warm. So we sent it back and it came back the same way . we spent $57.00 for 2 people for lunch omg . the cheesecake was $7.25 and the slice is small and it had 2 strawberry's on it .
Joshua L.,"Lewisville, TX",1,33,,1.0,3/9/2013,"I will never eat at another cheesecake factory as long as I live. The service was slow, the bill was a god awful amount and they added an 18% gratuity for a table of 6. My bill for two people was almost $70 for two dinners and two drinks. The food and the service are not worth the price. Avoid!"
William H.,"Allen, TX",170,83,21,1.0,5/21/2009,"I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations such as in Stonebriar Mall and the service and food was impeccable.  Thought I would experience the same thing at the Allen location.  Immediately upon arriving, the hostess advised us of a slight wait for inside tables, but immediate seating was available on the patio.  Since it was a nice day we promptly accepted the patio dining area.  We sat and conversed for a good 15 minutes and no servers approached us.  There were tables immediately behind and in front of us that were both getting served by different waitstaff.  It seems as though no one wanted to acknowledge us.  The hostess came by to seat another couple, after which we flagged her down and asked who our server was.  She seemed surprised that we hadn't been attended to, so we asked if we could be seated somewhere else.  We went around to the other side of the patio area and were seated in a shaded area which was cooler and closer to the front of the restaurant. It took about 5 minutes before we were attended to.  We immediately ordered food along w/ our drink order, since we've had so much time to browse the menu.  Two waters with lemon, two mojitos, a salad, and a pasta dish.  The waiter brought out bread about 5 minutes later, and said he forgot our waters.  WTF...he finally shows up with our waters.  Our food came out pretty quickly after that...10 min or so, brought out by a food runner (who was a nice guy).  No mojitos in sight....*shrug*   We began eating and were enjoying the meal while talking.  I had finished up about half of my pasta dish finally when the server came to ask how things were going.  He immediately realized he forgot our mojitos.  He said the bar was backed up and apologized.  He disappeared around the corner and reappeared immediately.  Seems as though our drinks were just sitting on the bar waiting for them to be brought to us. While eating we noticed a lone diner eating by herself.  Because of our subpar service, we began to notice other diners waiting extremely long times for their drinks, orders, and checks.  This lady that was eating by herself had finished eating for a good 15 minutes.  She was sitting there VERY patiently just holding her credit card in her hand...just waiting for the server to SEE SHE WAS READY TO LEAVE!!! Another couple was apologized to about 6 times before they even got their order taken.  They sat down before us, and they got their food AFTER we finished ours.  Other tables had empty water glasses which were screaming to get refilled.  Seriously folks, food service is not rocket science.  Take a drink order, bring out drinks, take a food order, bring out food, bring the check, all is well.   I'll have to say this was one of the WORST service experiences I've had at a restaurant in at least the past two years.  The food was good, and I enjoyed it.  But the service was horrible."
Catherine D.,"Plano, TX",3,62,,3.0,7/25/2012,"The veggie (farro, brown rice, black beans, beets, onions) burger I had today was one of the best-tasting things I've ever eaten!  And I'm a confirmed carnivore."
Ryan C.,"Plano, TX",0,6,,2.0,10/25/2012,"My wife and I had a date night at this location last night. The service was terrible, but the food was good. We waited about 20 minutes for the waitress to come take our order and then at least another 30 for the food to come. They weren't even very busy! At $12 an hour for a babysitter, it was pretty disappointing to wait so long on (what appeared to be) a slow Wednesday night. Next time we'll eat somewhere else and just go for dessert. We are always impressed with their cheesecake!"
Kevin C.,"McKinney, TX",0,19,,1.0,9/19/2010,The food is good but the service has been horrible every time we have gone to the Allen location. There are lots of good places to eat around here so we will be going elsewhere.
John O.,"Frisco, TX",30,119,69,3.0,4/11/2009,"I like going here with my mother for sunday brunch but lately we been getting slow service and the last two time my food was served to me cold. The bar here is good, they have Stella Artois on tap and a good selection of whiskeys. And of course the Cheesecake is always great.."
John H.,"Frisco, TX",0,2,,5.0,1/2/2009,"Recently my wife and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Allen. Our food and service were excellent. While they may have had some challenges when they first opened, I encourage everyone to give them another chance. Our server was attentive and professional. Our food was excellent, and the ambiance was beautiful. We had a great night and I will be back soon!!!  Great job Cheesecake factory!!!!!!!!!"
Jim F.,"Allen, TX",5,10,,2.0,8/7/2008,"I went to celebrate a birthday dinner last night for my son-in-law. The wait  was about what I expected, however once we were seated, it seemed like the waitress couldn't wait to get rid of us. The drinks were lame,the appetizers were mediocre at best. We sent our stale chips back twice. The entrees were ample, however the quality did not justify the price. I would recommend this as a place to go eat cheesecake and that's it."
