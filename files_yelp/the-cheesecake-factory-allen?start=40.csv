Mya V.,"New York, NY",9,39,56,5.0,6/27/2016,"The staff is friendly and the food is great. Our table is always clean and the servers are very attentive. We decided to veer away from a Cheesecake for dessert for once, and went with the Warm Apple Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream. I was not disappointed at all."
Brian H.,"Richmond, TX",6,3,,2.0,1/14/2017,"Disappointing experience at the Cheesecake Factory this evening.  My food was fine.  Wife's burger was almost raw inside ... seriously, it looked like slimy raw ground beef and was cool to the touch.  They took it back to the kitchen, and cooked the already-cut-in-half burger more, plopped it in a new bun, and sent it back out.  No manager sent, no comp.  Tried to order cake to go, but they were out of the 2 kinds that I tried to order, so bailed on cake.  It took over 10 minutes from the time we asked for the bill to getting card back.  Not a very satisfying trip, especially for the price."
Pedro R.,"Allen, TX",2,21,47,5.0,9/27/2015,"We live in the complex and love the food here! Customer service is excellent and the employees know their menu well! We have ordered just about everything on the menu and know our favorites. The avacado eggrolls are amazing as well as the stuffed mushrooms! I always get the pasta dishes and sometimes the comfort food because they are so savory! The cheese cakes here are a bit expensive but they are so so good! You don't think it's going to taste that amazing but it does! The lemon merengue cheesecake is my absolute favorite among all that they have. You should try it if you love lemon merengue pie because it is so spot on in flavor! The service is on point and you never really have an empty glass, and the bread they serve you is always fluffy and warm! Always reserve when you can because waiting is no fun!"
Dawn B.,"Coppell, TX",104,217,94,4.0,8/17/2015,"Went for a late lunch on national cheesecake day. Had the luau salad with almonds instead of macadamia. I really enjoyed the salad. Also tried the oreo cheesecake instead of going with my usual and favorite, white chocolate raspberry truffle. Then service was ok, nothing to write home about. I will give the server credit for warning me about the oreo cheesecake. She said it's rich and it was."
Fred P.,"Allen, TX",0,31,2,5.0,6/27/2017,Andres is the man. I love eating and drinking at the bar because he makes me feel awesome.
Kayla A.,"Wylie, TX",129,11,,5.0,1/17/2017,"My family and I go here about once a month and never have a bad experience. Whether it is dine in or take out it is always great and service is exceptional! Our last visit our waitress, Kathleen, was awesome!"
Holly D.,"Dallas, TX",14,30,,4.0,6/9/2016,"This is a typical Cheesecake Factory.  They have awesome cheesecakes of almost every variety.  Certain days a year, you can get a half priced cheesecake, i think it's on their anniversary.  They have decent food.  It's definitely not a fancy 5-star restaurant, but is pretty good for the price range.  I love several dishes here, they have a decent and pretty good low-cal menu, and they have several items including pizza for the kids.  I don't order burgers here, I've had better burgers.   As with any restaurant, there is a wait if you come during peak hours.  I try to come late for lunch/early for dinner, or extremely late for dinner.  Also this restaurant is in an outdoor walking mall type area, so typical traffic means Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are very hard to get in as a walk-in.  You can make reservations though.  The wait staff is always friendly, but I have noticed some of them seem to get a little overwhelmed when it gets crazy busy.  If you want a seamless meal, come during low-traffic hours."
Irum J.,"Dallas, TX",108,124,38,4.0,9/5/2016,"Not as great as the one in Dallas (maybe becuase we're eating here and the crowds are so huge, unlike the one in Dallas that we only order to-go). Anyhow, dessert is impeccable, waitstaff is eager to serve but not as attentive as other places we've dined. Portions are large and fresh. Great for large loud groups...emphasis on ""loud"" - it's always roaring in there, even on intimate Friday nights....like the jerk pasta dish."
Hadi T.,"Allen, TX",42,17,25,1.0,7/21/2016,"Service always late We came in at 5:30 on a Sunday , half the place is empty , tables open on the patio and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table ....(short staffed)!!!! Then they started seating groups who had higher numbers of people than our group and who came after us, when we complained to the manager he said : on we can't seat 4 ppl on a table of 5?????? What?????? We got seated and ordered everything at once , drinks and food ... We got drinks 15 minutes later. This has been a habit with Cheesecake Factory . We complained to the manager about this whole thing and we requested the phone number to the corporate office to end up with some cell phone number of apparently another manager at the same location who never returned the call. If it wasn't for the kids, and hungry after a soccer game.... We wouldn't step a foot again in here . UPDATE TO MY 1 STAR REVIEW :: Where do we start .... My son puts our name down for 4 ppl including my father who's on a wheelchair . We were told 5-10 minutes wait on a Thursday evening. Waited and saw 3 more groups walking in right after us of 3 and 4 and 5 ppl per group and got seated right away. 45 minutes later We asked what's the deal - and the manager told the hostess who was extremely embarrass of the managers behavior when he said we haven't been waiting 45 minutes when she jumped in and said actually they have and it has been a long time . Then after feeling that he screwed up and I was asking him for any table he said you didn't ask for any table ..... So we seat you anywhere we want . I told him that's a bunch of bs , and not to mention he smelled and reeked of cigarettes out of his clothes and mouth while speaking to me which killed any appetite we had . When I told him next time do not argue based on NOT KNOWING facts. He said well , as a matter of facts am not going to give you a table and he asked us to leave with my dad who's been checked out of nursing home to go eat . He is one horrible manager to run such a restaurant . Thursday 7/21/2016 8:30pm in case corporate cares about their service and the hygiene and appearance of their managers who run an establishment that should scream cleanliness . For a manager to kick clients out for being such an arrogant behavior - you will lose more patrons as you have lost us."
Monika K.,"McKinney, TX",0,14,,1.0,5/12/2017,Worst service ever! 20 minutes to get cream for my tea.  The 30 minutes from seating and still no food.  The water was not hot enough to brew the tea.  Will never return!
Jennifer J.,"Plano, TX",55,2,,2.0,6/3/2017,Bad service and the manager could care less! We came to this location thinking the experience would be much like that of the Southlake location but we were very wrong! Food was good as usual but for the money to be spent a little better service would have gone a long way!
Tom K.,"Richardson, TX",30,15,,1.0,10/21/2016,"I called in to make a reservation for a party of 6 and was informed that they only except reservations on nights when there's no need to make a reservation. In other words, if they're slow - they'll take reservations, if they're busy - they won't take reservations. I then asked to speak with their manager in regards to this policy, after being put on hold for several minutes, three different employees picked up the phone and pretended to be the manager, only to eventually inform me that they were not the person with whom I ultimately needed to speak with. Once the actually manager picked up the phone to hear my grievance, he was anything but pleasant and/or interested in my thoughts. Choose another restaurant."
Regina J.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,73,4,4.0,1/26/2016,"Honestly, the wait was not as bad as it may seem. Just a little backwards with informing patrons that their table is ready, but having them wait until someone can seat them is a little silly. Don't call people back to wait another indefinite amount of time.  The food was great. I ordered the Cuban Rolls for my family and I to try. We all agreed they were hot to the touch. But delicious. I ordered yhe BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.....soo good but way way too much food. I barely made a dent and had to take 75% of it home. I am not a fan of leftovers, so I hope I do not waste it."
Rachelle D.,"McKinney, TX",0,12,1,2.0,5/7/2017,"The food is always really good. Been to many different locations. This was the worst one I have been to. Started bad with the hostess. She never looked up from the screen and when asked if I could sit on the patio, she acted like I inconvenienced her. The waitress got my drink wrong and rarely came to check on us. Once the food came out she brought me a well done steak, when I asked for medium. The manager came out and she said that the order asked for medium well. The waitress didnt seem to pay attention to anything I asked for."
Thu N.,"Plano, TX",471,158,1397,4.0,4/12/2015,Typical run-of-the-mill Cheesecake  Factory. Hefty portions. Good food all around.  Nothing spectacular. Lots of options.
Rose I.,"Dallas, TX",439,210,314,5.0,1/13/2016,"Honestly, I find it hard to write anything bad about any Cheesecake Factory I have been to. This one is always busy because it's the only one in Allen and located in the busy Watters Creek area which has apartments and retail shops, along with other restaurants. I used to work right next to a Cheesecake Factory a few years ago so I am very familiar with the menu as I used to go there for lunch a lot. I haven't met a menu item that I didn't like. And the desserts are absolutely phenomenal. If you are looking for a spot that is always a hit, this is it. Parking is not too bad if you don't mind walking a little, there's plenty in the garage next door. I've also ordered through the phone a few times and picked up. My favorite items include chicken samosas and any of the salmon dishes. I also love their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake and their 30th anniversary cheesecake. Always good! Enjoy! :)"
AngelsV A.,"Austin, TX",0,176,100,2.0,4/7/2016,"Don't know what ""ambience"" most people are commenting on. If you like it so dark you can barely see your menu then this is the place for you, but wait, there's more! If you love teen parents who always feel the need to dine here while their screaming children disrupt everything for everyone, you'll love this place. I try to only place pick up orders and eat here as less as possible. 4 chances and all at different times and days of the week. Might look classy from the outside but from their customers inside, that says it all. Sorry Cheesecake Factory."
Nicole O.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,233,612,3.0,12/30/2015,"This place was packed when my family came to dine a few nights ago. Although we were told it'd be a 40 minute wait, we were seated after about 20 minutes. Our various meals were quite an assortment. We waited a fairly long time for our food to arrive. Luckily, my mom loves the whole wheat bread in the table basket. My dad ordered off the skinnylicious menu, and his pasta was seriously overcooked. It had the consistency of spoiled rice left at the bottom of a pot. Since it was inedible, he asked for a replacement and was given bowtie pasta with his shrimp with which he was okay. My mom ordered Bang Bang Chicken and was happy with it. I ha the rigatoni with shrimp and Italian sausage. It was passable. Usually I get excited with big portions due to my gluttonous nature, but I wasn't really that amped to eat my leftovers. The remaining dishes were also unremarkable. There were no lights in our eyes as we ate, but no one threw up either. Nevertheless, we were very pleased with our server Josh. He was quite attentive and knew when to interject. Also, we drink a lot of water and were happy with our refills. This restaurant is fine. Not worth a long wait, but due to the extensive menu, a viable option for families that cannot decide what to eat."
Chris W.,"Plano, TX",0,13,,5.0,4/14/2017,One of our family favorite places to celebrate special occasions. Great Customer Service. Gets busy sometimes.
Eve B.,"Fort Hood, TX",184,376,101,4.0,11/5/2014,After a afternoon of small disasters.. We ended up here.. A place that usually make my friend and I happy... Service was wonderful... And the food was fresh and looked so enticing...the orange NOLA hot tea my friend ordered was the perfect thing to warm her up on a cold rainy night.. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp.. I would have liked more shrimp but everything was cook perfect..  BUT.. And here is where I have to take the one star off.. We ordered out cheesecakes to go.. I had wanted to try the peanut butter cup one.. And she had ordered the gadiva chocolate and the pumpkin ... Let say I went home  with the godiva chocolate.. It is good.. But **just a note.. When I called on to let them know there was a mistake made.. They were quick to send me a gift card to replace the two ... Wonderful service..
