Abby Z.,"Plano, TX",5,21,118,4.0,2/13/2016,We love the food here and thewaiters and waitresses are really nice and helpful. We really enjoyed dinner.
Najah A.,"Plano, TX",0,24,7,1.0,9/3/2016,"HORRIBLE. First of all my waitress kept forgetting things. Also, I am so angry right now because I told the waitress that my brother's birthday was today and she told him happy birthday and said they didn't celebrate birthdays. Then I heard behind me a group of waiters singing happy birthday to the table behind us. I got up and on my way out, I noticed that the other table had received a birthday dessert. We had asked the waitress to sing happy birthday for my brother but SHE DIDN'T. I am so pissed off!! Worst Cheesecake Factory ever."
Apryl M.,"Plano, TX",7,35,21,1.0,12/14/2015,"This does NOT even deserve 1 star, so it's unfortunate that I have to even give it that. My husband and I rarely eat out for reasons that will be revealed, but we decided to go out Friday night for a date. When we were seated, the first 2 tables the hostess tried to seat us at, were absolutely disgusting. Crumbs on the tables and the seats and silver wear on the floor under the table. The whole place looked like it had been very poorly cleaned and it's easy to see how that can happen when there's a number of employees just standing around. the food was certainly nothing to brag about. flavorless food that needed acid and fresh herbs. I understand that they are considered a ""nice"" restaurant based on their prices, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. we will NEVER be back, EVER. $73 we wasted that could have been spent at whole foods to buy a nice dinner to prepare at home."
Cody W.,"Springfield, MO",123,20,4,4.0,3/18/2016,"Came here and even though it seemed pretty busy we were deleted quickly. I got a burger that had fried mac and cheese on top! It was great! Food came out pretty quickly and hot. Cheesecake wasn't my favorite considering this is the Cheesecake Factory. But the food is great. The variety of food options they provide is crazy. Everything from steak, to Chinese, to Mexican."
Karen L.,"Dallas, TX",385,505,3058,4.0,8/14/2013,"Is this the place to be or what?  I can't comment much on the food. Mostly because it's a franchise and if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've pretty much tasted them all! With that being said, I must say, this place is always celebrating someone's birthday! There was one random day when we went on a Tuesday night, literally 9 people had celebrated their birthdays in that time! Crazy! I'd get so tired of singing ""Happy Birthday"" to the guests but it was fun!  Sometimes the kitchen messes up your orders but it's not big deal. They're really good and prompt about fixing it and don't make you feel guilty for doing so! I really appreciate that!  Don't forget to get some cheesecake. If you're too full, buy one to go! (Portions are huge!)"
Karri R.,"Allen, TX",0,53,23,4.0,2/9/2017,Visited this family on a Sunday and waited 25 min to get a table . We tried the Shrimp jambalaya and it was ok and Kids had quesadillas and they enjoyed it very much. Tiramisu was the best.
Chad D.,"Plano, TX",89,304,553,1.0,6/15/2014,"we went around 930p last night to have drinks and dessert. we were seated pretty quickly which was nice.  the hostess sat us next to a large group that was celebrating a birthday. as we sat and looked at the menu, another large group sat down on the other side of us. we noticed a waiter came and took drink orders from the table that sat after us, no big deal, maybe we're not in his section. then a girl comes out and takes dessert orders from the birthday group. both the waiter and waitress were now working both tables, bringing out drinks, clearing plates, etc. after 10-15 mins of waiting, a bus boy showed up to clean the booth behind me so I asked him if we could speak with a manager. he found a manager and I assume was telling him we wanted to speak with him. I could tell that the manager was reluctant to come over because he kept looking at our table and looking away as the bus boy was talking to him. he finally came over and the first thing he says was, ""so you guys have been waiting a while?"" I didn't catch his name because he didn't bother introducing himself, so he may not have even been a manager for all we know. all I know of him is that he's tall, skinny and bald. I assume he's a manager because he wasn't in white. but again, he didn't introduce himself so who knows.  we gave the ""manager"" our order and he walks off. a couple minutes later, the girl that was working the birthday table next to us came over to apologize because ""the table you're sitting at hasn't been used all night so we didn't know who it beloved to."" her and the guy waiter were working both tables around us and yet no one bothers to check to see who has the table that's sitting there with menus and no drinks? by the time we finally got our beers and two slices of cheesecakes (that are premade and comes to the restaurant frozen, no cooking required) the table that sat AFTER us already had their food, that I assume is made to order. to the waitress' credit, after we made our complaint, she was very attentive afterwards."
Serg B.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,2.0,7/28/2017,"I'm giving 2 stars because our food was good and some of staff was super nice. However, this does not include our waiter. I'm sure this could be a 4 star review if one of the other staff members was our server. However, since they were not, we ended up having a terrible experience. It was my mother's birthday the other day, so we took her here. Our house is basically in between this location and the North Park one so we decided to switch it up and go here. BIG MISTAKE! Our waiter forgot everything from the simplest thing (bring lemons for our water, despite being asked twice) to gathering a few staffers to sing Happy Birthday. Now, I know they still do it because we heard them sing to no less than 4 other tables that night! What did we get? Our waiter just decided that bringing the cheesecake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate was enough. It's the little things that make an experience great and we did not have those. If you can, just go to the North Park location. Highly disappointed because we love going to Watters Creek."
Lee J.,"Garland, TX",1,5,,1.0,3/20/2016,"I only give this place one star because I couldn't give it less! I have gone to this place on several occasions all special because it has a very nice ambiance. I've had to wait upwards to an hour but,I understood and out was okay. My husband had a surprise birthday dinner for me there a couple of years ago and it went off flawlessly. The person he had in charge of getting there and getting the time slot only had an hour wait and when I got there we were able to walk right back to my waiting party of about 30 guests. This year he chose to go back there and surprise me. My party was yesterday 3/19 I had an idea that he was planning something I just wasn't sure where. We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 7:30 where my gusts had been waiting an hour AND we were told it would be another hour and a half!!! We ended up not getting seated until close to 9:00!!! How ridiculous!!! We spoke to a manager and he said he was trying to help figure out what was talking so long. He didn't come back. Once we were finally seated were given dirty silverware. Without truly knowing who our server was our drink order was finally taken- but not in it's entirety, nude test was taken buy a different guy who wasn't our server but ended up helping her out. He brought us wrapped silverware( the first ones weren't). Our food orders were placed after drink orders were finally corrected. Please tell me WHY ALL OF OUR FOOD ORDERS CAME OUT SEPARATELY????!!!!! There was about a 10 minute lag between each order coming out. This was completely unbelievable! We had to ask for the menu again to order some cheesecake and the girl server asked if we wanted it to go....even though there was at least 45 minutes until closing. I asked the male serverfor the GM's name and number and he was off last night so I couldn't speak with him. I will NOT be going back unless this is rectified. To Create an Environment Where Absolute Guest Satisfaction is their Highest Priority"". And THIS is their motto....I'm sorry Cheescake Factory, you've failed miserably."
Genny B.,"Frisco, TX",0,35,1,5.0,7/3/2016,"Excellent food, excellent service, great ambience, consistent, best cheesecake in America (lol).  But they took off my fav seared ahi tuna entree from menu.  OMG, it was ridiculous (in a GOOD way).  Will always go back.  The wait times are long but I guess that attests to their high demand .  Worth the wait ."
Deb W.,"Rockwall, TX",0,16,1,5.0,7/20/2016,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory didnt disappoint. The staff is cheerful and eager to please. I asked for an ingredient list (due to dietary restrictions) of the key lime cheesecake. As he didnt have paper printouts available, he gladly showed me a download on his iPhone. I am very pleased to see that they dont use soybean oil or flour, just the natural fresh ingredients you would expect from a homemade cheesecake. Reasonably priced. Adequate seating and parking. We WILL return!"
Bianca S.,"Plano, TX",310,392,61,4.0,5/21/2015,"Yes its the same chain that is everywhere around the country but hey they have pretty good food and everyone can find something they like.  Since moving up North, this is my go to spot for when people are in town and we need to find a place where everyone can get something.  Waitstaff has been pretty responsive and friendly and usually the wait for smaller parties isn't too bad.  The lighting gets so dim in here you need to make sure you take a nap before because after the heavy food you will definitely need one after!  Cheesecake is beyond delicious too."
Alexandria S.,"Denton, TX",0,3,1,4.0,7/15/2016,"Food mediocr - BUT KATHLEEN with the short hair and bird tattoo on her forearm, WAS AMAZING.   I love when servers are able to have normal conversations without being fake, and she nailed it.  High five Kathleen.  You rock."
Doug R.,"Allen, TX",2,18,17,4.0,9/26/2014,"My family dined here tonight for my wife's birthday. The location is great and nicely decorated. Our waitress, Kendra, was incredible with awesome service and a positive upbeat personality.  We chose the Cajun chicken littles and the orange chicken. Both entrees were tasty and  were large portions that we all shared.  Of course, the cheesecake is great with many option to choose from.  Overall, this is a good choice when your not sure what you want to eat although it is a bit pricey."
Shauna S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",51,1108,595,5.0,7/7/2015,"Our server Quattra was awesome! He was funny, friendly and helpful. Kept our glasses full. Great lunch deals of crusted Romano chicken, fettuccini Alfredo, and Mac and cheese. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious!"
Mark R.,"Melbourne, FL",11,64,151,4.0,8/16/2015,"Opted for some light dinner choices. The Thai lettuce wraps are very good but this time we had more lettuce than chicken. After a quick conversation with the manager problem solved. The Kale salad was very good. Also had both the tomato basil & sausage flatbreads, I recommend the tomato basil...The whiskey smash is made with bulliet bourbon, very good"
Mykie D.,"Valley Ranch, TX",498,898,757,4.0,6/22/2014,Great customer service. Good food. Convenient location
Maria K.,"Austin, TX",28,103,137,4.0,6/24/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not even gonna lie I come mainly for the cheesecake but order food too..! I have yet to order a bad item but I will say the BBQ chicken ranch salad, Kale/Apple salad and avocado egg rolls are yummy!! I will say the service is lacking here, both times I was here the order was messed up."
Karina F.,"Addison, TX",78,55,62,5.0,1/20/2016,"usually its 3/5 stars but this location was amazing. We were greeted right away and sat withing minutes and we had 6 people. The waitstaff was amazing, we had great appetizers . While everyone had a steak i has a salmon salad, the salmon was a small portion but it was a great yummie salad. For dessert we had red velvet cheesecake and my favorite strabberrry shortcake with ice cream. we will be back!"
Rob W.,"Allen, TX",0,5,1,5.0,10/8/2014,The lemon meringue cheesecake is phenomenal Haha is awesome and super bubbly  I would come back again the only thing that parking stinks
