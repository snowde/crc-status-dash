Raashi S.,"Allen, TX",37,24,4,4.0,12/24/2015,"There's nothing extraordinary about their food, but I ordered the macaroni and cheese burger, and I was very pleased with it. In my opinion however, they have far too many options on their menu, which makes it difficult to choose."
Ranjitha S.,"Allen, TX",1,16,1,1.0,10/23/2016,They did not acknowledge when we entered. After few minutes they checked on us. did not provide brown bread in spite of asking explicitly. The food was bad no taste at all. The pumpkin cheese cake was bit high on sugar. Totally a disappointing dinner date. Service was bad too . Never going again!
Rachel R.,"Georgetown, TX",142,24,8,5.0,3/23/2016,"This place is fantastic! Always has room for us, sometimes tables but usually at the seat-yourself bar area. Great service! Tim at the bar is wonderful. Always go back, always recommend."
Dacia B.,"Fort Worth, TX",92,167,294,5.0,3/15/2014,"I don't have the words to describe how AMAZING cheesecake factory is. You'll always leave saying ""This is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life"". Everything on the menu is great but the shrimp scampi and steak diane is to die for!! Their pineapple mojitos are delicious. And of course their cheesecakes are fabulous. Don't be frazzled when you see their huge menu..they have something for even the pickiest person. I always have an orgasm while eating their food. Seriously. It's that good."
Vinny V.,"Clermont, FL",4,63,63,3.0,2/6/2015,"The wait on a Friday night is at least 45 minutes, but the cheese cake is worth it. Decent service and good food. Our server Q was on point. Took pretty good care of us.  Not bad for the occasional special day, but I wouldn't so this regularly."
Deej N.,"Princeton, TX",7,151,168,2.0,12/30/2015,"I've been here several times and I just don't feel that the quality of the food is worth the price.  We had four in our group and a couple of things had to be sent back because they were not cooked properly.  Would have given three stars for mediocre, but taking a star away for having to send food back."
Lyna N.,"Dallas, TX",209,15,2,3.0,3/18/2016,Food was great! Attitude from the server was not. We were deciding to see which food to get and the server got impatient with us and start rolling her eyes. Whenever she comes to our table she would talk and walk away without finishing the sentence. However to the next time we overheard her complete different tone of service. There was no attitudes over there. It was my first time there and I probably will not return.
Marium H.,"Fort Worth, TX",42,23,5,4.0,2/26/2015,"Had the Ligurian Pasta with angel hair pasta subbed in; it was simply divine. I love pesto, and with a squeeze of lemon, my tastebuds were tingling with pleasure. I ordered a lunch portion, but as expected I took home half the dish; it tasted just as great the next day! For dessert tried both the Kahlua Mocha cheesecake (pass) and the Fresh Banana Cheesecake--the latter was truly an experience to remember! They got that fresh banana flavor spot on! I might just indulge myself again on it next time..."
Mark L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",9,13,11,5.0,3/23/2015,Still the best place to eat when you can't think of anything else to eat. Everything here is just delicious. I always order the hibachi steak and it's weekend so the place was crowded. I never realized that the food was taking so long but the manager and the waiter are always updating us and apologizing. They also made sure that everything was okay on our table. When we ordered dessert it was actually given as a complimentary. Great food and great staff! Good job!
Picky V.,"Prosper, TX",204,130,157,3.0,9/12/2013,"Service: 4 stars Tira Misu Cheesecake: 5 Food: 2 Besides the cheesecake n great service, my husband is right; they have a lot variety, but they lack in uniqueness.  If I wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes to eat there, then is doesn't deserve a 4 star rating.  It's the type of place I'll go to when I'm hungry, but not really craving anything specific."
Katie C.,"Plano, TX",52,51,6,3.0,1/25/2016,"I think this chain's biggest problem is the size of their menu. They need to scale back and focus on doing a few things really well because at this point even their Cheesecake is suffering. If my grandma didn't like this place, we'd never go there anymore."
R P.,"Broken Bow, OK",4,19,5,2.0,10/12/2015,"Hey listen, I have loved Cheesecake Factory for over a decade.  The menu is more than extensive and the service is most usually very good.  HOWEVER...this last visit I bite into a cheeseburger that had no cheese on it.  When I ask the server, she merely takes it back to the kitchen, they slap a crappy old, cold piece of cheese on it, and bring it back half chewed, cold, and 'tainted looking'.  I try not to be overly demanding, but pretty sure the protocol is to leave the food at the table and bring a new, fresh, hot sandwich.  After all, it was the restaurant at fault, yes?  In the end, they comp'd the sandwich, but nothing else.  More importantly, I watched my friends eat and I went home hungry since I didn't eat the crappy burger.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory, D+ this round."
A L.,"Highland Park, Dallas, TX",405,152,39,3.0,11/7/2013,"Hey Yelpers..here comes another foodie review.Called in a curbside to go order and decided to sample a few items. Unfortunately the curbside spots were all full and we had to join a line of cars parked alongside the front of the building..keep In mind I called my order in right at 5pm and I didn't get service at my vehicle until 5:57.. Fortunately,the food was warm and the server had good customer service.  We dined on a classic cheeseburger(very good),shrimp pasta(tasteless and dry),chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes(tasteless and dry),stuffed mushrooms(delectable),fried zucchini(very good).. Overall,impressed with portion size after spending 78 bucks..Found the appetizers and bread loaves more tasty than the main entrees. I have had the cheesecake here before and the Red Velvet was simply sinful..avoid the dessert if you didn't wear your loose fitting attire.."
Ashley F.,"Metairie, LA",40,8,12,5.0,3/29/2015,Omg I just have to say this is the best cheesecake factory I have ever been too. It was so beautiful. Great view of watters creak. The food was wonderful. I would defiantly stop by if you are in the area
Ann B.,"Richardson, TX",21,8,15,5.0,10/14/2015,"We went this past Saturday with our multiple food allergy kiddo.  We all had a wonderful experience!  The server was knowledgeable about allergies and asked appropriate questions.  Our food requests/substitutions for our kiddo's meal were all met (he had the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad and Gluten-free fries).  Our meals- the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Romano and Fried Shrimp were hot and delicious.  The timing and pacing of our meal went really well with teas being filled regularly, cheesecakes being packaged to go along with leftovers to go and bill and paying all very timely.  This is important to us with a younger kiddo. We will come back regularly."
Brittnee M.,"Plano, TX",79,20,37,3.0,12/9/2014,I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was very bland. The chicken was good but the pasta had no taste.  No spice at All. I had to ask for more seasoning. Was quite disappointing.
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,4.0,6/20/2013,"All of the Cheesecake Factory locations are great for their large menu. When you're trying to feed a variety of tastes there's pretty much always something for someone here. I also really love them for their skinnylicious menu now that I'm trying to lose the baby weight! This location is definitely on par with other locations in their food quality. This is what we had: -White Chicken Chili = One of my favorite dishes they have. It's hearty, warm, spicy and filling! I love the heat from the green chilis and it's not thin at all. It's very much like a chili and makes you feel so full with a HUGE amount of flavor. The fact that it's also on their low cal ""skinnylicious menu"" just makes it better. - Miso Salmon - My husband got this (added a picture of it) and not only is it beautifully presented but it's REALLY tasty. Highly recommend it. - Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - Comes with three tacos with chicken and veggies and a spicy sauce. My grandparents both ordered this and although they like spicy they said it was more heat than they expected. Just FYI! They loved it though and felt that the three tacos was a really ample portion. My step-grandmother even brought one home to eat later. - Skinnylicious Grilled Turkey Burger - My mom got this and said that it was tasty. She wasn't ooh'ing and aah'ing over it though. This location lost a star though because I had some of the worst customer service when I went here for Father's Day. We called ahead to see if they were doing a list and the hostess laughed at me and in a rude way said ""Uh, no, we don't do lists."" So I was already irritated when I arrived with my husband and I, our newborn and my grandparents. Then we were seated and had the RUDEST waitress we have ever had, to write all the sarcastic/rude things she said/did would take forever. Just know that in the first 30 mins there (when we still didn't have food) my husband was so appalled by her behavior he went and complained to a manager. So.... food? awesome. Service? Not so much. To be fair, I did see some other nice waiters and waitresses and the manager that apologized to us for our waitress and for our food taking forever (and being wrong once, because our waitress put it in wrong) was also nice. Therefore, 4 stars."
Karl B.,"Forney, TX",27,111,14,5.0,10/21/2015,We go here every year for dessert for my daughter's birthday. I can't review the food but the cheesecake is always awesome. Try the red velvet. The cheesecakes are very rich but you just can't take one bite! The service has always been great. If you have never been to the Cheesecake Factory then you are really missing out. The only disappointing thing is Penny is never working when we go.
Lola V.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,2,,2.0,7/23/2016,"We went to celebrate my birthday and since we just moved into town thought we would stick to what we know. The food was perfection. Consistent with Cheesecake Factory standard. So delicious, but from the moment we entered til the moment we left, the staff    From the hostess to the bartenders, the waiter  and the assistants that helped them run plates were consistent in one attitude and it wasn't one of warmth, friendliness, or welcoming. They were pretty consistent across the board with rudeness, shortness, and as if we the guest were a bother to them.  Although I mentioned it was my birthday they still did nothing  and even getting our check when we were done and had enough of the ""atmosphere"" took forever to get. So much that our family had to just walk out and leave my husband behind to pay because we were just done.  It is sad say and we spent money at the bar and at our table. I would have just given one star but the food was good. So two stars it is. Don't waste your time going here unless you need some good cheesecake. You can spend less and get treated better elsewhere."
Shawn H.,"Wylie, TX",0,23,8,5.0,1/24/2015,Awesome meal tonight with the family's. Service was very good. Had the herb crusted salmon and the shrimp scampi was out of this world. Had the turtle cheesecake for dessert and it was awesome! Love cheesecake factory! Almost perfect every time will come back again.
