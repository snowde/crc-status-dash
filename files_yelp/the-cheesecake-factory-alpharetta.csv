Binita P.,"Atlanta, GA",375,19,180,3.0,1/9/2018,"Let me say before this review that I'm a big proponent of Cheesecake Factory and their food usually always excites me. My visit was a 2-star one, but I have faith in their food and enclosing booths so I'll give it to them. Food: I would not recommend the honey chipotle chicken pasta. The lunch portion is definitely plentiful, though the price is definitely high enough to reflect that. The sauce did have A flavor, but I'm not sure what flavor exactly it was going for - it needed to either be smokier or spicier or something. They cut the asparagus into finger-length pieces but left the chewy stalks in there so I found myself spitting into a napkin. The pasta itself was al dente and I've enjoyed it in other meals. Dessert: We did not get dessert this time, but I have two comments: 1) Eight dollars for a slice of cheesecake!?!?!? 2) The oreo one is my go-to favoriteeee because every bite is magic. Service: While we didn't have any issues with the service, it wasn't particularly special during the lunch hour. The waitresses we had were certainly polite and well-trained for our order and requests, but it was a bit too bustling for them to really feel personable. Seating: The issue with going during the busy times is that the tables that have booths along one side are entirely too close together, so you feel like you are a part of your neighbors' conversations. I had come to have a specific conversation with my lunch date that I didn't end up getting to, and I also had our neighbors chiming in giggles to some of my comments (which I don't blame them for)."
Ray I.,"Roswell, GA",79,132,514,3.0,1/4/2018,"While I still think their menu is way too large (18 pages!), and after several visits here I am still amazed at the cost of some of their items, this location does have fantastic service.  In this most recent visit it easily  bought them another full star. We had the fried cauliflower and beet salad with goat cheese as apps - and the cauliflower was amazing.  The beet salad was tasty,  but very short on the actual beets. We chased those with the soup of the day, a chili and chicken vegetable that was seasoned very well. Overall I still think they are too expensive for a routine lunch stop, but the service and food are truly very good."
Craig C.,"Kennesaw, GA",7,10,,1.0,12/10/2017,"A visually striking restaurant, with some very serious flaws: 1) I was there with a party of 6. The meals came out at drastically different times, over 10 minutes between the first and last plate. Everyone being polite, they waited for all meals to be served...which resulting in some people eating cold food.  2) The server was exceptionally ill-trained on how to serve wine. She was surprised that the person who ordered the wine would want to sip it before it was served to the rest of the table (as is customary). ""You wanna check it, yo?""  3) The bathrooms were in terrible shape. I won't go into details.  Bottom line, this place needs to either start hiring better people, or invest in significant training."
Lindsey W.,"Roswell, GA",204,130,117,4.0,12/2/2017,"My grandma and I have a tradition of dining at this particular Cheesecake Factory every Black Friday.  Of course, on Black Friday you are waiting for a table no matter when you come in.  This year we had my mom with us and I'm not sure she's a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory.     Since I have to eat mainly Gluten Free it can be hard for me to find places that understand or accommodate allergies.  The Cheesecake Factory did a great job and I had my favorite burger since I've had to go GF: the Americana Burger with a Gluten Free bun.  I seriously want to go back just to eat this burger.  My mom ordered a kale salad and kept eating my leftovers because the burger was that good!  I also ordered the GF Godiva to go.  I really want that cake for my birthday since Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and even their GF Cheesecake is perfect.   My only complaints were that our waitress was sat like four times in a row which threw off our service but it was extremely busy and that can happen anywhere when hosts aren't paying attention.  Also, the GF bun did not hold up to the burger completely but it did have a good flavor - they could definitely look into new vendors for that."
Susan K.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,144,339,5.0,8/1/2017,I came in for lunch and was seated on the outside patio right away (there was a longer wait to sit inside).   My server came out to greet me pretty quickly and she was very friendly.  She also brought me a bread basket and my ice tea right away.   For those who have not been to a Cheesecake Factory it may take a bit to decide what to eat as the menu is around 20 pages long. :)  I ordered off the lunch menu: Everything pizza and salad.  The salad was very large with mixed greens and tomatoes with choice of dressing.  Everything was very good!  After eating the bread and salad I was not even able to finish my pizza.  :) Based on this experience I would highly recommend this location!  PS If you can save room for cheesecake (or come in specifically for it) you won't be disappointed!!!
Katrina B.,"Greenville, NC",4,25,111,2.0,1/3/2018,"I was visiting from out of town and decided to stop by The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered chicken samosas, cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya (minus the shrimp), teriyaki chicken, slice of strawberry cheesecake, and a raspberry lemonade. I initially called for curbside service but somehow the hold time on the phone was terrible so I decided to just go ahead in. The place was packed. It could've been due to the fact that it was New Year's Day. It took about 30 from placing my order to receive my food. I will start with the good food first. The samosas were amazing. The cheesecake was very rich. Now onto the not so good.... the teriyaki chicken was drowning in sauce. The sauce overwhelmed the chicken. My friend couldn't even finish it.  The Cajun chicken jambalaya was by far the worst I have ever had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. The pasta was NOT seasoned at all. It really tasted as if the cook forgot that the pasta went with the chicken and had to hurry up and boil it and throw it on the plate. It was dry and very bland. If I ever find myself back in this area I'll try a different dish on the menu."
Fiona K.,"Alpharetta, GA",3,14,72,5.0,9/21/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always a go to for me for dinner when I'm out with the family and we can't decide on a place to go. Everything I have tried at cheesecake is usually always solid. It's a safe choice for me on a week night when I don't want to try something new. The service is a hit or miss depending on the waiter and their experience. I can always tell when someone is new. Cheesecake is a great place for a larger party and has something for everyone. I always have a good time with family here and usually no one has any complaints with their food. Couple items that I usually get here that I like are the Miso Salmon, Santa Fe Salad, Asian Lettuce Taco's, Chicken Dumplings, and Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake. If you live in Atlanta, and never been to Cheesecake, then you should try it out. I recommend it, specially if you have a large party and can't decide on where to go."
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,5.0,10/17/2017,I enjoy cheesecake factory. There is always something on their menu for me. I had the Thai lettuce wrap. Delicious and low calorie.
Andre' M.,"Johns Creek, GA",69,395,97,2.0,1/21/2017,"An hour long wait for overpriced, bland, incorrectly assembled food with subpar service. My barbecue chicken ranch salad was advertised to be piled high with crispy onions. It came without the onions. By the time I got the correct one back, without an apology from the server,  just about everyone else was finished with their meal. If the server had only apologized for the error, I would have felt much better. The salad had to have been missing the dressing. Very bland. Not too good. The corn and beans must have come straight from the can to my salad. I could have easilly assembled this salad at home in minutes for probably less than two dollars. I gave an extra star because my daughters liked their meals, otherwise it would have been a one from me. I just don't understand why people are so attracted to this chain."
Justin M.,"Cumming, GA",0,30,7,2.0,10/19/2017,"Gone downhill. Used to be a great restaurant to take your family and get quality food however I find that not to be the case lately.  There used to be a burger with pulled brisket on top with slaw - man was that good - they took this off the menu before I could go back for seconds. They used to have those cute little butter portions wrapped in gold foil when you get your bread - now it's just a lump of butter in a dish. They used to bring out a large boat of ranch when asked for a side of ranch now it's just a small dish - a kids portion. Oh speaking of ranch - my last visit involved the server getting my order wrong, billing me for the wrong items, and dropping ranch all over my left side without an apology. The result of management was to provide a small gift certificate that want even cover the tip amount for a future visit. There are clearly better restaurants in this class. Re think your visit"
Bryan L.,"Johns Creek, GA",92,158,126,3.0,6/30/2017,"Came in here right before the lunch rush, was seated promptly and given water and bread while browsing through the menu. My server was friendly and gave a bunch of suggestions for items on the menu. The menu was really long and wordy, maybe like 20 pages of different appetizers, entrees, salads, sandwiches, etc. Desserts weren't even included on the main menu.  For my appetizer I ordered the ahi tartare, which was this chopped up raw tuna tossed with avocado and soy-ginger sesame sauce. It was served in a pool of the sauce, along with four crispy  nacho chips. The tuna was fine, tasted pretty fresh. However, the sauce was salty....really salty. I got hints of the sesame oil flavor, but the soy sauce really overpowered the rest of the appetizer, something easily avoided if the amount of soy sauce was reduced. Overall, it was a decent dish with good presentation. I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo as my entree. It was a stew of chunks of chicken and shrimp served with a bowl of rice in the middle. One word to describe it: heavy. It was too much for even a guy like me, I had to take about a fourth of it as takeout. It wasn't really because there was too much on the plate, there was a fair portion, but the amount of butter and thickness in the stew just made it really heavy. The gumbo was also a tad bit underseasoned, at least better than the salt lake of an appetizer I had. The chicken was cooked tender, and the shrimp had a fair texture as well. I thought the food they served here was fine. Server was also attentive and filled my bread bowl and water glass whenever it was running low."
Vivian S.,"Toronto, Canada",25,133,250,2.0,10/28/2017,"I mean it's the same menu but why is this place so crazy underlit?    The menu was large, thenportiins larger and the staff friendly but when you can't see well you have to wonder.. are they trying to hide Something?"
Michele T.,"Atlanta, GA",52,91,334,4.0,10/20/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is 1) a place to buy cheesecake, 2) a factory... I'm not necessarily fan and it wouldn't be my first choice. But my friend had a gift card.  So to Cheesecake Factory we go. Whenever I have had the occasion to eat here I order the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I enjoy both dishes.  Well tonight was no different.  Both items were consistent and plenty of food.  In fact, we shared both items and had leftovers.  We had a child with us and he ordered the chicken fingers with fries.  His order was also very generous.  Our server Aaron was very attentive.  After dinner he suggested dessert, Cheesecake anyone??  Well I opted for the carrot cake.  Aaron came to the table with a HUGE piece of cake.  I was not a fan of the carrot cake and Aaron was kind enough to take it off the check.  By the way the coffee was delicious!!!  All in all the CF didn't disappoint!!! I'm sure I'll be back!!!  Thanks again Aaron!!!"
Sandeep G.,"Alpharetta, GA",37,213,6,2.0,5/14/2017,"We went for a Mother's Day lunch and it was disappointing. The wait time was 30 minutes at 11:30 AM which was expected. We got our table before 12:00  Noon, so that was good. We ordered for our lunch when we checked after 30 minutes, we were told in a very Matter-of-fact way that the ""kitchen was super busy"" so our order WILL get delayed. My daughter who was getting late actually left without eating and we got her food to go.  Since we were waiting and it was 12:30 PM I requested for a Beer which came half-way through my lunch. We ordered for ""Chicken Bellagio"" which was taken to-go. I ordered for ""Roadside Slider"" and ""Stuffed Mushrooms"" which were good and my wife ordered ""Buffalo Blast"". Buffalo Blast was supposed to be Chicken and Cheese in Buffalo Sauce all stuffed in a spicy shell. All we got was the shell with little or no chicken and some cheese. It was, on the whole, a very disappointing experience."
John S.,"Woodstock, GA",56,665,257,3.0,2/6/2017,"What are your food / dining intentions? This place is extremely popular, and there is a fair chance you'll have to wait before being seated. The menu is inviting and certain to tantalize anyones tastebuds.  The food tastes pretty good. It's a tad pricey, drinks are too. We enjoyed out meal.  We didn't wait the 45 minutes, instead we stalked tables in the bar area - waiting to sit earlier.  We waited about 10 minutes doing this. Comfort food."
Tianna H.,"Alpharetta, GA",4,57,72,3.0,3/26/2017,"Came in treating mi madre once again on this beautiful Sunday afternoon. The place was pretty packed but had a group of two-seater tables so we opted for the cramped space.  Appetizer: crab and artichoke dip  Entrees: chicken alfredo and the chargrilled New York steak with mashed potatoes and green beans I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri.  Honestly it was ok but for $72 (before taxes) for a step above Applebee's I have to say for this ticket we probably could've tried something new on my list and been much more satisfied...but when you're hungry and in a rush this ole reliable is alright.  So if you're strolling from North Point Mall and you're not really in the mood for food court munchies, this will hit the dine in spot without having to drive too much further."
Daniel G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,1,4.0,9/19/2017,"I was a little skeptical considering some of the reviews, but I honestly had a great experience here. Jessica served me at the bar and gave fantastic service. Food came out quickly and was exactly how I ordered it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a typical Cheesecake experience"
Abhilasha R.,"Johns Creek, GA",0,11,2,1.0,8/25/2017,"Worst service every time we've been there. We had Courtney the last time we went. She convinced us she was racist in our opinion, so the manager told us she would take over. We mentioned how we noticed she engaged in no conversation to ppl of color, but greeted and spoke to tables that werent. We told the manager and it was obvious she saw it too because she then went over and spoke to the table that was given the silent treatment by Courtney. Now, had she thought there was no merit to our observation, she would've spoken to the other tables being ""served"" by her. This location needs a customer service training. Not even the managers are up to cheesecake standards, based on the numerous locations we eat at nationwide.  This isn't too be mean, but to hope they better their service. The hostesses have the attitude like they're doing the guests a favor. Nope, it's your job."
Veronica V.,"New Albany, IN",4,91,49,1.0,8/20/2017,Waited twenty minutes (15 or so employees standing around doing nothing) while we were in the bar area for drinks and apps.  Customers complaining and having to go literally grab a server in order to get served.  A gentleman finally took our drink order after we asked for a manager and a server - but he did indicate that someone else was our server.   Dirty table the entire hour we sat here while the servers stood and watched the Falcons game.  Classy.
Kate H.,"Indiana, PA",34,2,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Very disappointing lunch, which took over 2 hours with wait time for our table and then for our food. Wait staff was friendly, but we hardly saw our server, because she was so busy. Food was mediocre, and they brought the wrong order for my husband. Won't be back."
J B.,"Roswell, GA",0,29,60,1.0,9/10/2017,I have to give 1 star purely for the $6 12oz MIller lite. And $6.50 12oz Sam Adams. Airport prices in Alpharetta??? Ridiculous. Never go back.
Andy B.,"Roswell, GA",6,73,30,2.0,1/2/2017,"Where to start? It was meal of highs and lows. Seven of us are here on New Year's Day. Service was fantastic. Our server, BJ, was so kind and patient and attentive. She was great. French onion soup was delicious (but they only serve it on Monday so if you want it, plan accordingly). Dynamite shrimp was a let down. Basically fried shrimp with remoulade on the side, meh. Spinach dip met mixed reviews. I wasn't impressed but others liked it fairly well. The main meal is where the wheels fell off. I chalk this place up to Gordon Ramsay' maxim that a restaurant with an extensive multi page menu can't possibly make it all fresh and do it well.  I got the French dip and it was so fatty I couldn't get past the third bite. Southwest salad had an odd mix of flavors that didn't work together for some reason. The gumbo, well, it ain't real gumbo. My son's medium well bacon cheeseburger was more of a charcoal briquette with slices of thinner charcoal on top. My daughter's kid cheese pizza smelled and tasted like chlorine, weird, right? My father in law liked his Cobb salad and my other son liked his fish and chips (and I loved the cole slaw that he gave me.) Overall, it was barely an OK experience. But for the price, I'd prefer to take my family elsewhere."
Halle' P.,"Duluth, GA",172,3,,5.0,11/17/2017,"AMAZING food and various choices to choose from such as Italian, American, Mexican, Chinese, etc. Great options for vegetarians and people that want gluten free. Management and staff are outstanding (ask for Essence as your server.) Positive attitudes and great customer service over all!"
Markia M.,"Norcross, GA",0,3,3,5.0,8/28/2017,Great customer service. Already know they have the best cheesecakes! I just tried the new celebration cheesecake. Its sooo delicious. Im in love. Hands down the BEST version of a birthday cake in taste & flavor!
Dan F.,"Allen, TX",0,9,1,1.0,12/19/2017,I called to place a to-go order and was placed on hold.  After 5 minutes I assumed they had forgotten about me so I hung up and called back.  Was placed on hold again and after another 5 minutes hung up for good.  Don't waste your time with the apathetic service here when there are many other restaurants in the area that actually want your business.
Victoria E.,"Killeen, TX",16,3,1,1.0,9/12/2017,Just had super bad service. She checked on us while we were eating one time and that was just in time for us to ask for Togo boxes because we were already long done with our food. She spent her entire time up at the hostess stand. Then when she gave us the check she came by like every two seconds asking if she could take the check book. Where was that kind of service when I actually needed it when I was eating. So disappointed in my lunch there today. Oh and she didn't even give us any bread.
Amy S.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,40,53,5.0,7/30/2017,"Love the cheesecake!  We went on National Cheesecake Day so our cheesecake slices were half off. The staff was friendly and helpful. We went at 10AM to avoid the lines (definitely recommend!). There was absolutely no wait, and we got our cheesecakes immediately to-go.  We got the banana cream cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake, and Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake. All were great!"
Jeff F.,"Cumming, GA",87,6,,1.0,8/27/2017,I was with a party of 4 and it was 8/27/17 at 530 pm. It was only half full at dinner. We sat and waited for a server for 10-15 minutes. Then we waited for 4 waters for another 10 minutes. Server acted like we were inconveniencing her. We ordered and when the food arrived two meals were Burnt and I ordered a flat bread and I received an entire pizza. After the server dropped our meals off we did not see her for another 15 or 20 minutes to check on Meals. My friend sent his back and by that point the rest of us were about through eating. What's the point in remaking his meal when we were all done. Then some kid manager came over and didn't even know how to handle the situation. Only thing fast all night was when they dropped the check and then they picked it right up!! We will never go back to this location!
Ana Maria L.,"Alpharetta, GA",13,52,48,1.0,8/15/2017,"8-14-2017 (Monday and the place was half empty) Run don't walk away from this place!!! HORRENDOUS! 1. We had a party of 10- they refused to sit us even though they had tables. Made us wait 40 minutes. We asked for the manager and explained a party of 10 gives you more $ than you seating singles one at a time (they had sat 3 singles in a row- where they could have joined tables and sat us.) He sat us after we pointed out his hostesses poor hostessing skills. 2. Sat us, finally, and we told the waitress to divide bill and add the birthday girl to each of us. Apparently they can only divide 4 ways (though we NEVER have a PROBLEM at any other restaurant) and we tip well knowing we are a party of 10. Well that wasn't going to work because it was 10 of us. They finally said they could only divide it by 9. Uh, what?!!? So we told them, fine do it by 9. They got it wrong. They had to re-do and reprint all the bills again.  Took over an hour to get our bills.... 3. Unpleasant experience when we were trying to take our birthday girl out to enjoy her birthday. They practically threw her cheesecake at us and ran. 4. We tipped the girl 18 to 20% even though her service was horrendous and I haven't even delved into it in this review nor will I bother you elaborating on it. 5. Several of our 10 attendees got food poisoning. That should tell you all you need to know right there!!! RUN, RUN don't even enter this place."
Cheri R.,"Dawsonville, GA",6,21,10,1.0,8/6/2017,"On Sunday- July 30th- National Cheesecake day CF was offering the promo of 1/2 price cheesecake w the meal. My husband & I arrived around 4ish for dinner.  We placed our order for dinner after ordering a tea & appetizer. After a long wait 40 min. later, our food finally arrived at our table & it wasn't what we ordered. Our waitress asked the manager JOHN COOPER to come to our table in regards to the situation.  He finally came to the table, didn't introduce himself as the manager or anything. We conveyed to him the plates of food on the table were not what we ordered. He stood there looking at the food & then said, ""I'll take them off your bill"".  He didn't say ""I'M SORRY FOR THIS"" which a paying customer would expect or to perhaps be offered to have what we ordered remade... NOTHING. After we received our bill I asked him why was our bill still $24.66 assuming he would comp at least half our bill for the inconvenience of the long wait for our order & it being the wrong food, & having to leaving hungry. He said (as if it was a favor he was doing us) ""Well I deducted the price of the two meals you ordered and you are only charged for the appetizer & tea & you're already getting your cheesecake 1/2 off."" (because of the 1/2 off promo). My husband & I just looked at each other in disbelief. So we left after leaving the waitress a tip & paying our bill. We drove to another restaurant to get a meal.  The waitress Claire was very nice & kept checking on our order. I called the restaurant after I left to confirm the managers name --JOHN COOPER. He is not an asset to the company at all in my opinion. Surely not manager material. I won't be in any hurry to return."
Sari S.,"Duluth, GA",177,258,2354,3.0,4/17/2016,"Last Visit: 03/05/2016 Overall, I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I'm only giving this location 3 stars because of their customer service. Let's just say I had an issue at one point and their only solution was trying to give me money, but without apologizing. Sorry, but I don't need money. I need you guys to understand that it was wrong to be neglectful and think it's okay. To top it all off, it was the manager that did that :/ So...I am mixed whenever I come here."
Eddie K.,"Duluth, GA",0,15,8,5.0,7/2/2017,Cheese cake factory rocks! Our favorite wait person is Jabari! He is awesome and will missed as he is transferring to CF in NYC. However the food is always good as well as the service!
Melissa M.,"New York, NY",49,57,154,4.0,4/18/2017,I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory for some time but they really stepped their game up! The food presentation was perfect and the food was delicious! Unfortunately we were too full to have any cheesecake. This is my favorite spot again!
Sebastian E.,"Atlanta, GA",2,18,14,3.0,12/26/2016,"This is not my favorite location but the food was good. The service was slow and in general was not that clean.. The table, floors and bathrooms all needed attention. I may return but won't be in a rush to do so."
Rusty S.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,7/4/2017,"Favorite restaurant in Colorado. Having just moved to ATL, couldn't wait to take my sister to the restaurant we have been raving about. Night and Day. Service at this location was bad and food was average. Server acted as though she didn't want to be there and was rude when we asked questions. Told her when we got there that we loved the bread, took fifteen minutes for it to come and were never offered more. Place was empty and dirty tables everywhere. Water was refilled only upon request, no ice, room temperature. Meal finally came and my wife asked for Parmesan cheese.  It never came. My daughter ordered a kids meal but never got her drink, when we asked the server, her reply was ""she never asked for it"". Food was cold.  Overall, very disappointing."
Beth S.,"Alpharetta, GA",90,3,,4.0,8/12/2017,I really like this restaurant. It offers many different cheesecakes and food options. May need to improve in customer service Though.
Datka G.,"Alpharetta, GA",29,4,5,1.0,8/1/2017,"Typically I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location needs to step it up. It is so dirty! The silverware was dirty- 2 sets and the plates. My drink had something floating in it so had to be returned... just gross! I wanted to leave but my lunch guest who had never been wanted to stay. I ended up getting a cup of hot water to soak my utensils and clean. This is the type of actions I expect at a late night Waffle House, not the Cheesecake Factory in Alpharetta! I had the a Renee special- it came with onion soup, 1/2 chicken salad sandwich, and a side salad. The soup of the day was onion - cold and disgusting. The side salad was only greens and dressing, the chicken salad sandwich was good. After we left, I ended up going to chicfila."
Jamia C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Placed a pick up order, for delivery as I had done before through a third party delivery service.  After opening my bags I had not received an entire Four Cheese Pasta I ordered and my sons dinner was barely warm. I contacted the Cheesecake Factory in Alpharetta about missing meal since they bag it, the manager questioned that order was even placed!! Kids chicken fingers were cold, my food not in bag, and NO BREAD AT ALL. CHEESECAKE FACTORY FAILED MISERABLY THIS TIME, my last order a week ago was complete, hot, and bread was included as specified, not sure if the end of the night was the issue but I will not order from them again especially considering management questioning the validity of a customer who has spent 100 bucks in a week ordering from them. Will review on other outlets as well."
Valerie G.,"Sandy Springs, GA",19,3,4,5.0,10/20/2017,"Great food, great service. Shout out to our server Jackie from Savannah, she was AWESOME."
Edward H.,"Roswell, GA",32,6,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory delivered the worst meal I've had in any ATLANTA restaurant. The shrimp basket was 8 large pieces of dry flattened meat that might have been chicken or might have been shrimp. I sent it back. Maybe a simple medium rare burger with a salad would be better. Nope. The unsmiling manager removed the shrimp from our bill. She seemed angry.  The burger was well done and a little burned on the outside. They forgot to send the salad. When the salad came it was a huge amount of chopped greens with no dressing or any other ingredients. How do you mess up salad?  The server tried to correct the meal but the kitchen ruined every item. I'll never visit another Cheesecake Factory. It was a total disaster from end to end. I left the meal hungry because the food was that badly prepared.  Based on other reviews, this location may or may not cook your order correctly. Don't waste your time at this restaurant."
