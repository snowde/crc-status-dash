Ashley S.,"Panama City, FL",67,98,15,3.0,12/29/2010,Great food but service was a little off.  All of our food did not come out at the same time.  Some of the special request items that we asked for were not brought with our meal.  Our drinks were not kept full at all times.  The food was wonderful!  I had the renee special without the soup because they had a mushroom soup that night and I DO NOT like mushroom.  I find it a little odd that they don't have more than one soup a day.  Just peak over there menu and you will know why that is strange to me.  100 different dishes but only one soup. My sandwich was good as well as my salad.  Everyone else at the table stated that there meals were good as well.  I will try again and hope for better service.
Lindsay H.,"Roswell, GA",0,7,,4.0,8/20/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory may be a little pricey, But the food is amazing. We have never had anything we didn't like. we will deff be going back soon."
Mike N.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2014,"Absolutely horrendous service on a slow Sunday morning. Waited almost 10 minutes to be seated when there were numerous tables available and the hostesses were extremely rude. The bread that they are so famous for was clearly stale and left over from the previous night. Service at the table was extraordinarily slow - my wife had to ask for her soup 3 times and on the 3rd attempt the waitress actually said ""was that a cup or a bowl?""... Really???? The food was good but didn't come close to making up for the terrible service. Have eaten at CCFs all over the country and this was the WORST experience I've ever had. They are lucky the cheesecake is so good otherwise we would never go back."
Christine K.,"Johns Creek, GA",47,179,,3.0,6/14/2010,"I used to be absolutely IN LOVE with Cheesecake Factory. Like, it used to be hands-down my favorite restaurant. And then, one day, I realized that the menu is actually not that fantastic and they only make you think it's fantastic because of the reputation of the restaurant. Dishes are just not that awesome when you factor in important things like price and taste.  If I rate *only* the cheesecake, it's a definite solid 4 stars, but if I consider everything else, then the rating just spirals down. While I am not a fan of their menu, I *am* a real fan of the cheesecake, which makes a lot of sense since, well, duh... it's called the Cheesecake Factory. However, I feel like the price for a slice can go down at least $1-2; it is a pretty steep price to pay for some yummy in your tummy. Key lime cheesecake = win!"
Allyson R.,"Alpharetta, GA",210,601,434,4.0,8/26/2010,"First off, I love Cheesecake Factory.  Everytime I go to Cheesecake factory I always order the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, because it's the best BCS EVER!!  BUT, I have become a vegetarian in the last year and can no longer order the BCS.  When my friend invited me to dinner here, I thought , 'oh no, no buffalo chicken?! what will i get?!?!'....I accepted her invitation anyway. I arrived to a VERY crowded parking lot around 7pm, and found a spot in the back.  I was seated immediately in the bar area (at a table though), and that was fine with me.  They also have a HUGE outdoor seating area, but it was so hot that I don't think it was open.   Once my friend arrived the waitress was prompt to bring over the bread and water, and explain anything on the menu.  She returned a few minutes later to take our order.  I ended up getting the Portabella Mushroom sandwich.  I wasn't sure how it would be, but I love mushrooms so I gave it a go.  The food came out after 15-20 minutes and I was SO happy I ordered it!  With the first bite there was a flavor burst and everything tasted amazing! The service was great and the waitress was quick with refills and getting anything else we requested. Cheesecake factory also has the BEST BLUE CHEESE EVER....so don't skip that (it's great with the fries!)! I'll definitely be visiting this location again :-)"
Cathy T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,1.0,1/12/2014,"Sad to say that their service has gone way down. The waitress was very sweet, however, she appeared overwhelmed with her tables. She brought our drinks and my Dr. Pepper was missing the flavor (the syrup canister needed to be changed out.) Waitress took 10 minutes to bring me a new soda, which ended up being a diet Dr. Pepper (I did not order diet.)  10 minutes after this she brought me the right soda. Our meals were served haphazardly. Mine first, 5 minutes later my husband steak (with no steak knife), 3 minutes later my daughters pasta missing the cheese, 5 minutes later my husbands fries and steak knife, 2 minutes later the cheese for the pasta. When my husband received his steak knife he discovered they cooked his steak medium. He ordered it rare and the waitress had even came back to the table after taking the order to double check how he wanted it cooked. He asked for them to cook a new steak. Fifteen minutes later, my daughter and I had finished our meals and my husbands steak still had not been brought out and our drinks had not been refilled. At this point we just asked for the steak to be removed from the bill. We paid and left. Very poor service all around. We didn't even get an apology from a manager."
Robert H.,"Marietta, GA",7,147,35,3.0,9/15/2010,I used to live walking distance from the one in Buckhead until I sold up and moved to the boonies so know the menu well.  This is the second time I have been to the one in North point and for some reason the second time I have a stomach ache after eating the food. Could it be the massive portions of food.... I think it very well maybe. large menu comfort food type selections. It's OK I would say its a good place for large groups. I mean that place can accommodate 504 seats if I recall 400 inside and 104 on the patio. Also the bar area at this location seems to be a good size.
Jena P.,"Cumming, GA",4,8,,4.0,2/3/2013,"This was my second time at this location. This time for lunch. I've never been the biggest fan of The Cheesecake Factory. Bigger menus scare me; how can you be great at that many dishes?? I haven't had too much on their menu, but what I have had has been great. For lunch my mom and I split the Asian Lettuce wraps, which were good, but nothing amazing. And these salmon rolls, which were incredible. We had Key Lime Cheesecake which was amazing! And their coffee is delicious. I love the glasses the coffee comes in.  I really wanted to write this review for the service, however. I'm big on service. The two hostesses were friendly, more so the guy than the girl. Now our server was great. Very friendly. I wasn't expecting much, but was taken by surprise with him! Wonderful server. Made a couple of subtle recommendations without being annoying about it. Attentive without being intrusive.  There was another waitress who commented on how cute my 7 mo. old was and noticed he was teething. She offered to bring over a banana and some bread for him to chew on. I couldn't believe it when she brought over a small plate of already cut pieces of banana and thinly sliced bread. That was SO incredibly sweet of her! I like when servers think of these extra things that I don't even think of. My son was so content eating his banana pieces and eating his little puff snacks in his high chair. She kept checking back to make sure he was all right and continued to compliment him and inquired about this and that. We appreciated the extra attention :) And she wasn't even our server!  My mom and don't like to be rushed and we just wanted to sip our coffee and talk and take our time. I think our waiter caught on to that and just let us be. But at the same time noticed exactly when we were done and we weren't sitting any longer than we wanted to.  Just great all around. I had no intentions of going back, but I think we will because of this visit. Hopefully they are consistent!! The last time I went for dinner they were great for my birthday, but that was three years ago, so, we'll see!!! :)"
Krystal K.,"Alpharetta, GA",35,69,6,3.0,7/15/2012,"I've been here a couple times in the last month and I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.  The service is usually pretty good here, if not a little slow. They are a big restaurant, though, so I take that into consideration. The food here is strange.. Most of the apps are good, as well as the pastas, but the salads and sandwiches I've tried were just blah..... The cheesecake is great and the cocktails look fabulous. I don't know if I would continue to come here for the food. I would definitely come here for coffee and cheesecake (or perhaps a cocktail and cheesecake?? Yes I would.)"
Elizabeth F.,"Norcross, GA",0,33,,1.0,7/4/2014,"Gross.  I ordered the Buffalo Bites appetizer served with a side of celery for dipping.  Celery looked like it had been in my fridge for 6 weeks.  Tops of the leaves were brownish orange.  I wondered how anyone could have plated it and I wondered how my waiter could have served it and I wondered how old their food was.  I showed the server, she took it to the drink station, picked off the offending stalk and tossed it in the trashcan.  She then reserved it.  I barely ate any of it.  And she looked at me like I was being ""difficult""."
Kunal S.,"Roswell, GA",1,13,,2.0,6/25/2014,"The food is always very bland. I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta but Ive been here before and have ordered other items and have never been impressed.  The problem is not locale but just Cheesecake Factory in general.  The menu is just too large with too many different types of food and so everything just comes out with the same bland taste.  The service was mediocre on this occasion, but it's usually hit or miss.  The cheesecakes are great though and the portions are huge.  I always have the same experience at Cheesecake Factory but for some reason I return bc I feel like it will get better bc of the perception that it is a ""nice"" restaurant.  Their food is just not any good and so I will not return to eat at this one or any other CF."
Ancestral G.,"Brooklyn, NY",112,14,,5.0,12/19/2011,"Not just cheesecake!!! fantastic food, generous portions and a great atmosphere.  This is one of the few places where the waiters are greatly accommodating and i didn't mind giving a New York style tip!!!"
Vee W.,"Atlanta, GA",7,25,2,2.0,7/14/2012,This place is very busy. I place an order that they said would take 20 minutes. I went to pick it up and they said oh it's not ready 31 minutes later. Which is crazy.  Don't tell me a time if it's not true.
Leah Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",167,253,221,5.0,11/16/2011,"it was so good I went back the next day, the first visit was no wait the food was cooked very well ordered the salmon with mashed potato's and sweet potato french fried it was very tasty, second visit long line it was a friday but over all worth the wait"
Candis B.,"San Diego, CA",1,35,,3.0,2/8/2010,"I am not really a fan of Cheesecake factory. To me it's just overrated...but I actually chose to go there for lunch today. I still am not sure why...maybe it's because my pregnant friend told me that she was seeing the chocolate cake from there in her dreams....and I just wanted to get a glance at it! Anyway, our server Steven was very nice and patient. Once I sat down, I remembered why I was not a fan. The menu is just too much! I honestly don't want that many choices when I go to a restaurant. And the portions are ridiculously embarrassing....including the lunch portions. I think that this restaurant is everything that is wrong with our obese country!  But I will say that you do get your moneys worth....if thats a big deal to ya! The food was not that fantastic...just typical American....but at least I got to get a glimpse of ""The Chocolate Cake."" I will go back as long as I am not paying for my own food!"
Stephanie R.,"Miami, FL",36,55,58,4.0,11/22/2011,"Went to this location for the first time with my 10 year old, yesterday.  Very clean, nice waiter and food was hot/fresh.  The bathrooms could use a little cleaning but overall this location was nice.  We went during lunch time rush hour and were still served by an attentive waiter.  Parking was great and they offer outdoor seating as well.  I like the fact that this location is located within the North Point Mall area.  You turn a corner and into the mall parking lot you go!"
Lyn B.,"Roswell, GA",0,1,,2.0,10/5/2014,"I've enjoyed this great restaurant for years. Initially in Los Angeles, now here. I've been in Atlanta for a little over 10 years and I'm taking the time to do a review. Not good. New to the Alpharetta area, I've noticed a disturbing trend with the food quality, preparation and presentation at TCCF at North Point. It seems to have changed about 2-3 years ago maybe but change it has. the Chinese chicken salad appeared to be shards and scraps off a well used carcass. No pieces were identical in texture or size. They were really just bits and pieces.  Really barely enough to identify it as a chicken salad. The dressing was not the usual consistency of the usual Plum dressing- not sure what's going on there, the bun on the sliders was pinched in the cover and noticeably so. A quick swap with a good bun would have gone a long way in presentation of food. I had take out and I did mention this to the VERY nice front staff. (it wasn't worth the extra time to wait for another bun for me. I didn't realize the chicken bits until driving home) My thoughts are- you have an award winning restaurant and good clientele. Why lose it over chicken bits, and squeezed buns. I don't normally write reviews, but I rely on them when I'm considering a new venue and thought this one rises to the occasion. Really, we all work hard and want to enjoy the infrequent times we are able to go out for dinner. This was not worth the money- on several occasions- and it's a shame for an industry that can do much better, not to maintain a standard of quality in their signature product- food."
Erin D.,"New York, NY",785,342,58,4.0,3/7/2009,"This rating speaks for only one item on the menu, and it's amazing: the Thai Lettuce Wraps. On the appetizers list, this generous portion makes a filling meal for one person. The colorful plate includes purple cabbage, large lettuce leaves that serve as the ""wrap"", shredded carrots, sprouts, noodles, cucumbers, and tender Thai-spiced chicken. It's accompanied by three sauces on the side that really make the meal: a lime/cilantro dressing, a hoisin/soy sauce (my least favorite of the three), and peanut sauce. You make your own wraps, and it does get pretty messy, but well worth it. At around $10, it's one of my favorite affordable, fresh, and healthy meals, and it is a unique choice on the Cheesecake Factory menu.  The service is fine, the waits can be somewhat slow at times, but anything remotely negative is outshined by this delicious dish. The unsweetened mango tea is great, too."
Thien D.,"Woodstock, GA",181,59,1,1.0,9/9/2012,"Woah! Anyone that likes this place is a complete and utter idiot. All offense. This place is like an Applebee's with lipstick. The managers looked overworked, and the servers are about as competent about their products as a doorknob is about fishing. WTH? I asked the server for the dryest wine they had. He didn't know, so he asked the bartender. They sent me the sweetest glass of pinot noir (pronounced pie-knot noh-eyer to them, I speculate). I ordered a tuscan chicken, and my wife ordered something? The food was great! If the food was lean cuisine, and I paid such prices. Never again. We were so blah that we didn't even go for cheese cake. It wasn't like we were mad or happy or in between, we were just...blah. I hate this place. Boring. Overated. Overpriced for the value. And complete and utter crap. Cheesecake factory can't even bring me back with a free meal. Want me to come back? Pay me!"
Bob E.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,10,2,1.0,12/29/2013,At restaurant now. Terrible service. 25min wait turned into 45min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  Hostess said 2 parties who arrived after us was seated by manager before us. Asked him why and he denied doing it. Food arrived sporadically after waiting 45 more mins after ordering. Husband s food got cold waiting on other two orders.  Reggie was a so so waiter. Only smiled when it was time to deliver the check
