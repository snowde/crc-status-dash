Morgan G.,"Duluth, GA",15,12,34,5.0,9/8/2014,"I went back here for a goodbye dinner with some friends and it was really great! Despite the long wait to get a table for six, everything was great! Our waiter, the food, and the employees were all so great.  I even left my phone on the table and the waiter had it waiting for me at the front desk when I frantically came back in to look for it. I would definitely suggest making a reservation to avoid the long wait especially for groups and especially on weekends."
Chad C.,"Northville, MI",5,32,4,1.0,3/7/2015,"Went for my wife's birthday.  Ordered an entree that came with mashed potatoes.  I asked if I could swap the potatoes for another side item.  Waitress told me no problem.  I asked for the meatballs on the side items menu.   They charged me $7.95 extra for the meatballs.  I asked to speak to the Manager Kerry Proust who was extremely patronizing and told me that meatballs were not a starch.  I informed her that although that is true, they are on the side items menu and I was informed by the waitress that I could swap for any side item. Bottom line, Kerry could have made the situation right, but instead she decided she was going to stick it to the customer.   Kerry, I hope that extra $7.95 was worth the bad yelp review and a lost customer."
Gregory D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,2.0,3/28/2016,Food is good but the place is not pet friendly even though they have tons of seating outside. Disappointing.
Edite M.,"Campinas, Brazil",21,1,,2.0,3/12/2016,"The receptionist was rude and impolite . I asked for a table for 12 people and I said that they would arrive at 12:30 only. I sat with my kids on the bench of the reception waiting to get 12:30. Near 12:30 she asked me about my friends saying that the table was ready and until that moment nobody showed what means ""no money"" for the restaurant. There were a lot of empty tables... I was sat in the bench because she did not tell me that the table was ready... During the lunch the  service was terrible. The food is the only thing good in this restaurant."
Juliet B.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,11,5,4.0,6/22/2016,"The service is usually a hit or miss. Sometimes we get a server who is AMAZING and just super friendly and cares about the experience. Other times we get someone who is neglectful and doesn't really bother to check the quality of the experience. I love their food though sooooo I kind of don't care lol Their food, in my opinion, has always been amazing. I never have been disappointed with anything I have ordered there."
Ground-Stander J.,"Cartersville, GA",1,105,43,5.0,9/25/2015,Cheesecake Factory is really good. Almost anything you get there will be tasty. The chicken salad sandwich is pretty weak though. I wont order it again. Good service. You really cant go wrong here. The salmon is really good. For Sunday brunch try the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. They are tasty!
Jessica A. S.,"Johns Creek, GA",14,50,1,4.0,9/1/2015,"I dined here for lunch with several coworkers. I enjoy their varied menu, yet almost always seem to order fish. Today, I had the grilled salmon with mashed red potatoes, broccoli and hibiscus lemonade to drink. It was absolutely delicious! The only improvement I might have made would be to increase the portion of broccoli. Service wise, they were maybe a bit slow, despite not appearing to be terribly busy. However, they took a reservation for lunch, which was extremely convenient for such a large group of people. Also, when they realized I was the only one at the table without my food, they quickly rectified the issue."
Karen T.,"Roswell, GA",14,40,6,1.0,1/2/2016,"We have always had great experiences at The Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall so we decided to try this location closer to home. Our first mistake was going on January first when it was crowded with shoppers. The wait was typical, about 30 minutes. Our waiter was not attentive, he was chatting wth a fellow waiter while all six of us had empty drinks. The food was good and fresh. My biggest complaint was the lack of light. Around 5:00 the lights were seriously dimmed to the point that we could not see our food. We were told that the lights could not be turned up as it was ""corporate policy"" to dim the lights for dinner. If you plan to have dinner there I recommend you wear a miner's hat so that you can see your food."
C R.,"Plymouth, MI",0,5,3,1.0,7/11/2015,Bang bang shrimp and chicken was a shadow of it's former self.  Syrupy sauce. 3 shrimp and a couple nibbles of chicken and veggies.  My dates catfish was both soggy and overdone??? How?   Taste like burnt grease.  Calamari was excellent as was the cheesecake.  But for the 80$ bill we Could have eaten a lot better.
Kmc D.,"Irving, TX",3,55,68,2.0,12/29/2014,"We have been here before and had decent food but today the story was different.this is the worst experience we had here.  We were there on Sunday evening at around 8.45 pm. It was busy but had few empty tables. We were promptly seated. Things started getting worse from   the time the server came, it was 10 minutes. She was apologetic for being late. Looks like she wasn't feeling good and she was about to leave but was told to wait another table.  Our food came out in time but we didn't had knives. Our waiter told us that they will be out of the dish washer soon. Huh...a big restaurant like CCF not having enough cutlery.  We ordered the spicy chicken pasta, a SW sandwich and salads. The pasta was dry and it didn't look like the way we had multiple times before. We told the waiter about it. She took it back and told us that she tasted it and it we weird tasting. We got it back after some time. Looked like they just added more vegetables and more sauce in the same dish. When one of the dishes was noted to have some oil marks, we pointed it to the server and before we can describe she grabbed it right out of her hands and got us a new one. We ordered a tiramisu cake for take out and when we came home and saw it  was packed haphazardly and it was nothing but crumbled cake pieces.   Food 4/10  Ambience 7/10  Service 5/10"
Jamie S.,"Sacramento, CA",152,84,24,3.0,10/14/2014,"Came here for their delucious homemade strawberry shortcake and they're out of it! Boo! So I opted for a passion fruit mojito instead. It was good but a llittle on the sweet side. The skinny mojito  tasted...well...strange.  It had what I can only describe as a weird lemon flavor. Mojitos should have a mild lime flavor - not a lemon flavor that  makes the tastebuds along the side of your tongue go ""kack!"". Maybe I'm a mojito snob but I couldn't even finish it. Apple crisp was all sizzle and no substance. Too much ice cream and whipped cream and not enough ""crisp"". The apple crisp was too sweet to balance out the ice cream. But, it did look pretty when served. That's something, righr?"
Cheryl H.,"Savannah, GA",32,163,4,5.0,1/7/2015,"After reading all the Yelp reviews about horrible service, I was really hesitant to go to the CCF but I had some gift cards that were burning a hole in my pocket.  Our trio went on a Sunday afternoon, with a less than 10 minute wait.  I was all ready for a terrible server but it was the nicest surprise to get a fantastic waitress - Serenity.  She was friendly, very efficient and really did her job.  My teenager is still raving about the Macaroni & Cheese Burger which he consumed in a flash.  The younger one and I both had pasta dishes that we couldn't finish.  I had the Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic.  Simply divine!  The little pieces of pancetta really puts this dish over the top.  The bread was delish, especially the olive oil & cheese dipping sauce.  We couldn't resist desserts but had to take them home for later.  Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake lived up to its name and the Tuxedo Cheesecake was perfect.   To those who had terrible service, you should go back & request Serenity.  She was great just like the meal!"
Greg H.,"Alpharetta, GA",26,40,18,2.0,9/13/2015,"First and last trip to a Cheesecake Factory, not a fan food was ok but not worth the price and on top of that the company lace was nearly empty for a Sunday afternoon and with so many servers standing around doing nothing but talking to each other the service was horrible."
Jason W.,"Suwanee, GA",66,104,62,5.0,4/13/2016,"A great place for lunch, dinner or cheesecakes. The tamales are my favorite thing on the menu!"
Cara H.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,18,,2.0,9/19/2016,2 stars ONLY because the cheesecake was good. SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE..... Stood there to be seated and it took forever even though workers were standing around and only a handful of customers in the entire place. Food took forever and appetizer was burnt and overcooked:( Our table sat there with dirty dishes for 20 min or longer. Worst service I have ever had!
Amber Y.,"Cumming, GA",90,6,1,2.0,3/20/2016,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, but the service and food have really gone downhill.  Our most recent visit was not a pleasant one.  We asked for a booth, there was no wait and several open, yet we were told we would have to wait 20 minutes, so we opted to sit at a bar top.  Our food took forever to arrive after we ordered, even though we were told it was on its way multiple times, and when it finally did arrive, half of it was cold and had to be remade.  The manager brought out the replacements without apology for the long wait, and when our bill came, there was no discount or any concession for the issues.  Poorly handled all the way around."
Annie L.,"Atlanta, GA",715,924,1252,5.0,12/19/2010,"Regardless of their super duper long list of choices, I always seem to crawl back to my original choice. The hibachi steak. Cooked raw...I mean rare. YUM YUM YUM.  The hibachi steak ($20) are tender pieces of steak tossed in a sweet/savory sauce with a side of buttery mashed potatoes. I could do without the mashed taters, as I don't enjoy mashed potatoes very much. But with the meal it just goes SO well. In the beginning they also give you a bread basket thats complimentary. I always ask for blue cheese dressing (my own dipping sauce for the bread, yay!) and tabasco sauce because I love hot sauce.  I ordered the pomegranate mojito as well. Not very strong, but not too sweet either (like your typical cocktail). I would probably order that again....OR order the mango smoothie and add my own rum to that (compliments of the mini bottles in my purse). I would go here every night, if the wait wasn't 30min-1hr every time."
Leah B.,"Moorestown, NJ",7,12,72,5.0,4/20/2016,"Excellent takeout service. They are always quick to process my order, efficient and courteous. I will go to this location for takeout service over the Perimeter Mall location any day."
Anya M.,"Cumming, GA",40,1,,1.0,8/3/2015,"One hour and thirty one minutes before we get seated and recieve service.  When we placed our name on the list we were told it would be 45 min wait.  One hour and 5 min into our wait hostess Elizabeth seats another table instead of us. When confronted she smiled annoyingly and said I will get you a manager.  Mathew Bauch (manager) instead of trying to apologize, he tried to justify why our table was given away to another party that came way after we did.  Two hours later we still didn't have our food.  Finally when food arrived, my husband had bloody chicken bone in his pasta!!!  His mother had a chunk of raw potato in his mashed potatoes.  Extermely disappointed in service and attention we received after what has happened."
Traci B.,"Warner Robins, GA",135,26,6,4.0,9/19/2014,"This was my first time eating in a Cheesecake Factory and it was a really lovely experience. We were there at around 1 on a Saturday and got seated right away. Service was quick and attentive, our server was charming and never left us waiting for anything. I loved the Chinese chicken salad, my mother had meatloaf which came with mashed potatoes and succotash, and my daughter had a fried mac and cheese burger and fries. Portions are HUGE, since we were going shopping afterwards we couldn't take leftovers so wasted a TON of food. We were too full from lunch to have dessert right after so we returned that night for cheesecake, which was of course delicious. Great experience!"
