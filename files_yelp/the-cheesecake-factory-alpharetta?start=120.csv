Pankaj B.,"New York, NY",0,1,,2.0,10/13/2014,Worst dining experience at any Cheesecake Factory!!! Just had an awful dining experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. First it took thirty minutes for our drink to come out. Then we had to experience three different servers in barely an hour of being there. 30 minute for my Mojito to come out. The avocado rolls had a terrible bitter aftertaste. And the bang bang shrimp and chicken dish had shrimps that had not been deveined. Twice we had to wait 8 minutes for the server to come to our table.  Only saving grace was that the manager finally came out (again after an 8 minute wait) and comp'ed our meal (which we did not eat anyways).  Hence the 2nd star.
Doug B.,"Alpharetta, GA",17,117,93,4.0,7/15/2012,"The place to go for birthdays without a doubt. Heard the wait staff sing happy birthday at four other tables before they did it at ours - for our youngest niece.  What a menu!  Changed my mind several times waiting to place the order.  Great cocktails and appetizers, too.  Try the deep fried macaroni - delightfully different but with good old Mac and cheese flavor. Want your food customized - just ask.  I ordered a pasta dish with extra garlic and red chili flakes - no problem.  Wait staff is courteous, funny and professional, something lots of other restaurants are short on. Save room for one of the many cheesecake offerings for desert - or simply get it to go.  The interior has almost a casino appearance to it - you almost expect to hear slot machine music binging and pinging. Though a little pricey, birthdays are just once a year so live it up!"
Heidi S.,"Chesapeake, VA",177,181,129,5.0,2/27/2014,"I eat here probably once every 3-4 weeks and can't believe I haven't written a review yet. The service is never less than completely attentive and warm. Be prepared to wait for a table Friday and Saturday nights (or any night really at peak times). Grab a bar table or seat if you can. You won't miss out on impeccable service. The food is stellar and portions are huge. Some of my favorites: Thai Lettuce Wraps, Ahi Carpaccio, Asian Chicken Salad, Pear & Endive Salad, Fresh Kale Salad, Ahi Tartare, Tuna Tataki Salad, Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Madiera, Teriyaki Chicken, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta,  Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Wasabi Crusted Tuna.. and pretty much any cheesecake.  Anything can be prepared to order as everything is made from scratch. Our server, Sean, had some great recommendations for my dining companion, who requested vegan accommodations. He definitely knew his stuff, which is saying a lot with such a vast menu! I never get less than 2 meals out of any entree.. especially if I save room for dessert.  Really love this place!"
Frankie P.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,13,7,3.0,6/24/2016,"We went for lunch and we ordered a few appetizers and entrees. We had the goat cheese and beet salad, falafel salad, ahi tartare, and fried veggie appetizer, among others. One of the salads had too much radicchio, so it was very bitter. Our ahi was grey and fishy. The tuna was old and had oxidized. The other dishes were fine. It was disappointing because the food is usually perfect."
Ryan L.,"Mableton, GA",0,1,,1.0,2/22/2015,"No servers available?!? We arrived 30 minutes after opening on Sunday for brunch.  The, not so friendly, host told us they did not have any available servers yet the restaurant was empty. Last time we ate here was the same situation. This is not a 1 time but a trend. Used to be our go to brunch spot around North Point, will not be back."
Scott R.,"Norcross, GA",21,5,1,1.0,8/23/2015,"From the dirty table & silverware....,to the excessive wait for the food..wasn't worth it .. Request for napkins unheeded..not what I remembered from days past.. I would be angrier but it was just too sad."
Jazen B.,"Suwanee, GA",11,41,33,4.0,3/25/2015,Met my baby here for another quick lunch and again all was good! Food was quick and delicious!
Yvonne D.,"Duluth, GA",21,3,,2.0,9/28/2015,OK   service was slow. We ordered spinach dip which took forever.  Think he forgot to put the order in to the kitchen  it was not hot when it arrived.
Jessica V.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,42,,1.0,10/23/2015,What happened to the Cheesecake Factory I used to know? Went here a couple of weeks ago and the service was so bad I literally thought we were being taped to see how much nonsense we would tolerate from a waiter. This is the last time for me. Too expensive to be so aggravated for a meal.
Melissa I.,"Duluth, GA",70,1,,1.0,7/29/2015,"Went to lunch with a group of co-workers for National Cheesecake day.. Two of the Guests at my table were very dissatisfied with food quality. Managers Compensated for inconvenience. Was charged for one too many cheesecakes at full price and way more than expected as the entire table was under the impression that cheesecakes were 1/2 price not 1/2 price per dine in customer limit one per customer and an entrée must be purchased. Was told they could unauthorized and re-authorize the transaction  which meant a double hit to my debit card until the first cancelled authorization fell off. When management was approved and the situation was explained I was apologized to, thanked, and assured training of the server would occur. No remuneration for my inconvenience was offered.  Was left overcharged and under satisfied. I have very bad taste in my mouth and will not revisit!"
Melinda A.,"London, United Kingdom",7,75,488,5.0,8/27/2012,The food was AMAZING!! Service was fast and friendly. The portions were HUGE!! We ate around midday and it's 9pm now and we are still full to bursting!! Lovely!!
Rahila A.,"Atlanta, GA",103,75,24,5.0,1/1/2014,"I have been to the cheesecake factory many, many, many times! I always hated it. Last night was different. I very much enjoyed it. Possibly because I knew what to order the fourth time around. Can't believe it took me for four tries to get it right. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Chicken and Shrimp pasta.  My friends waited to be seated for 45 minutes which In comparison to my past experiences at the Cheesecake factory in dunwoody and downtown, well that shit takes two hours and you just want to eat anything in sight at that point.  The wait for food was a little ridiculous, but since it was NYE I expected it. The plates came out super super hot. I tried a little portion of my friends Chipotle Pasta, and It was good but Its just alot of flavor. My friend has two pieces of chicken with a side of friends. Her chicken was really juicy and tender. I know, because I ate it.  The location at the north point mall is really good. It's def a thumbs up for me!"
Adam W.,"Talladega, AL",0,16,2,4.0,7/26/2014,Very nice experience. They stay open later and you still get good food and welcoming service
Rick T.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2015,The food is generally consistent but the service was insanely awful! Brianna was our waitress - took 20 mins for her to come by and bring water.  It took 40 mins to bring our food which was cold. We actually had to stop another waitress to ask to check on it.  Cheesecake took another 20 minutes and we had to stop her and ask her to get it because we saw the plate sitting there.  It was 1 pm when we were there and they were not busy.  Very disappointing.  Definitely rethink stopping at this location and pick another. Whatever you do if Brianna comes by get up and walk out!!
Renee K.,"Acworth, GA",204,162,47,5.0,10/1/2013,"I went to this place a couple of weeks ago with my in-laws. Between my husband, me and my in-laws, we have very different tastes, so the CCF seemed like a logical choice because of their diverse menu. We ordered lettuce wraps and shrimps for the appetizers, which were delicious. I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta and it did not disappoint. The servings were pretty big, so everyone has to-go boxes. We also ordered cheesecake to-go as well because we were too full to eat them at the restaurant. The service was great and the waiter was attentive. I had a couple Long Island Ice Teas and asked to server to bring us a ""Paula Deen amount of butter"" for the appetizer bread, but he laughed it off and brought me a small mountain of butter. The server had the whole table laughing. Definitely recommend this place if you have picky eaters in your group."
Bob K.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,18,,3.0,5/15/2014,You talk about problems in the kitchen....well...here ya go!  Go to the Alpharetta CCF and you will see!  Nothing comes out right and they know it.  The manager is no where to be found.   Sad to see a good place gone bad.
Krystn L.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,1,5.0,4/1/2015,"Just had a quick lunch, happy hour dishes hit the spot, came out quickly and my server Daniel H jammed. He anticipated my needs as a guest, what more can a girl ask for?! You rock Danny H!"
Randolph W.,"Roswell, GA",34,99,47,5.0,1/18/2015,"Great CCF location.  Servers are mostly very good - with a few subpar ones.  Lighting is very dark for some reason - can barely see the menu!  Manager needs to turn up the lights.  Food and cheesecake are excellent as usual.  Great place, will keep coming back."
Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1153,103,60,5.0,12/28/2014,"I know Cheesecake food quality and environment is pretty standard across the lands, s I have decided to forsake my normally structured reviews just to speak on the service we received here. I came here as part of a two family party. My relatives, being a mix of vegetarians, vegans, and who knows what are VERY hard to please when it comes to eating out. I would even go as far as saying some of the guests I came with are flat out anal. Our waitress, Susie (sp?) was extremely helpful and efficient in serving us. I don't think a single mistake was made, and she was very honest with the vegetarian folk about which entrees come with what meats. She even informed us that many of the items made ""vegetarian"" by removing meat come cooked in chicken broth. Thank you Susie and friends! I'll be sure to stop by again whenever I'm in Georgia."
Rene T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",486,58,151,3.0,7/18/2014,"I only give 3 stars due to issues I have had with the way the chain prepares  their gluten free pasta. If you have CELIAC DISEASE, do not eat the pasta; it's NOT GLUTEN FREE. The GF pasta is portioned out in the same area as other pastas & possibly the same water & strainer is used to cook GF pasta. I ordered GF pasta which is only the spiral noodle. My dish had wheat noodles mixed in! That is BAD! I was so scared I would get miserably sick the next day.  I talked to a manager about the process in which the noodles are sorted & cooked. THEY SHOULD JUST REMOVE PASTA FROM THE GF MENU THE WAY THAT THEY HANDLE & PREPARE IT.  As far as I know, if you have Celiac Disease or allergies, you must ask to order from a manager there.  The GF salads & chocolate cheesecake seems safe considering possibility of contamination. The Cobb salad is great & the cheesecake is awesome. Just be sure you ask how everything is prepared in the kitchen before ordering here!"
