Jeri C.,"Johns Creek, GA",0,8,3,5.0,4/23/2015,"My family and I were at the mall nearby the other day and it was coming close to mealtime. Instead of the food court we decided to come here...and it was the best decision I've made in a long time. The entrees were decent, I got some type of spaghetti, but the dessert was really the main attraction. It definitely tasted different from any store bought cheesecake; richer, and fresh. Would come here again."
Anja E.,"Canton, GA",0,4,,5.0,2/28/2016,"My husband and I have been to cheesecake factory many times and have always enjoyed the food. The service has always been great.  This time was no different:-)  I took my mom out for her birthday dinner and she LOVED the Shrimp scampi! I had the the tuna tataki salad and it was amazing as well!  The mango lime cheese cake was soooo good! The service was great! I am horrible at remembering names so sadly I am not able to give the server the recognition she deserves.  The server that had the little side room by the bar that waited on me and my mom on 2/28/16 in one of the booths. I made a somewhat strange and yes, I know, high maintenance request to make sure my coffee was extra hot( that's really the only way I can drink it, sorry). I even said she could microwave it. It took a while to get the coffee but when she came back she told me me how she had brewed a fresh one just for me!  It was perfect! Again, I wish I would have remembered her name! The entire experience was perfect, and if my mom is happy that makes me happy! Thanks for making our night memorable:-)"
Susan j.,"Kennesaw, GA",46,132,52,4.0,11/25/2014,My first time here. Ordered the skinny salad. My fate ordered chicken and biscuits. They were not very busy. Our food took over 25 minutes. Our waiter was okay. The hostess was awesome. I'm not impressed with the food. ( I'm not a cheesecake eater) but thought the salad would have been better. I'll probably go back because my family loves this place.
Radhika G.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,5,,3.0,2/21/2016,Cheesecake factory was good but I think their service needs to improve and become little bit better but my overall food experience was great and I enjoyed eating the food there!!!
Ben T.,"Roswell, GA",15,32,,1.0,1/1/2016,Normally I'm a fan of this franchise. Tonight was not a good experience. Indifferent servers. Mediocre food. Too dark to see the mediocre food. 3 hour ordeal.
Toad M.,"Alpharetta, GA",33,189,73,2.0,11/5/2014,"Well the hype is over with this chain or maybe just this one.  The plastic mugs are old and cloudy, even had a hole in it leaked all over the table.  The shrimp and angel hair pasta luke warm at best.  The hot latte was good and the Godiva chocolate cheese cake was very good.  This was disappointing because I always think of ccf as a staple go to anytime good restaurant..... not so much anymore."
Jacqueline W.,"Alpharetta, GA",75,74,84,4.0,9/15/2013,"Whenever we are eating with friends or family with a vast array of tastes, CCF is the place to go. Their menu selection is expansive, includes Asian, American, Mexican, and Italian cuisines. Portions are ginormous, you'll never leave hungry, especially if you order dessert as well. A few dishes we always enjoy: crab cakes, avocado egg rolls (appetizer), miso salmon, steak diane, Chinese chicken salad, and their filet minion.  What I hate about this restaurant is the wait time. God forbid you decide to eat there on a Friday or Saturday night. Expect your entire dinner experience to be a minimum of two hours."
Dawn B.,"Johns Creek, GA",0,25,10,4.0,3/19/2015,Hot date for lunch and we chose Cheesecake Factory. I ordered from their new Skinnilicious Menu which is a great addition since their regular entrees are ginormous! Lots of great options but I had the Margherita Flat Bread. Very tasty and service was fine even during the lunch rush. I like the variety of menu options and of course the decadent assortment of cheesecake. Just we sure to hit the gym after!
Colleen H.,"Birmingham, MI",65,184,17,4.0,1/20/2013,I am a huge fan of  this place.  Yes it is a chain but I don't have one near me so when I can get to TCF I do!  The salads are amazing but the cheesecake is obviously the signature dish.  This time I had the veggie burger and it gets two thumbs up.  The only reason it gets 4 not 5 stars from me is because there is always a huge wait to be seated and it is pricey for a chain restaurant.
Jana S.,"Smyrna, GA",170,243,7,3.0,7/29/2013,"I have been to this specific restaurant on numerous occasions.  People from my office tend to come here for people's birthdays or other special occasions. I've had mixed results with their ability of handling larger parties.  Let's just say that if you come here with a large party, insist on more than one server. Every time we've only had one server, there have been excessively long wait times and confusions. Cheesecake Factory's menu is a novel.  I really really dislike the size of their menu.  Why on earth would you ever want to have the option of 250 different meals?!?  If you ever research the calorie count on some of their menu items, it'll make your stomach turn.  Even items that seem to be ""healthy.""  1000 calories for their lettuce wraps...??? And that's an appetizer!! I'm very glad that they have started the Skinnylicious menu (all meals less than 590 calories) and due to its more manageable size, I've started ordering only from there. My favorites from the Skinnylicious menu: the soft tacos, chicken salad sandwich, salmon, and my newest favorite: the Tuscan chicken!! Cheesecake Factory holds true to their name... it is a factory! But their food is decent and service is always excellent.  Just beware of what you eat... your waistline will thank you!"
Kalikal R.,"Atlanta, GA",14,49,8,3.0,11/30/2014,The cheesecake factory is one of my favorite casual spots to grab a bite to eat. Usually on Fridays I place a take-out order. I usually get  their clam chowder. It's an amazing soup. It's always very creamy and full of potatoes and clams. I placed an order for a bowl at the perimeter location one weekend and I got two containers of the soup. It was explained to me that the soup is packaged in two separate containers for a bowl. So the following weekend I placed the same order and the Alpharetta location and received one container. There was no difference in the size or the amount given and the price was the exact same. I'm a little bit confused as to why one location will give two orders for the bowl and the other will not. I prefer consistency when placing orders or eating at restaurants. Hopefully thats something they can look into.
Jack G.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,76,2,4.0,11/23/2014,"Came here for dinner tonight and had a good experience. It was fairly crowded, but we only had to wait about five minutes for a table. Our waitress was great, the entrees were tasty, and the s'mores cheesecake was delicious."
Abhiraj A.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,1,,4.0,2/28/2015,Too much crowd...busiest but worth dining for...if your are foodie this is one the best restaurants around Alpharetta. be prepared to wait longer on weekends..average wait time is around 30 mins or more But the food and service is good.
John S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,24,2,3.0,12/5/2014,"The usual standby.  The norm is decent service, good food and excellent Margaritas. But  not so much tonight.  We sat at tables by the bar since one was available and there was a 20 min wait, no problem.  Ordered spinich dip and sheilas chicken salad.  Spinich dip was better than normal but  got something other than the salad.  They fixed it rigjt away but service was slow.  Had to wave down  waitress  3 times for different things.  Will still go back  maybe just  an off night  for her."
Natascha H.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,47,7,1.0,6/17/2015,"Absolutely horrible service. I love the Cheesecake Factory - the food is delicious, their portions are generous and they have so many options. But this particular location is awful. Today, I picked up takeout for dinner and dessert for my kids -  I got home 25 minutes (I live far) and although I had paid for the dessert - I had none in my bag! I called - was put on a 7 minute hold... hung up and called again... Was on hold for another 5 minutes - finally Matt picked up - and he kindly took the cheesecake my kids wanted off my receipt. That is it. No offer to come back and pick it up.. Get a credit... Nothing. Here is a refund and have a good day. I just drove 20 minutes out of way and didn't get what I paid for... Guess PF Changs or CPK will be getting the rest of our takeout nights... Because this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience with this North Point Cheesecake Factory."
Jean D.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,26,,4.0,2/8/2016,Love the skinny choice menu had the salad for 580 calories cheesecake slice tiny for the price
Mel W.,"Charleston, SC",26,153,223,5.0,7/5/2014,"I eat at this location every time I visit the Alpharetta Georgia Area. My food is always good. I find that most items are above average and very flavorful. Generally I order cheese cake ""To Go"" as a late evening treat to enjoy in the hotel room. I have tried several flavors and they are always VERY GOOD. The first bite of the Red Velvet Cake Cheese Cake was incredible. I was unable to finish the entire slice but I tried really hard. Yes, one slice of the cake was about $8.00 and some may find that to be expensive, maybe it is but when I begin to eat it money is always the last thing on my mind. Ok, so I wanted some more dessert before I left town and so a friend and I ordered the Lemoncello Cream Torte to share. This too was VERY GOOD. I probably gained weight on this trip because of my Cheese Cake Factory indulgence but I don't care It was worth every bite and besides I'll just have to work out a bit longer this week to burn it off. (Well worth the trade-off.)"
Paul G.,"London, Canada",43,3,1,5.0,1/3/2014,"This was our first time back here since we discovered that my GF is gluten sensitive. At first pass, she didn't see anything interesting on the gluten free menu, but Linda J quickly came to our rescue, and they turned a mushroom burger into an very tastey grilled chicken sandwitch, and it turned out to be one of the best meals she has had in a resteraunt! I got the Moroccan chicken, and OMG, it was sooo good! We were so happy, and Linda took very good care of us."
Kim S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,18,,1.0,11/4/2014,This place was horrible!! Terrible food! Terrible customer service! Went there for Sunday Brunch! Potatoes weren't cooked!!!! Yuk!! Chicken was over cooked!! Yuk!! Greasy! I will not be back! Our waitress we saw every 45 minutes! So therefore her tip was $0.01!!! I don't recommend this place!!!!
Theresa U.,"Canton, GA",14,119,79,4.0,8/19/2014,"We came for dinner and cheesecake. The wait was excellent. We put our name down for a party of six. We were seated within 15 minutes but told 20 to 30, I was good with this. We had a new waitress, she was fine. It seemed to take a little bit to get the drinks but not too bad. The food was GREAT. I ordered the fish and chips. It can get loud in this restaurant but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Overall good experience."
