Marcus O.,"Alpharetta, GA",439,496,388,3.0,4/5/2012,"generally i'm not a fan of the mega mart menu choices. however, it is fair to say that with 47,243 choices and at 983,326 permutations there is going to be something for everyone. that's not including the insert. add another 426 choices. most of their meals are average. some probably better than others. i had a veggie burger which looked like a clump of corned beef hash. pot stickers had an off taste about it but can't place what. the ahi carpaccio was pretty good. i ordered some asparagus to go with my veggie burger. warning: do not do this. it was overcooked, steamed, and tasteless."
Jana M.,"Alto, GA",1,3,,1.0,10/4/2014,Terrible service! Every person at our table did not get what they ordered. Don't go here!
Ralph I.,"Roswell, GA",4,20,11,1.0,8/20/2014,Food was ok. Not getting the chicken marsala again. Very bland.  But  when they lowered the lights I could no longer see my food.  So it did not matter. My light meter on my phone told me there was less than candle light.
Daniel E.,"Roswell, GA",19,18,8,5.0,5/27/2014,"Yesterday afternoon, My family and I just had gotten back into town from vacationing all weekend and needless to say we were hungry and did not feel like cooking.... We went to the cheesecake factory by northpoint mall since it was close by to our home. Janessa was our server. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken, my wife ordered jamaican black peppered chicken and shrimp, my little boys had corn dogs and fries and my oldest son had a burrito. The food was excellent but our server, Janessa, was outstanding. She provided EXCELLENT service to our whole family and was VERY attentive to all of her tables. Kudos. We will definitely be back."
Verna A.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,135,11,3.0,9/5/2012,"Gluttony - one of the Seven Deadly Sins...and one that you will more than likely commit if you choose to dine at The Cheesecake Factory. But hey, with a place called ""the cheesecake factory"" you're probably not too worried about what you'll consume. At lest, I'm not. When I go, I know i'm going to leave about 5 lbs heavier and probably be in a food coma for at least 2 hours. Yes, that's me. All because I have yet to learn the art of ""poriton control""  Anyway, this particular establishment, I've visited a few times. The staff is always very nice and attentive, food is honestly, just ""okay"" but I am a sucker for their cheesecakes. For food choices - I like the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, with mash potatoes. Be sure to ask for a box at the begining because it will last you at least 2 days, possibly even 3.  My favorite cheesecakes are white chocholate rasberry and pina colada. But really, every cheesecake I've had has been great.  Check out the small plates and apps menu, it's worth looking into, especailly during the weekdays when they have happy hour from 4-6pm."
Chris D.,"Norcross, GA",0,3,,2.0,6/13/2016,"Upon entering this restaurant with my girlfriend, we were very impressed by how the place looked. It was big, colorful and lively. The restaurant was not too busy during the time that we arrived (which was noon), so we were seated quickly. The host and hostess were both very nice and kept a smile on throughout our experience. When our server arrived (who I do not wish to identify), the server greeted us with a smile and a menu as well. However, as time persisted, the server became evidently inattentive and seemed unhappy. My girlfriend and I ordered two appetizers and an entree. The appetizers came out fine, but the entree was not how we ordered it. In addition, the entree was missing one of the item that was mentioned inside the menu. As we waited for a while, our server walked by us multiple times, but I guess was too busy to check up on us (something that I understand, being a server myself). So my girlfriend had to try to get the server's attention to notify about the entree. The server's solution was to get the entree fixe for us. Unfortunately, we were late for a movie so we ended up having to request the bill from the host. We were transferred to the manager, which led us back to our server. In the end, we were given the bill with the entree taken off, but with no apologies from any of the staff members throughout the conflict. Overall, I give this place two stars only for the initial impression and sadly left with the reminder to ""never judge a book by its cover."""
Xan T.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,117,,1.0,7/13/2015,"I went here expressly to get a cheese steak sandwich with a coke (I don't drink cokes so this was a special occasion). I have had this in Orlando. Great. The first bite was great. I was salivating for more. Then by the third bite it was clear that I would have dispose the fat and tough strings into my clean, white napkins. I spit out several chunks of indelible fat or tough meat."
Craig G.,"Roswell, GA",6,463,515,3.0,8/20/2012,"I don't remember the chairs being so uncomfortable at the others in this chain. My much smaller wife swapped with me and she also found them difficult. We'll definitely request a booth next time but she didn't want to bother after the first switch.  My Chicken Bellagio was delicious. I always worry about dishes with pesto as it can be overpowering, but they got the balance right, and the arugula was fresh.  The bread was good, and as always the portions were generous."
Michael R.,"Atlanta, GA",28,19,,4.0,6/20/2014,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills, San Francisco, and Las Vegas and I have always liked it. They have a great variety menu (the menu is big so it can take a while to go thru the entire menu so I recommend ordering an app so you can have something to snack on while you read over the menu) and great fresh food. My girlfriend had been to the one on OKC and did not like it but since I've always liked Cheesecake Factory I thought it would be good for her to to try a different one and see if I could change her mind. We went in at 5:15pm so it was not busy overall except for the bar area. There were people in there having a going away party. I went to the host stand and told them I needed a table for 2 people. After only 2 mins we were being taken to our table the problem was they took us to a table in the bar area. Since I was not there for drinks or to watch a game I really did not want to sit in the bar plus it was loud in this area so it makes it tough to have a conversation. I was taken back that the host did not ask if I would mind being seated in the bar like is done in most restaurants. I can understand if the dining room is packed but considering how empty the dining room was I really could not find a valid reason for me to be seated in the bar area or at the very least asked if I would mind being seated in the bar. Not a good way to start trying to change someone's opinion.  I was about to ask to be seated at a table not in the bar but as I was getting up our server came to the table so I decided to just go with it. As my normal I placed an order for edamame while we took our time to look over the menu. I love how they serve fresh hot edamame. I quickly saw the Mac and Cheese burger and decided I had to try it. My girlfriend order the skinny tacos. She looked at me like I was crazy to order a burger at the Cheesecake Factory and I asked her if she ever tried them and she said no and I told her to just wait and she will see why I ordered it. We placed our order and our very friendly server came back with bread. I love their fresh wheat bread and butter they give you. The only downside is if you go crazy on it you will get full and leave no room for dinner or desert but I feel that's why you get food boxed and take it home. Our food was served in about 20mins. My burger came out hot and the skinny tacos came out cold as they should. If you have never had the skinny tacos they are chicken and veggies wrapped in lettuce with 2 sauces severed on the side so you can put on as much as you want. Overall they were good but to me it was like eating a salad but since you eat it with your hands it is a little messy but it was a nice twist to a normal salad. My burger was awesome. I gave my girlfriend 1/4 of my burger and she was shocked how good it was. She quickly wanted more. This is the only downside of giving someone a bite...they will always want more so be careful..lol The same thing will also happen to your fries as well so don't be prepared. We enjoyed our dinner and then ordered a slice of Keylime Cheesecake. I selected this one since I did not want something overly sweet and a nice closer to our meal and I was not disappointed. It is a huge slice and big enough for 2-3 people to share and loved the fresh whipped cream. We both loved it. Overall it was a great experience. It was a 100% change from her last experience in OKC and she agreed she was now a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Our server was excellent and very attentive. We will both be back but next time I plan on letting the host know when I check in not to sit us at a table in the bar."
Jasen M.,"Atlanta, GA",94,101,26,4.0,1/30/2010,Ok  so normally i try not to review chain restaurants just because most people already know about them.  Just wanted to say that i had a great experience at this particular restaurant on multiple occasions. the service has always been very polite and attentive. Personally i feel the prices of some of their items are a bit up there. butttt thats not necessarily up to the restaurant or anyone who works there so cant hold that against them. also wanted to review it cuz i got some good pics of my food. :-)
Laura P.,"Maryville, TN",3,29,4,5.0,8/27/2012,What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory?  I have never been disappointed by one yet.  I just want to start out by saying I may not have left a review except that our server Chris M. was awesome.  I know I probably got on his nerves drinking green tea after green tea but he kept them coming!  Hey Cheesecake Factory maybe you could put the green tea in a bigger glass like the other teas?  Mom had the tropical tea and it was in a big glass.  Hello-same price! All of our food was quite spectacular and of course we took 2 cheesecakes with us but of course had to sample before we left the restaurant!  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm
E M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,,2.0,8/20/2015,"The food was not bad, but the service was terrible. I know the place held a lot of people but our server never checked up on us for at least 30~40mins before the food came out. We were just sitting there waiting for food not knowing if it was even going to come out. Server came once after the food came out after we called her. The sitting was terrible as well. It was as if we were sitting with the people next to us. Very uncomfortable for everyone. Person next to me had to ask to me to move a little to use the restroom. Poor service."
Jack L.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,4,,1.0,5/17/2014,Had an awful experience this evening.  Waited 45 minutes for food and once it arrived discovered my son's cheeseburger was as raw as steak tartare.  Took forever for a manager to approach our table to offer an apology.   Just completely unacceptable.
Sarah M.,"Athens, GA",0,1,,2.0,8/8/2014,Pretty disappointed for the second time in a row. Got a bone in my chicken salad sandwich. No offer of coupons or taking it off the bill but I didn't press the matter.
La Nise H.,"Alpharetta, GA",59,54,65,2.0,8/11/2013,"To me, CF has always been and will always be overrated. The menu is expansive but the dishes are just so-so and they charge a ridiculous amount for food. I had the pasta and could barely finish it all, but it was just so so. The only reason I would come here is for the cheesecake and the price you pay for one slice could get you a cake elsewhere. I think I will stick to local joints..."
Erika E.,"Smyrna, GA",43,181,6,3.0,2/11/2014,"A friend and I decided to meet up at this location for lunch a few Saturdays ago.  Although the place was packed, we were seated within ten minutes at the most.  Our server was awesome (I wish I remembered her name to give her a proper shoutout!) and our food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the club sandwich with fries and had a slice of the carrot cake cheesecake for dessert and it was all very delicious.  I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."
Lorraine E.,"Reno, NV",0,10,,5.0,6/29/2014,"I was just in Alpharetta on business a few days ago and we went to the Cheesecake Factory. Two of us are gluten free, so they gave us their gluten free menu....Amazing selection!!! I had the pasta that was cooked perfectly! My friend had the hamburger w/gluten free bun..it was terrific!!! And the gluten free Cheesecake...Amazing!!!!!  The staff was very friendly and the food very good. What more can you ask for? Love this place!!!"
Kacey C.,"Acworth, GA",2,3,,1.0,3/1/2016,"On Sunday, my husbands family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Alpharetta. I want you to know that the experience was less than par. We got there at 4 p.m. and had 11 ppl in our party. You would think that if the waiter needed help she would have asked for it, but she did not. It took her forever to get our drinks, bread, and especially dinner. They messed up my husbands order and gave his meal to someone else at our table and then the waitress didn't even tell us, but waited until I went to her and then she said the manager was coming over. 10 more minutes pass and I finally went and found the manager who asked if I knew the situation? I said no and told her this wasn't acceptable. The food was given to a member of our party so instead of just telling us, they made it such a huge secret and I had to end up sharing my food with my husband as his had to be made fresh. We were supposed to be out celebrating my sister in laws birthday and her pregnancy, but this long wait time and food mix up made it horrible. We all wished we had chosen somewhere else. And guess what, it took 3 hours for us to finish and I guarantee an hour or more was wasted on slow service and errors. In the end, we had a bad taste in our mouth and did not feel as though we got the proper experience. I  know you all will probably read this and delete, but I wanted you to know we were not happy."
Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,4.0,2/2/2012,we came back here for the first time in a long time at the end of January and it's still great. I got my usual Reeses Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake and the wife got the Tiramisu Cheesecake. Absolute heaven:)
Briana G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",2,5,3,4.0,10/22/2013,"Okay so for starters, this was me and my boyfriends first time here at this location and it was beautiful. It was a very quiet friendly atmosphere, the staff was SUPER friendly, and the place was very clean. Our server was Colleen and she was very friendly. She had awesome customer service skills. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and my boyfriend ordered the chicken belagio (sp?). We were there for lunch and I love to eat so I tried to order the regular portion but Colleen assured me that the lunch portion would be very filling. She was right !!! I ended up taking some home, the sauce, the mashed potatoes, the asparagus were all to die for. Then I tasted my boyfriends food and it was like PERFECTION in my mouth. I will probably get that next time, the only thing I recommend for next time is that the food come out hotter. The reason why I am not giving this rating a 5 is only for one reason. We ordered soup, tortilla soup as we are both fans of it and it just wasn't that great. It was honestly just about the worst tortilla soup I've had. It was very fresh, with fresh ingredients but just not a good taste."
