Jamie H.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,29,30,5.0,2/15/2014,One of my favorite places. Everything is so good and huge portion size. It is a little pricey but well worth the pay. All the employees and managers are friendly and makes for a good environment.
Jim L.,"Cleveland, GA",293,123,636,4.0,8/14/2012,"The J/J Burger Tour gets into the Cheesecake Factory(I know, right?!) for some fun. I've been here a few times since it opened in '04. I like this place and all of the CF's I've been to. They have good service and good looking interiors. Plus women like to eat and congregate here. No, wait, Never mind.....  Anyway...the burger. I got the Mac and Cheese Burger. They actually put friend mac and cheese...On. A. Burger. Oh, yeah! Actually my nephew suggested it to me after eating one at the Orlando location. It was cooked just right and they also put cheddar cheese sauce on it, too. Now...there ya go....  Mindy(knock it off, she's married.) ordered the Steak Diane and I got a bite and a forkful of mashed potatoes. This was a great dish. First time I've had Diane in a very long time.  Ok, cheesecake time; the feature of the day was Oreo Dream cheesecake. Just amazing. Just stoopid. Wow. Just stop reading and go see the picture. slapnuts."
Rangashrii S.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,3,,5.0,4/21/2015,I ordered the Eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. It was fantastic! I am not a pasta fan but this pesto pasta was phenomenal! Love it. Will definitely go back for more.
Lea C.,"Roswell, GA",23,118,198,3.0,8/23/2011,"We just moved to Alpharetta and stopped in to Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight.  Biggest disappointment was ordering a Filet Mignon (small) for $25, medium, and it was delivered ""well done"", no pink in the middle at all.  Very dry.  We did mention it to the waitress, but we were starving and weren't willing to wait for another steak to be cooked (our daughter already had her meal and this would have been a timing mess); so we told her we'd go ahead and eat, but to please mention it to the cook. I wasn't really expecting anything, but it would have been nice to have a manager or someone at least acknowledge that they'd correct this for next time.  The waitress didn't bring it up again, didn't apologize, just brought us our bill.  Probably won't be back, I do expect more when paying $75 for dinner."
Kevin Y.,"Flowery Branch, GA",207,456,963,5.0,11/18/2012,"I have to give 5 stars to THIS cheesecake factory after a fantastic evening and dinner last night. My date and I sat at the bar waiting for a table and had a beer and a nice glass of cabernet savignon... then went to get seated, wanted to wait for a booth so just went back and ate at the bar. Great atmoshere but have to give credit to our bartender FRANK- who was a pro, and a gentlemen!! Carrying a badge, I generally do not drink too much when out but after a great night of mixed appetizers- crab bites, mixed green salad, tuna tar tar... proceeded to drink a few glasses of wine, then a cordial, then spotting a martini down the bar and intruding on the guests- I had a martini. I was nearing my limit for sure!  Before I ordered it, Frank made sure I was able to order it and not get too hammered and made sure I a DD to take me out of there after ordering it. The martini was too much,as he suspected,  so he cut me off, gave me water and then called a cab to ensure we  got home safe. No, I don't think I fought him on this!!! My hats of to CCF for hiring the right people.. and further, having talent like Frank that made the evening that much better. I won't only be back again, but highly recommend CCF for the food- not just the cheesecake.... and I wanted to thank Frank for making sure I made it home safe!!! Above and beyond the norm and much appreciated..  If owners read these reviews, please remember  this one and know that you have a great staff and one happy customer!!! ( If I have his name wrong, he's the bald guy, my height... oh- vertically challenged.. 5'7 ish  and a pro bartender...) . Also, if I didn't tip him over 20%, it's only because I had too much to drink knowing that when you get service like this, 30-35% tip is par or I should have just given him a C note... :) Again, thanks!!!"
Ms. M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",3,62,1,5.0,6/5/2011,GREAT FOOD!  Long wait but its okay...just mingle
Rebecca L.,"Johns Creek, GA",22,38,,4.0,10/7/2013,"Ok so I change my opinion on CF. The skinnylicious is great! For the selection (the menu is a small novel), amount of food, and service it is great. Nothing outside the box but super consistant!"
Brandon W.,"Canton, GA",81,59,2,5.0,5/15/2013,"Prob. one of our fav. places to eat!! The selection is crazy and we have never had anything that we didn't LOVE! The steak diane and shrimp scampi is my fav! I would reccomend share an appitizer, a meal, and a slice of amazing cheesecake! Can't go wrong here....EVER!"
Mike K.,"Huntsville, AL",2,58,,1.0,6/14/2014,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory.  It sucks.  At least this one does.   We were in town for a family get together.  My daughter handled all the logistics and made it a point to call every hotel and restaurant to make sure they had no problems with a 15 person party.  The Cheesecake Factory management assured us that there would be no problem.  No reservations would be needed and we would be seated within a half hour.  Arrived at 5:35.  Informed that our wait would be 1 hour 20 minutes.  Wrong.  They were only off by 40 minutes.  Two hours to get seated.  We got drinks and placed our food order fairly quickly.  It was almost an hour before the food started arriving. I say ""started"" because it took them a half hour to serve everyone.  They initally brought 12 meals.  Ten minutes later two more people got theirs.  The last one to get her food was the youngest member of our party.  Three years old and all she wanted was her chicken strips.  How hard is it to prepare three chicken strips and fries?  Totally unacceptable.   My wife and I had the club sandwichs.  I think they got the bread from the day old store.  Her fries were too hot to eat and mine were ice cold.  Several others had quality issues with their meals.  The manager was completely uninterested.  I am going to do my best to not let this color my views of all Cheesecake factories.  Since there isn't a CCF in Huntsville we probably won't be visiting one again soon.     I've read the other reviews and see that this a recurring problem with this specific restaurant and it seems to be one of consistency.   Some people get great service.  A lot don't.  They should  be delivering the same, great service and food to each and every customer every single day.  I had to give it at least one star because Linda's fudge cake was so good."
Eleanor W.,"Nashville, TN",6,56,21,5.0,3/22/2013,Chopped salad and cheesecake! Great combo for taste and lessening the guilt! They have an anniversary cheesecake now (can't remember the name of it) that is to die for.
Amy G.,"Atlanta, GA",48,159,7,1.0,8/14/2012,"Let me just preface this odyssey by saying that I've been eating at this Cheesecake Factory since it opened in 2004. My family has been a long-standing fan of Cheesecake Factory and will continue to eat at them. Just not this location. Last Friday, I met my family here for a rather routine end-of-week dinner. The restaurant was very busy. We waited and were seated within about 30 minutes. Our waiter was quick to greet us, but seemed distracted by the large birthday party in the middle of the room from the start. Ok. Fine. Par for the course. We ordered wines and waters. He brought the wines, then the bread. No waters. We had to ask twice more before we got them.  While we were waiting for our waters, we carried on with some conversation when all of the sudden BAM! and SPLAT! A nearby food runner dropped a small saucer full of mustard. It must have hit the floor at just the right angle and at just the right distance from our booth to splatter our table and surroundings perfectly. My jeans. My shirt. My purse. Mustard was everywhere. In my wine, on the flatware, on my face, on the wall of our booth. I didn't see exactly what happened, but it made a gigantic mess. Ok so back up to the scene where the guy drops the mustard. (We'll cover the mess later.) I understand that accidents happen. I've worked in the food service industry. But when you do something like that, you STOP what you're doing, locate materials to help clean up, and contact a manager -- or at the very least, the server. This young man did the opposite. He merely picked up the saucer, wiped up the mess that he saw in his tunnel vision, and started to walk away. Mortified by the mustard I was covered in, I sprang out of the booth and rushed to the bathroom to attempt to remove it from my clothing. When I got back, my mother said that she attempted to stop the young man to get his help cleaning up the mess, but he simply handed her napkins and walked away. Wow. Eventually, I got up and walked over to a manager to explain the situation and make SOMEBODY aware. By the time I got back, another manager was over out table apologizing and helping clean up. He got me another wine and offered to pay for dry cleaning to get the mustard out of my clothes. (ha!) But all good and great. Once he was aware, he was on top of it. Though, aside from apologizing the only other thing they ""took care of"" was the wine that had mustard spilled in it. That didn't exactly give us the feeling of being taken care of. Nor did it make a very good impression on us. The issue at heart is not that it happened. It's the way it was handled. This young man did not receive proper training. His on-boarding did not show him how to handle a mess nor how to manage a crisis. He didn't have the native know-how to stop and say ""hey - other people must have been affected by this."" So to know that you're dining in a restaurant with $20-45 plates where the staff hasn't been properly trained/just has poor hiring standards is a bit disconcerting.  I do plan on getting my clothing dry cleaned. And if the mustard doesn't come out, I do plan on being compensated for the value of those clothes. I also plan on not returning to this location again."
Blake M.,"Chickasha, OK",31,1,,1.0,8/2/2015,"I don't ever Yelp but my poor experience here compelled me too. Was told a 45 min wait for a table of 9 and after 1hr 15 min wait they give the only large enough table to a party behind us that arrived much later. Hostess gave us a sarcastic ""sorry"". Manager Matt was argumentative instead of apologetic. Food then came and the grilled chicken in my pasta consisted of a large chicken bone with no chicken (just cartilage) and the rest was mainly grilled skin.  Any meat was dark blood spotted meat. I couldn't look at it much less eat it. My mothers Shepards Pie mashed potatoes was primarily one large hard chunk of a non-mashed potato. Matt apologized for the chicken bone, but said the potato was within the realm of density that sometimes gets served. Um, ok, then don't call them mashed. Oh yeah my spoon looked like they put the last one back from the previous customer who clearly had something chocolate. Food was very poorly done. The waitress was nice though. We all ordered deserts and when the bill came, not a single free dessert or comp for all the troubles.  This NorthPoint Cheesecake location has to be the most poorly managed restaurant I've ever been too. Such a shame because we have always had a good experience at other Cheesecake Factories."
Steven C.,"Suwanee, GA",155,33,1,5.0,8/15/2013,Oh my gosh! Beat restaurant I've ever been too! The food is absolutely amazing and the cheese cakes are to die for!!!
Nina S.,"Atlanta, GA",6,69,16,2.0,6/8/2013,They short  the main  items in main dishes... Way over priced
April P.,"Mills River, NC",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2014,"This place is terrible, the pasta and salad had no taste at all, the pizza was awful, service was extremely poor and the tables were so close together that you had no privacy at all.extremely noisey and definitely not worth the long waits that they have. After all this we didn't even want to stay for cheesecake.a complete waste of money."
Jerrell A.,"Alpharetta, GA",350,7,,4.0,5/9/2013,"This was one of many times that I have been to Cheesecake Factory, and I finally decided to write a review. The atmosphere and lighting is really nice and mellow. The staff is always  welcoming and courteous. I ordered the Rib-Eye steak. It was tender and juicy, although it was a little flavorless. Over all it's a great inexpensive place to go for lunch or dinner. The only drawback to Cheesecake Factory is that it can get really noisy at times."
Von B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,11,2,3.0,9/14/2013,Nice place. No wait. Friendly staff. The food was good. Burgers were missing items. Chk your food.
Laura M.,"Alpharetta, GA",34,55,,3.0,6/5/2012,"I know a lot of people scoff when you say that The Cheesecake Factory has good food but I just let them laugh. This is actually our go-to place for my husband's birthday because he loves their cheesecake so darn much. The food is actually quite good and if you can't find something to eat with their gigantic menu, well, there is no pleasing you. I love how you can have a healthy meal with their Skinnylicious (stupid name but good eats), small plates and salads or you can just strap on the food tray with their heavier meals. My favorite dishes are the Summer spring rolls (fresh, crisp and filling), mushroom lettuce wraps (hearty if a bit salty), and the Fresh Vegetable Salad. The kids meals come with fruit and there are plenty of healthy options which is a nice change from the usual kids menu. The portion sizes are gigantic so if you care for your health at all, ask for a doggie bag as soon as you get your food because you just can't finish it all.  Ok, I know you are saying ""But, this is the Cheesecake Factory, talk about the cheesecake!"" Well, I am one of the few people in America who cannot stand cheesecake so I'll give you my husband's take: ""It is eye-rolling good."" The man loves his dessert and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake is the stuff of his dreams. He branched out this year with the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream and enjoyed it but I think Vanilla Bean wins out. For people like me who gag at the thought of cheesecake, there are plenty of other great dessert options- bowl of fruit, ice cream and my favorite: Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. Their desserts are giant so you'll be able to share with 7 or 8 of your closest friends.  Don't worry about being seen in a chain, just go in and enjoy the food."
Sweet P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,43,1,4.0,9/10/2013,"After my horrible experience at TGIF (read my TGIF review), we left there and went to Cheesecake on North Point.  I've been here plenty times before and have always been satisfied with the food.  I will say that if you go during lunch peak hours 12-1pm, you will most likely have to wait on a table, and the service tends to decline more b/c the servers have a lot of tables.  The servers are very friendly but it takes them a while to come back to your table to see if you need anything.  Most times you will most likely spend more than an hour there.  During non peak hours, the service is great.  The food is delicious, but the prices aren't.  Prices are a bit much for lunch service.  Even their skinnylicious menu is a bit pricy.  Nevertheless, this was a better option especially after my TGIF fiasco."
Ali F.,"Atlanta, GA",123,219,602,4.0,11/14/2010,One of my favorite chains to eat. The cheesecake is GREAT! Can't be mad at cheesecake factory ohh the HOOOOT wheat bread niiiiceeeee!
