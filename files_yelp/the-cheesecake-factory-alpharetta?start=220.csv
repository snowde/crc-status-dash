Melissa B.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,5,,4.0,1/25/2012,"love menu variety esp. Thai lettuce wrap.  huge portion, fresh lettuce. frozen iced mango is the best."
Art M.,"Ellijay, GA",11,77,,4.0,2/21/2011,"I've never had a bad meal here.  Of course their normal meal should allow you to bring lunch home for tomorrow, cause you HAVE to have dessert here.  If you don't.....why even come?"
Mariana P.,"Marietta, GA",1,3,,2.0,7/3/2011,"Food fine but NOT good for kids, especially if you have a toddler. It took a ridiculously long amount of time to get our food - nobody had a good time."
Thomas W.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2013,This Cheesecake Factory location should just serve cheesecake. The chicken marsala kept me preoccupied in the bathroom leaving my lady enjoying her lunch alone. Thank you Cheesecake Factory.
Liz T.,"Atlanta, GA",1,156,83,4.0,3/16/2012,"Haven't been back to a Cheesecake Factory in a while, but the Birthday Girl in our group decided that's where she wanted to go.  They didn't take reservations for less than 7 people, so we went right before the peak lunch hour and were seated right away in a great sunny spot.  Our friendly waiter told us that they had just switched out a dozen or so items on the menu ... since it was such an extensive menu, I'm not sure it mattered to us.   Our vegetarian friend was on a fried avocado streak after tasting some at On The Border, so we ordered their avocado spring roll to appease him and our hungry tummies while perusing the menu.  I've never had fried avocado and will have to admit that it was really, really good here especially with a drizzle of the tamarind sauce; but terribly fat too right? I had the kale salad (one of their smaller portions which turned out to be perfect size!) with their special of the day wild mushroom soup (delicious!!) - i'm now determined to make a kale salad on my own!  The birthday girl ordered a flatbread and when she wondered out loud why they didn't have a chicken option, the waiter offered to customize it for her - great service! .. turned out to be really great too.  One of the guys ordered their mexican or southwest chicken salad; it was the Cheesecake Factory supersized portion but sadly, the chicken compared to the mounds of lettuce was quite miserly.  In fact, when it first arrived, I had to help dig for the meat.  Birthday girl said she remembered the same experience on her last visit.  There were enough real vegetarian choices, i.e. not just rabbit salad food to satisfy our friend and he had a veggie burger which seemed awfully large and came with a good serving of fries.  He said it was good. We ordered two kinds of cheesecake for dessert to share - the Tuxedo and the Banana Cream.  Both were very good and the waiter was spot on with recommendation of the Tuxedo - it was his favorite, and I might be a convert now after tasting it! It was a great re-acquaintance with the Cheesecake Factory."
Michelle E.,"Marietta, GA",0,6,2,3.0,2/21/2012,Good. But I'm a kid. I ordered the mini sliders and they gave me a appetizer of 4 sliders with onions. I hate onions. But then they gave me the right food. 3 STARS!
Annie H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,36,,4.0,3/2/2011,"I so want to give this place 5 stars, except the service was slow. Waiter said he was going t o bring us rolls, which he never did. We actually had to ask for a dessert menu. They never offered to refill our coffee & really would have hated to see how long that would have taken. My cucumber martini was supposed to have orange & lime in it, which it didn't. Kind of just a purred cucumber with alcohol in it. I don't recommend it. Now for the good part! The food is overall very good. I've had the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls a couple times & they are wonderful. Nice & light & the sauces are very tasty. My companion had crab cakes which were also wonderful. The tartar  sauce, though, was basically mayo, not real tartar sauce. For dessert she had cheesecake which she said was wonderful. I had Apple Crisp, which was basically baked apples swimming in sauce & 2 gigantic scoops of melting ice cream. My only complaint about the food is the tremendous portions. We both had appetizers which was really a lunch portion. I cannot image eating all that & then ordering lunch! My dessert was enough for 3 people. I brought it home & it took me 2 extra days to finish it."
Bayo O.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,3,,4.0,11/3/2010,"My wife and I like to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Alpharetta. The atmosphere is great and we enjoy eating on the patio on warm days. We do a lot of take outs too. We like the menu because its extensive, we have not had something that we didn't like before and the service is good. We like the Luau salad which is like a Polynesian salad - looks and tastes very nice. The Evelyn's pasta is great (we get them to add chicken to it) and so is the Jambalaya. The strawberry milkshake is good for sharing. They now have sweet potato fries. We had chicken strips with sweet potato fries the other day. From the cheesecake menu, the Tiramisu cheesecake is great. All in all, there is a lot to choose from."
J D.,"Marietta, GA",3,105,1,3.0,4/29/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory was the restaurant of choice for the newly minted 9-year old, so off we went, happy that it wasn't Olive Garden or Sweet Tomatoes.  I hadn't been here in awhile, but nothing had changed.  Gigantic menu, (so big there are ads on every page) equally enormous pieces of cheesecake, and big mall size portions.  I have one piece of advice if you find yourself at a Cheesecake Factory-get the Kobe Beef burger.  It's tremendously tasty.   I don't care if it isn't really Kobe beef (how can it be for $13?) it is a great, great burger.  The fries are bleh, so get a mixed greens salad instead (very much not bleh) and go away happy.    Everything else was respectably average.   So overall, no hate on Cheesecake Factory, and much love to the Kobe Beef burger.  When's my next kids birthday again?  Oh yeah, I'm supposed to know that."
Trey S.,"Columbus, GA",1,5,,4.0,12/2/2012,I like it. Food is pretty good. Definitely a little over priced and the waitress was no expert in customer service but I would eat there again. 4 stars
Nateia F.,"Atlanta, GA",98,230,79,4.0,6/10/2009,"Came to this spot, just for cheesecake one night....YUMMY!  Crazy Craigs Carrot Cake Cheesecake, an Oreo Cheesecake, and a Keylime Pie Cheesecake.  And no...only the first one was mine!  LOL"
Brittany L.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,3,,1.0,12/23/2013,"I used to LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. I would find any reason I could just to go. I was even proposed to at this restaurant! I always thought the food was delicious and the portions were big enough to save some for another meal. Well last week was the last time I will ever come to this restaurant. The service was terrible. I've had that in the past, one time, but this was bad. The lady didn't seem like she knew how to talk to people at all. She was very awkward and never said Thank you or asked if we needed anything. Very strange. I ordered an alcoholic drink to start off my meal...that had NO alcohol whatsoever in it. I only drink about once a month, so one drink will give me a good buzz. This drink had ZERO alcohol. I was disappointed, but excited to get my main dish, one I ALWAYS order, the Luau salad. I always ordered it because the portion is so huge I eat some, and save it for another meal and for $14, it's well worth getting two meals out of it. The plate arrived at the table and it was ridiculous. The big won-ton squares filled up the entire plate. There was barely any salad. It was less than half what I used to receive in previous visits, ordering the same exact plate. My child got a $9 grilled cheese with fruit on the side. About 4 pieces of cut up fruit. THAT'S IT! Ridiculous!!! I ate the entire salad and wasn't even full. Then I get my bill and see I was charged $10 for a drink that was missing alcohol! My salad was the same $14 price. I was and still am extremely disappointed that I spent my money there. I wish I would've never gone and saved the money for Christmas gifts. I will never go to this restaurant again and I will tell everyone I know. I don't know what happened here, but they are just trying to steal your money."
B W.,"Atlanta, GA",6,130,27,4.0,8/13/2010,"Came here when it first opened 80 years ago ( not literally 80 but it was quite some time ago) its a C.F. so not too much to say if youve been to one youve been to all. came with my family, its a newer set up, not like the older ones, but its a chain rest. so it is what it is."
K B.,"Johns Creek, GA",0,12,,1.0,4/24/2011,"I took my family to celebrate a birthday on April 23, 2011.  Although previous visits have been satisfactory (hence our return), I was completerly disappointed this last time....enough so to take out the time to write a review.  I ordered the shrimp scampi with steak diane platter for dinner at $19.99.  When the waitress brought my dish, there were THREE tiny beef medallions mixed with mushrooms and THREE pieces of medium sized shrimp, in the center was approximately one cup of broccoli.  Being a previous restaurant owner and knowing food costs, this could not have cost them more than $3 to prepare (that may even be a generous estimation).   Two of my kids got the 4 cheese pasta dish @ 13.95 which I felt was overpriced as well in accordance with the amount served.  My wife got the mahi mahi special which consisted of no more than 4 oz of fish, was also 19.95 and had about one and 1/2 cups of vegetables to fill in the plate. My son is the only one who got his money's worth....a 10.95 spicy buffalo chicken sandwich with fries...and he could not even finish all of the fries.  My wife and I left hungry, and we paid $115 including tip for this meal.  I absolutely do not mind spending generously on a meal, and I realize that times are tough, but there was certainly no proper exchange here.  Normal food costs for a restaurant hover around 32%...I felt that the portions we paid for at the Cheesecake Factory averaged no more than 10%.  What gives here CF??????  :-("
