Jon P.,"Buford, GA",92,129,200,5.0,5/13/2016,You can never go wrong with the cheesecake factory. I love their lunch menu and the service was always good. I especially love their portion size. I pretty much end up taking food home. Dessert I rarely try just because I'm so full by the end of my meal but I remember the cheesecake is to die for.
Charlie B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,32,,2.0,3/17/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. There was no wait and not a big crowd. The service was absolutely terrible. We waited a long time for our drink order to be taken then another long wait for our iced tea to be served. During the wait we saw our waiter standing across the room ""shooting the breeze"" with another employee. We finally got our ok meal then couldn't find our waiter to get the check. No refills ever offered for our tea. Bad value for a meal."
Bo B.,"Newnan, GA",0,2,,4.0,6/27/2017,"This is very good. We had an excellent and very polite server. I got the factory burger On sourdough and it was excellent. Friends got crab bites that were amazing. Fried mac and cheese was great. Oreo cheesecake was utterly great. I'm giving it four because of something a friend orders. They ordered the chicken salad sandwich, with the ceaser salad and the fruit cup. Salad was flat, fruit was sour as All get out, and the chicken salad was so-so. Overall, had a great experience just with one slight miscue."
Joshua J.,"Atlanta, GA",96,8,,2.0,6/20/2017,I have gone to this location about 3 times because we love this restaurant in FL. Unfortunately the service has been poor every time here . The waiter did not give us any silverware and I had to ask for refills on drinks each time . The food is not that great also . The Cheese cake was good though. I wanted to give it a last try because maybe I just had a couple bad experienced but this shows that we will not come back to this location .
Robie C.,"French Quarter, Charleston, SC",19,2,,5.0,9/28/2017,"Atmosphere was amazing! Service amazing!! My husband had the ribeye, green beans, and substituted for sweet potato fries. Perfectly cooked medium and so tender!! Flavor was amazing! I had the Tuscan Chicken which our server, Jackie recommended and it was delicious and a new favorite!! Jackie is a must for your server! She was friendly and provided excellent service!! Never disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory!!"
Shug A.,"Duluth, GA",5,50,37,3.0,8/14/2016,"I ordered crispy fish tacos ...they were ridiculously bland. Then I ordered avocado egg rolls they're aight but why in the world does an appetizer cost as much as an entree. My mom got meatloaf,mashed potatoes, & corn something. She enjoyed her food but she's not picky. The fried macaroni is really good. The portions are huge. Only reason I wanted to come cause Drake loves to go here lol."
Jolly K.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,,1.0,5/30/2017,"If you want to eat vomit on top of cold rice, this place is for you.   Bartender was slinging good drinks but never asks about quality of food.   If I was the owner, I would fire THE ENTIRE KITCHEN STAFF! You're better off eating at McDonald's. At least when you get diarrhea it will only cost you $5 instead of $70."
Denise A.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,39,18,2.0,11/23/2016,"HORRIBLE - the service was terrible. First, a couple after us was seated before us, by mistake. They didn't call our name and just grabbed the 2 standing closest to the hostess bar. Then, we were seated by the bar and the waitress didn't come to our table for 9 minutes. By the time she did come over, she took about 15 minutes to get drinks, and take our order. We got the fried zucchini appetizer. The appetizer arrived 23 minutes later and it was soggy. Instead of the breading being crispy and crunchy, because it's supposed to be fried, it was soggy and the inner zucchini was hard, like it was under cooked. I thought I could get over this BUT then, the cheesecake came and boy oh boy I was just in awe of the appearance... I mean, I don't know how the waitress could serve that be content with the product she was selling me. I am very dissatisfied."
Jt P.,"Cumming, GA",5,2,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Poor/absent service and sub-par food. My friends and I sat at a high table in the bar section. We were not greeted for over 10 minutes. I had to inform the hostesses, and then 4 people came to our table to tell us that our server would come to us soon. Mind you none of those people offered to get us drinks or anything. 5 minutes later... Our server shows up and takes our drink orders (water and 2 alcoholic beverages). It took 10 minutes to get just the waters and then 5 more for the other beverages.  I know what you're saying, ""It's a busy Friday night."" Ha ha This place was almost empty. Most of the servers were doing side work and up at the front cashing out at 10:00pm (obviously not a busy night). We ordered two appetizers, and they took approximately 35 minutes to arrive. Our flatbread was cold and dry, and was returned. Also our bread basket was full of old, hard bread. There was not attempt to correct or improve our visit. Overall, a disappointing visit to this Cheesecake Factory location.  We will not return."
Murph K.,"Fair Oaks, GA",0,10,,1.0,6/16/2016,"The overall ratings and reviews of this restaurant say it all. The manager here, Jeff Wendt, is the absolute worst hospitality professional my wife and I have ever encountered.  And this really bites because we used to LOVE this Cheescake Factory North Point restaurant.  We've had many family dinners - the ENTIRE FAMILY, both sides and in-laws - and birthday and graduation dinners here. And more regular dinners and Sunday brunches than I can remember.  Food is usually pretty great. And the desserts are unmatched.  But it has gone way downhill here in service. And it was made quite apparent to us Memorial Day weekend that Mr. Wendt shares no compassion for a ruined take-out order that customers must RETURN in person in order to prove TCF staff made the mistake.  Then after confiscating the receipt we were made to wait - in an almost 'move along we'll get to it when we're good and ready - nearly three weeks for a refund from the botched take-out. So like the many other complaints in this review thread, our family won't be returning to this TCF any time soon, unfortunately.  And we'll continue to get the word out about how we were blatantly and arrogantly treated to our Next Door app and neighborhood digital newsletter networks consisting of thousands of Windward and south Forsyth homeowners and residents.  This review just scratches the surface for what's to come."
Anasuya D.,"Cumming, GA",0,3,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Horrible service, this is the 10th time i am eating in cheesecake factory. They just ruined my anniversary celebration. Didnt give us the complementary bread to start with. Had to wait for ages for the pineapple mogito. We had to ask twice for my son's apple juice which comes with the kid's meal. The service was horrible. We felt so unwanted. Guyz beware of this place"
Erin C.,"Atlanta, GA",10,99,34,2.0,7/20/2016,"Went here with friends on a Saturday night and encountered an hour-long wait.  I know, it was the weekend.  I may have been unreasonable with my expectation, but I fail to see what is special about this place.  The menu is fairly big, but the prices and quality of food is no better than any other diner or restaurant in the area.  Our waitress was very professional and I was happy to see that they have some ""healthy"" options on the menu including a veggie burger.  This was a relief because I had to veto plans to go to the North Point diner due to lack of veg-friendly options.  I also was impressed at the selection of ""skinny' cocktails.  You know how Mexican restaurants now have one margarita that has the sugar-free mixer?  Well, Cheesecake Factory offers skinny manhattans, cosmopolitans, and more. I am also impressed that this place is open until Midnight, but unless every other joint is closed, you won't catch me back there, again."
Tan P.,"Duluth, GA",82,106,359,4.0,9/16/2015,Nice location. The sitting area outside is nice. I typically go for salads or cheesecake & I have been pleased with both. Sunday brunch can get crowded so be there early. You can access this location from Northpoint Mall.
Rebecca E.,"Atlanta, GA",115,106,496,2.0,10/30/2016,"UPDATED 3/9/2016 Used the DoorDash app to order some food. When my food arrived at my door, an item was missing. I called this location to see if it was sitting at the togo area so my driver could go back for it. I received the WORST customer service instead. The woman's name was Sheryl and she insisted that I contact DoorDash and inform them of the issue. She refused to just check (or have someone in the restaurant) check the Togo area. It was easier for her to just argue and be stubborn instead of giving me proper customer service and checking on my order. I just spent $60 on a few items. I could have gone somewhere else. After her annoying persistence on contacting DoorDash, i told my driver don't worry about it and I then called Cheesecake Factory back to speak with a manager. Kelly answered the phone and let Me know she ""understands why Sheryl didn't check the togo area because it all the way across the restaurant"". Really? Because I can't be transferred via phone to that area? You don't employ multiple employees that can walk over and check?  This entire scenario is NOT the way to keep clients visiting your establishment or ordering from an online app. From my experience below and now this one, any positive experience has now been deleted from my memory. NEVER AGAIN. I should have reread my previous review before ordering... PREVIOUS REVIEW THAT HAD 4 STARS: Came here for lunch last week and it was kind of busy but it was pretty outside so we sat on the patio. We were greeted by our server and we'll, that was it. 30 mins in we finally grabbed someone else inquiring about the teas we ordered (never mind our food at that point!)...he dropped off one tea for us to share. I waited about what I thought was ten more minutes and went to the hostess station asking for a manager. He walked back to where my table was and then said he would check on everything.  OUR FOOD WAS NEVER ORDERED. We were ready to leave but the manager urged us to stay and that he was buying our meal and just put the order in. At that point I didn't even care about the free food, where the heck was our server for almost an hour??? Don't tell me she got distracted by another table for an hour.  The only reason we stayed was because the weather was nice and the manager was pretty insistent about not leaving.  Can't say we will be back. It's not worth the risk of having piss poor service again. The only reason the 3 stars are there is because of the managers sense of urgency to fix the situation and our food was really good. We ordered the Cuban rolls, fried Mac n cheese, and the omelet with cheese, ham and avocado."
Byron B.,"St James, MN",9,23,17,4.0,2/7/2017,Food and service were good. Was there for the Super Bowl and staff was really distracted. But it was fun.  Left before the Falcons lost.
Dan K.,"Snellville, GA",128,35,232,3.0,7/20/2015,"I had received a gift card to Cheesecake factory for my birthday, so I decided to give this location a try. The wait was about average which was a pleasant surprise considering Cheesecake Factory lines are usually horrendous. As I sat down, I was taken in by its ambiance and its decor. It had been 7 years since I last visited any Cheesecake Factory location, and I was able to appreciate the surrounding better. The service was pleasant as most employees of Cheesecake Factory are courteous and professional. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken while my girlfriend got the BBQ burger. The food was above average though my chicken felt a bit soggy. We got the classic cheesecake with strawberry topping afterwards which really added to our overall delight of the experience. This place really lives up to the name of Cheesecake Factory. I have not yet to taste better cheese cakes. After everything, the cost came out to be over $40. Even with the gift card, the price is a little too much considering its above average entrees.  Overall, I give Cheesecake factory a 3.5 out of 5.  Good service. Above average food. Excellent cheesecake. Steep prices."
LA M.,"Atlanta, GA",3,4,,1.0,7/26/2017,The WORST Cheesecake Factory! I normally love cheesecake factory and eat there often. Today I waited 35 minutes for a sandwich to-go. Two other parties ordered to-go items and picked them up while I waited. I paid $22 and still did not receive my full order.  There was no apology and refund and I finally left with a partial order despite having paid in full plus a tip. SKIP this place.
Toni G.,"Roswell, GA",61,195,75,2.0,12/8/2015,"Wow..this place used to be the place to eat..wtf happened? Went with another family, 6 total in our party. Service was fantastic..those guys can hustle like no other...but the food. What a major disappointment.  Kids ordered a 16.95  dinner portion of pasta... not worth it. Friend ordered Philly cheese steak. .thing looked like a gas station sandwich with 6 onion rings. Hamburger was burnt to hell..no Ecoli there! Chinese chicken salad looked like the kitchen sink leftovers were thrown on the plate. Just overall sucked. .thank god we were in good company.  This made the food go down better. Didn't even bother with the cheesecake."
Jen L.,"Atlanta, GA",208,326,620,5.0,10/21/2014,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory almost all my life! This was my first time at this particular location! The service was fantastic. They also refilled our drinks constantly without asking. The Iced Mint Green Tea is always fantastic! I love a number of entrees that I get repetitively such as the ones listed below: Chicken Marsala Chicken Lettuce Wraps Chicken Madeira Chicken Piccata Grilled Salmon Believe it or not, I'm not the biggest Cheesecake lover in the world but I have tried the Chocolate Cookie Dough Peanut Butter Cheesecake which was quite yummy! The food here is surprisingly good! This is a great place to go on a date or have special occasion celebration dinner. The food, drinks, desserts, service etc. is just superb!"
Madelyn A.,"Alpharetta, GA",1052,2236,10079,2.0,7/3/2015,"ONE AND DONE! I really don't understand the appeal of this restaurant.  People often talk about it as if it is really great.  So one day I give in and decide to try it out with a friend for lunch.  Usually under similar circumstances when I encounter a menu that I just don't like, I will just get water and call it a day.  However, my friend was so excited, (it's her favorite), that I decided to give it a try.  I ordered a simple pasta dish and I had them place the sauce on the side.  Now, when you deconstruct a dish, each component should be able to stand on it's own.  The pasta was bland, the sauce was bland and I had to actually have the bland waitress come by with the fresh cheese in order to try and add some essence to the dish.  It didn't work.   This is that stereotypical restaurant that is more hype than substance and tends to cater to a very suburban palate, (largely individuals who don't have the time or desire to cook and have forgotten how good home made, well-seasoned food should taste).  It is definitely over-priced when you consider the poor quality of the food.  I don't know about you, but bland is not my friend!"
