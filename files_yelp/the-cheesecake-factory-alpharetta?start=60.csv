Cassandra K.,"Lilburn, GA",16,1,,1.0,10/31/2016,"I ordered fish tacos and got veggie tacos with a few chunks of fish on top...not cool. I was disappointed sent it back and it took another long wait. So I ordered a salad to go and left. It wasn't crowded and I've never had a problem at that location before. Not going back to eat, will just get cheesecake to go."
Mike C.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,37,,2.0,11/5/2016,"This has to be the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. There were tons of tables that were not clean, the bar area was disgusting with glasses and plates everywhere. The service was very slow and not friendly. Not to mention our order was wrong and there were avocado peels in the salad."
Boo N.,"Woodstock, GA",2,14,3,5.0,2/19/2017,"Went to the cheesecake factory last night for a double date and the food was amazing.  We all like very different things but there was something for everyone.  Out server was so nice and very friendly.  He kept giving us bread and checking on us.  The food was so so good.  I got the Buffalo blasts and the portion was huge.  It is listed as an appetizer but it is more then enough to eat as a meal.  My boyfriend had the steak and scampi, and it was the best scampi sauce I have ever had in my life.  It all came to the table extremely hot and well prepared.  Yes it's a little pricey but the taste and portions make it well worth it.  It was amazing food and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a nice night out and eat super yummy food!"
Buffy S.,"Atlanta, GA",44,256,34,1.0,9/5/2016,"Went here with my mom this weekend and the whole experience was crap start to finish. First the scampi was bland bland bland. Covered it in salt and pepper to attempt to get some flavor out of it and still nothing. My mom's fish was dry and rubbery as well. Not only was the food not up to par but the service was just as atrocious. We had a young man who didn't check on us once, brings me a pen with no ink, doesn't apologize for the food just takes it away and sends a nasty manager with an attitude. Anyway, and in addition to all that when the ""manager"" comes over she doesn't smile once and is basically in fight mode. How about as a manager try to be a bit more pleasant and helpful!! And being charged for anything at all was unacceptable. Wasn't even offered dessert. I was all too happy to get out of there to be honest."
Kat R.,"Dacula, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2017,"I decided to join friends for a bite to eat at this location, I've only been to CCF one other time a few years ago but did not remember the experience. I decided to go light with the crab cake bites. They tasted nothing like a crab cake, it barely had any actually crab meat and was stuffed with a gummy and tasteless filler. I order a frozen peach alcoholic drink from the menu, which had no alcohol and was a whopping $11.50. Let's just say I won't ever return to this chain of restaurants again. Super disappointed and a waste of money."
Guy Y.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,48,25,1.0,3/25/2016,One of the worst ever service I got  The food is good but it's not worth the customer experience . Wont spend a penny again at this place.
Melissa M.,"Roswell, GA",144,5,,4.0,1/9/2017,"I mean yeah its good but it's so expensive and I personally don't see what's so amazing about it . the cheesecake is nice but I could get similar ones for a more affordable price. I do love the way the restaurant looks, its pretty cool"
Kim H.,"Atlanta, GA",3,9,9,4.0,6/4/2016,"The service was good to my shock and surprise. The food was great, Calamari, Nachos & Avacodo Egg Rolls. Waiters took there time bringing condiments but ober all the food was tasty. Visit for happy hour for the $5 apps."
Sara S.,"Fenton, MI",406,526,2019,3.0,1/7/2016,"If my review was based solely on cheesecake, this would be a five-star review, hands down. If there's one thing that the Cheesecake Factory is noted for, it's their stellar cheesecakes- from variety to taste, it's all sublime. For me, though, that's where the praise ends. Granted, if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've pretty much been to all of them, right? That's true most of the time and this one is no real exception apart from the rather slow service. I don't get it, I know it's busy most of the time, but some of the wait times are just absurd. Every single time I'm back in Georgia, my sister drags me here because it's her favorite restaurant in the world (yes, I said it's her favorite in the entire world- she even dines here to celebrate her wedding anniversary every year). Every time, I know that my meal will be a long one in coming and I've yet to be proven wrong. Waiting a full hour for a pizza is wee bit much, but maybe I'm just being a crybaby or something. On top of that, sometimes the staff forgets to buss tables in a timely manner and tables are filled with dirty dishes for way too long while people languish by the door waiting to be seated. However, once you get your food (regular menu items, not the cheesecake, which is beyond reproach), it's pretty hit or miss. I've had both decent and not so amazing pizza and my tried and true greek salad has always been good, with crisp vegetables and delicious dressing, but the stuffed mushrooms were very meh, completely underwhelming and not at all what I was expecting. Honestly, I didn't care for either the texture or taste of them at all. Another time, I ordered a house salad that arrived with a bit of wilted greens with brown spots on it, so I sent it back and received a much-improved dish after an astonishingly brief wait (surprise, surprise).  Now for the cheesecake - the salted caramel is absolutely scrumptious with just the right balance of sweet and savory to make it the perfect dessert, but I'm still a sucker for the traditional plain variety, too. Both the Godiva and Oreo cheesecakes are so good, rich in both texture and taste. Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes really are heavenly and I've never found fault with any of their desserts (not at any Cheesecake Factory location, either) and doubt that I ever will. Too bad the service is as slow as it is."
Zahed K.,"Norcross, GA",4,20,,1.0,4/29/2017,"Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in years, I always enjoyed it in the past. Came in with a party of 6 and was extremely disappointed. The server did not seem to want to be there and did not write anything down when we ordered. Not surprisingly, we never got our appetizers. When we got our food delivered by one of the runners, we told them we did not want the appetizers since the food already came. She replied ""That is between you and your server."" When we finally saw our server again (end of meal), we told her we didn't get our appetizers. She replied, ""Are you sure you don't want it?"" People generally order appetizers for the beginning of their meal, not the end. Two people ordered wine and the person delivering it held two glasses with one hand and stopped at our table and stared at us waiting for us to take it from his hand. When we wanted the check, our server was nowhere to be found. I found a manager and asked for the check, explained our experience, and she just replied with a ""Sorry."". Not sure why they have the calorie count on all their items, because it has to be one of the unhealthiest food you can eat. Food was average, but at the high prices they charge, the service is unacceptable."
Alex S.,"Alpharetta, GA",68,88,79,4.0,12/11/2014,"Went here for my birthday and as always the food was spectacular! Had the chicken madreia that came with mash potatoes,asparagus,mushrooms. Tasted great and chicken quality was tender,fresh! The rest of my party enjoy their dishes immensely.. They brought a nice hot fudge Sunday and sang happy birthday to me.. Even tho I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but with CCF I can always count on a good experience with solid quality food!  FYI-The floors seem a bit slippery this nite so be careful walking around"
A C.,"Atlanta, GA",27,104,36,1.0,12/19/2015,This place is stingy on its food. Got the $15 salmon salad and it was 1 1/2 times the size of my salads. Manager doesn't give a shit.  Never again.
Leslie T.,"Atlanta, GA",69,91,37,4.0,4/1/2015,"Best place for cheesecake in Atlanta.  Between the dulce de leche and the caramel dutch apple, I just can't seem to get enough!  You also can't go wrong with the godiva brownie sundae.  Best. Chocolate. Overload. Ever. Portions sizes are immense....even the lunch salad feeds me for two meals. Can't complain about that!!"
Priscilla L.,"Charleston, SC",2,33,21,3.0,10/9/2016,"The food here is so good but the service is terrible. One time we went and one of their waiters left early so no one else came to our table and we had to go up to the counter and tell them that no one had helped us. In other words, they forgot about us. The manager did apologize and give us free dessert though. Also, we went just to get some cheesecake last night and we had to wait 20min just for them to get us 3 slices of cheesecake. They need a better routine."
Jim T.,"Coraopolis, PA",12,13,2,1.0,10/4/2016,"I have never had bad food or service from any of the Cheesecake Factories I have dined at, but the Northpoint location is not up to their companies standards. This was the 3rd and last time I will eat there. The food is either cold, burned or tasteless. I travel for a living and dine out frequently so I do know service and food quality, and you do not get that here. I have never been visited by a manager here for any complaint, causing me to think they don't care....fatal mistake in this industry. I will continue to visit other CCF's, just not this one"
Jennifer F.,"Lodi, NJ",2,5,1,1.0,9/10/2016,"The review is not for Cheesecake Factory food which is usually up to passable standards. This location gets one star for letting my husband and I sit and read menus which 3 other couples (just sat) around us were served water and bread. We finished reading the menus and sat. And sat. Waiters were milling around us serving other customers as we quietly got up, walked out, and took our hard-earned money elsewhere."
Ms. E.,"Norcross, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/1/2016,"I will not visit this location again. I frequented Cheesecake Factory, ordering their turkey burger. My last few visits the turkey burgers were pink (uncooked thoroughly). I ordered a turkey burger on Monday and asked them to make sure it was cooked thoroughly, stating the last time I visited it was not. I received my order to not only find it was pink on the inside but also the paper that separated the patties was cooked inside of my turkey burger. I called and voiced my concern to the manager. They are obviously not paying attention to the preparation of their meals or inspecting them once they are ready to be served. I received my refund and will go to another establishment that does not put me at risk for salmonella and ecoli poisoning."
Alyson R.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,1.0,8/28/2017,"Terrible service at the Bar.  Got there on Saturday at a little after 3 pm and NO ONE was seated at the bar besides myself.  No staff was behind the bar either.  A few minutes later, a bartender came over, said hello, and took my order.  Very simple - a club soda and a hot appetizer.  He entered the order immediately, and took care of a couple who just sat down.  For the next twenty minutes, he carried on a full conversation with the couple, who got their food, while I was still waiting on mine.  No one even cared that I was sitting there for 20 minutes with no appetizer - I had to ASK him to please check on my food.  A couple of minutes later, the app came out and it was tepid - not even lukewarm.  Obviously no one let him know the order was up, or if he knew, he just let it sit there getting cold.  I told him the food was cold, and a manager came by to apologize and said he would reenter the order, and it would be ""on him"".  I waited another 20 minutes, and no food.  One other customer came to the bar and ordered (and got) his food and drink.  Still no appetizer.  I finally walked out.  There was not even a bartender at the bar for several minutes for me to ask to check this time.  He was off doing other things,  I guess.  You'd think the bartender or manager would be extra mindful of a customer who just had a bad experience, to constantly check on my food and bring it out to me immediately after it was ready, and then make sure I was happy?  Not so.  Took 40 minutes with no appetizer.  This is unacceptable.  I have been to the Perimeter location hundreds of times and the bar is packed with customers ordering complicated drinks, customized entrees, desserts, etc., and the staff are always delightful and attentive, and the food always comes out hot and exactly as ordered.  The staff pay attention to all the customers, not just the ones they wish to chat to. The North Point location can't even handle 3 people at the bar at the same time when the place was so slow? This is not the first time I've experienced deplorable service and long waits at this location, but it is the last time I will ever visit.  I will drive to the Perimeter location next time I'm in the mood for CF, even though it is farther from my home."
Latoyia Z.,"Atlanta, GA",18,79,13,4.0,2/7/2016,"The picture speaks for itself. I ordered the macaroni balls as an app, bbq salad as an entree, and cheesecake. Everything was fresh and delicious! The only downside was our server forgot to put in my son's order and we had to flag her down for things."
Miro V.,"Alpharetta, GA",206,7,1,1.0,10/29/2015,"The service was subpar, we only got refills after food was dropped. Two of the parties dishes came out couple minutes before the other 3. THERE WAS GLASS IN MY GIRLFRIENDS FOOD. She still has a small hole in her tongue from it. The manager  seemed nice and comped her meal and cheesecake , but that should never have happened. The atmosphere is great ,I enjoyed my burger,but I can't review higher than 1 after the glass in her pasta. This was on her birthday."
