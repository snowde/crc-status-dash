Carol M.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,13,5,2.0,6/22/2016,"Food is good. It is the Cheesecake Factory. At North Point location, you will never know if they are going to cook your dish properly or if they are going to mess up your food. Customer since 2006 I always have to think 3 or 4 times before coming here. So, today for instance I decided to try my luck, my husband ordered a Tuscan Chicken and I ordered Pasta DaVinci. My pasta came without any sauce on it. When I mentioned that to the server, the server said she could bring more sauce. Well, after the pasta was cold, she brought a sweet & sour thing that I still have no idea what it was. Speaking to the manager she was nice and calm but it does not make up for the fact that my husband end up his meal and I don't even have mine. That is why you should stay home or come here at your own risk."
Judi H.,"Roswell, GA",87,3,1,1.0,7/10/2015,"Dumbest, most offensive move ever!  Got our check before our food was served!!! 9:30 on a Friday night --- not too busy, and yet we waited at the table for a good 3 minutes - no apology. No excuses.  Then a different server drops the check and talks about the PanAm games like we are friends"
Kimberley O.,"Woodstock, GA",82,15,6,1.0,10/8/2016,"I am so surprised at the disaster this restaurant was tonight. The host stand was completely mismanaged. All employees were gathered around not making eye contact with any guests (when we approached to be listed as well as when our buzzer went off) The wrong food was brought to our table three times. I would not suggest this restaurant especially if you rarely go out and are looking to celebrate. However, our dessert was great and our sever was sweet and attentive."
Barry K.,"Painted Post, NY",135,228,280,4.0,1/12/2015,We were at the mall and decided to eat here instead of the food court. Since it is connected to the mall. The  place was very crowded so I excepted to wait awhile but it only ended up being 10 minutes.  The staff was friendly and helpful my sister had a baby and they took her stroller for her and brought her a chair for the baby.  Our waitress very helpful and I asked if I should get the Chicken Marsala or the Shepard Pie. She said go with the pie.  I was surprised but I went with it.  It didn't disappoint at all!  It was a big size portion and was full of flavor I can't believe how good this was. I know you are thinking its the Cheesecake factory for comfort food?????  I can't wait to go back and order it again!!
Kristie D.,"Alpharetta, GA",91,324,65,3.0,8/12/2014,"Why is it always so friggin cold in this place?  We literally eat as quickly as we can so we can get the heck out. Service is not really a selling point for them as the servers oftentimes seem to be pretty unhappy to be there and can be quite slow.   Food is consistently good, it would be nice if they had a full brunch on Saturday but I'm sure corporate controls that.  I was adventurous this visit and tried the spring rolls off the Skinnylicous menu and they were surprisingly good.  Something crazy like 350 calories but they tasted like real food. I just really don't like coming here because of the cold, its just too uncomfortable and only strawberry pancakes make it better.  But you can only get those on Sundays!!!"
Christopher B.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,29,,1.0,11/24/2015,"If this was the last place with food, I guess it make sense sense to go. If it is not, I would pass. Here is our story: Stopped in for a light dinner and sat in the bar area. We were give a menu and the waited to be served for over 15 minutes. Finally, I got up, walked over to the three waitresses and asked if we were sitting in the wrong area.  We finally were able to order our  drinks. Some of the drinks were brought, but one was forgotten.  After 10 more minutes, we had to ask if we were getting the drink. ""Oh, I forgot"".  When the waitress finally came over to ask about food, we placed an order. A friend had to order three separate times as each item he ordered he was told ""we were out of that"".  The tables were full of old food that no one was busing. It truly felt like we were sitting in a dive bar.  If I owned this location I would be complexity embarrassed. I understand that things happen.  But this was laziness amongst the entire staff and the mangers."
Donna Y.,"Atlanta, GA",21,33,2,2.0,7/29/2016,"Went here for an anniversary dinner-bad choice. Friday night, 50 minute wait. We got there at 8pm. It was 9:40 before we were served any food. We may as well been invisible. They seemed understaffed. The bathrooms were filthy (men and women's). The floors were wet everywhere not just the bathrooms. We did complain and they comped our entrees. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the food/cheesecake is pretty good once we got it. Just does not compare to other Cheesecake Factory dining experiences."
Nichole D.,"Manhattan, NY",81,14,1,1.0,5/1/2016,"Worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. Food was cold, salad wasn't dressed, fries came out by the time my brother had finished his meal. Even further, my sister's meal was missing avocado. When we asked to speak to the manager I could not have asked for a worse response from management. The manager was rude and took no responsibility for her restaurant's actions."
Angela L.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,7,,1.0,10/27/2016,"Used to love this place in the past, however, the last 2 times have been the utmost worst experience (with the exception of our server, Braxton, last night). We witnessed a couple at the next table have they're order messed up over and over again, in addition to having to wait half an hour for it! They eventually walked out- which should've been a red flag for us- bc believe it or not, it happened to us too. Will never be coming back here again, and I wouldn't recommended it to anyone else either."
Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",529,1116,3663,4.0,8/24/2013,"The food was divine, but not so much the price. lol. I just love their drink and menu selections. There were too many choices to choose from.  I tried the Mai Tai there, and boy was it strong. I know I am a girl, but even my guy friend (an alcohol lover) said my drink was pretty strong. He won't ever say a Mai Tai is a girly drink now. :)  My friends and I shared the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. It was good but nothing too special. There were only 6 pieces, and it cost $11. Yup. Yup. I ordered the pretzel-ed chicken skewers (unsure of exact name) on the appetizer/small dish menu, and it was pretty tasty. A unique texture to say the least. We ended up splitting a chocolate tuxedo cheesecake (perhaps my friend made the name up). It was chocolaty and delicious.  The waiter at our table was attentive and very friendly. I wouldn't say he was the most knowledgeable when it came to the drinks or some of the food recommendations, but a good enough waiter. He was nice enough to corral a few other waiters to come and sing to my friend as it was his birthday.  Overall, a good place for a first timer."
Andy B.,"Windermere, FL",63,278,103,4.0,7/31/2015,"Came in to try the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake (on half price cheesecake day which was a great bonus!) The cheesecake was caramel-y for sure - but just not enough salt/balance for me.  It kind of is like a triple Dulce de Leche cheesecake (which is one of my favorites) - caramel on caramel on caramel. I added some salt to the top of the cheesecake, but that didn't change the flavor - perhaps them adding some crushed salted pretzels to the top of the slice before they serve it might help? We shared an order of bang bang chicken & shrimp with the cheesecake and that was as good as ever - huge portion, very easy to both get a good meal when sharing. So... Salted Caramel has not displaced the Lemon Meringue cheesecake as my absolute favorite currently (or Dulce de Leche as my second favorite)."
B M.,"Johns Creek, GA",3,39,55,4.0,12/18/2015,"The wait is always worth it, great service and selection of any type of food. Got the pork chop it was awesome, dessert pumpkin& pecan cheese cake (one of the best desserts I have ever had).smash potatoes are great too."
Macy T.,"Birmingham, AL",15,163,430,4.0,10/5/2015,"Extensive menu, you can get basically anything you could ever want. The menu is really like a novel. They have delicious bread they bring out to start, but this place can be extremely crowded. Good news is they have curbside togo and you can walk right in and grab a slice of cheesecake or dessert without much waiting. The cheesecake slices are close to $8 a piece though."
Geeta S.,"Alpharetta, GA",3,4,,5.0,8/14/2016,"This place was quality personified.We had Avocado egg roll and Garlic bread roll for appetizer and Pasta for dinner .Avocado egg roll was delicious. For drinks, had ordered Passion fruit margarita ,which was out of the world. Pasta was good too..All in all had a great time .From Food to service to presentation everything was bang on."
Kim M.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,,1.0,1/29/2017,"Sad, server took our order and then completely forgot about us.  Had to get our own water, when another waitress we flagged down for tea,  the tea arrived smelling and tasting like coffee.  The manager tried to make up for our horrible service by comping our drinks and appetizers but we still paid nearly $80 for cold food.  This place has really gone downhill."
Barbie S.,"Alpharetta, GA",119,91,7,2.0,3/5/2016,"Well. The two stars are for the fact that they have great cheesecake.  However 2 out of the 3 visits we have had have been less than stellar.  On both of those visits we had the same server - people. He is not good at his job. Aloof would be a good word to describe him. But what really made me write a review & decide to not go back is their food quality. One visit I had hair in my food. They replaced the meal (to go style) and I still had to pay for it.  I get it, I did ask for a replacement but to not take it off the check?  Then, this last visit there was a little mini baby twig in my food. Where the twig came from? Good question. I feel bad for my husband. He loves their kobe burger. I just don't think I can risk random (and gross) things in my food again."
Mew W.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",42,149,417,4.0,7/30/2015,Always good and always filling! They know how to do consistency. And it was Natl cheesecake day - slices half off.
Nikia C.,"Atlanta, GA",164,87,133,4.0,3/31/2015,"I came here a few weeks ago after work with some friends for dinner and drinks. It had been a while since I'd been to the Cheesecake Factory and I was interested to see if the menu was still the same.      When we arrived, there was a 10 minute or so wait, which was less time than what I thought that it would be, being that we didn't have any reservations and it was a Friday night. Once seated, we were greeted by Apple, our waitress. She was nice and chatty, and made sure we were taken care off. She brought us a bread basket to share after taking our drink orders. I've heard that the brown bread is called whole wheat baguette and the lighter bread is sourdough. The whole wheat baguette is always good, but the sourdough bread?? Hard. As. A. Rock. I'll never eat it again.     The menu can be a little daunting, especially when the restaurant boasts that they have over 250 items made on a daily basis, and after going back and forth with what I wanted to order, I finally settled on a red sangria with the breaded Buffalo chicken strips, the alternative to their original Buffalo wings, because I didn't have the biggest appetite.They were covered in hot sauce and served with ranch dressing on the side and celery sticks. I'm not one to normally eat hot things, but the strips were pretty good. The red sangria was ok. I'll try the white one next time.   Overall, the food was good and so was the service. I'll be back."
Mike M.,"Lithia Springs, GA",0,3,,3.0,1/14/2017,Been waiting awhile very crowded don't understand why they are not seating outside such agreat day. Also would relieve alot of waiting. Maybe the management is not paying attention to the front hope the wait is worth it.
Tom E.,"Alpharetta, GA",1371,1179,3374,4.0,5/9/2012,"I haven't been here for a long time, but my family and I came back the other night to celebrate my mom's birthday, and you know what, I am glad we made it! We came around 6:30 Monday evening, and the place was at about 50% capacity (which was nice, but not too hectic= better service).  It was my mom, both my sisters, my nephews (3), and myself.  We got one of those long booths- seemed to fit alright (with the 2 y/o at the head of the table, ha).   The menu had changed a little, but still overwhelming.  You could literally eat here for a month 3 times a day and order something different every meal- it is one of those kind of menus! My family kept trying to enable my alcoholism so I started off with a Long Island.  I haven't had one of those since I was like 19 (ok, I am kidding, but it has been a while!), and damn it had a bite!  I downed it and stuck to Stella (on tap!) for the remainder of the night. Our server was Yolanda (I hope that is spelled correctly, if not, my apologies!), and she was good looking, and took care of us in every manner- near flawless service for 3 kids and 4 adults. My dumb ass ate a huge meal not too long before, so I stuck with a Santa Fe Salad, and let me tell you, that was one of the bigger salads I have had in my life (compares to a Buca Di Bepo family salad!)- and damn was it good!  The flavors came together well, something I will admit- I didn't expect that!  It left me full, and I could not eat the last few bites... The dessert menu here is top notch- but I was so full, we all ended up declining- probably one of the bigger mistakes in my life- as dessert here is an experience in its own. This place is great since it does have the options; anyone who cannot find something to eat here should be jailed.  I highly suggest coming here after a nice meal if you want a knockout dessert- I mean this place competes with places like Cafe Intermezzo and Alon's- a bold statement, but I would like to stick with it.  Don't forget they handle parties well here too!"
