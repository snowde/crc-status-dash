Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1668,147,857,5.0,1/6/2018,"Went here for my mother in laws birthday with a group of twenty two on a Saturday night. We had them split the bill into five different checks. They were able to sit us right away with a reservation. I've never been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory (besides the cheesecake itself) but this experience changed my perspective. To start, besides the quick seating which I already stated, the service was outstanding. They were on top of everything we asked for. The drinks were constantly filled, the food came out promptly and they did it all with friendly service. We had a small group come in a little late and the got them up to speed very quickly with drinks and food. The menu is so big with such a variety it's super hard to decide what to eat. I decided to go with the orange chicken. You can order full or half size and it comes with steamed rice and vegetables. I ordered the full size plate and it was absolutely delicious with enough chicken to feed two. I didn't hear any complaints no matter what anyone ordered at the table.  We topped the night off with, of course , the cheesecake. My favorite is the key lime but they have plenty of flavors to choose from. Definitely recommend if your visiting Anaheim and Disneyland!"
Zsanette Z.,"Hemet, CA",1,25,29,3.0,12/27/2017,"Mesmerized by the tall ceilings and large open dining area, you'll be swept in.  You'll pass the large glass cheesecake display, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, and I'm sure you'll notice the, above top shelf, bar.  However, the glitz and glam will fade once seated at the table that is covered in crumbs, with spotty silverware. Your seat will have bits of food left there after falling from the table that was given a half-ass wipe down. The waitress will have arrived promptly. If you go, ask for Karina. She's attentive, polite, and friendly.  The food was average. Presentation was well.  Drinks were served in dirty glasses. The cheesecake, of course, saved this dining experience.  Friend ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It had a strong vanilla flavor with a smooth finish. I ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was a sweet and tangy explosion, with a coconut base.  All in all, I would dine here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to feast at this location.  TIP: Ask the waitress/waiter to validate your parking."
David W.,"Tustin, CA",1,28,32,1.0,12/24/2017,"Thank you for my lump of ice! So it's my birthday I'm sick as a dog and have been stuck in bed all day, all our plans have been canceled and its an all around crappy Christmas eve. Such is life right? My wife wanting me to eat something and trying to cheer me up drove all the way to Anaheim cheese cake factory paid 12 dollars for valet parking and got me a strawberry cheese cake. She patiently waited almost 30 minutes for the cake. It took her over an hour to get home. Wakes me up to have some cake. I was very thankful knowing how far she went out of the way to get it. So she goes to cut it... solid as a rock, it is fresh out of the freezer. WTF who sells a cheese cake right out of the freezer with out at least SAYING something. Â If we had been told, we could have had the option to order individual slices. Well now I am up and irritated beyond belief that my wife just wasted all that money and time for something worthless. So I decided I needed to place a call. I asked for the manager. Upon explaining everything he saw nothing wrong with the situation ""oh yeah of course it's frozen, you should have asked for a non frozen one"".... This is someone lacking in both sympathy and common sense. Someone deserves a nice lump of coal in their sticking for Christmas and the flu to boot!"
Sara F.,"Calgary, Canada",85,67,40,5.0,12/21/2017,"Amazing....and delicious! How can you visit the US without hitting up the Cheese Factory? Large menu with some great favourites like the Avocado Eggrolls...yummm! But the main attraction is the Cheesecake...obviously!  Everyone at our table ordered their own cheesecake which all tastes soooo good. Carrot cake cheesecake was the best, birthday cake cheesecake was tasty, the original cheesecake is simply a classic, and the turtle cake was also good. Once we received our cakes....everyone else around us ordered their own cakes after seeing ours...haha.  Overall great service and the patio was really enjoyable during the nice outdoor weather.  Gotta go here...it's close to Disney and a great change of scenery and food from a long week at the park."
Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",45,401,540,3.0,9/30/2017,"It's ok. Over the years I heard a lot of hype about The Cheesecake Factory, though I never had a chance to eat at one until now. To me personally, it's a standard restaurant and wasn't as ""great"" as I've heard. Don't get me wrong, it's ok - but I don't see what the fuss was about either.  And in all fairness, I understand The ""Cheesecake"" Factory is probably popular because of their desserts, but I didn't have any so this review is about everything but that.  Located in the Anaheim GardenWalk, this is about a block or two from Disney (depending on which direction you're walking from) - so expect crowds based off of that and on The Cheesecake Factory's popularity.  It was very crowded and we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a seat (my limit is 15, but I was feeling generous that day). We were given a choice of seating in which to wait for, but we wanted a booth so that may have been it. The place is also very noisy, so if you're looking for a quieter dining experience, then this place isn't for you. The decor......is blah. I wasn't expecting cheesecake wallpaper or something, but to me it just appeared bland. But small potatoes.  The menu was ok, though on the pricier end. I ordered my usual burger and while it tasted just fine, I've had both better and cheaper at the same time. None of us wanted dessert, so we got the check after the dinner. Maybe next time IF I decide to go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I will try something sweet or even a slice of cheesecake.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  Overall an option in the area full of good options. If you're looking to save a little and/or a quieter or less busy experience, then you could probably find it elsewhere."
Reg G.,"Orange, CA",95,92,222,3.0,11/29/2017,"I hate to give one of my favorite restaurants a 3 star rating but unfortunately the product has not been meeting expectations.  Let's start with the complimentary bread and butter. It's hard to mess that up right? Well they seem to find a way to do so. Nine times out of ten, the. Bread the bring is cold. Who wants to eat cold bread? Not I.  Secondly, everyone I come I order the eggplant Parmesan. And when it's available, it it incredible. They are consistent with this dish. When I was a meat eater I used to get the chicken bellagio and that was incredible. But those days are long gone and I'm committed to this vegetarian/border line vegan thing. Cheesecake Factory is my cheat day restaurant. So lately all Cheesecake factories have been running out of the eggplant Parmesan. I still don't understand how you can manage to do that. So it's been throwing me off and making me think outside the box on what to order on their rather large menu.  Thank God I found a great tasting appetizer, the Korean fried cauliflower. Yum yum in my tum tum. Seriously! It taste like I'm eating sweet and sour and orange chicken. It's delicious. That's been a saving grace for me because meal wise, I won't order anything else on the menu.  Lastly, the dessert. Ultimate red velvet cheesecake is my go to. It can bring me out of a slump, pick me up if I was down and yea you get the point. They have never messed this one up. This is 5 stars all alone.  The service is always pretty decent, but they really need to stop running out of eggplant parmigiana and stop serving cold bread. I mean seriously, put it in the microwave and warm it up. Laziness got you this 3 star rating from me."
Tim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",665,980,6650,4.0,11/13/2017,"11/08/2017 What are the chances when Annee T. and I come here to get something to eat before heading home. We run into Nate M, Natasha N, and Tien the photographer at our event. We were seated towards the back at a table when Natasha spots us while they are leaving. Such a coincidence to run into them.  When we were ready to order, Annee gets the chopped salad which is really chopped up. I want to get the avocado toast which is fully loaded when it arrives to the table. I was expecting just toast and avocado. There are grape tomatoes cut in half and slices of radishes with long stemmed spinach leaves on top of this thing. Luckily the toast was already cut into slices you can grab so when you cut into the leaves, that's all you need to cut. Is it the seasoning or just the tomatoes were that sweet in each bite I had. I am ordering this next time I need just a snack and not a full meal and hope it's just as tasty as this one order."
Nicole M.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",56,89,74,3.0,11/9/2017,"Fun atmosphere for Happy hour in the bar area. Got guacamole and chips to start, chose medium which was spicy but we loved it. Huge portion too! We got the orange chicken for dinner..super disappointed. There was hardly any chicken, mostly breading! The flavor was good though. Kinda bummed they didn't offer anything when we complained but glad they were letting the kitchen know because you expect chicken to be in ""orange chicken"". Delicious drinks and cheesecake, service was good too. I'd come back but definitely not order that dish again. Oh and don't expect to be served at 3:50, happy hour starts at 4!!"
Candace C.,"Sacramento, CA",343,100,236,4.0,12/21/2017,"Always a good time at CCF, this was my first time dining at this location. We ordered the Korean cauliflower (omg!), veggie burgers and fries. The cauliflower y'all, the cauliflower. Order the cauliflower!! Perfect crunchy texture, sweet tangy closer to a hoisin type sauce. Even the non-cauliflower lovers will dig this app. I love cauliflower but you literally can't taste it lol but no complaints here! The CCF veggie burgers are made in house...who knew!? Enlarge my pic and you can literally see the beans and grains of rice inside. It was a huge patty, in fact too heavy and pieces of it fell apart each time we grabbed them to take a bit. I don't recall y'all the ingredients, but I suppose there was no binder (ie egg) to hold the patty together. It was fairly bland, but a little salt and pepper woke up the party. Due to the grains and veggies, CCF got a legit pass on the blandness due to all the goodness in the patty; little salt and pepper did the trick. Since the patty crumbles easily, spiced properly the ""burger"" could be crumbled and served as a meat replacement over pasta with marinara sauce, filler for veggie lasagna, tacos, burritos, or a mock meatloaf. CCF culinary development team, you're welcome for the plug (wink). Our server Andrew was personable, funny, and convinced us to go for the Korean cauliflower as an app. Good call, Andrew!!"
Roxy L.,"Olive Branch, MS",71,111,65,5.0,12/17/2017,Love this chain as always great service. We did have to wait 10 minutes for our table but not too bad since it's near the Disney Anaheim resort area. I had the tomato basil pasta with grilled chicken which was delish. We also had cheesecake of course! Their newest edition Celebration cheesecake and carrot cake. The best. Will return.
Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1053,4118,4.0,5/29/2017,"It's conveniently located at the Anaheim GardenWalk on Katella Ave just east of Harbor Blvd. My friends and I were in town to run the Tinker Bell half marathon over at Disneyland. It was good enough the first night that we ended up eating here on back to back nights for dinner. If you come here, be sure to save room for some dessert! Also this is a very popular location, so come early and pack your patience! *Cobb salad* This was one of the worst Cobb salads that I've ever eaten anywhere. It didn't even look good. The portion was huge, but that's not a good thing in this case. They did throw in some avocado slices on top, but seriously, order something else! *Lemon meringue cheesecake* Save room for dessert! I'm not a big fan of sweets, but this is one of my favorite flavors for cheesecake. It was awesome! *Crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp* This was on their small special menu. The presentation was good, smelled great, and looked very appetizing. Unfortunately it was a bit too sweet for my taste. All in all it was still not bad. It was super busy both times that we were here, but the service was great both times. Our waiter each time was very friendly and took good care of us. They had no problem splitting the check for us. I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again if my friends are in town for another trip to Disneyland."
Chelli I.,"Stockton, CA",62,45,53,5.0,9/25/2017,"The first time I visited Disneyland, this location failed me miserably. I decided to give it another chance this time around and they completely wowed me. Excellent service and delicious food! It was so good that my fiance and I went twice in our 1 week stay. Will def come back~"
Tea C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",329,102,88,4.0,4/21/2017,"The Anaheim GardenWalk is known for being a hub of many restaurants and trending shops. On a corner, there is a lovely restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one at The Grove, The Americana, and in the Brea area, but... I liked this one a lot. As usual, there was a parking structure nearby, a lovely walking area, and lots of people, but it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the later hour we went! We were, immediately, sat down and waited upon. Our water and bread came quickly, our waiter was very friendly and nice, and we were munching away before we knew it. My date had the Hibachi Steak with fried green beans and mashed potatoes. He added on steamed broccoli, which was also delicious. I had the Farfalle Chicken and pasta and I've never tasted more juicy chicken before. The sauce wasn't overly salty, and the pasta was al dente!  Too stuffed fro dessert, we could only visually pig-out on their new items and many-item menu of desserts. I want to go back and just have dessert next time!! ... And maybe some steak. With a quieter atmosphere, privacy, and a lovely atmosphere, this was my favorite of all The Cheesecake Factory locations, that's for sure!!"
Steve A.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,3,2,1.0,9/30/2017,Worst dining experience I've had in a long time at a restaurant! Ive had great experiences with Cheesecake Factory at other locations but DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this location! 1. Ask for no peppers on the item it comes anyways 2. Ask for well done burger and it comes raw! 3. Waitress never came back to table (25min) after it took 30 min to get food. 4. Asked for side of ranch and never got it 5. Sat without a drink for 30 min! I get it if you are busy but at least have the decency to check on the table periodically. I have never complained to a manager at a restaurant and tonight was ridiculously unacceptable!  The manager was nice and came over after we asked for him because the waitress did not and he helped but the damage was done at that point.
Tarin C.,"Tracy, CA",44,1,,5.0,12/18/2017,Very delicious! My Boyfriend and I just got into town for our Disneyland trip. We were very hungry I looked up the menu for this place and everything sounded good We got there and boy were they busy. But it was no wait at all it took ten minutes or less to get a table. It was really loud inside so we sat outside witch was perfect for us. The noise volume was way down compared to inside. However that's just my preference some don't care about the noise and some like myself want a little more quiet. The waiter that helped us I sadly don't remember his name was wonderful he took our orders without even writing it down and memorized all of it. He definitely met our needs oh he also checked on us here and there which was perfect. This was a great place to start our vacation in the right way.  My Love and I will definitely be coming back here again on our next Disneyland adventure.
Amanda G.,"Covina, CA",214,3,1,5.0,1/5/2018,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory to visit! The restaurant is huge, and the food and service never disappoints. Manager Christian took amazing care of me and my party and was so kind. Give the beat salad and fried cauliflower bites from the small plate menu a try"
Annie W.,"Anaheim, CA",677,75,458,5.0,11/17/2017,"I'm a sucker for The Cheesecake Factory! I think it's safe to say it's my favorite chain restaurant! (This was our second time to a Cheesecake Factory within four days) This location is within walking distance of the Disneyland Resort and a perfect spot to take a break from the parks! Their happy hour is simply AMAZING! A selection of close to $12 appetizers for less than $6 and drink specials! I personally recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls & Potstickers! Last night my bf and I came in after a day at Disney! Our server was named Brooke and was friendly and attentive! We split our favorite pasta, Farfalle with Â chicken & roasted garlic, and got two small plates to share! We got the grilled cheese sticks and taquitos! It was all delicious! Our pasta was AMAZING, as it's supposed to be! We've had problems with it at the Brea location on our past two visits there, so we were worried it wouldn't live up to our expectations! It definitely did, so props to the kitchen staff for sticking to the intended recipes! We've decided this will be our go to location, and we won't be going to the Brea location anymore!"
Kate M.,"San Diego, CA",203,129,8,5.0,9/14/2017,"I ate here recently during a trip to Disneyland. Coincidentally, it was also my birthday.  My mom wanted to go sit down somewhere, and I knew at the Cheesecake factory we could find a dish that everyone liked. I was right. When we first got there, the wait looked like it would take hours. They got us in in 5 minutes! They have an extremely diverse menu. Its pages and pages long. For example, I got a dish with ahi tuna, my fiancÃ© got meatloaf, my mom got a greek salad, and my dad got an Asian dish with chicken and rice. It was all really good. We also splurged for the grilled cheese (with truffle?) appetizer. It came with a tomato sauce dip. It was really good! Definitely something you would enjoy for a treat, it was pretty heavy so not something I would want every day.  Our waiter was really friendly, and made us all laugh. If there is such a thing as a professional waiter, he was it! He made jokes about my birthday, and we all had a good time.  We ordered cheesecake for dessert, and since he knew it was my birthday, he put a candle on it, and decorated the plate with some cherry sauce that said ""happy birthday"" and my name. It was such a nice touch! Although I tend to avoid chain restaurants, and usually opt for local ones, this was a very nice place to have my birthday dinner with family. My only complaint was that my dad's dish was very, very spicy!"
Adnan A.,"Irvine, CA",166,36,39,5.0,3/24/2017,"Even though it is a bit out of my way, this Cheesecake location is one of my favorites. My last visit was for an anniversary dinner, and not only was it one of my best Cheesecake experiences, it was arguably one of the best restaurant experiences I've had.  We got to the restaurant at around 8 o'clock, and it was popping. Took about 15-20 minutes to get seated. Our server, Carnell, honestly made this visit as great as it was. By far the greatest, coolest server I've ever come across! He was very attentive to our needs, full of jokes, and was very engaging. Being the indecisive person I am, Mr. Carnell was very helpful in suggesting both dinner and dessert options. If you ever get this fine man as your server, you are in good hands.  On to the food, I went with a nice rib-eye steak, and it was divine. Grilled just the way I like my steak, and the side of mashed potatoes and beans made for a filling dish. For dessert I went with a slice of Oreo cheesecake which is always my favorite. Experiences like these are what make me want to keep coming back to this particular restaurant!"
Sophie L.,"Orange, CA",113,51,10,1.0,12/31/2017,You'd think a place called Cheesecake Factory wouldn't screw up on the one thing they're known for. Sure enough this location did. Charged me for 2 cheesecakes I never received. The whole point of ordering from them was for cheesecake. The rest of the food is just over-priced and not worth it.
Rich B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",139,75,51,5.0,11/28/2017,"Food was delicious and the waiter was exceptional. Moms bday and we decided on this little gem, it's your typical commercialized restaurant but on steroids, lots of items to choose from, fresh, grilled etc... I would come back to this place for sure."
Dare H.,"Santa Barbara, CA",69,184,91,4.0,8/6/2017,"The same things I like about the Cheesecake Factory are the same things I don't like. The menu is expansive, the decor is corporately stylish, and the food is consistent but nothing special. Tonight I had lettuce wraps and flatbread, and it was pretty good. My wife and I had Tito's martinis and they were pretty good. The chicken in my wraps was exactly 6 pieces. It's all good, because I ordered these things, but how about a great olive, or a peanut sauce that rocks the house?  That said, they know what they are doing. They take in cash. They do a good job and are obviously running a successful operation."
Omar R.,"Anaheim, CA",656,144,560,3.0,1/31/2017,I'm not a big fan of cheesecake factory but Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 25 people waited about 1hr and 45 mins.. On 1/7/17 The manager I forgot her name but she was very helpful and nice with us. When we finally got seated down our waiter was awesome. His name was Jeff. He took everyones orders fast and got them out quick and was top of things.  I got my favorite dishes steak Diane steak and mac n cheese balls. It tasted great and i didn't hear any negative comments from the rest of the party.
Yanan P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",5,1,1,5.0,12/6/2017,"Crispy chicken and shrimp is very delicious,with a little spicy and juicy rice. The whole environment is a little bit dark, not get used to eat in this kind of environment"
Chris S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",44,8,,1.0,10/27/2017,It says on their Yelp page that they accept reservations but apparently the reservations are only done within the first hour of operation on a weekend. During evenings its first come first serve basis. I get that this is near Disneyland and it's probably busier than other locations but that's a pretty annoying policy especially if you do take the time to plan ahead. Also shout out to the random jerk face who answered the phone with attitude. I JUST asked a question asking for clarification on their reservation policy since the Yelp page says they accept reservations and I was told outright that no reservations were accepted. Learn some customer service etiquette you hack!
Rose S.,"Elk Grove, CA",120,143,470,5.0,12/23/2017,Always good eat. Conveniently close by Disney. Plenty of parking just don't forget to bring your ticket.
Gerald V.,"Garden Grove, CA",45,46,218,5.0,11/5/2017,"After a full day at Disneyland, we worked up an appetite. We were seated right away and our waiter George has been attentive, courteous and fast. This location is one of my favorite locations. At times it can get quite busy, especially if there's a convention going on."
Chelsea K.,"Torrance, CA",98,45,15,5.0,10/30/2017,"Our server, Ariel, was absolutely outstanding! She is extremely polite and attentive and we never needed to wait or ask for our server because she frequently checked up on us. I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations and I have never had such top notch service before.  Food is the same at all locations so I wasn't disappointed. On a Sunday night shortly after 7, we waited about 10 minutes for a table of 3 (even though they told us 5).  But 5 stars for Ariel who was honestly one of the best servers I've ever had at any establishment"
Barry M.,"Lodi, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/8/2018,"Food was great. Service was pretty good. Fairly pricey, but not out of line considering the quality of the food and the area (near Disneyland). I would go back."
Kyle M.,"Menomonee Falls, WI",0,11,28,5.0,12/26/2017,Good food Good service In Anaheim for Disneyland but was done for the day Happy to find a Cheesecake Factory  Had chicken sheimp thai dish. Sizeable portions Tasty
Dat B.,"Silverdale, WA",0,4,1,5.0,9/12/2017,"Just step out of the office? Just get hitched? Just finished with milking that cow? Just finish burying Nathan? (Your sixth goldfish this year) And are you feeling hungry? Well my lad and or lad-ette, look no further than the, Cheesecake Factory!  They have it all! Huge food! Huge options! Huge love! Cheesecake Factory! Free bread! Book Menus! Cake made of cheese! Cheesecake Factory!"
Jerome H.,"Las Vegas, NV",152,55,138,5.0,12/6/2017,You cannot go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Great place for kids and family gathering. This is also a good place for company meetings or meet ups. Food is consistent and the service is amazing. Food is great too with a huge selection of dishes to choose from. Don't forget to try out their specialty drinks too.
Thi N.,"Garden Grove, CA",92,150,339,5.0,5/7/2017,"Came here last night for our date and had to wait 20' because the line was so long. Food: ***** Ordered rib-eye steak and fish and steak special combination because we wanted to save our stomach for their infamous cheesecake. Meats are very juicy and cooked in a tremendously flavorful sauce, not too greasy hut very appetizing and delicious. Mash potatoes are surprisingly well done.  Got a white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and gotta say it did lived up to our expectation. This was not some cheesecake you buy at Costco, it was nicely made and had a sweet enough taste. Price: ***** We were happy to spend approximately $70 for the meal since the quality and service were top notch. Did I also mention how big the food portion was? Worth the money Service: ***** The waiter was very attentive and professional, he made sure we were well catered for but not to disturb us at the same time Ambience: ***** Though crowded but the ambience was very formal and cozy, a good place for a date, although it is not recommended for someone who enjoys a quiet dinner"
Hazey B.,"National City, CA",22,102,176,5.0,5/19/2017,Had lunch here with my mom and brother the Tues after mother's day weekend we spent at disneyland. It was my mom' first time at cheesecake factory and me and my brother's first time at this location. We live in San Diego. The location was nice eAsy to find no parking lot of its own there is a parking structure that is free for an hour. $3 for the 2nd hour. Walked in to a beautiful elegant and clean environment. We were seated right away. Felt a little rushed by the waitress when ordering but other than that she was amazing. Attentive and very helpful. Portion size were huge. Presentation was fabulous and everything taste amazing especially my dish! Would definitely come back here as well As reccommend to others.
John G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",298,401,861,4.0,10/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a fun place to go with the family. Â In this case, we took our foreign exchange daughter and her friend while we were showing them Disneyland. Â The menu is huge (which can be a little overwhelming), but pretty much anything you order is going to be good. Â I'm a fan of the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - sort of a sweet and sour, with rice and some peppers. Â Tasty! But, of course, the real reason you come is for the cheesecake. Â Since it was hard to pick, I suggested that the young ladies go to the showcase to look at the options after they'd studied the menu. Â They came back and made their selections (Anniversary Cake and Salted Caramel, I think) - and I split the Godiva Chocolate with my wife. The young ladies really enjoyed the experience, and we all had a great time. Good stuff, Maynard!!!"
Dr. O.,"Menifee, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/6/2018,"This review is in regards to employee knowledge about parking validation at the Anaheim location, not the actual food itself. I think the food is great. I went on Saturday, January 6, 2018. I met up with a friend I don't get to see very often and we ate and talked for quite some time. I got my parking validated right before leaving and the girl told me it validated 3 hours. I immediately walked to my car and as I was leaving the parking structure the arm didn't raise after entering my validated ticket. The girl at the parking booth informed me that I had to pay $3 for being 8 minutes into the next hour, which would make perfect sense if the validation was for only 2 hours, but I was told it was validated for 3 hours. I told her that the person at Cheesecake Factory told me the validation was for 3 hours and she rolled her eyes and said that, ""That happens all the time."" She said the validation from them is only good for a maximum of 2 hours. She suggested I call Cheesecake Factory and have them reimburse me if they would be willing, since they gave me the wrong information. I called Cheesecake Factory when I got home to let them know they told me the validation was for 3 hours when in fact the parking garage said the validation is only good for a maximum of 2 hours. The person on the phone told me it was in fact good for 3 hours. I asked to speak to a manager and the man on the phone told me he was and it's validated for 3 hours. I told him it wasn't and he said the third party who owns the parking garage has never indicated that the validation is only for 2 hours and they inform him if anything changes. I suggested he check with them because employees shouldn't be sharing the incorrect validation time. I don't know if it's the fault of the parking garage or Cheesecake Factory, but they are giving customers contradictory information and I don't appreciate paying $3 out of my own pocket because they can't get the story straight. I was also disappointed the manager didn't say anything other than it's news to him if it's only validated for 2 hours. I won't be returning to this particular Cheesecake Factory if they can't communicate directly with the parking structure where you need to park and when they find out information isn't working out correctly they don't offer anything to make it right. Very disappointing!"
Viridiana M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",4,19,27,3.0,7/25/2017,"3 stars because I like other dishes on their menu and love the ambiance. Happy hr and appetizers are good as well  1st time trying their Sunday brunch and I was not impressed, there's way too many good brunch places to go to that I will not be coming back for brunch.  Food was bland. I order the egg Benedict with country fried potato the potatoes were super well done almost burn. My husband order the fried chicken and waffles with burn potatoes lol (he actually likes them burn ) and was dissatisfied with the portion size, you only get 1/2 a small waffle and two smalls chicken strips. Â  Service: waitress was friendly but forgetful, we asked for extra bread (we love your bread guys !!!) and never got it."

Had the eggs Benedict, YUM. Their hollandaise sauce is excellent. Not too lemony and no awkward seasonings. Perfect consistency and flavor. The English muffins are toasted to perfection. A little bit of crunch but still soft enough to cut through easily. Adds the right amount of feel to each bite. The potatoes!! In my opinion, they could be a stand alone dish. Comes with a side of ketchup which is just enough considering you don't even need it.  This particular Cheesecake Factory had a very open layout. Huge windows, pretty much floor to ceiling. It was really regressing considering most other ones are more intimate with dim lighting. I quite enjoyed it.  I will definitely come back to this location next time I'm in town!"

Â She had the chicken salad and I had the chopped salad. Â Both were great and the price appropriate for the serving size. Â We both cleaned our plates but didn't leave hungry. Â Our visit was on New Years Day and we sat on the patio for a very long time....like 5 hours and the server didn't mind as the restaurant was slow. Â A nice day, but heavy traffic noise! Â Was a bit surprised to be hit with a $12 parking fee because the restaurant doesn't have parking for their establishment."

We didn't want to wait in the long line for the dining area, so as soon as we saw an opening in the bar area we took a seat there instead. Our waiter was very funny and so kind. Although this place is always busy it's convenient because it's close to home.  We had visitors from Alaska who never been to the Cheesecake Factory and they absolutely loved it!"
