Reyna R.,"Wildomar, CA",15,6,1,5.0,11/22/2016,Five stars for the red velvet cheesecake as always. Went there around 10:30 for my late night craving lol. But I was not satisfied with service the girl that was at the cheesecake counter not only took like 20 minutes for the slice but I'm glad I was keeping an eye on her. She grabbed my slice of cheesecake with her hand mind you she had just charged another couple. Of course I said something that is very unhealthy. But other then that of course I will comeback for my cheesecake. Just keep an eye on the employee lol.
Johanna O.,"Bakersfield, CA",46,11,1,5.0,12/7/2016,First time here was in October. Food was great servers were friendly. Validation for parking was taken care of. Would eat here again.
Bubba L.,"Orange, CA",49,46,201,4.0,7/12/2016,I recommend this Restaraunt the Bly problem is they hVe so many choices on their menu. That's not really a problem it is just a whole lot of choices . Everything that we have ever tried on their menu is very tasty don't think you will be disappointed if you choose to dine here  We have found the service to always be good even though at times they get very busy
Erica A.,"Pittsburg, CA",94,9,,1.0,6/7/2017,This place is not good they selectively place customers depending on what kind of customer you are. We have a service dog and were placed all the way in the back near the bathrooms. And a family with 3 kids were places in the back as well when there are plenty of open tables closer to the front.
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,4.0,6/28/2015,"My daughter and I stopped here for dinner before the Angels game. It's within minutes from the Angels stadium. It's corporate, so the service and food are always consistent. My daughter had the rib eye, which came with fries and onion rings. I ordered the steak and salmon combo for $20+. Fresh bread and butter came with the meal, as always."
Sarah V.,"Murrieta, CA",24,10,,4.0,2/14/2017,The Cheesecakes are so delicious. A little over priced I think but a nice treat from time to time.
Daniel B.,Australia,40,10,14,5.0,7/16/2015,"We came here for brunch after a morning session at Disneyland.  We started off by entering and checking out the epic amount of cheesecakes they had on display, which already had our mouths watering for some sweets. I got the grilled salmon and salad as a more healthier option to what was on their extensive menu. The salmon was amazing as well the assortment of greens and vegetables it came with. My mother got the grilled chicken tacos which instead of a taco shell came served in a lettuce leaf. They were absolutely delicious (I tried one myself) and a great healthy option at $6.95.  Then we got onto ordering desserts. Easily one of the best desserts I've ever tried. The Oreo cheesecake slice we got between the 3 of us (easily a shareable portion size) was absolutely incredible. It had visible whole Oreos right in the middle of the slice! It was served with cream and covered in Oreo pieces as well as topped with a large Oreo cookie! We also got some vanilla ice cream on the side which I would also highly recommend.  The cheesecake was so good we even went back and got some to go the next night!"
Pauline V.,"Anaheim, CA",445,170,394,4.0,7/23/2014,"Tip: Come before 5 PM to avoid the long wait. Also get your ticket validated for an extra hour once you check in (total 2 hours free from the time you received your ticket). Ambience: The interior of this place is stunning! High ceiling with elaborate design, filled with classy furniture. Even their bathroom looked nice LOL.  Food: Their Miso Salmon is superb! The presentation was devine as well. It comes with either brown or white rice. The meal was rich, tender, flavorful, and just absolutely amazing. It has the perfect level of sweetness and softness that just melts in your mouth. The mixture of flavors literally just bursts in your mouth!! As for drinks, mango margarita is super good. Tasted like they used real mangos and you can barely even taste the alcohol. It's sweet when you first sip and a little sour towards the end. For dessert, (all you chocolate lovers) Godiva chocolate cheesecake with whipped cream! :) Service: The staff was really friendly and were pretty quick with their service. They checked back on us frequently (prob because I came before rush hour). Come visit if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed. Just arrive the time I mentioned earlier or make reservations ahead of time cuz lines get crazy long"
Jesse R.,"Anaheim, CA",43,6,,4.0,2/21/2017,"Went to this place for the first time because it has been recommended to me by many people. I was not disappointed. The service was great, the food was as good as people say it is, and the entire atmosphere was very welcoming. I gave it four stars because of the parking situation. If you stay parked for over an hour in the parking garage, they charge you $3 and there is nowhere else to park without having to walk a good mile and a half as far as I know."
Kirsten J.,"Fresno, CA",8,39,4,5.0,10/19/2016,Service is amazing and staff is super friendly and lets not forgetthe food taste amazing! Definitely recommend eating here out of all the other eating places around here
Clinton E.,"Grovedale, Australia",0,2,,5.0,3/9/2017,Fantastic service and atmosphere for such a busy restaurant.  Portions were very large and an enormous variety on the menu.  Even kids menu serving size satisfied my 9 and 11 year old boys.  And of course the cheesecake was exceptional.  Can't speak highly enough.  Well worth a visit.
Lauren H.,"Atlanta, GA",547,417,939,5.0,7/11/2014,"Dined here last night with my family. We were quoted a 1.5 hr wait. My cousins and I went to get drinks from the bar so the wait didn't feel terribly long. Once seated, complimentary breads and butter were brought out to us quick! Our waiter took our orders and our appetizers came out shortly after.  We had the Cobb salad, avocado egg rolls and fried mac and cheese for our apps. Everything was pretty good. I had the wasabi crusted seared ahi tuna steak for my entree. I've never sent my food back to have it fixed but it was so overcooked that I had to. Our waiter quickly took care of the situation and brought me back another tuna steak within minutes! The food here isn't why I'm giving this place 5 stars. The food is decent but the customer service was fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive, quick and efficient. Even though the wait was crazy long, our food and drinks were brought out to us super quick!"
Christian C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4,10,34,5.0,7/10/2016,"Michelle H. is great and the food is exceptional! I had the Almond crusted salmon and my wifey had the spicy cashew chicken. Salmon was a nice size but if you love salmon like I do, it's an extra $6 for another piece. We also shared grilled asparagus, on the side. Love that charbroiled taste. Wish we had made room for cheesecake!"
Valeria E.,"Ithaca, NY",13,30,57,4.0,8/17/2016,"We came to this place 30 min before closing and decided to get burgers for to go. The servant was very friendly and helpful, but he had a tough time choosing a sauce for one of our burgers. My husband doesn't like bbq sauce, but this the only option other than the mayo. Well, we had to get burger with the mayo. They also offered complimentary bread and butter as if we were dining in."
Leslie W.,"Paramount, CA",220,11,27,1.0,10/14/2016,"I'm very sad and angry that they tried to SCAM us at my favorite restaurant; really had the WORST experience at this location... Long story short- came here with a friend and our first waitress was amazing, great customer service! Then our waitress' switched to a blond named JOY. She was nice as well until we paid our $80 bill in cash. When we left she came running after us saying our bill was SHORT by $20.  Impossible because we were 100% sure we paid in full plus tip. We talked with her telling her we paid for sure. She suggested talking to the manager and we said yes of course. She ran away and we went inside and the manager came at us VERY HOSTILE and started ARGUING with us on how they make a lot of money there and how we need to pay and how if ""we feel comfortable for leaving paying short on our bill"". Complete bs. I requested to check cameras for footage or security and he ignored my request. Him and my friend start to argue and it's getting very tense and loud in the waiting area.  The waitress comes running back saying how she ""found the money under the napkin"". Not true. We left our money in the booklet. Manager didn't apologize afterwards! Honestly HORRIBLE management and customer service skills by the manager (I wish I would have gotten his name, he didn't introduce himself). I'm very disappointed in this location. Please please check your bills before you pay people or pay in card and double check your account later! They really almost SCAMMED US! I couldn't believe it."
Michelle R.,"Lakewood, CA",318,106,62,5.0,5/3/2016,"I love cheesecake factory. Idk why a lot of my friends don't care for it. Things I LOVE at CCF: 1. Avocado rolls with an extra dipping sauce... you'll thank me later 2. Chipotle chicken pasta but substitute the Penne pasta it comes with for spaghettini .. trust 3. At my last visit, my sister and I shared a new item of theirs, lemon chicken with kale and couscous. Omg. Chicken is so soft and we didn't feel guilty eating it. So flavorful and clean. Totally recommend. 4. Peach mint Julip. Yes it's whiskey. Yes it's peachy. Yes it's yummy. 5. For dessert.. You can't go wrong with their red velvet cheesecake. It's a red velvet cake inside a cheesecake. Umm.. Need I say more? You're welcome. Enjoy!"
Leah C.,"Bakersfield, CA",59,26,9,5.0,2/25/2017,"Love the happy hour! Mojitos, buffalo blasts & macaroni cheese balls are my fave!!! Pizza is delicious as well!!! Great service!"
Sheila W.,"Anaheim, CA",9,33,4,3.0,6/19/2016,"My family and I just left this location for a Fathers Day meal. The wait and initial interaction was great. Not sure if i will return. In a nutshell, once we were seated the waiter hardly came around. I had to ask for our waiter to order food at least for the kids since we were waiting for other people in our party. The manager did take our order and the food came quickly. Once our whole party was there and ordered, it literally took almost half an hour for our food to come. While waiting the manager came and let us know that the kitchen was backed up and thats why the food was taking so long. When our food finally did come my plate was missing. Our waiter then asked if the manager advised that my order was dropped. The food was really good. I am just very surprised that even though i couldnt eat with my family they did nothing to compensate for this (10% of the meal, free dessert, etc.) I will think twice about eating here  again. Maybe just not during holidays."
Michelle S.,"La Verne, CA",0,3,2,5.0,10/4/2016,"Love coming to this Cheesecake Factory location!  I don't venture out to Anaheim all that often, but I am always happy to eat here when I do.  The service here is phenomenal, from the hosts to the servers.  Special shout out to Kelsey, our hostess the last time we ate here.  She was so friendly and you can tell that she really cares about the patrons of the restaurant."
Valentina L.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,15,5.0,12/30/2015,I had a great experience at this location. I love this franchise restaurant. Ariel was our served and couldn't be more happy. She was friendly and very attentive. I ordered the hibachi steak (my favorite) it was cooked so delicious! My child ordered the alfredo bow tie pasta from the kids menu and it was delicious!  -Food cooked great -Great service -Short wait
