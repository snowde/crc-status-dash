Brittany S.,"Seattle, WA",8,7,,2.0,3/1/2017,"Not sure what was going on at the Factory tonight. I was looking forward to dinner with my daughters all day.  We didn't wait too long for our table and I think that was the most pleasing part of our experience.   Our food came out in three separate intervals so we did not get the opportunity to eat as a family. My oldest daughters burger was soggy and not warm. Mushrooms burned and she said completely tasteless. The burger was mealy and black. The entire plate of food was not eaten. My youngest had chicken strips that were more like tiny odd shaped chunks/ remnants of what used to be a chicken strip. Tasted strange and rubbery. Also went uneaten. My shrimp and chicken bang bang was underwhelming. Rice super dry, shrimp overcooked. i only found two tiny pieces  of chicken.  Our waitress was a ghost as well... Said absolutely nothing when she saw none of food was eaten just handed the check over which was over $100 with our cheesecake to take home.  Just... Blah. Schmer schmer.  Sooooo super bummed out. As a single parent on vacation we look forward to the rare occasion of treating ourselves. This was a MAJOR letdown as our one night out to splurge.  We were looking forward to trying other dishes but just cannot afford to gamble again."
Walter T.,"Bellflower, CA",9,230,164,4.0,8/25/2017,"The only ""bad"" thing about this place is that is always busy, so you always have to wait. After that, it is excellent. Good food, good service, good decoration and a good price for the whole experience. I have tried the pasta, sandwiches and steaks, all good. No need to mention the fabulous cheesecakes ;-)"
Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24,4.0,7/4/2016,"My friend was staying at Anaheim Marriott nearby, so we decided to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. She's in town here and there as she's a flight attendant. She thoroughly enjoyed her last visit here, and didn't really want to try anything new.  There is a parking structure for this plaza, but make sure to get your ticket validated at the restaurants where you dine! Avocado Eggrolls (Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.) Garlic Noodles (Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Delicious Garlic Sauce. Available with Chicken or Shrimp.) Teriyaki Chicken (Chicken Breast Charbroiled with Teriyaki Sauce, Served with Steamed Rice.) FREE - Caesar Salad (The Almost Traditional Recipe with Croutons, Parmesan Cheese and Our Special Caesar Dressing. Available with Chicken.) TO GO - Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce.) This location does get busy due to the nearness of hotels and Disneyland but we were seated promptly when we arrived around 8 pm on a Thursday night. I have a few dishes that I always order when I visit any Cheesecake Factory, and that is the Avocado Eggrolls and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Never can go wrong with these two. Service was quite slow and we were starving. Once we were seated, we were looking for our server as we wanted to order right away. Took awhile, but we were finally able to order. We told the server that all the food could be brought out all together, no need for the appetizer to come first and then the entrees. So happy that they still serve the honey wheat and french bread with butter. So delicious! The manager did end up stopping by our table, during our meal, to let us know that the chef didn't approve of the Garlic Noodles dish they made and wanted to remake it. The manager wanted to apologize and give us an option of free soup or free salad. We totally were not expecting that level of service and was pleasantly surprised. We opted for the Caesar Salad.  My friend decided upon the Garlic Noodles and the Teriyaki Chicken. Both dishes were a first for me and I did enjoy the Garlic Noodles. The only thing that I did not enjoy about the Noodles was the Asparagus. It was not fresh at all. The stalk was so thick and dry that I was surprised the chef approved this 2nd plate for us to eat. It was like chewing gum. The Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet for my taste and the rice horrible, but my friend enjoyed this dish. Personally, I would not order Asian food at an American restaurant but everyone has different tastes. Since I was here and didn't get to eat my favorite, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, so I decided to order it to-go. Because how can I not? The portion was quite decent and the prices of all the dishes are always decently priced. Overall, my expectations of the food are up to what I expect from any Cheesecake Factory location. The parking structure was a bit of an inconvenience. The parking spots are a bit tight, so be careful of the cars next to you."
Jessica K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",101,404,50,5.0,6/24/2016,"This location is very close to the parks, so it's a nice treat after a long day of walking/waiting in lines! The line may appear long from the outside, but often it's not all that bad. Make your way to the hostess table, and check before counting this place out. Often times there are big groups that just can't be seated as quickly, so they all converge outside.  The menu is awesomely huge, so there is something for everyone! I love the macaroni and cheese ball appetizer and even better is the macaroni and cheese ball burger... divine!! They have a great selection of beers on tap, and a full bar if you need something extra to unwind with at the end of a long day.  Prepare, this place is a little dark inside. Great for date night or a more intimate dinner party!"
Lynn N.,"Anaheim, CA",1,28,28,2.0,1/24/2017,"Went here at around 8pm on a weekday. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in such a long time and was prepared for a hefty tab between my bf and I. We got seated within 5 minutes of walking in. What sucked was the host took us to our seat, which hadn't been cleaned up so he tried to walk us back towards the front again, only to have someone else tell him to seat us next to the seats that were being cleaned up. That new spot was tiny! We aren't big people but it was uncomfortable with very little space for anything. The utensils and napkins took up 70% of the table space already.  My bf was already not in a good mood because of the seating issue already but I tried to make the best of it. Took around 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and took her another 10 minutes to drop off our water. My bf's water was dirty but since she walked away we couldn't stop her fast enough to ask for a new one. He ended up not drinking water during our dinner :/  I ordered the pasta carbonara and my bf had the Cajun jambalaya pasta. I enjoyed my pasta carbonara (no meat) and my bf was indifferent with his jambalaya. For how much food we received, the bill was close to $40, which I think was overly priced. The service was what kind of affected us and made the visit unpleasant for us. We knew walking in that the food would be pricey so we were prepared for that, but when you receive terrible customer service, it's hard to enjoy your food. We will probably be eating somewhere else moving forward as this place doesn't seem to suit us."
Christina C.,"Cypress, CA",9,19,34,3.0,2/2/2017,"Ate at this location for the first time on Tuesday night with a small group of friends. Came in around 9:30, ordered drinks + food. This review is solely based on the items I ordered. Korean cauliflower - 5* - new menu item, I forgot if that was the whole name. Could have been Korean fried cauliflower? Anyways, the sauce it was marinated in was really good. It didn't even taste like I was eating a vegetable. 10/10 would recommend. Ribeye steak - 2* - by no means am I a steak snob, but I've had my fair share of ribeyes from plenty of different restaurants. I've even ordered the ribeye in the past @ the Cerritos location & I would give that a 4* rating. However, this location's ribeye (the one I was served anyways) only deserves 2*. It was definitely the chewiest steak I've ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm pretty sure the cut itself was wrong, because it was very difficult to slice through. I was pretty disappointed because that was my cheat meal :( Although the mashed potatoes and broccoli it came with were both good. I would not recommend. Bloody Mary - 4* - I looove bloody mary's & the mix they use is pretty tasty! Recommend. All in all, for the price of my meal, it wasn't really worth it. *sighs*"
Vanessa V.,"Anaheim, CA",10,44,23,5.0,8/13/2017,"Came here on 8/12/17 to celebrate my cousins engagement. We had a party of around 15 on a Saturday night so it was hectic there. Drinks and food were yummy but my review is to acknowledge the great service that was given by our waiter ""Cornell"". He is top of line with customer service. If I was the manager I would be blessed knowing I had someone like him working for me and attending to my customers. Very sweet and attentive. Defiantly made our experience and our night fun. I can truly say he provided the best experience for us and for this will defiantly be back. Thank you Cornell you truly made my cousins night memorable!!"
Violet H.,"Anaheim, CA",67,6,14,1.0,8/24/2017,"The kitchen staff is more concerned about food cost than the quality of the food being served to their ""guests."" I went yesterday evening with some family and left CCF very disappointed. My crispy chicken sandwich had the option of either chipotle or buffalo sauce, so I went with buffalo. My sandwich had a smidge of sauce on it, but that wasn't the kicker. The lettuce on the side of my plate that's supposed to go on my sandwich was wilted and had bronze tint. The side salad that came with my meal was covered in dressing and already wilted when it reached my table AND some of the lettuce was bronze tinted as well. My daughter's ""fruit cup"" had wilted blueberries, discolored pineapples, squished grapes, and old, tired strawberries. To top it off, my niece ordered buffalo wings and the celery had a hair on it! I didn't send the food back in fear that the kitchen staff would do something disturbing to my new order. They were careless the first time, so imagine how they would react the second time."
Sam L.,"Tustin, CA",0,32,26,4.0,5/1/2017,"Good place to eat, we came yesterday around 9ish and luckily we were seated right away after walking in. They have a huge menu! (No seriously, choices are endless) I was craving pasta so for the fettuccine alfredo my hubby got the ultimate bacon burger with the side of regular fries that was one massive burger as well..the portions were good and the food was fresh. The environment was cozy and relaxing the waitress was very kind to us since we took forever to order. She was very attentive to what we needed and if our food was to our liking. I didn't get her name but for me being my first time being there I'll totally want to go back. Big thumbs up!!! ohhh and they validate parking we forgot our parking ticket in the car but remember to take yours to get it validated!"
Mary P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",126,75,41,1.0,3/1/2017,"Health hazard! Had some appetizers at the bar and ordered two entrees to go. The servers at the bar were attentive enough and the food came out quickly. When I got home to eat my entree, I took a bite of my steak medallions and almost choked on what I thought was a super tough and rubbery piece of meat. It wasn't meat. It was a rubberband and it smelled as though it had gone through the cooking process with the rest of the dish because after smelling the dish more closely, it has a slight chemical smell. Aside from that, the noodles on the other entree I ordered to go were extremely overdone, to the point that they were slightly mushy. I called the restaurant right away and asked to speak to a Manager. She was apologetic and took the meat dish off my check. Seemed like some pretty careless (and potentially hazardous) mistakes in the kitchen on that particular day. Not at all what I would expect from a huge chain like The Cheesecake Factory."
Trevor Sebastian ..,"Chino Hills, CA",16,16,8,5.0,1/5/2017,"Really nice Cheesecake Factory. My girlfriend and I had some dishes off the happy hour menu that were very fairly priced. One of them being the spinach dip, which I was basically licking off the bowl towards the end! I also had their salmon salad. Very good besides the copious amounts of kale. But if you like kale, get that!  Our waiter was SO friendly and accommodating that I would have asked him out for a drink if my girlfriend wasn't there (kidding, but seriously he was super nice). He checked on us regularly, boxed our food for us, and even reminded us for parking validation, which totally skipped my mind. If you're looking for a good cheesecake factory, this is a keeper!"
Daniel M.,"Bangor, ME",10,71,44,5.0,1/1/2017,"We were seated promptly. Service was quick and attentive. We had skinny Asian chicken salad, California guacamole salad, white chicken chili and cheesecake for desert. The portions were filling. They also validate parking."
K S.,"Orange, CA",0,84,3,5.0,8/24/2017,"Phenomenal! Jason was amazing - he was very attentive and polite - and most importantly had a great personality. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out tasty and hot. I enjoyed the salmon special, while my other half enjoyed the carbonara. Will definitely be coming back!"
Bethany H.,"Concord, CA",0,21,2,5.0,8/23/2017,Excellent service. Seated us right away and our food came with in 15mins. Defiantly better service than in Nor Cal. Just remember to validate parking and it's on a time limit of 3 hrs.
Isaiah A.,"West Covina, CA",173,55,140,4.0,1/4/2017,"I was in town for the 2016 Playstation Experience convention with a friend. After the 1st day we were super hungry. Eating food from the convention is sort of expensive...ok it is expensive haha. So when we arrived here we went to the bar to grab a beer and drink. Our bartenders were nice and engaging, but they did forget to give us utensils when our food arrived. I got myself the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which was a big portion too. That says a lot from this big guy haha. In the end I finished it and it was great. Also this dish may be spicy for some, so a little warning for those that don't like spicy food."
Bryan N.,"Anaheim, CA",456,165,316,5.0,11/23/2016,"A great place with a positive review. I had just knew that this location is close to Disneyland because my parents and I just finished our day at the Happiest place on Earth. I have been here and still probably this is my ""go to"" place. This review was based on the birthday celebration I had. The greeter was a waitress named Sarah (Sara) and was treating our family with a smile and that's what I call respect. I have to agree with most people because this place is huge! The food is AMAZING! Having to dine here many times, I had to try everything on the menu and I almost was full. Try not to overstuff yourself.  I respect what the customer service does because there's no doubt they are AMAZING and hardworking employees both men and women. I have to credit the formal attire because their outfit looks professional. Finally, I recommend it for EVERYONE! With many positives and some negatives keep up the good work! This place will be one of the top 3 go to Anaheim places."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,11/8/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
John E.,"Valencia, CA",171,272,1474,4.0,1/21/2016,"We were in town for a sporting tournament headed over for to one of our favorite places. Yup. I have once again walked into The Cheesecake Factory. i was expecting it to be a little more nuts here being so close to Disneyland, but we had a great experience.  We had a group of 9 so we had to wait about 15 minutes for tables to be cleared. Not bad for TCF. Time waiting can always be entertained by gazing into the glass case of cheesecakes at the front. Deciding which delicious cake to have it definitely a tough choice - they all look so incredible! Service was excellent. Melissa our lead server was amazing. She got all our orders up quickly, kept the drinks filled. We got our bread and our oh by the way I need this added with no problems. After she even noticed our large group and volunteered to split up the check if needed. Wow. Usually you have to ask and then get the sigh from the server, but again she was very accommodating. She asked for our parking ticket too for validation.  The food was awesome as usual. I split mine with a friend because the portions are sooo huge and you do want to save room for some cheesecake. Turkey club was my choice this time around. Other ordered burgers and pasta dishes which looked fantastic. One of my absolute favorites is the buffalo blasts. OMG these are the best!!!!! They also have a full bar and great drink list. Only 3 beers on tap tho.  After filling our pie holes - we ordered up the cheese cakes. Got them in to go boxes so we could get our fill and be ready to take the rest to go. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory and enjoy seeing all their locations."
Tawnia K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,1,2.0,11/13/2017,"Last night I had the Seared Ahi and I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the fish. It should have been smooth and almost buttery. But instead it was gristly and lacking flavor. I should have sent it back, but we had a concert to go to. When you pay $21.00 for your dinner, I expect better food. The wait staff seemed a bit inexperienced too, but very friendly."
Giovanni E.,"Anaheim, CA",63,2,,1.0,8/30/2017,I had the worst experience yesterday at this location. I have family visiting we were 7 adults. We ordered two jambalaya shrimp and chicken along with other 5 orders. There was exactly two pieces of shrimp in each plate. Also we had another order that the shrimp was cut down to little pieces. Its was really a bad experience since i had people that was from out of town.
