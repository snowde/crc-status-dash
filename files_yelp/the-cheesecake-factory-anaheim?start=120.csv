Evelyn T.,"Garden Grove, CA",74,32,17,4.0,1/7/2017,"Came to this restaurant to celebrate my friend's 18th birthday and my experience there was amazing! The food was so good, some may say it's a bit pricey but that is because they give you a very large portion! So it would be smart to share! My sister and I shared shrimp with angel hair and it was very good! Next time I go I'm going to try the chipotle pasta! My friend got that and she let me try it and it was sooooo good! It had the perfect amount of chipotle and it was just so tasty so next time I'm going to try that!  Also, we had like the best waitress ever! Her name was Amanda and she was sooo nice! Probably one of the best waiters I've ever had! She made sure our experience was impeccable! And my friends and I all agreed that we'd be coming back because the customer service as well as the food was awesome! Customer service is very important to me so I'm definitely satisfied with this restaurant!"
Nicole H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",22,48,2,5.0,3/15/2017,"This is hands down one of the best of their many locations!! I had the Jamaican pepper shrimp with a strawberry lemonade, my daughter had the shrimp scampi and my baby had the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes. The entire meal was DELICIOUS!! I had a vanilla shake for my dessert. It wasn't the best shake I've ever had, but it was decent. I've had quite a few meals from this location and they have always been great."
Susan K.,"Anaheim, CA",28,23,37,5.0,8/27/2017,We usually sit out side  great service  and relaxing  located in the garden walk.  for a dinner or just a slice if cheesecake it one of our favorites. Oh some times free entertainment
Katelyn T.,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",37,403,788,5.0,10/15/2015,"We love the cheesecake factory since the Big bang theory show. We always try to eat here every time we travel to the US (theres no cheesecake factory in Canada :( ) The portions are massive. Pasta dishes are delicious. I have tried so many cheesecakes; they are all pretty good. My favs are strawberry, carrot cake, banana mango, and banana cream  Service was great this evening"
Dalisha T.,"Irvine, CA",383,8,,5.0,8/9/2017,"MIGUEL is the BEST! Amazing server, very attentive, kind and awesome! Made our experience great tonight!"
Jo R.,"Harrison Township, MI",30,18,28,5.0,6/10/2016,"As always great food & service.  Being from Michigan, we only have 1 CCF. So it's always 1-2+hr wait. At this location in Anaheim, we were seated in less than 10 mins. We arrived an hr before close and never felt rushed once.  I ordered 2 drinks and they were great. Both mine and hubby's dinners were amazing. We ordered our cheesecake to go."
Don H.,"Sonoma, CA",0,109,126,4.0,4/12/2017,"For the most part, all the cheesecake factories are about the same when it comes to delicious food and exceptional service. So the garden walk restaurant was no different."
Kevin C.,"Stanton, CA",151,1,,5.0,8/13/2017,Celebrated my cousins engagement to his fiancé last night 8/12/2017 and I have to say Carnell/Cornell (not sure on the spelling) has to be the best waiter I and many others in our party have EVER had. He truly put a special touch on our celebrations. You can tell he's a very genuine person. He took care of our group (ladies first of course) ha and was there at our every need. I never right yelps seeing as this is my first one but I had to after this great dining experience. Thank you.
Joseph M.,"Ceres, CA",24,6,,5.0,8/10/2017,Service was good and fast our server Alvin was excellent food was excellent very very satisfied will be back again tomorrow
Danielle K.,"Orange, CA",72,4,,2.0,8/18/2017,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's and usually never had a problem. However, that was not the case this time. Seeing as it was Friday my friends and I expected to wait awhile to be seated which was no problem. Our table was right across from the restroom and right next to the kitchen. I don't normally like to complain about where I'm seated but it was hard to hear each other. Upon getting my water I saw my cup was dirty and had something floating in it. My napkin had a huge yellow stain on it. Our food took about 50 minutes to get there and two out of the four dishes we ordered was cold. Our waiter only checked on us twice. Overall I don't hate Cheesecake Factory but I was fairly disappointed by this location tonight."
Russell S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,89,16,4.0,11/16/2016,"While in town for a conference, my coworkers and I decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory for dinner. The convention center is located in the Disneyland bubble with few food choices other than the large chains.  We had meals at two higher-end steakhouses, but to be honest, my favorite meal during the trip was here.   Our wait time was only 10 minutes, which is rare for this restaurant as I'm used to waiting 30-60 minutes for a table. Our server was excellent, probably the best I have encountered at any of the Cheesecake Factories I have been to. He was consistently helpful, refilled our waters promptly, and generally seemed to care that we had a good time. I didn't catch his name,  but he had a mini man bun about the size of a golf ball. I'm used to rushed servers trying to manage the hordes of patrons commonly found here.  For dinner, I had a dirty martini, fish n' chips, and a slice of Reece's peanut butter cup cheesecake for dessert. The fish was tender, which was quite refreshing as my other seafood meals during the trip were tough and rubbery. Despite being very hungry, I couldn't finish everything, which is a trademark of the huge servings here.  The martini helped me relax from the long day of sitting in uncomfortable conference chairs and we enjoyed our cheesecake back at the hotel.  Overall, it was a refreshing meal that reminded me of why this restaurant is consistently packed. Good consistent food with something for everyone."
Chris G.,"Fullerton, CA",0,4,2,2.0,8/8/2017,"Came here August 3rd to celebrate my birthday, had a nice middle aged lady as our server. Everything was great EXCEPT when she kept 3 of my friends' change from when they paid their checks. She didn't even bother giving them their receipts. We were waiting for her to come back and when she didn't we had to ask someone if they could call her over. When we asked her for the change she handed it over WHEN IT WAS ALREADY IN HER POCKET. I've never had a server expect to keep the change from a check without giving it back to the owner first. I'm not saying she didn't deserve a tip but just keeping change without consulting first? Shocked this experience would come from The Cheesecake Factory."
Brittany B.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2017,"I came to this location with a group of friends for a nice dinner. We received everything but a nice dinner. When we sat down the waiter brought over waters. My water glass was dirty and had chocolate floating in it. Our silverware was dirty as well, along with one of the tiny plates. The waitress didn't even apologize, she just said ""I'll bring a new one"". A while after we placed our order, I still hadn't gotten a new water. When the food was brought out, the waitress had messed up one of the orders by bringing in the wrong side - that was corrected and honestly not a big deal. Everyone got their food but mine was no where. When the waitress came back out she said she'd check on it. Before I knew it the manager was at our table apologizing and asking if I would like something while I wait. They never told me what happened but I had a feeling it was going to take a while. I imagine they forgot to place the order. By the time I got my food I was the only one at the table eating. To make matters worse, when I got home I discovered I had chocolate ALL OVER the back of my pant legs from sitting in it at the restaurant. I am not pleased. The waitress never once apologized and the restaurant handled everything very poorly. I will not be going back to Cheesecake Factory again. It was the first and last time I will dine there. This location is a disaster! SAD!"
Jamie W.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/2/2017,"Thank you JORDAN!! I hope the manager sees this! I am staying in the area for an event at the convention center. It's hard for me to find somewhere I can eat with all my food allergies. I walked in to look at the menu and order something to go. Jordan at the counter was very friendly. She answered all my questions about the salad I wanted to order. She knew about the different dressing I would need to make it Gluten free, peanut free and egg free. I am highly allergic. She was confident and knowledgeable in the ingredients and making a special note on my order for the kitchen. I was waiting for my order and my husband called. Decided he would like something also. It had been about 10 mins since I ordered my salad. I go up to the counter ordered his salad from a different employee. I mentioned I already placed an order and she would add it to my previous order. I'm waiting on the corner trying to dodge all the people coming in and out. It was a super busy evening. Jordon came right to me dodging all the people. She was so polite and giving me my first order. I told her I placed a second one. She asked what it was, I told her and she said she would go grab it. Not 1 minute later she was back. Dodging everyone coming right to me. I hated to asked but I needed extra dressing. I felt like a pain. She was quick and friendly about it. Much appreciated Jordan! It's hard to find good employees that go the extra step."
Ash Z.,"Mission Viejo, CA",125,246,108,4.0,11/29/2016,When I am craving cheesecake this is the only place to go! I usually only order appetizers/small plates and dessert as it is their best options. Parking is validated at this location and the restaurant is a short walk from the structure.
Cari C.,"Montebello, CA",11,14,78,1.0,10/14/2016,"If I can give it 0 stars I would. For those who want to eat raw meat, teeth breaking bread and use a urine soaked bathroom this is the place for you.  I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken is raw. I find it unacceptable that a big restaurant has these issues and our waiter did nothing about it. I shouldn't be surprised because our waiter would only do things if we asked him at least 3 times like for more water. This happened last night (10/13/16) at 8:30pm. So while going to throw up in the bathroom the trash can was overflowing with trash and the floor smelled like urine. I informed some waiters as I exit the bathroom but they just carried on with their conversation. It seems that the only person who works around here are the bus boys."
Grace F.,"Anaheim, CA",122,56,160,5.0,5/9/2016,I believe you can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  My Brother was here visiting from Australia and is a big fan of the place. He always has to come here at least once every time he is here.  This time we tried something different from the menu that we usually pick.  OMG...... love the Avocado Rolls - would definitely be getting these again. Would I come back here? - Without a doubt we would be coming back here. We come here atleast once a year.
Angelica J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",50,19,6,4.0,7/16/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location has been one of the only one that I liked the most because it's big, their interior design and atmosphere is nice ! No doubt, their food was really good too. I ordered the Chicken and biscuits and it was cooked really well! I loved it! I'm for sure coming back!"
Beth C.,"Irvine, CA",224,11,14,2.0,8/29/2017,"Stopped in for some late night grub. Restaurant not too busy but they sat an obnoxiously loud group right next to us. And when I say RIGHT next to us, I could reach over and eat off their table. That's not tea reason for low review .. the service was so so and the kitchen wouldn't split a plate?! What the heck?!"
Rocklin M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,52,1,1.0,7/28/2017,"So we arrived and got the typical ""10 minutes"" to wait. 30 minutes later we were finally at the table. For some reason they kept putting our ticket back and then choosing the next party of four to seat.  Happy to finally have a seat and get some food. Waiter was nice and it started ok. After several ""your food is almost here"" comments from the waiter he introduced us to our waiter. Huh? Ok, I get that someone else is taking over, so just say you are passing us off. We don't mind.  Food came out and it was horrible. I'm pretty easy going. Have worked in restaurants and am forgiving when things aren't perfect. But this was bad.  Our new waiter had taken an order from another table and was stuck with his nose in the ordering screen for more than 10 minutes. He had never returned to our table after the intro. Our drinks were empty and no refills. I drink a lot of water and zero refills in an hour isn't what I expect in a restaurant.  Finally we flagged down the original waiter and asked for the check. 15 minutes later the new waiter brought it. I was about to leave. We paid, left and will never return to a Cheesecake Factory."
