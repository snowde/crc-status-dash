Brianna G.,"Chula Vista, CA",55,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place was the worst. I had been trying to place an order for over an hour through postmates so our hungry kids could eat once we got to the hotel room from a 14 hour day in Disneyland. They were tired and hungry and the first order was placed an hour and a half before this place was suppose to close. The order was simple and through this app it tells you what the restaurant has listed as currently unavalible so we figured our order would be fine. My phone dies on the ride and the order was cancelled due to our inability to make a substitution. Okay that's our bad. So we place the order again this time we see one item in our order was marked as unavailable. Another 10 minutes goes by and the app notifies us another item in our order needs to be replaced so we change it, nope cheesecake informs postmates again that they can't fill our order. I order it one final time and within five minutes we are cancelled. I call the establishment at 1030pm, they close at 11pm, to see what is going on and am put on hold for 15minutes waiting for the cashier to pick up as she's handling takeout orders. I finally get her and ask what's going on and am met with a bad attitude and am being told that they can't make a cheese burger because they are out of kobe beef. They can't make any burgers if they are out of kobe beef mind you. So why wasn't the burgers marked as unavailable like every other unavailable item for the past hour and a half??? This led to the kids being forced to eat what snacks we had left from the park as they could barely keep their eyes opened! And the adults had to spend an hour and a half wasting time waiting for an order that was never even give to the kitchen! The sheer fact that DENNYS had better service and was more attentive than this cheesecake factory is appalling!"
Doyle A.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,6,,4.0,11/5/2016,"Smokehouse BBQ burger was great. I'd suggest taking the salad.  I mean, my fries were good. All 12 of them.  My dates plate, medium rare steak, was nice and crispy. Some might even say not rare at all.   That is ok, a brief conversation with the waitress is all it took.  She didn't believe it was over cooked. Pleasantly frustrated, we decided accepting the crispy crunchy steak. I mean, the mushrooms were great.  So i suggest a nice burger and salad."
Rayshawn W.,"Paramount, CA",820,560,2232,3.0,5/11/2015,"Not my first pick for food but since my mom loves it, we came here for Mother's Day.  As usual, the menu has lots to offer as far as variety. I've come to the Cheesecake Factory many of times over the years and still cannot call off a single dish that I'd highly recommend. All choices I've made have been OK at best. Not bad but not great either. I also believe that the prices are a bit steep. A snack from the snack menu, an appetizer, two pastas, and two slices of cheese cake came up to $79...that's steep. I don't mind spending but it has to be worth it! On the upside...the portions of most of the pastas are large and the cheesecakes are delicious (As they should be for the restaurants name sake).  I know of many people who really enjoy this place but as I stated, I've yet to find a dish here that completely wows me. That's my biggest issue along with the price of what I believe to be mediocre food at best. If anything, I'll continue to stick with the cheesecake occasionally. Dinner 5/10/2015"
Sidney V.,"Santa Maria, CA",1,10,2,5.0,3/30/2017,"Every time my boyfriend and I come to Disneyland we make it a thing to come here. I've been here 2 times now and I always get the Hibachi Steak with no wasabi and the meal is to die for!! So so good! My bf has tried a burger from here and a pizza and he really liked both! I love love love hot wings so the last time we went we ordered some and OMG they were super good! Very spicy though so beware. Strawberry cheesecake is delicious as well, I have yet to try all the other ones. Service was very good for us as well."
Jackie W.,"Orange, CA",223,433,243,4.0,2/25/2016,"If their what seems like 40 page menu isn't enough to pull you in, then their delectable selection of cheesecake definitely should be. It's called The Cheesecake Factory after all.  This place always seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you can narrow down your meal choices, the food is almost always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy. On this particular visit, I went with the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, the perfect blend of spice, flavor, chicken and veggies. Plus I had plenty to take home for leftovers! I paired it with an Arnold Palmer (I love any place that serves these) and followed it up with the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake which is quite possibly my favorite sit down restaurant dessert ever.  The bigger portion sizes always equals a slightly heftier price tag. I think I spent almost $40 (including tax and tip) on the above but considering the pasta lasted me another meal and the cheesecake I nibbled on for several days after, it evens out. And you can tailor what your order to your price point by ordering smaller plates, getting water, etc.  The service was great. We actually ended up with 2 servers because we had a friend who joined us much much later and our previous server was no longer working. But one of the other servers very nicely took over our table and was super friendly. Make sure to get your parking validated. Your server can actually do it for you here so you can get your 3 hours free parking in the maze that is the GardenWalk parking structure.  My only complaint was when I arrived and asked if I could check in without my whole party there, the hostess said I could be seated without them. But when they called my name and they saw it was just me, they wouldn't let me be seated and put our reservation 'on hold' until everyone else was there which is fine, but need to give your customers the right information. I wouldn't have checked in to be seated if I knew I had to wait for everyone to be there."
Victor D.,"San Jose, CA",0,160,,4.0,12/7/2016,Ya service is good and maybe they get little overwhelmed on the weekends due to Disneyland next door. The menu is like a dictionary.    Cheesecake Factory definitely my choice to dine with my date any day...  They just got everything and the drinks - of course the mixologist from the corporate is he beating the nation and the recipes they provide is a perfect deliverable for 90% crowd that wants happy hour or pregame
Mario S.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,105,73,5.0,6/23/2017,"I like this place good service and good food very professional and the parking is excellent u can park in the parking structure and they stamp your ticket I ordered the White chicken chili bowl bombay! Last time I ordered the Renee special it's a half turkey sandwich, soup,and a salad for a resonable price! Cool place good atmosphere and a cool walk outside!"
Mel S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/7/2017,"The wait was long, our server was super slow and she forgot to validate our parking ticket.  The food was good, the server was nice but needed additional training.  We probably won't be back."
Jenny D.,"San Jose, CA",10,34,6,3.0,12/28/2016,"After a terrible experience with our first waiter, Adrian, who was not friendly and not approachable at all, we ended up going back the next day because my nephew wanted to. Thankfully we ended up getting a very super friendly waitress who made the experience so much better. She is how all servers should be. Unfortunately I did not catch her name if she said it but she was serving the patio section on 12/29."
Long H.,"Garden Grove, CA",141,9,6,5.0,9/25/2016,"Personally, I thought it was a great experience. The food was amazing and our waitress checked on us and made sure we were feeling great often! No mistakes that night! Food came out promptly as well!"
James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1106,935,1830,4.0,1/31/2016,"Let me preface by saying I'm a chain snob, if I can avoid it, I will. But it just so happens that I got a nice sized gift card to The Cheesecake Factory over the holidays and found myself dining here this past weekend and I have to give credit where it is due. There was a horrendous wait for a Saturday night dinner but luckily, I had no problem dining outside which meant immediate seating... yay! To start, I ordered an app that had three fried items - avocado, mushrooms, and zucchini. After eating this, I have come to the conclusion that avocado should not ever meet the fryer, it just doesn't have the right taste. Loved the two sauces that came with this. Oh, did I mention this app was on the house--I told our server that they didn't bring our app out before the entrees so he apologized, looked into it, and brought it right out and said it is comped. Wow- this made me remember your name Garrett! For my entree, I had their miso salmon. It is served on a bed of rice and there are a few sugar snap peas. This was a very generous sized portion of salmon and I loved the taste of the sauce. I only wish there was more vegetables in this dish to balance it out, but I had no other complaints about my entree. Quite frankly, I was shocked. To finish off my meal, I shared a red velvet cheesecake. This dessert was not high on the sweet meter which made it a perfect way to end the meal. There are so many cheesecakes to choose from. All in all, it was a very positive experience here and makes me feel like perhaps I shouldn't be discriminating against these chains because apparently, this one is doing it all right. I might just be back now!"
Abigail C.,"Anaheim, CA",330,158,131,4.0,3/5/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory!!! This location is as good as all the other ones. Architecturally  beautiful, always clean, friendly servers, and consistently amazing food! Must-Haves: 1) Appetizer: Sweet corn tamale cakes - OMG! Best tamales ever!  So moist and delicious!  2) Lunch Entree: Chicken parmesan sandwich 3) Dinner Entree: Steak Diane - perfect in every way!!!  3) Dessert: any Cheesecake! They are all really good!  Last time I went, I decided to try something new by going with spaghetti and meatballs. Not a fan of that entree. Our waitress came and asked how everything was tasting. All I said was it was fine and she instantly picked up on my dissatisfaction. It caught me off guard when she asked if I really was happy with my entree. When I said no, she insisted on getting me something else and said I shouldn't eat something I didn't love. Wow! Great service!  I of course switched to my favorite steak Diane! My only negative comment is this place is always packed (even on week nights) since it's next to Disneyland. Parking is a pay lot but free with validation so don't forget to bring your parking ticket."
Jen L.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,9,3,5.0,3/23/2016,I have a very good experience at this location  I ordered salmon and it was very tasty  The atmosphere was perfect  Will be coming back again to be his location for sure
Russ L.,"Honolulu, HI",233,168,338,3.0,6/27/2015,"Meeting my Sister in Law who is in town visiting my niece who is doing her summer internship at University of Irvine.  Its not my choice of restaurant, but its my niece suggestion and its halfway point to all of us.  (I live in Los Angeles)  The restaurant is huge, dining area is big, plus a patio dining.  Look likes they do cater to big parties, special occasion celebration and the vacationers visiting Disneyland. We didnt have to wait long to be seated, a very friend server greeted us and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.  The basket of bread with butter was brought to our table while we were still scanning the menu.  For appetizer,  we decided to order the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wrap.  Its very huge, definitely sharing for a party of 4.  Fresh crispy lettuce with cucumbers, carrots, the peanut sauce was amazing.  The chicken was seasoned, not too dry.  For the main meal, the niece ordered the Steak with mashed potatoes.  Steak was juicy.  I ordered my favorite, which is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  Seasoned perfectly, not too spicy.  My sister in law ordered the Chicken Wings with Sweet Potato Fries, which I really liked.  For desert, we all ordered our own cheesecake.   Cant go to Cheesecake Factory and not have a slice.  And they make the cheesecake good.  Im neve disappoint.   Service was fair, friendly servers, very attentive.  Price moderate.  Ambience okay, tables very close together. I guess its to maximize the sitting area.  Big parkin lot structure with validated parking"
Jessica T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1206,124,1387,4.0,1/18/2016,"Came in to get some quick to go dessert! So just short and sweet review regarding the food since I didn't get to experience service or ambiance of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I got two cheesecakes to go! It felt like an indulgent night. There were so many delicious looking cheesecakes to choose from, it was seriously a struggle. My boyfriend decided on the dulce de leches cheesecake and since he chose such a sugar loaded cheesecake, I went with the lemon meringue cheesecake to add a little tartness to our palette!  There were both melt in your mouth delicious. Nothing less than what we had already expected. Seriously it just melts in your mouth. I believe they take it out to let it thaw a bit before packaging it to go, because it didn't feel like it just came from the fridge! We were going to eat it when we got home, but of course we snuck a bite when we got to the car, and it was fully thawed.  We got home and threw it in the freezer for about an hour. Personally I like my cheesecake more firm, and damn it did it justice for sure. The cheesecake had a great texture after being in the freezer for a little time. It was creamy enough to melt in your mouth but not too soft like straight up eating cream. The heat from your mouth melts it, and it is bomb. The lemon meringue suited my taste buds more and my boyfriend liked his better. I thought the Dulces de leches was a bit too sweet, it has a similar taste to caramel, and it has an extremely heavy and rich taste to it. I loved the lemon meringue, it was tart and not overly sweet.  I'm excited to try other ones in the future! Totally digging this place just for the cheesecake."
Mike R.,"Santa Ana, CA",42,43,55,2.0,11/12/2016,"We were seated within 10 minutes as a party of 8, which was great. We placed our orders and got our drinks.  I told the server that i wanted another margarita to arrive with my meal.  Our meals arrived i figured it might be a couple of minutes for my drink, half way thru my meal the server came back and said should be a couple more minutes, the drink finally showed up after I was done eating.  So I sent it back, as I wanted to have it with my food not dessert.  Not great service, half the time you don't even see your server.  However the food was great, just service is lacking.  You would think that being outside a major theme park they would step it up."
Junior B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/27/2017,"Came here with a party of eight and the staff were very friendly and on their game. The restaurant is VERY BUSY and part of my experience was watching the waiting staff hustle to fulfill the demand. It is a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time if you don't want to wait 30 min plus for seating. My only complaint, and this is more of a personal preference, is that my steak was a little on the overcooked and dry side - still edible though. The rest of the family loved their food. All in all a great dining experience"
Molly M.,"Long Beach, CA",142,18,1,5.0,5/27/2017,Came for an anniversary dinner and Sean our waiter was absolutely amazing. We sat outside and he from the start delivered amazing service!!! He just started apparently but truly was the best!!! I have been coming to this location for a very long time. This was the first time that someone had gone above and beyond!! Thank you much Sean! You are going to a fantastic waiter at this location!!!
Yuhnard J.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,8,4.0,6/10/2016,"Food was above average.  Had the Diana steak combination with Herb salmon.   However,  I came here for the cheesecake!  Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  Rich, decadent and not too sweet.  The waiter, who reminds me of a hipster barista, provided excellent customer service! The total experience was good. But had to mark one star down because I needed to clean my utensils."
Aman S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,7,6,5.0,3/4/2016,"I don't usually go to this location because it's quite a drive but it was a special occasion so I went. My friend had her birthday party here so it was quite a large group, about 15 people or so. Despite the fact that we were a large group our service was EXCELLENT. I mean really I was impressed. At some points our waitress' attitude was a little off but I know how hard serving a huge group of high school/college kids can be so I honestly did not have that much of a problem with it. We did not have to wait long to be seated once our whole party had arrived and our drink orders were taken within five minutes. They split the checks individually for us at the end as well without any trouble.  As for the meal, I thought it was excellent. I ordered garlic noodles with shrimp and it was amazing. It was my first time trying the dish and I really enjoyed it. The sauce was excellent and the flavor all around was excellent. It could've used a bigger ratio of shrimp to everything else however. Overall it was a very good experience!"
