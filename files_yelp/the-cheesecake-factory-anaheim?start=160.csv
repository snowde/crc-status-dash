Paulo L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,7,3,3.0,5/20/2016,"Came for dinner, even though it's graduation season it only took 15 minutes to get a table. Tuna tartare was tasty but tiny, though at $6 you can't probably complain about it. Ordered their spicy cajun pasta, chicken carbonara , and chicken medeira.  The chicken medeira was the highlight of the night. Nice caramelized mushrooms on top of a nice and juicy chicken breast all topped with asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side. The cajun pasta was terribly overcooked. JUST TERRIBLE, the chicken carbonara pasta was not extraordinary. Had a raspberry mojito, I will probably need to do a diabetes test after that. Almost undrinkable, too sweet ! Service was timely, our server was corteous. Can't give 4 stars when pasta that overcooked comes out of the kitchen."
Brett E.,"Discovery Bay, CA",251,332,45,5.0,1/26/2017,Sarah Mae was a great server. Super friendly she recommended that Mexican chicken soup and it was absolutely delicious I also got the club sandwich which was awesome
Nids A.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,72,94,1.0,7/30/2016,Food is delicious but  service can be slow! I had to ask three waiters for water. I would choose a less busy location.
Shawn H.,"Oxnard, CA",0,42,21,4.0,5/13/2017,"Cheesecake factory never disappoints me or the family , this location we ordered pick up because the high traffic . Food was great as always , I'm glad we ordered to go because the line was pretty thick. But the ugency I saw to get to tables was very visible. Good looking staff EVERYONE acknowledge my daughter and in even though we were just  picking up and she had to use the bathroom. Overall pretty good for the short time I was there also the food was as expected and delicious so that's always good"
Camille B.,"Bakersfield, CA",191,224,56,4.0,2/1/2016,"I am not a huge fan of the cheesecake factory. I feel like the food is overrated and overpriced. They don't take reservations. The menu is too big. When my friends suggested we go here during our Disneyland trip, I was not looking forward to it. I felt like we would be waiting for a table forever. I was pleasantly surprised. Parking was relatively easy, as there is a garage right next to the eateries. We went this past Friday night around 7pm and the wait was only about 15 minutes for our table. Our hostess was kind and friendly. Our server was AWESOME. He made sure we had everything we needed. We were a group of friends, so we split checks weirdly and he was really nice about it. He even brought out our cheesecake decorated for my birthday and brought a crew to sing happy birthday to us. A+ on the customer service to all the staff we interacted with. The food: I got the club sandwich. My tomatoes were really not fresh....they tasted like they had been in the fridge or freezer all day, so that sucked, but I peeled them off and got over it. The cheesecake was bomb. The onion rings were awesome. The pina colada kind of sucked, honestly, and my friend got a Mai tai that also sucked. Bartender was not on point that night :("
Jo L.,"Salem, OR",0,45,48,5.0,4/28/2017,Service was fabulous! Food was amazing! Cheesecake despite the calories was out of this world! My husband had the filet mignon in which he describes as perfectly cooked and melt in the mouth! I had tuna tartar which was amazing! Then had the seared ahi tuna salad which was amazing! Fabulous dining experience!
Maria C.,"Fullerton, CA",49,39,27,1.0,12/19/2015,"Well how to start!! oh yea I'm only giving them a star is because I have to.  first time at this place, (actually first time at a CF location) and believe me I will never come back to this one in particular! I will give it another shot somewhere else! The wait to be seated was over and beyond ridiculous, I mean close to 3hrs! it's not like if it were the ""LudoBites, Restaurant"" here!! We should of known it wasn't going to end right when the manger Luis Orozco told my boss (the wait is long, yes & soo what do you want me to do? Kick the people out to give you their table)yea we should of left, but some of us wanted to try this place out!! CUSTOMER SERVICE: needs to be improve sadly starting with management!  We were a party of 12 celebrating our Xmas dinner, with our bosses family, they specificaly explain to the waiter that they were strictly vegetarian and that there were some spices they didn't eat! All was fine ""soo we thought!""  He wrote down their choices he went back to the kitchen, came back saying all is okay, the cook will accommodate your group! Well after the long wait to be seated Guess what? Yep their food was WRONG! Shortly after the manger came out with the last two plates, and when he heard the food was not right, he gave the waiter the plates & simply walked away!! didn't come back! Then the waiter suggested to my boss to switch plates with his daughter?  When she already has started eating it!! This crew was truly Unbelievable I was dumbfounded by their clumsiness!  Yea that Luis manager never came back to apologize at least!! FOOD: was tasty can't complain about it! Portions were filling, but after the way we were treated , no one was able to enjoy the food. It was all bagged to Go At the end we ended up leaving our table & looking for a manager, since he never came back!  We explained to her our ordeals  since we walked in to that place! She was kind enough to deduct some items from the bill. Honestly I personally wouldn't of paid .  Bottom line this place cannot handle big groups with that mediocre customer service/management they have!!  I will be calling their general manager to complain!!"
J. A.,"Anaheim, CA",67,17,38,5.0,6/11/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant if you are looking for some Cajun and pasta both savory flavors in one bite. This cheesecake factory is located near Disneyland but despite the bussy surroundings service here is quick. I came in with my husband on a Friday night like at 10 and there was only a 15 minute wait and we sat down in a booth quickly.  This restaurant can be for a casual occasion, night out for drinks, or just because. Our server was Elizabeth​/Lizzy , she was great. Lizzy recommended the Cajun  jambalaya pasta and the shrimp scampi. We ended up ordering that and we are glad we did. The Cajun jambalaya was spicy and flavorful. The portion is large and well worth the the price. My husbands shrimp scampi was a smaller portion but very good as well. When it came to drinks I was undecided between a blood ornage margarita and a passion fruit, again Lizzy explained each drink and differences. Throughout the entire dinner she was attentive and we appreciated her menu knowledge. Food was delicious and drinks were to die for.   We will definitely be telling others of our service here and great food . Last but not least I would like to thank Sean ( manager ) for assisting me over the phone with a question I had. He was patient and went out of his way to help me out."
Amber D.,"Garden Grove, CA",19,17,6,1.0,2/21/2017,"The nachos were decent, the burger was nothing but grease. I took one bite, didn't even eat the fries, and they still charged us for it. Cheesecake and Mai Thai were good, but not worth the cost."
Jaime W.,"Tustin, CA",64,147,405,1.0,7/2/2016,"Absolutely the worst experience of my life. I realize that this location is busy (all of them are) because it's smack in the middle of Disneyland central but to me that means you should have a better wait staff.  We were basically held hostage by our spectacular waiter, the guy has no business being a waiter or in any occupation that requires time management skills or people skills. I'd hate to see what that wait would be on a Saturday, we went on Wednesday.  Number of refills received at our table - 1, we had to flag someone down that wasn't our server. Number of minutes the waiter took to come back to our table to get drink orders after dropping off bread - 25 - waiter vanishes Number of minutes it took to get our drinks - 20 to 30 waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took our waiter to come back and take our order after dropping off drinks - 25 - waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took to get our food 45 normal for the amount of people but we didn't see our waiter for another 30 after that.  I dunno we would like refills now. No, no sign of anyone. Awesome we will all suck on the ice cubes. 15 minutes after the last appearance of our waiter, he pops back up and we ask for boxes. You would think we asked for his right arm based on his craptastic attitude. Sorry you have to do your job. Number of minutes until he returns - 25, again seriously WTF. Also all food is shoved in one bag for a party of 7 then says ""oh you didn't come together"". Asks if we want dessert- HUGE mistake. So refills...anyone...anyone..hey you random employee can we get refills now that our meal is over?!? Number of minutes it takes to get menus - 20 Number of eye rolls from the waiter when I ask for my cheesecake to go - 1 huge one. Maybe if you didn't take your sweet ass time I would have eaten it there but I really was ready to leave. Number of minutes to get cheesecake - 30....did he bake all them himself?? Number of minutes to get bill after cheesecake is dropped off - 28 This waiter could not be bothered with passing out drinks, he stopped at the first person at the table and stacked them all. He could not be bothered with picking up plates or even attempting to reach to get them, we all had to pick up the plates and pass them to him and when he brought the cheesecake he did the same thing.  No one bothers to offer refills, collect dirty used bread plates, check to see if anything was needed - you know all the basic restaurant industry skills. This was a sad day for The Cheesecake Factory, most likely will not be returning to this location unless I want hours of my life taken away."
Lynette J.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,37,4,2.0,2/20/2017,"My review isn't about the food because it is always great. Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 15 for my friends bday. She had a reservation for 7. When we arrived the hostess stated there was a two hour wait. I've never heard of making a reservation that could not be honored, if this is the case why even have reservations available.  We were eventually seated, outside which was not fit for a party of our size. The waitress was great and did her best to be accommodating but it was only so much she could do. This was one of the worse experiences I've had at a Cheesecake Factory."
Chris P.,"Anaheim, CA",1,105,26,5.0,4/29/2017,"Our favorite place to eat, we came here on a Friday evening and it was more crowded then i have ever seen it but they managed to get us seated in about 20 minutes in which i think was very good for how crowded it was and what was great was our food made it to the table in about 5 minutes i kid you not and like always food is awesome."
Priscilla S.,"Portland, OR",98,257,357,5.0,12/6/2015,"I usually frequent the Bella Terra location or Irvine spectrum locations for picking up my favorite cheesecakes. The customer service is cold and almost non existent.  However three staff here at Anaheim garden walk has amazing customer service. Not only were they the ONLY location with my pumpkin cheesecake in stock, bit they were so very helpful, friendly and FAST!!!!   Despite driving forever looking for this cheesecake, my night ended well thanks to the friendly staff here. The young man who took my order and bagged my items was fast and friendly.  A young woman was off duty collecting tips I think and she (unlike other staff at other location) made sure to tend to me making sure I was taken care of and even help the man bagging my order package everything. Good job guys!!! 12/6 8:40pm"
Chris S.,"Canarsie, NY",136,41,10,4.0,9/10/2017,"There are ton of different foods to choice, which is why you can only enjoy this place with a group of friends. You can't come here by yourself or two or three friends, a team of people. Then I recommend have your phone charged because the lines are so long. After you're finally at the table. Good food, nice waitresses, but you will feel bloated!"
Todd G.,"Perth, Australia",1,25,36,2.0,11/5/2016,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, it is a regular stop on all our trips to the USA. The food is always good and the portions extreme. However, I have to say on this occasion what let the Cheesecake Factory down was the evening staff on the reception counter. We came in and asked for a table for 7 people. We were told it would be 30 minutes which wasn't a worry. One hour later I had to start demanding to see managers and for 20 minutes I was told ""you are next"" as I watched new arrival after new arrival just walk in past us - one of which was a party of 10 people. I don't mind waiting and don't mind if a person tells me there are people in front of me, but there was obviously favouritism going on whether that be tips being handed over or something else. As soon as I started raising my voice, magically a table appeared. If you want great food this is definitely a great place and the table service I have always received here has been fantastic, but the attitude and the poor behaviour of the front reception staff can put a real sour taste on what would be an otherwise great night out."
Stacy M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",9,8,3,2.0,4/16/2017,"The service here sucks. We've came numerous times because it is in a central location to meet family and have family her togethers. The runners argued with us about the difference between salsa and red sauce. The menu clearly states salsa on nachos. I asked for no salsa. It came with salsa and they proceeded to tell me that was pico di gallo. Then they said they could go ""scrape"" it off or if I really wanted new ones, they could do that. This location sucks!"
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,96,9,3.0,10/29/2016,"Not my favorite CCF location because it seems very noisy, compared to other CCF Locations. The food was like we expected it to be, except for the chicken that wasn't fully cooked. Service was a little slow to begin with, but they caught up. Then it became a little messy again when our waitress went on break, and we got another server... All in all a decent experience."
Swt T.,"Houston, TX",6,174,74,3.0,1/30/2017,"This location is found near the Disney parks and near other busy shops and eateries.This location happened to be busy the night we placed our pick up order via the phone. In order to get to this location, we had to park our car in the parking garage (main parking for all  the stores in that location)..but thankfully the 1st hour is free. As soon as we got there, we were able to pick up our order in a timely manner and they read back what all we got before we paid. When we got back to our hotel, we got everything correct except one dish. Instead of the Spicy cashew chicken dish they gave us sweet and sour chicken. we were hungry and didn't want to go through the whole process of driving up there again, so we did nothing about it. the food was okay but the spicy chipotle chicken was dry and lacking the sauce that it typically comes with."
Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,1.0,12/26/2015,"Let me start my review by saying that the food itself was very delicious. The service however was sub-par. We arrived pretty late when it comes to dinner. We arrived at 9pm.  We decided to sit at the bar because we wouldn't have to wait. The server was very nice. Made us some drinks that were off the menu. That was very nice of him. Here's where he messed up. Twenty minutes after taking our order, he comes to our table and asks us ""did you guys order""? um why yes, yes we did.  Another twenty five minutes later and we are still sitting there, waiting to be served. ( the waiter comes back and tells us that the chef over cooked the steak and they are making another on the fly. ) We had just spent the day at Disneyland and we were very hungry. My companion suggested that we pay our bill for our drinks and go to the room for a popcorn dinner.  I proceeded to the front and asked for a manager. I let the manager know that it had been 45 minutes and we just wanted to pay our bill and leave. He was very helpful and kind. I didn't complain to have any ill feelings. I just expressed our desire to pay our bill and leave.  The manager got us served in a few minutes. He let us know that the server forgot to put in our order. Here's what irritates me. I was lied to by our server and on top of waiting 45 minutes to be served, he didn't offer to take one single thing off the bill. I mean not even a piece of cheesecake.  I still left a tip. I know how important they are to servers. But I wish I didn't.  Good food. Terrible service. We went to IHOP the next morning, and couldn't help notice how much better the service was. Made us wish we would have saved our money and went there."
Maila H.,"Orange County, CA",397,368,4584,3.0,9/25/2014,"Oh Cheesecake Factory so good but yet so bad. My Love and hate relationship will be never ending unless I can't have sugar anymore then I'll be out of luck. Until that day comes I'll keep coming back for more. Thank you Cheesecake Gods for creating so many irresistible flavors... Ultimate Red Velvet Craigs Crazy Carrot White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Fresh Banana Cream Mango Key Lime Chris Outrageous Chocolate tuxedo cream Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Oceo Dream Dulce De Leche Tiramisu Pineapple Upside cake Pumpkin Pecan Original Unsweetened My top two Ultimate red velvet and Craigs Crazy Carrot are too die for. With 1250 calories for the Red velvet and 1560 in the Carrot cake, its too damn good to resist. All that goodness in each and every bite makes it all worth it.  "" A moment on the lips is a Lifetime on the hips ""  Cheesecake is not the only thing they serve. A pretty impressive menu with America, Asian, Mexican, Italian and Seafood dishes. My opinion is the food is mediocre and slightly overpriced. I think they should just stick with making delicious Cheesecakes."
