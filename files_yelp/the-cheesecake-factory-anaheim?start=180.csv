Emily S.,"Chico, CA",1,5,3,5.0,7/2/2017,This place was great I got the the club it was a huge sandwich so good. Have gone to other cheesecake factories over the past but overall this is the best one!! It will always be the first restaurant I would go too.
Giana M.,"Juneau, AK",0,16,19,4.0,4/19/2017,"We hit it, then quit it. Came home with desserts in tow, and woke up smelling like garlic. One less star since there must have been an issue since our meal took foreeeeeeeeverrr. Other than that, it was a great time."
Fufu M.,"Orange, CA",2,41,17,2.0,3/21/2017,"The only reason we've ever went to a CF is bc we've been given gift cards for this place twice and both times we've been unimpressed with the food and the atmosphere. The food ranges from gross to average. It is overpriced for how mediocre the food is. The atmosphere is way too loud. It like they didn't consider anything in their design to absorb how the noise carries across the restaurant. I couldn't even hear my server, but considering that he sounded like he had a mouthful of marbles, it didn't help the situation. I left feeling disappointed and frustrated, vowing never to return and hoping I'd never have to. If we ever receive gift cards for this place again, I will be sure to regift them to someone with simple tastes."
Joe N.,"Antioch, CA",220,404,212,5.0,11/29/2016,"This particular location is one of the best!!!  Great service and speed along with amazing food and good, fair pricing and I must throw down a 5 star here!  I went on a limb to try something different, and boy was I glad I did!  I got the BBQ ranch chicken salad and it was amazing!  The flavors that mixed together just made this an instant favorite dish for me to keep coming back to get!  After they discontinued the meatloaf sandwich for God only knows the reason, I was mortified!  I found my replacement to that wonderful piece of heaven, now in the BBQ salad!  Loved the friendly service and everything about this was just a great experience!  Will be back here every time I visit Disneyland in the future!"
Hieu N.,"Santa Ana, CA",275,85,1278,4.0,9/29/2015,"With so many items on the menu from Asian to Mexican to Italian to American, you'd think that there's no way the food can be top notch. I mean other than the cheesecake, which is phenomenal, how can any one of their dishes really be specialized? All that being said, I'm pleasantly surprised every time I come. Here's a few of my favorites: Seared Ahi Roll - RIP. Sadly they've taken this item off the menu. But I just wouldn't feel right not writing about this dish, because it was easily one of our favorite dishes here. We always ordered one for the table as an appetizer. The tuna was always fresh, and the roll lightly fried to perfection. It sat on top of a bed of crispy white noodles and was finished with scallions, a rich creamy sauce, and a light and slightly sweet ponzu. CF please bring this back! Steaks Diane - Hands down my favorite dish here. The medallions of steak are always cooked to the perfect temperature, and are always melt in your mouth tender. I have to shamelessly admit that I absolutely love A-1 and ask for it no matter where I get my steaks. However, the sauce that makes this dish is so rich and flavorful, I find myself using A-1 every so slightly. You can't forget about the mushrooms in the sauce either; with the sauce, it makes the perfect companion for the mashed potatoes. Jambalaya - I usually get this dish with rice, but you can also get it with noodles. I love Cajun food and this dish surprisingly hits the spot when I'm craving that southern flavor. It's got a nice spice, and with an abundance of chicken, shrimp, and andouille, I find myself only ever finishing half. Few disappointing notes - The cocktails left me wanting more. The pineapple Moscow mule was flat. I craved that crisp ginger beer that makes the drink so refreshing. The peach mint julep was difficult to drink. The chunks of peach are appreciated, but with the crushed ice and the mint, it was impossible to drink through a straw. It wasn't any easier to drink straight out of a narrow-mouthed chalice either. Margaritas, mojitos, and martinis are a little too sweet for my liking. With most cocktails ranging from $10-12, I'll stick to the food unless it's happy hour.  Tips - Get their complimentary bread basket. The squaw bread never lasts longer than 2 minutes at our table. They've got a really good happy hour M-F 4-6 with drinks and appetizers starting at $5. Lastly, the service is always top notch!"
Jennifer G.,"Antioch, CA",3,3,,5.0,4/2/2017,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. I went in to have lunch and was in an electric scooter. They brought me to a table and asked if I wanted to stay in the scooter or sit on a chair, I transferred to the chair. The gentleman who seated me said they will put my scooter behind the hostess station so it is out of the way. My food was delivered in a timely matter and it tasted really good. The server was really nice and kept checking to make sure I didn't need anything. After I finished the hostess brought my scooter back to me and asked if I needed any assistance getting up.  It was really nice being able to go to a place that is willing to go out of there way to help someone."
Casey W.,"Chico, CA",6,32,24,1.0,12/21/2016,"Was seated with our drinks, waited for 20 minutes and watched our waitress take two tables orders in front of us. Nicole completely forgot about us. We walked out and walked over to California Pizza Kitchen and got seated right away. I even told them about our experience next door and they gave us a complementary appetizer!! Love CPK :)"
janet g.,"Montebello, CA",23,58,63,4.0,3/30/2017,"Came here on sunday after a day at disney celebrating my bday. It was packed as the cheerleaders competition was finally over and a bunch of them decided to celebrate here. We got seated quick though with about a 20 min wait. Our server Darius (I think was his name or Darell) was honestly the best server we've ever had at any restaurant we've ever been to. He was so happy and funny, great personality, honestly think he should be working at disney he was such a happy guy. We've been to cheesecake factory a bunch of times so we have our regular dishes and know what we like. Reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of him, the only reason I took one star off because even though he was great he was talking to other tables so much that it was taking him a long time to get back to us with drinks and to take orders. He seems to love his job and is a pro as he didn't write anything down for our table and the table next to us and got both orders correct. He noticed I was wearing a disney birthday button and at the end of the meal brought me a little something and sang me a beautiful rendition of happy birthday. Like I said best guy ever and we would make our way back to this cheesecake factory just for him. Food was good as always."
Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1556,258,124,4.0,5/11/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. Matter of fact, I am addicted to the Sante Fe Chicken Salad that they have!  While down at Disneyland for the run, we wanted to go to a place close to our hotel that wasn't at Disneyland to try and get away from the crowd.  We decided to walk around the corner to the GardenWalk and see what was going on over there. At 5:15 on a Friday night there was no one to be found. I hate to admit this, but after being at Disneyland all day it was nice to be in an area with NO ONE.  We walked up for dinner expecting to wait, and we got seated right away. It blew us away. Never before at ANY Cheesecake Factory have we not had to wait. Even in Pleasanton during the work week you can wait 20 minutes.  A must get cheesecake is: Salted Caramel. It is to die for. If you are even the slightest of caramel fan, you have to get it. It is a good thing our hotel had a mini fridge. I got to snack on that for the next few days!  Service was great, the food came out fast. Nothing to complain about at all."
Linda S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/18/2017,"i usually like the cheesecake factory but was not at all satisfied with this one. the service was shoddy and the food was cold. the server asked to validate my parking ticket, but did not do it so i ended up paying for parking too.  when we asked to have fresh fries because they tasted old and they were cold, it seemed to displace the associate. i talked with the manager via email and he apologized and said please come give us a second chance. well i will not be in la again at least till next year some time. thanks i will stick with the one in san fran."
Linda G.,"Piedmont, MO",0,7,6,5.0,6/2/2016,"Amazing place to eat!!  Very busy..however the serve as ""top notch""!!  Can't wait to try the cheesecake I had to get to go!!"
Andrea D.,"Pukekohe, New Zealand",0,5,,5.0,8/29/2017,"Amazing food and service!!!  Had calamari and had enough room for a slice of the peanut butter cheesecake, it was absolutely Devine!!"
Luz S.,"Anaheim, CA",45,1,,4.0,4/13/2017,This Cheesecake Factory was one of the best casual dining I've been to. The hostess was really polite and the servers were really friendly and attentive . Our food was a little late but it was a rush hour and our server make sure we got it right away when it came out. Overall this place was a really good place with GREAT customer service.
Beau G.,"North Tustin, CA",7,34,18,5.0,9/21/2015,"We had over 20 people meet on a Sunday evening or my wife's birthday. Our seats were ready quickly, the waitress (Araka) and staff were amazing. They took great care of the kids and made sure it was a fun enjoyable night. Araka sang and danced at the table for my wife. We all had a great time!  Oh and the food was amazing as well.  Can't stay way from this place!"
Scott R.,"Glendale, CA",4,22,,3.0,3/20/2017,Great service but the food was sub par.  I have eaten at CCF many times but never at this location.  The one in Marina Del Rey and Glendale are much better.
Mrs. T.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",6,178,12,2.0,1/12/2017,"Good service and good cheesecake. 9 out of 10 times, the entrees are totally over salted. My chicken salad sandwich tasted like it had 1/2 cup of salt in it. I couldn't eat it"
Sally T.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,15,19,2.0,7/22/2015,"Is this place a joke or what. NOT WORTH IT. I mean the food here wasn't great at ALL for the prices they charge. Also, who charges for a plaque for your cheesecake ? And ok we bought the plaque , but wtf??? This shit is the ugliest looking plaque ever!! Not only was the food bad, but this cheesecake plaque , just ruin everything.  So. Embarrassing. My 3 year old daughter can write better than this!  I'm giving it a stars because they had our dinner come out within 10mins! ( maybe that's why it tasted so salty and cold)  I'm just happy they gave us our food so we could leave."
Julie P.,"Cerritos, CA",187,204,138,3.0,7/19/2016,"Not great but not bad. I absolutely love their brown bread that they bring out, especially when it's fresh and warm. They have way too many things on their menu. I'm not really a fan of having to flip through twenty pages to figure out what I want to eat. Their food is a little expensive but it's because of their giant portions. I would definitely recommend sharing with someone.  They do have lunch specials if you come during lunch time time, so check that out. Some of the lunch items come in ""lunch portions."" It still ends up being a lot of food. Parking can be validated, so make sure to give your ticket to the server."
Haileigh B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,24,1,5.0,4/1/2017,"This review is for server, Steven. We came here last night with a party of 27 for our rehearsal dinner. I couldn't imagine how tough that would be for one man to pull of but he sure did! Steven was attentive, helpful, very funny and just an over all great server. Our meals came out in a very timely matter and tasted great. He cleared our plates quickly and our waters will always full. I feel often with large parties, you can sense that you are inconveniencing the restaurant staff but we felt nothing but welcomed and taken care of by Steven. Thank you!!!"
Bill P.,"Doyle, CA",30,15,,1.0,3/31/2017,"This is the most screwed up, disorganized goat screw I have ever seen!  Is a 25 minute  wait a little long for 1 piece of cheesecake to go?  I would ask for my money back, but the wait would be even longer!  Do yourself a favor, go to a supermarket, buy one, take it home and defrost it, the service would be quicker!  On top of it all they wanted a tip on a to go order. Stay away, the service sucks!"
