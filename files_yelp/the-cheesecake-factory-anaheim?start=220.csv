Deborah G.,"Oxnard, CA",1,27,1,2.0,4/25/2016,"I am normally a fan of the Cheesecake Factory --having eaten at four or five different establishments more than a dozen times over the years.  This was my only bad experience -- but bad enough to warrant a ""heads up"" to others.   Four of us dined last Friday.  One asked for an omelette dish that included peppers and chorizo.   She asked to have peppers on the side, but it arrived with peppers mixed in.  We mentioned it to our waiter who hesitated.  We didn't want to make a big deal, so we instead asked for a small plate to put the peppers.  It never came.  What's worse, her dinner did NOT have any chorizo.  She was our guest, and she didn't want to complain.  If my husband hadn't noticed her lack of meat at the end of the meal, I wouldn't have realized she basically had eggs for dinner.   My favorite dish is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, so I ordered it. When it arrived, the coconut and rice were dry, almost stale.  The chicken pieces were larger than usual, and a bit rubbery.  There were fewer shrimp than in other places, and the dish could have used two more tablespoons of sauce.  But the creepy part is that there were two rigatoni within.  I couldn't help but wonder how something so foreign got into my food.  Then it hit me that the chicken was not at all like how it usually is in this dish.  Did someone else's leftovers get in my food?   I just stopped eating, but because our table was basically having a reunion, I did not want the unpleasantness of speaking to the manager.  It was not a night for drama.   There are several quality restaurants in the same complex.  We don't live near Anaheim, but for those who do -- you will want to choose one of the other places.   This is not a place I would want to revisit."
Paul B.,"New York, NY",47,159,114,5.0,8/19/2015,"Yes, there are a ton of Cheesecake Factories around America (or the world, I don't know). And they all serve the same food. Blah blah blah chicken madeira. But this one is the best --- due to our waiter Carnell! Our party of 13 got the best service ever and he was Beyoncé-level flawless in his attention, his humor, and charisma. Good god, he is truly the best. You can be only so lucky to be served by this man amongst men. Legendary."
Charlton C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1001,318,330,3.0,4/9/2015,"I haven't been to a cheesecake factory and years and coming here reminds me why.  I came here with my date after watching Furious 7, since it was 10pm on Easter Sunday, many places were already closed. Thankfully there were a few restaurants that were still open so I opted to select Cheesecake factory.  There was little to no wait thankfully because I was starving. As we got seated, I noticed that the booth was dirty; there were still leftover food on the seat that I had to brush off, also the menus were sticky and the silverware was dirty, definitely not off to a good start. Our server came along and she was very pleasant and friendly. Certainly ended up saving the review to be doomed 2 star to 3 so kudos to our waitress.  Since it's been so long since I've eaten here, I hardly remembered the menu and oh boy what a vast menu that they have! Somewhere around 20 pages there is a little bit of everything here which I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. Want tacos? They have it. Want Chinese food? Sure. In the mood for some pasta? It's here. You get my point, it's kinda of insane. To be honest, I was a bit overwhelmed at the choices that finally after looking through the menu a good 2-3 times I finally just opted to get a breakfast omelet with sweet potato fries since breakfast items are my go to choice for when I can't decide on what to get.  When the food arrived, the portions were larger than expected which was a surprise. The omelet was at least the size of two and the sweet potato fries came in a huge bucket. My date couldn't decide either so she ordered the breakfast sandwich which was also huge. The food tasted as it should so no complaints on that end. The only gripe that I had was that the omelet was filled with potatoes and not so much on the meat side.  I only ate about 1/3 of the omelet because I wanted to save room for the cheesecake. We decided to get the key lime cheesecake which was very sour and tarty just the way I liked it.  **Special shout out to our waitress again, she was on point with everything and made the entire experience enjoyable and I wish there were more like her."
Emily Q.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/29/2017,From the moment my family and i sat down the table dishes and silverware were dirty. The silverware had dried leftover food honestly repulsing! We had called over the manager and he seemed not to care along with other workers who seemed unbothered. The food was oily and blain and the breakfast potatoes seemed like they were fried twice. I give an extra star because of our kind waitress.
Phooey L.,"Anaheim, CA",84,61,55,5.0,4/25/2016,This is all for Tyler who was a super server patient friendly personable.  Made sure we had everything took our family photo and even honor my silly request of secretly taking my card to pay for the bill as my family would argue who pay for it. Thanks for the wonderful experience plus the food was really tasty and we beat the crowd. Tyler also validated our parking as we were checking out. Very polite manners and always on a smile on his face! Thank you again!
Rachel N.,"Santa Maria, CA",108,96,8,3.0,4/5/2016,"I'm not much of a Cheesecake Factory eater, but I have to credit my server Solomon who was very attentive to all that I asked for. Gluten free on my request and explaining things to detail. My drinks never went empty and he was great overall. My food was ok, but my service made up for it. Great job!"
Alexander G.,"Honolulu, HI",464,618,3268,4.0,4/27/2015,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory chain for a few years now as I frequent my local restaurant.  The chain offers food for every person- half dishes, huge full meals, pastas, sandwiches, salads, many drinks including locally brewed beers, breakfast, brunch, and of course cheesecake.  I like the full dinners, especially the diverse pasta choices.  The salads are also full meals; huge portions.  I almost always take half home, which they happily pack in microwavable containers.  I love the freshly backed table bread. This Anaheim location is very nice.  Smaller than some I've been to, it has high ceilings and the typical decor.  The indoor seating is very busy and close together, but the high backed booths make the dining experience feel intimate.  Our waitress was wonderful- friendly and very fast despite being busy.  We were seated near the windows and had a nice view of Katella Ave. with it's tall palm trees.  The food was excellent quality, done very well.  It was a great place to have a fun meal talking with the best friends.  Excellent place for tourists to relax and unwind after a long day in Anaheim."
Marvin H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Love the food.i come here alot and they never disappoint me, very good customer service its usually very busy but its worth coming here."
Bonnie S.,"Simi Valley, CA",364,131,47,5.0,10/4/2016,"Bang Bang chicken and Shrimp. Tamarind Cashew sauce on the avocado egg rolls. Best mojitos anywhere, usually. I'm not a fan of corp food but Cheesecake factory is reliable anywhere you go."
Mary P.,"Anaheim, CA",299,291,228,4.0,8/23/2015,I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times. The most recent one was on a Saturday night. It was really crowded because it was a Saturday and there was a fitness expo.  We had a party of 12 and were told that it would take a while but the guy on the front suggested we could just sit at the bar because its first come first serve. That was great because we just got a bunch of tables next to each other.  The service is excellent even though it was crowded and we were sitting at the bar. I'm knocking off one star because the Cuban sand which I ordered was just average.
John S.,"Orange, CA",0,7,2,5.0,4/9/2016,Their Chicken Madeira and Pineapple Moscow Mule pair well together. I couldn't ask for anything more!
Blaine M.,"San Diego, CA",60,26,1,5.0,7/1/2017,We had a party of 8 and the manager went way out of the way to seat us.  It usually would have been like 2 hours (being so close to Disney) but he got us in quickly because we had small children.  Service and food were both excellent.  Thank you!!
Lisa M.,"York, PA",28,11,4,4.0,1/25/2017,"In town for the NAMM show with my husband and we decided to dine here after a day at the Convention. The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for long waits but I must say despite the number of people in town, our wait was not long at all (40 minutes). Our favorites include the spinach and artichoke dip, parmesan romano crusted chicken, and the Thai salmon. The food was delicious and hit the spot."
Zaid K.,"Anaheim, CA",2,2,,2.0,4/17/2016,"Used to be my favorite place , but today i went to Sunday brunch and I sat out side It was sunny and hot and little bit windy  I asked the to open the umbrella for me and they refuse coz the wind may take out the umbrella and i did understand that But after a while i found that 2 of them where open for another ppl ( but no one came to open mine)  I paid then on my wayout i told why they didn't open it for me then they said they will now but it too late, i was on my way out"
Faisal A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",199,99,12,1.0,3/21/2016,"Possibly worst dining experience ever. We were seated rather quickly, but at a dirty table. Our silverware had specks of food, the water had floating oil/grease, and the bread was rock hard. The waiter seemed mad at his job the entire night, yanking the silverware from the table when we asked for new ones. He also left all of the dirty plates and uneaten bread on the table the entire night. There was no room to place a cup but he would try to slide it onto the table, without asking if we wanted anything removed. It was a very crowded, filthy table. Not really what you go out to dinner for.  I don't think I'll ever come back to this particular location, but I may give the chain another shot elsewhere.  I informed a manager of the filthy table and silverware and he didn't seem too concerned. Just said sorry."
James O.,"Anaheim, CA",22,10,1,1.0,8/25/2016,"I am or was a loyal customer/guest at this Cheesecake Factory. when I ordered a hamburger to go well done and when I returned to my home after picking it up I bit into it and it was extremely rare. I called the Resturant to speak to the manager and I got the manager by the name of Mario. I spoke with him and he didn't care about my complaint. I'm in the guest service business and I don't treat my guests with the crappy attitude and service I got. I returned my burger to the Resturant and the manager was once again very rude he had me sit across the lobby and yelled ""Hey hey you come here."" I walked back to the register and collected my order once again. I got home and the burger tasted really bad."
J. J.,"San Diego, CA",3,97,28,4.0,6/19/2016,"Location was so convenient. It was right across the street from our hotel so we walked right over. Looked busy but got seated right when we walked in. (7pm on a Saturday night btw). The service was great and the food ALWAYS amazing.  Tip : when ordering the shrimp scampi and salmon combo make sure you ask for the angel hair pasta with it. When you read the menu it seemed as if you were getting shrimp scampi pasta with salmon and mashed potatoes but you are not. It comes with salmon, mashed potatoes and 3 big pieces of shrimp. When my husband asked about the pasta server says it doesn't come in the combo but was nice enough to bring a small bowl of angel hair pasta for him anyway.   Other than that everything else was good ;)"
Sandra D.,"Bakersfield, CA",15,13,5,2.0,2/25/2016,"My family of four hardly goes out to eat because I've got a 5 and 1 year old so it's a big treat when we do. We were delighted to get to enjoy dinner on a weeknight. We chose a chain restaurant due to convenience for the kids (kids menu, nice bathrooms). My husband had the pasta, I had shrimp scampi & steak, and the kids had corn dogs and chicken tenders. We felt the food and service was good.  That is...UNTIL the next day! My 1 year old threw up the next morning and was on a diet of Pedialyte and bread. We were thinking it was the pasta he shared with his dad or the milk he drank at the restaurant. After my 1 year old felt better, my husband complained of a stomach bug, and he also threw up several times. At this point I'm very sure it was the pasta they ate as it was the only thing different within the last 48 hours that my husband and son consumed. It doesn't end there, my 5 year old complained about being sick a few hours after my husband and on cue vomits everywhere. So 3/4 of us fell violently ill. What a coincidence... I guess I'm the ""lucky"" one who didn't get sick although I got to clean up a bunch of vomit. Gross. Ugh."
Mai T.,"Villa Park, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/14/2017,One of the best experiences we had at this establishment! The service was top notch and the food came out so fast considering how busy they were. Will definitely come back to this location soon!
