Myxa N.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,6,,5.0,6/24/2017,Love Cheesecake Factory in general but this location was especially on point! Always get the avocado eggrolls & Ahi tuna tartare for an appetizer. Crispy chicken costelleta for dinner. Smores Cheesecake is awesome too!
Viv S.,"Corona, CA",9,72,65,5.0,5/12/2015,"This location is by far the best yet! I've patronized it many times, most of which have been for large parties. Girls Nite, Graduation Luncheons, Birthdays, and most recently for a surprise Mother's Day dinner. The service each and every time has been impeccable. Every server has displayed top notch customer service and even with larger parties we have never had an unreasonable wait time. When making the reservation they are very specific with letting us know that after 10 minutes they can no longer hold the extra seats. This has worked out well every time as I usually tell my group 15 minutes earlier to keep us all on point and allow for parking delays. My most recent visit was a surprise for myself and friends. Our husband's hosted a surprise Mother's Day dinner. We dined on the outside patio and the tables were complimented with roses. Simply beautiful! Our main server was Miguel and he was awesome! All the staff was great. Miguel simply stood out because he was so friendly and we loved his accent. He could upsell us anything. Lol!  Since this location is in a busy area surrounded by Disneyland and Angel's Stadium, the traffic is non-stop. Nonetheless once you are seated, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference because the service is prompt and accurate. Can't wait to go back. Oh yeah...my favorite is the Adam's Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. I'm a peanut butter & chocolate kind of girl so this hits the spot every time."
Kristen C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",14,13,135,5.0,8/14/2016,"I would like to express what a positive experience I had at your Anaheim location.   I have patroned several different Cheesecake Factory locations.  Mr. MacArthur provided outstanding customer service.  About a week ago,  I walked in with a party of 17. Mr. MacArthur was extremely helpful in accommodating our large party in a timely manner.   He went over and above in keeping in contact with our group.   He truly provided superior customer service."
Judith S.,"Garden Grove, CA",100,9,1,5.0,9/11/2016,"Matthew C. has helped us twice while visiting and he has been beyond fabulous both times. Extremely attentive and made dinning here a great experience. Thank you for the great service, we look forward to our next visit!"
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3239,810,14322,4.0,1/10/2015,"If you've ever seen the comic strip featuring Garfield, created by Jim Davis, that's one cat that I can definitely relate to. This orange colored feline has personality, with a clear disdain for doing work and Mondays, being lazy, sarcastic, a bit obnoxious, hating diets, along with abusing Odie the dog and his geeky owner Jon. Despite, his faults, he surely has a softer side for his teddy bear Pooky, sleeping, and most of all FOOD. It's no secret that he loves pasta, pizza, and Italian cuisine. Not to mention the occasional house plant. Now the Cheesecake Factory doesn't serve any shrubs or ferns in their salads, but I think Garfield would be a fan of this restaurant chain, including me. The service and vibe of each location can be slightly different, but I've never had any issues at this Anaheim GardenWalk location. Out of all the times I've dined in, I can't remember a bad experience. Like many of you, I can somewhat deal with the issues if the food is to my liking and that's the case here. CHICKEN MADEIRA It's their most popular chicken dish. I get sucked in almost every visit, ordering this specialty item 95% of the time. Sautéed Chicken Breast topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and served with a mound of Mashed Potatoes. I coat the white bread with butter and dip it into the mushroom sauce. It should be illegal to have this much fun. BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA My favorite pasta dish here. Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil Garlic Lemon Cream Sauce. Never a dull moment when I order this. Hearty and fulfilling, it puts a grin on my face, with a garlicky breath that would make any Korean proud. You honestly can't leave here without some form of cheesecake. Defeats the entire purpose of dining at a location where their distinctive feature matches the name of the establishment. My recommendation? The classic Strawberry Cheesecake. Sorry my friends, I don't care to share and neither should you. WORDS TO LIVE BY ""I'm not mad at you, I'm just not dealing with you and your drama anymore.""

Frank D.,"Norwalk, CA",13,4,5,4.0,9/2/2015,"It's my cousin birthday.  Great, let's take him out for dinner!  Where too? Someone suggested The Cheesecake Factory at the Garden Walk.  I was skeptical at first, because we are local and I always though of that place as a tourist trap and expected lousy service.   Boy was a surprised!  Great service from our hostess, waiter and our waiter's assistant.   We had a party of 12 and were seated promptly.   Glasses were topped and everything we requested was brought in a timely manner.  As for the food I ordered the meat loaf and it was awesome.  It was seasoned and cooked properly.  The gravy was on point, as was the succotash that complimented it.  My only complaint was the mashed potatoes.  They were a bit dry and not as creamy.   The portions where large, I should have shared the plate with my son, thus not leaving me any room for desert.  Until next time, I will have to try the cheesecake."
D S.,"Orange, CA",1,96,168,3.0,5/7/2016,"We were there on May 5. The food was good (always is). The service was a bit slow (not surprising, but not a tragedy- this location is always busy). However, somebody needs to service the dishwasher. The silverware was gross. It was spotty, and the forks had little pieces of dried food stuck to them. The spoons were greasy. This is evidence that the dishwasher is not being maintained well. I hope somebody looks into that. Clean silverware is an essential in the restaurant biz, folks. (Photo posted)"
Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",260,1027,1636,4.0,3/19/2015,This is an incredible space. The staff is very helpful and friendly but seating can be an issue especially during the busy weekend. Today I ordered my absolute favorite dish here. The Chinese Chicken Salad is to die for. Its a chopped salad covered in crispy rice noodles packed with chicken and little orange slices. The dressing is absolute heaven. A definite must.
Catherine M.,"CA, CA",16,2,,3.0,6/27/2017,"Food was decent, but caution yourself on ordering a Mojito. There wasn't a price listed on the menu and the drink turned out to be $12.95 a piece! Oops, we had two a piece so the four drinks cost $52! Yes, I can afford to eat out but I don't like the unexpected cost. The drink was 12 ounces at most and loaded with ice. Anyways, the food was still decent"
Mrs S.,"Alpine, CA",0,3,1,4.0,6/16/2016,Nice restaurant. My hubby nd I ordered the Madeira chicken and steak taco plate. The chicken plate was okaythe tacos were delicious. All in all we will return.
Surbhi A.,"Buena Park, CA",17,89,322,5.0,4/7/2016,It was our first time here and I can say that it was fabulous!! I loved the atmosphere. The servers and seating ppl were so kind and super helpful as a new comer. It was great!! The food was wonderful. A bit on the expensive side but I knew that going in there. But the food was sooooo worth it. Delicious to the core!! So flavorful and perfect. The complimentary bread was even good! Loved it. Would definitely want to go again
Javier H.,"Anaheim, CA",6,9,,1.0,2/15/2016,"So we had the best waiting staff ever, she was absolutely polite, easy going and attentive to our every need. My 1 star review is for the kitchen, food and management.  - I happen to order the easiest plate on their 10 page menu which was spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatballs (lunch portion), easy right????! Wrong!!!  -On the first attempt I get cold tomato sauce over my 4 meatballs so I kindly asked that it be put under the broiler for a few minutes to be heated up, they take it upon themselves to redo my order.  -On the second attempt they bring out the lunch portion of my dish with only 1 meatball, so I kindly ask the server that I had ordered extra meatballs, again they chose to take my plate and make it again. -On the third attempt I get what I ordered, hot  spaghetti and 4 meatballs. So I dig in, the noodles and sauce are spot on, I cut into the meatball and it's as if I ordered ground beef tartare, medium rare on a meatball is not desirable or appetizing. So I kindly tell my waitress my problem and ask that my order gets canceled. -Management made no attempt to rectify or compensate me for this health hazard and for the fact that I ended up not eating because I don't like raw ground beef, all I got was a ""we are very sorry"" and walked away. I am sorry I didn't bring a party of 8 to your establishment to get a sorry when you can't get spaghetti and meatballs right. For a few dollars more I will take my money, guest and any future gatherings to Roy's Hawaiian Fusion right next door."
Diana F.,"La Puente, CA",7,13,,5.0,5/5/2017,Love coming here! Had Mindy serve us today and she was awesome! Always made sure we were well with our drinks/food and really quick!
Anthony K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,26,14,5.0,8/23/2015,I visited on a beautiful Sunday evening.  It was busy but efficiently  organized.   I was seated in under 2 minutes! I went to the bar to order a drink and was instantly attended to. Sat back down and our waitress took our order quickly.  I was impressed.
Cassidy J.,"Orange, CA",161,327,573,3.0,5/23/2015,"Came right when it opened so we were seated right away. Our waiter treated us like he was a little too busy for us. He would ask how things were while he was passing by, not even giving us enough time to respond.  The food was good. Brown bread always kills it. Then we had a shrimp pasta and it was good. I mean ratio of pasta to shrimp/chicken was a little weak.  I also had the chicken and mushroom wraps which were very good  Besides being treated like we weren't real customers, it was pretty good."
Anne D.,"San Diego, CA",39,51,91,5.0,6/25/2016,"For a packed Saturday evening I was surprised we only had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. What 'made our dining experience so enjoyable was our impeccable server, Steven. He was extremely attentive & genuinely nice. Now onto the food -- yummy fried zucchini, cheese pizza and delectable chicken piccata."
Alicia H.,"Santa Ana, CA",904,106,153,3.0,12/16/2014,"I've visited this Cheesecake factory locations quite a few times already. More recently, I went around 6pm and didnt need to wait long for a booth. Cheesecake factory definitely has nice ambiance but theres something about it that still errks me. Ah ha! It's the service and the servers. They don't smile much and they're always too much in a rush to stop and see you tryna flag them down. At least at this location. They're not as attentive and cordial as I would like. So I ordered the Steak Diane + Shrimp Scampi combo for about $20. This came with 3 measly pieces of big fried shrimp and a few small pieces of steak topped with onion and mushroom. The sauce it was marinated in was too sweet and oily. It just didn't really appeal to me and wasn't as good as I thought it would be for that price! My friend ordered the Kobe burger which came with a tiny basket of fries. Being a frequent eater of Kobe, my friend could tell immediately that they had not served him kobe. Our server called upon some random girl, not even dressed or looking like she worked there who came out to talk to us about the burger. She kindly agreed to re-make the burger (which I thought was the right move and good customer service) and they quickly brought out another. This time according to my friend, was in fact real kobe. My friend enjoyed the burger and I thought my plate was so so.  I also had 2 glasses of Merlot, 14 hands for $9/glass - now that I think about it I should have just ordered a bottle with that money. My friend ordered 3 Blue Moons and we shared a Pina Colada at the end. The bill came out to $95. This felt very overpriced or maybe it's just inflation. Overall, the quality of the food was just okay and our server wasn't very friendly at all. She hardly checked on us and if it weren't for the lady who came out and re-made our burger, we would have left feeling disappointed. Honestly, the only thing nice about this place is the lighting. Even the water mugs that appear to be glass but aren't, aren't pretty, they're dingy and plastic."
J T.,"Fullerton, CA",11,501,49,4.0,3/21/2016,This location was great. The wait was minimal which is unusual because most Cheesecake Factory restaurants are always packed. We were seated outside on a warm sunny afternoon which was so nice. Our waiter recommended the Thai Lettuce Wrap which was amazing. I will order this item every time.  The only bad thing is the parking. You have to make a long trek to the restaurant after parking in the parking structure.
Andrea R.,"Orange, CA",854,205,778,3.0,11/4/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is huge in size, big in portions, but dwindles in service. For such an upper class restaurant in the Disneyland area, they are just decent.  SERVICE: Everytime I've been here the hostesses always seem to be very annoyed and distant when guest come up. I understand that huge crowds swarm in sometimes but the various of times that I've visited this location, they still seem to be the exact same. The waiters are a step up thankfully. I appriciate that they are usually friendly and helpful when under the pressure of so many tables to balance. FOOD:  I love that while browsing through the menu, fresh bread is served to seated guest! -Shrimp Pasta: Obviously different pasta plates use different noodles, but the spaghetti type noodles they use for this dish is a little hard. Luckily the more chewy, easy to bite toppings such as the shrimp and fried fish pieces balance out the texture making it a decent choice.  -Fettuccine Alfredo: is quite a deliciously filling dish! The noodles are cooked to perfection and the Alfredo sauce was pleasing! I highly recommend this choice! -Burgers: are huge and the meat is tender! A little over priced but satisfying and big enough to be worth it! RECOMMENDED Cakes/Cheesecakes: -Triple Chocolate Cake   -Banana Cream Pie Cheesecake -Snickers Cheesecake  -Original Cheesecake If you're wanting a better experience and to get dinner, then I recommend the Cheesecake Factory in Brea, Westminster, and Irvine! This specific Cheesecake Factory isn't my favorite but it's good enough to stop by for dessert."
Albert N.,"Beaverton, OR",0,32,,4.0,5/26/2017,"There is nothing special about this, a typical Cheesecake Factory but given the location and comparable options in the area, it is a great option for those on a Disney vacation.  I ended up eating here 3 times on a recent week long trip and enjoyed it.   I had the caeser salad's and salmon.  It is easy to find parking and in particular is a great option to do takeout from nearby hotels.  I would recommend strongly for those down on vacation at Disney."
