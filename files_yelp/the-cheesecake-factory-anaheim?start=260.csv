Tabitha R.,"Norwalk, CA",4,29,93,3.0,7/3/2015,Avocado Rolls 5 star  & 3 star for Chicken & Biscuit with Broccoli & Asparagus used to be good but it was a disappointment today. They changed the way they do it now :( I don't care for the cheesecakes
Alex L.,"Sacramento, CA",4957,1547,3392,3.0,10/23/2015,"I'm never enthusiastic about eating at the Cheesecake Factory and this latest experience spells out why. Beyond cheesecake, I've never had a meal here that lived up to the price or the basic level of experience they guarantee.  In an effort to kill time and simultaneously fill my grumbling belly, I ate lunch here while staying at a nearby hotel. It was a slow Tuesday and one of the rare times I've been here where there wasn't a huge crowd. I sat at the bar. The bartender was a nice guy, chatting me up about my travels and making his personal recommendations. The unfortunate part was the meal itself. I ordered the ""spicy"" crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either a chipotle sauce or a buffalo sauce. I ordered the buffalo sauce. After an unusually long wait for the sandwich considering I was one of the few people there, it came out with the chipotle sauce on the side and no buffalo sauce on the chicken, as I was told there was. I asked for a side of buffalo sauce and was told the manager would bring it out. He did without a word. It would have been courteous to get an apology at the least for the mixup, but at that point satisfying my hunger was the top priority. The chicken and salad were pretty tasty, despite the lack of sauce.  The Cheesecake Factory is great for their namesake or a couple drinks at the bar. Unfortunately the dining experience is rarely equivalent."
Silvia D.,"Santa Ana, CA",69,200,46,4.0,11/26/2014,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place... Especially since this is one my my favorite restaurants. My absolute favorite thing to get is the fried Mac and cheese. This is an appetizer, but because they are pretty big, I just order this with the stuffed mushrooms.  I've also ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta. It comes with shrimp and chicken, but I always order it with just the shrimp, no chicken.  This fish is ok, but maybe a little bland.  I also just recently came in for their brunch. I ordered the chillaquiles. They weren't that great... I don't I'll be back here for brunch.  Get also make really good drinks here.  The only downer about this place, is that it's so close to Disneyland, and it's is almost always busy."
Armando C.,"Camp Lejeune, NC",3,46,27,3.0,3/8/2015,The only reason I'm not giving one star is of course the cheesecakes are still bomb and my long island was pretty good. What was a real let down was the filet mignon! PLEASE DON'T EVER ORDER IT! First off my wife ordered well done and it came literally bleeding. Mine was done right but it was cold! Definitely not worth $30 a steak! Never eating steak here. I'm better off just ordering the fish tacos!  P.s. the appetizer bread was cold and hard!
Benny P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,7,,2.0,1/28/2017,Well I just wanted to say my food was great the person who brought my food was awesome but our server Jose L was very unprofessional he took a very long time bringing our drinks out I asked him for a refil he asked for the same cup I was using brought it back with the same ice and watered down with no straw asked if he can get me a box and gave me attitude I honestly gave this man a 4.00$ tip and I don't even believe he deserved that I'm not saying fire the guy but please retrain him ASAP
Vanessa C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,12,19,4.0,1/28/2016,"This was my first time eating here and I was amazed with the place itself and the service. It was beautiful and you literally get what you pay for. I strongly recommend the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, its heaven on earth"
Paul G.,"Santa Ana, CA",695,456,2499,4.0,3/13/2015,"On a diet and at Cheesecake Factory?  No worries, they have a healthy menu that aims to please.  Tried their various chicken lettuce wraps with multiple sauces; they are not only satisfying, but have great presentation."
Trish S.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",4971,824,2942,4.0,10/7/2014,"Gotta give this CF some Yelp star props for it's super nice servers!  We entered exhausted post Yelper party about a half an hour before closing and they gladly seated us-not a snide eye in the place.  We were served our selections from the outta control huge menu with a pleasant smile and smart recommendations. Everything was yum and timely.  We've all been to Cheesecake Factory probably, but here's a cool little fact-apparently foreigners and tourists have this on their must try list while in America. It's got some sort of international fame in Asian and Australia. Although of course, I'm a big advocate of local small business, I'm still glad that those visitors are getting excellent customer service at this location."
Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4917,964,1518,5.0,10/3/2014,"This place earns five sexy stars on service alone and if I would have paid the bill I'd shout out the name of our server. What I do know about her is that she's moving to Portland and this particular location should certainly be bummed to see her leave. Good luck to you, young lady! You see, I rolled in with a group of four at 10:50 pm, which was ten minutes before closing. I know, I know, bad guests! We had just worked a Yelp event for 1,000 people down the street and eating here was our only option. I smiled and asked our server not to hate us and she responded back with a genuine sense of understanding and encouragement that we were no hassle at all. Regardless, we'd be quick. We ordered a quick round of drinks, some of their famous avocado egg rolls and I got the jambalaya served over a bed of linguini with shrimp and chicken. Everything came out quickly and was piping hot! The chicken was tender, the shrimp were cooked a perfect shade of pink and the veggies were slightly al dente - delicious! The portion sizes were enormous and I for one felt like I didn't even dent my plate, even thinking that I was on the verge of death by hunger.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes, took the short walk back to our hotel and put our tired feet and stuffed bellies to rest for the night. Thanks for the grub and give our sweet server a little raise before she takes off for the PNW!"
H W.,"Markham, Canada",0,4,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Just had the supposedly ""ultimate red velvet cheesecake"" which was supposed to have white chocolate and red velvet cake. Well, after trying it out tonight, the white chocolate was not white chocolate but an artificial mixture that tasted BLAND and the red velvet was bitter and tasteless too. The manager was not aware that the description of this cheesecake was supposed to have (white) chocolate. Furthermore, one cup of black coffee costs $3.50 and the cheesecake cost $7.95. So, do the math: Coffee is charged 44% of the cost of the cheesecake. Coffee makes more money than the cheesecake for this company.  SKIP THE COFFEE!! Two cups of coffee will buy you another cheesecake! The Katella Street restaurant in Anaheim, California does not care about customer experience. Stay Away!"
Coreen A.,"Anaheim, CA",121,2,,2.0,7/24/2016,I'm genuinely a nice critic when it comes to service at restaurants because I was a waitress and I know how it is but our server and everyone on tonight's team were not helpful and didn't have any customer service. I unfortunately left our server Dylan F nothing but written advice to smile instead of frown on the back of the receipt with no tip. We were expecting the great service we always get but tonight left a bad taste in my mouth.
Heather C.,"Sparks, NV",24,15,1,1.0,10/12/2014,"Run. Run away.  We decided in the Cheesecake Factory after a long day at Disneyland. A reliable, familiar restraint that we could all agree on. They close at 11pm. Not wanting to be the jerks that come in right at closing time we called in our order at 10:15. We walked there from the park and waited for another 10 minutes after the estimated time they had given. When we got back to the hotel we all dove in. I don't remember ordering a raw burger but that is what we received. Not rare. Raw. Like they walked it through a warm room. I feel like if a burger is $13.50 it should be cooked. Just a thought."
Carla L.,"Taft, CA",32,6,5,2.0,11/5/2016,"My dinner was okay, I ordered my steak median rare and it was served well done. When I asked the waitress about it she had an excuse about the size of the medallions. No 'I'm sorry' just excuses. When she refilled my teas she gave me the wrong type, again when brought to her attention there was 'no sorry'. I understand mistakes happen but an 'I'm sorry' goes a long way. Our ticket arrived for our party all on one tab when I clearly asked for them to be split at the beginning of the meal. Sadly disappointed in the whole experience."
Jessica B.,"Modesto, CA",108,1,,4.0,8/2/2016,"I was a little turned off by Cheesecake Factory because I went with friends while visiting Nashville and our server was literally the rudest server I have ever had.  Today, that was all changed.  Our server, Carnell, was nothing short of delightful.  He was so welcoming even though we were sitting in the bar with kids and didn't drink alcohol. He was extremely knowledgeable in regards to the menu and knew ingredients to all the entrees we ordered.  He treated my 14 year old son and 9 year old daughter like real human beings instead of like bothersome kids.  He even made small talk with my son.  The food was awesome and out to the table quick.  Thanks for the awesome experience."
Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,946,1535,2.0,10/9/2014,"I had not been to Cheesecake Factory for many years, but family from out-of-town wanted to go for dinner. This chain restaurant has not been known to accept reservations, and the wait time is typically long to secure a table during dinner service. However, there were many open tables during this visit and there was no wait time - great!  Unfortunately, this was the only real positive of the evening. Service from our wait staff was just ok and a little condescending. After having ordered, it took a very long time to get our drinks. Food took a while to arrive as well, and entrees were served staggered, so that a few got their food well before others. Although food portions were large, the quality and taste were just mediocre . This had been my experience from years past and, sadly, the same holds true today. The gigantic menu (nearly 20 pages) and overwhelming choices probably hinder a job well done. As well, prices are a bit high (although it might be, in part, due to close proximity to Disneyland).  I like a variety of food joints, from inexpensive, hole-in-the-wall type places to fine dining restaurants. Even cheap places can produce great tasting food. I think this chain can and should do better."
Kim G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,26,16,5.0,9/28/2016,Service and Drinks are both great. Cajun Jambalaya is my favorite and of course their red velvet cheesecake is delicious.
Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,4.0,10/19/2014,"My brother and friends were visiting Disneyland and invited me to drive up to join them for lunch at this Cheesecake Factory. A little concerned about parking availability, I did just a bit of research and discovered there's a huge parking garage just a few doors down right next to Bubba Gumps, so I was relieved. I arrived at the garage at 12 noon and there was plenty of parking. First 60 minutes are free, then it's about $6 for the hour after, etc. However, if you validate at one of the restaurants here, I believe you get an additional 3 free hours .....or something like that....yay! Just a short walk from the garage we arrive at the front door of the Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much the same setup as all the other Cheesecake Factories I'd been to in the US. The nice and friendly hostess at the podium greeted us as we entered....and immediately sat us as the place wasn't crowded at all.....and no line waiting for a table....all the other CFs I'd been too were packed with at least a 10-20 minute wait. I'm actually pretty surprised, but I guess everybody was busy at the park. What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food here. Pretty much the same as any other CF.....very extensive and one can easily be overwhelmed with all the yummy choices! SO it's good if you're a regular and know pretty much what there is and what you're going to order.  The server (Alana) I think was so totally friendly, helpful, and attentive throughout. Always checking on us to make sure we were happy and whether we needed anything. In fact, one of our friends had some ankle problem and made a request for a bag of ice to ice it down.....and Alana was more than happy to do this for him! Knowing how huge the portions of the Entrees are here, we knew we could never finish. So, we went ahead and did a shared style lunch where we'd order an appetizer (Chicken Samosas) to start off, and then each of us would order a ""small plate"" dish...........Avacado Eggrolls, Factory Chopped Salad, and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas......the Grilled Corn Cakes that came with the tortillas were really delicious! But pretty much everything was good as expected. At the end of it all, Alana asked if we would like any dessert? Eeeer, no....we were stuffed and all that sugar at lunch really can't be good for you :S In fact, Alana told us that although a few people actually ordered cheesecakes to eat as their dessert, most people would order the huge slices to go. By 1pm this place was pretty full, but not packed, and I still didn't see any lines out the door....which was quite a surprise."
Jose F.,"Houston, TX",523,257,668,3.0,9/17/2015,"Stopped in before a Luis Miguel concert at the Honda center. Had a good time. Drinks I ordered whiskey sours, appetizers mac n cheese balls (really good), entrée I tried the Chicken and Biscuits. Sautéed Chicken Breasts Covered with a Rich Pan Gravy, Served with Mashed Potatoes, Mushrooms, Vegetables and Buttermilk Biscuits. It sounds delicious.......IT WASN'T such a let down I am a huge southern food LOVER. Gravy was watery, Chicken was bland. The biscuits were good. Great service. They did take a long while to bring out our beers for some reason, which is funny since I was seated at the bar and the bartenders were not occupied. I dunno. Overall had a good night here."
M B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,46,3,3.0,3/22/2017,"I generally love Cheesecake Factory, and it is a good go to because the food quality is usually very good and the menu is so big there is always something for everyone.  However, if I have to compare this to my other experiences with Cheesecake Factories I've been to (including the Redondo Beach location which is AMAZING!) then this one in Anaheim just wasn't up to par.  The wait staff was OK, but not fantastic.  They totally misunderstood my husband and got the order of his side items all wrong.  The food taste was just not as good as the other locations (the chef really does matter).  The food quality was good, but my husband's steak was unusually tough for a new york steak.  All in all not a bad experience, but I've had better from this chain."
Sally M.,"Holbrook, NY",13,10,,4.0,9/20/2016,"We went pretty late in the evening, but were seated very quickly despite looking very full. The restaurant is well kept and has a nice atmosphere. The staff, especially our waiter, was very nice and attentive. We got the orange chicken with brown rice which was delicious! We also got the Asian lettuce tacos and greek salad which were good, nothing exceptional.  Dessert was Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake, which was amazing! Very dense so we were struggling to finish it between the two of us, but definitely worth the food coma that came afterwards :)"
