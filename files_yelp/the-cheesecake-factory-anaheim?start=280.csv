We got up and left thanks for a great dinner not!!
Janis M.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,7,,1.0,10/18/2015,"I've eaten at other Cheesecake Factories before,  but this one was very disappointing. We ordered takeout, a salad and I ordered white chicken chili that was $13.95. My chili consisted of about 1 cup of liquid, 10 beans, and 8 pieces of chicken! And it was cold on top of that! We were in a hotel and didn't have a microwave so I ate 1 cup of cold chili."
Katrina N.,"Irvine, CA",91,390,1861,2.0,8/4/2014,"**This review is for Take-Out only I figured since it was national cheesecake day, come in and get half off their selection of delicious cheesecake.  However, the restriction being for take-out is only 1 order of cheese cake/entree =( Boooo.  So I narrowed my choice down to Wild Blueberry White Choco cheese cake.  I also phoned in for the Grilled Pork Chop. So being that this was the Anaheim location, it was packed for a 6pm on a Thursday.  I dodged and weaved my way to pick up my food and left.   So the food?  NO BUENO!! I give the pork chop a solid 2 stars, it was that bad.  The reason being is that for a $20 dish, I got some dry ass, bland, and the most ordinary dish I've ever tasted.  The sides were spinach and some alright mashed po's.  The pork chop was so pathetic though that even the meat near the bones were dry.  Usually meat that are near the bones are moist because of the fattiness, but these were also dry.   The cheese cake though was the star of the show.  I'm so glad I got it half off though, I don't think I would buy a slice of cheese cake full price."
Brandy B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,94,202,1.0,1/21/2016,Horrible. Will not be eating here again. I used to love coming here but last time I got the pizza salad lunch combo (which was always my go to) and it was awful! The pizza tasted almost chemically and the salad tasted like dirt. It used to be so yummy. Huge bummer that this place has gone down hill and no longer pays attention to the quality of their food.
Vanessa G.,"El Paso, TX",2,5,1,5.0,9/17/2015,"Came here on a Wednesday night. Me and another guest were hungry and, since we're in the area, opted to visit this place for a late night dinner. We showed up around 9:00 pm and the place was packed. Since we were only a party of two, however, the wait was only ten minutes since we were willing to sit outside if necessary, which is exactly what we ended up doing.  I'm glad we did sit outside. It was a cool night and it was much quieter outside than in. We were promptly attended to by Jared. Upon request, he suggested a rather delicious full-body wine (i wish I could remember the name). I ordered the Chicken Madeira. It was a generous helping of chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was tender, not at all dry. I was not able to finish my dish so Jared kindly packaged up the remainder to go. I then ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake which as always was delicious. I left with a full and happy stomach. The customer service was great (thank you Jared), food was delicious and came out quickly, and the atmosphere was relaxing. This was a great way to end a night."
Eric K.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/1/2016,Bad experience on bistro pasta with hair. They didn't charge the dish. Thank you so much.
Benjamin R.,"Anaheim, CA",91,32,21,4.0,7/4/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is my families' favorite restaurant. Disneyland is our favorite place to visit. With the two so close together, we are one happy family! It's become our tradition to visit The Cheesecake Factory on Katella at least once during our trips to Disneyland. It's a great start to our vacation, as we anticipate spending the next day at the parks. On a recent trip, we left Disneyland midday and walked over for lunch. Although the restaurant was busy, it was a nice break from the frantic atmosphere of the parks. The food was as good as ever. My son loves the wheat bread in the bread basket and would make a meal of it if he could. My favorite meal is the  avocado egg rolls . On this visit for lunch, I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I also love. We like the variety offered on the menu and everyone always finds something amazing to eat. The service was good, as usual.  We have also found that this is a good location for meeting friends who live in the So. Cal. area. We can walk from Disneyland-area, and our friends can get there easily and use the parking garage. We say, ""Meet us at The Cheesecake Factory"" and everyone is game! The last time we came here, we randomly chose to visit this restaurant about 6 pm one night. We walked in and we're given a table immediately on the patio. The menu was huge, refillable soda drinks extremely good value. The orange chicken was delightful and all other items were enjoyed by family. The complimentary bread was very tasty. Miso salmon is always a fabulous dish here. We took cheesecakes to go and ate them for a few days afterwards. This was the meal that kept on giving. By the time we left just after 7 pm there were queues on the footpath of people wanting to get in."
Lauren V.,"Garden Grove, CA",159,1,1,5.0,7/29/2016,"So I got lunch to go today and I was helped by Lorena , I got back to work and realized my cheesecake was missing , I called and Lorena went out of her way to bring it to me at work she  is the best I hope she Read's this she's the real MVP !!! Not only that she gave me a extra piece on her !! Thank you so much !"
Eyad A.,"Fullerton, CA",16,29,53,4.0,11/21/2015,"Went here earlier today for lunch, it was great, but I had ordered just too much. I should really start cutting down to lunch portions or possibly try eating half portions only, but it's normally hard to stop once started...  I had the chicken Madeira which was different than the norm, idk maybe I was just really hungry or just haven't had it in a while.. it was freakin awesome! Overall everything else was great.  P.s; if you don't want to eat alone, and are willing to treat, hit me up!"
Sarah K.,"Orange County, CA",165,520,102,4.0,9/23/2014,"Fresh strawberry cheesecake and the oreo dream cheesecake were just way too good and sweet. These two are going to be definitely be my ""go-to"" cheesecakes.  There is a skinnylicious menu, which I found more items to my liking than the original menu. The lettuce wrap tacos in two styles: asian and mexican were so fresh and filled with yummy flavors. One order of each would get you three wraps for a little less than $7.00. It's not so filling, so it's perfect as an appetizer.  The fresh salmon with the vegetables were cooked well and loved the variety of vegetables it came with including carrots, asparagus, green beans, and more."
Alma L.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,165,39,2.0,8/12/2014,"OOOO... 2 star. Yes cheesecake factory, you only have a few stars because your waiter service is good and I love your cheesecake, BUTTT your food is raw and over priced.  I ordered a four cheese pasta, $18 so I was expecting it to be the real deal. I was wrong, it had absolutely no desirable taste and the pasta was still sort of raw. I think $13 or so is reasonable for this meal as other yelpers state. My boyfriend order a turkey burger, not as pricey, but meat was gross. According to him he's had better at whole in the wall joints.  The waitress Britney was super nice though, so some kudos to her :) Ordered a Banana cheesecake at the end which was delicious! I will only come here for dessert and that's about it!"
Norman B.,"Irvine, CA",1,10,12,5.0,8/23/2015,Always have a great time . Great menu selection and outside patio for the whole family to enjoy .
Bota A.,"Irvine, CA",32,57,90,5.0,7/11/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory by far has the best service compared to the ones in spectrum Irvine and the Huntigton Beach.  The server explained all the special of the day in-depth and was really nice. She checked our tables several times to see if we needed anything. (In irvine- server takes order, brings the drinks, other servers bring out the food, we finish eating, no sign of our server, after 10 mins waiting she comes and hands our check-literally that's all she did- the last 3 times).  I always order exact same things: -Blueberry Mojito - so refreshing and you don't taste much of a strong bacardi, the combination is just perfect. - Luau salad - it's filled with greens, chicken, nut, and crispy large tortilla like thing- so yummy, 1 order will feed 4 people, trust me!  - Combo-: chicken madeira and steak diane (well done) comes with mushroom madeira sauce, mashed potato and asparagus (it's on page 14!!!) -i just can't enough of these, really good stuff.  Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated!  The wait might be long depending on the hours you go."
Lisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",378,57,90,3.0,8/22/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory, 3 times this week, and sadly each time I came they did nothing spectacular for me to give them anything more than 3 stars... and I even think 3 stars is me being nice but the second time I came here this week, they gave me great service. The first day I went here, I came at night with a large party celebrating a birthday. I have never been to this Cheesecake Factory because my go-to one is the Brea one. However, when I came with this party we were seated outside and the waitress, Melissa S, was very accommodating to our growing party. Melissa, was a good server. She was able to split all of our checks (12) easily without a hitch. She took our orders in a quick and friendly manner and she was even very keen on offering us a dessert to eat after she came out to surprise our two birthday girls.  The only downside I must say I had with Melissa was the attitude she kind of gave me at the end of the night, when it came to me asking for my Cheesecake to-go. I had ordered a Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake with the strawberries on the side, however, when I got my cheesecake, the strawberries were clearly on it, and syrup as well. I ended up telling Melissa that I had wanted the strawberries completely separate from the cheesecake because the person I was getting it for wasn't going to eat the cheesecake that night and didn't want the cheesecake to be saturated with the syrup and get soggy. She ended up showing her annoyance by giving me a long stare, then a little sigh as she said she'd fix it for me. When she came back with my ""newly fixed cheesecake"" all she simply did was remove the three strawberries and place it in a separate large container and give me back the already saturated in strawberry syrup cheesecake I clearly said I didn't want. Her attitude she gave me at the end was clearly seen by those sitting around me and they even mentioned her hostility to me. Aside from Melissa's downfall in service, the food here did not taste as great as other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to. The Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp was extremely salty. I drank a good amount of water after each bite because of how much salt they used in the pasta. It was like the entire ocean's salt was in this dish. Others around me ordered pasta as well and had mentioned that their dishes were really salty so we concluded that it must have been the pasta water that was too salty.  When it came down to the pasta sauce, this one seemed like it was missing flavor because I felt like all I was tasting were tomatoes and nothing else. The portions however were out of this world large. I barely scratched the mountain of pasta I got. I don't think I would order this dish again at this restaurant due to how salty the dish was overall. When I came back here the next night, I came simply just to get a order of cheesecake to-go and the person who had helped me and my date out, was so kind. I definitely recommend getting it to-go because as busy as it was at night when we had ordered our cheesecakes, we got it in less than 5 minutes. Amazing.  Yesterday, was the third day I came and I simply came to get cheesecake but instead of to-go, my friend and I decided to dine in. The wait to get a table was very quick. However our server, Carnell M, took a very long time to attend to us. We waited what seemed like 20 minutes before he took our order. It was a simple order no doubt but it is a bit ridiculous to wait that long. Our stuff came out in about 15-20 minutes. He came to check up on us once, and that was about it. His personality was an A+. He was funny, easy going, laughing, smiling and just all around had a great and friendly personality.  The only thing that irritates me the most is when a server hoovers over me when I am still looking at the receipt because they are so eager to get their money. And this is what he was doing to me. Carnell was pretty much was so keen on getting our check and pretty much would come back to grab that black book, even when I was clearly still reading the receipt. Once we were done paying and we stood up to leave, he came so quick to get the book. No thank you, no have a nice night, nothing. Just grabbed our money and left.  For the most part, this Cheesecake Factory has it's ups and it's downs but I want to say it has more downs than ups. All I know is that I think I will only order cheesecake to go at this one or just go to my usual Cheesecake Factory in Brea or the one at the Grove in LA, they obviously know how to be a bit more hospitable than this one does."
Myeisha D.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,5,1,3.0,2/29/2016,Went here for the first time with the husband and kids and thought the food was a bit over priced and average at best. However the cheesecake is to die for. I probably won't go back for the food but I will be back for another slice of cheesecake.
Alexa M.,"Lakewood, CA",51,6,4,5.0,5/21/2016,"My boyfriend and I always come to this Cheesecake Factory even though there's one about 5 minutes from home haha. Everyone here is super helpful and friendly! It does tend to get a bit packed at night, but the food always makes up for the 20-30 minute wait."
Stacy K.,"Sacramento, CA",95,19,3,2.0,8/9/2016,"First visit to this particular one, we asked for a top shelf margarita, the first one did not taste good so we sent it back only to get the next one, it was smaller, and still did not taste good. Server didn't come by the table but maybe three times, not to see how things were or to ensure we had what we needed. Which we didn't have napkins or knifes. I will say the I had the veggie melt and it was very good, and when our waiter did come around he was very polite. The bad margaritas are not his fault, but they need a new bartender who cares about the quality product they provide."
Elizabeth M.,"Adger, AL",84,5,,5.0,9/7/2016,"The Cheese Cake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants ever, but this visit was especially awesome!  Jesse took great care of us, he was professional, friendly, courteous, and expedient even though he had many other tables! Our food was fantastic and came out in a very timely manner! All around the visit was the best I've ever had at the Cheese Came Factory! Thanks for the awesome service, Jesse!"
Michelle I.,"Cypress, CA",68,46,80,4.0,1/8/2016,"Went here at low peak time around 2:00, no wait at all.  Got the usual Bang Bang Chicken which is great as usual.  We also got the avocado, zucchini fries and portabella. It was good except the avocado is mushy, the garlic aioli and chipotle sauce was really good."
Noel F.,"Orange, CA",54,60,397,5.0,8/27/2015,This place is way chill. The steak was made just right and our bartender was real nice dude and very helpful when it came to drink or beer selections...
