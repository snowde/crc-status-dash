Thelma A.,"Fairfield, CA",3,30,35,4.0,9/16/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory offers something for everyone on the menu. The entrees are always presented very well not mention delicious. The ambiance is nice, services are always on point.  I will highly recommend this place as one to experience. Was here on Saturday night 9/13"
鬼妹Hellokitty H.,"Ventura, CA",5,87,13,5.0,5/25/2016,I have to stop in when im in town for disney. The santa fe salad is one of my favorites the salad is big enough for more then one person. At most the wait time could be around 15-20 min. not too bad. Margaritas YUM!
Ernest G.,"Wailuku, HI",94,67,173,5.0,6/11/2016,"Like usual, very busy so come early. This is one of my favorite restaurants like everyone favorite else. I ordered the ribeye, which is an 8oz. Wifey ordered the Diana Steak with the crusted salmon. We had a party of 11 and they made room for us with a wait time of less than 30 minutes!"
Jan C.,"Irvine, CA",694,175,94,4.0,5/10/2015,"I visited the cheesecake factory in Anaheim as a default restaurant for mothers day.  Any other day we would not have waited an hour,but everyone else was a 3 hour wait.  The server was very pleasant and he took his time even thought it was very busy.  The food was good I got a 4 cheese pasta which was a huge portion.  The free wheat bread was amazing and the banana cheesecake was great.  I don't know what it is with the cheesecake factory but I never get that feeling of wanting to come back it's not memorable.  I guess it's because they don't have any signature dishes only the cheesecake."
Nora G.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,2,,5.0,7/23/2016,This is my first experience at this restaurant and it was great. Our server Brittney was wonderful. She helped us out with the menu and gave suggestions on items she thought we would like. She went above and beyond our expectations.
Rolly U.,"Las Vegas, NV",244,287,2773,1.0,5/7/2014,We ate dinner around 8pm. Table of 10 took about a 1 hour wait and after walking all day at Disneyland we just wanted to eat and leave.  I was so excited to eat my sundries tomato chicken fed cause I always order it when I come to cheesecake. Ahhhhh it was sooooooo oily and it didn't taste like how I normally get it. Told my server and order a chicken salad instead (but had no chicken inside of it) I was just to tired to tell my server so I just ate bread and feel asleep at the table.
Christine Z.,"Indio, CA",0,5,3,2.0,8/11/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times, however, I've never been to THIS Cheesecake Factory.  We got there around 8pm so I wasn't surprised to see a big crowd of people. The wait for 4 people was only 20 minutes so we decided to wait, and sure enough we only waited a small amount of time.  Right when we were seated our drink orders were taken, which was really good. After that we were served the usual bread and butter. Those seemed to be the highlights of this dining experience. We were ready to order but no one would even come to our table, but instead stopped at the ones around us. When we finally ordered, the wait took SO long. All we ate was bread, bread, butter, and more bread.  I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were good, but had a kind of sweet flavor. I'm not quiet sure what it was but I dont think I'll be ordering it again. I found my self finishing the bread and asking for various to go boxes since it was late by the time we got our food. When we asked for the boxes, the waiter took or plates to I guess put it in the boxes. We told him we only wanted the Kids Mac and Cheese wrapped up, and were confused when he brought is three boxes. We checked to see what was inside the two boxes, in one was one small lettuce taco that my friend had left and the other had only the contents of what had fallen on to my plate from my taco, no actual taco. Overall, I've had a better experience at other Cheesecake Factories. The water was good. Hope you have a better experience!"
Kelsey C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,3,1.0,8/12/2016,"Seriously had an awful experience here yesterday. Before I write this just know that my boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry so we can tell if a server is actually busy or just being lazy. This was plain laziness.  We were promptly seated and our waiter took about ten minutes to get over to our table. We ordered alcoholic drinks. We were brought water without asking for it (which was really nice to be honest)! He dropped them off and went over to his other tables (he was being very friendly and attentive to them but for some reason not to us) and finally came over to take our order only to realize we STILL didn't have our alcoholic beverages. Went to get them and then took our order. And that was basically the last we saw of him. Manager brought our appetizers and noticed our drinks were empty and asked if we wanted a refill. The refills were then dropped off and we received our food. When we were done eating our server asked if we needed anything else and we said boxes and check. Takes him another 10 minutes to grab our plates to box them up and drop off the check.  Then we asked for our $95 check to be split down the middle. Takes him another 10 minutes to bring back the split check of $45 and some change each.  BUT, to my surprise today I notice that on my credit card i have been charged THREE times for this. $95 once ( I am guessing he charged my card in full accidentally and then had it pulled back without informing me.) Charged another $95, followed by the $45.  This is honestly ridiculous. It honestly felt like he saw two twenty somethings sit down who weren't all dressed up and thought, 'eh I'm not going to get a tip out of them so why bother.' He was so attentive to his other tables and not to us. I will not be returning to this location just based off this experience alone. My boyfriend and I work very hard at our jobs and we expect when we go out to eat to have a good experience just as we would give to our guests."
Sergio I.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,3,5.0,10/25/2016,"First of all , remarkable costumer service from start to end . Our server Miguel is the best ! food was superb . we had the Liuisiana Chiken pasta and the 4 cheese pasta ( ask for it w/chiken) sooo good ! . we where very pleased with our experience at this restaurant."
Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",128,66,656,3.0,9/24/2014,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory locations very often, as I usually view them as somewhat overpriced for mediocre food. I feel like you're paying a bit more for the ""trendy ambiance"" rather than for quality, spectacular food. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a very difficult person to please - especially when it comes to food. I just feel that The Cheesecake Factory can be a bit overrated - it seems more of a novelty than anything. I've been to this location a few times and have received great service. Any inconveniences that myself or anyone else dining with me may have encountered during our visits were promptly and justly addressed - such as apologizing for an error in the kitchen which would cause a delay in receiving a food order and offering an appetizer or other item free of charge. Since this is just a few skips away from Disneyland, beware that it is in the middle of a tourist stomping ground, and you may have to wait a bit longer for a table depending on the time of the day you decide to attend. One of the upsides is that they do offer take-out, so if you are staying at a nearby hotel, you may order ahead of time and just take your food back to your room. Something I do particularly love about any & all Cheesecake Factory locations is their exceptional variety of desserts! I'm definitely a sucker for anything that appeases my sweet tooth."
Mana Chels A.,"Wailuku, HI",0,2,,5.0,10/20/2016,"Amazing food, amazing service. Our server, amett, was training a new server and was still very prompt and on point with anything and everything we needed. We definitely will be back and keep coming back when we're around Anaheim."
Edgar L.,"Anaheim, CA",3,4,2,5.0,7/23/2014,"When we first arrived at this Cheesecake Factory, my girlfriend and I were seated immediately. The time was around 5pm on a Wednesday. From the seater to the waiter everyone was extremely friendly and polite and made sure to consistently check up on us.  As for the food, I decided to go with the chicken and shrimp gumbo. It has a tiny bit of spice which I didn't mind and it was packed the flavor. There is an option where you can choose either white or brown rice that comes with the plate as well. Personally, I went for the white and it was a great compliment to the meal as a whole.  The drinks we ordered were also great. I ordered a piña colada and my girlfriend a mango margarita. The blend on both drinks was very balanced with not too much taste of alcohol and not just fruit either. Overall I would come here again due to the great food, great service, and wide selection of choices available."
Ranj P.,"Orange County, CA",142,172,26,1.0,5/18/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory so the two star rating is only for this specific location. It was my mother and father-in-law's anniversary about one month ago and they wanted to go somewhere different. I suggested we go to the Cheesecake Factory because it's somewhere we've never eaten together as a family. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for our waitress to take our drink and appetizer orders. After our appetizer orders went in our waitress came back and asked us if we wanted to put in our dinner order. We told her we would like to wait for appetizers to get here and to start eating before we place our dinner orders however, she insisted that we give her our orders at the present time and she would ensure that our meals would not come out until our appetizers were finished. Unfortunately, it did not happen that way. Our meals and appetizers both came out at the same time which really upset my father-in-law. We asked our waitress if she could take our meals back and if she could bring them back when we were done with our appetizers. She told us that wouldn't be a problem however the meal my brother-in-law ordered was a steak medium done and she told us the steak would continue cooking if he didn't eat it right away.  I personally think this was wrong and rude of our waitress. It was clearly her mistake to bring out both our meals and appetizers at the same time when we clearly told her we wanted them separately and now she's telling us one of our meals will be overcooked if we don't consume it right away. This kind of service is absolutely ridiculous. I've been to many other cheesecake factories in my life and I'm never had service this bad before ever. I'm definitely going to think twice before I come back to this location.  I definitely suggest that the restaurant manager have a long talk with the staff to ensure that they follow through with what they promised their customers."
Keycee D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",444,524,2877,4.0,9/5/2012,"Came here a few weeks ago for lunch. Haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a while, so BF and I decided to come here over Bubba Gump. I think it's our 4th Cheesecake Factory location we've been to...it was the first restaurant we ever ate together at , so there's some meaning there, haha! We got seated right away, but our server took forever to take our drink order or to bring our bread.  He paid too much attention to one table that was behind us while we sat in our booth waiting for him to take our damn order - I was a bit annoyed. I got the small plate Greek salad which was oh so AWESOME and BF got the Shrimp Scampi which was also really good. Of coarse we also ordered calamari, as I love their calamari :) BF wanted to try one of their cheesecakes since we've never tried one before, we decided to get the Ultimate Red Velvet cake cheesecake with white chocolate. I'm not a cheesecake lover, but holy moly, it was freaking DELISH! The red velvet cake was so moist, just everything about it was just really good that I had cravings after. I think I'll be coming back here not just for their calamari, but for that red velvet cheesecake.  Yummy Yum Yum!"
Alice T.,"Oakland, CA",62,42,54,4.0,10/12/2015,"In the area for a work conference and stopped in on a Monday night. No wait, got seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  Food: Guacamole- good but could've had a bit more salt Buffalo wings - excellent  Fish & chips - good Bistro shrimp pasta - good amount of shrimp, pasta lacked a little flavor Desserts: Tiramisu- good not too sweet Chocolate mousse cheesecake- good not too heavy but not as light as I thought it would be Overall a very enjoyable meal. Lots of families here after a day at Disney. Great service."
Marley-Jaii W.,"Earth, TX",31,50,57,5.0,6/23/2014,3rd time @ a cheesecake factory 1st time @ this location. We ate @ the bar. Our server Samuel F. was nice. The place was crowd & my friend was not having it so we walked over 2 the bar & just ordered over there. The wait was 40 min. 4 outside sitting and 30 min. inside sitting. We had pager #84. Our turn was up but by that time we already ordered our food and the lady came over to tell us but we told her we have been helped and everything was okay. They stamp your ticket so we didn't have 2 pay I think its a few hours free when stamped. We parked on level 2D. The factory is on level 2.  I ordered: grilled chicken club (added avocado) caramel pecan cheesecake ™ 6.20.14
Tricia J.,"Seattle, WA",8,17,1,5.0,1/10/2016,Fish tacos were fantastic! My son ordered chicken fettuccini off the lunch menu and said it was great!
Gaby A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2017,"How does a restaurant not accommodate food for a type 1 diabetic? Let me just start off by saying I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. This specific location is the one my family and I always celebrate birthdays, graduations, and bring out of town family to. We've always been treated with the best customer service, which is why we always choose this location even though the parking is a bit of a hassle. So then why the 1 star rating you might ask? Well, my family and I came here right after my pinning ceremony to celebrate me graduating from nursing school. So this dinner was kind of a big deal. There was about 11 of my family members there, one of them being my fairly new diagnosed Type 1 diabetic 18 year old niece. We always ask for a nutritional menu for her so she can make her choices based on the amount of carbs she's supposed to have per meal. If anyone knows anything about diabetes and carb counting then you know how important it is to know how many carbs are in a meal so that the proper units of insulin are given. The item on the menu that fit her carb load for dinner was the lunch portion of chicken alfredo, the dinner portion far exceeded the amount of carbs she could have for a meal. When we asked the waiter if we could still have the lunch portion for her and explained why, we were told they couldn't do that because lunch was over.  As I said before we come to this specific location all the time, and they've done this for us before multiple times even if lunch hour is over. Why this night was different I'm not entirely sure. We asked to speak to the manager who also denied our request after thoroughly explaining our situation. I was entirely floored and to be frank disgusted at how the situation was handled. We weren't asking for the food to be made differently, we just asked for a smaller portion for ONE person in our party for a medical reason.  The worst part about this entire situation was the way they made my 18 yr old niece feel about her illness. Being newly diagnosed with a lifelong disease that takes major life style changes is hard enough for anyone but for someone so young it's harder to adjust. She had finally started feeling less ashamed about her diabetes and this was a complete slap in the face for her. She sat in her seat and silently cried while all this was happening, completely embarrassed for even asking. My entire dinner and truthfully day was ruined. This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner & an end to a good day. At the end of it they tried to rectify the situation by offering to comp us a slice of cheesecake. Really? I mean I understand their gesture but to try and give us a slice of cheesecake when the whole reason there was even an issue was because of someone who has diabetes is just so backwards. My family and I left this place so disappointed, we hardly touched our food.  I would think that for as big of a restaurant that Cheesecake Factory is, they would be more sensitive about guests who require adjustments due to medical reasons but I guess not, I would suggest avoiding this place if you or a family member or friend might require an adjustment as well."
A J R.,"Orange, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/26/2016,"What can I say...I love this restaurant! The best part for me are their bartenders Mike & Jill. (Adam & Amanda are great too). They make a great team and are so personable and never forget a face. This restaurant is always packed so we like to sit up at the bar if there are seats available and have an appetizer before sitting down for dinner. Everything on their menu is amazing. Some of our favorites are the zucchini or crab bites for starters and the Seared Tataki Salad and the Cashew Chicken. The portions are huge and we always have left overs. Every time we dine here, we can always count on a positive experience! Even if you sit at a booth or table, chances are , your server will be great. One of our favorites is Ariel."
Diana T.,"Anaheim, CA",921,630,1456,3.0,9/17/2012,"There is a parking structure where you can park but on Sundays = no tickets = no validation = free parking and valet!  Got here around 6pm and got seated right away! (3 people).  There menu is very extensive and is filled with so many things that I was overwhelmed by just flipping through the menu.  They offer a variety of foods from mexican, asian, american, and so forth.  To make decisions a little easier and healthier, I browsed the ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" menu.  They have a variety of choices under 490 calories so I chose 2 things from there since they are pretty small.  Before ordering, they give you bread which was delicious!!  Onto the food Ahi Tartare ($7.00)- So light and refreshing!  If you like sushi, this is definitely a must.  The soy sauce, avocado and fish had such  great combination and it tasted really amazing Flatbread: WILD MUSHROOM,Garlic, Shallots and Fresh Herbs ($6.00)- This was just okay.  The mushroom tasted a little burnt and there was not much flavor to it.  I was expecting lots of herbs but it was very bland Salisbury steak: this came with some mashed potatoes and some sautéed string beans.  The steak was very moist and tender.  You don't even need a knife to cut through it.  The steak was missing something.  Can't really put my finger on it but I thought this dish was okay.  The mashed potatoes was also kind of bland. Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic ($17.00)- Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  The sauce makes this dish a winner!  This delicious plate was amazingly creamy, tasty, and full of flavors.  I wish I would've gotten this!!  I tasted some of it from my friend and I wanted more!!  But I opted for being more healthy. Overall, the service was okay.  They made a mistake on my order and brought out crab cakes which I did not order so I had to wait longer for my ahi tartare!  Other than that, they were quick about it.  I probably would  not come back here for awhile.   A bit pricey which I feel that I can find this type of food elsewhere for a cheaper price NOTE: -Birthday = free scoop of ice cream with a candle"
