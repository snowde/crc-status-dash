Cheryl D.,"Seal Beach, CA",7,50,4,5.0,6/1/2015,"Had dinner with my family here last night and it was AMAZING.  Let's start with the bread.  Two kinds, sourdough and some brown one that everyone else seemed to enjoy while I squirreled away all the sourdough on my plate.  Then came the shrimp scampi dinner.  Keri Anne, our lovely and kick ass server, let me substitute the angel hair pasta for mashed potatoes. My dad, who also ordered the scampi but got it with pasta, was eyeing my plate wishing he had customized his order too.  Dessert was the key lime cheesecake.  Yum. Even though there are Cheesecake Factories closer to my house, it's worth the drive to Anaheim to eat at this one because the service is so great.  I will be back!"
Letty L.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,9,3,5.0,6/29/2015,"The food, service & atmosphere here is top notch! Absolutely would recommend this place! Their waiters are courteous, highly efficient, & very fun!"
Jill S.,"Anaheim, CA",18,4,,5.0,7/4/2016,"On 4th of July my family and I came in to the cheese cake factory. We have been here many times, but never had the exceptional service Jeff our server provided. When we return we will definitely ask for Jeff again. Keep up the good work!"
Briana G.,"San Marcos, CA",210,34,12,5.0,6/6/2016,Delicious white sangria and the chicken bellagio was AMAZING! It's a really big portion that could be shared between two or split so that you can enjoy for the next day as well. It reheats better than I was expecting. The service here was very good as well. I and the ladies I came with were taking our time and we did not feel rushed. Friendly service. Definitely can't wait to go to Cheesecake again closer to home.
Jonathan G.,"Irving, TX",0,5,,5.0,7/18/2016,"I work in fine dining and my family goes to disney land almost every year . I walked into this restuarant and experienced horrible customer service from the host and what seems like the host manager. I have specifically asked for a veteran server who not only knows a significicant amount of menu knowledge But someone who can go above and beyond with ""wow"" service. So this is what i got. My server was named Liz.   She properly introuduced herself and spent an appropriate amount time to accommodate us as far as wine and entrees.  When receiving my wine it was the wrong wine, ( That tells me staff doesn't communicate or aren't trained properly ). It wasnt liz who served me the wrong wine. It was another server. However, Liz expressed her most sincerest apologies and have paid more attention to my table than the managment team.  She stepped up her game and not only gave me exceptional customer service but i also noticed she stepped up where service was compromised during my visit to this estblishment.  I have visit multiple locations throughout the US, (Dallas TX, Phx AZ, etc.) and noticed that liz stood out than most servers i have experienced. So i hope she gets recognized for this. I understand the service industry. But when it comes to the facility having a good name and reputable status. I recommend liz for this quality of service. You will not be disappointed. I have expressed to manager "" Mario "" that i did not have a good time. He showed little to no emotion to remedy the situation. He has proven to me that management is not the strongest skill set on his resume.  Did i mention its my bday today? Thanks Mario!"
Amanda C.,"Oakley, CA",3,139,1,4.0,10/14/2015,I Love the cheesecake factory.   I want to try other meals but I Love the stuffed chicken tortillas so much I order them every time.
Irving B.,"Long Beach, CA",403,181,103,4.0,6/18/2014,"Pros: Great interior decor, great service and large portions Cons: The prices and the large menu. Food Experience: The menu was rather confusing because it had italian, seafood, asian, hawaiian. So I got their Luau Salad which was pretty darn good and a nice portion of it. I had some of my nieces steak which was pretty delicious as well. Their cheesecake is really why I wanted to come which was one of the best red velvet cheesecake I've ever had ever! Conclusion: If you want cheesecake I completely recommend this place!"
A A.,"Bothell, WA",2,18,4,3.0,11/12/2016,"This is super busy due to its location, but they do a good job at getting you seated fairly quickly. They're a bit overpriced in my opinion, but the worst is that I requested no onions on my dish yet they were very clearly added. I had to pick them out and by that time my food was cold."
Raheem R.,"Augusta, GA",0,2,1,5.0,7/2/2016,"First time eating there and can honestly say it was awesome. Waited under 5 minutes to get seated. Waiter, Steven was spot on and anticipated our needs. Food came out hot and flavorful even though the line was around the corner. Staff went out of their way and Made our family vacation great so we will certainly eat there again."
Christina M.,"Cardiff, CA",679,286,170,5.0,3/16/2014,"I love this location.. It's nice to have a good option close to Disneyland that I know I'll enjoy. Last time I was there I tried their fish tacos and they were really good!!!! Great service & excellent food. Ahhhh, and amazingly delicious cheesecake!!! ;)) There are a lot of options on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying!"
Jessica L.,"Pomona, CA",509,58,13,2.0,2/7/2015,"I just tried this location the other day. And a couple of things were definetly not okay, and should be addressed. FOOD: I ordered the jambalaya dish, I asked her opinion and the dish and she assured I would like it.  Well unfortunately that was not the case. I had one bite, and was not a fan at all.  The texture of the noodles was something like Top Ramen , and reminded me of this very much so.  I was unimpressed.  Therefore I didnt even finish my dish, she only passed by to offer a box and quickly ushered my plate away.  Without asking how I liked it, I mean after all, she knew that it was my first time there and ordering a new dish which could be scary! SERVICE: She was nice. Prompt with drinks so no criticism there, but I was appalled when I arrived to my car and notice that she could have offered validation for parking.  Why didnt she offer this to me? If you plan on eating here, you have to ask about the parking validation because apparently they will not.  It is a service to you, and they don't offer it."
D.J. Y.,"Shoreline, WA",356,948,826,3.0,3/10/2014,"Been to this location a few times now since it's located right across the street from our Timeshare condos.  The location is crazy busy, and holy cow is it LOUD in there.  The uber high ceilings do not do this place any favors and while I in general like the menu and the food the place is just silly to try to hold a conversation amongst friends. Lines are long, drinks are ""meh"" and the cheesecake is.....well cheesecake...."
Coco S.,"Herriman, UT",3,128,308,4.0,3/20/2016,If you're looking for someplace good to eat while you're visiting the area this is always a safe bet. The food is always good and the cheesecake is always fabulous (whatever the flavor you choose). We came here for our anniversary and had great service and a nice experience.
Astrid G.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",4,12,3,4.0,5/13/2016,Great service. We sat outside on a beautiful day would've been better rating but too many little bugs flying around. A bug zapper would be good.
Jerrica N.,"Danville, CA",999,312,1427,4.0,1/15/2014,"Just got off the plane and we were starving. You can never go wrong with cheesecake factory since they do have a bajillion items on their menu. He said the mac and cheese burger was good so I went with that and he ordered the mahi mahi. Both dishes were good. The burger had a deep fried mac and cheese ball on top of the patty that was again topped with more cheese (melted cheesey goodness). Their fries were so-so, just didn't like that they were cut so small, made them hard to dip without getting my fingers in the ketchup. The mahi mahi is on their skinnylicious menu and for it being a little under 600, it is quite flavorful. If and when I order a cheesecake here, I always get the classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Because he is in love with the godiva chocolate cheesecake, we went with that. I must admit, this cheesecake is addicting. It has layers of FLOURLESS godiva chocolate cake, godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse. Each bite was luscious, rich, decadent, smooth and tantalized every taste bud on my tongue that left me wanting more (major foodgasm!!!). Another good Cheesecake Factory visit."
Carrie B.,"Rio Rancho, NM",20,25,57,5.0,3/31/2016,"Only went through the takeout part, but it was pretty great. The line went fast and the gentleman who helped us with our 6 cheesecake slices was totally fine with us being undecided.  The Togo cheesecake looks delicious and I can't wait to get to get back to the hotel to eat it!"
Mary L.,"Oceanside, CA",2,40,24,5.0,4/12/2016,"I have been wanting to go to either cheesecake or spag. factory but we don't have any at our city. Finally went here when we went to disneyland. The crab wontons is a must. Actually everything is a must, lol. Food was great, we were full so we didn't have dessert there so we just ordered take out for that. We got the hershey's cake which was amazing. Highly recommend it here."
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,4.0,12/9/2013,"First time been to this location, they serve food till very late, pass 12AM?! That's nice! We went there for late night drinks and snack, it was nearly empty the entire restaurant, just a few people at the bar and lounge area.  I ordered a Grey Goose martini, hubby had a Macallan 12 on rocks, turned out my Grey Goose was more expensive than Macallan?! We were surprised, hubby says "" babe you are expensive!"" Those drinks were strong and tasty, our favorites. Had edamame from the Skinnylicious menu to snack on, it was so delicious, lightly salted, great to go with my martini. It was really nice and relaxing to sip on drinks and snack on edamame, I had another Grey Goose Bloody Mary, it was a big salty and spicy pour, loved it!  Our bartender was very friendly and polite, did a little chat with us, it was fun. I have to come back here sometime soon, their new Skinnylicious, small plates & snacks menus are perfect for late night lounging. The portions from regular menu is huge, better share an entree, and order a few tapas, that way we get to sample many different dishes, I really want to try the Vegan burger, must be so delicious!  Ps. Remmeber to Validate parking tickets!"
Amy B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/1/2016,Went for my daughters birthday and they really made her feel special!!  Great food at surprisingly reasonable prices for being so close to Disney!!  They even validated our parking.  The food was beyond expectations and the waitress was so friendly and ensured drinks and bread basket was always full.  I loved how they decorated her birthday plate with her name and even put a candle on her cheesecake!
Hannah Y.,"Munich, Germany",255,284,680,5.0,11/21/2013,"I really like The Cheesecake Factory, I really really do. The Cheesecake Factory is the 'it' restaurant for little teens to impress their first dates. I'm not ashamed to say The Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favourite restaurants and I think it will remain that way. I am reviewing this location because I've been to this one several times when I was working at the Wells Fargo building a few years back. I've been here twice this year - once with my Italian visiting friend and a more recent time with my friends. You could never really go wrong here with their extensive and very easy menu. The Chicken Madeira, Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Ahi Tuna Salad are the items I would usually get - yes, this is the only time where I go 'big' I suppose. Yet the last two times I was here I asked for the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, an item I always overlooked. The Lemon Roasted Chicken is a half chicken that is already quartered for you. it comes with soft carrots and a very flavourful bunch of watercress paired with their usual mashers. The chicken was SO tender and flavourful - even both my guests agreed when they tried it! How could I have missed this the numerous times I've been here? It is clearly my new favourite! Yes, The Cheesecake Factory may not always be the healthiest, but the food never really goes wrong here. All my international friends are dying to try this restaurant!"
