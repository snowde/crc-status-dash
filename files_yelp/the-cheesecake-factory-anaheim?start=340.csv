Dell J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/14/2016,We went to the Cheesecake Factory we got seated right away. Than we waited and waited. About 20 minutes. We saw  2 servers pass by. Didn't even look our way. No acknowledgement or water. After 15 minutes we walked out. Not sure why the poor service.
Warren B.,"West Covina, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/11/2016,"Just had a nice family dinner after Disneyland, walking distance from the park... Never disappointed when coming here"
Charlotte C.,"Garden Grove, CA",108,135,154,4.0,2/11/2016,"I have always loved the variety of foods they have. The menu is like their own book. There's something at Cheesecake Factory for everyone. Their pastas and mixed drinks are my favorite. They are always prepared perfectly and are so delicious. The waiters and waitresses always have great recommendations and are so helpful when reading through the many options. Don't be afraid to ask their opinions on dishes or drinks because they definitely know their stuff! The portions are great, especially for the price. Food is prepared quickly and comes out so fresh. I have never been disappointed with this location and I look forward to my visits each time I get to go."
Kelly C.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,10,,5.0,5/13/2016,It was my first time coming here and I had a blast the food was Amazing and the drinks were soo good . I would definitely  would  come here again ..
Tim F.,"Long Beach, CA",49,54,12,3.0,7/20/2015,"This location is mediocre, at best. The food and the service was nothing special. Not sure if I will return to this location in the future. One good thing they do is validate parking. I have frequented The Cheesecake Factory and normally I'm very satisfied, guess I will have to stick with the Huntington Beach location.  I would not recommend this location. Some pros are that it is near Disneyland and they will  seat your party  fast."
Akiko I.,"Orange County, CA",1460,1443,13972,3.0,11/8/2013,"- Locale Destination - Their beer selections suck. Only 3 typical taps. Too many typical bottle beers.  - Gluttony Expedition -  Fire roasted chili rellenos : Good! Outside was crispy, lots of gooey pepper jack cheese inside of the mild green chili. Sorta ""American"" flare compared with the one by my Mexican buddy made for me. But I like this. Parmesan polenta fries: it wasn't crispy as they claimed. I prefer the one at ""Sonoma wine garden"" in Santa Monica. - Conqueror's Deduction -  Foods came out very quickly. Very good customer service. Not that I come here often, but it's totally OK for decent foods."
Deniece B.,"Stockton, CA",119,263,85,3.0,12/27/2015,"Here again... it was busy, as usual, but got seated in 10 mins. I've always liked this place,  but for some reason the food wasn't the same. I had the meatloaf and it tasted different.  Hmm... wait staff was nice and attentive."
Prachi G.,"Irvine, CA",135,88,57,4.0,3/2/2014,"So I've never been a fan of cheesecake factory because of a past experiences that I've had here however, my friend wanted to come here for dinner so we did.  We started off with a the tomato and basil flatbread as our appetizer. We were having wine so it complimented it perfectly. The flatbread pizza was very flavorful and we finished it in two seconds. Since our flatbread was SO good, we decided to order a bbq chicken pizza. I must say, it was SO good. My friend and I are really picky when it comes to pizza but this one was made to perfection. The crust was nice and crispy with the right amount of cheese. We hate it when pizza is over loaded with cheese which happens often. We ordered their chicken soft tacos off their ""skinnylicious"" menu and they were extremely bland. I've gotten food off "" skinny"" menus before and they do have flavor in them.  My favorite cheesecake from here is the 30th anniversary one. There's so much chocolate in it that I love it ! MUST GET!"
T Y.,"Burnaby, Canada",10,261,1,3.0,6/21/2015,"So, how the hell does place deal with a 19 page menu? Honestly, that's too many choices. Trim it down please. You can't possibly do justice for all your menu items by having so many. That being said, we came here for some appies. Got the crab and artichoke dip and cuban rolls. Both were pretty decent. Service was reasonable. My drink was refilled promptly after being empty. The cherry cheesecake we had was pretty good too. It wasn't super dense like some cheesecakes so I liked that. 2 complaints about it... not enough cherries and what exactly is the point of a graham cracker crust if it's soggy? When you order a menu item that's your namesake, it really needs to wow the customer. It was a decent enough dining experience for what it was. I'd come back again."
Alan M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,10,1,3.0,5/29/2016,Recently me and family celebrate my birthday. Well due to road blockage we couldn't get to Ruth's Chris steak house for my surprise party. We went to cheese cake factory. The waiter was very cool but our steak wasn't so good. I guess wrong choice to go for steak there.
Megan L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",214,19,,3.0,7/14/2015,"Prime location near Disneyland and among many other restaurants. I had a party of 4 and waited only 10 mins to be seated, which is a big plus! Given, we came on a weekday evening but it was also very busy! *Warning* If you drive there, you will need to park in the parking garage. Make sure to keep your ticket and give it to your waiter for validation. If not, you will be paying for parking!  Customer service was sub-par. It took at least 30 mins for our waitress to bring out bread+drinks+take our order. It might have just been our waitress because I witnessed other waiters/waitresses giving great customer service to their tables.  My boyfriend got the ahi tuna salad and said it was the best he's had. I got a steak and shrimp combo which was tasty but nothing to die for. Everything is pretty much expensive but you will get your money's worth. The cheesecakes are extraordinary and I definitely recommend the original cheesecake."
Stephanie F.,"Anaheim, CA",51,12,5,5.0,4/12/2016,"Bartender Mike makes an awesome strawberry martini . The hubby wanted to come in specifically for this after a long day, dinner was just an added bonus"
Sonya L.,"Kent, WA",752,1280,239,3.0,1/27/2014,"There's not much you can say about the Cheesecake Factory, really.  Across the board at all locations, their food is uninspired and you always have to wait a long time to get a table. But they do have fairly good cheesecake. Cheesecake was the goal of our visit when my friend and I went to this location on our vacation last week.  The wait was LONG for a group of 2 - I believe we waited around 45 minutes or so.  The seating process was kind of confusing because after the buzzer went off, we were herded to the side to wait (again) for someone to seat us.  A few groups lined up behind us.  It took about 5 minutes before they took us to our table.  So it was like we had to wait twice to be seated.  Weird. Once seated though, things were fine.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter cheesecake and it was super rich and delicious.  It was so filling that I sadly couldn't finish it!!  My friend had the Key Lime cheesecake and it was quite tasty as well.   Our waitress was friendly and the prices were the same as other locations, even though this one was essentially in the heart of Disney. I'd come back, but not if the wait was any longer."
Josie S.,"Santa Ana, CA",132,60,22,4.0,5/17/2015,I was amazed by how delicious the pasta here is! Tonight was my first time coming here and I enjoyed every second ! Let me start by saying that the food is so delicious! The pasta servings are quite large so you'll probably have leftovers for the next day. I can't recall which pasta I ordered but it was great. Of course the cheesecake is also the best part! I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake which had chocolate and caramel and other great layers. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The only downside is that I felt the tables were so close together. It felt a little cramped.
Dustin N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",370,18,1,5.0,5/5/2016,"Was served by George, awesome service even though the place was extremely packed because it was right across the street from Disney land. Since you can only park in the parking structure, make sure you get your parking ticket validated and don't lose it!!"
Shona D.,"Quilcene, WA",43,30,17,5.0,5/2/2016,"The absolute best cheesecake I've ever had in my life; mango keylime. Huge huge pieces, for 8 bucks fed 2 of us probably would have 3, but we didn't want to share."
Dawn B.,"Edmonton, Canada",20,75,48,5.0,4/10/2015,"We went here twice, and both times were great. The bread they give you is amazing,I could eat just that. The kids meals are great, but i especially love that they have a menu dedicated to healthy choices. I wish we had a cheese cake factory in Canada"
Sarah H.,"Cypress, CA",100,26,21,5.0,6/24/2015,"I can never get enough of the blackout cake! So moist and delicious. The inside was a bit noisy at night, although outside was the perfect seating area. The waitress was lovely as well."
Dawnmarie F.,"Norwalk, CA",27,62,489,4.0,5/8/2015,"GF cheeseburger was the best I have ever had, grilled onions, pickles tomatoes and just wonderful. The Godiva flourless cheesecake is absolutely sinful. Had to fight my kids for it. Waitress was attentive and kept my water glass filled. Love this place."
Eddie R.,"Anaheim, CA",27,39,32,3.0,3/29/2015,"It's Cheese Cake Factory at its fancier Anaheim locations near Disney and it's a-okay, this particular location is big, busy and enjoyable to dine at. The service that I've experienced here has always been averagely good and the food tasty but pricy. Me and my wife primarily go for a little late nite cup of coffee and dessert ( Try the strawberry shortcake ice cream dessert - yum!!! )  I gave this location just 3 stars because it's very busy and seating can take a while, and of course it's a hub for tourist so expect them to ask u to take a picture for them. If you can handle med/large sized crowds and an average 20+ min wait time during dining hours then your good, If you can't then try anywhere else away from Disneyland good luck."
