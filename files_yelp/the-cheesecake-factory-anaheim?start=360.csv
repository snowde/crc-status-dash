MK D.,"Burlingame, CA",59,1986,1591,3.0,8/15/2013,"I actually like coming here for their roasted beets salad and their vietnamese tacos with pork belly for a light dinner. We normally beat the crowds by sitting at the bar area than sitting at a booth in the main dining area.  We rarely stay for dessert but if I do want to indulge, we'll share the kahlua cheesecake."
D J.,"Corona, CA",2,36,1,5.0,4/9/2016,"Our experience at this Cheesecake Factory was a very good one. It was a Saturday night and it was pretty packed but we were seated in less than 20 minutes of us checking in (with no reservation). I cannot tell you how I and my family were impressed with the professionalism and kindness of the waiter we had - I really do wish I could remember her name - she was friendly, professional and personable, couldn't have asked for better service from her. My only very small suggestion is that they get some kind of table light because it was quite hard to read the menu, but other than that the service and food was excellent. Also, I'd suggest the s'mores cheesecake!"
Shelly H.,"Concord, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/22/2016,This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and I am already bugging my boyfriend to go back with me.  I got the eggplant Parmesan and dulce de leche cheesecake and OH MY GOODNESS. It was so good.  The eggplant was breaded perfectly and came with pesto pasta; it was amazing to say the least. Boyfriend unit and I split one piece of dulce de leche cheesecake and we were both very impressed with how great it was. We even joked about going back to get more.  Cant wait to try something else there.
Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",460,304,1025,3.0,10/22/2013,"Service is usually lacking at this location because of how busy they are, being near Disneyland and all. On every occasion I've been here, I've had below satisfactory service. Servers are always MIA when you need something and their friendliness is forced. Thank goodness for big water glasses, otherwise I'm sure I'd be waterless once I've finished my first glass. The waiter brought out COLD and HARD bread the first time and when I asked for more, the second batch was just COLD. A step up I guess? Maybe by just a millimeter. Food at the Cheesecake Factory is always delicious. With over 300 items and 3 pages of JUST cheesecake, I mean, the numbers speaks for itself. Don't be fooled, you do NOT get a free specialty cheesecake slice just cus it's your birthday. You get some ice cream with a candle on top. Everything on the menu is good. I've tried lots of items and have liked them all. I especially recommend the Chicken Bellagio or the Hibachi Steak. I like the Cheesecake Factory in BREA much better."
. ..,"Anaheim, CA",5,19,2,5.0,10/26/2014,"You must ask to sit in Carnell's area when you eat here. He is hands down one if the best waiters here. He has all the skills, personality and attitude that a successful waiter should have to make a diners experience enjoyable. I would come back to this location based just on the fact that he is employed at that location. He made sure that we had refills on our drinks, bread and checked up on us routinely on how our food was.  The food was delicious and we have had any bad experiences when we have come to eat here. We live in the neighborhood and we will definitely be back and hope that Carnell is working.  Do yourself a favor and skip PF Changs, McCormick & Scmicks, Roys and any other restaurant at Gardenwalk and eat at The Cheesecake Factory and ask to sit in Carnell's area. You won't regret it."
Jess M.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,92,444,5.0,12/4/2013,"My husband and I come here a lot when in the area due to the variety of dishes on the menu! The location is in the Anaheim Garden Walk which basically has quite a bit of other restaurants along with retail stores. Parking is in a parking garage. Bring your card with you and you can get it validated. There is inside seating as well as the patio. This place is pretty big like most Cheesecake Factories but it does get busy early due to it's proximity of Disneyland and shopping area. Our food is almost always good. We tend to mix things up with the menu and try different dishes. I must say order the fried macaroni and cheese balls, they are to die for! Service is pretty spot-on. Refills on our drinks and our orders come out the way we like ever time. We will continue to eat here when in the area and we enjoy other CF location!"
Star A.,"San Clemente, CA",154,74,80,5.0,12/28/2014,"The service here was amazing. Our waitress Kerriane was so sweet and she made us laugh and smile! The only thing that happened was they mixed up my sisters order for pancakes instead of french toast. However, she noticed right away and all was good! I recommend having her as your waitress. I also recomend their brunch!!"
Robin N.,"Santa Maria, CA",20,23,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I hate to leave a negative review but this time it is a must.  There is a QUEEN of the bullies working at the Cheesecake Factory in Anaheim.   On October 12th at about 4:40 pm, I approached a woman at the Cheesecake To Go counter to pick up my order.  She was clearly a manager due to her manner of dress.  Apparently I interrupted something VERY important because the look she gave me would have melted glass!  She then sat tossed my order on the counter and ran my card.  However it was clear to me that the order was incorrect.  I stated this fact to her in a polite manner.  Oh Brother!  That did not go over well at all.  A look of fear crossed the faces of the workers behind her.  She shoved my order ticket in the hand of a woman who was literately trembling with fear.  Then the ""manager"" stormed off to the kitchen area. The very frightened workers proceeded to help me with my order in a very polite and efficient manner.  The ""monster"" returned just prior to my leaving to help a new customer picking up a To Go order.  She was equally rude to this poor lady as well. I wish I knew this horrible lady's name but she had no name tag.  I would love to report her to upper management. Cheesecake Factory, is this the best you can find???  So many fine people who need jobs.  I am a teacher,  I know a bully when I see one.  Your restaurant is better than this representative."
Missy K.,"San Diego, CA",176,186,160,5.0,6/21/2015,It's been an amazing Father's Day and 15 year wedding anniversary celebration here with our family the food is amazing the lighting is perfect and kinda romantic) As romantic as you can get with 6 kids) I would recommend to anyone looking to have a nice evening with friends and family.
Risya L.,"Elk Grove, CA",286,570,753,3.0,11/11/2013,"Don't be scared to sit outside when it's cold outside. It's well heated!! Service was okay.  Food was just meh.  I forgot to use my Disney pass to save.  Too much food, as always.  Calamari was rubbery and gross.  Outside was nice and toasty to sit at. I had more complaints then positive.  Which is shocking because the one I use to go to in Colorado and the last time we went to this location we had amazing service.  So not sure what happened that night."
Diane S.,"Fairfield, CA",5,34,4,2.0,11/25/2015,"Website and Yelp both say this location takes reservations but when you call to make them, they acknowledge that the website says that but they won't take reservations- walk in only!"
Tu-Anh N.,"Oakland, CA",918,460,3552,4.0,3/20/2012,"The wait was an hour even though they said it would be an hour and a half.  It felt really long but it WAS WonderCon weekend.  I let my friends pick the place to eat...otherwise I would never come here....not so big on the whole food chain business but the food is good.   When my party of 6 finally got a table, it never felt so good to sit down!  Even though it was clearly a busy night, out servers were very attentive and friendly. My boyfriend and I decided to split the Mac n Cheese Burger. It was $12 that came with french fries that were decently good.  The burger was topped with one of their appetizer Mac n cheese ball, with an addition to cheese sauce to top it.  It was delicious.  I'm really glad I split this item because I would have not been able to finish this...ok I lied I would have been able to finish this along with feeling a food comatose and regret haha.   Oh I forgot to mention thier free WARM bread and butter.  I always enjoy those....especially the wheat one!  It helps since we did wait an hour so we were all starving! Sure I""d go again...only because friends really want to go.  And yes I""ll order the food and enjoy it!"
Brandon F.,"Kent, WA",75,11,,1.0,11/19/2015,So we went here for dinner on our vacation and usually very good food and service! But unfortunately this time wasnt the best of experience. First off our waitress was very slow and looked like a chicken with its head cut off and also when we got some of the food it was cold... not luke warm but cold like it had been sitting for way to long.. also the silverware had stuff stuck to it. So needless to say i would not recommend this location!
Rose Z.,"Turlock, CA",0,73,188,4.0,12/26/2014,"Location: close to Disneyland and Anaheim CC; Setting: grand and fashionable;  Food: tasty and large portion. Particularly love their bread. Although I am a regular for this restaurant chin, the major problem is reservation. They don't take any reservation because they are crowded most time. This is a strong minus in the modern society."
Willis O.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,8,1,5.0,4/25/2016,Absolutely amazing as usual.  Popped in for lunch before the Royals Angels game.  This place never disappoints.
Miss B.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,42,43,5.0,9/14/2013,"First off, Erin was our server and her booty was crazy. I felt like a lesbian for looking at it every time she walked by but I couldn't help myself. Hehe. Like, daaaamn.. Oh, and service was great.  The food was delicious. I got hibachi steak while my boyfriend got filet mignon. Very tasty.  I also had the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, and they sung the birthday song for me.  Thank you, Erin! And Cheesecake Factory for being amazing!"
Dee R.,"Downey, CA",51,255,589,4.0,1/21/2015,"I love this place. I really do. Bread is good, food is good, service is good and dessert is SO good! Took my family a few days ago and had a good experience thanks to our AMAZING waitress Sabrina. It was a busy Sunday night but she was excellent, despite the crowd. Food was good. We got 6 slices of cheesecake and everyone was happy, happy, happy. One complaint: lighting is just way too dim. Pretty ridiculous when we had to pull out our phone flashlights to read the stinkin' menu!!! And I am a food inspector so dark lighting is not favorable to dissecting my meal.  for lighting!"
Erick D.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",23,36,16,5.0,1/9/2016,Very big location. They have a lot of tables. We went during a busy Saturday night and waited maybe about 20 minutes. The waiter was very attentive. They had a very clean bathroom. Would definitely come here again and recommend it to others.
Mandy M.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,5.0,4/18/2016,"I was in with friends about 2 months ago and had a fantastic experience. Dinner was delicious, almost each person at the table had their own slice of cheesecake for dessert, and our waiter George was excellent. Even though we were a slightly high-maintenance table, he took great care of us and had a really great attitude through it all. Sorry George, for taking so long to write this review that I promised I would. I'm a server at a high-volume restaurant in La Jolla and I appreciate how hard you worked for us. Beautiful restaurant!"
A V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7,6,2,4.0,5/21/2015,"As usual, Cheesecake Factory was an amazing choice to come to after an event. My family and I came here to celebrate my sisters graduation so we were all a little hyper from the excitement and we we were a pretty big party. We were seated fairly quickly and served warm bread. The entrees were incredible as always. If you ever go, get the chicken parm sandwich. It's to die for! The only thing that brought it down a star was some cold potatoes on two different plates. Beyond that it was a great experience. Karen was our server and was amazing. Very prompt and on top of everything we needed. The night was concluded with some delicious cheesecake! Warning- the Oreo extreme cheesecake is amazing but very very sweet!"
