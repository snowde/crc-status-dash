J S.,"Vienna, VA",7,1,,3.0,3/3/2017,"Cheesecake is usually my go to place when craving a salad that is delicious and always too large to finish. BUT this review is solely based on one experience that occurred in the beginning of January. Husband and I were about to fly to the east coast, and per usual, he wanted to have a good ""last meal"" in the case that the plane goes down and we plummet to our death. We were both starving and excited to eat, but one thing after another, we were extremely disappointed. He ordered a burger and specifically asked for plain, minus the cheese, and everything else on the side, because he is disgusted by ketchup and tomatoes BUT ketchup was slathered all over the bun. He was mortified and scrapped off every little bit. I on the other hand ordered a salad, and the first thing I noticed was something brown. I thought, ""dirt??? No, no...couldn't be"" but lo and behold, it was. My lettuce leaves were covered with wet dirt. Talk about mortified maybe it was a fluke, but regardless, we were incredibly disappointed."
Sandra A.,"Anaheim, CA",104,28,26,4.0,3/4/2015,Me and a couple  friends went here last week and the waiter was very attentive and kept his smile even though I asked dumb questions. The house cab was quite tastey. My friend had the carbonara which I've had before and I tried the steak Diane. If you love love love mushrooms this dish is for  you. ..I hate mushrooms and figured the mushroom sauce would be more sauce and less mushroom but quite the opposite. (Ref pic). The steak was delish though!!
Vyvy T.,"Anaheim, CA",67,42,122,5.0,9/20/2014,"I think that the Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite restaurant. The only real problem I have is that they have so much on their menu it's really difficult to choose from lol but other than that, I feel like your portions are reasonable for the amount you're paying and the food is also delicious! You also get complementary bread!"
Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,5.0,8/17/2014,"This is a quick review because I haven't been to this location in awhile. But, whenever I visit a CCF I order the same thing - Bistro Shrimp Pasta. And this location made it the best I've ever tasted! (think I'm due for another visit.....)"
Olee R.,"California, MD",0,14,,2.0,3/13/2016,"The first time I came here with my husband for dinner the food was great delicious!! I ordered the pasta carbonara it was nice and creamy, the bread that they give you when you are first seated was nice and warm everything was great. The second time however was not so good my pasta was watery AF it looked like they had just pour milk over the pasta no taste at all!!!! the bread was cold hard just nasty.. They did try to fix it but still the pasta was nasty less watery but no flavor , seasoning.. I don't know if I will be coming back any time soon Olive Garden has better I am disappointed.."
Jay M.,"Bellflower, CA",0,11,1,1.0,10/4/2015,This restaurant has the worst service. Our friend ordered his food like all of us and we all finished our food and his barely came out last minute. The server also left his water pitcher on the table and totally forgot about it. We all ordered fettuccine Alfredo and it had no flavor. It was so nasty. Not happy neither satisfied with my visit. I could of gone to Olive Garden and gotten cheaper and better tasting fettuccine as well as customer service.!!!!
Richard D.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/11/2016,"I've had food poisoning three times in the last 6 months from getting three different dishes. Never get anything containing raw egg, meat and pasta with chicken or steak that is undercooked"
Benji W.,"Adelaide, Australia",24,140,161,5.0,11/1/2014,Even if our food here wasn't amazing our night was thoroughly entertaining because of our server ( Carnell) His knowledge was fantastic and helped pick me out a nice glass of red to go with our meals that were Huuuge and very nice.
Jacque W.,"San Gabriel, CA",29,16,,1.0,10/18/2015,This place is going  down the hill like claim jumper. HORRIBLE serivce . 1st go in last to get a table seriously?  go find a better A TCF This place is BAD service
Cat N.,"Orange County, CA",4271,1319,5866,2.0,3/12/2011,"Everytime I go here I am never fully satisfied Me and the girlfriend arrived for lunch on a Saturday.  There wasnt much people and we were seated right away.  I ordered white wine sangria first.  The waitress girl took forever to bring it out and left before we ordered our food.  We waited and waited and waited to order our food.   I ordered the chicken fettucini with sun dried tomatoes.  It was mediocre.  Kinda bland.  The pasta was also a little hard, not al dente.  I think they rushed it.  The chicken pieces were dry and flavorless.  Not so great.  My friends pasta was also alright.   Our total for 1 liquor dink and 2 lunch meals was around $35.  I thought it wasnt very worth it.  I was disappointed with the mediocre food and the crappy service."
Victor H.,"Garden Grove, CA",62,93,26,4.0,1/30/2016,"Wonderful happy hour, and overall good value. Service: Pretty standard for a chain. Friendly and reasonable on timing. Food: the kitchen does a good job on the food, for the most part.  Entree salads are quite large.  Appetizers are tasty.  My only real gripe is the vietnamese spring roll.  I understand the taste is not going to be authentic, but the wrap was slightly brittle.  This is caused by prepping the roll and leaving it in the fridge for way too long before serving.  It needs to be removed from the menu, or prepped before service.  Even a day is way too long for the rice wrap.   Cheesecakes are of course, phenomenal.  The red velvet is to die for... almost literally (see the calories). I believe one is equal to over half your daily caloric intake.   The menu is quite extensive, but I guess that's a good thing for a family w/ different desires.   Drinks are standard, w/ a decent selection of beers."
John M.,"Atascadero, CA",0,18,2,5.0,3/6/2016,Great food just how I ordered. My wife and I will be coming back. Thanks to our great server Kristine!
Keith A.,"Oceanside, CA",703,331,5347,5.0,12/18/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Excellent tasting food, large menu, lots of options. $10 to $20. Chicken piccata, large burrito. Chicken masala, jambalaya, Kobe burger. One of my favorite places to eat out. Outstanding cake and cheesecake desserts $7 to $10. Adams pb cup, Reese's pb cup, and several others."
Jackson S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,16,6,4.0,4/4/2016,"The restaurant is in the middle of a busy strip near D-Land. It's so nice. Casual yet classy! The food was great and the bread is soft and tasty! Loved the pasta! Perfectly cooked and finished off in the sauce! Good times, good food, great service! I love the OC!"
Diana A.,"Bell Gardens, CA",6,19,13,4.0,10/10/2014,Stopped by for lunch after a hot day at Disneyland... Did't have to wait for a table maybe like 2 mins..  I got my food from there Lunch Specials... I got the Orange chicken.. and all I gotta say is that I was full and only ate half of it... It was a good size portions being it was a lunch special...  So this was well worth my $$ and the food was great...  all in all it wasent bad... I would come back for lunch again..
Mariko C.,"San Diego, CA",1,67,77,1.0,8/26/2014,"Why bother writing about an establishment that already has nearly 500 reviews? The most UNPROFESSIONAL customer service I have ever received anywhere, and it actually makes for a pretty good story. Came here at 2:00 pm for an afternoon lunch break from Disneyland. It was not crowded at all, and my boyfriend and I were seated right away. And that's when things turned sour. Just as we were about to place our order, a MASSIVE black beetle the size of a half dollar crawled out of the cushion of our booth, right next to my boyfriend. We were very alarmed and immediately moved away to avoid it. And that's not even the worst of it... Because hey, it's summer, and unfortunately, bugs happen. So here's the horrible part: Our waitress looks at the beetle and says, ""Ewww that's soooo gross!"" She then hands my boyfriend a PAPER NAPKIN and asks him to KILL IT! He was so shocked he didn't know what to do, so I jumped in and said ""Are you kidding me? NO, he is absolutely NOT going to kill that thing!"" (as it's still creepily crawling towards us). So the waitress proceeds to ask us to place our order and we sat there dumbfounded that she wouldn't even consider accommodating us. We, THE CUSTOMERS, had to request to be moved to a different table because of the beetle situation! She tells us to just scoot down to the other end of the booth.  At that point, I don't even know why we stayed at the restaurant, but we were really hungry, so perhaps our judgement was impaired. But little did we know, we were in for even more disappointment. Omelette was under-cooked, toast was burned black, food was generally very greasy. But it took so long for the food to come out that we didn't want to bother requesting anything different and having even more delays. Who do they have working here on Saturday afternoons, anyway?? In our experience, this place is way overpriced with extremely sub-par service. If you're already in the area, might as well spend your money on overpriced food at the theme parks or Downtown Disney which you'll actually enjoy. We thoroughly regretted coming here, and we will never return."
Mayra V.,"Coppell, TX",75,7,2,3.0,2/16/2016,"I honestly think the location is what killed it for me.  It's in a tourist area so it just felt like I was being rushed and the waiters had absolutely no connection with us.  The food is not bad, I just wasn't impressed with the staff.  Oh!  And the bathrooms....yucky!"
Sharon H.,"Honolulu, HI",169,315,1707,3.0,2/1/2013,"After too much pizza and popcorn at the Disney theme parks, it was the craving for green salads and a hot meal that led us to The Cheesecake Factory on Katella conveniently located by our hotel.   Since it was nearly 10 p.m. and the kids were literally half-asleep in the booth, we were hoping for really fast service and a quick exit.  Orders were taken and a basket of fragrant warm breads arrived at the table.  The 16-year-old was the lucky diner who got his plate of buffalo wings right away while we watched enviously and gnawed at the crusty bread. Next, my friend's heaping salad, a bowl of soup, a pizza, and my salad and white bean hummus dip with pita arrived.  The hummus was creamy smooth and redolent with garlic while the pita was toasty warm. Delish. The last person to receive his order was my friend's husband -- his pasta order was botched ... twice!  The restaurant kindly made up for it, but the mixup made the late night even later.   After all that, we were way too tired and grumpy to enjoy any of the restaurant's celebrated cheesecakes.  Sigh.  Thankfully I can go to the restaurant in Waikiki, though I just heard they had a fire there this morning!"
C L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,102,195,4.0,2/14/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is our first dinner meal stop on our visit to Disneyland. Came here on a Friday night at 7 pm and the wait was only 5 mins even though the place was packed. The front hostesses team worked well together and coordinated all the seatings. They were surprisingly efficient. I know the Cheesecake Factory food portions are large so we got a buffalo wing appetizer and a main pasta to split between the two of us. The server was perfectly cool with the split since I didn't want to get a doggie bag back to the hotel. I had a cheesecake slice for dessert. The food and the service were both excellent. Our server was attentive & friendly. We parked the car at the lot. If you eat here, your parking stub can be validated for up to 3 hours. Free parking. Sweet."
Chloe C.,"Santa Monica, CA",200,542,91,1.0,1/29/2013,"Poor service. Poor service. Bad service. Mal servicio. poop. Can't believe the server would treat us like that... After we ordered, his face immediately frowned and he left. Possibly because we just came here for happy hour and snacks? Possibly because we looked young and APPEARED that we didn't know how to tip? Boo, other Cheesecake Factories are exponentialy better. Poo on you!!! You're lucky we were sympathetic, and still tipped in full.. even though you didn't deserve it. Arse!!"
