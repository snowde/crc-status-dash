Steve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",299,200,261,4.0,6/6/2017,"As a full-time, die hard Cheesecake Factory aficionado I knew I HAD to try the CCF near Disney and of coarse ... the food was out of this world. Hardly ever come for breakfast so I figured, what the heck, why not. Arrived at the bar really early and sat at the bar as I do per usual, ordered the french toast (as per usual) with a side of chicken chorizo (asked to be served whole, not chopped up) and it was everything i could ask for. I loved how wide open and spread out this Cheesecake Factory is, not as intimate as one is accustomed to. It was so BIG inside i was kinda taken by surprised. I wish CCF took reservations (not that this occasion required a reservation) but I could only imagine the mess this place could be on a Friday night... if the thousand oaks CCF is packed, this one must have a line out the door. Cheesecake and all their sister restaurants are amazing - I have never had a bad experience. See you soon :)"
Mike M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,54,17,4.0,12/11/2017,Great food. Mashed potatoes was the bomb. And to think I never wanted to eat here. We will definitely be back. What the H was I thinking. Bring your appetite
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,2.0,3/13/2017,"I haven't dined at Cheesecake Factory for years and since it was extremely busy the night we went, we ordered to-go instead. The quality of the food was great but the portions were noticeably off for one dish. Ordered 2 pastas and 1 entree salad:  Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: Vegetarian dish - pasta with lots of veggies. This was really good! Farfalle w/chicken & garlic: Delicious. Highly recommended if you like chicken, pancetta (bacon), mushrooms, and garlic! Sheilas chicken & avocado salad: Great flavor. Tasted like the typical American ""Asian"" salad.  The portions for the Farfelle & salad were generous but the vegetarian pasta was seriously lacking. It was as if we ordered a half portion which was really weird. Also the complimentary bread that came with the meals were really small and hard. I remembered their breads to be super soft, warm, fluffy, and delicious. So sad. Although the food was tasty, the quality is not consistent so the likelihood of returning is low."
K K.,"Anaheim, CA",2,33,23,5.0,12/10/2017,What not to love about this place.  Their food is the bomb! Anything u order is delicious! Get me gift card from here for xmas. Haha
Tasnim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,98,93,5.0,3/9/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is A1! I've been here a total of two times and loved it both times. We just went tonight at around 8 p.m. and it was really busy, but we got seated in about twenty minutes for a party of two. Our server's name was Carnell and right off the bat, he made us laugh. He saw we were kind of just waiting on bread and to get our drinks order taken and got on that ASAP. Throughout the whole night, he was extremely attentive and helpful when we were unsure between a few options. Also really funny and polite. Honestly, I can genuinely say that he was one of the best servers I've ever had. Not just at Cheesecake Factory but overall. He was THAT great. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and really enjoyed it. Carnell said it would be really spicy but it actually was not spicy at all for me. I liked it a lot but I did initially want to ask for fettuccine pasta instead of linguine and forgot. I think the pasta would have been much better with fettuccine but that's just because I like thicker pasta types. For dessert, I got Linda's Fudge Cake and it was delicious. It's always my go-to and I'm never disappointed. Very fudge-y and heavy. I'm overall very satisfied with this dining experience, mainly because of Carnell. Prior to this dining experience, The Cheesecake Factory was always a pretty average dining location. I mean that in terms of the food and whatnot. Thanks Carnell for everything!"
Natalie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,118,87,3.0,8/3/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is ""life."" I absolutely love eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Regardless of the occasion, it's always a great place to grab a bit to eat. This Cheesecake Factory did not meet the mark though. My friend and I visited at 9 p.m. and there was about a forty minute wait. Luckily, my friend and I were distracted by the gorgeous/delicious display of cheesecake. I made it a personal goal of mine to try every single cheesecake on the menu. Good luck with that, right?  My favorite dishes at the Cheesecake factor are the avocado rolls and the burrito. Mhmm! You can never go wrong with these two choices. Plus, you get unlimited bread! So...why the three stars? Our waiter seemed a little bothered every time we ordered or asked a question. My friend and I only came to order a slice of cheesecake each. Once we told him that we were going to order only cheesecake, he immediately seemed a little displeased. I know it can get stressful serving tables, but we are still paying guest. When we saw him come by the table with bread, we asked, ""Is that bread for us?"" He promptly responded, ""No, this is for another table. I'll bring some later."" It wasn't his response that bothered us, but the way he said it. He kept this attitude this entire evening. Even my friend noticed it and she is a bartender! Overall, the food here is great, but the service can fall a little short.  This Cheesecake Factory is a great location, too! It's at the Anaheim Garden Walk. There is so much to do there. There is the House of Blues, bowling, shops, etc."
Beautyy L.,"Garden Grove, CA",270,9,1,2.0,12/18/2017,im giving THIS cheesecake factory for having me on hold (no big deal) and having 3 different people pick up and putting me on hold again. and im not just this cheesecake factory but all cheesecake factories 2 star for not having stuffed mushrooms on the catering menu. at least they should give the option of catering the mushrooms bc they are so small and seem easy to make in large quantities.
Jax M.,"Orange, CA",2,10,4,2.0,6/3/2017,"Everything was fine during dinner, service was ok, food was ok, but there was a piece of plastic in my mashed potatoes which kinda ruined my appetite  :("
Tony A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,21,8,5.0,2/9/2017,"I'd give 10 stars simply due to our server Vanessa! Best service hands down!!!! Every time we come to this location although very touristy they treat you like family especially Vanessa!!!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner and service after a long work day!  It was extremely busy with the patio full of guests, although slammed with request her smile and can do, upbeat, positive attitude never let up! She continues to raise the bar with servicing the guests. Regardless of being called on table after table she always has a way of making you feel like the most important guest on her list. With every table I continued to observe her and never once did she write anything down, nor did I see any plates be sent back. All food was from our order was perfect to the very last detail!  We appreciate you so very much and your dedication to your guests! We will be back for you! See you soon! Your neighbors down the street!! :)"
Ashton P.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",204,186,196,4.0,2/12/2017,Willy's really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. The one thing I enjoyed about this location is their menu was simply a menu and wasn't tripled in size by advertisements like other ones I've been too. The service was great and our food tasted fresh and delicious. I got steak and shrimp and it was cooked exactly how I ordered it. When you ordered an appetizer of avocado egg rolls and they were delicious as always. And then there's the crazy amount of different flavors of cheesecake you can order. They always taste awesome. It is a bit pricey but it's worth it
Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,4.0,4/11/2017,"I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Mostly because of the dessert options, which is the only reason I have given them four stars. The many choices of cheesecakes are endless and all very good. I have yet to have bad service, however the wait to be seated is always ridiculous. The food is slightly above average of a chain restaurant but the higher prices say otherwise. The large menu offers so many choices, of any food type, which makes the dining experience fun.  Dine or Dash? Dine. However, if there are other options near by, I will probably give them a try first."
Sori Na Lee T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",436,7,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"The managers here are crap. They aren't good to their employees and they listen to you complainers here. Americans are the worst. Also, that GM named Frank is a MORON. He came over to our table and gave us a lot of attitude and I over heard him talking to his employees like they were trash. GET RID OF FRANK!! He is THE WORST GM!!!"
Jeff B.,"Cheney, WA",10,152,439,3.0,4/8/2017,"Dang, I can't stand this place. It's always such a sodium bomb. Heck, I bet if I licked the menu it would be salty. But my little gals absolutely love coming to a CF, so I will eke out the third star. I will say their cheese cake here was less stale than the last one I went to. Our server was a sweety, and even though very busy, always made sure we were in want for nothing. It seemed a tad more expensive than others I've been forced to go to, but it's close enough to Disney where I could probably tee up a driver shot and crush the ball into the Cali Adventure area. Three entrees, two slices of cheese cake, three iced teas, and Daddy dropped over a benjamin (after tip). Sigh. All for the little gals, I suppose..."
Lynna K.,"Anaheim, CA",1,27,7,5.0,8/6/2017,"Today we had lunch at Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my daughters 3rd birthday. I feel the need to write this review because of how happy my daughter was and what a memorable experience we had! Kerianne was our waitress and she was the absolute best. She was very humorous and took great care of us! They sang happy birthday to my daughter and things could not have been more sweet. Kerianne was such genuine lady and the warmth she exuded really made my daughter smile.  The food and drinks were excellent. My sweet little girl devoured her bow tie pasta and I ""stole"" one of her delicious corn dogs (when she wasn't looking). I had the fish tacos which were great, and my mom had the omelette with a side of tomatoes. My mom is super picky and the first thing she commented on was the tomatoes and how fresh and juicy they were. My mom also finished every last bite of her omelette so it was obviously quite tasty. We also had peach bellinis and a pineapple mojito which were delicious. We ended our meal with a slice of delightful mango cheesecake. It was quite a treat and I highly recommend it!  I look forward to seeing Kerianne again and she really helped make my daughter's birthday special. Because of this, Kerianne is #1 as far as I'm concerned! Thank you so much!!!"
J G.,"Orange, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/19/2017,"This review is for the Rude possibly racist hostess. I went in there Thursday night around 9pm, walked up to the hostess and she saw me then turned away to talk to another waiter. I'm like ok.. must be busy. In walks this white couple and she immediately greets them hi how are you!!!? Like really? I've been standing there for 5 minutes. She is also white and I'm a minority. Her name is Elizabeth, this is the kind of subtle racism you can most definitely expect from this location and this hostess. Hopefully she gets fired soon. Will not return, guys goto a different restaurant."
Michael M.,"Anaheim Resort, Anaheim, CA",3013,75,587,4.0,7/12/2017,"I admit that I am a die-hard Cheesecake Factory patron like many of the reviewers out there.  The restaurant chain is listed as one of my top 10. I may take some heat out there but I challenge you to find a better Cheese Enchilada accompanied with sweet corn tamale cakes. You combine your meal with one of their best signature cocktails served (Long Island Ice Tea), followed by a slice of any of their decadent cheesecakes and you have a great ""epic""urean experience albeit at a heft price of 2,000+ calories. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Yes. ..Yeah... This is one of my ""go to"" restaurants... never been disappointed once."
Lesley M. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,163,1697,3.0,1/27/2017,Service was good given how super busy this location is .  Peach Bellini is amazing and very savory Text Mex rolls .  Skip the calamari - just a bunch of oil .
Vivian T.,"Vancouver, Canada",253,144,1238,4.0,3/13/2017,It's great that they have a children's menu that makes life easier for parents...there's also a lighter calorie menu for people watching their calorie intake...I really like the warm and fresh bread that they served us at the beginning....
Phil P.,"Schaumburg, IL",52,170,,5.0,1/11/2017,"I usually don't write reviews for chains, more particularly national chains.  But taking into consideration the quality of service and food coupled with the fact that it's in a major landmark entertainment area, I felt compelled to compliment this establishment.   After a full day of travel riddled with multiple delays, I finally made it to my hotel down the street around 8pm, starving.  The hotel had a restaurant, but none of their offerings sounded tempting.  So, I decided to play it safe and take a short stroll to The Cheesecake Factory.  Since it was just me, I ponied up to their bar and was immediately greeted by my server/ bartender Nicole.  She was friendly, informative, and responsive. I ordered the combo with Steak Diane and Herb-Crusted Salmon with broccoli as my side.  Both main items were cooked perfectly, and that sauce that came with the salmon was addictively good! The prices were on point for the entire experience.  I've always enjoyed The CF, but now even more so."
Gulsen B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,56,52,3.0,9/9/2017,"This restaurant is located on Bella Terra where is very good for shopping, theatre and more. The only reason I gave 3 star is foods are delicious.  Service is so slow, we waited like 30 mins for white chicken chili and cajun chicken fingers. Although the restaurant was not very busy we also waited like 15 mins for bill.  If you are in a hurry I don't recommend this place, the one in Fashion Island is way better."
