Gilbert S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,34,5,1.0,11/2/2014,Food is just not very good! We haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years so we decided to give it a try and boy was that a bad decision. The spaghetti and meatballs was undercooked but edible and my wife's shepherds pie unedibly gross! Service was okay but once we got our food we never saw our waitress again. We won't be back!
Muneet S.,"San Francisco, CA",238,77,17,3.0,10/18/2014,Just your basic Cheesecake Factory but a little bit more crowded because of families from Disneyland so it does get noisy and there is constantly a child whining or crying so not the ideal date spot if you want to talk to each other or have a quiet ambience. Other than that the workers here are nice and they do validate parking. I always get the miso salmon since it melts in your mouth and is so freaking delicious and I can just fake to myself that it's healthy since it's salmon and I usually get it with brown rice and try to ignore the fact that the buttery/creamy sauce is making up for the calories and fat I might have been offsetting.
Robin W.,"Ivoryton, Essex, CT",44,40,2,3.0,3/10/2016,3000 miles away and it's the same as home. Always consistent. Order the mac and cheese burger.
Eva L.,"Los Angeles, CA",889,1039,1707,4.0,11/7/2013,"This is only for their cheesecake. We ordered the red velvet cheesecake for a friend. It's a bit pricey but it tastes sweet, decadent, and delicious!"
Bree B.,"Orange, CA",313,4,,5.0,2/23/2016,"So me and my girlfriend decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory for some dinner and right when you walk in, it is just so beautiful, but besides the unremarkable decor there is hostess that are very kind and as my request for a both, they gladly take me there. I don't remember who my server was but she was absolutely amazing, so friendly and on top of her tables making sure they have everything they need. She made sure we had refilled waters and nice warm complementary bread and butter that was out to us with in 2-5 minutes. We order the loaded Tator tots that were delicious and 2 orders of the fettuccine Alfredo which is always so wonderful. Towards the end of dinner we needed some boxes for our food and she gladly suggested to box them up for us even the little sour cream for the tots. All in all it was a great night with great service and amazing food, defiantly will be back soon."
Val -.,"Los Alamitos, CA",83,76,309,5.0,6/15/2013,"This is my first time at this location. We usually go to the one in Huntington Beach at Bella Terra which I haven't reviewed yet. This location is by Disneyland, lots of tourists and locals. The downside is you have to pay parking after an hour. Restaurant is pretty; the usual high ceilings, huge posts and over the top decor with neutral colors which makes the whole place feel relaxed. Lighting was pretty dark though, needs just a little brighter light. Servers are friendly, knows the menu and fast. Bread was warm and good. Love the brown bread. Their pastas never disappoint. Huge portions, flavors are on point, and they don't skimp on the chicken pieces which are big. Food is perfectly priced for the amount they give you; serves two people for each plate. They have a wide variety of cheesecake, and all the ones I've tried is good.  Cheesecake Factory will always be a favorite restaurant for any occasion or any day."
Erwin R.,"Cupertino, CA",268,195,1448,1.0,1/3/2013,"I ate here last week,  and it was not packed at all.   Positive:  The location of this Cheesecake Factory is right next to Disneyland resort.  Negative:  took a long time to take our order,   When it was taken, it took 50 mins for us to get our food. :( The service was horrid!  I asked the server about 5 times for a glass of water, table bread and that took a while.  There was a couple who was seated about 15 minutes after we were and they ordered and received their food about 15 mins later, before we did The server, came by after I asked the 3rd time about our food and he said he would check.  Guess what, he never came back until our food was delivered.   At about the 45 minute mark, 2 of our 3 dishes came out.  The last one to come out was the Hamburger.  I tell you, 2 small pasta dishes and a regular hamburger with fries, took 50 minutes.  This by far is the worse experience I have ever had a major restaurant chain.  I/we were so tempted to get up and leave but then I would not have any food.   I did ask for the manager, gave him my mind and ask him what the heck was going on?  Outside of trying to sell me on when the server took our order (which also took a long time), I also brought up about the other group across the way sat down a long time after we did and they got their food first.  He did comp us for the burger in the end but the waste of time was just unpleasant.  :( Cheescake factory Anaheim, Ca get your house in order!  I should have read the reviews first! Too bad I had to give a star, I would have left none to be honest."
Conetha R.,"Sonora, CA",13,32,31,4.0,2/27/2015,"Food was good and service was great! We came in on a weekday to celebrate a birthday after a long day at Disneyland. Our server, Francisco was amazing! My party of five ordered a bunch of small plates and apps to share, as well as some cheesecake to go. Total cost came to around $150 which wasn't bad considering how much food we got and how quickly we all filled up. We got our drinks and food in a timely manner. Francisco checked on us frequently. He brought out a small sundae with a candle and even sang a birthday song. Great experience, we will be back!"
Joe M.,"Eastvale, CA",0,28,10,1.0,10/11/2015,Received the worst service from Allena D today... She was non existent our entire breakfast we had to get service from other Waiters/Waitresses... I'll never eat here again!!!
Gabriel G.,"Anaheim, CA",4,11,14,3.0,2/22/2015,"My reviews are simple and to the point. Food is 3 stars. Quality of food just went south from what I remember cheesecake used to be. The lettuce wraps is just not the same in flavor and quality.  Service is 3 stars. Although she was nice, she was not attentive on our needs. It took a good 15 minutes before we were taken our orders and did not check on us as needed."
Antonette B.,"San Diego, CA",15,27,35,3.0,9/3/2014,"Go to thos place often when I take my staff out to grub. Keepin it short and simple...ordered lunch portion of orange chicken with white rice. The chicken is so, so for me. I've ordered this a few times and after today. Won't be ordering it anymore. Just not my flavor I'm lookin for.  I love how it is crunchy tho. It's not drenched in the orange sauce. Some are tossed in the sauce better than some. I'm not a huge fan of the sauce. Don't know if I'm used to the ""Chinese"" orangy flavor I'm accustomed to but it's like a bitter taste to me. So I drizzled my food with their balsamic vinegrette dressing. Now that, is a yummy dressing! I dip my bread there too. Lunch portion as u can see is still large. Only ate half. Stuffed mushrooms are juicy and lots of flavor. Never fails me. :) I'm obsessed with their frozen iced mango drink. Non-alcoholic drink. So delish! Cheesecake...well we all know that's already yummi.  All the waitress and waiters are awesome."
david d.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/14/2016,They had 30 people working including kitchen staff and hostess and bartenders and had eight customers. We and another family sent back all meals . Not just because it took 32 minutes to get two orders of pancakes a child's chicken finger order and a so called fresh shrimp scampi. Well they all being cold because all the staff save a pie person and bartenders were all doing empty painting frame selfies... The scampi was reheated and cold... One shrimp was a tempura shrimp another a beer battered one .... All reheated shellfish...very dangerous . I wonder how tourists get sick and have no recourse....
Mark S.,"Anaheim, CA",77,7,,5.0,5/14/2015,"I love this place the avocado spring rolls are great. then I get the jambalaya. it is amazing. nice vibe, great food, and nice servers. you cant ask for more"
James B.,"Orange, CA",103,2,,5.0,8/19/2015,"This review isn't really directed at the food, but more for the service. All I have to say about this place is if and when you do go ask for Carnell to be your waiter. Possibly the best service you can ask for. Had my entire family of 13 dying of laughter and did everything in his power to make sure our experience was the best (food came out in a timely manner and there wasn't a single complaint). Five stars no doubt."
Dave S.,"Orange, CA",0,8,,4.0,9/11/2016,"Just had our second ""everything pizza"". Pretty darned good. Delivered by DoorDash and not all that hot, that's why not five stars. To be fair, it's quite a distance from the Factory to us so bear that in mind. Pizza, a 10, delivery, a 9.5, overall, it's gone and it was goooood."
Brandon W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",9,1,,1.0,8/24/2014,"Unfortunately I can't write a full review about the food, because I was just told that they have a minimum for party sizes at the moment and they couldn't seat just 2 people, although it's subject to change later. Unreal.  I won't bother wasting my time here just to be turned away twice, nor will I recommend this place to any guests that happen to stay at the hotel I work for down the street."
Kevin B.,"Langley, Canada",3,121,53,5.0,7/12/2014,"Just excellent!  We're never disappointed!! Came here early Saturday night for dinner.  Got in right away and our server was there right away greeting us and taking drink orders. Of course the menu is absolutely gigantic but we haven't had anything that wasn't fantastic.  Kids had mini corn dogs and chicken strips.  We had Cuban sandwich and taco salad.  Everything was great. Our server was fantastic - thanks Jose!  You were one of the best servers we've had all trip! Desert is of course all about the cheesecake.  My wife had the S'more cheesecake - it was amazing!  Toasted marshmallow, graham cracker, and chocolate.  I had my usual fav - red velvet. We just love the Cheesecake Factory!  Yes, sometimes the line ups are huge but it's always worth it.  Staff are fantastic and food is top notch.  Don't miss out!"
Sean O.,"Garden Grove, CA",34,63,,4.0,4/30/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory a couple times in my life so far. I will say, I decided to give it four stars: 1 for the great atmosphere, 1 for the friendly service, 1 for the variety of items on the menu to choose from, and 1 for the excellence of the food.  I probably would have given it 5 stars, but the only thing that costed this place that one star was the speed of the service. I don't recommend going there unless you have more than two hours to spare."
Julie T.,"Artesia, CA",7,16,24,1.0,12/12/2014,"The manager Mario here obviously doesn't value about customer service. He definitely needs to work elsewhere, if you're going to talk to customer and about them to your staff with ""you can stay or leave"" attitude. The service for seating our party was horrible, and the MANAGER was a completely rude. Basically telling me that out f this whole big restaurant that there's only one big table and that you're seating tables of 10 right in front of me.  Not even once he apologize for the wait and delay. That was 2-3 hours wait. Left beyond livid and never coming here!!!"
Jessica B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/6/2014,So we just go back here from this place tonight and boy our service was ok but what they did was horrible!! We had a $50 gift card to the cheese cake factory and it's not like we were being cheep about getting food or drinks our whole bill came to about $80. When we paid it said the remainder was $26 but when I paid with the credit card it said $38! that's an $11 difference over there that is about the price of an appetizer or small meal. I maybe thought oh was there a hidden fee for using a gift card that doesn't seem right. So we ask our waitress and she seems almost mad in a way and she takes the bill back.  I kid you not we waited almost 10 minutes until she came back with our correct total this was unreal I shouldn't have tipped her but thought maybe it's not her fault but the whole situation just seems extremely shady probably NOT coming back.
