Sanjay C.,"Anaheim, CA",69,1,,5.0,2/1/2016,"Besides the food being great, our server Ivan was by far the best server I've ever had. He was always there to give us whatever we needed and he did so with charisma. He was able to help us make decisions when we had questions and gave one of our party the exact thing he wanted. Kudos to you Ivan! All in all, great food, great service, and an overall great time!"
Antonia M.,"Novato, CA",10,284,67,3.0,10/23/2014,just ok.  We ate here in Anaheim and it is pretty much the same as everywhere else except the service was really good.  Cheesecake Factory seems to be a place with too many menu options and it always takes a long time to get your food.
Kristen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,172,8,3.0,12/29/2014,This place was good. I seem to be going on a Cheesecake factory binge. This was one of 3 in 2 weeks.  We had a party of 10 and they were adamant about not taking a reservation. So when we arrived we had to wait about 15 minutes. Then they sat us outside with heat lamps so people were cold/hot.  The service was good. They were very attentive and good about refilling water. Food was good.  Parking is yuck. The only available parking is the mall parking. Then you're walking about half a mile to get to entrance of the restaurant which is on the far corner of the block. It's a nuisance and I would have expected better planning from a chain like the Cheesecake factory. Mall parking is validated at the restaurant.
Mark M.,"Aiea, HI",461,434,310,5.0,11/9/2012,"Liz, thank you for an amazing dining experience during our vacation in Anaheim. You did everything right. You gave us space and didn't rush us when we were ordering. You filled our water promptly. You checked in on us often. You even helped us choose the right cheesecake for dessert when I was torn between two of them. You were friendly, professional, and comforting. The food was pretty darn good as well! I ordered the chicken picatta. It came with perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken breasts and a nice mound of angel hair pasta. There were a ton of capers spread around the dish as well. And as for the cheesecake? Liz suggested that we try the Oreo cheesecake, and we did. I had no idea how good an Oreo cheesecake could possibly be until I tasted the one from The Cheesecake Factory. It was simply sublime. Very rich, but sublime."
Courtney B.,"Corona, CA",98,103,65,5.0,12/22/2015,Always LOVE Cheesecake Factory! Their Red Velvet Cheesecake is to DIE for. I always get their Chipotle chicken pasta. Never disappointed! The prices are great and I always have more than enough to take home for another meal. Will be back again and again and again!
Julia W.,"Stockton, CA",44,171,,5.0,1/26/2016,My family and I ate here before heading to the airport to head home. I loved the natural lighting that came in through the large windows. Service was great and the food is always delicious.
Mrs. B.,"Suisun City, CA",33,14,5,1.0,5/6/2016,"We ate here for my birthday dinner..  and is our very first time..at cheesecake factory. it was very busy with alot of people waiting outside the door. our wait was short 20mins only which was great! However... the food we ordered wasn't up to par.. I had fried calamari, no flavor, so I dip it in the 2 sauces they come with, which made it taste even worse! My crab cakes, I swear was burnt, and the crab doesn't taste right!  my family agreed it doesn't taste good at all.. so my husband orders a Factory burger which he asked for medium well done. when he got his burger it was medium rare, with a little blood. so he told his waitress jessica and she took it back to the chef. minutes later a gentleman named john who introduced himself as the manager came over and apologized for the inconvenience and offered my husband fresh hot fries.. well we never seen the fries.. so that was all talk. the bread they serve is HARD!   as far as their cheesecakes well, at least I can say that was very good! As far as I'm concerned, we will not be returning to Cheesecake Factory ever again, whether it's here in Anaheim or back home... Like I said this is my first time here, and my last..."
Shilesse D.,"Compton, CA",162,7,11,1.0,1/4/2016,"First time at this location and it seemed as though our server was too body with everything else to help us. We did not get any drink refills, couldn't get any clean silverware, and every time we needed something, we had to ask someone else because he kept flying by our table making sure he didn't make eye contact. On top of that, my pasta was undercooked and my shrimp were extremely overcooked but the sauce was tasty. I asked the dish be sent back and the manager was sent over to offer another selection that I passed on. I'm not so bothered with the food as with the rude server. With that being said, I will never visit this location ever again."
Nana D.,"Cypress, CA",0,25,,5.0,7/22/2016,Love the food! I just wish that they weren't so busy. Everything is so yummy ! Love the bread and they have such a large menu that you can try all sorts of food.
Lorna S.,"Chino Hills, CA",59,54,68,5.0,2/2/2016,"I went to this location for the first time, last Saturday around 430pm. We stopped by just for drinks and a slice of cheesecake. Lol how can you not get cheesecake when you go here?!... We were seated at the bar area. The decor is the standard Cheesecake Factory layout, which is beautiful!  Our server brought us water and bread and butter while we waited for our drinks. We received above excellent service!  and the bartender made our drinks too notch  I like my drinks to the point where I can't really taste the alcohol, but it tastes really good and it gives me a nice buzz  Lastly, omg, their cheesecakes! I haven't tasted all of them, but I'm sure they all taste like heaven! We got the Dutch Apple this time"
T D.,"Orange, CA",62,11,,3.0,5/2/2016,"This place seems to be hit or miss.  Last weekend while eating here, my daughter's corndog meal had to be returned because there were pools of grease inside the mini corn dogs.  The quality of the food really depends on what you order.  I tend to stick to salads and fresher items and am usually happy."
T B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,4,,1.0,4/28/2016,Don't go here if you have kids.  We called ahead and asked for an ETA on a large party.  Was told we are not allowed to tell you estimated wait times over the phone...but get here and we can see.  We get there in 5 minutes park in the parking lot and then go in...it's an HOUR wait.  Why they couldn't let us know before is silly.  So now trapped cause we parked and have to pay for parking and ending up at any restaurant that has a shorter wait.  When I asked the manager why you couldn't inform us that you were this busy or a range of wait time...he said that's hard to estimate.  Well when I walked in and there were 40 people in the waiting area I don't think that's hard to estimate.  It's a family place that is clueless about serving families.  Next up call to the corporate office...common sense should be practiced when possible.  They only get one star cause you have to give something to post a review.
Freddy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,52,49,5.0,1/15/2016,You can always count on fresh food here. When eating at the cheesecake factory there standard of food is always high and when you do not like a dish the simply remove it off your bill no hesitation. We will return for sure.
Dharm S.,"Fresno, CA",1019,440,1585,5.0,7/6/2014,"I got a birthday coupon for CheeseCake factory from my in-laws and what better location to go, so me and my wife went to Disney's CheeseCake factory. The place is splendid and ofcourse the service was great as well. Our serve ""Ethan"" was a delight, He keep suggesting new items and was very helpful,  Do try this location, Worth a shot!!! And ofcourse, Dont forget to try ""Tripple truffle chocolate cake"""
Antonio L.,"Anaheim, CA",553,552,825,4.0,9/18/2014,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Very big dining room and bar. Very busy, for obvious reasons...The Disneyland Resort just down the street. Food is always great. The bar is a great place to grab a drink."
Justin P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",171,29,10,1.0,11/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory food is always good. That's a given. This review is given solely on our waitress Alenna. I am a server myself so I know how hard the job isn't. My girlfriend and I get there. Sit and wait 15 minutes before our waitress even speaks one word to us. And I'm watching her talk to other tables and give checks back to other tables. Finally we get greeted to a ""hi can I take your order"" not something like I'm sorry for the wait or even what we wanted to drink. Seemed like she was trying to get us out real quick. My girlfriend and I are both 20 year old college students. So I felt we got tip judge. Due to the fact she gave better service to those tables around us. I always tip 25%+ if the service is good. She earned her penny tonight tho."
Sam W.,"Anaheim, CA",206,168,1191,4.0,12/5/2012,"Okay so after going back to this particular Cheesecake Factory, it was much improved from the last visit! Both my husband and I decided to give it another shot so we took the plunge. We sat at the bar again, but not those tables that they had, we decided to just go ahead and sit right by the bar. We were noticed immediately, greeted with a welcome and got us water right away (much BETTER!) and this time we ordered the Tuxedo Cheesecake which is a mix of Layers of their Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate. It was DELISH! and YES this time the bartender (waitress) brought us REAL utensils! My husband thanked her for that.  Overall, attentiveness was much improved from the last visit and we were treated much better than before! We'll definitely come back for more cheesecake! :)"
Dee D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",50,104,53,5.0,11/19/2015,"We eat at Cheesecake Factories often. This by far is our best experience with any location, our server Brooke was the picture of customer service. Our food was cooked perfectly and we never had to ask for refills or ever look around for service. The decor inside is stunning and the energy in this place is great."
Sarah M.,"Miramar, New Zealand",0,25,2,5.0,8/6/2014,"Hopefully you get Cameron, the most awesome waiter ever! Our first ever visit to a Cheesecake Factory. While the food was great, the service was amazing. We visited in July 2014, the height of summer. It looked mega busy but we walked in off the street and only waited 10 minutes. The host and the girl who seated us were lovely, they must get so over the Disney crowds (we saw mega groups trying to get tables and getting huffy when they couldn't be seated straight away) but they never let it show. But our server, Cam, was the star of the show. Friendly, funny and extremely personable. There were 3 of us and he sat down beside me to help us order like an old friend! Just one of those people who has natural charisma. He almost correctly guessed we were from New Zealand, Australia is the next closest guess haha. When he saw my face at the size of my burrito (which was insanely huge) he cracked into this grin and made a joke about weight...lol I won't repeat it but we all cracked up. And the burrito was fricken delicious, apparently I made a good attempt on it. They don't call it a grande burrito for nothing!  We walked away full, with yummy cheesecake for later and huge appreciation for Cam's attentive and friendly service. It's awesome when a waiter doesn't just play out the stiff script and interacts on a personal level with customers. Keep up the fantastic work!"
Aaron S.,"Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,2.0,7/19/2014,"Lord.....this Cheesecake Factory. I ordered from the pastas and was not informed on the menu that what i ordered had any dairy, cream - MILK in general. every other one had dairy specifications, so i was confident in ordering that. i received the food and it did have cream. i had my server recheck with the kitchen. i had to refuse the meal since dairy makes me sick. *sad mind you, my server was nice throughout the service until that point. she had an attitude episode that i dismissed but my friends did not. saying things like ""you shouldve let me known about the dairy"" and ""if i had known...i couldve helped"" but it was being said in the way that caught us offguard. i ended up rushing an order of regular chicken salad and fell under her pressure.  in the end, it was the service that stuck in our mind for eating at Cheesecake.  i just hope management makes sure the service is impeccable! and when a server implies HELP is a main priority then HELP me feel better about a wrong decision, not feel punished. we all mistakes, but i've never made a customer feel uncomfortable like what happened at our table.  CUSTOMER SERVICE ORIENTED ENVIRONMENT AND IMPECCABLE, SINCERE SERVICE PLEASE! thanks"
