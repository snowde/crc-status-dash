Linda M.,"Buena Park, CA",50,6,7,2.0,1/18/2015,The service was good but I ordered the turkey & avocado sandwich which the meat was frozen. The cheesecake we ordered for my grand daughters birthday came falling apart..
Nick S.,"Richmond, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/20/2015,"Traveled 6 hrs down south for Disneyland and decided to check out garden walk. We saw Cheesecake Factory and it was perfect. Long waits don't bug me because I am used to how busy CF gets especially on weekends. We got drinks from the bar while we waited. 40 mins for 2 people isn't that bad. (Sucks to be people who are in a group of 12 or more.) I got the usual medium rare ribeye, no fries, side of mash and greens. Food came fast. Service was great. Thank you!"
Sargon K.,"Manteca, CA",43,49,5,4.0,6/23/2014,We are regular Cheescake Factory goers between the Bay Area and this was our first time going in after a Disneyland trip. It was not that packed on a Sunday early-afternoon. We just got done from the park and 3 restless kids.  Could not have ended up with a nicer waitress. She was so considerate and about making our time there comfortable. She was also very helpful with giving us tie bits about Disneyland that we did not know about.  We were definitely pleased. The food is consistent with other Cheesecake Factory locations so there is really no review needed for it.
Diamond C.,"Tucson, AZ",1,66,10,2.0,7/26/2015,"When we first walked in, there were 7 employees standing at the podium, yet no one greeted us and we waited to be seated as if they didn't see us. The food was horribly bland.  My party ordered chicken, steak, shrimp and bbq pork and the complaint was the same from everyone-bland.  Even their salad dressing lacked flavor. Obviously everything was overpriced but definitely not worth it."
Rylee N.,"Fullerton, CA",247,231,848,3.0,5/4/2014,"After reading through all the reviews, I came here with very low expectations and ready to argue if need be. Everything ended up being absolutely great! We got to the Factory around 9:45 ish on a Saturday night and I guess while prom was going on? So you would think that it was going to be an absolute nightmare, it totally wasn't! We got seated in less that 5 minutes, when we were told our table would take about 5-10 minutes, so I was really happy about that. Right away, a server came to our table, did his spiel and got our drink orders. My boyfriend did order something from the bar and I thought it was going to take long but again I was totally surprised when he brought it out very fast. The server was really great; his name was George and he was really nice, cracking jokes with us and checked up on us enough to where we didn't have to hunt him down for anything and he wasn't checking up so often to where it was annoying either. The only thing I will say I didn't like was the pricing; I mean, $18 for pasta is a little ridiculous, I like to think of what in really paying for and I don't think any pasta should be over $13 there because it's not THAT huge of a portion, but it is good, and I did go because I had a gift card so that's okay. We ordered the mint mojito ($11) which my boyfriend said was really good, avocado egg rolls ($10.95) also really good and came out about 5 minutes after we ordered, and the jambalaya pasta ($17.50)which came out literally a minute after the egg rolls. We never waited long at all for our food. Everything was tasty and then the cheesecake of course was just the best. With over 34 cakes to choose from, it was really difficult to choose; we ordered and Oreo cheesecake ($7.95) and a dutch apple streusel ($7.50) which the server recommended. Thank god he told us to get that one because it was SO good, it was like eating a carmel apple pie with cheesecake. And of course the Oreo one was amazing because it had layers of cookie, chocolate, cookies and cream and chocolate chips!! These are huge and rich slices so they can totally be shared after a big meal. All and all, my boyfriend and I had a great dinner and a very positive time here."
Vivian H.,"Corona, CA",317,169,472,5.0,9/5/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favorite chain restaurants! The menu selection is HUGE and the customer service is usually excellent! My sister and I enjoy meeting up at this location whenever she's working in the area. Even though it's been a while since my last visit, and I can't remember the awesome server's name (but I have a pic), I still remember how great my overall experience was!  My server was cool, laid back, and I let her order for me. As a pescetarian, of course I was in the mood for fish, but I wanted something kind of light but still yummy for lunch. She ordered salmon (I think it was Miso) over mashed potatoes w/snow peas). I vaguely remember this being on the eat light & eat right menu as well and the food was delicious! Judging from the picture, I think my friend had gumbo or something with meat, veggies, and rice.  I'm pretty sure the server ordered us a delicious slice of cheesecake for us to share afterwards based on what we both like (carmel, chocolate, etc). That's what I get for waiting so long to write my reviews! SMH Anywho, all of the food was FAB and the service was fantastic! This is one of my favorite CF locations!"
Jesse W.,"Ontario, CA",0,86,32,4.0,10/6/2015,"Tuesday night.  Walked in.  No wait.  Seated and greeted by waiter.  Took our drink order and left.  Another guy drops off some bread and butter to start. Waiter returns and takes our food order.  Ordered calamari.  Came out within minutes, literally.  Even our waiter was surprised.  Calamari was crisp and airy.  Gave shrimp cocktail sauce and cucumber ranch dip. About 10 minutes later our food comes out.   Chicken with scampi sauce over pasta.  Was very rich and heavy.  A lot of olive oil and butter on my plate.  Plenty of chicken.  Only able to finish half. Son got carbonara.  Pretty good.  Very ""bacon-y"".  Very filling also.  He barely finished half. Wife got miso salmon with white rice.  This was very good.  Salmon had nice teriyaki glaze over it.  Plate had nice tasty miso sauce at bottom.  White rice evened out the saltiness of the dish. Waiter was ok.  They pack your left overs for you.  Park in the adjacent Garden Walk lot and ask for validation at the restaurant.  You get 1 hour free.  With validation you get an extra hour."
Michael B.,"Westminster, CA",99,97,52,4.0,3/19/2014,"Pleasantly surprising! It's been ages since I've eaten here and I don't understand why I haven't gone in such a long time. I've always been a firm believer that a large menu makes it harder to keep food fresh but I guess I was wrong in this case. I was kinda feeling like chicken Madeira that night but It sound waaay to heavy for dinner on a Tuesday. I couldn't make up my mind so I went with a burger instead since they never really disappoint. I got the Smokehouse BBQ burger. The beef was succulent to the point where it dripped it's delicious juices all over the place but the onion rings were still fairly crispy throughout my meal. The burger wasn't soggy at all which is kind of impressive now that I think about it. The meal came out with little saucers of BBQ and ketchup that definitely wasn't enough if I were to actually finish all my fries. You'll need to order up If you're like me and love to drench everything in ketchup when it comes to fries and a burger. The pricing isn't too bad either. 12 dollars for my burger which is pretty standard when it comes to ""gourmet burgers"". The experience has changed my thinking of cheesecake factory for the better. I definitely wouldn't mind dining in with friends again since the atmosphere is really chill and relaxing."
Roy A.,"San Diego, CA",4,97,,5.0,5/6/2014,"Best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been too! Service was top-notch, and all the staff greeted me and helped each other out. Food was excellent! Only down side is that we had to pay for parking in the garage :( Other than that, I give it an A!"
Erin P.,"San Pedro, CA",148,262,15,4.0,1/29/2013,"I came here for a going away party for a coworker.  I was impressed with the service and how they handled our party of 18.  They sat us outside and our waiter took care of all our needs.  He refilled our drinks on time and was pretty accommodating when we all asked for separate checks. (we warned him when we were ordering, btw)  I have only been the TCF a few times, and was never really happy with my food selection.  Their menu is huge, its hard to know what you should get.  I was recently expressing my concerns to a different coworker before this event and she suggested I try the burgers.  OMG, she was so right.  I got the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries; it was beyond delicious.  Hands down, one of the best burgers I have ever had."
Manuel C.,"Lynwood, CA",0,19,1,5.0,7/27/2016,This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory. The service is always great and the food is good. I also appreciate how Sean (spelling) and the rest of the staff are very helpful and were able to accommodate my large party at a short notice. Thanks again.
Cornelis T.,"Turnhout, Belgium",30,212,59,5.0,4/24/2014,"This place was packed on a tuesday night in september! It was getting late but this place was as full as it gets. We had to wait only five minutes for a spot though and when we sat down we were AMAZED by the menu. CCF's menu is just incredible, i never had a longer menu except the time i went to the bar with the 700+ beers. The food itself was delicious! Def. a good experience and now i know that when i can't find a place to eat, and yelp isn't helping me out either that day i can always go to a cheesecake factory nearby.  Sadly there was a sign near the counter that no 'penny' jokes were allowed. :("
Lena P.,"Ontario, CA",21,486,1384,5.0,1/13/2013,"Been here twice so far and had a great dinner both times. Very busy even on a Thursday night, so be prepared for a wait as they don't take reservations. Dinner: Skinnylicious Grilled Chicken - you can ask for brown rice to make it healthier, and it comes with asparagus and a salad on top which is a nice combo. Also Evelyn's Pasta is good for a veggie option as it's pasta with a lot of veggies. Cheesecake: Tiramisu tastes like a cake which was really good, and the Oreo Cheesecake is delicious! Parking: In the Structure - the restaurant validates for 2 hours, then you have to pay."
Elene G.,"San Clemente, CA",10,28,,4.0,7/1/2015,The Cheesecake Factory will be my doom. I will get fat off of those cheesecakes alone. All the cheesecakes that I've had have been good! I especially love that they have sugar-free cheesecakes so my dad can eat it too (he's borderline diabetic).
Jenny U.,"San Diego, CA",7,28,84,3.0,10/11/2014,"Their cheesecakes are fabulous especially i love original and godiva.chocolate one. their miso salmon is my favorite dish from.cheesecake factory. I visit cheesecake factories only because of these two menu. I am personally leaving this review for this branch because i visit here the most! Comparing to others, their service and food are ordinary. i gave three stars because i dont like their spaghettis and especially this location is too loud and busy."
Courtney A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,14,,4.0,7/11/2016,Came here with friends for refreshments recently. I'm usually scarf of chains but the chicken Madeira was great and my boyfriends hibachi steak was to. Our waiter was really funny and attentive. We had a nice time
Jennifer M.,"Anaheim, CA",67,48,3,3.0,3/25/2014,"I'll admit, the hype about The Cheesecake Factory might be a little much... I came in a few weeks ago with the hubs after taking in a movie. Having never been to CF before, I made a point of checking out the menu online. I knew that this particular location would probably be really busy because of its location -- right smack dab in the middle of the resort area, a stone's throw from Disneyland. So, it's probably smart to figure out what to get before you go. There are no prices online, so I had a few things in mind in case some things were too pricey.  We get to the restaurant at about 8 pm, and it is as packed as I anticipated. There was a bit of a wait for a table, but we were seated within fifteen minutes. We were seated outside, but it was nice because it was quieter outside and there were heat lamps. Our waiter, Jared, was very pleasant and quick. He got our drinks and bread right away, and offered suggestions for food. The food was okay -- we got some burgers that were pretty good, but not worth $12. We got a few slices of cheesecake to go. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and the hubs got some caramel turtle cheesecake thing. Both were very good!  Basically, the place is great if you want to stop in for dessert or if you feel like splurging."
Joanie D.,"Lahaina, HI",16,48,11,5.0,11/2/2015,Great customer service amazing staff no stressful waiting and the bread was sooo warm and nummy and our food was delicious.
Matt T.,"Mill Valley, CA",34,114,43,3.0,8/17/2015,"Not too much to say because I think you know what you get. However, that's pretty good! The food is what it is here and it's a great place to brings the kids. It's a chain.. yes but I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. Over the past 30 years, I think I've been to the CF hundreds of times... I shit thee not."
David W.,"Hemet, CA",0,14,,2.0,7/6/2016,"Great atmosphere lousy food. My wife and I went here after an Angels game and a failed attempt from me to get her to eat Street meat off of one of the people barbecuing on the back of their trucks. Was about a 30 minute wait which we don't mind because you pretty much wait any place you go in California. Absolutely love the atmosphere when we went in. We sat outside on the patio , server was nice enough but seemed like he was stretched between serving too many tables. When the food arrived it looked good, and that was the best part of it. It was barely warm , my wife's pasta dish had no flavor whatsoever, she said she could have gotten a better pasta from the frozen section at the grocery store. My dish was average at best. I think if this place focused more on making less dishes then they can make those dishes taste a lot better and get the food out quicker. Did not live up to the atmosphere of the restaurant, wish we would have gotten that street meat."
