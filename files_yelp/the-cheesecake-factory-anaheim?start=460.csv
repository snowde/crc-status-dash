Edgar O.,"Riverside, CA",117,94,154,5.0,7/20/2015,Always had been and still been one of my favorites places in the area. I personally come for two things the avocado rolls and the four cheese pasta I'll totally recommend those and the service always outstanding
Sindy M.,"Stanton, CA",94,4,6,1.0,6/15/2016,"This is very disappointing , it was my coworkers birthday on 6/14 and we decided to go on our lunch to pick up a the original 10 inch cheese cake that we had pre ordered on 6/13 around 9pm to be picked up at 2pm. We left early to pick up gave the name of who ordered it and there was no cheesecake. At this point it was about 2:30 and no cheese cake. Jessica who was waiting in our office called and they told her that no one took any order  and it was not ready, so I super upset at this point and I'm trying to be calm becuase we needed a cake for her birthday surprise.  The manager comes and tells us if we had 2 more minutes at this point what else can I say. So I wait .... The cheesecake comes out 10 minutes after, they gave me a slice of another cheesecake for the inconvenience. We got back to the office and this is what we got.... Full price charged for a soggy cheesecake and we were late back to work."
Stephanie V.,"Pomona, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2016,"The worse customer service, I called to place an order for a cheesecake the night before explained I needed the cheesecake for the next day at 2 that gave them more than enough time to get it ready. I had a co worker pick it up because I was busy so I placed the order under her name gave all my info. When they went for the order they claimed it was never placed and went around it when I finally got my order it was half ass made melted and did not even taste what they charged. I would personally never go here again."
Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",533,677,2406,3.0,11/27/2010,"There's only a few things I order here that I think are worth paying for, the rest, blah.   1. Red Velvet Cheesecake  2. Shepperd's Pie 3. Avocado Egg Roll  4. Tie Lettuce Wrap  5. Jambalaya  6. Pasta Da Vinci  7. Garlic Noodles  8. Steak Diane  That's pretty much it.  The rest of the menu, not my type of food."
Karen S.,"Modesto, CA",11,9,,5.0,9/11/2015,"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about. I read through them before deciding to come, but decided to come any way. I don't care for the location. I'll admit, I'm lazy. I don't like to walk, especially after a meal, or with 3 kids in tow. I didn't have to wait at all (I guess it depends on the time you choose). I came about 5pm on a weekday. Server was friendly. Drinks were great. Food was good. We enjoyed ourselves."
Stephanie S.,"Newport Beach, CA",72,36,4,2.0,8/11/2015,"Horrendous wait times! Freezing cold restaurant! Toilets keep running--we are in a drought, people! Call a plumber or mark the stall Out of Order. Good thing the food is consistently decent and the desserts are delicious or we would boycott this establishment. Lots of room for improvement!"
Carissa U.,"Lakewood, CA",303,378,622,4.0,3/1/2014,"Happy Hour in the bar from 4-6pm. $5 drinks and apps. Worth it and can get crowded. We stopped in Friday night and snagged the last table. We ordered avocado eggrolls, crab wonton, crab and artichoke dip, chicken sliders, small salad, with a cosmo and iced tea for $35! I mean what a deal. Good thing a friend of ours joined us, otherwise we would of had a ton of leftovers. Overall food was good, service was so-so, but the food came out fast. Nice stop before catching our movie at 7pm.  Note: If you're seeing a movie, just validate your ticket there. You get 4hrs opposed to 2hr from the resto."
Robert M.,"Anaheim, CA",214,72,75,5.0,8/6/2015,Well I have to say one of the best experiences I've ever had eating out. Upon arrival the hostess jumped through hoops to make sure that my girlfriend and I had seating at a section tucked away and a little secluded. I thought I arrived on Wednesday...  I was looking forward to their wild mushroom soup but unfortunately I showed up on Thursday that soup was not available the waitress who was incredible her name was Nichole she introduced me to other soups by allowing me to sample the selection and I have to say every Soup was phenomenal. I now know where I will eat out if I want great service and great soup not to mention their main course (Steak Diane) and of course their cheesecake but most of all the service I received on the front in from the hostess all the way to Nichole prize winning service. Thank you and I will see you again.
Kristel Y.,"Studio City, CA",306,371,509,4.0,10/11/2012,"I think this Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative to eating dinner at Disneyland (especially if the park closes early and you're still hungry). It's about a five minute drive from the park and it's open pretty late, so bonus points for that. One week while my family was in town, we went to this location two nights in a row. Considering it was nearly 11:30pm, it was pretty crowded, but on both nights are servers were fairly attentive. As with all Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the portions are huge and if you don't order cheesecake with your meal, it's like you're spitting in their face (not really, but you should try the cheesecake).  There's a private lot for the shopping center where the restaurant is located. I'm not sure if you need to get your parking validated if you go there earlier in the day, but when we've gone at like 11pm, there is no one in the guard booth, so it is freee."
Anthony S.,"Seattle, WA",379,451,221,2.0,4/22/2012,"The kitchen plan for this place must be ""... Lets maximize the number of dishes we can prepare with a certain inventory of ingredients.""  Huge menu.  Everything tried pretty much chain casual dining average.  Particularly dull was the Mexican chicken soup, Taquitos, hanger steak, individual pizza dull and soggy. Meat loaf was billed as a very special dish.  It was the meat loaf that gives meat loaf a bad name.   Service was good.   Drinks watered down. Pretty much what I expected."
Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,3.0,3/24/2014,"We were on vaca in the land of Mickey and decided to wander over to Cheesecake Factory even though it required us to drive. Not because our hotel was that far but because we didn't want to torture the little one with more walking after an all day at Disneyland. We GPS'ed our way over to the parking garage and were kind of sticker shocked. It was not cheap so kind of a bummer to get to this strip of restaurants (They had a McCormick's as well as PF Chang's as neighbors).  I hail from land of Seattle where parking 'is' expensive and I was surprised to see that Seattle was cheaper than here.  The lines were poured out onto the sidewalk as well as all seats taken inside the lobby. I was able to snag a seat since a group got seated before us.  Our total wait time was estimated to be around 20 mins. It took about that amount of time so nothing exciting to report there.  What was interesting to see was that there were several people who had pagers that had gone off and still had to wait for a seat once they turned in their pagers. Not sure where the disconnect was but was a little annoying for those people. As for food, we were seated in a booth in the back by the restrooms. Which was ok with me as we had our little one with us and she wasn't feeling well (read: sleepy and on Mommy's chest).  We ended up with two servers for our party of two because apparently they were in the middle of shift change. So that meant that our 'new' server didn't fully know our drinks and he didn't check on us but once. Kind of that annoying side of Cheesecake where they are so large and have every possible seat filled for dinner that you can often be left alone for way too long.  I ordered the BBQ salmon despite getting fresher salmon back home as I was missing home. I was so disappointed to have my salmon come out baked.. with BBQ sauce literally slathered on top post-bake. How I have known BBQ salmon is to be baked WITH sauce on it so it actually marinates and cooks into the fish. How sad (and expensive at almost $20)."
Kimiko G.,"Fullerton, CA",5,34,25,4.0,7/26/2015,Locals went & had a very nice brunch with the family... the food was awesome... & the server was amazing Ivan took care of us. Great to know they still had a lunch special on a weekend some restaurants don't. My Husband enjoyed his combo plate chicken madera & shrimp... Dutch apple cheesecake was a great starter lol
Noelle W.,"Long Beach, CA",13,20,,3.0,7/22/2015,"Came here for dinner and it was a typical CF experience, I guess. I decided to try something I'd never had so I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. ""Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce."" The chicken was decent, the pasta was okay, veggies were good. The sauce wasn't as spicy as I was led to believe but I'm not really complaining. I would probably order it again but I wasn't big on this location. I usually go to the HB location and something about the food does seem to taste better. Also, close to Disneyland so a lot of kids are all over the place as expected."
Daniel L.,"Tustin, CA",96,16,16,4.0,8/16/2015,Show up earlier for dinner or else it gets too crowded. The food is pretty good and our go to dish is always the Lemon Herb roasted chicken. Of course it's hard to get out of there without their cheesecake.
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,4.0,1/6/2014,"Even on New Years Eve, we had superb service and food. We had dinner there, but I'm sure they serve at other times of the day. Have the jambalaya with linguini.....oh yeahhhhhh. The staff is required to memorize the entire menu, which is a feat in itself as it's larger than most restaurants I've been to. Great food, fast service, kalua desert was top notch. Can't rave enough. Bubba Gumps wanted the same price for what appeared to be much less offered. Seems more of a tourist attraction at Anaheim's. Not sure that I'd be satisfied."
Areli M.,"Santa Ana, CA",24,21,7,4.0,7/17/2014,We love this place. Food is delicious.  Stuffed mushrooms are my favorite along with farfalle pasta with mozarella on top. we almost always have great service.  really dislike being seated in their tiny table because our food doesnt fit. Cheescakes are delicious. Strawberry shortcake is great too. we come here often and even though i want to try something new i always end up getting the same plate all the time. Great place for dinner dates.
DrKrupali J.,"Long Beach, CA",40,3,3,5.0,9/6/2014,Have been here many times... the service is quick n polite... i like the bread thy serve at the start of a meal...Luv the food here... luv the ambiance...n of the cheesecakes... out of the world yummy.. must must visit
Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,4.0,1/11/2012,"The best default Seriously, this place never disappoints.  I'll start with the negative, because there's really only one and that's wait time.  Since it's so close to the Disneyland Resort, if you hit this place up on the weekend, you could easily end up waiting 1.5 - 2 hours.  It gets crazy busy.  Whenever anything is that crowded, I get really uncomfortable and kind of disagreeable... I'm saying large crowds turn me into a prick.  So I stay away.  This review is based on lunches and early weeknight dinners.  Basically getting a head start on my senior dining lifestyle. Lunches and early weeknight dinners don't really have me dealing with large crowds.  10min wait time max.  The staff here is really friendly and very prompt - I was pretty surprised how quickly everything ran here and how many refills I got.  They easily surpassed my refill standards. The menu is huge and, for the most part, everything on it is pretty good.  Burgers, pasta, steaks, chicken - all super tasty.  AND Cheesecake Factory is still one of the few places to serve a large basket of delicious bread... I could easily fill up on their sourdough and squaw bread. And wife and I can't leave without sharing some cheesecake - I think it's mandatory that you order some.  This is usually a pretty easy decision - the red velvet cheesecake is most wonderfully glutenous thing I've ever had for dessert.  It's perfect size for sharing or if you're going through some issues in your life, it's still the perfect size for pigging out on it by yourself. It's really the best default place in town - large menu with great food and service.  After experimenting with so many over hyped and kind of crappy trendy joints (I'm looking at you, new hipsterish gatropubs like chapter one), I appreciate a franchised solid consistent experience like cheesecake factory.   If you can get around or deal with the crowds, you'll have to try to have a bad experience here."
Nele O.,"South Jordan, UT",207,40,73,5.0,6/12/2015,"This location always has a crowd because its located near Disney but waitress was great, no complaint with service. My lemon garlic chicken was great. The orange chicken was probably the best orange chicken I've tasted in a while and I eat chicken on a daily basis."
Anne T.,"Orange, CA",0,46,3,4.0,5/4/2016,We had a office luncheon - I was able to make a reservation for our group of 15.  Server and team was very efficient and accommodated all our requests.  Always checked on beverages and refill the bread basket while we waited.  I appreciate the variety on the menu which allowed our diverse group to have something to chose from.  Would come back again.  (Note:  Weekday - Lunch time is definitely much calmer than trying to come here at night)
