Jen L.,"Cypress, CA",2,36,10,1.0,6/8/2015,"Wow, the host here is unbearably rude. The way these workers talk to you, they make you feel like the dumbest person the planet. It's loud in here and I can't hear what you're saying if you're using your inside voice. Don't repeat it to me like I don't understand. SO RUDE. Wow"
Robert B.,"La Jolla, CA",1009,346,347,1.0,9/30/2013,"My family and I decided to stop at this Cheescake Factory on the way back from Disneyland earlier this evening. We enjoy the Cheescake Factory in. Fashion Valley here in San Diego where the food is excellent with good service. We thought we would enjoy the same service at this Anaheim location.  Well we were disappointed. Even though our waitress was polite and efficient, the food server was rude and condescending. When she served us a bowl of soup she slid it across the table like she was a cook in the Navy chow hall. She was in such a hurry she couldn't slow down enough to properly serve the food (which appeared to be her only job by the way).  We were a little taken aback by her abrupt manner but we let it slide.  However later I mistook her for our waitress and I asked her for another glass of wine. She did not even respond to my request but instead gave me a look that showed me and my family that she didn't  want to either take the time nor be bother with such a request as a customer asking for something. Everyone at my table was appalled by her look of disdain. What made matters worse is that we were there to celebrate my step-daughter's birthday.  I requested to speak to the manager because of this woman's attitude and requested that she and her negative energy stay away from our table. The manager was cool-he apologized and listened to my complaint about this young lady and comped us a free glass of wine and dessert. But our bill was expensive and we certainly did not need any attitude from the staff.  I personally feel these restaurants in Anaheim get tired of dealing with the Disneyland crowd. Well guess what bitches? It it wasn't for the tourism dollars your ass would be on unemployment. So brush up on your sorry ass customer service skills."
Joyce K.,"Washington, DC",228,27,3,4.0,7/21/2014,"After a long day, we went to visit the Cheesecake Factory.  It has been a while since our last visit to this restaurant, and this time we tried the Anaheim branch.  We ordered Chicken pot stickers, Chicken Bellagio and Original Cheesecake.  Chicken Bellagio and Cheesecake were delicious 5 stars, but I deducted 1 star since the Pot Stickers were very salty.   The service was excellent!  Our server was Ariel (I think that's how you spell it), she was very attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended for those who love to try different foods when near the Disney Anaheim."
Angelena G.,"Orange County, CA",42,79,43,4.0,4/19/2014,"I've been coming to this location for four years and I've never been disappointed. Well, I was a little disappointed when they took The Ritz off the drink menu; it was my favorite drink! The food is consistently delicious and the service is always on point. It can be a little quick, yet I never feel rushed, and sometimes quick is a good thing. It really is the servers and their excellent attitudes, knowledge of the menu, and the willingness to go the extra mile with substitutions or special occasions that keep me driving up to this spot!"
William W.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",35,49,31,4.0,9/6/2015,After moving from Raleigh I have missed our trips to Cheesecake Factory and took this opportunity while in Anaheim to get my fix. The food was good but let's be honest it's all about the Cheesecake - Red Velvet Cheesecake that is.
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,3.0,10/23/2011,"I really dig the size and look of this Cheesecake Factory.  The place by far the best looking CF I've been to.  The service this time around was not so much.  Our waitress was a bit on the rude side.   I'll let this slide b/c I was enjoying good company and eating some delicious red velvet cheesecake.  As always, CF always amazes me with the variety of dishes they serve.  I wonder how they could offer this extensive menu.  The food - 3 stars The service - 2 stars my great cheesecake 4.5 stars"
Kim G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",175,853,122,5.0,11/6/2013,"Came here on  Saturday date night with the wifey, and were quite pleased with the whole experience.  As we walked in, we figured a 30 min wait at most, but they stated 15 mins for two people.  Well we found two seats at the bar, and thats were we chose to eat as well..  So we sat down right away. Bartender was very nice and quick with serving our drinks and taking our order. i had the miso glazed salmon on a  bed of rice.  Probably the best salmon i have ever had at a restaurant.  Service was really good as well. No complaints.  Ambiance and lighting is a lil on the dark side, so fella's, this is a definite stop if u got one of those not to be seen girls.. Or if you want a nice romantic candle lit, or little lamp lit, dinner with your special someone."
Dianne B.,"San Jose, CA",15,39,4,5.0,5/26/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory at this location is splendid. Everyone we encountered was super nice and did not hesitate to fulfill the requests my party made. Although we found a few things wrong with our food, our server was responsive and took a professional approach. Thank you again!"
Erika G.,"Livermore, CA",368,754,449,4.0,5/14/2012,"Cheesecake Factories are all the same.  Same weird interior decorations, same huge portions, same menu.  Its perfect when you have been traveling and cannot think anymore or tired of making a decision.  Perfect when meeting with friends - it makes everyone happy because it has something for everyone.  we met friends who live in the area while we were staying at out timeshare close. Our waiter, Cameron, I think was his name.  He was very helpful and friendly!  excellent service!   I had the half order of BBQ Ranch Chicken salad.  Its my go to salad.  It has everything. Its perfect.  Dude had a sandwich I think, it came with fries. I cant remember which one but he ate it all.  One friend had the pecan crusted salmon - she loved it.  I cant remember what our other friend had, it was something he always gets because he knew right away what he was ordering.   This restaurant is located in The Garden Walk shopping/dining area that is really close to the Disney parks.  We walked here so I am not sure where or how parking is here.  Prices are typical and I think the same as the other CF's."
Caliph J.,"Lakewood, CA",4,18,12,3.0,7/6/2015,We started off to a bumpy start. Appetizer came out and I must say I was underwhelmed.  Our main dishes came out extra slow. Then the waitress whom was help us was sent home. At lease our main course taste good.
Gonzalo A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,25,19,3.0,8/27/2014,Place is always crowded I dont get why they have so many people in the front if they still make you wait with a bad attitude Garden Walk has no good stores its always dead only tourists
Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",128,288,84,5.0,12/8/2013,"I went with a small group and we were seated in about an hour on a Saturday night; very respectable waiting time.  We had an amazing server who was quick on our orders and quick on filling up / bringing new drinks of which we ordered a lot of.  She was also very sweet and worried about us driving (of which none of us were, we were in town for a con and staying down the street in a hotel).  All our food was cooked to order and amazing.  I'll likely be going back the next time I'm in Anaheim, as this was likely the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,5.0,6/15/2012,"This review is a little bit late, but I went to the Cheesecake Factory to just purchase cheesecake, and the girl behind the counter was quite helpful! Her name was Megan, and she was very knowledgeable about each one. She helped me picked out one that my boyfriend and I had never tried before (raspberry lemon), and it was scrumptious! I have, also, dined at this location a few times, and I don't have any complaints - the service has always been friendly, and the food has always been good. The menu is so vast that I usually can't decide what to choose (usually a pasta or salad), but it definitely helps that at the end is always a yummy slice of cheesecake (my favorite is key lime)!"
Terry J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,2,4.0,9/21/2014,The first time here. I was amazed at the great service and the food was great. Vanessa was one of the best servers I have had in a long time.
Zildheam D.,"San Diego, CA",478,671,1228,4.0,3/22/2012,"Good ol' cheesecake factory -  i hate the wait at this particular location...or actually, ANY location! the food is always good and portions are massive (but in a good way). Of course, the cheesecake is the bomb!"
Katelyn N.,"Anaheim, CA",31,2,,1.0,6/9/2015,Came here for lunch one day and the food took forever and my friend also found a piece of object that looked like a thread of eye lash.  The manager knew about the problem but chose to pass our table twice without saying anything.
Gem H.,"Las Vegas, NV",475,216,285,3.0,8/26/2013,"We were seated immediately. Thank God for a group of two. There were a lot of people eating on a Sunday night and was surprised we were able to get a table so quickly. The menu is crazy long, and couldn't seem to pick which one I wanted. It was decently priced for a restaurant. I think my favorite thing about TCF was the wheat bread they put out as a start...YUM. All in all our food was alright, but they took awhile to grab our check."
Iglesias F.,"Houston, TX",5,14,1,3.0,7/30/2015,"This it the perfect spot to eat after visiting Disneyland. The food is really good and the cheesecake was exceptional as one would expect, but the prices are high and the portion sizes are small. You don't exactly get what you pay for in this place."
Diana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,30,60,5.0,4/2/2015,Every time we come to Disneyland we make a stop at the cheese cake factory ... We always have great service and the food is always top notch. Love coming to this location
Juan O.,"Fountain Valley, CA",17,14,1,2.0,12/19/2015,"CF is my wife's favourite restaurant and this was our first time in this location. We were a party of 12 and my wife and I were there at 7:30 in order to get a table since CF doesn't take reservations. We were told that they wouldn't seat us unless the 80% of our friends arrived, which is pretty understandable. Well, everybody showed up around 8 and we still had to wait another 1 1/2 hr to be seated and eat. Totally ridiculous, considering that they refused to group together 3 tables and have us seated there. On top of that, one of the waitress made a mistake with the orders so one of my friends had to wait 30 minutes for his plate and......it was wrong too!! Very unpleasant experience. Management offered free dessert and a discount for the next time we wanna go there but that's not gonna happen. Considering the privileged location they should be used to large groups and offer a better service."
