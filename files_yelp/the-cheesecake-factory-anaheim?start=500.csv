Othon B.,"Whittier, CA",0,10,2,3.0,2/1/2015,There was no wait . For $18 my chicken costeleda plate what lame. Bread was dry and brittle.
Neville T.,"Chino Hills, CA",87,22,30,3.0,10/11/2014,"The food at this location is on the same level of any other Cheesecake Factory. Our service for the night, was not.  Our server, whose name slips my mind, was fairly slow at refilling waters and bringing the bread out. The bread came out the same time out entrees came out.  If you aren't sure what to get, try the Shepard's Pie or, if you like spicy food, the Jambalaya Pasta, can't go wrong with those.  What really bugged me about the server is that she got really rude towards the end. We asked for a split bill, and she let out the biggest and rudest sigh I've ever heard and said ""it's gonna take a while."" I just wanted to be like, ""it's okay, we got all night."" She brought our bill out like 3 minutes later so I don't know what she was complaining about.  In the end I won't be back, you got to pay for parking in a structure and our server was rude. I'll stick to the Cheesecake Factory in Brea or in Ontario."
Renee S.,"Mishawaka, IN",92,202,243,3.0,2/15/2012,"The food was decent and the beer was flowing.  The cheesecake was damn good.  I had the Reeses.  Mmmm.  I also had a great Arugala salad and then an ok bbq chicken pizza.  I wouldnt get the pizza again, but everything else was just fine.  :) Be prepared to wait, basically anywhere in the Gardenwalk restaurants.  Its a busy place, especially being so close to Disneyland.   Hop skip and jump across the street from the hotel."
Diana W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1005,1504,6696,3.0,4/7/2010,"Default! But always a good default place to go to with coworkers! :) although not my fav location but still good. continuing my check in.... its decent cheesecake factory, but I would highly recommend a different location if you had a choice?  I mean, its nice to eat here because its at Garden Walk Plaza and you can walk around after, but again if you're going for the food & had another Cheesecake Factory choice.. go to the other one haha"
Teri B.,"Raytown, MO",2,17,18,5.0,6/22/2015,"While on family vacation, we had our lunch. The food was great  and service was excellent!     I got the macaroni and cheese burger- Yummy vacay food at its best!"
MrsTekPro C.,"Sacramento, CA",31,39,11,4.0,1/8/2015,"Food is always great in this restaurant. I just noticed that the bread is not as soft as with the Sacramento branch, I think it's exposed too much (but that's ok, still as yummy)."
Tiffany C.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,12,,3.0,8/21/2014,"We visited The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night on our Disney vacation with friends. We don't have one in Canada, so we hardly go. I decided to share the Chicken Potstickers and the Spaghetti and Meatballs with a friend. The portion sizes were good enough to feed us both, since we also planned to order a Strawberry Cheesecake to share. The Potstickers were fine - the skin was very soggy due to the excess sauce, but I didn't expect much from an American restaurant doing something Chinese. The Spaghetti and Meatballs were fine. They were edible but not super delicious. Since we ordered our Cheesecake at the beginning of our meal, we were hoping the waiter would remember and we could ask for the bill so that we could return to the hotel, as it was late at night. Our server forgot (which was okay) but it took a long time for the cheesecake to come. We ordered one slice of cheesecake! Thank goodness the bill came at the same time, because it was getting very late. We had a good experience, but nothing mind-blowingly memorable."
Alex P.,"Long Beach, CA",10,58,20,4.0,4/8/2015,"Had a good experience at this location. Service is good, location is good and food arriving at our table was acceptable. Food quality was good, kind of over priced, but its ok..  i would recommend this location to others."
Angela K.,"San Jose, CA",363,280,40,3.0,4/1/2012,"We came at 5:30pm and man, there was already a CROWD. It was ridiculous. A lot of huge parties. It's been a very long time since I've been to any cheesecake factory that I forgot that a lot of large parties. Luckily there were only 4 of us so we got a table pretty quickly. However service was really slow. And when we did get service, our waiter wasn't even paying attention. We asked for all brown bread, he gave us the regular mix (with sourdough). My friend asked for the factory salad with no bleu cheese and she got a salad with bleu cheese. My water cup still had food pieces left on it.. pretty disgusting. Our waiter was there, he asked if everything was alright, etc but I kept thinking he knows how to ask the right questions but I don't think he listens hahah. It was a pretty hectic day. There's a cheerleading competition going on, lots of teeny boopers roaming the Disneyland streets. I got the Luau Salad. It is pretty big and it was delicious! I highly recommend it if you are going to eat a salad for dinner! YOM YOM. For dessert we got Vanilla Bean and the Red Velvet Cake cheesecakes. They were both great. I do looove their vanilla bean. MM MM! Overall, it was a good experience. Dinner lasted a long time because service was slow, it took a long time to get our drink order, our food order, to get our food, etc. Food is pretty good though =)"
Laura M.,"Cerritos, CA",4,114,,4.0,2/15/2016,Had a great time with the family here yesterday. Dynamite shrimp appetizer is delicious. The fish and chips were the best we've ever had. Not greasy at all! The little one loved the pizza... Loaded with pepperoni. Burger and onion straws had rave reviews. Unfortunately my Greek salad was drenched in dressing so couldn't eat much of that... But after letting them know our wonderful waiter took it off the bill. We will definitely be back!
Shannon P.,"Orange, CA",105,51,23,2.0,4/25/2015,I had hair in my food :( nice of them to take it off my tab but charge me for the small plate crab bites I ordered to replace it... very pretty place though and waitress was nice. Cheesecake was amazing... I'd hope so... wouldn't ever eat dinner here again but would definitely stop by for dessert.
Tuyet V.,"Riverside, CA",1,22,5,1.0,3/4/2016,"I didn't plan on leaving a review but after speaking to the manager about our experience, I didn't care for her response. She had an attitude but quickly changed it. We had stopped by this cheese cake factory for dinner. My husband ordered their Shepard's Pie, and I got the orange chicken. Great service, only to find out that same night my husband got food poisoning!!!He was throwing up and had diarrhea. He did not look or feel well. I called to let them know that they should check their ingredients to their Shepard's pie because I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone else. And luckily I didn't eat any of it because I'm pregnant. The managers response was ""we are sorry, but has it been confirmed by the doctors it's food poisoning? We haven't had any complaints today"" No lady cause he has to work the next day. (Today) And I hope you don't have any more complaints because that's awful. It was the last thing he ate. All they could say was they would try give me a phone call to check up on him. We'll be avoiding this chain place for a while that's for sure."
Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,5/14/2011,"It's the Friday before my daughters' cheerleading national competition that weekend. Many of her team mates and their families chose use this day to wind down after spending the previous days at Disneyland, or they were just arriving from the Bay Area.  Usually, the coaches call a practice in the late afternoon, and would run for a few hours. Knowing this, we planned on having a late lunch to carry everyone over through dinner. The girls wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory, and we originally planned on 10 of us.  Later that morning, many of their team mates just arrived into the area, and we invited them and their families to join us. Soon that number increased to 25.  Cheesecake Factory was still on the top of the girls' list, so I called up this location to see if they can accommodate us at 2PM, knowing that they usually don't take any reservations. The manager said that she couldn't guarantee anything, but will do their best to set aside a group of tables for us.  We arrived 1:40PM to let the hostess know that our party was here. They did block out an area for us, and there was just one party that was just finishing. Right at 2PM, the tables were cleared, the settings were placed, and we were seated (girls on section, parents on the other)!  Even with so many us, the server was able to make separate checks for the different families, and able to keep the orders correct. Didn't have to wait too long for everyone's orders to come out as well.  Overall, I really appreciated how they were able to accommodate our large party, and the efficiency of the servers. This made it very nice for the girls to just hang out, laugh, and some bonding, and for the parents to relax and visit with each other.  One of the better CF locations. They do know how the handle large groups on short notice. Will be back again."
Ashley C.,"Long Beach, CA",30,5,,5.0,8/10/2015,"5 STARS!! Great service, food was aite, but VERY attractive workers! Definitely recommend!!!"
Adrienne R.,"Fullerton, CA",212,69,426,3.0,3/29/2014,"I came her for my birthday and enjoyed it. The service was great, but the food was okay. I was expecting my pasta to be tasty, but it was average. The buffalo wings were good, but not as great as bww. Although the food wasn't great, the interiors part of the restaurant was really nice and they presented it really well. The cheesecake was probably my favorite part of the experience."
D H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",31,27,18,4.0,4/18/2014,"Always lots to choose from their menu. Service is nice and friendly. Had a great time with my friends. Food is good. The only thing is our server kept forgetting to put our order in. He was nice but I thought he might've been stoned cause he was so forgetful. 2 of our items never came out because he ""completely blew it and forgot to put it in"". Not a big deal because the entree portions are huge anyways. It's just that we wanted the food and by the time we ate our entree we don't want to wait for our shakes and appetizers. Would go again. I like the area.  Parking: free for the 1st hour. $3 for 2 hours. $6 for over 2 hours....I think it's $12 all day"
Chris T.,"Anaheim, CA",1,7,1,1.0,6/9/2015,"Hair in our food. Manager tried to disregard the notice, said that it wasn't hair because they fry many other things in their fryers. Never coming again. Horrible service. Don't come here. They don't care about the quality of their food or the presentation. No apologies. They gave us a new fry and that was it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Oh and did I mention we came at lunch It took 45 minutes to get out food. Not a place to come if you're in a hurry. The GM was the one who handled the complaint and he didn't do a good job at all. Steer clear of this restaurant"
Tristan E.,"San Diego, CA",52,16,5,5.0,5/11/2014,"Quite surprised how fast the wait time granted it's Mother's Day. Huge waiting queue of guests were cleared within 30min... Slow Clap  the service was very quick ... I'm also satisfied with the crew, we had different servers making sure we are well taken care off :)   hats off! And the natural sunlight is a plus"
Greg F.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/6/2015,Anaheim service was a joke. Several tables open but have to wait for them to clean three others and 20 minutes later to be sat in bar area. Wasting time I could have been spending money on drinks. Hostess were clueless and cared more about talking to each other.
Shane H.,"Oceanside, CA",71,115,112,4.0,1/14/2014,"Really enjoyed my last visit here which was also my first. I had just spent the day at Disneyland and food there obviously isn't worth the money. I ordered the BBQ burger. It was cooked and topped perfectly. The fries were hot and fresh. Everything you want with a meal like this. My friends all ordered different things and were super pleased with their dishes as well.  I have to give it to our waitress though. I am bummed I don't recall her name but she accommodated every single small need. That's how waitresses should be. I was very glad to have her wait on us. She received a fat tip that night! Overall super clean, warm, welcoming place for an amazing bite to eat. Open late. Wonderful wait staff. What else would you want?"
