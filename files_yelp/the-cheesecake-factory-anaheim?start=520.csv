Manny M.,"Bell, CA",28,34,4,5.0,11/20/2014,"Came here to have dinner after a long day at Disneyland. The wait was very minimal so we were happy to be seated quickly. We were very fortunate to be served by Ariell. I work in the service industry so I feel the need to commend amazing service whenever it is received. Ariell was just fantastic, she was so warm and friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu. She helped us with our order giving great recommendations, that were superb. Overall just a wonderful experience at The Cheesecake Factory. I feel a tad bit saddened that after Ariell,  every dining experience just wont be the same. Thank you Ariell. =)"
Brenda P.,"Anaheim, CA",8,11,2,3.0,9/23/2014,"As a first-timer, I was excited to come here. I came on Sunday with a large group. We sat outside, which was nice. I ordered the buffalo burger and a salad. My buffalo burger was greasy, and the onion rings on it were soggy, like they had been sitting there for a while. I'm a fan of burgers, so I was a little disappointed. My boyfriend got a pepperoni pizza with a Cesar salad. The pizza tasted frozen. We ended up eating just our salads. For the price we paid, I wish it was a better experience. The only reason I'm giving three stars is because the service was awesome. She was quick to fix mistakes and was very attentive. Hopefully, the next time is better."
Tina C.,"Anaheim, CA",72,148,18,4.0,12/1/2014,"I know there can be some mixed feelings for restaurants that is near an attraction, but it wasn't that bad. All the times I've been there the service was good and the food was great."
Thomas B.,"Fullerton, CA",0,19,8,3.0,3/6/2016,We usually have good time here but today we were not happy.  The both service and food were not acceptable.  The waitress was not courteous nor she had good manners.  The food was over cooked.
Khrystya M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,18,,5.0,7/26/2015,Amazing place. The best bartenders in the world. I live in Newport and specifically drive here just for them. Food and drinks are absolutely wonderful and the service is great. Stop by and see for yourself.
Mike M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",80,185,130,3.0,1/9/2015,"had better tasting food and experinces. I guess this particular restaurant in ungornized which is somewhat understandable since it is next to disneyland but eh could still be better. They have you wait for your table like most cheesecake factories but at this place you wait twice. once you get called they put in a different line with other people who have gotten called and you have to wait again until the server gets you to your table. Is kind of a drag considering you just waited about an hour for a table only to be put in another line. I mean I guess I understand, just think it can be done better."
G P.,"Downtown, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/22/2015,"Don't bother coming in at 'happy hour' I came in five minutes prior so they charged me $8 for one beer and $4 for the other, I did order another one but they brought it after I paid the check and never refilled my wife's soda once,  my wife got a French Dip that tasted like someone soaked beef in salt, manager refunded sandwich but if I had to do it over again I would go with Bubba Gumps or CCF in HB."

M T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",23,36,,5.0,12/2/2014,"Fantastic service. I wish I could have remembered the waitresses name, she was such a sweetheart and really worked hard to serve our very demanding party of 10. It was my mothers 60th birthday and the staff was so professional and attentive it was refreshing."
Michael F.,"Prescott, AZ",67,156,48,4.0,5/18/2015,"I was very surprised when my family walked in the door. I have never been to this restaurant before and my only knowledge of this chain is from the Big Bang Theory. I'll have to say.. It is nothing like the set on the show. The atmosphere is very elegant and the menu is huge. We ordered the calamari which was super tender and fresh with outstanding dipping sauce. I ordered the gumbo which was excellent... Big portions. My Wife ordered a peppered shrimp dish that was also excellent. We had to order cheesecake of course, and it was awesome. The service was top notch. I will definitely go back."
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,3.0,5/9/2011,"A friend and I went looking for a place to eat after seeing the Newboys and Kutless in concert and ended up at the Cheesecake Factory of all places.  90 minutes before closing and the place is still pretty busy - not so much so that there's a wait but enough that there weren't too many empty tables or booths. Anyway - our server (Wendy) did a remarkable job considering she seemed to be serving customers in three different sections. Even as busy as she was, she made it a point to walk by and check up on us which was greatly appreciated.  My friend and I split a Kobe Burger and Stuffed Mushrooms (Appetizer). On the Mushroom order - there's lots of cheese. Being from Hawaii, I love things salty but there seemed to be so much cheese that it was like stuffed with nothing but salt. My friend liked it though so I let her have it and I continued munching on the bread. The Kobe Burger was good, not great. Juicy, not dry and the flavors of the meat combined with the mushrooms and I think onions made for a tasty late night snack.  We must have shared at least half a dozen or so Green Tropical Iced Tea Sweetened. We didn't even have to ask - Every pass Wendy made at our table, she'd bring us another.  Anyway - OK food, Great service. I could see us coming back here for late night snacks as an alternative to Denny's or Norms."
Dawna F.,"Arlington Heights, IL",122,56,21,4.0,11/25/2014,"Wait time isn't bad at all.  Overall the dining experience is four stars. Food: typical for Cheesecake Factory - it is good but not great, cheesecake however is great and I highly recommend you try several.  For recommendations on food I'd steer clear of the salads and soups. Max and cheese appetizer was good and well worth it.  Nachos are also well worth the $. Servers:  the staff at this location are low energy and need a huge overall.  The staff set the mood - with all the competition for jobs there are better out there with more uplifting personalities.  We came twice and the same eeyore personalities were present.  Pleasant but blah."
Chriss L.,"Fullerton, CA",41,507,269,5.0,7/8/2011,"This place had exceptional service. I really enjoyed my steak with a ton of fresh broccoli and rice as sides. The two onion rings as toppers were yummy! They even had horseradish. Hubby liked his pecan crusted catfish except it was oily. Same with mamma, she had some grilled chicken pasta but it was too oily for her.  Our server was great. friendly prompt & helpful. This place was packed for dinner, but totally worth it."
Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,910,2114,4.0,1/16/2012,"I eat at A LOT of Cheesecake Factory restaurants and since this one  is in my own backyard I have high expectations for them because they're across the street from the world landmark, happiest place on earth, eyesore for some and eyegasm for most...Disneyland! That being said, I can tell you if you're from out of town and you want to eat somewhere that gives generous portions, fancy ambiance, and at moderate prices then you definitely need to eat here because you'll get your moneys worth.        PROS: Food's pretty much on point every time and they have a VARIETY of items to choose from and have a page or more on just chicken, pasta, meat, and fish dishes as well as an array of appetizers. There's a happy hour Mon - Fri from 5 - 7(?), dessert options are all good, wheat and sour dough bread to start are always filling and refillable. They also offer a skinnylicious menu that's under 570 calories (plus or minus) and I had two chicken items and a hamburger off of it and I can say it's deliciously filling for being part of a healthy choice menu.    CONS: Service is never consistent and I'll give this location in particular a 77% average of everything going well without some sort of waiter error or kitchen mishap, but this is sub par for Cheesecake Factory.  KEEP IN MIND: WAIT TIME CAN BE AS LONG AS SPACE MOUNTAIN: If it's a holiday or a weekend and it's dinner time, expect a 30 - 40 minute wait time, but majority of the time that's not really the case it's usually about five to ten minutes less.        *On a busy day I suggest finding a spot at the bar section if you can. The bartenders are pretty nice and I've received the best service from the guys at the bar AND you're in front of the T.V's so if you're into sports that's a plus.  APPROXIMATE COST: To give you an idea money wise for two people, an appetizer, two entree's at about $15 each, two cheesecakes, and one strawberry lemonade and one water came out to $62 total. Average meal runs you approximately $10 - $13 for burger dishes, $15 - $19 dollars per person for pasta or chicken dishes with steak, shrimp, or fish entrees at about $18 - $25. I guarantee you a party of four can walk out with a bill of at least $120. I know for a fact you could spend the same amount of money at any one of the restaurants at Downtown Disney or inside Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure park and you'll get maybe a soda, chips, and a corn dog.      Definitely eat here versus anywhere in Downtown Disney or the parks if you want more for your money. Again, three stars is my personal standard for the restaurant itself, but for the location it's the best place to eat on the block."
Danny B.,"Orange, CA",1,32,1,4.0,4/13/2015,"We've been to this one many times, figured I'd post a review.  The food here is fantastic.  The spinach dip appetizer is marginal, but I highly Recommend the chicken piccata and for dessert, lemon meringue cheesecake!!  This place is alway crowded, being so close to Disneyland.  Be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes."
Brenda S.,"Corona, CA",1,6,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory Wake Up!  The Manager of this location at 4:00 p.m., on 4/11/16 should be fired!  What place does not take reservations anymore.  Wanted to make a reservation for my daughter for dinner prior to her prom, so they can make it on time and not stand around for 2 hours in formal attire and there is no accommodation.  I understand if you did not have plans to eat there and wanted to walk up, you wait that's is what you knew was going to happen.  If you know you want to eat there make a reservation for your convenience.  Not here, they could care less about customer service."
Jared B.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",157,4,,5.0,5/9/2015,"I ordered  the chicken Madera it was great. We also  had the chicken Costalotta which was good. And of course the miso Salmon which was the bomb. Also, I have to give kudos for the short wait even though there were so many people inside and outside of the restaurant. I was really impressed with how quickly and swiftly the people working there moved. For desert we  ordered the cheesecake which is definitely overpriced but when you're in the mood for dessert you have to order it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and it's better than all the other ones around it. Skip bubba gump shrimp and come here"
Debra D.,"Long Beach, CA",1,53,6,2.0,11/28/2015,"OMG!!! What a problem we had, we were seated at an appropriate time, then when it came to order.. My step daughter is a vegan and the only dish our server could suggest is the vegan salad, out of this whole menu, crazy.. We did check the vegan site and they gave other suggestions, but the server told us they were wrong. Then had the manager come over and he had no suggestions, like this is a small mom and pop place. Hope soon this restaurant becomes more friendly with people that have food concerns):"
Amanda T.,"Irvine, CA",2,9,5,4.0,4/7/2016,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory today and our waitress was Stephanie G, well that's what it said on the receipt, she we so extremely rude! She was very snippy and would rush through everything she did with us! We had to ask 2 other waitresses around us to help us and they were very nice! We kept trying to get her attention and she would just stare and ignore us! The food was delicious but she was just horrible! Wish we had the waitress who was actually helping us!! 4 starts because the food was amazing just bad service :("
Katherine And Cris F.,"Buena Park, CA",11,42,278,4.0,2/9/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a good spot for good food.  Recently we went there after a day at Disneyland.  As alway the place is packed for lunch, so remember to come in between hours to avoid the wait.  We started with their fried combo appetizer made with fried zucchini, portobello mushroom, and avocado.  It was delicious and a definite must to try.  It was not oily as one would think. My wife and I ordered the gumbo and chicken carbonara.  Our son had the kids grilled cheese sandwich.  The gumbo was creamy and delicious with a little kick of spice to enhance the flavor.  The carbonara was great with the addition of the chicken.  So ask to add it.  The kids grilled cheese was too much for our son, he liked it, but had to take home the rest of it home cause their was two sandwiches cut into sticks.  Obviously if you're here save room for the BOMB CHEESECAKES.  Overall the location at the Gardenwalk is great with their service and food choices.  We were not disappointed."
