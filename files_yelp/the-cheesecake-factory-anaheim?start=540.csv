Anita L.,"Irvine, CA",1332,4054,3671,3.0,4/12/2009,"Disneyland is such a popular place with friends during the holidays. I've had several friends come through over spring break to take their kids to the park.  We met some of them at Cheesecake Factory for a meal. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory forever --- probably 4 years -- and I wasn't overly excited about going, but it was convenient.  Although it was filled with tourists, the wait wasn't too long at the time we went -- early evening -- and it is always pleasant to get a good server. I was surprised to find a kids' menu here because I've been to Cheesecake Factory many many times before and they've never had a kids' menu before. I'm guessing that they have so many kids go through this location that required them to offer a kids' menu. I ordered my usual dinner sized Cobb salad. My friend got the seared ahi tuna salad while the kids got the pizza and grilled chicken with mashed potatoes with carrots. The food as usual comes in huge portions. It tasted okay. I mean, it's a chain restaurant, what do you expect, but if you were going to eat at a chain restaurant, it might as well be at the Cheesecake Factory."
Steve R.,"Riverside, CA",45,55,1,3.0,4/2/2015,The shepards pie was great. The IPA was great. Service not so good.It is what it is but prefer  the Cheesecake  Factory in Riverside  over this location due to service.
Jonny B.,"Long Beach, CA",7,25,2,4.0,9/9/2013,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I visited this locaition for the first time on 9/6/13. The atmosphere is a little dark but very comfortable and beautiful. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. Nothing spectacular but always consistenly good. My friends and I had the fried mac n' cheese balls (drool), mini corn dogs, chicken fettucine alfredo w/ sun dried tomatoes, & the Everything pizza. All of the dishes were delicious and our server was very kind. We sat and talked for almost 3 hours!! It was a wonderful experience!!  On a side note: If you stay for 3 hours, be sure to overtip your server. It's the right thing to do!"
Andy C.,"Chino, CA",4,85,31,3.0,4/10/2013,"The service here is really bad, however we did get seated quickly and are order was taken but once the food came the server never checked up on us. Are drinks were not re-filled and we had to wave down a bus boy to get refills. The only time are waitress came back was to drop off the check. The food was okay no complaints and the decor is really nice with high ceilings. Will not be returning."

Caroline K.,"La Palma, CA",451,1315,4681,2.0,5/2/2011,"I used to love The Cheesecake Factory back in my college days.  It's been years since I've ventured back, but since relatives were in town, we decided on this spot due to the variety.  They still have a LOT of dishes to choose from, which is a plus.  We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table of 6 on a Saturday evening - the whole area was packed!   After being seated, it took a while for the waitress to take our order.  The table only had plate settings for five, so we asked for another.  It took forever for the waitress to get it to us.  We also asked for more bread and never got it, even after asking three times, until 30 minutes later.  Service was seriously BAD - or maybe it was just our waitress.  We got better service from the bus boy!   Now,  the food.  Prices seemed to be the same (over $15 a dish) but the portions definitely got smaller.  Even my aunt, who remembers going to Cheesecake Factory a few years ago, said her steak was tiny compared to the giant steak she got years ago.  That's inflation for you!  The Chinese Chicken Salad was drenched in dressing - get it on the side next time.  The pizza we got had four different sections of different toppings - it was pretty bland.  The best part of the evening was the dessert, which was a Mango Key Lime cheesecake slice - delicious combo.  The slice was enough for everyone to get a few bites of, but not the ginormous entity I recalled.  I'm fine with smaller potions but if I'm gonna get smaller portions, then I should be charged accordingly.   I'll leave this place to the tourists."
Jen G.,"Kelowna, Canada",0,22,21,5.0,5/22/2014,"We travel to Disneyland 3-4 times a year - and we always start off at this restaurant. Best Cheesecake Factory around. The staff are always amazing, and we always get a kick out of it when the same server looks after us, as we tend to go for days in a row and end up teaching the californian's a little bit about Canada :) Best meatloaf (next to mom's of course) Luau Salad is Amazing Love the bread basket  Highly recommend the 30th anniversary cheesecake - omg - to die for. We love it here.  and even when you can't eat the cake at your table, they know we are going back to a hotel and always put in extra forks.  Love the extra customer service this location provides. Miss it already!"
Minh N.,"Westminster, CA",12,47,98,5.0,1/20/2015,Got in here late by 10:15pm and they close by 11pm. Didn't feel rushed at all and they took our order and was patient about it too. Asparagus salad was outstanding since it had a fried egg on top lol... Overall experience top notch but the walk sucked
Nakita D.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,264,96,4.0,2/11/2013,"My boss took our team out to eat here for lunch.  I've been to several Cheesecakes so totally knew what to expect.  But then...add a twist called ""tourist trap"".  LOL!  It was almost 'Too"" perfect of an experience.  They were so eager to make us laugh - I felt like maybe they had been through the Disney training?  Or were trying to get IN at Disney?   The waiter pulled the same silly joke twice, but we still laughed.  Makes us humbled by the fact that people who have to serve tourists versus locals HAVE to be a different breed.  This staff passes 100%.  Good job boys. Food?  Well you all know their user manual of a menu.  It's usually good, and very big on portions. Oh and they validated our parking :-)"
Kendahl B.,"Maricopa, AZ",49,8,9,1.0,11/6/2015,I really hate to write this review but I'm hoping in doing that it'll help the restaurant. tonight my husband surprised me by taking me to dinner here because he knows it's my favorite place. our waitress asked what we wanted to drink & we both got waters to start & then I got a margarita & he got a mojito. it took about 15-20 mins just to get our drinks. my husbands drink had WAY too much mint in it & had to send it back & that took about 10 mins. we sat down around 9:15 & immediately ordered our food. we didn't get our food until around 10:15. I got the avocado egg rolls & he got the Americana burger. he said his dinner was great. it was super warm & juicy. mine on the other hand was cold. I ate it anyways because I was so hungry. after I ate I went to the front & asked to speak to the manager. the manager came over & I told her everything & she just said I'm sorry that happened I'll talk to your waitress. I said okay thank you & walked away. I've worked in restaurants for my whole career & I know how you're suppose to speak to a customer with a complaint & usually what the manager will do is take off the food or give you something on the house. I didn't go to complain just to get something out of it but it would've been nice to have that offer. while the manager was nice I just didn't feel as if she was too concerned about my business.
Brian K.,"Anaheim, CA",103,246,404,4.0,9/28/2011,"This place has so many amazing plates!!! I ordered the Wasabi Crusted Tuna, it was simply delicious. If you like tuna you will love this! It was served on top of rice with some veggies on the side. Red velvet cheesecake for dessert is as heavenly as it gets!  This was really rich, but the taste was very good! It us a must try if you like cheesecake or red velvet cake."
Catherine P.,"Orange, CA",63,23,5,1.0,2/15/2015,"Wow, the cheesecakes are amazing but when we ordered them, the girl was really not nice. Really? Is it that hard to smile and have good customer service? It's not like we were mean or asked for anything ridiculous. Honestly, I expected better since I've had plenty of good experiences here before. Maybe I'll just make my own cheesecake next time if they are this unhappy with our purchase."
Mike S.,"San Jose, CA",2,84,2,5.0,1/21/2015,"I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, but this outfit gets it right.  This location had great staff and good food as always.  Highlights for me are the ahi tartare app and sharing a strawberry shortcake desert with my wife and our two crazy toddlers."
Q N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",69,19,,5.0,7/20/2013,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous times have and never been disappointed.  I really enjoyed the Cajun Pasta Jambalaya, it came in a huge portion that made me wish I have a bigger appetite.  Some other must try are their Chicken Madeira, Steak Diane, Salmon, and Shepherd pie.  Did I mention their Cheesecake??? This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. Whenever I have a hard time deciding where to go, this place is always a safe choice.  Keep in mind that they do not take reservation and weeknights have always been busy every time I visit."
Elaine V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,11,,5.0,10/18/2014,Excellent service from Ivan! He was very attentive and had a great sense of humor. We love Cheesecake Factory! We are gonna request Ivan every time we go! Thank you so much for making our experience an enjoyable one!
Missy A.,"Orange County, CA",18,48,14,5.0,7/6/2013,"Five stars for their happy hour! I came here with a friend after work and we were both super impressed with the selection of appetizers and cocktails for only $5 each!  What we had: Avocado Eggrolls - the eggrolls were super creamy and perfectly crispy! I don't care much for the sauce they come with since it is sweet. The avocados are flavorful enough that you don't even need sauce anyway. Fried Macaroni and Cheese - Delicious...simply tasty little er.. BIG fried balls of oogey gooey cheesy goodness. I like the marinara sauce they garnish the plate with too. Adds a little more flavor without being overpowering. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - Your usual artichoke and spinach dip. Couldn't taste any cheese really, not very creamy. The chips weren't the greatest, but I may be too critical because I'm used to the real deal tortilla chips. Roadside Sliders - The meat was cooked just right and the buns were soft. Normally I need cheese on a a burger, but improvised with putting a little of the spinach dip on it. Tasted delicious, especially dunked in ranch! J.W.'s Pink Lemonade - YUMMY! You have the option to get their cocktails ""skinny"" which is 150 calories or less. I tried it and was very pleased with the flavor. Couldn't really taste the alcohol, but don't let that fool you, the drinks aren't weak. Cosmopolitan - I think I've only had one other Cosmo in my life which was a while ago since I can't remember. I decided to refresh my memory and try theirs. STRONG. Not a bad thing, but I remember why I prefer other cocktails. All in all, the food and drinks were good and cheap! And the service was great, our waiter was helpful and attentive."
Paul F.,"Buffalo, NY",198,116,1767,2.0,3/7/2013,"The tough part about being carless and in an area like Disney / The Conference Center in Anaheim is, the most accessible places are all chain restaurants.  Making matters worse, schedules and the preferences of the people that you're with limit options. I ended up going to this particular Cheesecake Factory twice. Once it was late night.  This is the positive side of this review; they were open later than most of the other restaurants in the area.  The food was ok, the service on this particular night was good. Here is the down side; went there for lunch today and had the exact opposite experience.  Service was less than good, an appetizer ordered was delivered to the wrong table and not corrected until our entire meal was almost over (yes, they comped it off the bill).  I ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich, and there was practically nothing right about it.  The chicken was over cooked and dry, there was virtually no sauce on it, the cheese wasn't melted and the sandwich was served luke-warm. Other members of my party ordered salads, which were huge.  Literally, huge.   But to me, this is not doing lunch right.  A business lunch should take an hour and 45 minutes to get through.  You shouldn't get a salad the size of a spare tire from a Toyota, and it shouldn't cost nearly $15.  Right sized portions, right priced portions - I really don't care if their menu is 26 pages, if they can't get lunch salads right, why bother? Disappointing, but this is why I avoid chain restaurants to begin with... A two is generous, and it would have been a one if not for the good service received on the first visit.  I believe the server's name was Ahmed.  He did a great job."
Jodi L.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/17/2016,"Giving it two stars because I told the waitress that my daughter is allergic to many things and all we want for her was plain strawberries and it cannot touch anything else.  She said ok. So we ordered it.  She brings it out and my daughter eats them. She threw them up after eating them.  Everyone else's food was fine, but the allergic reaction my daughter had caused me to give this 2 stars.  Just a warning to people with food allergies. Be careful.  Will not be ordering food for my daughter here again."
Art E.,"Downey, CA",63,11,,3.0,11/16/2014,"A ok.  The fish n chips are oily, no flavor and cause upset stomach"
Vivian N.,"Cerritos, CA",723,23,94,4.0,1/6/2012,"If you're planning on coming to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner...don't be so surprised when you're asked to wait about an hour.  Whenever my boyfriend and I aren't sure of where to eat, we ALWAYS end up here. The portion is perfect, the ambiance and service is on point, and the food is without a doubt, always satisfying.  Most people don't realize this because it seems more like a dinner kinda restaurant...but breakfast here is BOMB. If you're looking for a fancier, up-scale restaurant similar to The Cheesecake Factory, try their other chain restaurant: The Grand Lux located in LA."
