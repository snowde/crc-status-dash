Ludre L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,14,8,1.0,3/21/2015,Walked in for a slice of cheesecake. It took 3 people and over 10 minutes to accomplish this small task... Servers/cashiers are standing around talking to one another. There was no line when we ordered the cheesecake slice but the one person who appeared to be the only one responsible for pick-up orders was super slow!! I'm still baffled what the three other people who were behind the counter are good for?
Debra B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,52,16,4.0,1/30/2016,Went to this restaurant while visiting Disneyland. We got there very late and decided to go to the bar while waiting for our to go order. I ordered a lemon drop martini which is my go to drink. I must say it was the best lemon drop I've ever had. I only wish it wasn't $12.50. I would have loved to have enjoyed a second glass but refused to pay that much for a smaller than normal glass. The food we ordered was very good and the service was great. I will go back when in the area.
Alli Y.,"Irvine, CA",307,555,1231,4.0,9/15/2009,I usually try to stay away from chain restaurants but I have to say Cheesecake Factory is one of my favs.  Sometimes a bit on the expensive side but the portions & quality are excellent!!!  I went for lunch and we were one the first ones in the restaurant.  There was a bird there that day what couldn't get out.  They sat us by the window where the bird was and that was a bit unnerving.   I ordered my favorite jambalya!!  It's been a long time since I've ordered it and it was excellent as always!!!  It was made very well this time around and it tasted wonderful!  The service was good and I would definitely come back again.   Parking is free in the garage with validation and it's close to Disneyland.
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,4.0,9/15/2011,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake factory. The selection is huge and especially since now that the location is so close to Disneyland, I come here more often. It's just another Cheesecake Factory! They need to bring a Grand Lux to the OC!!!"
Rose N.,"Garden Grove, CA",72,59,37,3.0,12/11/2014,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory wnd the service was great! Staff was vey friendly and had small talk with my boyfriend and I. So first, we ordered the apple cider. Wasn't fizzy, so it was basically $3.50 for apple juice. Then my boyfriend ordered the americana burger which he said was good. I ordered the fettucine alfredo and I was disappointed. The meal was hot, it looked delicious. But when I ate it, the sauce was really SALTY. As couples we like sharing little kisses here and there, so when he kissed me, the first thing he said was ""Ew, why are your lips all salty."" I was trying to finish the plate, even though I was full, but I honestly could not take another bite due to how salty it was. I'm sure it was just a bad day or something, but I don't think I'm ordering any more pastas from here... I'll stick to Olive Garden for that."
Chin C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,26,1,1.0,2/12/2014,"Eaten here couple times. Last time I was here I found some plastic material in my meal, so I asked for a different dish. The server never apologized; on top of that, the manager came to ""apologize"" but it felt more like an interrogation, like I put it there on purpose.  He didn't offer me any comps for waiting on another dish. I gave them couple chances to make up for the horrible way they handled it, to no avail. This happened to me at BJs once and they comped all our food. (had to pay for the alcohol but I have no problem with that) probably never eating here again due to the crappy way they handled this situation."
P C.,"La Habra, CA",3,55,1,4.0,5/25/2013,"It was my first time at this particular location, celebrating a birthday with a large group of friends.  The service was only slow at one point but it was fast and consistent throughout the rest of our time there.  We came on a busy Friday evening and they were very accommodating, given this is a busy location close to disneyland and the rest of my party arrived late. The food was wonderful!  Everyone loved what they had and I particularly enjoyed my Chicken Madeira.  I even asked that they sing to our birthday girl and mention ""happy 30th!"" to her but they came up with something even better, they said ""happy 21st!"" Boy was she pleasantly surprised!   All-in-all, it was a good birthday for her, thanks cheesecake factory!"
Lincoln G.,"Burnaby, Canada",4,13,2,5.0,5/9/2014,"First off, let's start off with the fact that this was my first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. I went there not expecting much.  I tend to do so whenever I eat at chain restaurants. Now that we've gotten that out here's what I think of the place.   IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!! I got the Shepard's Pie, which I think may have given me an orgasm with the first bite.  My party ended up munching on each other's entrées.  Normally, I inhale things like Shepard's pie, but u couldn't eat the whole thing.  I knew I wanted dessert so I had them bag what was left.  I ended up taking the dessert  home too.  I dreamt of the food that night and ended up eating both the Shepard's pie AND the smore thingy dessert FOR BREAKFAST! The customer service was great, we never had to look for the waiter, he was always there when we needed a refill or anything.  Aesthetically the places was pretty nice.  Very clean and comfortable.   If you get the chance, give it a try."
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,4.0,11/19/2010,"I've been here twice and both times I've had pretty good experiences.   This Cheesecake Factory is located right down the street from Disneyland and in the Garden Walk Plaza.  Location is clean and nicely lit.  You will get a diverse group of people around here since you are right next to Disneyland. Service both times were consistently good.  Waiters were attentive and came by just enough times to check on us. You won't really wait too long here if you don't have a big party, but this place seems consistently busy. If you are tired of Disneyland food and looking to cater to the different food cravings of your group, Cheesecake Factory would probably be your best bet."
Jessica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,21,1,2.0,2/4/2015,"Let me start by saying that we love your restaurant and have never had a bad experience up until last night. We were greeted by our server who from the start did not have a very friendly approach. You could sense her coldness and she never smiled once during our entire visit.  We started by ordering our drinks. A couple beers, an Odouls and a kids chocolate milk half full (we have a toddler so he tips it and spills it if its too full) and easy on the chocolate. She came back with a chocolate milk that was extremely chocolatety and had to be returned and a Becks instead of Odouls which she advised you did not carry. My girlfriend does not like Beck and she returned it. Not sure why the waitress decided to take it upon herself to bring something else. Next we ordered our meal. I ordered my sons kids pizza and asked if he could get sausage. She went back to the kitchen to ask and confirmed I could. Never did she say that there was a $5 charge for sausage on a kids pizza. Really? Almost the cost of the pizza itself?! Completely appalled by this! Next my pregnant girlfriend orders a Filet mignon medium in doneness. The Steak came out completely rare and had to be sent back. Later we ordered another round of drinks , specifically another Stella Beer. When she brings the beer to the table we immediately notice the color of the beer was that of a Blue Moon or Shock Top. She insists that it is the beer we ordered and after tasting it confirm it was in fact a Blue Moon or Shock Top. Returned the beer and just told her to take it off the bill. I had to ask her several times for straws she never brought to the table since my son had dropped his on the floor. I also asked for a refill of my sons chocolate milk to which she proceeded to tell me there was no refills. I told her, that when we sat down I told her to only fill halfway so he wouldn't spill and I would take the other half later. Once I reminded her of that she brought the chocolate milk. But she again just had a really bad attitude about this! Upon our getting ready to leave I stopped a manager, didn't get his name but he appeared to be latin or middle eastern with a close trimmed beard. I told him this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had and that our waitress had a really bad attitude and was not friendly at all. His response, let us know when you are back. I told him I wasn't from the area and I would probably never be back. He basically just briefly apologized as he was walking away from me and told me next time to address it at the time of dining and walked away from me. To spend almost $150 to have a nice meal and have this kind of service is completely unacceptable! Like I said before, we dine your restaurant often, at other locations and have never had this kind of experience. I hope as a company you will address this will all parties involved to provide a better experience for future patrons."
Mel B.,"San Diego, CA",547,568,235,4.0,10/11/2010,"You know the food, and if you don't, well, there's just way too many items to review.  You have to go there and give it a try yourself. Located in the Gardenwalk mall within walking distance from Disneyland, this particular location is competing with other big name chains like PF Changs, CPK, and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.  I was outnumbered by the kiddos, and they chose Cheesecake Factory. The service here is always stellar.  Our server was training another server, and they were both excellent.  Not a single complaint. The hostesses were friendly, but when I asked about the shuttle bus, they had no answers for me.  Well, at least they did their job well.   Unlike other Cheesecake Factories, I've never had to wait for a table at this one.  Ever.  That's reason enough to go back."
Tin M.,"Fountain Valley, CA",39,79,35,5.0,12/24/2013,"I've been to this location many times before and thought of it as a FOUR STAR joint. But, my last visit was great. Our server, JULIA gave us great customer service and was very well mannered. I was impressed with her feedback on dishes and her recommendations. She was very cheery and out-going. Julia was very helpful with my weird order. LOL. But she did it and I greatly appreciated it. My BF and I both tried something new on the menu and didn't go with our usual love dish. He got the ""Crusted Chicken Romano"" (Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce) and I got the ""Chicken Di Pana"" (Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli) with guacamole added on the side. (That was the weird request from me to Julia. LOL! I LOVE QUACAMOLE!!!!)  Anyways, the food was delicious. My bf and I both were very happy with our food. It was awesome. Large portions, worth the money and wait.  Julia constantly checked in with us and made sure everything was to our liking. Every time she stopped by, we had our mouths full but we smiled and nodded. She laughed and said she will be back to check on us later. LOL. Everything was great.  The only complaint I have is Cheesecake's dim light setting. I get it, I understand it. It's just hard to see the menu sometimes."
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,4.0,4/6/2013,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. I was very excited to find that there was a location near the Honda Center where myself, hubby and seven other friends were going to go for an event. Although we all lamented before we were seated about the automatic gratuity that is added on to larger parties as we have never had a server at Cheesecake factory who didn't take advantage of the fact that they did not have to work for their tip.  Yep we usually get lackadaisical service with those automatic gratuities. Well were we PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! We had a fabulous and attentive server!!! I had a couple of friends who had never been to Cheesecake Factory and were overwhelmed by the menu. She cheerfully answered their questions about various dishes. The food was scrumptious. We were all content when we left. One of the best Cheesecake Factory locations I have been to!"
Kameron M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",171,4,,5.0,2/15/2016,"From the moment we arrived, we found a line out the door. Due to our party only being two, we were immediately seated in 'Nathan's' section. Given the current business levels, I was very impressed to find Nathan attentive with a smile on his face. Although we had a very slight delay in the beginning, he resolved it with his outstanding service & empathetic apologies towards our initial delay. Hats off to Nathan for his outstanding service given a very busy night."
Vanessa G.,"Long Beach, CA",16,5,6,4.0,2/18/2015,I went on Valentine's day (night really) so it was SUPER packed. Even though it was packed and super busy everyone has a big smile and was very friendly.
Darcy D.,"Vancouver, Canada",13,132,2,4.0,11/19/2012,"I am looking for reasons not to like The Cheesecake Factory. Chain restaurants have a boring menu but, theirs is very up to date with many modern techniciques and presentations.  Chain restaurants have trouble with quality control but every dish tastes the same at every location!  This chain has an absurdly huge menu so, some of it must be bad but, every dish I've ever tried has been, dare I say, memorable.  Chain restaurants look dull but, they have high ceilings and modern decor. I hate it when servers keep coming back to the table over and over to say ""is everything ok? do you need something else? you must try some dessert!""  and this is exactly how the these servers are trained to do there jobs.  Thankfully I can take a star off for over-attentive servers. Otherwise I would have to give them a 5-star, because the value is great, the portions are huge and the ingredients taste as close to homemade as I have found in a chain.  I always cringe on the outside when people say, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory but, I always agree because inside I can't wait  for the endive and walnut salade, and the pear & blue cheese flatbread, and the avocado spring rolls, and the marinara spaghetti, and the ..."
Rey R.,"Fullerton, CA",45,89,67,4.0,12/7/2013,"This was my first time coming to cheesecake factory. And I orderd the buffalo blue cheeseburger. That was good french fries are excellent. Drinks were promptly refilled an A++, to me. The cheesecake or order it was good not the best but good. Overall food was good wait time was about five minutes on a Saturday night at 7:20 PM"
Mi H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,32,,3.0,4/16/2015,"My family and I enjoy this place. The food is creative and delicious. The menu has a variety of flavors from around the world...fusion mind you. Some of the dishes are not authentic but their chefs have put a nice spin on the popular ones.  We love their pastas, chicken burgers, salads (my favorite). I do not, however, recommend their Vietnamese Spring Rolls (they really need to consult with a Vietnamese chef for this dish). Other than that, the atmosphere is unique, just a little too dark in the evening to where you can't really see what you are eating. But it's fine during the day. It's a nice place for a outing with your family."
Jennifer D.,"Seattle, WA",0,22,2,3.0,4/4/2015,The food was delicious. My youngest didn't like her order so they took it off the bill. My Margarita was tasty.  The server wasn't the best. We were there for lunch and it wasn't very busy. She was nice but we had to track her down a couple times to get us something we needed.  Dessert was good. And big!
Kika M.,"Salinas, CA",126,3,,5.0,3/1/2015,This place is great. Food was delicious I wanted to order everything. Very Great customer service. Highly recommended. Our server Vanessa M was an excellent server. Definitely coming back.
