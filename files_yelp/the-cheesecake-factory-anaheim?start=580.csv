John M.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,338,130,4.0,7/21/2014,The cheesecakes here are some of the best I've ever had. The End. Food super tasty as well. (I just can't ever remember anything but the dessert;)
Gruber T.,"San Francisco, CA",6,111,7,4.0,1/3/2016,"First time here at this Cheesecake Factory went here on New Year day for dinner. Surprise for this day we were seated quick and didn't have  to wait for a outside area . Our waiter was friendly and good customer service. Check in on us to see if everything was fine. We had a minor problem the table was not stable inform our waiter he inform another staff they stabilize it  much they can. Staff re check us to see if we were fine. Food was delicious, good size portion, drink was good and cheesecake was delicious. Price was reasonable for the good quality of food and portion.   Would recommend this place and go back to here again."
Jackie C.,"Westminster, CA",24,39,20,1.0,11/18/2014,I always go to the one in HB and it always leaves me satisfied but I came here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend when they brought my food it was so ugly! My food was all touching! My steak had way too much seasoning! I couldn't even take one more bite at all! My shrimp was thrown in the plate! Usually when I go to the one in hb the seasoning is just right! The shrimp is decorated sitting but no this one was thrown! Never again!!!!
Manny V.,"Carlsbad, CA",341,522,681,4.0,6/23/2013,Friendly service food was really good but dessert was even better had the grilled coulotte steak w/fries medium finished it off with a strawberry cheese cake which was so fresh and delicious. My steak was just actually ok I was expecting a bit more maybe because it was charbroiled had a light burned taste
Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,4.0,9/14/2012,"Flawless! Since Alexis b. got home late from one of her adventures and I needed a good last meal before my surgery the next morning , we needed something open late :) For it being a Monday evening around 10ish this place was packed! I guess tourists don't care what time it is -_- It was flawless! All the food we ordered was super fresh and hot! Our server was on point each time! We mostly ordered the small plates {corn dogs,sliders etc.} Alexis fell in love with their corn dogs! The sliders were spot on and super fresh! For it being so late , I was a happy camper! ^_^"
Angie S.,"Orange, CA",236,44,68,5.0,11/2/2013,Had a great time with the family went in after the Alzheimer's walk and they were very accommodation  to out  needs.  We will be back  Gwendy Sophie Silvia g mom and me
Mel S.,"Newport Beach, CA",357,54,66,4.0,7/19/2014,I love this place and happy hour is the best they have these awesome $5.00 appetizer specials and drinks are very good! The service is always good and i haven't had a bad experience yet!. Great atmosphere and great service team.
Em O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,82,3,5.0,11/15/2015,"Just like every Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, this one upheld the high standard. Food is always excellent. Service is top notch. The wait was not too bad for how many people they had waiting. They do extra things like pack up extra sauces when you ultimately take the leftovers to go, which for us is key when trying to get our toddler to eat broccoli."
Rebecca T.,"Claremont, CA",239,381,38,4.0,1/25/2011,"I can honestly say that Ashley is one of the best servers I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and that I will ALWAYS be asking for her when I return to this location, as I do on a fairly often basis as we have Disneyland annual passes. Ashley went above and beyond my expectations regarding service. She immediately greeted us, set us up with beverages that were never more than 1/3 empty. She anticipated any extras we might need with two kiddos. She timed our meal perfectly and offered us beverages to go when she found out I had a fairly long drive home ahead of me. She was just a great server, so sweet and attentive.  As usual the food as Cheesecake factory was yummy. My daughter and my friend's daughter split a pepperoni pizza and I had a Renee's special with a chicken salad sandwich. Dessert was a chocolate coconut cheesecake which is my ultimate favorite dessert there and which I only will consume on special occasions for the calorie content alone."
Jason V.,"CA, CA",18,178,928,5.0,6/9/2014,Had lunch here today... It was amazing service was above and beyond... Our server Carrie Ann took care of everything.. Salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious.. Great place and beautiful
Jorja P.,"Anaheim, CA",67,8,,1.0,11/15/2012,"The food was absolutely delicious and the sole reason that I didn't give our experience more stars was because the service was absolutely TERRIBLE.   We had two servers during our three hour stay at the Cheesecake Factory and neither of them was attentive (in our experience).  The three hours spent at the restaurant was not by choice, and we could have been out of the restaurant easily almost an hour earlier if we did not have to wait for our servers to show up to our table.   The first server, Jamie, was at our table four times: once to introduce herself, once to take our drink and appetizer order, once to take our food order, and the last check in was to tell us that we were getting a new server.  Which would not be bad if that did not take one hour.  When we got our food, it was very tasty, but we did not see our new server, Julia, until twenty minutes after we had stopped eating (forty-five minutes after she had been introduced).  We ordered our desserts and immediately asked for our bill when she brought the ordered items.  She did not come back for over twenty minutes, making all of us feel greatful that we carry cash so we wouldn't have to wait for our credit cards.   If we ever come to this restaurant again and end up in either servers' section, we would rather wait for another table to be reseated because it would honestly be a better way to spend time than being ignored at the table."
Patsy M.,"San Clemente, CA",19,14,1,2.0,2/16/2015,"First I will start and say that Cheese Cake one of my favorite places to go have dinner. The one in Anaheim by Disney Land was such a let down. The bread came out cold, when my food finally came out the pasta was hard very under cooked. The dish my friend had came with rice that was cold and the sauce on the enchiladas was also cold.  We then decided to order the brownie with ice cream thinking this has to be better than the meal but wrong we were because the brownie was hard as a rock we had to use a fork to break it and the menu stated covered in chocolate syrup but we had to search for the syrup finding it under the brownie and ice cream on the plate. We figured they must have decorated the plate with the chocolate and then sat the brownie in top  The service by Albert was great he was timely with the drink refills and seemed very friendly but I will never go back to this location again."
L.R. C.,"Anaheim, CA",1,20,44,5.0,2/15/2015,"I live local and have been to this location a handful of times, for various occasion.  Am set on the Chicken Costoletta...always good, everything is.  Tonight, i found the side dish of Mash Potatoes exceptionally wonderful, with plenty of flavor, moist (not dry), and just great.   Wonderful enough, that i made a comment to our waitress and she returned and advised me someone name Domingo prepared them.   Well, Domingo  ""GREAT JOB"" my friend.   It totally made my meal complete and Fantastic tonight!   Thank You."
Kim B.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,54,65,5.0,12/21/2015,Definitely coming back here because our waiter rocks! He kept on refilling our drinks and asking if we doing okay. He was on top of his games. I tipped him 30 dollars because he really deserve it.
Niveen H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,3,1.0,3/18/2015,It's the worst service ever and we had to Waite from 6:30 till 8:30 to be sited they kept on saying oh we cleaning the table and the manger was so un professional
The 1.,"Claremont, CA",78,414,268,2.0,6/3/2014,this place is good.. the one thing i didnt like was the fact that I went in an hour early to reserve a table. the manager gave me till 8:15/8:30 for 80% of my party to show. She kept bugging me and bugging me way before 8:15 and I told her people were parking and coming in. at 8:00 she said i had 5 mins or she was going to give up my table. I was so upset because my guests were in search of parking. She gave up my table and we had to wait an additional hr before we were ever seated. I prob wont ever be back to this location.
Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,4.0,11/21/2012,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but for a chain it is pretty darn good. This particular location is in the Anaheim Gardenwalk, which was right next to our hotel (technically vacation resort, the Worldmark) and we just wanted to walk to dinner.  I pretty much get one thing and one thing only at Cheesecake Factory and that is the Tuna Tataki salad. It is always very fresh with nicely seared tuna, juicy red tomatoes, lovely slices of avacado with nice mixed greens and a soy vinagrette. I can eat that and not feel too guilty about eating gobs of the delicious brown bread they bring to the table. They also bring some french bread, but I only have eyes for the brown bread. It is so yummy my three year old was calling it ""cake"". My mother had the herb crusted salmon and she was positively swooning over it. I don't really remember what my husband ate, but he seemed pretty happy too.  The kids had grilled cheese and chicken strips and they both enjoyed themselves and the portions were generous. The menu is huge and you can find just about anything you might want from American classics to Asian influenced dishes to some south of the border flavor. Oh and most people rave about the cheesecake, of course. Honestly, I don't care for cheesecake. I have had the cheesecakes here and they are better than most, but usually I will get a sundae if I have dessert at all. The hot fudge is pretty decadent and the slivered almonds add just the right touch. The kids ice cream dish was only $1, so that was quite a deal for the little ones. Most Cheesecake Factory locations can be packed and I am sure this one is no exception, however on a Tuesday night in November we had no wait at all. Service was pretty good, although they have seperate servers who deliver the food from the ones who take your order. There was some confusion about where food should go in our section which resulted in constantly being asked if a particular dish was ours. They even tried to deliver meals to us while we were clearly eating dessert.  They have a large indoor eating area along with a large outoor patio. Eating outside in good weather would make for interesting people watching as it is right on Katella at the entrance to the Gardenwalk shopping and entertainment mall."
Kim N.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,54,42,1.0,7/29/2016,"Park in the structure and remember to bring ticket to validate.  We came there at about 6:30 PM on a Sunday,  the wait was a little over 45 minutes.  We got seated and the server was nice and recommended some items.  I had the Factory burger.  It took about 25 mintues for all our food to come (5 people). It was so dark I can't see my plate nore the food so can't comment on what it looks like  :/ The burger was extremely well done to a char... Yes to a char.  Each bite was crispy and tasted so burnt.  I could only eat about 4 bites and couldn't anymore. I ended but stealing some of the Shepard pie from my mother's plate; it was okay tasted like the one they sell in the freezer from Marie's Calendar. I wanted to wave down a server if any even came to ask us about my food but it was getting late and didn't want to wait another half hour for food. The worst thing is trying to talk to the people around you but can't see their face.  This isn't a club.  We will never come back again.  If you are in the Disneyland area,  there are many other places close by without the wait and price tag and great for family."
Cali S.,"San Diego, CA",752,351,92,5.0,6/11/2013,Just went back to get a slice of strawberry cheesecake..YUM-O Will be back the next time I'm out that way The service was fast & the staff was super friendly
Norissa R.,"Hemet, CA",6,19,17,4.0,11/12/2013,"Overall, a very good experience. The place was extremely busy with a 35 minute wait. Once seated the service was somewhat slow and the servers were either short staffed or poorly trained. Although our waiter had an awesome personality, he was over worked. Based off visits to other locations, like Las Vegas flagship, they should be better prepared for the larger crowds. The food was great as always. We had the four cheese pasta with chicken, the pasta and sauce was wonderful, however, the chicken was perfectly cooked. Of course we ended the evening with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia but cheesecake, awesome ass always.  Overall, never disappointed with the food. Great place and always very friendly. Only complaint was slow service, should be better prepared for large crowds on a Saturday evening, especially with a holiday and convention in town."
