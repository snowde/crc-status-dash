Nancy N.,"Garden Grove, CA",155,76,162,3.0,3/3/2017,"My friend and I went here for her birthday. She arrived before me and was seated super fast, I think.  Later when I arrived, the server asked if we wanted bread. We were confused because they didn't ask my friend if she wanted bread when she was alone. So that's -1 star for the service.  As for the food, I ordered cajun jambalaya pasta. The pasta was bland ( it might be because I'm sick) and I had to add more salt. So that's minus another star.  It's been awhile since I've been here so I can't recommend much on the menu. I do know that I won't be coming to Cheesecake Factory for awhile."
Realize B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,25,160,2.0,5/11/2017,Service was ok. Food was ok. 2 stars to this place just because in my personal opinion you dont get your moneys worth here. Theres better places for your money out there.  And the most important reason why i gave this place 2 stars because we found a bug on our celery in our buffalo chicken strips appetizer...yuck! Check your food before you eat it. We tried to take a picture of it but we dropped the celery and lost the bug.
Jeff R.,"Garden Grove, CA",117,155,101,3.0,10/31/2017,I really do enjoy the food here. I also really enjoy going for lunch and not dinner. All the Cheesecake Factories I have been to are way to dim in the evening. I understand the concept of the low lighting but I am blind even with my glasses and I can't see the menu. Almost everywhere I looked people had to use their call phone cameras to see the menu. Please turn up the lights just a little!
Jonny L.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",27,90,114,4.0,1/15/2017,"Busy, yet appropriately staffed, the positives here are a good, consistently prepared meal.  Our favorites are the Chicken Madeira, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Chicken Stuffed Tortillas.  Make sure to bring your parking voucher and have it validated."
Tosh I.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,806,604,4.0,11/28/2016,"I've never been to this location and expected to wait considering how close we were to Disneyland.  But what a nice surprise, we were seated right away.  This has a different ambiance from the Redondo Beach location but good overall.  Was with my friend from out of town and hoped this would be a positive dining experience.  And it was! Service was pleasant and attentive.  We ordered the ole standby, Avocado egg rolls (always superdelish), Ceasar Salad (perfectly dressed and lemony) and the topper, Key Lime Cheesecake.   I also ordered a yummy Passion Fruit Mojito I nursed throughout my meal.  (Remember to get your parking validated at the front.)  Looks like we'll be back here again!"
Tiffanie E.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,121,70,4.0,7/29/2017,"The cheesecake was, of course, amazing and the chicken taquitos were a perfect mini appetizer! We sat in the bar, got a bread basket right away and waters were refilled often. Not too busy for a Friday night. Our server was ok. I am not a fan of them taking my food away to box but she took it anyway, which was weird. Good for a quick, familiar dinner, but with all the options in Anaheim, this one should be lower on the list."
Kim L.,"Murrieta, CA",30,70,19,3.0,7/27/2017,"My order was the mini meal of fried zucchini, mushrooms, and avocado. I know, I thought the same thing. Deep fried Avocado? Lol so I ordered it and the deep fried trio was  so good. I kept thinking to myself, "" why hadn't I ever made this at home?"" Lol but for real, go there and try it, it makes for a good appetizer as well. Oh and my waiter was ok, nothing special to say about her. I did tipOver 20% because it was a slow lunch period. Haha"
Marie AK C.,"Orange County, CA",1160,344,1863,4.0,11/13/2016,"It's been a tradition of mine for as long as I can remember to celebrate my birthday at Cheesecake Factory. I came to this particular location to celebrate another year of LIFE :) This one is located just across the street from Disneyland next to Roy's Hawaiian Restaurant on Katella Avenue. There is garage parking in the building next door. There is almost always a wait, so be prepared to wait. The best times to go without a wait is when the doors opens for lunch. We ordered a bunch of ""appetizers"" to share: avocado egg rolls, sweet potato fries, and the Mac n cheese balls are to DIE for!! They are amazing!!! And of course, can't leave without having a slice of cheesecake. Service is professional, prices are comparable, the portion sizes are HUGE and the food is tasty. The wait can't be exhausting..."
Richard S.,"Tustin, CA",1,112,,3.0,12/18/2017,"Stopped in because we have not been to a Cheesecake Factory almost forever. Food was good, above average. But our server must have gone off shift not long after getting our waters. Never saw her again and the other servers brought our app, food, etc. Seemed like service was spotty for us, whomever happened to see we were waiting (a long time) would come over and check. So 3 stars for OK food and slightly sub-par service."
Cesar S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,22,7,3.0,11/7/2017,"The main thing worth coming here for is the cheesecake. The food itself wasn't amazing or enough for the price you pay, but that's not surprising since it's near Disney. The waitresses here are very accommodating so the service is good at least."
Sal K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/5/2017,Not the greatest customer service or attitude in the take out place. Not even the slightest will to help me out with the order. I blame the rising gas prices I guess. Btw don't take yelp's reviews like this for their face value you might have a totally different experience.
Jessica F.,"San Leandro, CA",11,26,5,5.0,9/25/2017,Food was great and Service was excellent today. I had the chicken Cobb salad which was delicious and a huge portion. Definitely can be shared with two people. My boyfriend had the Mac and cheese burger which was amazing for max and cheese lovers. Our server Benjamin had great customer service skills. He was attentive even though he was really busy he did a great job at managing his tables. We'll for sure be returning to this cheesecake during our next Anaheim visit.
Eric F.,"Chandler, AZ",0,66,,4.0,10/19/2017,"Was really crowded, but still had great service. Quick with taking orders, getting drinks, bringing refills, and brining the food and check in timely manners.  The food was standard Cheescake factory, tasty and as expected."
Avtar S.,"Woodland, CA",28,98,112,5.0,11/1/2016,Had an amazing time for Saturday night dinner close to Disneyland. Love the ambience was really busy but still got a table in 5 minutes. Had an amazing server. Ordered the rolls sampler for appetizer and stuffed tortillas for an entry. You have to try the cucumber lemonade. Amazing drink. Wish it had vodka in it. Got the tres leche cheesecake. Yummy. Left stuffed.
Mona A.,"La Mirada, CA",112,120,392,5.0,4/10/2016,"Superb  Nathan was our waiter tonight and i must say. I have been to several locations from Brea to fashion island, even las vegas. And he has to be the best waiter i have came across since dining at cheese cake factory in 2009.  Made sure my cousin and I had everything we needed. Always checked up on us and we sat at the bar where most people think you're not waited on as you do when seating with a larger group. Not the case with Nathan here at this location, a true gem and wonderfully polite young man. He recommended me the Di Pana. I asked for cheese mashed potatoes.. omg such a wonderful Choice. Also they have a cucumber lemonade.. delicious and super refreshing, though it's very sweet for my taste. May want a glass of water next to it! I highly recommend his area to sit in. Tell him want you like and he'll recommend you a great meal+  Message to his management, I've been in customer service for 15 years. He is the best you probably have, show him some love please. What great service and food"
Kimberly G.,"Orange, CA",229,61,144,5.0,10/4/2016,"So I came here to celebrate my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend. My uncle and his fiance recommended me to come here.  As soon as you walk in the decor looks very nice! Loved it !  Had no idea you could walk in to buy cheesecake in the front entrance of the place where there is a little bakery shop sort of thing going on. When it comes to the noise level I'd say it was rather loud in there, maybe because we came on a Sunday?  Anyways we werent big fans of where we got seated because the table was very small but thats not the restaurants fault, we couldve asked to be moved but didnt. The waitress we got was beyond amazing!  She always checked up on us..almost constantly but not too extremely. And would never let my soda go more than half way down when she would come by and take it just to bring me a new full soda! She would take our trash right away and would take our leftovers to box them up and bring them back to us all ready in a bag to go, she definitely exceeded my waitress expectations. Now the menu has so much variety! Takes a lot of time to decide what to get, I would honestly suggest they add photos to their menu, I found myself googling images of their plates to see what I would be getting. I decided on the Madeira Chicken with the Steak Diane. I was pleased with the size of the plates, they were pretty big! My boyfriend ordered the Charbroiled steak which he loved and enjoyed. For dessert we had 2 cheescakes! One was the smores marshmallow w/chocolate cheesecake and Graham crackers, it was good, but i would suggest they add more crackers because the chocolate was just too much to eat by itself, it would make you feel all ""eh"" after a few bites and the marshmallow with crackers would even out the taste,thats until we finished that part. The other cheesecake we ordered to go, didnt eat it til the next day, it was the Kahlua cheescake which was THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! I would definitely go buy that cheescake again and again! It was just a perfect balance of all the flavors! Loved it! Overall our experience here was very good! We agreed on coming back and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants now!"
Albert H.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/15/2017,"This Chum Bucket has a grand appeal, the restaurant looks and feels like a top grade restaurant. The workers are friendly and dress semi professional. There's lots of tourist due to Disneyland being down the street. The restaurant attracts a lot of people whether it be people that are local or people from the deep blue sea. The food on the other hand looks amazing but tastes like it was made with little to 0 seasonings. I guess it's safe to say that they still haven't found the secret formula.  Sincerely, Squidward."
Brett W.,"Herriman, UT",0,12,10,5.0,6/1/2017,I really enjoyed the food. The staff was great to talk too. The waitress was wonderful and playful. I make a lot of stupped jokes and she roled with it.  Clean reastrooms witch was nice.
Andrew S.,"Santa Ana, CA",235,26,16,5.0,5/3/2017,Dear cheese factory management team.  Jose and lily gave us an exceptional service today. We are happy and would love to recommend all of our friends to come eat here because how good Jose and lily were. Thanks again! And have a excellent day
Ozzie G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,"Service could have been better, no happy hour at your table, tried to push you out the door"
