Tracy E.,"Palm Springs, CA",90,166,128,4.0,9/22/2014,"Had dinner here the other night. The place was  packed with customers. The wait wasn't long though. The staff was attentive to the customers needs. Our waiter, Tommie, was great. He had his A game going for sure. We didn't have to ask for refills on drinks or bread. The food was served in a timely manner. The deserts were perfect and very tasty too."
Norma L.,"Garden Grove, CA",132,193,62,4.0,9/16/2010,"For some strange reason, I really wanted to come here.  So we did! (yes, I call the shots).  We had the sweet tamale corn cakes for an appetizer...OMG these are sooooo good! These would be good for an entree!  If you're a fan of sweet tamales you will love these! They are topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and avocado.  The sweet/savory contrast is perfect!!! I had a soup/sandwich special here with sweet potato fries. The fries are sooo good.  The soup of the day was lentil..not very good. :(  Me no likey lentil.  It just has a weird taste.  The chicken salad sandwich was okay.   The main reason I wanted to come here was to try the red velvet cheesecake.  I am addicted to red velvet.  Actually I'm not addicted because if I was I'd probably be eating it or having withdrawals, but I'm not, I'm typing this.  Anyway, I was exagerating there.  What I meant to say is that I LOVE red velvet and always try anything that is red velvet to compare it to other cakes/cupcakes I've tried.  So I guess I'm a self proclaimed red velvet cake expert now.  This cheesecake in particular in superb!!! It is so good!!! It was also a huge slice! It is worth coming here just for this!!! The cake is moist and the cheesecake is perfection! There are so many different cheesecakes here that I want to try, so I'm pretty sure I'll be back."
Angela K.,"Manhattan, NY",351,326,101,1.0,8/28/2010,"I'm not going to review the food because as other people have already mentioned, the food is just like any other Cheesecake Factory. I went with a total of 12 people for a friend's birthday, so 18% gratuity was already included. We included extra cash so that we could get change. However, we got no change because our server kept the extra cash without even giving it back to us. I thought that that was OUR decision to make, but no. She made that decision for us. Completely inappropriate."
Jenny Y.,"Cypress, CA",47,90,25,3.0,5/23/2014,"I think the food is just okay here. Nothing too tasty and the portions are way too huge for me at times. However, my sweet tooth cannot keep me from having dessert here. So many choices of cheesecakes and they are all so yum. Service is attentive and I like this location of the Cheesecake Factory. Very cozy. Located right next to Disneyland/Downtown Disney, at the Anaheim Gardenwalk=) Yay!"
mira k.,"Anaheim, CA",263,60,16,5.0,4/28/2014,"I know its a chain restaurant but what can I say I love cheesecake factory especially this location.  They have a very eclectic menu I love their fried zucchini, sweet potatoe fries, steak diane, shrimp scampi, all those small plate appetizers, banana cream and pineapple upside down cheesecakes.  The service here is spectacular I swear I've only been here maybe 5 or 6 times in the last 18 months and this waiter Ahmad always remembers me and my cousins, he even remembered my 6 year-old cousins name.  I cant remember ever having a bad experience at a cheesecake factory."
Cathy G.,"Littlerock, CA",0,11,1,5.0,3/6/2015,I eat there whenever I go to Disneyland. I've only ordered the Renee Special because it's sooo good. I would drive out there from the AV even if I wasn't going to Disneyland - it's that good
Christopher T.,"Santa Ana, CA",271,92,246,3.0,9/8/2010,"This review goes out to all the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to as well. It isn't great, but it isn't all that bad. I've been to this location, one in Rancho Cucamonga, the one in Irvine and several others. They're all the same I believe. It's a rollercoaster of up's and down's. Cheesecake Factory = Inconsistency, but for some reason I always end up coming back. Actually it's all my mother's fault. It's her favorite restaurant. Thanks ma. -_- Every time I visit Cheesecake Factory though, I notice that they seem to be on top of their game with keeping the place clean and tidy. That's a definite plus in my book considering I'm pretty clean/tidy/organized myself. Honest. Well what I mean by inconsistency, it pertains mainly to the food & service. I'll start with the service. It all begins when you walk through the doors and you're greeted by the host/hostess. Sometimes they can be totally friendly. Other times they can be rude to the max! Same deal applies to the waiters/waitresses. I just don't understand it. Maybe you need amazing timing and a little bit of luck to receive the best customer service. I don't know. The food is inconsistent as well. I pretty much order the same things when I'm here. Cajun Chicken Littles, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, or the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Can you tell I like spicy food? :) Anyway, sometimes the Cajun Chicken Littles can be amazing one day, then lame another. They're battered and deep fried, so they're meant to be crispy right? Well it's not like that all the time. I get the feeling that they're microwaved because sometimes they wouldn't be crispy at all! More like soft and chewy. UGH! Grumble grumble. No real complaints about the other items that I order. Oh also, everyone knows that they serve you free bread as you decide on what to order. Don't really care that much for it, but sometimes the bread is stale, could be day old. Just saying. I swear I don't come here by choice. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with. It's just a family gathering spot. I'll have to talk my mother into picking a new place for uniting the family. Toodles!"
Josue S.,"Perris, CA",9,7,3,5.0,5/26/2014,"Tiffany S was our server and oh my goodness. She is a wonderful server who made our lunch a great time. She was on top of getting our order when we sat down, refilling our drinks on time, and getting is extra bread. She has made it an easy for us to come back and eat at the Cheesecake Factory. She was always smiling and bringing positive vibes. The food was awesome. Just the right serving size. Overall great! Thanks Tiffany."
Chau N.,"Downey, CA",129,65,14,4.0,6/25/2013,"-My first time coming here was today - I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (shrimp/chicken) it suppose to be spicy but I thought it was mild for my taste - Ordered Chris' Outragerous Cheesecake (chocolate, pecan, coconut shred) - Server was nice but me and my friend had to wait quite a while and at the end he gave us a wrong check lol - Over all I enjoyed the food a lot, quite yummy! :)"
Eli B.,"Orange, CA",5,43,,5.0,1/26/2015,"Love this restaurant they never have disappointed us! Brought our friends the other day and they were really amazed that cheesecake did such a great brunch! It was an awesome double date! Their bread is delicious and they have so may drink options including skinny drinks! Appetizers love their lettuce wraps and their skinny menu also! Miso salmon is one of my favorites and their pizza and pasta dishes are also very good. So many things on menu from mexican to orange chicken. Went for our first time to brunch as it was delicious!!! Lemon ricotta pancakes, green chilaquiles, and sunrise chicken Chorizo and I haven't gotten to the desserts!!! 5 stars all the way! They have the best customer service if u don't like something they will make right"
Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,3.0,5/24/2011,"Cheesecake Factory used to be my life until their service started going downhill. Either way, I still try to hold to CF because I've had good memories at this chain.  My best advice still at this place is to split a meal. With the complementary bread and butter that they provide, it's hard for anyone (including my big appetite) to even come close to finishing a meal, let alone dessert. However, if you split a meal, enjoy their bread, you'll still have enough room (just barely!) for a yummy cheesecake slice.  Our group got the: 1. PASTA CARBONARA (veggie style, no bacon, no chicken)     - still delicious. I recommend this to anyone who's never had it before. It's heavy, but the garlic-parmesan sauce is fantastic. I still think the bacon gives it a kick, but my friend was vegetarian...so no bueno Mr.Bacon. Next time.  2. GARLIC NOODLES        - my other veggie friend got this. I had a taste of it...meh, to be honest, Yardhouse Garlic noodles on their appetizer menu was way better, plus Yardhouse happy hour offers it half-off, making it $5.  3. PASTA BELLAGIO     - Angel hair with 3-4 thinly sliced breaded chicken with garlic basil pesto. Not bad, I loved the combo of the sauce, however, they must've added extra salt. The pasta itself was extremely salty (my friend and I each drank 3 glasses of water), but the chicken was fine. Maybe it was the Prosciutto that gave it the super salty kick.  Our last friend ordered a salad...but she can't remember which salad it was because she really didn't have much of her own salad...more of everyone else's pasta... Lastly we got the GODIVA CHEESECAKE and the 30th ANNIVERSARY CHEESECAKE. The Godiva one is, you guessed, very chocolate-y. You get over it. But the 30th one, man, it's just...unbelievable. It's layers of the original cheesecake with the chocolate fudge cheesecake, and then with a huge side of whip cream and little chocolate flakes on top of the cake. YUMMY. I always get the 30th. It's too good to pass up.  Also another reason to get the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake: ""The Cheesecake Factory is proud to donate $0.25 from the sale of each slice of the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake sold this year to the national hunger-relief organization, Feeding America (formerly America's Second Harvest).""  Hey, you can now eat and not feel guilty about it. Win."
Carolanne T.,"Redlands, CA",5,7,,1.0,8/19/2015,"I almost didn't want to leave a yelp review because cheesecake factories almost always exceed my expectations. The food is great and the atmosphere is nice as well. Unfortunately no matter how good the atmosphere or food may be a restaurant will only be as good as its staff. This evening me and friends dined at this location after a long day at Disneyland. We were tired, and hungry, so we were looking forward to a relaxing dinner. We were greeted promptly with the soup of the day and asked if we were ready. I asked the server if the bread had any eggs or dairy in it, since I am vegan and was given a snark response by our waitress that of course the bread has eggs in it ""because it's bread"". I felt like an idiot although I don't think she really knew what was in the bread anyways. I also asked for a straw twice and was rudely ignored after bringing only one straw for my boyfriend which she plopped in the water abruptly after several times of asking. She said that she wasn't allowed to bring straws for water, but upon request you should be handed a straw that is preferably wrapped. Our waitress Araka O. was our server and although she seemed to connect to the other couple at our table she was incredibly rude to me for God knows why. I understand if she was having a bad day but if your going to work somewhere that is down the street from The happiest place on earth at least try to fake being nice."
Candace M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",49,42,47,1.0,4/28/2015,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory but the customer service at this location is beyond horrible!  It was my daughters birthday on Sunday and We had a group of 11 people.  We called around 5:00pm to find out if we could make a reservation for the same night. The person who Answered the phone was rude and not helpful.  He wouldn't give us an estimated time to expect to wait or take our reservation.  We asked if we were there right now, how long would the wait be and he said well it could be anywhere from 10 minutes or 2 hours.  Which is it?   So we decided to drive to the location.  We arrived about 5:45pm on Sunday. We put our name in for 11 people and asked how long the wait would be. They spent 15 minutes trying to figure it out and still couldn't give an approximate time.  The hostess would leave the counter to walk around and look and then come back as clueless as she was when she left.  We ended up leaving and eating at California pizza kitchen right next door. This Cheesecake Factory sucked for their customer service.  Very disappointed. You would think being close to Disneyland that they would be used to being busy and have competent workers on staff who know how to give approximate wait times."
Lindsey P.,"Carlsbad, CA",511,412,454,5.0,4/6/2011,"I know, I know...it's the Cheesecake Factory...so why did I give this restaurant 5 stars? The Seared Tuna Tataki Salad!!  OMG this is amazing! If you like sushi and asian food, you will love this salad...even I love this this salad and I am a tough cookie when it comes to salads! Description:  Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado,  Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette.  We were in Anaheim for a volleyball tournament and came over here for a late dinner. My friend and I sat at the bar, we didn't want to wait for a table or one more minute than was necessary to eat. Friendly, knowledgeable service from the bar staff and they validate parking if you park in the attached garage for the plaza. My friend took home a slice of Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake that she said was to die for - It looked really good!"
Tammy P.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,1,,5.0,1/30/2016,"There were 12 of us on vacation, we had dinner here. I have to say it was one of the best if not the best experience I have had while dining out. Our waiter Carnell was awesome! He took all of our orders without writing anything down..they were all spot on!! Our glasses were never empty, the food was great, and Carnell was a lot of fun and showed how much he loved his job! We will be back next year!"
Bryan D.,"North Vancouver, Canada",46,137,36,5.0,11/7/2010,"Amazing. A highlight of my trip to Anaheim for DIsneyland and Blizzcon 2010. I walked past it the first night and then on my second decided to give it a try. The wait for a table was thirty minutes, but given how busy they looked that was acceptable to me. Service: Incredible. Extremely friendly and attentive waitress. There in an instance if I needed anything. Great recommendations on what to try from the menu. Food: Very well done. I had sweet corn fritters, and the pork chop meal. Everything arrived at just the right time and the quality was just amazing. Decor: I loved the look of this restaurant a lot. When I left for my vacation I wanted to go to a place I could not in Canada where I live.  I highly recommend this stop if you are going ot Disneyland."
Vincent C.,"Rochester, NY",196,99,2062,4.0,3/30/2014,"Yum Yum. I don't think anything can go wrong at any Chessecake Factory. There can be good or bad days... Anyway, I had the pasta de Vince, which was great. This restaurant is located near the land of the great Mickey Mouse."
Kimmy P.,"Garden Grove, CA",357,89,40,1.0,3/19/2014,"MUST READ BEFORE COMING HERE. My friend's and I had waited about 15 minutes to be seated. When we were seated the waiter asked what we would like to drink. Waters with lemon for now please. Sure he said, I'll be back with those. He comes back and forgets the lemon so we kindly remind him. He comes back to take our food orders, a friend ordered the chicken parmesan, and the other orders a pasta and I ordered the cobb salad.  We waited for the lemon and eventually my friend got up and asked him again. (please keep in mind that we're persistent because I am ill and I need the lemon to balance out a taste of metal I have from treatments). He said he forgot and that he will come back with it. Low and behold he came back alright...with three toothpicks and lemons skewed on them that he was holding with his hands. WHY WAS IT NOT IN A BOWL! Doesn't that violate some rules? I ended up not drinking anything and we did not use those lemons. Then our food comes out and my friends liked how their dishes looked and I looked down at mine and I see apples in it...I don't think a cobb salad had apples. So I asked our waiter if this was a cobb salad and he said no, that I had ordered a different salad. I said okay... just miscommunication. I would like a cobb salad please, so he took it back. I told my friends to go ahead and eat without me because I didn't want their food to get cold.15 minutes later my salad still didn't come out. My friend goes up to another waitress and she said she'll let our waiter know. He finally comes back with the cobb salad and as I take out my utensils THEY WERE FILTHY!! There was food stuck to the fork still!! I just wanted to eat already so my friend grabbed another setting from another table. Digging into my salad I still see beans. WHAT..THE..HECK...Since when did a cobb salad have beans?? We were so irritated at this point and I said screw it I'll just take them out. We finished our meal and the bill came. We had told the waiter before that it was our friend's birthday but I guess they don't do anything for birthdays here.  We were so tired and irritated that we didn't even want to order dessert anymore.  Anyway, the bill comes out and we got charged for that mistaken salad. Come on dude....get something right please!! We tell him and he said he would change it for us. At this point I think he knows that he just messed up our whole dinner and asks for the assistant manager or someone to stop by our table. She asked us how our meal was and we didn't want to get him into trouble so we just said that it wasn't what we expected and there were some mishaps. She said she was sorry for our experience and that they would try to improve it next time. No compensation for anything, just that. Whatever...This place is UNSANITARY, UNPROFESSIONAL,  AND HAVE A HORRIBLY TRAINED STAFF. DO NOT WANT TO COME BACK AGAIN."
Rosalie B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",73,15,173,5.0,9/18/2010,"I started writing my review about this location while we were on vacation in Anaheim but didn't get a chance to finish. So, here it goes... Ahh... The atmosphere @ this location is phenomenal especially if it's just a walking distance from where we are staying (Worldmark by Wyndham). The service was one of the BEST! And as for the food, exceptional!!!"
Yan Y.,"Pendleton, OR",3,16,17,5.0,9/5/2013,"This restaurant has an atmosphere perfect as a follow up to Disneyland, not too crowded, but busy and grandiose. The wait was short, the staff amiable, and the food! Wow it was surprisingly delicious (maybe this is helped by the fatigue of a long day). You'll definitely get your money's worth, both in taste and quantity. I suggest the tomato basil pasta and the grilled salmon."
