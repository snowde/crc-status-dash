Belle N.,"Irvine, CA",381,606,333,4.0,7/20/2012,"7/13/12 On a warm Friday the 13th, we decided to head out and cool our parched lips by heading down to the Gardenwalk...we weren't hungry for dinner and instead of waiting for a table we snagged one at the bar area woohoo! This place was packed...we had Lisa serve us and she was quick and witty...she got us our drinks and I even ordered the Mushroom wraps...it was on their skinny menu and pretty darn good!! I would definitely try it again, it's Vegetarian and yet pretty filling and tasted good to boot!...Btw Lisa was amazingly cute and spunky which made us enjoy our time there even more! We'd definitely want her to serving our table again next time!!"
Magdalena S.,"Colma, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/28/2015,"I rarely post reviews but here I am writing one, while in the car, leaving the restaurant. Why? Because we had THE. BEST. SERVICE. EVER!! Our waitress, MICHELLE H. was amazing!! She went above and beyond to make sure our kiddos (3 yrs & 17 months) were happy and content....at 9pm after five, long days in Disneyland. She quickly brought bread, got our kiddos food order immediately, brought my 3 year old his lemonade and then brought my 17 month old water mixed with just a splash of lemonade (and gave it to us first so we could decide whether we wanted him to have it) and then even brought out sliced bananas for them while they waited for our food. Little things that really helped our tired kids enjoy their dinner - and therefore making us enjoy our dinner. She was sweet, polite, efficient, helpful but not overly, annoyingly chatty (which I personally don't like). I really don't know what else to say, other than that she was absolutely wonderful. Thank you Michelle, for a wonderful experience.  Oh! The food was yummy, as usual. If you aren't familiar, Cheesecake Factory has HUGE portions and pretty good food. My husband LOVES the Cajun Chicken Littles. We never have room for cheesecake but have taken it to go before and it's wonderful."
Jordan H.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/22/2014,Came here a few nights ago after a long day at work with some co-workers and I must say that this was the absolute best service I have ever received at a restaurant in my life! Our server Corey was awesome! We were all exhausted and bummed out when we came in and he turned that around completely! Corey had us laughing hysterically to the point that we were crying. His customer service that he provided us was phenomenal. The food was great. There's not one bad thing I could say about our experience. Thank you for exceptional service and an amazing experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. We owe it to you Corey! You're awesome. We will definitely be back when we are in town.
Kim H.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,16,,1.0,12/24/2014,"Just had lunch here and had the worst dining experience EVER at a Cheesecake Factory.  My daughter has celiac so we ordered a GF pasta dish for her.  It come out CONTAMINATED with regular/gluten pasta.  When I asked the manager about it, she told me that all pastas are cooked in the same water but in different holders.  Being a celiac expert that she believes she is, she advises me that the gluten does not cross and that there is no contamination.  WHAT AN IDIOT.   Based on this experience, this Cheesecake Factory location will no longer be on our list of restaurants to visit.  STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE A CELIAC OR ARE GLUTEN SENSITIVE.  They haven't a clue!!!"
Laura G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",493,687,64,3.0,2/2/2013,"Solid and reliable. Love the new ""skinny menu"". Also a decent happy hour. I have my favorites - miso salmon, summer shrimp rolls, coconut shrimp, avocado rolls....  My only critique is that a lot of the food and sauces are over seasoned."
Tanya C.,"Westminster, CA",0,43,,5.0,10/19/2015,"I have been to this location about 5 times and the service is always great. They're always packed, but he staff is still punctual and polite. I prefer this location over the Huntington Beach one."
James P.,"San Diego, CA",174,42,52,1.0,9/16/2012,"The waiter said The Cheesecake Factory did not serve water..... We ended up spending $10 on drinks.... What the????!?!?!?! He stood there for a whole minute and never even said just kidding about the water. The food was alright. At the end of the service, he pressured us into getting cheesecake, AFTER we said we did not have a stomach for it. Waiter was rude, smelled, and quite obnoxious. I still can't believe he made us spend $10 on drinks.."
Laura S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,9,3,2.0,7/25/2012,"Maybe  you need to go to the Cheesecake factory multiple times to find something that's good, but I'm probably not going back to find out. We went here for lunch and was disappointed.  The service wasn't very good- inattentive and our water was only filled once and we were there for more than an hour. A member of our party got the lunch Hawaiian pizza and it was alright. I got the lunch special with soup, salad, and half a sandwich. The sandwich was a sandwich, but the salad and soup were actually gross. The salad was limp for spending too long in it's bath of dressing. The soup was ""White cheddar broccoli""- which is why I got the lunch special. It sounded delicious- it looked and had the texture of baby food.  I love soup- I did not love this soup.  The waitress asked if I wanted to take the soup with me and I said no. I guess she could tell how I felt about it because she also admitted it was a little baby food/poo- esque.  We got a couple pieces of cheesecake to share and they were okay.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, perhaps I should have read about what other people have gotten and liked, but when five people go and only one gets an adequate lunch- it's disappointing."
Grace L.,"Brea, CA",482,988,101,5.0,8/23/2010,"Super fast, huge portions and decent pricing. I don't have to rave about the complimentary sourdough and wheat bread they give, right? The wheat is absolutely delish. It's enough to ensure that I would never be on a low-carb diet, I LOVE bread too much! The Luau Chicken salad. What a superb salad. If you're a restaurant that serves salad as an entree, please take some notes. Portions are large enough for a meal (maybe 2).  The crispy ""cracker"" with glaze and macadamia nuts are a great addition and makes a huge statement with this salad. I will definitely be back for more!"
Noemi B.,"Anaheim, CA",266,29,3,1.0,2/19/2014,"Very rude service. Slow to get your food, expensive, and hard bread . The cheesecake is amazing , but I went there for my birthday and was humiliated in front of the whole restaurant! Our waitress dropped the money when she picked up the bill and chased me down angry claiming I didn't pay her ! She didn't realize the money was dropped on the floor and said a sarcastic remark to me like it was my fault ! Never going back!"
Jim K.,"Camarillo, CA",1371,503,3770,2.0,7/9/2014,It was not quite what I expected it was pretty good not as good as I was hoping for but not terrible. good service. the food was ok. for the price it was weak i think but taking into account its close to Disneyland they can trap unsuspecting tourist here who wont be back
Liz P.,"Lansdale, PA",6,63,1,3.0,3/18/2013,"About what I expected...okay food, but fantastic cheesecake! My party of 7 was seated promptly and received excellent customer service.  My filet definitely was not worth the $29 - stay cheap at the factory for dinner and go crazy on dessert, folks! That is all. :)"
Jess B.,"Long Beach, CA",338,477,14,5.0,7/14/2015,"this review has mostly to do with the customer service we received while dining at the bar this past saturday night.  michael and ethan (specifically) made this trip stand out in our minds!   knowing it was saturday and being that this location is very near dland, my bf and i had pretty much already decided to dine at the bar in the sake of saving time waiting for a table.  two seats opened up as we arrived and we sat down.  turns out two of our friends were going to join us unexpectedly as well, so one of the barbacks made up the two spots that opened up next to us for our friends who walked in shortly thereafter.   the food was great, as usual, but the service, conversation and overall atmosphere created by the bartender and backs was what really stood out to us this trip.  everything arrived quickly, with a smile...the convo was great...we really just had an outstanding evening and will definitely return again SOON and find a seat at the bar as long as michael and ethan are workin!"
Haley L.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",2,24,385,4.0,10/31/2012,"We only go here when we go to Anaheim to see a baseball game , otherwise it gets too busy at the location in San Diego . We love the resses cheesecake! So good! This place can get pricy if you don't order a lunch special or dinner special. Food is always pretty good just the place can get pricy . Overall not too bad though ."
Krystal C.,San Francisco Bay Area,97,276,105,4.0,1/9/2011,"After a long day at Disneyland, we were starved. The Cheesecake Factory was within walking distance to our hotel so we decided to come here. Let me start of by saying I'm not a fan of the cheesecake factory at ALL. The SF location always has a ridiculous wait time and the food is never really worth it. With that said, I had low expectations for this visit. We started off with a couple cocktails. Hubby had the ultimate margarita and I had the cucumber martini, both drinks were perfect. There were soo many menu options that we decided to just split a few small plates: -Tex Mex Eggrolls -Spicy Ahi Tuna Rolls -Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (this was my fav, one of the best salads I've ever eaten) This meal really hit the spot. Everything came out quick and was cooked to perfection. The service was also good. There was no wait time for our table and our waitress was personable (but not overwhelming). This is the perfect go-to spot after a day at Disney!!!"
Richard M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",60,39,,1.0,8/27/2014,"I have been to nearly every cheesecake factory between mission Viejo and Hollywood. So the LA county and Orange County. This is by far the WORST cheesecake factory I have been to.  To start, the entire restaurant was empty when we got there and they sat us down right next to a loud party in a corner.  That was already uncomfortable. I asked if they could move us away from them and they said they couldn't do it. Alright fine we waited for them to leave and we were fine. Except for the fact that all their dirty dishes were left there the entire 2 hours we were there. Bus boys not working there or something?  Not one thing was done right. Waited about 10 min to get our drink orders taken. Appetizers (fried macoroni) came out cold,  and swimming In sauce.  Bread came second (they didnt even bring it. They asked if we wanted it)  at that it was cold and uncut.  None of our plates were taken away (incliding appetizer plates and bread basket) until the dessert came. Our food came out burnt, fruit was sour and has gone bad. Ordered fies....those came out cold. Did I mention we got absolutely no refills?? The dessert was the only thing that was done half right. The half was correct was the half where the cheesecake tasted good and was brought out quickly. The wrong part is that we told them it was my friends birthday and they did nothing for them.  There is a cheesecake factory just a couple miles up the freeway in Brea. They have not messed up a single time  I would strongly encourage that you go their as you will get the service that you paid for. I am NEVER coming back here again."
Brian L T.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,124,93,5.0,4/3/2012,"I've been to Cheesecake Factories all across Southern California and they are all pretty good. One of the best things about this franchise is that its consistently good. However, this Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond. My business partner and I had just finished a convention nearby and were looking for something open at 1030 on a Sunday night. Even though they were about to close, we were still promptly seated next to a window seat, specifically requested since we were indoors all day, and had an amazing server called Sarah-May (sp?). We were never rushed, harassed for the cheque, or treated differently.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory, I get the exact same thing - the pan-seared salmon over angel hair pasta, capers, and spinach. It tastes as good as it sounds, but unfortunately this branch did not have it on their menu. I ventured to ask Sarah why, and she said they'd try to make it for me without a moment's hesitation.  Venturing to the kitchen, she asked her manager about it, looked up the recipe from another Cheesecake factory, and made it exactly to spec. Talk about imitative! I have not experienced better service like this in a long, long time. Most other places would've said ""well, this ain't that other branch"" over some finger snaps and sass. Overall, I cannot compliment Sarah-May and her crew enough for giving us nothing short of an extraordinary, amazing end to the night. These superstars definitely put the S in Service."
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,5/7/2012,My friend and I came in on a Friday night and I thought for sure that we were gonna have to wait...but we didn't!  We were seated right away and the service for the whole night was excellent.  My friend got a sandwich and I got a pasta dish which they let me make some changes to without any hassle.  Both were great and we left stuffed and buzzed.  If I'm in the area again I would definitely come here again.
Amy L.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,14,4,5.0,10/20/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is always super dependable! Service was quick and friendly. Food came super quick - and that's a big plus when there are two little kiddies at the table. Portions are generous. We had salad named ""Sheila's"" - really good. Pulled-pork sandwich - delish! Angelhair pasta with shrimp - yum.  Our server was so helpful - he even offered to wash/rince our baby's table mat!! Bravo!"
Amy C.,"Sacramento, CA",287,146,262,5.0,9/11/2014,"Great food! HUGE portions!! Large menu with hundreds of choices!! Good prices! Fun environment for food, fun, awesome bar!! Close to Disneyland. ..stop by and have an amazing piece of cheescake!"
