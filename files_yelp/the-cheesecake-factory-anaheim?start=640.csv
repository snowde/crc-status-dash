Sean K.,"Irvine, CA",35,188,,3.0,12/17/2012,"Epitome of A-OK american restaurant in terms of dinner and drinks. But for just cheesecake, I would give 4 stars for sure. However, it always rounds itself down with other stuff. Prices are little higher than many other typical american restaurants and the food is ok. I have been to cheesecake factory a LOT of times in many different cities and it never once blew my mind away. I almost think that if cheesecake factory focused more on desserts, esp cheesecake, instead of so many other different lunch/dinner menus, it will be more successful... like The Melting Pot! Sure you can have few select good dinner menus - perhaps recommended by the customers? - but just focus on the thing you are good at: DESSERTS.  I rather eat cheaper, better food elsewhere and go to Cheesecake Factory for desserts only. It's just better and more efficient that way. :D"
Barbra D.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,19,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"PEOPLE WITH SEAFOOD ALLERGIES BEWARE!!!!! If you want to enjoy anything fried, The Cheesecake Factory does not have separate fryers or oil to fry their seafood separately from the avocado egg rolls or fries or anything else they fried!!!! Very disappointing from such a huge company! I am allergic to seafood so I have to be careful and many places are good about cross contamination but The Cheesecake Factory is not so please be careful! They don't care to change that either! Very disappointed!"
Alberto D.,"Garden Grove, CA",27,30,25,5.0,3/10/2014,"This place only keeps getting better and better for me. I started with the chicken plates which are ok and then I tried the Kobe burger and Wow was it amazing; I then had it four more times before I got up the courage to try something else, so I got the chile Relleno burger and wow that was also great. I would have never guessed that the best burgers I have ever had would come from Cheesecake Factory! The cheesecake is also good I personally recommend the Chocate Godiva; but next time you come here please try the Kobe burger it is somethig special."
Kevin A.,"Buena Park, CA",206,90,25,4.0,12/10/2012,I've come to this location several times now.. and everytime Ive come here I've had great service. The waits are never usually too long since they have plenty of seating. I've never had any problems with the service as they never had a problem checking up on the tables.  I've ordered several things from the menu and everything I've had is pretty good. If you've never had their brunch here you need to go and try it! The chilliquilles is amazing and so is their french toast! They also have a pretty good happy hour!  So if you're ever in the area or looking for a nice place to eat after disneyland I would reccomend this place.
Jonathan H.,"Anaheim, CA",64,172,8,2.0,6/7/2012,"I'm going to average out my experiences here. Okay is what describes Cheesecake Factory. You'll never get phenomenal. I feel that their menu is so huge that they can't focus on perfecting any dish. That being said, I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta on one occasion. It was, like I said above, okay. They used a lot of mushrooms to fill up the dish. I've also tried a ""special"" they had one night: pecaned salmon with assorted veggies. This dish was beyond awful. The salmon was dried out, the pecan tasteless. It was a disaster to say the least. However, their cheesecakes are pretty good, though they are ultra sweet and heavy. As for service, my experiences have varied. I've had a waitress give some attitude and stink eyes before. But I've also had the staff man up to a mistake and take an item off the bill. You really don't know what you're gonna get here. Might as well throw a dart at the menu and hope you end up with an okay dish."
Bernice M.,"Windsor, Canada",19,83,17,5.0,4/7/2013,"I've been to a location in Florida and one in Chicago. The experience was OK. I was at this location last night, and it was by far one of the best meals that I've had in ages. The wine was perfect, the food was excellent. I was out with a group and tried several cheesecakes: they were all wonderful.  I will definitely make a trip to the one in the Detroit area very soon."
Gina I.,"Vancouver, Canada",182,479,74,4.0,10/19/2012,"I've been to 5 different Cheesecake Factory's now..  Avocado spring rolls - to die for. I don't know what they put in that sauce that goes with them, but it's like crack. You cannot stop. Their little plates are also delish - endive and walnut salad... pear & blue cheese flatbread. All yummy. Never a complaint when I come. Try their pineapple mojito! p.s. their marinara spaghetti was better than the 'italian' spaghetti I had in palm springs at an 'italian' resto!"
Gerardo T.,"San Jose, CA",9,45,20,4.0,3/31/2013,"So hard to decide what to order, menu is so huge and diverse...but good service and food..noisy place and too dark at night.."
Shaun I.,"Fullerton, CA",164,81,82,4.0,8/19/2014,"Cheesecake is an always go too, wide variety of food and i have never been here when the service is bad. People are friendly, been here multiple times, try not to sit next to the kitchen its a bit loud but other than that, great and consistent food, good location to do more than just eat."
Fenny L.,"Long Beach, CA",19,102,17,5.0,7/3/2014,"I love this Cheesecake Factory.  I came here more than 10 times and the Service and food never fail to satisfy me.  My favorites are the salads; Santa Fe salad, ahi salad, and fried chicken salad.  They all taste so gourmet and delicious! Their appetizers are great as well such as calamari, crab wontons, and texmex egg rolls.  For meat lovers, the Kobe burger is a maZing!"
R B.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,5.0,11/10/2014,"We were staying in Anaheim for Blizzcon 2014 convention and we told ourselves we were gonna get Cheesecake Factory. We have one locally and we have eaten at the one in San Diego but our experience here was by far the best we have ever had, from the immediate/quick seating (no wait-although we have come to expect atleast a 30min wait anywhere), to the friendly host that sat us, to the wonderful watress Erica, to the super delicious and quick food. Erica greeted us with a friendly smile and took our drink order and also brought us the bread. We then ordered Fried Cheese and within a matter of minutes it was out of the fryer and on our table. Cripsy, flaky, ooey-gooey goodness. We then ordered our entree's, Hubby had the Shepard's Pie and I had the Skinnylicious Asian lettuce chicken tacos. And  .god. They were delicious. It was the freshest bite of food I had ever tasted. Like the first bite of Spring with the perfect blend of textures, spices, flavors, and crispiness. Hubby's Shepard's Pie was also fantastic. It was dense, moist, creamy, with a awesome sauce, crisp veggies, and perfectly seasoned ground beef. It melted in your mouth. Both dishes just wonderful!! We were never without drinks and Erica checked on us multiple times to make everything was tasting good and that we had everything we needed. Now it was time for dessert. We ordered one piece of Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake to share and it was so creamy, decadent, smooth, fresh, and moist. Excellent combo if you enjoy carrot cake and cheesecake. Our experience at this location was all we could talk about for hours after we left. We were so happy with everything they offered, their wonderful service, and incredibly delicious food. Thank you Erica and the Chef's at Anaheim Cheesecake Factory. We love you! :):)"
Adam G.,"Orange, CA",0,38,,4.0,11/30/2015,The restaurant is nice inside. There's always a little bit of a wait about 15 to 20 minutes. The food is good nothing special about it. But the deserts are great!
Michelle N.,"Makawao, HI",25,11,3,3.0,10/4/2014,"Such a busy place, we were quite impressed to get a table within about 15 minutes of showing up for dinner. The service was good and the menu extensive.  I had the shepherds pie, which was a generous helping but the added ginger threw off the taste. The cheesecake was the best, as expected.  I had the key lime and mango cheesecake and my daughter had the chocolate. Just delicious!"
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,5.0,12/8/2009,"I love this Cheesecake Factory!  Our usual go-to location is at the Irvine Spectrum. It's cozy, often crowded and kind of farther from the shops I like to go to. But this location is NICE BRIGHT and AIRY! You can actually walk through here and not get all claustrophobic!  I'm sure a lot of tourists dine here, but we came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all.  The portions are usually huge, so I didn't get to taste any of the Red Velvet cheesecake that called my name. Maybe next time... or maybe on the night of 6.30.2010!"
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,3.0,8/12/2010,"It tastes like any other Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain restaurant.  At this particular Cheesecake Factory, you can make reservations up till 5:30pm. After 5:30pm, you have to wait.  The salisbury steak entree is $3 more than what you'd find in the ""city."" But it was definitely a lot bigger. So you sort of did get your money's worth. It tasted pretty good. It tasted extremely good the night after when I had it for breakfast. We bought a huge oreo cheese cake. 7 inches. It was really good. We had to wait 1-2 hours after we bought it since it needed time to thaw. If you want to buy a whole cheesecake, let them know ahead of time so they'll take it out of the freezer for you."
Michelle S.,"La Habra, CA",54,57,,4.0,12/21/2012,Brunch before the game! Yummy! Brunch is great. The server was super nice and offered great advice.  Food was delicious! Great start before going into an Angel Game
Joseph H.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/20/2015,"Our Waitress Michelle was great but the food was horrible. When we asked to speak to a manager,a guy came to us and was very less then accommodating. The Biscuits for the chicken and Biscuits were burnt,and he had the nerve to say that was the new recipe!! The shrimp was like rubber,and my daughters Angel Hair pasta was nothing but tomatoes,and no pasta. I could go on and on,bottom line is the Manager was a jerk and should not be in the business of Hospitality and Customer service. I have never experienced this kind of service from someone with a Management role in my life!!"
Jen R.,"Alamogordo, NM",30,10,3,4.0,9/13/2014,Busy Friday night and seating was not well coordinated. Waitress was very friendly and did a great job! Manager was friendly and the food was wonderful! Would definitely go back but would likely try for a less busy time.
Kevin C.,"Anaheim, CA",3,26,5,3.0,6/3/2014,"The food was ok at this location. The service however was outstanding. I hate to complain about food, but I do let the servers know when it doesn't taste right. No questions asked he removed the order from our table and comped us the meal. That is great customer service."
Bree M.,"Anaheim, CA",39,79,16,3.0,1/19/2014,"The food is excellent! I am not a fan of the dim atmosphere since it makes it hard to read the menu, and by menu I mean the novel. Every cheesecake never disappoints. Tuxedo=amazing. Last weekend was the first time I went to this particular location. The service was fast for a Friday evening. The waiter (Corey) was nice, but way too sarcastic. His lame flirting with my friend got extremely old by the time my food came out. I also was very disappointed he did not validate my parking ticket. He brought it back to me and I thought the new printed bar code was a validation. It wasn't. I ended up having to pay for parking. It was on 3$ but inconvenient considering I was only there for an hour. I called the manager and he said he would refund me but it's too much of a hassle with Disney right there trying to turn around and re enter parking structure to park for a few bucks :/"
