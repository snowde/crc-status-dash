Sneha P.,"Artesia, CA",75,25,1,4.0,7/18/2014,Had a great time with friends! They were able to make special drinks that my husband requested which was nice of them! Love their Oreo cheesecake and tiramisu
Jacqueline P.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,17,1,3.0,10/14/2014,Lemon Drop Martini! That's all I can say. Recently tried the drink here and I loved it. I'm giving this place 3 stars because I strongly agree that the food prices are exaggerating. $20 for an OK size plate? The food is alright but not to die for.  I also dislike the wait time if you want to get seated. You are better off sitting by the bar if there are any seats available that is. Bad idea to come on a weekend if you aren't willing to wait. Other than that i can see myself coming back here just for the drink. Not the food.
Neil P.,"Fairfield, CA",1,47,1,2.0,8/5/2014,"Visited on a Wednesday night after a Disneyland day.  I had a $25 giftcard, and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Figured on vacation in SoCal was a good a time as any to try it out. Unfortunately, it wasn't all that impressive. Place was swamped when we walked in around 6:00pm.  Quoted 30 minute wait, but it turned out to be closer to 45.   No issues with service, we had two servers who handling everything better than we could have asked for.  Always refilling drinks and bread without us having to ask. Kitchen.  A bit slow.  There were six of us, and after ordering the waitress came over and told me they were out of the Chicken & Biscuits I had ordered.  I had to get a menu and re-order.  Then, after snacking on bread for a good 20-30 minutes, by replacement order arrives, but without the rest of my family's orders.  Not sure how that happened.  But it was a solid 10 minutes before the rest of the food came.  So I was faced with either starting to eat before the rest of the table, or eating cold food.  Ordered the Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi combo.  Good steak, but only about 4 pieces, and three shrimp.  Something like $19.95.  Overpriced for a plate that was mostly mushroom gravy. Second food run brought all the food except for one.  A manager came over and told us my daughter's pizza had been burned, so they were making another.  A bit inconvenient, but not a serious problem.  But then I looked at my son's pizza, and it too was burned.  They served him a pizza that was black around the edges and dark brown/crunchy on the bottom.  Our waitress saw it and immediately offered to make a new one.  I was glad to see her take the initiative so I didn't have to send his food back to the kitchen.   Whoever was in charge of the pizza oven needs some retraining.  It was bothersome that they held back one burned pizza and remade it but served another burned pizza. In all, it was a mediocre meal that cost over $120.  Certainly not worth waiting as long as we did.  I felt bad for our waitress, since she was busting her hump to take care of us and the issues were with the kitchen, not the service. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and I didn't see anything that would make me want to come back. I've sent a copy of this to their corporate office, no response as of yet.  I'll update if they respond."
Vince G.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,2,5.0,8/3/2014,"Whenever my girlfriend and I are going to Disneyland, we stop and eat here first and we always get the best service ever! Parking is super convenient and even when there busy the wait has never been more then 10 min.. Oh ya and the food is always perfect and service is amazing"
Jeannette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",510,808,612,4.0,6/19/2012,"Wow!  There are a lot of choice on the menu - something for everybody.  I ended up going during the lunch hour so I ordered off the lunch menu.  I ordered the fish and chips.  The portion was excellent - four fish strips and fries also a side of coleslaw (did not expect this, so it felt like a bonus).  I can usually finish an entire fish and chip basket but on this occasion, I had to take some left overs.  I also ordered the Vietnamese shrimp rolls and these things are to die for - yumminess in every bite!"
Christian I.,"Anaheim, CA",90,55,,4.0,10/5/2011,"Haven't reviewed in so long that I forgot about my format. Thank you Alre. The Skinny: Shrimp Scampi w/ Steak Diane and Shepard Pie are a buy, and the Cheesecakes have yet to disappoint. Thumbs Up for.. Dude when I got the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane it was on a ginormous platter and not a single area of it was left unfilled. Sweet jesus. I usually tear up my meals, but this one had me taking it home in a to-go box. Gave my ego a reality check. And for Shrimp that size and Angus beef, I thought that was a good price. Its under the factory combinations if you're looking for it. Shepards Pie is another favorite. Basically its beef and veggies in mashed potatoes. Thats the easiest way to explain it. And as full as I always am, I ALWAYS buy dessert. Thumbs Down for.. I came in thinking I was going to inhale my food like I usually do, but they're servings had me coming home with my tail between my legs... not that that's a bad thing. Don't really have any complaints about CF."
J C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,74,4,4.0,12/14/2012,"I ate here twice last week. The food is hands down some of the best tasting food I've had outside of a 5 star restaurant that charges $75 a plate. Of course the Cheesecake Factory is much more reasonably priced, around $15-$25 a plate.  I had the Moroccan chicken one night, which was a grilled chicken on top of a bed of pearl couscous with some type of creamy tomato sauce. I don't live anywhere near a Cheesecake Factory, but I can tell you it will be worth the 1 hr drive to go there to get this dish next time I go out to dinner. :-P I also had the second night the sausage and broccolini pasta, which was incredibly good but turned out to have a bazillion calories so I only ate half of it for dinner and had the rest for lunch the next day.  My only complaint about the restaurant which is why I knocked them down a star is that they don't have the waiters and waitresses bringing out your food so there are no checks to make sure your food is correct. Out of two nights of dinners for two people (4 entrees and 2 desserts), they messed up 3 of our dishes. For example, I didn't actually order the Moroccan Chicken, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. But the Moroccan Chicken is what came, and once I started eating that they weren't going to get it back!! Also, they put onions on my husbands burger when they weren't supposed to, and they gave us the wrong type of cheesecake for dessert. Still the food was amazing, and worth it! :-)"
Marc G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,8,,5.0,9/24/2014,Geat place to eat. Never have any problems with service or food.great  selection in food and drinks. I had the bang bang chicken and is was amazing. For dessert I had the oreo cheesecake .it was very good.
Food C.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,27,14,1.0,1/21/2014,Bad service! They take big party first! We were waiting for 1 1/2 hours watching everyone that came in after us go in before us. Finally they took us in after seeing  that we were falling asleep in the waiting area. This place needs new management. Oh yeah the food here sucks too.. Do not get any pasta here. Go to California Pizza Kitchen..
Alexis B.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,5/14/2016,Wish I could give it no stars.  I ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and a skinny cosmopolitan. While eating my meal I started to not feel well.  I was with 5 other people people and did not want to make a fuss.  I ate 3 bites and almost threw up.  I took the leftovers back to my hotel room and a few hours later decided to have one of my friends smell my leftovers before I tried to eat more.  My meal was rancid.  I am not sure if it was the cream.  I admittedly called the restaurant and explained the situation.  I waited on hold for more than 15 minutes.  I finally talked with Maria the manager. She offered me a $25 gift card which does not even cover my over $36 bill.  Our total bill for our party was over $220. Maria said I should receive said gift card in a few days.  It has been a week and I have yet to receive anything. I asked Maria for a refund because I really have no desire to eat at a Cheesecake Factory again after this.  Not only did I get sick but I did not have dinner.  I was in Anaheim to run the Tinkerbell Half Marathon. I am very disappointed.
J N.,"Littlerock, CA",19,60,12,5.0,5/21/2014,Excellence. There might be a wait to get a table but its for good reason. I can't think of a single thing I've ever had here that wasnt delicious. To top that off I've had great service every single time I go.  From appetizers to desserts this place is especially great to end a great day at Disneyland.
Brooke W.,"Girard, OH",11,45,9,4.0,1/18/2015,"We have gone here twice this week. Once for dinner and the second visit was to try Sunday brunch (served Sundays until 2pm). The 4 cheese pasta, spicy chicken pasta, and fried Mac and cheese was amazing. The prices are decently priced for a high end restaurant. We spent the same here as we did at IHOP. For 2 entrées, 2 appetizers, and a cheesecake it cost about $70. Sunday brunch we both ordered the regular Belgian waffle with a side of bacon. The best waffle and bacon we have ever had. HIGHLY recommend it. Their coffee is very good If you like strong coffee. Brunch cost about $30. Our dinner experience service wise was better than our brunch experience. Both servers were polite but during brunch it seemed like the waiter had a difficult time keeping up with the tables. It took him a long time to come to our table to get our drinks and then after that we waited at least another 10 min. I didn't like being seated so close to the family next to us either when there were plenty of other tables open spread out. It was like we were sitting with them they were so close. The food is worth the money."
Tim N.,"Anaheim, CA",18,25,2,4.0,7/1/2013,"Great location! Staff is extremely friendly and I think a little of it stems from the fact that they are right next to Disneyland. I believe they are aware of the amount of tourist who might stop to dne in, which demands a higher level of service. Servers seem very knowledgable of their menu which is good. Food here is good and cheesecakes are always fabulous. Try the cooies and cream."
Ana-Alicia C.,"Dededo, Guam",32,13,11,5.0,8/3/2014,I love everything about this place. My whole family enjoys the fast service and great food. Of course we cannot go without trying at least one flavor of cheesecake. So far all the cheesecakes we have tried are to die for. Service was also excellent. Would definitely return when in Anaheim again. Worth every penny!
Rana F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",76,33,1,2.0,6/7/2015,Service was ok. The food is horrible at this location. I don't know if it's their low standards but the quality of our food was awful. The bread was stale as soon as they put it on the table and the lettuce on my chicken lettuce wraps were black all over. How could you give that to a customer. The server didn't even apologize. Her response was I will exchange the one taco left on your plate for another one. Really? I will never visit this location again!! Arcadia or fashion island is were its at!
Tej K.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",16,157,9,4.0,12/21/2013,"Happy hour at the Cheesecake Factory is awesome! Four drinks, three appetizers and a kids meal for the little one = $40!! You really can't beat that and it's much better than spending roughly the same if not more for your food inside Disneyland. We left satisfied, slightly buzzed and ready to hit the park (:"
Leasha C.,"Olympia, WA",261,584,688,1.0,4/22/2012,"My Fiance and I decided to give this place a shot since I've heard all of my friends BRAG about everything. It was after the lunch crowed so not too busy. Walked in, got seated right away (that was awesome.) We literally sat for 15 minutes with no one getting a drink order let alone food. I got pissed, got up and as we were walking about the host asked what happened. I told the host that we have yet to be asked for ANYTHING and his response was, ""They will get to you when they can."" Um, NO! I should not be sitting at a table for anything longer then 5 minutes with no offers of any sort of drinks or to place my order."
Channy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",109,148,272,4.0,3/30/2014,"Before heading to Disneyland, my boyfriend and I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. For a Sunday evening the restaurant was quite busy but not overly packed.  We were seated within 5 minutes. That past weekend I had Korean BBQ and Japanese BBQ so I was in a mood for something healthy and small.  I took to their appetizer menu and their Thai lettuce wraps sounded delicious and just what I was looking for.  Cheesecake Factory is known for their epic entrée portions and their ""appetizers"" was no exception.  When the Thai lettuce wraps came out I was in disbelief that what I had ordered was an ""appetizer"". The portions are huge! My boyfriend ordered one of their burritos and it was ginormous! The menu describes the Thai lettuce wraps as ""Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles, and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamaribd - Cashew"" and that's exactly what I got! It was very delicious!! The meal was light yet very filling. I would definitely order this again. As for drinks, my boyfriend and I ordered hot tea. They brought out a wide selection of teas to choose from accompanied with our own small hot water kettle. We were checked on various times, so definitely good customer service at this location. I headed to the happiest place on earth with a very happy tummy."
Thomas V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,4,7,5.0,7/26/2015,Great place!!!  Never had a bad experience.  Greatest bartenders and great environment!!  I would recommend this place to anyone!  Perfect 10!!
Ceci H.,"Houma, LA",12,35,1,5.0,7/17/2012,"First time at this particular location and I loved it! * delicious, fresh hamburger and fries.  * cheesecake was heaven. I got the low carb cheesecake with strawberries... absolutely delicious. * waitress was attentive, kind, and always had an authentic smile!"
