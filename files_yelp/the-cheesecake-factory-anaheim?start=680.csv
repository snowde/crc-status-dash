Sarah O.,"Covina, CA",55,64,36,4.0,6/5/2012,"As much as I frequent here and cry that we come here too often, I can't get myself to dislike cheesecake factory because service, food and atmosphere is always standard and of good quality.  If you are looking for a no fuss place for lunch or dinner, I guarantee you that cheesecake has something to please your palate.  You get your best standard casual franchised fine dining. Every location, always looks good, always tastes good.  Choices, choices! Too many choices!  My favorite items?  Chicken Costoletta, lightly breaded chicken breast, sautéed with lemon sauce,  served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Discovered on date, and a favorite ever since!  My new favorite item?  Tuscan chicken from the skinnylicious menu, grilled chicken breast with artichokes, tomatoes, capers, basil and a vinaigrette. Served with veggies and farro (looked like rice).   You get all the bang with portions but you can finish the dish and have guilt free dessert afterwards!  Cheesecake? My biggest complaint is that they discontinued my favorite cake, the tres leches cheesecake!  I'm not so picky anymore and open to try whatever my party desires to split.  Not a fan of cheesecake, like my best friend, then we go for the chocolate truffle cake, which is rich and layered with different chocolate variations from mousse, truffle and ganache!   This location has a mix of family tourists with kids running around in their crocs, casual locals grabbing a bite or some dressed up hotties looking to splurge!  This place also validates but only for an additional hour on top of the free one they give you. Want to relax during your meal, then head to Brea's Cheesecake and take your time!"
Mz P.,"Chico, CA",0,35,11,5.0,1/17/2015,"I was on vacation with my family, a party of 12, and we had great customer service. Our server was Alan, and he was awesome!! I also liked the fact that Alan didn't hover over our table, to wait for us to finish our meal and push cheesecake on us. I have had that experience before at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Thanks Alan for your great customer service."
Rachelle P.,"Lake Forest, CA",44,21,3,2.0,5/20/2014,The food...fabulous!  The service...SUCKS!  My co-workers and I went there for lunch today and we ended up spending 2 1/2 hours.
George G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",129,18,1,2.0,10/11/2013,"The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I love their food. The service on the other hand is horrible! As much as I keep going back hoping it'll be different it's not. This last visit was my final straw with this location, go to the one in Huntington Beach, it has better service.  It took our server 30 min to take our drink and food order and after that another hour to get our food. When he brought my friend her food she told him that's not what she ordered and he argued that it was. When he looked at his notes he then said ""oh we don't carry that anymore so I just ordered you the next closest thing."" As she told him she didn't want that another server bringing out the rest of the food heard them arguing and said ""we still carry that!"", explained the dish to my friend and she said ""yes!! That's what I ordered"" and the other server fixed the order for her. By the time her food came out everyone was done and our original server told us he would be back with the check. It took him FIFTY-FIVE minutes to bring our check!! In between that he would walk by and say he was coming back but never did. It wasn't until we asked for the manager an hour into our wait that he had a server (not a manager) come over and tell us he was getting our bill and would be right back.  It sucks because I love this place but because of the service I won't be coming back anymore."
ahmad m.,"Anaheim, CA",2,13,2,5.0,7/10/2014,"Always been to this CCF not only for the food but for the amazing service. Yeah sometimes there is a wait but it is worth it.. And I love the sweet dark bread they serve you while you wait. One piece of advise, portions are huge so come with an appetite or get a take away box"
Golda R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",215,525,99,1.0,8/7/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but I hated the service we got at this particular location.  Our waiter decided that he wanted to wait on the customers that came after us and pretty much left us waiting to get our drinks, bread, and order.  It was horrid and gave me a bad impression of LA LA land."
Clayton B.,"Oceanside, CA",138,297,63,4.0,3/9/2012,"The food wasn't too bad. I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory though. The avocado egg rolls are absolutely amazing. My friend got them and I tried them. I just can't believe I never had them up until that point haha. The only unfortunate thing is are the prices. They do feel a little spendy sometimes depending on what you get. Most of the dishes I've had are really flavorful though and I'd definitely recommend coming here. It does get a little crowded though on the weekends, so just a heads up."
Ew Y.,"Fullerton, CA",1,6,2,1.0,6/7/2015,"Cutting to the chase, went for a BIRTHDAY dinner celebrating two birthdays. Checked in at 5:30 and was told there was a two hr wait. So we waited on behalf of the birthday dinners. We ended up waiting at the bar spending an easy 400$+ total with our party of twenty. Two hrs passed .. still no acknowledgment of being aware of our party still waiting. Also other big sized parties that came after us, got seated first.  Another hr passed, and finally got seated after having to remind them we were still there waiting.. The service manager and restaurant manager showed very poor hosting skills. And did not show any empathy or try to recognize appreciation for choosing ""the cheesecake factory"" for our choice of  birthday celebrations.. so now feeling very unwelcomed and under apreciated the manager put the icing on the cake and said, ""if I were you guys I wouldn't have waited this long""..... were they not going to serve us?? and hoped for us to leave, if they kept us waiting??? If we wanted poor service we would have gone to dicks  ..."
Jose L.,"Anaheim, CA",23,11,3,5.0,10/28/2012,"I would not listen to the bad reviews, everything I have tried here has been amazing. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the carrot cake, it was so amazing I went home and learned how to make carrot cake to share with my friends and family. I had this on my 21st birthday and the waitress was very nice bringing me free carrot cake and a drink to celebrate. I've tried a lot of items and were all very good, I would order different things everytime I went and tried my friends food as well. I personally enjoyed the chicken parm, louisiana chicken, salmon, jambalaya, and kobe burger the most. For apps I had onion rings that were so soft and  tasted like pancake batter to me but my friends like the onion rings here because they haven't seen anyone else make soft onion rings. The fried calamari , quesadilla, and crabcakes (had good portion) were all great. One thing that is a bit overwhelming is the thick menu because they have so many things to eat! The ambiance is nice not too dark, but it can be rather loud inside."
Aly C.,"Cerritos, CA",49,22,2,5.0,9/5/2013,OMG!!!!!!!!!! Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake!!!!!!!!!!
Cat J.,"Union City, CA",0,12,,5.0,8/4/2015,"Went during a trip to Disneyland, food was incredible and the air was great outdoors since has a large party. Decided to get that one really tender meat, just forgetting the name. It was indeed tender, I'd give it a 9/10 because I felt the flavor lacked something, not sure what. The servers were police and helpful, it was a fun dining here."
Caitlin B.,"Sherwood Park, Canada",22,55,,5.0,1/12/2014,"My friend and I ate here while visiting Disneyland last week. We were sat right away, our waiter was great and very friendly.  I watched another waitress play peek a boo with another customer's toddler. The food is fantastic especially if you're a pasta person and you want leftovers. The portions are huge so the fact you do pay a bit doesn't bother me. I'm not usually a dessert person but even if I get it to go I can't leave without a slice of the key lime cheesecake!"
Noel B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/22/2016,"I'd like to begin with saying that the Cheesecake Factory is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to. This restaurant is utterly clean and it's absolutely gorgeous inside. It's very comforting and it makes me never want to leave the place. They've always greeted customers immediately after they walk in, from what I have observed and experienced. The workers here are extremely friendly, and sometimes I feel as if it's impossible to take a smile off their faces. I usually go on the weekends so it does get very busy, however every single time I've gone they've made my waiting time enjoyable. They do this by inviting you to sit by the bar, and throughout this time you have a waiter/waitress who takes care of you up until your table is ready. Once your table is ready and you've been seated, it doesn't take very long for a waiter/waitress to come over and begin offering drinks, appetizers, and helping with any questions you have. Also the waiter/waitress brings over such tasty bread. I wish I could take a slice home with me. The menu is everything you could ever imagine. There's so much to choose from, which is great because other restaurants I've been to your options are limited, or the dishes are all similar. Your food is out very shortly regardless of the amount of people they have. It's usually anywhere from 15-30 minutes and your waiter is checking up on you throughout this time. I would recommend getting the pasta carbonara"
Kristin W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/22/2016,"This place seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you walk through the doors, they always greet you immediately making you feel welcomed. Once they can narrow down the meal choices, the food is always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy.The service was great. When my boyfriend and I went there for a date, we actually ended up with 2 servers because our previous server was no longer working. But the other server was very nice and friendly. The prices are pretty decent. The bigger the plate size, the more pricey it gets. I believe that they food is good anyway so it's worth it. The negative thing about this is the place is that it's always packed (even on week nights) since it's next to Disneyland. The parking is a paid lot, but it's free with validation if you don't forget to bring your parking ticket. What I like the most is the cleanliness of this place. Everytime when I go use the restroom, there is always a clean bathroom and clean mirrors to look at when touching up your makeup or something. It is very crucial to have a clean bathroom because no one wants to go to a restaurant that is filthy."
G B.,"Cerritos, CA",11,85,77,3.0,3/19/2014,"Been to this location a few times and nothing was above and beyond. It's just people giving you food and collecting tips they don't really deserve. I always have to take a cheesecake to go if not finished at the table. I love their varieties, I have tried red velvet, dulce de leche, anniversary cake,   White chocolate, the ones with fruits and probably some other ones I just can't remember, I have to try the sugar free ones next time. Food comes out with no flavor sometimes! They need to season their food!"
Robyn C.,"Oak Brook, IL",183,382,243,3.0,2/18/2010,"We just landed at OC Airport, checked into the hotel and now just wanted to walk around and find something to do, so we opted for desserts at Cheesecake. Here's the kicker .. which I never knew .. Cali state law requires big chain restaurants with 20+ restaurants nationwide to give nutritional facts with the menu. So Red Velvet cheese cake eaters ... you are eating well over 1000 calories and 58 grams of SATURATED fat .. so can you imagine the total fat if saturated is 58?? YIKES  Our server was Chris, he was really nice and friendly even though we just got desserts. A lot nicer than the servers in Chicago.  Once you've eaten at one Cheesecake, you've eaten at them all .. .except in Cali you know how many calories you're eating .. :("
Jeany Y.,"Carson, CA",68,24,11,4.0,4/6/2014,"Thank you Cheesecake Factory Anaheim!! It was a blast celebrating our wedding dinner with you guys. Our servers were really nice they made us feel special. They asked us if we have a wedding cake and when they found out we don't they made us a cute dessert plate! It was a fun, simple, sweet dinner! It was just what made out day extra special! Thanks again Cheesecake Factory!"
Andrea B.,"San Mateo, CA",953,830,1271,4.0,2/13/2010,"Enough of eating at Disneyland....it was time to venture out. We walked into the Cheesecake Factory, no wait, we were seated immediately.  The hostess and wait staff were very friendly.  We ordered the appetizer sampler, its enough food for four people without ordering a meal, if you are still hungry, which would surprise me, order a piece of cheesecake. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is excellent, the service was great, and it was nice to get away from all the park food."
Bonnie S.,"Buena Park, CA",420,440,825,5.0,7/31/2009,"This review is basically for their new Cheesecake: Red Velvet Cake Cheese... OMG.. so freakin good that it hypnotized me in moans of yum, ahh and ohhh!  it was that good.  and the piece was huge.  I was just so happy that i tried this new cheesecake on National Cheesecake Day where the cheese cake was 1/2 off! Hmmz back to the actual restaurant.  It is like every typical cheesecake factory and the service was ok, i still like the irvine and newport locations better."
Stephanie S.,"Tustin, CA",152,146,118,4.0,9/1/2009,"I am not a HUGE fan of the Cheesecake Fact... only this location. Im not sure if its something about their cooks, or the awesome waitstaff? Anyway, to the point, FOOD!! Drinks of choice -Raspberry Martini - WOW. Not toooo sweet. It tastes like a melted popsicle and is PERFECT on a hot day!  -Same with the Strawberry Lemonade, but with an extra shot... It never seems strong enough for me. Appetizers: -Fried Mac n Cheese - fucking YUM. I could eat them all the time! -Ahi tartare - sooooo yummy! With little pieces of avocado and crisp wonton pieces to pick it all up - DEEEElish! Salads: HUGEEE!! The Caesar is all Ive ever had form there, and its disgusting. The dressing is WAYYY too lemony, and makes my eyes water. No thanks. Entrées! Miso Salmon - My personal FAVORITE!!!!!! ATF! I always get it with mashed potatoes instead of rice. Fucking amazing, I could eat it daily. White bean chicken chili - A bit spicy, served in a big bowl with rice. I always get a side of sour cream to thicken it all up and cool the spice a little. Another favorite of mine :) Shepherds Pie - YUCK. Bleghhh.... Barf. No thank you. Maybe Im just used to my dads home made pie, but this one has NOOOO flavor. Even with a ton of salt and pepper, nothing works. Ewww. Louisiana Chicken Pasta - yummy! Nice and spiced! I always ask them to add corn, cause you know... corn makes anything better. lol Dessert... Funny thing is, I normally dont get dessert when I go. The cheesecake is good and all, but I enjoy the entrées Ive listed much better! Weird huh? There are more I could go on and on about... but Ive listed my most favorite, and my least. :) Hope it helps!!!"
