Shelby W.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,12,,5.0,6/17/2015,"Great service, one of the best waiters I've ever had. Food was great, cheesecake was great. I only had one complaint, the beer seemed to be lacking. I had a Blue Moon and then a Stella Artois, but they seemed to be lacking. Definitely wouldn't prevent me from visiting in the future."
Edgar F.,"Anaheim, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/20/2013,"My buddies and I decided to try this place out one night.  Service was nice and quick, not so long wait times (ordered the Americana Cheeseburger), was delicious! Friendly and fancy atmosphere, and had complimentary bread (i'm okay with this) and not very expensive.  Bathrooms were also clean."
Jack S.,"Portland, OR",0,30,1,5.0,11/12/2012,"This place is the absolute best !! Our servers (Plural) were VERY attentive, always smiling and eager to please :O) The entrees were to die for... ""The Pasta Carbonara with Chicken"", ""The Linguinine with Sun Dried Tomato"" and the ""Chicken Teriyaki"" were all top-notch !! Dessert is, of course, what they are famous for and with good reason. You just can't go wrong with their dessert menu at all ! If you ever visit Disneyland or go to Anahiem for any reason...EAT HERE !!! XXX"
Porky P.,"Anaheim, CA",10,8,,5.0,1/14/2013,"Interior : it's like eating in the Venetian in Vegas, very large vaulted ceilings with a Roman cathedral theme Service : it was very busy on a Sunday night but the server was really prompt, food came out fast, and she was very friendly Food : jambalaya pasta and calamari was tasty and healthy portions It was fast, tasty, and visually attractive... I don't need much more in life, I like!"
Gee T.,"Montreal, Canada",4,59,,2.0,6/26/2011,"I've eaten at about 20 Cheesecake Factories in about 10 States. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed. Granted, it has been about 6 months since I've eaten in one but if the menu has changed that drastically, I can't be the only one who has noticed.  Alcohol, great. Food, not so much. Things were cold, items missing, etc. Extremely busy location so that might have something to do with it, I don't know. We usually order a whole bunch of appetizers. Tex -Mex egg rolls - Big fluffy rolls of grease with pretty much nothing inside. Calamari - Greasy like french fries in a paper bag. Barf. Beef sliders - Cold. asked for bacon and cheese, forgotten. Chicken sliders - Right on the button. Yum yum. The server, Mara = unbelievably excellent. I once again apologize for he drunken boob that was with me."
Alexandra E.,"Napa, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/8/2014,"My friend and I took a trip down south to Disneyland from Northern California and on our third day we wanted to go somewhere outside of the park that was nice, but not too expensive. We decided we'd go to the cheesecake factory! We were sat down right away and our waitress was very quick to greet us and take our drink orders. I would not normally write someones name on yelp, but I'm hoping that maybe someone will read this and give this lady some recognition. Our waitresses name was Belinda and she was very kind and welcoming off the bat! She was very prompt checking on us and never let us go with an empty drink or basket of bread! She was very helpful with the menu and made sure all of our leftovers were boxed and ready to go when she picked up the check! The food was great as well, but it was really refreshing having such a great waitress. You don't get that a lot anymore."
Glen C.,"Lloydminster, Canada",0,8,,4.0,12/3/2014,"4 of us went for Dinner last night, and all 4 of us were very impressed! The decor, the service, and especially the food were all impressive! We were all trying each other's orders & all was great, but the standouts were the Miso Salmon & especially the Chicken Madeira! Easy to see why it's their best seller! The pricing is moderate, not economy, but the value for the dollar is very good. Hope to go back."
William C.,"Spokane, WA",2,27,,3.0,7/1/2014,"Visiting Disney. The place is busy. My son and I got our food and then we waited 7 minutes staring at our food waiting for my wife's turkey sandwich to come so we could eat together. My chicken enchilada was meh. The cheesecake, however, was extremely awesome. Eat elsewhere and get dessert here."
Christopher J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",174,591,420,4.0,6/17/2013,"Standard cheesecake factory, arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and we got seated within 5 minutes.  Service was on point.  Ordered a glass of red wine and tasted flat.  Outdoor patio is perfect for nice evening weather."
Ashley O.,"San Lorenzo, CA",3,7,7,3.0,9/17/2013,"Tonight my man and I decided to splurge and go out to a nicer dinner place for our date night (plus we had a gift card) so we decided on this place. We sat at the bar seating and were greeted promptly. Our server was great, she was very attentive and everything we ordered came out really fast. The food unfortunately is where this review goes downhill. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. The breading was almost gummy and there were pieces that stuck together to make giant greasy calamari clumps. My boyfriend for the shrimp and chicken gumbo which came with absolutely zero shrimp. Other than that, he said it tasted fine, but still when you expect shrimp , it's kind of disappointing. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. While the menu didn't specify, I expected a chicken breast with my pasta. I was dismayed to find cut chicken pieces that had random bones and cartilage in them plus extremely fatty skin. The garlic sauce was also kind of bland and  thin so the pasta itself didn't have much flavor to it. Despite our disappointing meals, we of course had to order cheesecake (never gone wrong there). We chose the original strawberry and there was the one food item that we both thoroughly enjoyed. Maybe we just happened to choose less than great entrees, maybe it was the location, but this was not a great visit to the Cheesecake Factory."
Night P.,"Long Beach, CA",56,43,,5.0,3/29/2015,"5 Stars for the cheesecake! That is all, you may resume your normal activity, thank you."
Claudia E.,"Cerritos, CA",89,3,1,5.0,4/25/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory!!! They have amazing food and if you are looking for some comfort food here go with the chicken di pana. The place can get slow when it is really busy like weekends and evenings but what place doesn't?
Lucia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,21,62,4.0,11/2/2013,My husband and I came here for dinner on a Sat. Night ....   Lucky we found a spot near the bar .. Not a good a idea .. I didn't like people hovering over me trying to order a drink while i ate :/  we should have waited for a table .. But it was a 30min. Wait :/
Sarah K.,"Kentwood, MI",37,62,,4.0,10/11/2013,The food was delicious and the outdoor seating was nice. Our waiter was just too bizarre for words. He was beyond expressive and even brought a free bowl of soup to us saying he didn't care about offering the free side. He wasn't around much but when he was we were uncomfortable. He really needed to calm down a bit.
Jaime O.,"Milpitas, CA",94,715,2,5.0,2/8/2014,I love the the white bean chicken chili.  You can't go wrong with this menu.
Giancarla C.,"Anaheim, CA",180,343,317,4.0,1/5/2012,"Be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait. Didja know that Cheesecake Factory (in general, not just this location) was in a book about the best places to meet people? True story, and it's due to the fact that it can take SUCH a long time to get seated and tuck in. This branch is no exception and probably is the busiest restaurant in the Gardenwalk. My new favorites here are the corn fritters for an appetizer and the Jamaican Pepper Chicken with rice. Super delicious and yummy! As usual, their menu is gynormous and it can be so hard to pick. Honestly, I've tried many different entrees here and I can't say I remember ever being disappointed. Yes, they're not cheap eats but they do give you very sizable portions which could necessitate a doggy bag.  Don't forget to get your pass validated! They've recently tightened up parking here and they USED to be free if validated but now I think it's only free up to a certain amount of time but don't quote me on that."
Alison M.,"Brea, CA",6,7,,5.0,5/17/2014,"Let me start out by saying that the first two times I ate at CCF were not pleasant.  BUT...that's because I was having personal problems at the time.  After I got some therapy and started feeling better about my life I returned to CCF.  The last three times have been excellent.  Great food, great staff, I have no complaints!  :-D"
Linda K.,"Trabuco, CA",34,7,11,1.0,5/5/2013,"Been waiting for my food for like 40 minutes after waiting to order AFTER what seemed like was a little too long... [MAJOR FROWN] Yes... I'm at cheesecake factory... a chain restaurant... i do not have crazy expectations as far as how the food tastes. I just expect faster service since, you know, there are multiple locations and all of them seem to get it right and fast with no problems????!!!??? What the heck cheesecake factory... is it because you're next to Disneyland and you know you're just gonna get people that walk in cuz they walked around all day at the theme park??!!!?!?!?!?!?? Ok. Lets say this was a first time experience... NOT.  Last time I came here for just dessert and we waited n waited too...  Went in thinking I could get a pretty good meal quick... (even sat at the bar area to eat sooner because we were starved) One star for the awesome selection of music.  No stars for slow service and only a teeny glimmer of hope in attentiveness (is that a word?) After we were obviously hungry and pissed... Be forewarned yelpers... stay away from this one.."
Carrie C.,"San Francisco, CA",402,224,132,4.0,1/23/2012,"I never really find it necessary to review Cheesecake Factories because the food is pretty much all the same.  However, I wanted to write this review just to mention that the service here for me was fantastic.  Our server was so fast, very attentive, and went all out to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cheesecake slice.  It was PACKED on a rainy night from people evacuating Disneyland, but they were still able to seat us 10 minutes before our expected time. Also, the Hershey's cheesecake is phenomenal! Overall, we had a great experience here and it made my boyfriend's birthday special even though our Disneyland day got rained out!"
Kel M.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,18,8,4.0,3/21/2014,Another Cheesecake Factory!  Food taste good!  But the wait can be crazy.  We waited for 2 hours to be seated (understandable because it was packed with people).  The waitress is very nice.  Food is amazing!  -1 stars due to the super loud atmosphere
