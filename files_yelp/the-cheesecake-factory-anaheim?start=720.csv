Aabha S.,"Corona, CA",6,4,,1.0,6/14/2015,I had a horrible experience today. The food was not made right and the manager stated he would not charge me. When the bill came they still charged me and the waitress said I ate more than half my food which I didn't and the manager also took my food away after my complaint.
Manny P.,"Burnaby, Canada",1,7,,5.0,11/12/2012,Pros Wonderful Menu with good variety 15min walk from Disneyland & close to most Disneyland hotels Service is first rate - server had the chef make a non menu item for a patron who has a vegan diet Very reasonable $$$ for the food & service quality Portions sizes are just right size Very nice ambience and decor Great for families & kids Cons Can get loud in dinning hall
Shirley M.,"Santa Clara, CA",639,296,861,3.0,7/5/2011,"Service was great here, people were friendly, extremely happening place had to wait 45 min to eat & celebrate 2 birthdays here. Only downfall was the greek vegetarian salad has chunks of beef in it, we notified the manager immediately and he was very apologetic and gave dessert on the house. My sister in law was horrified and will never eat here again."
Tien L.,"Stanton, CA",282,341,38,4.0,9/25/2011,"Its cheesecake factory. I was really drunk. but it was really good. The Elite Event released the yelpers like caged animals onto the oc autoshow and some o us decided to go eat.  Boy. did i eat. Pizza, Avocado Eggrolls, Chicken Bellagio, cheesecake, bread. There went my diet."
Mike B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",14,158,5,4.0,10/5/2011,"The wife and I went here for a late night dinner and had an enjoyable experience.  Food portions were enormous (which I love) and service was very polite and respectful.  I think part of it has to do with the location and stiff competition nearby.  In any event, it's a solid (albeit pricey) choice."

Melissa J.,"Cerritos, CA",244,566,263,3.0,1/3/2012,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered: Mushroom Lettuce Wraps - Great ginger flavor.  Visually appears oily and that is exactly what it is.  Leaves a horrible oil-coating feeling on your palette...  Wild Mushroom Flatbread - The flavors on this were just ok.  Nothing I would care offering anyone to try.   Garlic Noodles - A little plain in my opinion.  There is a garlic flavor, but if the name of the dish is GARLIC NOODLES, I would expect more of a garlic kick.  If you are looking for a non-heavy pasta, this would be a good choice. Side Caesar - I love my caesar salads, but this one didn't really make the cut.  A little bland and not much of that caesar dressing kick. Tuxedo Cheesecake - Definitely my favorite flavor I have tried amongst all the other flavors. OVERALL - Was never impressed by this place even from the first time I have ever tried it.  Sure there menu is huge, but even from the many entrees I tried I still haven't found one that makes me want to come back."
Charlotte K.,"Anaheim, CA",19,18,3,2.0,5/3/2012,"Last December I went to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco so I already knew some cheap gluten free options for myself. The hard part is finding something cheap. Most dishes are average $15 or so but the menu is HUGE so there are options. To drink I got the hot caramel apple cider, which I first had that cold December night. This time is was a cold February night and my roommates and I had just been on Space Mountain 2 times so we were cold. Plus it tastes like apple pie in a cup. For dinner I was feeling a burger so I got the original (also the cheapest at $10) and I got that with no bun and wrapped in lettuce (protein style). It was good but the lettuce to patty ratio was ridiculous. It was pretty much just a whole head of lettuce that someone put a hamburger patty inside. There was WAY too much lettuce. And the fries were good, but just like the fries at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco, there was too much salt on them. The service was pretty fast though, but it was pretty late in the evening, around 10 PM. But the food was just 'eh'. The drink however was amazing, as always. -Charlotte "
Becky L.,"Orange, CA",0,9,,5.0,10/27/2014,Come here all the time  we get great customer service everytime. The bartenders are great!  And if something isn't right they will make it right
Amanda S.,"Menlo Park, CA",42,71,4,1.0,1/20/2014,"I am normally a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but last night has changed my opinion. The first issue was that our food was taking a long time, and the manager had to come out and apologize for our order taking so long to get to the table. We appreciated that, and everything seemed find until my boyfriend found a huge chunk of wax paper in his burger. While I understand this isn't actually harmful, it was very unappetizing and really just made the rest of his meal unappealing. We alerted the manager (making that his second visit of the evening), and while he apologized profusely, we still were charged full price for a meal my boyfriend couldn't even finish.  I found this pretty shocking, and I can't foresee returning to a Cheesecake Factory in the near future, if ever."
Rudy R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,23,4,5.0,10/30/2014,"came in today around 4pm was seated right away, we ordered thai chicken lettuce wraps, artichoke, pear and feta flatbread and the crab cakes, they were absolutely delicious, i dont remember what the name of our server was but she was blonde and we were seated by the kitchen, she was friendly and personable, over all it was a great experience and great atmosphere with yummy food!"
Gabby V.,"Artesia Pilar, CA",2,12,3,4.0,4/27/2014,I would give it 5 stars but the wait was ridiculous almost 2 hours.  Once we were seated our server whose name I believe was Cameron was awesome ! He was attentive and his personality gave off a good vibe.  He made us feel welcomed.  I would definitely come back and ask for him
Michelle K.,"Westminster, CA",20,41,52,5.0,6/17/2011,"I have eaten here 3 times so far and I love the service. Everyone is super nice, and professional. I get my things on time and they are very attentive too. I gotta say, Felix the server was awesome. He seems a bit shy, but i bet outside of work, he's a real comedian. Other than that, everytime I've been, has been a great experience. My glass was never low, and always refilled. I was served with a smile everytime.  Honestly, I didn't like eating at any Cheesecake Factory until I walked into this one and took my Mom and Grandma out for dinner. My family totally enjoyed everything. The salad we got, Cobb Salad was delcious and so was the Bellagio too. Portions are huge too! It's a great way to share these dishes almost family style for 4 girls (not boys) lol"
Melody P.,"Cameron Park, CA",33,340,13,4.0,5/10/2011,"Bartenders were awesome!  Felt like our watering hole back home.  The bar was roomy enough to eat dinner, so our food arrived much faster.  At least faster than those seated at the tables behind us! I ordered the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.  It was a huge portion.  Let me roll back to my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory.  It was yucky.  I don't recall what I ordered, but it was not good at all.  The food was not worth the money.  However, THIS visit was certainly well worth it!  So good, in fact, that we ended up there the next day.  At the bar again.  Same bartenders.  The guy remembered our drinks exactly, right down to the glass. I will return again, but maybe only to this specific location.  There's one a short distance away, but that's where we had the crappy stuff."
Alfonso V.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",1,14,1,5.0,3/26/2014,"Cheesecake Factory food is always good! However, today the service provided by our waiter Corey was extraordinary. His witty sense of humor brought smiles and laughter on an otherwise gloomy day. Highly recommend the Chicken Piccata, Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, and for appetizers you can't go wrong with the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Calamari.  The multiple varieties of cheesecake go without saying. My personal favorite is the Tiramisu Cheesecake.  Parking is validated and on the house."
sean s.,"Long Beach, CA",717,25,10,1.0,8/13/2013,"First off I want to start out by saying that I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory restaurants, they've always been consistent and for the most part provided us with good service. but not at this location, it seems that everyone either hates their job or the clients,?? and being so close to Disney they should be a little more jolly. As far as my experience started out  with the most unfriendly greeting from the host,?? we requested to be seated by the bar and after we were seated we ordered two beers on draft which were not cold at all and I hate to send a drink back which I've never done before, but in this case I believe it was necessary and the waitress which looked stressed out was irritated?? Well at this point both me and my other half were a bit annoyed, this is the second time we've come to this location and were disappointed both times. as we were about to leave, the table next to us which was full of employees that looked like they had just finished there shifts were so LOUD to the point of SHOUTING! that my ears were ringing I left with a headache!!!  Well needless to say I won't be back here ever and if anyone can avoid this location I would strongly suggest that. there's one in Huntington Beach if you want to have a good dining experience that I recommend going to."
Priscilla C.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,69,4,4.0,8/23/2011,"Nice workers, great tasting/quality food, clean, and unlimited yummy bread! I came here during the Lunch Special time, so I got a huge pizza & salad for like $13-14 dollars? Yay!"
Jane D.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,152,85,5.0,1/24/2014,"You can never go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory, so I was brought here to celebrate my birthday. I ordered a Long Island, and loved it! They are not stingy with portion, it was a generously-sized cup, and the drink was as strong as I wanted it! I ordered something different this time-- fish tacos, they were delicious! My date told them it was my birthday, so they sang happy birthday and gave me a sample of their cheesecake. It was delicious! I wish I remembered the waitress's name, she was super nice."
Caryn N.,"Pearl City, HI",100,262,169,4.0,10/7/2011,"HC and I decided to eat here on our last day in Anaheim before returning home.  We've gone to the one in Waikiki several times, so I was expecting it to look the same.  However, I was surprised to see how beautiful the inside looked with its high ceilings and bright, open area.  We were seated and served quickly.   We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and split them.  HC wanted his crab wontons, so we got an order of that, and an order of stuffed mushrooms and crab and artichoke dip.  The stuffed mushrooms were really small, but very tasty.  The dip was good as well, but there wasn't enough bread to eat it with.  I ended up eating it plain without the bread.   Would go again if we were in the area."
Vanna C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",76,65,2,2.0,4/25/2013,"My coworkers and I decided to order lunch today and I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. We decided on our orders and my coworker placed the first call stating she wanted the lunch portion of Evelyn's favorite pasta. The less than enthusiastic employee on the phone told her that there was no such dish on their menu. Since this was another coworker's order, she said she would call back with a different order. We were all a bit confused by this because it clearly states the item in the Pasta section of the menu. My coworker decides on a different dish and we call again. This time she tells the guy taking the order that she wanted the lunch herb crusted salmon. He then tells her that they don't have a herb crusted salmon, that they only have a cedar plank salmon. Really?! Ok, she says she will have to call back with a different order. We were a bit baffled. Were we looking at the wrong menu? We did click on the Anaheim location. This time around, I decided to call and make the order. I waited about 30 seconds for the take-out employee to take my order. I started off with asking for the BBQ Rancho Chicken Salad - surely they had that on their menu, right? Yes, yes they did! Hooray. One down, two to go. Next, I asked for Evelyn's favorite pasta. YAY, they DO have it! Lastly, Herb Crusted Salmon. Fingers crossed... Confirmed!  After the order was complete, she repeated back everything to me and offered the complimentary bread. Since it was the lunch time rush, she said it would take about 25-30 minutes. No big deal.  We went to get the food and everything went pretty smooth there and then brought everything back to the office. The BBQ Rancho Chicken salad looked delicious... except for the fact that there was no BBQ or Ranch. We were disappointed for sure. We have all been to various Cheesecakes and maybe the empoyees were new but to not know the menu and pack everything properly was a huge shame."
