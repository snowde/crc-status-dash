Jennifer D.,"San Diego, CA",211,13,43,4.0,12/7/2010,"People often scoff and laugh when I tell them Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but I seriously love the food here. If you're going for lunch, definitely get the lunch special portion. The portions are pretty big and I usually have a decent amount leftover. Things I recommend (I like really flavorful and spicy foods): 1. Louisiana Chicken Pasta (it usually comes with bow-tie pasta but you can order whatever pasta your little heart desires! same with all the other pasta dishes) 2. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (I usually order it w/o peas) 3. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta 4. Chicken Madeira (apparently it's their most popular chicken dish and it's served with mashed taters but you can switch it out for rice if you're asian like me :)) 5. Spicy Cashew Chicken (so good and flavorful! I usually order it without the cashews 'cause I get this mostly for the sauce but if you're too embarrassed to order a cashew dish without cashews, you can always order the cashews on the side ;) - this was a tip that the waiter gave me for cases when there are other people in your party that want to eat the cashews lol) 6. Miso Salmon 7. Peach Bellini 8. Tiramisu Cheesecake (the Red Velvet Cheesecake is really good but it's really rich so for those who prefer something on the lighter side and it's not too sweet either!)"
Alyssa S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/3/2014,Yummmmmm my favorite restaurant by far! The food is always so delicious and restaurant is decorated so nicely. Staff so welcoming and my server was awesome! If you haven't been here you are missin out
Terrance Y.,"Alhambra, CA",578,456,2530,5.0,8/17/2011,Allowed us to have individual checks (party of 16). The ultimate margarita was delicious. =D
Chris C.,"Orange, CA",52,21,13,5.0,2/23/2014,I ordered takeout and when I got back to my room I realize my order was wrong (my fault for not checking) they did everything right and taking care of me and I appreciate the hospitality of the manager.  Will definitely return food was great.
Jackie L.,"Anaheim, CA",231,203,226,4.0,2/3/2013,"Make sure you make reservations ! The weekends always gets super busy, usually a 40 minute wait. My friends and I had a party of 20, and we were seated outside. Our waiter was Scott, he was very friendly & helpful with all the menu items. The service was a bit slow though. It took a while for the food to come out, but we didn't mind as much. I ordered the Jambalaya pasta and it was okay. There wasn't that much flavor to it, and it wasn't even spicy. The chicken & shrimp however was very tender,moist, and flavorful though. Overall, I would come back to this Cheesecake Factory. & a big thanks to Scott for doing a great job serving us !"
Ben R.,"Irvine, CA",216,173,393,4.0,9/22/2013,"Well, What can I say. You cant go wrong with such a big franchise like Cheesecake Factory. The Staffs were really nice. I always get Miso Salmon and Tropical smoothie when I come here. I also recommend Crab Bites and Ahi Tuna Carpaccio!!!! The Food is great. The service is Great. Loved it."
ShellyJane B.,"Orange County, CA",126,159,100,4.0,10/20/2011,Love it here.. down the street from our house .. it always gets packed even on weekdays. they have the best fried macaroni and cheese. i dont know any other place that has this! YUM! and also i love the chicken bellagio :) the green apple martini and the lemon drop is sooo delish! there is a wide selection on the menu so order carefully :)
Gabby G.,"Hayward, CA",1,40,7,4.0,1/14/2014,"The wait started out odd because our buzzer went off and we waited in a separate area to be taken to our booth. In the process 4 other people's buzzers went off after ours and they were all seated before us. It took my husband having to say something for us to get seated and our ticket wasn't even printed out. Who knows how long we could have been waiting for! They were busy that night, and luckily we only waited about 15 minutes, when we were originally told a half hour.  Our waitress Angela was awesome! I'm pretty sure that's her name. Short, around 5'2-5'4 blonde girl. Haven't had good customer service in a while and she was on point. We didn't even have to leave our almost empty drink glasses on the edge of the table for her to get the hint to refill them. They were by the wall and she came by and said she'd grab us a refill. Our food came out t proper temperatures and came out pretty fast for as busy as they were. This place was just a 2 minute walk away from our motel so it was perfect! I would come back just to have her as my waitress again!"
Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/11/2009,"While all my experiences here have been 5 star - its hard to give 5 stars to a chain restaurant thats next door to McCormick and Schmick's and Roy's Hawaiin Fusion. I will have to keep on visiting and see if it really deserves another star.  I really enjoy the Anaheim gardenwalk. I believe that in this current economy they are probably struggling a great deal. I have seen some Yelpers complaining about how dead Anaheim Gardenwalk is - but is it busy anywhere right now? That being said - Parking is convenient. You get validated for the first 2 hours automatically and then you get another hour from being validated by a the restaurant. Let is be known that you cannot double validate. If your their for longer than 3 hours you pay no matter how many times your card has been validated.  Onto the Factory. I love the appetizers here. BJ's brew house could learn a lot from reading the menu and trying out the appy's here. I have eaten lunch at this location 4-5 times and dinner 4-5 times. But, mostly I come for the appetizers and some occasional cheesecake.  As for drinks - they have a pineapple mojito that is amazing. Its both minty and fruity and refreshing.  They make a creamy and very drinkable pinacolada as well. They blend their blended drinks very well. This is a big issue for me - I hate big chunks of ice in my blended drink.  They have a decent if generic list of wine.  As for starters and appetizers; they have a variety of lovely items. They have also recently added some more small plate items and appetizers. This is key in our current economy as many people still want to go out but don't want to get a 5 course meal.  The calamari here is delicious. Its lightly breaded but a bit greasy. In fact everything I have had fried here is a little greasy. They need to work on fryer temperature management. That being said - the calamari is good and the sauce with it is also quite nice. The corn fritters which are a new item(see picture I uploaded) are very nice. They serve it with a creamy sauce. Where I come from you eat corn fritters with maple syrup but I assume that would be very expensive on a wide scale. Anyway - corn fritters are super tasty and great with a pale beer.  The Tomato and fresh mozzarella salad is amazing. It has a light vinagrette on it. Its served with some greens. Its very tasty as a small plate. I have not had the large version of it. You can see a pic of it that I uploaded. As for the high light and favorite of my trips to the Factory - the Spicy Tuna Roll Tempura. Its a deep fried version of the spicy sushi tuna roll. It has wasabi in it. Its served with a bit of ginger and some soy. I could use a little more wasabi on the side. But, in general it makes my day every time I have it.  As for Entrees the Wasabi Encrusted Ahi tastes both flavorful and fresh. The spices seem to hit just right. I don't recommend the salmon here as it appears to be farmed Atlantic salmon with color added. Eating farmed salmon sends the wrong message to industry and supports bad practices and diseased fish.  They have a variety of pasta dishes that are quite good. One of the best is called ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"". The Farfalle with roasted garlic is very good too. It typically comes with chicken but I typically get it with shrimp. Its amazing.  The Barbecue ranch salad is very tasty. Also the tuna tataki salad is very nice.  As for desserts the chocolate cheesecake, the tirimisue cheesecake, the chocolate cake, the tiramisue and the key lime cheesecake are all delicate, decadent, and silky. They are all a bit too sweet but quite good with coffee.  This location is also open pretty late and that's nice when you get out of a movie or a ball game and want to get a bite to eat.  The drinks are a bit pricey and the cheesecake is too expensive. But all in all I have generally had very good experiences here.  I recommend that you go and try the appetizers and have some cheesecake. The Entrees are better at McCormick's or Roy's."
Andrew K.,"Anaheim, CA",136,99,37,4.0,5/29/2013,This place is Super Packed...even on a Monday night. Is the economy still bad? HaHaHa...very clean and friendly staff. Always enjoy coming here.
Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,4.0,5/30/2011,"In general, I don't think that highly of these places.... average food, crowded and hard to get in, mediocre service....    This place still had the crowds, slightly overpriced food and quality... but the service was decent.  Overall it was a better than average experience, so I'm willing to give it 4..."
Ashley H.,"Fullerton, CA",1014,682,1235,3.0,12/27/2010,"i came here with my boyfriend on christmas eve at about 9 pm. the wait was about 30 minutes, but i found a table at the bar so we were seated within 5 minutes :] our server janette was awesome. i ordered the tomato basil pasta (my favorite thing on the menu :]) and my boyfriend ordered the pasta with meat sauce. i also go the JW pink lemonade...AMAZING. the tomato basil pasta is a simple tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella and chicken: so simple yet so flavorful! HIGHLY recommended to people who love a great pasta. my boyfriend said his was alright, but when i took a bite of his meat sauce the meat was way over cooked it was so tough bleh no my favorite. the drink was great janette recommended it and it was sweet and strong.  so why 3 stars? great service, great food, great drinks, and a great atmosphere...well i ordered the ahi tuna tartar as an appetizer...and it came a couple minutes after my meal...uhmm the point of an appetizer is to have it before the main course. i told her i didn't want it and she understood, also the parking...THE PARKING IS HORRIBLE trust me yelp it. yes the garden walk parking structure has it's own review...it's horrible the first hour is free and after you only get 1 hour with validation so if the wait is an hour you better hurry up and order and eat or else you will pay $3 for each additional hour you're at the garden walk."
Michael M.,"Waltham, MA",22,45,,5.0,3/2/2015,"Nice outdoor seating, great service, good food as always."
Miranda L.,"Brookings, OR",5,94,29,5.0,11/11/2013,"This was our first time at a Cheesecake Factory. We live in a rural area and have not been around one previously, so we were excited to try it after a long, fun filled day at Disneyland. WOW, it was huge! Such a large restaurant and staff buzzing around all over. Really dim, but I liked the relaxing ambiance. Our waitress was nice and handed out the menu's. It looked like a book! I could not even tell you how many pages of items there were! I was totally overwhelmed but thankfully when the waitress got our drink order I asked her for recommendation and instead of saying, ""Oh, everything is good"" she really narrowed it down. She gave me some of her favorites as well as a popular choices of customers. It truly helped since I had no idea what to get!  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and was not disappointed! I don't remember what my husband ordered but he loved it as did the kids. The portions wee huge! We all needed a to go bag, but could not leave without ordering a piece of cheesecake! They had s new one, I believe it was Oreo. We took a few bites the next day and it was so good! We had a great time, and we really enjoyed our meals, drinks, the bread, everything! Great wait staff, atmosphere and food! Can't wait to go back!"
Vanessa C.,"San Diego, CA",70,124,189,4.0,5/19/2011,"For the service, my husband and I were very pleased.  Everything came out together and HOT, the drinks were always filled so therefore we made sure to give a great tip.      What more can you say about Cheesecake?  If you know the food thenyou know how much the calories are!  I think most people might know the menu is HUGE!  It's amazing how they must cope back there in the line with all the different menu items they have to cook up!  The food was seasoned perfect and service was great.  We were in and out of the parking garage before we had to pay, our server suggested we wait until our dinner was done so they could validate our ticket to make sure parking was free :)"
Bell C.,"Orange, CA",0,8,1,2.0,2/1/2015,Went to cheese cake factory tonight had a good dinner. The one thing that was off was the plastic cracked water cup's. I really don't understand. I felt like I was at a backyard BBQ. Hopefully they get some glass.
Lee W.,"Cold Lake, Canada",3,17,2,5.0,3/30/2014,"My wife and I arrived in Anaheim late and we were looking for a place to have a late night snack. We decided to check out the CF because we had one back home in Canada and had great memories of that establishment. Needless to say we weren't disappointed. Upon arriving we were greeted warmly and seated right away. Our server Lou did an excellent job of attending to our needs and provided some great recommendations for appetizers. I had the Cuban rolls and they were delicious. Sadly, it didn't pair well with the beer I was drinking. My wife had the beet, arugula and goat cheese salad with the Angry Orchard cider. (I should have ordered this to drink instead). Portion sizes were good and we still had enough room for dessert. We ended up choosing the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Cheesecake to share. While delicious, we both found it quite sweet. We also found the prices reasonable. All in all a great dining experience. Highlights: - great greeters and wait staff were knowledgeable - food delivery was prompt and efficient - nice decor Suggestions: - wait staff be educated on what foods might pair nicely with which drinks"
Cindy L.,"Garden Grove, CA",385,186,935,4.0,8/16/2011,The avocado egg rolls here are the best! I think they're better than CPK's! You must try them! Every entree I've tried here is pretty good. I really love their pastas :) The guacamole and chips could have some more flavoring in them. The ambiance is lovely! Most of the Cheesecake Factories are similar so it's nice! Good for large groups and I think the service at most Cheesecake Factories are excellent!  Their cheesecakes are bomb! Try as many flavors as you can! Their whole cakes make a great birthday gift and more :)
Bambi W.,"Chino Hills, CA",15,6,6,5.0,12/15/2013,"Went there last night with my family and the food was amazing we all tried a little of everyone's dish and it was so delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Pacatta and for dessert I had the white chocolate raspberry cheese cake which is my favorite. Everyone else ordered Garlic Noodles-yummy, the steak Diane- out of this world, the spicy cashew Chicken- very good and the Kale salad was awesome.  Our gorgeous friendly server Ahmed M, was very helpful, attentive, and just plain awesome especially with our group things can get interesting and difficult.  Thank you for a great experience."
Maricel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,446,1323,5.0,6/12/2011,the best cheesecake! ...oreo..and original!
