Melanie S.,"Lawndale, CA",546,192,100,1.0,8/28/2010,"All I can say is WHACK!   Let me start off with the service.  So i'm here for a birthday party with a large party.  The servers come out with the hot food holding it with a cloth napkin in order to protect there hands.  No biggie here.  The stupid waitress then hands us our food across the table rather than going the extra effort in walking around the table and place the food on the table.  The plate almost burned the birthday girl's hands it was so hot and she had to basically drop it onto the table.  WTF!  She couldn't even warn us it was hot.  Thats just a dumb waitress with no common sense.  If I were the management, I'd teach your waitresses what it means to hold a hot plate of food before you let them serve your customers.  It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   Now, let's get to the food.  I shared a plate of the Chicken Bellagio.  I was told by another person in the party that this was really good.  Well, it wasn't this time.  The chicken was fine and the actual sauce was ok.  The pasta was completely overly salted.  It was disgusting and in the end inedible.  The plate was practically untouched and yet the waitress didn't even come to ask why.  I've never had pasta this bad.  Really, how can you make a bad plate of pasta?  Obviously the chefs here don't taste their food.  If you're at garden walk just pass them by and head to roy's.  The cheesecake doesn't cancel out the horrible service and pretty gross food they serve.  Completely a waste of time."
Samuel K.,"Garden Grove, CA",823,572,346,5.0,6/23/2011,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in over a year so decided to come here for dinner last night. We got here at prime dinner time (6:30pm) so we thought there would a typical long ass wait. But to our suprise, we were seated right away(my wife and I).  Our server Sarah Mae was amazing! She was kept checking on us regularly even though the place was crowded. We started off with the ""Avocado egg rolls."" This and the cheesecake at the end were the highlight dishes of the night! The harmony of the creamy avocado with the crispy edges along with the sweet sauce was absolutely delicious. You shouldn't gobble this down. Savor each bite slowly  to thoroughly enjoy all the synergestic flavors. I ordered the ""Chicken Madiera"" as the entree. It's another synergestic dish of grilled chicken topped with cheese, asparagus, mushrooms and a sweet sauce thats full of flavor. It comes with a huge mound of mashed potatoes. My wifey ordered the angel hair pasta marinara. It was light and fresh. For dessert, we somehow shared and finished a piece of ""White chocolate rasberry swirl cheesecake. just like the avocado rolls, you have to take slow bites and savor the amazing texture and flavors of the cheesecake. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner tonight because there was no ridiculous waiting period and the service and food were impeccable. It was a little pricey but totally worth it."
Cristina B.,"Redwood City, CA",255,714,89,4.0,3/29/2011,"This location was right across the street from our hotel, so definitely can't beat the convenience! We had the best server I've ever had at a Cheesecake factory. Jesus was attentive and efficient despite a pretty busy night. Our food was tasty, our drinks were kept refilled, and that was the goal of the evening! Thanks Jesus!!"
Kellee N.,"Cypress, CA",114,393,227,4.0,11/17/2010,"I like this location a lot better than the one in Huntington Beach (in the Bella Terra). For some reason the service is a lot better, or maybe it's just my luck... the waiters/waitresses seem nicer and the food quality seems a lot fresher. I've been to both about the same amount of time and this one always comes out on top. For appetizers, depending on who I'm with, we get the stuffed mushrooms, lettuce wraps, mozzarella sticks, or crabcakes which are all made to perfection. I'm a fan of the burgers here because they're HUGE and the fries are crispy and flavorful. I don't usually stray away from those but when I do I get any of the kinds of tacos they have, which are pretty good. Love the Cheesecake Factory, it's just slightly pricey for a broke college kid."
George B.,"Downey, CA",21,57,4,4.0,8/12/2013,"Came last week with my gf..  Usually service is quick. This time it took them around 10 just to ask us if we want to drink something.  Who cares though if you having a good time! Food is great, although last time my chicken bellagio tasted a bit blunt, portions huge, great environment..  Will be coming back for sure!"
Robin R.,"Tustin, CA",170,3,4,5.0,12/24/2013,Came in for a quick dinner and loved it! Ivan was my server and he was great! I eat out a lot and have had a lot of experience with difficult servers but he was by far the best have yet experienced. This cheesecake was overall great :)
Gian and Sheryl G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,4,4.0,12/23/2013,"So good! I had the Chicken Bellagio per the waitress' recommendation, I was not disappointed, it was delicious!!! And don't forget to get the Red Velvet cheesecake for dessert."
Jackie K.,"Orange County, CA",67,224,222,4.0,6/24/2011,"This review is solely based on their HAPPY HOUR which is from 3-6 pm. I came here with 2 other friends and we split 4 appetizers ($5 each), which came out to be more than enough food. We had the Roadside Sliders, Avocado Eggrolls (yuuuummm), Mac n Cheese, and a plate of their calamari. The avocado eggrolls were delicious! You get 6 pieces and it's not too fried.. and you get plenty of avocado inside. It also comes with a sweet dipping sauce that was savory as well. The sliders are average (4 very small hamburgers) that are served with pickles and lettuce.  The mac n cheese here totally surprised me! The mac n cheese came out in little rolled up balls that looked like HUGE meatballs. I took one ""meatball"" and opened it up and all this cheese and hot steam was coming out. It was a mac n cheese experience that I never had before..and it was awesome. The baked part on the outside was delicious. Huge plate of calamari that comes with marinara and ranch dipping sauce also pleased my taste buds. It was a pretty good deal for $5 I didn't order any drinks during the happy hour, but I believe drinks are $5 as well (mojito, margarita, etc)  I am not sure if other locations have happy hour, so definitely check it out before you go! This cheesecake factory location is also right by the Anaheim Gardenwalk which is a nice shopping plaza to walk around. You can park in the public parking structure thats located near the McCormicks and Schmicks (sp? it's another restaurant that's right on the street of Katella)and get your parking ticket validated before you leave the restaurant. Happy eating!"
Lish H.,"Chino Hills, CA",134,352,2033,2.0,10/28/2010,"I didn't have a good relationship with C. I was the one who initiate the break up and it was about 8 yrs. ago. I thought C would have change after all these years and gave another try, but still quite dissapointing and no WOW factor. The only WOW factor is how long the waiting line is, that's all. Goodbye, C!!!"
Ashley A.,"San Bernardino County, CA",694,255,47,5.0,1/6/2013,"pros: everything here is good! cons: do not be seated in katar's table. horrible service.  enough said, i dont even want to get into detail. it was that bad."
A. T.,"Lemoore, CA",2,112,,5.0,8/14/2011,"Great first time experience at the Cheesecake Factory We showed up at prime dinner time on a Saturday night only to have to wait 15 minutes before seating. Our waitress was awesome, very attentive and had quick witted comebacks to my sarcastic humor. Wasabi crusted ahi tuna. Awesome! Huge tuna steak seared to perfection and tasted so smooth and good. I ordered brown rice with it. The sauce mixed with the rice and veges was a perfect combination. Droooool! Shrimp Franchese. Awesome! Red Velvet Cheesecake was good  Original cheesecake was really good Carrot Cake was huge and was good"
Sally A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,4,4,5.0,11/23/2013,"It is my favorite place every, service amazing the food and the cheesecake perfect I love Cheesecake Factory"
Diana N.,"Anaheim, CA",7,76,1,3.0,6/24/2011,"3.5 During this trip to the Cheesecake Factory, my friends and I were getting together for the first time this summer.  Our server was Chris and he was really nice, however there was some miscommunication. When we ordered our food my best friend had ordered an artichoke dip with crab (or something like that) and I ordered the factory burger on whole wheat bread. Apparently the crab dip was not available, which we didn't find out about until the food came, and our waiter said that he could have sworn she ordered the regular dip because he would have informed her of the crab dip not being in season.  As for my burger, it came on sour dough instead of the whole wheat. I didn't bother asking for it to be remade since we had already waited for 10-15 minutes for my order to arrive. I will say that considering how CF is expensive as f***, my burger was actually one of the few things I can say was worth the price (despite it not arriving as ordered). It was pretty big and on the sour dough bread (shaped like baguettes) it looked more like a sandwich, and i could barely eat any of my fries.  Had my order actually arrived as ordered then it would have gotten a 4. Also I felt like we spent a lot of time waiting/looking for our waiter."
Channa P.,"Knoxville, TN",325,474,166,4.0,4/7/2011,"I hope there is Cheesecake Factory in heaven! I started an awesome Sunday at Cheesecake Factory to take part in the Sunday brunch. I got my mimosa and ordered what I went there for, the Monte Cristo. How can you go wrong with a ham, bacon, egg, and cheese stuffed between two pieces of French toast. It is just Oh-So-Good! My comrade got the Bourbon Street Omelete and loved it. He said it had a good kick to eat.  It was to early to order a cheesecake to go, and I really had too much going on that day to box it and let it sit in the car. But the cheesecake (ordered to go because you can't eat it after a meal) is always a  move."
Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,4.0,9/8/2008,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise, although, this one was particularly nice because of the sheer size and close proximity to my hometown. Before the Anaheim Cheesecake Factory opened, I had to go to the one in Brea or the one in Huntington Beach. Definitely, if ambiance is a major factor in your dining experience, you should go to this Cheesecake Factory over the others in southern California. The food at this location has been on par with my visits to other Cheesecake Factories. I usually order a sun-dried garlic tomato and chicken pasta or the steak diane. I prefer sitting at the bar because I can get seated quickly and get immediate service from either the bartender or the server assigned to the bar. Drinks at the bar are your normal non-happy hour priced fare. So far, they've served all the usual cocktails and beers that I drink, and that's a good thing. The last time I went here was during the peak of the gymnastics session of the Beijing Olympics. I remember the other patrons at the restaurants were particularly critical of the Chinese gymnasts because of their supposed young age and occasional cheers and boos at the judges' calls filled the air. I actually like that kind of social effervescence because it makes the place turn from a formal setting to a more down-to-earth and relate-able place.  Plus, meeting tourists who just came from Disneyland is always fun, in my opinion. The overall atmosphere here is more relaxed than other Orange County cities and the only downside to all this would be the parking situation and getting validation after your meal."
Sausha B.,"Castaic, CA",98,56,25,3.0,11/12/2012,"I loved the atmosphere of this location but the food was mediocre and our waitress was kinda weird. I mean she was nice, just seemed like she was trying to hard to be cool and hip. Calling us dude and saying things like 'that sandwich is sick, right?' It kinda made me uncomfortable. Next time I'm in the mood, I will be choosing a different location, that's for sure."
Merrill M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",458,472,38,3.0,9/1/2010,"Not bad not bad at all Cheesecake Factory.... although you could work on some manners and speed up the cooking process. First good point we were seated right away, but it was a Tuesday night at 8:30pm. But regardless we were seated right away and our server took our drink orders and off she went. I just ordered a coke which came in a huge glass but was only refilled twice and empty most of the time. I ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. Ordered the steak medium. It came with mashed potatoes which are always good eats. The steak Diane was tender but a bit burnt on the edges which killed have the steak. The shrimp scampi was great but I only got 4 pieces of shrimp.. WTH!! The sauce was excellent. I used as gravy for my mashed potatoes. I finished my food within 20 mins and was semi stuffed. So we decide to order the red velvet cheesecake. Its huge of course. The red velvet cake was awesome but the cheesecake was a bit tooo thick or was still a bit frozen. It tasted ok but a bit overwhelming after a few bites. Not sure if I could order that again since it feels like I ate too much of it already. My wife ordered the flat iron steak which was ok nothing fancy the fries it came with were plain and the onion rings were soggy.  So back to the service. She was super nice but kept bumping into my shoulder to get my drink or give me my food. And the wait was a bit long. You ever get to that point while talking to each other in your group and silence falls and you wonder DAMN its been a long time since we ordered. Well yeah we got to that point. I was super hungry.  But overall it was just A-OK. couldn't give them that 4 stars since I wasn't really in awe or taken away."
SevenEleven H.,"Prattville, AL",0,9,,5.0,8/1/2014,"Damn, this place got packed by 7pm on a Thursday afternoon. Even with that being said it only took 20 min to be seated. The staff was perfect and the food was great. According to the person that sat us, this particular Cheesecake Factory is one of the five highest grossing restaurants in its chain, and it was no surprise to me since this place is huge and all the tables were filled. Don't forget to get your parking ticket stamped before you leave so you don't have to pay for parking."
Kaelin T.,"Santee, CA",10,61,6,4.0,6/6/2013,"Whilst this is a chain restaurant the service was very nice I had a very pleasant meal here after a day at Disneyland. Our server was very nice and helpful, food came out quickly and was delicious. The Oreo cheescake was SO good. I would definitely come here again, they definitely know how to fill you up."
Yareli M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,161,393,2.0,3/24/2011,"I decided to come to this location hoping the experience would be different than the one at Bella Terra in Huntington Beach (which is my usual spot i go to). I decided to throw my sisters B-Day dinner at this one because it looked like it was a great location and it looked a lot bigger than the one i usually go to (Bella Terra - HB) which did not disappoint. Place was huge!! It had so much room i was shocked! But the service is the reason for 2 stars, it should be more of 2 1/2. Of course when we got there we knew we had to wait, the line was huge. Its to expect 30-40 minutes at the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated finally after waiting 30 minutes, i was actually expecting something roomy. I was very wrong. They tried to fit 7 ppl in a booth that fit about 5. We were crowded and the table was not big enough to fit all of our drinks, plates, and food. So i asked the waitress (very nice btw) if she could find us better seating. She let me know she would check and said unfortunately those other tables that were a lot roomier were already being set for other ppl. I actually had to complain 3 times about our seating, until finally she got us a better spot with a lot more room. Also the fact that she was nice and polite about it, thats the one star.  We had already ordered our food and were still waiting, i know we were a party of 7 but i saw other parties get their food a lot quicker. When we finally got our food i was so excited hoping to eat that Louisiana pasta i love so much from there. I was disappointed, the chicken tasted Ok and the pasta tasted blah. It definitely did not have the same taste as the one at Bella Terra. The second star was  because the waitress was nice enough to take care of all my B-Day surprise requests for my sister.  I can say i would not come back to this Cheesecake Factory again, unless one of my friends has a B-Day dinner there. Other than that i will definitely stick with my usual Cheesecake Factory in Bella Terra, Huntington Beach - love it!"
