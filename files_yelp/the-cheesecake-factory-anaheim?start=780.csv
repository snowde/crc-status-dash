Elizabeth O.,"Williamsburg, VA",183,663,136,4.0,7/10/2012,"This location has free parking in the Garden Walk structure, lots of seating in their bar area, and a great happy hour from 4pm to 6pm.  As always, I enjoy their sweet corn fritters and Mac N' Cheese balls. Yummy!"
Nellie B.,"La Puente, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2014,Food was decent I wish I could say the same for the staff... Everyone who worked there acted as if they had somewhere else better to be. All very rude. I can't say that I would go back...
Anthony W.,"Murrieta, CA",92,406,27,5.0,5/15/2013,"What can I say....Cheesecake always delivers on big ass, gut busting portions for a decent price. And the bread is always on point. Make sure you come knowing what you want or I guarantee you'll be searching for a long time. Their menu is a phone book. Today I got a huge Southwestern Chicken Salad ( I think that's what it's called). It was super filling after a crazy workout. Wish I had more room for a snickers cheesecake."
Lydzel Jayr L.,"Bellflower, CA",48,11,13,5.0,11/11/2010,"Be it here or any cheesecake factory... their service, food and drinks are EXCELLENT!!! they are located almost anywhere so whenever u need great selection and mouthwatering desserts... this is the place to be!  our server was very nice and attended right away to our every need. the food was just right in time but excellent in taste, and they have a lot of desserts to choose from.... ive tried their 30th anniv cheesecake, white chocolate with blueberry cheesecake, godiva chocolate cheesecake, brownies cheesecake, oreo cheesecake and etc... i just cant get enough!  definitely coming back for more!"
Yuki M.,"Irvine, CA",36,1107,3952,1.0,4/4/2008,"Their cheesecakes aren't even good. Too many chemicals and preservatives. Bitchy waitress who never gives her name. Various servers come to your table with other people's food but your table's order goes amiss. 15 minutes to get water. Another 5 minutes to get a straw...unwrapped.....handed to you. Bland and flavourless, over cooked Rib Eye. How do you manage to make a Rib Eye flavourless? Dry and Crisco soaked onion straws. SARAN WRAP found in your chicken dish. Manager and General Manager come to apologize and ONLY COMPS THE DISH and not the entire table. Neither of them gave their names. To Go order of comped Cheesecakes came to the table on dishes. I reminded the nameless waitress they were to go. She stares at me like I'M the bitch. WTF? And I get charged for one of them. Didn't leave a tip but I DID leave the Yelp website. I don't like Cheesecake Factory at all. Never did. Someone else chose tonight's dinner. Loved the company and conversation and I have a story to tell, but NEVER will I visit ANY Cheesecake Factory ever again. Over priced. Over hyped. Barely edible slop served under ridiculously high ceilings and even more ridiculous pillars that are large enough to support a fucking hippopotamus ballet. I'm at a loss as to how this chain has remained so damned popular. It blows serious ass."
Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, CA",110,243,1810,4.0,3/27/2011,"My boyfriend and I visited this Cheesecake Factory tonight.  It was super crowded, so we just sat at the bar.  We weren't very hungry, so we ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wings appetizer.  Boy, was it hot!  My mouth was about to burn off!  We also got a couple of drinks - I got the Blueberry Mojito (delicious), and my boyfriend got the Eel River Organic Amber beer.  We finished off with a slice of Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  Our bartender/waitress was awesome!  She noticed that it's my boyfriend's birthday when checking our IDs and she had the cheesecake dish decorated with a Happy Birthday message for him.  She was very attentive throughout our meal as well.  We got to watch some NBA basketball too while sitting at the bar.  Overall, it was a very good experience!"
Sarah M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2014,"The good: the staff is almost always friendly and helpful, and the free bread is yummy. The ""Eye of Sauron"" decorations on top of the pillars- check them out, so nerdy-awesome. The bad: The bar served reasonably priced SIMPLE, WELL cocktails with small, silent tvs for the sports fans. The ambiance is so dark you can't see, (the food, your friends, stuff to trip on on the floor...) and so loud you may lose your voice and I always get a headache. The food ranges from decent to yummy, but is all grossly overpriced. (I was charged $26 for 6 boring grilled shrimp, 1 serving of steamed rice, and 1 serving of steamed veg.) The ugly: PRETENTIOUS menu! ""Glamburgers"" won't make skinny b-words eat a real burger, and ""Skinnylicious"" diet menus!? Who are you kidding? SO gimmicky. Have any food allergies? Don't bother! They could only offer a GF menu, (but like everywhere, contamination is possible). Longer wait times than Disneyland. On a Tuesday night, we were told 45 minutes for our party of 10, but ended up waiting 70. Birthdays? They sing to you over an egg cup filled with mostly whipped cream. They are the Cheesecake Factory, couldn't they use the money from their over-priced cheesecake sales to sing over a bite-sized square of, I don't know, CHEESECAKE!?  If you go there, sit at the bar, don't plan on having an understandable conversation,  get a crazy expensive slice of cheesecake, (they leave the prices off the menu for a reason,) and get out of there!"
Alex A.,"Sylmar, CA",399,259,24,3.0,3/18/2013,"After hitting Joe's Crab Shack, we wanted desert, so we went to Cheesecake for some carrot cheesecake, about 900 calories, I only knew that afterwords. The slices seemed to be smaller than I can remember, which might be a good thing. So I order my carrot cheesecake and my wife order her white chocolate something and paying $15.00 plus tax, I ate it and then wished I hadn't, too sweet and too expensive, I would of rather had me some Stan's Donuts, really!! I know that I will be back, because, I'm only talking with regret, I would eat the regular cheesecake with strawberries on top next time, so until then!!!"
Marilyn S.,"Artesia, CA",34,8,6,2.0,4/19/2013,"So, I called them on April 5th to let them know that my group was sick. The hostess got the manager and he apologized for our painful experience. He said the restaurant would do a full check of the kitchen and facilities as to what could have gone wrong. He also gave us our money pack in gift-card form. This was great costumer service from the manager and I do plan on going again. I've heard great reviews on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp :) It's not pasta, but Im willing to try!"
Cindy W.,"San Diego, CA",1167,638,2049,3.0,3/25/2010,"After finishing 2 days of testing, over 16 hours of sitting in a chair and 500 multiple choice questions I really wanted to let loose! It just so happened that my bf's family was in town and so we decided to go meet them in their hotel around Disneyland. I was very surprised that his very asian aunt and uncle wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Normally FOB people don't really go to Cheesecake Factory and we like to stick with our Chinese food. However, around Downtown Disney there doesn't seem to be much Asian food at all.  After the waitress came, my bf's aunt was trying to figure out what was on the menu, and his very Asian grandparents were confused about the menu and even made a joke saying that ""even though we can't read the menu, we can see the prices""  After about 2 minutes of asking the waitress what was good on the menu we finally all ordered. I had the chicken pesto pasta with arugula and prosciutto. The chicken was breaded in bread crumbs and a little bit on the dry side but all in all pretty flavorful. The pesto sauce wasn't overly salted or too oily.  We also had the garlic noodles which could have had a little bit more garlic. The chicken Madeira is one of their most popular chicken dishes. It has a mushroom sauce along with mounds of mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Service was pretty bad since our party had 8 people and they automatically charge you 18% tip.  But all in all pretty interesting to come with a FOB family :)"
Lida K.,"Irvine, CA",126,216,9,1.0,4/16/2010,Let me break it down: 20 minutes for the waiter to visit us the first time 10 minutes to get drinks 10 minutes to order appetizers 10 minutes to get appetizers and told us she'll be back to get food orders 15 minutes and we flagged down 3 random waiters to put in food orders 20 minutes for uncooked pasta and steaks not cooked as ordered 30 minutes to get check Bottom line service was ass.  Went there for dinner with friends and ended up staying about 2 hours not by choice.   I don't have that kind of patience.  Maybe you do.  Maybe you'll love this place so much you'll rub your face against the menus as you'll be looking at it for almost a hour before somebody takes your order.  Who knows.
Rj H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,1,5.0,12/29/2013,The food is overrated and way to expensive. But especially the service sucks. The waiters are too buay and slow. They are not attentive to the customers. We are never coming back to this place ever again.
Veronica H.,"Indio, CA",730,323,57,5.0,4/27/2012,"I ordered off of their skinny menu because their usual portions are enormous. I got the chicken skinny pasta and it was very delicious. For dessert we had the triple chocolate cake with almonds. Over my experience was very good, we had an attentive waitress and were seated very quickly."
Chris F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,167,11,4.0,10/18/2011,"We had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory mid Oct. 2011 during a recent visit to Disneyland.  The restaurant is located about 2  1/2 blocks from the park entrance with free parking with validation right next door for the first hour. For informal dining, this place is fantastic.  The menu is huge and so are most of the portions.  There is a little bit of everything on the menu from salads and pastas, pizzas & burritos, burgers and seafood and on and on.  It is all good and is a nice change from the food in the park.  Everything was fresh and warm for things that needed to be.  They have a full bar and the deserts are great if you are a cheesecake fan.  Our bill was around $45 for our party of 3, with plenty of leftovers to take back for later."
Oliver P.,"Garden Grove, CA",46,10,1,4.0,1/20/2014,This place is the best love their cheesecake must have! With a beer and their Alfredo pasta.
Roman A.,"Monterey Park, CA",38,7,4,2.0,4/30/2012,"In my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory is overrated! I prefer to spend money on a restauraunt that at least has a nice scenery."
James G.,"Long Beach, CA",157,36,8,3.0,5/1/2013,Just OK. I had lunch with 3 friends today and the wait for our meals seemed a bit longer then normal. I had the seared wasabi crusted Tuna and all I have to say was a  large flavorless dish. The portion was large but the flavor was just average and a bit over cooked. Its my second time at this location and I think overall its just OK   nothing special at all.  Not a fan..
Paul C.,"Fremont, CA",49,142,,3.0,4/24/2011,"Seeing that this location of the Cheescake Factory was a 10 minute walk from our hotel, we decided to come here for lunch.  What can I say?  The food is consistent across the company as it is a chain restaurant.  During this visit, I decided on the Farmer's Burger and it was definitely good.  It was cooked medium just as I asked but I notice that it does not come with as much fries as it used to.  The others in my group had the fish and chips and the meatloaf, both which also looked really good.  Typical of Cheesecake Factory, the portions were pretty big that I didn't have room for cheesecake. I would have given this location 4 stars but the service was not what I expected.  Our server came by a few times during our meal to check up on us and we had to ask one of the runners for more bread.  Anyways, I'm sure this was just related to the server we had for the day and I would come back next time I'm in So Cal to try it again."
John B.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",82,35,29,5.0,3/8/2013,Wife and i sat at bar and enjoyed the people that worked there. The food was good and looking forward to going back
Jen E.,"Beaverton, OR",280,264,97,4.0,1/7/2014,"so ...... my family was gathered in CA, where we all started from. We went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night ...there was 7 of us and 4 generations..... I have to say the only thing I HATE HATE HATE is how loud the music is when you add that to customers and the acoustics of every one of their places it gets to be very loud and hard for my grandmother to hear anything. With that being said, we chose to sit outside. The waitress was attentive but not hovering, took her time with each and every person to make sure our orders were what we wanted, drinks were what we wanted and that the food was up to par....it was. We all left happy and a little sad we did not get to see Sheldon, Penny, Leonard or any of the rest of the group (and extra points to you if you understood that sentence) I have always loved the diversity of the menu and continue to be astounded that the chefs are able to execute that big of a menu with little to no mistakes"
