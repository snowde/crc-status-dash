Ashley M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",38,21,4,5.0,10/8/2017,"This was the best dining experience I've had in a long time. Valerie C. was warm and very accommodating. I ordered the Caesar salad with steak, hot chocolate, chips and salsa, and a slice I'd strawberry cheesecake. Valerie made sure to follow my very specific whipped cream instructions, quite comical indeed. I had her take my last order, which entails a whole to go container, normally reserved for cheesecake, filed to the gills with whipped cream. I can't say enough how great the service was, I'll be happy to return to this location for delicious entrees, fresh wheat bread and appetizers and hot, creamy cocoa."
Nicole T.,"Turlock, CA",8,70,18,2.0,10/27/2017,"Okay, I ordered the breakfast sandwich and when I first took a bite, I thought it was really good. A few more bites in, my mind changed. I don't know if it was the egg, the bread, the bacon, or the combination, but the sandwich was so greasy. It was almost nauseating and the other people I came with were disappointed in their food as well. This was severely overrated, not worth the expensive prices."
Nicki S.,"Long Beach, CA",11,86,124,4.0,9/5/2016,Really good service . I really enjoy this location because they have great waiters which means great service .  I tried a new dish today & it was excellent. Only reason I'm giving 4/5 only stars is because they took to long with bread the brown bread wasn't ready until it was almost time for me to go.
Joe E.,"Ridgecrest, CA",2,1,4,5.0,10/8/2017,Valerie C was an awesome waitress! She made sure that we were taken care of and had everything set in a quick and orderly fashion while being very professional as well.
Elizabeth P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,6,1.0,12/9/2017,The one star is for the food. It was great. Other than that do not order food to go. I called and ordered a pasta and a sandwich. They told me 20 min and It will be ready. I get there 30 min after I order.. still not ready.. 45 min pass I see food go on top of the counter and still haven't heard my named called out like they said they would do. An hour and 15 min go by and I asked how much longer. That bag that was on top of the counter was mine and it's been ready and they never called my name like they said they would. They js expected me to know that that was mine when there were A few people waiting. I was angry with the cashier and all she was doing was being all giggly and flirty with another server. I asked her why she didn't call my name out it's been sitting there and now it's cold. She said it's the managers fault. It doesn't take a manager to call a name out that's been sitting there for 45 min. I spoke the the manager and he was a young guy who didn't care what he was doing. None of these people care about their job. The goal Is the guest experience making people want to come back again. I defiantly do not want to go back here.... another night I came to sit down and eat and the service was pretty basic. Girl was super serious in a monotone voice and hardly came to check on my table. The employees here suck. Cheesecake Factory needs to get thier stuff together and hire better people. After the night with the cashier and my food sitting out for 45 min I will never come to this Cheesecake Factory again and I'll be sure to talk to cheesecake corporate offices bc this Is unacceptable. I understand It can get busy. I don't mind waiting but please next time don't tell me 20 min when it's actually and hour and 15 min with my food sitting there for about 45 min all cold in a paper bag.
Susan A.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,7,,5.0,10/8/2017,"From the moment we walked in, the service was great. Friendly greeting as we walked in. Our server was attentive and friendly. She did a good job of explaining some of the dishes on the menu that we had questioned. The food was good as well, the manager came by to see if everything was ok, and the restrooms were clean."
Rene C.,"Orange, CA",65,104,70,1.0,5/14/2017,"The wait. Not bad. The bar service. Pretty good. Ariel. HORRIBLE. I have experienced good and bad service from servers during my lifetime but tonight was simply horrible. Most servers are either really friendly or they fake it but  at least they try. Our server had the personality of a mannequin.  My friend was the first to point out that Ariel was the first server who did not smile. Don't get me wrong, she was polite but in a unnatural, almost forced manner. It seemed as if she was reading a script to herself and was thinking what a waste of time it was. She took our drink order and when she returned I kindly requested lemon for the water since she forgot to bring it. During our meal, she checked up on us to make sure that our food was to our satisfaction and ask about drink refills but each time it was such a dry and impersonal tone. I don't appreciate fake kindness but I would have felt more comfortable if she had made a little effort to be more human and less robotic. Everyone in our party felt odd when she would speak to us because she didn't seem to be enjoying herself in the least; it was as if she was in some type of physical pain. Very strange.  In the end, she forgot to validate our parking garage ticket so my friend had to pay rather than park the car and walk all the way back to the restaurant. All in all, we were more in disbelief than anything that Ariel was hired to serve patrons and we hope that she finds a new line of work. Or a simple smile would go a long way. Even a fake smile."

Michelle A.,"West Hollywood, CA",672,23,11,5.0,9/26/2017,"Very quick delivery, as requested and oh so delicious, as usual :) xo"
Eugene S.,"Anaheim, CA",25,154,18,5.0,1/22/2017,"A dinner out doesn't get any better than this. Food that was way beyond expectation for my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. Certainly priced fairly considering the quality of preparation, the top-notch service, the great surroundings and ambience. I just loved every bit of it.  I could go on and on, but I see what I have been missing. Dinner for 2 here with dessert to take home and tip was about $60. I consider that a very good deal for a memorable dining experience. Thanks for making our evening special, guys."
Sam M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",10,39,8,5.0,3/18/2017,"We had dinner here me and my friend on Saturday night (just now) we ordered the hibachi steak and crust salmon, both tasted amazing, we also ordered chicken BBQ pizza to go. Our server Elizabeth did a great job, she is very polite and good on customer service."
Brad C.,"Anaheim, CA",113,2,,5.0,2/8/2017,"It's been my experience that every thing here is good, but sometimes it's the service that makes the restaurant. This afternoon I met up with my best friend for a late lunch. We ordered our favorite small plate to share and she ordered the chicken wraps. I went with our server's (Sabrina) recommendation and had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. Turned out to be best chicken dish I've ever had, and my bestie ate half! Like I said earlier every thing is good here, but the best part of the experience was indeed the service!  Sabrina is what a business wants and needs in its employees. She is more of an ambassador than server. She maintained a genuine smile the entire time, her recommendations were dead on, and she was effortlessly patient. The best description of how she made us feel was part friend, part family, part VIP.  So try what I had, and hope you get Sabrina for your server."
Jesus R.,"Milpitas, CA",54,19,15,1.0,2/5/2017,"First off I'd like to start by saying that I've been a server so I do know what I'm complaining about.   Second the food wasn't the issue the service was.   We walked in and we were seated within 5 minutes witch is great for a Saturday night so I was excited about that. You never m ow how long you'll have to wait to be seated. So immediately I thought ( great this won't take long ) it was 9pm on Saturday.  We get sat and our server immediately approach the table and told us he'd be right with us. So again I was thinking things are going great, fast to be seated and fast to be greeted.  So when our server returned roughly 5 minutes later we ordered our drinks and a starter. 20 minutes come by and we're still waiting on 1 drink ( hot water ) so finally we get the hot water and no starter. 25 minutes later we get to actually tell our server what we are having for dinner. "" 40 minutes now and finally we get our starter and then 3 minutes later our food. So the timing was pretty off. Not to mentioned out kid was super hungry and received his food 5 minutes after we got ours.  Oh and I forgot to mentioned it was his birthday so he chooses this place . Granted he just turned 9 but it was his choice.  Anyhow 3 out of the 4 dishes came out right but one of them was undercooked so now we're waiting on this to come back and I'm sure you've guessed by now that it took some time. I know this is one of those rants but again I was a server up to last year and I do know how it works and I know it gets busy but I also k ow it's part of the job to have timing down. Our server had a good personality and yes that's part of the job to get better tips but, what's good personality if the service part of your job is off.  Anyhow we just laid the bill and left."
Marissa P.,"Anaheim, CA",65,46,25,4.0,5/21/2017,"My favorite restaurant. Love the bread. I always order chicken Romano and bistro shrimp pasta. Would have liked to give 5 stars here but when we ordered sun dried tomatoes with our pasta, they gave us just regular tomatoes and didn't believe us."
Jessica O.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",32,182,105,4.0,2/27/2017,We have been to this Cheesecake Factory location a few times now because it's always by our hotel when we visit Disney. The place is always packed but they manage to handle the crowds of people just fine and make you feel like the only diners in there with the amazing service they always provide. The menu is huge just and the food doesn't disappoint.
Stefany P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,2,5.0,7/2/2017,"Cheesecake never seems to disappoint me! Delicious food , strong refreshing mojitos, amazing cheesecake, excellent service. What more can you ask for! A big thank you to my waitress Marley she was super sweet and attentive"
Donnetta T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,3,7,1.0,7/14/2016,"I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. The description stated honey glazed chicken. I got my meal and there wasn't enough creamy chipotle sauce and it was watered down, it included chunks of cooked chicken without the glaze, fine, whatever, it's okay.  our waitress came to ask how things were I was going to ask about the glaze and she ignored me and talked with another person at our table and then left. She comes back and asked if we want our food boxed up and as I was handing my plate to her, not to box up but to take back, she takes all the plates at the table except mine. Maybe it's because I'm in the corner, I'm at a loss. Oh well, I'm not coming here again. I still love CCF  just not this one, but that's the beauty of CCF, there so many!!  That's all folks."
Brianna T.,"Renton, WA",248,43,42,3.0,4/29/2017,Service wasn't that great. Our drinks weren't kept filled up and we had to wait forever to get our check. Not acceptable. I had to go to the front desk and ask for a manager or someone who could bring our check and was told to step to the side... no one ever addressed the issue so I just went back to the table. Food was good though.
Mark E.,"Downey, CA",41,30,3,4.0,5/12/2017,"You'll most likely have a wait, but there's a very good reason; The Cheesecake Factory has consistent quality, excellent service and fair pricing. I like the Anaheim location in-particular.  In addition to the other qualities consistent (in my experience) throughout the brand, this CF enjoys convenient, validated parking. In-regards to the menu, as anyone who's been here knows, a little bit of everything. Done right."
Kevin P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/30/2017,"About to leave for the airport but my wife reminded me to do this. I don't usually leave reviews but I know some restaurants recognize employees and I want to point out one. If I do leave one it's for a good reason.  Waiter was George and he was very charismatic. The bread was cold but that probably wasn't his fault. I ordered the chicken Marsala, my wife had the Steak Diane, I think my daughter had fish and chips. The food took a while to get out to the table.  We were very close to leaving. When we did get it though it satisfied us and was pretty good. The steak was a bit tough. Chicken was just a little too dry. It was a good meal regardless. Didn't get any cheesecake at the table But As we were leaving we turned the corner and Terra from the cheesecake station was hustling with dishes then stopped and elegantly moved to the side for us to pass and nodded with a very bright smile. She was the only person besides our waiter to smile and we knew our waiter just wanted tips. My wife asked her for her name and even had a conversation with her about how she likes working there and my wife can tell she cares about making the guest feel good. Subtle acts of kindness make a huge impact. If it weren't for Terra in the Cheesecake section this review wouldn't have gotten the fourth star. She recommended the S'mores and the Tuxedo cake so we got those to-go. Look for the girl with the golden smile!!!!!!!"
