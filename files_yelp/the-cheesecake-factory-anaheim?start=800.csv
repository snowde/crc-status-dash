Chris S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",12,410,7,3.0,4/2/2013,"Food is okay. Different experiences over the years. I think that the drinks suck and are weak. I do like certain dishes, but you have to ask yourself "" how good can the food really be?"" when there are 300 things on the menu. Some stuff I like(scampi) and some stuff I don't(jambalaya). I guess it depends on what kind of mood. The dessert is great, the decor looks like a Bellagio bathroom. Service is usually okay. Solid 3 stars."
Teo B.,"East Bay, CA",105,86,23,4.0,1/11/2011,"Cheesecake Factory had made some changes in their menu.. some bad, some good.  One of the good changes was adding the seared tuna tataki salad. The salad was just the right amount, the wasabi vinaigrette was versatile.  You can dip your tuna in there or put it in your salad. You can't go here without ordering cheesecake duh! So we had the banana creme cheesecake and it had fresh banana on the side and my friend ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake.  There's just too many options that you gotta try something different each time you come here. Other cheesecakes that I really like is the 30th year anniv. cake for the chocolate lovers and it has those caviar balls that melts in your mouth like the malt balls but mini version and the Red Velvet cake with white chocolate in it.  Did someone say the magic word? Deadly combination =)"
Jose C.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,9,,4.0,8/22/2013,Food was delicious disappointed because they changed the Oreo cheesecake and if the servers are going to wear all white they should learn how to do laundry
Christina A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",12,39,5,4.0,12/11/2012,Ate here on a break from Disney. Hubby had BBQ burger and I had kale salad and margherita flatbread. Service was great but only giving 4 stars bc flatbread wasn't great!
Chris A.,"Anaheim, CA",108,30,6,4.0,2/19/2011,"I try to save my 5 star rankings for places that totally blow me away. This is why Cheesecake Factory gets 4 stars from me.  Cheesecake Factory's food is good and pretty consistent with other locations. There really hasn't been anything I didn't like. My only comment is that if you are looking to order items such as Pad Thai or Beef Ribs, you are better off eating at places that specialize in those types of meals. But, the nice thing is that there is a wide variety of items to choose off their menu.  As a suggestion, if you are looking to try a good cheesecake, get the Red Velvet Cheesecake! IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD!  If you plan to dine here on the weekends, expect it to be busy. After all, it is located at the Anaheim GardenWalk, which is near Disneyland. ENJOY!"
Marie M.,"Stanton, CA",16,15,1,5.0,9/27/2013,"I had a marvelous customer service experience here, the server guided me through their enormous menu of 200 items to chose from it was like WOW. The server and everyone smiled they acknowledged my presence and made me feel special throughout my whole dining experience. I tried pasta with new york cheesecake and a red wine and everything is perfectly presented and delicious. It's all the money's worth I loved it here. The whole staff are dressed with really nice uniforms, clean, and maintain professionalism."
Helen T.,"Anaheim, CA",2,19,119,1.0,1/1/2013,Waitress spilled hot coffee all over my shoes. Manager didn't do anything about it. Service was very slow. Took an hour to get our food. The food quality has gone down drastically in this place. Will probably never come back.
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,4.0,11/7/2011,"I don't make it down to Anaheim very often - but we were there for the Disney Classic @ the Convention Center and needed food.  We walked passed PF Changs, Bubba Gumps, and Roy's to end up at Cheesecake. Service was excellent, and the server was more than willing to go out of his way to serve us. Funny how I keep ending up at Cheesecakes everywhere."
Stacey A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,75,22,4.0,10/28/2010,"Service My boyfriend and I went here on a very busy night. Despite the excessively busy restaurant, our waitress was the most attentive, helpful and social waitress I've ever had a restaurant. It was almost as if she was standing just off to the side of our table and knew exactly when we needed her. I didn't expect as great of service as we got with a full restaurant. Dinner I ordered a passion fruit mojito and the incredible grilled eggplant sandwich. The Mojito was D-licious! The grilled eggplant sandwich was huge and messy. definitely requiring some extra napkins (and it wasn't the mojitos fault). The bread got a little soggy from the juice sandwich, but besides all the messiness the flavors that came out of that sandwich would make your mom's home cookin' cry. Yep, that good. I would definitely order that again. Dessert I will have to admit, I'm not a huge cheesecake fan. I'm more of a pumpkin pie fan. So, I was delighted to see that they had a seasonal Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake that just came out 2 days before I went there. I was a little skeptical because I imagined that the cheesecake would kind of neutralize the pumpkin flavor and that it wouldn't be very pumpkiny. The pumpkin flavor was not drowned out in any way. I'm no longer a pumpkin pie fan. I'm a cheesecake factory pumpkin pie cheesecake fan. The pumpkin flavor from that cheesecake may be even stronger than an ordinary pumpkin pie. It was beautiful and delicious. The best ever. Dessert #2   ;0) Don't call me a fatty just yet. It was actually only a couple bites of my boyfriends Banana Cream Cheesecake. Oh my...this cheesecake will play tricks on you. It makes you think ""yum banana cream""...then the aftertaste hits you like a wall, and you're thinking ""OMG banana cream fiesta just exploded in my mouth!"". Watch, order it and you will see what I mean. It's gooood. Pricing Definitely not a place to go for a cheap date. Food is really good, you get good portions (leftovers) and it's worth the price, but the prices are not cheap."
Brenda A.,"Summerville, SC",5,244,1,2.0,4/22/2015,"I have experienced way better. Steer clear unless you simply HAVE to be at Disneyland and then have to be at this CCF. Food was ICE cold. It always baffles me how you can have a super busy restaurant and still get ice cold, crappy food. Buffalo wings were so cold that the sauce had congealed on them. The gumbo was cold as were all of the pastas. Our waiter was OK, although dull and lifeless. But the real topped was the rude ho that delivered our food - wow. The table was cram packed with dishes that needed to be removed and she pops up with huge pasta plates bitching ""Fettuccini""?? Well, clear the table first, idiot. Instead, she stands there simply repeating herself like we are deaf. Guess what,..? no matter how many times you say ""Fettuccini"", it aint gonna clear the table.  Still ain't room to put the plate on the table. Man, she bugged. Quality has gone down, service has gone down. We are done with CCF. Lets face it, if you are still a fan of CCF, you like huge portions of commercially prepared food in a fantasy-setting - but essentially, you aren't serious about well-prepared, delicious food."

Kevin S.,"Bon Aqua, TN",80,30,266,4.0,12/5/2010,"We've been to a few of the Cheesecake Factory's in Cali over the years and have never been disappointed. This one was in Anaheim, right around the corner from Disneyland. So, next time at Disney, or even the Convention Center right across the street, stop in for lunch, dinner, or just a wide selection of cheesecake."
Phil P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,1,5.0,8/25/2013,The service was exxellent.  The food was amazing. This place is the bizniz!
Berto M.,"Bellflower, CA",1,3,,5.0,8/23/2013,Great Service! Food is always delicious! Make sure to leave room for dessert
Molly A.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",73,57,934,5.0,10/24/2010,"The Food is amazing and the variety of different dishes is impressive.  I had the Miso Salmon which was delicious with a Strawberry Lemonade. We also had the Mac and Cheese Balls, wow... talk about flavor. Ask for Samuel, he was our waiter and was very attentive to our needs and polite. I highly recommend him. We were a large party of 20 and he had no problem separating our checks in groups. For dessert, We heard that the Pumpkin Pie was too die for, unfortunately I was too full to try some.  The staff, & The cooks are #1 at this CheeseCake Factory."
Christina T.,"Modesto, CA",14,34,,2.0,3/4/2010,"The good news is... they have happy hour now (I'm not sure what time it begins, but it ends at 6 PM). The bad news is... it's not so great.  The inside is the same as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Dark, rich colors, warm feeling. The bar seating for happy hour is tall tables and wicker type chairs, and also stools at the bar.  Nonetheless, it's pretty reasonable price wise. Most of the dishes are between $4.95 and 6.95, and most of the special happy hour drinks are $5.  I went with a party of 6, to sit in the bar area for happy hour. Everyone ordered a plate or 2, and drinks. About half of us were happy with our food, the other half was not, mostly due to the same complaint: not enough flavor.  I had the pink lemonade, which was good, no complaints there. And I also had the potstickers and a pizzette (which is essentially pizza bread with a thin crust). The potstickers were delicious, and they came in a really great sauce. The pizzette was the perfect size for one.  Overall, meh. Parking at The Grove can be hairy at times, so I don't know if another trip over there just for CF HH is worth it."
Hala T.,"Anaheim, CA",8,5,,4.0,4/22/2013,"I love their cake its really good.. when I went there for the first time, I was chocked of how good it is"
Adi R.,"Anaheim, CA",218,103,127,4.0,9/26/2012,Large menu doesn't always mean a great selection. The few items I want to eat are very good but the prices are not easy on the wallet. I would come here more often if it wasn't so expensive.
Karmen N.,"Downey, CA",41,51,5,5.0,4/8/2013,"One of my favorite places to eat!!!!I love coming here.I enjoy this place from the environment,the food, and the desserts!!MY favorites here are the avocado egg rolls, chicken marsala pasta and the steak diane and herb crusted salmon.For the desserts I recommend the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, red velvet, and  there new smore's cheesecake!!!!"
JT N.,"Long Beach, CA",5,46,52,2.0,11/12/2010,"First time I went here, ordered Steak and Salmon, long wait and the first was completely under cooked.  The only reason I gave it two stars was that everyone from the cook up to the manager was very apologic almost every 15 minutes after I brought it to their attention.  It was comp'd. Susequent visits: good service, decent food.  Consistent with other Cheesecake factory."
