Traci D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",226,715,21,3.0,2/5/2010,"The fam went to CF for my brother's birthday.  My brother's rationale was there is something for everyone there.  The place wasn't too busy for a Wednesday and it is located at Anaheim's Gardenwalk. They validate parking which is always nice.  The server was very good with handling our group of 10 which included a hyper almost three year old. Our drinks were refilled quickly, our whole order didn't take long to come out and when we were done eating,our leftovers were nicely boxed for us to take home.   I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Chicken.  This spicy (but not too spicy) dish came with rice, black beans and plantains. It was very good and there was enough for me to take home for a second meal.  My mom also gave me her leftovers to take home and her chicken medallions that I ate the next day were a peppery delight.  It is hard not order Cheesecake from CF and I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go. It is a couple of layers of cheesecake and red velvet cake.  I have been eating a few bites here and there. The slice is huge, its been a few days and I still have a decent amount left.  While the Red Velvet Cheesecake is good, it isn't the factory's finest.  Overall though, it was a good dinner."
Erica F.,"Santee, CA",32,65,1,5.0,10/30/2010,Our server was super nice and she made a good effort to let me know about their vegetarian options. I opted for the fettucini alfredo and I took a slice of the 30th anniversary cheesecake to go. Both were delicious. I would eat there again... as they do have some other veggie options.
Priscilla T.,"Reno, NV",7,20,3,5.0,5/10/2013,This place was excellent food was yummy! And our waiter was great!!! our daughter slept on one side of the booth the entire time. I was so full! Huge portions I couldn't finish my pasta carbonara. can't wait to come back.
Deana L.,"Riverbank, CA",1,17,,4.0,8/9/2014,"Great customer service and the food was very good, we went two days in a row because the menu was so big we found so many things we wanted to try!"
Gissel G.,"Anaheim, CA",25,199,10,4.0,8/28/2012,"We recently went to cheesecake factory for their national cheesecake day special. It was for dine in only, but very good and worth the trip. I often dismiss having dessert here, as I think everything is overpriced, but nonetheless, it's all very very tasty. For simplicity sake, try the plain cheesecake with strawberries. What a moist and fluffy delight."
Jasmine C.,"Coquitlam, Canada",0,3,,5.0,10/3/2014,"Our food was delicious, our portions were huge, and our waiter was amazing. Our glasses were never empty and he had jokes aplenty."
Sue K.,"Norwalk, CA",283,247,249,4.0,9/8/2010,"I would've rated this place 3.5 stars, but the service was absolutely impeccable that I had to give it 4 stars. I dont know what other people are saying here when they got bad service. I came here for my birthday on labor day and members of my family were addressed as ma'am and sir. The food came out quickly and everything I asked from my waitress Roxane was granted immediately. I mean, it could have been a slow day, but I had a good experience.  If you come here for your birthday, you get half a scoop of ice cream with a dollop of whipped cream that is bigger than the half scoop of ice cream. Yes, I said half scoop. It was fine with me since I had a huge red velvet birthday cake waiting for me at home."
Marion M.,"La Mirada, CA",21,81,91,5.0,6/24/2015,"Went here for lunch, the location is convenient to Disneyland area hotels and right beside the Worldmark Anaheim. There was ample parking at the enclosed parking lot, they validate so it was free parking. We came at 12:15 and were seated right away, the waitress came around 5 minutes after we were seated which gave us time to look at the menu. We did not order any appetizers or cocktails, we ordered the Jambalaya and the Louisiana Chicken pasta,but instead of farfalle I substituted for fetuccine. The food was amazing. The Jambalaya was perfectly cooked the boneless,skinless chicken was moist,the shrimp was large and plenty and perfectly cooked, the beans took me back to the Caribbean islands very authentic taste and the rice was on the side (option for brown or white,which we picked white) and it came with sweet plantains as well.The Louisiana Chicken pasta came with breaded chicken on top,it was not spicy, it had bell peppers and mushrooms, we'll seasoned, the chicken was moist-I was pleasantly surprised since the slices were thin. Both were large portions. We ordered a slice of Duce de Leche cheesecake and a capuccino-heavenly. Drinks were soda and ice water. Our check came to $54 with tax,not too bad,we had to go bags. Service was attentive, not too hovering and was easy to get a hold of our waitress. I suggest this place"
Dj Surge D.,"Anaheim, CA",2,6,,1.0,10/8/2014,"i was there last sunday for dinner and the service was ok but the the food and chicken pasta was horrible, it was hard and  4 little pieces of chicken for $18 when you go to a nice and busy place you think food is food... but i was wrong i wont go there again bad food....go there if you want a dessert only , cuz place is nice"
Sarah L.,"Orange, CA",206,155,40,2.0,8/29/2012,"Average food.  Service was horrible.  Waited 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that had absolutely no personality.  She was rude, neglectful and left us half way through our meal."
Alexandria R.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,88,1,4.0,9/27/2012,"Food chains, especially ones like this that have huge menus isn't usually my go-to place for a good dinner out. I like to stick to places that have a smaller, specialized menu they can perfect. But I had to come here to meet some family visiting town. Note that I have only been to a Cheesecake Factory a handful of times, and I only come for the cheesecake - they are definitely heavenly! I took a chance on their food at this location and I was pleasantly surprised by the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. The chicken was very tender and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The service was prompt and friendly. I don't know about the other entrees, but I don't mind taking another crack at their crazy menu roulette-style like I did this time."
Amy S.,"Newhall, CA",51,82,1,2.0,10/6/2011,"We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner after a long week day at Disneyland in September. I called ahead that day to see if they took reservations or could at least note that we would be coming in for his birthday ahead of time so I wouldnt have to worry about him noticing at the restaurant. They couldn't. Oh well, we went anyways. I told the hostess as he went to the restroom and she said she would tell our waiter. It took FOREVER for a waiter to even show up, then took forever to come back after bringing us drinks. Then our 2 appetizers--my pick, the mushroom lettuce wraps and his the ahi tuna poke--also seem to take unusually long. In fact, our ahi never turned up (even though that was his favorite thing on the menu) until his entree arrived. I asked about it, and she said she would bring it and I had to ask her to instead bring my entree because his pasta was ready but my salad wasn't...strange... Needless to say, a new waiter came out and started helping us. The food was good, nothing spectacular but I was excited for dessert. We both got something and it came out (again after a long wait) without even so much as a happy birthday from him.  Needless to say, I was and still am beyond astounded by the service at this Cheesecake Factory. They're right next to so many other restaurants that would have made his birthday incredible. It was a complete let-down and if it weren't for the delicious cheesecake, I would give it a 1-star rating..."
Lynda C.,"Redding, CA",26,255,81,3.0,6/24/2010,"I try not to rate 'chain' restaurants but.................... Red velvet cheesecake..........you betta split it, like 3 or 4 ways. On the cake counter, they list calorie counts, not prices......INTERESTING. Wine was good, food was safe/decent, service was good, and the company, can't be beat........Hi Nancy and Jeff....:-) Located in the garden walk center, so you can stroll off those sinfull calories, and spend that extra money as the prices weren't bad, especially when  your friends are buying..:-)"
Greg E.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",47,18,3,1.0,9/7/2012,"Aside from the desserts, the food here is terrible.  I've had to come here a few times for business lunches, and each time the food has been a disappointment.  If you're in the area, I would suggest PF Changs as a better lunch alternative.  Ewww @ CF!  You're better off to just go full on fat-kid and order a cheesecake for your meal."
Abbe W.,"Irvine, CA",619,616,1261,4.0,4/21/2008,"Like any other branches, the food here is great.  Tasty, good portion and decent price. Service was ok. We seem to have a hard time finding our server. Other tables, their server seems to be around a lot more. The Thai chicken wrap seems to be the ""IT"" thing. Most of the tables seem to order that. One table has like 5 orders of it.  I had the Louisiana Chicken pasta. Very good. Spicy just right amount of sauce. Al dente pasta. Found the copy cat recipe:  Since it's new, it's not very busy. But service is slow, plan for at least 1.5 hours of work lunch.  Parking needs to be validated so make sure you bring your parking ticket if you parked in the structure. The cliente is either disneyland goers or business people."
brad a.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,161,15,5.0,2/15/2012,Ashley G was very friendly.   The food was excellent .   Thanks for staying open late
Rachel R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",83,352,187,3.0,7/15/2010,"It's the same as the other Cheescake Factorys but with an even longer wait!   Food- good.   Service- not very fast.   If you are a tourist go there, if you are local- go to a local place!"
Claire J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,174,181,1.0,1/16/2014,"F'n biatch of a hostess totally passed us up several times.   Conveniently ""forgot"" us.   Yeah, right.   I usually really like CF, but I can't recommend this one."
Leanna E.,"Sonora, CA",12,16,10,2.0,4/6/2013,"I have been to a cheese cake factory before and loved it, but this one was not a good experience. The staff was friendly until we got our waitress. So didn't seem to happy to be there. It seemed as if we were inconveniencing her. She was not friendly by any means! The food was ok, as always a little on the higher price."
Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,14,2,1.0,8/24/2013,"Very bad experience with this shitty place. After a brutal hike at Griffith Park we had to go to Anaheim to hang out at someone's house. On the way there, we endured traffic jams so heavy that we got hungry and randomly picked this Cheesecake factory to drop by. We just planned to go there, shovel up as much food and drink as we could into our growling stomachs and get out of there. We phoned in a reservation and the lady in front gave us a time: 4:15PM. So we show up exactly at that time only to be told that ""the time we quote you over the phone is the time we put your name in the waiting list"". Then I saw an empty table which would fit our party of 9 and asked the manager why could she not seat us at that table. She then dumbly said that ""that table is reserved"". Well, I thought that the time quoted over the phone is the time that we get put on the waiting list? Those people who ""reserved"" the empty table I pointed out were not even there yet so how could they have been reserved a table if they have not arrived ergo, their names are not yet in the waiting list? Why does she have the gall to tell us we have to wait and we came at the appointed time (4:15PM) and the people at the empty table would be seated RIGHT AWAY as soon as they arrive? It makes ZERO SENSE and she is an idiot. The portrayal of the bimbo-like character of a typical Cheesecake Factory staffer as ""Penny"" in the Big Bang Theory is pretty accurate. The only thing is they are dumber in real life and unlike Penny, they are unattractive. Anyway, I think I know what it is. It is plain and simple racism. Look at the reviews. Most reviews that fall below 3 stars are of those who are not of the white race. I have heard of this Orange County BS about this thing going on. Never mind that I earn a lot more in a month than the manager earns in a year. I just stormed out of there, brought our entire party to PF Chang's next door where we were seated right away, the staff and manager were very friendly and the food is vastly superior and flavorful. If you want real service and satisfaction, go Asian."
