Melva O.,"Artesia, CA",9,21,,4.0,8/10/2012,I really like the location of this Cheesecake Factory at the Garden Walk next to Disneyland. It offers the typical Cheesecake Factory experience; I usually order the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus. The servers and bartenders were very friendly and gave excellent service.
Kevin S.,"Santa Clara, CA",192,49,,4.0,9/17/2012,I have always been a fan of cheescake factory. My girlfriend and I had a late flight into LAX and had plans to go to Disneyland for the weekend.  It was almost 10 PM when we finally got into town and were starving.  We found the cheesecake factory and decided to check it out.   Food was as expected.  The cool thing about this particular one was that they were open until 12:30 AM Friday through Saturday which makes it really convenient since people end up getting out of Disneyland at a late time. Would definitely come back to this particular one.
Astra W.,"Cerritos, CA",194,130,170,5.0,5/1/2009,"Just got called out by my buddy Joel Y.  I guess I didn't make myself clear enough in my original review.  So here it is: My FIVE STARS is purely for Willy, the excellent bartender.  He totally memorized my boyfriend's never-changing out-of-the-ordinary non-alcoholic special drink and always remembers that I like to change up my all-alcoholic drink each time I pay Cheesecake Factory a visit.  :) 3.75 ~4 stars goes to the food at Cheesecake Factory and the restaurant itself.  I've realized it's just consistent each time we go there.  Not particularly consistently good or bad.  Just consistent."
Warren F.,"Ancaster, Canada",16,28,9,3.0,8/27/2012,The portions are large and the quality high. I enjoyed the chicken marsala with mushrooms and bow tie past. My wife had two starters; the buffaloo chicken and the beet with goat cheese salad. The food was very good but nout outstanding and seriously the quantity borders on the excessive. It is rare when I leave a restuarant feeling like I wish I hadn't ate it all. The price is excellent and the service was great as well. Good spot to take the family.
Genevieve L.,"Garden Grove, CA",111,90,1,3.0,5/26/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I'm only giving 3 stars because its always over packed and so busy that the service is slow.   But the food, drinks and desserts never disappoint.  My one complaint is that I ordered the Pasta Divinci and asked for them to overcook the pasta and it was still Al Dente.  Which is better than the time before when the pasta was just completely undercooked.   Now that I'm rethinking this, I'm wondering if I should just give them 2 stars, but I think they deserve better than ""Meh, I've experienced better"""
Wolfy W.,"San Francisco, CA",182,346,293,4.0,3/23/2012,"What's not to hate about the Cheesecake Factory other than they know how to overfeed you all the time in most major cities and then finish you off with a double size cheesecake of your choice. Or better yet, share all your meals here!"
Juan G.,"Tustin, CA",1,30,2,4.0,1/23/2012,Love the Chicken Tacos here. They're delish and the service has always been great. Also you can never go wrong with a red velvet cheesecake. Finger and Toe licking good :)
Trisha P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,1,1.0,1/24/2012,There cheesecake maybe good BUT everything else sucks. I ordered the Louisiana chicken and it was sooooooo nasty. They drowned the pasta with black pepper. Who the hell does that come on you dont have to be an idiot to know that that could potentially make a customer sick. So now im lead to believe that the chefs drop acid in between breaks because the food was horrible! ! And so damn expensive 4.50 for a damn raspberry lemonade thats bullcrap!!!
Iris Y.,"Anaheim, CA",2,19,3,4.0,8/12/2012,"Everyone should be reminded that this place is right next to Downtown Disney and Disneyland, therefore, you're going to have to go through street traffic if you want to come in during Friday and Saturday nights. First of all, you can already tell from the menu that this place is multifarious in foods - pastas, seafood, salads, chicken, they got it. That's the problem. They don't really consider trying to make their dishes better. They just try to keep up with new ones! So of course cheesecake is going to be their specialty.  FOR MOUTHGASM RELINQUISHERS: - Deep Fried Macaroni and Cheese.  It may look like four fried balls stuck together but I am not joking. You have got to try it and not even Elbows Mac and Cheese can compare. I was stunned myself, ""WOW how can this place, out of all the foods, create the best mac&cheese?  - Godiva Cheesecake Chocolate lovers, the richness is within the cheesecake. The cream frosting or whatever it's called on top is delicious too! It's not that whipped cream from a can Honestly, whenever I order a meal, it isn't THAT great. It's just an overload of food or more added vegetables."
Lan P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,24,,1.0,7/27/2012,"The service:  I took a few guests from Australia to experience an American chain. It was rather embarrassing.  We had a party of 8.  They told us if we sat outside they could seat us immediately.  The host took us outside to a table that could fit 6 and left us standing around to find out why the mix-up.  He never returned.  While we were standing there like fools, the waitress told us to go back to the front because they couldn't seat us.  I was mad...hell no.  We had already waited about 15 minutes.  I finally told another waitress that we could just squeezed into this table of six.   The food:  Consistently bad.  I can understand if one dish was bad.  I tried everyone's dish and it was all horrible.  My mom had pasta marinara and it was worse than can food.   How can you go wrong with a dish that simple?   The size of the dishes was generous...but it doesn't matter if you can't even stomach the food. Only good thing about the meal was the cheesecake.  Yummy!   Just come here for the dessert."
Holden H.,"Anaheim, CA",38,15,5,4.0,8/20/2009,"Oh, ""Cheesecake"" ""Factory,"" neither mostly about cheesecake nor any sort of factory.  I always love the appetizers, entrees, and desserts, even though I never finish more than 12.5% of anything I order.  It's always an experience in justifiable gluttony, I say.  (Try not to look at the calorie count disclosures required at California chain restaurants.)  Next time, we shall order 1/2 for here and 1/2 to go.  Servers love hearing those types of requests. The Gardenwalk - an outdoor mall in central Orange County (because we were running low on those) - is visually appealing, though our linner/dunch did not permit much time to browse around the location.  Of the many restaurant choices here - Bubba Gump, McCormick's, P.F. Changs, et al - we defaulted to Cheesecake Factory.  It's my favorite back-up place, I will say. It's a chain restaurant, in the same way that Walmart is a ""multi-unit variety store"" (i.e., it's everywhere), so I won't comment further on the food.  Our booth had Cheesecake's reliably backbreaking super-upright seat backs situated nicely next to the server station, where we could hear all the amazingly interesting details of what the staff was going to do once they finished their shifts, as well as how much or little every table tipped them today.  Excellent. The service was fine - reliably efficient and relatively well timed, friendly but still reassuringly formal.  Hearing specials or features, such as the Red Velvet Cheesecake (which they unfortunately did not have), was good.  Boxing our own leftovers was disappointing. Essentially, the Gardenwalk Cheesecake Factory is like all other Cheesecake Factories, which is quite fine with me."
Rick C.,"Buena Park, CA",4,14,,4.0,11/10/2010,"Last night we went out for drinks and dinner at the Cheesecake in Anaheim. Yes I avoided the super uncomfortable patio style chairs and sat in a booth. Funny, next time your in, look at everyone sitting in the chairs as you walk by... never lean back and never looking relaxed. Service ""Excellent!"" Seated right away, you know they are never understaffed... and I love that! Our server was great. Our food served promptly, not rushed... just in time. Drinks made perfect.  We had Won Ton appetizer I think it was called. Cream cheesy, crab. Very tasty served with a tangy sauce.  On to my meal... I have never ordered the ""Shepard's Pie"". I really enjoy a good pot pie so I ordered it. ""What the heck is this"", I thought to myself... but hey I'm not gonna knock it til I try it. I took a pic of it... looks huge and a little scary. Loved it! A hearty meal blending with so many flavors and get the variety as you eat it. Can someone tell me why this is called a pie? I see no resemblance to a pie.  All the same, the ground beef and veggies seasoned to perfection with a not so thick gravy that interesting enough gave me so many different flavors with my meal. Now all of this topped with home mashed potatoes. What a mess, I took a pic and will load it if I can... loved every bite! I will definitely order this again!  Mr.C"
Alexandra B.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,134,21,4.0,3/11/2012,"Cheesecake gets a bad rap, which is sometimes warranted, but now that they have their new ""skinny"" menu, I can't help but want to come here more often.  Previously I felt my arteries hardening as I stared at their 50-page menu, but now I can see this place as a great hangout to get some good tapas style plates without the aforementioned health risk.  My mother and I tried about 5 things off the skinny menu and they were all delicious! Highly recommend."
Tania T.,"San Diego, CA",29,128,36,5.0,8/3/2009,"Visited this location again this weekend - great lunch, new recommendations: -Buffalo blasters (?) appetizers - Frozen mango drink (yum!!!)"
Fiona T.,"San Diego, CA",157,316,50,5.0,7/15/2009,"It's another chain, but I loved my experience here.  I had no idea which burger I wanted to have, but she recommended the ranch house burger. FRICKIN DELICIOUS. It didn't fall apart. I demolished it!!! She hooked me up with lots of napkins. Very sweet waitress, forgot her name.. I went around 11PM and still got great service! Loved my 30th anniversary cheeese cake!!!"
Tammy C.,"Manteca, CA",2,10,42,4.0,7/10/2010,"The restaurant itself was very nice looking and clean.  the area location is new and clean.  I had the Chicken Madeira, the sauce was very bland to me but the garlic mashed potatoes were very good and tasty. I also went another night for desert had the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  it too was bland in taste, expected more of a fudge taste. I received good service when I went, it was a Sunday around 5pm.  Was not busy."
S d.,"Vacaville, CA",0,38,,5.0,7/27/2014,went on Tuesday 7-22-14 about 4PM.    Went with an all appetizer meal.  Wow!  entire order was brought out within 10 minutes.  Very good food and service.  Even though we did not order dinner meals... Bread was still provided....
Kasey F.,"Lewisville, TX",309,407,361,5.0,3/17/2009,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I'd eat here every day if I had the money! Their menu is like 20 pages, so I'd definitely never get tired of it.  I get something new every time I go and everything I've ordered has been delicious.  My favorites are the iced green tea (sweetened) to drink and the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  The BBQ chicken pizza and Kobe beef hamburger are both really good and the appetizer sampler is delicious and has enough food for about three people to be full.  My friends ordered this chocolate cake with like 6 layers before..I don't remember what it was called but it was really good too. We couldn't finish it though because it was so rich! Although in my experience it takes a while to get the food, it's always presented very nicely. Almost so pretty you don't want to eat it! Almost. But like I said, it's all delicious and the portions are pretty big. I've never had a bad experience with the staff there, they've all always been super friendly.  They sang to me on my birthday. :) The only thing I don't like is that they don't take reservations for large groups. I don't know if that's a normal thing or because it was winter formal season or what that whole thing was about."
Kyle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,165,30,3.0,3/18/2012,"It's clean, the service was pleasant, and the food, although not amazing, was alright, but it just isn't spectacular.. at all. There are many options in the vicinity, so there's no need to go back."
Vincent C.,"Santa Ana, CA",26,14,24,4.0,2/8/2012,"Carmel chicken was fantastic with brown rice, and carrots and snow peas instead of mushrooms. Easily shared between two people. The salsbury steak looked delicious, with red mashed potatoes and green beans. The classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries was outstanding. Just get there early, nothing worse than waiting for a table and to be starving. Also they only take reservations between 230pm and 530 pm for groups of 7 or more. Cheesecake Factory Anahiem, Ca."
