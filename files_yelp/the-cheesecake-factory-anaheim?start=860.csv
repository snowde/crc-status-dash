Tracy A.,"Fullerton, CA",177,30,9,4.0,2/6/2012,"Wanted to come back here to try their famous jambalaya ever since I saw it on the food network lol. They made it seem sooo good on tv but when I ordered it, it was just another typical pasta since it has linguini noodles instead of rice. Overall I the place is great but just too expensive for me. Oh btw try the fried mac n cheese! It's the best I've ever had!"
Melvin G.,"Garden Grove, CA",135,119,4,3.0,2/4/2012,"gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt so giving it 3 although it could make a 4 so why does this place get the 3 stars, well on so many levels they achieve to be fine dining and great service but what puts cheesecake factory in the 3 star range  is it does not achieve a fine dining type of food. in many respect they make great appetizers i won't lie, but they they door a less than decent job to what i expect from them when it came to entrees. Sheppard's pie - looked great - tasted great. til you eat the vegetables and some of the beef, it was just so saute with sauce in some parts and other parts would be so bland i don't now if this was done wrong but my friends say it taste like that all the time Cheesecake has also been a hit or a miss honestly they makr great regular cheesecakes but at other times the othercheesecakes it taste so unflavorful  all in all its good but not worth goin often or anything like that"
Sarina A.,"West Covina, CA",667,550,194,5.0,2/1/2009,"I have a confession to make. I contemplated giving this place 1 star ONLY because I love it here so much and I want less people to go so the waiting time would diminish somewhat. HAHAHA But I just couldn't lie on my yelp review.  I don't know why this particular location is gettting mediocre reviews. I've been here a few times and have always had fabulous service and even more fabulous food. They have a WIDE selection of food. I mean if you cannot find at least one item you like, I'll be pretty surprised. And of course, their cheesecakes are to die for. My personal favorite is Dulce de Leche cheesecake. My b oyfriend tried it for the first time and loved it! If you come during peak times, yes you will have to wait for a table. It's freak'n Cheesecake Factory people! So try and come during non-peak times. We have gone around 11:30am (right before the lunch rush) and we have come around 6:30pm (right before the dinner rush) and have never had to wait a single minute for a table.  The seating outside is lovely. It's great to people watch. And for those chilly wintery days, they have tons of heating lamps so you won't get that cold.  It's a pretty big restaurant with big portions and large array of choices. You can't go wrong here!"
nancy r.,"Anaheim, CA",117,269,52,3.0,2/12/2009,"Came back because my friend wanted cheesecake. Since our first visit was a disaster we decided to go to the bar. The bartenders immediately got us waters which was incredible considering our server last time took fifteen minutes.  Ordered calamari and had TJ's pink lemonade which consists of vodka, chambord, and freshly squeezed lemonade with a sugar rim. it was absolutely delicious and went well with the calamari.  Finished it off with dessert of course and had their brownie fudge cheesecake.  I would only go to cheesecake factory  through the bar because they were extremely helpful and patient. Props to the bartenders!1"
Eric L.,"San Diego, CA",463,466,145,4.0,6/1/2009,"It's cheesecake factory.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious.  So I'll rate the service and ambiance. Service: 4-star.  They messed up one person's order and we sent it back.  within 2 minutes, the manager came by and apologized and offered that person a complimentary soup or salad and slice of cheesecake.  After he declined, he offered everyone at the table the same thing.  Something went wrong, they made it right.   However, we did wait a long time for our food.  Longer than normal.  This time, it didn't seem like too long because we were people watching since it was prom season and there were train wrecks left and right of girls' dresses.  Some of the dresses made me cringe. Ambiance: 3-star It's a cheesecake.  It's the same as always with the large pillars, same tables, same glass window into the kitchen.  Nothing really set it apart.  The location makes it nice though because it give you an affordable place to eat a lot of food near the Disneyland Resort."
Jonathan M.,"San Francisco, CA",160,55,18,4.0,1/17/2010,"This is one of the better cheesecake factory's I've been too. The food was good, the service is on point and the validate parking for free. It's close to DIsneyland and open until 12am. I came here a few years back when it first open the food and service was on point too."
Alicia C.,"Anaheim, CA",343,290,101,4.0,1/9/2009,Came here after a late night  at Disneyland looking for something satisfying and especially something sweet! Definitely try their Cafe Mocha and the White Chocolate Caramel Macademia Nut cheesecake together!!!!   I promise you will love me for the rest of your life! =)
Catherine M.,"Orange, CA",42,236,7,4.0,1/2/2010,For some reason I can't resist cheesecake factory.  Every location i've tried has never failed. I guess that is why the lines are always so long.  The new red velvet cheesecake is a must try.   My usual order is the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp or the Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp dish.  We're always down to try new cheesecake flavors for dinner. How can you resist.
Silja J.,"Victoria, Canada",27,33,5,4.0,3/6/2009,"Usually I try not to give four stars to a chain like this, but they are consistently friendly, have a huge menu, large portion sizes (my husband and I usually share everything), they are open pretty late, they have a fantastic pineapple mojito, parking is easy and free, their prices are pretty reasonable (especially relative to portion), I've never had to wait more than five minutes to get a table, they don't care if you stay for hours and hours, and they seem to accommodate groups without sweating it.  They have a great selection of tasty salads, and are willing to change the dish to make it meatless.  The ambiance includes nicely low-lit lighting with high ceilings and quirky art (sadly the same as every other cheesecake restaurant). ... my complaints are that it is usually very loud, and that the quality of entrees doesn't even come close to being in the same category as either Roy's or Mccormicks a few doors down.... but  for me, the other facets of the establishment help to counter that.... not for my husband though, who values food more highly than I do:)"
Justin C.,"Pomona, CA",7,11,1,5.0,10/24/2012,Came here the first time after I was getting tatted down the street valet got my car I walked in and let me say this is a big place nice fancy the lighting is dim witch is nice I was seated looked at the menu and let me say there is a wide selection of everything so I order the steak mash potatoes and fried macaroni balls let me say this was one of the best steaks I have eaten the service was great and of corse I had to order cheese cake got a slice of Oreo man it was delicious I recommend to all grate place and location next To Disney land
J V.,"Portland, OR",61,179,46,2.0,2/18/2009,"Not a big fan of this restaurant as a hole. When this place opened up down the street of me, I was happy to have a new chain in town. The garden walk seemed like a good idea. (Is it or isnt it? I havent decided yet.) Anyhow, one of the waiters there really gets on my nerves. He acts overly polite, and treats you like a child. He f'd up on a lunch portion price and insisted he was in the right. Had to get the manager involved to put him in his place. The manager came over and simply apologized. We're not snotty about things, we just want to be charged for the right portion ordered, even though we made sure that it was the right portion after thinking it was a bit big.  Their menu is too big. No real specialties, and it all tastes frozen. Boo to you Mr. Cheesecake factory."
Veronica V.,"Phoenix, AZ",56,101,124,5.0,2/27/2013,"I'm a fan of cheesecake factory all around so it is a name I'm familiar with. Trying this one though in Gardenwalk was a little tricky you want to get there before lunch & dinner rushes and you have to park in garage to get there but it's free so that is convenient. So let's jump into the food my favorite part. Our first trip I had pizza and salad which was ok the veggies on it were bland and it could've used a lil olive oil n seasonings. I picked @ my kids chicken tender meal, yummo. My husband had pasta the usual he always asks for a mixture of alfredo and tomato to be mixed, he's a chef. He likes what he likes. Next visit me n the hubby shared I forget the name but it was a giant plate of chicken strips and mashed potatoes. It was filling! My daughter had the cuban sandwhich and the meat was absolutely tender. The other kids split a club sandwich which is no regular sandwich here, huge, served with fries. I can safely say you aren't going here to have a salad. What fun is that?"
Katelyn A.,"Anaheim, CA",96,90,129,4.0,1/24/2012,"My sons love the grill cheese sandwitch, this place is kids friendly, it gets packed after 5. Waits is about 30 to 40 mins, great portion, our waitress, was very friendly came around often to ask how food was if we needed anything, It was great."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,2.0,1/2/2009,"This location is very large, looks pretty nice, and isn't as dark as the other locations, so it's easy on the eyes. They don't offer curbside; you're going to have to park in the parking structure (2 hours free, 3 with validation), go down, and pick up your take-out. The cashier at the bakery (where you pick up take-out) didn't acknowledge me until a few minutes later, even though I was standing right in front of him. Otherwise, he was friendly and accommodating -- except when I was paying and I put my bills ON my purse (not on the counter in front of him), since I was trying to find the right amount of change. He reached over to my purse and picked up my bills as if I was done counting my money. Rude. It wasn't until after we got into the car did we also realize he didn't give us any knives to cut the chicken steak we ordered. Okay... I guess we'll just have to cut it up with the excessive amount of spoons you gave us. As for the food, the Da Vinci Pasta was sort of bland and the only flavor you you could taste were the onions. The Chicken Costaletta was really delicious. Black-out cake was alright, not as good as the one located at the Santa Anita mall."
Stephanie R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",130,234,44,4.0,11/20/2009,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory, you have completely and utterly surprised me.  Let me back up... before last night, I was ignorantly against their generic facade, even though I had never stepped foot into their fine establishment.  Flash forward to last night...  ""So... where should we eat?"" My best friend asks after a long day at Disneyland.  ""Oh, I don't know... let's Yelp something."" I say tapping the screen of my phone, trying to preempt my phone's Internet browser.  ""Darn it... no juice in my phone... how about you?"" I say.  "" Oh man, Disneyland days I just don't bring my phone... as a way to kind of escape.""  ""Gotcha... well ... where to?""  ""Cheesecake Factory?"" My friend says.  ""I guess"" I reply.  Well, boy am I glad my friend suggested that because I had an amazing meal here!  We started off with the fried Macaroni and cheese. A must when eating here! It was seasoned perfectly and was served with a tomato based sauce... very good.  For my entree, I had the Meatloaf and mashed potatoes which were delicious and reasonably priced ($14.95.) The dish was so big, I got 2 delicious meals out of it.  For dessert, we shared the Strawberry short cake. And this is what got the cheesecake factory their 4 stars. This dessert... WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! They don't mess around here... they built a beautiful pyramid of Vanilla ice cream, pillow-y short bread, fresh strawberries and clouds of whipped cream. I was in hog heaven!  Tip: If you are coming here after a long day at Disneyland, consider leaving the park alittle early to ensure you get a table without having to wait too long."
Alejandra P.,"Long Beach, CA",51,34,19,4.0,2/6/2012,"so I went here for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend and I loved it! for starters they sat us all in way in the back in a small booth and there were some stuff we didn't like, like for example it was a little more dimmer that the rest of the restaurant because the light above us didn't work and we got sat down under the AC. But we asked to be moved and we got moved right away. The waiters were all very nice and polite and out side was very romantic. The food was delicious! Now, I paid about $60 but that's because we ordered too much food. But the overall experience it was great! :)"
Daniel P.,"Beaverton, OR",13,84,58,5.0,1/28/2010,"I was down in Anaheim for a week and next to my hotel was the cheesecake factory. One night I went somewhere else and I regretted it, every other night I just ended up going here. I love love love loved the place. The food was very good for the price, I tried a different meal each night and enjoyed most of them (i got sick and my taste buds suffered). Overall, considering everything else in the area, it was great having someplace so reliable nearby."
krystie b.,"Hillsboro, OR",15,63,,3.0,1/22/2010,"I love to hate this place. I used to work for the joint in a different location years ago. I know how the intense detail the food staff have to know, and the amount of work that goes into this place. That said, I only order salads.  Every pasta dish has a stick of butter, anything with creme makes my stomach hurt. The food is so rich, and so heavy that I never have room for cheese cake, which in fact is what they're known for, yes?  So i'm basing this review on the only dish i ever get. The BBQ chicken chop salad and the lime cheese cake. Both you can't go wrong with. Both are delish. Service is normally always really good."
Lehasa M.,"Oakland, CA",47,140,3,4.0,7/5/2011,"For many years I stayed away from all cheesecake factories because of past poor service and mediocre food. Last night, my old lady's hankering for cheesecake brought into the gardenwalk location and changed that! Excellent service, no wait, and  even a good dish in the bistro shrimp pasta. Because it's a chain, I still won't give it more than 4. And for some silly reason it was dark in there. It wasn't romantic ambiance, it was just creepy."
Angel K.,"Orange, CA",0,130,166,3.0,4/13/2009,"This place closes at 12am.  Park in GardenWalk (complex name) garage (Entrance on Katella) and get validation. First three hours of parking is FREE. Sweet Corn tamale cake $9 -same as El Torito sweet corn cake...YUM!!! Corn Fritter: A little bland but nice textures. Old Fashion Burger w/ Fries $9- patty is small. Better at In-N-Out. Grilled Mahi mahi w/ fries $20- Fish was overcooked and boring. Broccoli needed more steaming and seasoning, fries are fries. ME :  Shrimp Scampi and Diane Steak(spelling)  $20 substitute mash Potatoes for snow peas-First time I had shrimp scampi where the 4 shrimp were fried. Steak was odd, instead of a nice big piece of steak it was 4-5 cubes of meat.  They were cooked perfectly though, a little crunchy crust peppery crust and then pink-red juicy on the inside, laying in a bath of steak juices (forgot the name). Would have been better if it were one nice piece of steak instead of mini ones.  Snow Peas with veggie stir fry was sad, way too salty and some had the hard stem still attached. ENDING: To full for cheesecake so decided on something lighter ( so we thought). I was contemplating between strawberry short cake and the lemoncelle; yellow cake layered with lemon marscapone top with strawberry.  Waitress recommended strawberry shortcake out of the two. Strawberry Shortcake $7?......Take me back. It was hugest strawberry shortcake I've ever seen. With the three of us (other two in our party were sadly diabetic; didn't stop us) we barely managed to finish it.. So it looked like this: about 1/2 quart (4scoops) of rich and creamy vanilla ice Cream sandwiched between two perfectly warm, slightly salty (balanced the sweetness) huge, golden yellow shortcakes with about 1/2 foot tall mountain of whipped cream (fiancee loves it) and then...then the strawberry of all strawberries, perfectly glazed and sliced, stuffed all the free roaming space between the sandwich and plate's lip. (Or it was sooo sinfully delicious that my mind is warping the size of it all.)   It was the highlight of my night...or week.  Besides for the unnecessary over sized plate for tiny amount of food...Super clean, Super friendly, super attentive...super yummy strawberry shortcake...hehe!"
