Nat O.,"Corona, CA",7,81,,3.0,12/18/2009,"My friends and I went here for my birthday a few weeks ago.  I had delicious salmon with potatoes.  It must have been their specials because I cannot really find it on their menu. Great company and atmosphere.  However, as I recall a few years ago that I had another birthday dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at Rancho Cucamonga.  They gave me a slice of cheesecake for my birthday.  Well, at this location, I only got a small, not even a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the same amount of whipped cream on top!  Well, I guess we are in recession!!"
Vanessa P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,65,15,4.0,3/21/2012,"I really like the location of this cheesecake factory, right by Disneyland:) I went for dinner yesterday and there were people waiting but since we weren't too picky about sitting outside we got to be seated right away. It wasn't too cold, but once it started getting darker my mom wanted the heater on and  one of the servers was really nice about it and turned it on for us. Our waitress was super nice and always came back. I hate it when they serve you and then the waitress disappears, I looooove their strawberry lemonade and needed my refills, so I'm glad she kept coming back :) Their bread is sooooo good too I honestly can get full just from their bread that they give you at the beginning. Oh and our waitress brought it out almost as soon as we sat down because she wanted to make sure we got some before it ran out. How sweet of her.  So I ordered the Caramel chicken and shared it with my mom. Portions are hugeee here and like I said, I love the bread lol. I was full without eating much of my main entree. Goodness.. was I full!!! Good thing my mom was helping me out. My brothers were able to finish most of their food as well. I was the only one to get cheesecake... lol. But I ordered it to go and ate some later :) It was 4 of us and to our surprise it only came up to $67 we thought it was gonna be well over $100. Yay! Great experience :)"
Gary Royale T.,"Orange, CA",990,346,107,3.0,3/17/2009,"This place still makes your wildest cheesecake and chocolate fantasies come true. A big girl's paradise. When you work out and watch what you eat, sometimes you just gotta reward yourself with a good splurge. There is no better place to get the job done then here.  My opinion regarding the regular dinner items still remains the same. I would stay away from it. But there is nothing wrong with having a cheesecake before you go in to a night of dancing your ass off at Heat. Vodka shots with cheesecake does mix well and keeps you feeling good.   I ordered a Godiva cheesecake from here and I would say its an orgy with Beyonce and Megan Fox. Once you see the plate land on your table, you will hold no prisoners and just dive right in.  I almost feel like I need to light a cigarette on the way out of that place. Anyway, the experience was good while it lasted. I can't wait for the next time. Maybe I would go for the Lindsey Lohan special if they have such a thing... PS. Don't forget to validate your parking passes on the way out."
Robin J.,"West Covina, CA",456,95,1,3.0,12/27/2011,not the best cheesecakes... lots of flies and poor service. Go to Mortons next door instead :)
Amy L.,"Newport Coast, CA",2,29,54,2.0,12/21/2013,"what's better than going to dinner then making a stop at downtown disney, especially during holiday season? absolutely NOTHING. this restaurant is my go-to during the holiday season. i've always experienced DECENT (notice i didn't state satisfactory) service. yes, i understand that it is busy and such with the location being so CLOSE to disneyland.... UNDERSTANDABLE. this is definitely not MY go-to restaurant for a dinner date.. but i go here often enough to know that the bread is COMPLIMENTARY. can someone please explain to me why the server told me that the bread is extra? do you expect me to chew on my finger nails as i wait for my food? no, thanks. i did, however, enjoy sipping my water as i waited for my meal. by the way, that extra money you were about to charge me for complimentary bread? it was taken out of your tip, sorry NOT sorry. (i didnt care enough to pay attention to the server's name.. reason why i didnt state it)"
Marty M.,"Redlands, CA",6,86,38,4.0,2/10/2012,Wow what a $5.00 Happy Hour! Long Island? Crab/Artichoke?  Crab Pot Stickers? Fantastic.! Beautiful atmosphere. 3-6:30 happy hour. Yumm
Nancy L.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,400,663,4.0,6/14/2009,"Hostage Gastronome was willing to spring for Roy's as our farewell to Anaheim Sports Center across the freeway after five years of sometimes 10 hr. days of club volleyball tournaments.  Unfortunately they only open for dinner, so we ended up at Cheesecake Factory again, and I almost ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps again.  Luckily I Yelp, so when I saw a Cuban sandwich on the menu, the beginnings of a ""Fresh List"" started to germinate in my head.  Good news for you and me - it was delicious, and I don't even like pickles!  It wasn't ""pressed"", but it had been toasted in a pan with probably too much butter.  I have to give it just under 4 stars for greasiness. That Sunday the restaurant was sunny and lightly inhabited; I noticed the generous stroller parking, but was glad we missed the actual occupants.  I guess I admire parents who would walk an extra mile for a sanity break away from Disneyland.  Maybe I should have seen what they are like, because that is certainly not me - I can outlast any of my kids at D-land and will push the limits of HG's, in this case Hostage Park Hopper's, patience. Four stars overall for Cheesecake Factory based on their bread and  their corporate sameness being at least on a grand and opulent scale."
Baikal P.,"Anaheim, CA",150,39,12,4.0,10/5/2013,it's alright like as the other cheese cakes
Mariel C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,162,20,2.0,8/5/2008,"Okay, under normal circumstances, I would give Cheesecake Factory 3 or 4 stars......but this location, or maybe just this experience, rubbed me the wrong way.  --Since it is next to Disneyland, expect to be surrounded by screaming bratty children, running amok because their parents are too exhausted to discipline them. I usually bank on Cheesecake Factory NOT being loaded with kids. --Service was super slow. It took for ever, to get water drinks...we had to ask twice to get bread...and straws.  --Once we ordered, I got my order pretty quickly.....but about 10 - 15 minutes before everyone else's meals. I was waiting for everyone but after about 8 minutes, I started eating because my food was getting cold.  --Boyfriend ordered his burger well done....it came out barely medium.  He sent it back, and when his new burger came out (when everyone else was already done eating, mind you) It was not only well done, but CREAMATED.  --Our waitress was overall inattentive. No where to be found most of the time.  Maybe they were just having an off night. But for the amount you pay at What saved this from getting a one star rating was that my meal (California Cheese Steak Sandwich) was actually pretty good.  Cheesecake factory, I don't know if I feel like giving them another chance. I'll stick to the Bella Terra (Huntington Beach) location instead."
Dr. J.,"Placentia, CA",84,90,122,2.0,7/11/2011,"We came here for my dad's bday and it was awful!! The service was sooooo slow!! The food was ok but it took us 20 min to be seated, 45 min for our food to come after we ordered, and we had to tell them 3 times that it was his bday for us to get a dinky little bday song w/ 2 servers singing, and then we had to wait another 15 to get out check after we hunted down a THIRD server because our initial server went on break without telling us and the second server f-ed it up... All in all it was a disappointing bday for my father who had been out of the country for 2 wks and was looking forward to celebrating his bday with the family.. For it being in a highly frequented touristy area, the service was just bad... It'll be awhile before I go back to a cheesecake factory but I'm definitely staying away from this one..."
Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487,2.0,5/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites no matter if we are in Denver or Hawaii- with that said I am leaving and I think THIS Cheesecake Factory can really kiss off right now. Sixteen of us, they hand us our bills, ask us if everything is correct and I notice my salad is $2.50 more? I had told the waitress to make sure I had blue cheese in my salad because the last few times I have ordered it there hasn't been too much- well I get the chopped salad and the works pizza and have a ton of leftovers and I have not had any complaints really . Well that stupid charge they put on was for 'extra' blue cheese' and the waitress said 'sorry, that's for extra cheese'  and she did not offer to take it off even after asking all of us if the bill was correct. So I asked the lady manager that seated us and I got the same reply, 'oh I'm sorry, yes we do charge for proteins and such' okay wow Chresecake, you are kidding right? Ha ha, our lunch planned with 12 of us tomorrow is going elsewhere- it's just the principle, we spend a lot of money and always choose this restaurant everywhere we go. I am officially putting on my no go list for the meantime. I absolutely hate the nickel and dime BS- we travel all the time, have a huge family all over the Country, and even at home, we eat out all the time. I do not expect anything for free, but I like to know if there is an additional charge for items- oh yeah, I just wanted to have blue cheese on my salad that says blue cheese- Whatever- I am over it and I just don't want to be aggravated when I leave over $2 when we dropped over $350. Nothing is more irritating-"
Erin N.,"San Pedro, CA",156,223,55,3.0,10/7/2008,"So we drove out for a friend's surprise birthday dinner. . . and wow. This place is running amuck with families who reek of disneyland. A friend had gotten there an hour and a half before our meeting time and was still in line 10 minutes before the birthday boy showed.  PACKED on a sunday night at 730? really?  The food was good but I'm not sure how much of that was attributable to the restaurant or me. I got some bow tie pasta with caramelized onion, peas and chicken. It was good. The dinner salad was okay. The guacamole was good, but the chips were terribly stale and /or over fried. The service was downright terrible... my friend ordered coffee which showed up 45 minutes after she asked for it with no cream or sugar. That took an extra 10 minutes. Same friend's shrimp tasted soapy and so they comp'd the entire meal. Still, I'm sure she'd rather have been able to enjoy the shrimp than get free pasta. Either way, the food was good but then again all Cheesecake Factories are identical to me... except this one reminded me of an estate not a restaurant."
Family V.,"Inverness, FL",0,45,,2.0,2/25/2012,Our first try...but very disappointed. Quality of thon very poor and not hot by arrival.  Very friendly waiter...but that's not enough.
Igor V.,"Richboro, PA",1,45,1,4.0,12/29/2013,"Good food and very good and cheery service.  The children menu has a wide variety and they made every effort to accommodate food allergy.  The low-fat menu has a good variety of choices, especially in the appetizers section.  Was very pleased to find grilled artichokes on their menu.  Red velvet cheesecake was delicious. They get very busy after 6:30 pm on weekends though."
Chad C.,"San Diego, CA",10,4,,5.0,2/19/2010,Our family loves this place.  We especially like the sweet corn tamale appetizer and the raspberry cheesecake.   I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta tonight and it was one of the best dishes I have had.  It was pretty spicy but just right for my taste.
Dexter S.,"Panorama City, CA",72,26,20,4.0,3/19/2011,"First off I've been to a few other cheesecake factories. But me and my girl friend decided to come here despite other neighboring restaurants. The place was busy but we were able to be seated within 5mins. Our waiter Cornell was one of the best waiters I've  ever had. He predicted continents we needed before we even asked and he never let our drinks go empty, which was the strawberry lemonade. Which I recommend.  The food come in large portions so make sure your hungry or else your going to be going home with a ""to go box"". This place is great to have dinner after a long day at Disneyland which is a 10 min walk. Tasty food and good service means 4 stars for me."
Manuel G.,"Alpine, CA",6,59,1,1.0,10/19/2013,"Pre-ordered a cheesecake and they messed up the date so it was frozen. They did nothing to make up for it, and when I asked that they give me slices of the defrosted cheesecake they did have, they said they couldn't do that. They checked with the manager, and he sent word that it should be fine - it was not. I think I'll pre-order a cake and not pick it up."
Amber T.,"Garden Grove, CA",15,11,2,4.0,2/21/2011,"Being that I work there, my opinion is a little bias, but nonetheless I have visited surrounding Cheesecake Factory's and none have compared to this Cheesecake in Anaheim. From the detail of the restaurant's decoration to the welcoming smiles that surround you while you're dining, when you're there it's not like you're just dining at any restaurant, it's a special experience that keeps you wanting to come back for more (even though you don't have room for any extra meals because the proportions are already so large)."
William S.,"Milpitas, CA",747,350,52,3.0,8/27/2011,"I'm not too much of a cheese factory person. Although their food is pretty good and a wide range of variety. I still can seem to rate this better than 3 stars. The wifey likes this place and we manage to come here when we can. It does get pretty expensive though so we don't come here often. It just doesn't seem like a good mix when an OK taste bud pleasing place is combined with a place that can get really pricey. Eeehhh....if you go to any other Cheesecake Factory, they're all the same and you'll expect same stuff at any place."
Miguel G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,1,5.0,2/1/2012,One of the best places to eat with friends I'm about like 10min away from the Gardenwalk. We come here from time to time. My go to burger is the BBQ Bacon Burger. My mouth cannot open wide enough to take a bite out of this monster! It's really delicious and it fills you up. One of the reasons I like Cheesecake Factory is cuz of their ginormous portions and fair prices. They got a variety of food and drinks. I recommend this to anybody who likes food basically. The waiters are extremely nice and are not always in  a rush like other places. They got fast services what customer doesn't want that?!
