Roxy A.,"Chicago, IL",690,369,396,4.0,10/11/2008,"Although this place is a pretty touristy location at the Anaheim Gardenwalk, I've had a pretty good experience during the two times that I've been here so far. First time, met up w/ a friend for lunch...definitely reccomend ordering the lunch miso salmon...soo tasty, and the perfect portion for a fair price. =) The last time I went here was after another day at Disneyland w/ the boyfriend for dinner, we thought we would have to wait at least 30-40 mins. considering the crowds that were waiting outside..but we got seated within 10-15 mins...probably cus it was just the two of us. The service was great..kinda funny cuz' we sorta felt like tourists cuz' most of the people that come here for dinner are from out of town! haha I usually stay away from ordering the pasta b/c I remember not enjoying the pasta da vinci before..but I decided to try the bistro shrimp pasta...and it was really good! the shrimp is slightly breaded & has a lemon cream sauce w/ arugula, mushrooms, garlic, and some other veggies. It's a pretty massive portion too! For appetizers we ordered the roasted artichoke, it was pretty good, but nothing to go all crazy over. Ooh and when they bring bread to the table just ask for the brown bread..b/c it is awesome and waaay better than the sourdough....and if you got room for dessert, definitely order the tuxedo cheesecake!!! =)"

Mrs. J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,54,3,4.0,1/8/2014,"There are better locations, but for a good dinner after a long day at Disneyland, I'm a fan. Food is always good and consistent at any location."
Ric E.,"Irvine, CA",107,102,36,3.0,4/18/2011,Cheesecake factory is what it is. A chain restaurant. I never expect to much from it...so not to much to complain about. Service was mediocre. Hostess are always nice. I would go back..just know the food is going to be overpriced for what they serve.
Gina Q.,"Whittier, CA",17,705,136,3.0,5/23/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory and the cheesecake they serve. Their portions are really large and tasty. On this visit, we walked right in on a weekend evening and were seated immediately. That's usually uncalled for at a Cheesecake Factory. But hey, I was thanking my lucky stars.  The food was excellent as always as was the cheesecake. I ordered one of their half portion salads. This must be a new feature, plus they are now offering meals 500 calories or under (but I think they are mostly salads). Anyway, the one downer to our experience at Cheesecake Factory was our non-existant server. She showed up periodically and only when absolutely needed. We didn't feel like we were being attended to the way we should have.  But at the end of the evening, we took back to the hotel the Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Awesome!!!! I would totally get that again, even though it means it's a Weight Watchers points busting dining experience."
Frank G.,"Waldorf, MD",630,138,543,4.0,2/23/2011,"Never disappoints!   This location has a great location at Garden walk just blocks from the gates of Disneyland.  The inside is as grand as any I have seen.  Ample seating and lots of action from the bar to the servers racing with hot dishes from kitchen to tables.  However, you are taken care of like you are the only one in the room. For a frequent Cheesecake Factory diner, I have learned to expect;  a wait, because everyone loves good food.  So, the 30 minutes we had to wait wais a typical wait any day of the week. Great ambiance,  creating a fine dining experience. Great waiters/waitresses - their servers are always courteous and very knowledgeable about the menus and specials. Food service - surprisingly quick.  Always surprises me how fast the food arrives, even when filled to capacity.  Food - the portions are more than you need in one sitting.  I always have left overs, especially since I must have 2 appetizers - avocado egg rolls and the Ahi tuna tartar, my favorites.  Great variety and delicious. Price - well in the budget.  Dinner for two can easily happen under $60.  The cheesecake - the only problem I have with this wonderful restaurant.  I never order a desert after not being able to finish my meal.  Here, I have to always order a cheesecake to go.  These are from heaven. Don't miss out.   I am sure there is something on the menu that is not to my liking, I have just not found it. One of my favorite restaurants for a good meal at a great price."
Emily B.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,45,1,2.0,6/17/2011,I came to this cheesecake factory at around 10 for my little brothers graduation.  The wait was about 15 minutes long for a table outside on the patio.  Our waiter was nice but was MIA alot.  He took forever to take our order.  Our drinks came out when our dinner came which i found to be very annoying.  I ordered the bbq ranch salad which is usally my fav but it tasted different here ...not the good diff.  My sister in law ordered a side salad and buffulo wings and found a hair in her salad :(....not a big deal cuz they got her a new one but it was still kinda gross.  My grandmas dish didnt come out untill we all pretty much finished eating. I dont know what was going on that night cuz it really wasnt busy...im still a fan of the cheesecake factory but il be going to the one in brea instead.
Timothy C.,"Petaluma, CA",110,473,384,2.0,9/19/2010,"Um, well.. it's TCF, I'm kind of laissez faire about this place, it reminds me of Disneyland inside (not just because this one is nearby, all of them remind me of Disneyland for some reason), the food is ""okay"" but I have a feeling there is one BIG ASS microwave in the back, and the food is thrown together and cooked there... why is everything Denny's style greasy? And this is a shout-out to all CF's I have been to... Sorry... but you seem to be a bit tastier, and a little more expensive than the nearest Bob's Big Boy..."
Jay Y.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",240,808,1473,1.0,3/1/2010,"EPIC FAILURE!!!  I don't understand why people love this place so much. Not only this location, but every other location in general.  Anyway, the 12 of us came here for a birthday dinner and got seated immediately. - NO BUTTER: As soon as we got seated, we were given bread with NO BUTTER.  After asking for some, it came 5 minutes later.   - DIRTY STRAWS: Water was served WITHOUT any straws.  When we asked for straws, the server handed us the straws unwrapped and without a napkin with her DIRTY hands 5 minutes later. I ordered the Carne Asada Taco Platter.  As soon as my carne asada taco platter came, it wasn't even hot.  The carne asada didn't taste like carne asada. It tasted like someone else's returned plate of teriyaki beef and it was just reheated and cut up into pieces.  GROSS. It was way too sweet for something you call ""Carne Asada"".  Another girl in the table ordered something ""similar"" to my dish but her plate had Guacamole, Sour Cream, and salsa.  I asked the server why mine didn't have that and she said "" Because you have a different order"".  I replied and said ""So carne asada tacos don't come with sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo""? She said ""Hold on..."" and ran off.  She came back moments later and gave me a HOT PLATE of sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo. So she comes out and brings a HOT PLATE of perishable condiments.  Who does that? Hmm.. maybe just her.   ***DURING this time, it was approximately 25 minutes later and my friend across me still didn't get her egg rolls.*** I asked the server ""Why is my sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo on a HOT plate?""  I was soooo upset and she was going to take it back but I told her to leave it alone.  The manager came by, apologized and brought a cold plate and I told him ""It's too late.""  By that time, I lost my appetite and left my food as it was.  By the way, the friend who got her tofu egg rolls only took ONE bite and didn't eat the rest of her food. Her friend who was sitting next to her didn't even get dressing on his salad. People who work here are not only DENSER than a rock, but really unsanitary and lack common knowledge.  This is definitely management's fault for not training their employees.  It's no wonder The Cheesecake Factory is no longer as busy as it used to be."
Aimee M.,"Tacoma, WA",43,224,62,2.0,2/5/2009,"What is the hype??  I was not impressed with anything here.   #1 Overpriced! #2 Tasteless and confusing cuisine..... #3 My cheesecake is the BOMB!  I can't believe they charge so much for a         piece of sub-par cheesecake. #4 Service sucked! Sorry folks, but I would not visit this place again."
Joanna K.,"Anaheim, CA",5,7,2,1.0,9/18/2012,"Terrible. ALWAYS terrible. I only come here for lunch outings with coworkers, and it always disappoints. Today I had the fetucinni with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. The flavor was bland and the chicken was rubbery. It must be the cheesecake that keeps this place in business, because the food is terrible and insanely high in calories and sodium. They need to narrow down their 21 page menu and focus on making fewer dishes at a higher quality."
Chung H.,"New York, NY",5,16,,4.0,9/14/2009,"I went there with my friend after smashing some golf balls in Sunday afternoon. I ordered the Famous Cheesecake Meatloaf, and I still love it. They serve meals fast and our waiter is very friendly and helpful. The meal is decent and the strawberry lemonade is pretty cool~~ Oh by the way, they do not take reservation unless you have a group of 7. And parking is easy and they do have validation for 3 hours, which is pretty good deal too^^ The parking is located next to the Anaheim Garden, a parking structure. And it's great to take a walk after a lux dinner~~"
Sam B.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,26,,4.0,9/11/2011,"Our hotel was in walking distance to this restaurant and shopping center. This chain is one of my favorites! It's kind of your regular Cheesecake Factory experience, but I'm usually satisfied! My fiancé got the Lemon Chicken dish for the first time and it was SO GOOD. I got the chicken salad sandwich again and it was DELICIOUS. I will come to the Factory again there is no doubt about it."
Heather B.,"La Habra, CA",90,361,12,4.0,12/13/2010,"I have never had a bad meal here.  It's in a fun location and on a nice summer night, sitting out on the patio gives you the feeling of being on vacation, even if you live 5 minutes away.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the wait to get a table is pretty long and when it's super crowded, the wait for your food can take awhile.  Also, a couple servers I've had haven't been too great.  But hands down, great food!"
Nancy P.,"Anaheim, CA",56,301,36,5.0,2/13/2012,"Now, I honestly have to say I love eating here. Everything I've had over the years has been really delicious. But, today I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Sandwich (in the burger section) and I had to write a review to tell you not to get it. It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't delicious. It was also extremely difficult to eat. The bun is all wrong for this type of veggie. I picked it up and everything slipped out the bottom. The eggplant was a little too al dente so I had to cut it with a knife to eat it. I liked the flavor but it would've been much better with feta cheese. It comes with garlic aioli on the bun but I asked for extra and I dipped the fries in it. So, yummy! Better than ranch dressing any day!. I got the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake for dessert and loved it. It is so tart and yummy that you just can't stop eating it.  I was bummed to find out that the add gratuity for 6 people, I thought is was only parties of 8 or more. Our waiter was so slow and we kept looking for him. FYI: My fav is the Carmel Chicken. If you're craving chinese food then order this. I do think it's weird that they call it Carmel Chicken because it doesn't taste like carmel at all. It taste like a crunchy sweet chicken but I don't get carmel at all. I always ask for red chili sauce so, I can get my spicy on. I love it!"
robert B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,87,,4.0,2/28/2013,"A wide ranging menu makes this a go to spot that satisfies everyone.  My particular favorite is the hamburger on the skinilicious menu.  How do they make a awesome burger and side salad for under 600 calories?  Who cares!  It is awesome and consistently good.  Only con is that the overall service varies from server to server, some visits it rates a 2 and others a 4 with the occasional 5."
Nancy C.,"Houston, TX",61,136,10,3.0,12/10/2010,"It's convention time: I love this place in any city and in Anaheim it is a great place to eat amongst all of the chains. The seating is fast at dinner time because you will be probably be lining up to eat at 5-6ish, depending on your time zone. Sit out in the evening, they have warm heaters. The drinks are pricey so I would get your dirty martini somewhere else or come for happy hour. The Louisana Chicken is my favorite, huge portion... not great to heat up if you are looking to reheat at the hotel. I would save room for cheesecake, specifically the brownie which is served warm."
Sasha K.,"Kailua, HI",1,29,,4.0,8/2/2011,"Our server, Alicia, was fantastic! Our party of 4 was seated outdoors for dinner within 10 minutes on a busy Saturday night (after being told the wait was 25 minutes). When it started to rain before our dinner orders were taken, Alicia really made a huge effort to get us seated at an indoor table right away. She really made us feel like it was very important to her that we be comfortable. She transferred all our food and drinks to our new table flawlessly and continued to check on us even we were no longer in her service area. The food was delish and we are so happy we took our new server, eric's advice and tried the fresh banana cream cheesecake. It is a ""light"" way to end the evening without the typical heavy 1500-calorie slice of decadence we normally get. It's my new fave."
Jessica B.,"New Haven, CT",35,22,,4.0,2/17/2011,"Avocado egg rolls are so addicting! All the portions here are giant, so I always plan on sharing or eating leftovers for lunch the next day."
Larry L.,"Culver City, CA",57,136,1,4.0,11/28/2010,"I don't usually write reviews for chains like Cheesecake.  Generally, CF is pretty good no matter where you go so writing a review for them doesn't really make sense.  But I did want to highlight some excellent service.  The Anaheim one is top notch!  Not just for my wife and I but they were extra great with our daughter as well.  Thanks!!!"
