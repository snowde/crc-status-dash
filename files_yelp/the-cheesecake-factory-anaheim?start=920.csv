Mighty O.,"Cypress, CA",29,51,5,2.0,3/1/2010,"woohoo! 2 Meh reviews in a row. i'm on a roll. A group of us met up @ California Pizza for dinner, but changed our mind after they told us that there were going to be a half an hour wait. F that! I hate waiting. So we decided to go next door which is Cheese Cake Factory much to my dismay. Huh, I don't like you cheesecake fat factory. But the democratic judgment had over turned my vote count by 3 to 1 or was it Mob's rule. It's a nice trendy atmosphere for a quick bite but they could turn up the dimmer switch just a weee bit though. I don't mind seeing my companions' faces or what I'm eating.  The service was great; fast and diligent.  I ordered Shrimp Franchese.  And this was where i remember why i hate you Cheese Cake FATory.  If you're a Paula Deen fan, you will love this dish. There is a stick o butta in it. in fact, there might be enough butter here to bake a two-pound cake.  I just didn't have the courage or the right kind of stomach to finish it.  maybe it's just me, other people seem to enjoy their food. I just don't like ""stick o butta"" in my food."

Joshua L.,"Orange County, CA",361,977,93,3.0,8/11/2010,Ate here last night.  Been a while since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Had a good experience.  The bartender was good.  Made my Belvadier Martini ice cold.  The service was decent and the food was good.  Nothing specialy really but you get what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  Reliable quality food and good service with a nice ambiance.
Leah M.,"Santa Ana, CA",48,6,,1.0,8/19/2012,"Went here on a double date and all of our food was not very good. First, our waitress wasn't very pleasant but more so seemed that the restaurant industry wasn't where she belonged. My fiancé ordered the salmon and shrimp scampi that was a huge plate of mashed potatoes, a couple shrimp and a small piece of salmon. Friend ordered the Cajun pasta that was bland, her boyfriend ordered the shepherds pie which was extremely salty and he commented that it was the gravy. The waitress wasn't very nice when we told her and then she asked with an attitude, ""well, what do you want me to do then?!"". She then got the manager and as my friends bf was explaining the saltiness, the manager interrupted and said ""it's the gravy that's salty."" So the manager new that it was salty and they still served it and if he knows that already then it's an on going problem. My friends bf ordered what I got, the gumbo. His came out as I was finishing and they looked nothing alike. I had there jambalaya before and it was good, but wanted to try the gumbo for its broth. I had substituted the rice for linguini in the gumbo and it was good but not enough shrimp and the andouille sausage was grounded almost instead of nice, plump round pieces. We all noticed the gumbo dishes didn't look the same; his was a nice red broth and mine wasn't even the same color, so we all came to the conclusion that I had received the jambalaya. What a shame that the only thing that was great was the free bread, the avocado egg roles and they didn't charge for the shepherds pie or the second order of ""gumbo""."
Julie M.,"Lahaina, HI",39,181,16,4.0,8/8/2010,"After being ripped off on Disney property it was refreshing to eat at the ever reliable Cheesecake Factory. I know it's a chain, but the quality is pretty consistant and the prices fair. The large menu makes it easy for everyone in a large party to find something that appeals to them. My lemon drop martini was perfect as usual (I have the recipe YUM) The  small plates menu is a nice addition to the menu. I had a lovely Cashew Chicken Salad and my spousal unit had the tasty and hearty Shepherds Pie. Topped it off with Adams Peanut Butter Cheesecake along with a nice cup of coffee. I've arrived at the Happiest Place on Earth!"
Trevor P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",28,73,8,4.0,9/10/2013,"Very nice waitress. Great Ahi salad. For a chain, Cheesecake Factory is very consistent."
Si O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,328,3,3.0,1/4/2011,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory feels like your entering a Prince of Persia movie set. But the food isn't very Mediterranean, its more Asian influenced. The food is very salty. We had the Thai Chicken pasta with spaghetti noodles, Chinese salad, and the miso salmon. The salad is huge, enough for two people. I would come here for the cheesecake. I had the regular cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Man! It is very good. The whipped cream they put on it is almost better than the cheesecake."
Rachel K.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,45,,4.0,8/11/2013,"We came here about an hour before they closed since not much else was open, and we didn't feel rushed or unwelcome at all. Some of the food wasn't all that fresh by that point, but what we got was still pretty good. We'll be back on our next visit to the area!"
Jessica G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",297,4,,5.0,8/8/2013,"I highly recommend this restaurant! Absolutely amazing food, great service, and friendly, very helpful hostesses. I never have any complaints about my dinner at all. I almost always order the chipotle pasta and it is always what i expect! The barbecue chicken salad is also one of my favorite dishes! This will probably always be one of my favorite restaurants to dine at! A great thank you to my server Leslie V! Such a doll!"
Norman A.,"Anaheim, CA",26,17,,4.0,4/1/2011,"excellent place if you dont know what to eat and if your really hungry, they have everything. Red velvet cheesecake FTW"
Leslie M.,"Arlington, VA",31,21,,4.0,7/29/2013,"Okay. A chain restaurant, right? Right outside the gates of Disney Land, I was thinking ""oye, this is going to be a treat"" Tourists only there for a few days will probably go there once...so the staff doesn't have to worry about stellar service...WRONG! I love this place, they are delightful! Servers are fast, courteous, ever smiling group that ""Wows"" me every time! And the ladies in the reception area? Fabulous! The place is always packed but I have always been seated within twenty minutes. Honestly, we come here again and again because its so enjoyable! I live in Los Angeles and was here for a month while receiving medical treatments. We still go back there at least once a week for dinner. The only thing I have an issue with is how they make the hostesses go back and squeegie the water off of the marble counter tops in the ladies room. Really? They come to work looking beautiful, elegant, nicely dressed, and they make them clean. Me thinks that is very cheesy of the cheesecake factory. I'm sure they have enough profit to hire people to stay on top of the cleaning who are not required to dress in a way thats not conducive to their duty. Plus it just seems strange to see a hostess cleaning up in the ladies room. They lose a star for that!"
C.C. G.,"Anaheim, CA",203,7,1,4.0,1/27/2011,"My friend and I actually didn't get cheesecake this time because the pasta was so filling. But the food and service was GREAT as usual, and the restaurant decor is GORGEOUS. I would say the menu is fairly priced. Perfect for a date or nice family dinner  :)"
Bryan N.,"Memphis, TN",26,100,8,3.0,8/14/2010,"The food they serve is good, as it is with all Cheesecake Factory-s. This particular restaurant has inflated prices, however, due to it's proximity to the Disney theme park. Don't expect to get the same prices as from your neighborhood Cheesecake factory here."
Mary Ann R.,"Kapaa, HI",0,2,,5.0,5/8/2013,"My family and I were on vacation and decided to eat here. Let me tell you, everything was delicious!!"
Josie Y.,"Lake Forest, CA",565,378,157,5.0,7/23/2010,"had the sonoma burger, omg it was so good.  It was made with goat cheese which I absolutely love!  service was very attentive, this is a busy spot so prepare to wait during dinner time."
Walt B.,"Sun Valley, CA",17,112,15,4.0,9/26/2010,"I went to visit my mother in Irvine, who was in for a conference, and I took her to the CF because it was near her hotel and I knew it would at least be decent.  I don't like big chains, but I have to admit, our waitress was fantastic, it was only a 5 minute wait, and the food was really really good.  My mom absolutely loved it and we had a fantastic time.  The menu is gigantic, it's a nice, well-kept place, and the food was very good.  My only complaint would be that it's very loud, and they should turn the music down."
Mitchell M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,21,15,4.0,12/19/2010,"My wife and I love this place. Many a hard earned dollar has been forfeited over to the Cheesecake Factory but mainly this one. The service can be hit or miss. It does not matter in the slightest if they are busy or not. The food is, on average, is great every time. I would suggest: * Pasta Carbonara - It is my favorite item there. I get it with extra peas and sauce. I suggest skipping the added proteins (chicken or shrimp) as they are not cooked in the sauce and therefore just taste like unseasoned chicken (or shrimp). * Chicken White Bean Chili - Great flavor, the chicken IS cooked in the sauce, and it is one of the most affordable items on the menu. * Renee's Special - Basic soup, salad, half sandwich combo. You are left at the mercy of their soup of the day (Mushroom is probably their best) but you can sub it out for another side if the soup doesn't do it for you. Get the tossed green salad instead of the standard salad. It has a little bitterness and slight peppery taste but significantly better. The half sandwich is a turkey or chicken salad option (get the chicken as the turkey tends to be dry). * The stuffed mushroom ""small plate"" is an appetizer but they do not call them that as their apps are bigger portions and create bigger checks. Stuffed with bread crumbs, baked, sprinkled with parm, and served in iron clad vessels with a madera sauce. Just make sure they are not too stingy on the sauce. It is great. * Cheesecake - You probably can not go wrong with any of which you choose. Keep in mind that this place is called ""The Cheesecake Factory."" If they could not pull it off they would be called, ""The Place With a Large and Varied Menu"" and that would be strange. Things not so great: * Shepard's Pie - It is not a Shepard's pie but a cottage pie (Shepard's pie is lamb based). Aside from the misnaming, it is dry and is overloaded with thyme. * Jumbalaya - Too much bell pepper in the trinity. Seriously, just go to the market of suckle a raw pepper (98¢ instead of 14$). * Fish and Chips - Not a bad dish but just boring in comparison to virtually EVERYTHING else on the menu. * Monte Cristo - They serve this for breakfast instead of lunch+ where it belongs. It is not tasty and it is not a true Monte Cristo. Very sweet and egg heavy (because they put egg in it)."
Sally G.,"Brisbane, Australia",0,12,,5.0,6/4/2011,"Large portions, huge menu, fantastic service (especially Britney who took *time* to actually talk to us), clean and well priced. A winner overall!"
charles b.,"Anaheim, CA",5,29,,4.0,8/7/2009,"Yes, it's a chain. Foodies seem to dread that word. I went here with my grandma and we enjoyed it immensely. Their new small plates appetizer menu is a great addition and sort of a revelation. I got the deep fried artichoke hearts and was really surprised at how much we got for about 4 bucks. I had the Chicken Piccata for my entree and my grandma had the Sweet Tamale Corn Cakes for hers even though the dish is actually an appetizer. Honestly the desserts are amazing here but they don't detract at all from the savory items. I had the lemoncello cream torte and was amazed at it's lightness and full lemon flavor. It's simply lemon cake layered with lemon cream and topped with a streusel like coating of crumbs. Stupendous! My grandma had the Strawberry Cheesecake. It too is amazing. I stole a bite as she went to the restroom. I just had to."
Jordan P.,"Tustin, CA",42,606,194,3.0,9/21/2010,"Had a good happy hour here the other day. I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls or the corn biscuit thingys! I don't really like the atmosphere here, its really over the top Caesar's Palace but cheesy. Kinda weird."
