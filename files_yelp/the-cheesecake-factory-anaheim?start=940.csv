Tiff L.,"Anaheim, CA",8,141,12,3.0,9/17/2010,"Came here last night for dinner with my husband.  We decided to sit at the bar so we didn't have to wait.  It was close to 9pm and there was still a 10 minute wait.  I guess this place is always busy b/c it's so close to Disneyland.  There were plenty of tables available at the bar.  Our server, Chris, was very friendly and provided excellent service.  He deserves 4 stars.  Our glasses were never empty and he was extremely attentive, checking on us often.  I got the Boston salad (lettuce, bacon, egg, tomatoes, croutons, blue cheese, and ranch).  I thought it was a little bland and was expecting more since it had all my fav toppings.  My husband had the blue cheese burger (had bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes).  This was pretty tasty.  Overall, I'd say our dining experience was 3.5 stars."
Eric O.,"Downey, CA",36,204,134,5.0,11/6/2010,"This is our can't miss go to spot, never fails. It's not a five star restaurant, but I give it 5 because overall it's a great spot! Atmosphere, service, good crowd and delicious food. .... Oh, and they have insane cheesecake selection!"
Spencer H.,"Milpitas, CA",403,222,,4.0,5/14/2010,"This is another place I always go to when I make my annual expedition down south. The service is always great (granted I always come during early Sunday brunch so there isn't very many people). Our food always comes in a timely manner and with no hiccups. The banana creme cheesecake is absolutely orgasmic,even if I do have to run 7 miles to burn it off. Nevertheless, I look forward to coming back again this year!"
Shelly C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",504,186,25,5.0,2/10/2008,"I don't really like chain restaurants but this is my favorite!  This is a new location a few blocks away from Disneyland in an area called Garden Walk.  There's a lot of new restaurants popping up in this area so I can't wait to try it. This is the biggest Cheesecake Factory in the area (as compared to Brea, HB, Irvine, Newport, etc)  so the wait time isn't too long.  The ambiance, food, drinks, desserts, etc are consistent with the other locations so you've gotta love that.   For those that have never been to a Cheesecake Factory before...prepare to be wowed!  I always begin with the spicy ahi tempura rolls, continue with the fetuccini and chicken with sundried tomatoes pasta, wash it all down with the strawberry lemonade, and finish it off with the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.   OMG....so DELISH!!"
Shadya G.,"Long Beach, CA",24,167,42,5.0,5/26/2010,"okay...... I LOVE THIS LOCATION! They are supper polite, everyone greets you and the decor is beautiful! If you are a salmon lover, like I am, you must get the herb crested salmon plate!!! It's $19.00, but well worth it! I had to split the plate because it was huge! They have the best tasting appetizers then most restaurants, with a huge variety and mouth watering taste! I always, ALWAYS order the PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CHEESE CAKE!!!!!! UUUHHHHHHuUU!!!!! just thinking about it makes me WAY TOO EXCITED, like in a very weird way! You must try it, if you like pineapples! Trust me, I wont steer you wrong!!!!"
Alicia H.,"Temecula, CA",80,69,36,4.0,4/21/2008,"Note, my rating is based on service, a drink and cheesecake.  The menu scared me, being pretty high up in the funds area.  Alas, I had already prepared for such a thing, eaten dinner elsewhere, so as to leave room for the cheesecake.  Whew! For months I walked by The Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Seattle and never stopped in or even had any interest.  Actually, it wasn't until recently that I discovered they sold food in addition to cheesecake. Yeah, I'm quick. It took a long-time friend's trip to California from Canada to take a gander at the place.   My friend and I walked over to the Factory from her hotel and met another there where we were promptly seated.  Nice big tables...sweet!  Our server was friendly, quick to rattle off the specials, yet didn't treat us with disdain when we informed him we were only here for drinks and cheesecake.   I indulged in a J.W.'s Pink Lemonade which turned out quite alright though didn't rock my socks off.   We finally ordered our cheesecakes after an hour at least, but our waiter was extremely patient and very helpful. Being that I am very picky with my food, especially deserts, my desire for a delicious yet simple cheesecake was time consuming and yet my the waiter answered every question and possible mix of menu choices in a pleasant manner.  He even offered some suggestions but eventually I settled with the Snickers Bar Chunks Cheesecake.   See, I had to have the graham cracker crust and some caramel but once I saw the Snickers option I was sold.    Cheesecake was devine, but they did deliver it with the fudge on top when I'd asked for no fudge.  The waiter apologized but I was in a good mood so let it go considering it was only a slight drizzle on top, not swimming in it.  He did forget my scoop of vanilla ice cream but was quick to return with it as soon as I pointed it out.   I am usually quite annoyed by mistakes which I mentioned but perhaps my excitement of seeing my friend helped me overlook them.  In reality, they are very minor and did not affect the night as a whole.  Nonetheless, I loved the creaminess of the cheesecake, the perfect crust and the fact that they didn't drown it in fudge and topped it with enough caramel and whipped cream to enjoy with each bite.   What really sold me was how long they let us stay in our booth, talking talking talking, until 12:30AM.  We were the last ones out of the place other than those who worked there and they were very sweet about it.  A not so subtle turning on of the overhead lights and we realized they were waiting on us.  I felt bad, but at the same time much appreciative of the gesture to let us stay as long as we did.   I doubt I'll ever return to this location, but I have a feeling I'd indulge in their cheesecake somewhere else at another time."
Peter S.,"Anaheim, CA",3,8,,4.0,3/5/2011,"Had dinner here ~ 5:00 PM on a Friday mid Feb. No wait, just my wife and I. Place was alive with excitement, seriously felt like I was walking into a a grand Vegas casino without the smoke and beeping of machines. The seating crew, sat us towards the back, waitress was attentive to detail. Wife sent back a drink she tried and did not like, I want to say it was a pineapple mojito. She settled for trusty margarita. A big variety on the menu and loved everything. But how can you go to Cheesecake factory and not have cheesecake? White Chocolate Carmel Macadamia was beyond delicious with coffee!!!"
Clare M.,"Los Gatos, CA",89,13,41,4.0,9/3/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory just opened for not long, service is pretty good, nice food, nice deco like other ones.......and when i have desire for a sangria, Cheesecake Factory is always a choice!"
Shiloh A.,"Fullerton, CA",2,11,1,4.0,12/13/2010,"Love love love Cheesecake Factory!  The Thai Lettuce Wraps and Garlic Noodles always make me happy, also the Bangbang Chicken and Shrimp... Don't forget the Red Velvet Cheesecake at 300 calories a bite! :)"
Blondie C.,"Bell, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/7/2013,"Wow!!!...

I Shall Return :P"
Don W.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,23,29,5.0,4/10/2008,This could be bad... I say this because they opened this place less then a mile from my house. This place is my haunt. When I worked in Vegas we use to go to this place all the time and I feel in love with there food. I have to admit that over the years I have tried quite a few of their menu items (there is 240+ of them) but i do stick to my fav witch is the pasta Devinci. It is something you have never tasted before and I would dare you to try it. Now the big thing for me in a chain restaurant is service. And I think the cheesecake factory dose an amazing job with keeping their standards very high and exceeding them. This is a busy place so I recommend it if you are going out for a nice dinner but not really looking for a romantic evening. Although I have made a romantic evening out of a cheesecake factory its just a big place. Tip: When they bring you the bread order some of their house balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Use it do dip your bread in. This stuff is the bomb. I have a jar at home and is good on everything I have tried it on so far.
Kevin K.,"Vancouver, WA",156,163,7,4.0,7/10/2009,"I normally don't review chain restaurants (that's why there's about 15 of them on my profile...), but this place was good.  I think from the multiple restaurants we have tried around Disneyland, this chain restaurant was the best food of them all.  The burgers, steak and salmon were excellent and the cheesecakes are very delicious.  The service was excellent as well.  The atmosphere of the place seems pricey, but the price is actually not too bad considering some other joints and how they fluctuate their prices to be higher due to the high volume of tourists in the area."
Gladys P.,"San Diego, CA",156,34,85,4.0,8/4/2011,"I love my chicken piccata well done w/extra capers... and I also love gettin BBQ chicken ranch salad tossed to go... Yeah I love that they have curbside pickup! But damn, last night was messed up! I placed a to go order(my norm) mentioned above plus 2 sides wheat bread extra butter, to go of course. Well I got my order no problem, we hit the road again and as I reached into the bag to break bread, i felt my fingers in a pool of butter... I looked for napkins to find none in the bags. Ok whatever I had napkins in my car. But that's not all that was missing! No utensils either! Anyhoot, I ended up at the Hilton n asked room service to bring me up some apples since they were free at the front desk and a pair of utensils... I ended up having to pay $8.00 for them... Damn i thought it was free... Lol, well the chicken was not well done, it was warm and salad soggy... still edible but it could've been much better. Mind you I love getting food to go from here because for one their food containers are nice big deep square containers. And when u order salads, the salads are pretty big and you can still toss them jus fine... Ya had fun w it! Ok so... As my loyalty stands, I called them and made my complaint... Gift cards comin my way! Plus free cheesecake!"
Michele B.,"Orange County, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/25/2012,"Went here for Sunday brunch.  They have a great menu for a Sunday brunch.  I don't like those brunch bars that are overpriced and half the items I'd never eat for breakfast anyway.  I got their Napoleon Brulee'd French Toast.   It comes with strawberries, pecans, and chantilly cream.  It was great!!  My husband had blueberry pancakes that were huge enough to feed a small army, and they were very tasty.  Their portions are enormous.  The only drawback was maybe getting there right at 10:00 when they open.  It seemed as though maybe they weren't really staffed and ready to go.  Knowing that, next time we'll just plan on getting there about 10:15 because this is definitely one of my go-to places for breakfast!"
Chris T.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/7/2010,"Love the environment, and the style. Food was delicious, and the waiter was kind and helpful. :)"
Ryan C.,"Sacramento, CA",114,15,2,5.0,6/30/2010,"While I was in Anaheim for Disneyland, I stopped by here to watch the soccer game and ordered the wings. The articheture here was pretty neat to me. Never seen anything like it. I enjoyed the bar area and the appetizers here were great!"
Kione E.,"San Jose, CA",321,693,402,3.0,1/9/2009,"Have I ever mentioned how much I hate the Cheese Cake Factory and all the other soul sucking circus theme park hell hole restaurants that seem to be every where here in sunny SoCal? Well, I do. I hate the colors, décor, the size they make these shit holes. I hate the fact that there has to be a ""theme"" in these ""New American Cuisine"" establishments and that if you really take a look at their menu that they've stolen just about all the good ideas that come from other cultures. I hate that every time I end up at a place like Cheese Cake Factory that there is ALWAYS, ALWAYS at least a 40 minute wait. And I hate that the waiting area has so may people just milling about like cattle that it gets claustrophobic. It's like being at a club and someone killed the dj and no one knows what to do with their selves. I hate the size of the food that you pay ridiculous amounts of money for, and of course you're paying 2xs more for a salad or plate of pasta, because that's just what it is. A salad that can easily feed 2 people. A plate of pasta that can feed 2 people. So yeah, it's gonna be about 30$! Retarded!!! Why don't they just give you a salad and pasta that feeds 1 person and charge half the price? Because that what gluttonous Mickey Mouse America wants. BIG BIG BIG!!! BIG SHINY SPARKLEY VOMITOUS MASS of GARBAGE! And that is just what Conglomerate Corporate America is shoveling to us. All wrapped in a pretty package with a bright purple, pink and orange bow. OK. Now that I've gotten that out of system. So you ask: If you hate it so much, how did you end up there? And I say: Because we were curious about the area and PF Chang's had a 40 minute wait too and no one wanted fake Asian food. So it was CCF or Bubba Gumps. Aw, hell NO. CCF. And then you ask: How is it that you gave them 3 stars Kione? And I respond by saying: I hate the fact that we got damn great service when we were finally brought to our table. The busser/runner/whatever he does, helped us set up the table that in a way that would be more convenient for my sister-inlaw and my 1 yr. old nephew. He was so damn accommodating. I hate the fact that our server had to be so efficient and professional and charming. I hate it that the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls that we got as a starter and the French Farm Salad with all the beets, feta and arugala that me and one of my brothers were sharing had to be so damn tasty. And I especially hate their cooked to perfection ginormous juicy hamburgers that you have to literally have to have jaw that unhinges like a python's and leaves you feeling like you ate the whole cow, like a python. I hate the fries. No, serious, really. I hate them. It tastes like deep fried packing foam. No! I haven't eaten packing foam, but I bet that's what it would taste like. Duh! Did I mention the service? How much I hate the proficiency and the quick response that we got when my sister inlaw found what happened to be a piece of food sticker/label in her pasta, which she was enjoying. It didn't even phase her, but growing up in the industry my brother and I take foreign objects in food as a serious matter. We brought it to the attention of our server and immediately the floormanager/supervisor was there to apologies and comp her pasta. ""We didn't want...we just wanted to let you know, so the kitchen can be more careful."" The manager told us not to worry about it. Cool. Did I mention how I hated that the server was efficient, thorough and really organized and in control of her table? And just so damn nice? Yeah, I hated that. I hated that we all had a great dining experience and that the food was pretty good, because all in all I can't hate this place as much as I would love to. Damn."
D M.,"Liberty Hill, TX",0,37,,2.0,7/23/2012,"I don't know if all Cheesecake Factory locations are as expensive as this one or if they jack up the prices here due to Disneyland.  $67 for two people ordering off the lunch menu...and that is before tip. I had the chicken cobb lunch salad...chicken (what little bit was on there) was dry. We also ordered a soda and a lemonade, the lemonade was $2 more then the soda...wth??  And seriously, your name is cheesecake...and the piece we split really wasn't that great. The waitress really seemed phony too."
Ally L.,"San Francisco, CA",137,195,23,4.0,1/3/2010,"My first time at Cheesecake Factory and it was quite pleasant. My bf and I stopped by around 10pm even though the place closes at 11/11:30pm and we were still able to dine in. Our server was really really helpful and gave his recommendations. The ahi tuna carpaccio was delicious, definitely a yummy appetizer. My sundried tomato fettuccine was alright, but pricey. My bf had a burger and he enjoyed it. Our raspberry lemonades were delicious. We were too full for cheesecake, but the following day we ordered some to-go; we ordered the red velvet and white chocolate raspberry. They could have tasted better- Nothing beats Zanze's cheesecake in SF or even homemade! Overall, very nice for a chain restaurant."
Maria P.,"Bellflower, CA",24,54,40,4.0,12/11/2011,love cheescake factory. just didnt like the long waiting time on busy nights but service and food were great! =]
