Debra E.,"Duvall, WA",1,138,3,5.0,7/7/2012,The Cheesecake Factory was within walking distance of the Hilton Anaheim where we were staying. The service here is great and the food is wonderful! We ate dinner here and sat outdoors. I had fettucine alfredo with chicken and my husband had a cheeseburger. For dessert I ordered a piece of chocolate mousse cake and my husband got a piece of strawberry cheesecake. The food is filling so we were able to save much of it and enjoy it as leftovers later. We really like The Cheesecake Factory and will be back!
Dana B.,"Corona, CA",78,267,15,4.0,8/13/2009,I love this Cheesecake Factory. It is so pretty inside! The servers are always really nice and helpful. I have never had anything that I didn't like. The waiters and waitresses are right on with refills and making sure you don't need anything. I would definitely recommend this for groups and children.
Jenna P.,"Chicago, IL",0,84,,3.0,12/16/2009,"If you've been to any Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. The food is good but not great, it's slightly over-priced, and the portions are sickeningly huge. This place is no different. However, of all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to, this was by far the nicest to look at. We sat in the heated outdoor area, and it was romantic and beautiful. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We got the fried mac and cheese (DELICIOUS), a chicken and pasta dish (pretty good, I really liked the sauce on the pasta), and chicken alfredo (pretty decent). They have yummy frozen drinks too! And, of course, the cheesecake is delicious. If you are looking for a nice, leisurely meal in a pretty setting, and you are willing to spend some extra, this is the perfect place!"
Abby M.,"Victoria, Canada",0,45,3,5.0,3/24/2012,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. Normally I'm against chains, but this is an exception. We had to wait 40 minutes for a table at 7:30 on a Friday night, but I didn't expect much else. The service was exceptional and the food delicious. We were even allowed an additional order of the amazing brown bread. The portions though are huge. I think I made it about 2/3 of the way through my Pasta da Vinci (delicious by the way) and it still looked like I hadn't made a dent. Even so, when at the Cheesecake Factory, it is necessary to order cheesecake. I got the Godiva Cheesecake which was amazing. It was a wonderful experience."
Tin N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",78,173,33,4.0,7/10/2009,"Cheese Cake Factor... its good, sometimes very good.  Some of the things on the menu are only so so and I've experienced some inconsistency with some of the meals and service.  Being a chain restaurant CCF usually takes some heat, but from a strictly objective opinion, I think its a very solid establishment and after eating at some pricier places the menu is actually relatively affordable and a pretty good value.  Definitely one of my favorite chains."
Ken L.,"Anaheim, CA",1,35,,4.0,4/13/2010,"After a week of no bread products, we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  From the fish to the salads to the desserts, all our choices were tasty.  And the service from the hostess to the waitress was friendly and efficient.  One issue I had was that there is the soup of the day--one soup choice only."
Paul L.,"Rodeo, CA",3,22,,4.0,8/27/2011,"One of the very few edible options when visiting nearby Disneyland. The short list of palatable food vendors is shrinking around the happiest place on earth. With Disney closing a Very Good Japanese, Yamabuki and a upscale fish house, Hooks Pointe."
Richard G.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,3,2,5.0,3/9/2012,"Ask for Ethan, he is a great waiter and will really please your evening dinner. Great service, great recommendations, and knows his stuff. Made an awesome evening for the wife and I."
Tom B.,"Denver, CO",17,17,,2.0,9/4/2011,"A disappointing experience.  The Memphis burger, which I ordered to be cooked to medium, was very well done with no pink in the middle.  A friend ordered his burger medium rare and it was also well done.  Service was disappointing as well.  One of the 6 meals ordered came out 10 minutes after the other 5, so when we began eating, those other 5 meals were cold.  The wait staff rarely came around.  When the check came, 18% gratuity was automatically included, rewarding the staff for a job not well done.  I will not come back."
Aiden B.,"Santa Ana, CA",31,21,1,4.0,6/2/2009,"I love the lemon herb chicken here. It was actually the first thing I tried here by recommendation. Its the only main course I've had that was any good unfortunately. I've eaten several unremarkable meals here and learned to only order the lemon chicken.  I'm sort of a niche eater, I like to go to a place for a specific kick or zing. I think this place caters to a broader audience. It is the kind of place where you can hold a family get together and not worry about isolating someone because there are a wide variety of ""safe"" foods offered.  The cheesecake is good here... duh. i recommend the 30th anniversary one. My girlfriend likes the key lime one.  Split the lemon chicken! 4 stars for it."
Trisha P.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,29,1,3.0,3/23/2009,"I am a huge cheesecake factory fan...However the second time I came here with a few friends, I felt the service was horrible. The guy was a total a** and was so impatient! We were all ordering, and the last guy was going to order and he interrupted him and said ""do you need more time?"" forcing him to just pick the first thing he saw. He treated us so horribly, but seemed really nice to the older people there, as if he already knew that young people don't tip well. We would have tipped him much better if he hadn't been such a jerk. I don't feel much of it is overpriced. The cheesecake is delicious, but I guess $6.95 a slice is rather expensive. Careful which alcoholic beverage you get. We got a strawberry daiquiri and paid $8. It didn't taste like it had a bit of alcohol in it! More like a smoothie."
Claudine S.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/10/2011,"A Big Treat Your Taste Buds Will Never Forget  It is funny how us humans have the same amount of chromosomes and same DNA, but look different and like different things. There are people who are always in the mood for anything that come to mind, not very picky, then there are those who know exactly what they want and how they want it. Finding something that agrees with ones taste buds can be difficult, but that is why there are many restaurants carrying different foods from different cultures so that anyone can feel comfortable with their own surroundings and familiar foods. Having  customers feel comfortable at a restaurant is one of the most important parts in running the business.  The first time an individual dines at a restaurant they are experiencing for the first time of how the food is going to taste or if they will be receiving the service of their expectations. What they should tell themselves is to never judge a book by its cover or from what they have heard from relatives, friends, family, etc. First time customers should try it out themselves in order to receive their own experience. As American citizens, we are exposed to various different cultures and ethnic foods that are enjoyed by many people. We have adopted the cooking from our ancestors in which many chefs use at their restaurants. One of America's well known restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory, serves a combination of appetizers, lunch specials, and entrees in which they have incorporated into their menu. Because of their wide selection, they have been able to continuously grow and succeed. They have a huge selection of different types of food for customers who are in the mood for anything, even with picky eaters.  The purpose of food critics is to judge the different meals served to customers and rate them to help improve the business and customer satisfaction. The customer service at a restaurant must be at its best in order to receive returning customers and excellent reviews. The  Cheesecake Factory is one of the best restaurants known around the world, everyone who loves cheesecakes will love what else they have. No one can ever go wrong with Cheesecake factory. Most people today have become accustomed to bored, frustrated, underpaid hourly workers, which recite the necessary obligatory words with no interest at all in helping the customer. It is nice to see someone with a genuine smile and always cheerful because it makes others feel the same way and makes their day and they enjoy the rest of their meal even more. One of the most important details about a restaurant is not only the atmosphere but the view and theme of each diner as well. Many customers enjoy the friendly environment that comes with  dining at The Cheesecake Factory. Because of this, not only do customers return, but by the word of mouth, friends and family are notified about the restaurant. This not only brings more customers but also positive reviews and dining experiences. What many like about The Cheesecake Factory is the fact that they have a vegetarian part in their menu. Many people have become vegans and so they have decided to have a whole menu just for vegans and what is good for them which is astounding. Not all restaurants have put a vegetarian part in their menus, but you still have the choice of ordering salads, soups, and they even have sides of any vegetable you would like to order.  Nevertheless, everyone should always just try different things and eat at different places, never judge a book by its cover or even by what people say sometimes. The Cheesecake Factory knows exactly how to lure people in with their advertisements, famous cheesecakes, and their remarkable food that everyone loves. Realizing the differences between restaurants is very simple, there are so many different ways to represent ones place and if anyone goes to the same restaurant but in a different state, they are expecting the same thing and usually does come out the right way. The Cheesecake Factory knows how to make me people want more of their food and they make so much of what you are having so that you are able to have it to go and enjoy your food at home sitting on the couch watching your favorite movie.  The Cheesecake Factory never lets their customers leave their restaurant unsatisfied, they never fail."
Adrianne D.,"Orange, CA",4,16,,3.0,8/14/2008,"My friend and I couldn't decide where to go eat, so we picked Cheesecake Factory at the Gardenwalk in Anaheim, by default. We walked in and surprisingly we were seated right away. It was crowded and noisy but had a nice date night environment-low lights.  The server was mediocre, she tried making small talk with us...I hate small talk! I ordered the Mesa chicken. It was ok. The chicken was bland so you had to dip it in the sauce that came with the meal which was a little spicy. However, the cilantro rice with roasted corn salsa was very good. My friend ordered the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, although he liked it, it was too sweet! Not only did they use coconut milk to season the meal, they also added roasted coconut as the garnish. I could not imagine eating a whole plate of coconut flavored everything!! GROSS! Other than the food being barely ok, the environment and service was good."
Anhie M.,"Westminster, CA",214,105,237,3.0,12/17/2010,"Contrary to Kellee N.'s review, I actually like the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach better than this one. I've been to the location in HB a handful of times, and this was my first visit to the location in Anaheim. As some have mentioned, it's located in the Anaheim GardenWalk right down the street from Disneyland. After a long day at the theme park, I was starving, so we opted to go to the GardenWalk. It was a Wednesday evening, so it wasn't too busy at all. The boyfriend and I got our usual appetizer, Ahi Carpaccio (thin slices of raw ahi tuna, wasabi pesto, creamy avocado and togarashi aioli). He wasn't too hungry, so we shared my favorite, Hibachi Steak (certified angus hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus).  When our Ahi Carpaccio came out, it did not look fresh at all! The tuna did not have its usual pink tint, instead it was starting to look brown. It seemed like they gave us thicker slices to compensate for the lack in quality. Now, I'm not too sure if the color of the ahi tuna would suffice (it's debatable), but it did not smell or taste fresh either. When my steak came, the dish was missing my asparagus. That wasn't too big of a problem, our waitress brought it out on a separate plate. About one fourth into my steak, I realized that it was bleeding when I ordered medium well. My boyfriend insisted it was just the piece I was cutting into, but I'm sure I saw the red meat even with the lack of lighting in the place. Oh well, we didn't want to bother to send it back. During the meal, my boyfriend's ice tea glass went empty. We watched as our waitress repeatedly passed our table to see if she noticed the empty glass. After a good 20 minutes, she finally came out with a pitcher to refill his drink. Overall, my experience was just okay. The food quality and service seemed to lack a bit, but it might just have been a bad day."
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, CA",307,198,17,4.0,8/25/2009,"I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but when we were in Anaheim my wife wanted to eat there. We have a 2 year old and he is a very pickey eater. I did not want to eat there because they dont have a kid menu.

Neha T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,9,2,4.0,7/24/2011,AMAZING FOOD !!! huge quantity ..I can fill my tummy one more time lot of leftover....Yay!!!
Anna H.,"West Covina, CA",41,174,,5.0,12/28/2008,"So far I have not had anything bad from here.  The thing that I love the most about this one is the gay waiter that we had.  He was so much fun to talk to and he would have been okay with me eating Del Taco there!  Food is always consistent and it's nice that there is a parking structure there.  Makes life a lot easier.  I never realized how close this ""mall"" was to Disneyland.  It's good to have options when a $3 churro just doesn't sound like that good of an idea."
June S.,"Cerritos, CA",116,136,11,3.0,8/1/2008,"I came here on Cheesecake Day ($1.50 cheesecakes baby! SHAZAM!!) and waited an hour and a half to get a TABLE. Then I waited 40 minutes to get my cheesecake only to find out they were still chilled so we had to pick back up cheesecake (which almost took another 40 minutes.) They gave us the chilled cheesecake for free to take home and gave us separate cheesecakes (the bootleg cheesecake that nobody wanted) for us to eat. You know, cheesecake is very good after a good 3 hours of waiting for cheesecake. I'm not going to lie my brothers and sisters. Besides the cheesecake (guess how many times I said cheesecake in this entry), the food is not as incredible as that crowded bar looked on that fateful day. The food just pales in comparison to any other American dining establishment that I've been to. Save your buckaroos and wait for Cheesecake day next year."
Kevin J.,"San Jose, CA",403,5,,1.0,6/25/2011,"Horrible experience at this cheesecake....we got in and were told to expect a 35 minute wait.  After 45 our buzzer went off...we go to the table and they are still setting it up so they send us back to the waiting area. 20 minutes later we go ask for an update and they act surprised before showing is to our seats that were apparently set up 15 minutes before but they forgot to get us.  We sit down, order drinks, another 30 minutes pass..no bread no drinks...got up and had to ask for it before they came out.  Finally ordered our food..they messed up the sandwich, never brought plates, dropped another sandwich on the way so it didn't come out till everyone else's food got cold, brought a salad with the wrong dressing, and then politely asked if I needed a refill!!!! Come on now!!!! I don't need a refill I need my Damn meal on time so I can eat with my family...it was a ridiculous experience and we are definitely never coming back....they were nice enough to comp avocado egg rolls but we didn't even want those cuz we didn't even get half way done with our main meal....the entire dinner was all bad...luckily the nor cal cheesecakes are a lot better"
Francisco C.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,302,,4.0,6/22/2011,"Pasta bellagio is pretty good and so is the pizza. The cheesecake is delicious the red velvet and tuxedo are my favorite. Nice quiet and cozy place. The wait time was like 15 min when I went, wish it was faster. Still the food is great."
