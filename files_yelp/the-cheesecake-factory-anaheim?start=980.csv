Vanessa L.,"Anaheim, CA",703,683,59,3.0,4/6/2008,"The food at Cheesecake Factory is pretty uniform throughout Southern California.  So my review is really about the service and the restaurant.  Service was ok.  You have to understand that this is a HUGE restaurant so I understand if the service might be sluggish.  But given the choice, and if I HAD to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I'd probably opt to go to another smaller restaurant."
Ai M.,"Bellflower, CA",100,2017,4020,3.0,10/15/2008,Chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake is okay  Dutch apple caramel streusel cheesecake was mediocre but the Snickers flavor is always good.  I don't recommend the caramel pecan turtle and lemon raspberry cream cheesecake was surprisingly bland.  I'm a fan of the tiramisu cheesecake.  When I came over once to pick up a Kahlua or peanut butter cup cheesecake they were slow.
Kit Q.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2011,"This restaurant has great food, friendly server and excellent customer service. My family and I are visiting Disneyland and had dinner at this restaurant late last night. My meal came without the English muffins because the server thought it was king of burned and ordered to have new ones made. After a little while the manager came and said they ran out of the English muffin and asked me to choose a different bread. He said that he will not charged me for my meal. wow that was pretty nice. He didn't need to do that. Later on he came back again with English muffin but said still no charge for my meal. That was pretty amazing, definitely a restaurant that put customer service as top priority. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Virginia K.,"Whittier, CA",170,219,3,2.0,8/8/2008,"I have wanted to try the Cheesecake Factory for quite sometime. I actually got my hubby to take me a few years back, but after waiting at the bar for and hour we ended up leaving because the wait was just too long. This location is by Disneyland. We got there pretty early and there was not a long wait. We waited a total of 10 minutes to be seated.  The hostess who seated us was RUDE!! She made some unbelievable remarks to us and I think we should have left right then and there, but we decided that maybe she was having a bad day, whatever. Our waitress was alright, she wasn't as attentive to us but she got the job done. Our meal: I ordered the lunch-sized portion of the Garlic noodles with Shrimp. The shrimp didn't taste right to me. I don't know what it was but I ate one and pushed the rest aside. Maybe they weren't fresh? The actual meal was lacking in flavor. It basically tasted like buttered noodles with veggies. My husband ordered the Meatloaf. He didn't like it either. I thought it was Okay. The only meal that was just right was our sons grilled cheese sandwich. The cheesecake was Ok. We got a plain cheesecake with strawberries.  It was just okay, nothing special. I don't think I will be returning. It wasn't what I expected at all."
Joey V.,"Anaheim, CA",1,4,,5.0,12/17/2010,"cheesecake factory is very good. tried it for the first time a couple months ago. im new to yelp, but i had to review about this!! it's very good and i went back numerous times already. the menu has too much too choose from. very delightful though. everything has good flavors."
Bryce K.,"Sacramento, CA",1,145,,4.0,9/27/2009,"food taste = 4.5 price / value = 3 service = 5 environment = 4 food tasted good, but a bit on the pricey side.  our waitress, ""koren s"" was nothing short of outstanding.  she checked on us often to see how we were doing.  she let us stay and watch the game without giving us a hassle.  although it was busy, she still managed to provide us spectacular service. in all honesty, i'm still tempted to give this place a 3, since the prices are not cheap, but the portions and the friendliness of our server pushes this up to a 4."
Tony M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,43,1,4.0,4/14/2009,Nice place: large and clean.Food was just OK (sesame chicken) but the servers were super cool.Very kid friendly.My little one was spoiled by every single server in this establishment.
Simon C.,"San Jose, CA",0,86,,2.0,12/31/2008,"I am really sorry, the waitress that serviced me that night really ought to be  fired.  I must have a really bad luck that night.  I have never had anyone told me how I should have my fish done; I am the customer, I want my fish well done, and you will tell the kitchen to make it well-done, to my liking.  I asked for soya sauce and she slammed the bottle on my table.  The manager apologized but I really had lost my appetite.   I am really hesitant to come back here.   I have had great experience every other CheeseCake factory.  I am really sorry someone has to taint that image."
