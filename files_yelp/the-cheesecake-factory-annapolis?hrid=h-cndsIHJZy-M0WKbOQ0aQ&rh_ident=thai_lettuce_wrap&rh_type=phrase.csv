Mike L.,"Riva, United States",56,40,5,4.0,5/3/2014,"You could go to The Cheesecake Factory during a blizzard with an imminent nuclear missile launch and there'd still be a wait for a table! That's not a complaint, just an observation -- which, means that people like the place. It's funny. I spend what seems like a half hour going through the menu everytime I go, but I always seem to settle for one of few of the same items time and time again.

My biggest complaint is that I can't get AT&T cellphone service in the blasted place! I can't post a picture of my stacked burger or seven thousand calorie tower of cheesecake until I get in the car! But, if that's my only complaint, they're doing pretty well! (NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: Add WiFI and people can post to social media without talking on their phones!)"

They simply did not come back.   The food, of course, was great.  I ordered the   which consists of chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, and a few other ingredients that you wrap in a huge lettuce leaf.  The dish also comes with three sauces that really make this meal great!  I also got the sliders which were a little under cooked but good none the less."
