Ivana D.,"Rosemead, CA",284,68,233,5.0,1/3/2018,"I actually love this place! Though probably explains why the line at night is so long! Portion sizes are huge as well so you can definitely share or take home left overs!  First to start off with the bread, I love the brown bread that I usually just ask for that one especially when it's freshly warm and the butter gets all melting into it..yuum. Some of my choices to get would be the factory combination of the steak diane(?) and herb crusted salmon. The steak is a little on the sweeter side, it comes with mushrooms and mashed potato in the middle separating it from the creamy sauce for the moist salmon. It comes with some asparagus which goes great with the sauce. I like both side sauces actually but the creamy one for the salmon is addicting! So addicting sometimes, I just get the herb crusted salmon by itself. Another option I absolutely love is the Louisiana chicken pasta! The sauce is creamy, a hint of spicy, with some flavorable veggies like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. This comes with bow tie pasta, my favorite pasta. The chicken is breaded and fried, so its a bit crunchy but still moist. Also, you can add as much freshly grated parmesan cheese as you want! The sauce is so good, I like practically clean the plate squeaky clean. I never really tried other cheesecakes but I usually go with their most popular if I'm in the mood. Which is the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. Some days its not so good, other days it's the best thing ever. So I think this is the only thing that isn't always consistent, food wise.  Same goes for service, sometimes the service is amazing, other days, maybe not as good? It's still decent though!"
Alvin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,153,128,2.0,1/10/2018,"I'm only giving this restaurant one star for service and another for the bread.  Came here on a weekend for dinner with a group of 6 and because they don't take reservations, we wound up waiting in line like everyone else for nearly an hour and a half to be seated. You line up and make your way through hoards of people waiting inside to put your name down and grab one of those buzzers. There's no fancy text messaging system to alert you to return when your name is about to be called. I expected some wait during the weekend but we were finally seated after 90 minutes.  Your experience with service here will vary depending on who you're paired with but our server was cute in an awkward kind of way. He made sure we were well stocked with delicious brown bread and sourdough bread with butter while we waited for our food. And this is where the positives end. Eating at the Cheesecake Factory is not cheap, and while I hate the idea of eating at chain restaurants, my girlfriend really loves the strawberry shortcake here and we decided to bring the family along. At close to 15-20 dollars a dish, you expect to have some decent quality to the food. I'm not sure if the chefs were particularly burnt out this evening but all of our dishes came out terrible and almost inedible. Shrimp Scampi - bland overcooked pasta with a scattering of limp shrimp drenched in butter and lemon juice. If they had kept this al dente, it may have been okay. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - overly sweet and rich coconut sauce was overpowering and the hints of ginger made this an entree that looked like a sad attempt at thai fusion curry. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - overcooked green pasta with no sauce. It tasted like someone had left the pasta boiling in the water 10 minutes too long and washed out the sauce after realizing that it wasn't clinging onto the noodles. Tasted a lot like mealy carbs with cajun seasoning sprinkled on and not much else. Miso Salmon - the one acceptable dish but it came out overly sweet today and my parents didn't care for it. Thai Coconut Lime Chicken - ordered this as it was on their list of new items and I'm a huge fan of thai food. This was more palatable than the overly sweet bang bang chicken but the sauce was way too strong, and again tasted like syrup and coconut milk poured atop coconut flavored rice.  Smokehouse burger - bun was burnt to a crisp and extra smoky. 'nuff said. Those in the kitchen seem to have given up. Quality control between the various Cheescake factories needs work in order to demonstrate to customers that their food is of good value. When you're paying north of 20 dollars per person for food after taxes, it is quite sad when the star dish of the day was the complimentary bread served before the main courses."
Jennifer L.,"Monterey Park, CA",113,28,37,1.0,1/6/2018,"The pagers DO NOT work! My party was waiting for 50 minutes before deciding to check in with the hostess. They said that they called our party 30 minutes ago! The pagers did not go off and we were just standing in front of the door. So then, they wanted us to wait on the side for another 20 minutes. While waiting on the side, we heard them give another table of 5 who just check in a 10 minute wait. Unbelievable!  Service was slow, and food was mediocre.  Not coming to this Cheesecake factory again."
Henri V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,170,287,3.0,1/4/2018,"Happened to be in Arcadia earlier today and decided to do a look see through the Westfield's and Cheesecake Factory's menu offers relatively healthy options. Really had to have the larger portion of the grilled salmon, steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes...all yummy good, although I noticed the portions have dramatically decreased from their standard generous portions, was not happy since I ordered the dinner entree and instead received the lunch portion and was charged for the dinner...NOT cool. Unfortunately, that killed my appetite for dessert, and skipped on cheesecake. This particular restaurant in Arcadia was clean and the service from the hostess, waiter and servers were professional, prompt and nice. Watch out for bate and switch, and double check your bill before paying..."
Brian L.,"Orange, CA",243,120,35,3.0,1/2/2018,"Came here for dinner on New Year's Eve and the wait was almost an hour. So if you want Cheesecake Factory, especially this location, and don't want a long wait. Avoid the holidays. This location is one of the more bougie and grand than some other ones. The staff is nice and friendly and the food is decent. One of the best things about this place is that serving sizes are fairly large. However, I would stay away from their combination options if you're hungry. My farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was great and I was able to have some leftovers even after sharing with another person. Definitely try one of their cheesecakes because hello... Cheesecake Factory. Can't go wrong with any choice, but you can always ask your waiter for recommendations. My party actually ended up sharing a tiramisu cake, which wasn't bad but they put a ton of whipped cream so that was meh. Their cocktails/mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Their passion fruit mojito and Georgia peach are great, but will cost you a pretty penny. Their moscato is a great alternative and is more cost effective. My only complaints about this place are that my party had to wait an extra 15 minutes because the hostess at the counter put me down as a party of 2 when I actually had 3. And the waiter we had was here and there and would disappear for some time while his tables needed him."
Maggie O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,4,2.0,12/24/2017,"Food was great, but this is regarding my order.  So i ordered on the phone since we decided to have a holiday dinner at home. I ordered the chargrilled ny steak with mashed potatoes and french fries, all GF. The guy who took my order repeated it as GF. When i went to go pick it up,  1) my steak had no fries 2) they forgot to give me my $9 cake I had notified the lady and she put the fries order in for me but she checked with her manager(?) to see if they can do French Fries GF, in which they said they dont. That was a surprise and very odd to me because ive been gluten free for almost 2years and everytime i dined in or ordered take out, they confirmed that it was GF and ive never had a reaction. The manager(?) told me that they dont do GF for french fries but they can use the fryer they didnt usr much. I said okay, and they asked me if i wanted sweet potato fries or french fries, I said French Fries. He said okay and put the order in. While waiting i finally got my cake and about 10min i go my fries. I didnt even check because i thought they would be fries but when i got back home and check, it turned out to be sweet potato fries. On the menu the sweet potato fries is not listed as the ""GF upon requested"" so i ended up not eating it to be on the safe side."
Anna B.,"Glendora, CA",43,129,83,4.0,10/8/2017,"I dined here for lunch around noon on a Saturday. My friend and I chose to sit in the outside patio area. Our server, Mercedes, provided fantastic table service by ensuring that our bread basket was always filled and promptly packaging up the leftovers from our meal. We browsed the cocktail and wine menu, settling on a glass of Chapoutier Rosé wine for me (my first time trying this specific wine and loved the light yet crisp flavor elements) and a Red Sangria for my friend.  Next, we shared the guacamole and chips appetizer (also includes condiment-sized cups of salsa and sour cream), which is priced at $12.50, but overlooking the steep price since the guacamole was THAT GOOD for standard American fare. For our main entrée, we shared the Bistro Shrimp Pasta (pasta portions are ample here, so I suggest sharing if you can't finish a whole plate of pasta by yourself) and an appetizer side salad; a tossed green salad that we asked to have two different dressings with: bleu cheese and ranch. The salad was exceptional for a regular green salad, since the lettuce selection wasn't iceberg lettuce heaped together, but actual green leaf lettuce freshly chopped. The pasta dish was wonderful, however the crispy battered shrimp was great tasting, but not my favorite kind of shrimp since I usually prefer my shrimp pasta dishes to have sautéed shrimp instead of fried. Therefore, if I order this pasta another time, I will choose to swap in sautéed shrimp instead of the former, because that basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce on the pasta was delightful! Although quite pricier compared to other restaurant chains, this Cheesecake Factory location delivers splendid customer service and cooks up consistently delectable pasta dishes."
Janny K.,"San Gabriel, CA",177,75,263,5.0,12/11/2017,"This is probably one of my favorite local restaurant! I come here pretty often especially during lunch time. I do enjoy getting their appetizers. I like the chicken sliders, avocado egg rolls which is deep fried, Factory nachos are really good and loaded with everything, macaroni balls are delicious, the side salad is okay and comes in a huge portion, the sweet tamale is very delicious (I don't know where I can this type of fusion) , spinach dip is delicious and not too oily/salty, and the buffalo wings is amazing because it's crunchy. They also have happy hour which is half off on selected appetizers. Entrees of pretty delicious: I have tried the salmon steak which is wonderful and good. It's not too dry.  My favorite is. Pasta Da Vinci. It's a sweet oily taste. Comes with loaded mushrooms, onions and garlic. Penne pasta. I love the hint of wine along with such delicious chicken. I will definitely order this again and again.  My bf had the four cheese pasta and it's definitely cheesy if that's how you I like your pasta. It's really good according to him until his cheese turned cold haha and it also comes with chicken with a spoonful of more cheese in the center.  Love their fresh squeezed orange juice.  Their mojito is delicious and refreshing. I usually get this during the day along with my appetizers. Love the mint leaves  Before I had diabetes (2017), I always get their strawberry cheesecake!! It's the best! And I would order one for here and one to go haha.  Most of all, I love the experience here. Wonderful customer service, all the waiters are really super nice except what they are super busy during happy hours. They take forever to serve you but if you come on non happy hours you would definitely leave happy. Everyone is very polite and very quick at their service. They always make sure you are satisfied throughout your whole experience. Again, this is one of my favorite restaurants in my local area."
Sandi T.,"Alhambra, CA",42,143,524,5.0,10/4/2017,"Cody gave wonderful service last night ! Everything ran smoothly from start to finish. My boyfriend was hesitant about coming here for dinner but by the end of the meal was so pleased that he did. Our food was great, I got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and my boyfriend got the Filet Mignon and added asparagus to his meal . For our appetizer we got the Dynamite Shrimp which is a favorite of ours whenever we do stop by.  The Red Sangria they have here is really good. It's sweet but just right not overbearing.  Cody was friendly and easy to talk too , he constantly was checking in on us and making sure we had water . Some of the best service we have had here . We will definitely be back and hope that he's our server again !"
Leona L.,"El Monte, CA",875,123,420,4.0,9/17/2017,"I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but something about Cheesecake Factory's pastas and chickens make my belly extremely happy! This location is in the Santa Anita Mall in Arcadia, CA, which is convenient! You can burn all those calories you stuffed your face with by walking around the mall after! I usually order my favorite farfalle pasta! It's a bowtie pasta with a garlic creamy sauce, chicken, and mushrooms! I am obsessed with garlic, so I can definitely taste the garlic with my pasta. The chicken with the pasta is also extremely good! It isn't dry and the sauce goes well with it.  The chicken madeira is also a huge win for me! It's a sliced piece of chicken breast, with the madeira sauce! It is soooooo good. The sauce is addicting! It's this wine/mushroom sauce. It went perfect with the chicken and mashed potatoes it came with! Another plate we enjoy ordering, is the avocado egg rolls! My mom loves the sauce it comes with. It's this sweet, cilantro-ish sauce, which is quite flavorful. I just love the avocado rolls by itself! It literally just tastes like you are eating huge chunks of avocados wrapped in a fried blanket of carbs!  I rarely come to cheesecake factory because of the prices. I feel like with the prices of the items on the menu is a little high! There are definitely chain restaurants that are more affordable.  TIP: -if you're going for lunch, you can get the pastas ""lunch-portion"" -ask for fresh parmesan to be grated over your pasta or meal!"
Allisyn N.,"San Gabriel, CA",334,11,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"Oh my godddd where do I begin? I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years now (I used to work at the mall, so it was my go to)-- but after what happened last night (NYE), not anymore. So I want to start out by saying that I went yesterday because I had a gift card, and it was New Year's Eve. It was packed, as predicted but nonetheless my boyfriend and I opted to sit outside so it was only a 5 minute wait. We had the waitress Melissa (I think) red hair in a ponytail, she was wonderful; this review is solely on the food not the service. The service was awesome to say the least. Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the Pasta Nepolatana and I ordered my usual Carbonara no chicken. So the food came out fairly quickly, and tasted good. But further into the night I started to feel super queasy. It was New Year's Eve there's no way I could've got food poisoning right? WRONG! I spent my entire night throwing up and on the toilet, I'm writing this review as we speak because I'm still experiencing the same!! HORRIBLE! Worst food poisoning I have EVER gotten, I can't even keep warm water down!! On the other hand, my boyfriend ate some of my pasta he was feeling alright up until this morning, he has been in the restroom ever since! I'm so upset, what a great way to start my New Years! I was going to call and complain, but I can't stop myself from feeling nauseous. So disappointed, I hope customer service takes this seriously! I'm so sad this is the way I started my New Year! :("
Julie P.,"Pasadena, CA",1335,261,1069,4.0,8/28/2017,"I have been meaning to write a great review for this place. I have been coming to this place for few years now. This is a chain restaurant ,so many of us are familiar with this place. However, the location and staff make all the different. Location: At Santa Anita Mall in the back  by AMC movie theater/Food Court Parking: free or you can get valet in right next to the restaurant Decoration: Modern furniture. It has inside and outside dining area. You also have a bar area for happy hour. You don't need reservation to sit in this area. Outside area also have heat lamp for cold nights Service: Service oriented restaurant. People appear happy and ready to do a great job Food: I got the Fried Macaroni and Cheese. It was melt to your mouth with  crispy cheese ball and you dipped in creamy marinara sauce (delicious). I got the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta. It was sautéed perfectly with tender chicken and top with fresh basil in Rigatoni pasta Price: $13-20. It is reasonable for the amount of food you can. You can also ask for lunch or dinner portion. If you are into portion control Dessert Menu: Tiramisu,  Chocolate Tower Truffle cake, Fresh Strawberry shortcake and of course any kind of cheesecake you can think of (Ex: Fresh Strawberry, Coffee & Cream Chocolate,  Salted Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores , Oreo Dream, Lemon Meringue, Peanut Butter Cup Fudge, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle, Dulce De Leche Caramel). I can go on and on about their mouth watering desserts that  will clogged all your arteries. However, you will die happy. They have Sunday Brunch  from 10-2pm If you are into dieting, this is probably not the place for you. Their food are in high calories and it is written write next to the name of the dish. You will feel bad for eating it. I tried to be good by getting their skinnlicious menu, but the calories are still fairly high. However, I believed you only live once, so enjoy life vs worry all the time about how you look. Enjoy!!!"
Mark Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",13,4,5,1.0,11/19/2017,"Ordered a phone order. Carne Asada steak medallions. Asked for them medium well. Not only was the food cold within 10-15 minutes of taking it, the steak was RARE."
Jay T.,"Alhambra, CA",162,4,6,2.0,1/1/2018,"Worst experience ever...we came today at 6 for a party of 5 and let me tell you...a 50 mins wait and a mess in management of the line. No one knew there was a line for the reception desk. We ordered pizza and spaghetti w meat ball for the kids. The spaghetti had too much salt and we had to send it back. The pepperoni on the pizza was also extra salty.  I had the habachi steak and it was too sweet. The only good thing was my wife Santa Fe salad. As we were finishing up the fire alarm went off. Perfect time cus then the kids went nuts because it was too loud. They took off as I wait for our check and spaghetti to get pack to go. I have been waiting for a good 10 mins now. Overall, I give this place 2 stars. Why? The salad was good. I won't be coming back here. The bill didn't not covered the inconvenience I experienced. They did give me a comp spaghetti meatballs cause we sent it back."
Leslie B.,"Glendora, CA",232,14,,5.0,1/4/2018,"AWESOME service, great staff, delicious food, & yummy dessert. Oh & JADE is absolutely amazing! Overall, I was happy with everything. The wait to get a booth was very short (only a 5 minute wait). Once we were seated and ordered, our food came quickly. Our waiter (forgot his name) always checked up on us and was very attentive. They provided us with delicious complimentary bread while waiting for our meal to arrive."
John T.,"Rosemead, CA",809,727,4248,4.0,6/23/2017,"Rating: 3.5 Stars...... Sounds about right! Been at this location a handful of times for birthdays, holidays, and gatherings. The last time I came here was to celebrate an early father's day. Location/Parking: Located at the Santa Anita Mall. You'll find this restaurant next to Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill. Parking can be a bit troublesome during peak times. Ambiance/Decor: Nice ambiance with modern furnishings and a outdoor patio to people watch. They also have heatlamps just in case it gets chilly willy! Wait time: You might wait for awhile during peak times. So call ahead and make a reservation. Service: Service was fairly consistent. Staffers were friendly and attentive. Food usually takes awhile, because they usually bring all the food all at once. Food: They mostly offer high calorie (1,000+ cal.) dishes. If you're calorie counting, don't get scared off. They do offer a skinnylicious extensive menu for all you healthy peeps. Over the years, I've tried a lot of items, but my top 3 plates that I rotate (creature of habit) through are: 1) Meatloaf: Comes with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash. Meatloaf lovers will definitely love this dish. Very moist and very flavorful! Mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash is the cherry topper for me.  2) Miso Salmon: Comes with snow peas, rice (white or brown), and topped with a miso sauce. Very yum! I'm a salmon lover and this one is tender and flavorful. The sauce is beautiful! :)  3) Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken: Comes with mashed potatoes, carrots, and watercress.The chicken is flavorful, tender, and beautiful!!! I also like eating the skin! For me, the mashpotatoes, carrots, and watercress balances this plate beautifully. Get your eating on folks!"
Gabby A.,"Covina, CA",0,51,253,4.0,12/26/2017,"Came here on Christmas Eve after going to Clearmans and it being closed. This is our go to Cheesecake Factory. Service here is always good. We get seated very fast even if there is a lot of people waiting. Most dishes, drinks and desserts are also very good."
Rosie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,48,35,4.0,1/7/2018,"We're seated st half the time we were initially given when checked in. Our server was prompt, amiable,  thorough and very professional. His service was superb and beyond expectations. Dinner portions were big, taste is consistent, ambiance was pleasant. Will be back to this location."
Anna H.,"Cerritos, CA",124,76,139,1.0,7/18/2017,"I've always had great experiences at Cheesecake Factory but tonight was rather annoying.  We sat down for 20 mins before a server came to introduce himself and offered us bread & asked us what we wanted to drink. 10 minutes later, a brand new server brought our water, bread, and took our orders. Legitimately 10 minutes after taking our orders she walked over to ask us what we ordered because she ""couldn't read her writing"". While we were waiting for our food, we asked our server TWICE to bring us straws and to refill our waters. Our food didn't come out until 30 minutes later.  Our server never checked on us to see if everything was okay nor to refill our waters.  I'm not quite too sure if they were short staffed or most of the staff was crowded were jus distracted in a table to reunite with an old employee. But I was utterly disappointed. We were not provided with the appropriate, professional, customer service a paying customer should've been treated. TERRIBLE SERVICE. Completely unacceptable"
Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,4.0,10/3/2017,"I came for dinner with family on a Sunday night at 5pm in October.  Parking was a pain in the butt and wait to get a table was 25 min.  Also, there were lots of people waiting as well too.  After 20min wait, we noticed the table in the bar was empty so  we sat there.  Our waitress was friendly and we ordered our drinks and meals.  Then our basket of bread arrived to the table and it was warm and delicious. We didn't wait too long for our meals to arrived.  My crusted parmesan pasta arrived and it was delicious with plenty of sauce and parmesan was crispy.  The waitress was good on refills and checked on us several times which is nice."
Brenda K.,"El Monte, CA",55,111,60,3.0,7/22/2017,"I've been to this location a few times, and there's been pros and cons to each visit.  Service is hit and miss. You either get a good server, or you don't. I usually don't mind service that is just okay, but for here, I also base it on whether they'll slip me some of that delicious molasses bread with my wrapped leftovers. They generally give it to me when I ask for it.  Honestly, the free brown bread is the only reason I eat in. Everything else is meh for the price. I'd rather buy just dessert at the counter than eat here. Even then, dessert is pricey, so it has to be a ""treat yo self"" occasion."
Bianca S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",117,131,294,4.0,5/18/2017,After an annoying day of shopping at the Santa Anita mall (because it's always so crowded) we decided to stop at Cheesecake Factory and grab something to eat. We came in at about 1:30pm and it wasn't really busy but for some reason we waited almost 10 mins and still weren't seated so we decided to seat ourselves in the bar seating area. Our server took a couple minutes to come over and she took our drink order while we went over the menu. We put in an order for the avocado egg roll appetizer and they came out about 10 mins after. These egg rolls never disappointment me and I swear they get better every time.  I ordered the chicken piccata off the lunch menu. It came out about 15 mins after our appetizer. The portion was way more than enough I could barely finish it even though it was the lunch size. It's one of my favorite dishes the mushroom lemon caper sauce that comes on it is so refreshing and satisfying. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't enough sauce on it and there was way too much butter I wish there was more lemon in it today.  We somehow managed to fit in desert. We ordered the banana creme cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. ONE OF THE BEST FLAVORS!!! It's almost like a creamy banana pudding and the whipped cream they used on top is so light and airy. You have to try if you haven't already!
Sally L.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,169,948,4.0,5/24/2017,"One of my go-to places for a special occasion! This location is located right outside of the Santa Anita mall near the food court. It's pretty big with a lot of seating, but there can still be a wait during busy weekend dinner times. You can definitely grab a drink in the bar area while you wait. If you're into yummy cocktails, I would suggest the Strawberry Creamsicle or the Peach Bellini!  As for food, they have a ton of options ranging from pastas to pizzas to protein dishes. My favorite is the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken. I just love the light lemon herb sauce! Also, the mashed potatoes are great because I love mine chunky. The Pasta Da Vinci is also a good choice. It has chicken, mushrooms, and a great wine sauce. They also give you free unlimited bread here that's really great. I love the ""brown bread"" which is a sweet wheat and oat brown bread that tastes like chocolate in my opinion.  And of course, you can't forget about the cheesecake. They have so many different options that it's always hard to choose. The red velvet one is really good, and so is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. Each slice is pretty hefty so I suggest splitting it with someone. Overall, Cheesecake Factory might be a bit pricey (~$15-20 per dish), but the food tastes great and comes in big portions, and they have good service, so I think it's worth it!"
Tony S.,"Azusa, CA",1,23,2,1.0,1/1/2018,Sorry but today ended in a nightmare. 8:20 p.m. the fire alarms sounded off so everyone was like what's going on instead of the managers or employees coming out and say hey guys everything is okay its just a false alarm they just stood in the side like WTF? I already have 1 bad ear now i have a pinging noise in my good ear. I came to have a peaceful dinner with my family not to have a loud false alarm ruining our night. SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL CHEESECAKE FACTORY. TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY MANAGERS TO LET THE CUSTOMER KNOW ITS JUST A FALSE ALARM!!!
Amy T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",262,13,69,3.0,10/30/2017,"Four category review!  Our party of two came at 6:10 on a Sunday night. We were seated 10-15 minutes later. Of course this place is packed but not as bad.  Parking: Parking is ample at this time since everyone is typically leaving for the mall. Parking is pretty easy near JcPenny if you don't mind the walk! :)   Ambiance: Its very loud and lively here. The decor is very grandeur. It's a very casual place nonetheless. Some come dressed. Some come from walking around the mall.  Service: We ordered two waters at 6:25pm. We got our waters at 6:27pm, we also ordered two entrees during this time. We were informed that our complimentary bread was in the oven, which was gratefully appreciated. Our waitress was a very nice young girl that was prompt and nice.  Food: the bread was very nice and toasty and crispy. So perfect for a snack. So appreciated. Our entrees arrived at 6:38pm I got the chicken chipotle pasta while my bf got the four cheese pasta with chicken. The four cheese pasta was ok. The pasta itself, hard. Honestly, I wish they offered freshly grated Parmesan cheese on both of ours. My chipotle pasta had a nice kick, but was over salted and the pasta itself was very dry. The plus side of being at this place are the portion size in comparison to price. I'm getting a two person portion for less than $20. Can't complain.  For dessert, what we mainly came for, was the fresh banana cheesecake. For some reason, our cheesecake was coated with a layer of ice on top. I was so disappointed. If you're gonna serve frozen then at least thaw it out so you can deceive just a tiny bit. Thanks. :(  Overall, eh. Haha."
Nancy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,416,1017,4.0,5/16/2017,"Came on a holiday and the service was very very slow, but the foods usually good. Things that were good here: Appetizer- spicy wings  -Anti oxidant salad -Hibachi steak that comes with mash potatoes and wild mushrooms. -The grilled salmon/miso salmon that comes with mash potatoes and broccoli Things that are not good here: -The jumbalaya pasta with chicken and bell peppers are so plain. The chicken had no flavor even when it was cooked with peppers. There's no sauce in this dish, it was missing tomatoe sauce but instead it was dry all around. I did not even want to box this to-go. Not enjoyable whatsoever. Their sangria is not bad if you like red wine and fruits. Also their steak Diane under the combinations section was alright, steak was not so flavorful."
Edy O.,"TUJUNGA, CA",144,74,421,5.0,11/27/2017,"This place is great and prety cheap for what your getting. It is a perfect spot when you just don't know what to eat, or a great planned dinner date. They have good food, good service, and the ambient is great. And it's realy affordable."
Nancy T.,"Rosemead, CA",178,198,491,5.0,6/7/2017,"Cheesecake factory is my friends and It's go-to ""wanna be fancy"" but usually broke dinner spots. I've been here multiple times and have always had a good experience. Servers are always super kind, and customer service is always on par.  This night we came in to celebrate my passing of my cset (2 down, 1 to go! Woot!) Plus I was introducing my best friend to the guy I was dating so it was a 2-1 deal . I ended up ordering a pasta and he ordered the steak/salmon combo. We also ordered a glass of wine as well as 2 cheesecakes. We got the chocolate one and the tiramisu.  Often times when I come, I always have to wait for a spot. But this night surprisingly we didn't have to wait at all. Once seated the server introduced himself and we put in our drinks order. They always give you complimentary bread, both sour dough and white along with butter. (Be careful, cuhs they're addicting and unlimited and then you get too full to eat your main meal).  We ended up spending around 120$ for 4 meals, a glass of wine, 2 ice teas, and 2 slices of cheesecake. Not too shabby for an Italian place. My go-to pasta was always the tomato basil pasta but decided to switch it up tonight.  Overall, I love coming to cheesecake factory to satisfy my pasta craving and pretend I'm high class and dining fancy. The only downside is with T-Mobile, I rarely get any service so how am I supposed to Snapchat ?"
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,4/5/2017,"When Cheesecake Factory opened up this location in Arcadia, it saved us time and energy in trying to make it to the Pasadena location, which is farther with some parking challenges. In all the times I've been here, there is usually a wait to get seated. My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have been pretty consistent. Adequate service and the quality of food doesn't deviate (most of the time). On my last visit, I ordered my usual at Cheesecake - the seared ahi tuna tataki salad. Even though I had this so many times already, it still feels weird that the tomatoes come in slices like you'll have on a burger, rather than chopped up in wedges like a normal salad. BF branched out and tried the cajun chicken littles, which were fried boneless chicken breast pieces with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. BF subbed in french fries for mashed potatoes. It was good, though I doubt he'll add it to his rotating repertoire of what he'd usually order. It must have been super busy because we had table bread served on a plate and not the usual basket, even though the two tables next to us had their bread in a basket.  While there is a wait to get a table, there is also high chances of a wait to find parking too as you're competing with people visiting the mall, the AMC movie theater, and other restaurants on that side of Westfield. Come with patience in tow."
Vivian D.,"El Monte, CA",437,150,268,4.0,3/14/2017,"Came in on Sunday for lunch and waited about 5 minutes before being seated. It was my first time at Cheesecake Factory! It's pretty pricey but I actually received a gift card for Christmas so it was time for me to cash it in. My sisters and I were having lunch for her birthday. We ordered the lunch specials, soup & salad, fettuccine alfredo, and the four cheese pasta. All of which were really really good. The food was great, but the price for what we paid was crazy if I didn't have a gift card. Definitely a nice place for special occasions"
Richard M.,"Rosemead, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/24/2017,Manager needs to be more organized for the bakery takeout. 1 person working isn't going to help for the holiday rush when it first opens
Amory B.,"Ontario, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/23/2017,"They set the silverware straight onto the table..uncovered and exposed. Really disgusting. My wheat toast was so burnt, I couldn't even bite into it."
Michelle N.,"Alhambra, CA",109,288,698,2.0,7/26/2017,Came for a team dinner . Since it's been a while .. and I chose this place thinking it was a nice place to have dinner .  Anywho ..... we ordered . And everything was fine. Customer service was fine  But everyone got their food except one person  That one person just ordered shrimp and linguine . 30 minutes later... no food and now our food is cold waiting . Because we all wanted to eat together  They were nice enough to give us our dessert for free  But the whole experience was ridiculous and definitely not a place I'll be coming back to
Melanie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",380,324,451,5.0,7/3/2017,"After all these years, my love for Cheesecake Factory hasn't wavered. This restaurant chain has a soft spot in my heart ever since my mom started taking me here for my birthday every year. I love the free freshly baked bread- especially the honey wheat. My family and I always shamelessly ask for refills on bread throughout our meal.  Avocado Eggrolls- (5/5) My favorite appetizer! I love the contrast of the crispy exterior with the soft, creamy avocado filling. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce is absolutely delicious & really elevates the appetizer.  Thai Lettuce Wraps- (4/5) Make-your-own lettuce wraps that can get a bit messy. The appetizer comes with 3 different dipping sauces and an assortment of lettuce wrap components to customize my wrap just to my liking.  Factory Combination: Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane- (5/5) My absolute favorite entree at Cheesecake Factory is chicken madeira. I can never get enough of the madeira sauce. Steak Diane is chunks of steak covered with black peppercorn & covered with a delicious wine sauce. The combination of the chicken and steak was delicious.  Tiramisu- (3/5) not a super strong coffee or liquor flavor & there was a bit too much whipped cream for the dish. I can't hold this dessert against the restaurant, since they are known for their cheesecakes- not their tiramisu."
Clement T.,"Oakland, CA",362,34,11,1.0,8/24/2017,"Came down to visit my parents and figured we'd would go to somewhere with some ""nostalgia"" Been coming here since they opened in the mid 2000s. Arguably one of my favorite spots as a kid. Came here about once a week till I moved to the Bay in 2011. Had its ups and downs as any restaurant over the course of 10 years.  Today was hands down the worst.  Tostada Salad was great. Just as I remembered it. Tomato Basil Pasta: Pasta was raw. Brought it to the attention of the server who said it was Al Dente. Maybe I'm missing something and just haven't eaten Al Dente pasta in my life but chewy and hard pasta is not Al Dente. Otherwise, the appropriate flavors were present.  Service: Abysmal. Waitress didn't even do the bare minimum that you expect at a mall based chain restaurant.  In short, poor service and poor quality control means there is a high probability I won't be back."
Tahesha G.,"Tampa, FL",14,183,635,4.0,7/20/2017,"This is my first visit to this location.  It is located as a freestanding location at a mall.    Most restaurants in this area are closed by 10pm, but this location is open until 11.  We ordered carryout. Parking was easy, they have horizontal parking right across from the restaurant.  My order was ready in 15 minutes.  Prices are consistent with similar locations on the west coast.  Overall, a good experience."
Sxholastica Z.,"West Covina, CA",12,19,181,1.0,1/1/2018,They always mess up on our order in this branch  -_- and we come to Cheesecake Factory a lot! They messed up on firecracker salmon appetizer serving us a small plate. Which we payed good money for. And they skim us off. They waitress apparently said they changed their menus every 6 months but we said we went to the Cheesecake Factory 2 months ago in Pasadena and it was completely fine. Then in the beginning they gave us two sourdough breads instead of one brown one and one sourdough one. Then after they knew they were accountable for our Firecracker salmon appetizer they gave us a new batch which was good. But after that they served me Carbonara pasta without the sauce and I was like ok I'm done. I'm not gonna keep complaining cause this is just too much. The whole experience sucked and it New Year's Eve. And the funny thing about the restaurant is it wasn't even pack. We only waited 9 minutes. Not coming back here again.
Miko M.,"Alhambra, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I used to love this place, it was so disappointing!! Burnt to a rock pizza, hard pasta with no sauce & when the manager Amber Nicoles came to speak to my family she called the pizza rustic & charged us for 2 after our waiter order another since the first one was hard as a rock! This was after we waited 45mins to eat! Never again! I won't ever be going back!"
Tiffiny H.,"Arcadia, CA",10,149,69,4.0,10/18/2017,"I only go for the Asian lettuce wraps tacos and the mango key lime cheesecake... And maybe a fruity cocktail or two. Everything mentioned above = super delicious and amazing! If you didn't know, now you know. You're welcome."
Sandy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",567,500,7270,3.0,4/10/2017,"Located at the Westfield Santa Anita Mall, this restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember as one the original ""regular"" restaurants chains in the mall. Fixed between Wood Ranch Grill & the newly opened Benihana, the atmosphere of the space is very similar to the majority of the other Cheesecake Factories around with the dimly lit interior space, comfortable (yet rigid) décor and the whiff of cheesecake in the display cases off to the side as you make your way to the hostess booth.  I arrived on a late Thursday evening and was seated promptly with my party (wait time can really range depending since it could be super busy or flowing traffic with no consistency). Our waitress was super attentive and brought everything to our table timely and refilling our waters often. We ordered a side order fries to share & it was quite yummy... their portion offerings are often quite large enough that you can share them among 2-3 people if you eat family style or if you want to share among yourselves. In addition to the double order of fries, we ordered several pasta dishes as well as their meatloaf. You can always count on Cheesecake Factory to present their foods with good taste and I haven't experienced any really bad service from this place yet.  + Spaghetti & Meatballs with penne substitute: pasta was al dente & the 3 meatballs were nice and moist - not dry at all in the center. But be warned, this isn't consistent since it really depends on how long they leave it cooking. + Famous Factory Meatloaf: Comes with a generous heaping of potatoes, 3-4 slices of meatloaf & a side of greens, this dish was pretty satisfying as well. Meat was thoroughly cooked and not dry at all. + Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (comes with Penne pasta): chicken was delicious and the spicy chipotle creamy sauce hit the spot right on! + Vegetarian twist on the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: this dish has the makings of all that vegetarians love with a carb twist - fresh broccoli, eggplants, peppers, artichokes, etc. all doused with a light olive dressing. Very flavorful and we added extra parmesan cheese for a nice cheesy flavor twist. We finished our meals and were off on our way, full & satisfied. But again, like I said, very typical of other locations and nothing that really sticks out as out of the norm here."
