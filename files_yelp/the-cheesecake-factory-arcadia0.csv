Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",1020,355,67,3.0,7/30/2015,"Although the service and the staff is always bar none, there has been quite a shift in the quality of the food.  Hopefully it was a bad day, but unfortunately my friend and I were both quite shocked that we did not really enjoy our meal. I had the Caesar salad, and usually it's delicious and creamy, but it was sour and vinegary this time around. My friend ordered the cheese pizza and all you could taste was the nearly flavorless crust. Interesting.  It's not to say I wouldn't return to this Cheesecake Factory, I did enjoy my half-off cheesecake (in honor of national cheesecake day!), but fix the Caesar dressing for my sake!"
Stephanie M.,"Pasadena, CA",35,18,34,4.0,1/23/2017,The service is best at the bar. It's good at the tables not great and worst at the take out. I have sat at the bar and the bartender are always attentive. I have also come in with my family and had two different experiences. One was good and the other my five year old was last to be served at out of four Adults. I went to take out recently and stood in front of the girl well she continued a conversation with co-worker. I said Hello after not being greet as I stood in front of her for a few minutes. I expect the same service at ever area of the restaurant but I prefer the bar. The four stars is really just because I have to consider the restaurant as a whole.
David D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/13/2017,"My wife and I plus two friends went to the Arcadia location last weekend.  I ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and sausage that had a spicy sauce.  I asked if it could be made with a milder sauce, to tone down the spices, and the waitress said that they could easily do exactly that.   When my dish was delivered it looked great, but, on further examination, there was no shrimp in the dish!  I had already taken a few bites with sausage before the waitress returned and found that the sauce was extremely spicy and inedible.  I pointed out the problems to her and she took the dish away.  When she finally returned my compatriots had almost finished their dinners while I had only had a small dinner salad.  The waitress told me that the Manager would be dropping by to talk to me shortly.  When he came he asked me if my meal was OK and then left!!!  We love The cheesecake factory near our home, in Mission Viejo, but were EXTREMELY disappointed in this location and will not be returning.  Poor form and service. How do you leave out one of the key ingredients from one of your dishes?"
Dorothy S.,"Temple City, CA",15,5,,5.0,2/25/2017,I rarely write reviews but this time I would like to write it towards the waitress Katelyn we had yesterday for me and my sis birthday. (Yes we are twins!) She is very attentive and also gives us the service better than we expected! The food was great and it is not expensive considering the portion of the food.
Chanica V.,"Los Angeles, CA",527,143,353,3.0,7/8/2015,It's really annoying  that this place doesn't take reservations. We had to wait two hours once for our party of fifteen. When we finally got seated the servers offered us water right away which was nice.  We got the free bread which is honestly one of my favorite things about this place because the wheat bread is just so dang good. I could eat so many of them and would still wanna take some home.  Avocado egg rolls : so delicious. Overpriced for what it is but they do make it perfect every single time  Jambalaya sausage over rice : we got it with brown rice which was too overcooked and soggy. The actual sauce of the Jambalaya didn't have much flavor and the meat it came with was too tough. Don't get this dish  Chinese chicken salad : pretty good dish. I thought they put too much dressing so the lettuce became soggy but the flavor was on point  Garlic noodles with shrimp : my favorite fish because the garlic spaghetti was so good and flavorful. The shrimp was too tough but the overall flavor of the dish was super good  Salmon with mashed potatoes : this dish was good too but not anything special
Gail Z.,"Glendale, CA",92,22,98,3.0,7/14/2015,"Appetizers: dynamite shrimp was really good, especially with the sauce that they provide you with. Tex mix chicken tasted like an avocado egg roll with out the avocado. It was also provided with that sweet teriyaki-like sauce. But i am an avocado lover, so I would go for the avocado egg rolls next time.  We went here for lunch so we got lunch specials/ lunch portion. I got the orange chicken with brown rice. It was only about $12, good portion which got me leaving the place full (I even gave away like 4 pieces of the chicken to my friends). The chicken was white meat, so it tasted fresher and healthier at the same time. The orange chicken taste itself was sweet and not spicy at all. It tasted good, like a high end Panda Express with the right amount of crunch and tenderness.  Cheesecake usually allows you to add salmon to your pasta. But they've never before tried adding catfish on top of the pasta. So I appreciate their willingness to allow my friend to add catfish on top of their pesto flavored pasta :) i liked the fried cat fish. It was tasty fresh and didn't have a lot of salt at all, which I thought it would."
Lupe C.,"Montebello, CA",1,5,6,5.0,3/20/2017,"This place is really expensive but if you come with the right people and get the right server, the price is completely worth it. I got the shepherd's pie and my boyfriend got the spicy cashew chicken. The spicy chicken was amazing with sriracha and the shepherd's pie was amazing. We also got the cucumber lemonade which is divine. Our server, Emily made the experience. She was super sweet and very helpful. She is the whole reason I'm writing this review. GREAT JOB!"
Amanda C.,"Covina, CA",91,32,4,5.0,5/10/2016,"Just had the best service and dinner thanks to Brenda and Gibran.  Brought my mother in law, my grandma, my two toddler boys, and my husband for a late Mother's Day dinner and the experience was just so amazing. Thank you for having such amazing and happy professionals in your work place. Gibran and Brenda - you made my grandmas night a night she won't forget. She doesn't get the opportunity to get out let alone a chance to have such a wonderful meal and desert so her smile and full belly really melts my heart. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Brenda- your professionalism, smile, body language, and eagerness to serve us was everything and more. The egg roll sampler, ahi tartare, and tater tots were so delicious. Looking forward to trying our cheese cake: 30th anniversary, strawberry cheesecake, and Godiva cheesecake.  I ordered the spicy chipotle pasta ( my favorite)  Grandma had the macaroni burger  Mother in law had the chicken Marsala  Kids shared spaghetti and meatball And my husband has the chicken belagio ( his favorite)"
Alicia L.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/12/2017,"Went out for lunch with family for Father's Day. The food was decent, but watch out for the filthy dishes! We had a dirty plate, a fork with lettuce stuck on it, and a drinking glass with lemon seeds still in it. Won't be coming back here anymore."
Kay H.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,175,12,4.0,1/9/2017,"And just to follow up to the manager: Why waste your time trying to ban a loyal customer?  I not only didn't pay for the sandwich, but they were kind enough to comp me for at least two more sandwiches, meaning you lost $30 plus the sandwich, plus the money (usually c. $40) you would have made in two weeks back from me, just because you were being a jerk?  It doesn't make any sense.  Be good to your customers, they are good to your company and staff."
Jade M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",15,109,42,3.0,9/22/2015,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. But I'm also not a fan of shopping. So when I have to spend a few hours at the mall, what better way to start it off than by having a few drinks? Yup...that's what brings me to the Cheesecake Factory. It's located right at the Santa Anita mall. I didn't eat there this time, but I have eaten there before. Their food is decent, nothing too exciting. Service at the bar was good, there was no wait. I've been by before when there is a 2 hour wait to get a table...and people actually wait! I'll be back because of convenience and because they have a full bar."
Charlie Y.,"Beverly Hills, CA",20,2,1,1.0,2/25/2017,"Wait 30 minutes and no one tell us know where our table are. Just said your table in that side. After 5 minutes, no one gave us menu and didn't ask anything. And come back said this is not your table. You should move to other one. The knife set still have the vegetables inside. BAD SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!"
Mary S.,"Monrovia, CA",0,12,1,5.0,8/5/2017,"The food never disappoints...but today we had one of he best waiters in the world. Nope! I am not exaggerating not one bit, our waiter Louis B. was the bomb. You will be super lucky if you come here to enjoy a great meal, some crazy loud ambiance, which I love, and a super friendly and fast waiter. A+ for Lou, as he calls himself!"
Ezzy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,5,5.0,11/11/2016,The ambiance of this place is outstanding but what will keep me coming back is Dustins incredible customer service. Such a great guy with a great sense of humor. Thank you Dustin!
Courtney T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2017,"The worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The hostesses gave our table away and after finding that out, we still waited 10 minutes and we watched 2 large parties get seated before us. None of them apologized for their mistake. After getting seated, we waited another ten minutes for someone to say hello and take our drink orders. Food was average, but the service really ruined the experience for us. Won't come back again."
Billy D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,38,,3.0,1/16/2017,"Had my first bad meal at a Cheesecake. Cheesecake is my family's favorite restaurant. We travel a lot and have eaten at many across the US. Never once had a bad meal. Last night we ate at the Arcadia one for my wife's BDay and although the service was good, the food was not. Food was dry and portions seemed smaller. Ordered cashew chicken-the chicken is usually large pieces and has a pan fry coating with a slight crunch to it. This one had tiny pieces and tasted like it was diced chicken slightly dipped in a sauce. No pan fry. It was also very dry. The garlic mashed potatoes we ordered had no flavor. Definitely missing something. A chicken parm sandwich was dry.  Cheesecake Factory has had great success with all their restaurants throughout the US because they all follow the same recipes, prep and procedures.  Hope this philosophy isn't changing and that they're not turning into a typical chain restaurant."
Sergio D.,"Los Angeles, CA",175,265,1336,4.0,8/27/2015,"The place is good. Most if not all the food I've tried here is really tasty. The desserts here are good too. The choices are there to be made. Simply go and find out what they have. The place can get very busy and filled fast, however the service that they have in this location is excellent. I'm not disappointed with them. Thank you all at Cheesecake Factory. This location is nice. Clean and has lots of parking that is under good servalence. They get my orders right most of the time, now that I recall... they only messed up once with my order. Almost huh. The wait time is not that bad. Last time it was under 10 minutes. Enjoy! Don't Forget to invite me there."
Norma C.,"La Puente, CA",15,3,,2.0,7/30/2017,Definetely not known for their customer service. Waiters standing around chitchatting. Took just as long to wait for dessert and the check. Food was ok that's the only reason I didn't give them one star
Jason D.,"San Gabriel, CA",204,114,501,3.0,5/29/2016,It's always packed here during the weekend. Service is decent as your server will come back to check up on you. They will serve you additional bread upon request. The food served will be in small portions but the delicious cakes will fill you up. I'd recommend the Red Velvet.
Jennifer A.,"West Covina, CA",0,18,1,3.0,1/26/2017,"Nice waitress. My mom got steak well done and the entire center was raw. I ordered Evelyn's favorite pasta without cheese and to be tossed in olive oil. Got it with cheese still and the manager said the dish is already vegan, which isn't true because if it was the waitress would have told me it isn't tossed in butter and that they don't add cheese. Only 3 stars because they took it off the bill, since the pasta literally killed my appetite and I felt like throwing up."
