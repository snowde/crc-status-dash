Irvin A.,"Duarte, CA",24,16,,1.0,3/24/2017,Our server provided us with not so great service  Never asked or came around once to see if we needed anything  we literally had to ask other severs when we needed anything horrible service on her behalf
Charlene L.,"Arcadia, CA",256,337,25,2.0,7/23/2016,"I recently had dinner with my parents at this location and was sadly very disappointed at their service. When we first arrived, the hostess ignored us for a good 5 minutes before someone else came up to us to help us put our name down. She had her head down the whole time and when I tried talking to her, she just ignored me. I understand she may have been busy but she could've at least acknowledged us.  When we were seated, I was shocked to see that they had placed new utensils and plates onto  the table but the table was still littered with bread crumbs and food leftover from the previous party. My ""clean"" napkin had green stains on it and my mom's ""clean"" knife had food stuck to it. We told our waitress shortly after we were seated but no one came to wipe our table down until shortly before our food arrived. Even after reminding the waitress about my dirty napkin and the stained knife twice, we didn't receive them until after the third request much after our food arrived.   After we finished our dishes, we were considering ordering a cheesecake to end the meal. However, our waitress just dropped off our check and walked away. That was our sign that our dinner was over before we were ready for it to end. I was shocked that they did not ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu or asked if we wanted anything else considering this restaurant is known for their cheesecakes. Similarly, the same thing happened to the table next to us.  I'm typically a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but this was by far the worst service I've ever had at any location. Now I know to go to a different location instead. If you want to order cheesecake at this location, it seems like it's better to order it to-go since they don't seem to want to offer it to their dine-in customers."
Deanna H.,"Temple City, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Food tasted great until that night.  My husband had a horrific stomach ache. He ate fettuccine. I had stomach issues through the next day. I had chicken chipotle pasta. Thought it was a coincidence. No! My 6 year old ended up with food poisoning after only eating pepperoni pizza! We all washed our hands before eating. Upon telling friends, I realized I have not been the only one with this issue. Something needs to be done about their practices at this location. Don't eat here unless you want to lose some weight quickly and violently."
Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",145,573,3279,4.0,1/20/2016,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, so when my friends insist in Cheesecake Factory,  my heart (or maybe my stomach) sinks a little.  But I was quite surprised at this location. The staff was very friendly. Our server must have visited us 6 times before we were ready to order (and still we were a little indecisive).  She went over the specials again and we have her a couple of our choices and asked,  ""Which would you pick""  lol.  She gave us a little run down in each choice, ultimately making it our decision and that was great.  She even brought me a small sample of the chicken tortilla soup, add I was in the fence about it. It was really good. And yes, that's what I ended up ordering.  Our drinks were always filled,  plates swept away, and dessert options announced. Mmmmm desserts. Wait! Mmmm CHEESECAKE!  Yes I know we are at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes I know I'm going to want cheesecake. Why why why do I fill up on the free bread?  Oh yea because it's warm and delicious. So, nope... no room for the yummy cheesecake. And averaging the cost of a small meal,  my check book says that was good of me.  I would love to see this place add small small bite size desserts to their meal. That gives people the sweet taste after a meal and makes them want to bring home a slice or whole pie. I just dint get why more places haven't re adopted this way of eating. Courses!  I think that's why I eat at home so often.  I want a small salad or soup and a small meal and a taste of sweet. But not so I can bring home a bunch of leftovers that won't get eaten and not a bill that costs $30 for one person's lunch. I'm just saying.  But overall we really enjoyed this place! The servers were great. The bathrooms were clean. There's plenty of parking. And the mall is right there to walk off that meal right after.  Thanks"
Michelle G.,"Argenta, IL",50,118,25,3.0,3/18/2016,"This is my second time at this location. It was like night and day from my first visit which was nothing less than amazing! This time around we were seated right away, there was no wait time. Maria was our server. She started off by mixing our drinks up. I ordered a cherry coke and my Husband ordered a Diet coke. I received a regular coke and he ended up with a Cherry Diet Coke.  After we ordered we received everything but my husbands Salad which our waitress forgot about. I don't know if she was flustered from getting our drinks wrong and just forgot? Either way my husband wasn't satisfied with his small shrimp, mashed potato and steak dish. He received I think 3 cut up tiny pieces of steak, and 3 shrimp were on the plate. Even I was disappointed and I didn't have to eat it. It was an over priced dish for sure! I ordered the pork chop dish again and this time it didn't seem to have the same delicious taste as last time.  After our mishap with Maria I will say this, She was super attentive to us in regards to refills and kept checking in on us a lot which I sincerely appreciated!! She was still great regardless of the mess ups. While we were eating a employee brought a side of fries and dropped them off at our table. Now we didn't order that or were expecting it but found out the table next to us was. That was awkward for all of us. Honestly I would go back and give them another chance because the first visit was so great and even Maria tried to make up for our not so great visit which is appreciated"
Jennifer C.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,100,4,4.0,10/1/2017,"For a chain restaurant, not a bad value and menu selection. The staff are always friendly and the food always comes out fast. My only critique is that they have poor timing. The appetizers and the entree come out too close together and my main dish always gets cold."
Amy W.,"San Jose, CA",15,27,9,4.0,2/27/2017,"4 stars based on my last visit. 45 min wait for 4 around 7pm on a Sunday. Friendly staff at the host stand. Is it just me or did the chefs at this location up their game? I had dinner there yesterday and had the bbq ranch salad, pasta da vinci, chicken sliders, and jamacian shrimp. Cheesecake factory has always been a 3 star restaurant for me in terms of food taste but last night made it a 5 star. We loved everything we had and everything felt like it was freshly chopped, cooked, and fried. The food was on point. Deducting 1 star for our server. He was great when he was present at our table. He refilled water voluntarily, packed our food, and was observant. HOWEVER, we spent alot of time waiting for him because he was just absent. The server at the table next to us was constantly there but ours only came 3x during our dining experience there."
Araceli H.,"Los Angeles, CA",168,10,,3.0,5/21/2017,"If you want to wait 2 hours to be seated for a party of 10, then this place is for you. We even called ahead of time to let them know a party of 10 will be dinning in and still waiting that long.  When I received my food other food was mixed in with it that wasn't suppose to be in there. I asked what it was & they were kind of enough to take it back & make me a whole new plate. I also got my meal paid as well. Overall the experience was ok but not great.  Thank you"
Jessi M.,"San Gabriel, CA",114,10,,4.0,9/14/2017,"Here's the thing, if you order food to be picked up you should expect your order to be messed up in some way. This goes for the pasadena location as well. I've ordered food 3 times from here in the past month and each time the order wasn't good. First order they didn't give me 3 of the 6 items I ordered. Second time the food was cold. And just now I got an incorrect dressing for my salad. I would give this review a 3 star but the food is very good so I'll give it a 4 star. I highly recommend getting all the staff to do some sort of training in terms of duplicating orders because there seems to be an issue with that."
T R.,"San Francisco, CA",6,14,8,5.0,9/21/2017,"cheesecake is very good, great location, spacious mall parking, very good staff, great cakes. What more can you ask for?"
Nina S.,"Arcadia, CA",0,11,2,5.0,9/21/2017,I have been coming here for 10 years! They have the best pasta!!  The service was really good too either if you buy food to go or dine in. It gets pretty crowded in the weekend tho because it's located by the mall.
Mark W.,"Duarte, CA",13,47,10,5.0,7/4/2017,"Dinner was awesome as usual, I had the BAM-BAM CHICKEN AND SHRIMP and Donna had the BAR-B-QUE  BURGER and now topping it off with strawberry cheesecake"
Leslie T.,"Santa Ana, CA",280,213,83,3.0,11/7/2015,"I used to come here since I was little. It was my favorite place and I had spent birthdays there too. The food quality has gone down hill, so has the quality in servers. I almost always have to ask for bread, and my refill never comes until I'm finished with my plate. I'm just tired of such low quality food and service when this place costs way more than that. Not worth it, I would just take my butt over to wood ranch instead of here.  I ordered the bow tie pasta, it was bland."
Tasha M.,"Long Beach, CA",26,178,75,3.0,7/24/2017,The food is not amazing but our server was great which is why I'm giving a 3 star review!!! I guess it's not the same quality as years ago but at least the server we had was great and very accommodating. Basic food nothing fancy at all!!
Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, CA",947,1248,244,4.0,6/5/2016,"*** Well-run, beloved chain. Consistency is key *** Cheesecake Factory is an oldie but a goodie. I have ordered the same favorite dish for decades...LOL. the thing about that is that i used to try new dishes when i visited, but it left me wishing i had just ordered my fave. CHICKEN MADEIRA - thin chicken breast with madeira sauce, mushrooms, cheese, asparagus with mashed potatoes. Mmm... i usually split the chicken madeira since CF portion size is generous. for those who say that CF is expensive, they probably don't share an entree. if i order the chicken madeira myself, i would have to box half of it up. if you don't, that is why america is obese.  food comes out in a timely manner. this is one of the biggest reasons i go there, besides the food. when you have such a well-run chain, you get efficiency. also, my fave appetizer are the avocado eggrolls. they are premade. they have cilantro which is highly dislike...but this is still my favorite appetizer. what does that tell you? ha.  i've had the eggroll platter, the one where you get 4 different kinds of eggrolls, but that was overwhelming. would be good to share if you had more people with you. their salads are huge. you can't go wrong with most of the menu.  however, i must say that the most disappointing thing i have ever ordered was the soup. way too salty. i couldn't take more than two spoonfuls. i never get to eating cheesecake but if i were to recommend one, it would be the vanilla bean. i had it at a party...best cheesecake ever."
Jay C.,"San Gabriel, CA",115,11,,1.0,1/7/2017,"45 minutes, still no sign of food after ordering. Tables that were seated after us (10-20minutes after we were seated) already got their food and eating already...  Their excuse ""chef in training."" So... only our order gets delayed, out of 4 other tables seated after us?  *new update Two tables have finished and left already. So from our server he came and informed us (@ the 20 min mark) that they had a chef in training. As we neared the 50 minute mark he informed us that he would get a manager to speak to us.  A manager walked by just asking table to table how things were and was unaware of the situation. So we explained to him what has happened so far. He said he would look into it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says it is the servers fault and we shouldn't have to endure this. I am just thinking, why are you stating the obvious? He goes on to say, for your trouble we can give you a slice of cheese cake on the house... seriously? You ruined dinner, made us wait, made excuses and all you could do was offer a slice of cheesecake for two people? I guess there is no reputation that Cheesecake Factory has, except for half ass apologies and excuses as to why things went bad."
Kinesha S.,"Alhambra, CA",2,32,13,1.0,12/12/2016,"My husband and I went here on a Sunday night. It didn't take too long to get seated. It was moderately busy, so that was great. We were seated right before the two people at a table next to us. My husband immediately noticed the table was dirty and proceeded to clean it, before I sat down. After sitting, I noticed my small plate was dirty. My husband gave me his, but that one also had food on it. When the table next to us sat down, immediately the server, Christopher, greeted them and took their drink orders. We still waited for Christopher to come to our table. The table next to us got their drinks and bread, yet my husband and I were still waiting. Finally, Christopher came to our table. We told him about the dirty dishes and he just said ""uh-oh."" Christopher takes our drink orders and then took the meal order for the table next to us. After awhile, he brings water that we didn't ask for. And we wait...the table next to us get their food and we're still waiting for our drinks and bread.  Christopher finally brings the drinks and bread. He left then came back and dropped off plates. Another 10 minutes goes by or so and he takes our order. After another long wait, my husband gets his appetizer. After that, we saw Christopher pass by a couple of times and yell out something like still waiting, without even stopping at our table. After the table next to us are done eating, he immediately took their plates away and joked with them. He then came back and gave them their check. The table left. That was it! I went to the hostess stand to find three employees chatting with each other as I stood there. I called out excuse me loudly and asked for the manager. They quickly dispersed and one went to find the manager.  The manager, Shannon, came out and I told her about my horrible experience and still no food. She quickly apologized and said she would check on the order and comp the entrees. I went back to my table and the table next to us have already left. Shortly after, Christopher comes over and asks if we want more bread and apologized for the wait. Completely fake! He didn't care. Shannon came over and again apologized and offered us a drink and we declined stating that we just wanted our food.  The food finally comes and Christopher haphazardly thanked us for our patience. The food was great. After we paid, Shannon came over again and asked if we wanted dessert to take with us on them and we declined. As we left, no one at the hostess stand said anything to us. The restaurant was pretty empty by then. Earlier, I had noticed the hostesses excitedly wishing leaving patrons a good night and thanking them for coming in.  I know this place has the worse reviews, but I had never been treated so badly there. Christopher not only serviced someone who sat down after us so quickly, but he didn't even care about how he wasted our time. Time is something we will not get back. We don't need food compensated. We have money to pay for what we want. I just don't understand why we were treated like that. And I would hate to think about ethnicity. Christopher is black and so am I. The table next to us were Hispanic. My husband is white. All of this shouldn't matter and hope it didn't matter to Christopher. However, I do hope he's now looking for another job."
Esther K.,"Arcadia, CA",315,825,2224,5.0,8/13/2016,"So I have become a complete Cheesecake Factory convert since I last reviewed this place. It turns out... you have to be able to eat BREAD/CARBS in order to enjoy this place! I didn't mention it in my last review but I was on a gluten-free diet when I came here... and that really makes a world of difference. Why? Because their complimentary bread here is AMAZING. The dark wheat bread that they give you is so good! I always ask for a second basket because I basically inhale that bread... mmmmmmm... Anyway, my friend JC who is the reason why I love Cheesecake Factory yelled at me when she found out I ordered steak here. She said that was a horrible mistake and of course I wouldn't like them if I did not eat their bread and I ordered steak. What is this place, a steakhouse?! Now I order smarter and I always enjoy my food here :D"
Vy T.,"Rosemead, CA",105,39,41,3.0,3/25/2017,"Over priced, slow service, food was so so. We went for lunch and sat outside. The patio is cramped and hard for people to walk through.  Here's what we got: Ahi Tartare - pretty good, lots of avacado, the fried wontons strips were overly oily, not the freshest tuna but what do you expect from a chain restaurant. It was a small portion, good for two people.  Fried Zucchini - pretty typical. They used the perfect amount of oil to get a nice crispy outside and juicy inside. Tossed Garden Salad - large size for an appetizer. We got basamic dressing and it was great! The croutons were super hard though. I would suggest skipping yhe croutons. Bang-bang chicken - terrible! The description said... Spicy. But it was not at all spicy. It was super sweet with dried coconut on top. They need to go light on the coconut. It was way to sweet. For a dish that is called bang bang chickent, i wasnt expecting for it to have shrimp. Tiramisu Cheesecake - the best dessert in the world!!! Only reason we come here. Not too rich and not too sweet."
Rizzo G.,"Monterey Park, CA",52,26,,5.0,8/13/2017,Another review about great customer service provided by our server name Lou. From the minute that we walked in and we were seated he was on top of his game from the service you provided to the food that he got tour table in the amount of times he checking on us. He asked us for food was if there was anything we needed and just his all-around customer service was top notch. If you guys come to this location I recommend that you ask for him and you will not be disappointed guaranteed. Thank you Lou for the customer service you provided today
