Meilyn A.,"Arcadia, CA",155,124,197,4.0,1/31/2017,"Came on a Monday night to celebrate with my family. I've been coming here for a long time and I really do love coming here, but yesterday was a particularly busy night and so the customer service and the quality of food suffers a bit. Things I love getting: 1. Avocado Egg Rolls (appetizer): If you love avocado and a zesty, tasty sauce, with a nice crunch this appetizer is for you 2. Chicken & Biscuits: This was something incredibly surprising for me, usually people don't think to order this dish at The Cheesecake Factory but it's everything you dream about when you think (southern comfort). Give it a try! 3. Burgers and Smoothies 4. Cheesecake: There's just a long list of amazing cheesecakes but my top two choices have always been the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake. Bread is refillable and drinks can be taken to-go. Make sure you make a reservation if you've got a big party, or you will probably have to wait a while. Great place to celebrate with your family and friends."
Mercedes V.,"Covina, CA",0,58,43,5.0,4/14/2017,My boyfriend and I came to eat here yesterday. First time there.  It had lots of space. Nice people. Nice romantic lighting.  I love how the eating booths give u privacy. The waiter was nice.  The bread is really good. The food was delicious!! The food has a lot of flavor. Many many choices.  There's all kinds of food you can think of. They also have valet parking. Definitely going back.
Judyy G.,"San Gabriel, CA",99,1,1,4.0,8/22/2017,"I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for more years than I can imagine! During my high school years was when they opened (10+ years now) I never cared for their food because I never knew what to order. I always stuck with the same food. It wasn't only until recently I started trying out some new dishes like the Chicken Madeira, Pasta DiVinci (along with all the other flavorful pastas they have) , and the most appealing dish to me was their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. I've never had gumbo before (I've only heard about on TV shows) so I thought I'd give it a try. And the minute I tasted a few bites I fell in love. Their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo is extremely flavorful, so full of different spices all mixed together in a thick, soupy texture mixed with rice that gets your mouth watering with every bite you take. I'll definitely be coming back for more of that Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo for sure! However, it is on the little more spicy side, so if u can't handle mild spicy, I suggest u ask the server to make it less to non-spicy. Other than that, their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo is extremely delicious! It's a must try!"
Tammy W.,"Alhambra, CA",843,280,2196,4.0,9/8/2015,"My family and I always go here because it's in the malls and close to where we live. We usually come here to catch up with other family members, birthdays, and celebrations. Overall the food is good, but it can sometimes be very oily and salty!  Appetizers: avocado egg rolls are so good! It's crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the inside! It comes with a special sauce to dip with, but there's only 6! :( wish they gave more, but it's just an appetizer so I guess it's ok haha I've also tried the fried zucchini, portobello mushroom, and avocado. This is also really good! It comes with 2 types of sauce with complements the fried goods.  Entree: my favorite dish here is the Louisiana chicken pasta hands down! It's a bow tie pasta with a delicious sauce and crispy chicken! The chicken pieces are huge too! I usually eat half and save the other half for tomorrow or share with someone. Some other dishes I like is their miso salmon, chicken Bellagio, shrimp scampi, and their luau salad!  Dessert: cheesecake is a must! They have so many different kinds and they're all good! Any of the chocolate ones are good, white chocolate raspberry, and kahlua!  Try to come 30-45 min before you actually want to eat because it does get crowded!!"
David l.,"Encinitas, CA",117,81,153,4.0,1/14/2016,"Always delicious! I ordered the Greek salad which is a great option if you want a light veggie salad. I also had their Arnold Palmer which is so good with the rock sugar on the rim of the cup. My wife had the tacos and a mojito.  She live the mojito's here because they are very refreshing.  The tacos come with 4 tacos and is plenty to share for the both of us.  Then we ordered the chocolate cake after.  The cake is rich but smooth.  After all said and done we still had leftovers to take with us.  The only thing is my constant major complaint is the lighting in the evening is very dim so it makes lengthy dinners tiresome because your serotonin levels start rising in dim lighting.  Overall cheese cake is always dependable and always a delightful time.   Tip - Order the Carmel macchiato with a shot of baileys to wake up and keep the evening moving forward.  Cons - The evening usually has long waits so be ready for a wait, The lighting can be a little tiresome  Pros - Absolute dependability from the menu! Beautiful environment! Great service!"
Dora B.,"Pasadena, CA",6,36,60,5.0,2/25/2017,My dinner was superb! The ahi carpaccio is delicious!!! My favorite by far! Unfortunately I heard it's being taken off the menu. Please don't! The crusted ahi with wasabi was my favorite and then it was removed from the menu. Please bring it back! I might have to give The Cheesecake a one star if they keep removing my favorite dishes off the menu.
Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2166,1132,7048,3.0,7/31/2015,"It seem each time I come, their food quality is worst than previous visit.... This is my third visit during their annual Cheesecake national day which they offer half off in all their cheesecake slice.   I ordered their gumbo, the portion is pretty big and easily be share by 2 peoples if they not too hungry.  You can choose brown or white rice which is nice.  The presentation is excellent, but taste is different story.  There was way too many white chicken pieces on the gumbo, I never see gumbo with chicken.  There was 5 times more chicken than sausages !!! If you gonna order this dish request no chicken !  The broth was not usualy gumbo tasted and was overall pretty mediocre and a bit disappointing dish.  I try their Tiramisu and Reese Cheesecake this time.  I like the reese a bit better and has a lot of different flavors and nice chocolate chips in the side.  The Tiramisu wasn't that good in my opinion.  The best part of the cheesecake actually is the white cream lol."
Scotty P.,"Arcadia, CA",0,74,,4.0,2/20/2017,"Always pretty busy (no reservations available) so come with patience and a little in your stomach. Service is pretty solid considering the inside traffic. Their food is great! So much to choose from. I'm a big fan of their Kobe Burger which comes with nicely sautéed mushrooms and this killer spicy sauce.  Keep in mind the parking is ridiculous! People get pretty aggressive too so use caution when parking, but don't let the boneheads keep you away from a great meal."
Nicole G.,"San Gabriel, CA",254,80,307,4.0,7/6/2016,"Food is usually on point if you know what to order. Faves so far are chicken bellagio & chicken madeira. Pastas are also all good, but you can't really go wrong with that. Complimetary bread is soo addicting... that brown bread though.. mm... Service is also always exceptionally good. You can always count on CF on providing a great time unless if you're on a time crunch because wait times during peak hours can get pretty scary."
Dr. A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,48,48,4.0,7/31/2016,"I've always enjoyed coming to cheesecake factory coz I've never been disappointed with service, selection of food and ambience. I like how it's been consistent thus far (from east coast- Florida to west coast-cali)...we came in for the national cheesecake day and purchased 2 slices of cheesecake for 1/2 price...so good! We got banana cream cheesecake---winner!! It was refreshing, not too rich, heavy or sweet unlike the outrageous cheesecake.  Lesson learned- I will stick with classic flavors and not the fancy ones."
Jeff C.,"San Gabriel, CA",196,6,4,1.0,6/14/2017,Sat down during happy hour and 40 mins in no food. Pretty disappointed . Asked for refill on water 20 mins and counting . This is sad lol . Table next to us sat down same time as us and had the food came in less than 10 mins. I got so hungry I ate all the butter.
Irene N.,"West Covina, CA",6,12,16,1.0,11/6/2016,hostess very rude and condescending.  Not a  good start for a visit to the Cheese Cake Factory..
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",866,705,1110,5.0,8/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites! If you don't already know, their wheat bread (or as I like to call it the chocolate bread) are to die for. I always ask for extras just because it's so delicious. I came with two of my girlfriends for a late lunch and our server Steven knew how much we loved it that he gave us each a loaf and another two each to take home --such great service even if it's complimentary! Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries ($6.95). They were super delicious and did not disappoint at all. I actually couldn't even finish it all, but it's going to become a must order for me to share as an appetizer in the future. My usual order here is the Louisiana chicken pasta ($16.95). It's seriously my favorite pasta and I'm also a huge fan of bowtie pasta. I love the way they cook up their crispy chicken mixed with the sauce. This place does not disappoint and I don't care how many calories is in it --worth the splurge every once in awhile. Their portions are huge and it's always nice to be able to savor your food for home too!"
Rodel P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,38,64,4.0,5/12/2016,"I've been to this restaurant several times in the last few years, the service is always the same - good to very good. The place is very classy, but there is no dress code. Since this place is located in the mall, I highly doubt they would require a 'coat & tie' for dinner guest. The restaurant in Pasadena has mostly 'business' people as the primary clientele.  We usually come here for lunch or early dinner - the 'lunch specials' are a good value. The last time I was here, we ordered the California Cheesesteak, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and a Tiramisu Cheesecake for dessert - It was very good.  I would say though that the pictures on the website menu section seems like a much larger portion than the one they serve on the table. Other than that, the quality and portion does not disappoint.  The Renee's Special and Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms are also very good."
Poke G.,"Monterey Park, CA",20,23,18,3.0,11/6/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory.  What more can you expect from a restaurant that is famous for its cheesecakes. The qualities of pasta, sandwiches, salads, and steaks are just about the same as other restaurants that charge the same prices as they do. But, what separates them from other restaurants that are in line with their pricing are the service and the advice that you will be receiving from the waiters and waitresses before, during, and after the meals.  They know how to make the patrons feel what a dining experience should be like. Its brand will live on for as long as they have been in  business which is farther away than an unforeseeable future."
Guido53 G.,"San Gabriel, CA",38,26,6,5.0,10/11/2016,"I went in this past Sunday with my kids. From the moment we sat down we were greeted by Emily (unk last name). She was quick, accurate and very personal. Our meal came out so fast I had to question if it was really my order. Emily said, ""its all yours, enjoy it!"" Well I did and it was great. I wish I could have given her a bigger tip. The CheeseCake Factory needs to promote Emily and have her train all the new servers. She is a natural!! Go in and ask for Emily as your server, I will!"
Jimmy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,40,30,2.0,10/18/2016,"Female asian bartender is super rude.  Came here with a friend of mine on my lunch break and decided to sit at the bar cause we didn't want to wait for a table. I was in a great mood and from the get-go, she wasn't friendly.  Not even a hello.  She then asked in the most unenthusiastic tone ""...anything to drink?"" I literally looked at her, didn't respond, took our menus, and decided to move to the adjacent bar tables. One stars for our server who was nice and attentive.  Two stars for their great lunch happy hour!"
Karen L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",246,340,482,4.0,10/15/2015,"Brunch on Sunday, 10/11/15 They open at 10am on Sunday so we decided to enjoy brunch. Parking lot was empty so we had a choice in where to park. There was no wait in line and the staff members were very friendly. The ambiance is casual with TVs for entertainment. The menu is the same so just flip to the Sunday brunch menu right before the dessert page. I felt like pasta so the server recommended the Jambalaya served with shrimp and chicken. I also tried the Factory Huevos Rancheros and the lemon-ricotta pancakes. The Rancheros were delicious especially with the soft flavorful black beans and all the condiments layered on top. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were good since it wasn't too dense or tart. The Jambalaya gave a kick of spiciness so I enjoyed it. It's just really filling with it's large portion. We finished off with a birthday sundae and a pumpkin cheesecake. The sundae was ordinary but I liked it because it was chocolate. The pumpkin cheesecake tasted like a creamy version of a pumpkin pie without the crust. It was just something I had to get for the holiday season. My favorites so far would be the steak Diane and the shrimp scampi. They taste great although I haven't tried most of the items on the menu. I really enjoyed the bruschetta before they took it out. I'll have to come back again and try the long list of other items. Overall, Cheesecake Factory keeps their service and food consistent. I'm glad there wasn't a wait in line for Sunday brunch. Aside from the usual wait, I really enjoy having meals at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jeff T.,"Alhambra, CA",239,386,2006,3.0,4/17/2016,"It has its pros and cons.  To start, this location is particularly busy, being part of the Santa Anita Mall.  The wait can get pretty crazy, but they have those buzzer things they give you to let you know when your table is ready.  Restaurant ambience is pretty nice and dim, but not sure if its date night material, considering the sheer volume of people and loudness.  Good for group events though. The bread they start you off with is amazingly addictive; at least the brown bread is.  If you're not careful, this can end up being your entire meal.  This last time I went, I shared the factory combo of the Steak Diane + Salmon (served with mashed potatoes) and a small-dish beet salad w/goat cheese.  I asked for medium-rare for the Steak Diane and it came in more of a rare/med-rare, which I wouldn't normally mind, but it was a bit too chewy and tough.  More of a preference thing, but the mashed potatoes were a bit too chunky for me.  The herb-crusted salmon was fine though.  Lastly, the beet salad was delicious, but we just wished they had a large plate option.  I wasn't a huge fan of the combo meal, but would recommend the Chicken Bellagio w/Pesto Pasta instead.  If you happen to be on a diet or watching what you eat, they do have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  Everything outside of this will easily break your calorie budget.  Would recommend if you've just finished shopping and don't have the energy to go elsewhere, but there's also Woodranch next door if you're more of a bbq type."
Erika M.,"El Monte, CA",0,5,1,5.0,8/7/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has the best salads ever! I really enjoyed their Barbecue Chicken Salad, everything paired perfectly with each other. The guac and chips were delicious but not spicy enough for my taste. Our server, Sean was excellent, kind, and fast to bring everything out. Thank you for your awesome service. Also, the carrot cheesecake is to die for."
