Nirmeen S.,"Chino Hills, CA",36,108,126,4.0,12/30/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! They always have so many options on the menu (almost too many), but there is truly something for everyone. I went here with 2 of my friends and one of them got the chicken picatta, and another ordered their sausage and shrimp pasta (which looked so good!) I really enjoyed the flat bread and the soup and would def order them again!"
Karina R.,"El Monte, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/5/2017,"the wait for a table was the worst experience. Our pager went off meaning it was our turn to be seated. They don't sit you right away you just wait a side with other parties who pagers went off. We notice that the other parties got seated and not us. My name never got call and yet they call out other names who seem to not be there?! It was a crowded but yet they A group of host in front but they seem to not communicate and skip us. We waited longer than others and keep in mind it was hot! Finally, we got our table. Our server STEPHEN S. Made us happy. As busy as it was he still pass by took our order well carrying other dishes. Got all orders correct and on time. The food was good and the service at the table was excellent. I suggest not going on a crowded night because they can't keep track of pagers and name."
climber O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,60,44,5.0,1/22/2017,"We had a large party of 12 last night for my nephew's birthday.   We sat outside with heat lamp, and it was very nice.   The service is great.  The brown bread was really delicious. What I also really liked was the addition of vegan menu items.  Avocado toast had a nice kick to it.  The vegan Cobb salad was filling, refreshing, and tasty.  It had green beans, pine nuts, quinoa, beets.  It was awesome!  Way to go Cheesecake Factory to include vegan items!!"
Stephanie K.,"San Marino, CA",13,10,16,1.0,7/19/2017,"Going to the cheescake factory is great but don't use them with Doordash delivery or you will miss out on half your dinner. We use doordash and normally get good food delivered with no issue but NOT TODAY. Half our order showed up and when we called the Arcadia, CA Cheesecake factory the young women who answered the phone said ""what do you want me to do?"" like we should not be compensated or have the reminder of our order sent out. When then asked for a manager and she just put on hold and left us there. So we called back and we transferred to the bakery.  SO DISAPPOINTED. It's expensive and to receive half you meal without the willingness to fix it not acceptable for such a large establishment. Will not order from here again. So Arcadia, CA Cheesecake Factory shame on you, half an order, cold food and no willingness to help or be respectful when we called to fix the problem."
Danny H.,"Westminster, CA",44,1,,1.0,8/3/2017,This place has super bad customer service.. from the first time u walk in the receptionist is hella rude and for a party of 10 we waited over 2 hours to get seated.... unless your Asian u will wait along time to get a seat in this restraunt....
Soniia J.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,5,1,1.0,5/15/2017,"Came here for Mother's Day and it was horrible. First of all we arrived at 3 and were seated at 6. Then I asked what kind of soups they had because it wasn't on the menu. Only to find out they only have one! What a disappointment. I ended up ordering the one soup they had which I believe was chicken artichoke with mushrooms and it was ok, I didn't even finish it. I then wished I never ate it. My boyfriend ordered the steak and was as well disappointed. Someone else order the chicken enchiladas and they said it tastes nothing like enchiladas but pure onions . I could have had something to eat from the food court in the mall and would have been happier with the food than at this place. Never again will I come here. Worst Mother's Day dinner ."
Rachel K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",206,6,,1.0,5/10/2017,"Soo... I was wondering why the food came out so fast wen I ordered for pick up. And it was cuz I ordered the chicken bellagio and it was missing literally half the ingredients (missing the arugula and prosciutto) and they packaged the chicken in with the pasta so wen I went to go eat it 10-15 min later the chicken got all soggy... thanks cheesecake... and I also got gipped on the crab cakes, like hell I know I get more than just 3 tiny lil patties."
Richard C.,"San Gabriel, CA",36,9,,4.0,8/1/2017,"The service was great, food was solid. Went there on an afternoon and there was no wait. The waiter constantly asked if we wanted more bread. The price is a little bit expensive but it was worth the quality."
Salvador R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,5,1,2.0,5/7/2017,"The 2 stars is mainly based on the service. Came in today after walking the arboretum sat down and waited for a good 10min and no waiter in sight to offer us drinks or anything, after another minute or so we decided to get up and walk out when we approached the front we mentioned to the host about the waiting issue and how we were going to be leaving to where he took no initiative to even apologize nor try to sit us anywhere else or even being in a manager, his only response was ""OK"" seriously, no customer service skills whatsoever."
Kim T.,"San Gabriel, CA",351,876,5767,5.0,4/23/2015,"Thanks for Mom's Birthday lunch, Boss! In honor of Administrative Professional Day (04.22.15), I got a gift card from my Boss and took my Mom out for an early Mommy Daughter birthday lunch. It was pretty cool that lunch here is served until 5pm and so we took advantage of that. It's been a while since we've eaten here and so we had an Italian lunch. We got the following items: Full size Everything Pizza with Salad: Mom and I loved the pizza and it was delicious.  Wasn't too spicy or peppery and Mom gulped down half of her pizza slices. Usually, she's not much of a pizza fan, but this one she digged. It had the small pepperonis, sausage, mushrooms and red onions. Topped with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The salad was fresh and plentiful with arugula and radicchio and the dressing with tangy and sweet also with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese.  The chicken piccatta: the chicken steak was pound out thinly and with creamy sauce and spaghetti and a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The spaghetti was soft and Al dente. Though Mom wasn't a fan of this one since there wasn't even sauce to mix the spaghetti with. I didn't mind this one and it made for a nice lunch to take to work tomorrow.  The avocado eggrolls: soft creamy avocados rolled into an egg roll and I dug it. Mom being the eggrolls making Queen giggle at this American creation, but she actually liked it as well. We both ate 3 each and saved two for me to take to lunch tomorrow. I loved the dipping sauce too - sweet pesto basil sauce, yum! Finally, the crew sang Happy Birthday to my mom with a cheesecake slice. (The cheesecake was light and creamy and mixed with chocolate sauce and whipped cream...O.M.G..yum!!!). Mom was blushing, but giggle and enjoyed the finale, lol! Service with Mickey was friendly and attentive and he packed up our leftovers for us. Overall, it was nice eating out at a different American restaurant.  Thanks again for Mom's early Birthday lunch, Boss!"
Alex C.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4,82,17,1.0,7/14/2017,"I love cheesecake factory I ain't going to lie lets get that out the way.... Now what went down this past weekend was bad,horrible and sucked donkey balls. all I wanted was a booth for the misses and I who were both looking forward to breakfast but it turned into a nightmare that the GREETER took care of for me.10 minute wait is what he said 25 minutes later nothing got worked out till I asked for the manager because the GREETER has the worst attitude on planet earth,The GREETER looked like he didn't even I want to be there the by way his uniform was on. I got the manager  who promised the world all because her employees were running late I do understand people run late but let me know that way I can say put me in a table and lets get my breakfast going. Manager walks me to my booth and says ""ILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOUR WARM BREAD""she never came back and neither did the bread,We finally order our drinks arnold palmer and an oj TA DAAAAA when he comes back with the drinks my oj is missing because the machine is broken.Now is it me or did they just say lets just make his experience even worse maybe he'll leave because that's what I did.From the GREETER to the MANAGER bad customer care from jump street. Manager doesn't care if I stay or not she gets paid and the greeter he can give two @#$%^ about me staying or leaving but its not about them two its about the waiter who loses  out on his tip that he works for but the manager and the greeter can care less about his tips."
Carla M.,"Chino, CA",660,82,8,2.0,5/1/2017,So disappointed in the horrible service I received Saturday night. Went in for some late night cheesecake and couldn't believe how bad and slow service was. This is actually my favorite food chain because the service is usually worth every penny but not here. The cheese cake was delicious as always so I am hoping was just that late night shift or area. Will try bar area next.
Van R.,"Glendale, CA",0,17,8,4.0,7/10/2017,Good Cheesecake Factory. Great fast service. Cheesecake is delicious. Will come here for overpriced pasta again lol.
Brittany R.,"Alhambra, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/5/2017,"This service that they provide is amazing, not only to us but all customers coming in around us as well. All waiters and waitress have big smiles on their face and try to make their customers feel as comfortable as possible, this male waiter was trying his best for another man to hear the Super Bowl game tv louder. I'm not sure if he did but he kept him updated that he's figuring out a way to. My waitress was extremely nice to us and made my mood rise up, I do always come here and everyone always makes me remember why every time.  I recommend that you come to this Cheesecake Factory because they're extremely quick to seat you and have amazing customer service, besides the fact that their food and drinks are mind blowing! Definitely going to come back again soon!"
Kevin W.,"Temple City, CA",499,1787,7849,2.0,4/17/2015,"Downgrade on the score! Service was slow even though we came at opening, was not even packed!!! I hate when you want to pay and leave and it takes 15 minutes to find your damn server! Factory Burrito Grande - $14.50 - Price went up from the last time I had it. Still the same burrito. Annoyed that they gave us a tablespoon of guacamole for a 14 inch 3 pound burrito! I asked for more since this was way to little and she literally brought me another tablespoon. How cheap can you be! Chinese Chicken Salad - $14.95 - Same price, same good salad! White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake - $7.50 - I could not take the white chocolate in the cheesecake but the macadamia was a nice crunch. Caramel adds a nice gooey sweetness. This piece was SOO SMALL.  Adam Peanut Butter Cheesecake - $7.50 - Normal cheese cake stuffed with peanut butter cups! Cheesecake with peanut butter and chocolate, best combo you can ask for. This piece was SOO SMALL.  I am so disappointed that they are so cheap on stuff now!"
Darlene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",453,961,54,3.0,9/4/2016,"I've been to cheesecake factory countless times, and mainly with my mother. She loves this place, not sure why, but she does and I will not hold her against it. Their menu is a tad too big for me and too many options. A dish I tend to go back for is their AHI TUNA TARTARE. It's a very nice appetizer dish with ginger and avocado. Service is always good. :) ENJOY!"
Prudence M.,"Temple City, CA",0,17,1,1.0,12/4/2016,This place it's become all about getting you in and out!! Paid about $14.00 for two oily eggs a toast and burnt greasy potatoes!! Overrated! Service is horrible!! You are lucky if you get a nice caring waitress or waiter.  They are all frustrated! It's a Mac house in here!!
Noreen W.,"Alhambra, CA",66,4,15,4.0,4/9/2017,"My favorite dishes are the avocado eggrolls and the sweet corn tamale cakes. The avocado eggrolls come with 6 eggrolls with tangy and creamy fillings held together by crispy eggroll shells, and a sweet gingery sauce on the side, altogether a very refreshing dish. The sweet corn tamale cakes are sweet and thick, with diced avocados, fresh tomato salsa, and cream cheese on top. It's a hot dish so best to eat it right when it's served. Both dishes are appetizers. If you don't have a big stomach, those appetizers are perfect with a main entrée for two or three people. Servers are always polite and respectful."
Joshua H.,"Kirkland, WA",0,36,2,2.0,10/13/2017,Do not order from here through a delivery service. Food is always given to the driver very late even when the restaurant isn't busy. My take is that they are upset that people aren't dining in (read: staff doesn't get tips on take out orders).
Triplet C.,"Walnut, CA",64,10,5,5.0,6/25/2017,I am very happy with tonite's dining experience. My fish was good and my service was A+. Caris and Katie were outstanding and very courteous. The new dish Crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp is really good and recommended.
