方巾,"Cambridge, MA",124,1,,4.0,6/6/2017,"Pretty good service and environment here. Had to take out one star because I remember used to get 6 pcs of shrimps for my ""shrimps with angel hair"". I checked with the waiter, and at the beginning he said 6 pcs too, but he then went in to check with the chef and came back to tell me it's suppose to be only 5 shrimps instead of 6. I always count my shrimps when I order this dish, but not sure if this location only serve 5 pcs of shrimps for this dish...???"
Mary B.,"Tempe, AZ",25,3,,1.0,7/31/2017,"So I went to have dinner with my family at 5:34pm. They ask if we wanted to sit outside, we said, ""sure"" Little did I know they were going to seat us right where a family of flies were swarming. My daughter started to freak out and cry.  Finally after what felt like 10min of waiting, the waitress came around after another group of people sat next to us, took our drink order. Then she took the order of the other table at the same time.  Another 5 min past until she came back with our drinks, and took our food order, but I wasn't able to speak because my daughter kept having meltdowns due the flies, so my husband gave her the order.  As we waited, with only our drink to quench our thirst, she the waitress (Ashely) finally came out with some bread. Yay!!! At least my kids can eat something, while waiting for the food. During the time of waiting for the food, my poor daughter continued to have meltdowns, by ever passing of a fly, yet we were still not offered a different area to sit. Finally, after 30 min passed, our food came and I was tired of hearing my daughter cry while others were trying to eat, I told the waitress we will be leaving.  I waited another 5 min for to go bags. While we were waiting, I told my hubby to take the kids and I will wait.  Ashely the waitress, finally gave me the check, after waiting again for 5 min, where I almost wanted to walk out."
Katrina S.,"Covina, CA",83,43,30,5.0,7/28/2016,"In all my years and many visits to the Cheesecake Factory, never have I ever had a better experience than today. Bryan Ramirez has to be the FASTEST busser I've ever seen. We came in with a dirty table and once Bryan was called, it was cleaned in SECONDS. His work was so impeccable that not even a crumb was left. Bryan continued cleaning all the other tables around us and we were just so fascinated with how he wouldn't even break a sweat. Talent is what he is and he definitely deserves a raise!!!  Ps. If you want a clean table, make sure to request Bryan"
Jessica G.,"Glendora, CA",406,52,62,3.0,3/17/2017,"Slow service at lunchtime. I was disappointed because they drenched my tacos in too much sauce I could barely eat them. My waitress was sweet, but was disappointed in the overall service."
Sylvie W.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",48,39,2,1.0,9/13/2016,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, First of all let me just say I am a big fan of you! I think your food and service are awesome and consider every single visit to your restaurant a privilege. My last visit, however, was not my typical positive experience with your restaurant.  We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I asked for no peanuts. There was no follow up question from my server. When we were eating I noticed that the salad had almonds in it, I assumed that if I say no peanuts it's probably safe to not put any kinds of nuts. Anyway I raised my concern and my server was apologetic. She offered me a new salad but we were almost full by that time. The manager then came by and said ""there's no peanuts you're good to go,"" Then I responded it has these nuts, he said they're not nuts they're almonds so you're fine. I said no thanks and he took the food away. Common restaurant courtesy, if you're going to take someone's food away you should not charge them! Needless to say we were charged for the stupid salad. I am not complaining over the $15 salad, it is more the courtesy. I am disappointed."
Anne B.,"West Covina, CA",1,9,19,5.0,11/16/2016,Overall excellent first experience dining at The Cheesecake Factory tonight. Dim lighting and high ceilings was lovely. Loved the cheesecake with ice cream a la mode and enjoyed ordering off the skinnylicious menu and I ordered chicken tacos with veggies on the side and strawberry lemonade found it a bit too sweet added some of my water and was alright and still was fun to try some of my sister's chicken Fettuccine (; I hope to come back soon (-:
Durga K.,"Pasadena, CA",2,3,2,4.0,11/15/2016,"I fell in love with cheese cake  I love going to dis restaurant  Neat & clean Satisfied with food, service.  Loved it."
Martinez M.,"West Covina, CA",0,7,,3.0,6/15/2017,"I recently celebrated my anniversary the service started fine with no problem but after our was taken it took an hour and half, if not longer, before we got our other. The manager came over to apologize ans gave us free cheese cake. When it came to pay the bill I handed the server two gift cards and my atm but instead of letting us know that one card didn't go through she took the liberty to run the remaing balance. The gift card still had a balance and the manager corrected the issue. The manager was  very polite and apologetic and if it wasn't for that i would of given less stars."
Penny R.,"Whittier, CA",346,4,2,5.0,6/14/2017,"Came here with a big party for a 21st birthday and had an awesome experience! Lou was such a sweetheart and made our dinner fantastic! Everyone ate every bite of the food or took theirs home, hats off to the chefs on duty. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
Phung D.,"San Leandro, CA",144,508,1088,5.0,5/8/2015,"The first time I had cheesecake factory was 10 years ago and I did not like it. It's because I didn't order the right thing. But ever since I had their pasta & calamari? It has been my favorite ever since!  This is the closest location in my area and it never disappoint each time I come. Their service is always great so I never had a bad day with them. They always start you off with bread (after your order that is! My friend joked people might take off after eating their bread only). That's because they have the BEST wheat bread ever. It's so soft and sweeet! Heck, just take me there and give me bread and I'll be happy! But on a side note, they do have few dishes there that I absolutely love!  |Four Cheese Pasta| I've tried several pasta from them but this has been my staple for a very long time. Penne style is my favorite so this dish is it! It's very creamy and cheesy. This dish doesn't come with meat so it's additional $3 if you order with chicken. But I preferred less meat so I never order it with chicken.  |Calamari| This has to be my favorite appetizer from them. Nothing else. And yes, I did try several before. They use the right mount of batter that makes it perfectly crispy in my opinion. The texture is fresh and not too rubbery. The dipping sauce they serve with it go well with the calamari or just how I like it at least. Cocktail & garlic."
Brandi L.,"Alhambra, CA",21,14,17,5.0,5/11/2017,"This is probably a biased opinion since I just love this restaurant. However while visiting here this afternoon, we had the pleasure of having Steven Moreno. Serve us. What a delightful human to encounter. Super helpful, super patient, and very efficient! Thank you!"
Ashley J.,"San Gabriel, CA",159,9,6,3.0,1/14/2016,"As we walk in, boo and I could tell that it was a busy night so when we gave the hostess our party number and name she said it would take about half an hour just to be seated.  We were really hungry and were not willing to wait even longer to eat so we decided to sit at the self-seat high tables by the bar (NO WAIT!!). At first, it took a while for any server to notice us. When a young lady finally did, we were given menus and complimentary bread that Cheesecake always provides. First thing I noticed when we were given the bread was that we were given some short (only 2 loaves in the tray)... and it was absolutely cold. I had wondered if the waitress brought us bread from a different party who did not finish theirs? (Kind of upsetting if that actually happened). Boo had to ask for fresh bread from a male server. When the bread came, it was fresh out of the oven and hot! with 3 loaves... Hmm.. We ordered the Cajun Jimbalya and the Chicken Biscuit. Cajun Jimbalya is usually very flavorful and spicy, but this time did not seem to fit all those categories. There were too much noodles and not enough flavor; bland. Had to ask the waitress for more spice and seasoning, but she brings out some sort of ""cajun"" soup that tasted awfully like tomato soup. So I had to ask another waitress that knew exactly what I meant and brought my dish back to the kitchen to be retossed in the Cajun butter. For dessert, boo ordered the Oreo cheesecake that was too sweet for me but he seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, the service was minimal (not sure if it had anything to do with being seated at self-seating tables) and the food was just OK. I would probably only come back for their complimentary honey wheat bread  and possibly an original cheesecake."
Nancy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,117,92,5.0,11/11/2015,"We came here right when they opened at 11:00am.  Great service,  relaxed atmosphere,  clean restrooms, generous portions of well-cooked casual American food.   Comparing this place to BJ's Brewery, Cheesecake Factory beats BJ's by a long shot.  Take the avocado rolls, as a comparison.  The rolls at CKF are crispy, fresh out of the fryer, and the sauce is sweety, tangy, and served generously.   BJ's (esp the one in Puente Hills) ... soggy, lukewarm, and the dipping sauce served was insufficiently portioned. Tip:  long lines if you arrive after 12pm.  Get here early for the best and most prompt service.  Recommended."
Linda S.,"Glendale, CA",45,21,,2.0,4/9/2017,"We went there for the first time after taking the kids to the Jumpin place next door. Our meal was good, but the service at the time was extremely slow. We had to ask random people for help, and instead of helping us, they would find our waiter. Don't get me wrong... I get it, we're not your table. I ordered a meal to go and we paid our bill and waited at the table. That's when we saw it! A WORM/CATERPILLAR thing climbing out of the broccoli stem. My son hates cooked vegetables so we ordered his broccoli raw. His food even came out last because the said they had to cut his fresh. The manager was super nice about it and comped our meal. He asked that we give them a second chance and return and a few weeks later we did. He assured me that he had sent the incident to corporate but that the isolated worm incident was a risk with any raw vegetables... except for salad which was triple washed. Personally, I think they should have the same washing standards all around, but that's just me. He said to ask for him, and I did. He said he would come check in us and make sure the experience was better, but I never saw him again after being seated. The food was the average Cheesecake standard, nothing super special and the waiter was much more attentive this time. I give them 2 stars for the food and the improved staff the second time around, but when a manager invites you back and promises to make sure you had a good experience, but never returns... well that just solidified our not returning to this location. I think we prefer the Americana or the Spectrum locations... even Canoga Park was better than what we've experienced here."
Justin L.,"Arcadia, CA",252,17,,2.0,4/21/2017,"Placed an order for curbside pick up, expecting an quick quality meal to go. WRONG. I made the poor assumption that my order would be correct, I guess lesson learned. Ordered a side of fries along with my burger, which I was charged for but did not receive, I asked for my salmon to come with the lemon sauce on the side, was not done, very specifically asked for ranch on the side, was also not included. Salmon was cold, I guess it was sitting out for the extra 20 minutes I was sitting outside. I called and spoke to Kenneth the manager on duty, but got no empathy and a partial refund. I usually have decent experiences with this Cheesecake Factory, not sure why today was different."
Glissy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,52,,3.0,2/6/2017,Let me say service was quick and fast! Considering it was Sunday (super bowl). We were able to get a table less then 5 mins. We got our food pretty fast. And it was ok. However the waitress was very inattentive. She kept passing by more to look if we were done to clear the table. I felt like they were trying to rush us out. She wasn't very friendly and wouldn't come around much to ask if we needed anything or if we wanted more water or drinks. I've gone to other smaller chain restaurants and was catered to more then here. I don't know if it's all waitresses who are like this or just this particular girl. I left a tip regardless but I wish they would train all waitresses to attend their tables more. I'll be back because I did enjoy the environment.
Sara C.,"Rialto, CA",0,7,2,5.0,9/7/2017,This location is super clean and food is amazing ! Denzil was our waiter and let me tell you he was amazing !!! It's been a while since I've experienced service like that !
Cheryl V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,3.0,10/16/2016,"My steak was Great. Our Server in the bar was also very good. The Hostess was another story. There was no pager. She only called out names and we couldn't hear over the noise. Then her attitude went stank,when we told her ""we can't hear when you call our name. ""These are modern times. No pagers ? Beyond that, the Food was Great,"
Jaime F.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Bad service, manager just ignored customer complaint. Need a manager that take care of issues. No a manager that comes to collect his pay check. Food no so great, used to to be great food."
Liz S.,"Montebello, CA",1,24,,1.0,4/12/2017,"So this past Sunday we decided  to go to the Cheesecake factory, my son was turning 15 and it was his first time and my 2 nd time and let me tell you it will be my last . The food is delicious but the service is horrible. It was a table for 6 and we were sat outside and at the same time there was a party going . I think out waiter was too busy attending everyone else but us. We had kids in our party. He took forever to come and take our drink order and my kids were thirsty and once our food came out he hardly checked up on us. He didn't even give us a chance to tell him we were celebrating that towards the end I just wanted to get the check and leave .  Not sure if it was he waiters fault for a horrible experience of the restaurants fault for giving him too many tables . Either way not recommending this place and not returning. It was the worst 180$ Ive spend ."
