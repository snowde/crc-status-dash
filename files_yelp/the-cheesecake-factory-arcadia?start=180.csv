Annmia S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,35,13,5.0,9/12/2017,"The service is quite good. We ate bread, 4 dishes of pasta, and spring rolls which are my favorite and the kids love too. Cheesecake is delicious, of course."
Mario O.,"Pico Rivera, CA",33,66,156,5.0,12/12/2015,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory?!  I try not to write reviews for chains, but when you are lucky enough to have an excellent meal...you have to write about it! Lunch menu is perfect! Not too heavy and the price is right. Food is excellent in taste, quality, and quantity. Service was great when I went. Hint hint: 3:30 is the perfect time. Right after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush. Always clean, and excellent service. It's really nice that it's located right on the plaza. Now I can shop and enjoy a nice meal that's not in the food court (nothing against the food court though)."
Jerry Y.,"Arcadia, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/11/2017,"Good steak. I always order the rib eye. It is cooked in its own juices and is very flavorful. I eat the same thing almost every other week. Not too much fat which is probably why I can enjoy it so often. When I am not so ambitious, I will go for their hamburgers. Nice tasting hamburger, not like those that is soaking in butter. I have tried steak at other places in the Mall including California Pizza Kitchen. They do have a great steak but they cannot maintain a constant level of quality. Maybe a little on the fatty size."
Melissa L.,"Portland, OR",1459,1043,788,4.0,10/8/2015,"I generally avoid Cheesecake Factory.  I find the food overpriced and laden with calories & sodium.  Plus, anytime a restaurant has a menu that big with that many pages, I'm naturally nervous about freshness. So imagine my surprise of the very pleasant experience I had on a Wednesday night for dinner with my teen daughter (yes, she asked to eat here.)   This was my first time at this location (The view of the Redondo Beach location is great; however, the Old Town Pasadena location is too crowded). Daughter and I walked in and we were seated immediately at a small quiet booth.  Okay, I was liking my seat...then we were handed the giant book of a menu and a small 2 pager menu.  The 2 pager menu was the ""skinnylicious"" menu of entrees under 590 calories.  FINALLY.  After consistently having entrees ranked the worst in the country for calories & sodium, you have listened and created healthier options.   Further, I was able to get a glass of a good Russian River Chardonnay. My entree? Seared Tuna Tataki Salad-The Ahi tasted fresh and was prepared correctly.  Plus, I enjoyed the Wasabi vinaigrette and appreciated that they put it on the side so that you can decide how much you want to add to the mixed greens. Finally, our server, Cody L was fantastic.  He was attentive and friendly.  Further, he offered to give my daughter a soda in a to go cup.  KUDOS; my daughter loved this. I have heard from a good source, that Cheesecake doesn't use Yelp.  So how do they get feedback?  They expect people to contact their corporate office.  NAH, I'm not writing comments to more than one place.  Sorry Cody L, don't think management will see this."
C N.,"Azusa, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/24/2017,Another recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  The pasta was a disappointment.  Have had pasta dish at CF before (Dine in and To go). This time is substandard cooking and the pasta was totally UNDERCOOKED.
Michelle H.,"Alhambra, CA",1,27,23,5.0,4/3/2016,Sitting here right now with lots of yummy food... Great people and Great Menu!! Gotta try the sweet potato fries with all the delish sauces... Garlic Aioli.. Chipotle Mayo.. Savory Ranch.. and gotta have the Classic Ketchup...
Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4320,743,1968,3.0,10/10/2014,"As yelp approaches it's 500th review of this particular cheesecake factory, there's probably not a great deal more to be said regarding this establishment. Because it is attached to the Arcadia Westfield mall, you are more likely to run into jerks like me that bring their kids out to a restaurant on a Friday night.  Crowds tonight or considerable, and the supposed 15 minute wait time came and went like the minuscule bread plate put on our table with three ravenous children at the ready to devour.   We saw one very young couple - maybe 16 or 17 years old - that appeared to be here on the first date.  The extended wait time in the lobby resulted in the casualty of an apparent wall in conversation. I knew he was in trouble when she took out her phone made a call, and started talking as if he wasn't there. Epic fail. As previously stated, the menu has been discussed ad nauseum on other reviews.  Interestingly, this particular cheesecake factory has the added bonus of good people watching, considering that it is so close to Arcadia, the freeway, and to repeat-- it's attached to a mall. Did I mention the kids? The restaurant is two doors down from Jumpin' & Jammin', where kids have fun climbing around on giant hamster happy trails, and no single father is safe from the onslaught of... Attention. Anyway, pasta... Steak... Grilled chicken things... You know the drill here.  Maybe it's a good idea to arrive early, like say, 430 in the afternoon. You'll probably get better service, and you won't have to stand in the lobby with 160 of your closest stranger soon to be friends."
Antonio R.,"Glendale, CA",1,14,39,5.0,4/16/2017,Service Is Always Outstanding. Sergio Was out Waiter & He's Very Attentive & Made Sure We Were Taken Cared Of When He Took His Break. Valerie Filled In & Did A Great Job. Food Is So Tasteful & Overall A Must To Eat At When Visiting The Area. Been Going Here For Over 10+ Years & Will Continue To.
Stephanie W.,"Temple City, CA",14,7,8,3.0,3/6/2017,"I have always loved eating here until recently. We were a party of 7 & waited a good 50+ minutes when we were told that it was a 45min wait from the time we arrived at 5:45pm on a Sunday night. Not sure why but they were super packed that night. Once we sat down, it took another 5-10min for service. We decided to put in the kids orders first since they were already a bit antsy from the long wait and waited on our orders...boy, that was a big mistake...our waiter was all over the place that night and didn't come back to take our orders until 20-25min later n by that time, our kids have already gotten their food and finished it before our orders were even taken. So then, another 30min wait after our orders were taken and put through to the kitchen. By then, it was already 7:45pm and our food was finally brought to us but not hot anymore. I ordered the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and mash potatoes...to my surprise my fish was only slightly warm and had so much bones in it..it was hard to eat without having to stop to spit out the bones that were still left in the filet after ever bite. Mind you, the restaurant had dim lighting so I can barely see what I was eating. So, I ended up with leftovers for today and to my surprise...more bones...l pulled out 5bones and then decided I had enough.,I'm sure there were more bones in the salmon cuz I still had a quarter piece left...I'm thinking I'll avoid ordering fish here from now on...this was not the first time that I found multiple bones in my salmon. Yeah, what a huge disappointment! We came here to celebrate my son's birthday and did not have such a great experience...long wait for everything from getting the table, to getting service from the waiters to getting our food...I felt like I was at an amusement park where the wait was kind of expected but yeah....not happy.."
Vincent P.,"Alhambra, CA",279,299,602,4.0,12/16/2015,"Came here with my co-workers for dinner and it was pretty good! We were seated quickly and our server was very attentive. The restaurant is within the Santa Anita Mall so the parking lot can be packed on a busy night, but you should be able to find parking, although it might be a longer walk to the restaurant.  Hilariously, half of our group ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($16.95), including me! This bow tie pasta dish is served with crispy chicken, mushrooms, peppers, and onions flavored with their Spicy New Orleans sauce.  Don't fret, it's just a hint of spicy, nothing too crazy. I really enjoyed this dish, it was flavorful and tasted great.The portions were also plentiful, most of us had leftovers for to-go.  For dessert, we ordered three cheesecakes: the Original, Fresh Strawberry, and Red Velvet. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was gigantic! I recommend sharing it, I cant imagine how anyone could finish one by themselves! The other two were nicely portioned. I try to avoid sweets nowadays, so a small slice of each was enough to satisfy me.  The Cheesecake Factory was an enjoyable dining experience, thumbs up for the good service and food!"
Maria K.,"Pasadena, CA",16,2,3,4.0,10/28/2016,"This is one of the best places Ive ever been. Good atmosphere, nice staff and most importantly perfectly tasting food of high quality!"
Alan N.,"Alhambra, CA",98,106,271,5.0,12/10/2014,One of the most cheapest romantic setting restaurant that you can find. I forgot what I ordered but it should be the very first item in the specialities section in the menu. Chicken something and I have to admit... It was amazing! Crispy chicken on top of pasta. The red velvet cheesecake tasted so sweet and good also! The waitress that I had was so nice and definitely someone that's l fun to talk to. It's like the best service I've ever experienced in for so long.  I would definitely come back.
Elizabeth A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/27/2017,My boyfriend and I go really often. I like the food and service. The only bad thing is the wait time
Kimberly G.,"Alhambra, CA",336,141,876,4.0,10/13/2015,"The bf and I decided to come here for lunch since we saw that they had lunch specials until 5pm. We came here on Columbus Day so there were quite a bit of people here and at the mall. Since it is connected to the Santa Anita Mall, the parking lot was pretty busy so we had to circle around a few times until we found a parking spot.  We decided not to go with the lunch special and we went with their combination meals with Herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi for around $20. The dish came with mashed potatoes which were good, nothing special. The salmon was delicious! It was moist and flaky with lots of flavor. I was hesitant to get this because I hate when salmon is over cooked, but not here! It was cooked perfect! Their shrimp scampi was also DELICIOUS with lots of garlic and butter burnt onto the shrimp giving it lots of flavor! There were 3 shrimps so the bf and I split 1 1/5 shrimps for each person. :)  The dish also came with three asparagus as well for veggies.  Overall this is a great choice if you like salmon and shrimp! They're a must try! I wished the dish came with more veggies rather than only three thin asparagus. Service was great! Our waiter was attentive even though he had lots of tables to wait on. He was also able to pronounce the bf's Thai name which is super long! :)"
Justine S.,"La Puente, CA",0,4,2,3.0,4/6/2017,"We went to dinner with 14 people since it was my sister's birthday. Our server was very slow & I had to ask her for a straw 4 times before I actually got one, since water doesn't come with a straw. I ordered Crispy Fried Cheese as an appetizer, and they were pretty good. For dinner I ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, the chicken was over cooked & rubbery. It seemed boiled. They made my dads beef dip wrong & didnt bring the condiments we asked for when we ordered. Over all, the food is very mediocre. Nothing to brag about, which is unfortunate since we've been wanting to go there. I also think it's WAY too dark in there during dinner time."
Dezzi Y.,"San Diego, CA",18,44,19,5.0,12/18/2016,"My rating isn't necessarily for the restaurant but for a couple of servers I had there. I go here on occasion the food is consistent with all other Cheesecake Factory's. The service I got from two particular servers was outstanding. Cindy and Antonio aka Antwon. The service was a few weeks apart but both exceeded my expectations. (I'm pretty hard to impress) They simple did their jobs with flare, kindness and joy. I have gone back and sat with other but the service fell short. If I could only dine with them I would. The cutest is, they happy to be a couple. It only figures they both would be awesome sauce."
Janise Q.,"Arcadia, CA",320,37,33,4.0,8/21/2016,"I've been coming here since they opened at the Santa Anita Mall and let me just say, they never seem to disappoint. Maybe it's because I have awesome servers who make the experience great or maybe it's the large portions of food every time I'm here! My mom and I don't usually go out to eat together a lot but when we do, we somehow always end up at cheesecake factory!  We went on a Saturday Night around 8:45PM thinking there's not going to be a lot of people since it was late but were we wrong! We waited about 20 minutes for our table because it was so packed! When we got seated, my favorite part comes out. THE BREAD. so good & for some reason my mom thinks they give the best butter in the world. I don't know, that's her opinion. All Butter tastes the same to me.  We ordered off the Skinnylicious menu. My mom got the lemon-garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta which in my opinion looked amazing but for the price is was at, I think the portions were on the smaller side. I guess it makes sense though since every entree on the Skinnylicious menu is supposed to be under 590 calories. I got the chicken pasta from the same menu and mine I think was more worth it. Yes, 590 calories worth of delicious tomato sauce & a little pesto rigatoni with chicken bits. I could only eat half before I got way too full.  Nice compliment to my meal though is their strawberry lemonade. YUM!  Too bad we were too full to get cheesecake afterwards though ): definitely getting it next time though!"
Aura M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1023,321,2120,3.0,12/8/2015,Yea it's not a bad restaurant at all but I still think is not the best in the area. Some dishes ara more flavorful than others and at the end of the day is about choices and preferences. If you go at night the customer service is the worst or maybe they didn't have enough staff working that night but I literally stood up and went to look for my waitress....but I might go back for the convenience after doing some shopping at the mall.
Steve S.,"Orange County, CA",1953,1200,7574,4.0,8/5/2014,"Old Reliable is the best way I can describe The Cheesecake Factory for me.  I know I'll have a good meal. They have one of my favorite dish I've had a restaurant. It's Miso Salmon. It's miso marinated salmon served on a bed of rice w/ snow peas and miso sauce. Just delicious!! I've had this dish at 4 or 5 other Cheesecake Factory and they've perfected it. It's the same in each location. I'm sure they have other dishes but I just love this dish.  My wife got the Renee's Special. One-Half of a Fresh Turkey or Chicken Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Our Soup and a Small Green Salad. She got the turkey salad sandwich, baked potato soup and for an extra buck, she got the Caesar salad instead of the green salad. Her verdict, yum, yum & yum!!  In her words the best turkey salad sandwich she's ever had. And she's a turkey sandwich aficionado.  Well, a visit here is not complete without indulging in a cheesecake or two.  We got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  Cheesecake, another one I always get (red velvet is the other). It's still as good as I remember it yum!! We got a Kahlua Cheesecake to go (wifey request). What's not to like? Kahlua in cheesecake, super delicious. I might have to add a third wheel to the cheesecake list. Lol.  Service was okay. Our waitress seemed eager to kick us out. She kept asking if she could wrap our food. If you asked 5 times, that's too much. My wife was feeding my boy so she hardly touched her food and the waitress was oblivious to that fact. Not cool.  The place is beautiful decorated. I love the Murano glass style lighting they had.  The tables are pretty spaced close together. So close, conversations aren't private. Lol.  They have a small dessert counter at the entrance if you're interested in a to go cheesecake.  I can always count on a good meal here and oh, the cheesecake are awesome as well. lol."
gabriel m.,"San Gabriel, CA",25,20,6,3.0,10/18/2015,"This place is located in a nice area, but the people that work here are bipolar!!! Our waitress at first seemed to be putting on a fake smile and cheerful attitude, being very condescending. Mid way through our dinner after several please and thank you from us it was as if she was a whole new person. She seemed honest and sincere in being glad to work there. At the end she made up for her poor attitude.  The food was okay the charts good. We had the habachi steak which I totally enjoyed. My girlfriend had the chicken with biscuits that lacked in seasoning and taste. My son took one bit of mini corn dog and was done. Something about the hot dog that they use, seemed to be a little tart."
