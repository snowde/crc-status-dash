Hala Hana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,131,720,4.0,8/25/2014,Always a great choice! Always good food! Great portions! Love their cheesecake!!    Top 10 fave restaurants!!
Julia C.,"Alhambra, CA",0,11,58,5.0,7/19/2016,"Love to come with my mom because she likes, actually we like the clam chowder soup, the house salad and miso salmon, oh and the wheat bread. But i love to come with my boyfriend too and have a pineapples mojito, love it."
Irene A.,"La Verne, CA",27,123,57,5.0,5/15/2016,"We always come here for lunch or dinner, but this time we came for Sunday Brunch.  I insisted on coming here instead of IHOP.  I'm so glad I did. We were seated right away at 10 am.  I had the Fried Chicken and Waffle Benedict.  It was delicious!  I had to share the other half with my husband or I would have been stuffed.  The dish came with yummy fried potatoes.  Everyone was eating them off my plate.  The kids had their pancakes, which they enjoyed.  My husband had the brunch combo.  He said ""it was better then average.""  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  We enjoyed our Sunday brunch here and will definitely come back for brunch again soon."
Mimi M.,"Northridge, CA",5,101,15,1.0,9/25/2016,"Worst experience ever.  To the point where I don't think I'll go to another cheesecake factory anywhere.  We walk in, I smile and greet the young hostess girls with a warm and cheery, 'hello.'  As that is my normal disposition.  These two grungy looking kids literally just stare at me like I'm a damn alien.  Then when they go to seat my friend and I, still without any acknowledgement whatsoever, they put is right next to, two of the server stations where they type in their tickets and directly in line with the kitchen, where there is high traffic.  Needless to say, I didn't come out to eat, to stare at people's behinds and watch food come in and out.  I kindly ask the very portly girl, 'do you have any other seating not by the kitchen.'  She looks at me like I requested a fucking private jet...and then proceeds, loudly, to gesture wildly, asking 'well where would you like to sit?'  I respond, 'how about anywhere not near asses, the kitchen, or the restroom?'  My God.  smh.  And the place was empty!  She then takes us to a table and loudly/rudely asks, 'is THIS going to be OK for you?'   The young brown skinned kid who was our initial waiter, seemed completely slow...all of the young kids working there look dirty, unkempt and quite honestly disgusting.  They're either grossly overweight, disheveled, dirty nails, and generally people I would not want near my food, let alone carrying it.    The young white kid who ended up being our server, who looks like the father from American Pie, ended up being 'ok.'  Nice enough kid.  Until, he referred to my friend and I (who are both brown skinned) as COLORED.  WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK.  I felt like we had fallen into a damn time warp and gone back to the 1950's.   Food was mediocre.  Service was appalling.  My friend who is in her mid 40's told me I should ask to speak to the manager, b/c everything was so terrible.  I didn't.  And still left a 20% tip!  smh.  In hindsight I should have asked for a manager and called out every single one of those snot nosed, dirty kids with the bad attitudes.   They really take the respectability of the restaurant to a McDonalds  level.  Cheesecake isn't 5 star by any means, and I don't even eat fast food, but patronizing this establishment made me feel like I would have ran the risk and eaten Taco Bell instead.   If any employees read this or management.  You guys are terrible.  And will probably not amount to much in life beyond 'hostess' or waiter (and not the good kind in the nice establishments) :/ why? B/c you lack focus, respect, cleanliness, and customer service orientation.  You also lack basic communication skills, service skills and have ZERO personalities.  You all have a hard reality set in front of you when you get from out of mom and dad's house and thrust into the real world."
M K K.,"Irvine, CA",10,53,291,3.0,9/28/2015,"I love cheese cake factory.  The food is better than average.  Customer service is normally awesome.  However,  today I must say would rate it 1/2 star.  It took 35 minutes for our waitress to introduce herself.  After an hour of being seated.... we finally was about to order. Thank goodness that our food came right away.  Our waitress,  Z was nice but never had time to check on us at all.  No refills No follow ups Nothing We had to Walk up to pay our bill.  Some service,  right?  1/2  = service  = food"
Joey N.,"Pasadena, CA",231,93,71,4.0,3/11/2016,"Cheesecake is usually good. Not always on point, but a classic spot that's been around for ages. I usually go for the meatloaf, pastas and definitely save room for the cheesecake!"
Albert L.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",1,1,,1.0,1/2/2017,"I'm currently feeding my 3 kids and wife inside the mall.   After signing my name there, we were told it was a 10 minute wait.   We asked for a booths, because we had small kids.  15 minutes later, they told me it was 5 more minutes.   After another 15, we were told we're next, as soon as the table was cleared.   Another 5, and still no table.   At this point. My kids are cranky, tired, and starving.   Thanks Cheesecake!  Totally Made our day."
Julie T.,"El Monte, CA",165,40,6,2.0,11/1/2016,"I decided to give Cheesecake Factory another try since my last review. Instead of ordering over the phone, I order to go in store. This time I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, since it was highly recommended for a pasta dish. Once again, disappointed. This time it's not about the service, it's about the food. The pasta, sauce, and everything in this dish was flavorless and extremely oily. The chicken was also extremely dry and also flavorless. This restaurant branch is honestly a hit or miss. Once in a while it'll be a hit and everything is perfect and other times; well... you get my drift. I don't think I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory anytime soon. 2 stars because decent service today, my order came out in a reasonable waiting time, and they even packed me some bread."
Amber R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,4,3,1.0,12/29/2016,I love there food but at this location never fails are food is always cold I come back hoping they would fix the problem.. even explaining to the waiter if he can make sure are food well come out hot are food still came out cold... so annoying and such an inconvenience
Troy G.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,16,3,2.0,6/16/2016,Just to let you know that they don't allow dogs on the patio unless they are certifed Service Dogs. I brought my certified Therapy Dog and was told they would make an exception this one time but that he was not allowed back. I ordered their $27.95 Ribeye steak and a plain hamburger patty for my dog. I was asked how I wanted both items cooked. I had requested that both cooked medium. The wait time was not bad. Once the brought my order I was suprised at the siza of the steak. It was small and thin. The hamburger patty was thicker than the steak. (See photo-steak on left of photo). I cut into the steak and it was cooked well done instead of medium.  The steak had no flavor and was dry.  Service was good and our waitress was great. She is the reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.  I got the bill and they charge $5.95 for a single hamburger patty. You are better off going next door to Wood Ranch Grill.
Cindy L.,"Fresno, CA",9,75,35,4.0,5/19/2017,Ordered lunch portion of the miso salmon perfectly done!! Kids had the bow tie alfredo pasta which was good enough for them. Great customer service from Jackie(hope I'm spelling her name right). Nice overall experience.
Yvette R.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,53,112,5.0,11/26/2016,"Brought my grandma here for her birthday and she loved it. Let me start with the restroom, it was really clean and fancy. Everyone was very polite and friendly. We came during lunch time so it was empty. The food was great, except the mushroom soup. I'm not a mushroom fan, so I did not eat mine. Our server was great. He convinced us on ordering dessert, and knew exactly how to describe/explain the questions we had regarding the food. Would I come here again, yes! I've been to other Cheese Cake Factory's and haven't had good service like I did here."
Justin H.,"Monterey Park, CA",181,263,62,3.0,4/4/2016,"For some inexplicable reason, Cheescake Factory has always done it right...I mean the interior is mismatched and randomly themed - there's an Egyptian pharaohs face sculptures and garden wallpaper for goodness' sake - it just doesn't make sense. Anyways, ordered onion strings, chicken fingers, cajun shrimp pasta, habachi steak, and meatloaf. Needless to say, portions were huge, and of course we were already half-full off of the addictive wheat bread they serve at the beginning so prepared to be full and have leftovers. Food was good, service was good, heck the water was good. I don't even know why I'm writing a review. I'm pretty sure anybody who uses Yelp has been to Cheescake Factory before. You already formed your opinions and you know it's good or at least not bad. Enjoy your birthday or whatever you're celebrating."
Bhushan J.,"Alhambra, CA",74,11,37,5.0,6/19/2016,Nice service (5/5) helpful staff/ Ambience (5/5)/ Food (4.5/5) best for cheesecake i am not sure about other menu...
Liz A.,"San Marino, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/4/2017,"HORRIBLE service on 4th of July!!! Not even busy here today and 40 minutes later, our bread has not even arrived!!! Our waiter came after 16 min after being seated to take our order! What kind of service is this??? And, no apologies!!! I had a glass of wine and you would have thought the manager would comp my drink for our wait and inconvenience ...but, nope!!!! We are next door at Woodranch now! No wait!!! The waiter and bread came IMMEDIATELY!!! And our meal in 5 minutes. Now this is what I call service. Thank you, WoodRanch!!!"
Greg N.,"Brea, CA",637,501,363,4.0,1/11/2015,"It might sound crazy what I'm about to say But some days we go the Cheesecake Factory's way And since last year, I haven't got full meals That's because of their afternoon deals At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you like their tamales of sweet sweet corn At Hour Happy:  Clap along for the chicken sliders with all the sides you can adorn At Hour Happy:  Clap along for big portions and the small $5 price At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you think this deal is very nice Some Yelpers scoff when others write 'bout chains Advancing corporates they say we must refrain But Cheesecake Factory has something going good I must extol their praises as best I could At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you like their fusion Tex-Mex egg rolls  At Hour Happy:  Clap along for chicken potstickers served in a humongous bowl At Hour Happy:  Clap along for big portions and the small $5 price At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you think this deal is very nice Bring me here when I'm feeling blue Bring me here to try something new Bring me here for a cheesecake slice Bring me here for plates that just entice Bring me here when I'm feeling great Bring me here my appetite will sate Bring me here with some Yelper friends  Bring me here again and again At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you like their cool buffalo blasts At Hour Happy:  Clap along for the duo of breads that I eat so very fast At Hour Happy:  Clap along for big portions and the small $5 price At Hour Happy:  Clap along if you think this deal is very nice"
Jay B.,"Los Angeles, CA",723,184,438,4.0,4/17/2015,"Came here on a Friday afternoon for their Happy Hour. (yes! They have a Happy Hour M-F at the bar)....was pleasantly surprised with the plethora of appetizer options all reasonably priced ( about 1/2 off for Avacado egg rolls! Yum!) but came away a bit dissappointed with lack of stiffness to the $5 margaritas....however, would definitely be back for maybe a beer and those lovely apps!!"
Michael V.,"Arcadia, CA",3,9,7,4.0,12/27/2016,Our daughter loves this place and we love it too.  The food is great and the portions are big. The service is exceptional.  The wait is long but well worth it.
Tong L.,"Pasadena, CA",1,5,11,4.0,12/11/2016,"So so crowded almost all the time! Food is amazing,, just that you have to wait at the restaurant."
Maria L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,10,1,5.0,12/9/2016,Always amazing service and amazing food. This will always be my go to spot when I'm feeling a little more on the splurging side
