Jade X.,"Temple City, CA",3,19,11,4.0,11/15/2016,"We came for a late Sunday lunch. Sergio was our server and he was very attentive and quick to bring what we asked for without forgetting anything. We weren't in a chatty mood so he just took our orders, brought our stuff, refilled drinks and checked up on us a few times. Food was on par for this type of place. I mean it was pretty good but it wasn't ""I need this in my life forever"". Don't think I'll make a special trip here if I don't need to shop at the mall, but will definitely be back when I shop. And it's always a better option than most of the food court."
Desiree B.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,1,5.0,6/17/2017,Good service! I did take out and was being extra af about the butter. lol The girl gave me more than what I asked and I was so happy.  The two girls in the take out section tonight. Cool af!
Azure S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,151,,2.0,11/27/2016,"It took a little while to be seated but I figured it was because there seemed to be an event going on nearby when I visited and many people came to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  The server I started with seemed pretty good, but she was switched out not long after I was seated and the guy who replaced her, while nice and all, was rarely there. In fact, there was hardly anyone to ask for service such as boxing up leftovers and getting the check.  The food took more than a half hour for to appear and tables that were seated later got their food sooner. But maybe the gumbo took a while to prepare?  The gumbo was good. I also had the dulce de leche cheesecake which unfortunately did not taste as good as it sounded.  The bathrooms were clean."
Paul A.,"Downey, CA",2,15,,5.0,9/5/2016,My sister and I took our mother here for her birthday  and it was great. The grilled  pork chops were fantastic. My muslim  friends don't know what their missing.
Russell M.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,82,51,4.0,6/26/2015,"Located at the Santa Anita/Westfield mall, parking can sometimes be a challenge especially during peak hours.  Was able to be seated within five minutes and had a pretty attentive waiter. Ordered Renee's Special (side garden salad, chicken salad sandwich and mushroom soup). As usual it was pretty delicious and had a good portion size.  Also took a chance and ordered the Firecracker Salmon. Unfortunately wasn't that impressive. It's salmon pieces wrapped in spinach and fried in a crispy wrapper with sweet and spicy chili sauce for around $12.  While the presentation looked nice, that was about it. There's only four pieces on the plate about the size of a roll of quarters, and the inside reminds me of how bags of chips now are: 70% air 30% food; not much there. There's also a large piece of cabbage to fill the plate if you like eating it.  Overall, the experience is good and food consistently good. Prices for some items  getting a bit too high: I.e. $3 for a soda, $15 for chicken Caesar, etc.  But for a beautiful interior ambience, great service, your complimentary bread and good portion sizes, enjoy. I'll still be visiting."
Michelle W.,"Alhambra, CA",277,114,426,2.0,12/11/2015,"Alright so, for some reason, I keep having a really hard time with this place... Around October, on my friend's birthday, we decided to get food here. The experience was the same, very good! Before we ordered, we mentioned it was our friend's birthday so he would get a song and some special little dessert! The food portion seemed smaller than usually but I could manage! Everything was fine until I found a pea in my meatballs and 'penne' (I switched it from spaghetti to penne cause you can do that!). I brought it up with my friends and then we laughed about it since it was just a small out of nowhere experience. And besides, I like peas in the first place! But what happened next was pretty terrible. I bit into a piece of sharp, flat, charred piece of metal. It cut the gums behind my teeth...  I started bleeding slightly, it wasn't that deep of a cut, but I was panicky. If I had swallowed that, there would have been consequences. We told our waitress about it, and she looked at the food. Afterwards she had to get the manager and he apologized for it and took the food away. He said he wouldn't charge me either, but I still was really hungry. I only got to eat one meatball and some pasta! Afterwards, I think the girl made a mistake on the check because she 'paid' for my bad meal? Like she gave us an extra 18 dollars? We asked but she seemed like she was confused and in a hurry.  My friend never got his birthday song, and I was still pretty hungry. I visited again after a couple of weeks, and was randomly chosen to do a survey on my receipt. I told them about my experience, and they gave me a $10 card, but I guess because it wasn't a good experience, they apologized and offered me a $50 gift card! I like the gestures but I would really appreciate it if they actually talk to their team about this. So on the 10th of December, I ordered a lousiana chicken pasta and a shephard's pie, both lunch size. They told me it would take 15 to 20 minutes, which I gave them before I walked there since I work at the same mall. They made me wait 10+ extra minutes even though my order was right on the side, and I ended up using most of my break time. Plus the walk to and back are around 5 to 8 minutes long each. (I work at the opposite side of the mall and I have short legs since I'm 5'1.). The food by then was damp, clammy, and dripping wet. The man who helped me however, was very nice about it and made the experience a bit better.  Other than that, I feel this place is losing its touch."
Rachel C.,"El Monte, CA",2,19,3,4.0,8/28/2016,"Food was great. Nice atmosphere and mostly friendly servers. Great place for a slightly formal date night or family night. The lady who brought the food was nice and friendly, however our server was not. He was unhappy and rude to us. Never once came to check up on us. When we were done with our main dishes, I asked him for a box and the cheesecake and he didn't even respond to that. He just collected our plates silently and had a disgruntled face. How rude is that? I know dealing with some customers sucks but come on, this guy wasn't even polite at all. I wish we didn't even leave a tip for this guy, but my moms kind heart was the only reason this guy got a 10% tip instead of nothing. Would come back here if that server wasn't there."
Karineh G.,"Pasadena, CA",11,14,9,1.0,11/21/2016,"My husband wanted pumpkin cheesecake, and since it's the season for it, and we bought a slice to take home. I took one bite and could tell immediately that they had given us a less fresh, really old-tasting cheesecake slice. Very very disappointed and grossed out ."
Lidia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,12,4.0,5/23/2016,"It is one of my favorite places to eat at! From lunch to dinner. Flying gorilla is delicious, artichoke dip, fried macaroni, flat breads, pastas, brunch is all good thus far!!! And the cheesecake, well, I love cheesecake and it is very good here!!!"
Abigail C.,"Temple City, CA",213,24,4,1.0,7/18/2016,"Ordered the crab cake. I'm never coming back again. I came here on a Sunday with my sisters trying to enjoy our weekend together as we are usually busy with our individual lives. I ordered the crab cake and there were barely any crabs on my plate. My plate consisted of: greasy, overly-salted, BURNED potatoes; two eggs; a sauce that didn't have much role in the meal other than coloring my food; and very few pieces of crab meats here and there. I didn't expect to get a full crab leg or anything close to it, but the amount of crab meat I got was just ridiculous. Overall, I was just stuffing down the burned potatoes the whole time. ($13.9x not including tax and tips for burned potatoes? No thanks)  Now for the service... First of all, one of our orders never came, but that wasn't a big deal as I understand that waiters have a lot on their plates and can forget some things here and there. However, the service my waiter provided was just unbelievable. Okay now, one of my sisters arrived late and when she got here, the waiter LITERALLY gave gave her an eye-roll!!! Yes, she may be panting a little due to the fact that she was trying to hurry up as she was late, but an eye-roll? Really??? Now, this is not all. Later on, we had to consistently ask some other waiters for water or extra orders as our waiter was no where in sight. Guess what? The waiter we asked told us that he is not our waiter and ask us to wait for our waiter to come. He did not inform our waiter that we were looking for her and  our waiter did not come until the very end, when we were all done with our food. The Cheesecake Factory- that the the first time I've paid you a visit and that would be my last."
Omar D.,"El Monte, CA",62,74,248,1.0,12/28/2015,"Writing a bad review to get the attention. To all managers, you have an ongoing problem that you have never addressed properly.    Your paging system doesn't work inside the mall, and you all know this. So why don't you label the pagers to state that it doesn't work in the mall. That's it, it's that easy. We went in yesterday evening and was given a 50 to 65 minute wait. We're at the mall, why wouldn't we take a little walk. Came back early only to be told, we paged you already. Sorry the pagers don't work in the mall, that would have been nice to know before we left the restaurant. If course another 15 minutes and we were seated. Besides getting water spilt on my son, the rest was average."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,3.0,11/20/2014,"Restaurant chains don't normally appeal to me, but Cheesecake Factory is a guilty pleasure. The food isn't the best, but the quality and taste is consistent, my expectations are always met, and the menu has a variety of safe choices. This particular location has been around since the mall remodeled and added the current food court area (10 years now?). During high school, Cheesecake Factory was the fancy schmancy ""it"" place you'd go to for special occasions, so I've been here more times than I can care to remember. Now, it's a place to go to when no one can decide what to eat. Bar seating and high-top tables are first come, first serve. I don't think I've ever waited for a table at this location, just because I usually come on weekdays (if you're a local, you know to stay away from this hell hole of a mall on weekends). There's also patio seating, which is nice, but there's not much of a view to look at. The service has always been a hit or miss, averaging 3-star quality. For food, I usually stick with a pasta: either Pasta Da Vinci or Tomato Basil. If I'm not in the mood for carbs, I'll get a chicken or fish dish. I'd recommend Crispy Chicken Costoletta or Miso Salmon. Portions are always double what you're actually able to eat, so it's nice to pack up the leftovers for lunch or dinner for the next day. Whatever you end up choosing, I'm sure it will taste fine. Dessert options are endless as well, but I find myself gravitating towards the Original Cheesecake with Strawberries more often than not. Parking can be a hassle, just because it's mall parking, but there are lots everywhere and the mall isn't that big to navigate through. There is valet directly in front but I've never used it, as well as curb-side parking for take-out pick-ups."
Deanna T.,"Orange County, CA",12,105,577,5.0,12/26/2014,"It's weird, but The Cheesecake Factory would never be my go-to restaurant. However, if my friends choose to have a meal here, I'll happily oblige. The few times I've dined at this location have been fantastic. The service has been wonderful and the food have been well-prepared.  Skinnylicious Grilled Steak Medallions - Angus beef over a bed of mashed potatoes and surrounded by asparagus, Shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, in a Madeira wine sauce and sprinkled with crushed croutons. Absolutely delectable. I would definitely order this again.  Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken - Thick pasta with chicken strips drenched in a Parmesan cheese sauce. Heavy stuff, so it's good to share, unless you can finish the entire plate yourself. Factory Combination: Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi - Angus beef coated in a black peppercorn, mushroom, and wine sauce along side 3 large shrimps sauteed with cloves of garlic, tomato, and basil atop some angel hair pasta and separated with a generous portion of mashed potatoes. Gotta love this land and sea pairing. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake - Cheesecake swirled with blueberries and topped with a layer of white chocolate mousse and shavings. The crust had hints of cinnamon. I don't like cream cheese, but this was quite heavenly. The blueberry added that tartness, white chocolate provided the smoothness and cream cheese was pure richness. Factory Peach Bellini - Champagne, peaches, and peach liqueur. It's like a peach slush. I like their complimentary little bread basket. I especially love the squaw bread! This brown bread has a nice crust, soft center, perfect amount of sweetness and topped with rolled oats. I usually like to ask for more, if I'm particular ravenous that day. Anyway, I'll have to give the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake a try the next holiday. Hopefully they bring it back next year!"
edward t.,"Glendale, CA",2,31,10,1.0,4/17/2017,"Shocked,  I have never experienced something like this before.  Today, Saturday April 8, at 2pm, we wanted to have lunch in one of our favorite restaurants, and that it cheesecake factory, we ordered, our lunch was awesome as usual BUT after we paid the check, we have realized that my Cousin's phone was missing. We looked everywhere and we were sure that we had it with us 'since we used the hotspot of the phone before lunch' but all of the sudden the phone is not there. We called the waitress, if by chance she picked it up by mistake while picking up the dishes, she said No, she haven't seen it, so we called the manager, she was very helpful, took out the seats and looked for it everywhere with us, but still no phone, I tried to call, but still no answer, no rings, nothing...  The manager told us that she can check the security camera to see what happened, at that moment the waitress who just left us decided to come back telling us that someone have found the phone in the restroom and gave it to the front desk, and she gave us the phone back asking us wether it belongs to us or not. Obviously it was our phone. The only problem is that My cousin haven't gone to the restroom at all or left our booth where we were sitting. The is no doubt in our minds that there was an attempt at theft and it goes without saying that were very shocked and disappointed. Update 04-12-2017 I have tried to contact them on there website as they requested on my yelp review, but they didn't reply back."
Cindy S.,"La Puente, CA",54,50,18,4.0,4/29/2017,Most of the time I come here it is busy. I really like there kale salad. Their cheesecakes are tasty but after eating I don't have room for dessert. You pay for what you get here. Prepare to wait though.
Ren M.,"Bakersfield, CA",18,94,31,2.0,9/10/2016,"Two only because our food took longer than usual to arrive.  When I say usual, usual is at the Glendale location.  On top of that, the bread that the waiter said he was going to get? Never came!!!!  But with the appetizer we ordered, it was enough, but I didn't like the fact that he did not follow through.  I don't think this location will be first on my list next time I'm at the mall and want a dine in.  There are a huge  selection of eateries nearby and this place will not be on my list next time.  I'll stick to the Glendale location if I want me some Cheesecake Factory because they never forget the breads."
Jeanette P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",41,30,108,3.0,9/19/2016,Food was good but service wasn't all that. Luckily gratuity is optional. Our server was polite and did the best he could with what was available for him
Soy Y.,"Arcadia, CA",263,304,183,4.0,11/22/2015,"Saturday night - we had a group of 15.  They do not take phone reservations. We planned to have dinner at 6:30 and we just wanted to have someone in our group to get there early and hope everyone else was on time at 6:30 so we could get seated in a timely manner, we were trying to watch a movie afterwards as well. There was a table of 17 after us so we didn't want to lose our table but we only had 5 out of the 15 in the restaurant at the time. The problem was the parking. There must have been some event but one car in our group had to leave to get gas because they had been idling too long in the parking lot to get a spot.  We urged the host that our group was just looking for parking and tried to get as many people in the door to secure our table.  I was one of the first to get there so I had some time t take in the large screens with their menu items cycling through them. I didn't see the photo but I heard my group talking about the chicken bellagio.  .... I wrote this review over a year ago. I can't remember what I wanted to say but the food was great and I've been wanting to go back ever since."
Edward N.,"Upland, CA",0,12,2,1.0,1/30/2017,Worst experience ever I will never attend this restaurant again the manager named Paul was a disrespectful jerk my family and I have contacted corporate in regard to his behavior I wouldn't even have given one star if it weren't for the fact that I needed to in order to leave a comment this complaint is going all the way to the top
Staci L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,31,12,3.0,1/26/2016,"Depending on the day you come, your server, and where you sit, this place is a hit or miss! I come to this location at least four times a month because I live and work across the street.  Suggestions: Come on a week day and do not sit outside! Sitting outside is basically asking to be ignored by the servers and weekends are so hectic you won't even be able to ask for more butter for your bread! Nonetheless, the food is decent, but the lunch specials are what makes it worth coming! There is also a new addition to the menu called ""superfoods"" which is great for vegans and vegetarians like myself! I recommend the falafel salad (extra dressing on the side since kale is a little bitter), french country salad, herb chicken, and da vinci pasta. They recently redid their herb chicken so it's a little crispier which I like and the da vinci pasta I always ask for bowtie pasta since I think it tastes better! Careful with the cheesecakes because the chocolate ones are EXTREMELY sweet! Definitely share!"
