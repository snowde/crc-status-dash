Ethan Y.,"Arcadia, CA",48,15,11,1.0,7/16/2016,was here yesterday about 11pm it was a  Friday night. We were told that we needed to come back in 15 for a table.  We went out to smoke and came back after 5 minutes ...because we are Asians. I sat there and saw an couple went in Before us.  Another group of people came in and were told the restaurant was going to close soon. Ok then why the hell tell us to come back in 15. During the whole time the blonde recieptionist was chatting with a waiter behind the counter and we didn't went in until the other person came back and brought us to our shitty little table that was probably not occupied by anyone when we first here. So fk that.  I went to the restroom and saw a lot of empty seats in other areas. I haven't been feeling being treated so shitty since high school. Our waiter (the one chatting behind the desk ealier) was so funny. He asked me what I ordered which was fine but gosh it was the first thing I ordered and I swear I saw he was writing something on that little piece of paper. He was probably just drawing the food I guess and forgot about the first one he drew.   Sent the wrong drinks to us (the 3 drinks was ordered by those people sitting behind us on the bar table. and we don't even have 3 people.    He looks old but not that old okay. Had such a shitty night and will probably return since it's so close to my place.
Bobbie G.,"Walnut, CA",138,75,27,4.0,3/14/2016,"Love coming here for the awesome happy hour! 4pm to 4:45pm is the best time to come to beat the bar and dinner crowds. It's all about those Buffalo blasts, sweet corn tamale cakes, fried cream cheese wontons, avocado egg rolls, and deep fried mac and cheese balls! Get a side salad for less guilt LOL! Each platter was 5.50 or less... What a steal! I do come here for dinner too, ( love their chicken and dumplings platter) just prefer happy hour. Will most definitely be back!"
Dalena D.,"Burbank, CA",415,338,20,5.0,11/24/2015,"This is easily me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurant at the Santa Anita Mall.  The lunch specials are awesome, and the food is so amazing and well prepared.  I envy their seafood vendors- because I am telling you, they have the most tender juicy salmon- everytime.  I just love their food and desserts!  Try their salad or any of their seafood dishes, yum!  :) Also the service here is always top-notch.  They are very attentive to your experience as a guest."
Christine S.,"West Covina, CA",76,85,131,5.0,3/23/2016,"I can't believe I have never wrote a review for this place! I come here every week with friends and family. Service is always great. I tend to come here Monday through Thursday because there usually isn't a wait, Friday through Sunday though there is always a wait during dinner time, usually averages around 30 min or so. My usual favorites are; Appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls, and the spinach dip Entrees: chipotle chicken pasta, kale salad, Asian chicken salad, the miso salmon, chicken fettuccine with added Sun dried or oven tomatoes. My favorite cheesecakes are Ghirardelli chocolate, Oreo, banana cream and the Reese 's peanut butter cup chocolate cheesecake.  The carrot cake is also yummy. I can't wait till my next visit."
Tiger K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,6,2.0,10/1/2016,"Came here with my girlfriend in yet another overcrowded night at the ""opiate of the masses"" Arcadia Mall. LOL. My primary reason for coming to this chain restaurant is for the drinks and variety of food. Notice I said ""variety "" and not ""quality "". We ordered our ""go to"" dishes, Angel hair pasta with shrimp, firecracker salmon and goat cheese and beet salad.  Let's start with the appetizers. The firecracker salmon was less salmon than firecracker sauce. Lots of shredded cabbage garnish, but only 3 very tiny salmon rolls. Barely a mouthful. Goat cheese and beet salad was light on all the key ingredients, namely the cheese, the beets, walnuts and heavy on the bitter tasting arugula. Lastly, the shrimp and angel hair pasta was super small and overpowered by what tasted like canned tomatoes. I like the portions, quality and ambience of the Pasadena location much better. Arcadia is all ""snooty"" and no value for the high prices. Won't be back to this place. 'Nuff said"
Katerina Y. Y.,"Arcadia, CA",13,125,385,3.0,11/13/2016,"What happened Cheesecake factory?  3 for the food, but 5 excellent for the service.  Our waiter Cesar was so on,  and attentive.  Filled our glasses twice in the less than one hour we were there.  Service was fantastic, our hostess actually smiled before seating us. Cesar came and greeted us right away and let us know he was.getting someone's order and would be right back.  So unlike the service of decades,  I would definitely feel less reluctant to go visit this establishment."
Stevo O.,"San Gabriel, CA",197,627,975,4.0,3/11/2015,"The one thing I know is consistency, and that's what makes TCF my favorite place to dine (including Rock Sugar in Century City).  Their table breads are soft, with a choice of white sourdough or brown squaw bread; we never can have enough of the squaw bread though...  I prefer the fish tacos because they are done the best I've tried throughout the LA Area (gringo style).  I can't compare this to street tacos though because they are so much different when served from a food truck.  Of course, the cheesecake at the end of dinner is what we all look forward to, and fortunately, I invested in gift cards that came with free cheesecakes, so I'll have some more dining to do before the end of March!"
Annie L.,"Monterey Park, CA",782,509,714,1.0,10/19/2014,"After my dining experience here last night.. I told myself never again! The WAITING GAME:  Came here for a quick dinner with my momma and we had to wait about 30 minutes for our table. Once we were buzzed on our device, I just assumed that we would  be seated immediately right after .. WRONG. I went up to the hostess to return the device to her and then she said please line up to the right of the counter. It took another 5-10 minutes on top of the 30  to even get seated at our table. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER! Service:  Horrible and nonexistent. At one point, another server even had to step in to help me box my food.  Ambiance:  I did not even remember this place being so loud. We were blessed by the presence of  a group of young men that were very rowdy and obnoxious! After they were seated, we just decided to ask for the check because they were that bad.  **Story time: The guys belched so loud, that my mom thought that it was coming from me and began to scold me to be more ladylike. Thanks mom -_-"", but you have trained me well on my table manners! Food: GROSS and OVERPRICED! Steak Diane ($19.95):  The only thing I enjoyed on the plate was the mashed potatoes! The steak and sauce were both too salty. I would think that American restaurants would know how to cook their steak right.. WRONG! I ordered a medium rare and got medium!  BBQ chicken pizza ($12.95): Pathetic. The pizza was drenched in sauce and had no signs of chicken on it!  For your information, I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and not lunchables! Final Verdict:  NEVER COMING BACK!"
Monserrat L.,"Montebello, CA",26,43,35,4.0,5/11/2016,"My favorites are the Chinese chicken salad, the orange chicken and their glazed salmon plate"
Marie T.,"Crestline, CA",2,31,1,4.0,7/23/2016,"I really enjoy Cheese Cake Factory and their menu.  I went to the Arcadia location yesterday evening with my 2 granddaughters. We had been inside the mall and went in and gave our name. It was a 30 minute wait so we said we would sit outside to be seated right away. We did not know that the ashes from the terrible fires were blowing and going into our water, in our hair etc. and making plates dirty. When we asked to be moved ( willing to wait) our waiter Caesar became very annoyed making an uncomfortable situation for us.  I was ready to leave the restaurant because of his poor attitude. I was told they were no longer seating outside because of that issue. Luckily Gabby moved us and was very polite.  There is nothing like good customer service and Gabby made sure we were well taken care of. She made a negative experience into a good one.  She saved the day, that is why I am giving to 4 stars."
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,4.0,6/2/2013,"We haven't been to any The Cheesecake Factory restaurant for long time. I've almost forgotten about how good it was, great comfort food in huge portions! I have always loved their big and vast menu, lots of choices. They now have low calories menu with drinks, tapas and entrees, it's great for light eaters! The cheese cake menu is my favorite, I don't usually eat cheese cake, but I just have to have a slice here! They serve lunch till 5pm everyday, it's good deal, happy hour at bar area from Monday- Friday.  We started with Ahi tartare, it's small plate, tiny portion but very fresh and flavorful. Great with a Stella draft. Hubby had Jambalaya pasta, it's dinner portion only, it was fairly delicious, but not as good as I remembered, the pasta was a little hard and chewy.  I had lemon- herd roasted half chicken, I am PMS so bad, I really had to break my Pescetarian diet for some light meat protein, the chicken is free range all natural organic chicken, so I guess it was OK for me to eat just once. Glad I ordered it, the chicken was sooooo tender, the sauce was very flavorful, I asked our server to bring me some more of it, I almost wanted to ask the recipe, the tender chicken meat with that amazing sauce.... just the type of comfort food I needed! The mashed potato was very light and yummy, it was a good balance with the strong flavored chicken.  We had tiramisu cheesecake, loved it, not too sweet, the perfect mix flavors of tiramisu and cheesecake! The house made cream was soooo good! I had another Stella draft to go with it.  Great late lunch, I was very satisfied! the service was good, friendly and attentive. This meal reminded me that I should go to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants more often. Especially now I can do both comfort meal, and small plates light meal there!"
Cynthia A.,"Pasadena, CA",34,45,37,1.0,10/15/2016,Went here for an afternoon piece of Cheesecake and grabbed a table in the bar. Our server came over and brought us table settings and water and then NEVER came back. We made eye contact several times but we were just ignored. After 15 minutes we finally just got up and left and I've never done that before. Very disappointed.
Garen A.,"Montebello, CA",487,671,2009,3.0,8/5/2013,"Cheesecake Factory definitely has one of the most expansive menus around - I mean what don't the serve?? This last time I started with an alcohol infused milkshake (called the Flying Monkey) - it had Godiva Liquor and was actually quite delicious.  We also had the Mac N Cheese Balls (good, but too heavy) and the Avocado EggRolls (I'm not a huge avocado person, but they aren't bad).  I love the Luau Salad here ... it's probably my favorite thing on the menu! We always get that to share with a few friends (the crunchy wonton pieces are worth fighting over).  I decided to try their chicken tacos during my most recent visit - not much of a fan ... they definitely need more flavor to them.  The service is hit or miss ... last time our second waiter (because they always seem to swap waiter shifts when I'm there) was not as attentive as our first - If I've noticed the absence of a waiter for more than 10 minutes, something is wrong.  Also, the lighting at all Cheesecake Factories needs an upgrade ... it's way to dim inside - I can barely read the menu or see my food - both somewhat important parts of my restaurant going experience!"
Lammia W.,"Arcadia, CA",10,3,100,4.0,9/16/2016,Good foods but long queue. And they takeout the Salmon Genovese which is my all time favorite. Why????? I'm sad.
Wilfred Y.,"New York, NY",322,24,158,4.0,4/21/2015,"I think over the years, Cheesecake factory is trying to reinvent itself to be more health conscious so that is why they creates the light menu? But let's face it, when you decide to go there you know you are adding another hour to your gym routine the next day to weight-lift off the calories from that 2 pound Alfredo pasta or New York Steak. It's a great place for group of friends or family. We always do family style and I love all the appetizers. The sliders are cheezy good and the nacho plate with the same gratuitous amount of melted cheese is equally delicious.  The interior decoration at the Santa Anita mall probably has a more beautiful interior decoration than some of the other locations. But still it has the same gold and yellow art-deco-esque theme, which to me is beginning to get a little old. They might consider to update the look of the restaurant if they want to appeal to the younger or hip crowds. But we mostly do not come here for a posh dining experience. It's a great place for fun gatherings."
Belinda J.,"Pasadena, CA",57,128,260,4.0,3/23/2015,"I've only eaten at Cheesecake Factory twice - once at the Americana and once at the Santa Anita mall location. The interior decor is really quite beautiful, both classy and elegant from floor to ceiling. While the restaurant isn't high end or even considerably fancy, the atmosphere inside does elevate the restaurant to a level above your average chain. We were seated promptly at a cozy booth since there were many empty seats (some hostesses will actually seat a party of 2 at a tiny table when other larger ones are available). Our server (didn't catch his name) was extremely friendly and professional the entire time. I even commented to my date that it was a breath of fresh air having servers who didn't seem to hate you, their jobs and life in general.  Ordered a dirty martini, the grilled pork chop and the chicken madeira. Both dishes were good, nothing mind blowing, and very filling with great portion sizes. Even picked up a slice of cheesecake to go for my little sister and she loved it. Good place to stop by for a hearty lunch or dinner."
Yelp D.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,27,16,1.0,2/26/2016,"I'm sorry I am not a fan. Ordered shrimp scampi with a steak and instead got mash potatoes from California to Massachusetts. The steak was suppose medallion according to the waitress and the manager which was really just chunks of meat. As for the scampi, you are better off picking at it with a tooth pick. The plate was all mash potatoes. We were seated at the worst table where the servers get the linen and silverware.  So disappointed, I just settled for a filet o fish at Mc Donald's. I will never come to another Cheesecake Factory so help me GOD."
Sergio Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",4927,521,7192,4.0,8/24/2014,"After we finished dinner at the Wood Ranch bbq just next we decided go to the Cheesecake Factory to get a slice of their world famous Cheesecake.   It's been many years ago even my doesn't remember WOW!!!!  Anyway we were looking at Cheesecake display another amazing wow so many different style and flavor of cheesecake.  We were fighting what kind of cheesecake did we want I told my wife let's get two different slice of cheesecake, but she say to me just one slice I say ok. It  was hard to choice we decided to the 30th anniversary edition looks very good and devilish chocolate good.    We took home.   The Cheesecake was so good even the chocolate have a good similar flavor I know I figure out they use Godiva chocolate one the best chocolate wow, the Cheesecake Factory top themselves with this devilish dessert."
Pengpeng Helen W.,"Glendora, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/18/2015,"Very disappointed with their service today . We got here at five pm, they told us that we have to wait to have at least 15 people to be seated. We got 15 people around 5:30. The front desk lady keeps telling us that they are putting tables together for our group . We waited & waited .... Until 6:23, the customer who was eating at the other table finally left & they did "" put the table together"" for our group after an hour waiting.  If they are waiting for the other customers to leave , at least should be upfront with us. Not keeps saying putting tables together."
Jonathan M.,"Monterey Park, CA",75,16,7,4.0,4/30/2017,The cheesecake from this place is the only cheesecake I can eat. Most cheesecakes from other places are either too rich or too dry. I also love the Chicken Madeira. The chicken is thin and tender. The cheese and sauce go well with the chicken. It's just a bit overpriced in my opinion.
