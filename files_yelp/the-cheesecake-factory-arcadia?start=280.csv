John A.,"Altadena, CA",12,30,25,3.0,9/18/2016,"My honey and I were very disappointed ,good food but what kill it was the bartender was so unprofessional. My sweet darling ask how a certain wine was? The bartender sarcastically said she didn't know ;( like we're bothering  her. We should have left but it was my first time there, so we  ate  our meal at the bar despite that had to deal with the bartender and agree not to return to this Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia."
Patricia P.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,50,18,5.0,3/13/2016,"Delicious taste to salmon, lettuce wrap tacos and yummy bread and butter. The strawberry lemonade is so good. The service is great, the prices are ok."
Janice Y.,"Temple City, CA",101,13,29,4.0,5/13/2015,"Food is delicious but is on the expensive. I think it is perfect for a dinner date.  Service was friendly. Lighting is a bit on the dim side. If you plan to go, try to make a reservation or go early to beat the crowds."
Liz P.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,8,,1.0,4/10/2017,"I WISH I COULD PUT NEGATIVE ZERO FOR CUSTOMER  SERVICE ! ME AND MY BOYFRIEND WENT FOR MY Birthday on 3/27/17  ..on a Monday night , we waited more then a hour for our dinner !!! we sat down at 7 pm and food was served at 8:23 pm  when we asked the waiter why it was taking so long he answered and said "" I cant answer that for you "", so we asked for the manager , manager came out 10 min after with our food and said the order was put in 20 min ago ... instead of him making the situation better he made it worst , he made it seem as we where lying and the waiter put it in order late ! Sorry not great management skills ! Anyways he told us he would check up on us in a few  and if we needed anything let him know ! waiter only came back onetime during the 30 min that we ate and the manager  never bothered either ...so it gets worse we finally just got up and went to the front lobby to pay our bill , I see the manager standing around talking to other managers ,sees I am upset and just smiles ! The waiter then brings me a dessert with a candle AS WE ARE WALKING OUT  ..omg what a sucky b-day day ..Thanks cheesecake factory for your horrible customer service ..Totally walked out and left there desert that was given to me at the check out!!!!!"
Amy N.,"Rosemead, CA",77,3,,3.0,9/21/2016,"I don't know if it was due to the fact that I was there at a late time but still; the waiter wasn't so gracious, he wasn't bad but he wasn't good either. I don't think I saw him a lot during our meal. My meal was on the salty side and i just just didnt care for their dish (jambalaya pasta) which really got me mad because I yelped their popular dishes prior to going. I've never tipped under 15% before or ever let my friends do so, but in this case I was completely fine with tipping under 10%.  -if only I could give them a 2.5 star rating."
Alex M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",119,388,1757,5.0,12/28/2014,"Had a gift card from Christmas that we decided to use. Place was super crowded but we opted to sit outside and got seated right away. We ordered buffalo blasts that were pretty much life changing! They were really good. But of course like most restaurants, a little skimpy with the sauce... So ordered extra. We decided to order off the skinny menu. I ordered Tuscan chicken and was very surprised with not only how good it tasted but the portion size. My fiancée ordered the Asian chicken salad which was large and in charge as well. Our waitress was nice and informative but took just a little too long in checking on us. We understood, they were busy. Would go back, at least for those buffalo blasts."
Alice H.,"Alhambra, CA",54,428,662,1.0,12/26/2014,"This review is about their reservation policy. Tried to book a reservation for my family since we have guests visiting from out of the country. Called to book a reservation and they said they don't have reservations on the weekend after 6.  I understand it's the busiest time and they don't want to loose potential customers if a large table is already reserved and that party is late. So I rescheduled with all my family to try a weekday reservation, called back and they said they still could not make my reservation as I didn't have the right number of people! What?!"
Danielle V.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/31/2017,So we came here around 7pm on a Wednesday and it was a little busy but we were seated within 5 minutes!! Yaaayyy lol our server was Lee and he was great! He was very attentive and he also Interacted with our kids! The food came out within 10-15 mins and the bloody Mary's were bomb! Thank you Lee for your great service and we will be back very soon.
Jenny N.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",4997,258,2401,2.0,7/19/2014,"Located in the Santa Anita Westfield Mall, outside between Benihana and Woodranch. Their menu is huge! They serve cocktails, pizzas, burgers, pastas, tacos, seafood, and of course cheesecake. I've come here a couple of times because it was convenient, but I really wouldn't come if I had the choice. We were given a buzzer and told our wait would be approximately 25 minutes, but I think it ended up being more like 15 minutes. The interior is pretty large and has nice decorations. They also offer outdoor patio seating. Our server was pretty nice to us the entire time and came to check up on us once or twice during our meal. MISO SALMON ($19.95): fresh miso marinated salmon served with snow peas, white rice and a delicious miso sauce, but I substituted with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I did not taste any miso flavoring in the dish and it tasted like teriyaki salmon. Salmon was perfectly cooked. FACTORY BURGER ($11.95): charbroiled with cheddar cheese, tomato and grilled onions on sourdough. Tasted just like any other burger you can get elsewhere. STRAWBERRY LEMONADE ($4.50): with complimentary refills. CHEESECAKE ($6.95-$7.95 per slice depending on what kind): I like their white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and OREO dream extreme cheesecake. Downside: Utensils were dirty. I would think they have CLEAN utensils especially the way they charge each dish/drink."
Mo C.,"Covina, CA",31,66,101,5.0,1/19/2017,"we went yesterday the wait wasnt that long during dinner time. we went for my birthday. our waiter was nice and he was a great waiter. my wife and I ordered the steak Diane with shrimp scampi. it was the most perfect dish. the steak was so tender, the mushrooms and onion were so flavorful from the sauce they put, best steak I've had. the shrimp scampi was declious with the cream sauce. the mashed potatoes with flavorful as well. we also ordered the avocado egg rolls. those were the best egg rolls I've had. the sauce it comes with is sweet. we also got 2 cheesecakes to go. excellent food and service."
Matt A.,"Pasadena, CA",49,218,161,4.0,8/10/2014,"Its consistent for a cheesecake factory.  Its at the mall so parking can be a pain specifically on major nights (Friday and Saturday).  I prefer valet on those days.  The food was good and service was good as well.  I got the hibachi steak with wasabi mashed potatoes.  Overall as a dish it was good however the steak after some time got a little salty.  The mashed potatoes are seasoned with wasabi butter which was good.  I've been here a few times and have ordered several pastas, my favorite is the Chipotle Chicken.  They used to have a really good thai peanut pasta I hate they removed from the menu.  I also like some of the buffalo chicken starter (they're wrapped in a triangle wrapper)."
Patty C.,"Pasadena, CA",1,14,,5.0,10/26/2015,"I LOVE this cheesecake factory!!!!! Everything is absolutely amazing, from the food to the service!  Kids menus have a great variety of choices.  the wait is usually no more then 30 min on a weekend. (at least when I've gone) Servers and hostess are always polite and helpful."
Judy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,27,164,4.0,8/25/2015,"I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years, usually for brunch or dinner. My server Amanda recommended the Renee lunch special for $10.95. Comes with fresh tossed salad, soup, and choice of turkey or chicken almond salad sandwich. Since it is Cheesecake, the portions were more than enough. Nice to see that the restaurant includes budget conscious lunch menu items."
Natalie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",417,610,1434,2.0,7/2/2014,"Do they even care about customer service? I feel like they dont give a crap because its cheesecake factory. You know what I mean? Since everyone knows what CF is and they are already well-known to the public, even with the below-average customer service, people still come. Thats the only analogy I can come up with. Use the happy hour wisely. Get many appetizers for $5 which is a good deal indeed. They even have happy hour for cocktails, beer and wine for wine lovers like me. Try their spicy chicken chipotle pasta. You will love it. Portion is too big but you can always take the leftover home. Like I said, service is extremely slow here. I am very impatient and I couldnt stand it, especially during my recent visit to this place. Awful!"
Mayte S.,"West Covina, CA",26,84,14,5.0,7/19/2016,"Came here yesterday for lunch and the service was excellent!!!! The food on the lunch menu, was perfect!!!! Great service and great food made it a wonderful day!!'"
Maximus G.,"South Pasadena, CA",6,80,605,4.0,9/11/2015,"We are a house divided!  We went to the Cheesecake Factory for our anniversary - the  wife says +5 stars - I say 4.  While I thought the food was just ok, the cheesecake was excellent!  I had the Shepherds Pie and with wife had Chicken and Biscuits.  My Shepherds Pie could have used a little more gravy, but was ok.  The wife's chicken and biscuits was very good.  I had the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake and the wife had Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  A little less of the cookie dough would have been better - it was overpowering and very dense."
Enrique G.,"Culver City, CA",11,9,3,4.0,1/13/2017,"It was a long stressful day at work so i decided to have dinner with my Girlfriend at this location on Sunday 01/08/2017. Walked in and of course like everywhere else on a Sunday evening there was a wait not a long wait but a wait. We got sat within 15 minutes our Server was Abraham about 5'7 with a beard. Anyways let me tell you he was great took a lil longer then usual to get our drinks but he was on it for everything else. I'm a General Manager for a restaurant so i know everything about serving and he did an amazing job. 5 stars for Abraham!!! Now the only reason why i have the store a 4 star when they needed a 5 star because of Abrahams great service is that the Restroom needed a major cleaning. As i walked in the trash was full to the max with paper towels in the grown both stalls did not have toilet paper, i just walked in and walked back out when i saw no toilet paper. So an advice keep an eye on the restroom especially at a busy restaurant like this one."
Emily C.,"Culver City, CA",447,252,228,3.0,6/10/2014,"I'd recommend coming for the lunch specials or happy hour (Mon - Fri: 4 - 6pm) Parking: On the weekends, the mall is always super packed and it's tough to find parking, especially in the shaded areas. I usually have to circle the lot a good 5-10 minutes before actually finding parking. Service: I usually experience pretty good service at Cheesecake Factory. The staff is always friendly and helpful, although they may not be attentive when you need them. Sometimes, the food isn't cooked to my liking, and they're always willing to remake it (I'm hoping no one has ever spat in my food). Food: My favorite thing to order here is the Ahi Tartare small bites. The tuna is probably not the freshest, but with the avocados and sauce, it really doesn't matter. Next favorite is the avocado eggrolls. The tamarind salsa is so yummy that we always ask for an extra. Also, there is so much avocado inside! Try to catch happy hour so that you can get the avocado eggrolls for $5 (normally $10)! As for the entree, I normally order the Pasta da Vinci. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I enjoy the pasta. Sometimes, it's made too salty for me, so it just depends on the day - some days are good while others are not. For lunch, I like to also order the Pizza & Salad combo. I think it's a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get, but the size of the pizza might have gotten smaller. I am not a fan of their other pastas/entrees. Make sure to save room for dessert! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not try one of their cheesecakes! Most of the chocolate based cakes are too rich and heavy for me. My favorite cheesecake is Vanilla Bean, Original, and the Tiramisu. The Vanilla Bean is my all-time favorite and is probably the only one I can finish an entire order of without feeling sick. It's not too sweet and is delicious!"
Zach A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,23,,1.0,6/25/2015,"I ordered the crab dip. I took a bite and it was cold. I told my waitress about that first bite, and she asked me if I WANTED it warm. Like it was ME who was wrong. I explained that yes, it should be warm. She took it away, brought it back after it surely spent 20 more seconds in the microwave, and never offered an apology. Certainly didn't deduct it from my bill.  I know that's just one plate of food at one Cheesecake Factory, but I see that whole anecdote as an example of the entire Cheesecake Factory system. Which is: A customer comes in wanting a shovel of food, and the staff is eager to put whatever they want on that shovel. Presentation isn't important. Not even taste. It's just calories go in, money goes out. This is why it is called Cheesecake FACTORY and not Cheesecake RESTAURANT.  If what you're looking for in a meal is high efficiency and minimal shame from the wait staff, CF is your jam. Otherwise, come on--you can do so much better."
Anthony F.,"Solvang, CA",2,14,54,4.0,6/21/2015,"First time here on a Sunday morning to celebrate my cousin's B'Day It happens to be Father's Day today. They open at 10am and by 9:45, line is already 30 deep. Good thing we r first in line ! Food is good as expected."
