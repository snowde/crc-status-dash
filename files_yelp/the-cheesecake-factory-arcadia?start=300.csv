Dorian J.,"Covina, CA",33,36,13,1.0,6/5/2016,"Gross! How are you going to seat us at a table with dirty silverware. Not just my silverware but both of  ours were dirty with large amounts of food. Then have a snotty attitude when I ask for a replacement, what's the deal with the place settings too? Why do all the tables get silverware placed directly on the table ? I don't think it's very sanitary , everywhere else places them on a napkin"
Amy L.,"Oxnard, CA",64,50,13,2.0,7/5/2016,Ive been to many locations of cheesecake factory and this location has the worst customer service. We went for dinner and our waiter was completely horrible. After he took our drink and food order he was not seen again til we asked for our check. He didnt bring our drinks he also wasnt the one who brought us our food. When my son wanted ketchup i waited 10 minutes for our waiter to come by to ask but when he never showed up i asked a random waitress and she brought it out for us even though it should have been his responsibility. Me and my husband are very upset by the service from this waiter. We wont be coming back however i hope the manager will manage their staff better in the future.
Monica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2357,1171,1522,2.0,4/18/2014,"I've come here a couple times because it was convenient, but I really wouldn't come if I had the choice. I don't know much about the carb-y options, but I've gotten a bunch of their salads. Whether its from the ""Healthy"" portions menu or normal menu, the chicken is very sparse or just NOT THERE!! Happened to me and my friend on two separate occasions, and I've had to ask for chicken on my grilled chicken salad! Other times, I've had to pick through the lettuce to find some strips of protein, like a gold miner back in the olden days of good ol' cali. The ""healthy"" dressing is thickened to the point where it looks like thawed out frozen gravy, and tastes even worse.  Seriously, all the salads are not that great, minus the ahi tuna salad because you get a good amount of ahi, though the salad part is not much to look at. Don't come here to be healthy. If you come, come to FEAST LIKE A KING!! Then maybe the food won't be as atrocious. So people coming from Gold's Gym....go to CPK and get the salad there instead. You will thank me!"
Sheila S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",133,112,75,4.0,7/24/2015,"It's a chain, and it's ALWAYS very busy, which I think partly explains the bad reviews. We went on Sunday around 2:30 pm and it took us almost 15 minutes to find parking. Not their fault, but something you should consider before coming here. They don't take reservations and they told our party of 8 it's going to be 45 min wait, which ended up being around 15 min. Awesome!  I've always had good service and great food here. The waiters don't check up on you often, but that's understandable for a restaurant this busy. For the most part our waitress did a great job refilling our waters and bread basket.  Some of my faves are: miso salmon, avocado egg rolls, shrimp and chicken gumbo, and chicken bellagio. Yeah, most items are a little overpriced but the portions are huge. The extensive menu makes them an easy option whenever we have a big group."
Gina M.,"Whittier, CA",7,29,3,5.0,5/28/2015,"I celebrated my daughter's birthday here on 5/26/15. I came in at 6:00p.m with about 9 adults and 12 children. We were seated promptly (I did give them a heads up two hours before) and treated with the utmost kindness and respect, despite the fact that we had a group of very rambunctious children. Everyone - from hostess to waiters and bus people - was very accomodating and had a smile on their face. I had asked them to refrigerate my daughters birthday cake and they even brought the cake out with the candles lit and sung happy birthday! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their dinners (except for some of the kids, for some reason, who didnt like the pizza). The best part? I was extremely pleased with the reasonable bill. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory for helping to make my daughter's birthday an awesome experience for her."
L0505 W.,"Arcadia, CA",14,3,1,1.0,4/6/2016,"This review is particular for some people who works at this location. I always order to go from this location, they always so nice, and I love it. But however, today I have a lunch in the restaurant, the lady I don't know her name, but she's service is perfect, nothing wrong. We finished our order, then waiting for the food.  Finally the food coming in, but there was a different lady sent us the food, she staring at my food few seconds, I noticed she keeping staring at my food, but I didn't say anything, then she put the food on the table, I am going to eat, but I found a long hair in my food, that's so disgusting! And I just realized why she staring at my food so long, she already knew there was a hair in my food, but she didn't say anything! So I have to called other people to help me get a new food, and waiting the manager come.  I don't care how much I paid for the food. The manager asked me if she can offer me some soup or salad, I told her no, thank you. I just want eat the food I ordered.  I still paid everything at the end. But it's really bad experience at this location. Some employee need to retraining, and it's not ok when you found a hair in your food, and nobody care about it."
Karen U.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,1,10,2.0,7/10/2016,"I'm very disappointed with our dinner tonight at Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia.  We ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp and shrimp scampi.  Both dishes are tasteless.  Shrimp scampi was so dry, no garlic and no sauce at all!  My shrimp with Angel hair pasta had too much tomatoes and had no taste at all !"
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,110,19,2.0,6/27/2015,"Can never blame the food....seems to always be on par or above! What made me downgrade tonite is the host! Standing at the check-in and just being ignored for 45 seconds as if we weren't visible was just rude!  With about 4 peeps working the check-in, the host could have acknowledged us and ask us to wait a few more.....but that didn't happen!  It's about the front end.....if they don't take care of the customer.....don't matter how good the back end is!"
Sam L.,"Fontana, CA",4,29,29,5.0,12/20/2015,"Love it here, we came in with no reservations and the front check in desk seated us asap...AWESOME!!! Our server Jen was awesome, she catered to our every need. The best time to come to this Cheesecake Factory would be between 4pm - 5pm. Will come back here definitely when we're in town."
Wing M.,"CA, CA",1,57,48,1.0,5/10/2015,"I have high expectations from this restaurant but had a disappointing experience yesterday. One of my orders included breakfast potatoes. But they looked like they were left over from the day before. They were way overcooked with most of them too hard to eat. Made a complaint and they offered to make another batch. We declined. However, they brought out another one... and it looked exactly the same! They tried to justify that the breakfast potatoes always look like that. We go to Cheesecake Factory quite often and have had breakfast potatoes before. And they look nothing like these!  To me, the manager has no knowledge of food at this location and that is why the server doesn't either. There are 3 different things that could have been wrong: the oil is old, they were cooked too long, or cooked in the wrong equipment. I never knew breakfast potatoes were so deeply fried like these were."
Tim L.,"Monterey Park, CA",41,39,121,3.0,4/4/2016,"I got only 5 medium sized shrimp on an almost $19 shrimp pasta dish!... That's being extremely stingy. Extremely disappointing. For comparison we ate at a Mexican place for lunch and a $6 shrimp tostada there had 3-4x as many shrimp of the same size/quality. Our service was good, otherwise I'd give 2 stars."
Stanley P.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,55,5,2.0,8/21/2016,"I came here for a birthday party in July and the food was just not up to par for what I was paying for. However the service was great, they refilled our water and bread when it was empty.I ordered the Louisiana Parmesan Chicken Pasta and it was not warm, more like room temperature but colder. Very pricey and NOT WORTH IT. I don't think I'll be coming back here"
Dianne L.,"Tacoma, WA",1,17,6,5.0,3/9/2016,"We were here for dinner on a Tuesday night, so we didn't have to wait long to be seated. On a weekend,however; you would have to wait in crowded lobby with customers who are there to just pick up cheesecakes, customers for carryout and servers who are trying to carry food to customers at the bar. It's chaos to wait, plus there are limited seating (one bench). I suggest waiting outside or take short walk in the mall.  Food is always CONSISTENTLY amazing. Generous portions. My son and husband always order the bacon avocado burger that they called heaven. My daughter and I shared the chicken Bellagio, that is also served with pancetta and arugula salad. They ran out of arugula but it still tasted fabulous. We had the world best waiter, Cody OMG superb manner, he got down to eye level with my kids to take their orders. He got us everything we needed without having to ask. Very well spoken! Super professional! I'm super impressed!"
Ile B.,"Venice, CA",14,47,62,5.0,9/19/2015,Only good things to say about this location. Went out of  my comfort  zone and ordered the fish and chips and they were delicious. My kids loved it too. Their first time at CCF ...
Tracy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,55,71,4.0,11/27/2015,I've been coming here for years and I never had a bad experience here. Food is always good and customer service is good. I love the cheesecakes! It never disappoints me! They have Happy Hour here from Monday to Friday at 4-6pm. It's cheap during happy hour and you can get a good amount of food for $25!
Charlie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,9,1.0,3/1/2015,"Came here with my family for dinner, the food was good and so was the service. Now why the one star? Well I don't like bugs in my cheesecake! I ordered a cheesecake slice to go. Half way through the cheesecake I noticed a bug the size of a grain of rice crawling out of my cheesecake. Fml! I wish I would of noticed sooner who knows how many if any I ate. It's disappointing to know this location has these kind of standards where they allow bugs to breed in their food. Never going back again."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3524,954,21688,4.0,7/5/2012,"Mm.. what a great experience! i took the bf here to celebrate his birthday, and it was a great choice! The interior was beautiful and classy, and the service was excellent. The food is a bit expensive, so I would not come here unless there was a deal. [that's how I feel about Olive Garden, actually].  Here's what we got: Avocado Eggrolls Chicken Parmesan Sandwich That was only two orders, but it was very filling and very delicious! These were the only items I saw worth getting in an expensive place like this, but I loved what we chose! I wish we tried the cheesecake, but it was going to be $7 for a slice. Despite the priceyness, I can see what the fuss is all about! :)"
Eve B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,4.0,7/21/2016,A great place to have dinner. Their Thai Salmon entrée is awesome!
Shirley J.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,13,7,5.0,7/4/2016,Great Chinese Chicken salad big serving cheese cake was great . Will do it again. Good
David G.,"Fontana, CA",352,95,185,5.0,5/22/2016,"Menu is pages long and the options seem endless. This is one of the few places I've ever been where every choice is a good one. Salads, cocktails, pasta dishes, burgers, and of course desserts all awesome! Kobe Burger, Shiela's chicken and avocado salad, Passion ice tea great. Pineapple mojito looks and taste great! Just don't get full from the bread they start you with & make sure to save room for dessert!"
