Olivia B.,"San Gabriel, CA",72,227,1367,5.0,7/5/2014,"Such great service!! Dim lit environment feels so romantic and calm for date night. Staff was so friendly, they helped me get a drink not on the menu (ginger ale for my upset stomach) with a lime to squeeze for flavor. Staff is attentive when needed. Clean environment. I tried foods I didnt think id like and loved them!! The bread is so fresh. The mashed potatoes are a little too sweet and raw for my tastes. Every thing else tasted so good. The to go boxes come in a nice bag. And tastes just as good reheated. The cheese cakes are delicious and unique. The wait time doesn't take long. We will be back!!"

Doreece C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",5,10,6,1.0,1/29/2016,"NEVER EAT HERE!!!!!!!   Today we went for my aunt birthday now this was the worse experience EVER so we get here and they told us the wait was only an hour maybe an hour  and fifteen not bad for a Friday. We waited 2 hours and 20mins before we get seated the man who was in the front was rude  when we asked how much longer he gave us an attitude I believe his name is jebron . Well we finally get seated and our waitress Ivette was amazing. We ordered and  my mom order her favorite chicken while we are waiting for our food the people who were sat after us got there food before us. After waiting literally an hour for our food YES AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD we started to eat. While eating my mom found a hair in her food. we told the manager David that she found a hair. David did not seem to care at all that it made my mom sick she didn't want to eat or drink anything else and threw up.  David I felt dismissed how we felt and that my mom found a hair in her food because my family is very diverse we were treated like crap sad to say that it's 2016 and just because a family has black, Salvadorian and Mexican in there family we are treated like we aren't good enough. I'm soooooooo disappointed with this experience never thought it would be like this. On top of my mom finding hair in her food my little cousin who  order only chicken tenders had to wait an extra 20 minutes after we all revived our food to get just chicken tenders. NEVER EAT HERE  Go to the one in old town it's better and the managers aren't buttholes."
Binh T.,"San Gabriel, CA",375,652,2076,5.0,1/22/2014,"There is one thing the Cheesecake Factory has that I cannot seem to find anywhere else. And for that, they can have all the stars in the Yelptrum because I cannot perfect this fish on my own. (Also, service has always been great in this location).  MISO SALMON! Come for lunch and get the lunch portion which is more than enough at a cheaper cost but this is the dish to get. Choice of white or brown rice cooked in Miso sauce and then over the amazing sake butter sauce. Garnished with some snow peas, this is really one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  The wait can be a dread at this location especially during weekends and dinner time. Parking can also be hard to find as it is in a mall. Good luck with that!"
Pia F.,"Temple City, CA",5,55,10,1.0,3/31/2015,"Stopped by to pick up a bite and dessert to go. Took 10 min for someone to take my order . Kale salad and a slice of Oreo cheesecake . How hard ???? 40 min later , still waiting .... I asked ... & answer was: ' oh , what order ?' Wtf? Mind you... I've been sitting in lobby All this time !  I asked for the manager , when he came up.. I explained situation & caught him checking out another customer who was bent over putting her kid in the stroller . I lost it, folks .  I flipped him off and walked away. As I walked away, I in passing told the mom ... 'The guy at the desk is stroking off while staring at your ass behind the desk .' The look she gave him was well worth my F up ordeal !  If I want CF ... I'd visit the one in old town ! Least they got their sh!t together ."
Anna C.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,34,13,5.0,6/9/2016,"Messed up my order but server handled it very well and had the manager talk with us, who, then proceeded to take care of the situation in an according manner. Great service!"
Arye M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2017,"First off Cheesecake Factory, I'd like to know if you hire your employees straight out of the circus ? Because I've never met such a clown, as manger (Amber Knowles). Not only is she rude and inconsiderate but she's a liar. I placed an order three hours in advance for a happy birthday cheesecake with a happy birthday plaque (that I payed extra for) that should have said ""Happy 14th Birthday Meyance"" but when I got home it said ""Happy Bday Neyance"" with a horribly written ""14"" in the corner, honestly, it could of been mistaken for a 19. Who the hell they got writing on the cakes ? Because they need to get fired along with Amber. I repeated my order and the birthday girls name 3 times, you would think they would get it right and the most Amber can say is ""I understand"" like okay? I don't need you to understand I need you to make it right. I told her I was coming back even though I live 30 minutes away and wanted a full refund because I didn't touch that small ass 7-inch cheesecake that was 27 damn dollars. And she told me the most she can do is give me a gift card? I almost lost my damn mind. Like I said I live 30 minutes away, and I never come to Cheesecake Factory... How you gonna take my money, mess my order up and think you're not gonna refund my money? I have my receipt & I will be getting my full refund, because a claim has been made with corporate. Overall horrible experience should of got zero stars."
Elvin W.,"Temple City, CA",56,361,189,3.0,5/30/2014,"Food:  We ordered the tamales with chips, salasa and gucamole as appetizers.  My entry meal was a chicken dish - I can't remember the name but it was served with mash potatoes and some veggies.  The chicken was grilled with a lemon/citrus taste to it. Food rating:  3.5/5 Service:  Service here is good with plenty of helpful servers and waitress. Service rating:  4/5 Overall:  I think my overall experience was decent.  I just haven't found a go to food in this place."
Sara L.,"San Gabriel, CA",18,24,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"I used to LOVE this Cheesecake Factory, but the last two times I am wondering if the management or quality of control is lacking.  I visited the establishment April 29 and 30, 2016.  The first day I ordered chicken piccata and chicken wings, and cucumber lemonade.  Delicious!  An hour later I was vomiting!!!!   The next day my co-worker invited me to Cheesecake Factory. I raved about the chicken piccata before, and he ordered it.  Later that day he got sick, too.  Another small concern was when the gentleman who seated us was eating something.  I didn't see that as being professional.   I am apprehensive going there, again, or having any functions there.  Cheesecake Factory, we had a good run."
Aris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,,5.0,5/31/2016,"We have been going to this restaurant for sometime now and have always been impressed by their dishes and the service. I recommend Cheesecake Factory to all who are looking for a good atmosphere,  and good food at reasonable prices."
Fran B.,"Los Angeles, CA",835,614,120,4.0,5/1/2014,"I like Cheesecake Factory. I usually HATE chain restaurants like Chili's, Black Angus, or stupid ass f*king Claim Jumper. But Cheesecake is not like those restaurants. It's a lot classier (in terms of menu, service, and decor), and the food is actually good. Oh but I don't like their cheesecake. Tried a bunch of different flavors, but meh. Their cheesecakes are too creamy and not cheesy enough. I like my cheesecakes a little crumbly (think cheesy crumbly) and light, but rich. I don't want no soft ass, overly creamy cheesecake.  My favorite dish is probably the cajun jambalaya pasta. I loooove cajun seasoning, and this pasta has got it down right. It's a little spicy, flavorful, and packed up with plump shrimps and tender chicken. Actually, Cheesecake Factory has really good pastas. I've tried a bunch, including the angel hair pasta, da vinci something, and a few other ones (can't remember the names), and haven't ran into a bad pasta dish yet. I also liked the ""chicken littles"" dish, which I think is basically just chicken tenders? The fried mac and cheese is always a winner (what diet, right?). Also tried a couple salads and they were good. Overall, it's not the most gourmet food, but definitely consistent and a bit above average. Except their cheesecakes. They blow."
Linda S.,"Monterey Park, CA",27,103,117,2.0,3/12/2015,"The food here is good, however a bit overpriced considering other non-franchised options that offer better food quality. However, Cheesecake Factory offers a wide selection of items on their menu, making it a good restaurant to go to if you and your friends are having difficulties coming to an agreement on where to eat.  Besides the food, the service here is a hit or miss. From my most recent visit, the service was terrible. The hostess did not acknowledge us and took a while to get us seated on a weekday during the least busiest time of day. The servers here are chatty amongst themselves and often neglected us. They definitely need to implement procedural fairness into their service."
Jake W.,"Pasadena, CA",254,73,33,1.0,2/8/2016,"Tried to call in an order for two desserts and after waiting 15 minutes on hold I abandoned that strategy and just drove over. I then waited in line for a few minutes and when I asked the guy about the wait on the phone he was completely unapologetic, and just blamed it on the receptionist. I then had to wait 5 minutes for them to package up the two desserts which could have all been avoided if I wasn't on hold for so long. It would be far more understandable on a weekend but on a Monday night at 8:45 I'm not sure what could have been keeping them all so busy. Very disappointed. Don't bother trying to phone your order in, you're better off going just about anywhere else for dessert."
Priscilla M.,"Rosemead, CA",20,46,27,4.0,1/6/2016,"Always a good visit here! Got seated quickly and our waitress was beyond attentive! She was on it!! It was pretty busy but she made us seem like we were the only table she had! My boyfriend and I were very impressive! We were soooo happy with her service it made our dinner even more enjoyable! The food was delclious ands well and we didn't even have to ask for refills on our drinks because she was constantly refilling it up! This is our favorite Cheesecake around the area, super close to us so it's always a good experience when we go! Thanks for making my dinner dates great Cheesecake! See ya next time!"
Mary A.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,685,10817,4.0,3/26/2015,"Hands down the best Orange Chicken ever. Lightly battered white meat chicken pieces, mostly large with a light delicate sauce of orange with thin slices of orange peel. The vegetables with the sauce that it comes with are so good. I wish I could make vegetables like that at home. I wonder what sauce it is. I know I can definitely taste hints of sesame oil. The wait here is like any other Cheesecake Factory on peak hours & days. Their Chicken Bellagio is also one of my Ultimate favorites. The chicken is lightly breaded & tender. Topped with Prosciutto, parmesan & butter leafy Arugula. It comes with this delicious basil pesto spaghetti. Their mixed drinks are pretty well made. I prefer wine but their wine selection is mostly California wines which I hate.  Try their Dulce De Leche Cheesecake it's pretty sinful."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,12/23/2014,"This Westfield Arcadia is one of the nicest So Cal shopping malls that I have ever been to, and this Cheesecake Factory (TCF) location is no exception. I've probably been here about four times with several different friends, and I always experienced attentive service and a clean environment. Because I was dining with just one other friend, we usually didn't have to wait for too long to get seated (I think one exception was on a Saturday night for dinner, but that was during prime dinner time). Usually, I can count on being seated promptly (perks of dining in a small party). My great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory ensure my return if I'm ever at this mall or in the area. Though parking can sometimes be a pain (especially on the weekends or during holiday season), dining at this Cheesecake Factory has been mostly pleasant and hassle free.   I think the most memorable experience I had at this Cheesecake Factory location was dining with a friend for a late lunch/early dinner one Sunday afternoon, and the eatery wasn't too crowded. We ate at our leisure and I think we were actually in the restaurant for almost three hours total, just catching up, talking and having a good time. I love when dining experiences are memorable because of the company and because of the relaxing environment (would have been a totally different experience if we were rushed through our meal and the eatery was super crowded, as the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory always is).   Here are some of my favorites when it comes to dining at the famous CF: ""Fish & Chips"": My mom ordered this entrée once for dinner and I had one of her fish pieces. I'm always on the lookout for a good fish & chips meal, so I'm glad I got to try this dish. It features hand-battered fillets that are fried crisp and served with cole slaw, French Fries and tartar sauce. The fish's interior was moist and I did like the battered interior -- crispy, crunchy and buttery, but not overdone. I did like it enough to order it for my entrée in the future, but the fish pieces were pretty small for the hefty price of the meal. If the fish pieces were bigger, it might be more worth it, but that price holds me back and keeps me sticking to my usual burger/sandwich entrees. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake"":  I have ordered this cheesecake once, and though it was good, I felt that for this version, the red velvet cake would have tasted better when separated from the cheesecake. This was a combo that actually shouldn't have combined the two delicacies. I did like the red velvet cake, but felt that the cake itself could have been more moist. However, that cream cheese frosting was amazing and gave the drier cake some redemptive quality. I did like the Original Cheesecake as well, but again, it would have been better not to mix the two. At least I did get to try this red velvet fantasy. I still really like red velvet, but would have preferred this cake solo for dessert (or the cheesecake solo ... either or, not both at once). ""Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae"": My friend told me that she ordered an ice cream sundae from TCF before because the brownies were superb, so I might have to order one for myself to see what she's talking about. This sundae features a rich Godiva chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds. Since the brownie is Godiva, I believe it when my friend said that this was one of the best brownies she's ever tasted. I would get this sundae sans the whipped cream and almonds, but everything else sounds wonderful."
Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",392,555,703,2.0,1/5/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory!  But this particular location has awful take out service. My husband and I came on a Friday evening and the line wasn't particularly long for take out before I went to use the restroom.  I came out from the restroom and the line didn't move at all.  Usually it takes us less than five minutes to order a slice of cheesecake to go.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but there was a lot of people behind the counter.  After 15 minutes, we got our slice of red velvet cheesecake.  The cheesecake was superb.  Service was not."
Christine A.,"Granada Hills, CA",289,490,1392,5.0,8/17/2013,"This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory in all of Southern Los Angeles. It's larger compared to the Pasadena and The Grove locations, and if you don't come during the lunch/dinner rush, there is ample free parking. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to this place, so I tend to order between the meatloaf, chicken marsala, chicken madeira, or the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Every single time I have come here, the food is always perfect. Nothing is bland, or too cold. The meat is always flavorful, tender, and juicy. You can't go wrong.  Cheesecakes: I can never come here without having at least one for here, and one to go. My favorites are the banana cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal), cherry cheesecake, and the red velvet. Some of the other ones like the key lime, Snickers, etc. are a bit too sweet for me.  Downside: They have one burrito dish, they don't tell you on the menu, but it comes with white rice which I find odd. I didn't like that at all. Another downside is the wait. If you come during the lunch/dinner rush, especially on the weekend, be prepared to wait about an hour or longer.  Service here has always been great. Warm and friendly."
Calvin L.,"San Gabriel, CA",659,637,818,4.0,4/15/2014,"Located in the Santa Anita Westfield Mall, outside between Benihana and Woodranch. Chicken Madiera ($17.95) That's ALL you need to know when you come to Cheesecake Factory. EVERY time I order it, the waiter (whoever it is) gets so excited! It is to DIE for. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken breast, topped with CHEESE, mushroom, and some asparagus. As if that weren't enough; it also comes with a huge side of mashed potatoes. There is NEVER a need for to-go boxes, as I demolish this dish every. single. time. Chicken Lettuce Wrap Taco ($6.95) This is on the healthy menu. It was actually surprisingly not-bad. I just automatically assume everything on that menu is going to be gross, but this was pretty good. Probably wouldn't get it personally, but didn't mind having a bite or two. SkinnyLiscous Grilled Artichoke ($6.95) Okay, so this was NOT ordered by me. I had one bite, and I was done. This is way too SkinnyLiscous for me. It literally is an entire artichoke heart that's grilled with a side of aioli. PASS."
Sally M.,"Alhambra, CA",105,150,1018,5.0,11/21/2014,Zero wait time at 11:20am!  Came in for lunch after shopping today ...sweet and friendly hostess. Excellent and professional waitress. Shepard's pie ($11-ish lunch) is hearty and good. Pork chop is normally really good but a little over cooked today.
