Yasmin C.,"Monrovia, CA",29,42,6,2.0,5/6/2016,Waitress was slow. My son got his dinner first and then I had to wait for my dish to arrive. No apology and she seemed distracted and like she didn't care! Silverware was dirty and the whole dinner sucked! Not returning to this location! The drinks were good though.
Nanita L.,"Bakersfield, CA",97,304,360,4.0,4/14/2012,"It's all about.. you.. family.. and good food. Went with family for lunch on a Sunday, after shopping at the Westfield Mall. When walking in, I was handed a mobile, vibrating device that would call upon thee when thy seating was ready. It was very busy, but tranquil at the same time... with three-yo's crying and yelling for cheesecake and other foods.  After being seated, our server came promptly and I ordered a salmon plate, and it was very scrumptious. The portions are very generous, so you'd be filled up before the plate is half way through. Not only that, the fish is actually fresh and did not induce any allergic reactions.  All the while we were there, I  could't help but feel I was actually sitting within the caesar palace buffet at Las Vegas. The decor of the factory exudes  a richness that was.. very much flamboyant, and a bit overwhelming. I was full before they could serve the meal.. just by people watching and becoming one with the hectic-ness of the surrounding.  Overall, a good, clean, and entertaining place to have food; but definitely not on weekends."
Lawrence J.,"Sierra Madre, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/20/2016,"Had birthday dinner at Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia recently. As part of celebration had a classic Margarita. The Margarita was mostly ice. Didn't complain, but when I ordered a second one, I asked the server for less ice in the drink. When she bought my drink, it was just a little over half filled. She said they predetermine how much drink they put in, so since I didn't want much ice, this is how much it was. I think that's crazy. Asked to speak to manager. Had to ask to different staff members before manager, Kenny, came to my table. Explained my issue, he offered to bring my drink in a smaller glass since I didn't want as much ice. What the hell. Thought he was a terrible manager and told him as he walked away. Rest of meal was ok, but service level, and manager's attitude ruined it for me. Won't be going back."
Caroline G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,6,1.0,4/3/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I came in with my fiancé and baby. They seated us and the server never came to our table after waiting 20 minutes. They served tables around us and next to us in front of us everywhere. No one ever came to say ""hi I will be right with you."" I am very disappointed I had to walk out. This has never ever happened to me. Don't eat here!"
Davy C.,"Rosemead, CA",83,315,70,4.0,3/19/2014,"It's cheesecake factory, I think it's a you like it or you don't.  It took me about 3-4 years (1 or 2 visits a year) of trying things on the menu to find out I loved the place.  I always get the pasta carbonara w/ chicken and no peas now. No idea how authentic it is, but it's definitely worth trying if you're into creamy pastas and bacon. Seriously."
Stephanie V.,"Monrovia, CA",2,28,17,1.0,3/30/2016,"I use to love this place however this one star is specifically for the manager working take out/bakery today (3/30). I ordered a salad Togo asked for it to have dressing on the side... Came in there was dressing on the side and literally no lettuce. The employee helping me asked her manager if they could add lettuce and his response was ""it's the same as if you buy it when you eat here. That do you want me to do remake it?"" Not only was he insanely rude but he couldn't eve take two seconds to look me in the eye when he was bend disrespectful! Time for you to go back to leadership class and learn some customer service skills, way to set an example for your employees."
Mario M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,43,1,5.0,6/16/2015,"The food here is always consistently good. I keep coming back. I really like the Chicken Madeira and the Avocado Eggrolls. I also frequently order the Orange Chicken, which has a lot of meat in it, unlike many Chinese restaurants, where there is a little meat and mostly breading and sauce. Some people are complaining it is a little pricey, but the portion size is huge on many dishes. I think it's worth it for the quality and amount of food. Of course all of their Cheesecakes are good."
Jimmy A.,"West Covina, CA",13,51,49,3.0,5/9/2016,"We came at mothers day night. We usually like this place but that night it wasn't good. We ordered kids pizza and shepherd pie. The kids pizza its salty and burned also oily. The shepherd pie was not good at that time. The carrot it usually cut small pieces now cut big pieces. The sauce is too little, also the mushroom didn't see a lot. I don't know if they changed chef here, but please cook better."
Tawny V.,"Chino, CA",376,236,55,3.0,3/24/2014,I give three stars because it is a really crowded area. There was a long wait to get seated. This location is attached to a mall which makes it more busy.  I enjoy the macaroni cheese balls the most and the bread. The problem I find with cheesecake is that their menu is like a book! And some of their platters are meant for a bird!  They have really good mojitos here but lack on other mixed drinks. The service was excellent at this location and our waiter was very friendly and efficient.
Kim N.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",816,225,220,5.0,11/24/2014,Love their skinny menu! Their lemon drop here is on point too.  Got Erica and she gave amazing service!  Definitely coming back here and requesting for her!
Patty P.,"Azusa, CA",24,4,,3.0,4/16/2016,The food was good. It was super busy.. except for the part where my plate got thrown away. We were comp a replacement that was nice but the communication could  be better
Julius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,300,74,3.0,3/5/2016,"Perfect med rare burger, aioli mayo, deconstructed with a huge onion slice. nachos were overbaked/overfried/overcooked, chips were dark brown and oily. The chicken samosa roll was filled with a cheese sauce i didnt care for and the sauce that came with it was a heady honey mustard cilantro. The cheese sauce made the roll mushy and gooey, not a good samosa. The bread was great as always, the oat pumpernickle and the sourdough were tops."
HourLy L.,"Monterey Park, CA",186,282,301,4.0,12/21/2014,This place never disappoints but is also loaded with calories. I just found out my favorite pasta has over 3000 calories :( but otherwise the food is really good and they have a giant variety.
Johnson G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,299,197,4.0,3/11/2014,"If this is your first time at CF, read the menu before you go, like the night before if possible. They make pretty much everything. Hopefully this gives you enough time for you to figure out what you want. I have this problem in many places, but especially here. Fortunately I have found my dish: the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (lunch portion is plenty for the average appetite). Not as spicy as the Jambalaya Pasta, and thus more enjoyable.  And by all means get a slice of cheesecake, whether you eat it in or take it home. I go for the Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, a cross between cheesecake, a brownie, and a German chocolate cake, is my wife's pick."
Jenny B.,"Chino Hills, CA",355,241,135,4.0,10/5/2014,"Came to celebrate my nephews birthday on a Saturday evening.  It was one of the hottest day of the year so far.  Seems like everyone took refuge at the mall. Parking lot was extremely full. Arrived at 5:30pm & estimated wait time 30min. Not bad considering all the factors.  The interior was Mediterranean Vegas style decorated. They have a large menu selection. We had Davinci pasta, jambalaya, Chicken Madeira, kids cheese pizza, kids beef slider.  Everyone was pleased with their meal & the adult even took home left overs.  We didn't have enough room for dessert. Our birthday boy got a birthday song from the staff and a cup of hot fudge ice cream. Our meal came to $97.  Not bad for good food but slow service. They just need more help on the weekends."
Mal S.,"Sierra Madre, CA",86,344,70,1.0,2/9/2016,"I like the food here but the service is terrible on Fri/Sat nights. They do not handle the crowds well. My mom recently walked in (on 2/6/15) and asked for a table for 3. She was quoted a wait time and noticed that she had been waiting much longer than they had stated. She noticed that the guy handling the front desk (white male with facial hair) was allowing his friends to cut the line. When he noticed that she saw what he was doing, he misled her and told her that she would be next. He did that four times. The manager on duty failed to address the situation properly. They need to hire a more competent manager on the weekends."
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,5.0,2/6/2014,"I have to say that the service here is always good, food has always been great every time as well. There are about 20min. waits on the weekends, but that's to expect at a busy mall restaurant. Cheesecakes are always delish as well. Happy hour food and drinks are the best. Huge (regular) sized portions for half price. Some areas of the restaurant have tables seated SO close, so that would be my only negative. But they have been cool with switching to a booth last minute every time."
Lisa C.,"San Gabriel, CA",284,529,568,1.0,7/23/2013,"Came here to celebrate a birthday (usually you won't find me stepping into a Cheesecake Factory on my own).  Service: Guy was nice however cannot be found. We were done with our meal and we sat waiting for the guy to appear. Food: I got the Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. DO NOT get this. This dish literally had no marinara in it. And the pasta had been sitting in that bowl for awhile now. When I took my fork to it, the entire pasta came up in one piece.. It was so dried! And even after the waiter got me a bowl of marinara, the pasta was barely passable.. Don't be fooled by the long wait. Mediocre/subpar food is all that is in store for you!"
Li-ling C.,"Duarte, CA",1,10,,4.0,11/12/2015,"I went to this restaurant many times. The clerks were very nice. One time I went there, I had to do a survey for clerk for my homework. The clerks finished my survey happily and answered all the questions patiently. The food here is so delicious. I love this restaurant!!!"
Jenny G.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/7/2016,OMG I love this place so much. I would always come once every year. The atmosphere was marvelous and the waitress were very nice and helpful. They will do anything for you to enjoy your time and of course come again. The food was great. It tasted amazing and I have never tasted anything like there dish. It like they put a secret potion to make it taste amazing. And we can't forget about there cakes. I order there strawberry cheesecake and omg it taste amazing. The first bite will take you to a nice marvelous place where your on a fluffy clouds. The second bite with the strawberrys Will make you dream of strawberry gardens on your fluffy clouds. I totally recommend this place for people who r reading this. It will make your taste bud be satisfied.
