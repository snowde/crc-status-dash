Art A.,"Burbank, CA",1,22,2,1.0,3/23/2017,"We walked in at 8:45 and went to the hostess to give our name. There were only two people waiting and the Filipino hostess told us the wait was 15 min and that there is only one server in the whole restaurant. After giving our name my friend and I walked away and thought about it and decided to ask if the service wasn't going to be 100% since there is only 1 server. As I went to go ask there was the Filipino hostess I spoke to, a white male who looked like the manager and an another white semi chubby  man standing by her. I politely asked if the service was going to be good since I knew there was only one server and she said no and I said the way you told me was that there was one server in the whole restaurant. She said no you understood me incorrectly. She was very rude and to top it off, I walked away and my friend I was with looked back and saw them all laughing and the Filipino girl hid behind the counter from laughing too hard. If that was the manager next to her then what a shameful place. A manager not correctly handling the situation when an employee of his is laughing at a customer. Terrible place and rude employees would never go here again!"
Mike S.,"Duarte, CA",27,9,1,3.0,8/2/2015,So we're  told 15 minute wait which is acceptable. Waiting comfortably and sitting since it is better medically to sit. Pager goes off and I expect to be seated within a reasonable time. However we now have to stand and wait another 14 minutes. Over promise under deliver right from the start. Sadly no one makes eye contact or acknowledges you to say just a couple of minutes or something.  You wait the wait and the bread is warm not hot. If it wasn't for the Erica D  I wouldn't give this place another try. Pasadena restaurant blows this place out of the water. Your server  Erica D. saved a customer. OR YOU WOULD OF GOT NO STARS.
Ashley T.,"Monrovia, CA",50,20,2,4.0,11/2/2015,I've eaten at this location a good amount of times and the service here is always amazing!!! Reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I ordered the chicken Alfredo about 4 times and out of that four two of my servings were undercooked!! I mean these noodles were so hard I didn't even want to eat it anymore... The first time it happened to me I complained about it and they got me a brand new plate and were very kind and genuine about it. The second time I just didn't want to bother waiting for a new plate and just dealt with it. I think they should really check up with the chefs and figure it out. The fried macaroni and cheese is REALLY good but very filling. Although when I got it today it was kind of cold inside... I had a very unappetizing dinner. Hope the next time I come it doesn't happen again...
Maggie A.,"Glendale, CA",3,47,3,2.0,2/15/2016,"Where do I start, asked to be seated outside, get seated in a very cramped space. No room to move my chair back or forward. Asked to be relocated inside, got seated cool. Took forever for the waitress to take our order, cool.  My friends order came in 5 minutes, mine took 25 minutes, cool.  We wanted the check, took 25 minutes to flag down out waitress, cool. My pineapple mojito....no alcohol present. To pick up the check...2 minutes."
Bruce M.,"Fresno, CA",92,359,719,4.0,1/26/2015,"Had a good pepperoni pizza and a mango crush drink...and I was seated outside, loved it."
Beverly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,24,63,4.0,10/28/2013,"Variety. Variety. Variety! I love their outdoor seating, its perfect for a saturaday or sunday lunch. I ordered the miso salmon, it was good! Please order the AVOCADO eggrolls! Im not a fan of avocada in general... but their avocado eggrolls is worth every bite! Their ribeye steak was mehhh... nothing special. I can taste the quality of the meat but the seasoning just average. The garlic pasta was actually pretty good. I love their cheesecake! There is so much to choose from. Overall cheesecake factory always have that nice ambience feeling and there is so many different kind of food to choose from. Its definitly good for a big party. Also the bread and butter is to die for!"
Kevin C.,"Arcadia, CA",1,6,10,4.0,5/23/2015,Their wheat bread always up to par. I got a steak Diane medium rare. Never disappointed. Service is excellent.
Rajii M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,2.0,4/1/2016,"Talk about worse of the worse after eating here it ruined my whole day! Had lunch here the other day and ordered a Cuban sandwich the bread was so hard I had to rip most of it off. I complained to the waiter and then the manager came over also, all they did was apologize and offer to make me another sandwich. Really u want me to wait here and have another crappy sandwich and and risk u probably doing something to my food? Uhh no thanks but what really ticked me off was I was charged still full price no discount or anything else on the bill. Never coming here again."
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,4.0,4/1/2011,"Yes, we did we did we did!!  We did stop at the Cheesecake Factory after a full steak lunch at Front Runner at Santa Anita, and a bout of shoe shopping.  A girl has to keep her carbs in control.... by having more of them. This Cheesecake Factory is SOOOOO overdone, Las Vegas style, but the servers and hostess are sooo friendly and the desserts are soooo delicious. Lucy Y. and I were only going to have a taste of something, but while Lucy was in the bathroom I ordered a third dessert just to taste. So we had red velvet cake cheesecake, pineapple upside down cheesecake and a hot fudge sundae.  Are you saying ""sugar coma"" ?  Yes, indeed, that's how we felt afterwards, even though we only ate a little of each.  I am not a red velvet cake fan but the cheesecake was just deee-licious.  Layers of red velvet cake AND cheesecake.  OMG.   The pineapple upside down cake was the best of all three desserts.  Have always been a fan of regular pineapple upside down cake, and this one was a double treat.  Chewy juicy pineapple upside down cake with a thick layer of cheesecake and a graham cracker crust.  Oh my, just the best. And how can you ruin a hot fudge sundae?  Well, I guess if you're Baskin Robbins 31 flavors you can ruin it by cutting down on the amount of chocolate you put in the fudge.  If you're the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia, you make your own hot fudge!!!  It tasted like See's Candy melted.  I asked for a second little boatful but then we couldn't finish it all for fear of upchucking in a public place. Their decaf iced coffee was FABULOUS!  Trying to cut down on caffeine and sometimes that means cutting down on flavor, but this was super!! So we went to the track, shopped for shoes, and then finished with a sugar feast.  On the ride home, Lucy looked groggy and I was giddy.  Why, I may not have to eat until tomorrow morning.... What a fun filled day!!"

Connie V.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",484,277,257,5.0,12/17/2013,"This place was the go-to place for birthday dinners when I was in high school. It satisfies everyone's food cravings and the lighting makes the environment very intimate. I absolutely love their breads. The sweet brown whole wheat  bread is my absolute favorite. It's not too hard and crispy so it feels great against your palate, unlike the sourdough one they give you. I always end up asking for at least two more baskets of the brown bread.  Whenever I go here, I usually order the same thing, which is the Spicy Chicken Chipote Pasta. If you like creamy sauces with a kick of spiciness, this dish is for you! It goes extremely well with the parmasean that they grate in front of you. If you are in the mood for something to drink besides water, the strawberry lemonade tastes great too!  Cheesecake factory will always be a favorite restaurant of mine. The location of this place makes it even better."
Raymond L.,Hong Kong,34,172,1251,4.0,12/25/2014,"Of all the cheese cake factory that I have been too, this is definitely one of the better ones. Overall taste of food is very good and depending on individual waitstaff, the service can be good or par."
J M.,"San Dimas, CA",48,108,195,2.0,3/29/2015,"tjia experience is starting off as 1 star. So far service has been very unorganized and horrible. We waited to be called for 30 mins as told when we went to inquire how much longer the wait the lady I uploaded photo of stated they were calling my name but never did especially since been present waiting in front of the door. They ended seating is outside on a cold day and we requested to have the heaters turned on as well as the party in the table next to us and it took the manager 34 mins exactly to finally have someone come and turn them on, not to mention had to walk out and ask a 2nd time b4 they could do so. Overall service is mediocre definitely not what I expected from this place supposed to been here before very disappointing experience hopefully when is a good follow-up and create a better experience in future"
Richard P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",102,18,13,5.0,2/22/2015,"Great location, fantastic food, amazing service. I wish all restaurants could have an Edna and Natalie."
Jonathan D.,"Arcadia, CA",1,67,47,4.0,3/18/2015,This Cheesecake Factory has pretty ambiance.  The food was great! Boom goes the dynamite!
Christine H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",71,126,256,4.0,1/3/2014,"Been here a couple of times but never wrote a review. The first time I tried Cheesecake Factory was three years ago and I got a shrimp bistro pasta, it was sooo delicious! Two days later found out I devoured 2,000 calories in one setting. HOLY MOLY! Never getting it again The last time I was here it was national cheesecake day for every customer a cheesecake is half off! My man and I got a dulce de leche and a white truffle raspberry cheesecake. Both were tooooo sweet so gonna try another flavor next time.  I've also tried tiramisu cheesecake and by far it is my favorite. Service is generally good but it does do down hill in the night because of more and more people with bigger groups. I'd come back again for their healthier options."
Kim B.,"Temple City, CA",15,86,,3.0,7/24/2014,"We had received a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory so we decided to check it out last Friday. We had never been to this location before. As we entered we were greeted and seated right away. I liked the decor here and it's very open and spacious inside. There is also a patio for those who would prefer to eat outdoors. Our server was very nice, she even came back to our table after she was off work to check to see how we liked our food. As has been previously mentioned in other reviews, the menu here is enormous! We finally decided on the Everything Pizza , the mushroom burger, and the Cuban sandwich. All of the entrees came with a salad. The salad that came with the pizza was huge! Needless to say we ended up taking most of it boxed home with us. And of course, we did order cheesecake for dessert but had to get it to go, as our tummies were too full by the time dessert came around."
Jody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",487,267,1638,4.0,10/22/2013,"I really like Cheesecake Factory food. If not for the crazy crowd and long wait, I'd probably dine here more often. I like coming during the weekdays instead for lunch because it's less busy. On the weekends, it's impossible to get a table without waiting 30 min+. My favorites here are the chicken chipotle pasta, pork chop, jambalaya, and cobb salad.. I guess that's ALOT of favorites. That's because most of the items on the menu are actually quite decent. My favorite cheesecake is discontinued... BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL OREO CHEESECAKE. I DON'T LIKE THE NEW VERSION!"
Angela C.,"San Gabriel, CA",536,100,206,4.0,12/16/2013,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory for family dinners, catching up with friends, dates and also holding annual cheesecake (semi)formal dinners with my loves but I never get tired of coming to this chain. This place has great food and good service. The servers tend to you and makes sure you're enjoying your brunch, lunch and dinner. Recently, I came here with my girlfriend to catch up and updating me on her wedding plans for a nice day out for brunch. When we walk in, we were immediately welcomed and were seated in less than 5 minutes with outdoor seating due to the nice warm weather on December. My girlfriend, Brittany, ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries with coffee and I ordered an eggs benedict with Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce and hash browns with a glass of mimosa. Awesome brunch with my best friend.  Only thing I'll take away from this was that my girlfriend didn't much like her pancakes cause it wasn't lemony enough and knowing Sundays are family days, parking will be bad whether you self parked or chose to do valet, it's horrible parking no matter what. Other than that, great place to eat some delicious food. Everything on their menu is good, especially their baked salmon and spinach. One last thing, their complimentary breads are so yummy! :)"
