Eli S.,"Monterey Park, CA",49,100,127,5.0,10/29/2014,"Best service that I've had in a long time, the food was very good and the waiter I had was very attentive to our needs.  So much that I even asked to speak to the manager so I could express my gratitude. We also took a cheesecake home with us and I will certainly return. Needless to say, we tipped around 28% of the meal cost, my theory is that my server has earned 20% even before I sit down, they can lose that or gain more as we go. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for the experience!"
Alma D.,"Pomona, CA",33,4,,1.0,3/2/2016,I can't believe that I went to purchase a slice of cheesecake to go and the server charged me and then proceeded to handle my slice with no gloves!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is disgusting. Even Subway has disposable gloves. That should be mandatory. I will never go back there again unless this policy changes. I had to put one star to post my review.
O W.,"Corona, CA",27,176,34,3.0,12/2/2014,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory on a rainy Tuesday with my mom.  The hostess at the front was helpful and friendly. A waitress started to lead us to our table, but then, for some reason, she ended up walking away without giving us a table... So I turned to one of the waiters and asked about our seating, and he gave me a mean look and said ""-__- go to the front."" I was a little bit surprised, because usually Cheesecake Factory servers are really friendly, but we all have bad days... So my mom and I, both of us a little bit pissed off, went back to the front to again ask for a seat. We were instantly given a table by another friendly host and our waiter was Cody. Cody was friendly, helpful and attentive. He frequently came back to check up on us.  Good portion sizes, but the food was a little bland. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like something out of a can, or maybe my taste buds have just been spoiled by Di Pillas (so good!! if you're in the SGV area I highly recommend Di Pillas)  Waiters and waitresses are friendly but it's hard to get their attention sometimes because they're so rushed.  The food here is a bit pricey, but it's Cheesecake Factory so there's no surprise about that!"
Susan X.,"Claremont, CA",5,367,152,3.0,3/21/2015,Original cheesecake-good. Smooth texture and gentle taste.  Red velvet cheesecake-perhaps shouldn't have ordered two cheesecakes in a row. This doesn't taste as good probably because I'm getting very full after the first one.
Brandon O.,"Glendora, CA",8,18,7,5.0,2/1/2016,"Use to be a regular then moved farther away to this location but this location is pretty sweet.  For a mall location it's good, only draw back is the no reservation policy but it's understandable, the servers are always attentive, they do a pretty good job of making myself feel welcomed.  The food is always cooked the same which is great because I hate places where I have to worry who's in the back cooking. . .(we've all been there) there pastas are to die for you get a pretty good size portion for a reasonable price and let's not forgot about the bread you get to munch on .  My favorite appetizer is the spinach artichoke dip, which they serve its pretty good but not the best but still delicious."
Brenda C.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,47,45,2.0,10/7/2015,"I have been here quite a few times to know the service variations. I say variations because I've deduced that the larger the table The more attention given. With a table of 4 or more, the service is attentive. However three times have I experienced waiting for my food for an average of 40 minutes. Once we waited for a whole hour until the bartender called the manager to wait on us (table for 2). The last time I was here (was a Tuesday evening)  I waited for more than 30 minutes. We decided to leave so we went to pay for the coffee and appetizer and was told that the food was ready but wasn't served for some reason. The manager was apologetic and seemed genuinely concerned but due to this pattern of aloof service we decided to leave. Drinks are alright, nothing fancy. Usually long wait on the weekends. If you can go somewhere else, do so."
Linda L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,30,7,3.0,4/5/2015,"My experience for this particular visit is a 3. What pissed me off was I ordered a Salmon and Shrimp combo and I got a snack. The serving is Half Size of regular. 3 short pieces of asparagus, 3 Medium battered shrimp, a piece if Salmon the size of half the size of my iphone and mashed potatoes the size of the salmon. Cost $20. I feel pretty ripped off. Didn't complain though, kept my class and composure but here's the yelp. Oh place is pretty dead for a Sunday, perhaps this is a sign of what happens to all the restaurants around here! Oh I don't like how you order pasta and automatically ad the $6.95 for chicken and throw it at you! At least ask me what my options are instead of hiding fine print! WTH!"
Christina G.,"Arcadia, CA",611,485,1795,3.0,7/31/2014,"Eatin at Cheesecake Factory used to be the ""in"" thing to do in high school. But now that me and my friends are all older now, Cheesecake Factory isn't all that great anymore. I don't know if it's because the quality of their food went down, or we were just naive dumb kids back then who used to get dropped off at the mall lol I just went with my girlfriends and their service isn't that good, their food is whatever's and the line was just not worth it ! It was national cheesecake day tho so that's why it was prolly super packed. Just come for the cheesecake, don't even bother getting a food dish! It's overpriced (way overpriced for what they give you), the service and food is slow and I've eaten better American food that this place ! the pasta dish that I always get is pasta da Vinci! Just get that one when you come and it should kinda satisfy you!"
Rebecca m.,"Rosemead, CA",84,20,12,2.0,7/11/2015,I love this place but tonight was a fail . took a long time for pretty much everything. I also had to remind them I had a b day.  No good :(((
Grace F.,"Glendora, CA",36,53,588,3.0,11/21/2014,I had the grilled salmon lunch special. It was great. The salmon was juicy.  The broccoli was crunchy and not too salty. I didn't feel too full despite eating all that mash potatoes.  I usually like to enjoy warm fresh bread but this location gave us cold bread twice.  =(
Ed P.,"Arcadia, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/20/2015,"I was served a California Cheesesteak Sandwich and half way through my sandwich, I FOUND A SCREW IN MY SANDWICH!!! That's right a friggin' screw!! I immediately called it to the manager's attention and he asked what he could do to make it right...after finding a screw in your meal, one tends to lose their appetite. I told the manager he needs to immediately figure out how a screw got in my food... Wish the manager would have been more proactive in making sure we left feeling somewhat good about the experience....unfortunately, they may have lost a customer and I'm sure this review is not something they'd like to see on Yelp!!"
Cherry T.,"Long Beach, CA",20,10,3,4.0,1/24/2015,"The first time I came to cheescake factory, I ordered the Tomato Basil Pasta. It had chicken but there was too much garlic in there for me. I even had a garlic after-breath -.- The next time I came here, I ordered the Fettucini Alfredo. SUPER DELCIOUS. Nice creamy and cheesy meal. Pasta was just right. Afterwards, I ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. I LOVED IT. but i got a sugar rush halfway through the slice so I brought it home and put it in the freezer. It tastes like ice cream after taken out of the fridge! :) My brother got the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheescake and that was delish too."
Jassy G.,"Pasadena, CA",3,75,13,1.0,1/29/2016,By far the worst experience I've ever had. We came to celebrate my aunts birthday and could've Easily went to get a hot dog on a stick. Yvette the waitress was the bomb however the rest of the stuff were extremely rude. They were so helpful to everyone else around us we got here at 7 didn't get seated till about 9:20 didn't eat till 10:10 just gross. They helped everyone I mean everyone around us and didn't even budge to help us. Just extremely rude people here aren't helpful my little brother was last to get his food and my aunt found a hair in her food. Don't ever come eat here avoid coming if you aren't a certain race they don't care about you. Jebron Lebron what ever your name is you suck. You make this place a living hell and for you to be some manager you don't deserve that title at all.
Nazik M.,"San Gabriel, CA",5,5,8,5.0,2/27/2016,"Today is my daughter birthday and we called in the morning to make reservation but they told us only walk in and about an hour wait . We been here since 5:45 pm and the front desk hostess said two hours wait . It's 7:40 now and we front desk hostess still saying 45 min more . Today is our mom birthday she turns 73 year old , disabled lady and been sitting outside since 5:45 to be seated . The hostess jabran is the rudest hostess I ever encountered in my 20 years experience as a restaurant food and beverage manager for castaway restaurant . This guy needs to be fired . No sympathy no passion and don't give a shit the way he talked to us . Only reason we are here because my 19 year old wanted to have dinner at cheesecake . It was a very terrible experience . Definitely not recommending this place nor will go their again ."
3358AD L.,"Irvine, CA",6,38,37,5.0,1/2/2016,The chef there was very nice. They served us the cajun jambalaya pasta late so they offered to pay it out of their pocket. I am always very satisfied with the taste and the size of the dishes every time I dine in the Cheesecake Factory. We also ordered a peanut butter cheesecake but we were too full to finish it.
Christine C.,"Bellevue, WA",198,260,536,1.0,7/28/2015,"In preparation for our large 12 person party, I called the day before to make reservations.  They do not take them.  Ok, so I ask the hostess at the time if Sundays were particularly busy for lunch bc that's when we would come.  She told me to have my party come by noon to ensure the shortest wait time as our desired 1:30pm slot would be way too late for such a large party.  Ok, no problem. Sunday rolls around and we all get there by noon and our name is placed.  The wait was quoted at 1 hour 15 minutes!!  I knew we were gonna wait and that the tip to come early really depends on the day of situation... but wow that was super long! In the end, we waited a whopping 1 hour 45 minutes!!!  We had several young kids and they were not happy (and when they are not happy, they are not sitting still!!).  We asked for bread for them, which the least they could do.  Finally, we get seated and the server was great a little slow but we were a big party.  Food still took an hour to get out to us though!  Must've been slow and lazy Sunday for everyone working bc things were def lagging!  We got an array of foods ranging in the menu from brunch, lunch specials, regular entrees, burgers, and breakfast items.  Nothing really stood out as far as taste and flavor, but maybe we just waited too long for food that we just did not care anymore. I got the Renee's special and the soup du jour was Chicken Artichoke.... there were NO other choices!  So, I was stuck with that... UGH  had I known that, I probably would've chosen another dish but after waiting 2 hours to be seated then to order, I just wanted to EAT! Overall, the food was just ok, not as good as I remembered it to be during dinner hours.  They were crazy busy so could be the reason why.  Service was good, not the best but not the worst either.  For a large restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, I would want to see them accommodate larger parties easier.  There were a few large parties that I saw waiting after us and a couple of parties seated before us.  They get large parties, they just don't know how to handle it.  The hostess was the worst bc she was quite unprofessional.  When I inquired after waiting 45 mins for a table, she said she would get the manager to help us but she never did.  Then, she tells my brother that our WHOLE party had to wait in that little waiting area in order for us to wait for our  table! WTF?  First, we have small kids who can't sit still then we also have elderly ppl who can't stand for 2 friggin hours (We sat at the food court at the mall.... ten steps away and she told us we COULD NOT!!).  Well, instead of getting a cell # to call us when our table was ready, they should have given us a restaurant pager like what everyone else got.... Oh, it was my sister's birthday and I thought they could have at least given her a free slice of cake for all the ish we had to go through with them.... she still got fudge and whipped cream... oh well..  This place is a JOKE for large parties, take your celebration elsewhere! Not worth a 2 hour seating wait and a 1 hour wait on food after ordering!"
Melody Y.,"Temple City, CA",124,174,67,3.0,6/27/2014,"There's probably not much to say about Cheesecake Factory that someone doesn't already know, but this one has been consistent at least and every visit has been satisfactory at least. Free bread is always nice, and the waiters are always nice enough to bring more if I run out (yay take home free bread, the wheat bread is better btw) They recently redid their burger menus (now ""glamburgers"") and the mushroom and swiss burger is pretty tasty. Honestly when I come I usually get a burger because it is cheaper and tastes good, simple as that. Other good choices are the chicken bellagio, chicken marsala, and garlic noodles. Usually leave with a good portion of leftovers so that's always a plus. Also, if you are ever planning on coming here and watching your weight, get the low carb cheesecake! Its tastes like the real thing and sort of healthy. Sort of, hahaha! :D"
Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,774,55,4.0,9/15/2012,"Happy Hour! Mon - Fri: 4-6pm @ the bar area I love Cheesecake Factory's Happy Hour! They have plenty of delicious appetizer-y food choices in prices ranging from $5-$7. You can literally fill up for $10!  My favorite has always been the avocado eggrolls ($5 for 6 pieces - what a steal!) & I also tried their Mushroom flatbread pizza ($5.95). Even at the bar, you are served their complimentary bread & can order off the main menu if you like. Other offerings off their HH menu include: sliders, salads, flatbreads, and all sorts of other goodies from their main appetizer menus at a discounted price. They also offer $5 cocktails & wine/draft beer as well.  During non happy hour (when I'm grabbing a bite with friends), my default order is the Pasta Da Vinci. The type of sauce & the portion size is amazing & consistent at all Cheesecake Factory. For a sugar overload, a slice of Red Velvet cheesecake always hit the spot."
Kendra M.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/1/2016,"This place was okay food was good, but it got hella worse when some waiter. DAVID LOPEZ. Kept bugging me & hitting on me. He only approached me while my partner was in the restroom. A total coward when confronted by my boyfriend. I came here to eat, not have a awful time. He didn't even explain himself he just kept lying when he was called out. What a little bitch smh. Managers or bosses couldn't even issue a real apology."
Aaron T.,"Pasadena, CA",850,315,383,4.0,9/21/2014,Nice and convenient location. Very busy on a Friday night but we had no problem getting seated in less than 10 minutes. Friendly hostess and servers. This place is buzzing with activity and makes use of the corner space of the building in a very efficient way.  Romantically lit but the music is kind of loud and with all the crashing dishes and peeps talking. Not a good place for quiet conversation or a large group event. Food/drink/cheesecake choices are PLENTY and the menu (book) provides something for everyone. Prices are fair and service quick and friendly.
