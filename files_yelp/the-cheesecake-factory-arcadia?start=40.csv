Kathy L.,"El Monte, CA",1,53,63,3.0,7/21/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the Santa Anita mall. I came here on Thursday for lunch around 2:30. We did have to wait because it was pretty busy, but it was no more than 10 minutes.  FOOD: I've eaten here a couple times, but this time the food just didn't taste great. I ordered from the lunch specials and got the meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and corn mixed with vegetables. The meatloaf just didn't cut it for me. I probably enjoyed the corn the most. The portion was very generous though, I expected it to be a lot less than what I was served.  Besides the meatloaf, we ordered two appetizers - tater tots and the fried macaroni. I liked the tater tots, which was filled with bacon, cheese, and green onion. It came with sour cream and sriracha mayo, but I only dipped it with the sriracha mayo since I do not like sour cream. The fried Mac n'cheese wasn't too bad either, I just wished they added a bit more macaroni inside.  SERVICE: service could be better. I don't know if it was because we looked like a bunch of kids or if it's because they put us in a corner, but they could have been more attentive. They probably came to our table only twice besides bringing us our food. We also had to ask our waitress a couple times before we got what we asked for. At the end, she came with the bill and I gave it to her when I was ready, yet when she came back with the receipt, she handed it to my cousin instead. I was kind of taken aback because and confused why she handed it to my cousin instead of me. I'm not trying to make that a big deal because it's not, but was it because I looked to young that you didn't give it to me instead ? Doesn't matter though, but please be more attentive to your customers.  PRICE: I think it is pricey, but its price is comparable to places like BJ's or TGIF.  PARKING: since this is located at a mall, it can be pretty hard to find parking on the weekends, but there is an option if valet service. If you come on a weekday, there should be no problem finding a spot though."
Kelsey C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,49,1,3.0,9/14/2017,"Well...it's just like any Cheesecake Factory. Not amazing but not bad. We came in around 9:30p so it wasn't busy. But, it still took 7-10 minutes to get a seat. Food arrived in a decent time, service was average, food was typical Cheesecake Factory. My friend and I just wanted a place to chat and eat so this was a good place that was open and had hot entrees.  I love their bread, especially the darker wheat one. It's sweet and chewy, and I could just eat only that. If only I could have gotten a whole bag of just that! But, I got the chicken enchilada (meh, it was a tad bit too salty and small for its price) and my friend got the pasta da Vinci. We mixed the two together and the flavors worked well together."
Darlene M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,4,3.0,12/14/2017,So I came here on a recommendation and I wish I would not have listened. First off the place was almost empty so there was no excuse for the poor service and terrible food. The bread the put on our table was hard. They sat us where the sun hit us directly in the face. Instead of giving us a new table the pulled the table to the side next to a loud company Christmas party.  We ordered... Never got our refill of drinks I keep asking for. Never received my salad until after I got my main course (which was cold) and my salad was on a hot plate.   Terrible experience will never go again.
Jennifer V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,32,5.0,8/9/2017,Really great Cheesecake Factory. One of the best I've been to. Really wonderful location and nice set up inside. Nice space for happy hour too. Great customer service.  Part of huge Westfield Santa Anita mall.  Parking is great at this Cheesecake Factory location. Free parking too but they also offer valet parking (although finding good parking is a challenge on the weekends)
Ken N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,58,78,4.0,10/22/2017,Food was good the host was horrible. Came in for Sunday brunch with friends. The lemon herb roasted chicken was Perfect.
Celeste S.,"Montebello, CA",1,8,2,2.0,12/16/2017,I was really excited to come here for my birthday and then we wait over half an hour to get seated. We finally get seated and they take forever to get our drinks and order and we wait AN HOUR for our food. We get our food I ordered the burger well done and it's red inside then my boneless wings weren't boneless ! What the heck I waited an hour for disappointment and on my birthday.
Glendale C.,"Glendale, CA",0,12,3,2.0,5/6/2017,"I payed $20+ for this, even though surprisingly it kinda filled me up, I expected more food for the price. Also the shrimp had the not edible tail on it, as in...I made a mess taking it off, it was slippery with the oils. Food taste (of this particular plate) : 3.7 Drink taste: 0 ( it was pure syrup) I was not impressed guys, the desserts and pastries looked good so I might go try that and hope I have a better experience.  Oh, also the plate and utensils looked dirty, the plate had dark spots as seen on the pic."
Steve S.,"San Gabriel, CA",311,177,409,3.0,9/18/2016,"Ok so this review is going to be honest on our experience as of what we saw, experienced, tasted. I hope there's no character limit as to how much I can write. In all honesty my family and I love Cheesecake Factory but on our visit this latest time we were with friends that just came in to town and I was really disappointed with quite a few things since we love how this place was consistently in the past.  First thing I noticed when we were lead to our table for lunch was the cleanliness of the table and the dishes and silverware. It was like the night crew just used a dirty rag to clean because there was crumbs all over and sticky table. The bread dishes had food stuck on 6 out of 7 dishes, that is bad. I understand 1 or perhaps 2 but 6?! Really was the dish washing machine broken or the dinner crew that slammed the night before that they stacked plates thinking it was clean? The silverware was much better just a few forks were crusted and sticky. I didn't notice what letter grade they received but hopefully not a C.  Now on to the food and drinks which were all very good, with the exception that when a child orders a simple butter Parmesan bow tie pasta you figure it's hard to mess that up, but yep the pasta station messed up in the back, there was a few  green onions that got in and a smudge of marinara sauce that dripped in and got served. Um this would be bad if someone has food allergies with either the ingredients of marinara or green onions, luckily my kid doesn't, but doesn't like either of the accidentally included bonus ingredients. We ended sending it back because what was included was enough to change the flavor of the dish that my child wouldn't eat it. You figure it would be quick to get a fresh one out, um no we were almost all done before it got out to her. Wow that's really amazing.  When we were looking for our waitress the few times we needed help, no where to be found. Waited quite a bit of time. I understand we came at that start of the weekend lunch rush but it's really bad to be not available to your guests, I figure it maybe the decision poor grouping of who takes care of which stations because I didn't see out wait staff really attending anyone else around us. She was pleasant and nice but if she was tasked to help our line table and other tables else where of course I wouldn't assume she's be close to us, she would be all over the place. That is poor management of table groupings for the poor server. The adult drinks were done really well, we had a few between us and our friends and they were all mixed quite solid. The food over all was very good. The other thing I was concerned about was the amount of salt that was used in the French onion soup, wow I used my sandwich to help cut the salt and it balance out better but I just left that ocean in its bowl. I think it was saltier than the Saltons Sea down in imperial county, it was so salty. The salad was good, fresh and tasty. I had the chicken salad sandwich combo with salad and soup.   Over all experience was not what I expected from an older seasoned establishment as this. I hope it was just a one time deal. I will be back again to see if things changed. New edit...9-18-2016 So The mother ship aka corporate reached out and asked me to address my concerns to their corporate site.  will do over and out so I bring back 1 star but I need to send in yet another written letter of addressing my experience? Ok that's a bit much if they can't read my review here and figure something is up. Not being a brat or a complainer but just stating facts of what I experienced and hope the branch fixes it. Last couple times I've been there have been eh just ok not blow my mind wow the experience was awesome. I guess experience goes out the door when you have too many people waiting for a table and you care less. Latest Edit 9-24-2016 Ok guest services addresses me again, glad they are now taking me seriously and taking it internal. After it takes initial and edited post to get it this far wow. People don't think to take it serious after the first review. Uncleanliness is unacceptable period and if it takes 1 review and 1 edit to get it addressed then there is some breakdown in communication. Is my writing too unclear or verbose, I'm not certain but I'll keep it short next time. For all the people out there deserve clean place settings."
Dani A.,"West Covina, CA",0,17,2,4.0,11/11/2017,"Been wanting to go to the Cheesecake Factory for awhile now and I finally came tonight. Our server Christian was so generous and attentive. he made my bf and I feel welcome and comfortable. I love how he got our leftover food and boxed it for us. Idk if that's what they do there but I really did appreciate that. Food was whatever's, but I would come back only if he was our waiter again and to try the cheese cakes, I was too full to get any! Lol"
Aria T.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,41,123,4.0,7/27/2017,"I don't come here as often anymore, but I used to always come here every year on my birthday in my middle to high school years lol. It was like, the ""fancy"" place my parents would treat me to every once a while.  Moving on, I think CCF has one of the best complimentary bread I've ever had. It loses to Red Lobster but it's still delicious. And very filling so you have to be careful not to eat too much before your actual meal haha.  As for appetizers, I've enjoyed their crab cakes ans fried calamari. The sauce goes super well with the fried calamari.  I pretty much always order a pasta when I come. My favorites are the Four Cheese pasta and the Angel Hair with Shrimp Scampi.  Despite not being much of a salad person (very much a meatatarian, in fact), their caesar chicken salad is pretty delicious.  I haven't had any service issues but it does take a while to get seated and for the food to get to you. Portions are big and filling, but pricey at the same time."
Sherylle A.,"El Monte, CA",12,13,6,5.0,9/14/2017,Service was good here tonight as most times we have came here. Came here for the red velvet cheesecake & thank goodness they had it; last time we came they were sold out. Food was good and on point. Keep it up!
Nivek T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,35,13,1.0,7/23/2017,"We went to Cheesecake Factory Arcadia to have mid lunch and dinner!  We ordered a pasta plate and BBQ chicken salad we are going to share that sound good right what this hot weather around 3.30pm!  I m started to eat my past and about to finish I pick up a piece of white hair out from my mouth!   Disgusting! I called the waitress  and she took my plate and the hair so quick a blink of an eye... She came back with the manager saw our salad on the table and saying it the corn hair,,.. I said no I haven't touch the salad as you can see. He was rude and just took that salad out of the table and saying I will take care the bill!  Left us empty table with out no one says anything..we sat and wait and no one bother to come and say anything  So we walked out and everyone around us seeing and don't know what happen.. Bad service at Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia we regularly go there for dinner!  Tell what you should do?"
Charlene M.,"Duarte, CA",66,1,,2.0,11/25/2017,"Never had an issue with this location before and the food's great, what I don't appreciate is the long wait to get seated. We were promised a 35-45 minutes wait, but waited over an hour to be seated. We had asked twice how much longer we had to wait & they would tell us we were next or they're setting up the table. They had offered to seat us outside right away, but what I don't understand is why that wasn't offered when we had first put our name down. Our waiter, Lee was great, but after speaking to the manager about the ridiculous wait, I will probably never come back."
Wesley M.,"Irvine, CA",217,10,,3.0,6/30/2017,"Cheesecake factory is a clean and easy place to take the family and friends for any large parties. The service is always outstanding and the food is pretty good. The desserts menu has a huge selection and if you aren't feeling cheesecake their baked goods and ice cream are decadent as well. This visit I ordered a chicken madeira and the chicken was a little too fatty for my taste. The mashed potatoes weren't very warm either, but its cheesecake factory."
Rose B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,478,1780,4.0,3/23/2017,"Afternoon lunch with one of my besties. 12pm weekday. We sat down right away. Service good. Ordered Tosada chicken salad, it's a lot of lettuce very lil chicken & black beans, tosada's on the bottom. It was alright. Not terrible not great, just mediocre. $16. Large portion. Could b shareable.  Order the 'pink Lemonade' off the cocktail menu, so so good. Not strong but u feel it a lil after, or maybe bc I had rabbit food, a salad. It had vodka & that's all I remember. Vodka, I'll take a million... Ok just one bc it's lunch time. Cheesecake is always good"
John R.,"La Puente, CA",0,14,14,5.0,9/7/2017,This place is great!! Great service!!! Food is amazing!!! And the cheesecake is delicious!! To bad I couldn't fit any more definitely want to try more flavors!! Will return
Heidi J.,"Azusa, CA",1,62,57,5.0,7/20/2017,This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location! The service is always on point and the entire staff is so friendly. The hostess was very sweet. Sat me down right away. And Cindy was our server.She kept refilling our drinks and asking us if we were okay. We love this spot!
Leshel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,63,35,2.0,7/6/2017,"Whatever happened to the good old customer service at Cheesecake Factory? My family and I been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years now and I have been getting good services except for this one recent visit we had. On July 2 my family and I went to Santa Anita Mall and after shopping my kids said ""Mom, can we have dinner at Cheesecake Factory?"" So I said sure!. We go there and I told the guy table for 4 please and he asked ""Outside or Inside?"" We all decided we wanted to eat outside and he said ok and gave us the buzzer for us to wait and was told 15 minutes wait. So we waited...waited...waited and after 25 mins of waiting our buzzer started buzzing so we gave it to the guy. He took the buzzer from my husband and was told just stay on the side. We waited again bout 5 minutes and finally the girl said ""Let's go this way"". We followed her and she took us to a table which it wasn't outside like we told the guy but we all decided to just take that table because we were all hungry already. Another 5-7 minutes on the table Kalyn took drinks order then she came back with our drinks but without any straws so I asked her if we could have straws and she said ""I'll be back"". She came back with our straws and left right away. So we were waiting and waiting and waited again and hey guess who showed up after minutes of waiting? Yes, Kalyn decided to show up gave us 3 pcs of bread with 4 pcs of butter and took our orders. After she took our orders my daughter asked her if they have some type of wipes or hand sanitizer and she said ""No but we have napkins. Would you like some?"" My daughter said ""Yes, please"". My daughter waited and waited and waited but she never came back. So by this time my head was already pounding from hunger. 25 minutes pass us sitting from our table another family sat by our table. She brought them 4 pcs of bread which they were only 3 but hey that cool by why we only got 3 pcs of bread which there was 4 of us? Anyway, she took their orders. Everyone happened so fast from the table next to us that their food even came first before us. We waited 40 minutes for our food!. So we ate and we ran out of drinks but she didn't come back to us if we needed anything. After we wait we waited and waited and after 10 minutes she showed up and said ""everything ok?"" And my husband was like can we have more soda? And said for here or to go? We said to go cause it might take another 20 minutes. She came back with the soda to go which was only 3/4 she didn't even fill it up. She asked if we want desserts and I said no we will just buy it at the front and she looked at me and gave me a fake smile. So she gave us the check and we gave her 2 Cheesecake Factory gift cards that was given to my kids both $25 each and the rest I told her to put in my debit card. 5 minutes later she came back and told us that one of the card didn't have money and only one went through so I said just use my debit card for the rest so she left. She handed me the gift card that supposedly didn't have any money that she said she ran twice. My husband and I was thinking why wouldn't have the card any money? Anyway, she came back and gave me the receipt that I needed to sign and left. So we got up and decided to get desserts at the front and at the register where I was paying I asked the girl can you try if this gift card would work and she did. After she ran the card and it actually worked and she even said ""You have $7.35 left"" after she charged me with 2 Cheesecakes. So we were all like hmmmm why  did  Kalyn the waitress said there was no money ??? Well, over all we were disappointed that's the bottom line. Customer service needs to get better."
Elizabeth T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,62,49,2.0,7/23/2017,"I am a little disappointed about the Manager today.  I went for Lunch, so I ordered a shrimp scampi pasta. The food is good and I like it, but in the mid way of my dish, a white hair inside the dish that I took out from my mouth. I call the waitress, she took the hair a ways with out saying anything. After 5 minutes, she came with the manager.  He told me that hair that came out from my mouth, was a corn hair.  It doesn't make sense to me, because on my shrimp scampi pasta doesn't have corn at all.  He is trying to make me believe that white hair on the dish comes from corn which the dish has not corn inside!!!!!He expressions was rude. He took the dish out from and didn't say anything.   Left me with a empty table.  Very disappointed!!!!"
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,2.0,6/3/2017,"American food (pizza, pasta, salad, burgers, steak) that's slightly overpriced with lots of calories, but oooh so good for once in a while right? =) I love the Cheesecake factory for the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic with lots of Parmesan cheese on top, one of the best strawberry lemonades ever, that complimentary brown bread with loads of butter, and of course, the cheesecake! My family came here to celebrate my niece's 2nd birthday and it was an exciting time because this is the very first year she can blow out a candle. We were a party of 8 and very happy to celebrate a milestone. Although the food is great, the service needs improvement. Our server was inattentive with an attitude. The part where she was MIA, took 15 minutes to bring out initial drinks, forgot promised condiments, and left us hanging after everyone finished their meal (waited 15 mins before being able to find her to ask for dessert) wasn't the problem. We figured she was busy and gave her the benefit of the doubt. It was the fact that she refused to refill my lemonade because my boyfriend had a few sips. It's considered ""sharing"" so she would need to charge for a new one. Unbelievable...we were all shocked. The previous 2 refills were majority ice so that was why I kept asking for refills, not because someone else had a few sips. I spoke to the manager and immediately after, our server brought a new cup out and said she didn't want to fight the system over the rule and that it was Friday so she didn't want to fight. None of that made any sense nor was it necessary to share. I'm pretty disappointed and will not be back to this location for another celebration to be spoiled."
