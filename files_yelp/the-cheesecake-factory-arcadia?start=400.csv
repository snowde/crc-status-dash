Amy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1358,849,1152,4.0,4/7/2013,"I try avoiding Cheesecake Factory as much as possible cause i'm obsessed with the wheat bread + butter combination here. Carb overload! All the food weighs me down and will take me forever to work off but once in a while, it's nice to indulge here :) Every server I've had here has always been attentive and friendly. Inside of the Santa Anita mall. Often is busy - especially on holidays! No reservations =( LOVE THE HAPPY HOUR!! From 4pm-6pm. GREAT GREAT GREAT portion for many of the food dishes. There is a section of appetizers for only $5!!!! Other selections range up to $7-$8 depending on what you like. I've tried a couple happy hour selections but my favorite stand at the tex-mex eggrolls. Drink specials are a hit as well too. Hard pink lemonade, mojito, well drinks - etc. are $5 and tap beer is $4! The fried mac n cheese was decent. Interesting combo with the marinara they had underneath. One of my favorite happy hour locations. I'll be back .. soon!"

I am addicted to the louisiana pasta, four cheese pasta, garlic farfalle, and the chicken romano. My boyfriend loves the chicken bellagio! Peach Bellini's mmmmmm :) Service is good on some days, okay on others."

Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1998,829,6041,3.0,3/24/2011,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times, and I've always had to wait in order to be seated. It's usually crowded on the weekends, especially during dinner time and if you have a pretty big party, it's wise to make a reservation.  I really like the Miso Salmon. My friends recommended it to me, and it tastes every bit as good as the name. The fish is not only tender, but soft to a point that it basically melts in your mouth. The rice ... is not as comparable. Since I eat rice almost every night, I wished the rice was softer and less grainy. The sauce was really nice and added a nice touch to the fish.  I've also ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club twice, and it's good. Nothing too special, but I have been told that I should order something more ""upscale"" if I'm going to eat here. Which is the reason I ordered the Miso Salmon the next time I came.  I've also tried their Chicken Alfredo which was good and creamy.  As for the cheesecakes, yes they are super delicious but a bit on the expensive side. When they have their deal of ""half off a slice of cheesecake when dining in"" ... that's the only time I would order it.  Overall, it's an okay restaurant. The food is average, but the prices are a bit on the more expensive side. It's a bit too dim for my liking, and sometimes the waiters and waitresses seem to be so tired or too caught up chit-chatting with each other than wanting to help their tables. And if you go with a big group ... just don't. They weren't willing to split the checks or were really annoyed at how long we took to gather up the money. Going with a small group is a lot better and the waiters are usually nicer."
Alethea C.,"Arcadia, CA",687,113,454,3.0,9/15/2014,"Parking can be a pain as it's at the mall esp on major nights.  It's always a hit or mess with this place. Service can be attentive and quick sometimes it can be slow and disappointing.  But on top of that, food quality makes everything up. And their cheesecakes are to die for! :)"
Mimi A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",190,105,82,3.0,3/26/2014,I came for a birthday and the service was great. I wish the food had been better. The avocado eggroll wasn't bad but I prefer BJ's version. The cobb salad was just plain gross. Too much parmesan cheese and I could barely see any lettuce. The over abundance of cheese and bacon bits made my salad way too salty. I talked to my other friends who got pasta dishes and they seemed unimpressed. I have fond memories of cheesecake from my high school days so I'll probably be back one of these days...just not any time soon.
Quily P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,7,1.0,6/25/2015,omg everything was dirty the silverware  the table  the menu the plates  grroosss!!! Slow service to top it off. They  brought new silverware but no new napkins. If you ever go to a restaurant that dims their lights as much as this place did pay close attention to the cleanliness of everything. Horrible.  A few items were comped....changes nothing :/
Calvin C.,"Arcadia, CA",42,214,34,4.0,2/22/2013,"Cheesecake factory! It's the chain everyone really knows about... anyways here are some quick tips: 1. Parking in the mall... plentiful! 2. Monday - Friday, Happy Hours 4-6 PM! Oh god, the $5 appetizers are nuts! I love the calamari and the buffalo blasts. 3. Don't get the nacho's for happy hour, chicken is extra! 4. Lunch specials til 5 PM! 5. Try the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cheesecake.... oh god. 6. I like the factory burrito, but it's pretty expensive for what you get! The portions are pretty big though! For more read on! I used to go to this place for dinner... but by gosh it's REALLY expensive. I still think though that Happy Hour has some great drink/food deals. They have appetizers for $5 and it also happens to cross over to lunch deals too! But regardless, I have some key dishes that my family swears by when we head to Cheesecake: - The factory burrito -- a fat burrito, topped with cheese and chili verde sauce and filled with white rice, onions, corn, tomatoes, and chicken. Also comes with a side of sour cream and guacamole! I would suggest extra chili verde sauce! - The jambalaya -- My mom loves it, though I'm sure most people will agree they have had better! - Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad -- This salad is amazing. It's like a southwest chicken salad to begin with, but you add onion strings and barbecue sauce and ranch! It's so good and the portion is huge! Highly recommend for the deal during lunch hours, only $10! - The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake -- absolutely tremendous cheesecake. SO good. But so expensive........... I remember a few years back when they had a free piece for cheesecake day.... but I digress! There are plenty of nuts in this cheesecake and the white chocolate is sweet, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. Anyways service for my family and my girlfriend have always been good! Though, sometimes it feels very forced."
Peggy C.,"Arcadia, CA",375,94,77,4.0,6/30/2014,"Even though it's a franchise American restaurant, their quality and services are better than you other ordinary franchise restaurant.  The services are great; tho they accidentally sat our table to another party.... I do not know how they screwed that up, but they fixed us a table right after we told them we haven't been seated yet.  Food was delicious! I always get Pasta Da Vinci when i come here; penne pasta stir fried with mushroom and chicken; this dish is a bit sweet because of the onion they have in there, i love it :) Besides that, I have also tried Miso Salmon, Pasta Jambalaya, and their seafood gumble; none of those dishes had disappointed me!  I love coming to Cheesecake Factory!"
Alyssa X.,"Rosemead, CA",452,33,74,3.0,4/3/2014,"Cheesecake factory's food is on the side of mediocre, but their cheesecake is to die for! The environment is good for a romantic dinner for two at the booths. The ambient noise level is a bit high though. The tables are placed too close to each other so it's a bit hard to talk to your group of friends when another party beside you are talking.  Service is whatever's, they're attentive for the first minutes while taking your order, but after your food is out, the servers run off and leave you. My wheat bread that came with my entree was burnt compared to the complementary breads they provided to us with. I tried their garlic pasta with peas, shitake mushrooms, tomatoes, & the  omelettes. Don't try the shitake mushrooms, it made my tummy ache ): their dishes are on the heavy side,  even with their low calorie menu , come eat for lunch, so you're able to walk it  off, or come in for an early dinner, but nothing late or you find yourself regretting your indulgence."
Peter W.,"San Marino, CA",1,11,,4.0,12/29/2015,"I like their service and food. The wait is a long but they will give you a beeper to alert your table is coming. Overall, it is a very good, especially their chicken picata!"
Lalee M.,"Pasadena, CA",272,157,1278,3.0,8/11/2012,"Since cheesecakes were 50% off on National Cheesecake Day, I decide to treat the family for lunch. To start we had the Fried Calamari & Chinese Chicken Salad.  Both perfectly prepared like always. Calamari batter was light & crispy and the salad was well dressed with all the toppings. Chicken Parmesan Sandwich was filling. It had crispy chicken with a delicious marinara to dip in. Wild Mushroom Burger was juicy with lots of grilled onions, however lacked mushrooms. Sliced mushrooms were equivalent to half or one whole mushroom.  Factory Burrito Grande was huge, but had very little chicken. It was mostly white rice. Portion sizes are huge. You'll have plenty to take home.  As for dessert, we got the Oreo Dream Extreme, Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, &  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple to go. All were yummy! Overall, my experience here has been the same as my last few visits.  Ambiance always nice. Service just okay. This time around would have been nice to be greeted upon arrival & acknowledge when leaving. To my surprise restaurant wasn't too busy. Just had to wait less than five minutes to be seated. Cheesecake Factory is your typical chain restaurant that you'll always go back to."
Kristen E.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",390,50,81,4.0,6/18/2015,"came here for a birthday dinner last week and started off with the asian pear martini...absolutely delicious! kudos to the bartender, it wasnt too sweet nor too strong. very enjoyable martini, the best ive had because every other time i have a martini it tastes like pure vodka.  i have ordered the shepherd's pie before and was happy to see it delivered soon after munching on the complimentary warm bread rolls and butter. my date isnt much of an eater so we opted to share the plate; glad we did because it is a very large serving!  all in all a good dinner, the service was good considering we reserved a table for 15 and only 10 showed up and half of the party was late (but not me!). the reason i give a 4 instead of 5 stars is because at the end of the meal they incorrectly split up the bill; not that big of a deal, it happens, we easily fixed it. BUT, they didnt bring back my doggy bag! i had half of the delicious shepherds pie promised to me in a to-go bag! after feeling heart broken, i looked around and spotted a rogue to-go back at one of the registers! so i told one of the employees i was going to check the bag and sure enough it was my missing shepherds pie. glad i found it, but a really bad wrap to the dinner :/"
Kayden H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,116,1229,5.0,9/29/2012,"Really excellent service.  I think it help that the place wasn't pack.  Food for lunch was great.  Reasonably price with big portion.  Very kid friendly.  Had the Everything Pizza and salad for lunch.  Really yummy.  Friend had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  Love coming to the Cheesecake and will be coming back.  Always great food no matter the location.          Need to come back for happy hour because reading the review below, it seems like a great place for drinks and variety of appetizer.  Can't wait to come back to try there happy hour."
Christine T.,"La Verne, CA",335,37,46,1.0,4/29/2015,"So we waited almost 1&1/2 hours for two when the guy at the front desk had specifically told us it would only take 25 minutes. We came back when it hit the 35 minute mark and he told us only 15 more minutes. It seems that this specific location is extremely unorganized and the service is really slow. Standing there waiting, we saw so many people trying to get waiters attention but the waiters look like they were pretending to not notice. People were even raising their hands! We ended up leaving and going somewhere else."
Bruce A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,87,,4.0,4/29/2015,"Went on a Saturday, had to wait 30 minutes but not too bad. Food was plentiful and fast. Drinks were always kept replenished. Our server, I think his name was Marcelo? was very good and attentive even tho it was busy.  A little pricey but overall a good experience."
Yoonjung J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,6,4,1.0,5/10/2016,"I came here to takeout some cakes for me and my family. The lady working behind the counter looked mad and didn't even listen to my order correctly. I had ordered one chocolate cake, one oreo cheesecake and one carrot cake but when I came back home to eat it, i noticed that she gave me the Godiva cake instead of the carrot"
Chelsea L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,73,,4.0,6/17/2016,"I like coming here for dinner with friends after work on the weekdays because weekends it is crazy in there. Valentines day we had to wait for about 1.5 hour, but other times it's not so bad. Food is good I like to order the steak medallions. Small portion for people who do not eat so much or if you are trying to save some room for their delicious cheesecakes. My cousin said the sandwich she had there was the best sandwich she'd ever have in her whole life. I mean idk if that's true but I guess I'll have to take her word for it. They have outside seating which I love! Their service is good, most of their employees are friendly, & it is very clean in there."
Stephen L.,"Port Orange, FL",0,4,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Forgot my wallet, was asked for my id, was rejected a drink. All well and good no problem. Went to the bar, got a drink with out ID. Sat down at my table, 5 min later the manager asked for my id, when I couldn't present it she took my beer from me and didn't refund it. Despicable service. Would rather harass you over semantics than allow you to enjoy a meal.  Will never return."
Wasin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,73,198,2.0,2/22/2012,"Normally I don't waste my time reviewing chain restaurants because you know what you're getting when you come to these sort of places. Generic menus with generic food. I don't even like eating at these sort of places but the other week a couple of friends and I were around the area and didn't know where we could grab a quick bite. We went on our foursquare app and found out this Cheesecake Factory was offering a 20% off $50 discount so why not. Their pastas are decent right? Our dinner took longer than originally planned. It was the weekend so it was packed. We waited 30 minutes before we were seated but that's fine, the hostess told us this when we asked to be put on the waiting list. But seriously, do people not have better places to eat at? I started off with their sour apple martini. I'm a sucker for appletinis. This had to be the worst appletini I've ever had in my life. It tasted decent enough, like their strawberry lemonade. But I ordered a martini. Where was the alcohol in here? I can understand them forgetting the vermouth but where was the vodka to the schnapp? Not to mention it was $12. I normally do not complain about drinks but seriously, a simple cocktail for that much? Especially when it's obviously watered down? And the server had the audacity to ask if I wanted another one. Shakes my head. Moving on to the food. Started off with their avocado eggrolls. That dish is pretty darn good. Much better than their crab cakes. Then we had our entrees. I had the shrimp scampi with their diane steak combination. The shrimp scampi and mashed potatoes were decent enough I suppose. I actually like the scampi without the capellini. However the steak medallions was terrible. What wine sauce do they use to cook it with here? It clashed with the meat terribly. It was like they put an asian oyster sauce in hopes of marinating the beef but it came out as a fail. And the cooks here needs to learn what a medium steak looks like. It seems they have trouble with all types of meat because my friend's meat loaf didn't come out so great too. In summary, we were so dissatisfied we even bother trying one of their cheesecakes for desserts. You can come here if you want. But my experience here this past week reminded me why I wouldn't. There are a lot of other places in the area one can eat at that would have better food and drinks."
