TT H.,"Monrovia, CA",17,630,576,4.0,9/22/2012,"This is just like any other Cheesecake Factory. Food is good, drinks are yummy. I always order the avocado egg rolls. I love that tamarind dip! They are SUPER kid friendly too! I know they are known for their cheesecake, but you gotta try the Lemoncello Cream Torte. That is just so GOOD! Pineapple upside down chessecake is pretty darn good too. Since this is in the mall, parking can be a hassle on the weekends and holiday shopping times."
Rita L.,"Monrovia, CA",188,471,306,4.0,2/1/2016,"This is pretty much our go-to happy hour place. Pretty extensive HH menu with a few good options for cocktails, really can't go wrong. I always order the fresh roasted artichoke because I love artichokes but am too lazy to steam/grill them myself. Plus I feel good choosing the fresh veggie option amongst all the other fried appetizers. With that said though, we recently discovered the fried avocado, portabella and zucchini fries (listed under the small plates section), and those are pretty amazing not gonna lie. All the other options (i.e. sliders, mini chicken sandwiches, etc) are okay if you're looking for more substantial bar food. I had the HH burger once and immediately, I was in bloat city. It's still a huge burger that's a great value, but really detrimental to anyone's (digestive) health. We ordered a mojito once and it was one of the best mojitos I've ever had.. and another time we ordered it again, and it was not so good. It depends on the bartender I guess."
Sweetie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,345,704,5.0,2/13/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, the food is consistently good, the menu is expansive, and the service is impeccable, there is nothing I can complain about except for the long wait when it's gets busy.   I also really love their skinnilicious (spelling is off) menu that gives great lower calorie choices for the calorie counter patron like myself and ice cold drinks that complements their large menu.  I usually order the tuna tataki salad or shrimp soft taco which always comes out delicious and fresh.  Their cheesecake is rich and smooth, and good for sharing.  Overall it's a great option when dining out."
Matthew Zane H.,"Austin, TX",19,82,,4.0,8/21/2015,"Love me some cheesecake factory!  Menu, food wise, I find them all the same.  If you've never been, they have an extensive menu, great for the picky eater.  Wonderful happy hour, but very very busy.  Worth popping in for a slice of cheesecake take-away."
Jenny Z.,"Rosemead, CA",188,41,17,5.0,9/13/2015,"Let me just start off by saying that this Cheesecake Factory is my favorite compared to all the other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants that I've been to. Their wait can be pretty long especially at night and during the weekends. But once you are seated the waiters/waitresses are always very kind and helpful and would always ask if everything is okay and if we need any help or have any questions. I always try something new every time I come here, and let me just say that my favorite thing about the cheesecake factory are their mashed potatoes. Sometimes I would purposely order an entree just because it comes with mashed potatoes. The prices could be a little overpriced but as long as I don't eat here like every week, it's okay to pay a bit more for dinner. Also....STRAWBERRY LEMONADE !"
Shirlene N.,"Alhambra, CA",33,193,167,3.0,12/31/2012,"They took away the Thai chicken pasta from the menu :( I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, the food is almost like PF Chang's. I usually get the thai chicken pasta or the chicken tenders. Nothing else really is appealing.  Wheat bread was warm and fresh. Firecracker salmon was good. The sauce was very good. I don't like cabbage, I usually pick it out if everything but with this sauce I actually ate half the cabbage on this plate! What a way to get me to eat cabbage! Garlic Noodles - eh, not very flavorful, I didn't really taste the garlic either. It was pasta in a very light light plain butter sauce. It tasted like everything was blanched then thrown together in the sauce.  Shepherd's Pie - Did not taste like shepherd's pie. Lacking flavor all around.  All the food presentation looked great, but lacking a lot of flavor. Service was good."
Peter C.,"Alhambra, CA",369,599,1118,3.0,2/2/2010,"Of all the big chains, I think Cheesecake Factory gets the most venom directed toward it, but I'm always a little unsure why.  For a family dining place, the menu is big, the bread is nice (hands off the squaw bread!  that's mine!) and the prices are fair.  Mrs. C and I sat down to a nice lunch, and decisions were made quickly.  Me: pizza + caesar salad lunch.  Her: lunch size pasta da vinci.  Wow was her dish good.  If you had the time to cook down Marsala wine, mushrooms and chicken, you could probably make it this good, but this is a very respectable dish.  The penne pasta even has little ridges to hold the sauce.  My pizza and salad are equally good.  I almost got the BBQ chicken, but I decided to get the everything pizza. I've seen some amazing servers at Cheesecake Factory.  Once I was with a group of 20, and the server didn't write anything down.  Not a thing.  And this person nailed everyone's entree.  Impressive.  Anyway, we sat in Tiffany's section and while we didn't have a large group to test her memory skills, I will say that I was in a position to observe her section fill up as the hostess kept seating tables, and she STILL managed to check on us every 8 or 10 mins.  Grabbed my iced tea without me even having to ask.  ""How's everything tasting so far?""  ""Oh, you need a box?""   Just very polite, attentive service all the way around. I think this may anger some chain haters, but I actually look forward to eating here.  Take a piece of Kahula cocoa almond fudge cheesecake to go.  You only live once!  You may have to spend an extra hour at the workout club, but I'm pretty sure it's worth it."
Jody A.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,10,1,2.0,2/16/2016,"2 stars, because the manager attempted to make things right. we went. There was 5 of us. 3 adults and 2 children. To start, we got seated and when the bread arrived, we went o get our knives and found food still on our silverware. they replaced it. What's bad is all our silverware was dirty. So we order. The children got the mini corn dogs, my friends got fish and chips, and I got the carbonara with chicken. So we waited for the food. The children's meals come out and one of my friends fish and chips. not the other 2 plates. waited over ten minutes and still no plates. Also, my friend that had gotten her plate had got no salad dressing for her salad. she had also asked for lemon and malted vinegar and got none. I asked for the manager and when she came over we explained the situation. She apologized. we got our food within a couple of minutes after that. Still no salad dressing or malted vinegar. On the next pass we asked again for them and finally got them. My friends seemed okay with the food. Mine on the other hand was supposed to be carbonara with chicken over angel hair pasta. Well, I found fettuccine in it first of all. The bacon was burnt and the sauce was like soup. Brought it to the manager's attention again. she said that she would take care of it and apologized again. Well, I guess taking care of it was a free slice of cheesecake and a staff discount on the food. With everything that happened, I think a little more should have been done. I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times before, including this one and never had service this bad. Unfortunately, I will not return to this one."
Leahna S.,"Glendora, CA",3,20,11,2.0,8/22/2015,"Went there tonight just for dessert, cheesecake was great but our server was not her name was Cynthia she was very rude took forever just to get our order for only cheesecake. We waited about 20 minutes just to get a box to take home our cheesecake eventually gave up on her so I had to get up and ask for boxes on my own not even from Cynthia our original waiter and to top it off she comes down with our boxes just drops them on the table and drops the check and leaves. At this point I'm just tired if her attitude I get that it's 40 minutes from closing but there is no need to be rude, we take our check to her and leave and there is no thank you no nothing, at this point I'm just holding my temper in from telling her anything and turn to leave, whoever is the manager of this restaurant please teach your employees better customer service"
Haso S.,"Tujunga, CA",0,38,,4.0,11/15/2015,"So much better than all the other Cheesecake Factories I've been too. The nachos were really good topped with guac, cheese, beans etc. I didn't like the pizza because it was super cheesy, soft, and oily however all my friends loved and devoured it so it could just be me. We got the pienne pasta, the cheese wasn't melted and the pasta was kind of hard. I was confused because the flavor was great but something wasn't right. I also ordered the Cheesecake Factory Housemade Cucumber Lemonade which was delicious! Sour, sweet, and super refreshing. It was very large and worth the price. We went for a birthday so it was nice that we got to celebrate with a free mini sundae lit with a candle even though the Happy Birthday was sung in a rush , lol no hard feelings haha. I love the venue and would go back again :)"
Cori T.,"Duarte, CA",54,22,3,2.0,3/30/2014,"Everyone always raves how good Cheesecake Factory is. My fiancé and I visited this location. It took me forever to decide what I wanted. When I did decide, I got the orange chicken. Aesthetically, it was pleasing to look at. The taste on the other hand was sub par. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but it was bland. It was like eating an orange rind. Bitter. As a side, I ordered the brown rice. So dry & tasteless. Not worth the money.  The only reason I gave it it two stars is because our waitress was polite & knowledgeable.  If I go here again, it won't be by choice."
Todd K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/30/2014,One of my favorite places in the world. It saddens me that the Vietnamese tacos were removed from the menu. The thing I enjoy about the CF is that everyone can find something. PS. My brother believed that they only served cheesecake :)
David R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",388,1297,1356,5.0,4/11/2014,"Yummy, good food and good service. It's been along time since we had dinner here and I'm not sure why that is. We have a location just around the corner from the house and I think it's time to stop in for some more good stuff."
Jacqueline C.,"Arcadia, CA",454,69,171,4.0,11/28/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the few chain restaurants I actually enjoy going to. Their food is USUALLY good and the service is good! I've gotten their factory nachos and the last two times I got it I was a little sad because they use the liquidy cheese instead of just all shredded cheese and it doesn't create the same ooey gooey-ness it used to. They have a HUGE menu and they have some good inexpensive small plates from some delicious fried cheese triangles to a roasted beet salad. Their calamari is also pretty good too...and I rarely ever eat calamari...the breading was delicious and I LOVE their dipping sauce. I usually get a pasta dish when I go there and 95% of time it's always good. The other 5% accounts for the times I've ordered something and it was quite bland. I either the pasta carbonara, five cheese pasta (and add mushrooms), the bistro shrimp pasta (the shrimp is fried so it gets a little greasy), or the crusted chicken romano which is  GIANT plate of panko breaded chicken and pasta. I like to mix in alfredo sauce in the pasta to make a creamy marinara mix and add mushrooms and spinach. It's absolutely delicious. They put so much on there I have enough for two meals. & who can go to The Cheesecake Factory without trying their cheesecake? I haven't tried many of them but a couple of my favorites are the vanilla bean if you like a simple cheesecake or the raspberry/lemon cheesecake...SOOO scrumptious."
Valerie S.,"South Bend, IN",317,139,23,4.0,3/21/2012,This place is always busy so I usually sit at the bar. Had my skinnylicious veggie salad and coffee! The bartender was great and food was wonderful! The ambiance and lighting are always consistent. The bar is a great place for a quick bite.
Denise G.,"Monrovia, CA",6,35,10,4.0,7/11/2014,"Been here a few times with family. Every time we've gone we've been treated very nicely. One of the greatest and nicest waiters there is Chris , even though he had several tables he still managed to serve us on time and wasn't forgetful as others. Chicken parmigiana is great here !  My daughter loves their grilled cheese off the kids menu !"
Floyd C.,"Monterey Park, CA",1572,435,368,4.0,4/27/2014,"How can you not like the Cheesecake Factory?  They have consistently good food, they have almost everything on the menu.  I mean its like a 30 page book of menu items.  Maybe not that large, but  it can be overwhelming at times.   This place is always a safe place to grab a bite to eat and leave satisfied.  Enjoy some pie if you can't find a meal to eat.  Enjoy."
Linda K.,"El Monte, CA",40,16,27,4.0,7/22/2014,"Always here when I'm craving their renee lunch special, I always get the chicken salad sandwhich with loaded potato soup. Yum! And their ahi tuna tower? I think that's what's it's called but it's supper yummy but I need more than four chips  :("
Marina F.,"Duarte, CA",0,32,1,5.0,6/1/2016,"Great happy hour menu from yummy appetizers and delicious drinks!!! Great place to meet up with friends after a long day of shopping.

Steve A.,"San Gabriel, CA",16,15,3,3.0,1/19/2014,"My gf and I have been here a few times for dinner mostly. I'm kind of torn between 3 and 4 stars but I'm going with 3 because I feel this place is a little overpriced.  The pros: The kitchen is always on point with our food. They prepare it just the way you order it. I am a sucker for masked potatoes and they make the best!!!! I mean really the 3 stars I'm giving is all based on the food. The food alone would be 5 stars but we all know that the review is about the entire restaurant.  The cons:  On more than one occasion we have been sat at a table that still had dirty utensils. Once seems reasonable we all make mistakes but more than a couple times let's me know that they don't pay much attention to cleaning up. The drinks selection isn't very good. A lot of wines but my gf and I aren't wine ppl so maybe this is just distasteful for us. The menu seems a tad bit over priced. The look they try to give this place will make you think the price is fair but let's be honest this just another franchise  restaurant.  Overall, the food is good. It's not a must go place but those damn mashed potatoes are too good to pass up. Try it for yourself you might find you like it better than I do."
