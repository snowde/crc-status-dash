Sylvia S.,"Brea, CA",2,23,1,1.0,5/11/2016,"I go to Cheesecake Factory all the time. By far, this Cheesecake Factory had the worst tasting food ever!! After coming off a great win at Santa Anita race track, we decided to try this Cheesecake Factory. Needless to say, bad choice. My daughter's noodles were overcooked and had burnt butter on top. She left her pasta there and went to the bathroom because she got sick. My husband ordered pasta as well. His was dry. My salad tasted old. Wood Ranch is right next door. Should have spent my money there!"
Andre M.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Terrible prices and mediocre quality. The young bar tender had a bit of a bitter attitude, which was fine as she might have had a bad day (early in the afternoon btw) but what ticked me off was that she was extremely stingy with the alcohol, which would be fine if only they didn't charge 15.00 a drink for what felt and tasted like apple juice. The food is not bad but we were there for drinks. I tried to talk to the manager about the drinks and he replied by saying that there is only a specific amount they are required to pour, which I assume is not even an ounce of liqour. For 15 dollars I'd red flag this place. Rip off!!! Not recommended"
Briana V.,"Arcadia, CA",76,39,54,2.0,11/18/2013,"Worst service I have ever received! Went here with a party of 7, they sat us in an empty section and completely forgot about us. We had to get up and hunt down someone to take our drink order. She took our drink order and food order and then, to our surprise, told us she wasn't even our server.... Some guy standing behind her not saying a word was our server. This guy must of had some type of magical power to disappear because it was hard to find him for anything. It took him twenty minutes to get us bread (4 pieces for 7 people). When we finally got all our food, we all were in desperate need of refills on our drinks. It took him ten more minutes to get our drinks refilled.  In conclusion, the service was horrible and we were forced to give a good tip because of gratuity.... When clearly it was a half-assed serving job."
David C.,"El Monte, CA",245,859,1897,5.0,3/30/2012,"Death by chocolate or death by cheesecake? Seriously though, if you try to eat a single portion of cheesecake by yourself you will probably die. The portions here are enormous. Do not try to tackle any dish by yourself. Bring a few friends. I like to split a Thai chicken pasta with my friend. Or chicken and dumplings. Or a pizza. Honestly, I have never ordered something here I didn't like."
Annalyn K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",32,44,25,5.0,11/17/2013,"Well, we had to wait over an hour wait today ( Saturday night ) because the party ahead of us had paid, but were sitting there. They told us 30 minutes, but we waited for over an hour. The Assistant Manager and Senior Manager were both aware of our situation and apologized. Chris, the Senior Manager, took our orders for the four kids even before we were seated to ensure they would be served first. We were seated and were almost immediately greeted by Chris and the Chef who had personally brought out the food for the kids - thank goodness! They were very apologetic for the long wait and allowed us to order a few appetizers on them! I thought it was very kind of them to do so. The food was great, Chris kept on checking up on us to see if we were ok and we had a great dinner despite the super long wait.  Then when we got the bill, we found out that not only did they comp the 2 appetizers as he mentioned, he also comped the 4 kids meals!!! We really didn't expect that and would never ask for it! So we went to say thank you and he again apologized for the long wait. We knew it wasn't his fault at all; sometimes bigger groups take longer to leave which is the only reason why we had to wait so long. But both managers really took care of us and definitely made up for it. They really went out of their way to make sure of it and that is very much appreciated. It's so hard these days to come across great customer service and I'm very pleased with our experience today."
Grace C.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,10,1,4.0,9/20/2015,"Our family comes here for weekend get-togethers. There is a big selection of food so our party never complaint about not getting what they want. Try the re sangria, just the right amount so u can still walk around the mall after. The only thing i would recommend slight improvement is the food presentation. But we would still come back."
Angela T.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,23,5,2.0,8/17/2014,"I came here to eat the other day , the dishes were all over priced and the portions were small , I ordered their  Spaghetti and the flavor was very bland , I wish they added more sauce into the spaghetti  For dessert , I ordered their white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and it was way too sweet , it tasted like the cheesecake was in their fridge for days so it wasn't fresh  Overall , this place isn't as great as I thought it would be and I would not be coming back"
Karl K.,"Los Angeles, CA",291,374,3668,4.0,11/27/2011,"Great waitstaff and tasty selections save the day! ----------- This was a last minute choice, after our original plans for dumplings was stymied by obscene waits of over an hour.  I'm glad we ended up here, since we had an awesome waitress.  Not only did she automatically offer to substitute brown rice in for the pasta that normally comes with their Jambalaya offering (seriously, who orders Jambalaya pasta?), but also she suggested making the dish ""heavy"", aka extra crushed tomatoes.  The chicken was tender; the sauce, zesty; and the tomatoes, bursting with flavor.  She saw to it that the lady's grilled salmon was cooked by the head line chef - meaning, it was moist and flavorful, subtly seasoned with whipping creme and fresh Rosemary, versus a dried piece of cardboard that is often the case when ordering seafood at a mega chain.  She definitely earned her 20%. Worth coming back next time we're in the mood for a mega chain."
Albert L.,"Temple City, CA",318,177,61,3.0,4/6/2014,"The portions are HUGE here so be mindful of what you order :) The last time I came here I ordered the shrimp scampi dish which was actually done really well. It was tasty and it wasn't too heavy. The portion was of course generous (as with all other Cheesecake Factory portions), but I shared it with my date. To top that off, I also ordered some shrimp rolls and a strawberry lemonade! YUMS!! For dessert I ordered a Oreo dream cheesecake and it really satisfied my sweet tooth. I was happy and full :)"
JJ A.,"San Marino, CA",57,100,230,5.0,3/30/2014,It's nice that they have lunch specials throughout the week.  I like their Brunch menu!...  My fav is their Crab Hash!...  My daughter's fav is the Pasta Davinci(?) lunch special.  Of course our fav cheesecake is the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  :o)
Jennifer H.,"Pasadena, CA",128,175,74,1.0,1/5/2015,"I don't enjoy going to old town on the weekends, so I came to this location.  Probably wont make that choice again. We were excited to go, we had few gift cards and my boyfriend wanted a steak and I wanted a salad with their yummy blue cheese dressing.   Since we had the gift cards, we decided to have a couple of drinks, which we don't normally do, since they are about $12 a drink, which is ridiculous to pay, especially in Arcadia.  But I love a good raspberry lemon drop and they make killer ones, so that's what I ordered.  The waiter seemed confused.  A raspberry lemonade?  No, a raspberry lemon drop... I know it's not on the menu, but I've been ordering them at multiple Cheesecake Factories for the last 5-10 years.  You put your raspberry puree at the bottom, then the rest is like a lemon drop.  Well, of course the waiter came back saying they didn't have them.  To me, it's quite ridiculous of a bar to say they don't have something... especially when they have all of the ingredients and you are paying $12 a drink.  I tried to explain I'd been ordering them for years, but I'd pick something else, to give me a minute. The waiter came back shortly saying there was a miscommunication at the bar, they did have them and I'd get one shortly.  The waiter came out with something not in a martini glass that was a raspberry lemonade type drink they had on the menu, which was not the same thing.  It really didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, and it was so hard to drink, it was insanely sweet.  I should have sent it back, but I felt like I didn't want to be a problem, didn't want spit in my drinks or food, etc.  I drank about half, put a bunch of water and ice in it and gulped down the drink as fast as I could, it was nauseating.   I then ordered a grey goose on the rocks, thinking they couldn't mess that up.  Wrong again... it was definitely not grey goose.  It tasted like lighter fluid.  We were seated outside, which I don't mind due to the heaters, but we had to listen to people honking non stop near the valet while we ate, which everyone outside was complaining about.  Luckily it started at the end of our meal, but it didn't make for a great dining experience.  To top it off, we had left over avocado egg rolls and it really irritates me when they don't pack up the dipping sauce with it.   It's a damn shame when the bread is the best part of the meal."
Karen Y.,"Montebello, CA",184,559,329,4.0,12/16/2013,"Food is always great here at a good price I feel. This particular location in at a mall so it obviously attracts more parking nightmares and crowds than most. Although Cheesecake Factory in general is always packed on weekends. Wait time is about 50 minutes on a weekend. I think they forgot about us last time we went because our beeper never went off and when we asked about our table after almost an hour they seemed surprised we were there and seated us immediately.  Despite the crowds, the chefs and waiters are always on par and food comes out fast and hot."
Seal S.,"West Covina, CA",30,158,15,2.0,5/8/2015,"I had arranged to meet my Mother here to celebrate Mothers Day with lunch and a movie. While waiting for her to show, she called and said she would be a couple of minutes late and that I can order for her. She loves the sweet tamales and I knew that the Cuban rolls that I had last time was no Bueno, so I ordered the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and a endive salad for us to share. It was hard to figure out who was actually helping us. I kind of felt in a no help zone. It took a while to get ANY help. The menu is SO extensive, and full of advertising that I guess I didn't see exactly what I had ordered. It was pork belly. Which I really like, usually. This was kind of undercooked and overcooked also. The bun was good, The sauce was excellent and some of the pork was good. What I didn't care for was the slaw, being on the bacon, on the pork. While the bacon was VERY good, a pork sandwich, is not necessarily in need of bacon. American excess! When I ordered, I told whoever it was that we were going to a movie and while we weren't really rushed, we needed to be expedient. Plus I paid then, so that my Mother wouldn't try to pay. So she cleaned her plate, and I had about 2/3 of my sandwich left. It was obvious we were done. Nobody would stop. I finally asked a waiter for a box, We waited, No box. I asked a waitress for a box, We waited. I told my Mother to prepare to leave, and walked to the front desk and told them of the failure. Then I left. With the tip (which was above the suggestion on the receipt) in my pocket. There are too many other good restaurants, right there, for me to put up with that shit."
Amy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1086,247,1693,3.0,6/8/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS packed...WHY?  Is it because of the cheesecake?  Is it because of the big portions or the terribly long and extensive menu selection?  Or maybe the food is just that good?  Hmmm.... Cheesecake Factory offers standard fare that's reliably consistent with a proper chain restaurant.  But why the constant large crowds here, I don't know.  The Arcadia location, huge in its gaudy new glamour, sits off to the side of the Santa Anita Mall.  This location is not quite as crowded as some of the other locations but it sure can get busy especially during the weekends.  My husband is a huge fan of their Farmhouse Cheeseburger ($10.95) topped with pork belly, cheese, and a fried egg!!!  For appetizers the Avocado Eggrolls ($9.95) and Crispy Crab Wontons $9.95 are decent choices.  Their salad portions are huge and you can't really go wrong although you may want to ask for dressing on the side if you don't like it too heavy.  The Chicken Madeira ($16.95) is a very popular dish but personally, I like their Teriyaki Chicken ($15.95); it's simple, tasty and prepared well.  While some may like their pasta, I'm not so fond of over-sauced over-cooked mushy noodles.  The breakfast is solid and I've never tried their steaks and grilled fish.  Sandwiches, tacos, pizzas, burgers, salads, chicken, steak, fish, huge appetizers, fried goodies...you'll be able to find something to eat.  And of course, they have a lengthy selection of cheesecakes to finish off your meal."
Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,289,566,1.0,7/5/2013,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have visited. I went last Monday after a church event. I went with a group of church friends and I arrived at around 11:15pm. I know that the place closes at 11:00pm so I wanted to order as soon as we got there, first of all, the waiter didn't even offer drinks. I wanted to get my order in right away so I requested a chicken madeira, a few minutes later the waiter said kitchen was closed and that he could only get us soup or salad. I opted for soup, the guy didn't mention the soup of the day which was lenti soup. I would never pay for lentils, they're so cheap and easy to make. It had bacon and some spice in it that was horrible. If it wasn't for my friend that offered a slice of his pizza I would not have eaten. I understand that the waiter wanted us to leave soon but that does not justify poor service, I didn't get refills on my water and he said that the kitchen was closed for coffee. How long does it take to brew a few cups of coffee? I didn't ask for the kitchen to be reopened but I did want my slice of cheesecake and coffee because I couldnt' eat. I hope I never have to go back there again!"
Amy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,102,39,4.0,3/23/2014,"If you are planing to eat here I suggest you don't come eat a snack beforehand. The wait for a table can vary from 30minutes to 1 hour.  Food is consistently good and they offer a wide selection. There cheesecakes are delicious. I am in love with the red velvet cheesecake.  Customer service is ok, nothing special.  I will continue to go back and mentally prepare for a long wait."
Mike S.,"Ventura, CA",5,77,4,4.0,5/26/2015,Great place with an insanely deep menu.  Skinnylicious menu is excellent.   Great service.
Rita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,357,83,3.0,10/14/2014,Quick lunch with a friend..it is your standard Cheesecake Factory. We kept it simple a cool drink to cool downa and a quick lunch of pasta...Let the shopping begin!!!
Lanise J.,"Altadena, CA",23,87,142,2.0,6/20/2014,"I went here with my daughter because she wanted chicken & biscuits . The biscuits were cold, but the rest of the food on the plate was hot.I told the waiter and manager. The manager really didn't care .he didn't offer free desert or anything. I'll stick with the one in Pasadena."
Linh T.,"Rosemead, CA",25,65,21,4.0,3/12/2014,"Their cheesecake section on the menu is awesome. They have varieties of cheesecakes. Very pricy but hey, once in awhile won't kill your wallet. I usually come here for a special occasions; bd, family dinner, etc..  Their service, first of all, is very nice. The waiters/waitresses are very attentive. They give you time to select what you want. They might give you what's their best suggestions on your order, which sometime is very helpful.  Their food wise is very okay price. But they have good food though. Like Steak Diane, the sauce with the mushroom is delicious. The portion of the food is quite small compares to the price, to be honest. Other than that, everything is well done. The waiters look professional than other of the food restaurant I've been to. Varieties of food you can select, and best of all; delicious cheesecakes. :)"
