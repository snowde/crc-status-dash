Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1657,3140,2.0,5/9/2011,"Not a fan at all for this location. It is located on the crowded side of the mall where all the food is. If you are coming here on the weekend expect to wait a while. But mainly I am not a fan because of my many experiences at this specific Cheesecake Factory.  I been here many times and can say that the service is sometimes unbelievable. Sometimes servers are really not paying attention. From waiting for drinks to taking the order could be a very long process. Also sometimes the food order is not done right be it that you didn't want a certain ingredient in the food or vegetable, it will still be in the plate you ordered.  I came here once with a table of 8 just for a casual lunch dining experience with a few friends. Got a few drinks and that was fine. But when it came to the food they were missing three dishes and it took them 30 minutes while having to send one back.  I asked to speak to the manager and they did give everyone on our table free slices of cheesecake for the mess up! Also taking 10 percent out of the bill.  Now I just don't even have Cheesecake Factory on my list of going to eat with large groups of people. Because I don't want this happening to me again. If anything maybe I will try a different Cheesecake Factory store than this location in Arcadia."
Richard B.,"San Gabriel, CA",690,252,1289,3.0,4/9/2012,"My wife and I used to love coming to this place when they first opened. The place provided a familiar, well-decorated atmosphere where we know exactly the food quality we would expect. Over the years, the place has gotten too crowded as with many of their locations and the quality of the service and atmosphere has gone down. I won't say any positive or negative things about their food. I give them 3.5 stars on food, but the service lever is 3 stars at best and the waiting and the crowd noise will keep me away until there's an occasion to bring me back. I know they cant do anything about the crowd and the busy environment, but hope they'll at least bring the service level back up."
Food B.,"Monrovia, CA",129,46,2,3.0,4/11/2016,"A lot of good stuff and variety here, but a couple issues. They have an entire page of pasta dishes but NO whole wheat option? Not even one kind for a substitution, in SoCal, no less? Please, join the 21st century, how much trouble can it be? But the larger issue is - when I asked for a comment card to make a suggestion the waitress told me I can go home and go to their website! So no method for customer input in the actually restaurant tells me that they don't really care what customers think. There are plenty of competitors who DO care about customers, sorry !"
Mona C.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,121,132,1.0,11/9/2013,"Wow.  Had a really disappointing dinner here. The first time I came here the food was just ok-very fried and greasy. Like many others, I was impressed by their variety but having worked in the restaurant business, I know variety rarely allows for consistency or any specialty at all. I guess the only specialty here is their cheesecake.  My reason for the one star is that I came here for dinner and had chicken sliders that tasted like greasy KFC. I was also told they have no MSG free options and their gluten free menu appeared very limited. After notifying the waitress that I did not enjoy my entree of choice at all, all she said was ""Ohhhh."" In a sad tone. That's all. No apology. No questions. No suggestions for a different item. And as if that didn't outrage me enough, she had the nerve to follow up her shallow 'ohh' with ""well, and room for dessert?"" Really?!...no thanks Cheesecake Factory-you've failed to impress me at all. ....your cheesecake is good-but that's about it.  Pros; Clean Spacious Patio seating available Great variety in menu Amazing cheesecake Cons; Bad service Mediocre food Why do restaurants think extremely dim lighting is the hottest thing since sliced bread?!  Overall do not recommend. If you happen to find yourself at this particular location, head over to the neighboring WoodRanch or something ...."
Macy H.,"Irvine, CA",630,293,142,4.0,12/22/2013,"Highly recommend the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Everyone else in my party was envious of my order and kept asking to try a little bit more, hehee. If you go before 5pm you can still order the lunch portions, and although I'm a big eater I feel that the lunch portions are a decent size. Everything is around $10-12 max for lunch portions. The regular dinner sizes can range around $16. Fettuccine Alfredo was a bit too creamy for my liking, and the Smoked Salmon was kind of bland. I would try it with the herbs next time. I know it's supposed to contribute to the ambience and everything, but the lighting was super dim and it started giving me a headache. Blagh. Other than that, everything else is good. Solid 4 stars!"
Chanel B.,"Arcadia, CA",0,3,12,1.0,7/30/2013,"I came around 6:00 pm - 30th of July in Arcadia to try some of their cheesecakes. While waiting for my name to be called, I checked their cheesecakes on the counter & noticed this gentleman with a black shirt and tie on the corner on the counter helping with the cheesecake orders. He used his bare fingers to place the cookie on top of the cheese cakes orders, My daughter noticed him too , I observed him doing it  4 times with few minutes interval and during that time he dropped a receipt on the floor  then picked it up with his hand, then he scooped with his two hands ( like a shovel ) the cookies from a brown box to refill the cookie container. After that I just told my daughter to leave the place. I'm being generous giving this place One Star rating ."
Audrey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,190,118,3.0,7/11/2013,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. One thing I really love about this location is that they are super accommodating about strollers.  Why the 3 stars? Because our server SUCKED... Only came by to get our order, once our food got there he asked how was our food... Ok, we haven't even tried it yet... And to give us our check... Needless to say... Didn't get a tip..."
Lucy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,1418,6065,4.0,4/1/2011,"After a harrowing hour of shoe shopping at Nordstrom : P, we decided to fortify ourselves with DESSERT! Our server Nicole was the SWEETEST thing ever - super gracious and friendly!  She brought Laura D and I extra stuff for our desserts, and made our sweet tooths super happy: Hot Fudge Sundae ($6.50) - vanilla ice cream + whipped cream + extra hot fudge + a cherry on top = a BIG smile from Laura D! Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95) - layers of cheesecake in between crimson red velvet cake layers, topped with cream cheese icing, and extra whipped cream on the side means OMG I'm in heaven!   Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake ($6.95) - layers of pineapple upside down cake and cheesecake, with whipped cream and a cherry on top - OMG, I LOVE this one!  I'm a pineapple upside down cake lover, so I can't imagine NOT loving this dessert. We also got some of the strongest iced decaf coffees I've ever had - which was PERFECT with the desserts, and on this 90-degree day. Thank you Nicole, you're awesome!!"
Jason M.,"San Diego, CA",1,44,,4.0,7/24/2014,Ate here twice in the same day. Once for lunch and later in the bar. Both times we had issues with missing silverware. Had to hunt down server for the bill at lunch.
Lili P.,"North Hills, CA",13,5,2,1.0,4/25/2015,Worst seating people ever... Will not dine here again ... Waiting was 35 minutes ... After 1hr we were still not seated. People who arrived after us were seated first.
Jerri N.,"Arcadia, CA",0,21,72,1.0,5/11/2015,"The service sucks! I only got to see mu waiter three times. The first time was when he came to get the bill from the previous customer and he said he will be right back. I waited for ten minutes and no show. I had to get a manger to help me and get my order, but she was super friendly. Then the second time he came over was saying how sorry he was and told me that my food would be out soon. (I think he only came over to say sorry because he got yell by the manger.) When my food came out he didn't even brought it to me it was another manger, and she was also friendly too. I got to see him the third time was to give me my check. Worst service ever! I have never been so disappointed by cheesecake service. I only gave one star because of the friendly mangers. They even refill my drinks too!!!"
Hanson T.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,204,1558,4.0,4/5/2013,"I avoided The Cheesecake Factory for the longest time because I had the misconception that no respectable establishment would or could ever serve good food in a shopping center, and especially not near a food court. Big mistake on my part because this place has stellar service and serves amazing food in bloat-inducing portions.  No idea what it's like at other locations, but the service here is excellent, comparable to what you'd experience at a higher-end restaurant. On both of my visits, my waiters were lightning fast, attentive, helpful, unabashed and simply awesome. Their suggestions made ordering for a first-timer much easier, especially considering the huge selection of items. No blunders were made with our orders, and our servers were so great that I wouldn't have been bothered if there had been.  While there's nothing wrong with the ambiance inside, I prefer their outdoor seating. It was a bit stuffy when I sat inside, but I enjoyed every minute of my outside dining experience.  Even on a chilly night, the patio heater hovering over our table kept us warm and cozy. Definitely consider getting a table outside, if there's one available.  We had to wait a bit before our entrees arrived, but the baskets of complimentary bread kept us occupied. To our shock, our waiter confirmed that the brown bread we kept requesting was actually just their version of wheat bread. Still, it was seriously addictive, and I would have loved to take a couple of loaves home.  I had the Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes on my first visit, and it was phenomenal. Covered under a layer of melted cheese and glazed with sweet, succulent mushroom Madeira sauce, was a large piece of  sautéed chicken breast. My knife cut cleanly into the chicken and each bite of meat was delightfully moist and tender. On a subsequent visit, I had the Hibachi Steak. Though it didn't taste quite as exquisite as the Chicken Madeira, the steak was well-seasoned and cooked exactly to my preference, and I found it similarly satisfying. On both occasions, my entree was served with a side of mashed potatoes, which had the rich, creamy consistency typical of traditional mashed potatoes, nuanced by a mixture of textural elements, transforming a household side dish into an appetizing pleasure. Neither the steak nor chicken were visually impressive and I could feel the pounds packing on as my meal progressed, but compromising my diet for delicious food was a tradeoff I was prepared to make.  We found most of their desserts to be less enjoyable. The Godiva chocolate sundae was good for the first few bites, but it quickly became a chore to finish. The Oreo cheesecake was equally decadent, with flavors far too rich for a palate accustomed to tasting sweets in moderation. Even when shared between my entire party, the desserts remained unfinished. We avoided a chocolate-based dessert altogether on our second visit, and opted for the mango key lime cheesecake instead. While still a tad too sweet, the cheesecake was good, and something I could actually eat a whole slice of.  The Cheesecake Factory is a reliable chain that features a relatively unchanging, but comprehensive and diverse menu, making it a suitable choice for any occasion and a great destination for groups that have trouble deciding where to eat."
Robert- Bobby C.,"Buena Park, CA",168,174,496,4.0,3/23/2011,"I finally found another location better than the one in Americana.. I wanted try somewhere else.. This is a great location and closer to our place.. Parking is plenty in the weekday.. I can't imagine parking here in the weekend because I'd rather go to a pho shop close by than kill myself looking for parking at the Westfield (Santa Anita) Mall.. We came here around lunch time.. Kevin was our waiter, very attentive and efficient dude.. Loved his service.. My wife wanted to try something different so she ordered the American Kobe Beef.. I ordered the chinese chicken salad... And for appetizers, I ordered the fried calamari..  First came the breads.. I love their sweet wheat bread.. It blends good with the butter.. The butter was kinda semi melted when I was unwrapping it.. I just used once cube and wiped the whole thing on a huge chunk of bread.. I don't like the white bread that much.. Then came the fried calamari... Each calamari wasn't too breaded and it's not as crunchy as the ones in Chinese restaurants.. But it wasn't bad dipped in garlic and cocktail sauce.  Then came both of our orders.. The American Kobe beef burger has sauteed mushrooms and onions on a toasted Brioche Bun. The tomato and lettuce where separated on the side. It came with the sweet potato fries  . Now these were good, crunchy and not salty.. I tasted her Kobe beef and it was pretty tasty  . The chef overcooked it a little.. We ordered it to be medium well not well done..  The chinese chicken salad has sliced chicken breast, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds. Tossed in a special Chinese plum dressing... This is way better than the Caesar Salad I ordered a months ago..   For dessert, we ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae..  Godiva chocolate brownie, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds... OMG, that sundae is a monster. Enough said. hahaha  I was satisfied with the service because Kevin (our waiter) just refills our drinks every time it goes half way..  Overall, service was great, food was good, ambiance was perfect..  Especially aroun lunch time when only a few people there and there's plenty of parking..."
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,4.0,12/12/2011,"I like cheesecake factory because of the variety of items on their menu, their attempt to offer ""skinny"" lower calorie options and of course for their cheesecakes. This location can get pretty crowded during weekend evenings, but so far I've been pretty lucky to get seated w/in 5 minutes of walking in (during the weekend evenings, I usually come around 8 pm or later).  So far the service has been pretty good. It is easy to find a server if I need something and the kitchen makes foods to my special requests (I always ask for salad dressing on the side and if I order a sandwich or a burger, I always ask for it to be cut in half. It is just easier to eat this way).  One of my favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. Although this is an appetizer, this really is like a full on meal that you could share w/ 2 or 3 other people. The 3 different sauces are absolutely perfect and has a nice balance with the chicken and veggies that you can wrap up in a lettuce cup. I love the way this dish is plated because it looks just beautiful.  I have tried probably about half of the cheesecakes so far and someday would like to try all of them. I especially love to go during the holidays when the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is available.  A few things that I do have some complaints about this place is that at night, the lighting is too dim for me. I wish the restaurant had more lights. I get that since it is in the evening they want to make it more of a romantic atmosphere, but I would prefer just a tad bit more light. Also the floors here are a bit slippery. I don't know if they wax the floors or not, but they really shouldn't. I've seen a few people slip when walking on the floors and I sometimes I feel like I am going to slip when I get up from my table and walk over to the restrooms.   Generally the service here is pretty good, but it just depends on what server you get. I have had a server who was very attentive and very friendly. But I have also had a server who was absent during the entire meal, until it was time to pay for the check.  But other than those issues, this place is pretty good and it keeps me coming back."
Hui X.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,2,4.0,11/14/2014,Invited by friend for dinner. Casual decoration but friendly. We choosed the sofa at window. Average price with mass food. (It's too much/each for a girl) 4 people cost about $170 from appetizer/main menu/dessert. Service is good and warm. A place will come again and suggested to friends.
J B.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",1,24,1,2.0,3/29/2015,One of my favorite places to eat.. But for the first time it sucked.. Anything we oredetd fried was bad.. I mean comman you guys can afford to change the oil more than once a day right? Terrible cheesecake location.. Im sorry but the chef needs to know its tine to change the oil.. At least the manager came and offered to comp some dessert..
David W.,"Santa Clara, CA",601,1208,866,4.0,8/1/2011,"So many people overlook that this is the CHEESECAKE factory, and skip over dessert totally when they're here!!! Ahh!!!! It's tricky cause the entrees and specialties are pretty good and the portion sizes are huge.   All the cheesecakes are delicious.  I have yet to try everyone.   Tiramisu and Key Lime seem to be a favorite with my friends."
Saroya W.,"San Francisco, CA",238,174,94,4.0,3/22/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well known franchise of restaurants with good food and delicious dessert. This review is not so much about the food as it is about the customer service. I went last weekend with my parents for dinner and they ended up giving me the wrong entree.  I'm pretty easy going, so waiting was not a big deal to me. However, my waiter offered me a salad/soup while I waited and the manager came by and apologized himself! My food was delivered soon after and they came by a few more times to make sure I was satisfied. Now that's awesome customer service! Quick notes about food: -The Chicken salad sandwich is delicious. Especially the bread they use. -Their french fries are really yummy. -The pulled pork sandwich is very tender -The carrot cake is a tad dry -The Cherry cheesecake is my FAVORITE. -The Red Velvet cheesecake is definitely one to try."
Ronnie D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,14,,5.0,4/11/2016,Once in a while you get bad service but overall i love this location.  Food can also depend on which chef is working as ive had the same dish with different experiences.  They have a sunday brunch dish with pancakes and they were really good.  Highly recommend.
King H.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,204,132,4.0,6/11/2013,"Very consistent, great and attentive waiter/esses. This place is HUGE so don't worry about the wait. They usually move people really fast."
