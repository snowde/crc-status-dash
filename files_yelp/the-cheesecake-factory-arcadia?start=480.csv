Grand C.,"Pasadena, CA",462,245,380,4.0,1/8/2014,"Yay!!! I'm a fan!  More than a fan, you have 100+ things on the menu.  Sometimes I sit there, flipping pages even though I know what they have. Trying to figure what I want to eat, how much I want to spend, do i want to eat healthy or go all out, review the skinnylicious menu, then after dinner weather or not i should have cheesecake or other desserts.   tonight i went with my family.  My dad had a Miso Salmon, my mom had the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and I had the Barbecue Salmon with Corn Succotash and broccoli. I loved the dish i got, the fish was cooked medium. I wish it was a little under, medium rare.  The fish marinade with bbq sauce on top was really delicious.  I was quite happy I ordered this.  My mom made me one of her lettuce wraps, and that was really good too.  These lettuce wraps are messy but really delicious, I might order that next time!   What's not to like about this restaurant. You have a million options, the food is good if not great, of course depends on what dish you order, the appetizers are delicious, and the desserts/cheesecake are really good.   Few favorite dishes/desserts are: Chicken Bellagio, Miso Salmon, BBQ Salmon, Avocado Rolls, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, Santa Fe Salad, BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, and Cajun Jambalaya!"
Talia R.,"South Pasadena, CA",87,85,9,5.0,1/6/2014,"Went to Cheesecake last night before a movie. It was extremely crowded but we got lucky and found 4 seats at the bar. Our food took about 30 min, which is not a big deal except we were late for the movie. We ended up having to get to-go boxes as soon as the food came. The manager was extremely apologetic even though it was completely unnecessary and offered us complementary cheesecake to go. We did not think we would be able to take in anymore food into the theater so we declined the offer. They offered us to come back and pick up our cake after the movie (even though they closed an hour before the movie got out). We were so pleased and impressed with the generosity of the manager and all the staff.  I don't normally give so much detail when I Yelp, but this is probably one of the top customer service gestures I've ever received and I wanted to share!"
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",961,856,7732,4.0,5/5/2009,"When I like something, I tend to go back over and over.  Cheesecake Factory has been one of those standby, good restaurants.  It can be fairly healthy depending on what you order.   My latest discovery at Cheesecake Factory is the Turkey Burger!  I tried it for the first time the last time I ate at CF.  It was very good, so I had it again this visit.  It comes with french fries.  $10.95. Service is normally excellent at Cheesecake Factory and this time was no exception.  Like I mentioned in a previous review, I like their sourdough with butter.  Yummy! I like this location better than the one in Pasadena because the wait is normally shorter.  Our wait was about 10 minutes on a Saturday evening around 8pm. Cheers!"
Calla L.,"Monrovia, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/1/2014,"I have a number of favorite dishes at Cheesecake Factory and was excited to use curbside pickup because it's always impossibly crowded at this location. The first time was fine. The second time was a nightmare. It took nearly 80 minutes to bring our order out, this after we called twice to see what was holding it up. When they finally bring it out, there is no apology or bread. They grudgingly returned with our credit card and 2 pieces of bread for a $75 order. My husband said it best: never again. An apology would have gone a long way with me, but I guess they were too busy to bother. As a final insult, our food was cold and had to be reheated. Clearly, it had been sitting around all along. Great job choosing my birthday to be annoying, CF. Lame."
Kristin T.,"San Gabriel, CA",380,295,374,4.0,8/24/2013,"My problem is I don't like change and always want to stick with what I know will taste good but seems like whatever I order here is always really good! Sometimes restaurants with huge menus can have mediocre food because there's just so much to choose from, but the Cheesecake Factory does a good job making sure all their food is top notch. I'm not much of a cheesecake fan, but here at Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the only place I eat cheesecake at. I don't like how they can get too rich and thick and overwhelming tasting but here their cheesecakes are delicious! I just stick with a simple strawberry cheesecake, plain cheesecake with some strawberries and syrup. Yum. Tip, DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE. At least around nighttime. There are SOO many flies out there it's disgusting. I understand it's near the racetrack so maybe that's why. But honestly, there were about 50+ flies just sitting on the bar window. On the ground about 20+ just sitting there till someone walks by and they fly everywhere. I could care less about flies but when they start flying into your face and on your food, that bothers me. Cheesecake Factory should really invest in those scented bug off candles or some sort of repellant."
Eddie M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/7/2015,"When arriving to the restaurant our waiter seemed to be under the influence. He was very attentive and had slurred speach. Made it very difficult to understand him. Kept coming to our table every two minutes. My drink tasted weird so when inspecting the glass a piece of the rim was broken off leaving behind a sharp edge. If it wasn't for the straw I would of probably cut myself. The waiter apologized but seemed to shrug it off and change the subject. To top it off my meal was cold and it tasted awful. The waiter noticed i barely ate any and placed it in a container for me which I threw away in the entrances trash can. Horrible location to visit. Don't come here. Management must be horrible to have such poor standards from staff, food and service. Waste of money."
Veronica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,2,1.0,8/8/2015,"How can I even begin to describe my disgusting experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia????  As I was enjoying a supposedly delicious kale salad and as I was about to take a bite , I noticed something squirming. I put the fork down and poked at it. Low and behold a disgusting snail in my kale salad. Wtf!!!! I could not believe my eyes. I threw out the salad in my mouth and called for the waiter. Long story short the manager tried to make up for this disgusting incident by giving me a damn cheesecake. Hell no. Oh yeah and comp my salad.  Keep your eyes on every bite when you order a salad!"
Anthony L.,"Pasadena, CA",101,271,29,3.0,1/21/2015,"Food is generally consistently good. It's a chain restaurant, so you should expect everything to be consistent. The cheesecake is always good, but it has to get thawed everyday before they serve it. That means their cheesecake is made in some sort of factory somewhere and then gets frozen before it's shipped to the restaurant. It makes me wonder though. If the plate comes to you hot, is the food microwaved?"
Dietrich S.,"Orange, CA",124,263,44,1.0,12/11/2012,"Oh, why the hell did I come here? I hate the Cheescake Factory. I have been to multiple locations and I've always hated it, for various reasons at different times. Sloppy service, shite food, high prices, lame atmosphere. You pick, this place can dish up any or all on any given night.  I was with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend, and we were near this particular Cheesecake Factory, and I said lets go for it. She (smartly) told me ""No, you know you hate that place."" I insisted. ""Maybe it will be ok"" I thought to myself. Hey, the world just seems like a brighter and better place with her around. And Cheesecake sounded good anyway. I had never actually tried the cheesecake here. It seemed like a good night to do it.  I felt like Macaroni and Cheese, and so did the GF. They don't seem to have that here (the one thing that they DON'T actually have on their godforsaken menu), so I ordered the Five Cheese Pasta (with chicken) and she ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger, and we split them. The five cheese pasta was a flavorless mess, and the extra money for the chicken was not worth it. Once again, no surprise, another culinary failure from the Cheesecake Factory.  The Macaroni and Cheeseburger is slightly better, but only just. The beef patty for the burger itself had a strange and none-too-pleasing flavor, but the fried Mac-N-Cheese patty was good. Hey, I guess even Cheesecake Factory can't screw that up. Of course, those patties probably come to them frozen. Not hard to just dip them in a deep frier.  So hey, dinner was a bit of a waste (well, a huge waste), but what about desert? The waiter brings the desert menu around and shows off thier featured cheesecake, a yummy looking oreo cookie concoction. I peruse the menu looking at the various cheescake selections, of wich there are quite a few. Then I notice the price, $6.95 - $7.95 per slice. What? Seriously? I asked the waiter if that was for like 1/4 of a cheesecake, and he said no, but that they are decent slices. I felt like telling him to go eff himself, but it wasn't his fault, he doesn't set the prices, and he was a nice guy who gave us good service, really the only upside to the night. As it was, the bill was $31.43 after tax but before tip, with no drinks, no appetizers, and no fucking overpriced Cheesecake. Just two lame-assed dinner entrees.   So, seriously Cheesecake Factory, fuck you. I'm not kidding. I don't like to be vulgar or crass or rude in my yelp reviews, but I have to do it this time. You guys suck ass, and furthermore, anyone who really likes this place doesn't know a good meal from a hole in the ground. Again, I don't like to get all snobby about my foody-ness, but I'm going to this time. After being thoroughly disappointed by three different Cheesecake Factory locations on four separate occasions over the last six years (that I recall) I will never darken your towers again. Your chefs should be ashamed of themselves, and the fact that you are still in business just goes to prove the old adage that nobody ever went broke by underestimating the bad taste of the American public."
Romana L.,"West Covina, CA",260,24,10,4.0,9/1/2014,"It's always a hit or miss with this place. Sometimes, the service is attentive and quick, but other times it's slow and disappointing. None the less, the food is always good! & The cheesecakes are to die for! Yummm. :)"
Angelica M.,"Alhambra, CA",14,23,207,4.0,4/24/2013,Came here for my birthday. I ordered the Steak Diane it was delicious. Our waiter was really nice and friendly he made us laugh a couple times. The strawberry and red velvet cheesecake was very good.
Yvonne P.,"El Monte, CA",234,170,52,4.0,9/25/2014,"ORDER: Pasta da Vinci, luau salad, avocado eggrolls, herb crusted salmon, cream of mushroom chicken soup, tropical smoothie, tropical iced tea, chicken marsala, the Original cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, godiva chocolate cheesecake, oreo dream extreme cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, (upon sitting they serve you white bread and wheat bread with butter) GOOD: + Food: Delicious! I love almost every savory dish that comes out. I'm not too big on sweets so the cheesecakes aren't really for me, but a little nibble here and there is enough--great for sharing. (I mean everything is--they have great portions for their foods.) + Atmosphere: really nice! Clean, large seating spaces, beautiful decor. This is a good place for a large group of family/friends, a small group of coworkers, or even a date. + Service: The servers and hosts/hostesses are generally very nice and helpful. (I only wish they could leave the Parmesan cheese block and grater on our table--it's against their policy...and I love my cheese!)      + Customer service: If a problem ever arose, they were always on it! + Price: not bad for a place and food like this! + Parking: private parking lot available (shared with the mall). There's also a valet service in front of the Cheesecake Factory and a parking structure behind it. BAD: - Food (to-go): Generally there aren't any problems, but I suggest you check your to-go orders before you leave the premises. Just in case. That's just a good habit for any place you go to. OVERALL: I keep coming back for a reason! ;)"
Regina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,780,2001,4.0,4/18/2013,I've been here many times in the past but I've recently been ordering to go so I don't have to wait for a table. I went on a Saturday morning at around 1pm and ordered the fried chicken salad ($10) and a shrimp and bacon sandwich with a side salad ($14). I brought it home to share with everyone and everything was delicious! The chicken salad was my favorite because it came with a decadent buttermilk dressing. The person who took my order was also super friendly and kept telling me how much I'd love the fried chicken salad. He was right! I'll get it the next time I go. The order took about 20 minutes to make so I just went next door to paris baguette while they were preparing it.
Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,11/21/2010,"Despite this being a chain restaurant (with a usually ridiculous wait), their food never ceases to be delicious. I had the Wild Mushroom Glamburger. (Is that like a burger inspired by Adam Lambert?) I know they have a gazillion things on the menu, but I just can't get away from their burgers! There are so many that sound amazing, and the mushroom burger was one I tried that definitely lived up to the enticing description. It has lots of sautéed mushrooms and onions, and is covered in melted Swiss and Fontina cheese. It was so good! ...I upgraded to the sweet potato fries for a dollar - they were not the best I've had, so I didn't finish them (a rare occasion for me - I'm the SPF Queen!). My BF loves the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta entrée. (He convinced three people in our group to order it, as well!) I have to admit, I tried some of his dish, and it wasn't as flavorful as other times we've had it, but it was still good. The chef really loads it up with chicken and shrimp. We also shared a house Salad, which had a really good dressing and was really fresh. They don't skimp on the greens, either! Other orders in our group were the enormous Sunrise Fiesta Burrito (two friends shared this and the jambalaya and both were devoured), Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes (she said it was okay), and a Mushroom Pizza with a ranch side salad (no verdict). For dessert, we shared two cheesecakes - the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake, and the classic Tiramisu Cheesecake. The Pumpkin Pecan was good... but didn't taste like cheesecake. (I could just get a Costco pumpkin pie, add some pecans, and be just as happy!) The Tiramisu Cheesecake is absolutely delectable. It's the perfect combination of the two dessert flavors. I have before, and would again get, a whole Tiramisu Cheesecake. :) Everyone knows the wait at this CF is lengthy, and the restaurant is packed (bar area included). The wait at 6:30 on a Friday night for a party of eight was one hour (they don't take reservations at that time). It was fine with me though, because the beeper signal reaches all the way over to the tons of bar space at Bar Louie! How convenient!"
Toma C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1042,4186,5.0,7/20/2013,"They added a new sour dough bread, it was very crusty and chewy, I loved it.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls.  The skinny herb roasted salmon salad was delicious.  It had such a great taste for only 590 calories. And very filling and satisfying.  I order the shrimp scampi and it was more flavors than I expected it was delicious and steaming hot.  I love It when they serve it when it is just made instead of it siting for a while. We were so full I couldn't even think about the tiramisu and cheesecake.  An excellent food experience and excellent service from Eddie."
Connie C.,"Orange County, CA",633,392,1135,1.0,11/29/2012,"Eleven months ago...the food and the service was excellent. What happened? Management.  First, we were greeted very quickly. We were seated as well and given menus. Then, I wanted to go to the restroom to wash my hands and omg...horrid...the most unsanitary restroom. The stalls...disgusting. I went to the front desk to tell them to clean the restroom and I stood there for a good three minutes. The hostess was too busy communicating with her co-workers that they even noticed and did not say anything. Strike one. Second, I went back to the table and glanced through the menu...took awhile since the menu was soooo long. Then, our waitress decided to come to our table...twenty minutes later. Strike two.  Third, we ordered 3 items...Factory chopped salad, chicken carbonara with meat sauce (lactose, so I didn't have the garlic green pea cream sauce), and miso salmon. The factory chopped salad had onions, mozzarella (supposed to be blue cheese, but I changed it), avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, corn, and chicken. This was refreshing; however, the onions definitely threw off the flavor as well as the vinaigrette (very tangy). The chicken carbonara has bacon (made perfectly), spaghetti, basil, and meat sauce. This didn't taste that great because the olive oil was too overwhelming taking away the flavor of the dish. The meat sauce was salty and wasn't cooked to my liking (stick with Buca or Olive Garden). Lastly, the miso salmon is made with your choice of white or brown rice (brown of course), and had snap peas for decorations. The dish was beautifully displayed. The salmon was cooked to perfection, just melted in my mouth. The snap peas...disappointed because they forgot to peel the top portion which should have been pulled off. The sauce was pretty good though. So one out of three? Kind of a miss for me. The unlimited bread that was given was hard as a rock as well as the butter. So really...I guess this makes it Strike three? Overall, eleven months ago...what was I thinking giving five stars? That must have been a facade...because the food and service are dwindling downwards. I would suggest Brea, The Grove or Rancho Cucamonga."
Gina D.,"Highland, CA",1,2,1,1.0,1/21/2013,"So, let me start of by saying I frequent the Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Cucamonga. While not perfect, I usually have good food and service. This location however disappointed me. We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. I ordered a salad and my company ordered a chicken sandwich. Our food came, my salad wasn't the one I ordered, so our server suggested I see if I like the one they gave me. Mmmhh I dont like iceberg lettuce so there really wasn't a chance in hell I was going to eat this salad it was nothing like what I wanted, so she was going to get me a new one.  Fine. First problem fixed. But the real problem was the chicken sandwich we ordered... had an obvious. black. hair. on top of the bun.  just chillen there.  I told our waitress there was a hair on our food. She says, ""oh, that's gross. I'm sorry"". And continues to try to help me fix my salad. Huh?? So... She expects us to just deal with the hair? She doesn't take it away, offer to get a new one. Nothing. Wtf is this shit?  So at this point I don't care what salad they bring ME. what about that hair?! I ask to speak to a manager. He says something like, ""oh that's strange she didn't ask to get you a new one"" he offers us cheesecake and some other garbage but still handles the situation poorly. By this time we had been stating at our ineddible food long enough I was ready to go. The manager says, ""oh okay, I'll get you your check"". No you won't. Haha we didn't eat anything! We left.  :)"
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,2.0,11/13/2012,"I'm going to be upfront and say it, I don't see the appeal of coming to The Cheesecake factory.  For so long I was able to dodge any forced attempt to bring me out to this restaurant chain that is a jack of all trades but a master of none. Unless you consider mastering a dish injecting enough sodium to kill a small donkey. Because that's what the food taste like.  Also it taste like misery.  I say misery because I don't know how else describe a poor sense of taste that would result in answering ""Where do you want to go for your Birthday/Father's day/Mother's Day/Graduation/?"" than by having no answer leading you to choose the cheesecake factor for such festivities.  It shouldn't, but yet it's one of those go to places and all humanity suffers for this.  In any case, the service was slow, though given the level of demand that most folks have in this ""Babies first dining out experience"", it's hard to not have a wait staff that isn't soul crushed by poor to little to  no tipping what-so-ever.  But the menu is the real problem. I'm not sure why places like this really try to master all dishes. They always end up falling short and this is no exception. You're paying for atmosphere, that's probably it and considering you're in Santa Anita, there's a lot better options to choose from if you just expanded that closed off range.  But hey, come on down if you can't figure out any other place that would be safe to bring the whole family..."
Frank C.,"Arcadia, CA",0,4,,3.0,3/12/2016,"There is always a long wait here but, the food is always pretty good. They have a huge menu. Great for everyone."
George B.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,4.0,5/10/2015,"Long wait on Mother's Day. But looking forward to the great food and large portions!  I'm going to get some avocado egg rolls, spicy chipotle pasta and my wife is getting the bbq chicken salad"
