Tom T.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",556,581,233,3.0,2/28/2011,"I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory three times: once in the Pasadena one with my mom and aunt, once in the Americana in Glendale with a few co-workers after the hoilday rush, and recently with a friend whom I haven't seen in a long time. The main reason why I don't like going to Cheesecake is the prices; it's kind on the steep side, where a basket of 5 fish and chips is like 10 bucks, but there's a HUGE helping of coleslaw. Kind of fishy, literally. My friend ordered the Santa Fe salad, lunch portion, but he said that the portion seemed WAY too big for lunch. The location of this place isn't too bad, on the outskirts of the Westfield Mall of Santa Anita, which is located right next to the race tracks. Service was great, even though after the bartender checked on us twice, my friend had to go to the bar to place the order. Restroom was kind of freaky, how there's a full-length mirror RIGHT when you enter the Men's room. Nice to check yourself before leaving, but still, kind of freaky."
Ash V.,"Covina, CA",13,24,25,5.0,10/20/2013,"Service was great! I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was cooked to perfection. I also loved their pumpkin cheesecake, it's only seasonal so I'm glad I tried it."
Melanie O.,"Glendale, CA",340,661,63,4.0,3/14/2013,"Would I trek all this way down just for Cheesecake?  No silly.  The Americana is walking-distance from me, and doesn't have the nightmarish parking that Sta. Anita does.  But, my brother-in-law had us meet him here, and we obliged. That being said, we got seated quicker than we do at the Americana, despite being busy.  Our server was attentive and regularly stopped by.  Our food was good and no complaints all around, except for parking.  Also, not as much outdoor seating as the Americana seems to have, but again, not a big deal for us as we were eating inside. But again, parking is a doozie, and a big fail all around for this mall for me."
Damon L.,"Montebello, CA",115,162,52,2.0,11/10/2014,"Have never really been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes pre-packaged and microwaved.  There was one time my friend ordered a spicy chicken dish and asked if they could omit the spice.  The waitress said it couldn't be done because all the sauce was pre-made.  Given that, i'd much rather eat at the food court.  In comparison, Panda Express, Chipotle, and Greate Khans cooks the food in front of you so you know it's not pre-packed.  Also so much cheaper."
bob z.,"Temple City, CA",2,2,,1.0,2/1/2016,Sat down during happy hour and 40 mins in no food. Pretty disappointed . Asked for refill on water 20 mins and counting . This is sad lol . Table next to us sat down same time as us and had the food came in less than 10 mins.
Derek W.,"Los Angeles, CA",467,633,2477,4.0,1/23/2011,"One of the few restaurant chains that is always packed with people regardless of the time of day.  Be prepared to wait an hour plus for a table.  After the countless times I've dined at various locations, the food is always consistent.  For some odd reason, I always end up ordering the same dish (chicken piccata or the bistro rock shrimp pasta) though offering a huge menu.  Portions are huge and never I can finish an entree.  Perhaps the reason for this is I always end up eating 2-3 loaves of their wheat bread myself.   Needless to say they also have an extensive cheesecake menu and a slice is often enough big enough for 3-4 people to share.  They are constantly developing new flavors and always have a hard time deciding which one to order for dessert."
Elaine K.,"Pico Rivera, CA",10,54,,4.0,9/20/2013,"The perks of a large franchise - consistency. I feel like this review will work for many Cheesecake Factory locations. Decor is the same. Menu choices are the same. Quality of food is similar. Quality of service is across the board decent. But, because of its similarities, I avoid this restaurant like the plague when I'm on vacation or out of town.  However, it's a great place to meet a friend for a quick happy hour catch-up sesh or a refueling lunch after some shopping at the Santa Anita mall."
Kenny R.,"Azusa, CA",247,76,108,4.0,3/28/2013,"Been to the Cheesecake factory a million times. Never once actually tried the Cheesecake...I know....I'm a rebel. Or just an idiot...because I waited until my last visit and it was AMAZING! First off if you've been, which I think the whole world may have been, you would know they have like 40 different types of cheesecake. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough, a la mode, with hot fudge. Ya...it was like 1200 calories in one sitting...but totally worth it. It was like eating a little bit of heaven. It's always busy at this location and most locations. The wait for this one was about 20-30 minutes when we came on a Friday night. A nice little pre-movie treat!"
Tracy P.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,39,1,3.0,9/1/2014,"On the day we came (8/23/2014), the servers seemed to be having trouble. Our waitress, named Megan, spilled water on our table that ended up wetting my sister. At a nearby table, another server dropped a plate of food on the floor. Regarding our waitress, she seemed very casual, leaning on a chair as she was taking our order."
Nikki G.,"El Monte, CA",119,194,63,4.0,9/6/2013,"Every time I come to a Cheesecake Factory I never know what to Gerti's it just me? Anyways, I always seem to order salads when I do come.  I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.  It was yummy.   The staff was cheerful and pleasant."
Karen H.,"Arcadia, CA",347,97,257,4.0,11/23/2013,Generally pretty good but sometimes the servers don't come back for a while so you just have to wait til they come back again to ask for anything
Anna P.,"Charlotte, NC",190,153,89,4.0,3/3/2013,"It was my 57th birthday when we came here again.  We arrived late but the service was pretty good (has to), match with the class.  We like olive oil instead of butter with our bread.  The first basket was just warm, perhaps like I said, we were late.  We asked for second basket that was much better. The three drinks two cocktails and one non alcohol were not cheaper a totall of $25.- We had a Grilled Salom and a Steak together with Chicken Wrap.  The foods were well prepared.  They were good. We ended up with closed to $90 for three of us.  My children bought a cake from other bakery.  I really enjoyed it.  This was not my everyday deal. Wiith tips, it was over a hundred for this dinner.  I like to share the quality and the price."
Seasonal Y.,"Monrovia, CA",10,25,11,5.0,11/2/2014,"Been here a couple of times for dinner dates with my husband to birthday lunches with the girls, and just for the convenience of it been right by the mall. But this last  time on Columbus day my sister and I and my 8 month baby decide to have this for lunch. We immediately got seated they accommodatited a space since I did walk on with my big ass stroller . A man  by the name of Derrick I believe  that was his  name he was so nice and he even brought cut up banana  and bread for the baby as we waited for our meal that by the way tasted great we both had lunch specials witch by the way is more then enough  we  just had a great experience  with the host I wish I remembered  his name I think he was like a manager  actually  ."
Steph L.,"La Palma, CA",298,22,78,3.0,11/24/2014,"I came on a Sunday night a little before 6 pm.. The wait was actually not bad about 15 min. You would think if we can get seated quickly the service would be pretty good right ? Well the food took forever to come which was first thing that pissed me off . Our waitress did not even come by to check on us or let us know if the food was coming soon after we ordered. Second I have not been to Cheesecake Factory in forever but before I would always order pasta and generally pretty happy with it . This time I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and the pasta was way too soft and over cooked! Maybe if they didn't lag in serving it it would not have been overcooked! So I waited a long time for a sucky $18 pasta.. Great -_- Also it was bland for my taste ( and I had heard good reviews about this one too). My friend orders the basil shrimp pasta thing (I don't know if that's the right name) but that was pretty good! But my review is just based on my experience this time, it was also my first time at this location. So based on this time, I can't say I'll be going back to this one.."
John B.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/22/2016,I would love to give 5 stars because my server was amazing but the host group however was not. A 20min wait for two needed up a 45min to an hour wait. The host seated three parties of two or more who arrived after me. I had to ask where I was on the list and they proceeded to seat me on the patio that was empty the entire time. My servers name was Louis. He was GREAT! Never needed to ask for a refill or more bread he was on it!
Carrie T.,"Monterey Park, CA",165,268,216,3.0,10/13/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is always busy on a weekend for dinner. There was a 30 minute wait for our table of 5. Great service. Waitress was friendly and helpful. I have to say their menu is too long. It literally took me a good 20 minute to decide what i wanted, but In the end I asked for recommendation instead.  Great selection, but as indecisive as I am, it might take some time to decide.  The whole table ordered, what I believed, tasted great. Hibachi steak with wasabi mashed potatoes, Cajun jambalaya pasta, chicken and shrimp gumbo, pasta da Vinci, and chicken piccata(lemon and capers complimented well).  Cheesecake Factory has the yummiest cheesecakes, but I wish they were cheaper, $7.95/slice! I can get a whole pie from Marie calendars for that price! True, they are different in quality and type of dessert...but still in the same category! Desserts!  Nonetheless, great place for causal dinner!"
Christina V.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",35,39,23,1.0,6/10/2015,"I called in to try to make reservations & the receptionist cut me off told me they don't take any, then I told her thank you & she just hung up & didn't say a word to me. So rude! I planned to bring a big party here for dinner and now I'm not. Imagine how they would treat us if we were there. Imagine how the food would be. Disappointed!"
Sophia Y.,"Rosemead, CA",26,4,1,2.0,1/2/2015,"Overall, the service (of all the other staffs besides of my server) was great and i really actually enjoyed my meal. I understand that it was a bit busy, but when you see other servers walking around nonstop, you sort of start to wonder where your server went. First, she offered us something to drink as every server would, but after that, she disappeared completely. I was done with my meal and was waiting on her to come back so that i could ask her for dessert, but she  never arrived. She literally never returned and i ended up having a new server. I did tip, but only because my new server did a get job because by that time, i was beyond angry. I hope the tip did not go to my first server."
Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,3,5.0,2/1/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant. I love the Bread and most definitely love the Alfredo Fettuccine with chicken. Pricey, but worth it."
Jackson W.,"Arcadia, CA",230,68,3,4.0,9/12/2013,"Good Food, Great Service. Last time I went here I had a great server. I came here with a friend and for dessert we got some strawberry thing and it was terrible. Remember to get the Cheesecake people. Don't get fancy."
