Nicole V.,"Arcadia, CA",2,1,,4.0,9/5/2014,"Service was okay except for the fact that we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check and then another 20 minutes for them to collect the check. Cute staff, terrible at waiting."
John S.,"Redlands, CA",1399,536,36,3.0,7/24/2012,"I've gotta hand it to the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food is always the same no matter which location you decide upon.  While that might not necessarily be a good thing, that consistency is sometimes the only thing you can hang your hat on at night.  After having been employed at a similar casual dining chain, I dine at Cheesecake maybe once or twice a year, but it was fast, efficient and as stated before, the food tasted exactly like I expected. Also, props to the company for figuring out how to target the biggest range of demographics possible.  As with other locations, I saw a huge swath of diners at the restaurant.  It's like rich people eat there like $15.95 lunch entrees are nothin', while broke ass people go to Cheesecake Factory for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries and parole dates of felonious relatives."
Karlin C.,"Arcadia, CA",3,76,14,5.0,1/6/2015,"Wow, I have got to say that this food is amazing! A little expensive, but it's worth it! I like to get butter pasta topped off with fresh cheese(in your face refridgerated cheese!)all the time and it is delicious! I have tried the cheesecake before and it is outstanding! I love coming here and when I do, I'm excited! Expect the best because that is what you'll get!"
Brittni R.,"Azusa, CA",3,2,,1.0,1/4/2015,"Ordered takeout late tonight.. And Angela rudely checked the time just so she could mention that the restaurant closed in 10 mins. Sorry that I was looking forward to one of my favorite meals, that I could only get from cheesecake, after a long day and could only make it right before closing.. But there was no need for her attitude. Guests' needs first, and you should always be kind to guests no matter how tired you are. Also, the host stand was just talking behind their post, instead of acknowledging guests. Very unprofessional. Didn't feel welcome at all."
Nicole G.,"Las Vegas, NV",755,454,410,4.0,4/25/2011,"Well the first thing im gonna say is this isn't called the cheesecake factory for their salads, lmao.. so when you come here get the cheesecake!  All of them are good, so take a wild pick, cause theres easily 25 different kind of cheesecake. I know, how to make a decision?! The menu here is just way too big, but that makes it easier when your in the mood for something specific. I've tried the burgers. theyre okay. the salads are huge.  the fish tacos are very good for it not being a fish place. My favorite entree would have tot be theyre pastas. oh my are they delish. Especially the alfredo chicken. Mmm, mmm good. Easily two people can finish one entree. My favorite app would be the fried mac n cheese. Get it! I could eat those everyday. Too bad they are a heart attack on a plate. Always iven great service, but theres something always missing. maybe the waitresses dont give it that extra umph, or aren't warm enough.. im not too sure but i always leave satisfied food wise but not service wise. Its a beautiful building, that has tons of seating. Coming here on a weekend night, expect to wait 45 minutes or longer."
Kuohao Z.,"Alhambra, CA",0,10,6,4.0,1/29/2015,"I like the pineapple mojito there, the service is good and I enjoy the environment there but the food is not my style:)"
Andy H.,"Pasadena, CA",8,37,,1.0,5/20/2014,"The service was pretty bad when we were here to celebrate our daughter's birthday. The waitress would deliberately ignore us when we tried to flag her down, and her attitude left a lot to be desired. The food was good, but it wasn't enjoyable because of the poor service at this restaurant."
Ly J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/15/2015,"usually when i come here, everything is great. however, today my wife and i came for lunch and our experience was less than satisfactory so much so that i feel the need to write a review. we werent given a waiter/waitress to help serve us 15 minutes. we observed that the waiter in the area was actually debating who to choose to serve us. when Someone finally came to take our order we took care to order all of our meal at Once in case they would take longer to get our meal order. we waited patiently for 15 minutes only for the manager to come out that our order was made wrong. when our food came another 15 minutes it came cold. i wont take the time to write my opinion. by now yall should understand what i was feeling but form your own opinion of this matter. im just sharing what happened"
Grace C.,"Orange County, CA",167,129,6,3.0,9/15/2014,"3 stars for food.. Two stars taken down for service. Service was okay as the food and drink were refilled once. After that, it was hard to get a hold of our server.  It was a Thursday at around 3-4 pm. The place was dead. The bf and I were trying to get a box and the check. However all the servers decided to hang out in one spot and chit chat amongst each other.  My bf sat there with his hand up for awhile and a random chatty server made eye contact with him but decided to ignore him. I finally got a random someone to get us boxes and that's when my bf asked him for the manager. This random employee walked by the chatty group of servers and said something to them, and then they decided to disperse. Their employees are unprofessional and lazy. I have worked as a server before and this is not acceptable."
Lea N.,"Duarte, CA",155,171,146,5.0,10/26/2010,"Another review on my favorite restaurant ever...I love eating here because the food is always consistent and never lets me down =)  Among my favorites: Miso Salmon, Pasta Da Vinci and Bang Bang Chicken-all are superb and highly recommended.  Today my co-worker (you're awesome Priscilla!) brought us back two cheesecakes: Pumpkin and Red Velvet Cheesescake. Insanely delicious! I preferred the red velvet over the pumpkin because it actually had cake in between the cheesecake fillings-sooooo good! If you're counting calories, you can skip dessert, but they also have a weight management portion of the menu that contains salads under 590 calories. Still by far, my #1 choice of where to eat."
Susie N.,"Huntington Park, CA",1,19,2,5.0,7/28/2014,I went there for dinner last night with my boyfriend after our trip to Raging Waters. The food was DELICIOUS and our waiter provided us with excellent customer service! I ordered the Shrimp scampi & salmon and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. 2 thumbs up.. thanks for the great time!
Pancho V.,"Los Angeles, CA",509,1197,8631,5.0,5/14/2010,"BUSTED, Yeah Mi Jefa BUSTED me, if you are following my reviews I was at the ""HGC"" earlier today with a friend when I should have been doing other things and I got busted by my wife, and she told me don't come home unless you bring me cheesecake!. Cheesecake, where am I going to get Cheesecake?, Sam's Club or Costco? No lines too long, Smart & Final? No they are Frozen how's she going to eat it?, Ahh Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena, NO parking sucks, I'll just go to Marie Callenders so I'm headed out Huntington Dr. approaching Santa Anita mall and I happened to look over and see a sign ""The Cheesecake Factory"" Oh how you just saved me!. Wow the selection of different Cheesecakes where do you even start and how do you just choose one? so instead of one whole cheesecake at $45 - $50,  I chose three slices as follows. Dutch Apple Streusel Cheesecake - $6.95 per slice,     Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - $6.95 per slice,      Red Velvet Cheesecake - $7.50 per slice,     My Wife said her favorite was the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, which should be no surprise to me as she's a Pineapple freak!, I thought they were all outstandingly good but would lean towards the Dutch Apple as being the best with the apples, the crumble topping and cheesecake. Life is not fair, WHY is something so good, so bad?!! Based on the Cheesecake ONLY 5-Stars hands down. :)"
M. A. T.,"Monrovia, CA",0,11,1,5.0,2/9/2015,"MOBILITY DISABILITY FRIENDLY! It's hard to find restaurants that are aware of and easily accommodate those with disabilities. My husband uses assistive mobility devices. Each time we've visited this restaurant, the staff have been friendly and accommodating to our needs (e.g the don't rush on the way to the table, easily make accommodations if my husband is using his electric mobility device, etc.) In addition to the accommodations, though I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, the food here is exceptional. No ""so-so"" dishes - all have been great! Of course, there are the cheesecakes, but the Kobe Burger is incredible - and it's cooked perfectly to order. AWESOME STAFF! Justine, Justine, Cody! Best servers! All of the staff are personable but we have had the pleasure each time we visited to have the gracious service of one of those three staff.  Manager take note: they deserve public note of their great service and I'm sure you are proud to have them on staff. As my husband says, ""They made even a casual lunch a pleasant dining experience!"""
Amy L.,"Rosemead, CA",4,77,9,5.0,9/7/2013,"Atmosphere:  perfect night sitting outside on the patio...cool breeze.  Decor is not bad.   Price:  vegetable salad with chicken ($12.95) - under 590 calories.  Shrimp Gumbo ($16.95) - requested no sausage & chicken.  Complimentary bread - love the honey oak wheat bread    .  The bread is warm and fresh.  Quality:  the bread is warm and fresh.  I really like the honey oak wheat bread.   Vegetable salad tastes really delicious.   Shrimp gumbo tastes a bit spicy but extremely good at the same time. Service:  Friday night arrived at the resturant around 8:30 - 10 minute wait.  Awesome!  Server is attentive through out the night.    Overall, I had a great experience at this location.  It is my third time dining at this location, and I haven't experienced a bad moment with the service and quality of the food."
Louie V.,"Arcadia, CA",158,1,2,4.0,2/3/2014,The experience here was great. I had a few drinks at the bar and had lunch there aswell. The drinks were very delicious (I recommend the strawberry  daiquiri). The food was delivered on time and fast and the service is great. I worked at a restaurant and bar so my expectations are high when I eat out. Cheesecake Factory in Santa Anita mall met mine.
Raquel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,500,313,4.0,9/8/2012,"Cheesecake factory is always good! Had a mojito and a Mai Thai and shared an appetizer with my BFF. We had the spinach artichoke dip, the dip wasn't the best thing on the menu, needed salt. Nevertheless, the drinks and company was great,"
Charlene N.,"El Monte, CA",94,26,15,5.0,6/2/2014,This is my favorite restaurant to go to. They have a variety of dishes to choose from so if you have a large party you can't go wrong. The service is always excellent and always have real good experience here. The ambiance is also very inviting and fun. My kids love it here.
Kevin A.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",10,99,,4.0,11/27/2014,My wife and I had a lunch at this CF recently and enjoyed our meal. We were seated right away by a friendly hostess. We ordered off the Skinnylicous Menu which looked ok. The portions were smaller than normal hence the menu name. Chicken salad sandwich was good and also ordered the chopped salad. Both were the right amount of portions. The complimentary bread basket was delish! Never had a bad meal at this location. We will be back.
David C.,"La Puente, CA",3,43,18,5.0,7/6/2014,"Had a bad experience previously, but our server, Lee more than made up for it.  He was very attentive and friendly.  One of the best dinning experiences I've had.  Miso salmon was delicious and the sweet potato fries were very tasty especially with the dipping sauce that came with them.  Also, came in at around 2:30pm and there was no crowd at all."
E. D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/20/2014,"Unhappy. Completely unsatisfied about their customer service. I took my best friend for his birthday that happens to be tomorrow because we have tight schedules. The waitress fully ignored the fact. No welcoming, no special, no deal offered or detailed. Cold customer service and it was our first time at this place we highly doubt we come back. I left a note on the receipt hoping at least she or management improves their customer service skills."
