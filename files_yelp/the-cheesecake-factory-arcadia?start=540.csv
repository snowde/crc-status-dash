Charles P.,"Pasadena, CA",65,27,11,1.0,9/8/2014,"Service was horrible on my visit here for a Sunday brunch. I literally got the table in the very corner in the bar area. We were checked on no more than 3 times which is not enough and very frustrating. I didn't know what to order at first so she said she'll be right back. Being right back doesn't mean 15 minutes. The complimentary bread didn't come until our food came while compared to the other customers around, they got bread right away. What's up with that? I guess that's what we get for being in the CORNER. Plus, I didn't get a refill for my drink because everyone was passing by my party and I so quick that we couldn't flag anyone down for any service. Overall, the service and experience was horrible. Thanks for the bad service Justine. Makes me want to go drive to the old town Pasadena location to avoid this establishment."
Andrew F.,"Arcadia, CA",118,24,8,4.0,6/5/2013,"I know it's a chain, but this is really hard to beat.  If you go on a day without a crazy wait, where else can you get beautiful ambiance, professional staff, huge portions, and good food?   Lately, I go with my mom and sister and we just order 2 dishes to share among the three of us.  The free toasted bread is very good.  And all this only ends up being about $30.  You can't really compete with the quality, portions, ambiance and service at $10 per person. My favorite dish is Chicken Bellagio.  I kind of stopped trying other dishes and just stick to this."
Miguel E.,"Arcadia, CA",37,3,2,2.0,3/31/2014,"The food was good, but the service was bad! When my girlfriend and I walked in we didn't even get acknowledged. We said hi to the hostess and she just had a blank stare. Our server Daryl rarely said anything and he was gone most of the time. We saw him about 4 times throughout an hour span. It felt as the server and hostess didn't realize we arrived and left. I would go back to The Cheesecake Factory, just not this location."
Jared C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,11,3,4.0,1/4/2015,"This place is fantastic for a little more upscale dining with great food. Service is prompt, the food is delicious."
Erik H.,"Arcadia, CA",20,12,10,5.0,1/20/2015,"Love cheesecake. Never had any problems with any location of The Cheesecake Factory. I just wish it was shorter wait times on the weekends, but it's worth the wait. Try out the lemon meringue cheesecake; it very good. Aside from that; the waiters and host are very quick and curtious. They explain the menu in detail for items not familiar with. Food is great. Place is very clean. I will be coming back."
Kelsey W.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,227,18,2.0,12/23/2012,"This review is mostly for the service. I completely forgot our waitress' name, but that's to her benefit. Some of the things she said and did just stopped me dead in my tracks. For instance, at the end of our meal, when plates are emptied - her: ""Can I take some of these plates for you?"" Us: ""Yes, please"" *nods*, etc. She proceeds to just hold our her hand, insinuating for us to put our dirty plates in her hand. Can she not bend over two feet and grab that plate from the table herself? Ugh. Seriously woman? Laziest waitress I have ever seen. Also, the food was heavy heavy heavy. I felt sick to my stomach after eating only half a plate of the pasta marinara - typically a light, fresh dish. My friend said it looked like something we would slap together on a dime in college - not a good sign. Also, and maybe this is a testament to this particular location, but it was not bustling nor busy, like other Cheesecake Factory locations on a Saturday night."
Scott C.,"Elk Grove, CA",115,22,4,1.0,9/1/2015,"More and more I'm seeing restaurants jack up the prices and give less food for it. On 8/31/2015 we went  to the Arcadia Cheesecake Factory for dinner and I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. I chose the salad over the fries. I asked if I can have iceberg lettuce instead of the typical bitter lettuce they serve. The waitress brought a very small bowl of just iceberg lettuce. No cucumber, no tomato, no croutons, or anything else! To top it off, I noticed the very, very small sandwich on my plate. We're talking Mac Donald's small cheeseburger size with a little bit of meat and onions, and a small 1oz saucer of the dip. I'm not kidding. I've had roast beef sandwiches, but this was a joke. I wish I was joking for paying $14!  I informed the waitress that this was not at all what I was expecting.  She said well our normal greens come with the vegetables you want, but you ordered iceberg sir. Yes, I replied, I asked for a iceberg ""Salad"". Not a small bowl for a turtle to feed off of lettuce only. Wow! The manager delivered the same size bowl of lettuce with the addition of vegetables this time. I informed him right off that I was not trying to be rude, but for $14 this was a very small portion of food. The manager had a smug look on his face acting like this was actually normal. He was NOT apologetic and asked if there was something else I wanted. I said no thank you, and told him that I was giving feedback only. Now I know it's not the manager's fault, and not the waitresses fault regarding the serving of food we get. But the fact that the waitress got smart and brought me iceberg lettuce only, with the addition of the manger's smug attitude. We're talking triple FAIL at this Cheesecake Factory. NO THANK YOU...NOT AGAIN!"
Jen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,69,7,2.0,8/31/2014,"It took a long time to get my drink. Waiting to order food, waiting for more bread, waiting for the food, everything took a loooong time. I ordered a veggie burger with fries. 15 minutes later, the waitress came back and said that the veggie burger doesn't come with fries. I asked for a menu. The top of the burger page said ""all burgers are served with fries"". When the waitress came back 10 minutes later, I showed her the menu and she said ""Oh, I guess it does come with fries"". She said ""the other veggie burger doesn't come with fries"". I used a gift card and asked if I could put the tip on the gift card. She said that I could not. I didn't have enough dollar bills to leave 15%, so I had to leave two one-dollar bills and a lot of change, because I was not going to wait another 10 minutes."
Barbara G.,"El Segundo, CA",2,80,56,5.0,12/18/2014,We had a small group lunch here (6 coworkers) and had a great time.  Our server was Anthony who did a great job (somebody give him a high five!).  Food came out quick and accurate and our server was attentive and prompt.  No wonder this place is so popular!  By the time we were leaving there was a line out the door!  (Tip - get there early like we did; 11 am!)
Erica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",598,245,1506,1.0,1/30/2012,"Curse me for succumbing to a free meal, thinking it'd be a good -- nay, decent -- meal.  My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory based on the fact that we'd accumulated $100 in gift cards, and thought, ""Might as well use it!""  Neither of us had been to a Cheesecake Factory since our college days, and we were about to get a swift kick in the pants of *why*. WAIT SERVICE: We walked into this cavernous restaurant, and wondered who decorated the interiors.  Utterly garish and gauche, the interiors reeked of McMansion.  We were quickly seated by front of house, and our waiter, after a brief introduction, the general fetching of water, and taking of our order, told us he was going on his 30 minute break.  We had previously joked that there was so much choice in the menu (indeed it reads like a small book), so I innocently asked, ""And what will you be eating on your break?""  Initially jovial and casual in attitude, he quickly replied, ""In and Out,"" followed by a short, stiff bark of a laugh.  Um, OK...  He then introduced his substitute waiter, who's name escapes me, but whose manner turned out to be utterly annoying.  He didn't win any favors when he made a completely unprofessional and racist comment right off the bat.  Then he proceeded to check in on us and our meal TOO often, with a smiling, obsequious, over-compensating manner that just made me want to reach out and slap him (I did not, for fear he'd spit in our food).    When it came down to the ordering of dessert time, he told us to ""take our time,"" and then never returned to take our order.  WTF?  First TOO much checking in, then leaving us in the cold?  Seriously un-smooth.  Our original waiter finally returned and by then, we weren't at all appetized for dessert, having been turned off from the wait service in general, choosing instead to order dessert to-go.   FOOD: We decided, since we weren't famished, we'd order several appetizers, share a salad, and indulge in Cheesecake Factory's dessert.  After all, that's what they're known for, right?  As pescatarians, the choices are slim.  We ordered: Stuffed Mushrooms, Pear and Brie Flatbread, and Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip, plus a Seared Tuna Salad.  Sounds pretty good right?  In reality: completely under-whelming.  The mushrooms were OK, the Flatbread decent, but the Crab and Artichoke Dip was just plain gross.  Have you ever had a cheap, warm tub of seafood-flavored mayonnaise?  Yes, that's what makes this dip so overly-rich, and undigestible.  Note to the Head Chef: there are other food seasonings other than fat. The salad was OK, but surprisingly, wasn't large in portion, so the both of us ended up hungry, and unsatisfied (for $53, that's leaves a lot to be desired).  As for dessert, by the time I got my Oreo cookies 'n cream milkshake and slice of Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake in my hands, my stomach was doing flips from the crab dip.  I felt nauseated, and couldn't wait to get home to nurse my tummy with peppermint tea.   It's not that the food's inedible.  It's just that it's wanna-be good food, and not prepared with much love.  Cheesecake Factory might appear ""successful"" since its a chain, and it's known for its huge portions, however, more does not necessarily mean better.  I now remember why I never returned to this place after my one experience during college, and even though we still have remaining credit on our gift card, after looking through CF's menu and last night's dining experience, there's nothing remotely enticing about this place or its food that I'd return to order."
ward s.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2014,"Came for dinner, ordered shrimp scampi with steak Diane and asked for a steak knife when my order arrived, 20 minutes later our waitress came to check on us and again I asked for a steak knife so I could now eat my now cold steak. My wife ordered the garlic noodles and there was no garlic in it, I love garlic and only tasted salt so when we asked how much garlic they use we were told that they go LIGHT on sauces. We explained that there was no garlic at all and we were offered garlic to pour over the noodles, They did take off the noodle dish off the bill but the service needs help"
Narciso R.,"Bell Gardens, CA",11,1,,2.0,10/10/2015,The host was unpleasant and did not even try to get the table I requested when there were 3 empty tables. I am disappointed because I am a good customer.
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,1.0,3/27/2013,"Aww, shucks. I come here too often due to its convenience in location. However, today was not as good as usual! What happened? I had a ""Slice of Joy"" gift card that granted one slice of complimentary cheesecake that my best friend gave me for Xmas that was expiring, so I nudged my fiance to come here. In addition, I also had a gift card that I used half of that I wanted to finish. Hey, that was a good enough incentive, right? Well, WRONG. First of all, there was a wait on a Wednesday evening! We actually had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table when there were clearly a few tables open! Holy cow. Second of all, the waitress was very inattentive. She took almost 10 minutes to come acknowledge herself. We kept looking around and I kept wondering who our server was! And when she did take our order, and we asked for lemon with our iced water, she forgot it! She was also not very communicative. Third of all, my Bistro Shrimp Pasta has deteriorated in quality! I haven't had it in a while, because I usually order salad at Cheesecake Factory, but today I felt like pasta and it did not deliver. The sauce was too sour (and lemony), and the whole dish was too high in fat and cholesterol content. It just wasn't a good combo. Fiance's salad was not that good as well. He wasn't that excited to eat it. Fourth of all, I got a stomach ache after my dish! It was not pleasant. What happened, Cheesecake Factory? I hope it steps up their game before our next visit. We usually come here a few times a month but today just wasn't good. Fortunately, though, we did bring home a Banana Creme Cheesecake (per our complimentary gift card), so I did get to indulge a little after my stomach ache and aftermath was situated. The one star is for the Banana Creme Cheesecake. It really was amazing. But that was the only amazingness we got out of this trip, unfortunately. Hope our next experience will be better."
Bryce J.,"Pasadena, CA",315,22,4,5.0,10/8/2014,"I live a block away, so I come here with friends and family constantly. The parking is horrible as is the wait times usually, but the service is excellent! My advice is to sit inside. Why? I've noticed service is not nearly as good when you sit outside. The food is FAST to come out and is super consistent. Hands down some of the best drinks you'll have--especially their Long Island iced tea. Bang bang dish is incredible and it's always nice they serve breakfast all day. Their firecracker salmon and avocado egg rolls are amazing as well. And lastly, you can't go wrong with any time of cheesecake you order. Never had bad food or a bad experience here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
Maria B.,"Pasadena, CA",6,49,,2.0,6/27/2016,I went there recently by myself after taking care of my dad all day.  I found a space to sit near the bar area.   I waited but no one even asked me if they could take an order even though about six people passed by me within five minutes...I asked one waitress if they could validate for the valet parking.  I was told that I had to do that myself. I had been there before and always the waiter or waitress would take it with the bill. I had to ask another person if I could order something and was told that the table I was sitting at was not their area...I found them to be rude and uncaring.  Finally after asking for help someone decided they would take my order.  I think these people have little regard for customer service and think that because I was by myself I did not deserve some help.   Customer service is  not always great.  I have once gone there with a friend and asked that the each of us be given separate checks.  Instead the entire check came out to me. I was so tired of deciding who was going to pay what and paid the whole check my self.  Customer service needs great improvement..
Emily C.,"Rosemead, CA",4,8,,2.0,12/4/2014,"I'm beyond disgusted. I went with 3 siblings and our wait time wasn't bad, but we get seated, our waitress was rude, and kept giving me in particular dirty looks whenever I requested something. Then my brothers first ordered drink came, with LIPSTICKS on the rim. We were grossed out and asked for a replacement drink, which they tried charging us for. Then, my sisters knife in her set was dirty. Never coming back. They need to clean their utensils and glasses thoroughly!"
Mei Z.,"Temple City, CA",6,3,4,2.0,10/31/2014,"Food is ok, service is bad, won't come back! Our waitress left during the middle of meal, no one serve us. I have to ask several people before order our dessert."
Angie W.,"Alhambra, CA",1017,600,491,4.0,12/15/2011,"Didn't get to get any cheesecake this time, but had the yummy avocado eggrolls. We ordered a couple of salads to share, ahi tataki & bbq chicken.  Both were good.  I still like the bbq chicken salad at CPK better. Service was good as usual.  Too bad it was too cold to sit outside.  Will be coming back soon!"
Farynn S.,"Azusa, CA",43,44,7,3.0,4/1/2014,Food and staff is great. The wait on the weekends are horrible. Id only go during the less traffic hours. Avoid after 6 if you hate to wait. Parking is a nightmare. Its best to do valet if you come to this location. The outdoor seating is lovely at night.
Steven H.,"El Monte, CA",72,19,6,1.0,8/3/2014,"First of all, this is The Cheesecake Factory, this restaurant chain is so established that no matter what happens, this place will always make money. So here is my review: Horrible! Horrible! Horrible Service. Our waitress was named Erica(and in her defense, she was put in a bad spot with no backup) however, when we are the first customers who ordered and you see her other tables who got there 30 mins later then us and got their meals, then something is wrong and you should complain. Horrible service and the food tasted poor. I told the manager and not even an apology. No one apologized for the error on their part. All I wanted was an apology for the bad service. Service and food was terrible. I'll drive to another Cheesecake Factory to avoid the staff."
