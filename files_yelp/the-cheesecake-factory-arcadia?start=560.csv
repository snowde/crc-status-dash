Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12842,3.0,10/1/2010,"Went here for dinner with my BF.  The place was like a ghost town.  I have never had this experience at any other Cheesecake Factory.  I don't know why or what the phenomena was, but it was bizarre. I got one of their special salads.  I forget the name of the salad, but it had turkey, avocado, beets, bacon and tomatoes.  I ordered it without the egg, cheese and thousand island dressing (who orders TI dressing now-a-days?).  The salad was super yummy.  My BF got the chicken marsala.  It was cooked well with a ton of potatoes and came with asparagus (yum). The service was good and we really had no complaints."
Irene N.,"Rosemead, CA",133,242,30,3.0,9/16/2012,"We came here last night, cause I was craving the wheat break =X ... I would give this place a 3.5. Our waitress was wonderful! Very attentive and got us everything we needed without us having to ask her twice. The food was just average. My burger looked like someone took a triangle piece right out of the patty. And the BF's Shepard's pie was alright."
Mary I.,"Baldwin Park, CA",449,219,600,5.0,1/21/2014,"I love this place! It has always been one of my all time favorite restaurants. In high school I used to come here for dinner before my formal dances. I am always satisfied with their food and the cheesecakes are bomb. The menu gives you more than enough options to choose from. Service can be slow sometimes especially for dinner since this place is so popular and mainly located around shopping malls. There's a bar inside that serves good mixed drinks and you're welcome to eat at the bar too. When you're seated they used to give a small basket of complimentary bread but now I noticed that you have to ask them for it.  For starters, I love soup so I would ask what the soup of the day is (Small $5 Large $7) and so far I like the Wild Mushroom Soup. I usually order the Factory Combination of Steak Diane (med rare) and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus ($20). The steak is full of flavor with pepper and mushrooms. The salmon tastes fresh and moist. The mashed potatoes are buttery and I love the potato skins in there. I know TCF is not the healthiest as it's packed with thousands of calories! However, they do offer a Skinnylicious menu that offers lower calorie items but haven't gotten around to it since I only go here for my usuals. The bf loves pasta and usually orders the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo ($17). It's creamy and the chicken is not bland at all. Lastly, how could you not order dessert at Theee Cheesecake factory. I've tried numerous cheesecakes here (about $7 a piece) and I can't remember all of them but the most recent I've had is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and The White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake (ain't that a mouth full!). Both are really good! The bf is a little traditional (and boring, jk!) and sticks to the Original New York Cheesecake. But any type of cheesecake is divine to me!"
Kristine P.,"Azusa, CA",187,20,1,3.0,3/5/2014,Its okay.. there's a lot of people and it's kinda loud.  The food is okay. I ordered the garlic noodles  it's not good. I wouldn't order it ever again. I didn't even finish it I took it home and end up throwing it away.
Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207,4.0,9/8/2010,"Our waitress was very nice to us. She was very prompt and provided us with great service. Today, I ordered the lunch special pizza and soup. Yeah that's right, soup! I substituted the salad for soup. To start off, they bring you bread. The bread was piping warm and delicious with their mouthwatering butter. You know, eating most of the bread made me and my friend quite full. Then, per our request, the soup came out first. After the soup, I was really full. Then our pizza came out. I could barely eat the pizza (it is the ""everything"" pizza with all the fixings. Cheesecake factory is always very generous with their portions so expect to bring some food home. The waitress made our dining experience a nice one today."
Carrey W.,"Livingston, NJ",63,106,94,4.0,7/15/2012,"I know it's kind of pointless to review a chain restaurant, they are pretty much the same.  But I've always had excellent service at the Arcadia location, and never really waited too long for a table.  We've been to this location with friends in wheelchairs, and also babies in strollers, and they've been very accommodating.  That's why this place stands out for me!"
Damaris H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",2,11,7,5.0,1/11/2014,Very good lunch size pizza and Caesar salad. The prices are very good for the quality of food. The fried mac and cheese is really good!!
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,3.0,8/20/2012,"The waiting was average on a Saturday afternoon. The service was a little slow. The herb crusted salmon was really good. The Tropical smoothie was also good. The ""Oreo Dream Extreme"" was too extreme on the chocolate for me. I am willing to still eat here."
Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",471,650,10,4.0,1/15/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory never really disappoints whenever I come here. The food here is not superb, but they have quite a selection most of which is of high quality. I think the prices here match what they give you, especially since the portions here are pretty huge.  FOOD QUALITY: Of all the food that I've ordered here, they all come in big sizes and there is a certain richness to every item.  Factory Meatloaf is one thing that I usually get -- there's three slices of meatloaf, served with gravy, grilled onions and mushrooms. Alongside that are slightly buttered mash potatoes and peppered corn & bell pepper bits. Meatloaf is soft and full of flavor. Mash potato melts in your mouth and helps break down the meatloaf bits, while the corn gives you a slight crunch from the plumpness. Pastas are usually not a letdown since they do slightly different things that you would not normally find in a restaurant (unless you order the basic things.. which I avoid) Louisana Chicken was one of my recent discoveries and that was delicious! Cajun style bowtie pasta with flaky fried chicken. Pasta cooked to perfection and the flakiness from the chicken definitely added a lovely subtle texture of crunch into the pasta. Flavors were strong, but was definitely oily. Other pastas are pretty good (Farfalle and the chipotle liguini are the two others that I tried) Fish and Chips were pretty good too, but not the best I've had.  Marsala Chicken was also good, but there was a lot of bowtie pasta that came along with that.  SERVICE: Is usually friendly, polite, and attentive. They offer to refill your waters, oblige to give you more bread, and sometimes the manager comes around to see how the service is. One time we commented that our food was late and they gave us a free cheesecake for dessert.. D: ENVIRONMENT: This is a huge place. There are a lot of tables so I don't think I've ever felt that my personal bubble space was violated. I hear this place gets crowded but I usually come here right as they open for lunch or early for dinner crowd.  I like coming here and this is a certainly a place that I'd suggest if I had to eat around the area. Good food. Oh wait. I forgot to comment about the Cheesecake here. YUUUUUUUMMMMM! Rich. Though I probably wouldn't get one right after I eat here since they give so much food."
Anni K.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",3,26,2,4.0,4/10/2014,"This is my I don't know where to eat restaurant! But their food is always great! Services depends, I've had really good experiences and some bad ones too. Make sure to try the stuffed mushrooms and texmex egg rolls! You won't be disappointed !"
Lesley M.,"Monrovia, CA",47,146,17,5.0,9/8/2012,FIVE STAR HAPPYHOUR Lots of tasty $5 menu options. It costs us $15 (plus the price of drinks) to get STUFFED. When you take into consideration the normal menu prices here this is one of the best deals in town!!!! some of my happy hour faves include:  -sweet corn tamales -mini sliders -buffalo blasts -stuffed mushrooms -taquitos
Amy F.,"Castro Valley, CA",49,24,33,5.0,5/26/2014,"I always order the Chicken Di Pana! Omgosh, I'm drooling right now!! It's Parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes & broccoli. The chicken has a lemony sauce to it so if you don't like lemon don't get it. It isn't over powering at all. I love this dish so much. It's my go too!!"
Joshua O.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,60,1,5.0,11/20/2012,"Great selection and great food so far.  I have eaten here probably a dozen times in the past 12 months and I have not eaten anything that wasn't good so far, I'm also the type of person that orders something different on each visit.  If you like having several different kinds of bites then the small menu and starters are the way to go.  They also have a wide variety of drinks.  I don't think I have to go into their deserts... I mean if you have to ask then you have been living under a rock or you're lactose intolerant. Parking here can be a pain in the @ss on weekend nights.  They have a large parking structure on the backside of the restaurant but it is usually packed by everyone that is trying to get into the AMC movie theatre.  They have a valet service available right in front of the restaurant but keep in mind that this valet also serves the entire mall, so they do get busy.  Also anytime you use the valet service please at least tip the valet at least a couple of bucks for running through the parking lot to get your car back.  If you don't mind a little walk the second floor of the small parking structure on the south east side of the mall usually has open spots for the dinner/movie festivities, but during the day it is as full as any where else you decide to go."
Alison M.,"Monrovia, CA",85,12,21,1.0,11/26/2013,"I can honestly say everytime you have to guess if you'll get good service here or not.  First of the boodly Mary's were not filled up all the way, and they are seriously slow, and we just sat down!!! Really? ?"
Tricia D.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,22,,1.0,9/20/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory on Saturday, 9/19/2015 around 10 PM. The women's bathroom was almost devoid of toilet paper in every one of the five stalls. The paper towels were overflowing from the garbage bin and the paper towel dispenser closest to the door was empty. The seat covers were out in at least one of the stalls. I was told by our waitress that there is usually a female hostess on duty who can check the women's bathroom, but one wasn't scheduled that night. I spoke to the manager about it. He apologized, but didn't do anything about to remedy the situation. Fifteen minutes later, I went to see if anything had been done and it hadn't. There's no excuse for how neglected the bathroom was. Very poor management. I won't be going back."
Janet M.,"Temple City, CA",49,180,306,4.0,1/3/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has been my favorite place! Let me tell you my favorite dishes: 1) Bistro Shrimp (with Angel Hair!!!!) (it comes with creamy sauce and mustroom)  2) Fried Calamari (very yum, I love their garlic sauce, I always ask for more) 3) Baked Potato Soup (only for Wednesday, really delicious) 4) Cream Chicken soup (only for Saturday, my favor) 5) Avocado eggrolls (eat with the garlic sauce from fried calamari) 6) Miso Salmon (this is my friend's favor, to me, I feel like it's just a simple salmon steak) Their wheat breads are complimentary and they are warm and YUM. The price is okay comparing to other American type of foods.  I usually don't have to wait for this location.  So if you are in the SG valley area, go to this one instead of the Pasadena where you will wait a long time for your table!"
Lisa O.,"Monterey Park, CA",178,37,6,2.0,5/7/2012,"terrible service. I came here at around 9:45 pm on a Sunday. I went up to the waiter and asked if I would still be able to get ""to-go"" and she says yes and hands me a menu.. with NO warning that they close in 15 minutes. (THANKS ALOT!) I assumed this place would close at 11 since other CF close at 11pm (Pasadena? Glendale?) After trying to decide what to eat, another waiter comes up and says ""our kitchen is closed, I should've told you earlier"" So WTF? You stood there watching us decide for 10-15 minutes only to tell us after you close? There is never anything wrong with the food. But the service is just terrible. I am never coming back to this location. To the dumb worker: instead of looking at my boyfriend and saying ""Hey! You're _____ right? I know you!"" We're here as CUSTOMERS, not FRIENDS. Because if you were a FRIEND, you'd tell us you're closing, not WATCH us waste our time."
C W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,2,5.0,1/4/2013,"I suppose it's up to me to defend the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but they make really good food. I rarely actually eat their cheesecakes, but their Crabcake Sandwich is surprisingly good, their avocado egg rolls are great, and I used to LOVE their beef ribs (before they took it off the menu a few years ago). But really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The service is average, and the prices are average too. If you're visiting the mall, this is a nice place to drop by."
Joshua C.,"West Hills, CA",114,38,5,2.0,5/19/2014,As much as I love to get my dessert from here I was super disappointed tonight. Not only is a slice of cheesecake almost $9 but the slice they have me tonight was SUPER SMALL.... Really sucks!
Raven V.,"Arcadia, CA",42,2,,5.0,5/20/2012,"To be honest I come here to get drinks and seafood.  Each time I go, they never fail to please me. Ahi Tuna Tartare:  It's a small dish.  But totally excellent.  If you like avocado, raw Ahi Tuna, and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce, you'll love this.  I'm not entirely sure what the cracker/chip-like item is that they give to you to eat it with, but it definitely adds excellent texture to the dish. Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad:  This salad is just brilliant.  The person who made it should have a statue erected in his honor.  The mixture of leafy greens and the sauce with a bit of avocado and the thick pieces of seared Tuna together make this a perfect dish.  I won't lie, it's a bit spicy, but hey, doesn't make it any less delicious.  The salad is a bit pricey as well, but I'm not complaining. Ravenswood Zinfandel:  My taste for it is still developing in terms of identifying and being able to pair good wines with food.  However, I can sometimes pair up a pretty good wine with a pretty good dish.  For example, the Ravenswood Zinfandel actually compliments the Tuna quite nicely. Blueberry Mojito:  Mint, Blueberries, Booze.  Enough said (it's really good).  I wasn't expecting miracles or a glass of Amy Winehouse's blood (too much?) or anything, but this stuff came pretty close. In terms of the service, usually whenever I go there, the service is pretty good.  Really the trick to getting decent service in any restaurant is to sit somewhere where your server goes by frequently.  Or just be human to them and they may tend to notice you a bit more.  In some cases, I've gotten a little chatty with my server and they've apologized in advance for not swinging by frequently enough because it was so busy.  Long story short:  Don't go to a restaurant with an attitude."
