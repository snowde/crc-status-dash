Christine K.,"Alhambra, CA",127,59,151,4.0,7/31/2012,"In honor of the Olympics and being from England, I ordered a shepherd's pie. The portion was huge! I think it will take me 3 days to finish it! I loved every component of the dish including the ground beef, mashed potatoes, mushrooms and carrots. It was the best comfort food I had in a long time. Also, I highly recommend the strawberry lemonade. I always try to talk myself out of ordering it because of the price but I end up ordering it anyway. :) It's sweet and tangy and I love the sugar around the glass."
Randy N.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,3,5.0,9/21/2014,"Ate here this evening with family.  It was a large order during a busy time.  The kitchen had a problem getting everything out in sync, so we spoke to Ryan, the manager on duty, about it.  He and Amanda, our server, immediately fixed the issues and wound up ""comping"" a couple of our items.  We so appreciated the great service, and the financial consideration!  This is what good service is all about!  The food was delicious, too.  We'll be back, for sure.  Thanks, Ryan and Amanda!"
Lish H.,"Chino Hills, CA",134,352,2033,3.0,6/22/2012,"It's just typical Cheesecake. They have better menu though, comparing to before. It's called Skinnylicious Menu. Service is nice, nothing is spectacular."
A H.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,73,51,4.0,11/8/2011,"I've always had a great experience when I go to Cheesecake Factory. I love the food and the service. The only problem I have is the lighting. I hate how it's dark, but I guess that's how they put a comforting atmosphere.  I always look forward to the Red Velvet Cheesecake or the Banana Cheesecake."
Joseph S.,"Newport Beach, CA",85,199,27,4.0,5/20/2014,"Came here for lunch to meet some family. Anticipated that it would be to the same standards as the many other CCF that I have visited numerous times. I was correct.  Friendly staff, and food prepared to my expectations."
Gary L.,"San Gabriel, CA",256,628,19,4.0,9/26/2009,"I came on a Friday night at about 8PM or so and it was only a 5 minute wait. Surprising! Also, I saw that one slice of their cheesecakes has over 1200+ calories! Wow! Okay, back on topic. On this visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory, I got to try the Sangria with white wine, the Pasta Da Vinci, and the Chinese Chicken Salad. I've never had Sangria with white wine before and it wasn't bad.  It wasted a little bitter but it is probably because of the fruit that is in it.  I think it tastes like grapefruit juice.  It wasn't very strong either.  I didn't really feel it in my face and I'm a lightweight!  Whether or not my face got red, that's a different story. Pasta Da Vinci.  No relation to Leonardo. (stupid joke).  The penne pasta was an okay combination with the rest of the ingredients.  I prefer long pasta, like angel hair or spaghetti, but penne works alright.  It came with cup up chicken breast and button mushrooms.  The mushrooms were probably my favorite part of the dish.  The size was adequate.  Not too much and not too little. Chinese Chicken Salad.  It tasted similar to the salad you'd find at Souplantation, at least the dressing.  The portion is pretty large and I figure if you're one person eating all of it, you'll get sick of it before you can finish all of it.  But if two people share it, it'd make a good size as an appetizer.  The dressing wasn't too sweet but if you order dressing on the side and pour it on, well, then it gets a bit sweet, but still good! The service wasn't as great as what I experienced at the Cheesecake Factory at Americana.  I think during the entire dinner, the guy only checked in on us 2 or 3 times.  But the guy was busy anyway with a lot of tables to cover.  Four stars."
Katy Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,660,512,4.0,6/22/2012,"I've been here a few times and many times for cheesecake takeouts. What can I say?  Service has always been great regardless if I come here on a date with hubby or a group setting with my girlfriends. They're really good with refilling drinks. Food is consistently good. I normally order pasta but this past wednesday, I ordered filet mignon with mashed potatoes. The only thing I have to complain about is that the middle of the mashed potatoes isn't fully mashed enough. A bit chunky but not a huge deal breaker! My husband ordered pork chop and it came with sides of mashed potatoes, spinach, and apple sauce. Interesting combo and it worked! I've tried the following cheesecakes over the yrs: Tiramisu cheesecake - Skip it! Perhaps i got it on a bad day but it wasn't even in the form of a slice of cake. It was just a glob! Didn't taste good to me at all and i'm a huuuuge fan of tiramisu Original cheesecake w/fresh strawberries- the best by far! Raspberry cheesecake w/white chocolate- the dark crust makes it too sweet Blueberry cheesecake w/white chocholate- reg crust which is better but the white chocolate inside the cheesecake makes it too sweet."
Elton H.,"Arcadia, CA",171,29,3,3.0,10/4/2012,I eat here often because its just so convenient. They dont take reservations so mostly you'll have to wait when you get there.  Place is a little dark. A little hard to see the menu at night. Floor is really slippery. Almost fell numerous times. I love the sunrise fiesta burrito. Absolutely delicious. Four cheese penne is really good too. The service can be terrible. Ive had great servers and absolutely horrendous ones. Really depends on your luck. Only once did they run out of wheat bread. Service can be slow. Also seem to mess up orders easily.
Sara A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,31,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Ok, today we decided to give Cheesecake Factory another chance because my husband and I had our first date there 10 years ago and I go go to the Arcadia  mall with my kids if not every week, then every other week for sure. Long story short went for lunch to CF this afternoon, it took them 20 min to bring us bread and our water, another 40 min to serve us wrong order, my son asked for chicken sliders with fries no salt, they served beef patties and fries with a lot of salt, my other kid asked for grilled salmon, that fish was not grilled it was fried, sooo greasy and dry my kid couldn't eat it. So sad, I called and spoke with the manager on duty, he was so disrespectful, instead of apologizing, gave me a nasty attitude, said ""why are you calling three hours later when it was dine in order?"", well because I had to wait for an hour and my kids were late to their swimming lesson, I had to go and took everything to go. My waiter was missing in action, I had to ask another waiter for my check. No bread, no drink refill. What a disappointing experience again."
Sandy M.,"South El Monte, CA",0,1,2,1.0,1/6/2015,The service here was horrible. Working at a restaurant myself I was not satisfied with the service that they provided. The server was rude and looked like she hated her job. I shouldn't have tipped her the amount I did. Totally not worth the money spent !!!
Mr. F.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",6,26,14,5.0,4/7/2014,I was here last week Tuesday ..Cashier Amanda behind the Cheesecake slice area was awesome..attitude was energetic and upbeat..obviously the service was exceptional ..!! This was my first time in 8 years going back to CheeseCake Factory..and she made my experience truly wonderful..The Manager I was able to speak with was great as well.. Thank all of you..I will be back soon.. I got 3 different slices of cheesecake..all excellent..! I wish people that go out to eat learn to understand that giving great service to people who don't deserve it is very hard... It's truly an art form..
Sam C.,"Monterey Park, CA",1195,410,404,4.0,6/27/2011,"This is one of my favorite cheesecake locations b/c its the least amount of wait time compared to their uber crazy pasadena location.  Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurant chains. Despite everything being over 1000 calories!!!! a simple yet satisfying sandwich 'chicken salad'. Bistro shrimp pasta is good when you want one of ur arteries clogged, tostada salad is up to par with any other mexican chicken salad at chain locations. favorite cheesecakes are the vanillia bean, tiramisu, and godiva."
Kate C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/16/2015,"In this heat, the service provided by Marissa was phenomenal.  She was able to accomidate every need we had and still kept a smile on her face.  We need more servers like her!"
Houser S.,"Newport Beach, CA",267,109,31,5.0,4/22/2014,"I am kind of biased because I have always loved Cheesecake Factory restaurants!  BUT we went on Easter Sunday and sort of hesitated because there were lots of people, but we were seated immediately and they were all so friendly! Hostess, waitress, water boy, drink guy, all of them were above and beyond pleasant.  We are all vegetarian, so easy to order, and we had caesar salad, veggie burger and the summer rolls, all generous and all super tasty.  Even the lemonades were awesome, raspberry and a strawberry, yummy!  Topped it off with chocolate ice cream for dessert and we were all happy.  The bill came to almost fifty bucks, but the drinks were each over five bucks, kind of pricey, otherwise our meals were reasonably priced. We tipped twenty percent as they were way above the top and happy, very pleasant and so nice!!  Will definately be back!"
Rae C.,"Pasadena, CA",115,104,39,3.0,3/28/2014,"For the most part the Cheesecake factory is pretty consistent. My husband and I came here to grab a bite to eat after watching a movie. I had steak and shrimp in mind and couldn't wait. To my surprise, our waiter Ebony advised use they were all out of steak Diane. Stuff happens but I was a bit disappointed when Ebony told us they were unwilling to substitute it for any other cut of steak. I don't see that as being my problem. So yeah... That's why they received 3 stars and I'm being nice because I considered giving them 2."
Henry H.,"Arcadia, CA",10,23,6,4.0,11/1/2012,Parking can be annoying due to mall. It is Cheesecake Factory.
Asem A.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,54,140,5.0,3/2/2014,"Great food, best customer service, big portions! Out favorite is the steak Diane and the chicken madera!"
Mel T.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",18,45,8,3.0,8/27/2011,"So I went to the Cheesecake factory last night at around 9-10pm.  I have never gone to this specific cheesecake factory, but I've been to two others and they did not disappoint at all. I'm sad to say that I want to give this place 3 stars. I mean the servers were nice, we all made eye contact and they seemed genuinely friendly.  However when we ordered it was a bit of a mess. Me and one of my cousins ordered for cousin2 who was stuck in traffic.  We asked them for Shrimp and Steak.  There was a combination deal that the waiter told us about and we were like okay ""if you guys can add a side of steak to the shrimp then that'd be cool.'   He told us it was possible because he double checked with the chef. He came back and we stared at the ""steak"". Stared. It was grey and chopped up, looked more like parts of a beef stew with gray sauce rather then a steak.  My cousin who ordered it poked at it and then took a piece of it for herself.  She told me it had no taste.  The waiter was so nice so we felt like dicks for not asking what the fuck was this fuckery. When cousin2 came around, he stared at the plate and then laughed asking us 'what was this.'  We told him our little story. Then afterwards we ordered dessert.  The same waiter brought us a tiramisu cheese cake and banana cream cheese cake. Why did my tiramisu taste like regular plain coffee cake?   Not cool. They also refilled my cousin's coke with root beer. The friendliness was excellent, but they messed up on all our orders."
Jackson Y.,"West Covina, CA",1778,602,1398,1.0,6/17/2011,"When my friends mention anything about going to Cheesecake factory to eat, it brings a feeling of discomfort to me.  There is always a wait, its always super expensive, and the food is almost MEH. I think the chefs at corporate need to stop thinking so hard. I know Americans eat with their eyes, but to most people, it has to taste as good as it looks. I've been disappointed by their food way too many times. I mean, it does look pretty. But yummy food? Methinks not. Last time I was here, I ordered myself a burger, thinking that they can't possibly mess up on a burger right?? Think again! I ordered the factory burger and it came with some super hard french roll. When you bit into the burger, the hard bread squeeze everything to the other side. And the grill onions were the worst grill onions I've ever had in a burger.  I told my friend to get a burger too, he got the Classic burger which was awesome, but they charged $2 to add cheese. Are you kidding me? $2? Thank you CCF for making a bad experience even worst. If you are my friend and want to go celebrate at Cheesecake factory, pleeeeease do Not invite me unless you are paying ;)"
Heather A.,"Alhambra, CA",33,23,8,1.0,11/2/2013,Really disappointing dinner tonight.  Was really excited to learn of their new gluten free menu and they just could not execute to save their life.  My salad came out with croutons.. replacement took forever.  My gluten free pasta came out-- full of regular angel hair noodles.  Clearly they cook their GF pasta in the same water as regular- that is NOT good.  My family was done eating and boxed up their meals before my meal arrived.
