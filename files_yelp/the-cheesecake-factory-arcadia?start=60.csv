Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",130,337,833,5.0,12/18/2016,"What else can be said about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said.  The variety is wonderful and you can please all different types of tastes in your party.  Their pastas, pizzas, salads, and lots of other items are all wonderful.  Portions are huge so it's always good to share and try different things.  Here at the Westfield Arcadia, it's usually pretty busy. The Chicken Bellagio is a great dish to have.  Their BBQ chicken ranch salad is great and the different ingredients add a lot of texture to it.   They do have a happy hour here that is kind of on the down low so if you happen to be here during the week in the afternoon, get some cheaper appetizers in the bar area. Their house bread is phenomenal and it's a staple of their restaurant.  Last but not least, the cheesecake is great.  I like trying the seasonal ones to see what is being featured at the time."
Shihyuan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,14,5,2.0,8/15/2017,"They need to work on their To-Go service.  I ordered a medium rare steak with beets, and cheesecake. When I got there, the steak was ready, but clearly they forgot my side dish. I waited another 10 minutes. When the beets was ready, I found out they forgot my cake too...  I checked over and over to make sure all my order was in the bag.  When i got home, I realized my steak was WELL-DONE, not MEDIUM RARE.  I didn't order a lot and it was Monday night. Not a busy night.  People there are nice but it's frustrated to get your order wrong."
Tina H.,"San Gabriel, CA",55,14,94,3.0,8/28/2017,"We ordered Thai lettuce wraps, mango avocado salad and shrimp scampi pasta. The wraps were fresh and tasty. However, the salad wasn't that great. The chicken was dry. The scampi dish was more on the oily side. Overall, we think it was overpriced. The food was average, not that great. Service was good thou."
Xin L.,"El Monte, CA",0,4,3,1.0,8/27/2017,I used to get really good service at this location，I always visit this location with my families.But I got really terrible service from Christa（that's the name I got，not sure it is real or not）who works at front desk today to serve us the seat .I don't know what's problem with her......I talked to her about my problem to see if she could change another table，because it is too dark for me to read the menu，no lights work on my table.She was so rude that ask me back to the waiting line to get a new number to wait another 30 mins...I totally cannot understand .The light doesn't work is not my fault......really disappointed with this restaurant......A good restaurant should never have cheap service......I want to give 0 star if I can .
Erik L.,"Rosemead, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/13/2017,"On Oct. 12, 2017 around 6:30pm, we ordered 2 set of shrimp angel hair, however they were super salty so we requested to change the meals since it will really hurt our health.  The manager, named Kenny came to our table without any apology, but started to count how many shrimps we ate and insisted we need to pay the super salty shrimps. I actually felt very happy for Cheesecake Factory, since you have such a wonderful and talented manager who I have never seen in my life. The manager, Kenny is super capable for any position in your company. I really think you should promote him at least to CEO and also show his counting shrimp skill to all of your employee."
Tiffany N.,"Arcadia, CA",651,473,691,4.0,1/16/2017,"My dad decided he wanted to have dinner with his wife and kids! (SO RARE WHEN THAT HAPPENS) and he chose Cheesecake Factory! It's only about 3 miles away from our house, too bad they don't take reservations but it is at the mall so it is incredibly packed! We got here around 5:20/30 and it took about 50 minutes to wait, even though they told us 30. We ordered the fried Mac & cheese, warm crab & artichoke dip appetizers, mushroom burger, Louisiana chicken pasta, four cheese chicken pasta, and renee's special! For dessert we got the tiramisu cheesecake. I would've posted more photos but my family was too hungry and ate too quickly! I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory. :)"
Kelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,6,5.0,8/23/2017,"I've always been to my local cheese cake factory never had problems here, the waiters are very friendly. Usually pack Friday-Sunday evening I try to attend on weekdays because I don't wait to get a table ""party of 2."" Their desserts are very good I always get the chocolate cake it's a bit pricy close to $10 for a slice but if you have a sweet tooth you'll enjoy it! It's a good restaurant to go to when your feeling fancy but still want to stay In the budget haha, recommend you guys to try this place if you haven't so."
Kristine C.,"Ontario, CA",0,14,3,5.0,11/7/2017,"BRENDA was the best server I ever had I recommend anyone going to her she's very sweet she made our night pleasant , I'm defiantly getting her again"
Michael Anthony H.,"Glendale, CA",890,101,20,4.0,7/7/2017,"Been here a few times but never really thought to review the spot.  I come for the seared ahi tuna salad and it always hits the spot.  The tuna slices are a bit thicker than other joints I have been to, so it's a fork and knife meal for me.  The wasabi pesto is savory and of course has that familiar kick to it.  Service has always been spot on and have never had an issue.  Of course, the dessert selection never disappoints."
Saint Y.,"El Cajon, CA",1,7,1,1.0,9/25/2017,This place blows ! Screwed up our dinner and took 20 min to get the check. Should of just walked out.
Camille D.,"Temple City, CA",96,24,138,4.0,6/14/2017,"I've been here a couple of times and still get the same thing, BBQ Salmon. This dish is not on the menu but if you ask the server they know what it is. The staff and servers Are very friendly and super helpful if you have any questions. The bread they give is always a hit.. and I usually get full after eating it but it's okay cause then that means I have leftovers for the next day. The cheesecake are delicious! I mean that is what their known for!"
christine c.,"Covina, CA",0,23,6,1.0,12/3/2017,"Came here for my dad's birthday celebration around 530. I was told the wait would be up to 45 minutes for a party of 9. We expected to wait a long time for such a long party but got irritated when we saw multiple parties of 8, who arrived later, get seated before us. When I went to inquire after waiting an hour, the poor attitude from the guy at the host stand was unacceptable. First, insensitively saying we were only there 10 minutes longer then the quoted time - when obviously we had waited for over an hour and not having any reason why at least 3 other later large parties were seated ahead of us. With 3 young kids, waiting an hour is hard enough without dealing with seeing other later parties being seated first and a poor attitude. My husband went to confront the host, who threatened ""I'll take you off this list right now!"" At that point the manager came over to diffuse the situation. We were seated at a table for 8 in the front of the restaurant that stood empty for at at least 15 minutes. I have no problem with waiting but the poor attitude and threat of being taken off the wait list after having been there for an hour was totally inappropriate. How do you normally train your staff to interact with customers? The manager never came back to check on us. Overall, very disappointed."
Eri S.,"Kailua, HI",186,119,745,5.0,7/8/2016,"Great service, great food and great company made tonight a success at the CheeseCake Factory!  Just for your information and you Wanda has never been to the cheesecake factory before no it is not like a cheesecake making factory, it's more of a normal fancy restaurant that's serves a variety of delicious cheesecake.  The menu here may be a little overwhelming. It kind of looks like an encyclopedia of food. Let me tell you little bit of what we ordered because it was all delicious. Loaded baked potato tots  Avocado eggrolls Cobb salad  Bistro shrimp pasta  Herb crusted salmon  Filet mignon (swapped the sides for mac & cheese and sweet potato fries) Eggplant Parmesan"
Rebecca C.,"Arcadia, CA",0,6,3,1.0,6/28/2017,Dirty forks and spoons . Watch out your stomach !  See photos I took at Cheesecake Factory. I m here with my whole family . I don't want my Familu get Dick by coming here should be a delightful afternoon for them .  It turned out we see dirty  forks and spoons on table .  They didn't apologize just try to take away as trying to hide their mistake .
Andrew N.,"Azusa, CA",1,50,5,4.0,10/31/2017,Great food for a restaurant chain. Came on a Monday night and there was no wait. Our server was nice and attentive and our food came out at a reasonable pace. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and it was very tasty. Only regret is that I didn't order dessert.
Carol B.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,52,1,5.0,10/25/2017,"We eat here usually once a week and have our favorites like the chopped salad or vegan Cobb as well as the skinnylicious pastas.  My vegetarian guy loves the choices  this place offers.  As a weight watcher leader I love that they have an entire menu dedicated to healthy eating. Finally the service is terrific from the front desk to our servers and manager , Paul, who always seems to be nearby. Keep up the good work ! Update....still eating here once a week...and they are so consistent that they never disappoint.  The staff has changed but always five star.  Last night Justin waited on us with a terrific attitude like we were all that mattered. Front desk, Dominic, greeted me by name with a big smile.  What an asset he is!  Should be promoted to management."
Adam P.,"Chino Hills, CA",32,154,3,2.0,7/20/2017,"Bad service, but it is Cheesecake factory, its to be expected.  I ordered a grilled salmon, it was over cooked, told the waitress and she just said ok."
Anonymous P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1,58,35,4.0,10/22/2017,"I had eggs Benedict which was average, and the potatoes were way over fried.  I couldn't eat the potatoes.  I still gave a four star because hubby got a fantastic lemon roasted chicken.  I'd try that next time."
Randy T.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,5,7,3.0,10/31/2017,"Love the happy hour but food quality has definitely decreased over the years. Seems cleanliness has as well. Two spoons on our table, not wrapped in a napkin, just open laid out. Yummay!"
Dunant H.,"San Gabriel, CA",383,133,206,4.0,10/28/2016,"I came for their happy hour recently and was extremely satisfied with the food, the prices, the drinks, the service, and the ambience. This review is strictly for their happy hour since I don't remember the last time I came during regular hours. I ordered a happy hour burger for $6 and was extremely impressed with the burger I got. I usually am never impressed or even satisfied with food from a happy hour menu so that really stood out to me. On top of that the drinks were great for $6 as well. We got a few other appetisers as well and they were good but nothing amazing. Our party decided to order a red velvet cheesecake as well and that really hit the spot. Again, I don't know if I'd come during regular hours, but I will definitely be returning for their happy hour."
