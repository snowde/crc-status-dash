Carolyn C.,"El Monte, CA",30,42,25,3.0,5/14/2012,"Typical chain restaurant food.  Tried different selection of their food from salads to salmon to chicken. Only thing that has me coming back is their mash potatoes and their corn sacottosh. Those are yummy!  Their cheesecake is good but very rich and heavy. Service is a hit and miss. Sometime it's slow, sometime it's fast. It doesn't seem to matter what time you go either. I've been there around the same time on a couple different occasion with the same amount of people. One time it took an hour to serve us, while another time 2 hours.  Overall, good decent food for a good decent price for a good big portion."
Bob T.,"Pasadena, CA",1,8,,1.0,7/23/2015,"Went to lunch with my wife mid-week. Short wait, seated in bar area where it was so cold you could hang raw meat without getting it spoiled. My Pear endive salad was half the size it used to be with soggy pears and dead lettuce. My wife's chicken piccata was cold and tasteless. Waitress was pleasant, but the order took 20+ minutes to be served. Best part of the meal was the iced green tea and warm bread. Will never go back to Arcadia store, has gone so far downhill on simple meals."
cindy c.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,135,43,5.0,2/13/2014,Love this place!!! Excellent service and attentive and friendly! The chicken tortilla soup is the BEST!! I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and I gotta admit it was delicious and plentiful!! My husband had the Southwestern Chicken salad which came with a very good side salad! Of course you can't leave without ordering the best cheesecake in the world! We will definitely be back!!
Lauren X.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,365,514,4.0,2/10/2010,"Why does it get 3 stars if most people like this place? Price?  Well, this is the closest to me and I love it! I hate the wait area though, but at least it is bigger than Pasadena where even if  cold you have to wait outside since the seating inside is so limited and everyone hovers by the cake display.  This one at least is more spacious and you can eve bring stroller in..that is how much space there is.  For cheesecake factory: (1) Why not make wait area bigger since cake displays hog up a good amount of space and (2) why don't you have automatic / revolving doors? Your doors are TOO heavy!!  Ok, enough complaining.  Price I don't mind since really it is a 2 portion food you are ordering. I think they are use to boxing things up for you.  The cocktails are good. Mojitos awesome, rasberry martini strong (ask for top shelf if u want stronger), but the flying gorilla, oh my, that is a meal in itself! I would stay away from that or you will need 2 boxes to go.  The regular coffee not good at all. Not strong for price. Specialty coffee like lattes served in huge glass instead of cup. Not bad :D The hot chocolate is heaven!! Meals i love Bang Bang Chicken and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (waiter forgot my plaintains and came back with a huge bowl).  Pastas are usually safe and good. I cannot write too much since most food don't stick out as bad. Personally, though, I think their Small Plates and Snacks Menu is a rip off. The cost is high considering the small bites they give. Go for the huge one! Get the full appetizer and take them home too.  For kids, it is wonderful since they give them warm plate of bread and sliced bananas. Thanks! I just had 2 bad experience here where we were seated and when we had to leave unexpectedly after we placed order, the waiter was so mad at boxing up our items since he thought we will not tip him. That attitude served him a fat bagel from us.  The other one was new and was so rude. Did not box our items and worse off, I had no idea how to use their new box and after he smirked at me, he snapped the lid and stared me down like I am stupid as he said, ""there u go. easy as that."" What a f. jerk my husband and I said.  His tip suffered too.   This joint has great and friendly servers overall besides these 2 that are probably not there anymore.  I have no problem with wait time since I go off hours. Love their curb side service although I think they need a better system in locating your car. I had to roll window down in rain and flag her down since she could not see where my car was...in front of her."
Wesley V.,"West Covina, CA",61,192,66,3.0,6/20/2013,"I've only been here once. I usually go to the one in old town. This location isn't the better one in my opinion.  I came in for happy hour.  It's $5 for a margarita which has a good flavor and not too strong. I don't drink too heavy. They have something called the ultimately margarita. Not sure what's that all about.  I ordered the Salisbury steak. The plate had mashed potatoes and some green beans. The sauce on the steak had only a few mushrooms but plenty of onions. Supposedly there was garlic in it. I couldn't really taste it.  Just like any other Cheesdcake Factory, they'll give you bread and butter. It just didn't taste very fresh here like the one in old town. It was harder than what I expected. Especially with the brown bread, it was harder then usual.  The dishes were not cleaned very well. I had to ask the bartender for another fork, but it was still dirty. It looked like it was soaked in water without soap.  I could've gotten sick."
Sakura K.,"South Pasadena, CA",95,14,,4.0,6/5/2012,"I love Cheesecake! And my favorite dishes so far are: Hibachi Steak, Avocado Egg rolls, Crispy Crab Wontons, Ahi Tuna Tartar, and the Vietnamese Tacos. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and nice :) They usually give great suggestions."
Suzette c.,"La Verne, CA",24,45,9,1.0,4/16/2015,"Worst experience ever. This was my first time at this locate but I love this restaurant. The first problem started when they took 3  people who walked in after my party (which was the same amount of people [3]). When we asked why we were not being seated no one had answers. When we were finally seated our waiter was nice but our food was not good. The fire roasted artichoke was cold and had to be sent back, and the lettuce wraps were wrapped in Brown lettuce. It took forever to get drink refills as well. My real problem with this location is they are thieves! I left my bag in the booth on the table and when I called to retrieve it I was put on hold for an excessive amount of time, after 20 minutes of waiting they took my number down but no one called me. I called again and asked for a manager and I was put on hold again and then someone picked up and said the managers are really busy and they didn't have my bag. I called one more time and left my number  but again no one called me back. Im so glad I live really far from here and I will never give a dime to any cheesecake factory again because of this."
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,1/6/2012,"I think I like this one more than the one in Brea. Food is always bomb! Staff was nice, we had a good time."
Siling C.,"Rosemead, CA",285,191,104,2.0,2/4/2015,"My recent visit with my mom was such a disappointment. Dont get me wrong, we love going to cheese cake factory for lunch but our service was horrible. I didnt get the chance to catch her name, i should have took the receipt, but she took the bill before i got the chance to take a look at it. Anyways, she only came by three times, to take our order, bring our water and our food. Thats it, never saw her again. Never stopped by if we wanted any refills on our drinks. It wasnt even busy so thats no excuse. Well she did came back at the end and was going to fill our drinks but whats the point, we were done with our meal. Dropped off our check and when i asked her for boxes she just left it at our table. From what i remember, the last 4 times ive been there the waiters packed what we have left over for us, but ofcourse they were male waiters. Female waitress are always bitches with a bad attitude. She was lucky we even tipped her. Because im not the type of person to leave without tipping. that was the first and last time ill ever allow her to my server."
Mary S.,"Van Nuys, CA",31,43,4,4.0,9/27/2011,"One of my reviews on another Cheesecake location clearly shows my love for this place.  I have been to this location a couple times. The parking sucks since it is in a mall strip and there are several other restaurants around it. I have valet before because I didn't want to park at the other end of the parking.  My coworker and I made a quick stop before returning to work. The food was great as always and the server brought us extra brown bread (yummy).  The place, surprisingly, was empty. Our server was great at first but then disappeared for a while. Some other server came around and asked if we needed anything. We were confused because we were not sure if their shifts changed. We then asked another server to have our server bring over the check.  Bottom line service was not so horrible and no matter what I will be back be the food is delish."
Jennifer T.,"San Gabriel, CA",12,27,18,4.0,8/8/2013,Good food. Came for half off on cheesecakes. Ordered garlic noodles.....delicious.
Secret Shopper S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,214,1,5.0,5/18/2012,"Great service, great food, consistently delicious food.  Large portions reasonable price. Nice atmosphere. One of my favorites! 5 Stars!"
G A.,"Alhambra, CA",0,15,3,5.0,7/6/2015,Only downside is that it's always busy and you have to wait for a table but the food is always good and the service is better than average.
Hen C.,"El Segundo, CA",0,71,5,5.0,9/19/2011,"Great service, good food, huge selection of food and cheese cakes. One of the best rib eye steaks I tasted. Very tender, juicy,  and flavorful.  Restaurant is a bit on the noisy because of the super tall ceilings. However, the ceilings give the space a very dramatic look. King Julian Rules!"
Kouch C.,"Monterey Park, CA",5,118,21,4.0,4/29/2014,"My sister ordered their cheesecake to go and I tried it. The place is quite expensive. However, their service is great. Very friendly and welcoming."
Rolo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,250,58,5.0,1/6/2014,"I rarely do chain restaurants but The Cheesecake Factory is one of the exceptions, especially right before a movie next door.  The food is always tasty and consistent but I am most impressed with the staff here.  They are always courteous and if there's some sort of misunderstanding, they not only correct it, they always seem go one step further.  This place truly has a ""customer is always right"" vibe to it.  I'll keep coming back."
Duke F.,"Queens, NY",187,232,220,2.0,11/20/2011,"I went to Cheesecake factory last night after a long day of continuing education . I got there around 8 PM. Parking is a big issue.. it took me about twenty to 30 minutes to get a parking. When I got inside; place was busy...I went to the bar to wait for our table. I ordered a passion fruit mojito at the bar..it was more like a passion fruit slush cause I only taste the passion  fruit. For 10 dollars.. this is too weak. BY the time we get to our table.. we immmediately ordered. It takes a long time to get our food. I ordered the jamaican pepper shrimps. It comes with rice, black bean and mango. food was ok..it is spicey. my friend ordered some pasta dish. For the quality of food and the portion; it is overpriced. The dessert cheecake with strawberry was good. Will go back for the cheesecake."
Angel H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",56,37,2,5.0,6/16/2012,"Avocado Eggrolls -- soooooooo good !!  Artichoke with garlic dip -- its good but not that much too eat, dont order this when you are hungry.  Chicken Madeira -- Best dish ! Steak Diane -- steak with mushrooms are very good, dont like the Mashed Potatoes that much.  Recommend Factory Combinations, so you can have two great dishes at the same time, and the potion is good too. I had Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi, they both REALLY good but the mashed potato is massive. i only took 2 bites.  and..... cheesecakes! you cant come here without taking their cheesecakes. My favorite is Tiramisu Cheesecake, cant get enough of it!! White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is also good.  If you come here on your birthday, they will write ""Happy birthday"" and put a candle on your cheesecake, and the waiters and waitresses will sing ""Happy birthday"" song.  Nothing is better than having a cheesecake for birthday cake :)"
Dude Food G.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,541,217,3.0,10/12/2011,"The location is decent. The ambiance is added into the cost. Corporate look, corporate food.  It was better in the old days."
