Gary L.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,297,616,4.0,7/7/2009,"Stopped by with my gf after the movie and sat at the bar. Nice and quiet on a monday....We ordered a Mai-Tai, and another one...man, they were excellent ! Better then Trader vics, or the ones we had on Maui at Tommy Bahamas. ( I think the secret is the passion fruit juice, after asking the bartender) Speaking of the bartender, he was very attentive and professional. He was obviously on top of everything and the drinks. Knowing that the dinner portions are huge, we simply ordered a couple of appetizers (some ahi tuna and quesadillas) which were delicious and plentiful. For the lack of expectations, it was actually one of the best drink/food/ambiance date we ever had ! By the way, they do get VERY busy on the weekend evenings, so be warned !"
Jon P.,"Zürich, Switzerland",24,93,2,4.0,10/11/2013,"The dish with spaghetti, pesto, arugula and prosciutto is bomb."
C W.,"Chino, CA",12,178,14,4.0,2/13/2014,"I've been here a few times and overal the experiences have been great. I always order the guacamole spicy. Their ""spicy"" is more of a mild... The first 2 times the waitresses said the spicy is not spicy at all and they were right! The third time I ordered it spicy it burned the hell out of my mouth and I couldn't even enjoy ot eat it.. =(..The service is pretty consistent and I love the chicken castaletta! Yummy lemon butter sauce I could probably drink a gallon! I had the wings which were ok, my husband orders the chicken fried chicken and it was pretty good too."
Nicole K.,"Pasadena, CA",0,19,,4.0,6/10/2011,LOVE the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Key Lime Mango Cheesecake. Favorite Appetizers: Avocado Eggrolls and Fried Calamari I love the pastas here too.  I always order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta or the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic.  It's so good!  My favorite burger is the Kobe Burger.
Don T.,"Glendora, CA",77,620,340,3.0,12/10/2013,"CF is elegant, busy, pricy and great for special occasions."
Jenny P.,"Alhambra, CA",7,105,5,4.0,2/1/2014,"Good food, good drinks, good staff. You really can't go too wrong with the Cheesecake Factory unless you come on a really busy day/time then your waiting a while. Worth it though."
Lauren L.,"San Francisco, CA",65,387,6,3.0,2/13/2011,"So, after much internal debate, i've come to a simple one-sentence review: THE BEST AVERAGE RESTAURANT.  Right???? It's not deliciously amazing, but it's not horribly bad. That pretty much sums up the Cheesecake Factory in a nutshell! But if you do eat here, i've scoped (and eaten) much of the menu over the years, and here's what you should order: Luau Salad (ask for LIGHT dressing, since they seem to drench it every time), Pasta Jambalaya (slightly spicy, but pretty good), Kobe Burger, and that's about it. Oh, and the vanilla bean cheesecake is super delicious -- when you're NOT counting your caloric intake. It's good, not great (...and we all know that)"
Tiffany P.,"Monterey Park, CA",299,640,47,4.0,10/23/2011,Gotta love the gluttonous menu that Cheesecake offers!  My fav is the fish and chips... surprisingly good here! Banana cheesecake is a must if you have room for dessert!  The whipped cream served on the side is light and not overwhelming at all.
Veronica H.,"El Monte, CA",0,8,1,2.0,7/25/2014,"I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo, which wasn't good to be honest, and half way through my meal there was a HAIR in my food!!! I was so disguised! They waiter AND manager had the nerve to ask me if it was mine! I have long blonde hair and the hair that I found was short and black! They brought out a new dish to apologize but they charged me for the new dish! It should have been free! This was my first and last time here!"
T W D.,"Pasadena, CA",124,24,2,1.0,1/31/2012,"This was by far the WORST CHEESECAKE FACTORY I HAVE EVER been too!!!  The food wasn't seasoned!  The request for well done salmon came back seared!  The service was horrible!! I talked to a friend who went about a week before me and before I said anything, told me they would never go there again!! Get a new Chef!"
Eddie Z.,"La Puente, CA",54,35,16,4.0,10/26/2011,Came in for lunch today. I had the herb salmon with red skin mashed potatos assparagus in a creamy sause. It was delucious. Our server was great she was real informative and her recomendation were fabulous. We had the carat cake for dessert.
Sandie S.,"Alhambra, CA",61,123,23,5.0,6/22/2011,"I'm a total sucker for the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo!! It's soooo delicious and for only 19.99!! It's a total steal :) We come here pretty often, but this review is for our last visit there. Which was I believe last Saturday night. Our server Lawerence was absolutely amazing! No, amazing doesn't even describe it! So good, if I was a mystery guest he would have gotten over 100% due to passing the bonus section (although I never know exactly what that is, maybe changing the bev naps on every drink delivery.. But who knows) anywho, he was reallyamiable and attentive! The bf and I never order dessert but he did such a great job at suggestive selling that the bf jumped up atthe sound of reses pieces! Lol I know cheesecake is a corporate franchise but I think this is the only one that I actually enjoy! Way better than applebees, Bj's and all those other white collar craptacular restaurants! This location gets my two opposable thumbs up from my beautifully evolved prehensile hands :)"
Michelle K.,"Pasadena, CA",532,691,249,4.0,3/3/2011,vietnamese tacos (sounds gross but SO GOOD - the meat is so bomb) and passionfruit mojito. end of story. I hate the awkward servers though...they need more of a personality...everytime I go there I get a weird one.
Joanne T.,"Alhambra, CA",25,157,,3.0,11/28/2011,"Ehhh. It's okay, not great, but okay. Two words = Very Packed.  They don't take reservations because they like it when people wait outside.  I like the complimentary bread. The rest of the food was okay: 1. Chicken Bellagio = very salty 2. Memphis Burger = dry 3. Kobe Burger = yum 4. Shrimp pasta in white wine sauce = good 5. Cheesecakes = yum Our order came out late, but the waitress gave us complimentary soup, so that was nice.  It's very dark inside. Parking is a hassle especially since it's holiday shopping season, so I recommend you go at odd hours, if you can. The smaller your party, the easier it is to seat."
Jess C.,"Walnut, CA",171,30,12,5.0,11/26/2013,"Just enjoyed a lovely dinner with my boyfriend at this cheesecake factory location for my birthday. Our waitress, brenda, was especially sweet! She would consistently check in on us without being too overbearing. She started us off with the mai tai and the mango melon crush which were both delicious. Since we love calamari, that was next and it was the perfect amount to share for two. Next we ordered two factory combinations and that definitely more than we could handle. The steak diane was cooked perfectly and there were a ton of mashed potatoes. It has been a while since we had such a pleasant experience and I was more than happy to immediately write a review."
Sal D.,"Haddonfield, NJ",1218,543,374,3.0,11/1/2010,"Came here for dinner, and service was amazing. I guess our waiter was be trained because he was being shadowed.  The complimentary bread was really good one wheat roll and one sourdough. Me and the gf both got salads very delicious and large. They have healthier lower calorie versions of salads too. She had a dirty martini and I had a 22oz heff very delicious. Where this place loses stars is on price our bill came to $52, which is kind of pricey for what we got. It also has to lose a star because it's happy hour ends at 6, not very happy."
william c.,"Arcadia, CA",8,9,1,4.0,2/22/2012,"My experience here has been excellent....I have been to a lot of the other CF restaurants, and this one seems to be very consistent for food quality and service....The portions are huge, and the best value is during lunch.... I agree with some of the reviewers regarding the interior ( a little too much pomp) but the high ceilings do make it more relaxing than say, a bomb shelter pub..... The pasta (Da Vinci) is great, and the Seafood Gumbo was good and spicy.. If your not completely satisfied with your server, just politely go to the front desk and ask for a replacement...some of the personalities of the younger staff can be a little aggressive.....but the typical experience is usually quite good!!!"
Karen L.,"Norwalk, CA",59,34,4,5.0,10/7/2011,"Got the fresh strawberry cheesecake & tried some of my buddies' banana cream cheesecake. Both were YUMMY! But I preferred the banana over the strawberry (:  If you love bananas, you know which one to get. Even their whipped cream was yummy & not too heavy. Service was great too. (Their alcohol's tasty too... Get the Peach Bellini if you like fruity + icy)  Loved my experience here. Will go again!"
Martin D.,"Altadena, CA",39,24,5,4.0,3/25/2015,"Skinny Licious shrimp tacos were very good, the wild mushroom soup was delicious, the service was friendly."
