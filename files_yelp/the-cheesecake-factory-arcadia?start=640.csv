Sam T.,"Temple City, CA",244,595,405,2.0,6/10/2009,"It's been years since I've gone to a Cheesecake Factory I forgot what it was like here. The menu is ginormous with dare I say something for everyone. The portions are fairy huge but so are the prices.  Food:  Once again gigantic menu. You would think they a restaurant would focus on a theme...not the case here...you can order American, European. Asian, and Mexican influenced dishes here. Great place for groups where people have different preferences in food. The food is decent which is expected per reputation but definitely can be better. Service:  Very slow service. Given I went with a group of 15..still service was lacking quite a bit. It took awhile before I even got a plate on my table. The dish I ordered had raw chicken....in which the waitress was shocked and didn't know what to do (she took the raw chicken in but not the rest of the plate).  Environment:  It took me awhile to realize I was eating raw chicken. I thought to myself this is way too moist for chicken breast. We couldn't really tell because it was so dark it there. We eventually busted out 3 cell phones and confirmed Mr. Raw chicken was being eaten by yours truly. The restaurant is quite loud not a place where I would bring a date. I expected a bit more eligance based on design...but not the case here.  Price:  Well its not the most expensive place you can choose, but for the food I'm expecting a little more.  Overall lacking experience.  Food: 3 Service: 2 Environment: 2 Price: 2"
Cate T.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,334,665,4.0,9/21/2010,"I came here to pick up some dessert to-go, and the place was so quiet that I thought they were closed, but I was assured that they were not and was able to breathe a sigh of relief!  If I couldn't have my dessert fix, I would have been very disappointed! I love the way the Cheesecake Factory chain displays their desserts right at the entrance for hungry people waiting to be seated. They simply can't help gazing at the display case full of cheesecakes and delicious things. I know it's odd to give a review about the dessert counter, but that was my sole reason for being inside. I've been here during normal daylight hours and when it's packed, and it's just like most other Cheesecake Factory restaurants - but I was really just tickled to talk with Alyssa about our favourite desserts, and she was very helpful and very evil, showing my dessert cohort the different cheesecakes by pulling them out so he could get a closer look. She turned what could've been a very boring non-conversation while dealing with the evening slow into something a bit more entertaining. Mmm, sweet tooth? Satisfied."
David P.,"Alhambra, CA",61,40,,5.0,3/14/2014,"Been coming here for a couple years now and have to say I enjoy alot of the food here, and the cheesecake is great especially the Adams peanut butter yum! .Try to come before everyone gets off work if not you'll be waiting for a bit and the parking sucks major, but the service is good and they give you bread while you wait""white bread"" ""orowheat"" are the two which are good."
Nicholas S.,"Temple City, CA",92,3,1,1.0,4/11/2015,This is the worst! My party of 12 arrived at 5:30 pm. We were told 75 minute wait. 2 HOURS later we are still waiting. Unbelievable! Will never return for dinner again. Sad for the birthday girl.
Yeena N.,"Temple City, CA",177,86,2,5.0,1/1/2011,"I haven't really been to Cheesecake in a few years (up until recently), though I did come a lot when I was in middle school. This place is pretty good, and it brings back a lot of memories.  The service here is great. The waiters and waitresses are always nice. I used to go with 15-20 of my friends back when we were a bit younger, rowdier, and more annoying, and even then, they treated us well. Though there is usually a wait for tables, particularly during mealtimes, they would provide us with a vibrating notifier, which shakes when a table is available. It lets us roam around the mall while we wait, so we will not be bored. The food here is delicious as well. I usually order a four-cheese pasta and share it with one or two other people. The portions are large, so even when two or three people are splitting an entree, we get pretty filled up. The appetizers here are wonderful as well. However, eating here is a little pricey. Expect to pay at least $15 for lunch per entree, including tax and tip. They used to include tip in the total bill, but now they don't. Though it's a bit expensive, I think the portion size makes up for how much it costs. Their food and service are great, so I'll give it 5-stars, even though it's a little expensive. This is a nice place to go for an occasional treat, and I would definitely return."
Ed T.,"San Marino, CA",59,365,133,3.0,8/21/2013,"We have been coming here forever for dinner but it is our first time for happy hours. Silly me, I thought it was only for adults and didn't know children are allowed. 4 stars  for these appetizers 1) buffalo chicken stuffed with cheese for $5 dollars. It was yummy and the portion is perfect. 2)Tex Mex roll . 3 stars for sliders. The small dishes are expensive and small 1)crab bite , 2) beet salad, 3)flat bread is a joke. $6 for smaller than a slice of pizza! can not imagine why anybody would pay regular price. I like the deep fried combo; avocado, mushroom and zucchini but at $7 for happy hours is still not cheap.I wish they offer deep fried calamari, onion rings, chicken wings and soup for appetizer's (Yard house). drinks  for $5 is good. 3 # stars rating is for happy hours only."
Arely M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",2,5,2,1.0,1/29/2015,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Our waitress had a nasty attitude. She got upset whn we asked if she could split the bill. She even rolled her eyes the 2nd time she asked if i was ready to order and i said no. We ate here last night to celebrate my cousins birthday we had to ask 3 different ppl to come and sing happy birthday apparently our waitress forgot.. we didn't mind that they took awhile bc there were a lot of other families celebrating as well. we counted 6 different tables they sang to, which made us excited for them to finally get to our table. Unfortunately by the time they got to our table they were in a bad mood I guess and only 3 ppl showed up.. and to the other tables we saw at least 5 to 6 ppl... that's not even the worst part! They didn't even pretend to be happy only one person was smiling while singing and they sounded like they were mumbling the words their clap was very weak too. They sucked the happiness from the whole table,It just felt awkward the whole time. I wish my 1st experience  here wasn't this awful maybe they just need better employees ... sigh* I'm never coming here ever again"
Dayae K.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,331,7,3.0,9/16/2010,"i've only been to cheesecake factory 4 times in my life... the reason why i don't like to go here is because the food and service is always subpar. during my most recent trip to the restaurant, i happen to go during their happy hour... i didn't even know they had one. (it's from 4pm-6pm at the bar) all their appetizers are $5 and the alcohol is 50% off. my friend and i ordered their hot spinach artichoke dip and chicken taquitos. both the food and the portion was good. again, the restaurant failed to impress me with their service... the waiter barely came to check up on us. honestly, cheesecake is not somewhere i would go on a daily basis, but if you are around the area and need a place to eat that is cheap, then just stop by during their happy hour."
Judy M.,"Arcadia, CA",1,6,2,5.0,5/15/2013,"This place is excellent, they treat me and my boyfriend with awesome food. I love ordering a blue moon and eating their delicious shepherds pie. The portions are huge and it's worth the money. You can eat outside, they have outdoor heating lamps that keep you warm and toasty in the winter. The bar is awesome and I love that they have a tv if you want to watch a game. I love this place! The staff is so sweet, kind, and friendly. I recommend coming to this place, but be sure to call in advance because it's always busy. After all, they not only make good food, they make excellent desserts."
Ken B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/22/2014,Consistantly good food.  Chicken Madiera and Fettuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes especially good.  Caesar salad also good. Large portions- you'll have to  take half home. Always good service.
William M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",252,439,155,4.0,9/28/2010,"Im normally not a fan of Cheesecake Factory, its an overpriced marie callender's IMO. Brought a friend here for lunch for her birthday, her choice. It was pretty empty for lunch time - really surprised. We were seated right away, the waitress came to greet us and told us the specials, and took our drink orders. Waitress was real attentive (probably cuz it was so empty there). Basket of bread was brought out to us right away -  I order the cuban sandwich - it was really good. Big portions, as I was only able to finish half of it. You have the choice of fries or salad. You can get regular fries or the sweet potato fries, I got the regular. My friend got some pasta dish. The pasta didnt look very good, at least for my taste. But my friend said it was good.  The waitress boxed up everything for us, and then offered us some cheesecake, we passed on that. But the new Reese Peanut Butter cup one looked really good. I wouldve gotten one to go, but it was crazy hot and didnt think it would survive the ride home. Maybe next time. This was probably one of the best experiences Ive had in a Cheesecake Factory. Will I be coming back? hmmm not if it were up to me."
K X.,"Pasadena, CA",8,220,12,2.0,7/17/2013,"Used to be better. Food is barely average now. Food taste old and bread taste stale. If you want mediocre food, this is the spot. There's nothing outstanding. I usually come here and get the pear/cranberry salad (forgot the name) and my friends would order form their breakfast menu. Although food and service is just OK, I would come here for the ambiance. I like how it feels on a Sunday morning eating outdoors or indoors at this location."
Greg M.,"Eagle Rock, CA",307,41,23,3.0,10/26/2010,"It's so dark in here (at 7:00 pm). You can barely see the menu, much less the food. If I had known I was going to eat in a cave I would have worn a loincloth. Other than that, typical Cheesecake Factory fare."
Ru C.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,634,567,4.0,5/17/2011,the food is good although they're very.....bad for you hahaha the waitress I had was great! sorry I forgot her name...but she was super friendly and very efficient! usually they're pretty slow....so 4 stars!
Tony A.,"Covina, CA",12,79,,4.0,10/4/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory always has great service and good food.  Like all Cheesecake Factory locations, the portions are big and filling.  My wife and I had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia, CA on a Friday night.  We got there around 7pm.  There was still plenty of parking and we did not have to wait long to be seated.  Every staff member was friendly and polite.  Our server was a nice young lady named Taylor.  She was extremely courteous and considerate.  She was very patient.   My wife ordered the pasta carbonara.  It was very delicious.   I ordered the hibachi steak.  I thought it was a little sweet, but the meat was tender and the mashed potatoes tasted wonderfully.  I especially liked the tempura asparagus.  For dessert we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  It was rich and heavenly.   More customers were showing up later in the night and it got a little noisy, but nothing too bad considering it was a Friday night.   I highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory.  You'll never leave hungry."
Brian T.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,80,9,4.0,11/14/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is outside the mall. They have a nice patio seating. If you are shopping and want to check out their happy hour menu after then it's perfect. Love the Mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, buffalo, and the small side salads are a perfect size. Most of their portions are generally pretty big. Chicken littles plate is probably one of my favorite dish."
Mar M.,"Pasadena, CA",1,27,11,1.0,2/7/2014,"I go to Cheesecake Factory locations when I am in the area of one. I tried this particular one. It was the worst. The server was not professional. Our food was ""to go"" but when I inspected it the fries were old and cold, as was the burger.  I waited too long for that so I requested my money back and did not even take the food. Would you believe they refused to refund all the money and kept $1??? Wrong on so many levels. The manager didn't help so we left and tell anyone we can not to go there."
Lynn L.,"Tustin, CA",78,45,22,3.0,7/2/2011,"Cheesecake factory is a good restaurant for a not-too-expensive first date. The food is nicely plated. Patio seating is good during summer time. They invested a lot of money in the interior decoration of the restaurant giving it an upscale ambience. Food is above average, generally NOT healthy. The dishes I recommend are:  Cobb salad, Luau Salad: these are entree salad that will fill you up! With the dressing, calorie count is almost the same as a burger with fries. Have dressing on the side and go easy, so you won't ruin a week's workout with one meal.  Shrimp Scampi: good and buttery. Usually served with mash potato or linguini, subsitute for veggies as a healthier option.  Steak Diane: It's served with Madeira wine sauce with mushrooms, sweet and savory. sauce can be greasy some times, but flavor is good.  New Orlean Shrimp: good cajun flavor, light and not greasy. It's one of my favorites! Gumbo with Chicken and Shrimp: simillar to New Orlean shrimp, but it has heavy cream. Recommended if you are in for something hearty.  I can go on and on because their menu is so big. I love the brunch menu. Recommend the Baja Chicken Hash, Egg's Benedict.  Of course, don't forget Cheesecake. They are yummy but each slice has  800 to 1200 calories!! Remember to get a slice to share and not to over eat! Remember a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!!"
Kim B.,"Tustin, CA",1,4,1,1.0,2/18/2013,"My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory last night, there were FIVE of us.  We sat on the patio, Jeff was our server.  The funny thing was we really enjoyed Jeff, he was polite and prompt and got all our food right, which can be an inconsistency there. My family and I are playful with our servers, my brother and I are servers ourselves so we want to make the experience enjoyable for everyone. Well, we thanked Jeff for everything and said we had great service, however, when he brings the bill gratuity was added.  It clearly states it is added for parties of SIX or more. So Jeff and apparently the manager agreed to add gratuity.  This is hugely disappointing, for some reason Jeff and the manager judged my family and thinking we would not tip.  We did not say anything, nor want anything for the disappointment, we just will not go back.  We are great tippers and would have actually tipped a lot more than what was added, but the principle of the matter is he did not deserve it after all.  That shows poor character on JEFF and the restaurant.  Being the industry for a long time I have heard that this Cheesecake Factory Location is the one of the SLOWEST and now I know why, with attitudes like this no one will trust them. Who wants to give their hard earned money to people that are ungrateful? NOT ME!!!"
Anne T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",262,140,39,3.0,8/8/2011,"4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service, so I give it three stars to go in between. First off, I'd like to talk about the service.  After my entree was served, the waiter forgot to give me my steak knife.  No big deal, right?  I let that slide.  However, while giving our food to the waiter to pack in togo boxes, he gave us the wrong box and mixed ours up with another table...  so we had to wait awhile to get it fixed. So enough of my whining about the service.  The food was good.  -Filet mignon was a good size and very soft.  It cut like butter.   -Fish tacos were okay...  the tortilla was a little stale. -Avocado Egg Rolls are ALWAYS amazing here. -The Roasted Vegetable Pizza was really good for a vegetarian pizza. Overall, this place gets 3 stars because of the 'meh' service and good food."
