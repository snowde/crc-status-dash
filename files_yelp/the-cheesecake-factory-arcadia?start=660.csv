Judas P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",3,121,13,3.0,9/17/2013,"What is there to say about a Cheesecake Factory? There are a ton of options on the menu, most all of which contain a zillion calories and are safe/bland. The decor is welcoming and clean. The prices are not too bad. The cheesecake is really the only reason to come. It is as corporate and plain as chain restaurants get, but is slightly better than its competition."
John N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,87,27,5.0,9/12/2013,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations out there.  It is located on the south side, near the east end of the Santa Anita Mall. The restaurant has a grandiose facade, with a modern, trendy front end.  The furniture were new and clean.  The lighting is perfectly dim, and the table that I was at offered lots of privacy, where I can't hear the conversation from the table next to mine. The food was good.  The Santa Fe Salad was fresh and crispy, and the endless strawberry lemonade that I got had the perfect blend of sweet and sour.  The complimentary bread and butter were nice and fresh as well. Service by Natalie was top-notch.  The bread kept on coming because my coworkers were hogs.  I had a couple of strawberry lemonade refills, but I never had to ask because the server was always near my table and very attentive."
Tiffany Bernard ..,"Pasadena, CA",75,25,323,1.0,7/31/2013,Never went to a dine in restaurant with over 10 plus flys flying around and just crawling around the mirrors where the food would come out. Found it quite disgusting having to hit away flys while trying to eat and conversate all at the same time. When telling the waiter he was already aware of the situation. Cheesecake Factory should get rid of the situation because that is really unsanitary and can cause poor reviews.
Jay C.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,328,791,2.0,5/9/2011,Ordered steak dinner; gf had some pasta dish.  For ~$50 I expected much better. Also the bread was delivered after our food arrived--we had to remind our waitress when she was the one who asked us if we wanted any in the first place.
Alisa T.,"Azusa, CA",54,221,209,5.0,12/21/2012,"I've always enjoyed going to Cheesecake Factory since I was living back home in Chicago.  Then when I moved out here to CA, I still enjoy going to eat at one.  I've been to the one in Huntington Beach, Old Town Pasadena and this one in Arcadia at the Santa Anita Westfield Mall.  Tonight, my hubby and I went during dinner time and like we expected it, there was a long wait of people hovering around once we opened the door.  Everyone standing around with their table buzzer in hand.  The front desk girl informed my hubby, the wait would be about 30min.  But since we said we are open for the 1st available table, we got a table right away and didn't have to wait instead we got a table at their outdoor seating area.  Even though it was cold outside tonight, we were willing to sit outside since they have the large heater lamps.  Our server, was a sweet blondie name Danielle.  She was very nice and good at her job.  She always made sure my hubby and I were doing good, and kept on coming back to check up on us and refilled our bread and his drink.  Our yummy chicken samosas came out nice and warm, and was quite tasty as we've never had it there before.  It was under their ""small plate & snack"" section for just $5.95, more inexpensive than their appetizer section by far and just enough for the two of us.  Eating too much appetizer can fill you up fast, and then you won't have room for your entrees.  We both ended up having a pasta dish, I stuck with my usual which was the crusted chicken romano with a side of spaghetti and he got the Louisiana chicken dish with bowtie pasta.  We both enjoyed our dinner and our customer service by the front desk staff and our server Danielle was awesome.  Two thumbs up, and we'll continue being customers with Cheesecake Factory!"
Elizabeth T.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,508,699,3.0,4/22/2009,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said?.... hmm, probably not much so I'll keep this short. Parking: Hard to find on a busy day, esp. because people also park here for other restaurants, shopping, Borders, and the AMC theater which is right on the other side. Food: Large variety of foods.  The menu's a book and covers a lot of different ethnic foods, from pasta to Thai noodles to Carribean style seafoods to Eastern Euro goulash, the menu goes on.  By the way, don't try the Thai chicken pasta unless you like peanut buttery noodles.  I like their lunch specials, which are a smaller portion of particularly selected plates, but still more than enough for one person to dine. Service: well, there are so many different workers there; I don't exactly remember seeing the same face twice, but the last hostess there was extremely rude, diverting my questions and telling me to sit down.  Rude!   But, our server was extremely nice and accommodating when I told her about a food preference.  She even went and checked with the chef to ask if he would cook our food differently.  How wonderful!  I've had good and bad experiences alike, but I think the best thing about this place is that everyone can find something they like on the menu."
Pamela S.,"West Los Angeles, CA",720,571,174,3.0,9/19/2008,"I love pasta so I like The Cheesecake Factory. Surprisingly, I also love cheesecake but I've never tried the cheesecake here. I think it's because by the time I'm all full from the free bread and the pasta, it's just too much to think about dessert. I wish service wasn't so slow here, though. From waiting for a table, to waiting for our order to be taken, to -the worst part- waiting for the food to arrive. Also, I'm not a fan of all the pastas. I think the Four Cheese one is my favorite so far. The Cheesecake Factory is someplace that I wouldn't mind going to every once in a while, but I don't really feel like going there randomly for lunch or anything."
Linh T.,"El Monte, CA",41,22,,4.0,9/25/2011,"Sometime I come here on the weekend, it's always crowded. The food is pretty good. Cheesecakes are awesome, esp. the keylime and coconut... yummie!!! It's right by the mall, so shop and dine at the same place... hehe..  me like!!!"
Danny D.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",219,194,33,4.0,11/16/2013,"Good spot to bring the family, love the appetizers and the mizo salmon plate.."
Jessica C.,"Temple City, CA",364,72,37,1.0,9/7/2010,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years & i always heard that the customer service here wasn't as good as the other ones. I didn't really understand that. I thought the service was fine, that was...until I went to other Cheesecake Factorys. This one has terrible service compared to the other ones.  My most recent experience was about 3 weeks ago. My server was really a chatty cathy. We would order something, and she would start a conversation on what we were ordering & then tangent. It's kind of like....wtf? She flirted with one of the members of my party...who was sitting next to his girlfriend. She also started telling us about how she was glad that the party next to us had left because the little kids had been whiney and loud with none of us prompting her to talk about it. Although, the food was good. My previous experience before that, the waiter was really good. I was really difficult & he pulled through fine but he looked really tired & exhausted and I felt bad for him. Also, my chicken in my Pasta Di Vinci was past serving times because it was hard, as though it had been sitting around for longer than it should have been (I know this because I work at a fast food place that serves the same type of chicken). There are better Cheesecake Factorys out there. Go to those."
Ashley K.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2015,"Ordered Takeout and (Angela, I believe thats her name) is probably one of the rudest people I've ever encountered. Wouldn't even look at me while taking my order, and had the biggest attitude. Just overall very unprofessional."
Sue P.,"Pasadena, CA",1,340,157,3.0,9/27/2010,"Came here with my honey this past weekend. My knife looked dirty. The waiter had to replace my utensils. I asked for green tea and the waiter brought me mint tea. At least he was not color blind but can't read. Service was ok. For some reason, it was not crowded at all, Where did everyone go? Maybe it has something to do with the Full moon! Ha! Ha! I had Tiramisu again. The next day, I got sick again. I really think the cream is spoiled. I never have problem with tiramisu from Olive Gardens. Come to think of it, maybe it was the claim chowder that got me sick."
Delphine W.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,45,2,4.0,8/26/2010,"Yes, I have been to this cheesecake probably 30 times, but just on this trip, I had to yelp! what i ordered: Renee's Special (Turkey, Mexican Tortilla Soup, and Caesar Salad!)           Everything was pretty great, except for the soup, it was on the salty side, but the sandwich and salad were perfect! My friend ordered the Everything Pizza which was huge and was filled with toppings. For dessert: Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake! This one is really good, but sweet. I would advise you to share. This one is my favorite, kinda.  OK. so the reason I had to yelp this trip was because of the service. My waitress was Katie and she IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE. She was so helpful and funny, and actually had a conversation with us! Now everytime I go, I'll be searching for Katie. The service from her was SUPER. hehe"
Suzane C.,"Arcadia, CA",311,360,153,5.0,5/27/2010,"5 stars for the BEST RED VELVET CHEESCAKE ever!!!! OMG JUICY RED VELVET CHEESCAKE. I already love red velvet and cheescake and when you put it together comes out this awesome best ever dessert you will ever taste. I usually don't like cheescake factory's cheescake since it's either too sweet or too rich or too something. BUT, I am so confident anyone who tries this cheescake will love it. It's not too sweet and not too rich, it's just right and perfect and the red velvet is so soft and perfect. Anyway, the food here is always pretty good anyway but this dessert makes this place stand out a lot more than it used to. I never understood the hype and the long lines for this place before but I will definitely be coming back even just to get a TOGO of the cheescake. My partner got me a whole red velvet cheescake CAKE for my bday party which cost a lot hahah but it was sooooooooooooo good!!"
Lindsey N.,"Azusa, CA",1,12,2,4.0,9/19/2013,My favorite place to eat lunch wasnt impressed with the crab artichoke dip but other than that Ive yet to be disapointed!
Brandon B.,"Carson, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/20/2012,"Came here for a birthday lunch and never have I had a server so F'n rude. After getting our drinks and bread, we asked for butter and he grabbed some with his hands and just tossed it. On the table instead of putting it on a small plate. We would ask for something and he wouldn't acknowledge us and turn and walk away. When I ordered my meal, I asked for a Cajon Burger, he then said sorry, we don't have that, so I told it was on the menu, he told me, I'm sorry, it's  just people around here don't order that stuff.. First and last time with these people"
Widi S.,"Arcadia, CA",1,8,,5.0,12/22/2013,I would just like to say that the sauce that goes with the avocado egg rolls...is the best thing that ever happened to my LIFE I asked the waiter to let me take some home. It is THAT GOOD.  I also love the TURTLE cheesecake.  That is all I have to say about that.
Ji T.,"West Covina, CA",259,797,101,4.0,3/27/2013,"had the steak diane with something else combo...pretty good, the steak was amazing, a bit overpriced, you pay more for the ambiance than anything else the mashed potatoes that they give you was pretty good tho...definitely one of the best mashed potatoes out there...by FAR... asparagus tasted really fresh...idk how else to describe it... our friend ordered a cheesecake for his birthday, got the red velvet one....it was meh... service was great, server was on top of refilling the expensive strawberry lemonade that i got.... a bit overpriced for what you pay for but quality is still there"
Maruko X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1151,1703,12577,3.0,6/14/2012,"very convenient location in shopping mall, been here a few times, usually pretty good with food and service."
Jenny Z.,"Monrovia, CA",98,30,20,4.0,7/22/2012,"I came here last Sunday for the first time. I have to say the service was great, it took them a while to serve us but besides that everything tasted fantastic."
