Stuart S.,"El Monte, CA",217,416,53,2.0,9/27/2012,"It is a beautiful restaurant, and family friendly.  Unfortunately the past 2 times I have been here the food has been too salty!!  Thinking I was delusional I asked everyone at my table for their opinion -- and all their food was too salty as well.  It is too bad, but if my next visit the food is too salty I don't think I'll ever eat there again."
Daniel D.,"Arcadia, CA",19,24,3,4.0,5/24/2011,"My wife and I decided on an early date night. Let's make it Thursday instead of Friday since our weekend is looking psycho. It turns out that Thursday night is the night to go to this location. We walked in and were seated immediately. Wait? What's that? My wife is, by far, the healthier of the two of us in her eating habits. She ordered the weight management Asian chicken salad and had them add Mandarin oranges. This salad is her regular choice and she enjoys it immensely, especially with the added sweetness of the oranges. I ordered the Memphis burger. Pulled pork, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce on a burger. Basically it amounts to bliss in a bun. The coleslaw is slightly sweet, the BBQ sauce somewhat smokey, the pulled pork flavorful and juicy, the burger cooked to perfection (I like them well done, thank you), and everything together is just plain delicious. The fries were hot and delicious and made perfect vehicles for salt and ranch. The tropical tea is one of the main reasons I come here and it did not disappoint. Our server seemed to be training someone, so things were a bit bumpy there, but noting that caused us to take notice. Overall, an excellent experience. Now if I can just find some way to NOT be eating an entire day's worth of calories in one burger, I would be in much better shape."
Will T.,"Torrance, CA",198,95,11,1.0,1/12/2012,"Pro-Tip: There's an additional parking lot in the back that you can park in that's very close to the Cheesecake Factory. If I could leave a 0-star review I would and it's because of the General Manager, Justin Park. I find it very disturbing that someone in charge of the restaurant would be so rude and careless about customer service. I even told him that he should be fired and he agreed with me! I might expect that kind of apathy from a busser, but not the manager. Justin Park's actions were disgusting. I came here with my family (including my wheelchair bound grandmother) for a New Year's dinner. Apparently while I was in the restroom, there was a server switch. What resulted was us not getting service for over 20 minutes. We had to ask random people walking by for utensils and water refills. Finally someone in my family told me what had happened that I was finally able to talk to our new server and get better service.  Before Christmas, my girlfriend and I had also come in and bought a lot of cheesecakes for a Christmas party we were going to. We each decided on a piece that we wanted and took it with us. When we tried to eat it the next day, we noticed that they tasted funny, mostly the whipped cream. I called in and was told that if I brought them back that I could get them exchanged. When I gave them to my server, she was very nice and told me that I would have them waiting for me after dinner. Instead, I got Justin Park. He walked up to our table and stood right over my grandmother and stared down at us. He asked me for my receipt. Unlike him, I do not walk around carrying every receipt that I've ever received. I also doubt that I could have picked up Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes from anywhere else other than the Cheesecake Factory. He told me that he would not be exchanging my cheesecakes. The entire time, he was harassing my grandmother with his presence as I could see her becoming agitated. When I brought the slow service problem to the attention of Justin Park, his simple response was that they had a server switch. No apologies, no explanations. A rude ""this is how it is and that's that"". I exchanged a few more works with him and finally told him to leave so he wouldn't bother my grandmother anymore. I now have a very negative perception of Cheesecake Factory because one manager decided 2 pieces of Cheesecake were worth harassing a family over. I tipped more to my server than the value of those 2 pieces of cake. JUSTIN PARK SHOULD BE FIRED!"
Xinrui C.,"Arcadia, CA",235,18,,5.0,7/3/2011,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years and years and I've never been disappointed. The wait time is never long, service is great, food is amazing, and portions are hearty. I like to order burgers from them (smokehouse bbq burger, mmmm), although their pastas and other entrees are all delicious. I recommend their soups too, they are really thick, creamy and delicious. Love the portion size in this place, I am always filled up. Actually, I've always been so full by the end of my meal that I've never had enough room to actually order a cheesecake from them, haha. They bring out food really quickly too and the waiters/waitresses are always very helpful. Although it's a little pricey (around $15 a plate), the quality and portion size totally make it worth it. Not sure if other Cheesecake Factory's are this great, but I definitely love this place in particular and would recommend it to anyone."
Michael W.,"Omaha, NE",8,43,4,3.0,5/3/2009,"This was only my second visit to this chain.  It would have been my third, but the last time I tried to visit it was ridiculously crowded and I wasn't up to waiting a long time for lunch. It wasn't nearly as busy as I thought it would be today for lunch on a Sunday.  My wait was about 5 minutes.  Once seated, I had to wait a few minutes for my waiter to appear.  Once he showed, the service was great.   I ordered the Renee's Special, which is a sandwich, cup of soup, and salad.  I picked the chicken salad sandwich and it was tasty, though a bit greasy with too much mayo.  The soup today was some type of creamy broccoli.  It was a bit bland, and definitely not something I'd order again.  I spent an extra dollar and upgraded the salad to a caesar.  It was good, but nothing special.   The special was one of the cheapest things I saw on the menu, excluding appetizers.  Combined with an iced tea, I spent $15 before tip.  I would probably return if I happened to be hungry while I'm at the mall, but I wouldn't make a trip to the mall just to eat here as parking is usually horrific. I also second what someone else mentioned concerning the cheesecake.  If you want some, I'd recommend buying the entire cake.  One slice that I purchased to take home ran me $8.  The entire cake would be far more economical."
Ray W.,"San Dimas, CA",4,4,,1.0,10/31/2014,"It's been a few years since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, because the last time I found a dead fly in my salad at the one in Brentwood, which is now closed. Two days ago I visited the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia and ordered my favorite Shrimp Pasta. I was stunt that the shrimp in the pasta was less than the size of a quarter. What happened to the jumbo shrimps I used to enjoy so much time after time? I've had delicious finger size shrimps so many times before for about $17 in many Cheesecake Factories. Now it's still about the same price but the shrimps are so tiny and the quality has done down the toilet. It will be a while before I will eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Fair is fair, they still have the best cheesecakes in town."
Cherry K.,"Arcadia, CA",1,9,51,4.0,10/2/2014,"The food was good. A slice of cheese cake here was in a big size, but not heavy at all that I could finish all on my own.  We ordered a snack too, which was deep fried mushroom, avocado and cucumber. They provided mayonnaise and thousand island sauce on the side. The coat was crispy while it could keep its ingredients juicy inside. I like it a lot. I recommand the avocado with the mayonnaise instead of the thousand island sauce. They were more matched with each other. The waitress was friendly. She knew how to please customers by adding positive comments on what we ordered. Smile was always on her face. Just a little picky point was that, T the front desk was a bit messy. We were given a pager when we checked in. After the pager vibrated, we gave it to the staff. She told us to go to the left with a hand sign. We thought we could get in and get the table that was cleared. At last, we found out that we should wait for another staff to call our names, and lead us to the table. I was a first comer, so the regulation is quite unclear to me. It would be better if the one who take back our pager will be the one who serve us to the table."
Diana L.,"Pasadena, CA",48,148,69,4.0,6/26/2012,The avocado egg rolls are always a hit for an appetizer . I kept my meal really simple and had the BLT with avocado.  And what's up with the non stop advertising in the menu??
M C.,"San Jose, CA",125,127,2,3.0,1/13/2011,"Came here several times for various occasions. American/italian food. I usually get their da vinci pasta (entree) and buffalo blasts for appetizer. Also tried their salmon, a salad (forgot which one), and a vanilla cheesecake. The food is overall, heavy. Has a great deal of oil in it. My salmon plate was basically a small piece of salmon basking in an ocean of oil. Salad comes in huge portions. Share. Cheesecake... wasn't all that. It's just huge.  Props to the decor and ambiance."
Janet N.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,197,46,2.0,12/9/2009,"Hmm.. The food here is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory, so it's nothing to rave about. But THIS place is definitely operated by bitches. I've eaten here three times already and I always get those cold, rude gestures. They're mainly the female workers that gives such horrible service - the guys are a different thing, though - maybe it's because I'm a girl? Don't know, but whatever it is, service is trash here. I usually come when it's empty - so there's no excuse for such treatment!"
Jayson L.,"Covina, CA",16,41,14,5.0,5/31/2012,This place rocks.  I love all Cheesecake Factory's.  The price may seem a little on the high side but you get a lot for your money and you get high quality food.  Love it and will always go back.
Kath B.,"Monrovia, CA",1,18,,4.0,5/11/2013,"Came here twice on a Thursday. We got seated right away on both occasions. I tried their Rib-eye steak on my first visit and the steak diane on my second visit. The steak diane tasted good but the meat was so tough. The rib-eye steak was not bad but not the best either. Love their wheat bread especially when they are served fresh from the oven. Service was great, portions were big, waiters/waitresses were very attentive and friendly, place had a good ambiance but prices were a bit high. Good for special occasions only."
Alvin P.,"Torrance, CA",1,15,,4.0,7/3/2013,"I love this Cheese Cake Factory.  I go here for special occasions.  I guess that's a fairly strong indicator of my classiness, or lack there of but I don't mind.  The truth is I have simple tastes; I like the decor and ambiance here, it's owned by the same company that owns the Grand Lux Cafe so pretty similar in every aspect.   The menu is vast and frankly it can be hard to know what to order so I keep it simple by always ordering the same thing: Miso Salmon.  It's absolutely delicious, you can choose between white and brown rice as a pedestal for the delectable salmon.  Comes with a crown of nice crunchy snow peas and two sauces, a white one and a brown one both of which are pretty awesome. I always order mine as rare as possible. (i'm a sashimi fan) and i've never been disappointed with it.    The brown bread they serve with butter is by far my favorite. soooo good. Sometimes i'm tempted to go there and just eat bread. The cheesecakes they serve are numerous and all very good.  My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle.  oh my gosh!  You cannot go wrong with that. It's a bit expensive but the slices are quite big, I rarely finish mine despite the fact that it's so good.  The best thing about this location is that Christine works here.  What an awesome server!  She always remembers me when i come in and she greets me and my guests even when we're not seated in her section.  She's constantly smiling and pleasant to chat with and she's attentive and expeditious with the order.  She knows i love the bread and she always brings me all brown bread with extra butter. (cause i love butter too) I've had all good experiences with the other servers as well. I give this location two thumbs way up!  All the hostesses here are breathtaking, the food is pretty good and the service is always great."
Linda H.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,123,116,5.0,3/22/2010,"Got myself the LUAU salad. Crispy wontons with a great crunch and their soup of the day the Broccoli and Cheese. The soup tasted soo good. Very thick yes but it felt like you were eating pure broccoli so its more healthy. Tasted soo yummy, I wanted to lick the bowl. Did i?? NOOOOOO! I said wanted to ...haah Not as much cheese and water like some places I have been to. Some places are pretty watered down. Tasted more like broccoli and a hint of cheese. Man it was soo good! ORDER IT!  Waitress was super nice. Too bad i don't know her name. She didn't introduce herself. They were very accommodating and helpful when ordering. GOOD FOOD thank you!"
Critique D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,51,8,5.0,10/17/2010,"This is my favorite chain restaurant, though a little pricey I am always satisfied with my meal.  My favorite salad is the Santa Fe Chicken, it has black beans, corn, tomato's, cheese, romaine lettuce with crunchy tortilla chips on top. The kicker is the dressing, it is a cilantro peanut vinaigrette, OMG it is sooo yummy and the portions are huge so if you can order the lunch size it can easily feed two! I haven't' had a better dressing yet! There are so many dishes to choose from it can be over whelming.  Try the fried mac and cheese balls w/ marinara sauce, sooo good. If you are looking for a sweet drink with a kick (liquor) try the Georgia Peach!"
Kim U.,"Monterey Park, CA",58,5,,2.0,2/27/2011,"Are the dish washers on strike?  I've eaten at this location before. Today may be the last time I'll go here. My bread plate was dirty. We ordered a plate of pancakes and the waiter gave us an extra plate to make it easier to share and that plate was also dirty.  I then ordered the energy breakfast which includes scrambled egg whites, chicken breast with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes. The egg whites which I thought would be a healthier choice was cooked in a major amount of oil. The chicken was okay. The steak knife given was again DIRTY. You can literally feel remains of oil on the knife. The waiter should at least look at the plates and utensils before setting them on the table.   Breakfast here is way overpriced!"
Edgar C.,"Pasadena, CA",1069,43,62,1.0,4/12/2012,"I normally don't eat at these kind of places.  I've been to other locations and I found an item I liked so I decided to try the Arcadia location........bad experience.  I ordered on the phone and asked if they had the curve side service and they said ""yes we bring your food to your car"".   I arrived, called them but they put me on hold for over 15 minutes and I had to park and get out of my car to get my food.  They gave me a bunch of excuses.  Definitely not the service they say they provide.  My first time at that location and the last.  I am willing to pay for the service but when the service is bad or not what I want....why to go back?"
Priscilla C.,"San Gabriel, CA",2,38,,4.0,6/17/2011,"I'm a fan of cheesecake---been going to their restaurant for YEARS. First on the westside, then in old town pas and now in arcadia. Love their drinks---smoothies are delish and their bellinis are yummy. Service varies but we usually get a decent waiter---on a few rare occasions we've gotten some strugglers, but mostly some good folks. Not a big fan of their Sunday brunch menu but I do love their lunch/dinner. Usually chicken marsala is my go-to dish but I've sampled alot of their menu. Their salmon has recently been one of my faves, it's always cooked to perfection when I've ordered it. Be prepared to spend some money here, it's not cheap---maybe if you order their lunch specials but even then including drinks you won't be paying $10 bucks---but usually I don't mind because the food delivers for me as well as their desserts. Yes, most of the time there is a wait especially in the evenings/weekends. I've come here early weekday around lunch or after lunch but before dinner rush and it hasn't been so bad but it's quite the popular place. Can't really say too many negative things about them. I recommend!"
Kaelin C.,"Arcadia, CA",4,30,11,5.0,8/18/2013,"I go to The Cheesecake Factory when we're at the mall and I'm STARVING. By far I would rate this a whopping 5 stars. Well, the cheesecake ROCKS THE HOUSE! I also heard that the plushies are kinda cute too. Some say stuff about cheesecake and they're just like a souvenir! You should try it. It's really good! EAT CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! :P"
Evelyn G.,"Rosemead, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/26/2012,"I came here with one friend for dinner. We ordered 2 appetizers that served as our dinner meal. The waiter said "" that's it? that's all you're having?"" gave us dirty looks and took our menus hastily. apparently we didn't order enough food. This made our experience TERRIBLE! We were so caught up in his rudness we didn't care for the food, we just took it to go and left, and oh was he happy we made that seat for 2 available. ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS PLACE!"
