Stephanie Y.,"Pasadena, CA",105,223,141,1.0,9/28/2012,"I just HAD to come and write a review after my horrible experience there last weekend!!  I usually go to the one in Old Town Pasadena, but since we were planning on watching a movie at 10, we decided to eat at this one.   When we arrived a little before 8, we were told there would be a 20 min wait which we were fine with.  When we were eventually seated, our waiter brought us drinks and bread and then he disappeared.  He literally did not once come back to our table for 15-20 minutes.  It wasn't until i was actually ABLE to wave someone down, and told him no one had come to take our order in 15min did our waiter FINALLY come back -- seriously??  You can imagine my frustration at this point so when our food came, it was a big relief.  I ordered the mushroom burger, I believe, which came with nothing but mushrooms so I had to request tomatoes and lettuce which he graciously brought to me.  My bf ordered the shepherd's pie which he enjoyed.  But honestly my complaint is no where even regarding the food.   So when we were done with our meal, once again, could not find out waiter.  So when he did finally come to our table, we made sure to just give him everything at once.  We didn't even look at the bill, just handed him our credit card, told him we needed boxes and placed our dessert order.  We couldn't risk him disappearing on us again!  But even with that, he took forever to even bring our dessert.  The bill was already signed, our food was already packed up and still no dessert.  It was literally 9:55pm and by then we just had to ask him to box it up since it hadn't even arrived yet!  You might be thinking that it was a busy night-- that would be a good explanation.  But literally by the time we had got our food, the restaurant was starting to clear out.  STILL TOOK FOREVER.  A meal for two took over 1.5 hours and we didn't even have time to eat dessert.  Honestly the slowest service I have received."
Alexandra L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",28,21,3,5.0,4/22/2012,This Cheesecake Factory is amazing! The service is good. The food is even better. It's good for any occasion and the red velvet cake is just heaven in your mouth.
Mary T.,"Altadena, CA",1,65,1,1.0,10/17/2014,"I just had a salad today and the salad greens were beat up, some slimy pieces, clearly old, not even rinsed and washed but just poured out of a bag. A very few pieces of chewy asparagus, some terrible tasting beets (I love beets). I ate the goat cheese and pecans. What a waste of ten bucks. I don't think I will ever risk a salad there again."
Patrick P.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2013,"Too loud....was seared next to a ledge party and of course they let the kids scream and run wild....ruined the whole meal L....I joked to the very nice waitress...""when does Outback close"".........she said she was sorry"
Craig C.,"La Mirada, CA",0,11,1,4.0,7/19/2011,"When you walk into this Cheesecake Factory, you're immediately struck by its spaciousness and  ultra-modern decor.  Also, this location is adjacent to a great mall and several high end stores, which adds to the appeal (what other Cheesecake Factory regularly has Aston Martins being valet parked out front?)  For me, these things make this location the ""pick of the litter"" if I'm in the mood for the Cheesecake Factory. As all of the other posters have said, the menu has literally anything and everything you could possibly want to eat on it (over 200 entrees, I am told), which makes it a great place if you don't really know what you want. Unlike most restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory does not have a signature entree (only their signature dessert), so the food is basically part of a ""cast your net wide so that we can get them to eat the Cheesecake"" strategy (clever!).  I had the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Pizza with a side Caesar Salad, which was definitely delicious. Of course, no review of the Cheesecake Factory would be complete without a review of the cheesecake...I have to admit that I skipped their signature dessert on this visit because I was stuffed, but I've had it several times before and I can tell you unreservedly that it's absolutely incredible. Bottom Line:  For a chain sit-down restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory has enough variety to keep you from ever getting bored of their food, and the dessert will help you leave with a smile on your face."
Momma V.,"Riverside, CA",56,81,25,4.0,9/8/2012,"Good food, large portions, great selection of beverages and ample parking since it's at a mall. A bit noisy if you're looking for a quiet place to talk with a girlfriend but a great place if you're with a lively group. Prices are fair too."
Mark D.,"La Crescenta, CA",8,90,80,3.0,9/24/2009,"In short...  RED VELVET CHEESECAKE = 5 stars!! PS. Everything else is ""Eh."""
Danny S.,"Arcadia, CA",1,10,,3.0,7/7/2013,"Well, I came here for my birthday. I left pretty unhappy. The food was ok at best, but the service was on the bad side. Our waitress was really bored, and wasn't very attentive. She didn't check on us except to order food. It took her ten minutes to get me another menu so I could order an appetizer that came AFTER my food. What's the point of an appetizer then? The food took a while to come, but at least it somewhat satisfied in that department.  The chicken enchiladas were decent, but when they stated it came with a ""side"" of beans I didn't assume they filled half the plate with beans! Looks like I'm not coming here for my birthday again."
Brant N.,"San Gabriel, CA",8,11,1,1.0,12/20/2009,"I hate to say it, but this is the WORST place to eat in Old Town Pasadena. I'd rather split a ham sandwich in an alley with the homeless man who always has his cat with him! I've patroned Cheesecake Factory on colorado three times, each experience worse than the one before. The last two times I didn't even get my food it took so long. The last time I even asked ""I need to get back to work in a hour and will need my food within 30 minutes, is that OK?"" 50 minutes later I was out the door with a bill for food I never got. If you have less than two hours to wait JUST TO GET YOUR FOOD, then don't waste your time. Hell don't waste your time at all with all the great choices to eat at in Pasadena!  There is no reason to patron a place who doesn't respect their customers enough to give polite or timely service! Neither myelf nor my coworkers will ever visit this location again and I won't be sorry to see your doors close forever!"
A K.,"Pasadena, CA",15,42,22,2.0,6/17/2014,Ok here's the thing I have a problem with. I can't make reservations and I can't get a table for a party of 8 till at least 1/2 are here but they have the damn table reserved. Why can't I just go sit at the table so i can have a drink and get some bread. I'm not going to any Cheesecake Factory with a party any more...Not worth my time plus I can go to other restaurants where it may take a few minutes before they seat me .
Regina C.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,25,5,1.0,1/8/2013,"I went there last night (Monday night) and it was NOT crowded at all.  I went with my brother and sister; and we ordered one appetizer and three entrees.  It took them maybe 10 mins to bring us the crabcakes, and 45mins to bring out the Steak Diane, Chicken Pasta and Chicken Piccata.  Seriously? 45mins???  Our waitress disappeared for a while and maybe 35mins into the wait, she FINALLY came to us and told us our food was coming. The table next to us got there five mins before we got our food, and their food arrived 15mins after they placed the order  (Trust me, I timed them.)  But seriously?  That was a very long wait, I was falling asleep.  I will NOT go back to this Cheesecake Factory."
John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,218,12,1.0,11/19/2012,"Have a food allergy?  Don't come here.  After specifically telling the waitress about a garlic and onion allergy (two different people), both people got garlic and onion in their food.  Apparently the runner grabbed the wrong food in the kitchen.  Both of the people in our party ended up getting sick."
Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,3.0,5/3/2012,"Our experience here was pretty typical. Our wait was about 25 minutes. If we waited any longer we would have given up and eaten at the nearby by food court, Paris baguette or Dave & Busters. I always get the shrimp bistro pasta. They have like 99 other things on the menu, but I can't seem to give anything else a try. I just LOVE this pasta! It comes with spaghetti in a buttery garlic sauce, lightly breaded shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes and topped off with a bed of arugula (YUUUUMMMM). But I did order the shrimp pops and they were excellent! My son loves their fish and chips. Taste like H-salt but better!  The bread and butter they place on the table before your meal is addictive so be careful. I really wish they'd bring back the pecan pie cheesecake. If you see it you gotta order it! The service was OK. We were seated outside and it got kind of chilly, and they kindly lit the heat lamps. Overall, pretty cool experience."
Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",23,91,65,4.0,5/10/2008,"Must try: banana cream cheesecake luau salad chicken, mushroom, roasted garlic pizza avocado egg rolls thai chicken pasta white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake unavoidable: long wait a bit pricey **lunch specials are more worth it than dinner prices"
John L.,"Cerritos, CA",1028,162,475,4.0,6/17/2011,Omg there speical is call dynamite shrimp is soo good
Aaron M.,"Alhambra, CA",10,41,2,4.0,5/2/2010,We came for a friend's birthday and the wait was relatively fast considering the large group we had.  The food is pretty pricey but they do have a lot of items on the special menu.  I ordered the Chicken Tostada Salad because of the amazing reviews from others.  To my amazement I was quiet happy with the dish.   Then for dessert my friend ordered the red velvet cheesecake.  After the first bite I've seriously become a huge fan of cheesecake factory's desserts.  It was a bit on the sweat side but the cheesecake packed a huge punch with sweetness and deliciousness.
Diego M.,"West Covina, CA",215,115,191,4.0,2/3/2012,"I always enjoy eating here, service is great-The food is always good. the mojito's they have here I could live without. But nonetheless-great place."
Frank D.,"South Pasadena, CA",14,111,1,4.0,8/28/2010,"Good but not as organized as the Pasadena location, ie total of 3 waiters/tresses for our meal. Uhhm yah. The meal was excellent and the best bang for your buck when dining out. Hope to come back but when they are not busy."
Jason R.,"Victorville, CA",173,9,,5.0,5/12/2013,"Great food and friendly service there j.w pink lemonade is bomb and there white chicken chili is off the hook , pastas are great too recommend it to anyone."
Kayla B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,2,4.0,1/3/2013,"I came here on a Thursday night with my family of seven and had to wait about thirty minutes because they do not take reservations. I absolutely love the bread they give out. My family was starving by the time we got seated so we basically got full from the bread because they give free refills too. They're baked fresh and you can even order some to take home! We got the chicken salad, shepard's pie, spinach dip, farfalle pasta, salmon, and jambalaya. The jambalaya was too spicy for some of us but i thought it was one of the best dishes because it came with both chicken and shrimp! We were all too full to indulge in some desserts, but they always have new flavors so that's something to try next time!"
