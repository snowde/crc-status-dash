D C.,"San Gabriel, CA",332,16,30,4.0,8/12/2010,"This place has pretty nice interior design.  Also, this restaurant has a lot of indoor and outdoor seatings.  Wait time during dinner is about 10-15 minutes if you are lucky. Very typical menu selection for American dishes. I ordered the steak and it was nicely prepared.  Food did take a while to come. When it gets busy, the waiter hardly pays attention to you, so order all you can while they are attending you.   Love their drinks. YOU WOULD Defnitely want to try their drinks!!"
Gram L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,3.0,5/4/2013,"Came here for an early dinner w/ family. I took a day off and ordered a nonsalad plate. The spicy chicken tacos & small side veggie salad was stellar,really, but I couldn't eat all three corn tortillas (for dietary reasons). The plates themselves take lots of space! It's like go big or go home type of thing. They could add a dessert under 570 calorie menu like they do for some dishes.   I'm always curious about menu options for kids, because best eating and dental practices for life start young!  Well options are boring,dull, UNHEALTHY- mostly foods of white flour.  The service was quick, lots of servers, two waiters. We give good tips when we eat out, but despite the quick service, something tells me that good tips are no longer expected."
Anney L.,"Alhambra, CA",6,13,77,1.0,12/18/2009,"I don't have good experiences at Cheesecake Factory already but this location just made me realized I shouldn't return under any circumstances. The server was rude and the foods are terrible. She kept coming back to rush us to order the drinks, appetizers, then entrees so you can get out of there ASAP. If you are in a rush and don't care what you are eating then this is a place for you. We went as party of 8, to celebrate a friend's birthday. We ordered 3 appetizer and 5 entree to share. 3 out 5 entree are pasta, the pasta are very salty. We told our waitress about it then she came back with an attitudes and said the pasta are perfectly fine. She offered us to order something else on the menu but the foods are so salty so we asked for the check. We waited 15-25 mins wondering where was our check then realized she left the check on our table without notifying any of us. We left Cheesecake Factory and went somewhere else to finished our dinner."
Simon P.,"Montclair, CA",120,80,10,2.0,4/24/2014,"I went in for dinner after a long 12 hour shift for my 6 year anniversary dinner and received the worst service I have ever experienced. My special moment I wanted with my Fiancé was ruined because we were both upset with the attitude from our waiter Steven. I was very thirsty and after drinking my first glass of water, I waited fifteen minutes for my next glass of water. He then walked up and asked how was my meal and before I can finish telling him that my wings were cold. He was already walking away. Like Really? I would completely understand if he was busy but it was 9:55 and  the place was empty. I also wanted to order a cheese cake to go but I could not tolerate his lack of interest of doing his job any longer. I think your waiters in the bar area are always very nice and hostess always respectful. Steven was just terrible. in todays job economy there are plenty of people who would love his job and do a lot better for your company. However the salad was very good! One of the best salads I have ever had!"
Anthony T.,"Temple City, CA",175,24,221,4.0,7/31/2012,"Came here with friends on a birthday on a friday night. Had to wait for 2 hours for a table but hey, it's a friday night and it's part of a shopping center. As soon as we were seated, we were treated with so much courtesy. The staff was great, funny, and attentive to everyone. Foodwise, the portions are about right for the price you're paying and they do give you a lot of bread if you ask for it."
Julie M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/3/2013,"Ate here for the first time last night for my sister's birthday dinner. Herb crusted salmon was delicious. Our server, Hannah, was amazing. She kept our table of 9, ages 9 to 82 all happy. She was smiling and engaging all the time and accommodated our every need. Cheesecakes were outstanding. Key lime was heavenly."
George B.,"Northridge, CA",0,16,1,5.0,2/2/2013,Lee or Cody. Cody or Lee. The most incredibly kind and warm servers. Ever. REQUEST THEM.
Yessi V.,"Pasadena, CA",46,61,13,3.0,12/5/2009,"Three stars because this place is always packed! The waiting time is always about 30 mins. And the customer service is bad!!!!!!!!!!  Besides that, the food is good. Loved their salmon with rice, it was tender and juicy..just the way I like it. I also love their chicken sandwich with avocado its perfect! Also the wheat bread they give u, its pretty good also. Love their cheesecakes they are made to perfection!"
Brandon C.,"Arcadia, CA",60,29,,4.0,3/19/2013,"The food here is generally pretty good.  I usually order their pasta dishes like the Pasta Da Vinci or the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms.  There salads are really good such as the BBQ chicken salad.  I like the lunch portions a lot better because of they are smaller sizes and the prices are more reasonable.  The dinner portions are usually way too big and slightly pricey.  Overall a great atmosphere for parties like birthdays, but it can get a bit noisy in the restaurant.  So if you take a date and want to have a nice conversation, this is not the place to go.  They usually will bring a basket of bread with butter when you sit down.  The soft drinks can be a little pricey, usually upwards of $3.  The good part are the cheesecakes (duh?)  I love the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  The best!"
B. Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",23,236,14,4.0,5/10/2012,"My love for The Cheesecake Factory is like a boomerang.  It used to be one of my favorite chain restaurants, and then I started disliking it and hadn't gone in a number of years.  But they're starting to bring me back and I'm starting to like it again. This location is usually pretty crowded, but Sunday brunch was really quiet.  My latte really hit the spot, although it was odd that it was served in a tall glass normally used for iced drinks when I ordered it hot.  I really enjoyed the baja chicken hash--crisp tortillas topped with a hash of potatoes, chicken breast, chorizo, chiles, and corn.  Topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.  It was quite rich, like most of Cheesecake Factory's food. Mmm, I could really go for a slice of a nice citrusy/lemony cheesecake right now."
Jeff Z.,"Rosemead, CA",9,41,,4.0,7/22/2010,"This place is pretty clean, nothing dirty.  I ordered the Chicken and avocado club which was pretty good. A big portion, I only could eat half of it.  All the sandwiches comes with fries or salad which is a plus for me! When you get settled down on a table, you get free bread (white & wheat) I never ate dessert here as I always got full from my main dish.  There is a lot of parking and there is also a parking structure."
quinzy t.,"Alhambra, CA",1,6,47,1.0,1/20/2014,This is the worst cheese cake factory ever!!!  They have gotten my orders wrong a few times...and the last visit I was there I found a piece of HAIR in my burger!!!  GROSS!!!!   I will never go to this cheese cake ever again!!    Cheese cake in Pasadena is way better!
Rolando A.,"Alhambra, CA",1,4,,4.0,10/28/2012,"My first time going was literally 2 days ago, and from what i experienced, i'd like to go back again ^_^.  The only thing i would say that's slightly negative is that they're a bit pricey; but the food tastes great and their cheesecakes are very good, which makes up for it lol I'm definitely coming back again."
Baback D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1286,229,61,2.0,11/29/2009,"Before you all think I'm just hating, please read the whole review.  In my opinion, this is one of the best chains (and it seems like one of the most successful) of restaurants out there. I've always loved Cheesecake factory! The food, especially considering the ridiculously and maybe even overly exaggerated menu selections usually always taste fantastic, and their consistently the same, any location you go to! Amazing ambiance, usually good service and again, awesome food. With all that being said...the last time my girlfriend and I went, we were seated outside and waited for at LEAST 30 minutes until we finally just got up and left. I'm sorry, service (and very rarely...food) comes first! How many times have you frequented a business with excellent service but with only mediocre products? Bad service leaves a bad taste in my mouth, sorry. Ironically, I think the fact that Cheesecake Factory prides themselves on good service it maybe the very reason I give them 2 stars. I mean I may give McDonalds five stars even if I get bad service...because I don't goto McDonalds for them to smile at me...I go for the fries!!!"
Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",638,502,122,4.0,3/26/2010,"I usually come here for their lunch specials, and cheesecake of course. When I'm in a salad mood, I prefer the Luau Salad because it's like a fruity salad in your mouth-- it's filled with walnuts, sweet sauce, wonton chips(?), and some fruits. I really really really enjoy this cause it's absolutely delicious and huge. When I'm in a pasta mood, I prefer the Chicken Bellagio. It has two fried chicken breasts, some sort of yummy ham with spinach, and a whole lotta pasta. THIS DISH WILL DEFINITELY FILL YOU UP, cause when I'm done with this dish I feel absolutely conquered. As for their cheesecakes, I prefer the Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake. It has some cheesecake and carrotcake mixed together. Out of most of the time, I prefer this cheesecake. Overall, I do enjoy Cheesecake Factory for their lunch portions because it's not too expensive."
Kenneth T.,"Los Angeles, CA",520,279,31,3.0,4/17/2009,"Cheesecake Factories are known to have atrocious wait times, but this one wasn't as bad. Plus, it is right in front of the Santa Anita mall so it makes waiting more bearable. Once you get it there, the atmosphere is not the best. Like the other locations, this places is really dark, like they don't want you to see your food. God knows what is in there. The food is pretty good, but for waiting 30 minutes and them charging $20 a dish in this economy, I expected more. One good pick is the Shrimp scampi and the chicken sandwich was delicious. Do not get a salad here. Why get a salad at this place? Go for the seafood and end your night with a cheesecake. The cheesecake is flavorful, but buy the whole cake instead of the slice (it is not worth it). Pretty much, the worst part of Cheesecake is the wait. It is really painful to wait here. Last time, it took me 30 minutes to drive there, drove around for 15 minutes for parking, waited 45 minutes for a table, and 30 minutes for my food to come. So pretty much it took my whole night. Two hours dedicated to getting warm food, and a $100 plus for 4 adults. Anything should taste good at this point. However, it was still not as bad as the Grove location, because I waited there for 75 minutes. With so many food choices in this area, I recommend the barbeque house next to it if you are as impatient as me."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,375,844,4.0,1/25/2010,"One of my favorite places to dine in when I'm in the neighborhood. The staff is extremely friendly and I'm still impressed by the little remotes they hand you in case there's a wait for a table on a busy night (especially on weekends). It vibrates and flashes when a table is ready for you and your party. Whether you come by yourself, with a date, or with a large group, the service is always impeccable and the atmosphere is classy but somewhat loud. The hostesses may not be warm, but every waitress/waiter I've had were upbeat and helpful.  The food here is excellent and anything you order comes in VERY generous portions for the price you pay relative to other restaurants. I can never finish a plate of food by myself and neither can most of my friends. My usual (& safe order) would be the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. It's exactly what the name says but without the word ""delicious,"" but don't bite into the tomatoes expecting something sweet because they're pretty sour. I've also had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich that comes with fries. It's served cut into two pieces and the sandwich itself is too big for me to take an actual bite out of it so it's a little messy to eat. I have to actually plan and work at eating it without getting pieces inside the sandwich from spewing out. Also, it's a very filling meal so it's probably best to share with a special someone or just a friend. If not, ask for the check and the waiter/waitress will happily box it up for you to-go! Just be careful with the sandwich though because the sauce soaks up into the bread really quickly, and before you know it, you'll have a soggy sandwich."
Natalie A.,"Pasadena, CA",192,9,,5.0,11/3/2012,"Best corn tamales with Cilantro sauce, topped with tomatoes and avocados, for only $10.99 dollars, it's a meal on it's own with Chipotle Sauce. Avocado Rolls, and Hawaiin rolls are very good.  You can get these three dishes for $5.00 dollars during happy hour during the week check for times, specially during this time change. Right now its between 4-7 p.m. great dealls"
Jennifer B.,"Alhambra, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/4/2014,"Five stars for the service. Miguel was a great server, had a great beard and was super cute. Can someone please give him my number? Haha. Had the chinese chicken salad... should have ordered the shrimp tacos instead per his recommendation."
Will G.,"Monrovia, CA",0,6,3,4.0,8/5/2011,"Hit this place up on 8/4/11 for a late dinner.  First off, kudos cuz the place is always open a bit later than most places, for those of us that don't eat dinner at 5 in the evening like 70 year olds.  No offense.    I've always been a fan of this place since first going a few years ago, but i only seem to go once or twice a year.  Why you ask?  Because as most people know, most of the dishes are in the 1500-2000 calorie range, but hey, everything I've ever had here is effin amazing!  I decided to mix it up a bit and stray from my normal order of Jambalya and tried a more heart/calorie friendly meal and ordered the Energy Breakfast.  All in all, pretty impressive.  An all egg white scramble with roasted chicken breast, spinach and mushrooms.  Its by far the healthiest thing I've found on the menu and go figure, its located in the back of the menu, at the very bottom of the breakfast section, hiding...  But at 600 calories, this high protein meal is perfect for those health nuts that never want to eat out.  Oh, another good thing about showing up for the late dinner, the place was kinda empty so the service was awesome.   Now on to dessert, that heavenly dessert.  You may be wondering why someone who is looking for the healthiest thing on the menu is even commenting on dessert.  Well, I'm that skinny guy that everyone hates that orders the double cheeseburgers with extra bacon, but drinks a diet coke to save the calories.  Sacrifice here, indulge over there.   I saw a picture of this Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake online a few weeks back and thought to myself  ""Self, thats gonna have to happen"".  And man did it happen.  Its the perfect size to actually split with like 3-4 people so everyone gets about 3-4 bites, and it is amazing, smooth, creamy, not too sweet.  You could taste the difference between the cake portion and the cheese portion.  It mixed perfectly (there's a picture of it on here somewhere) If your at all a fan of cheesecake and red velvet cake, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!  I may have to take a slice home..."
