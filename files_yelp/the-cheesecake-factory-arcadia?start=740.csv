Shanshan H.,"San Marino, CA",28,58,81,5.0,2/12/2012,"I love come here when I get some of those blue days, and it can surely bright me up. Sometimes I came here alone, but most times it's good for groups. Try their Vietnamese Tacos! The meat is so tender and the bun! So floury and delicious. We don't call it a decent US. restaurant like Lang-ham Hotel or Queen Mary, but their food are really made of decent materials. However, I'm actually not a big fan of their cheesecake just because it has too many calories and I'm always on diet! :D"
Lee E.,"El Monte, CA",258,206,691,4.0,12/28/2009,Food is overpriced. I'd rather eat next door at woodranch. Then I'd come over for their cheesecake. Anything with Oreos is bombayyyyy. Anyway. Just come for desserts. So good that it makes up for grrible food. Fish sucks steak sucks. Drinks are standard for a finer diner. Just desserts.
Inigo M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,2400,69,3.0,3/15/2012,No deviation from usual Cheesecake experience-- generally decent food and service.
Anila A.,"Long Beach, CA",87,75,7,4.0,4/26/2012,"Usually, I only go to Cheesecake Factory for their... cheesecakes. But yesterday, my boss and a few co-workers were invited to have dinner to celebrate Administrative Professionals Day (I didn't know we kinda people had those days! The rest of the calendar year is Step on Your Admins Day). We were greeted fairly well by one of the waitresses and was promptly seated thereafter. Our waiter, Casey or Keith was very nice and patient with our party of 8. He helped each and every one of us as we slowly trickled in. The strawberry lemonade was delicious, I stayed away from the complimentary bread and butter (need to shape up!), but ordered the salad and shrimp creole off of the skinnylicious menu (which by the way, I love!). The salad was a great size because it kept me from eating the entire entree. The entree size was enormous, but I knew if I didn't have that salad before, I would have eaten the whole thing! It was scrumptious! We then ordered cheesecake for ourselves and do I have to say anything else? It was so good (I only had a bite and saved the rest for my brother back at home--he could eat a horse and still weigh 120lbs). I would definitely come back to this Cheesecake Factory!"
Danielle K.,"Arcadia, CA",0,11,4,5.0,4/21/2014,"My family and I went out to dinner here this past weekend. Our server Eric was amazing, very on top of things and friendly. Our food was amazing [we were all so full we did not have enough room for desert =( Lol.] and overall we had great experience! =)"
Mary M.,"Arcadia, CA",15,14,,4.0,11/21/2012,"My husband tried the Cheesecake Factory last Saturday night.  It was packed!  We waited for about 35 minutes and got a nice table.  The food was delicious!  We ordered skinny shrimp tacos and cajun chicken.  The menus is long, so it took some time to decide.  We shared a piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake.  My favorite dessert ever!  Umm-umm-umm!"
Nicole L.,"Chino Hills, CA",22,165,64,4.0,5/22/2012,"We dine there for our early Mother's Day celebration, sat there for 2 hours just waiting for all parties to arrives (there was some kind of major accident on the 10 FWY that day which cause a huge delay), waitress and rest of staff are so patience and nice to us, even we occupied the table for two hours without ordering....I will definitely return and bring friends to this place."
Ken M.,"Rowland Heights, CA",156,51,10,5.0,12/16/2011,"Came here for the first time, and I have to say I am amazed at the customer service I received. Everything was exactly what I ordered and they constantly paid attention to me and came to check up on me for refills and more bread. My server's name is Carlos G and he was definitely the best server I have seen in a while. Deserves a visit and definitely if you get Carlos as your server, he deserves a good tip."
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,4.0,12/17/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. With this location, I usually don't wait long, service is good, and we just do drinks and appetizers. We got the sampler or whatever that was and it was HUGE! Don't ever get that for 2 people.  MUST ORDER PEACH BELLINIS! OH SO ORGASMIC! MMM MM M MMM MMMM MMMMMM :)"
Franklin O.,"Pasadena, CA",173,118,152,4.0,3/7/2010,"Where do I start? Okay the pros: If you come for breakfast on the weekends yes very good selection and tasty, if come during linch they now have a smaller menu and prices are good too Cons: if you com for dinner and you have to wait to be seated well expect the rest of the evening will be like that too. The managers are A&@-h!?es. So if you have a problem with your dish it better off you eat the hair on your plate than to deal with them!! Plus side: The cheese cake they are famous for this. And yes if you have room this is a place to have some."
Jayson L.,"CA, CA",5,32,23,4.0,4/15/2012,You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake factory. This location on Baldwin Ave is no exception. The food is good especially the thai lettuce wraps and the service. Of course service varies depending on the server you get.
Cherie T.,"San Diego, CA",907,1022,650,4.0,4/16/2009,"everytime i dine at cheesecake factory (any of their locations) i have a good time. yes it gets pretty loud and you can barely hear your friends talking and end up shouting across table, but overall it's a comfortable place.  my all time favorites are as follows: their brown bread - i usually just tell them to only bring out their brown bread. santa fe salad chipotle chicken pasta vanilla bean cheesecake - it's light. not too sweet and heavy like....for example... the godiva one, that one, i literally need milk to eat w/ it.  try to avoid fri / sat nights.. if u do come on those nights.. come early!"
Sherry V.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,228,,4.0,11/17/2011,"It's good for what it is and all the variety that comes with it. The pastas are generally all delicious. I always get the Fettucine w/ Chicken & Sundried Tomatoes. I highly recommend the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, but it might a lil heavy. Cajun Jambalaya is another recommended. I've tried the Navajo before and it's this fry-bread which is good but so greasy that you feel guilty. Their crabcakes are decent-- but obviously it's not fresh. And I'm a BIG fan of their Tiramisu cheesecake. Can't leave the factory without getting it!"
Kat O.,"Azusa, CA",35,89,70,5.0,4/15/2013,"This was my first time to the Arcadia Location and my sister and I arrived around 4pm after a Conkerr Cancer event in Pasadena and I'll admit I thought there would be a long wait with so many people there and waiting, but this restaurant is run like a well oiled machine, we were seated in abt 10 min and it just better and better from there. We had Nanor H as our server and she was very friendly quick and attentive to all of our needs. After our Asian Lettuce Wrap taco appetizers and of course the delicious bread, my sister had the  Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken, and I had the Tuscan Chicken , the portions were large enough to take over half of our plates home for today:) I also ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake and she ordered Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake already in to go boxes (although we did take a few bites there.)What can I say the food and dessert absolutely just melt in your mouth:) I wish we had taken pictures of the delicious fare but trust me , I dont think it's possible to be disappointed here. I will definitely return and give gift cards to reward some of my family and friends.Great experience and again I wish to thank Nanor H. for the exceptional customer service! I highly recommend!"
m c.,"Arcadia, CA",14,369,7,2.0,12/5/2013,"What happen to the portion sizes??  Even the slices of cheesecake have shrunk! Just like claim jumpers, serving size decreases but prices remain the same :(  They also got rid of one of the cheaper sandwiches which happen to be my favorite..the Navajo.  Used to be my favorite restaurant but no longer.  Not worth the price."
Min T.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,2158,544,2.0,11/17/2008,"There are just some restaurant battles you cannot win. When my friends wanted to go to lunch, the initial suggestion was Sizzler. You can imagine the ""debate"" that ensued.  Just when I thought I was going to burst into tears with despair, I gave in to Cheesecake Factory. I figured they can't eff up a salad, right? When we arrived, there wasn't a wait. And they accommodated our request to lower the shade. This meant all the shades had to be lowered so the entire dining area went dim. Hm, what a ""romantic"" lunch with my friends and their baby.  Our server was nice enough. She went on break for a while and another took over. They brought out all the things we needed fairly quickly though I questioned why they needed to bring salad dressing 25 minutes before our meals arrived.  I ordered the avocado rolls for an appetizer. I can't help but love those things. This Cheesecake Factory didn't fry them enough for me as the wrapper wasn't that crispy but then again, I appreciated the avocado wasn't a burning hot oozing mess.  I also had the chopped vegetable salad with chicken. There wasn't too much chicken but I didn't realize this salad would come with cheese so there ended up being enough protein after all. The pom dressing wasn't too tart.  I also snagged a couple of bites of chicken tenders from my friend's plate. My friends liked their cheesecake but I'm a cheesecake purist. I don't like fancy cheesecakes and will not eat them (with the exception of pumpkin cheesecake during the holidays). Overall, if I had to eat at the mall and between the choices of the food court, Todai, Woodranch or Cheesecake, I guess I might come back. Only if there wasn't a wait though. 2.5- the menu was extremely sticky. Ick."
Anthony B.,"Temple City, CA",29,171,197,4.0,3/4/2012,"I always order the chicken bellagio because it's so good.  The food and service are always good here, even when it's busy (btw prepare for an hour or more wait on the weekends) but I had to take a star off because for some reason the floors near the bathrooms are slippery?"
Peggy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,107,88,2.0,5/25/2011,"I've been here a few times for brunch and dinner and I'm a sucker for their complimentary breads and how they refill them on purpose! Their food is decent, but I don't think it's worth the price. The last time I came here, a friend and my cousin asked a guy (who looked like Harry Shum aka Mike Chang from Glee) if they still had their pistachio cheesecake, but he told us that they discontinued it and another employee came and told us that if we were looking for a similar tasted, we should get their coffee flavored cheesecake because it tastes just like pistachio. Really, woman?! Really?! Someone talk some sense into her please."
James T.,"Temple City, CA",113,37,79,5.0,10/18/2011,"Love this place. I always seam to get a table right away. Our food is good and the service was great. Our server Abe gave us great suggestions and great service. Next time you go try the won tons they are great, and ask for Abe."
Jeff S.,"Riverside, CA",451,68,123,5.0,4/14/2011,"If you've ever been to any Cheesecake Factory, then you know it's hard not to love this place. This location in Arcadia in front of the Santa Anita Mall is another great one. I've been here a few times with my partner in crime... and carbs... and fat... you get the picture... And everytime i eat here i love what i get. Huge menu and everything is good and tastes fresh and cooked to perfection. One dish that suprised me here was the fish and chips as the pieces of Cod were crispy and perfectly fried, and the clam chowder was spot on. You can order anything you want and you'll be happy. And a dining experience at Cheesecake isn't complete without ordering a slice of their world famous Cheesecake for dessert. Big enough for two to share... creamy fatty goodness. Man i'm hungry just thinking about it!"
