Ghazal A.,"Calabasas, CA",97,17,,2.0,1/5/2014,"Honestly, Cheesecake Factory (almost every location I have been to in the past year) has consistently disappointed. The quality of food and service has been awful. I went to this location for brunch today and almost everything went wrong. No one came to our table for about 15 minutes and we didn't get out drink orders for an additional 10 minutes. I ordered an omelet and my fiancé ordered an item off of the brunch menu. Literally EVERYTHING was wrong when they brought it out. They tried their best to correct the wrong,  but again, failed. The only positive thing I can say is that the manager was very polite and tried his very best to make sure we left happy....that is the ONLY reason I gave the additional star. They didn't charge us for our incorrect orders. I will never be returning to Cheesecake Factory after my experience today."
Sunshine P.,"Monrovia, CA",0,16,,1.0,1/21/2009,"I like Cheesecake Factory. All places me and my BF went were good, but Arcadia one.  After finishing my work, me and my BF went to Arcadia Cheesecake Factory. It was around 9pm. They said they would be closed at 10pm. We asked our server if we could get bread nicely, she said ""No, you guys came too late, the bakery has been closed already.""   What's more, she brought entree and dessert at the same time. After we had one bite of the food, she brought the bill and said ""If you don't mind, will you check out?"" No drink riffles and any  good services were done. When we were leaving the restaurant, customers who came after us were served fresh bread. We had a terrible experience! We talked to her boss, who is the floor manager. We got all money back, but we are still upset.... it is not the money problem, the problem is the unprofessional server. She did not apologize us. Never go back there."
Erica R.,"El Monte, CA",39,43,48,5.0,3/28/2011,I went to the Cheesecake Factory this past week end for the first time and LOVED it. The wait was like 30 minutes on a busy Saturday for dinner. I was there with my boyfriend so the wait was not such a big deal. They give you the buzzers that tells you when a table is open. I like that you can go into the mall and browse while you wait.  Well our waitress was Adria... she was great and very attentive. Gave great suggestions and was truly really happy with my meal suggested by her. I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo and it was AMAZING!  My boyfriend had the chicken parmigiana romano ..something. It was huge and also very tasty. She filled up our drinks the second she saw we were half way done and came by to check on us so many times I was impressed. Every time she walked by she asked how we were doing and showed that she was really trying to provide us with great service and she did. The food could've been crap and I would've still been impressed! Thank you. I will be going back.
Marissa Y.,"Baldwin Park, CA",10,6,,1.0,3/17/2012,"Not the best place when handling a group of 12-14 people. Not only do they not take reservations, they are a bit shady. My girlfriends and I showed up around 7 pm on a Saturday night. Host/hostess told us that the wait time was an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, but asked to check in after 30 minutes. When we went to check the status, they lied and said the wait was two hours, and we had another hour and a half to wait. Therefore, it meant we would not be eating until nine! On top of that, another big group arrived after we did, and seated at their table before my group. I admit that they have good food, but I know my friends and I would rather go into Pasadena instead!"
John E.,"Pasadena, CA",11,34,,2.0,12/1/2011,"Whatever happened with the Evelyn's pasta on my last visit was just wrong, terribly, unsettlingly wrong.  I just can't find the words for it.  This chain used to almost always be good, but is perhaps getting too big for their own good."
Donald W.,"San Marino, CA",0,30,4,2.0,3/9/2012,"I like their food but cheesecake factory is really obnoxious when it comes to reservations. On certain days they just refuse to take them and tell you you just have to come in and sit in their lobby and wait and even if you tell them you have a large party with some kids (getting a table for 8 or 10 is always trouble anywhere) they basically just tell you too bad, won't even put you on the list until you get there, won't do anything to make life a little easier for you. Would it kill them when they have no wait to let you book a table for 10 an hour or so out so you don't have to spend 45 minutes sitting in their lobby waiting for them to be able to arrange a spot large enough to accommodate your group. I'm glad they have have so much business that they can afford to take their customers for granted like that. They really have an ""I don't care, too bad"" attitude."
N L.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,109,33,2.0,12/12/2010,"We decided to eat here since the restaurant we originally intended to go to was blocked off by the X'mas parade.  Since we were headed for the mall we thought we'll come here to get my favorite dish, the herb encrusted fillet of salmon.  Sis and I shared the dish with another order of their garlic noodles.  The garlic noodles were very salty, even for me... and I put salt on everything!  But nonetheless, it was edible with the bread they give you.  A bowl of white steam rice would have probably been better though.  Food was fine, as expected of the chain... however our server was simply terrible! Normally I don't like to name names.  But since she was so horrible, I will here.  Her name is ""Katy"", and she runs around like a chicken with its head cut off.  Very rude to begin with, not attentive at all.  I hate it when we have to ask for the same thing twice, but no matter... since it's the holidays, I bite my tongue and tell myself to complain less.  BUT then when we replenished our bread, instead of reaching for the butter dish to replenish that, she tossed the new butter from where she was standing(edge of our booth), over our food and into the little dish that was far against the wall!  Amazing!  It was a good shot, she must have done that quite a many times!  I was in shock.    Anyhow, we quickly finished our meal because we wanted to do some shopping.  We had our leftovers packed and when we got the bag back, the containers were placed all wrong in the bag, so I go to adjust it.  As I reached into the bag, my hands felt wet.  The bag was wet inside and out!  The containers were wet too!  Gross.  Katy was still running around when I flagged her down to tell her the bag was wet, before I finished, she snapped at me and yelled, ""GIVE ME A MINUTE HERE!"".  WTH?  She was so extremely rude that left me speechless... and then when she finally tossed me a new bag...she didn't even bother help us to put the containers back.  She also took forever to get the check.  But once we got it, she came back to ask for payment right away.  I've never had this kind of server at any Cheesecake Factory!  She needs to be retrained... or trained!!  Terrible terrible service!  We still left tip, but probably shouldn't have. =p"
Stanley K.,"Arcadia, CA",51,11,,3.0,3/4/2010,"I've always like eating there due to their desserts (Tuxedo White Chocolate Cheesecake is simply divine).  Miso Salmon, Jambolaya, strip steak, and BBQ ribs are among my favorite dishes there.   But recently their food and service start taking turn for the worse.   One time we were serviced by a waitress who was still in training and had an attitude problem.  When we pointed out to her that the steak I was given wasn't what I ordered she stubbornly insisted that's precisely what I ordered.   The waiter in charge of training her had to come and apologize and replace my order.  When she got my wife's order wrong as well the manager had to come and apologize and got us free soups while we wait for our orders to arrive.  So even though our waitress sucks the manager was very attentive and helpful so we decided to go back.   Unfortunately, the quality of the food have been going downhill ever since.   The garlic pasta my wife ordered in our most recent trip was too salty and when we informed our waitress she flatly told us that it's because the water they used to cook the pasta is salty and when combined with the sauce it got even saltier.  Funny, I don't remember pasta from Cheesecake Factory was this salty until now so I don't know what she's talking about.  Nevertheless we had to order another pasta (Chicken Madeira I think) that's at least tolerable.  After that meal my wife told me she's not going back there again and from that point on I've been buying cheesecakes from there only.  I guess I'll have to get my craving for American-Italian cruisine fix elsewhere."
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,42,13,3.0,10/9/2009,"HONESTLY, this place is WAY OVER priced.  We got their chicken pot stickers as an appetizer. YEAH, dumb. I think the (asian) instant ones that come in a bag taste better than those. Then the chicken alfredo tasted like what I could've made in 10 minutes with a jar of sauce from Albertson's. I've also tried their garlic noodles, it wasn't very flavorful, couldn't really taste anything.. really. That day, I had a SERIOUS craving for shrimps.. so i just HAD to get that. The Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic was the better one of the mix. It's not too salty, not too sweet. Love the garlic. Perfect! I also enjoy the flexibility of being able to change up the pasta. You see, I love the dish ""Shrimp with Angel Hair "" EXCEPT the angel hair part, I requested for bow tie pasta instead and it was great! LIKE i said though, for the okay tasting food, i would probably go elsewhere. This location tends to be pretty packed on weekends too. I was with a group of 10-11 and our ""expected"" wait time was 2 hours. So we just chose the outdoor.. which wasn't so bad at all. It's pretty chilly at night."
John D.,"Monrovia, CA",16,92,3,4.0,8/21/2011,"It's Cheesecake Factory. We all know what it is, we all know what it's about. We've all eaten there a bunch of times. It's pretty much a can't go wrong. You'll never have the best meal of your life there, or the best service, but it will always be far from the worst. I'm not a fan of the cheesecake ironically. I'm from New York, I like New York style cheesecake, not this stuff they serve here. By the way, on this past trip our waiter Eric was fantastic. Great personality even though I know they try and make their servers act more like robots than real people."
Kate C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,64,3,5.0,1/1/2011,"I really appreciate how clean everyone working here keeps this place.  The food here is delicious! Yes, you are paying a bit more money here, but the quality is wonderful. The chefs also put in extra effort to make your dishes look perfect. If you come here for lunch with a buddy, you should just order a dinner-sized entree, rather than a lunch-sized one, and share. They are huge! It's also a good idea if you are watching your calorie-intake. This is kind of ironic, but I don't really come here for their Cheesecakes. I find them much too sweet for my taste. The pastas are much more delectable. Their chicken and steaks are always cooked perfectly.  This is a wonderful place to go out on a date, especially if you do not want to kill your wallet. Yes, it will make a make a minor dent in your wallet, but on the bright side, your tummy will  be very satisfied afterwards!"
Glenn G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,4.0,3/2/2014,"The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is that I've never had a problem with customer service. They treat me well on every visit. That said, the food is above average but a little overpriced. I love the fried mac and cheese here. 3 star food with 5 star service"
Icy L.,"El Monte, CA",117,100,567,5.0,10/22/2008,"I love about their everything but their price (I'm poor, so to me, it is expensive) and cheesecake. The drinks there are the best thing ever! I love their Hawaiian pizza and pasta!!! Orange Chicken is a bit sour. Cheesecakes, well, I don't really know what's up but I like frozen Cheesecakes better. But I love their food overall! The service is outstanding and the interior design is to die for! However, it's a bit of crowed, at least that's how I felt. Although it is located in the mall, parking is still pain the the ass (excuse my language). Also, another down side is, if you are going on a weekend, either you reverse a table in advance or you'll have to get ready to wait for an hour or more. (I tried and it's not fun!) Although they do give a little call machine thingy, but it's only works up to certain distance, so you really can't walk around the mall.  There's also a full bar, but I never went there. Although, what I do know is, they have a TV of sports/gamble stuff etc over the bar. The place is a bit loud plus the background music, it's louder. There's also out door seating, where smoking is allowed. Outside is crowed as well. There are two sides to the outdoor seating. One is facing the street (where all the parking is at) so there's not much to see. Another is to the side of entrance, where facing and next to other restaurants. So you'll see LOTS of people walking and seating doing nothing. However, the only thing about this side is you'll get to see the decoration lights turning colors- it's pretty but if you stare at it for a while, it gets boring. But hey, it's better looking at parked cars.  Overall, I love Cheesecake Factory and seriously, I wouldn't mind living there for the food."
Shanelle A.,"El Monte, CA",1,37,36,4.0,11/6/2011,"Great service: I have never had a bad experience here. The servers are always polite and prompt. They are very nice, helpful, and attentive. Food: The food is good and consistent, which is sometimes hard to find. Large servings are great to share! Avocado rolls=5/5 they're my favorite :) Steak Dianne=5/5 perfect!!! Ribs=5/5 best ribs ever! They have a great sauce and good portions! Please don't take them off the menu again !!! Also worth mentioning: complimentary bread is so delicious and fresh, stuffed mushrooms and artichoke hearts are also very good, and cheesecake has always been delightful.  Ambience: It's very romantic with dim lighting Cleanliness: very clean"
Lisa L.,"Monrovia, CA",12,218,8,5.0,11/27/2011,"My husband and I have been here several times and each time we have not been disappointed. First, let's start off with the decor. For me, it is  well, i can't describe it. You have to check it out for yourself. What I can say is that it is very breathtaking. Now for the food. When you order your food, they bring you rolls right out of the oven. Sooooooo good. I ordered their  tropical tea nice and refreshing ,I really enjoyed it. For dinner, my  husband ordered Chicken Di Pana. He loved it. I had Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. I AM HOOKED. I just wish that they had coupons. It is a little pricey. But you know, it is a nice place to go for special occasions."
Linda H.,"Alhambra, CA",78,194,98,5.0,7/9/2009,"This is definitely my go-to restaraunt, and it never fails.  I love the variety of choices that the Cheesecake Factory has, and their cooking styles/flavors definitely suits my palate.  Their prices are reasonable, and their portions are huge.  And of course, there is ALWAYs room for Cheesecake dessert.   The staff at this restaurant are friendly, and this is a pretty popular restaurant especially on friday and weekend nights.  But we never had to wait too long.  It is conveniently located at the mall, so you can always shop around before or after you eat."
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,4.0,5/5/2009,"First off, the décor is gorgeous. I don't know the correct term to describe it- very European and old-worldly. It kinda reminded me of some of those casinos in Vegas actually. This Cheesecake Factory is located adjacent to the Santa Anita mall and is much bigger than the one in Pasadena A bunch of co-workers and I came on a weekday for lunch so it wasn't busy at all and there was plenty of parking. The server was nice enough, even helping to pour the ketchup for us (the secret is to hit the ""57"" on the bottle). But since he already earned his 18% gratuity due to our large group, he probably wasn't as attentive as he could have been.  The menu is extensive, which is probably part of the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory, everything from pasta to comfort food to Asian dishes.  I've been there many times and have yet to even try a quarter of the menu. But first came the bread and drinks. The strawberry lemonade is delicious - not as good as Red Robins (who puts actual strawberries in the drink). It was pricey at almost five dollars but still managed to hit the spot. And one of my favorite parts of the meal is the dark bread (rye?). I could pretty much live on that bread. One downside is that the food took awhile to come out so I filled up on the bread, lemonade and their free refills. I ended up getting a pizzette from their new small plate and snacks menu ($3.95 -$6.50), which are advertised as appetizers and I think just the right size if you want a light lunch. Or in my case, because I wanted to save room for cheesecake. The rest of the group got a variety of pastas and sandwiches off the lunch special menus. The portions are still ginormous and the presentation of the food was very nice too.  The pizzette was good - thin crust with sausage and ricotta cheese, not too oily with about 5 small slices. Then I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. It was definitely rich with four layers of chocolate, fudge, cheese and heaven but so amazing. Yeah so much good food and I still ended up taking half of my pizza and cheesecake home. I also got to try the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, which was yummy as well. Although I haven't eaten many kinds of cheesecake I haven't liked.  Overall, a pleasant lunch. And you must save room for their cheesecake. But probably only good for special events or an occasional lunch because it'll make a small dent in your wallet and a small bulge in your tummy."
Jessica B.,"Monterey Park, CA",31,107,19,4.0,6/21/2013,"Everything that I've had from here so far is super good! They use to have the sampler platter which I absolutely miss! Cause it had 4 different kinds of appetizers in one platter! But they don't have that no more :( any who I came here with a few friends the other night, and surprisingly no wait to be seated! The food was so good! My friends ordered the turkey bacon club i believe and i got the flatbread with fresh mushrooms, which was amazing! The food did take a little while to get to us, then again maybe it was cause we were all super hungry and dying to eat? :P our waiter..don't really remember his name, he was attentive at first..but after a while he pretty much disappeared and only to be seen every so often. Last but not least, their red velvet cheese cake...best cheesecake ever!! The first time I had it I remembered it being too sweet but that was 3 years ago! This time when we had it it was perfect! And they're monstrous sizes! But I'm not complaining :)"
Duo D.,"Alhambra, CA",0,8,31,4.0,2/15/2010,"It was my first time to try cheesecake factory, and I totally love it!  Their service was really good.  My friend and I took a long time to decide our order but the waitress was patient and made us feel relaxable.  Their beef ribs and tiramisu were really delicious.  My friend does not like desserts that much but really like the tiramisu even though feeling really full."
Micah N.,"El Monte, CA",8,43,1,1.0,7/26/2009,"My experience here last night at this particular cheesecake factory has been the worst yet.  For my entree, I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken.  First bite, and immediately there was something wrong - it was very salty, and my friend who was with me confirmed.  To add salt to injury, the described 'delicious creamy' sauce was neither delicious nor creamy - it was basically a pool of water sitting at the bottom of the plate. The egregious part however came when I ordered a tiramisu for dessert.  I was halfway through it when I clamped down on what I thought was a piece of chocolate shaving, but which however proved difficult to chew.  What I pulled out was a sharp jagged shard of solid black plastic about one inch by one inch!!!  I was extremely infuriated that such an object, a potential choking hazard, by whatever means, found itself in something meant to be consumed and enjoyed. The manager shortly came over to our table and apologized, even offered to call a paramedic which I declined even though my teeth was hurt from biting the plastic shard; nevertheless, I found the manager to be insincere, as if it is normally the case he makes appearances on the dining floor to assuage unhappy diners. I've been disappointed with this cheesecake factory half of the time (ranging from orange juice-drenched orange chicken, to an overly-salted kobe burger), and the other half is at best decent and edible.  The plastic in my dessert is highly unacceptable, and is the last straw for me to ever consider dining there again."
