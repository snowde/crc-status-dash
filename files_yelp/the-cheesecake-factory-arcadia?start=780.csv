S J.,"Monrovia, CA",0,127,5,3.0,8/28/2011,"This is a hit and miss place.  Had the Vietnamese rolls (appetizer as I remember).  The first time I tried them, they were good, next time they were old.  The Cuban sandwich was good yesterday, but the fries were old. Atmosphere--barny, loud, cold.  Too many servers, and everyone seems to be rushing.  But they are friendly and efficient. It's a very convenient place to eat after or before the movie in the mall."
Brian C.,"Arcadia, CA",361,73,49,5.0,5/17/2013,im a fan of cheesecake factory regardless of location. parking can be biatch becasue its part of a busy mall. all good though! food is always great whatever you order and service is kind and respectful!
Kevin G.,"Arcadia, CA",1,9,,4.0,3/16/2010,"Delicious delicious delicious! Great pastas, sandwiches, seafood dishes, steaks, etc. Of course, their cheesecake and other desserts are their finest attraction, but honestly, everything at the Cheesecake Factory is great! My only qualm is with the service (and somewhat with the prices but they are forgivable given the quality). The service, while friendly, is very slow. A lot of times its understandable and just goes without saying since they nearly perpetually busy and crowded. But Ive been there when it isnt busy and rather quiet and calm and I still received slow service and warm-cold food. Im sure they arent always like this, but it's a strong sign when every time Ive gone here I always wait in excess of 30 minutes to receive my food."
Eryka H.,"Alhambra, CA",138,67,15,5.0,6/23/2011,"The service here is good, the food has never disappointed me and the dessert, ah the dessert...it never fails.  I really like this location, it's fancy, very open, well kept and you can burn off that 1,000 calorie cheesecake with a good walk around the mall =)"
Margaret T.,"San Marino, CA",1,67,1,4.0,9/16/2011,"I used to enjoy the chopped salad a lot but then it deteriorated.  I was there a few weeks ago and thankfully, their chopped salad is great this time.  I like their Salisbury steak.  Their burgers are good too.  Their fish dishes are horrible, pasta is not good either.  Cheesecake is superb...love the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.  Worth a return visit."
John H.,"Alhambra, CA",7,79,3,4.0,9/9/2011,"Well this is the only Cheesecake Factory I have been to and imo it's one of the better casual dining experiences around. Reasonable prices, good food, large menu with a variety of items, and a ""low cal"" menu, too. I really like the Meatloaf lunch / dinner here. Nicely seasoned, well cooked, just a bit of char at the edges. The Greek salad is delicious, fried macaroni and cheese a treat, and the burgers and appetizers are great, as well. One small thing I can nitpick about is the ""fried cheese"" appetizer isn't really fried cheese, but rather breaded cheese sticks which are then fried. The fried macaroni and cheese are simply small scoops, breaded and fried as well. But to be honest both snacks lack the flavor of good deep fried food and could have  been baked from all I can tell by texture and taste. Not crisp in the least, but not soggy, either. I wouldn't get the fried cheese again, but the fried macaroni and cheese, sure. It's good, just not as decadent as it's name suggests. And unless you request otherwise it's served on a bed of marinara sauce. Do yourself a favor of flavor, and get the sauce on the side.   Service has always been nice and friendly if casual, and I love the outdoor dining area here. It's great for people watching while having a meal. Lot's of mall goers coming and....going. Inside is nicely done, also. But noisy it seems even with just several tables being served. And I much prefer outdoor dining at this location, anyway. One day, I may even try the cheesecake!"
Brenda B.,"Covina, CA",80,88,71,5.0,6/7/2011,"I've never had a bad experience here and I'm never disappointed either. Make sure to order the chicken bellagio plate its inexpensive and probably their best pasta dish. Filet mignon was soooo good. Also order the Georgia Peach drink, its delicious. The waiters are hot!"
Margaret J.,"San Gabriel, CA",66,16,,4.0,5/26/2011,"it really takes time to wait. But the food is good, don't have too much to be picky about ;)"
Sandi M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,22,7,3.0,1/20/2015,"My family and I have been coming to this Cheesecake for years and have never been disappointed until this weekend.  My husband and i got there when they opened. The receptionist's were friendly and we were seated right away.  My husband ordered steak Diane with a side order of eggs.  I ordered chicken bellagio which was the first time for me.  When our dishes were served I liked they way it looked.  The chicken  breast sat on a bed of angel air pasta.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto ham with arugula salad.  I consider my self a foodie and pretty good home cook.  First of all, I had to send my dish back because it was luke warm.  Our waitress was nice and asked her manager to see what she could get while i waited.  She came back and offered me either soup or salad.  Really, why not a slice of cheesecake people after all we are at at The Cheesecake Factory.  There was really nothing special about this dish.  There was no yummy sauce over the chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly but like I said the wow factor was not there especially for the price.  My husband liked what he got but he said his side eggs were cold.  What's up with that?  The best part of my meal was the bread and that's a real shame."
Mallory L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,10,,3.0,5/22/2010,"My friend and I split a slice of oreo cheesecake after eating nothing since we woke up. Unfortunately, my friend and I both got diarrhea and severe stomach aches shortly after. I called the restaurant to complain about the distressing symptoms and warned them that maybe their cheesecake had spoiled. The lady on the phone chuckled and guaranteed me that their cheesecake was fine. I'm not lactose intolerant but I am idiot intolerant. Please don't be rude to me!"
Csndra L.,"Anaheim, CA",5,93,2,5.0,7/22/2008,"There was this fat bitch that I knew from high school that worked as a hostess here at this location, it's a good thing I don't see her there anymore whenever I'm back in town from SF. Look at the 5 stars I dished out, that's how happy I am."
Justin N.,"Alhambra, CA",42,44,,5.0,2/8/2012,I think that Cheescake Facory is the most consistant in terms of food quality and taste.  I've been here so many times it's hard to count.  I always get full on the sourdough bread though.  I got the pasta divinci this time and I absolutely love it.  It has a slightly sweet taste with mushrooms and penne pasta.  One thing I don't like is the price of the soft drinks.  It usually is like 4 bucks for a coke.  I usually just drink water now.  This place is highly recommended it though for its consistency and quality.
Ashley S.,"Monterey Park, CA",8,34,,5.0,8/31/2009,"The service is excellent (: The food is yummy, of course and the bread they serve first is soft and hot. I usually order Thai Chicken Pasta which always makes me full at the end xD I don't know why everyone's giving this a bad review o.o This place is realllly good! The only thing is that it cost a lot, but overall it's pretty good and they have a lot of varieties of food (: There's rice, pasta, soups, and more! This place is a good place to chill and relax with your family (: I usually go with my family once a month or if we have time. Even though it's really good, it cost a lot for somethign you would usually go. Good food and service (:"
Cynthia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,22,,3.0,8/31/2011,"Went to eat on a Friday evening, good food. Nothing too special about it, The wait is very long and the service is good. Its a nice place if you are looking for casual dinner night with friends or family. My favorite desert is the chocolate cake it is moist, soft, and very yummy, not the dark chocolate though thats a lil too rich for my taste! The Marina Del Rey location has way better views when seated outside."
V P.,"Alhambra, CA",14,82,,3.0,7/7/2011,"Service is spot on. I'd give it a 5 Attentive but not intrusive with personality. Food is average, pricing at tad steep.  Chicken samosas are pretty good, not authentic but tasty."
G L.,"West Covina, CA",0,54,2,2.0,8/24/2013,Will not be coming back here again to dine in!  I dined in and there were flies all over in the restaurant.  There was not just one or two but enough to watch your food so that the flies don't land on them AND the swatting be annoying!
Meeshy C.,"Covina, CA",413,29,32,4.0,7/25/2012,"Well I called before hand cause it was a Saturday night and I wanted to make a reservation since my boyfriend and I were starving and did not want to wait. We called and the hostess tells us that its just a 5 to 10 min. wait and that they do not accept reservations and cannot put my name on the list until I arrive. I am thinking how weird because The Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena and other locations at least put your name on the call ahead list or something. So I decided not to stress about it since its only a 5 min wait. That completely changed when we got there It was PACKED! I went up to put my name down and the hostess told me I could wait for a table for  2 up to 40 min. Wow, I told her I called ahead 10 min before I came and that she said the wait was anywhere from 5 to 10 min. So this girl with a big bow on her head rudely told me that things change and we were gonna have to wait 40 min. I was really hungry so we decided to wait and we were greeted by our server who made up for his rude hostess and showed us a wonderful time and meal. We tried the Orange Chicken with Rice and my boyfriend got the pasta and chicken and it was delicious! we also tried the recess cheesecake which was also a big hit! All and all I loved the food but please get someone in the front that speaks in a nicer manner to her customers."
Michael L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/6/2013,Came to eat here at about 10:30 service was great but that's all the goodness about this place my gf got the alfredo pasta and it was really dry and flavored less like if it had a while out and the bread was stale too I really walked out of their disappointed.
Meemo W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,261,2,3.0,10/5/2011,"not a bad place, but sometimes i think they're either understaffed or have staff who don't know how to do their jobs..  i've been to this one a few times and when they're adequate on staff, some just stand around when ppl are sitting in the front and there are open tables the food isn't bad, pretty typical and nothing that i can note were badly made parking is at the mall and the mall sucks, so good luck with that"
Dak L.,"El Monte, CA",129,119,5,3.0,10/6/2008,"Lets see, Cheesecake factory in Arcadia is not bad at all compared to the Old Town Pasadena location which is usually super crowded.  I had dinner there this past weekend and our server was great. Our party was seated outside patio and usually from my past experience, servers usually don't check up enough on the outdoor customers but not in this case. He was efficient at servicing drinks and entrees.  The food is pretty darn good and the cheesecake is another story (drool)..  Recommendations:  Miso Salmon Renee's Special Key Lime Cheesecake or Strawberry Cheesecake TRUST!"
