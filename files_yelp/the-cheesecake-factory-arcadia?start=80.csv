Charmagne N.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,129,278,4.0,6/3/2016,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory every now and then for years, and now I'm finally writing a review. Usually when I come here, I order the factory nachos which are always super decadent. Absolutely delicious.   But my fiancé and I decided to split a dish because the portions are huge, and today, I was craving pasta.  There are so many delicious pasta dishes here so we could've gotten anything, and it'd still be delicious. We finally decided on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Before we got the food however, we waited a very long time. I guess I'm used to it because the wait always takes really long at Cheesecake Factory, but I wish they could do something about it. We devoured the free bread in the meantime.  When we got our food we saw that it had asparagus, red and yellow peppers, honey-glazed chicken on pasta in a parmesan cream sauce.  I don't understand the reviews claiming this was super heavy, but maybe I was craving something heavy that day. Overall I'd give it 4 stars since it was good, but it made me super gassy a couple hours later."
Melissa S.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,8,8,1.0,8/7/2017,"So, I love the cheese cake, but dissatisfied with the staff. We had a meal that this cheese cake a week ago. My hubby called to complain and they told him, they will give him a $25.00 gift card. Today 8/7/17, my hubby walks in after getting the mail, and they sent us $15.00 dollar gift card......  Hmmm... it's too bad the foods so good, that they can't get a good staff there.  Next I want cheese cake, I'm going to drive 20 min out of my way and go to Glendale."
Mick C.,"La Habra, CA",12,49,,3.0,6/5/2017,"Cheesecake is what it is, good food and always a great place for groups since everyone can find something that they will enjoy with their expansive menu regardless of the location. Usually the workers are very chill but yesterday (sunday) Grumpy McGrumpenstein that was working the bar in the afternoon was having a bad day and should've stayed home.  Short and condescending remarks and answers to questions, aura of annoyance, and a general overall vibe of not wanting to be there and interact with humans at all.  Call in a sick day if you're that miserable and save your paying patrons your ""excellent"" customer service."
Jessica T.,"Arcadia, CA",400,170,635,3.0,9/11/2016,"This restaurant is always mediocre at best. I typically come here with family when we have a birthday to celebrate and want to go to somewhere local, semi nice, yet also not too pricey. This is one of those restaurants that reminds me of the high school days, when large groups would go out to eat together before heading to Prom or the Homecoming dances.  My favorite appetizer would have to be the avocado rolls. i normally am not a huge fan of fried foods (especially as appetizers), but it is quite tasty despite being fried on the outside. The sauce complements the avocado very well. Moving on to the main dishes... I highly suggest the miso salmon for the healthy eaters out there. The salmon is cooked perfectly (almost) every time and the sauce is also an A+ with the rice on the bottom (choose brown rice if you want to be extra healthy). But on the days when I'm craving straight up pasta, I like to get the angel hair shrimp, which is just a huge plate of plain old angel hair and shrimp drenched in tomato sauce with a hint of garlic and lemon. The farfalle pasta is also a good option I go to if I'm not in the mood for angel hair. If you want a salad though, I recommend the Asian chicken salad, as it is a HUGE entree and you will most likely not be left hungry after from eating just a salad."
Richard F.,"San Diego, CA",432,233,277,4.0,9/22/2016,"This is a review only for their happy hour. If you want an above average meal for a great price, this is definitely high on the list. Weekday happy hour Mon-Fri from 4-6PM. One of the best happy hour joints in the area. Appetizers are $5.95 with other small dishes that are $6-8. And the portion sizes are pretty big. I ordered the happy hour burger and my friend ordered the fried macaroni and cheese. The burger was one of the better burgers I had. Double patty was cooked at a perfect medium rare. The thousand island sauce with the butter toasted buns made this a great burger. The fried macaroni and cheese was good as usual, but they slightly burned the edges.  The bill came out to less than $14 total and both of us were pretty full. Can't find a better value than Cheesecake Factory happy hour. Will definitely come back again."
Lupe A.,"West Covina, CA",0,35,2,5.0,10/13/2017,"Had lunch their yesterday and I had the club sandwich to go. I was encouraged to try the tortilla soup and I'm so glad I did! It was really good!! Lots of veggies, rice and chicken.  I want to thank Ian who took my order and got it perfect since I always ask for extra sauces. Everything was in my bag including napkins and utensils...thank you. The staff is amazing! John is really nice too!!"
Dwain C.,"Rosemead, CA",1014,1262,2656,4.0,6/8/2017,"I ate lunch at The Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia, CA on 6/8/2017.  I've been there many times before.  This time I had their Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($13.95) and coffee ($3.50).  Damien, my server, did a fine job (assisted by Chris).  Plus, I took photos."
Danny Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",162,107,233,4.0,1/16/2017,"Went to the Cheese Cake Factory at Westfield Mall/Santa Anita. It was busy and a 30 minute wait. We were a party of four. The outdoor dining area was not available! My utensils were spotty. I had to clean then with my lemon water. Service was a little slow due to the busy lunch crowd. We ordered Thai chicken lettuce cups, chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, Spicy Cajun Jambalaya Pasta & Rigatoni with meat sauce.  The food was tasty and a good portion size for the price.  No room for a Cheese Cake dessert. A 4-Star Rating."
Dang N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",195,1019,116,3.0,5/2/2017,"3 1/2 stars. I came here on a   date and it's been years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. I won't lie, I was really surprised. The food here is actually pretty solid. We ordered the kale salad and a steak. Both were pretty good. Not amazing, but good. I'm reconsidering this franchise."
Tina L.,"Temple City, CA",256,42,4,4.0,4/8/2017,"For lunch: usually order Renee's special - it comes with soup, salad, and sandwich. There usually isn't a wait and you can just walk in to be seated. Because it isn't as busy as it is at night during lunch time, waiters are very attentive For dinner: 9/10 times I would get the chicken jumbalaya! it is SO good and the portion is HUGE! I'd share it with one other person or box what I don't finish and bring it home with me. Service is a bit slower, there has been times that our waters and drinks come around the same time as food. I always leave very satisfied and don't always have room for a cheesecake dessert but the ones I have tired (oreo/tuxuedo/smores/godiva choco/white raspberry truffle) have been amazing! I'm making it a goal to try the godiva chocolate sundae before the end of this year haha. Also, cheesecake factory has the best bread! The brown bread with oats is to die for! P.S. I would make reservations for dinner time. You can never go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory!"
Jesaica K.,"El Monte, CA",0,16,1,1.0,10/17/2017,"My son and I came for lunch here on a weekday. We were one of the first customers. I ordered chicken and vegetables with biscuits. When our food came. The chicken was cold, which was gross. For being one of the first customers our food should have been warm. I will never come again to this establishment. Very disappointing being a big chain restaurant. I have had better food from places that are more reasonable in price."
Forever F.,"Alhambra, CA",411,104,575,4.0,4/2/2017,"My favorite dish is the chicken Madeira  oh my God I cannot get enough of those mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus. So delicious! I also really love the avocado eggrolls. My only complaint is that drinks are very very pricey. My drink cost as much as a meal!!! $14.25 for a drink ????really ?!that's crazy! Pure madness! I think if the drinks are going to be more than $10 you should let us know and give us the option. At least have the courtesy to do that for us."
Kanit W.,"Anaheim, CA",6,47,74,4.0,11/18/2016,"We ate at this location last minute right before we went to go see Arrival at the AMC Monday night.  Food right before a movie is a fun tradition and we thought what better place to go then the restaurant with the fifty-page menu (we love options!).   First and foremost, it must be said that our waitress was so great.  She was attentive and polite and she made sure our drinks were filled and a fresh pot of coffee was made because someone at our table that night needs her hot drinks as hot as possible.  I love good service and this place was bringing it on that Monday night. Two of us ordered breakfast for dinner while one of my friends got Shrimp Scampi.  I have to say, she gave me a shrimp and it had lots of garlic and was amazing.  I would have poached all her shrimp from her plate if I had no self-control, but I did, thanks in part to our basket of fresh bread and butter.   Our breakfast wasn't the best omelette I've ever had (they do the fold the egg over the ingredients method) because I like my egg to be binded to the ingredients almost like a scramble or a tort of sorts.  The bacon in it was incredibly tasty though and it did bump up the flavor of my dish.  Bacon really does make everything better! We enjoyed our time there but I was bummed to find my ""free cheesecake"" coupon that came with my gift card had expired!  It's always a bummer when you miss out on free food and a million calories of cream cheese goodness. If you are at the mall and want some good food and service, stop by and eat among the Eyes of Sauron!"
Ophelia N.,"San Gabriel, CA",239,261,156,1.0,2/12/2016,"Slowest. Service. Ever.  Came on a Friday night trying to have a nice meal, never mind the wait because it was expected. But once we were seated we waited.for.ever for our waitress to take our order and then waited for ever for the food to come only to see she had put in the wrong order for me. I tried to drown my sorrows in my sangria but could not get through al the ice to actually taste the drink. No exaggeration but when I scooped out the ice it completely filled my plate, I had maybe 55% of the cup full. I waited longer for them to make my meal (which unfortunately was bland) and of course by then was extremely disappointed. But no worries, because I got to wait wayyyy more for the check too. Not coming back for a looong time. They made me wait so I'm sure they won't mind waiting for me to come back."
Aloulou O.,"Pasadena, CA",382,208,204,5.0,8/15/2016,I noticed if the server is awesome the food is awesome! When the server is rude or in a bad mood the food is not great.. Kinda a hot or miss.. Last time we had the mushroom burger medium well.... It's honestly the best burger out there. No doubt about it. We also had the Steak Diana it's sooo tasty and filling!
Leonard A.,"Los Angeles, CA",741,299,3000,3.0,7/31/2016,"I usually come here for the vast variety of cheesecakes but decided to venture out into their specialty burgers.I saw the macaroni and cheese burger on the flatscreen and it looked pretty good so I decided to try it out.When I came out it looked decent but it lacked that Mac N Cheese pop that I was hoping for and so I had to order a side of Parmesan cheese to help it out.Next I ordered a slice of Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake,I don't know if the economy is still in play but it looked smaller than most slices I usually get.Nevertheless the cheesecake was great and my server Valerie S was really nice and helpful.This restaurant is a hit or miss and today the service was hit and the burger was a definite miss.Luckily the cheesecake is always the big winner here."
Eva W.,"Rosemead, CA",448,14,3,5.0,8/17/2017,"I came here with my coworkers after work. We wait about 5-10 minutes before seated. Nice waiter gave us extra bread. We got 3 dishes and 1 appetizer. We had our favorite avocado egg roll first. The main dishes takes a bit long, but they worth the wait. We end up give more than 20% tips because we think this restaurant is good quality food and nice service. We want to order some dessert, but we don't have any room for it. Nice after work meal."
Miji G.,"West Covina, CA",54,31,24,4.0,10/11/2017,"We ate at Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday, and it was so busy that whenever we called our server, he always replied with ""Just a sec."" Obviously, it was more than a sec or a minute. But that aside, I had the best eggplant parmesan! You get three massive slices of fried eggplant (coated with parmesan breadcrumbs) and topped with mozzarella, fontina, and marinara. They also serve it with pesto pasta, which was perfectly cooked and way better than what they serve at Olive Garden. The eggplant and pesto pasta combination was a winner. I ended my meal with a slice of Chocolate Tuxedo Cream™ Cheesecake--layers of their fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, vanilla mascarpone mousse, and chocolate. It was the bomb, and I don't even remember the last time I said that cringe-worthy word."
Dan H.,"San Gabriel, CA",60,39,254,5.0,9/1/2016,"I'm in love with some of the dishes here such as fish n chips,sweet potato fries,fried calamari,buffalo wings,cajun jambalaya pasta&jamaican black pepper shrimp.   Last but not least,their servers did a very good job~!"
Jeremy S.,"Pasadena, CA",153,525,9,1.0,7/28/2017,"What a joke, I went here and had a cheesecake which was actually good but then I ordered a Chinese chicken salad and there was a moving black bug in it. Our waiting, who was actually nice, told the manager who apologized robotically and asked if we wanted dessert in the type of way that you would think is complementary but we declined since we already had a cheesecake. They took the salad off the bill but then we asked the waiter if they could take the cheesecake off as well because the manager offered us complimentary dessert but he declines and said it was a misunderstanding.  I just don't think David, the manager, cares very much about customer service."
