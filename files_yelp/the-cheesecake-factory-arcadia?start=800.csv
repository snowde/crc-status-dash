Sunset Lover J.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,177,,5.0,4/12/2009,"If you just moved to Cali or don't know what this place is, it's HEAVEN. There are many many choices for your lunch, dinner, and DESSERT. Just reading the names of the desserts will have you drooling. We actually spent like half an hour trying to decide what to eat. Their cheesecake is extraordinary and their food is GREAT. Cute waiters, waitresses, great environment for family, friends, couples. Though...it's kind of pricey. You get what you pay for though!  Try this place if you want goood dessert and a satisfying meal!"
Irma M.,"Arcadia, CA",30,30,,4.0,4/11/2009,"I had only been to two other Cheesecake Fac.. (Brea and Pasadena)  both of those were very crowded, loud with a long wait time to be seated.  Wanting to avoid at the very least the long wait we decided to go to this one on a Tue night.  And sure enough there was no wait time.  Me and my husband were very impressed with the design and decoration, we even commented on how it reminded us of being in Vegas.  The restaurant was not crowded, yet it was not empty at the very least.  Our server was gracious and very efficient.  We ordered beers.  My husband commented that his Heferweizen was one of the best he had tasted.  Our appetizer was the southwestern egg rolls.  Very tasty and good. Our main dishes was the Cuban Sandwich, which I ordered.  It was good, nothing extraordinary.  Just as I would expect  it to taste like.  My husband ordered the Fish and Chips.  He liked them a lot, but mentioned he would come next time and just order appetizers and beer.  He really loved the rolls. We had no room for the ""famous"" cheesecake, so we passed on that.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.  I definitely want to go back.  I tipped our server well because she did such a good job. Now, whether this review would have been this favorable if we had gone on a Fri or Sat night, I don't know.  But our experience that Tuesday night was great."
Nancy B.,"Arcadia, CA",91,50,1,4.0,4/4/2009,"""What I love about the cheesecake factory: Atmosphere, service, food and drinks. My main dish of all time is Chicken Marsala its delicious, trust me I've been to other restaurants for Chicken Marsala and none so far can top cheesecake factory. I have tried so many different dishes and cheesecakes and have no complaints. BUT my #1 cheesecake is Kahlua yummy. About drinks my favorite Georgia Peach I can't leave before I have my Georgia Peach. So, if I love the cheesecake factory so much why didn't i give it 5stars-- long wait specially on fridays and wknds and the fact that they don't take reservations. Reservations would be an ""A+"" That's really the only reason. Best time to go is lunch/dinner time on weekdays..."""
Jasmine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,61,,2.0,5/16/2009,"Wasn't even a busy night and we had to wait 20 minutes.  What gives?  The food came out even slower and that's why we had to ask for more bread.  The waiter didn't seem to care but at least the busboy took care of us. Food was like all the other Factories.  Is it my imagination or are the portions getting smaller?  Even  when I was famished, I would have plenty to take home.  Not this time.  Can we also do something with the lighting?  I'm all for a romantic evening but when you can barely see the food in front of you it makes you wonder what could they be hiding?"
Suzanne B.,"Altadena, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/2/2011,"0 stars for service - Sorry, but went in for a cheesecake to go - my $30 was accepted within seconds.  However, my ""guy"" took personal phone messages, took other orders, made smoothie drinks ALL while I was just sitting there waiting, before he even thought about going back to get my cheesecake from the freezer.  Many other employees were standing around the restaurant chatting away - I'm just sitting there watching him work.  When he finally went to go get it, he came back within 1 min. defending himself  that he was busy doing other things.  I keep my receipts, so I have his name,  but won't attack him personally - just poor customer service will always come back to bite you!"
Olivia J.,"Montebello, CA",74,364,73,3.0,12/16/2010,"Just like my previous review, the parking here sucks.  Other than that, I love Cheesecake for their shrimp scampi and strawberry lemonade!  The red velvet cheesecake...also very good.  Watch out for those calories, though.  It's kind of cool that they actaully list them now so you are not tempted as much to get one. haha"
Sam L.,"Tustin, CA",447,26,,4.0,12/14/2010,"So every time I come here, I get their crusted chicken romano, which is essentially breaded chicken breast with pasta, all smothered with this surprisingly good tomato cream sauce that in itself isn't too thick at all compared to other cream sauces.  Why do I get this each time?  Because it not only comes in the largest portion I've ever seen food in, but because it's surprisingly filling as comfort food should be.   As far as cheesecakes go, my review would be a five-starrer if they didn't execute my favorite dessert off the menu: the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecake.  One day they had it, the next they didn't.  No warning.  I was devastated.  They replaced it with the same thing, but instead of 'latte,' put 'macademia nut.'  Not the same.   Since then, I've ""settled"" with the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  Just as rich, but not my first love.  For any of their heavy cheesecakes, you MUST have the whipped cream with it to lighten the texture.  Otherwise you just feel ... weighty.  Plus, their whipped cream is good in its own merit, so get it.  If you get it to go, ask them.  My to-go server (is there such a thing?) agreed with my whipped cream love and was awesome enough to give me a ton of it.  Just had to share that. Their drinks are pretty stylish too - even the lemonade I got had sugar on the rim.  Now I'm not exactly what you'd call high class, but if they go through the trouble of putting sugar on the rim as if it were some fancy cocktail ... let's just say I know posh when I see it.  Just kidding.  Cheesecake Factory's not posh.  It's just great if you want something substantial to eat that you probably have to get a box for after you're done mauling it."
Andrew S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,27,19,5.0,2/28/2011,"I just got back from here, we did some desserts and coffee - I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake because I'm a douche bag and I don't care what you think about me. I don't care how played out you may think Red Velvet is, you still live at home with your mom and she does your laundry. It was awesome, I'm awesome and you can kiss my grits. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it!"
Airi M.,"Pasadena, CA",266,62,7,4.0,11/7/2011,"More and more YES YES YES YUMMY... Artichoke and crab deep is my fav.. avocado eggrolls, fried calamari, magherita pizza, and tuxedo cheesecake are my usual orders.. I love all their appetizers yumyum"
Jacqueline T.,"Rosemead, CA",42,93,,1.0,10/11/2007,"This is my second bad experience at a Cheesecake location. I can't believe that a chain this large has associates that practice horrible customer service. The problem was a so-called manager. She was rude from the beginning of our dining experience all the way to the end. She used improper hand gestures to maneuver me to the other side of the counter to talk to her. She pounded on the counter to get my attention. I didn't appreciate that one bit.  We had a large party of about 25 people. Many people in our party were in disbelief that a woman in her position was so unprofessional. She walked over to our table asking how dinner was going . She had no intention in helping us to our needs. She gave us a dirty look like, ""Hello!  Do I look like your server???!!""  She waved down our waiter and told him to get us what we needed in a this-is-your-job-not-mine kind of attitude.  Instead, she gave us a lecture about splitting the bill. I've been to several Cheesecake locations and they all are capable of splitting the bill. She talked to us like we were children. She told us it would take an hour before the bill would be given to us if we split the bill. I've never experience such horrible service from any restaurant in my life!  My friends and I didn't appreciate her attitude and lack of customer service. I believe that she needs to be trained on professionalism and needs to understand the meaning of respect to her guests and her associates."
Lindsay L.,"Arcadia, CA",23,138,,4.0,7/27/2008,"My first visit here was so-so. I had the Chicken Madeira. First taste was great, but bite after bite i could taste the weird-alcohol tasting part of the dish. It made me a bit head-achey. However, i enjoyed eating the delicious mashed potatoes.  My next two visits here was actually very good! It's the type of dish you order is what makes the Cheesecake Factory worth the long wait! My first visit i got Farfalle and it was DELICIOUS! Its a rich-creamy white sauce with peas, bacon, bow-tie pasta, and more that i can't remember:) Talking about it makes me drool!  Third visit was great as well. I had Chicken Marsala and its very good! It has a light taste to it, but very pleasing. It had chicken over it which made it even more appetizing! The waiter was also very nice, connecting with us and getting our requests very fast.  AS FOR CHEESECAKES, THEY ARE THE BEST CHEESECAKES!!! MUST order one when you come here. I love the Vanilla bean cheesecake. I get it every time now."
Annie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,185,29,2.0,9/12/2007,"I realize I've been writing way too many 4 star reviews lately, so I'm going to reach into that part of my eating history I've long since tried to forget and bring up some of the not-so-fabulous memories. Ah, The Cheesecake Factory. You know, I actually used to like this place. Their appetizers are tasty, and there's such great variety in the menu that everyone can be satisfied even if they want very different cuisines.  Or so I thought. I came to the Arcadia branch not long after it opened because I was craving cheesecake and the jambalaya pasta. My favorite dish here, by far.  I remembered the pasta to have such an abundance of flavor and just the right amount of spice to make me fall in love after one bite, the first time around. (this was at the Grove location fyi) But I ordered it here and it was BLAND.  I couldn't believe it.  My favorite dish, stripped of its aroma, became just another untouched dish of pasta.  It was so bad that finally we bit the bullet and asked the waitress to take it back and fix it.  The chef was nice enough to concoct some more of the jambalaya sauce and brought that out to us to mix into the pasta, after which it started tasting more like it should.  But I do NOT have dulled taste buds!  In fact, most of the time I think there's too much salt in things.  I was definitely not imagining the subpar rendition of the Cheesecake Factory's menu here at this so-called restaurant.  To top it off, the fries were bad too! At least the Kahlua cheesecake was every bit as good as I remembered.  Thank goodness for small favors.  Needless to say, I never came back here again."
Greg P.,"Covina, CA",11,521,53,5.0,1/17/2007,"Finally, I don't have to drive to congested Pasadena anymore for this place, now I just have to drive to a congested mall parking lot! The Cheesecake Factory is always a default option for a nice dinner with your girl.  They have every type of food, but I tend to stick with 2 or 3 dishes.  You get some bread with your drinks, a white bread and some nutty brown bread that I always leave alone.  You get huge portions here and if you somehow have room left over, try a slice of cheesecake.  There are around 30 types to choose from and I haven't bitten into a bad one yet."
Mia L.,"San Diego, CA",578,1138,1507,4.0,2/4/2008,"1.16.07: I had a really packed day. I got off work around 6:30pm and my friend wanted to have dinner. For some reason he wouldn't back down on all the excuses I gave him. I needed to shop to get a dress for the Elevate event. I didn't want to come in board shorts, although I would definitely prefer that first.   Since I was already at the mall the first place I thought of was Cheesecake factory. I have gone to the Pasadena locations plenty of times. But it was my first time visiting Cheesecake in Arcadia. So as i walked in we were greeted with two smiling faces. We were seated immediately in the tinyest booth in the world. I hate those booths that cheesecake has. I'm not a big girl and well I felt like I was playing elbow games with the wall. Not feeling too comfortable we asked our waitress if we could switch booth and well she was really nice about it. So we went to the regular size booths and we sat comfortably. YEAH!   I wasn't really too hungry. I had the blt salad. I really like that for some reason. And we had bread. My friend had a salad as well. Oh how can I forget ordering soup. I ordered clam chowder. I have been craving for that lately. It tasted like any other clam chowder. I really love canned clam chowder it does not do me wrong. ha ha. That's the beauty of clam chowder.   No matter where I get my BLT salad its always going to be the same right? Of course how can you go wrong with lettuce, bacon and tomatoes? That's so simple right? YUP and that's exactly what I got. Simple just the way I like things.  Ended the meal well. Just sit and chit chat about the day. Bought a dress wasn't really too excited about it but its a dress at least. I reallly like this cheesecake though. Its not as crowded and its nice to enjoy a meal not feeling like your table is practically connected with some stranger.    4 stars for the service and the cleaniness. O and for the awesome salad. I tasted my friends chicken salad and that was good too. The chicken suprising was not dry. I'm picky with my chicken and this was a good chicken. ha ha.    4 stars!"
Pedro C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",47,98,22,5.0,6/25/2011,"Food is great, real fast service. I like they have little two seater booths. Me and my special girl can have a good meal, and talk about stuff. Red velvet cheesecake is delicious. Overall great place to dine at."
Jenn C.,"El Monte, CA",57,4,,1.0,9/1/2014,"i have never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory before, and in fact, we have dine here quite often.  last night, i went there for dinner with my boyfriend. i had no problem with my order but my boyfriend found a long white thick piece of paper in his fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. the paper was about 6inch long. we immediately sent the dish back and the manager came by to explain where the paper came from. she said, the pastas had those papers in between to keep them separated and sometimes those papers get stuck with the pasta and the cooks forget to remove them. my boyfriend did not want the same dish anymore so he switched his order to steak Dianne. when they delivered the dish, they didn't even bring a steak knife or offered him if he wanted steak sauce.  although the staffs were apologetic about this matter, we left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied. we were really nice about the whole matter and did not make a scene about it. although we were not charged for the fettuccine alfredo, we were charged for the steak he ordered. i felt as though, they should not even charged him for the steak because they had ruined our appetite.  they did not even offer us dessert on the house. thumbs down."
Aurora L.,"Hollywood, CA",338,94,112,5.0,2/11/2008,"Dude - 2.5 stars?? Whats up with the rating.. Cheesecake factory is BOMB ~ Anyway.. besides the waiters sometimes effin up my order.. everything else is pretty gravy. Waiters are always super polite - the food is always yummy.. and it has a great atmosphere. Not exactly worth going to on the weekends - Lines just are not my thing, But definitely after work.. on a weeknight is great. Portions are huge.. so no need to worry about lunch tomorrow :] I recommend - Appetizer  Avacodo eggrolls Ahi Tuna carpaccio - omg .. it feels like heaven"
Frank K.,"Boston, MA",135,190,1,4.0,3/12/2007,"You're probably wondering...why am I reviewing the Cheesecake Factory? In fact, why am I reviewing the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia when I, a HB resident, live near one only two minutes away? This one, that one, they're all the same...so...without further ado: I only stopped by for a martini, apparently a martini that even the Abbey, the manufacturer of all things -tini, can't get quite right. It was the key lime! I couldn't taste the martini at all, extra fruity is always a plus for an alcohol-loving but sensitve to the taste kind of guy like myself. Just the wonderful fruitiness burning my nose! Yum! I was pleasantly surprised as you could tell. And their chocolate mousse cheesecake was great, too. Very rich. I just wanted to let any Cheesecake Factory loving Yelper know that if you're feeling the thirst for a nice cocktail while dining here, order the key lime! Maybe you like stronger taste in alcohol, but for those with a sensitive appreciation for alcohol (aka lightweights), try it. Actually, everyone try it."
Connie C.,"West Covina, CA",6,9,,3.0,3/10/2009,Everytime i go i always order the Chicken Costaleta (something like that) THAT IS THE BEST!  I give that 4 stars.... however.....  do not ever order an alcoholic beverage from here. 1. it takes forever to get it and 2. there is NO alcohol (that i could taste) in any of their drinks. Its like your paying $10 for a fruity non-alcoholic beverage.  service is decent. they are always nice and attentive.
Miko X.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/6/2013,"Last night we went to grab a drink.. the food was good. we ordered the Dynamite Shrimp, Calamari, and Potstickers. We sat at the bar... worst bar service ever. Either that or I have been spoiled by other bar seated service. My glass sat empty for at least 30 minutes before I had to ask the bartender for a drink. There were 2 bartenders, one working the well and the other working the bar, which only had about 10 seats. Service was slow and not served with a smile. Very disappointed. When we left we decided we would not be back."
