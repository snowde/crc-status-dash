Ana L.,"Alhambra, CA",587,157,103,4.0,8/27/2008,"Long lines. Good food. Worth it. CF has always been one of my favorite restaurants, so I don't really mind the long waits. I came here on Thursday night and there was no line at all.  I usually just order some sort of pasta, but I probably tried all the pasta dishes on the menu.. so I decided to try something else. I got the Renee's Special and I am so happy with my decision! It comes with a cup of the soup of the day, salad, and a half of a sandwich. I have no complaints about the soup and the salad, but the turkey sandwich was a bit dry IMO. :\  Some of my favorites at CF : Louisana Ckn Pasta Pasta Da Vinci  Buffalo Blasts Fried Calamari Factory Nachos Shrimp Scampi  Spicy Ckn Chipotle Pasta A+ on the environment & service!"
M. G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,55,2,2.0,3/3/2011,"I can't think of a good reason to spend an hour or more of my life waiting in line to eat at this joint.  Yeah, a lot of teenie boppers have to go on dates and this is the first place that enters their mind, but 1+ hour?  Parking at Westfield is as fun as watching grass grow.  If it's cheesecake you're after, do yourself a favor and take it to go while someone waits in the car by the sidewalk."
Mrs A.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,24,5,5.0,6/20/2011,5 stars for the best Chicken Cesar salad. This dressing is so good my mouth waters as I wait for it to arrive
Rachel G.,"Ventura, CA",0,17,1,4.0,6/19/2009,Lots of food to choose from....of course the cheesecake is great. Service is okay....nice ambiance. You can't really go wrong here :)
Tawny A.,"Newport, RI",210,641,231,1.0,8/24/2009,"So I am allergic to mushrooms. This is something I always mention to the wait staff where-ever I go. I will not necessarily swell up and die, but I will have trouble breathing and a awful tummy ache will follow. ONE WOULD THINK.......that the staff at a major restaurant such as Cheesecake Factory would know what the components of the dishes they offer are......... I do not go to CF a lot. Maybe once a year, if that. But I always tend to get the Pasta Da Vinci. And I order it with no mushrooms and I always say that I am allergic to stress the importance of not having them put in the damn dish. Its not a 5 star place where modifications are frowned upon. Its a national chain and customer service is stressed there. BUT after I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci takeout the other night and there were mushrooms in it.....the RUDE manager informed me that the sauce itself is mushroom based. So of course he didn't believe me that I am allergic. Here is the thing......I don't do a lot of dairy but sometimes you just need a slice of cheesecake......so usually when I get the pasta dish, I have cheesecake. So if I don't feel well after I always assumed I ate too much or blamed it on the cake. Ok. I admit my fault here. But If I say to a waiter, no mushrooms because I am allergic and they fail to mention that the dish is mushroom based sauce....even though the mushrooms are not visible.....where is the blame?  The problem here is the rude manager who said he would call me back rather than apologize and help me out. I had to go back to the restaurant and talk to a different manager to clear the mess up. All I wanted was a refund. I brought the pasta back. I have told everyone I work with, all my friends and my dentist office about this place and I hope that at least 30 of them never go there again. Maybe it won't impact them at all....but please.....if you love food, do not eat at a place that cares so little for the well being of their patrons. can't people take legal action for crap like this? huh."
Sharon S.,"Torrance, CA",157,348,7,3.0,6/21/2010,"My opinion of this place is a little... wobbly. Uneven. Maybe even locally inconsistent. We put our name in for a group of 13- the (very animated) hostess informed us it would be an hour, but she would see if she could work something out. She made sure to keep us updated, which I thought was nice.  However, when we got to our table, the waitress was kind of... abrupt? Now, I understand we're being seated at a time that's precariously close to the time they shut down, but still... Please don't bark out the question, ""Can I grab that plate?"" and then snatch it from across the table.  Plus, the gal forgot to take half the table's drink order. Lame-ness. The food is decent- the spinach dip was delish, and the Miso Salmon was very moist. Sadly, it didn't warm up so well the next day. By the time we could have ordered dessert, the boy and I were ready to pass out, so sadly we didn't get to enjoy any of the lacto-licious offerings. This place has a good location- near a mall, so you can get your consumerist urges taken care of, then gorge yourself on cheesecake. (Hey, sounds like a good day to me!) But if you don't like crowds of rambunctious teens trying to start fights, I'd say ask for a table inside."
Jay Jay T.,"Seal Beach, CA",24,28,2,4.0,10/4/2010,"Came here for dinner with the family.  Told us the wait would be about 20 minutes, but it was less than 5 minutes.  Which was a good thing because we were all hungry.  They now have Dr Pepper on their soda list which was also a plus for us because we love Dr Pepper.  We ordered the spaghetti pasta for the kids which was delicious.  The spinach artichoke dip, rib-eyed steak, and shrimp pasta with angel hair (but we substituted it for linguine instead)..All was great, minus there wasn't much flavor to the linguine pasta.  Our server was very nice and friendly and loaded us with plenty of bread... Overall I was satisfied with our dinner."
Cindy S.,"Whittier, CA",34,69,24,3.0,6/28/2010,"I really like the food and I haven't had bad service and the Hibachi steak is to die for BUT the thing that annoys me is they try to stuff you in a table fit for sardines. Seriously. I usually go there on date nights with my husband and I don't want to be elbow to elbow with strangers. Now, when I go I say I want a booth and walla, solves the problems."
Joanna B.,"Altadena, CA",1,40,,4.0,2/17/2013,"Love the ""skinny"" Caesar salad and warm dark bread. Service hit and miss. Do not go at the regular lunch or dinner hours - very long wait. A good place to go when at the mall."
Drew A.,"San Marino, CA",1,49,4,2.0,3/7/2012,now why i know why i dont go to large chain restaurants anymore. the place was so dark couldnt see my food. my turkey burger tasted like it never met salt or pepper. the best thing about my meal was the passion fruit ice tea..
Catherine C.,"Arcadia, CA",32,61,27,4.0,11/10/2009,"Yeah this place is good but do we need to read a novel and spend a half an hour looking over the menu before we decide what to get? It's a little overwelming. ""look at the chicken sandwich that looks good...oh it's on page 214 right below the cruise line advertisement."""
Kevin C.,"Pasadena, CA",1839,882,1721,3.0,4/24/2008,"Went last night for a B-day dinner late: Good:  -Food tasted great -Dessert was amazing -Friends where wonderful as usual -Service was attentive (although not sure what she was saying and I am good with Asian accents) -Got about $20 comp. (see bad) Bad: -Found a Hair (long hair not my own beard hair) in one of my slider burgers -Long Island Ice Tea tasted like Lemonade and rather than make it stronger the bar tender insisted it has 2 shots of alcohol in it and wouldn't do anything to fix that Felt bad for our server cause it was like the bartender and cooks where really working hard to F her over on her tip, none of that stuff was her fault so we gave her a nice tip anyway Over all had fun, ate too much and had a funny hair reference to joke about all night...like Neil Patrick Harris Says, "" Yeah I want some burgers, Fur Burgers!!!!"""
Priscilla H.,"San Gabriel, CA",44,146,5,3.0,4/7/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is a little lackluster for me. I used to love this place... but recently, the food is just blah. Plus I got a mudpie dessert but sub'd the pie with chris's crazy chocolate cake.... and there was something in there... like a foil or something.... ew.  The service is usually good. I like their large menu and portions. But really the only thing that I think is super yummy is their cheesecake."
insider g.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,9,,2.0,6/8/2008,"A friend  ask me for lunch at this Arcadia location. Normally i wouldn't want to go  there because i seen how crowded they can get  and they dont except reservations. But this was Tuesday, around 1pm so i decided to go. When i got there, i found the place to be pretty empty, which is a good thing because who wants to wait? we were seated by a hostess.given menus by a waitress then she told us another waitress will be taken over for her.  o.k no problem On to the menu: it's like  reading a magazine, it went on and on and on.........had to tell   the waitress , i needed more time but i ordered a drink--The Ultimate Margarita ( sounds good right?) i get back to that my friend ordered Lunch Special: 1/2 sandwich, salad.soup i ordered: Kobe burger on Broiche bun with fries from under specialties..i ordered  the burger to be  cook medium, after she asked ...how i wanted done Back to the Drink: It was small glass. too much ice, your basic water down weak drink. it was just WEAK......... The Food:  My friend  seem happy with his food. it would be hard to F* up a  1/2 turkey sandwich, soup, salad. My Food: well, the kobe burger on toasted broiche which they say on the menu came out on a  sesame bun. i didn't say anything to the food runner who brought  us the food or to the waitress . It's not their fault..it's the kitchen fault.. She never ask me if i wanted another drink--Which is fine by me , because who want to pay $$ for a slightly flavor water? Overall: it was o.k food ,nothing special. Would i be thinking about   going there next time to eat or have a drink?  NO Will i go and buy cheesecake at the counter? YES I would have given this place 3 stars but i'm only giving 2 because they serve me sesame bun, when it  printed broiche bun on the menu..and the Super WEAK drink"
Nik N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,134,48,1.0,10/17/2010,"I will not be returning to this restaurant and don't plan to recommend this branch to my friends, family nor will have business dinners there.  The hostess Gizelle/Gizella...she could be called Gorilla for all I care was horrible. Worst service ever for food that's just ok...  Because of her, they've lost my business."
Anna C.,"Arcadia, CA",47,36,1,1.0,8/2/2010,"UPDATE: several attempts to solve this problem with the managers were unsuccessful.  They would keep telling us to call back while a different one on shift.  After time, my friend did a successful charge back with his credit card company. Check your statements afterward..."
Cee. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,81,33,5.0,3/19/2010,"Cheesecake factory is simply D E L I C I O U S. I've have never ordered anything from here that didn't taste amazing. I've had everything from their calamari to pizza to the chicken and pasta dishes. And man no one does mashed potatoes and broccoli like the cheesecake factory. Who would think that such simple items could be so delicious when soaked in butter. Haha. It's actually very sad that I don't remember the name of my favorite dish here--it's been awhile--but it's simply breaded chicken breasts fillets cooked in a white wine sauce. This paired with the broccoli and mashed potato side dishes is making my mouth water just now. This dish is so astonishing and flavorful that that dish itself earns a 5 star. Although the food here is probably not good for health-conscious people, I think an exception can be made because the food here is just too good to pass up. Even the free bread they give you is amazing. The honey wheat bread is the best, the sourdough is ok.  I don't remember how the service was because all I could think of was the food. But with great tasting food, who cares about the service so long as you get your food.  Fyi, parking near the restaurant sucks, so come at a weird time to eat or else you'll get really frustrated from looking for parking. Although I'm pretty sure the food here will very easily calm you down, looking for parking for half an hour is still no fun and certainly not something I look forward to."
Noname B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,1/7/2013,overpriced. Definately not worthy. I'll cook you a same dish with the half price and no tips needed!!
joanna e.,"Pasadena, CA",68,271,9,3.0,9/12/2007,"Am I the only one that leaves Cheesecake Factory sleepy almost 100% of the time? I'm sitting at my desk at work on the cusp of falling asleep... it just never fails. Anyway... this cheesecake factory was nothing special, same decor, same ads in the menu.... no variety and distinction whatsoever. What else can you expect from a chain? I get the same thing all the time here: Passion Fruit Iced Tea and Shrimp Scampi. Taste is consistent amongst all CF's - so that's always good. Not my favorite restaurant, but highly suggest for a random lunch or dinner. Although, seeing as to how they're next door to Woodranch, I think I would much rather go there. HAHA.. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory!"
Wayne K.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,105,,4.0,12/11/2010,"Delicious. I would avoid anything deep fried though, like the chicken tenders."
