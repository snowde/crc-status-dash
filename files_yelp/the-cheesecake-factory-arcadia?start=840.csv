Natalie D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",40,163,11,5.0,1/13/2010,Really great service. Open till 11. The greek salad was to die for. The bread came out super hot and soft. Drinks never hit the bottom. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmm.
Anita I.,"San Gabriel, CA",277,320,11,4.0,2/22/2009,"to me, cheesecake factory is just another american fusiony chain restaurant.  There is nothing really that special about the place except for the fact that their menu is ginormous and takes forever to look through.  The dishes are huge so expect to share with someone!  i really like their new appetizer menu that has items $5 and less!  I ordered the fried artichoke hearts which cost me less than $4.  It came with about 8 peices.  Not a bad deal!  I'm not sure if i would come here regularly other than the fact that my bf had a giftcard and a $10 coupon with a free slice of cheesecake.  The service was friendly and we got a table on the patio fairly quick even though they said it would take about 30 minutes. not too bad, but nothing special."
danica c.,"Irvine, CA",178,228,40,2.0,9/15/2009,"I don't like Cheese Cake Factory, there I said it!  I only like the cheese cakes (1 star for the restaurant's original purpose), but even then I have had far better NY style cheese cakes...  I have never been impressed by their food and selections, not even the drinks.  I don't know why people like it so much, it's not hip and not impressive.  The food selection is the same as any other American style restaurant, only it doesn't taste very good.  I am sorry, but the services is not that great neither.  I came here 10 years ago for the first time and was not impressed, 10 year later I like this place even less..."
Tiffany Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",462,129,568,3.0,1/24/2010,"This use to be one of my favorite spots. Until tonight. Dundundunnn. Walked in. Waited in a pretty damn long line to get one of those nifty beeper thingys. Host told us ""Mmm about 30-35 mins."" Ok, cool. Not bad for a crowded night like tonight. Tick tock. Fam bam (grandma + aunt) & I waited. And waited. And waited... for a hour and half. Fed up, we got up to complain, but waddaya know? The lil beeper starts beepbeeping and vibrating. Thank goodness. Sat at a booth. I know about the specials the waiter/waitress has to say before saying anything else. But it's always nice to be reminded. But not with this waitress. It went a little like this... ""Just to let you know we AHYADDAYADDAYADDAFISHYADDAYADDASALADYADDABLAH if you have any questions let me know."" Uh, saywut? On to the foooood. Ordered my usual. Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms. Grandma had no idea what was on the menu so she ordered the Grilled Chicken + Avocado Club. Aunt got the Garlic noodles by itself (Chicken & shrimp are optional. Additional costs.) Got a glass of Strawberry Lemonade as well. Before today & a month ago when I was here with my bf, anything I ordered here was MMMouthgasmic. When I came here with my boyfraaand about last month, it wasnt that yummy but I thought it was cause I wasn't all that hungry. But today proved me wrong. Same taste. BLAND. Its not as delicious as it use to be. I dont know if they've been noticing the ""obese"" kids, or they're watching their own diet, but c'mon! My dish tasted like there was no season in it at all. Wheres the marsala wine? Jeez. & my family are already on a loooow-sodium diet due to health problems. Sigh. And when my strawberry lemonade was almost emptied, I left it near the edge of the table so our waitress could see it. & she did. But I wasnt able to see her take my cup & leave. Just like her intro in the beginning, she snatched my cup away before I could blink. Snatched! And i'll assume she mumbled ""I'll be back with your drink."" Or something similar. Eh. The sandwich my grandma ordered, was pretty yum. But seriously. Its only a chicken+avocado club. I can make that easy peasy at home. I didnt try the dish my aunt ordered, but I saw that she had to add salt to it. My grandma didnt like it. TASTELESSSS. My strawberry lemonade was ok. A little too soury, then a little too sweet. My grandma & aunt liked it. My grandma isnt a fan of sweet or sour things, but she kept stealing a few sips here and there. I guess that says something. Check came to about $60 with tip. Not too bad. Service was ok today. Food.... eh. Not so sure about that. Love the 2 types of bread they give you before your orders come. Sad. Paid $60 for ehh-quality food. But the free bread, DELISH! nomnomnom :3 The next time I come here... i'll be going next door. Woodranch Grill. OOOHMAMMA!"
Jay L.,"Ontario, CA",484,163,55,1.0,6/24/2011,"they screwed up my birthday.  told me the wait time is 1 and half hour, but it took nearly 3 hours to sit down.  they split my table into small tables and unwilling to change it even the table is available.  I have to say that this place should not be considered if you wish to have a birthday dinner.  Terrible service as well."
Kevin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",320,101,20,4.0,3/16/2009,NOOOOOOoooOO! They pulled the seared albacore from the menu!!  I'm gonna go throw myself off a bridge.
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,3.0,12/18/2008,"My friend Ruel and his honorable parents had R.S.V.P.'s     Heeey, make a R,S.V.P. and wait in the lobby forever and ever on a busy weekend...      Then.....they call us to the table....and they decide to play musical chairs and they didn't make the table area big enough for our party.      Something else happened that night and to this day, I never have figured it out...but all I know, is it takes a hella of a lot to get this family mad....but, once you do...it's time for me to keep my distance for awhile.         The drinks came, and of course, they messed up the drinks.       Then the food came and you got it, they messed up the food order too, just like the drinks...   The employees here, are kinda not with the program...  They are really nice people, but a little forgetful..... I didn't mind, but my friends did...       Then I had to park far away ...and ...I mean I couldn't find my car out in all that mess...       I gave them 3 stars....shoulda been four for the food.."
Christina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,53,1,3.0,6/5/2010,"I absolutely love the oatmeal wheat bread they give you! It is so moist and delicious. However, their actual meals are not that great. Most of them are very salty and do not compare to their prices (food is actually pretty pricey). I tried their turkey sandwich and I feel like I can make the same thing at home. Also, my sister got their angel hair pasta with the shrimp and it is just ordinary too! The wait for the food is usually very long too, but at least the service is decent! I would come back for the bread, but the food is just not that great."
Emily F.,"Temple City, CA",285,130,24,3.0,11/24/2009,"this place is just so ""meh."" there's no other word to describe cheesecake factory. the food is not disgusting, but it's not great. everything is just o.k........ and for the price of the food, it's not something to be happy about. cheesecake is lovely!! cheesecake factory should just stick to what it's good at. cheesecake. i've ordered almost everything off the menu, pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, meat dishes. blah blah blah blah. i keep giving it chances. the only think i could ever enjoy eating was the chicken madeira. boyfriend likes the steak dianne as well. the cajun pasta was slightly better than ok too. pizzettes are nummy! much better than an actual pizza here. i don't know. i like this place and i hate it too. haha what a dilemma. oh the bread is good though! compared to cpk's stale loafs. my dad likes them. why do i keep giving them chance after chance. disappointment after disappointment, they are still making money off of me. i guess i kind of like it. or do i? also the orange lights on each booth makes me think of eyes of sauron. (you know? lord of the rings..) and it's too dark if you end up in the corner of the restaurant. i feel like i'm going blind after half an hour in here."
Kevin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",367,281,548,4.0,1/16/2009,"I like the Cheesecake factory. I sometimes feel that this restaurant has become our ""safety net"". My gf and I are very indecisive eaters. We can literally spend an hour talking about where we want to eat. We spend so much time trying to decide on where to eat that we are eventually no longer hungry (no joke). In these times of uncertainty, we turn to The Cheesecake Factory. We are rarely disappointed and almost always satisfied. The menu is so big that we literally order something different each time we come. Here are the things that we've tried that stood out to me: Platinum Mohito, Avocado Eggrolls, Chicken Medeira, Pasta Da Vinci, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Orange Chicken, Pistachio Cheesecake, and Blueberry-White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake.   The Mohito is nice and refreshing for those that like to order alcohol with their meals.  The avocado eggrolls are listed under the appetizers, but for a meal for two, it can really serve as an entree.  For avocado-lovers, these eggrolls are stuffed with it.  The chicken medeira is a classic dish here, and probably a popular one too, and is good if you're looking for a good chicken dish (comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus).  The Pasta Da Vinci and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta are my two faves within their choices for pastas, both tasty, although the jambalaya comes with shrimp and is a little bit on the spicier side.  Just recently, we had a craving for orange chicken, and could not think of any other place to go for it.  The orange chicken here is different.. we were expecting it to taste like the one similar to Panda Express, but were pleasantly surprised.  The chicken pieces were bigger, and the orange-tasting coating had a slight hint of wasabi to it.  Definitely unique in taste.   Of course, The Cheesecake Factory is obviously known for their cheesecakes.  Of the ones we've tried, definitely go with the pistachio or the blueberry white chocolate truffle.  These are both not on the menu, and were ""specialty"" items that the waiter had told us about when we ordered.  But definitely ask about them, because you cant go wrong with these (the blueberry is my personal fave). The portions are pretty big but we always find room for dessert.   As usual, even with two entrees each we always have leftovers, so we've started to order an appetizer and an entree when it's just the two of us.  If you're looking for variety, come here.  You cant really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory."
Kimberly O.,"Pasadena, CA",3,8,,1.0,6/24/2008,"Last Friday I attempted the Cheesecake Factory once more.  Once again I found ridiculous portions trying to mask the meritocracy of the food.   However, this time was a bit different then my initial visit.  We did not have to wait to be seated.  We had a party of seven, and all but one of our plates were received in a timely matter.  (The last came after everyone else had finished eating....they did comp this meal)  This was a bit of an improvement. Then it hit, about two hours later.  I had the chicken baja tacos.  I was the only one in my party to eat chicken.  OMG!   Severe stomach cramps.  SEVERE!   Followed by the next 24 hours of camping my butt on the toilet with a garbage can between my knees.   I am writing this review four days later, and I still can not keep solid food down.  The doctor stated that it could take as long as 10 days.  I recently had mono, lost a bit of weight, but the cheesecake factory takes the gold metal for a drastic drop in pounds.   This establishment is not tasty enough to take a chance.  It is an over rated chain.  Nothing better then TGIF's, Applebees, etc.   If you are looking for mediocre, try something cheaper with better food quality."
J H.,"CA, CA",17,112,8,3.0,4/12/2007,"Good ole' Cheesecake Factory - we stumbled  onto this one while perusing through Santa Anita Mall.   We were thinking CPK, but since there was no wait. 'gasp'  are you freakin kidding me, there's always a wait at CF!  Nope, I'm not kidding, no wait.  How could we even think about BBQ chicken pizza at CPK.   I always have the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad at CF.  I've had almost every appetizer on their menu (I used to work across the street from the one in San Francisco) and they're all good.  I've also had a few of their entrees, but the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is my fave.   This is one of those places that I like going to, the food is good, the service is usually good, and most people are agreeable to going there.  Then they see the line out front. So, if there's no wait, go for it.  If there is a wait, I'd either order to go or go somewhere else. If you haven't been to any CF, try to go at least once in your life and have a slice of cheesecake for me."
Lilly N.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,218,42,3.0,8/27/2009,"I've been here twice and the food is okay.. but i'll admit i'm not a fan of mac and cheese, but their fried mac and cheese is sooooooo gooodd!!! I ordered it and a lot of people loved it!! Last time I got the Chinese Chicken Salad and boy it was HUGE!!! but it was good.. of course I couldn't finish it but it was good.. The bread was good I've always got them hot.. I don't really recall what i got from my very first time here.. I believe it was lamb or chicken or something but It wasn't good. It was dry and tasteless.. the waiter there is kinda whatevers.. because my friend and I were eating about for about an hour and he didn't even come back to asked how was our meal or what not.. up until an hour in a half he came back to asked ""if everything was okay"" so we thought ""dang we wouldn't have gotten our ketchup until now"" (cos my friend wanted ketchup, but the guy walked away so fast we didn't even get a chance to ask).. I heard the cheesecake is good.. I not really a big fan of cheese cake. After taking 4 bites i'm sick of it.. but the only cheese cake i'll actually take a bite out of is original one.. Maybe one day I'll end up trying something different..."
Mieko U.,"Pasadena, CA",19,19,,2.0,12/24/2008,"I have been here multiple times expecting to maybe actually like my food for once but of course, I am still not impressed.  To be honest, I am FAR from impressed..I am going to say this restaurant is bad.  I've had basically all of their pastas and they all taste the same! No really, I can't taste the difference between any of their pastas..they're all creamy/oily and soo filling that you just feel gross after maybe three bites.  Do you want to spend $20+ dollars for that? I won't ever again."
Suzy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,252,580,3.0,9/13/2008,"Is it just me or are prices at this place getting higher and higher?  I wanted some tuna tataki the other night so I came here to see what they had.  A seared tuna salad is now $17 - hmmm.....I think that's kind of steep in this type of setting and Cheesecake isn't known to have the greatest food either.  Even though we were already seated, we decided to get up and drive straight to Sushi Gen for some delicious sashimi.  Yes, random - but I'd rather pay more for darn good food."
Jen C.,"Arcadia, CA",22,10,17,4.0,3/14/2009,"I had the chicken basil penne pasta & avocado roll which was all very good. Food portion is enough for 2 if you are not that Hungary.  I stop ordering alcoholic drinks here because it's too sweet and water down w/ ice, I would suggest to do shots or just go with beer instead.  Service was good, cheesecake is awesome, had the Godiva chocolate MMmmm.   The best of all is that you can go shopping afterward and walk it off.  : )"
Windella D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,117,,1.0,4/13/2012,"i was underwhelmed with Cheesecake Factory. It was cold and raining and since I don't drink coffee,I decided to order cocoa. MISTAKE! It was warm,not hot,it came with whipped cream & chocolate syrup on top which makes it pretty but further cooled it down,made the drink too sweet and too strong a chocolate flavor. $4.00 for a cup of cocoa? really? My sister and I shared the chicken samosas which were greasy and I didn't care for the seasonings. I ordered ""Renee's Special,which is half a sandwich( I ordered turkey) a small salad and a bowl of soup. The bread on the sandwich was so hard I couldn't eat it. The salad had so much bitter lettuce,I only ate half of it and the clams in the clam chowder were chewy,more potatoes and carrots in the soup than needed to be. The brown bread placed on the table was very good,cold butter and all. I ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake to go which was tasty but so thick you can hardly taste the crust and I like graham cracker crust. I asked for a container to take the sandwich home( I have fresh bread at home I can replace their hard bread with) the waitress grabbed the plate and said""I'll help you with that"" I hate when the wait staff does that! just give me a container,I don't know what your hands have touched,you brought my plate to the table,ok,but now you're picking up my sandwich? good thing I won't be eating the bread! I will not return."
Maleka G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,,4.0,2/2/2010,"I've been to different Cheesecake Factories and i have to say the one in Arcadia is GREAT!!! the host or hostesses greeting at the door are friendly and pleasant. the servers are up beat, friendly, and attentive. the menu with smaller portions and affordable prices has made me come back and come back for more. the atmosphere is soothing after a long days of work and a place to enjoy with friends and family. the birthday singing is great and very thoughtful of the servers to take their time to sing to customers. it's real nice. I love this Cheesecake Factory!"
Christina L.,"Alhambra, CA",52,13,320,4.0,7/8/2011,the lunch portion price is good.  i loved the shrimp bistro pasta and the dessert was amazing..i always order the godiva chocholate cake with vanilla ice cream scoop.. the beverage sucked tho.
