Luis V.,"Pasadena, CA",6,41,8,3.0,9/12/2011,"nice place, nothing new here.  went here for lunch, not too busy and my waiter was very pleasant. they have good bread when seated that my girlfriend loves, well its more the butter that they give, but they do have good sourdough.  i got a bacon burger with sweet potato fries, the fries are awesome and the meal was good."

Ryan H.,"Alhambra, CA",4,58,,4.0,10/22/2011,"I like this Cheesecake Factory at the mall. It is very convenient to eat some food that is not the food court. This Cheesecake Factory is big which is what I like most about it. The Pasadena location is way too small.  The decor here is like most Cheesecake Factories; it is very nice and clean. The service here is great; I have had very friendly waiters every time I have come. The food here is great. Starting off with their bread, it is very delicious especially when it is warm and fresh. The French baguette and wheat bread are both fantastic! My favorite is the wheat though. Hands down. The last time I came I ate from their new skinnylicious menu. I ordered the shrimp soft tacos. They were very tasty, fresh, and juicy. I loved how they were only 500 calories and only 3-4 grams of fat. Most of the items from their regular menu, though tasty and big portioned, are calorie-packed and filled with saturated fat. If you do not care about the nutritional facts, try their pasta dishes, steaks, seafood, steak and seafood combos, and all their other entrees. I can guarantee you they will be of good quality. For dessert, definitely try their variety of cheesecakes. Some of my personal favorites are the vanilla bean cheesecake, the oreo cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake (though at times too sweet for my taste), and many others ! The price is pretty standard for a restaurant like this. For an entree, drink, and dessert, it's about $30 a person (depending on your entree). Definitely try The Cheesecake Factory the next time you are at Santa Anita Mall."
Paul B.,"Temple City, CA",5,58,,3.0,7/29/2009,I always enjoy the cheesecake selections.  I've probably tried half the list.  The food however has gotten poor along with the service.  The utencils are dirty please check them.  I've had to tell the server about it over 4 times.  I eat here often before a movie at the bar.  Sitting is always faster at the bar.  The bartender Kiet is the best employee there.
See L.,"San Gabriel, CA",196,193,177,3.0,3/1/2011,"come here with patience... if you can wait, you can eat, if you can't, don't even try! the wait here sometimes Is so so long.. im not the type who can stand and wait, but birthdays are exceptions! their service is pretty good! should be since it's American!  I usually go for the pasta. but I found out their pasta is like 2,400 calories:( wowwwwwww.. it's almost a pound.. in other case, the wait is too long! but everything is okay.."
Miranda L.,"Alhambra, CA",57,43,35,4.0,3/31/2009,i love the decor in this restaurant.  all the dishes ive ever ordered were all delicious. portions are good as well. i feel the prices are a bit pricy on some of the dishes. and pricy deserts too. the chicken picada and chicken marsala taste the best here over all the other restaurants i tried.
betty c.,"Arcadia, CA",8,125,4,3.0,12/18/2008,cheesecake factory quality in this branch is disappointing service also lacking compared to its pasadena branch the only good thing is that the wait is a lot shorter than the pasadena one i like the pasta da vinci and the avocado egg rolls
Lisa W.,"Alhambra, CA",881,507,1167,1.0,3/21/2010,"ugh i hate cheesecake factory. the food is overpriced and it only tastes mediocre. everytime i come here, im always disappointed with my food. the only thing i wasnt disappointed with was their cheesecakes and the ceaser salad. (but how can you mess up cheesecake when its in your name, and if you mess up a salad, then youre in big trouble)."
Timmy L.,"El Monte, CA",35,12,,3.0,3/1/2009,"Cheesecake factory is basically American that costs more for a classier setting. To be honest, I felt it almost like an expensive Denny's and I felt I would've just been as happy eating at Denny's.There were a few more diverse dishes on the menu like miso seasoned salmon but not that many. The place is right by the mall so parking can be tough to find, especially if you want to park within easy walking distance. The inside is quite nice but the lighting is dimmer than some Olive Gardens I've been to and I remember my grandparents complaining that they couldn't read the menu. When it came to the food, it was not bad. . However, I kinda expect that since i was paying quite a few bucks more like $12 for a burger. A slice of cheesecake was like $7.25. Therefore, if you are going to try this place, you should be willing to spend the money. The portion sizes vary upon the dishes but in generally they can be quite large and the average person won't be able to eat more than a dish. 75% of the plate if you don't want to feel to full and have room for dessert. Overall, the food is good (4-stars), but you can probably do better with your money."
Joe T.,"West Covina, CA",2,18,,2.0,3/21/2009,"First time ever to a Cheesecake Factory. Thought I would pick this location since it's located at a mall, and I can go watch a movie afterwards. First of all, I like the decoration in this restaurant. Pretty fancy in my opinion and the lighting is quite nice for a date. That said, I hate this place and will probably never come back again, or to any Cheesecake factory perhaps. I came only because my friend wanted to try it and its his birthday. We waited over 1.5 hr to be seated. Why? Because the pager malfunction on us. Not once, but two times! Failed to vibrate both times. Funniest thing was that I was standing by the front desk where they were activating the pagers. The hostress even knew my name, put my name down both times, and saw me stood right in front of her! You would think she will have the smarts to recognized that she paged my name and didnt go up and maybe something was wrong? Ugh..waited 45 min first time. Another 45 min 2nd time. Had to go up to her the 3rd time to tell her that the pager failed AGAIN! Finally got a sit after waiting 1.5 hr.  Make sure you go up and check if you dont get paged within 20 min! Food was only okay. If i wanted Italian food or some kind of sandwich, I would go to an Italian restaurant or sandwich specialty restaurant. I thought they might have something fancy, but no. Totally overpriced too. I love cheesecakes, especially those that is a bit firm and not too sweet. But cheesecakes here? Blah. Too sweet and too soft. Maybe it was out of the freezer too long and the waiter didnt have time to go pick it up so it was melting by the time it got to us. Way too sweet. If you want diabetes, go eat their cheesecake. I will stick with my Costco ones."
Cleo M.,"Oakland, CA",109,144,5,1.0,6/14/2007,"This location just opened but it has already gotten off to a bad start... I went here for a birthday celebration - I decided I would get the Shrimp Bistro that I got at Marina Del Rey. The entree comes with spaghetti noodles in a lemon basil white cream sauce and breaded shrimp. I substitute the breaded shrimp with unbreaded shrimp. I find it disturbing that they would put breaded shrimp in pasta. We wait and wait...then the foods comes out. I didn't get my food like everybody else - though I did order the same pasta dish as the birthday girl. I get my food after an extra 15 minute wait on top of the 30 minute wait, this does not include the 40+ minutes we waited to be seated. My plate has angel hair pasta, I didn't ask for angel hair plus it doesn't even come with angel hair. The fact that I was hungry and waited an hour for my meal got the better of me. I tried to send it back but the waitress resisted. There was absolutely no flavor that sauce ever touched the noodles and to make it worse my shrimp tasted unclean, grainy and very fishy. I know shrimps come from the sea but they shouldn't taste like the sea. Too bad the waiters can't cook the food because they were so nice to us...but then again great customer service doesn't guarantee good food."
James W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",59,1025,49,5.0,4/5/2009,"My wife and I have eaten here no less than 5-6 times and the service and food are always great. Servers are courteous and the food is tasty. We usually share a salad and pasta and then save room for cheesecake. Today, we tried the 30th anniversary cheesecake (chocolate layered cheesecake) and it was phenomenal. There is usually always a wait (we waited 10 minutes today) for a table, but they provide a pager to notify you when your table is available. The portions are huge, so always keep that in mind. The environment is upscale and we love going to the Cheesecake Factory ! Afterward, we walk around Santa Anita Mall and browse the shops and relax. Great way to enjoy Sunday in Southern California !"
Jill X.,"Temple City, CA",0,183,35,3.0,9/8/2011,"in Westfield Santa Anita, the cheesecake is always good like the strawberry short cake, and the starting bread is very good!"
M W.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/6/2011,"This is my go-to American restaurant. I love love love the lemon-herb roasted chicken. The chicken is always so good (but be careful because they tend to burn the chicken accidentally) and the mash potatoes is amazingggg. Also the carrots that come with the dish is a little sweet so it tastes great, too. I also love the strawberry lemonade. It comes with a sugar-coated rim which is rare on a non-alcoholic beverage haha this is a really nice restaurant. The inside is really pretty and just a great interior and great place. You must try it!"
Sendy S.,"Glendora, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/26/2012,"Management should reconsider allowing reservations or special events planning through out the operating hours. It is very much appreciated. What's not appreciated is that no employees is even considerate enough to offer accommodation for big party (10 & up) seating even when there is enough outdoor seating? Honestly, tables with no customers seating on them are just plain waste. Out of your own employee's convenience, you would rather have your customers wait 1~1.5 hours for the indoor seating. If this is what Cheesecake Factory call good business sense, I doubt anyone would make sense of it all. If all of your food chains are operating under the same system as the one in Arcadia, I would rather go to my preferred restaurant and/or eat at home. I had food and service much better than this that offer much better accommodation to the customer needs. I am not asking for ""Customer is number one"" just make some compromise and better accommodations when possible. The most disappointing restaurant experience I had. BTW, I ate at your neighbor's instead that day. So did other customer that you practically turned away."
K C.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",3,46,10,2.0,3/2/2011,"have not gone there in a long time so decide to re-visit the host was very nice a polite and we got a table in no times. our waitress needs to slow down when introducing new dishes...she speak so damn fast she has to stop and SUCK in air afterward. my friend ordered fish and chip looks pretty good and taste good too. i order fettuccine with chicken and sundries tomato, halp way thru dinner I notice the fetttucine were stuck together and told our waitress. she said "" Oh I am sorry would like to order something else""  i told her no thanks but would like her to let the kitchen know how the pasta was no done right.  she look at me a said ok and she will like the manager know.  and that was that!!...."
Roseanne F.,"Temple City, CA",143,175,5,3.0,10/29/2008,"I don't like the fact that it takes foreeeeeeeeeever to get seated and the food is eh, but I do like the ambiance/atmosphere/whatever you want to call it.  There is just something about a dark restaurant with gaslights outside that's romantic."
Oscar M.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,17,,1.0,7/15/2007,"Can I give zero stars?!  Cheesecake factory is outrageously overrated!. Just get the cheesecake and get out fast! That's the only reason I'm willing to even give it 1 star.  My wife and I went out for what was supposed to be a quick dinner , then back to the house for a not too late movie. Unfortunately the service was sooooo slow that our plans were derailed. (yeah, I know, not exactly big plans)   The pulled pork sandwich was horrible! A hamburger bun filled with what I swear was just a chopped up pork chop. PULLED PORK PEOPLE! Pull the dang pork!  Mediocre BBQ sauce to boot. My wife had the fish and chips. The cardboard....I mean batter, was as bland and tasteless as.....oh, ...yeah, cardboard. Same with the fries,  if you can call them that.  The cheesecake is the only redeeming quality about this place.  I should have gone to confession 'cause the cheesecake was sinfully delicious.  I begrudgingly went back a second time for a friend's birthday party. I thought ""Maybe it'll will be different this time""  My verdict still stands,  someone please euthanize this place. Luckily their stock is down somewhat.  Maybe the  euphoria caused by the cheesecakes finally wore off."
Minh C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,35,2,4.0,5/6/2010,"Cheesecake is a chain restaurant but I believe the quality is higher than the average chain restaurant. There have been many people complaining about its prices but I think it's pretty reasonable. As long as you don't go for the steak or anything with red meat you are okay. A big bowl of pasta with chicken will set you back only $13. That's not too shabby! I came recently for a friends birthday party and we had 12 people and got seated within an hour during a busy Saturday. 30 minutes into your dinner, more friends showed up and they were very accommodating with arranging seats around to fit more guests. The servers were very polite and attentive. The only gripe I have about this place is the lighting can be too dim. I don't like to eat in darkness. Another tip would also be careful when you are walking to the restroom as the floors are always slippery and greasy around that area. I'm guessing since its near the kitchen also."
Michael T.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,65,,3.0,3/17/2008,"Gotta admit, the food is pretty crappy but they give you a HUGE portion of it. So I guess it evens out, if you go during lunch or something a lot of cute girls work there ;D just a little fact. But their menu is so huge it makes you confused about what to get, in the end you order something you don't know or something you've eaten several times at a different area."
