William W.,"San Diego, CA",10,57,4,3.0,1/1/2008,"I've only been to cheesecake factory 2 times before i went to the one at Santa Anita Mall. The service was decent. My gf ordered the chipotle pasta which was pretty tasteless and bland. Not much to be excited about. I thought i would give the Hawaiian pizza a shot. I wasnt expecting much, however i didnt think the pizza would be so grossly overcooked. After picking up my first slice of pizza, i noticed a credit card sized piece of burnt crust fall from under the pizza. The waiter came by and noticed it too. I honestly didnt care much, but the waiter insisted that he would tell the manager. He never followed up on it. Ended the meal with a nice slice of super chocolate cheesecake. Overall, the place is nice.. but the food is average, and the service varies."
Marshall L.,"Altadena, CA",0,25,,2.0,3/16/2008,"A large amount of mediocre food is served.  I have been there four times and each time they screwed up my order.  Once, it took them 40 minutes to rectify the mistake. The only good thing is when they mess up your order, they give you something for free.  Even so, I will not be going there again."
lilly s.,"Arcadia, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/9/2010,too expensive. food isn't that great. although i will admit that their customer service is pretty awesome!
Tcmae E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,68,301,4.0,5/2/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia is outside the food court @ the Westfield Santa Anita Mall. This is probaly the best Cheescake Factory you can go to in this area, because the one in Glendale in Americana at Brand, and the one in Pasadena in Old Town is way more crowded than the one here. The one in Pasadena is always crowded and it is really small and tight, and not specious. The one in Glendale Americana, is also crowded, and when it first opened, it took 3 hours to get a table, with slow service. This one gets crowded during the peak lunch and dinner times, but there is a quick wait for a table if you come here in the afternoon at around 2 to 5. I came here at 3 on a Sunday, and we only had to wait 2 minutes so they can set up our table. The service is really good in this place, and really good food, and the menu for the Cheesecake Factory is big and extensive. I ordered the four cheese pasta which was really good, and which was really a big portion for a lunch portion. For dessert, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake which was also really good. Next time I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I will order the Factory Burger which looks good, which I wished I ordered, but I could't because I ate alot of burgers that week. For my drink, I ordered a stawberry smoothie which was also good blended with pineapple juice, and other fruit juices, but I told them not to put the coconut in it."
Lexie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,4.0,11/14/2008,"this cheesecake factory wasn't bad, my friend and i got there around opening time (which meant no long waits to get seated). the waiter was attentive and the brunch menu wasn't bad. definitely going back again (at the same time)."
LC C.,"Arcadia, CA",0,11,,3.0,11/15/2009,"After some shopping in the Arcadia mall we stopped here for a quick dinner. Nice location and I heard it's really busy on Friday and Saturdays, but since we were here on a Sunday the wait for a table was not so bad. I didn't want a full dinner so I decided on a starter and a salad to go with the complimentary bread they doll out. I went for the ""Mini Corn Dogs""................bad idea!! The little pups were too soggy for me. The salad was satisfying, but the star of the night was the glass of Shiraz that I ordered. Yum! They say that the grape for this particular type of wine produces a powerful taste and boy it sure does have a kick! (So head on over to your local ""BevMo"" and pick up a bottle.....it's from the Rosemont Estate/Diamond Label.) My friend ordered a ""Ranch House Burger"" which he enjoyed and it looked filling. The seating we had at this restaurant, particularly the tables, were mighty close to each other! Your conversations will very easily mix in with table next to you, otherwise it's a nice place. As it's been said in a previous review at another joint....""Next time I want a booth!!"" Happy Eats All!!"
George G.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,457,35,2.0,7/4/2008,"Ya know, I dont see what all the hub-bub is about this place. It is AVERAGE food. Standard American Chain Mall Food. Mall food, Mall food. MALL FOOD. I went in the evening, and it was packed and our party of four was smashed into a corner, behind a pillar, and a giant palm tree, past the bar. Nothing seemed interesting, and I was bothered by the ads placed by mall stores in the Cheesecake menu. Can America just stop shopping for once???!!!?? I ordered the ""blackened"" chicken strips with the old school succotash. And, a Long Island ice tea (which took forever for them to bring...it's just a drink, people, you don't need to kill alcohol...) It was mediocre. The waiter came by when he ""felt"" like it. There were pools of water (from spilled drinks never mopped up) on the marble floors, and I almost ate shit.  And I dont get why people get all gooey over the bread. One shouldnt eat so much bread, you know."
Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,3.0,11/1/2008,"im usually a fan of cheesecake factory. i went here for the bfs bday dinner with his family on a sunday night around 8:30PM. we got seated right away since we decided to sit out on the patio. it was a nice night so it wasnt too bad, just super dark. the service was ok, nothing special. they ran out of the brown bread, which everyone at the table LOVES. we asked for more and they didnt have anymore =P i ordered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic since the bf had been raving about it. it was EHHH ok. it was very disappointing. the bfs roommate had also gotten it and he agreed, which was good because i thought it was just me who felt like the bf just hyped it all up. it was very bland and very watery. the only flavor was in the panchetta, which was really good. (of those tiny pieces that were in there) ehh i dont think i'd get that dish again =P"
Andy L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,58,,4.0,2/5/2009,I know a lot of people bash this place but I like it and I don't even like cheesecake either.  I enjoy their salads and they have surprisingly good fish tacos (un-battered type).  Their grilled artichoke appetizer is great as well.  The angel hair w/ prawn has some of the biggest shrimps ever.  It's not fine dining but it is satisfying.  I wish they would cut the portions a little and price accordingly but oh well...this is why america is one of the fattest countries in the world...
Jaydee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,75,416,1.0,8/7/2008,"ok so usually i loovoee cheesecake factory.... but why such a low rating??? well before my boyfriend and i even got our dish, we were eating the bread.. that had MOLD on it.. and we didnt realize until after we had already taken a few bites.... and because the lighting was so dim.. it made it even harder to see.. we brought i to their attention and all they did was offer us some more bread.. are u kidding me??!? and the guy apologized and said it was probably charcoal from the grill.. WTFFF??? first of all, you dont cook bread with charcoal, or on a grill... -.- and because they couldnt even do anything else better then that like.. at least a free cheesecake?? i mean.. u had us eating MOLD. we just decided to cancel the order and eat somewhere else.."
Jamie R.,"Monrovia, CA",1,38,6,1.0,9/4/2008,"Service sucks here.  Took them 15 mins to get us bread... Another 15 mins to get our orders... And then a crazy 40 mins to get our food.  And to make matters worse, the food was messed up.  Rudy (yes, we remembered his name, so u can watch out!) just can't comprehend!!!  We should've trusted our instincts when we had to repeat our order like 3 times before he said it right... Turns out, he still messed up.  The server said he'll send over a manager.  5 mins later and still no manager... We got up and walked out.   We were crazy not to have done that sooner!"
vicki k.,"Duarte, CA",0,25,,1.0,1/23/2008,Why does this place have such long lines!  I get a tummy ache after I eat here .... yuck!
Bridget V.,"West Covina, CA",43,175,,3.0,1/11/2008,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory.  My boyfriend and I had always decided that we would never go here since most of the food is not all that great and is either frozen or comes from a bag.  Since I got a nice $100 gift certificate to go there, we decided that free food is better than no food.  We picked this one because it is the closest to my house.  We also don't really go to many chains because we like trying new things, but free is free.  We went on a Thursday night, and the place was not all that busy.  We get seated and our waiter hands us this menu that looks like a notebook, complete with descriptions and ads for stores in the mall.  After many minutes of deciding, we just get our drinks.  I got water and my boyfriend got a raspberry lemonade, it was good but sticky because they sugar rim the glass.  Our waiter returns and I try and order an appetizer, the fire roasted artichoke, which he promptly tells me they are out of.  Grr, it sounded so good.  So going back to review my menu choices, I decide upon the Pear and Endive salad because it was a healthy choice, and my boyfriend got the Hibachi steak with garlic mashed potatoes.  I also ordered a Mojito, cuz I just love those drinks, and for once, we were not on a budget for dinner.  The Mojito was yummy, very minty and tasty.  Our food finally arrived, and my boyfriend noticed he was missing his tempura asparagus, which our waiter promptly returned.  I liked my salad, even though it was huge, and my boyfriend enjoyed his dinner, but couldn't finish it all, especially that huge mound of mashed potatoes.  So now for dessert time, or cheesecake time if you will, what this place is known for.  After reading the 10 plus odd cheesecake selection I decide to get a piece of the carrot cake cheesecake.  The waiter tells me that he is out and that maybe I should choose another one.  So, while I am thinking, he comes back and tells me he found another piece.  I was thankful.  I like the carrot cake cheesecake, but it was very very rich.  enough for 2 people to split, because one person should not have all that sugar.  So i would give this place 2 stars, but I added another for the waiter.  He got a good tip too.  Overall, the prices were reasonable, but the portions are too big, and the food isn't all that great."
S. C.,"San Gabriel, CA",31,80,2,3.0,3/16/2008,"my bf and i came here to eat because it was pretty much the only thing open at 11pm, and we had a movie to catch at 11:30.  i ordered a frozen iced mango (really good! it's non alcoholic) and my bf had coffee, which i thought tasted really watered down. our appetizers were avocado eggrolls (i don't like avocadoes at all. but i tried it. and it wasn't as bad as expected) and the BLT salad. the salad was not bad. my entree was garlic noodles with shrimp, and as much as i hate crustacean in bev hills (i will one day write my review for this place) i was hoping my food would taste like crustacean's garlic noodles. it didn't. it was kind of bland, as i expected pasta to taste at places like these. my bf ordered the kobe burger with bacon and cheddar cheese. it was really big. after you pile everything on, it was nearly impossible to take a bite so you kind of have to squish it down.  we asked for our bill as soon as our food came out, because you know how servers can take forever (especially the ones at kabuki - read my kabuki review)"
nar b.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,31,4,4.0,5/17/2010,"I've been going to the cheesecake factory for years now and I love it. I like how they added smaller portions to their menu. The food there is pretty good. I loveeee the avocado eggrolls. I'd have to say it's my fave!!! I also like the lettuce wraps too. Their pizzas are great. I always get the tomato, basil & cheese one. The burgers are goood! I normally don't finish it all though haha. The salads are big portioned so it's good to share it. Um, I don't think I have anything bad to say about this place, really.... besides the fact that the wait can be long but I think it is worth it. I was surprised that the last time I went, I was originally going to get sushi next door, however, theirrr wait time was wayyyy longer than the cheesecake factory's! o.O The only thing I do have to say isss... the prices are sometimes too high on certain dishes, I think. And as for the cheesecakes... never tired them! haha! Weird, right?"
