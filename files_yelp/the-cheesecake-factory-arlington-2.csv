Myzgell D.,"La Puente, CA",0,37,31,4.0,1/5/2018,"Our server Laura was really nice, she's always smiling and we didn't feel rushed at all. She was also attentive and always stopping by at our table to ask if we need anything else. Thank you!! The bread was really good and so as the food! Just one thing I didn't like is how they set up the utensils on the table, literally touching the table. I don't think it is sanitary."
Lindsey K.,"Arlington, TX",93,354,2098,5.0,11/25/2017,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory? Well, I do and I wish I could go once a week:)  The bread they put on the table, white and some kind of wheat one are delicious. Everything I've tried has been very good. And the Cheesecake most recently I've tried the Banana Cream one that was similar to Banana Pudding."
Just P.,"Arlington, TX",0,3,,5.0,11/5/2017,When we visited I had a great experience. There was this dish that had a certain kind of pasta I really wanted to try but it came with chicken (I'm vegetarian) So I asked to see if they could substitute the crusted chicken with crusted eggplant. And sure enough they did! The food was delicious it was the crusted eggplant with basil pasta and creamy garlic sauce. I will definitely order it again. The cheesecake is delicious here too. My favorites are the carrot cake cheesecake and red velvet. I always have a great experience here the food here never disappoints.
Yuby A.,"Fort Worth, TX",30,12,108,2.0,1/1/2018,"Came here for a bday lunch, second time trying Cheesecake Factory and I was still not impressed in the slightest. We were seated right away and the service was on point however, the food was mediocre at best. We started with the avocado egg rolls and those were probably the best part of the meal. I got a side Caesar salad which was flavorless.. and split a BBQ chicken pizza which was tasty but I've had better at CPK  I did enjoy the espresso cheesecake"
Elisa M.,"Dallas, TX",11,168,432,3.0,8/10/2017,"Went here for National Cheesecake day (1/2 price for a slice) and of course everyone else had the same idea so it was PACKED!!! However we were lucky enough to find a seat in the bar area.  Grabbed a couple of drinks & appetizers however what I came for was the cheesecake!  The waitress brought us the bread basket (I love bread!) however usually it has an assortment of bread whereas this only had one however I was there for cheesecake so I got over it quickly.  The waitress took our orders and suggested that we go ahead and place our Cheesecake order as it was taking about 30 minutes to get the order out. So we placed our order and began waiting.  The drinks came to the table quickly - I got the blood orange margarita which was strong but didn't taste like it had any blood orange in it & he got the old fashion, which he enjoyed.  Shortly after the appetizers came - chicken taquitos were good and the Nashville hot chicken nuggets were okay.  Moving on to what I came for . . . The cheesecake! There was a new cheesecake that just came out that day so I wanted to try it, the ultimate birthday cake. Sadly, it wasn't to my liking (should of stuck to the Oreo). The cake layer was dry, the presentation was sloppy and it was just a let down. My other half suggested I get the Oreo but I had to remind him of the 30 minutes to get a slice of cheesecake and at this point I was ready to go.  Next time I'll stick to what I know."
Wren T.,"Mansfield, TX",333,83,566,2.0,8/12/2017,"I normally love this place but this visit was quite a disappointment. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad. I asked for it to be served dry with no dressing. I simply wanted olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The waitress brought me the olive oil and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. So I had to repeat my request for the balsamic vinegar, which she did eventually bring. My salad was 90% kale, 10% arugula. According to the menu, it should not have had any kale in it. It had two or three very small pieces of shaved brussels sprouts, and no avocado at all. I did ask for some avocado and she brought me some on a plate.  My son ordered the meatloaf. It had a good flavor but was drowning in the overwhelming sauce. My husband asked for spinach instead of potatoes and he got spinach and potatoes instead of the other vegetable that was supposed to come with his steak.   I asked the waitress what was in the Skinny cocktail cosmopolitan. How was it different than the regular Cosmopolitan Martini? She said there was less ""flavor"" in it. I have never known there to be ""flavor"" in a martini.  So I asked her again? Do you mean the simple syrup? She said yes there is less of that in the regular one. Well, this is in contrast to the last time I asked the bartender here what the difference was and he told me that there was simple syrup in the regular one and Splenda in the skinny one. So I don't think she knew what she was talking about.  On a good note, the chocolate Godiva cheesecake was very very good. Smooth in texture. I would get this one again."
Daniela M.,"Frisco, TX",10,19,8,3.0,1/4/2018,Always great food but this location was particularly slow. I was visiting the mall as an artist for a big MAC Cosmetics event being held & I wouldn't recommend it if you're on a time crunch. I had fifty minutes to be in and out and I even asked for my ticket early but I was still there way longer than I had time to be.
Stephanie L.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,53,112,2.0,5/2/2017,"First off, the service was great. Couldn't have been happier with our server. It's my meal that's disappointing. I ordered the Shepard's Pie since it was a favorite for many YELP'ers. It's very odd. It seems to be chucks of hamburgers, like a cooked hamburger patty then cut up. It was VERY deconstructed. The chucks of hamburger meat on the bottom, veggies that were on the raw side pulled in the middle, All covered in a very thick brown Gelatinized goo called gravy, topped with a pile of mashed potatoes. Worst of all, the amount of grease oozing from the ""food""  After just a few bites I was ready to go.  Very disappointing dish :(  All other food ordered was delicious. Tex Mex Egg Rolls, Orange Chicken and cheesecakes were amazing."
Sameen A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",138,18,48,2.0,10/20/2017,"I hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in a while so I came in expectations and hunger. The verdict? Don't eat the dinner, do eat the cheesecake.  We ordered calamari for the appetizer and that was the best part of the dinner portion. Well cooked and plenty. We then ordered chicken teriyaki and pesto noodles. Both dishes were not eatable. We did not get to go boxes and I was pretty hungry.  Come to Cheesecake Factory for a slice of cheesecake. If this was the only item on the menu this would be a five star review. I ordered the pumpkin pecan cheesecake which was amazing. My friend got the Oreo cheesecake and it was also solid.  Service: Our server was very nice."
Yolanda B.,"Killeen, TX",0,3,6,5.0,11/21/2017,"My husband and I went to the Restaurant and there was a 40 minute wait, packed with people and it was cold outside. When we finally got seated we were greeted by the best waiter ever, his name was Bryson, he was very attentive,very friendly, we didn't have to wait he knew what we needed before we knew. Best dining experience ever."
Jeremy P.,"Midlothian, TX",3,65,19,2.0,12/16/2017,"Quite possibly the most overrated place on the planet. I guess this is a love it or hate it type place, and I definitely don't love it. Menu has entirely too many choices. So I decided on a burger. Just another overpriced burger. Not bad but far from memorable. Too many selections on the dessert menu too. Oreo cheesecake was way too rich for my liking."
Daniel C.,"Irving, TX",15,50,76,4.0,2/25/2017,"Went because girlfriend had a gift card and we wanted to save money so we decided to go here. We both weren't that hungry, so we got an appetizer to share, a salad and cheesecake for her, and a milkshake for me. Waitress was nice and friendly, they did not have crispy fried cheese so we instead had to get a more expensive appetizer. The friend mac n cheese bites ended up tasting just like the crispy fried cheese so that was surprisingly pleasing. The cheesecake, as my girlfriend has told me, was really good, and my milkshake was very enjoyable. Sadly, the cost for all of this was just as expensive as a normal meal would be and we didn't even get any actual food. It's a good place if you want dessert. Overall, I was pleased."
Bettie S.,"Mansfield, TX",21,17,,5.0,12/19/2017,"This was our first visit here. I have to say we were very pleased. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. I had a chicken Bellagio which was a breaded chicken breast on a bed of basil pasta  with prosciutto and a cream Sauce with a mound of arugula on top. It was absolutely delicious. Another dish we had was pasta with shrimp and sausage. They said it was good but not ""special"". The cheesecakes were yummy. One had a bacon cheeseburger. He said it was very good. We  wont hesitate to eat there again."
Nicole W.,"Dallas, TX",4,17,32,5.0,11/3/2017,"The wife and I visited the Cheesecake Factory was to only to get cheesecake to go. We purchased a 7 inch strawberry cheese cake and 2 slices of Red Velvet cheesecake to go. We were hungry and decided to dine in. We had and very friendly and knowledge waiter Ezikel. I know Cheesecake Factory is not know for the food, but this time they got it right. Wifey had steak tacos with beans and cilitrano rice. I had Pineapple & shrimp over brown rice. Both dished were delicious and reasonably price. Drinks to top it off ""Well Mannered Dirty Martini"" with blue cheese stuff olives, a very tasty combo mix and ""Classic Mojito""."
Karis H.,"North Richland Hills, TX",148,65,113,4.0,7/8/2017,"I was hesitant at first to go to this location since it is located at the mall, a very busy mall in fact. However, this Cheesecake Factory was very nice and the staff was very polite.     Since it IS Cheesecake Factory, it is protocol to get bread, appetizers, a nice big entreé, and some cheesecake. My friends and I got the fried Mac and Cheese (highly recommend), which are big masses of their delicious mac and cheese inside of a crispy shell of breadcrumbs on top of a creamy marinara sauce- oh my God, I need to stop!    Anyways, our server was a very sweet and attentive girl who never left our drinks empty, or the bread basket. Our food came out nice and hot and were able to take our time and catch up. I'm so glad we went here, because it was a nice and casual dining experience for any occasion!"
Kelly O.,"Irving, TX",16,133,214,4.0,9/29/2017,"Beware, their portion sizes for regular entrees are HUGE! I like how they offer a ""skinnylicious"" menu with healthier/low cal options and smaller portion sizes. This menu also specifies if the food is made with butter/cream. I ordered the shrimp summer rolls, off the skinnylicious menu. I am used to the real ones (spring rolls) from Vietnamese restaurants, so these were a little different. I should know better than to order an Asian specialty at an American restaurant! They sounded good and heathy so I got them. The order comes with two summer rolls ($7.95) that are cut in half. I know they cut them for presentation but this makes them harder to eat bc they fall apart. The rice paper was thicker than normal with a strange texture. They tasted pretty good, they were full of flavor and the inside ingredients tasted very fresh. The peanut dipping sauce looked a little strange (there was a white liquid at the top of the peanut sauce) but tasted decent. You also get a spicy dipping sauce, I didn't try this bc it looked oily. Their cheesecake menu is overwhelming! They have an extensive list of wonderful and unique cheesecakes. My favorite so far is the Godiva cheesecake. For dessert we ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake. It was delicious and almost too pretty to eat! It was very refreshing and decadent. The meringue on top was lightly toasted, it almost had a marshmallow fluff consistency/flavor. The cake was thick and rich  with a lemon moose layer in-between the meringue topping. I am usually a chocolate person but this definitely hit the spot!"
Dalma P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,2,2,1.0,7/27/2017,"This was my worst experience to date here at the Arlington establishment. I was in charge of getting my best friend's Cheesecake for her surprise birthday party. I ordered her two favorite flavors, mango key lime and Oreo extreme. I ordered the cake in advance so I could come in and pick it up and be on my way since I live in GP and she lives in Waco.     When I got there to pick it up it turns out they couldn't find my order. They spent about 15 minutes looking for my cake and then 20 minutes looking for my order slip. The restaurant isn't even that big so I'm not sure where she was looking??? When the employee finally found my order slip she said they must've forgotten to make my order since it wasn't in the front or the back.     Then she started grabbing slices from the cakes on display and was suddenly in a rush. Bare in mind, I'm the only customer at the Cheesecake section of the restaurant. No one is waiting behind me so why start rushing now??? As I'm waiting I see her tell a girl to go get a cake box from the back and she reluctantly goes. Clearly both annoyed at the situation. They spent about 35 minutes throwing my order together. When they were done, they rudely showed the cake to me and were overall just being unpleasant towards me. How is it my fault they didn't have my order ready and now I was making them do their job? It was ridiculous, I swear I wanted to leave but I had already paid and had promised my friends to bring the Cheesecake or else I would've asked for a refund immediately.     The cake looked SO BAD. It was clearly just thrown together in a bad way and it didn't even look like a cake, just a bunch of cheesecake slices in a box. Smushed and honestly poorly put together, I was mad at the service of the Cheesecake Factory. Why allow people to order a cake in advance and promise it will be there if it isn't? I don't recommend buying a full Cheesecake, I paid $57 for a very ugly cake. You're honestly better off just getting a cake from Albertsons or something, at least they have standards."
Liz L.,"Grand Prairie, TX",121,58,64,4.0,6/26/2017,"Food: The food was good! I had the loaded baked potato tots, which was filled with flavor. Then, I had the chicken, mango, and avocado salad. The grilled chicken was cooked well and the mangoes were fresh. They also had complimentary bread. Service: Our server was very kind and treated us well :)  Environment: Lots of decorations throughout the restaurant!"
Jim W.,"Seminole, TX",1,2,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Sad to report that the Cheesecake Factory has changed and not for the better. Before they had great service, and served large portions of very good food. Now they have a lot of help that isn't, that serve much smaller portions of very bad food. They also raised the price. Last month we went to the Cheesecake Factory in Allen with the same results. Both my wife & I couldn't eat the food and sent it back.  NEVER AGAIN!!!-OK very good"
Fred G.,"New York, NY",0,29,21,5.0,5/7/2017,1st time here and place is memorable. Daniel took care of us. I had the sweet corn tamales cakes. UNBELIEVABLE FLAVORS. Daniel surprised me with lemon cheesecake. All thumbs up.  Service 5 stars Food 5 stars Memorable to come back 5 stars
Crystal L.,"DeSoto, TX",151,113,423,2.0,6/28/2016,"It doesn't matter how many times I come, I continue to stay underwhelmed by the food here.   The plusses are that we get good service and the cheesecake is fantastic, but that's about it. For the  $100 we spent ( 1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrées, two dessert) I expect a bit more in taste and flavor. I got the fish tacos, and while it was a hearty portion, I was not at all impressed with the taste. I would eat Cheddars fish tacos any day!  Hubby was equally uninspired by his Cajun pasta and complained that he didn't even get one whole breast of  chicken. All in all a rather boring experience. We will definitely just come for the cheesecake from now on."
Anh P.,"Irving, TX",450,120,710,2.0,12/18/2016,"Yeahhhhh I wouldn't really waste my time or money here in the future. One visit was enough to deter me from stepping foot in here again. Although they did have some tasty appetizers (calamari, tuna tartare) and some pretty good cheesecakes (tiramisu and choc tuxedo cream), I don't think they hit the nail on the head with their main dishes. Maybe that's because I've tasted what their versions of ""Jambalaya Cajun pasta"" and ""Shrimp Scampi"" were before, and was knocked out in the past. So meh, is about right in my attitude of this establishment. I mean, the ""Cheesecake"" in Cheesecake Factory would hint what they'd specialize in, amirite?  Don't come here for the whole appetizer + main course + dessert trifecta, but after you've already eaten elsewhere and are craving some silky, not-too-sweet cheesecake with that billowing hill of whipped cream. My table's absolute wow-factor flavor had to be the tuxedo one. We nearly inhaled it. Yes, this will surely drag my butt back here in the future (or maybe just for take-out). Our server (dunno her name) was kind of rude, and took half the table's orders and then ran off? Tf? Came back after a good 10 min and then kept ushering us to order more and more and MORE! Like, stuffed that capitalism down our throats, she did. So be weary of this methodology. Use your personal freedom to say: NO THANKS, I will just stick to my choices, thank you. Don't let them make you feel pressured into stacking more plates on your order when you don't want to. Pricey dishes that taste SO MEDIOCRE don't deserve that. Plus, posh and truly upscale places won't have servers who are forceful. Like, she recommended pot-stickers. ""OMG, they're SO GOOD!"" But ya know what? They were terrible imo. Blandy bland bland. Maybe 'cause I'm Asian and know what they should taste like, lol. Anyway, rant over on this issue. Just be warned. Located to the left of Barnes & Noble (facing out in the parking lot), it's not hard to find. There's usually a ton of Parks Mall-goers, but then again, there's lots of parking accommodation for that crowd of people. No reservations here, either, booooo."
K M.,"Clyde, TX",19,151,168,4.0,6/16/2017,"It is expensive but worth it.   I had the Kobe burger, rare and it was cooked perfectly.   I would rather have this burger than a steak at most places.   My wife had Asian lettuce wraps and she said they were very tasty      The bread is always very tasty too Then 2 pieces of luscious cheesecake to take home for desert late last night and for lunch today. Left satiated happy  and full   To bad the closest one is 3 hours from our house"
Kato B.,"Arlington, TX",38,1,3,4.0,11/8/2017,"My first impression of cheese cake factory was ""WOW"". The the fine dinning atmosphere, with the casual experience you really can have the best of both worlds, Music playing in the background so it drowns out extra conversations from other guests in the restaurant, so you can have a more intimate conversations. We stayed here for about 1hour 20 mins. Nice clean bathrooms away from dinning areas, and a cheese bakery with free smells right in the front as you walk in.  My fiance and I went in on a Tuesday afternoon It would have to have been around 3pm (not very busy witch is what I like.) We walk in and the hostess was at her podium, whom warmly welcomed  seated us quickly , once we had been seated our waitress took our drink order. When our waitress came back I went ahead an ordered us a Buffalo wing App(8/10) and our meals the cajan pasta jamba(excellent) and I ordered the chicken bellicose(excellent) . I have have to say I would've given it a 5/5 but the waitress was MIA most of the time checked on us maybe once or twice and was not very observant of drink refills. (Price for two was about 25 each) all in all I'd visit again."
Tracie R.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,11,4.0,8/13/2017,"Service was above average. Asian Lettuce Wraps and Summer Rolls were a great start. We ordered a flatbread, lemon garlic shrimp and pasta, and the chicken potstickers. Presentation, temp, flavor were great. Bussers should wipe food off tables and seats into bins, not onto the floor."
Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1281,673,344,2.0,10/19/2016,"My wife and I hadn't dined at The Cheesecake Factory in quite a while so we decided it was time to head over there for dinner. We were surprised to be seated right away, it was nice not to have to wait. Our server greeted us very politely and took our drink orders. We normally order the same thing each time we've visited but decided to order something different this time around. My wife ordered a regular hamburger and I ordered the fired catfish, accompanied with mashed potatoes, sautéed spinach and green beans. While waiting for our entries to arrive we munched out on the incredible bread. It works out perfectly since I love he bring bread and my wife loves the sour dough (which I think it is). After a short wait our entrees arrived. My wife said it was one of the best burgers and fries she had eaten in a long time. I am a huge catfish fan so I was looking forward to my succulent catfish platter. I was disappointed since I am normally used to somewhat thinner catfish filets and a lighter ""fry"". The filets that they served were very thick and fried luch darker than I prefer. Also towards the end of one of the filets it was undercooked. I should have mentioned the problem to my server but the meal had progressed too far to complain. My ""veggie"" sides were very delicious snd seasoned perfectly. Of course the highlight of the meal was the Dulce de Liche cheesecake. That's where The Cheesecake Factory shines."
Belinda L.,"Dallas, TX",247,298,129,4.0,9/10/2016,"Any Cheesecake Factory location is an absolute treat. I've been to several locations and what I admire most about this business is the continuity. The locations have about the same lay out, decor is pretty and whimsical and the food is consistently great. Cheesecake Factory is usually packed on the weekends. We usually head out there around closing time to avoid the wait. We are seated promptly.  The restaurant is well maintained and always clean. I've never been to a location that was understaffed and tables dirty.  They have an extensive menu. It's probably too large but you have an array of options which can make deciding difficult because the food descriptions are so good.  I usually have a strawberry lemonade which is freshly squeezed and a mojito. They use fresh ingredients.  Love the fresh soft bread they serve. They provide an assortment but I ask for the whole wheat bread. I love how it's warm enough to melt butter. The food is always good. I've had several dishes and each have tasted great. The dishes are on the large side so if you have a small appetite then you'll need a to go box or share with someone. I'm ready to head out to Cheesecake Factory now!"
Karlyn K.,"Georgetown, TX",36,226,85,4.0,5/25/2017,Had a late lunch for work. They were quick to seat us and prompt in bringing drinks and bread. We had apps and lunch with cheesecake. Everything was good. My only reason for giving one star down is I'd have liked them to check on us a bit more. I wanted more tea especially at the drink price. I'd have liked our table cleared off a bit when they brought entrees. All in all it was good just expect a bit more from service.
Sarita G.,"Dallas, TX",66,87,260,5.0,9/5/2016,Always super good.  Although I'm not too big on sweets the cheesecake is pretty good but i come for the food.  Ceaser salad and Flatbread pizza.
Lana Y.,"Grand Prairie, TX",352,338,329,4.0,7/26/2016,"Cheesecake Fan!!! This place is always busy and it was no different Saturday night at 10:30 pm.  We had 10 people in our party so since we were just going for dessert we decided to take our to go.   I was torn between the Godiva Chocolate and the Salted Caramel Cheesecake, but finally decided that the Godiva was going to be too much chocolate.  The salted caramel cheesecake was so delicious.  I havent ever had the like triple layered chocolate cake but apparently it is the BOMB, and the last piece was sold right before one of our party was ordering their piece....so make sure if you are wanting that to order it first.  HAHAHA  like before dinner/lunch. More importantly the bathrooms were clean and had plenty of soap and paper towels."
Toni S.,"Red Oak, TX",27,22,56,5.0,5/4/2017,I always come here for dessert with a few friends after having dinner at Jin Korean BBQ. Always quick and great service. The cheesecake is always to die for! Red Velvet is my go-to order. Can't do wrong with it. The peanut butter chocolate is also a favorite of mine.
MaryAnne C.,"Killeen, TX",64,25,45,4.0,5/1/2017,"We came here Saturday night to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was crowded and busy but we didn't wait long. Our server was Zeek and he was very nice and helpful. Our food was really good as well and came in a timely manner. The only thing I had an issue with was the oder coming from the booth (seats), it smelt like stinky feet. Other than that we had a pleasant dining experience."
Tiffany T.,"Fort Worth, TX",196,131,611,5.0,1/10/2016,"Excellent!!  It has been a long time since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. I was a little nervous to eat the food after reading some of the reviews. However, this was such a great experience from start to finish!   I started out with the Strawberry  Creamsicle (spiked milk shake) and the Portabella, Avocado, and Zuchinni fries. Man, where to begin...everything about it was so good. The avocado was my absolute favorite..especially with the amazing garlic aioli dipping sauce! The Strawberry Creamsicle was perfect..like a sweet strawberry shake with a strong hint of liquor.  For my meal I had the avocado egg rolls with the Tamarind -Cashew dipping sauce (Oh My Good!!) the egg rolls were missing well everything listed but the avocado (cilantro, onion, tomato)...still good enough not to be disappointed in them!   Last but not least...the cheesecake!  Mango Key Lime Pie Cheesecake...it might be winter time, but it reminds me of summer!  Sweet and tangy with a coconut macaroon crust. So so good!!  I will 10000% be coming back to try the many many options on the menu!!"
Brenda E.,"Irving, TX",3,2,,1.0,7/19/2017,I haven't been here in years!!! I was very excited ordered a whiskey smash and it was amazing! We had a party of 15 so there was a slight delay of an hour and half for our food. No problem! However when we order a gluten free meal and the cooks messed up and can't serve it to the 6yr old and had a salad while her cousin had spaghetti! Not good! My angel hair pasta was cold and tasted like spaghetti sauce! I asked a staff member for cheese and never got it. We also ordered a burger medium and it was extra well done! Dessert makes everything better... expect the banana cheese cake was still frozen! So disappointed so very sad!
Dez C.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,5.0,5/15/2017,"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory, but as of May 13th I love it even more! I graduated from college & decided to have my celebratory Lunch after the ceremony here at the location in Arlington, Tx. I had previously RSVP'd for about 25 people but about 35 showed up instead. The manager Sandy was totally booked with families coming in to dine that Saturday afternoon, yet she still was able to accommodate my extra guest to sit directly across from my reserved area so that they could feel included. Customer Service at its finest!!! The staff was nice and everyone told me Congratulations! I love this Cheesecake Factory 10x more now! Thank You!!!  Also, i got the Spicy Chipotle Pasta with added grilled Shrimp! That and Steak Dianne are literally my go to's every time! Try the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake or the Hershey's Cheesecake as well! You won't regret it!"
Rebecca C.,"Arlington, TX",9,40,13,5.0,9/10/2017,"Amazing (messy) artichokes!!! I don't know their recipe but it's amazing! Chicken salad and Cuban sandwiches are great too. Also the grilled steak medalists, the sauce is RICH!"
Tung N.,"Arlington, TX",416,133,139,2.0,10/13/2015,"My friend put it perfectly: ""This is called the Cheesecake Factory, not the Burger Factory."" It could not have been more spot on because everything besides the cheesecake was dry, tasteless, and overall hard to eat.  We came here for my friend's birthday Monday night, and although it wasn't busy, the service was very slow. When we finally got our bread, it was moist and just the perfect amount of crunch without being hard. But everything went downhill from there. Our orders were taken, and we waited for nearly 30 minutes. We asked her for more bread, and she seemed annoyed. When she brought out the second batch, it was stale and nearly impossible to chew.  I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese Burger since my friend raved about it, which I still don't understand why. They claim it to be one of their ""Glamburgers"" but it's far from glam. I ordered it medium, it came out burnt. By this time, I just didn't even want to complain anymore. The patty was dry (shocker), macaroni was flavorless, and the bun added nothing to the burger except extra carbs.  Of course we had to order cheesecake, so we got their Ultimate Red Velvet. Delicious! Only reason why I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1. But besides that, there was no saving grace to a somewhat mediocre dinner."
Dominic C.,"Flower Mound, TX",283,850,169,4.0,6/5/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is on the higher end of chain restaurants. I'd take them over Chili's any day. It's good for large groups. Lots of variety so the menu will satisfy most people. Personally, I like the Miso Salmon and the Lemoncello cheesecake. But it's not the place I'd come to on my own. I like smaller restaurants. Will RTE with a big group."
Alicia G.,"Arlington, TX",0,19,,1.0,6/14/2017,Not good for take out.   Had to hold for the bakery for 12 minutes to place an order. Was told food would be ready in 25 minutes and I arrived in 23 minutes but had to wait for service at pick up.  My Order wasn't ready so I waited 5 minutes and the associate went to the kitchen and came back with the $11 sandwich which he added to the bag where my $20 salmon entree had bees sitting on top of a cooler case in the bakery for more than 10 minutes.  I asked for a refund for the salmon and the associate asked if I would like a fresh entree - will take about 15 minutes if you want to wait. I've already waited almost an hour from when I first called so I said I would prefer the refund. Then had to wait for the manager to come to refund the entree.  I asked him why they would send a $20 entree out of the kitchen when the rest of the order wasn't ready. They don't send food to tables that way. Another woman who picked up take out related that she had a similar experience. She had been waiting for her food for 10 minutes beyond the time it was supposed to be ready and her order had been sitting on top of the cooler case the whole time she was waiting.  Two women appeared to be waiting to be seated but I learned that they walked in and ordered (and paid for) two slices of cheesecake. They had been waiting 45 minutes.  This is such a good example of the type of poor service given to take out customers. I've picked up cold food from there several times which is why I pushed it back to them this time. Haven't been there in almost two years and now it's likely to be at least two more years before I will return.

But overall favorable. Obviously they have everything on the menu, and the cheesecake factory chain as a whole is always a decent option."
