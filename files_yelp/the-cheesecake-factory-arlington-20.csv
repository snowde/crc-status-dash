Michelle D.,"Canton, TX",42,15,5,5.0,5/27/2011,It the cheesecakeFactory need I say more. I had stuffed mushrooms n they were the best ever then I took hm a price of low carb cheesecake made with splenda iwas so excited. It is a lil expensive but well worth every penny.
Kayla D.,"Arlington, TX",30,19,9,3.0,2/18/2011,"Of course, you should go for the cheesecake and the coffees. The food is okay. Of all the things i've eaten here only 2 things stand out: their fried ahi 'sushi' appetizer and their fish tacos. most other food is much too expensive for the taste. It's a great lunch and hangout place with friends. The service is great!"
Crystal P.,"Corinth, TX",25,70,,4.0,2/25/2012,"Not for the faint of heart. Their menu is overwhelming to an extreme! This place is also very 'spensive! I like going for the lunch deals and get the half portions! Makes it easier on the wallet while enjoying FANTASTIC grub. First, I have visited numerous Factory locations and this is my first review. This review is for the restaurant as a whole vs. location only. Their food (because it's a chain) tastes the same to me no matter where you are Vegas, California, Texas, Wherever...I LOVE their pasta. Perfect place to visit after running a marathon.  CarbTASTIC! You will blow your ""diet"" but it is always oh so worth it. I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory NOT busy. So if you plan on trying this place out, expect a crowd. When I am in the mood for a splurge, this is the place I most commonly think of, but don't make this place a weekly dining spot in my opinion unless you have a wheelchair or a friendly giant to carry you on their back after you're finished!"
Anna P.,"Crowley, TX",0,14,,3.0,7/2/2013,I like having Brunch here.  The orange juice is actually freshly squeezed?  Tastes that way!  The brioche bread never disappointing.   Get it plain and toasted.  The service was okay but the hostess was just rude!  Told the manager but she didn't seem to get it..
Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",1,128,67,4.0,6/3/2012,"Pretty good food, such a huge menu it's hard to pick what to eat! Be ware that the serving sizes are enough for two people... At least!!!! I personally always order from the small plates menu:)! && if you like tea, get the passion tea!!! YUM!"
Diana B.,"Fort Worth, TX",14,10,5,4.0,3/10/2014,"Absolutely love this place! We come here often. Decided to treat my sister for her birthday last week. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which is great, I order it every time.  This time there was a slight issue with it..i found a strand of hair in my food. I didn't make it a big deal because I thought it was mine so I just tried to pick it up and realized it was stuck in the breading of my chicken. I then knew it could have not have been mine since I just got my plate. Didn't want to make a big scene so I flagged the next server I saw and told him about it he quickly apologized and had them make me a new one. My server came over and apologized and so did the manager on duty and made sure I was tooken care of. Manager offered me a slice of cheesecake on him which was really kind of him. What I did have a problem with was that when my server brought my new plate over she made a joke about how she checked to make sure there was no hair in my food and that her hair was blonde so the hair in my first plate couldn't have been hers. I just kind of felt like she was trying to say it was mine or just kind of being sarcastic about it. She also messed up on our check at the end. She didn't even show us the itemize receipt she just charged our card. Then after she already swiped it I realized she charged me twice for my entrée and she also charged me for the cheesecake that was suppose to be comped. Overall, this place is great. Food is always on point. Service is a hit or miss. I've had really good service here and I've have bad service."
Catherine P.,"Mansfield, TX",0,21,5,5.0,1/29/2012,"What a delightful experience! I just have to say that after expressing my disappointment concerning a recent visit to my ""home"" Cheesecake Factory in a review here...to my great surprise, the General Manager actually contacted me via YELP and asked me to give his staff another chance. I did. My visit today was wonderful! Exactly what I had grown to expect from this team of professionals! The food was excellent, the service was superb..thank you Jackie, the atmosphere was 5 star and I have removed my previous review. Any establishment can fall short of their goal on any given day, as we must all confess. However, just how many times does the management AND staff take the initiative to correct the situation and stay true to their goal of making sure you, as a customer, are satisfied..let alone impresssed? Let's just say, you will not be dissapointed when you take the time to visit Raymond Day's Cheesecake Factory! If you get a chance, ask for Jackie or Austin...both of these gentlemen take special care to make your dining experience one to remember! My family is already planning our next trip back!!"
Terry D.,"Cleburne, TX",0,63,,1.0,2/17/2009,"Everything a restaurant shouldn't be.  The decor is over-the-top bulky trendy and the waitstaff is intrusively friendly (as opposed to service-oriented), perhaps to distract from the horrendously bad food.  Horrendously.  Bad.  Everything, it seems, somehow incorporates Cheez Whiz, pimentos, and simply gobs of salted butter.  The menu is an extensive tome of diverse incarnations of yuck prepared in servings of three or four.  Sadly, even the cheesecake is not the best, tasting like flavored sugar paste."
alex c.,"Mountain View, CA",1,2,1,1.0,12/13/2010,"Well well well food 1.5 stars pastas r dry and overcook meat , service 1.5 he didnt have idea what he was selling ,love they strawberry lemonade and dessert was fine I little to sweet oreo chessecake I probably won't come back only reason its because my gf like the place, to be honest I don't even know why"
Natalie C.,"Arlington, TX",0,9,,4.0,1/22/2012,"I was very pleasantly surprised! Never having been to a CF, I was curious and we decided to try it on for size. YUM! The appetizer of Buffalo Blasts were a new spin on an old favorite, and even though they were fried, weren't very greasy, which I was thankful for. I had the Pear & Endive salad, but substituted goat cheese for the blue cheese that it come with, and it was phenomenal! Everything was fresh and crisp, the chicken moist and flavorful, the cheese creamy and light. Hubbs had the Blue Cheese BLT Burger, I stole a bite of it before he inhaled the whole thing, amazing! Meat was quality and cooked to specifications, and sadly we were too full to eat dessert there, so we brought it home. I haven't tried it yet, but the Key Lime Pie cheesecake looks fantastic and I plan on being balls deep into it as soon as I have room in my tummy! Also, had the iced green tea while I was there, it was lovely!"
Fred F.,"Arlington, TX",0,29,1,2.0,1/24/2010,1st time ever in CCF.ate lunch $25 for mahi mahi lunch and ice tea.give me a break.way over priced!food worth $12 at the most.never will eat here again
Chuck S.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2011,"We ate there on 1/18/11.  Our waiter was very good and most of the meals were fairly good.  My wife ordered something off there special menu, a chicken dish.  The sauce that came with it was watery and no that good.  I wish she had said something and we could have sent it back.  The restaurant was cold, almost uncomfortable.  We mentioned it to our waiter, but I'm not sure the manager did anything.  I wish they offered the lunch portion salads at dinner.  WE eat out alot, but it will probably be some time before we go back."
