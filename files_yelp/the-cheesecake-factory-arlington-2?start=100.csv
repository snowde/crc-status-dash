Xav Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,92,2,3.0,2/29/2016,"I LOVE the cheesecake here, but that's about it.  I got a chicken n pasta meal cant recall the exact name.  There was a pool of oil on the bottom of my plate.  I could not bring myself to finish my food once I saw it.  I am not a health nut, but I would rather not drink a gallon of oil with my food."
Marie T.,"Arlington, TX",1,18,3,5.0,2/25/2016,"Huge selection. Great place for groups because they can accommodate the size and everyone's different tastes. Always great service. Love their lemonades and teas. My favorite dishes are the shrimp bistro and miso salmon. My husband loves the burgers, so many good choices and all fully loaded. Good large portions and yummy fresh bread. Then there's their cheesecakes, if you come here you should definitely get one.  You might be too full to eat it,  but take it home they pack it up nicely.  They are large enough slices to share. I have always had a great experience, I have been coming here for years now."
Ryan D.,"Euless, TX",83,3,,1.0,12/6/2015,"My experience at this location was the worst ever! I will probably never go back to this particular location. My wife and I came for a birthday dinner and the waitress was horrible. From the start, you could tell that she was very rushed. She literally ran to the table and without saying hello, stated what do you want to drink? I first thought to myself, she is rushed it's okay due to it being packed. However, when we asked for another loaf of bread we were told we have to finish the bread on our table before she will bring another one. I have never heard of such, especially when you are paying for the meal. The whole experience was rushed and a disappointment, we frequently visit the Frisco, Texas location and it is superb compared to this one. I don't recommend this location, it is overly crowded, waitstaff rushed and rude, and you will be told how to order and spend your money."
Leslie S.,"Fort Worth, TX",35,37,53,3.0,1/4/2016,"It was pretty good and very short wait on a Saturday, but the Southlake location is much better. This was the first time my portion was kinda on the skimpy side and the flavoring was meh. Overall it is the Cheesecake Factory and the Macadamia Cheesecake was really really good!"
Linn P.,"Fort Worth, TX",255,396,547,4.0,9/2/2014,Crusted chicken Romano with the Romano sauce. I always get the pasta carbonara too.  Bailey was our waitress and she was awesome.  Never had an empty drink.  Brought us whatever we asked for immediately.  Always coming around to check on us.  Usually my husband and I do not like the food at Cheesecake Factory and only get the dessert sometimes. But finally we found a couple of dishes we love and cheesecake to crave.
A P.,"Arlington, TX",48,64,50,4.0,3/16/2016,"I get cheesecake here for every special occasion. I've ate at the other locations before but not the Arlington one yet. But for the most part, everything is usually pretty tasty!"
Ashli B.,"Washington, DC",120,122,200,4.0,10/3/2013,"I wasn't really a fan of this place before because I always felt it was overpriced for the quality of food. I've recently discovered their lighter calorie menu and small plates... Good portions and reasonably priced. Even the appetizers are filling enough to be entrees. With the portion size, cost and quality of the food I order now... I can see the appeal. Oh and there is the cheesecake of course!"
Mandy C.,"Arlington, TX",2,73,61,5.0,9/16/2014,Always 5 star... Recently had these fabulous drinks at brunch... Wanted to share a photo.. Strawberry Creamsicle  & Tropical Martini
Jay K.,"Hurst, TX",401,56,27,1.0,9/4/2015,"The fried meatballs were delicious. This is a great appetizer. The beer was fresh and cold as it should be. My friends entree looked fine. My entree arrived, it looked delicious but their was huge grasshopper in there. I am mortified that the manager did not come to my table to acknowledge this error on their part until we asked for the check. I am very upset because he was very un-professional and tried to crack a joke, stating how beautiful the day was and that is why there was a grasshopper in my food. He stated the doors had and windows had been open and it crept in. It was never a laughing matter. At that point I mentioned to him we taken photos of the grasshopper and he still did not seek to fix the issue. I will never return to The Cheesecake Factory."
Missy H.,"Wichita Falls, TX",1,14,10,5.0,3/20/2015,"So good! I really had no idea what to expect. We visited while in town from Wichita Falls. I had the Cuban sandwich and OHMYGOODNESS,  it was fantastic! Hubby and son had French dips which were equally delish! And although we were stuffed, we had to try the cheesecake. We shared a piece of original with fresh strawberries and it was so great! Son had key lime with mango glaze and I thought he would cry in his plate!! So great!! Great service too!"
Katie W.,"Arlington, TX",6,27,95,4.0,7/12/2014,"Holy mother of Mary, is that a Cheesecske in your lap or are you just happy to see me?!? We walked in to The Cheesefactory for well, cheesecake. OMG, there was a plethora of people! Have no fear, there is a lil Cheesecake ""bar"" to the right where you can oogle all of the cheesecake yumminess. We settled on Chris' outrageous cheesecake because it looked well, outrageous! The guy dished up 1 in a to go container we paid our $8 where we promptly devoured it in the car. It was incredibly outrageous, but for heavens sake if you can eat one by yourself you have GOT to be one of those competitive eaters! Pick a piece & share, or be prepared to not button your pants!"
Chelsea W.,"Grand Prairie, TX",40,3,,1.0,7/8/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here like once a week... We will now never come here again. Worst experience ever!!! Not only did our waitress have a horrible attitude but We ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes as we always do and it came out wayyyyyy under cooked... We took a couple of bites and just sent it back. They still tried to charge us for it. The waitress told a lie to the manager and said we ate almost all of it! Are you freakin kidding me? After talking to the manager TWICE, she finally took it off the ticket! Cheesecake Factory, you lost some great customers!"
Robert M.,"Burleson, TX",0,22,,2.0,3/19/2016,"I ordered Fish n' Chips and received ruggedized fish, french fries, and slaw.  I knew I was in trouble when I bit into the fish (surrounded by enough batter to protect the fish from destruction if thrown from a helicopter) and found the content flavorless.  I guess I should have tried the cheesecake and skipped the meal."
Dave M.,"Mansfield, TX",40,31,11,5.0,4/5/2014,Excellent menu and service. Very friendly staff. We come here every Saturday and have not had a bad meal yet - nor the se thing.  They do a great job at greeting you and along sure your food meets your expectations . A good place that is casual
Daphane W.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/17/2016,"I ate here on February 15, 2016 around 8pm. I ordered the Alfredo with spinach and mushrooms. They brought me a dirt plate that had spaghetti sauce dried to the plate. The waiter said I'm sorry took my plate back and they dumped it into a clean plate and still charged me full price for both of my meals. If I could give guys no star I would."
Jason L.,"San Antonio, TX",18,88,35,4.0,6/28/2014,Cheesecake Factory Always a nice environment. This one is a little bit more open then other Cheesecake Factories I've been to with less booths. The menu is still the same everywhere you go.
Tina M.,"Mansfield, TX",27,31,4,5.0,7/8/2015,"My carrot cake was enough for a family and hubs German chocolate cheesecake was soooo good, but very rich. I ordered a hot chocolate and asked the waitress if she liked it. She said it was a little bitter to her, so she said she could add some vanilla for sweetness and extra whip cream. It was perfect and almost the size of an ice tea glass. Carrot cake will have to be taken home."
Jenny C.,"Dallas, TX",13,15,3,5.0,3/12/2014,"I came here once and it was my first time here, my husband and I came on a date and whoa was this place awesome. The food was great, service was great, and the cheesecake was amazing!  The environment is great and just a nice place for a date. We enjoyed our time there and went home satisfied. Our favorite is the stuffed mushroom appetizer can you say OMG! It was so delicious I had to eat it real slow just to savor the flavor. For anyone who likes stuffed mushrooms you should defiantly try it, you won't be disappointed.  Overall the place is great, it does get really busy so make reservations if you can. It was a great first experience, the waiter was very polite and tending. Didn't feel like I was forgotten. If this will be your first time visiting you should defiantly go! All the cheesecake"
Grace N.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,1,1.0,7/21/2015,"Been here twice. The food is good. However, the service is so ridiculously slow that my experience the first time and tonight are far below the most minimal expectation. Will not be back to this location."
Ciara J.,"Valdosta, GA",20,86,81,4.0,5/2/2014,"My friends and I decided to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. It was quite busy (we went around dinner time, so it was to be expected), but our wait wasn't that long. We decided to start off with the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip as our appetizer. The dip came out hot and fresh. It was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the crab, which was a plus. For my main dish I ordered the Fettucini w/ Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. To be honest, this is one of my least favorite dishes that I have tried from The Cheesecake Factory. Although my food did come out hot and seemed to be fresh, it was lacking flavor. I started to order the Garlic Pasta, which is a favorite of mine, but I decided to try something different. Needless to say, I won't be order this pasta dish again. For dessert, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. Let me tell you, this is heaven on a plate. The cheesecake was so light and fluffy and creamy and just overall wonderful. It wasn't too banana-y and the whipped cream was a great touch, although it really isn't needed at the end of the day. That cheesecake was the bomb. I'm giving this review a 4 out of 5 - well technically a 4.5 out of 5. The service and the food were great, but the pasta was not on point."
