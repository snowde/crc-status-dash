Katherine M.,"Junction City, KS",0,5,3,5.0,9/8/2015,The staff was amazing and the food was great! My husband and I tried the fried mac and cheese appetizer and it was fantastic. We then tried the mac and cheese burger which was equally as good. Our waitress was amazing and very attentive to our needs. We will definitely be going back!!
David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,538,4.0,3/23/2014,The buffalo bites rock the nachos are okay.  As for the service there's a server there named José helped everybody in the restaurant including tables not his own great guy. The bar Kendelynn in great server mixed drinks really effectively positive attitude.
C J.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,4.0,8/22/2015,Nice place to eat.  Convenient location.  Food is always good and always packed  Bar is always fast on the drinks
Paige D.,"Fort Worth, TX",49,142,16,3.0,3/13/2014,"I love the decor and ambiance of this place.  The light is lightly dimmed and there's tons of seating. This is great for date night and the food is always good. We decided to sit outside, not a good idea. Because we were the only group outside it took forever to get any service. Felt like our waiter forgot he had a table outside. Took 20 min to get any kind of refill and that long to get the check after asking for it... They give out complimentary bread, different variety. Our favorite is the wheat bread so that's the only kind we ask for. I had the Cajun chicken pasta, my favorite! It's a little spicy and has great flavoring. The pasta was sprinkled with a kind of tortilla chips..definitely makes the dish! My friends had the shrimp pasta and a pepper burger. They all raved about their food. For dessert we shared the snickers cheesecake and caramel cheesecake. Both super delicious and for $8 a piece, sharing is caring. :) Overall, food is always great but service was a little lacking that particular day."
Eddie W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,11,4,2.0,12/19/2014,I didnt like the waitress she brought us drinks and didnt come back for 40 minutes. She then came back took our orders and never saw her again. We had to get some guy to check on our food and bring it.
Tina P.,"Dallas, TX",86,381,9,3.0,7/19/2011,"After some shopping, I decided I needed a dessert break and headed on to the Cheesecake Factory! I've been to this location before for their food and the food is average with very large portions for what I thought were decent prices. A burger here will run you about $9 and the salads were about $12. But I came here for cheesecake!!! Always a treat, I tried the red velvet cake and cheescake combo. Very good! I also tried the strawberry shortcake and that was amazing as well. Again, portions here are large and 2 boys and I could not finish the 2 desserts despite not even eating dinner beforehand. TIP: If you're inside the mall, you need to walk through Barnes and Noble to get to the restaurant!"
Max R.,"Arlington, TX",0,18,,1.0,6/23/2015,They do not do reservations.  I was told the wait was 10-15 minutes so I left and went up to Cheesecake Factory.  When I got there the line was out the door and it was at least 30 minute wait.  Not accommodating to parties with babies.  Went to Macaroni Grill instead.
Krystalynn B.,"Arlington Heights, Fort Worth, TX",0,10,7,5.0,6/22/2014,"We have been frequenting The Cheesecake Factory for years. The Luau Salad had always been a favorite of mine. Today we tried out the Sunday brunch menu for the first time and it was outstanding! The crab hash was amazing and definitely a dish I will be getting again. I would suggest requesting an English Muffin with it to soak up all of the remaining sauce at the end. The Chilaquiles were also very good . I was not a huge fan of the fried tortillas that came with them though, because they were too dense. My kids had the Elvis style Belgian Waffles and those too were very yummy! A crisp, Belgian waffle topped with a peanut butter sauce, pecans, and sliced bananas. If you have never had brunch here, I definitely recommend trying it out."
David S.,"Arlington, TX",82,25,7,3.0,2/26/2015,"Want a menu that takes an eternity to get through? This is your place!  They do a good job on their food, but too much on the menu to get great at any of them."
MJ R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,21,2,2.0,2/24/2016,"Came here last night for my Stepson's birthday. Appetizers weren't bad. The service was decent. The entrees however, leave something to be desired. I ordered chicken picatta, was a huge disappointment. Chicken was bland, sauce was very hard to choke down. Was a huge pile of dry, flavorless angel hair in the middle of the plate. My dear wife was sweet enough to swap entrees with me. I finished off her fettuccini Alfredo, but not before several shakes from the salt shaker. Not the worst, I have ever had, but miles from being something I would ever order here again. My stepson ordered orange chicken with brown rice, came out with white rice. They promptly changed it out for the brown rice He had ordered. Only problem with that was it wasn't cooked enough and was too hard to consume. After the disappointment of the entrees, comes dessert. Ordered two different flavors of cheesecake, brought one of the two out, incorrectly. We sent it back for the correct one we had ordered, which came out frozen and hard as a rock. I won't be back, the food they serve can't justify their prices. I don't mind paying for good food, this place is just average at best."
Syed A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,6,,5.0,5/17/2015,"Awesome Place. My sister hosted her graduation party here last night. We had about 30 people sit out in the patio. The service, arrangement, and food was great. I will definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone."
Glen Q.,"DeSoto, TX",2,56,,3.0,1/19/2016,"Why are the floors so damn slippery? Its like Disney on Ice here. They should provide non-slip shoes for all customers. Was the restaurant designed to slant slightly from the kitchen to the dining area so that all the grease and water could slowly drain out the front door? How are there not like a gagillion lawsuits for this place right now?  The wait was about 20min not to bad, we sat at the bar and got a drink while we waited, drinks were ok for $10 a pop, the food was ok, the place just seemed dingy thou, like have they not cleaned the windows since the place fist opened? And those damn floors, i mean seriously, like really? Maybe its the servers tracking grease from the kitchen out into the fining room or maybe they're using the same mop for the entire restaurant but c'mon man, thats unacceptable. There were like 4 managers I saw walking around, yall mean to tell me y'all are just gonna let this greasy ass floor stay this way? I thought Cheesecake Factory was supposed to be a 'fancy restaurant'...from what I saw its more like a glorified Cheddars"
Jacob K.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,11,89,4.0,1/2/2012,"I've been to this place a few times, and for the most part it's pleasing. The waiters are always expressing their interest in catering you, and the food is always good. However, my last visit wasn't the most pleasing. I tried to switch up my regular orders to see if everything was as good as expected. I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos, and wished I didn't. They fell apart as soon as you picked them up because there was to much sauce. The Ceasar salad was good though, as is everywhere.  Overall, this Cheesecake Factory is good and I would recommend it. Just not the Baja Chicken Tacos!"
Lisa P.,"Meridian, MS",1,2,5,5.0,2/28/2015,"My first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. Wow.!!   Fortunately this one is at The Parks Mall located directly across from our hotel. Since travel is difficult this weekend due to the snow and ice on the roads we were glad to see this restaurant right across the road!  Beautiful restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Seating occupancy I noted was 408 people. There was 5 people in my party and we were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses filled. The menu was VAST.!!  It looked like a mini-book. For our appetizer I decided on Thai Lettuce Wraps. Beautifully presented and they were  delicious, fresh and light. (I forgot to take a picture ). For my entree I ordered the Salmon Genovese. The salmon portion was HUGE.  I noted how there was not a fishy taste to the salmon. I did take a picture so be sure to check that out. It was served over a bed of couscous with a basil almond pesto.  Other entrees within our group were chicken and biscuits and the filet. Everyone was pleased with their meal. And let's not forget desert... Cheesecake of course !!  I had the Dulce de Leche caramel cheesecake (see the picture) and my friend had Banana cream. Mine was delicious. We had plans to attend a movie after dinner but after stuffing ourselves like .... We retired to our room and went to sleep.  A great experience at The Cheesecake Factory. I will definitely dine with them again."
Quinton T.,"Carrollton, TX",0,8,3,1.0,2/20/2016,"Today at the cheese cake factory we literally waited 2 hrs for what we were  told would be a 1.5 hr wait. Upon seating down our waiter Daniel was a bit rude while taking my drink order. While giving my drink order i was interrupted as he stated that he needed time to write down my request. His level of sarcasm went unwarranted and was a bit tacky  considering that i was patient in telling him what my drink was. While giving my order which was specific to my vegetarian inspired diet, Daniel appeared to be coherent. Later he brought my pasta out which was all wrong and upon my ackowledgement that the order was made incorrectly ; Daniel stated that he hadn't heard what i said as if to insult my integrity and suggest that i by some reason was making the infraction up. I mean tell me who wants to sit at a table full of food  and everyone is eating except yourself. He then asked would i like it to be remade.  When i answered yes he became upset, snatched the plate,  and mentioned  before walking off that it would take awhile. I believe with having a background in customer service, it would be customary to apologize when a customer brings to the attention of a representative of a restaurant, that something is wrong. Daniel lacks basic customer service guidelines that other lesser restaurant chains have cultivated their employees to acquire as a characteristic. He even said sarcastically to our table before bringing my pasta out that my fancy pasta was almost ready. When i asked him if he was being sarcastic, he rudely said that he wasn't.  I brought this to the attention of the manager Tim, whom apologized but really didn't seem to care. Not once did Tim take ownership of the issue and at least offer a viable solution. I was most upset by the fact that Tim's non chalant attitude toward paying customers mimicked the attitude of his subordinate, Daniel. I have been to The CheeseCake factory many times and this was the absolute worst. Then to add injury to insult, we ordered the craigs crazy carrot cheese cake, and our waiter Daniel took 20 minutes to tell us it was frozen. I am very displeased by this situation considering we were celebrating my friends birthday and would suggest others to steer clear of the CheeseCake Factory in Arlington if you prefer ""decent"" and i mean mediocre customer service. At the very least i would have been satisfied with McDonald's window side curteosy. At the end of the day i left this establishment hungry and upset and a birthday celebration ruined."
Steven T.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,17,,5.0,2/9/2015,"Cheesecake is delicious obviously but so is literally everything else.  The Mac and cheese balls are outrageous, and the Santa Fe salad is huge and delicious.  I'm glad they switched to black pants though because I always felt like I was eating in heaven with all the white they were wearing.  Ask for Chynna's section."
Lindsey R.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,31,,3.0,2/19/2016,"Nothing really stands out. Seems like a place that would only really cater to the more corpulent customers. Nothing healthy on the menu. Just tons of fatty, high sugar, high carb junk. No stand out items."
Audrey K.,"Mansfield, TX",0,38,,4.0,3/27/2015,The cheesecake is amazing I was not really impressed with my waitress and the food seemed okay at best but the cheesecake again was amazing that's the reason I give it four stars it's what they're known for and it's what their best at.
Jason H.,"Duncanville, TX",116,162,22,4.0,11/14/2014,I always love coming here. First time at this location. I had the Orange chicken and my wife and I split a traditional slice of cheese cake. Our waitress was good and the atmosphere was great. I gave it 4 stars only because the row of tables that have a long common bench for one side of the seating are too close together. Perhaps losing a table would help?  It just felt like we were right on top of the people next to us and since the floor is tiled and the sound echoed a bit this made it feel less intimate and private. Otherwise a fantastic experience.
F R.,"Earth, TX",0,115,47,4.0,8/21/2012,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Sure, the menu is massive, the wait can be long, but the food and desserts are delicious. Granted, not everything is fantastic, but I've never had a terrible meal here. I have a handful of items I like and order regularly, and they are done perfectly every time. Their drinks - especially their Mojito's and Pina Colada's are REALLY good.  I would recommend CF to everyone."
