Chelle R.,"Charleston, SC",239,311,353,4.0,1/6/2013,C'mon Man! It's The Cheesecake Factory!
Shiloh B.,"Oak Cliff, Dallas, TX",0,4,3,5.0,1/18/2014,The food was great! So many options to choose from might be the only bad thing about it. They got everything under the sun. The desserts are must-have so slow down on the entrees. Nice ambiance.
Julie R.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,,5.0,3/11/2015,"Anyone who says Cheesecake Factory isn't good is crazy! Love, Love, Love it! If you like to eat this is your place. Big proportions. The potstickers are my favorite. Love the Crusted Chicken Romano it's so good!!! I've had several other menu items because virtually anything you pick is good! :) The only down fall is eating there later in the evening because it is always jam packed but I've never waited longer than 10 minutes! Red velvet cheesecake is sinfully good !!! I want to go there right now because I am making myself hungry lol"
Kayla J.,"Arlington, TX",8,46,,4.0,8/30/2012,"""You never ate at The Cheesecake Factory before? How could you have not?"" My friends were shocked when I said I've never been there. Honestly, the only thing I knew about The Cheesecake Factory was what I've seen on The Big Bang Theory.  I was with a group of friends one day and we were all craving different things. When one suggested Cheesecake Factory, everyone agreed in unison, then I was bombarded with questions like the one above when I asked what type of food they serve. Wow, oh wow, I was not prepared for the menu. No wonder it was easy to settle on The Cheesecake Factory when we were all craving different foods. Burgers, pasta and -WTH- even Asian food were listed on an X-amount-of-pages menu. Food was awesome! LOVE the Ahi Tartare. Even got a couple of cheesecakes to bring home (it felt like taboo if you don't buy cheesecake at a restaurant with CHEESECAKE in the name). The cheesecakes were just holy yummylicious melt-in-your-mouth goodness. As for the service, 5+++ stars! Our waitress was very attentive, helpful and friendly. We went on a stormy day, so the power got knocked out a few times. But a manager (I think he was?) went to each table and apologized for the food delay and explained how the power outage caused the food orders to slightly back up. Even after our food arrived, he apologized again and made sure everyone was satisfied. First Cheesecake Factory experience, and it definitely won't be my last! I'm determined to try everything on the menu (which would probably take a few years!)"
P H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2110,1595,4321,4.0,8/28/2010,"*Mobile Review* With Elite Yelper: TIffany D. Came here for cheesecake! :D Decor: 4/5 - Spacious dining area and seats - Love the decor Service: 3.5/5 - Service was above average Food Presentation: 5/5 - Eye popping! Taste: 5/5 -Ahi Tartare: the tuna and avocado was very delicious. Definitely get this! -White Bean Hummus: skip this. You get alot of hummus and flatbread but this wasn't as yummy as the Ahi and Pizette. -Fresh Baked Pizettes Margherita: soo savory. Definitely get this. -Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake: (see photo) The cheesecake was larger than the picture in the menu. The red velvet was moist, the cream cheese wasn't too heavy and the white chocolate was mouth-watering. Tiffany D. and I had trouble finishing everything but we left happy. I want Ahi Tartare and Red Velvet Cheesecake!"
David E.,"Arlington, TX",0,10,,2.0,2/24/2015,"Service is terrible, rude and slow. Just pick up a cheese cake to go, the rest of the food is way over priced and bland. I would give this place zero stars but yes the cheese cake is that good."
Mark M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,4,,3.0,1/30/2016,This ended up 3 stars instead of 2 because of the cheesecake.  I ordered the Jamaican shrimp which was okay but a little on the bland side. The most flavorful thing on the plate was the fried plantain. My son ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage and said it was just ok nothing special. The wife had the steak Diane and said she liked it. The star was definitely the salted caramel cheesecake.  Would probably only be back just for the cheesecake.
Ashley S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,,1.0,12/19/2014,I came here with out of town family. It took so long to get a order my mother in law had to leave because she hadn't eaten all day and her blood pressure was dropping.  Took over an hour to get appetizers.
Catrina B.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,2,1.0,12/15/2015,Jerk bartender took the liberty to keep a $2.00 tip for himself assuming he wouldn't get one after he served me a Cosmo with ice in it. Won't support this location again.
Dee B.,"Harker Heights, TX",1,17,11,1.0,2/28/2015,Horrible food....bad taste and didn't even eat it. 4 people and 3 out of 4 was bad. Bacon burger was only thing good. Pasta Cajun and creole was horrible. Chicken Asian  rice dish Thing tasted like microwave  Chinese food . Waiter was good though thank goodness I don't remember his name  or I would mention him won't be back didn't bother with cheesecake
Monica R.,"Harlingen, TX",2,3,6,4.0,3/26/2014,"Took my daughters here for a birthday dinner and was so glad I did! I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and was worried when the waitress informed me that spaghetti noodles would be a bit al dente. I didn't want to feel like I was eating uncooked pasta because most people can't get the right texture but I was really happy after I took that first bite. The bacon flavor mixed well with the chicken pieces. I ordered the lunch portion and was very happy with the serving size. At other restaurants that specialize in Italian foods, I have been disappointed when the dinner portion can all be pushed to one side of the plate. You feel kinda ripped off.  When it came time for dessert, I looked at that cheesecake menu and thought.... How in the world am I gonna pick just one! Lol! My 8 yr old ordered the S'mores Chocolate Cheesecake and my oldest ordered the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake! For those of you that don't mind feeling like you broke every diet you can think of these desserts were well worth it... Lol. Chocolate lovers I'd try the s'mores one. They were both creamy and rich. Although my oldest didn't like the whipped cream, I thought it balanced out the sweetness. Told the girls next time we come just for dessert! The waitress was awesome. She remembered me saying it was my little ones birthday and when it came time for dessert she added a little treat to the cheesecake along with six singing waiters! I was shocked because I didn't even think to sneak away (like you do at most places) to ask them to do that. Just one more reason I had to write this looong review lol! Hope you experience this when you go! :)"
Mindy S.,"Fort Worth, TX",58,42,142,1.0,4/12/2014,Went here for a birthday... asked if they did something special for a birthday and they said yes and I told them I would like them to do that but they never did. Thanks for nothing. Horrible. And that person really needed the cheering up because their dad just died.
Christine C.,"Rowlett, TX",26,36,1,3.0,8/2/2014,"Always very consistent, predictable food from all locations. Have a mai tai with your meal, they're awesome here!"
Jimmy L.,"Woodway, TX",4,8,,3.0,9/13/2014,"The people at the hostess stand seemed unorganized. Took around 5 min to gets on the list to get a table.  Once we got seated, the waiter was nice, although he didn't know what beers the bar had."
Revy C.,"Dallas, TX",31,13,4,2.0,9/13/2014,"By far this cheesecake factory franchise has the worst service ever. I have been to Cheesecake factory restaurants everywhere: California, Washington and Minnesota. Our server, Stephanie, did not bring our requested drink despite of the things we have told her. The food came pretty slow and when I requested to bring some olive oil and balsamic vinegar for our bread, it took her long enough, we finished most of our bread.  Instead of bringing the leftover to help us make it to go she just brought the container for us to do it ourselves, rude. There is no point going to this restaurant again with that low standard service."
Anonymous S.,"San Jose, CA",2,65,,3.0,11/26/2014,Ordered spicy cashew chicken . didn't realize the entire dish was going to be covered in teriyaki sauce. Additionally ordered the chicken somosas. Most unauthentic food I've had. Complete trash. Never coming here again. Thankfully the cheesecake is good. Dont come here for anything but the cheesecake.
Taco M.,"Marshall, TX",56,48,14,1.0,7/27/2014,Horrible. We waited for over an hour. I had to flag down the waiter to ask about our food. Apparently he forgot to turn in ticket . The manager walked by a few times and never seemed to notice we didn't have food. They gave us our drinks at no charge. The last time we were there the service was better but food was decent chain food. I doubt we go back to this location.
John F.,"Fort Worth, TX",229,5,,1.0,11/20/2015,"I'll start off by saying I love the food here, it is always consistently delicious and Cheesecake Factory has a super well rounded menu. This was still the case when I went here last night, but the service was absolutely terrible with nothing done to try and amend it. My friend and I sat in the bar area so we could enjoy happy hour drinks. We arrived at 5:30 and each ordered a mojito...10 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks so my friend inquired with our waitress who said they should be out shortly. Well 20 minutes later (no exaggeration) we finally had our drinks and our waitress informed us that the ticket hadn't been put in for some reason. We ordered another round of mojitos so that we could get them in time for happy hour, which took at least another 15 minutes to receive them. We also placed our food orders within 10 minutes of first sitting down. About 30+ minutes later another employee (I'm assuming some form of manager) informed us that our waitress had clocked in as a trainee and therefore our orders hadn't even been placed. He offered us an appetizer for while we waited but we declined because they always serve big portions and we didn't want any additional food...I did mention that the same thing happened with our drinks and how service had been frustrating. Overall, it took over 50 minutes from the time we ordered our food until we actually got our meals. Then came the bill, and absolutely nothing was comped. I would have been at least happy had they taken off one of the $5.50 mojitos that we waited an absurd amount of time for, or given us a voucher for future meals. But this was not the case. I could understand if it was just our drink order that was delayed, but our food was delayed too and we were expected to pay full price for admitted incompetence. You would think that continued business of a customer would be would be worth more than the cost of a drink or food. But this experience made me extremely disappointed with the manner in which our dining experience was handled. I hope upper management gets to read this review because it's been a long time since I've been so frustrated over a dining experience."
Rebecca G.,"Brownsboro, TX",5,26,,4.0,8/6/2012,"I found myself torn between 3 or more stars.  The menu is far too big for those like me who are indecisive with yummy choices.  The server was of little help on our questions, and told us that our salads were small.  Since we were hungry we got an appetizer too, only to find out that we could have shared the ginormous salads and still had dessert!  To top it off, the salads lacked flavor except for the few pieces of fruit/nuts/cheese sprinkled throughout.  It was like searching for gold nuggets in a sea of bitter lettuce. Of course, the two highlights far surpassed everything else so much, that I had to opt for 4 stars.  Appetizer:  Firecracker Salmon...I wish this was an entree. Albeit an incredibly fattening one, but needless to say I want more!  Perfectly crisp bites with salmon that is not too overpowering the way salmon can sometimes be.  Skip over the forgettable salads and onto dessert because you can't go to a place named ""The Cheesecake Factory"" without trying it.  We shared a piece of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Oh, mouthful of joy!  I could have eaten the whole damn thing!!  I think next time I'll skip the meal and leave more room in my belly for appetizers and dessert  :)"
Cleotis P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Wife and I go out for an romantic dinner at one of her favorite restrurants and instead recieved horrible experience and an manager who could care less about his customers experience.... we where placed and a booth for four that has the two chairs on the otherside. Well soon as we set down there is a (birthday)party of 7 set right next to us, not having enough room at their booth one person is left standing. The waiter goes to find a bigger area.... 15 mins later the person still standing and obviously upset ask to use our chair, which he gladly gave up. We receive our food 15 mins later and what do you know two more people have arrived to the birthday party. Now the booth part where my wife is sitting is the only available spot for them to sit. Without asking we now have a guy partially sitting at our table sitting elbow to elbow with my wife while we eating. He's feeling uncomfortable as we are too.. my wife now trapped in between the guy and the wall would obviously need his permission to leave the table looses her appetite and stops eating. By now we have been here over an hour packed in a corner with an overcrowded party group who was promised a bigger table space but now are receiving there food instead. I finally ask to speak with manager and for a carry out for my wife. 15 mins later comes the manager, by this time I'm pissed, I explain ever thing to him as the group of 9 closely listens.  He looks at me like what exactly do you want me to do about it, states that they been working on getting the party a bigger table and walks off....  Clearly leaving me and my complaint as if I should not been complaining.... anyway we payed for the food tip the waiter good as he had nothing to do with the seating arrangements and was getting a hard time out of the birthday crew a left never to revisit this location as long as this manager is working there"
