Frederick S.,"Irving, TX",106,109,4,2.0,2/17/2012,"Y U NO AS GOOD AS SOUTHLAKE? This place always lets me down somehow, but I love me some CF. Last visit -- Pasta portion half its normal size Two forks had excess amounts of food from previous diners Other silverware in other napkins had small bits of 'stuff' ... Waitress was absent-minded. ""Oh, yes, would you like some bread?"" Huh? This is Cheesecake Factory. You get bread with your dinner. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Manager said that if I was to come back to ask for him. Really nice, very genuine and empathetic guy. Shame the same can't be said for all of his staff.  If you really want a nice dining experience, go to the Southlake location instead. Worth the drive."
Anna H.,"Irving, TX",12,58,9,3.0,2/14/2012,"I am a big fan of pastas and every single time when I went here , I was very disappointed. But recently, I found my favorite pasta dish and it's the Chicken Bellagio!!! Loved it!! The portion is too huge for one person , so if you get to try it out , share it with a friend."
Jason M.,"Mansfield, TX",330,97,183,4.0,9/18/2012,"went on national cheesecake day.  from   i had a coupon for BOGO.  i had a bit of an appetite for not just dessert so i ordered a special pecan crusted fish.   the sauce on the fish was really good - but i don't think it matched the homemade mashed potato's or corn salsa.  the sides were really great but i don't think any of the choices would've paired well with the sauce on the fish.  don't get me wrong, the fish was great but i have no idea how it was supposed to fit in with anything else. now the cheesecake - had the red velvet and the carrot cake cheesecakes.  AWESOME as always.  but the highlight was national cheesecake day and the new oreo cheesecake.....drum roll....disappointment.  it was like someone trying to put a bunch of oreo's into some kinda cheesecake without any though as to the taste.  hmmm..  let's put oreo's into the cake, and a few on the side, and some more in the crust, and top it off with yet some more and we'll call it oreo madness...ok cool, but doesn't taste all that good and i love oreo's. good food, big prices and decently big portions and quality.  of course having a coupon helps/"
Mimi T.,"Dallas, TX",73,482,74,4.0,9/13/2012,"I'm a fan of this place only because of their chicken madera! Lightly breaded chicken breasts served on a bed of mashed potatoes and asparagus with this delicious brown sauce. YUM! My sister and I came in for lunch one nice day, and sat outside on the patio area. It was pretty nice until the wind caught us and blew on this dirt onto our food.  We ordered several plates to try, but definitely shared a chicken madera. We tried the...  Ahi tuna tartar- served with wonton chips. The dish itself was good, and I didn't need the wonton chips. Samosa- huge disappointing dish in my opinion. I've had samosa at traditional Indian restaurants, and this tasted nothing like it. It really lacked flavor. about 3 or 4 came in one order, I took a bite, and stopped eating. Wish I could have sent this dish back and not get charged for it, BUT I did stay classy, and just paid for it because I did order it after all.  Firecracker salmon rolls are my favorite appetizers here. It's like salmon wrapped in a spring roll, fried (think of salmon egg rolls), and served a tasty sauce.  Dessert: red velvet cheesecake. It was huge, of course. My sister and I were only able to take a couple of bites, and had to box the rest home.  Overall, we had a good lunch out here. Would have been better without the wind. I think we'd opt to sit inside if we come back. All the Cheesecake Factory restaurants are all the same, so once you've been on one you've been to all of them."
Damon B.,"Arlington, TX",541,287,77,3.0,7/30/2012,"My wife wanted to go here for her birthday so we loaded up the Flex with the kids and made the short trip to The Parks.  We went on a Tuesday around 7:30pm and The Factory was not busy. Because the entrees are so large, we decided to pass on an appetizer, until we saw the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It was OK, as other restaurants, instead of chips, you get toasted bread with it.  Something about eating this type of dip with chips instead of bread.  Anyway it had good flavor and was enough for the four of us to share. For our entrees, my son had The Club, my daughter had the 4 Cheese Pasta, my wife had the Garlic Noodles with Shrimp and I had the Clubhouse Salad, minus the Beets.   All of the meals hit the spot and of course the women had plenty of left overs. We ordered 3 cheesecakes, a Hershey's, a Red Velvet, and a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. The cheesecakes are not cheap ($8-9 per slice) and The Factory does not put the prices on the menu.  Make sure you ask, as the 3 we ordered cost $26.  And, of course they were great! They only have a few draft beers available.  Overall, good service, good food, and warrants a solid 3 star."
Crystal R.,"Mansfield, TX",316,9,12,5.0,3/18/2014,"My favorite place to grab lunch and a whole cheesecake home. I am one spoiled, snotty foodie and this place is nice on the inside out decor wise and I always leave full! Xo"
Cat N.,"Dallas, TX",1122,1401,1473,5.0,12/21/2009,"the service here used to suck when they first started but it has gotten better!!!!  I love cheesecake factory! its one of my favorite restaurants! I just think their cheesecake is average....not bad but not that great for like $6 a slice. lol anyway, I always get the hibachi steak!!! so good!  and I love their tropical tea and crab cakes :) Its a good restaurant to have group dinners!"
Kelly B.,"Arlington, TX",49,13,,1.0,6/24/2015,"Last night, my boyfriend and I went to the restaurant and it was around 7:30, not very busy.  We were seated immediately, which we thought was awesome.  It would have been totally awesome if we had ever gotten service.   My partner and I reviewed the extensive menu so long that we had actually decided on our dinner choices AND dessert  and still, not a soul had come to greet us at our table or take a drink order.  After at least 15 minutes, I noticed a couple hat had been seated at the same time that we were and they had drinks AND FOOD!  We still had nothing.  We looked around to see if we could catch someone's attention and you would have thought we were totally invisible to the staff.  Another couple a couple of tables from us even gave me a very uncomfortable look and I am not sure why.  We kept trying to make eye contact with ANYONE that worked there,  No luck,  We decided to leave and as we walked out, there were more people at the front of the restaurant and still, not a single person on staff even recognized that we were leaving.  Had we of been served, I bet we could have dined and dashed and gotten totally away with it since we were completely invisible.  Never in my life have I been so disappointed with the service in this sort of establishment.  It's sad too because we are not cheap and we are good tippers."
Chung H.,"Garland, TX",1,6,,1.0,5/10/2014,Don't bring large groups here.. They don't take reservations with long waits and keep saying your up next when its been almost 2 hrs!!' WTF
Nadine F.,"Brussels, Belgium",347,1076,5,3.0,5/21/2009,"Once upon a time, the Cheesecake factory was a far off, magical place to Arlingtonions.   We would make a special trip to Dallas for it on birthdays and Mother's Day.  Well, travel no more!  There is a Cheesecake Factory within our very mall now! The cheesecake here is probably two stars, and the food is one star at best.  I'm giving this location three stars, however, because I am extremely impressed that Arlington has a Cheesecake Factory, and because I'm not aware of any other place to get cheesecake in Arlington.  I'm about 90 percent sure that we only got a Cheesecake Factory here because of the new Cowboys Stadium, as a way to help class up Arlington.   I believe this should be the city's next big campaign, rather than its recent push for tourism: ""Help class up Arlington.""  It should be a plea to bring anything nicer than a Chili's to our city in anticipation of the 2010 NBA All-Star game and the 2011 Super Bowl, both of which will be played at the new Cowboys stadium in Arlington. To all the other reviewers who gave the Cheesecake Factory one star, I have one question: Why are you ordering food at the Cheesecake Factory?  I don't think they ever made any claims that their food would be good, only the cheesecake.   I ordered some cheesecake and a cup of coffee, and I got exactly what I expected.  It was decent, and the service was excellent."
Tamlin D.,"Arlington, TX",0,4,1,1.0,7/22/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is great! But this one? Definitely not. I went this past Saturday and not only got poisoning ONCE AGAIN but also had terrible service. We were sat at a tiny table that wouldn't even fit a child and was EXTREMELY close to the people next to us. Do not go here the seating is awful and awkward.  The food here is not good compared to other cheesecake factory's and I've gotten sick from this one multiple times but not once when I was traveling and went to others? Oh and the hosts outfits were too short and they weren't all the same making them look more like guests rather than employees. I will not be returning.
Ivory W.,"Dallas, TX",10,23,19,5.0,12/18/2013,Love their breakfast and brunch. The breakfast burrito is amazing and service is great.
Jim K.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,24,3,4.0,8/16/2013,"Went on a busy Saturday night. Ended up eating at the bar which worked out great.  Tried lots of apps this time and ordered a few beers, and of course cheesecake. It was all good. Service was excellent.  Good stuff. Is very popular, so the wait was pretty long.   But the service was still quick and the food came out hot and quick.  Always takes me awhile to review the menu book."
Chris R.,"Bellingham, WA",0,57,18,4.0,2/19/2014,"The usual Cheesecake Factory experience, but still far better than the Cheesecake Factory in Austin, TX. This one is up to the usual (yes, it is still a chain) level for the Cheesecake Factory and the food is quite good and fresh tasting.  Went here after a night of shopping as it was conveniently located at the shopping mall. Had the usual 1 hour wait but we walked around and waited for our page. Service was good until they sat a very large party next to our booth (maybe 16 people in a long row of tables). Then the waiter didn't bother coming by for a long time. they served our food and just left. No shaved Parmesan for the pasta, no refills of drinks - just nothing. We had to flag the waiter down when he finally looked our way. Not terrible, but still, that is your job."
Lacci H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,4.0,2/15/2014,Awesome food as always but i waited 2 1/2 hrs on V Day no surprise. But no matter the day theres always a wait! When u finally get your food its awesome.
Christine C.,"Arlington, TX",383,541,123,3.0,6/6/2009,"I know how perfectly stylish it is to hate on this place, so I'm trying to give them a fair review here.  Two lunch-size orange chickens, two bowls of clam chowder, and two iced teas = $40. G'dam. That gift card is gone. The decor is a bit lavish, though I don't see why that should be a valid reason to ever knock a place. Still, I love their clam chowder (available Fridays). I've had some good sandwiches, alright pasta, average pizza, and bad orange chicken (it had tasted better on a previous visit; I have no idea what went wrong). I like their anniversary cheesecake.  The food is generally just alright; they have a varied menu and are pretty good at meeting the wants of a mass clientele, per their goal. It seems like for everything I've liked here, I've had something I didn't. While the food is relatively pricey, they do heap it on your plate. Perfectly middle-of-the-road and deserving of three stars."
Hong V.,"Arlington, TX",162,36,1,4.0,10/25/2010,"This review is strictly for their happy hour specials because, honestly, I think most of their food is overpriced. M-F 4-6pm they have $5 cocktails (mojitos and cosmos are what I can remember) and other alcohol specials and a TON of appetizers and small plates for around 5 bucks. I loveee the buffalo blasts -- buffalo chicken wrapped and fried in some sort of paper/shell (looks like fried chicken).  The portion is very generous, about 5-6 pieces plus celery sticks and buffalo and blue cheese for dipping. The last time I was there my cousin ordered the tamale cakes and that too was very generous.  I'm not a huge avocado fan but they gave you plenty of cut up pieces and even a tiny wedge of it.  There were 3-4 cakes on the plate and they were so soft and moist, dollops of sour cream on top, yummmm. We also shared the pizzette -- sausage and ricotta -- and it was soo good.  I've also had their margarita pizzette, which is another popular one.  This is def. my #1 choice for cheap happy hour snacking/dinners; you get a TON of choices and portions for your buck!"
Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",514,2583,7,4.0,10/2/2010,"The CF reminds me of a high-school all star game.  It is not quite the best of all of the players in the world, but it is the best of all of the players in the specific league.  In this case, CF takes the best of chain restaurants and places them on a squad with a big role player: cheesecake. I had a few expectations going into this one: boring food, high prices, and standardized decor alongside routine service.  The Cheesecake Factory actually blew these expectations out of the water, and I now see why it is the choice for big groups, non-exploratory eaters looking for something different, and dress-up dinners. The mushroom pizzette (mini-pizza) was nutty, not too cheesy, and the dough had just the right crispness.  Conclusion: pizza that is on par with California Pizza Kitchen, a solid choice for family-friendly pies. The farmhouse burger was awesome.  It had a well-cooked over-easy egg, smoked pork belly--which was way better than bacon, and a perfectly grilled bun.  The fresh thick-sliced tomato and light layer of mayo also contributed to the rustic and simple concept.  It was also nice getting asked ""how would you like your burger cooked?"" at a place that usually grills beef to coal.  A great artery-clogging choice at $11!  Verdict: A well-made burger worthy of placement on an upscale pub. The Factory Famous Meatloaf could easily compete with any mom and pop diner.  The meat itself had a nice beefy moistness, but it could have used a little more seasoning.  It was not as greasy as ordinary meatloaf, but the mushroom and onion gravy had a bit of that stale/salty characteristic, sort of like a gravy that comes out of a box.  2 large slices and a huge portion of mashed potatoes and corn sucotash for $11 at lunch! Decision: meatloaf that could pass on a standard homestyle joint, such as Luby's... and I love Luby's. Sides were not bad either, though very conservative.  The corn succotash was a bit boring with just zucchini and peppers, but it was tolerable.  The white rice was on the hard side.  Surprisingly, the salad was actually a bowl of mixed greens. CF pulls out all of the stops, and it does so pretty well.  Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary, and you will be pretty pleased."
Amy L.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/2/2015,"This place is over priced, the service sucks, and the food is was gross, if I were you I rather go to Chili's or Applebee's at least the food is better and the price is much better then here. Lunch for 3 was $80!! And all we had was 2 appetizer, and two burgers and  fish tacos, the fish tacos had no favor and they skipped giving us bread maybe because we ordered appetizer but still if you give everyone else bread you should give us bread maybe they see that we were minority's. Overall I will never come back here again I rather eat at Chili's and have Walmart cheesecake!"
Jessi H.,"Ennis, TX",0,4,,3.0,2/7/2015,"Got to this restaurant around 8:00 on a Friday night and was seated around 8:40. Usually when a restaurant is this busy its either a sign that it's really good or a sign that the service is really slow. On this particular night, it was the latter. My family loves CF but had never been to this location (and wont be back for that matter). Our waitress Kadesia (sp) was awesome. We ordered the avacado eggrolls as our appetizer. My family loved them as well as their sweet sauce. Definitely better than the ones they serve at BJ's but just not my thing.  Too southwesty for my taste. I stuck with the fresh wheat bread. Its my favorite. My husband and myself both got the cajun jambalaya pasta. After adding a ton of salt it had flavor but I just couldnt get past the very over done and mushy linguine. I had 3/4 of it boxed up for my dog. He doesnt mind mushy noodles. For dessert I ordered the tuxedo cream cheesecake and it was GREAT. These people may not know pasta but they do know cheesecake. My husband was less satisfied with his. He got Chris' outrageous cheesecake (reminded him of a german chocolate cake). It was good but he felt like he missed out on something great by ordering this. I will say though, he did eat the entire thing. We ended the meal with a cafe mocha each. It was good enough. He drank his and mine. Pretty much... it was a disappointment. If not for the great waitress, fresh delicious bread, and the yummy cheesecake I would have given one star. Food service was slow, it was really loud, and if youre charging me $17 for a plate of pasta it better be aldente. If a chain restaurant is what you want just go to Macaroni Grill. They never do me wrong."
