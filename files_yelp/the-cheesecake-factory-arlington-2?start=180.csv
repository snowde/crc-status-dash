P R.,"Arlington, TX",2,53,,4.0,7/29/2011,"YAy, this location makes my favorite dish here correctly.  They can make the cashew chicken without burning the carmelized chicken.  I use to frequent the Southlake location and they ""F""ed up my food repeatedly like it was charred, and the didnt comp the check after I complained.   Service the few times I have eaten here has been good, and the food was good."
Ashley R.,"Arlington, TX",62,23,4,2.0,3/25/2010,"Although I used to be an avid fanatic of the Factory, I cannot bear to go to this location again. The Pros: The Tamale Corn Cakes and the Thai Chicken Pasta dish were amazing! The texture, temperature, and garnishes were all dead on and delicious! I especially loved the peanut sauce in the Thai dish. The Cons: Their Prime Rib was over-cooked and practically flavorless. The bread was cold (almost frozen?). Service...what service? Our waitress was non-exisitant! She never checked on us, forgot one of our appetizers completely, and the kids meals we ordered before ANYTHING came out when the adults were about finished eating. The manager brought them out and rather quickly said: ""You the one's waiting on the corndogs? I'll take them off of your bill."" and ran off! We never got refills, and on top of all of this-- we never recieved an apology, plus we had to beg for the bill. Then (I kid you NOT), the waitress had the nerve to ask if we wanted desert (I realize it's part of her job-- it's called discretion, she should have atempted to use it), when we ignored her question-- she began rambling off several desert items, stopped mid-sentence on one description and said ""I'll just stop now, since you don't care anyway."" How immature and unnecessary was that?!  BOTTOM LINE: I've most certainly had better (at less of an expense too) and I will not be going back unless taken against my will!"
Darlene O.,"Grand Prairie, TX",108,178,431,4.0,6/26/2014,"The funny thing about Cheesecake Factory is I never actually go for cheesecake. They have good drinks (I recommend The Georgia Peach, my newfound favorite drink) and the bread is always hot and fresh. For appetizers I recommend their chicken samosas which comes with this mint cucumber sauce which complements the samosas well. I also recommend the avocado egg rolls too! My Mom loves those! For the entrée, I always get the tomato basil pasta with shrimp. SOOOO GOOD! The basil is what makes this dish! The last couple of times however, I noticed it was a bit on the salty side (so you may want to tell them to hold the salt on your order or go easy on the salt). My other favorite entrée is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which comes with three breaded chicken breasts, mashed potatoes with the skin left in, and plantains. Both dishes are absolutely divine! The service can be hit or miss. On some occasions, I have had great service but other times (like the last time I ate here), my service was slow and the waitress we had was terrible. I figured she was new because she didn't know much about the menu and she didn't really check on my friend and I. Can be pricey. Usually my order consists of two appetizers, a drink and an entrée and for that I end up spending close to $50 not including tip. I wish they took reservations especially on holidays. Sometimes the wait can be up to two hours long. Last time I went on Mother's Day and had to wait for an hour and a half. They do not take call-ahead seating either."
Colin B.,"Arlington, TX",389,453,699,1.0,2/26/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is everything that is wrong in one restaurant. Where to begin... - Obnoxious decor. I feel like I am in a 70's porn star suite in Vegas.  - The menu is 30 pages, has advertisements, and half of it is exactly the same as something else, minus one ingredient. That tells me ""not a lot is good, so we make up for it with bulk. Good luck!"" - The prices are silly for what is obviously Cisco food truck food. - The portions... Seriously? Do I need 17 pounds of Pasta with Meat Sauce? I am not obese, I don't want to obese, nor do the other 8 people that can eat off this single plate. - The service is obviously scripted, corporate jargon mentioning this, telling you about that, oh did I mention we have, b.s. Just take my drink order and get on with it. - On an unrelated note, I do feel sorry for the servers here. Looking at the clientelle I can only imagine they hate working there.  The one good thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake. It is good, very good actually. But yet again, the portions are obnoxious so take a friend and split a piece. You can do better for a dining experience in Arlington for half the price. This joint is attached to The Parks Mall for crying out loud. The last time that thing was cool the original Bush was in office."
Jennifer C.,"Arlington, TX",132,36,3,4.0,4/16/2012,"Plan on an experience when going to The Cheesecake Factory and be prepared to browse through a book they call a menu. It can be a bit overwhelming and it all sound delish! We went recently for my 12 year old's birthday(her choice). We went on a Thursday evening around 5pm and there wasn't a wait. Although, I've been on the weekend a little later. You can bet you'll be waiting then! On this particular occasion, we were seated right away and greeted by a very personable waitress. She took our drink orders and was prompt. We ordered appetizers of calamari and spinach dip. She also brought us a complimentary baby plate for our 18 month old that included chopped bananas and bread. My husband, 9 year daughter and son enjoyed the calamari, while my 12 and 8 year old daughters shared the spinach dip with me. I really liked that they served sour cream and tomatoes on the side. For entrees we ordered mac and cheese and chicken strips for the 9 and 8 year olds. They were happy enough. My other daughter ordered a Smokehouse BBQ Burger which came with onion rings on it. My husband ordered some kind of burger too. He ate the whole thing before I ever looked up! You can order your meat cooked to preference. They both really enjoyed it. I dined on the Chicken Bellagio which was out of this world. It was two coated pan cooked chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with prosciutto and arugula salad. This is by far my favorite item I've ever eaten here! I've also enjoyed the lettuce wraps in the past. We then ordered desert.....it's cheesecake, come on! Between all of us we had the Original(my personal favorite), Resse's( peanut butter heaven), Lemon Raspberry Cream, and Wild Blueberry White Chocolate. They were all terrific. I think I prefer the Adam's Peanut Butter over the Reese's. And if you love Red Velvet you'll really love the Ultimate Red Velvet.  It is a bit on the pricey side, especially if you have a large family like us. It ran just shy of $120 before tip. But it's definitely a nice treat! And the service is usually great. On your birthday they bring your cheesecake out on a plate decorated with Happy Birthday and your name spelled out in chocolate. They do sing, too!"
Daniel M.,"Arlington, TX",86,28,14,4.0,3/14/2012,"Great food no matter what you order, their calamari is freaking gooooood! Their pastas are pretty darn good as well. Get yourself a slice of White Chocolate and Blueberry Cheesecake, OMG, TO DIE FOR! Ambiance is pretty nice as well, looks great, can get pretty damn busy though, make sure you plan on waiting a bit, especially on Thurs. - Sat. evenings. Service was a little lacking, took a while to be asked if we needed anything, but it may just have been because it was busy as fu**."
Joshua C.,"Austin, TX",20,78,9,3.0,6/3/2012,This place is just okay. The food is bland. The cheese cakes are yummy; other than that its a waste.
Emma T.,"Arlington, TX",0,9,,3.0,4/16/2010,"Skip the food and go for the dessert! They have a red velvet and cream cheesecake right now that is amazing. I couldn't even finish half of it, so I had a great snack the next day.  Service is good if you go late on a weeknight like I did. Pretty calm, no screaming kids around either."
Lisa B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",40,1,,1.0,6/25/2015,"Went to Cheesecake Factory at parks mall with friend. Ordered buffalo blasts, waitress came back in 10 min and said they were out. Then Ordered Mac and cheese burger and another 10 min and waitress said they were out as well. Finally ordered smokehouse burger and friend had finished meal by this time. Staff brought smokehouse burger but it was missing onion rings and had wrong sauce. Waitress confirmed it was the wrong item and we sent it back. Waited even longer and manager came out and offered free cheesecake. By this time it is 930 pm and we have a 9 week old not interested in waiting longer for dessert. Had to ask waitress nicely to make this right as I hate being that person and the manager gave us 25 percent off, which is basically the price of my soda as my friend only ordered a appetizer and I only had a burger. WORST experience ever and management had to be asked to act. Why is it only those that make a big deal complaining get any service?"
Garner S.,"Kennedale, TX",1,5,1,4.0,4/19/2012,Giant portions so its a great place to share an entree then each get their own cheesecake and share between the two.  Not good if you are on a diet.
Marc Y.,"Dallas, TX",1,40,41,4.0,3/23/2013,Their strawberry cheesecake is really good. I also enjoyed their spicy buffalo chicken sandwich.
Dest D.,"Keller, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/2/2014,My order and drink were fine but my moms and brothers were completely messed up. Their orders and drinks were completely wrong. It took an hour to get our food and they gave us a waiter with a broken arm! WTF!! we were lucky he didn't drop anything but had some trouble doing stuff. He should be on cash register duty or something else besides waiting on people. He probably dropped someone's else meal with a broken arm. We haven't went back since. Seeing all these bad reviews makes me want to never go back again.
Nika S.,"Atlanta, GA",3,27,,4.0,9/11/2010,This place was amazing last night for my birthday have been there 2 other times but it was over 2 years ago! Thanks to Yelp I had everything running through my head to make sure I gave a correct review! 1. We went at around 6ish so there was no wait. Got seated and waitress came immediately. Told us about the specials and  soup of the day with out us asking... I didn't get either but i appreciated the effort. 2. Drink was $10 which is why its 4 stars it was a small small martini BUT SSOO GOOD!!! Hubby wasn't happy about the price but oh well it was my bday! 3. the breads that came out were delicious!!!! Then we ordered We got the crunchy fried cheese (not cheese sticks) and OMG they were to DIE for!!! I normally need ranch on stuff like that but didn't here they were perfect Fresh Parmesan on them garlicky ugh perfect!!! I ordered just the normal steak (cheapest one @ $19) but it was so tender and juicy also didn't need any kind of sauce! Came with fries that were good too but i was so obsessed with the steak i couldn't think about the fries! haha Husband got a chili burger or something  cant remember now... but he said it makes Red Robin look like McDonald's! 4. Our waitress(cant remember name as it was the wrong name on ticket) was AWESOME! she asked about something every time she walked by even if she was going o a diff table. Then she said she loves those cheese things and that NOTHING is EVER frozen there except the cheesecake! She said she walked in the big freezer they have just to check and that's all that was in there! So that was good to know! 5. THE CHEESECAKE!!! I had to wait to review this as I needed to eat a bit of it first but OMG it was DELIC!!! I got the 30th anniversary cake... Original Cheesecake with chocolate cake and chocolate truffle ream!!! OMG!!!  Its just so good i don't even know how to describe it! hahaha GET THIS ONE!!! 6. The bill as high after everything we got but that was all so worth it!!  Only giving 4 stars as it is connected with the crappy parks mall (needs to be down the road where an old pie place was then it wouldn't attract as much trash!) ad the drinks were expensive for how small they were and there wasn't that much alcohol n them!!!  Other than those 2 bad things I would love to go back all the time! Dress Casual to dressy since its in the mall!
M H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,58,,2.0,7/13/2012,"I like a CCF, expect this one. The food is not good at this location. I have been here twice, just not good. Service is great."
Sunny C.,"Arlington, TX",0,11,,4.0,2/7/2011,"I have enjoyed every visit to The Cheesecake Factory.  Everything is a bit over the top, from the decor to the portion sizes and prices, but I like the indulgent feel of it all for a dinner out with my husband.   The service has varied, but the food has always been wonderful.  I am partial to the Tamale Corn Cakes, the Hibachi Steak, the Miso Salmon and the French salad with roasted beets and goat cheese.  There is always enough to take home for  lunch the next day! The drink menu is great .  I recommend trying the the El Diablo . It is a really good version of a margarita on the rocks with pomegranate juice."
Dee D.,"San Diego, CA",23,53,41,1.0,2/25/2009,"I DON'T EAT SLOP AT ARLINGTON, TEXAS CHEESECAKE FACTORY  (On Cooper Street), and I certainly don't expect to pay $20 a plate for slop.   The story goes like this, first of all I agree with Chris, this was a ""comedy of errors"" and I live here, but ""I don't speak Texan."" I took my daughter here for her birthday.  I have eaten at 4 Cheese Factory up and down the coast of California many times, in Atlanta and Raleigh -- the food to this point has always been good, and it has always been a pleasant experience......THEN CAME TEXAS . . . We ordered 2 Bikini Martini's and water.  We got the cocktail after like 30 minutes or so, with the waiter stating that it took a little longer to make??   Then we ordered the avacado egg rolls.   They came pretty quickly, but were rather ""soggy"" -- the avocados were over ripe.  We ate about 1/4 of them.   My granddaughter was with us also, so we ordered her a ""kid's chicken tender basket"" (this was $9.95 - little pricey for a 1 year old kid).  The waiter who I guess thought he had a ""great memory"" (since he did not write anything down)  had us repeat our order a couple times as he may have had ADD (attention deficit disorder) I suppose. My daughter ordered the fish tacos, which she has had on other occasions.   She was very dissatisfied, only ate one.  I ordered the ""catch of the day"" (that should have got away).  It was Maui-Maui blackened.  I have never been disappointed by ordering the catch of the day at ANY RESTAURANT until tonight.   I took 1-2 bites of the fish, a bite of the mashed potatoes and broccoli I had on the side, and was so disappointed, that I did not eat another bite. The meals came out in bits and pieces.   My granddaughter got hers......then about 20 minutes later my daughter got hers......and then about 15 minutes later I got mine.   I don't know about you, but when we go to a restaurant, we prefer to eat our food all at the same time.   O by the way, by now we had to ask for that water we ordered as soon as we sat down, and we finally got it. The waiter asked if we want a refill on our cocktails, which my daughter had ordered, but never got (I guess it slipped his mind, since he didn't write anything down. Being that it was my daughter's birthday, I thought I would have them sing the traditional ""Happy Birthday To You"" song.  I told her I was going to the bathroom, and asked another ""worker"" if he could let my waiter know it was ""her"" birthday (wanted it to be a surprise).  He peeked over at the table, and said, ""Her, right there.""  I replied with, ""Yes, that's her at that table.""   About 30 minutes after returning from the Ladies Room, our waiter comes over with a glass of ""tea"".   Hmmmmm....I thought that was curious.  We both shake our heads no, we don't want tea.  The ""worker"" I had told about her ""birthday"" some how confused that with ""tea"" ..... Like you Chris....""I don't speak Texan."" So long story longer, I let the waiter know I did not want the Maui-Maui, so he said he would take it off the bill, which he did.  Some lame manager comes over and asked what the problem was with the dish, and I told him, ""It tasted like it had been frozen and thawed and had no flavor whatsoever.""   I also wanted to complain about other things with the waiter, but he came over while I'm talking to the manager and stood there with a ""don't say nuthin' bad 'bout me look on his face.""   I felt like I was on the spot, and so I left it at that. AGAIN, I don't eat slop, and this is what this meal was.  I really didn't want to pay the bill (I don't mind paying for good food, but not for slop).   I paid my $64 and rounded that off to $70 with the tip --- it was painful to do.  I will be calling the head manager on Monday because they need to ""pull-up"" to Cheesecake Factory standards.   This was just B-A-D!"
Oscar C.,"Arlington, TX",39,86,1,3.0,12/1/2009,"This was my first time visiting the Arlington location and it was average. I did find two mistakes on my order, but I did not make a big deal out of it since I did not want to wait around for a manager. The first was that there was a chip on my glass of beer. I almost put my lips on that side of the glass. I am glad I did not because I probably would have scratched or cuty my lip. Second, while digging around my salad, I found a mosquitoe or gnat in there. It was soaking wet from the balsamic dressing. I just put it up against the side of the plate and quit eating my salad.  The cheesecake is good, but costly at about $7.50 a slice. It does seem that their slices have gotten smaller over the years. I think this is a fun place to go with a group if everyone is going Dutch, because it is pricey."
Russ H.,"Arlington, TX",23,81,,5.0,3/31/2011,"What can I say they were awesome, I informed the waiter of my gluten issues and he told me that their normal allergies menu was withdrawn due to issues. He went to discuss my situation with the kitchen manager and they both came out to give recommendations. I ended up getting a Baja Chicken Benedict made with corn tortillas and stuff...it was rather good."
NaTisha N.,"Monroe, LA",3,7,,4.0,3/3/2012,"Ok, I've had CF in three different cities Birmingham, Miami, and Dallas and each time it's the same: entree - eh, ok, NEVER satisfied. But, dessert - DELISH! Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake NEVER fails. Makes me smile every time.  Banana's Foster is now a new fav... I'm a FAN of the desert, NOT the entree's!"
Double T.,"Arlington, TX",12,23,,4.0,6/21/2011,"Well, it's the Cheesecake Factory. The main dishes usually seem to be good, if a little overpriced. Of course, you come here for dessert, which is fabulous. I love the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake... delish!"
