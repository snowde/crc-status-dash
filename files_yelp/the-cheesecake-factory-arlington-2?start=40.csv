Lexi B.,"Arlington, TX",70,52,115,5.0,5/7/2016,"Stopped in for lunch. It was ok. I had to dust crumbs off my seat, as the greeter watched. But after that, my waitress was sweet and nice. I ordered a flat bread and fried zucchini. Both dishes was oh so delish."
Nora T.,"Arlington, TX",384,20,18,4.0,12/10/2016,"Getting straight to it, I thought my pasta for this visit was alright. It wasn't as flavorful as it looked but it was filling. I tried he jambalaya Cajun pasta which is pretty costly but the portion size is reasonable for it. However, I still give this place four stars because my prior experience with their food left me feeling five stars. They have such a wide range of choices for food that I wouldn't want to base my review off this one meal but my prior meals at this restaurant as well. I'll have to give it another try and see how that goes then"
N T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,50,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"I normally like CF but this time I ordered the chicken and waffles eggs Benedict. It was not good at all. The hollandaise sauce tasted odd. I'm not sure if it was the batch or that's just how it's made. Either way, I spent $15 bucks for a few bites. I was not at impressed and a little irritated that the waitress never asked me if I wanted a different plate. So basically, i spent that much on something I didn't eat. Not happy."
Tonita C.,"Arlington, TX",0,20,7,3.0,7/22/2017,"This location is at the always, insanely busy Parks Mall. As a result, wait times on weekends or holidays can be atrocious, but that's anywhere. During the week, we have been able to get in and seated in a fair amount of time. I've never been a huge fan of their food-it's plentiful, but tends to lack flavor (at least the dishes I have tried did). CF is on the pricey side, but who doesn't know that? I hate that they discontinued the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! TIP: if you visit the Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble in the mall, they sell cheesecake slices for nearly half the price of what you would pay at the restaurant."
Kathleen M.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,1,1.0,4/24/2017,"Service was slow, waited 20 minutes for bread with a hungry toddler.  My daughter ordered a salad with her burger.  Took forever to get the food and salad came out with the burger even though she asked for it before the meal.  Some rude guy (not our server) said that all sides come with the meal as he walked away from the table.   My fries were so over cooked they were hollow inside and my daughter's were so under cooked they were hard.  My daughter's salad had mostly brown and wilted greens.  She didn't eat it and we paid extra for it. We have been here several times and had great service and great food.  Nothing that we ordered today was good.  Some of it was edible but for a $50 meal it was pretty pathetic. Our server came over and asked us if everything tasted great.  I said no.  He came back and said his manager said to offer us another salad or more fries.  By that time we had eaten our weight in bread (which was amazing) and had been there for over 90 minutes with a 2-year-old.  We didn't want more salad or fries.   We definitely won't be going back there ever again and will warn all our friends about eating there."
Huong T.,"Arlington, TX",52,111,14,1.0,9/24/2016,Was there last night and was very disappointed the food went down in quality and the portion are smaller. Was there on a Friday night and there was no wait it should have been a hint that I should have left. I lost one of my fav restaurant :(
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,4.0,2/8/2016,"We had the Chicken Madeira and it was great as usual. The service was a bit on the slow side but it's Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant was clean and the restrooms were, too. We found a weird object in our cheesecake so I felt obliged to let them know. The manager came over and apologized about it quite sincerely. Instead of offering a discount or something he asked if we needed anything to-go. We were traveling from out of town so this was useless to us since we were staying at a nearby hotel. At least he asked us though I suppose.  The breads were a bit stale tasting and a little too hard around the crust but they really got the chicken madeira right so I'm not going to complain much about anything else."
Jessica C.,"Laurel, MD",0,7,,1.0,10/2/2017,"I've frequented a lot of Cheesecake Factory restaurants across the US. This has by far been the worst. Myself and a friend visited during Happy Hour. I ordered a margarita and the spinach dip and my friend ordered the chicken sliders. The margarita was all juice. I asked the waiter to take it back and bring another one that wasn't a virgin. He said he would ask a manager if it will be ok. He brought the drink back with a teaspoon of tequila added. The food took forever to come out and when it arrived the chicken was cold and the spinach dip was barely warm. I asked to take the dip back. He said that it comes out only warm... not hot. I told him that I always order it and it's usually hot. He wanted to argue. I still sent it back. When it came back, the dip was hot, chips were cold. I was done. I just asked for my bill. I will not visit again when I'm visiting this area. Gives me a different vision of Cheesecake Factory as a whole."
Amanda M.,"Duncanville, TX",80,70,87,5.0,10/14/2016,"The food was outstanding, the service was amazing! We came here on a Friday night and got our food very quickly. I can't wait to come back here!!"
Ria G.,"Arlington, TX",17,127,91,2.0,2/11/2016,"Generic food. Tons of menu options makes for a confused diner.  Their food tastes a little better than other chain restaurants I have to agree, but they're priced higher too. I would like to stress on 'little' and 'chain'. Ordered the parmesan crusted eggplants, and the dish had 4 eggplant medallions and pesto angel hair on the side. The medallions weren't as crispy as I would like, and the pasta was way too dry. The flavor of pesto was so-so.  My friends got the fish and chips, with coleslaw and it was done right. But again, very basic taste.  What I did enjoy were the cheesecakes. The key lime cheesecake was a little more tart than I had anticipated, but the chocolate mousse cheesecake was good.  They sell ""vanilla"" food at an upscale-ish setting for double the price. I'd rather dine at local restaurants where they provide more creative flavors, and relaxed dinning experience."
Kimberly J.,"Denver, CO",150,6,2,2.0,2/15/2017,"Sever took a long time to actually greet us. He wasn't helpful with suggestions, and every other table but us got bread. This was around 3pm and the place was dead. NOT ACCEPTABLE."
Kenny N.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,6,7,5.0,10/19/2016,Had a great lunch here with my wife and daughter.. food came out fast and my fish and chips was off the chain..
Love B.,"Arlington, TX",18,13,4,3.0,2/6/2017,Staff was very friendly. Me and my friends went while it was very packed till where we had a 59 minute wait for a table. Waited very long for drinks and food and even appetizers. I loved the atmosphere but we couldve went somewhere else they were that slow.
Regina B.,"Duncanville, TX",2,58,41,3.0,8/1/2016,"As always the service was great! But my food this time was not. Trying something new, I had the fried fish tacos and avacado rolls. The fish was bland with absolutely no flavor, the rice was bland and over cooked, and then something on the taco was stupid spicy but for no reason.  The avacado rolls are deliciously different and the sauce makes it but share them because it'll get boring after eating them alone. Overall the tempura fish tacos a busted but I'll be back!"
Emma B.,"Orlando, FL",52,283,429,4.0,7/30/2015,"Came here purely for the cheesecake, as it was National Cheesecake Day - any slice half price. We had a slice of the kuala and banana cheesecake. Both were good. Our receipt came with a $10 e-gift card if you do a survey, we'll probably be back to try the food, I hear everything is made from scratch."
Kenzi A.,"Midland, TX",0,1,,3.0,7/26/2017,"The food was good, as with every Cheesecake Factory. They even made adjustments to a couple meals to meet dietary needs in our party. However, the service sucked. We had a good meal, but when it came time to dessert, it all crumbled. We ordered one slice of cheese cake and one slice of chocolate cake. 15 minutes after ordering, they came to tell us that the cheesecake was frozen and was that okay since we were taking it to go. We said sure. Then another 15 minutes later, they tell us they actually don't have that kind anymore. We ordered something else instead and instead of comping us for the long wait and the mistake. They added it and 10 minutes later, the dessert finally came. By the time we left the restaurant, it was 11."
Cody A.,"Fort Worth, TX",13,11,2,2.0,3/26/2016,"The service was TERRIBLE and we went at 4PM when they weren't even busy! Open tables everywhere and the waiter we had just preferred to hang out around the tables with diners drinking alcohol or stand near the bar with other waiters/waitresses. It took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our waiter then 20 minutes to get our food. Another 15 for dessert, and then TWENTY to get the bill, pay, and leave.  We didn't get any bread at the beginning of our meal, either. At first we thought it might've been because we ordered water, then a nearby table sat down, ordered water, got bread. We then thought it might've been because we ordered appetizers, after all, we were really there for the cheesecake. Well, then another table sat down, ordered literally the same salads we did, got bread. Then we figured it was because our waiter was a d-bag and that ended up being the correct reason."
Wilhelmina M.,"Arlington, TX",28,122,224,5.0,3/31/2016,"Every time I come here, it's usually pretty busy but that doesn't stop the service from being great! They have a huge menu which can be a little overwhelming at times but all the food I've tried there is awesome! Annnnnd don't even get me started on their cheesecake! It's the best! I've made it a goal to eventually try every cheesecake on their menu."
Tiffany S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",388,508,776,5.0,5/24/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite restaurant but they always get it right. My most recent visit to Cheesecake Factory was to celebrate my birthday. It was a cold, rainy day (which is strange in Texas in May) so the restaurant was pretty empty. Actually it seemed like there was someone celebrating their birthday at virtually every table. Our waiter was extremely attentive and kept our bread supply at a great level the entire night.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich with avocado and my cousin ordered some variation of surf and turf. Both orders came out hot, fresh, and delicious. Since it was my birthday, I decided to go for the cheesecake. When you go to Cheesecake Factory, you don't just get regular cheesecake. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake, which I couldn't even eat that night because their portions are so huge and I was stuffed. So what do you do when you're too full to eat your cheesecake with your dinner? You eat it for breakfast the next morning of course."
Cheryl G.,"Tyler, TX",12,105,244,5.0,9/5/2015,"The family comes here every time we drive up for Six Flags from Tyler. It's great every time. The salmon is delicious and the cheesecake is spectacular. My daughter got the kids bow tie pasta and she loved it. Orange chicken is great, chicken and biscuits are wonderful too.  Not one of us has ever eaten anything we didn't love here. We will keep coming back. The service is wonderful. Kelvin is an awesome server. Salted caramel cheesecake and original are both great. Slices are big and can be shared with 2 to 3 people. Meals are generous servings as well.  Tiramisu (not the cheesecake one) was dreamy and elegant. Coffee is good too. Bathrooms are clean. 5 stars! We had 5 guests this visit so one child pasta and four entrees, 2 desserts was $102 before tip. I don't think that was too much at all."
