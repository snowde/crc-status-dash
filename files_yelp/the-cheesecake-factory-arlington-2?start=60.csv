Amelia O.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,9,4,4.0,7/1/2016,"I came to eat here with family last Friday (party of 7, wait time only 15 minutes). I ordered the Edamame as an appetizer and Chicken Bellagio for the main course. The edamame, although delicious, became too overwhelming as I got to the bottom of the bowl due to the soy sauce drowning the beans. When my main course came in I was reluctant because I usually just get a plain Alfredo when ordering pasta and I don't leave that comfort box too often. However, the Chicken and noodles were SOOO delicious. I'd definitely come back for more. I gave 4 stars due to lack of service, our server came by only once to check on us and wasn't very attentive to refills. The lighting is dark at night and I didn't find it quite appealing but that's a personal preference."
Tamara D.,"Arlington, TX",185,121,499,5.0,8/9/2015,"Precursor: customer service kinda sucks on Sundays during brunch (understatement).  Now that I gave you the ""veggies"", the dessert part of the review is this place's awesome happy hour. SIT AT THE BAR!! There is a crazy yummy burger that they serve only during happy hour for only $5 and it's super delicious. They also have specialty cocktails for like 5 or 6 dollars as well. Happy hour is from 4-6 and M-Thursday(maybe friday too). The only kicker is that you basically have to go to the mall to go here since it's connected, but it's totally worth it."
Polly N.,"Los Fresnos, TX",0,3,7,5.0,6/29/2016,Best Mac and cheese eveeeer!! full of creamy cheese!! I love carrot cake so I got the carrot cake cheesecake and I almost fainted of happiness. It was super delicious!
Jonathan E.,"Arlington, TX",140,240,369,4.0,1/19/2016,"I really wanted to give 5 stars but there where just a couple things that kept it @ 4 stars.  I would recommend everyone trying this place out at least once.   Started with some Diablo Shrimp for an appetizer.  Was just ok.  Nothing spicy or special.  Also had a Caribbean Cooler which was very tasty but surprised me by having a liquidy milkshake consistency.   Meal wise I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  EXCELLENT !! The spicy New Orleans Sauce made the dish.  Parmesean Crusted Chicken strips on top paired nicely.   Cheesecake wise I wanted pretty much all the flavors but settled on Salted Caramel.  Caramel cheesecake with Caramel Mousse on top of a Blonde Brownie.  It was good even though I regretted my choice afterwards.  Tiramisu, I got you next.   Thus place is MAD expensive but it's worth indulging yourself at least once."
Shea U.,"East Arlington, Arlington, TX",64,1,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Came with some friends and the service was SLOW. We had empty glasses, dirty plates all over, and they never checked on us. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING (I'm taking used feminine products all over a stall, with trash flowing out the trashcans). As for the food, it was nothing to brag about. It made my boyfriend and myself sick. We were not impressed and won't be back."
Lauren M.,"Fort Worth, TX",273,219,642,3.0,3/12/2014,"Went to dinner here with family and friends for my bro-in-law's 21st birthday.  Very busy on a Thursday night at 6:30pm, but it was spring break. Waitress was quick with taking drink orders and very on top of drink refills.  She even took a group picture of us before we ate. Complimentary bread (white and a brown bread) served room temperature with cold pats of individually wrapped butter.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine....if the bread isn't warm, cold butter doesn't work! Could only take pictures of four entrees, due to the size of our group.  First was this ridiculously large bacon ranch chicken salad, with mixed green  veggies and grilled chicken cubes with BBQ sauce.  The one who ordered this shared some with three other people and still didn't even eat half.  Shame, as the salad comes already dressed, so no way to take it home. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with five, yes five, pieces/slabs of fish.  They were hot and the batter was flaky and very crisp.  The fries were meh, so I only ate a few.  I gave away one piece, at one and 1/2 and took the rest home.  The coleslaw was cold, crunchy with a great flavor.  Big slabs of carrots, seriously 3"" long, mixed it...not sure how you eat those!  Be warned, if somehow you eat the whole thing, it's over 2100 calories! Hubby had the wasabi crusted tuna, cooked rare, and ate most of it.  He ordered brown rice and it's nice they give you a choice. FIL and BIL both got the crispy spicy chicken sandwich and remarked that it had no spice at all, even with buffalo sauce and chipotle mayo.  They both loved this in the past because it was super spicy so both were disappointed. We opted for no dessert as we were having cake later; however, they brought a scoop of ice cream, with whipped cream and a candle, for the birthday boy.  I thought it odd that they didn't serve him a piece of cheesecake since that's their signature item, but given the price point of those ($8-$12) I guess that's why. All in all, very passable food for a huge chain, but I wish there was a way to order smaller versions of this high-calorie, probably really bad for you food!"
Kevin M.,"Tehachapi, CA",129,5,,1.0,4/23/2017,Took almost 30 for us to even get a waiter to get us drinks. They completely forgot our table and they're wasn't even an apology. Really disappointing because our family loves Cheesecake Factory.
Teshania L.,"Arlington, TX",80,94,200,5.0,10/3/2014,"This may be a little too much TMI, but who cares lol!!!! Majority of the time I only come here when its that time of the month for the BIG piece of truffle chocolate tower cake!!! I normally don't like chocolate cake but this one right here (in my Kat Williams voice) is to die for. As soon as I got in the car I ate half of it before i made it out the parking lot it got real!!  Man only if Code Red fell on a pay week every month I would be in Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake heaven."
Cecelia S.,"Arlington, TX",38,59,1,4.0,3/6/2016,"Had lunch on Saturday here ... was seated immediately and the server was there almost immediately to take my drink order and ask if I wanted an appetizer.  I just ordered unsweet tea, and then waited for the drink to appear.  The server set it down on her way to deliver someone else's meal .. which was fine.  Then I waited.  When she finally came, I placed my order and asked for a sweetener for the tea.   Nothing.  The place was very busy ... after about 15 minutes, my salad arrived (Chinese Chicken salad), delivered by someone other than my server ... I asked him for sweetener, and he brought me some immediately.   I did not see my server again until I was almost done, and she was taking orders from people at the next table.   The salad was delicious ... but the service was a bit sporadic.   I might have had a better experience if I had not been on a schedule, so was very aware of the time ... but over all a good time."
Vi N.,"Arlington, TX",59,50,188,3.0,9/27/2014,"The service is usually pretty slow here so don't come if you're in a hurry.  We  always order the firecracker salmon. The wrapper is crunchy and the salmon inside is cooked but not too dry. The sauce is almost like a sweet chili sauce. I take my spoon and drizzle it on the roll. I really like the cabbage it comes with because it's softened in the sauce and has a dressing but I couldn't really tell what that was. I just mix everything together.  I always order either pasta da Vinci or miso salmon. Today was pasta. It's my faaaaaavorite. I love the button and shiitake mushrooms, onions, and even the chicken is moist and flavorful. The sauce is buttery, creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. I have a friend who usually orders extra sauce on the side and throws more in there! It's awesome. I do crave this pasta dish. It's hard to order something else when I'm there."
Danielle P.,"Arlington, TX",342,16,5,3.0,8/17/2015,"So I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go. Got home and opened up my box and it was covered with tons of whipped cream to the point where I couldn't even see my cheesecake. I wiped it all to the side to see that this cheesecake was significantly smaller than usual. I didn't really think too much of it then. But I stuck a fork in it to find out than there was no bottom to it?.... Where was the chocolate cookie crust it's suppose to have? Did they eat it?? I've been here a number of times and never had this problem. This was my first time ordering to go though. Does this usually happen with to go orders? Regardless, the cake was exceptional. I'll be checking if they've eaten part of my cake next time though...  Trolls.."
Brett B.,"Newton, KS",0,18,,3.0,3/11/2017,"We only got the cheesecake, which was good but not worth the price.  Was way too busy to stay and eat, got the cheesecake to go.  The bathroom was filthy with trash all over the floor."
Foodguru84 F.,"Arlington, TX",0,12,20,5.0,3/7/2016,That was a great experience!  The menu has a lot of choices to any taste. We ordered a California avocado salad and a grilled salmon. Salad was huge with a lot of ingredients. Salmon was very good too. Cheese cake with white chocolate and raspberry is out of this world! Waiter was very friendly. Will be back to try more dishes.
Doc G.,"Dallas, TX",180,265,499,2.0,7/9/2014,"OMGoodness. The server was nice, but the service was terrible. After 45 mins of waiting for our food, 3 staff members came to ask how we were doing. Our reply was consistent each time... 'hungry', we replied in unison. How did they think we were doing?  Finally, once the food came, I was told that the salad dressing I requested off the menu was one they did not offer. What? Once I showed the server the dressing listed on the menu, she then explained to me how I could just make it myself if they brought me some vinaigrette and lemons. Again, what?  Fast forward. My appetizer finally came out after we finished our entrées. Our server admitted remembering my appetizer order, but not realizing that I wanted it BEFORE (NOT AFTER) my main course. Third time, say it with me now, what?  After ordering cheesecake, the manager was nice enough to comp the appetizer and dessert. Great move. Too bad we had to make a special request for that CONCESSION, and it wasn't offered willingly.  The food was pretty good (not wonderful), but the service was bad enough to keep me away from the CF for a couple years, unless I had a compelling reason to go again."
Keith D.,"Arlington, TX",1,18,1,5.0,7/28/2016,One of the better places I have eaten. My wife and I went all out and stayed under 70$. The blended drinks are some of the best I ever had.
Sharon B.,"Arlington, TX",2,32,,5.0,7/27/2016,"One of our daughter in law's favorite places, so when she came to visit from out of state we went.  My husband and I had never been before.  It was very nice! I got the avocado toast. It was SO good.  Dear husband got nachos and liked them very much, daughter in law got a wrap, One grandson got the child's portion of salmon and the other got cheese pizza. We were all very happy with our food. For dessert we all split 3 pieces of cheese cake.. Salted Caramel  Oreo Chocolate Mousse It was a little expensive, but we don't do this every day.  So, it was worth every penny.  We took lots of left overs home and had a great time."
Megan S.,"Austin, TX",15,74,47,4.0,6/9/2016,"I just really love this place. They have so so many options that can please even the pickiest eaters. The bread they serve in the beginning is my absolute favorite and the cheesecake at the end is the best dessert ever. Hello lemon meringue, I'm talking to you! Their prices can me more than some places, but I think the food makes up for it. Although, at my last time here I was given cold asparagus with my salmon, but after I told the waiter he brought me a huge plate with asparagus like triple the order amount, so I think that makes up for it."
T D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,20,2,3.0,1/16/2017,"I ordered some cheesecakes a few hours prior to pickup, but when I got there I was told that there wasn't an order put in for me. It would take an hour and a half to thaw....these were for a birthday party that I was on the way to!"
David C.,"Columbus, KS",1,52,12,1.0,12/20/2016,"Where should I start this terrible Christmas dinner experience.  I had never experienced any bad service or poor food issues at a Cheesecake Factory anywhere that I have visited until last night.  On a Monday night at 5:15 we got a table very quickly.  That was the only positive.  Here we go....Our server took forever getting our drink order and bread to the table.  It took forever to get our food.  Then the nightmare got worse.  They brought food out one at a time over the next 15-20 minutes.  I never got my food.  The waiter never acknowledged us, checked on us.  After my family finished their meals another server came out with my dinner 30 minutes later.  I said take it back.  The person that brought it stomped off.  I had asked to see the manager three times, but they kept stating he was on the phone.  Finally he came to the table and apologized.  The meal was free.  The waiter still didn't check on the rest of my family.  Some glaring issues I saw at this location.  The people next to us never got their appetizer and had meal issues.  Manager was apologizing at their table as well.  People waited very long for their food.  Our waiter was not attentive, didn't fill our drinks, didn't check on us.  For my sons $20 meal the portion was not acceptable.  Other locations were 30% more in quantity.  When you have 5 people come in for a dinner and plan on dropping down $130 for a dinner you expect good service and a quality experience.  Management needs to wake up and be visible in this restaurant.  I heard other stories from patrons while walking out after my 2 hour ruined dinner experience.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory for ruining our Christmas dinner.  Thank God Chick Filet was in the food court.  You won't have to worry about seeing us again next year, Merry Christmas!"
Paul D.,"Westworth Village, TX",39,113,200,4.0,6/13/2014,"A good place with a ton of options. A shade on the pricier side, but the sheer volume of options makes it well worth a visit.  Also, they have something called Key lime cheesecake. I want to go to there."
