Chris C.,"Wichita, KS",235,21,17,1.0,6/23/2015,"I'm getting real burned out on the Cheesecake Factory! This one in Arlington Texas is particularly poor. We ate here on a Tuesday evening and walked right in without waiting. I had to add sour cream, cayenne pepper and salt to the spinach artichoke dip to give it some flavor and to help it from being dry. My wife and daughter shared the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. My other daughter ordered bbq bacon burger and I ordered chicken and shrimp gumbo. Just as dinner was about to arrive, the waitress came to the table and let me know that my gumbo wouldn't have any rice because they ran out. She wanted to know what else I would like with it? I said it's not really gumbo without rice, can I order something else? They obliged... But everything I happen to like from there is gumbo or Chinese (rice dishes). I had them bring out my families dinner so it would be hot, and then ordered Chicken Bellagio (their recommendation). It took about 25 minutes for it to come out. My family was almost done eating when it arrived. The pasta was cooked together (clumpy and under done), sauce was weak and almost non-existent, and it was way under seasoned.  On the upside... The Bellagio was free. The downside, Gordon Ramsey wasn't there to back me up!  I didn't say anything, because I really believe they were trying hard to please. The sad thing is, my wife and I ordered a strawberry shortcake to share and they shorted us on the strawberry's (about 1/2 cup). My daughter got the lemon meringue cheesecake, with the meringue runny and my youngest ordered plain cheesecake with extra, extra, extra whip cream (she received an extra spritz). In the whole chain of cheesecake factories, we've had some great service and unfortunately this one falls at the very bottom of experiences. If you must go... Go to a different location! This trip to TCF took us 2 hrs 15min."
Bianca G.,"Arlington, TX",88,62,100,1.0,4/18/2015,"The manger Tim was not hospitable. Our order was incorrect and he said he would comp it. What else would he do, we didn't fix the food. We just ordered it. It was wrong and he wanted us to be okay with the order being wrong. I'm already against eating at Cheesecake Factory ! Unsatisfied!"
Loren M.,"Madison, AL",66,41,57,4.0,8/19/2015,I visit the Cheesecake Factory frequently. Nothing about this place really disappoints or excites me. The food is good and the menu is extensive but that's about it.
Esthefania A.,"Hurst, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2016,The service was terrible. I went last night at 8:25pm and I ask the girl how long was the waiting time for just two people. She said 10 minutes and she ask for my name. It was 9:10pm and we saw other people go ahead of us and they got there after we did. So I go to the desk and ask her why she hadn't called my name. Well turns out she didn't even wrote my name. And she didn't even apologize. And every hostesses was rude. And the food wasn't that great either.
Ai Vy N.,"Dallas, TX",836,345,2647,4.0,4/8/2012,"I love everything I have tried here, from appetizers,side bread,to pasta entrees, and of course desserts. Their Vietnamese tacos are my favorite, even tho being vietnamese myself, i have to say, it's kind of a half n half vietnamese tacos. The inside is real close to what you would get in a vietnamese sandwich (banh mi), but the buns outside is straight up chinese lol. Still, the flavor is sooo good!!! I also love their wheat bread, it has a lil hint of sweetness and maybe something else in it that makes me almost addicted to it :D.  Their jambalaya pasta or watever it's called is really good. You have to give it a try.  I have had the red velvet cheese cake, another cheese cake with kalua coffee, and the black out cake. The black out cake is currently the winner."
Frito B.,"Arlington, TX",0,13,,1.0,10/4/2015,"Worse experience last night, the waitress was slow and took care of others before she even tried to help us.  Appetizers were cold, food was bland, no flavor what so ever. Our waitress boxed everyone else's leftovers but when it came to us, she gave us boxes to do it ourselves. Management saw what she did and took care of us!  Not sure I will be going to this location again. This place seems to be going down hill everytime I go. Next time I will go out of my way and drive to Southlake for better service!"
Rosemarie R.,"Irving, TX",53,50,41,5.0,3/13/2015,"I love the food at the cheesecake factory and their deserts are pure awesomeness. They have a myriad of options to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful. When the day is nice and sunny, I like sitting out in the patio."
Abba L.,"Arlington, TX",10,11,3,3.0,2/27/2016,"Thursday night my friend and I sat at a high top table in the bar area at the Cheesecake Factory about 8pm. Our waiter, Jason, started out on a pleasant note. He was quick to bring us drinks and to help us place our orders. After our meals arrived you would have thought the building was burning down. Jason stopped by our table to ask how we were doing no less than 8 times. He never offered us another drink. Mid bite with a half plate of food sitting in front of me, he asked if I was done and if we would need to go boxes. We told him over and over again we were doing great and would let him know if we needed anything. He brought our check to the table in a booklet and left it standing up on the table. I laid it down on the table as not to distract from our meal or conversation. A minute later he came back (we were still eating) and said I'll take care of this for you. I told him my card wasn't in the booklet. He told me to leave the check booklet upright until my card was in place. Totally unprofessional. As we were about 3/4 through our meal he came back by and asked if we would need the salt and pepper shakers any longer. Sensing he wanted us to pack it up I asked if his shift was ending. He enthusiastically said yes and he would like to close our tab. We weren't even done with our meal.  He reluctantly turned us over to another waiter. We ordered another round of drinks. My friend was sipping on her Georgia Peach and gave me a strange look. She pulled a small piece of glass out of her mouth. We showed it to the bartender. She agreed it was broken glass. She then examined the bar area and the machine that makes the drink. Yep. More small pieces of glass. Casually she explained her co-worker had seen and mentioned a glass breaking earlier in the morning. According to the bartender it appeared her co-worker never cleaned up the glass. Her quote to us was ""I wonder how many other drinks were served with glass in them"".  Jason thank you for the memorable bad service.  Lazy am. shift bartender you suck. Eat glass."
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",556,124,154,5.0,6/10/2015,"This is gonna be a short one, because come on it's Cheesecake Factory.  So when we arrived around dinner time the place was completely packed. Like, wall-to-wall people standing. UTA students had just graduated so it made sense, but talk about frustrating. Expecting to walk up and be told there would be a 45 minute wait we prepared ourselves to think of an alternative. The hostess said it would only be *15* minutes and we definitely had our doubts. But lo and behold, we were seated in 15 minutes! Our server was very nice, clearly overwhelmed by the people, but she knew we were in a hurry and was completely on board. She brought us drinks quickly, brought us bread quickly, and of course our food as well. It just went surprisingly smooth and I want to commend the entire staff on handling the craziness so well!"
Ace W.,"Arlington, TX",16,37,248,3.0,4/5/2015,"Standard American franchise Resturant ... I think the other Resturant in south lake is better. The steak Diane was over cook (even though we ask for medium rare) but salmon was good. And the chicken and biscuit is a cheese cake factory  classic, really good.  The crab bites was not so good, the mixture was still raw inside, but the avocado egg rolls were really good! But the best part of cheese cake factory is the cheese cake... The s'mores cheese cake to be exact...awesome !!"
William B.,"El Paso, TX",10,25,103,5.0,7/15/2015,"We had a great time eating hear at the Cheesecake Factory.  The food was prepared very well and taste so authentic and seasoned very well.  The raspberry and strawberry lemonade was made to perfection and was so quenching of our thirst.  They have a vast amount of cheesecakes to choose from and make sure you bring an appetite to enjoy it.  The size is double the average cake size but is designed very well.  Hope this help and overall, I will give this restaurant 4 stars out of 5 and would recommend this restaurant to family and friends."
Joshua R.,"Dallas, TX",164,23,47,1.0,2/21/2016,"Front ""greeter"" is RUDE.  Party of 10, likely going to be spending a lot of money, we go to check in on a Sunday, expect a wait but she tells me for a party of 10 I need to speak to a manager.  Ok, I wait to speak to a manager just to check in.  Once he comes over to me, he tells me about a half hour wait.  Ok, no problem.  It has now been over an hour and 15 minutes.  When I walk back over to the greeter to make sure I am still on the list, she rudely doesn't even bother answering me but motions with her lips and makes a hmm hmm sound that apparently is yes in some non-customer-oriented training.  Standing here, multiple parties of 6 continue to walk in, and we are still waiting."
Molly P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",262,12,4,1.0,1/13/2016,"Cheese cake factory, oh how you failed me. I've been coming to this location for about 6 years. Everything was great until last night. Me and my date had gotten terrible poisoning. We ordered the Smoked House burger and the Skinnylicious soft tacos. For dessert, we got the wonderful strawberry short cake. Everything tasted fine, but for some reason we were throwing up and hugging the restroom after our dinner?  That's okay, at least their service was excellent."
Fonda H.,"Arlington, TX",0,5,1,4.0,10/8/2015,We went to cheesecake factory to celebrate my Bro n law birthday! We had a blast! Enjoying family and friends! Red velvet cheesecake is to die for!
Bertha M.,"Irving, TX",2,8,34,2.0,1/17/2015,Well the cheesecake factory is overrated  The food is good but not great (nada del otro mundo) super crowded.. service was ok.. Why do people make such a big deal about the cheesecake ..sorry!!! I think Walmart cheesecake is better.
Deborah B.,"Arlington, TX",16,10,8,2.0,2/9/2016,"I was really looking forward to going here because we don't have one where I live. We walked in, the hostess didn't look up for about 2 minutes we had to ask how long the wait was and then she said ""well if y'all sit there then you don't have to wait"" with an attitude. So we sat down at our table we were not assisted for 20 minutes. During that time two waitresses were arguing over who should have the table. Finally after getting three people and a manager someone took our drink order. Our food came out delicious. But then after we ate it took almost 30 minutes for the waitress to come back and she was in such a hurry to close us out that she didn't even let me see the cheesecake menu. She gave us or check before we could even ask. So it was a waste of a 50 minute drive for cheesecake I didn't even get to enjoy."
J L.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,9,10,3.0,7/25/2016,"My husband and I had dinner here on Saturday. We were seated at once. The server was friendly and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. Once the food arrived, though, a bit of disappointment set in. I had ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. My husband had the orange chicken with brown rice. His was great and he ate every bite. Mine, however, wasn't as expected. The garlic noodles were plenty buttery, but lacked any sign of garlic. No flavor, scent, or sight of garlic. The chicken was three bland pieces of baked meat. Tough and tasteless. If we return, I won't reorder this dish. Since my husband's food was good, I will take a chance on something different."
Miss V.,"Dallas, TX",5,99,20,1.0,12/25/2015,"Updating: husband got food posioning twice here in less than 2 weeks. Called to discuss it with the manager, naming specific dishes, dates, and times. Was told I would get a call back after talking to other managers and staff to see if he could locate the problem. Never heard back. So....I guess we'll stop eating at this location for multiple reasons."
Marcus Adam M.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,15,8,5.0,5/6/2014,"We had a party of about 25, seating took very little time which is very awesome!!! Our waiters were very polite and were on top of their game. Our glasses stayed full and we were all very satisfied.  Once we ordered our food everything came out and was correct! No mistakes. For the birthday boy they sang him a song with the help of us too.  The atmosphere is great here as well. The lights are dim and the ambiance is very dinner appropriate. I don't think I would bring children to this establishment though. It's more adult friendly.  Now of course you have to order a cheese cake from this establishment. They are large portion sizes and two people could definitely share one piece. The red velvet cheese cake is my favorite. It is to die for.  All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good date night place to eat."
Jenny K.,"Ennis, TX",0,8,,1.0,9/16/2016,"After waiting in line for 10 minutes just to check in, we decided not to stay because it was an hour wait. We tried to order a couple of whole cheesecakes to take home to avoid the wait. We were told that they could only sell us the frozen variety because the ones in the case are ""for the restaurant customers"". Apparently we don't rank among ""restaurant customers"" even though we were holding cash & standing IN the restaurant. We won't be back."
