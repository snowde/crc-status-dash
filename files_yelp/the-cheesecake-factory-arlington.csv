Ebony B.,"Washington, DC",135,3,2,5.0,8/9/2017,"This is one of my go to places in the DMV area.  The food is good and the service is great, especially on yesterday.  When you go, please ask for Nyko. He was a dynamic server with great conversation. His dinner and drinks recommendations were on point and delicious.  Please try the new Celebration Cheesecake! It is amazing."
Jessica D.,"Waldorf, MD",73,5,8,2.0,1/7/2018,"The experience today (Sunday) for brunch, was not so good. The service was okay, but she talked way too much. She also talked about the people she was serving who sat at the table next to us because they didn't eat meat. She went on and on about them not eating meet and they could clearly hear her.  I had to ask for the free bread that they give out, twice. When our food came, both my potatoes and my husband's were burnt. I asked the waitress about them and she said that they were supposed to be that way. See pictures. I unfortunately will not be back here. ALSO, I called the manager over to our table to tell him about the burnt potatoes, and he looked at them with a blank stare, stupid, almost dumb look in his face and just said ""okay"". He did take an entire off my bill though. Still wouldn't come back."
Matthew S.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",0,30,3,2.0,9/17/2017,"Oh! How the mighty have fallen. When Cheesecake Factory first started,  it was a unique and mildly exotic dining experience,  with a diverse and eclectic menu.  Along the way,  they over expanded and have lost quality control.  The items are exotic if not slightly overpriced,  but they don't deliver like they previously did. In the last month, I have eaten (dine is too charitable ) at 2 CF locations. One had poor service and ridiculously undersized portions. But this location took the cheesecake!  We ordered a hamburger,  that in a previous life, had been the sole of a shoe.   The accompanying fries were cold.   Our salads were ok, ok being the highlight of the experience.  The waitress disappeared,  did not check on the progress of our meal, and when she did return ro begin clearing the table,  we were treated to an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke.  Disgusting!  We paid the tab, but before we left, I had one more entertaining experience.  The men's room was filthy,  floor and other surfaces, details omitted in the interest of good taste. I told the manager who shrugged,  so I  added that even gas stations laugh at this place.  It all bespeaks a lack if attention to the details that enhance a dining experience.  Since Cheesecake Factory is 0 for 2 at two separate locations,  I can only conclude that their expansion has outpaced their commitment to quality.  The experience is no longer new, and if it doesn't remain consistent,  maybe it is time to move on."
Sarah M.,"Washington, DC",23,76,64,3.0,8/25/2017,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's over the years.  But this is the only one that didn't have a wait on a Friday night at 7pm for a table.  And now I know why - the front side of the house/service is a sloppy mess.   The food though is typical of Cheesecake Factory with a few subpar notes: the bread basket came out room temperature instead of warm like it should be.  The salad was over dressed.  And the edamame we ordered looked wilted and like it had been nuked in the microwave shortly before being brought to our table (something tells me that's exactly what happened).  Not the best food I've had from a Cheesecake Factory in other words, but not terrible. This location earned its three stars for the slow service (20 minutes to get a check after we'd asked for one for example).  But the worst part was they sat us at a dirty table that hadn't been wiped down from the last customers.  I asked to be seated someplace else as it was clearly and visibly dirty.  They didn't accommodate us despite many open tables (????!!!). Instead, after standing around for a while, the hostess got a paper towel and did a half-hearted job smearing around crumbs and chocolate on the seats and then walking off without a word.  I spent the next five minutes cleaning the table myself with a napkin.  So after cleaning my own table I then got to pay $20 for a tuna salad.  Something about that felt deeply, deeply wrong.   Bottom line, there are so many places to eat in Clarendon, and I love Cheesecake Factory in general, but this location is not up to par.  I won't be back."
Elle F.,"Riverview, FL",0,9,3,2.0,1/1/2018,"We were seated for two right when we walked in. Our server was prompt to provide us water. She came back in a few minutes to take our drink & appetizer order. After that, everything else was down hill. I ordered the Korean cauliflower bites, which were sponged in days old oil tastes like. You can stick your fork in it & see the oil surface from the outside bc it was so oily. Took two bites & couldn't finish the rest. My main course Evelyn's pasta had very very little sauce, the pasta wasn't fully cooked & tasted like it was under a heating lamp after waiting to be served. The vegetables of broccoli was a full small floret that weren't even cut down. The other side dishes we had was white rice & plantains & roasted  asparagus. The white rice was also still hard, the order of 6-8 asparagus I had were completely wilted & dry. The plantains were barely warm. The best things we had were our drinks sadly.  Most definitely the worst Cheesecake Factory we have ever been to as far as the food goes."
Amanda J.,"Washington, DC",1440,892,308,3.0,8/17/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard across the chain.  This one happens to be conveniently located on the orange line outside of D.C., which is a bonus. I come to the Cheesecake Factory once a year, for National Cheesecake day.  For $3.89, I get a nice slice of cheesecake, and I get to hang out with a friend.  This year, I went with one of my favorites, the fresh banana cream.  It's less sweet than most cheesecakes, and it has fruit so it's healthy, right?  I also grabbed a small plate to munch on, and it was the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks ($6).  It was a very rich grilled cheese cut up into four sticks, and it was good too.  Due to the richness, I would recommend splitting it, which we found to be perfect. Our server was abrupt, but I made it clear that we were just there for cheesecake.  I didn't want him to waste his time, but a little service is always nice. All in all, a pretty standard place."
Candis M.,"Alexandria, VA",182,93,76,3.0,9/27/2017,"Decent Cheesecake location. Most of the food and service is to be expected of the Cheesecake standard. I've been here about 5 times and of that 5 times, I had a not so fabulous experience about 2.5 times. One one occasion, my food didn't come out at all. My dining partners were 3/4 way done by the time my food came. This is with the manager on notice. Maybe it wasn't put in? Maybe the runners made a mistake? I'll never know. On two other occasions, I found my dishes to be under-salted. A bit bland actually... which is so not Cheesecake Factory. Also, Every time I've ordered Cheesecake from here, it's been excellent. I'll still continue to come to this location.. Like I said. It's a decent location and it's also closest to me."
Tasha D.,"Arlington, VA",0,20,54,4.0,12/29/2017,"I always enjoy my meals, drinks and dessert at the Cheesecake Factory. The staff at this location was so friendly. One of my most favorite dishes on their menu is Louisiana Chicken."
Theresa B.,"Virginia Square, Arlington, VA",487,301,435,5.0,7/30/2017,"REVIEW OF CHEESECAKE ONLY Ah, another place I only order from when drunk. To be clear, this is probably not a restaurant I would ever actually go to. My experience with this location has been limited to non-sober Postmates experiences only. That being said, they're named The Cheesecake Factory for a reason - it's because their cheesecake is phenomenal and they goddamn know it.  Cheesecakes I have tried:  ~ Fresh banana cream: perfect ~ Lemon meringue: perfect ~ Chocolate hazelnut crunch (with hot fudge): perfect ~ Godiva chocolate cheesecake: perfect ~ Tiramisu: perfect ~ Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple: perfect, although if I remember correctly, this is one of the highest in calories ~ Key lime: good ~ Mango key lime: kind of weird. It had an unpleasant gelatinous texture that cheesecake just shouldn't have. I still ate it, but it was definitely my least favorite. ~ Dutch apple caramel streusel: they've been out of this every time I've tried to order it so probably just don't bother. In summation, for cheesecake-based review only, I'm gonna have to go with a 5."
Qusai S.,"Calgary, Canada",24,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,I've eaten at this place twice and both times got violently ill a few hours later. Will never step foot in here again.
Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",87,285,302,3.0,2/12/2017,"I hate to say it but this is probably one of the worst Cheesecake Factory experiences I've ever had.... We got to the restaurant and there was no wait (wonderful)! I ordered coffee and was asked if I wanted cream... Of course! When the coffee was served, I was not given any sugar (no problem, I'll just ask)!  Asked for sugar and it literally took 5 minutes for it to be brought to the table. Keep in mind, the restaurant was no where close to being full.  My fiancé ordered pancakes, eggs with a little bit of cheese, bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  Again, barely anyone in the restaurant for Sunday brunch at this point. The person accidentally swapped the meal of my fiancé and another patron. Unfortunately she did not order cheese on his eggs and he did. Her meal was sent back and so was his. It took 5 minutes (literally) to bring his plate back out. There was a huge thick slice of cheese laying across his eggs. Mind you he asked for a little bit of cheese. They put his plate in the microwave so now his pancakes were hard on the ends (yuck).  If that wasn't bad enough.... There was a mix up with the cheese on the eggs, once that was corrected he was STILL waiting on his potatoes. By the time he received his meal in its entirety, I was all done eating.  Talk about a terrible dining expedience. Will not be revisiting this location."
Alison V.,"Springfield, VA",452,51,200,5.0,7/16/2017,"I am literally baffled by the sub-par reviews. What's not to like? The large portions? Oh; how I hate having leftovers that I can eat later! Just terrible! Consistency with the taste of the food; ugh, awful idea! An extensive menu; how dare you offer me choices!  I heart Cheesecake Factory; if it was closer, I would be quite overweight (and enjoying gaining each pound, lol).  Our service was great. We had a personable and attentive waitress.  She was responsive to our needs and didn't check in too much (which annoys me) and she wasn't absent either.  The bread - It is so good! We (my husband and I) prefer the brown bread smothered in oh so delicious butter. Can you say yum?!  We started off with the egg roll  sampler (avocado egg rolls, Tex Mex egg rolls, crispy Cuban egg rolls and firecracker salmon egg rolls). Aaaaagh! So good.  So good (also, too hungry), I forgot to take a picture! These were all very good, crispy with good dipping sauces.  We already talked about getting this again one day. Hahaha, I know we are already planning for future meals!  For my entree, I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano.  One word-Bodacious! I was going to say delicious, but I think I used that adjective earlier, lol.  I love this meal and the hearty portion. My husband got the Pasta Da Vinci.  Also, delicious and a must try.  If you are at the end of this review, I didn't do my job! You should be at Cheesecake Factory trying their food! Go NOW (unless it's closed, lol)!"
Kate F.,"San Jose, CA",2,206,13,4.0,7/31/2017,"I know this is a chain and we should not be visiting a chain while in such a great place, but sometimes you need a taste of home (sort of like Starbucks or McDonalds...) We found this Cheesecake as it is next to an awesome toy store. Visited twice this summer. Visit #1: Sunday evening, super slow service Visit #2: Monday lunch, sat on the patio, great service!! Food is standard and like all the rest. But sometimes it's nice to sit down and totally know what you are getting. Thank you Cheesecake Factory"
Jennifer V.,"Forked River, NJ",131,83,240,1.0,9/17/2017,"This review is based solely on customer service, not the food which we enjoy. We waited 40 minutes for our food. We were never checked on or updated in between. We waited over 15 minutes for our cheesecake. Mind you, it was not crowded at all. We told them it was my sisters birthday, they put a free birthday Sunday on our receipt and we never received it nor did they sing. We will never be returning to this location."
Sonya E.,"Charlotte, NC",298,53,53,3.0,1/31/2017,"The service at The Cheesecake Factory is always great, but the food is just good. Not bad, not great, just OK. My biggest issues are 1. The size of the menu is so overwhelming and 2. The food spreads across so many cuisines, I've never been able to find anything incredible on the menu.  My boyfriend and I had a couple gift cards so we came here for dinner recently and had a good experience. The waitress was quick to bring bread and fill up our waters. I ordered a Beet Salad (which was OK.... lacking in flavor) and the Tuna Tartare (which I enjoyed, but was a little on the salty side). We also shared the Fried Mac n Cheese bites which are really tasty and satisfy the little kid in me. Overall, it's a decent restaurant with decent food, just nothing to write home about."
Rick H.,"Peoria, AZ",5,49,163,4.0,6/4/2017,"I have always heard of the Cheesecake Factory but never been. I, of course, have heard about it on the big Bank Theory. I am traveling this week and there is a Cheesecake Factory within walking distance to my hotel. I had the Calamari for an appetizer. It was lightly breaded and fried to perfection, very tasty. My main course was a rib eye steak with veggies. the steak was cooked as ordered and tasty. The mashed potatoes were mashed with small chunks of potatoes, good, I enjoy a more rustic type of mashed potato, this is how I would have cooked them at home. I t also proves that they did not come out of a box. They also threatened me with broccli as the second veggie. The Lord protected me by having them bring out green beans instead. A great change.  It was a good first visit and I will be back."
Sam L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",17,182,158,3.0,12/4/2016,"Came in with a friend for a late lunch and were surprised there was no wait.  Our waitress was nice and got our drinks pretty fast and then took our orders. My friend ordered the orange chicken while I got the lunch pasta carbonara with chicken. My friend said the chicken was good though the portion looked small for it to be considered dinner. My food was good and the lunch portion was still big. I ate half and ended up getting the rest bagged to go. Our waitress was nice and checked in every once in a while and topped of our waters. Overall, it was a decent experience."
Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,301,594,3.0,9/26/2016,"I came here for lunch and ordered the crusted chicken Romano. It came with angel hair pasta and a light tomato sauce. I was not too impressed. The chicken lacked some flavor and there were a few pieces of undercooked pasta in my plate. I've been to other Cheesecake Factories before and have been very pleased when I ordered the chicken tostadas salad. This is why I usually just stick with what I know is good. They bring out white bread and pumpernickel bread which is addicting. I ate a little bit too much of that before my main dish. The chocolate cake for desert  was delicious, so no complaints there.  The waitress was on top of her game. She provided refills on my water regularly and refilled the bread frequently. I'm not too sure why they have so-called ""lunch specials"". There is nothing special about spending $17 on undercooked pasta and flavorless chicken. In addition, the presentation wasn't great. My chicken was hidden underneath the pasta. I give them 3 stars cause of my previous positive experiences, but they are going to have to take their game up to another level if they want to keep me as a customer."
Charlisha J.,"Baltimore, MD",158,10,15,5.0,11/16/2017,"Went here on a non formal date and service was spectacular. There was no wait coming in the door we were seated immediately. For our appetizer we chose the Dynamite Shrimp which i kinda confused for Bonefish Bang Bang Shrimp from the description. However it was just shrimp tempura with a remoulade sauce. It wasn't bad it just left a lot to desire a boring dish.  The fun part was our drinks my date chose the Strawberry Creamsicle which tasted like an island dream. My drink wasn't on the menu but I ask the bartender to whip me up a French Martini ( my grown up drink when I'm out) . He made down to a T. Our food was exquisite I received the Black Pepper shrimp and Chicken this comes with rice , black beans , plantains and spice pineapples. Everything was well seasoned and not over the top.My date received Chicken Jambalaya which was apparently a tasty choice too. Our server Michael did a wonderful job taking care of us last night and we might be back in for another dinner date night"
Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",105,590,510,4.0,1/11/2017,"I've dined here many times. The food and the service are always consistently good. The menus are extensive, and cater to a wide variety of tastes (vegetarian, low-cal, etc.), which makes this place great for groups. The cheesecake selection is almost overwhelming. There are easily about three dozen different types of cheesecake on the menu. Red Velvet and chocolate chip cookie dough are my two faves. Don't have time to dine in? No problem. You can get a slice to go. Street parking is scarce for this location, but fortunately there is a parking garage nearby."
Bradford S.,"Chantilly, VA",30,96,359,4.0,2/28/2017,"This is an excellent Cheesecake Factory.  They are always very attentive to what you want, and are good at making your order just the way you want it.  Obviously prices are very low, for very large portions, but that is true for all Cheesecake Factories.  Here the service is a level above most."
Yesenia M.,"Washington, DC",203,139,343,2.0,2/13/2017,"While I'm not a huge fan of the cheesecake factory I am a huge fan of nutella and definitely wanted to sample their hazelnut cheesecake.  The cheesecake was very good but the service was not, I asked for a coffee at the beginning of the meal and received it much later, in fact I thought they had forgotten it. The best part of the evening was probably when I ordered a margherita pizza and instead received a cocktail... Wouldn't you be suspicious if you ask somebody what they wanted to eat and they said a margarita? When the waitress brought me the margarita I explained that I wanted a margarita pizza and then she expressed that there was slight confusion part.  Despite admitting she suspected something was wrong with my order she still tried to blame me for the miscommunication."
AJ L.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Honestly, the worse customer service ever! First of all when we got there no tables were available. You can not maker resevations. My girlfriends and I went to the bar side. It took 20-25 min to even be acknowledged. I attempted to flag a waitress down who than rolled her eyes and walked towards me. I told her never mind and asked for the male waitress behind her. This was my 7 year anniversary where I had met my boyfriend (Cheesecake it MD). I was frustrated but then my boyfriend dropped down on one knee and proposed in front of the entire restaurant. After that we (the 13 of us) were seated a table. The waitress was better but obviously overwhelmed. Took a while to get any more drinks. We were not given any bread. Also, they were some how out of calamari. Food arrived a while later. I expected that but there were not that many people and all the food came sporadically leaving some ppl with food and others 10min later. It was OBVIOUSLY a special occasion. Not sure I would ever go back."
Cal H.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",117,149,142,5.0,7/4/2017,"I was here on 6-13-2017.  Our server was ""Darrius S.""  I met a colleague who was in town on assignment.  First off, the food and service were excellent.  Darrius was very attentive and met our expectations.  He was cordial but not intrusive.  We had parmesan garlic cheese bread, Factory nachos with chicken, crusted chicken Romano, side of broccoli, orange chicken with extra snow peas, lemonade and vanilla bean cheesecake.  That's a lot of food....and in fact so much that I had another complete meal the next day.  The food was flavorful, hot and prepared exactly to order.  Our drinks were kept full.  One suggestion:  turn on the lights!!  What's the deal with a dimly lit restaurant?  I needed to get a flashlight to read the menu.  However, I will be back.  The food was great and so was the service."
Alexis B.,"Alexandria, VA",137,16,4,5.0,10/11/2017,"Everything on this menu is legitimately delicious. I don't know how they do it, along with providing superb customer service! The following are what I love ordering: Thai Lettuce Wraps, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Farfalle With Chicken Roasted Garlic, Orange Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Spring Rolls, the list goes on. The Cheesecake dessert menu is extensive, and I have made it a point to try a different one, every time I go. Love, love, love this place, it's amazing. You typically expect to wait at a Cheesecake Factory during their peak dining hours, but I can honestly say I've never had to wait more than 25 minutes for them to seat me."
Nicole J.,"Austin, TX",395,64,12,4.0,5/9/2017,Pretty standard to the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to. The only thing was that our server abandoned us for a while and we had to ask for a new one. The omelets are loaded with ingredients so that was good. You can tell the eggs Benedict sauce isn't homemade and probably came from a bag but you're going to a chain so what can you expect. Overall I would recommend for a causal meal.
Keiko M.,"Yokohama, Japan",1136,1334,21351,3.0,2/22/2016,First time to check out Cheesecake Factory!!!!! The upper decoration is like a museum. Taste: Not bad. Ahi tuna looks and tastes good. It's hard to tell the freshness with the sauce tho. Crab bites are greasier than the look. Fried shrimp  skin is crispy but does not taste pure shrimp taste much. Salmon with Thai sauce and coconut risotto are delicious. Steak is not that good. Mush potato is good. Godiva cheese cake is fantastic! Price: Good. Appetizers around $10 and main dishes around $20. Customer service: Not good. Slower... Interior: Look up! The ceiling is like a museum. Gorgeousish. Parking: Street or garages. Super packed with couples and families on Sun.
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,3/5/2017,"For decades I've always wondered how a place like to Cheesecake Factory doesn't get at least four stars from everybody. The service is much better than any other chain of its size and there's enough options on the menu to satisfy everyone. As a matter of fact having been to dozens of their locations in the last 20 years I've never had a bad meal or a meal that doesn't come out perfect. The food here is far better than average and the portions are enough for a cow to be full. Sure the menu is so large it can be almost impossible to find something that you absolutely want because there's too many things that you want but why would one complain about that? What's amazing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they're able to do a good job on hundreds of different dishes. Most chains struggle to even do just a few things well yet at the Cheesecake Factory there's nothing that they don't do well. And for those of you that are complaining about the price let's be real. This food is priced more than fair and is actually price with a lot of value. With quality ingredients and massive portions you're getting a deal. Even just there tropical tea is worth coming for or the free bread they bring to your table. But this place is far more than that. I can think of dozens of dishes that are phenomenal. And while their gumbo may not taste like it doesn't Louisiana it's way better then your traditional chain food. Any of their sandwiches, pasta dishes, fish and massive salads are all very good. There's no point me listing exactly what I eat because you're going to spend 15 minutes just looking at the menu and coming up with 10 options that you want all on your own. Just remember not to be so hard on your reviews here the quality is much better than people give it credit for."
Brian B.,"Washington, DC",129,192,190,3.0,2/11/2017,"I had never been to Cheesecake Factory but I decided that it was time. Speaking of time, the popularity and subsequent wait for this restaurant is unfuckingbelievable. 40 min for a table. Hot damn. All to read a novel of a menu and eat a straight-from-the-glass-case cheesecake that you could get at a bakery or wherever one would get a good cheesecake probably a bakery. I honestly cannot believe the hype. People are taking their straight GF here for V-day and I'm here with fuckin Scott who orders the chipotle pasta and doesn't finish it. Jesus H Christ. That all being said, the portions are generous and the bread is free and the waiters want you to be fat and happy and middle America loves it. Amber waves of Grain."
Nick B.,"Potomac, MD",126,39,56,4.0,9/2/2016,"Met up with some new friends for dinner and this place had plenty of seating and the service was great!  If you're okay having fish, do yourself a favor and eat the Miso Salmon!!!! It's sooo tasty and very pleasing! Oh and sangria here is also delicious."
Taylor B.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,1,,3.0,12/3/2017,The food was great. But our server didn't show us the best experience at all. The server greeted us after 7 minutes of us sitting at the table. Then it took her almost 15 minutes for bread. She intended to her other tables and catered to them more than us. She never checked up on us. Only to her other tables. It took her forever to bring our drinks. I was just really disappointed. I have came here before and got good experience but this time it was awful.
Hwal L.,"Roanoke, VA",24,415,1142,4.0,3/15/2016,"When it comes to The Cheesecake Factory, it's all about the sweet corn tamale cakes for me. I don't even bother to look at the menu anymore, D or other companions can handle the novel-size menu.  This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant outside of Florida, and it was well worth the trek. Saturday evening, it was pretty packed, and we were told a wait time of 15 minutes, so grabbed a buzzer and sat on the bench.  We were seated right when they said we would, and stuck right in. The bread rolls were 2/5 for me, because although the sour dough bread looked homemade and would have been a lot nicer freshly baked, but the crust was way too stiff by the time it was brought to us, and it almost broke my jaw. I miss the honey oats rolls from the other location in Florida we used to go to.  FOOD  The main game, the tamale cakes, were on point, and it was then that I realised how much brighter it was inside this location than I was used to, because I could actually see the colours of each ingredient on the plate! The heartiness of tamale cakes, tang of salsa, fresh avocados, sour cream, and an unknown sauce all make for an awesome treat, everytime.  Service was reasonably quick and friendly, and I appreciated that the service staff didn't give us attitude when we ordered an appetiser only.  GRIEVANCE Before we decided to go in, we thought to check the menu posted outside the building to the right of the front door, but couldn't stand there for more than a couple second because of the cigarette smoke from the rubbish bin which was underneath the menu frame. An awful location for the menu -or for the bin-!! Otherwise, this is apparently the only Cheesecake Factory around here, and I'd definitely be back!"
BellaB L.,"Suitland, MD",2,60,26,2.0,9/2/2017,"The level of service has really gone down here.  My last three visits I've had to wait 30 minutes for food only to receive it cold.  Spoke to the manager each occasion,  this darkskinned bald head gentleman doesn't seem to care at all. Looks like I'll b traveling to Arundel mills from now on."
Vishnu J.,"Arlington, VA",113,19,,4.0,9/6/2017,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but I've always had a good time at The Cheesecake Factory. Whether I am in NY, VA, or MD,  the service is good, the portions are decent, and the food is good. This spot has a patio."
Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",814,1667,23046,4.0,12/8/2015,"This used to be my go to Cheesecake Factory when I lived in Rosslyn. Came here recently with family and we all enjoyed ourselves. I love that their menu is huge and there is something for everyone. Service was quick, attentive, and friendly. Our food came out in a timely manner. We all had plenty of leftovers. Their portions are huge. Don't forget to end your meal with one of their delicious cheesecakes!"
Detri W.,"Suitland, MD",1,41,9,1.0,5/10/2017,This will be my last visit. I prefer restaurant's in Washington DC because of the professional service and the cleanliness of the restaurant's. Also the manager's are eager to please their patrons.
Amy P.,"Alexandria, VA",26,177,3,4.0,3/7/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a solid choice and I've been let down by the food. The hostesses are friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. Oh, and the mojitos are the best and the food portions are large. A good go-to if you are unsure and want decently priced food."
Kerry C.,"Middletown, CT",23,78,10,5.0,2/21/2017,"We were visiting family in Reston and we decided to check out Cheesecake in Clarendon on our last night there. We've been to multiple Cheesecake locations in CT and we were excited to find one close to our Rosslyn hotel. We went on a Monday night around 730/8 and we waited 15 minutes for a table.  Our waiter's name was Darius and he was very friendly. You could tell it had been a busy night for the staff because he apologized for the wait and if he seemed stressed.  There was definitely a longer-than-usual wait for drinks, bread, and food to be delivered. But that's something I completely looked past because our waiter, Darius, was so friendly and conversational. That's why this is a five-star rating. After all, we were on vacation and I didn't want to be rushed anyway!"

Jasmine P.,"Fort Washington, MD",4,10,24,3.0,7/26/2016,"I'm a regular at the Cheesecake Factory by it was my first time at this one. As usual the menu is so overwhelming with the sheer amount of items that I tried to stick with what I know. So my appetizer was FireCracker Salmon. Always good, too bad you only get four on the plate. The wrapping was crisp and the sauce was tasty.  For dinner I their Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and I added chicken (it doesn't change the price). I thought from the name it would be spicy but it was actually VERY SWEET. the sweet sauce mixed with a mango salsa and plantains was just too much sweet for me, I'm much more of a spicy person. But it was presented well. The location was good but parking is a headache so that would steer me from going here again. A bunch of street parking with meters or overpriced parking garages. Our server was good if not a little loud at times, leaning down to yell directly in my ear and the decor was the usual, dark, dark, dark. But we were seated quickly!! Within three minutes at a booth at 7pm on a weekend!! Everyone else that came in was seated within minutes as well. If you are looking for the usual dining experience, go here."
