Nina K.,"Arlington, VA",11,4,,2.0,3/2/2016,"My family and I had dinner at the Arlington, VA location. My partner is blind and uses a guide dog. He let the hostess know that he needed a table to accommodate 4 people plus a service dog and a baby. He waited for twenty min. Once our time was up we were notified a table was available and continued to wait fifteen more min. After that we were led to a table that was not big enough and led back to the front where the hostess said ""oh I didn't know that you had that many people!"" We waited for ten more min. in which I asked for the supervisor duty. As soon as I asked for that we were led to a bigger table in an empty area. After that a couple was seated next to us and my partner was asked to move his dog. He moved his dog and the harness under the table we were sitting at. The waitress servicing our table stepped on the dogs tail not once but twice. Out waiter was very nice but I noticed that he didn't offer a braille menu which is advertised on your website.  This was our first dining experience since having our baby and guide dog out with us. Not a very good experience to the point my partner said that we may need to order our food to go or just not dine there anymore which is disappointing because it's one of our favorite places and Cheesecake Factory advertises how they accommodate with braille menus and they offer high chairs, and welcome service animals....yet they don't seem to have the room for such, and we were not offered any of those things"
Lucia C.,"Arlington, VA",72,4,,1.0,5/24/2015,"The hostesses didn't greet us at all but the server was delightful. It's pretty overpriced, considering the chicken Bellagio made me sick."
Andre Y.,"Arlington, VA",27,6,,5.0,4/16/2015,Hansel was great waiter!!! Good Service and recommendations.  Courses were perfect.
Drew S.,"Alexandria, VA",25,173,5,1.0,3/4/2013,"Gee...that's funny, I could have sworn the entree I ordered was supposed to have chicken in it. --Pulls out my pocket sized Cheesecake Factory Manual/Menu-- Yep!  here it is, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic.  Goodness, it even has the word 'Chicken' in the title.  Weird... The same with Garlic Noodles, even though the word 'Chicken' isn't in the title, the description does mention it.   Funny...I guess the servers just thought that I was observing Lent and omitted these key ingredients on my behalf.  Thank you Cheesecake people! I don't know why my dad likes this place so much.  But it's moments like this when the folks here can't remember a key ingredient that I'm going to insist we have dinner over at Crystal City Restaurant and won't mind it when they get an order so wrong."
Jeleesa F.,"Washington, DC",65,15,,5.0,8/5/2013,OMG OMG OMG THEY HAVE FRIED MAC AND CHEESE........(Remebers to breath) I love this place. The food is great and guess what....they have a $5 dollar happy hour menu! And it is not a small menu at that. All drinks and plates on that Menu are only $5 dollars although as with most places you have to sit in the bar area to partake which is fine by me! The bar tender was so great and friendly. I this was the best happy hour place I feel like so far!
Casey W.,"New York, NY",536,565,36,3.0,6/19/2011,"- comically large restaurant, menu, and food portions - people must come here just for dessert because I can't imagine finishing a meal and still having room for dessert - came here with a large party (8+ people), server was competent and friendly, got everything right - all of the food was good but not great, everyone got takeaway boxes. . . I will say that the food reheated around 4am when we got back from the bars was a godsend and tasted far better than everyone remembered it being at the restaurant - my steak entree came with a MOUNTAIN of mashed potatoes, I felt the need to emphasize because it actually became an ongoing joke for the rest of the weekend  - avoid the mojitos, they are unreasonably sweet to the point of almost being undrinkable"
Hugh H.,"Alexandria, VA",18,77,2,4.0,8/27/2012,"The food was really good and the service was great. Brittany was our server and it was her first night, she was wonderful and considerate I would have thought she worked there for years with how well she treated us and how well she presented the food.  The menu was very busy and overwhelming."
Sky H.,"Alexandria, VA",0,10,1,5.0,1/6/2015,Went there for my first time this past weekend. Great service and food was delicious! (Will be returning)
Yuan Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,50,22,3.0,1/19/2015,"Took me a loooooong way to get there! I like the environment there. And the cake is good, but not as perfect as I aspect."
Gregorio D.,"New York, NY",236,21,1,3.0,5/11/2014,"Came here on Mother's Day with a few other family members and the experience was great! Our waitress ""Zeta"" was amazing: she was very attentive and paid attention to every detail. The food was lackluster at best. I ordered the ""Steak Diane & shrimp scampi combo"". It was just underwhelming. The food was Lukewarm and under seasoned. It wasn't the worst but I'll definitely think twice before going back."
Joshua W.,"Arlington, VA",33,76,30,4.0,4/13/2013,"Normally I steer clear of national franchise food, but in the case of Cheesecake Factory I am glad to have made an exception. The atmosphere is a bit overwhelming and the meal is VERY fast paced, but this is pretty standard for a national chain and the surprising food quality makes is a very good option for a family outing. It feels like the floor is full of more servers, managers, bussers, hosts, and hostesses then customers. For the amount of people running around the dining room you would think the service would be spectacular, but there are some small refinements that could help improve it. Clearing plates, checking in on empty drinks, and double checking in on the food would bring the service up to 5 star, but for now I'll leave it at three. The food both times was really amazing. Shepard's pie and skinny burger were particularly good. Of course the cheesecake is great too. We ordered a Reeces cheesecake to go and between the whipped cream and the slice a full sized to-go container was brimming with delicious sugary carbs!  There are a lot more places to try in Arlington, but when you have a big group of picky eaters, kids, or when you just want consistency and good food you will probably get it all at Cheesecake Factory."
Samantha H.,"Springfield, MO",0,1,,1.0,12/13/2014,"We called one week before a birthday party to make a dinner reservation for 15. We were told reservations were not taken on Saturday, but we ""should be fine"". Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were told there was a wait, but it would be ""soon"". They would not give us a time estimate. Over the course of an hour, we asked three more times for a time estimate, and were repeatedly told ""soon"". The last time, the hostess said ""check back in 15-20 minutes"". When we walked away to continue waiting, the hostess started complaining to her colleague how annoying we were, within earshot. We were extremely disappointed with our service and the fact that we were treated as completely dispensable. We will never come to this location again."
Bethany H.,"Washington, DC",16,62,12,5.0,8/9/2014,I could be the one Asian on earth to LOVE the cheesecake factory.  The burgers are my favorite. Try them!
Angel W.,"Arlington, VA",908,399,191,2.0,12/10/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is simply miserable! I stopped frequenting the CF over a year ago when they pulled their veggie burger from the menu, but lo and behold they brought it back, or so I thought! Their new version is absolutely disgusting! If you do a search on the internet for best veggie burger ever, you will see that the CF wins in that category and that many patrons were sad to see the veggie burger yanked from the menu. So, if the CF brought it back, why not bring it back in its original form? The new veggie burger tastes like a sour, rotten something or other. I swear I almost started crying b/c it was so gross! Their fries are despicable too. Completely flavorless.  You know what else makes this place so miserable? The wait times!  The wait times are super long and there is ALWAYS a wait, no matter what time you arrive. And the people waiting (including myself) look so unhappy. Everyone is just staring at the wall and no one is really talking to the people they brought with them. Everyone looks like they are waiting for their lives to pass them by in a jail cell. There is also nowhere to stand so you constantly get bumped out of the way. The whole experience is uncomfortable.  I am done with this place!"
Rabi J.,"Waldorf, MD",17,51,3,5.0,12/16/2012,"I went there the other day with my friends. We had one of the BEST waiters I have ever had ( unfortunately I can't remember his name, Daniel or Damian). He took time explaining the long menu, we never has to look for him, he was always checking on us. The dishes he suggested were all great ( chipotle pasta, jambalaya pasta, and bang bang shrimp dish) he even gave is complimentary coffee ( don't know if that's new for cheesecake).  I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but he made our visit extra nice!!"
Brian B.,"San Francisco, CA",368,177,542,3.0,11/10/2011,"Let me see: The Cheesecake Factory, in it's simplest form, is a restaurant that consistently gives it patrons large portions. It's kind of their thing. Just about every patron leaves with one of their unmistakable doggy bag in tow, and I think that's a point. If I were preparing for high school homecoming or prom and needed a venue for a the dinner date, I imagine a restaurant like Olive Garden or The Cheesecake Factory would work its way onto my shortlist. It's that type of restaurant. And that's not necessarily a bad thing (even though I many years removed from my former high school self). With a storied franchise operation like this, the dining experience has more to do with the talents and attention of ones waiter, more than the cookie-cutter ambiance and menu. That said, I've had a varied experience at this location, never stellar. I can't help like feeling like the wait staff's coverage is spread a bit too thin over the restaurant's tables. But that's an easy quibble. Because when the food finally comes, there's usually a lot of it, and at a respectable price point."
Maxfactor C.,"Laurel, MD",14,50,,2.0,11/8/2013,"This was the worse Cheesecake factory I've been to in this area.  I was part of a large group (25 or more) and paying was a nightmare.  We made reservations and no one ever mentioned that they didn't allow individual payment.  After talking to the manager he said we could but that we would have to figure it out on our own.  I thought that was so shady and lazy on their part.  We spent over 1000 bucks at this place and that the best they could do?  Also, service was slow at best.  Several times we had to actually get up and go find our waiters....The food was mediocre at best so I won't return."
M G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Usually this is my go-to Cheesecake Factory bc the one in Tyson's Corner sucks, but tonight they are getting 1 star. Mainly for an arrogant, rude, obnoxious bartender. I don't expect to be given a hard time about something simple. ESPECIALLY when I'm paying $12 a drink!! (Didn't know it was that expensive there!) So Im out with an old friend I haven't seen in forever and we're in a great mood. I go to order a drink from the bar but I ask the bartender (Tania b. - who's awesome btw) if she can make the drink less sweet than the way it normally comes. (it's a common practice for cocktails to have a flavored corn syrup added.) Well this cocky obnoxious tall brown-head guy (I wish I would've heard his name once so I could mention it) standing next to her makes a huge scene and starts mocking me like oh u want it less sweet?! What do u think this is?!! KFC??!! Hahahhahha!! And goes on and on with HIMSELF... Well first, that just instantly dampened our mood having the bartender jeering me for such a simple request...like wow. Excuse meeeee. That must have been way too much to ask!  FYI, it could be the taste people don't like of too sweet, it could be insulin or glucose issues, or it could be u simply don't want to drink corn syrup if u don't have to. Anyway, u never know what's going on with the guest and mocking them is definitely not getting u ""cute, funny"" points. So I'm thinking this arrogant jerk, it's really not that difficult to hold extra syrup that you're about to pump into a drink, and second, I'm pretty sure he was referring to a slogan like ""have it your way"" from Burger King or something, but he said KFC. LOL So whatever he said didn't make sense. To makes matters worse, idk why he made our first round of drinks for Tania, but he did and they were horrible!! I think he overloaded both drinks with sweet to spite us.  I didn't say anything bc I don't like to complain and I was trying to enjoy time with my friend, but on our second round of drinks my friend actually commented the second round was MUCH better (same drink) than our first. I completely agreed, just didn't say anything in the beginning to further dampen our mood since it got off to a rough start with that guy bartender. If I wouldn't have been preoccupied with my friend trying to catch up after so long, I would've said something to management about the shit drink and the obnoxious bartender!!! Lucky him. If you don't know how to interact with your guests, GET OUT of the service industry! And, if I would have caught your name, I'd so put you on blast on Yelp!!  Other than that..good food. Great service Tania b.!! And, other guy at the bar, shorter, blondish brown hair with goatee, awesome job on the drinks! (Round #2)"
Ross M.,"Fairfax, VA",47,540,12,3.0,11/18/2012,"I really hate the cheesecake factory. It takes forever. You have to wait ever after you waited and turned in your buzzer. Buzz me when my table is ready, not when the busboy hasn't gotten to it yet. All the food is mediocre. The tables always seem too close to each other so we're right on top of other annoying people. The entrees are obscenely huge and filled with thousands of calories. And anyone who still has room for cheesecake after an appetizer and entree is probably overweight and has or is soon to get diabetes.  But, it remains a good meeting spot for large groups of people with different tastes, and doesn't seem to care how long you linger around even late hours. And of course the best appetizer is there - the buffalo blasts. One time they said they ran out of them, so we left! I usually stick with something safe and simple like the spicy crispy sandwich. Fills me up, then gives me stomach cramps. Delicious."
Courtney L.,"Bowie, MD",14,70,37,4.0,1/25/2014,Had a great time at Happy Hour with friends! Th drinks and appetizers were great. Good customer service. I will return.
