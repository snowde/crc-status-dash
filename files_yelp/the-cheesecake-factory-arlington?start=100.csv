Andrew D.,"Vienna, VA",107,155,353,4.0,2/14/2015,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times but I've never actually sat at the table . I've always sat near the bar and enjoy a couple of drinks with some appetizer. The service has always been pleasant , the wait staff are attentive and friendly.  On my last visit I actually ended up sitting on a booth with a couple of friends and dinner was satisfying and was very enjoyable. I'm a big fan of pasta , so I've tried a few of their pasta here and it was never disappointing.  Last night's garlic pasta with shrimp was equally as yummy. I can't say my friends would have agreed with me especially with the garlic breath that came with it.  Just remember to bring a gum if you are going to have this and never order this if you are here on a date. They have a huge menu here and you can find everything from burgers , salad to pastas and steaks. The best thing of all , not only they have different kind of food but have different variety of it as well. They have like 10 over different kinds of burgers.  It's really hard to pick out what you want to eat at times. Since it can get a little over whelming with the large selection. They give a very generous portion here, which I tend to finish because I like pig out. Most of the friends that I've been here always end up bringing some home. You must have some sort of game plan when you come to  Cheesecake Factory. Take it easy on the appetizer and entree , so you can actually have room for CHEESECAKE ! I mean this is what they are famous for so you should at least share a dessert with someone. They have plenty of variety of Cheesecake for everyone. My favorite currently would be the red velvet cheese cake. Oh lord ! I can tell you for sure , food coma. Every single time."
Justin S.,"Arlington, VA",19,37,21,5.0,6/23/2016,"The only reason this Cheesecake Factory gets a five start rating is because of our waiter Taylor!  My wife and I have been here and our experience has been average, however, when we do come to the Cheesecake Factory in Clarendon, we always ask for Taylor.  He is very warm and welcoming, he always gets our order right, our food comes out on time, he always notices when our drinks are low, and so much more.  When you come here, just ask for Taylor, and you won't be disappointed."
John S.,"Falls Church, VA",9,341,26,4.0,8/6/2016,"Still a solid choice for lunch or dinner in Clarendon, and not much of a wait anymore.  I'm guessing with all the competition for restaurants in the area that Cheesecake Factory may be on the decline.  Food was good and the service was friendly.  The place was deserted on a Saturday afternoon, quite unusual for this chain."
Renee H.,"Suitland, MD",0,71,,4.0,9/22/2016,"It has taken some time for me to like the Cheesecake Factory because the menu selection is so huge they cannot prepare them all well and I was always disappointed.  Now I have my favorites, miso salmon, fish and fries, and buffalo wings. With the exception of one bad incident with my miso salmon, those three dishes are always on point. I've dined at the Arlington VA location in the past and had good experiences with the food, service, and ambiance. My most recent dining experience was the same except for dessert.  I ordered carrot cake to go.  When I went to eat the cake later, the whip cream that was placed beside it did not travel well and made the cake soggy in places. Word to the wise, when ordering dessert to go, ask for any toppings to be placed in separate container.  I never had a problem with the desserts in the past and that is probably because I always order cheesecake. Parking is a monster at this location, but there is one garage diagonal to restaurant that will discount parking by 50% when your ticket is validated at the the restaurant."
Donnell K.,"Washington, DC",90,11,1,1.0,6/22/2016,Good was old and cool when brought to table. Bathrooms were dirty. Not coming back to this place !!
Phoenix Simone W.,"Arlington, VA",426,297,509,4.0,1/5/2015,"I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory in general, and this one hits the mark. And I don't even like cheesecake. It's the perfect place for large groups of people because there's something for everyone. Seriously,  the menu is like 30 pages long.  The one issue with having so many options is that they can't perfect them all. But they do a pretty good job,  I have yet to have a meal I didn't enjoy.  It's tricky to get a table, especially in this one so I would suggest getting there early as they don't take reservations!"
Mary Kate A.,"Washington, DC",2707,1807,9419,4.0,1/23/2013,"Oh mama mama. I always love me some Cheesecake Factory. I like to come here when I want to feed my cheesecake fetish which is exactly what spiked this visit. I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake based from the recommendation of my server. I was torn between that and the terimasu cheesecake. I am certainly happy with the outcome of my dessert for sure. The cheesecake was light, had tons of sinful whipped cream, and mind blowing with how good it was. I am salivating thinking about it right now. Goodness! My server was very sweet and really paid close attention to me. Not a beat missed. Good service with a good dessert.  They live up to their namesake. You should go see what I mean."
Y B.,"Arlington, VA",4,22,21,5.0,6/18/2016,Good service. We go there every month and so far all servers were nice. The waiters will also help you get any drink or altered variant of the dish to make your experience good. Keep up the good work!
Todd P.,"Arlington, VA",31,431,552,4.0,12/1/2015,"Slightly above average prices with large portion sizes to match. Over the years we've only had one or two bad experiences here, overall the service is pretty good and the food has been better than average as well. It's not obvious on the menu, but you can ask for half portions of most of the entrees at a lower cost and the lunch menu is very reasonable. Particularly fond of the ""tropical iced tea"" which is fruity without being sugary sweet. Also like the wide range of entree salad options for those times you need your greens. The cheesecakes are obviously one of the main attractions and generally enough to split after a large meal."
Paul D.,"Sterling, VA",105,259,148,4.0,1/27/2016,They have an amazing menu that offers something for everyone.  The prices are reasonable for way to get and use of this service is top notch.  We enjoyed their chicken with biscuits and the Renee's special.  Juz have fresh sourdough bread or oat bread in most of time it's fresh.
Badrea G.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,2,,1.0,3/10/2017,"I have NEVER had such a negative experience at a restaurant!!Today at noon, i called the restaurant to inquire about eating in. My friend and I only have one hour to eat our lunch, and return to work. This doesnt include travel time, and seating/pick up time. I asked the hostess(-who did not introduce herself- on the phone if i would be able to place my order and have the kitchen make it ready at 1 PM for us to sit down and eat. The person on the phone said no. I then asked how long it usually takes for food to be prepared and brought out. She said about 20 minutes. With a travel time of about 5-10 minutes, this would not work for me. So I then asked if I could order for takeout, then sit down to enjoy our food. She said yes, then transferred me to someone who could take my order. Mina answered the phone. let me just establish the fact that she did not introduce herself at this time either. I did not know it was Mina that i was speaking to until a later time. At the beginning of the call I said 'Hi, how are you? I'd like to place an order for pickup, but i will be eating in the restaurant."" She said Ok, then proceded to take my order. Fast forward one hour, after a 5 minute wait to be directed to the-not labelled- pick up area, I grab my food and proced to look for seating. One of the hostess then tells me ""you guys can sit at the bar'. I tell her that we would like to sit at a booth, we choose the booth and ask for them to please wipe it down, and that we would be ordering more food and drinks, as well as tipping our server. After a 10 minute wait at the front of the restaurant, with both hostesses throwing us nasty looks and whispering to each other-they stopped as soon as they saw us looking at them-, they finally clean off the booth-after assisting about 3 other walk-ins, like we werent a priority-, and we then sit down, open our food, and begin to eat-with no drinks. No server appears, so I turn to a busboy-who was cleaning a table behind us- and ask him to please send a server over. He says OK and dissappears. Let me just establish that at this point, we were already very irritated at the service we were receiving, but were willing to give whoever our server was a chance to redeem.About 5 minutes later, Mina then comes over and says 'You guys can sit at the bar. I have customers that are waiting to sit down.' My friend asks her 'You want us to pack up our food, and move to the bar?""  We ordered a Pizza, a salad, 3 slices of cheesecake, a grilled salmon, and the avocado eggrolls. ALL of this food was spread out on the table open as we were eating. Mina responds with 'Yes, I dont want to argue with you, I have customers waiting to sit down"". As Mina would not let me speak, I then ask her(this is when I finally find out her name) ""What is your name?"", She responds with ""Mina"". I then say: ""Mina, I'm not going to argue with you either. we called and inquired about this situation and were given the clear 3 times, including by you. We only have 40 more minutes to enjoy our lunch, we are waiting for the server so we can order more, we will tip, and we are not about to pack up all this food and move clear across the restaruant."" She is adamant about us moving, tries to deny the fact that I told her over the phone that we would be eating in, and my friend is starting to get very annoyed. He cuts the ""argument"" short and says, ""forget it, I'm not even gonna talk to you rignt now, i'm leaving."" we then tell Mina: ""If we cant sit here, then were going to leave. I'd like a refund for the food."" My friend couldnt even bear to be in the restaurant and goes to stand outside in 30 degree weather with only a cardigan on, while I receive my refund. We then leave. As if everything that just happened wasnt a HUGE injustice to us, the fact that the workers couldnt even identify themselves, couldnt even crack a smile, were throwing us nasty looks like we had not just spent about $70 on our existing food and were going to spend even more AS WELL as tipping our server, and we were treated like trash by someone who as of yet hadnt even established whether she is a manager or not, we had to waste an additional $15 on the ubers we ordered to get there and back to work!I have NEVER been treated so poorly in an establishment in my entire life."
Alan M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,185,,4.0,1/14/2017,"It's a Cheesecake Factory.  What more can I say?  Food was pretty good, service was fine.  We ate here twice during a few-days visit to DC because it was adjacent to our hotel.  Chain restaurant but pretty good food."
Kim C.,"H Street Corridor/Atlas District/Near Northeast, Washington, DC",142,104,94,3.0,8/13/2015,"Is it weird I had never been to Cheesecake factory before now?  I had a gift card, so the bf and I decided to try it. There was no wait and the patio was filled, so we opted for inside. I was really overwhelmed by the menu.  For apps, we ordered calamari and nachos. I you couldn't really mess up nachos, but the chips were the most stale things I've ever had. The the spicy chicken on them was very good though, but they need to add more chicken on them.  The calamari was pretty standard and on par with Olive Garden and other chains. The portions are humongous!!  I filled up on apps and only ate a fifth of my entree! At least I'll have leftovers for lunch! Dessert, dessert, dessert. The main reason I went to Cheesecake Factory. Once again, I was overwhelmed by various options. All the cheesecakes sounded delicious! How do you only pick one?! Salty caramel cheesecake to go, please. Seriously, could not eat one bite after those entrees and apps!  We enjoyed ours later that night. Yum yum yum."
Alex S.,"Springfield, VA",18,11,,1.0,4/15/2016,"This location is terrible! Bread side table basket was extremely cold. I ordered the crab cake sandwich, menu states served with lettuce and tomatoes with a side of fries. The sandwich came out under cooked literally center was cold and extremely slimy... And it was actually served with cabbage not lettuce. The fries were over cooked crisp which had barely any potato center. Worst part was the manger never visited our table to offer me an apology or ask me if I would like a different meal. Avoid this location if you can. Karim was our server, his service was mediocre, nothing positive to say about him. I ended up calling the General Mgr. of the restuarant (Abe Jallow) which offered me a $10 gift card to return.... As a GM a $10 gift card won't make me come back to your location. The crab cake sandwich cost $14.95 do the math. As GM you definitely need more training to run an establishment like The Cheesecake Factory. Hopefully you or any other MOD visits the guest tables more frequently, especially during your slow business hours."
Nabil A.,"Arlington, VA",89,1,,2.0,2/26/2016,"Waiter was rude to us, our cards were declined when we had money in them forcing us to walk out to an ATM, and we were missing a dollar from our change. If the customer  service wasn't so bad I would come back"
Sonia P.,"Washington, DC",148,187,997,4.0,10/15/2015,"Always good food and good times at this place. While their menu reminded me of an encyclopedia, the food are delicious and they have tons of variety to accommodate different diets. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta (bow tie pasta with pepper,onion n mushroom) and it was seasoned right. Hubby got the miso salmon (with brown rice, peas n miso), the fish was really soft and delicious. We got the oreo n smores cheesecakes, and its to die for. We only ate half of our entrees and save the other halves for lunch. Their lunch menu (served til 4pm) is already big, imagine the dinner portion."
Mark R.,"Fairfax, VA",37,47,1,2.0,10/10/2016,"I've been here a few times, but the last time I was there left me with mixed feelings. Let's start off with our waiter: Ricky. Also, affectionately known as: ""Pineapple Head."" He is awesome! Pleasant, attentive, and doesn't smother you with attention either. We ordered a chicken pasta dish (can't remember the name) along with the loaded potato soup, and the avocado egg-rolls. They were all great. I was feeling adventurous so I decided to get the Hibachi steak which looked good and felt tender enough... but there was something totally off about it. I thought I was just full and took the rest home. I had some awful stomach aches after dinner that night. The next morning when we tried to have it... it also smelled a little off. Basically, we had been given bad meat :("
Noneofya B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,73,23,1.0,3/2/2016,Just to think; this nice corporate restaurant was trust worthy! Ha! Wrong idea!!  Well one Wednesday evening my friends and I came in for happy hour/ dinner in which it was raining cats and dogs out! We had umbrellas to save us from the rain. Well....we arrived at the hostess with smiling faces asking for umberellas covers so water wouldn't get all over the floor the young lady shareese insisted that out our items in coat check (safe but not so safe area) well..after we gave her the items we sat down and dined it came time to leave as we approached the stand asking for our umberella only one was there?? The question was where was the umberella; well after a little investigating we found out the employee of this location stole the umbrella!! After hounding the management that the item was gone they called Sharesse and she lied and said it was there!! It wasn't well the next day Dave the GM called me and said he would have it when I got there we I live an hour away so I know that would take me way out the way; well I got there he had the nerve to offer me 50.00???? In cheesecake gift card? I'm sorry that wasn't enough. I'm waiting to hear back from upper management.  BE CAREFUL!! This location is full of thieves as I have read that people had their credit card info stolen and the stuff told me themselves staff have stolen wallets.  Let's be real save your self from the Thieving Cheesecake Spot!!
Katie A.,"Arlington, VA",16,14,,4.0,7/21/2016,"Good food and service. Huge portions!! Had the summer shrimp rolls... FYI they come cold for anyone who wouldn't know that like me but still good. The calamari was very very good, melt in the mouth. And good bread."
Alice M.,"Arlington, VA",5,26,5,1.0,6/12/2015,"Very Very Disappointed. I really liked Godiva Cheesecake and since have guests tomorrow decided to stop by and get a whole one.   They told me that it will be frozen that requires 2-3 hours to defrost. I guess that is fine I said.   I couldn't stop wondering and said, the ones you have over here are fresh, right? NO was the response ... I paused for a couple of seconds and replied .........  I thought you served fresh Cheesecake.  While looking at me like I am crazy she said NO we defrost them as well.  Aaaaha! Thank you  No more frozen cheesecake for me."
