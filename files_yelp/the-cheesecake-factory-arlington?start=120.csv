Stephanie J.,"Burke, VA",234,393,246,2.0,3/2/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect reason that I avoid chain restaurants. The lines to be seated are long, the food is mediocre and the service is meh. We stopped in for coffee and dessert after a 15 minute wait for a table. We were escorted to a table in the back of the restaurant behind a server station. This station was loud and served as a central place for the server's to congregate and socialize. Needless to say it was very loud. Our server was inattentive. In fact, it took over 10 minutes before he welcomed us and asked for our drink order. He was also slow with the drink order delivery.    The menu is expansive and they offered 20+ cheesecakes PLUS other desserts as well. We ordered three cheesecakes: Key lime, tiramisu and original, a smores cake and a milkshake. They were delicious. The milkshake, my favorite, was perfect -- not too thick and well made with good quality ice cream and a perfect blend of milk. The cheesecakes were also good so quality was not a problem.  The restaurant is loud and seems to be build to ""pack people in"" rather than to create a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience."
Big B.,"New York, NY",236,662,16,3.0,11/11/2016,"Went to this place more than 2 years ago. THe food is ok but not as good as CCF in Atlanta, which is the only one I had been to before."
Kevin Jiseup K.,"New York, NY",869,262,13,2.0,3/3/2015,"The great thing about Cheesecake Factory is that you know exactly what you're going to get.  The worst thing about Cheesecake Factory though, is that you know exactly what you're going to get. You're going to end up spending 3 days worth of your caloric allowance and $20+ for an enormous pasta and eating nonstop from that bread basket which has ridiculously delicious honey wheat - which our waitress told us was whole wheat (yeah right).  Look. CF is a solid place. But it really is overpriced for what it is... you really could go anywhere else. Because it is no longer acceptable as a non pre-pubescent male over the age of 20 to have my birthday parties at CF anymore, I am moving on. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, it was a good run."
Cie S.,"Baltimore, MD",13,18,2,2.0,5/22/2016,"I have always had an excellent experience at the Cheesecake Factory. However, this experience wasn't the best. When we sat down, we asked for hot tea. But, when my tea arrived, the glass wasn't clean. There were spots all over my glass. I asked once more for a glass and had the same issue. I asked another time, a different waiter and I still got a dirty glass. I asked the manager to order my food because it has been over an hour and I still haven't received my food. It took 45 minutes to get the manager to take our order."
Omair T.,"Frisco, TX",177,55,29,4.0,3/29/2014,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times before, but I decided to review this location. I usually shy away from large chain restaurants but if I had to pick one, the Cheesecake Factory would be the one. This location looks exactly like every other location I have been to, very grand and open. Reminds me restaurants in Vegas. I have yet to have a bad meal at this restaurant, everything I have tried has always been good. A lot of people are hating because of long wait times, but that's a given with any popular place regardless of it being a chain or not, especially on the weekends. The portions here are huge, I can normally eat half and save the rest for another meal later. So if you think about it that way its not that expensive at all. The service has always been good as well, if they ever make a mistake they will do what they can to accommodate your requests.  My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce de Leche, OH MY. It is so creamy and light, I highly recommend it if you are looking for something on the lighter side. The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice for a good meal."
James C.,"Arlington, VA",10,42,8,5.0,8/4/2015,"Went here yesterday with my mom visiting. We have a two year old and they were very accommodating.  Every dish was enormous and delicious, took leftovers home for all items. Chicken and pasta dishes and burgers are awesome."
Kim S.,"Temple Hills, MD",147,315,599,4.0,2/19/2014,I love this location. I have never had a wait longer than 5 minutes. The staff is always pleasant. Food always excellent.
Stephanie T.,"Bergen County, NJ",190,200,1136,4.0,6/27/2015,The service was outstanding. Nice atmosphere and not packed like North Jersey. If I revisit the area I will come here again.
Sigrid W.,"Durham, NC",10,9,,4.0,5/26/2016,"Good cheesecake, but really, very crowded and a high noise level. I bring my cheesecake to eat with netflix. Thats all the date I need"
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,5.0,1/6/2014,"My bf and I visited the Cheesecake Factory in Clarendon for our New Year's Eve dinner before a night of festivities.  This was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory on the East Coast, but I've been to several locations in California.   The service was great and we were seated almost immediately at around 6pm, even though we didn't have reservations (we called ahead to make them but they said they didn't take reservations past 5pm).   We ordered:  -Hot spinach and cheese dip (Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Shallots, Garlic and a Mixture of Cheeses. Served Bubbly Hot with Tortilla Chips and Salsa).  This was definitely enough for both of us. -Santa Fe Salad (Lime-Marinated Chicken, Fresh Corn, Black Beans, Cheese, Tortilla Strips, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette).  This was delicious and a very generous portion! -The Factory Burger (Charbroiled with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions on Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf. Served with French Fries or Green Salad).  We also got drinks: -Beer (went well with my bf's burger!) -PIneapple mojito (Bacardi Superior, Cruzan Single Barrel Estate Rum and Fresh Pineapple).  This was very fruity and delicious. All in all, we had an excellent meal - very nice restaurant with delicious food.  A great way to end 2013, an amazing year."
Jessa B.,"Berlin, NJ",11,19,35,4.0,8/5/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many of times. It was my first time to this location and I got the half organic chicken that was grilled with a lemon herb seasoning, alongside carrots and mashed potatoes. There was an option to get this dish prepared gluten free however I didn't choose it. I was very pleased with my meal. The chicken was moist and tasted great. I hate when you get that fake rubbery tasting chicken. Not here, the chicken was of good quality. The marinade they use was amazing I couldn't get enough! Needless to say I will be ordering this dish from now on."
Anthony T.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",117,152,57,3.0,1/31/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has perfected its niche of ultra-efficient, semi-casual, hugely-portioned food and the Clarendon location is consistent with other Cheesecake Factories I've visited. The service is attentive and welcoming, the food portions are rightfully ginormous, and the atmosphere is a mix of the after-dinner crowd, birthday party, and family of four. But consistency isn't always the best thing. Cheesecake Factory's food always tends to be a bit...much. Whether it's size, seasoning, or flavor, the food isn't up to par with smaller establishments. This time around, I ordered Godiva Cheesecake on our server's recommendation for something chocolate. The chocolate was overpoweringly rich, cloyingly sweet, and paired inexplicably with two mountains of whipped cream. Not to say it didn't meet expectations for ""chocolate"", but the cheesecake itself just felt a bit much. Perhaps what separates Cheesecake Factory from other restaurants is subtlety in the dishes it creates.  But, for pigging out purposes on a cold winter's night, Cheesecake factory does just fine."
Eleni C.,"Alexandria, VA",108,36,86,5.0,5/15/2015,"Its my second time here.. As usual you feel like a kid standing in front of a fridge full of Cheesecake heaven cakes.. Our waiter was very nice especially when i asked him for some chocolate sauce and he never charged us for it .. We got the chocolate caramel turtles , the classic cheese cake and  we added a boll of strawberries.."
Samuel F.,"Alexandria, VA",89,70,37,2.0,4/4/2016,Disappointed I'm used to the cheesecake factories in PA I have been to 2 or 3 and every time they are swamped but still great service and delicious food. I went into this location with 3 others and each one of our orders had something wrong with it and we got there around 4pm before the dinner rush. Also took a while to get our food. I'll try it here again because I love this chain and hopefully have something better to report next time.
Shanni O.,"White Plains, MD",226,26,7,4.0,4/17/2016,The service is pretty good. I am a regular here & visit for dinner. The food is excellent & the staff has always been consistent on customer service.
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",300,735,895,3.0,12/9/2014,"How I heard of this place: Introduced by my sister, we never fail to return. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond. Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start! Atlantic salmon next, one Herb Crusted Salmon ($12.95) with red-skinned mashed potatoes and asparagus in a creamy lemon-butter sauce,and one Simply Grilled Salmon ($12.95) with mashed potatoes and four large spears of asparagus. One Fresh Lemonade ($3.95), sweet and tart, with a ring of sugar on the cups rim to complete the meal. On a return visit, Monday, 21 January 2013: We returned to the Cheesecake Factory on our way back from the 57th Presidential Inauguration at the National Mall in Washington, DC, and after a 3-mile walk, to satisfy his craving for Buffalo Blasts ($10.95) and two orders of Fresh Grilled Salmon ($14.95 each), served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. What I loved: The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style were crispy, slightly hot with the buffalo sauce and tempered with the blue cheese in a thick ranch-flavored dip. The salmon, soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus drenched in a puddle of lemon-butter sauce were savored until the last bite. Why I loved it: The lunch portions were reasonable and filling and the food consistently good. You know what you are going to get at the Cheesecake Factory, and I have never been disappointed. Cost: Average to high ($9.95-$19.95 per lunch entree)"
Lisa S.,"Arlington, VA",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,We ordered food from the cheesecake factory last night and will never go back again. One hair? Ok. But two?! Never again!
Dinah W.,"Alexandria, VA",165,98,262,4.0,12/6/2015,"I have visited this location on two occasions and both have been a very pleasant experience. The waitress and hosts were attentive and the food was delicious as always. You can't go wrong with the orange chicken . The main downside is parking. It's either street side or parking garage, which can become costly over an hour."
Huiyu Z.,"Washington, DC",43,28,194,3.0,5/4/2014,"This time we had pasta. Cheesecake factory always offer dishes in large portion. I ordered Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, it said tastes spicy on the menu but not to me.  I was surprised how many people is celebrating b-day this saturday, as we encountered birthday singing from staff, 3 times during our dinner. A good dining environment for family, but you have to increase your voice to hear each other clearly."
Betty H.,"Orange County, CA",153,310,,2.0,9/18/2013,"Had the chocolate mousse cheesecake here. It came with two scoops of whipped cream. Was for a birthday so they added two scoops of vanilla ice-cream.  I thought it was very average. For a place known for their cheesecake, it was just so so. I thought it could be just a tiny bit sweeter. I also thought it was pretty overpriced for such a small piece of cake.  It was nice that they added the ice-cream and wrote ""Happy Birthday to You"" in chocolate on the cake.  Did not try their food, but they do have a wide selection of food."
