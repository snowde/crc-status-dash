Gene M.,"Alexandria, VA",2,35,17,2.0,3/31/2015,I eat here about once a month. Tonight was not very good. I had the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich with a side salad. I couldn't finish any of it. The BBQ was so sweet it was like eating a one pound bag of brown sugar. It made the green salad served with it taste like bitter herbs at Passover.  Several glasses of water and I still could not get the sweet taste out of my mouth. I had to pay my bill and leave hungry.
Proteus D.,"Littleton, CO",36,393,12,4.0,2/10/2016,"Well it's the cheesecake factory. But I must say this one was a good experience for me. No long lines and the food was quick. I went for some kind of Cajun, shrimp pasta. That was pretty delicious actually. So while I feel like I should give this chain 3 stars .... I'm going with 4 :-)"
Andrew G.,"Washington, DC",1,74,120,5.0,3/5/2016,I had a delicious custom omelette and a strawberry milkshake. Delicious food and good service!
Christine M.,"Arlington, VA",18,101,19,3.0,11/4/2014,"Pretty standard chain restaurant- pick out what you think you want ahead of time because the menu is LONG.  I recommend the navajo sandwhich which comes on an indian fry bread- (think like a lightly fried pita) - with grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, avocado and mayo it takes your  sandwich to the next level.  I also highly recommend the lettuce wraps (get them as an entree its huge)"
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Nichole U.,"Manassas, VA",14,16,,1.0,6/20/2015,"As I looked up The Cheesecake Factory's website after this visit, I was informed that it was very kid friendly. So I was a little baffled as to how the 1 year old in our group was not accommodated at all. I live in Manassas. So my friend & I drove all the way out to Arlington to see our friend, her husband, & their baby. This was their first visit to a sit down restaurant after having a child, by the way. My friend & I arrived early & asked for a table for four plus a high chair for the baby. The three hosts looked extremely confused about life, so I repeated myself. When they finally sat us down they did not bring a high chair. I wasn't too worried about it at first bc I figured out server would do so after the rest of our group & the child arrived.  I was wrong. His name was Hansell & I made a point to remember it. He saw the parents holding the child & not once did he bring a high chair when asked or even offer a booster seat or kids menu or anything. This really irritated me bc he saw my friends taking turns holding the baby so that they could eat. That is just completely ridiculous! Then the friend that I rode up w never received any of the condiments he ordered. My food came out wrong & ten minutes before everyone else's food. Then once the food runners brought the rest of the food, Hansell disappeared. For a long time. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine. My friends drinks weren't refilled as well. Then when he reappeared, he put the check all together & just left it at the end of the table & walked away. Before this, I was going to order a dessert. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. But he gave us a really dirty dessert menu, which I know he saw because he opened it to the page for us before handing it over & it had food all over it. Then he disappeared again for so long I was just over the entire thing. So after waiting twenty more minutes he came back to retrieve the check & I told him we were not on the same check (but thanks for asking bc that was a pretty odd assumption to make) & asked if he could split it. Disappears again & we all kicked ourselves for not having any cash bc we knew it would take him forever to process the cards.  The food was decent, but my friends felt like they were a nuisance for bringing their 1 year old son with them to lunch. It wasn't busy. I feel that they could've been way more accommodated for the hefty prices on the menu & the easy 80$ our checks were combined (which would've been more if he ever asked about a wine refill or checked to see if my friend had decided on a cocktail). I feel as if he was about to be off & just didn't care at all about us as guests. It was a really bad look, Cheesecake. I expected more from you specifically as a restaurant. I am appalled at the terrible service they received & am really upset on their behalf. Parents bring their kids so they don't have to cook or clean. It's a break for them which they needed desperately. Instead, they were forced to take turns holding the baby so that they could eat their meals. Completely ridiculous. Hansell should have been trained better. It is pretty obvious that a 1 year old needs a high chair or at least a booster seat. It is also sad that while it was so slow we never got what we asked for. Needless to say, I don't think that my friends will be coming out again with their son for quite some time. Most of our visit was us trying to convince them that there was something wrong with Hansell & that bringing their baby to lunch was not at all an inconvenience. Especially to a restaurant who welcomes children which is what their website claimed."
Noor M.,"Champaign, IL",10,68,36,2.0,6/14/2015,"Stopped by Cheesecake Factory for Appetizers and Dessert around 11 pm on a Saturday night. We walked in and despite three people (who I assume were employees based on their clothes) standing at the reception desk, we were not greeted or welcomed. After waiting for 5 minutes, one of the said three people showed us to our table.  Our server showed up with menus and asked about drinks. We ordered a pizza and while it did arrive in around 15 minutes or so, it tasted no better than frozen pizza. I'm still struggling to figure out why I would pay so much for something so greasy and tasteless. Water would have helped during this ordeal but our server was no where to be found.  After waiting till what seemed like eternity, our server finally came around and asked about dessert- we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  The cheesecake was pretty yummy and we were glad that at least there was something redeeming about our visit. The service was exceedingly poor. Yes, I realize that we went in pretty late but if they can't manage past a certain time, why remain open till 1 am?  The pizza was awful. It is not something that I will be going back for. Ever. The cheesecake.. while it was tasty, I don't think it was good enough to warrant another visit. Save yourself the trouble and go to another restaurant.. this area is full of them! Just because we made a stupid mistake doesn't mean you should also! You are warned."
Paige H.,"Lansing, MI",54,27,9,4.0,12/31/2014,The Chicken Bella gig was spot on! Way too much food for on sitting! I sat at the bar and it's mid day. I wasn't impressed then the manager (I think) pushed a gigantic plant past me. Who knows how much dust ... and whatever fell off the leaves. Um yuck.
Kyla W.,"Washington, DC",106,64,10,4.0,7/14/2014,"I always start off with their friend mac-n-cheese balls, (to DIE for) and a strawberry Martini. WATCH OUT! Their drink prices are not listed and extremely expensive. (My drink cost only few dollars less than my meal.) Next I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini with sun roasted tomatoes, GOOD, but not all that. I should've got a pasta meal or something But the Oreo cheesecake was very good. I LOVED the atmosphere, dim lighting, great music, and the ambiance was fantastic.  I would definitely go here for a first date or a romantic evening out."
Bader J.,"Arlington, VA",3,35,1,3.0,2/25/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has a nice atmosphere. Usually busy on the weekends. I have tried a few dishes and the best one was the Chicken Costoletta  , it is a chicken breast lightly breaded and sautéed. It is served with lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken itself is ok , but the lemon sauce is to die for.I highly recommend this dish."
Vishal S.,"Rockville, MD",300,1068,131,3.0,5/8/2013,"On the very rare occasions that I am craving dessert and not in the mood for something else local, I do stop by this location for some cheesecake. They do make good cheesecakes but they are the the industrial production kind - big and creamy and super unhealthy (not like any dessert is healthy)! But they taste good and big enough to share. Service is off sometimes - the waitstaff seem to be spread too thin."
Mounia K.,"Arlington, VA",18,11,7,4.0,7/15/2016,The food is always good but for the past 2 times the service was very slow. I had to clean the table myself twice. With 3 kids it really kids messy
Tarah S.,"Alexandria, VA",28,8,3,1.0,7/18/2014,"So...I was served garbage. Yep. Check out my picture. I  ordered an appetizer that was burnt. So burnt that when I opened the container the smell of the char lingered in my kitchen! A little black on toast, no problem, but this was damn near Cajun! The cheese was destroyed. The whole thing was hard as a brick. I'm talking busting heads with a loaf of bread! I can't believe the cook didn't throw it in the garbage and fix a new one. But instead, the cook burnt it, the waiter prepared it for my to go order and sold it to me. At least 2 people knew it was not fit for consumption and sold it to me anyway. The waiter could have told me it was burnt and asked if I wanted to wait or be refunded...I'm really disappointed, and angry that I didn't check my order before I left...lesson learned. Guess I'll be going to Tyson's location from now on."
James S.,"Washington, DC",37,206,28,2.0,4/19/2015,"I'm generally a fan of this chain, as the quality and variety tend to be a bit better than other big-box retail restaurants. The Clarendon isn't a good example for the franchise. I've been there perhaps three times, and I've never been greeted warmly at the door. On one occasion, my vegan dining guest asked for recommendations from our waiter. He acted like he'd never heard the word before, and then after we spent some time explaining it, he dismissively said, ""Uh, we got a veggie burger."" In the same visit, the waiter came up to me as I was going to the rest room and said, ""hey, we don't have the Blue Moon you ordered. You want anything else?"" No apology. No recommendation of a similar beer. Lousy, indifferent service all around which speaks to poor/insufficient training."
Tynisha H.,"Washington, DC",203,118,705,4.0,5/1/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory!!! This place is always peaceful, clean and the service is great. They are always busy but its never a real wait 5-10mins or so it varies. Everything Ive ate so far has been good .......No real Complaints.  I suggest everyone to try the Firecracker Salmon appetizer BOMB!!!!!!!!!! Im in love. The Moroccan chicken was different but good! It has peanuts in it which I fail to see on the menu and almost died during dinner no LOL! I'm sure it was on there I just didn't read it :-/  My server was great she actually ran out the door to give me my change($43) I totally forgot! So honest staff as well!! The Mango key lime cheesecake is GOOOOODDD!!!!! The only Cheesecake Factory I like dinning in the others are a little iffey!!!"
Flo S.,"Arlington, VA",1330,189,4162,3.0,3/21/2011,"3/15 - Dinner With all this competition of restaurants in the Clarendon to Ballston  area, Cheesecake needs to step it up with their menu even more. Kudos for them for adding new things to their menu in the past year.  My all time fav dish is the chicken bellagio!!!  This is two chicken breasts which are pounded flat and dipped in some breading and fried.  It is served over a bed of creamy pesto linguini and arugula.  Oh, did I mention that it has prosciutto on top..mmm delish!   But because I gave up fried food during Lent on this visit, I ordered the chicken madiera..I was pleasantly surprised with this sauteed chicken breast with mushrooms served with asparagus and mash potatoes.  My friend ordered MY chicken bellagio. Yes, I am claiming it because I introduced her to it.  At the end of the meal, I ordered the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake --- eh, it was not good. I think the mac nuts were overly sweet and chunky (thought it would be crushed or something). I should stick to what I know and should have gone with any of the three - banana, dulce de leche or the red velvet.   Even with all this competition, I still heart cheesecake factory for their service and bread basket that never left me down!"
M N.,"Apple Valley, MN",0,71,8,3.0,5/22/2015,"Went here with wife and daughter. They offer Gluten Free pasta in their dishes. My wife an daughter had the GF 4 cheese pasta and I tried the ""Very Spicy Cashew chicken"". We ordered the dinner portion at dinner prices during lunch because we were heading to the airport and new we wouldn't eat again til after out flight. The prices were avg $16 per person or thereabouts. The portion size was not a good value for the money-like a lunch portion at dinner price. The food was decent but the ""Very Spicy"" in the title of the cashew chicken-why i picked it- was barely spicy more like tangy-so a bit of a letdown.  My daughter likes this place, wife and I won't feel bad if we never go again.  Not awful, not orgasmic - just average and a bit pricey. Place was pretty empty and wait for our food was on the long side. The server did a good job. Never had cheesecake. Decor is gaudy nice."
Victoria B.,"Fairfax, VA",14,3,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Poor service, the waitress is crap, been here 1 hour, ran out if tourney and haven't seen food, have to ask numerous times for our drinks. Not coming back for a Longgggggg time"
Lorrie L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",44,215,140,4.0,4/10/2014,Fish Tacos and Banana Cheesecake! What combo. I thought the food and service were wonderful! Andrea B was great! Had Banana Cheesecake for the first time (I normally have something chocolate) it was so so good! Fish Tacos could have been a little bit spicier. Other than that all was very good.
Kristen W.,"Arlington, VA",112,186,13,4.0,3/31/2014,"I have a confession: I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. There, I said it. I feel better.  Here's the thing: in Arlington, there are always trendy new restaurants, crazy lines out the door, etc.  People get all uppity about the Cheesecake Factory but my experiences here have all been very positive.  Usually I'm seated immediately, but even at peak times like Sunday brunch or Friday dinner I've never waited for more than a few minutes for a table. I've never had a meal I didn't enjoy here.  I've never had bad service here.  When the weather is nice, the outdoor patio is a great option for dining al fresco (see how fancy that sounds?) and Clarendon people watching.  The drinks are strong, the bathrooms are clean, the portion sizes ample (as you can expect from almost any Cheesecake Factory), and you can't beat the location.  That's a good meal in my book, even if it isn't a trendy and hip restaurant.  Will definitely be back."
