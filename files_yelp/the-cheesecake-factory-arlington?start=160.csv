Amanda B.,"Washington, DC",218,238,216,2.0,3/13/2012,"OVERRATED.  I probably been 5 times in my life for a birthday or graduation dinner. IDK who set the standard that The Cheesecake Factory is the ultimate choice for a celebration. I went over the weekend because I received a gift card from work and it reminded me why I never go. I heard the Happy birthday song at least 6 times. The food sucks. The bill came to $70, I could have went to Fridays, ate good and balled at the bar. The cheesecake was bomb though."
Orquidea R.,"Alexandria, VA",120,58,1155,3.0,1/21/2013,"The Cheescake Factory is that place that you really want to visit on a special occasion. In my opion, make sure that you review the menu online before getting there because what you get as a menu is literally a BOOK.  This takes away from your time and by the time the waiter comes around you are so overwhelm with all the delicious names of plates you have read in this book. So for starters I will say that I like the calamari rings and the corn tamales with avocado. As main dish I have had the chicken costolleta (cutlets) and their famous plate, Chicken Madeira with Mash Potato. Overall the food is great...service is on top, but if you go on a busy day, food can take a long time to come out. Kahlua coffee cheesecake makes for a good desert, becuase there is no sense in visiting The Cheescake factory if you are not going to have a cheesecake!"
Toni C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,25,18,4.0,7/2/2015,Great place food came out hot and fast... I went for lunch so it wasn't too busy my bartender was very nice ... It was very cold inside though...however I went back later because I forgot something and was ignored at the service desk by 2 associates and a manager however another lady walked up and immediately got greeted. Even though this happened I'll still rate them with 4 Stars the manager was apologetic and I've never had ANY other issues there... However i recommend they make sure every one is greeted at the time they walk up.
Leslie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,132,,3.0,3/13/2014,"Recent dinner for six when restaurant was pretty empty after a snowstorm: 1  I had a chicken salad sandwich on toast. Mediocre. 2. Two orders of chicken piccata with pasta. VERY large and tasty but obviously loaded w butter. 2 doggie bags needed for leftovers. 3. Two large salads for 2 Moms. No reaction from either -- pro or con. 4. Dessert was a shared piece of Tiramisu and a slice of Chocolate cake--- large and covered w 2 lbs of whipped cream. Tiramisu was not  authentic but ok. Other was good. 5. One iced tea. No complaints.  6. Service was attentive and prompt. Water glasses refilled.   7..Nice ""faux"" Egyptian atmosphere. Large space. 8 .Overall reaction: typical American mall-style dining experience. No urgency to return.  9. Cost: $109 for 6 people (includes tax and tip)."
Laxmi S.,"Washington, DC",169,123,201,4.0,1/28/2014,"You can make fun of me all you want, but I'm going to go ahead and put it out there: I freaking love this place, and I crave it, too.  The service at this location is not as awesome as it is at their Tyson's Galleria location, but I don't think I'd be too happy if I had to wear the color white from head-to-toe for more than 3 hours...so, their waitstaff gets kudos for that.  Otherwise, the avocado spring rolls and Evelyn's pasta are my go-to items...every.single time."
Aaron Y.,"Cambridge, MA",0,57,,1.0,2/17/2015,"The service was subpar.  We felt like the leftover table that any random server who was passing by would bring the next item.  It took almost 15 minutes to get noticed.  It almost became a joke with my wife who would come next - manager, random waiter coming off a break, the dish cleaners, etc.  The table was too close to the next table, and were subjected to observe what could only be described as an awkward   date.  We needed some separation from the others. The chicken fettuccini alfredo had absolutely no flavor, and the pasta tasted like it wasn't salted.  The chicken tasted like the frozen pre-cut, pre-cooked variety that was warmed up in the microwave.  We have tasted frozen stuff from the grocery store with more flavor.  My eggplant parmesan was just ok - more breading than eggplant.  The pesto pasta again had no flavor.   I would not recommend this location."
Terrance T.,"Alexandria, VA",0,7,17,2.0,1/3/2015,"Enough is Enough!!!  Inconsistent and lack of quality and service.  The Cheesecake Factory has lost it taste.  The servers seem like they don't want to be at work.  The kitchen staff is not taking pride in their work.  They sent out my son's burger with the key ingredients (sauté onion). My fish tacos were horrible.  They put the wet ingredients down first and the fish on top, which made my fish taco entree soggy.  For this reason, my 2 stars are gift for a place I loved.  Take proud in serving and cooking!  p.s. My son liked his burger but it didn't come with what it said it came with and had to ask them to put it on there. The hostess were great but the severs weren't enthusiastic about what the do"
Sonja H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",47,37,5,5.0,1/25/2015,Good service Everytime we go here and good quality. We have ordered her to go several times and they always get our order exactly right. The food is fresh and tasty!
Teena N.,"Arlington, VA",7,19,12,1.0,11/4/2013,"It's so easy to love the Cheesecake Factory & their big menu full of anything imaginable but last night made me so upset I had to share. My family & I brought a group of 25 of our employees out for dinner last night and wanted a nice and relaxing evening to celebrate recent success. Instead our server Hansel was in such a hurry to kick us all out at 11pm. When making this reservation (spoken to Gigi the manger) she didn't mention anything about the kitchen closing at 11 but after we had all arrived we were unbelievably rushed.  It's a big group, it was a huge bill, and we expected at least good service if they received a good $500 tip with  the included gratuity already applied to the bill.  We were told the bar closes at 11. Ok no problem but we can't even order soda after 11?? Do they close down their soda fountain gun too??? Can't even get a sprite or coke??!! Crazy. And does not sound reasonable at all. This Clarendon location should be avoided ESPECIALLY FOR BIG GROUPS. We even wanted to gift the employees individual cheesecakes and the first thing the lady says to me is ""you look middle eastern and some cakes have liquor & pork"" are you kidding me?? I am from India, we have been ordering alcoholic drinks until we were rudely stopped AND ordered pork items for dinner. Racist, rude, rushed. Should be avoided at all costs. I'm very offended & will be calling their corporate offices."
Amy F.,"Arlington, VA",52,97,6,2.0,6/14/2014,"I wanted to give it three stars, but the service here is so bad. The food is great, as always, but here you have rude wait staff who will not accomodate guests. Our table was rather dirty tonight, and we asked the waitress to clean it up. She rolled her eyes at us.  Have had bad service here on multiple occasions.  Skip Clarendon and check out another location."
Ham M.,"Arlington, VA",119,49,33,3.0,7/26/2015,"This place is great starting from the decoration, ambiance, food, dessert and specially the lemonade with strawberry juice. This place deserves 5 stars. BUT, unfortunately, the service is not in the same level as the restaurant. It's disappointing at some point and that's why I took off the other two stars. I might make them 5 next time when I come back. I still strongly recommend it. It's a lovely place specially for family..."
Hu K.,"Zürich, Switzerland",338,1251,2819,4.0,5/2/2010,"I love CCF's HH.  Everyone knows all dishes at CCF come with Generous portion, even desserts. It applies to all dishes during HH too. I am SOLD to CCF's tamale and fried mac n' cheese. for $5, this is a steal deal. I couldn't finish all the food and they even packed the leftover for me. I will return very soon for more. PS: CCF has quite a few small bite-dishes for $5 or less all day. If you missed HH and just want to nibble something, try their small bite-options. It might be a small-bite for CCF, but for me, it can be easily entree:)"
Al S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1218,173,340,5.0,6/2/2014,lots of good food. It may take a little long do make sure you go there if you have a lot if time but quality if food and service deserves 5 rating
Shu Z.,"Washington, DC",90,6,17,2.0,3/30/2016,"Our server Anna A lacks sense of urgency. She kept me waiting for 15 mins after I seated. I was never able to find her during my lunch. The whole experience is just bad. I asked for a Togo box which she also totally forget, I had to ask for someone else for it. I don't know if she is new or what, she didn't know what she is doing!!! We asked for strawberry with sugar to go since we don't wanna wait any longer. However, she also didn't put sugar."
Tish H.,"Alexandria, VA",1,6,,2.0,9/11/2014,"If you know Cheesecake then this location has to be one of their poor performing locations. We enjoy the occasional Cheesecake experience. We usually go when we know that whatever you pick off of the menu will not disappoint and/ or you want decent service. Experience #1 My fiancé ordered their Bang Bang Chicken NO SHRIMP and was served the dish with shrimp.  Response from staff - I did put it in the 'no shrimp' request Experience #2 (months later) Fiancé tried the same dish again, after waitress assured us such mistake from previous experience would not happen again.  She was right, however my dish arrived just about 8 minutes before his finally arrived at the table.  Needless to say I waited until his plate arrived, knowing my dish was getting colder by the minute. Response from staff : No explanation or apology provided.   Will not go to this location again.  Three times may be the charm but - no thank you!"
Robin S.,"Irwin, PA",4,48,34,3.0,2/2/2014,"First, as this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory, I was surprised how reasonable the prices were. I thought this place was going to be really expensive. Pleasantly surprised that this assumption was incorrect. The appetizer of nachos was really good. The tortilla chips were authentic & good - not Tostitos out of the bag! The entree I had, Shepard Pie, was definitely calorie filled but it was delicious! The serving size was huge! Needless to say, I needed a box! And of course, the cheesecake! They seriously have like 30 different kinds of cheesecake. I got Oreo Fantasy Cheesecake. It was very good. I was just so full that i was ready to explode by the time I got to desert. TIP: Get the cheesecake to go for later. This place is a 3-4 star place. If I could give 3.5 stars, that would be my rating. The fact that it is a chain restaurant is a ""star deduction"" for me. Just sayin!"
Denise J.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,10,,3.0,8/9/2015,"My family came to visit from Belgium, and the day before they left, we decided to take them to dinner, and we chose the Cheesecake Factory in Clarendon.  First, the hostesses were quite friendly, and told us that our wait would be 25-30 minutes. We waited outside for 45 minutes, then I went to ask the hostesses about the wait. They came off a little rude and said just a few more minutes. Meanwhile, larger parties that came after us were being seated. I went back in after another 15 minutes to ask what the hold up was, and at this point the hostesses were downright rude. Finally, after talking to the manager, they found us a table. The table was a round both, with two straw chairs on the outside to make it an 8 person table. It was uncomfortable, but after all the waiting, we decided to stay put. Our waitress was amazing! Her name was Briana I believe. She was very personable and helpful and made our experience way better than the direction it was heading. The food was great, of course the food portions were huge, and we were all satisfied by the end of the night. Other than the wait and the hostesses, my experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory was good."
William F.,"Washington, DC",49,109,92,3.0,11/30/2014,"This is your standard cheesecake factory. The atmosphere and decor are always lively and trendy. I'm just not a huge fan of cheesecake factories because of the extremely limited healthy options. Don't get me wrong, I love my unhealthy food, but does every sandwich need butter soaked bread? Obviously your not going to cheesecake factory to stay fit, but the food is just meh and very heavy. I would get a small plate and just chow down on one of their unique cheesecakes (which are all delicious). Happy hour is great, but unfortunately it is only from 4-6.  I'll be back for cheesecake and drinks."
Brandon H.,"Marion, VA",20,5,16,4.0,7/27/2014,"Very clean, super friendly waiter, prompt seating (it was 11am) overall good place to eat that's why we drove out of DC just to eat here again."
