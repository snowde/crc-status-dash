Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82,4.0,2/8/2014,"Yes, it's a chain, and one that covers a massively wide assortment of food, but the taste and atmosphere entertain me and I keep returning for more than just the amazing cheesecake.  I went to try the cheesecake long ago and have been going back regularly ever since to try more and more of the food.  I haven't gone wrong yet . . . and have occasionally even finished a whole plate. (Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you can sit outside -- in the comparative calm of a bustling street -- or hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed."
Shellie D.,"Alexandria, VA",46,579,167,4.0,5/7/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. My friends and I come her about 2-3 times a month. We order appetizers and dessert and just relax and talk. Just recently I ordered off of the skinny menu and I'm hooked!  The service is always great and the food is good to. You just have to know what to order. I love the calamari and the pot stickers. And the Bartender Michael is great! I don't drink anymore so I am not sure about his mixing skills, but as far as service and taking care of you, he does a great job."
Geno M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,67,22,4.0,6/15/2015,"The Food was amazing, however the service was not  quite up to what I thought it should be.  We had a very large party and had told the management what the adults wanted prior to taking the students order. The students orders can out first and it took so long for the adult food to come out!"
Terri R.,"Arlington, VA",30,15,14,4.0,12/13/2013,One of my favorite places. The food is good and for the most part seating has been quick every time I've come. The waiters are always pretty nice. The one thing I like most is the seating style. It's great for smaller parties.
Dayron D.,"Brandywine, MD",33,17,1,1.0,11/7/2014,I usually have a pretty good experience at cheesecake but this experience was by far the worst. I don't usually frequent this location. The food was sub par but what really makes this experience horrible was our waitress. KAELEN W. was awful. She spent no time with refill or orders. She made our entire experience slow. She sat up front at the hostess stand just chit chatting away while we were waiting on refills and desert. When we finally got refills and our check from another waiter. We were so ready to get out of there. Never again KAELEN you stole our experience and ruined dinner. For a place where the meals are $20+ a plate she could be more professional and attentive. She didn't have any others tables and made that very clear to her co workers.
Chloe S.,"Peoria, AZ",12,160,22,4.0,8/4/2013,"When you just feel like you need to eat at a chain restaurant instead of trying something new or kitsch in the downtown area of Arlington, VA...well, this is your place to go! Sarcasm aside, I do generally like this location. I have been here for lunch twice, and it is much quieter compared to the one near my home. The eggplant sandwich is my favorite thing to order, and portions are ample.  Minus one star for the creepypasta server we had both times. He gets down on one knee and props his chin on his fist on the table while taking our order. We don't know you, dude!"
Jorge N.,"Logan Circle, Washington, DC",5,10,5,2.0,4/21/2015,I usually like this restaurant but about two weeks ago I had a really bad experience. I had the Dulce de Leche Cheescake and ended up with a terrible terrible stomach ache and I couldn't go to work the next day. I wrote customer service to let them know that something was wrong with the product but they didn't want to listen. They said their protocols were followed and that they had no similar reports to date (which I find difficult to believe).
Meghan S.,"Alexandria, VA",71,224,45,1.0,5/15/2013,"I am def not coming back to this location ever again. I used to come for happy hour with a friend of mine, but it's been at least 6 months since the last time I came to this location. Food was always good, but the service never was. But I enjoyed girl time so we didn't really pay much attention. **First problem: took 7 to 10 minutes for our server to stop at the table. And I'm not even joking. Having been a server for 4 years, I KNOW you are supposed to stop at your table w/i the first 2 minutes. For all I know it could have exceeded 10 minutes b/c I was chatting up my friend and looking over the menu. The server stopped by with bread and no waters. Could have at least had the bread in 1 hand and the 2 mugs w/ handles in the other. Work smarter not harder right?  **Second problem: the service was crap. When he dropped off the waters he didn't ask if we wanted to order appetizers. Just jetted off to get our drinks from the bar which took like 8 minutes. That was a little annoying because we wanted to order appetizers and had to wait. Didn't even get to interject that we wanted to order appetizers before he ran off to put in the drink order. Then, we never saw our server between the time our food hit the table and the time we asked for our check.  **Third problem: the  entrees were HORRIBLE! I've ordered both of these dishes before a few times at other locations (Steak Diane and Skinnilicious Turkey Burger) and they were so disgusting. We hardly touched our food. The turkey burger tasted like the meat had gone bad and they cooked it and served it. It was so dry and just had the worst flavor. And like I said, I've ordered it several times before and it's delicious...but at other locations (McLean and Woodbridge). The Steak Diane, which is not my favorite to begin with, was horrible. I have never cared for it b/c the cut of meat is terrible and tough, but the sauce was just overly disgusting this time. My friend that ordered it hardly ate any of it, and for some reason took it home with him. *shakes head* So needless to say, $80 wasted and I should have gone with my gut feeling and driven the extra 10 miles to McLean to the Tyson's Galleria location. Learned that lesson and will not be returning."
Domonique W.,"Washington, DC",111,75,4,4.0,2/28/2014,"This was my first time at this Cheesecake Factory location. Went in for dinner on a Saturday night around 7pm...if you know CF, you know to expect a wait.  After a 30 minute wait, the boyfriend and I were seated sandwiched between two different groups.   I walked in the place knowing what I wanted, my favorite pasta dish from here the chicken bellagio. It is just so amazingly good and they give you a portion big enough for two people.  The bf ended up ordering stuffed tater tots for an appetizer (delicious!) and fried shrimp and fries.  I ordered a slice of the best cheesecake in the world: white chocolate caramel macademia nut. It is amazingly, out of this world, the  , good!  The 4 stars goes to the Cheesecake Factory as a chain, not just this one location."
Nick I.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,3/25/2016,"Great food, great service, great experience overall. Had a wonderful family dinner for our kid's birthday. The waiter was prompt, friendly, and helpful, and the food was delicious.  Had the steak diane and chicken madeira combo with the carrots and all of it was fantastic.  Wife had the salmon special which was also very good. Lemon raspberry cheesecake to top it all off was perfect. Recommend getting there a little early though as it got pretty packed as the night went on."
Brandon G.,"Silver Spring, MD",746,146,45,5.0,2/9/2015,Good ole Cheesecake Factory. What can I say. This restaurant is probably the most consistent restaurant chain I've ever been to. The menu is massive and I don't think I've ever had a complaint. Thats good since I've been to multiple locations in various states. I came for brunch because the last time I was at a Cheesecake Factory I had their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Hands down the best lemon pancakes I've ever tried. Here in the DMV area there are a lot of restaurants that say they have great lemon ricotta pancakes. Pfffftttt naw not like these! The service was great. We asked for a booth and we got one. Wasn't packed at all. Over all a great time. PLEASE DON'T EVER GET RID OF YOUR LEMON-RICOTTA PANCAKES! =D
Sean P.,"Charlottesville, VA",7,11,1,2.0,8/16/2014,Came here with my grandparent because they are picky eaters and this place has everything. Took twenty minutes for our server to appear after being seated. He took our drink orders and again disappeared for a while. I don't think we actually ordered until forty five minutes after being there. It wasn't very busy so I don't know why it took so long. When our food came out mine went to the table next me and the at the table lady ate the side and then our waiter realized he messed up so he took it from her and gave it to me and said she didn't touch it. I work at a restaurant and this is a health code violation. So it sat at the table in front off me until I could find him. After saying I'm not eating it he proceeded to give it back to the lady next to me. Seriously what its this musical plates. Not happy. However everybody's meal was good just not the service.
Manri P.,"San Diego, CA",43,48,3,4.0,4/23/2013,"It is the Cheescake Factory. If you haven't been here, go - you'll like it. It's better than Applebees. I know, some of you may think that Applebees and TCF play on different leagues, but it is too late, I already wrote that up there ^. I was eating dinner with a group of friends here once and a also a chick I was dating.  A friend of mine, let's call him ""Asshat"", and I were getting into a heated discussion about what he should do about a girl he was dating but disliked (not present at this meal).  Asshat got upset and said ""oh, so now that you are dating two girls at once, you are an expert on dating?""   The chick I was dating, lets call her Bushy, overheard his comment and promptly asked me what he was talking about. I told her that we were talking about David (seated to my left), then we all looked at his date (seated to his left) and she was all like ""WHAAAT?"".  Oh Snap!, I forgot that David's date was with us!  David looked at the girl and said ""nothing,don't worry about it"" . . . she looked at all of us briefly as we were crushed by the growing silence and then she placidly went back to slurping her pad thai noodles.  How the hell did he do that?  David is like the girl-whisperer... it probably helps that he is sexy as hell. At the end of the night, we all shared several slices of cheesecake, including: Dulce de Leche, Pumpkin, and Peanut Butter. All were splendid choices. Sidenote: I was dating two women at once. Like a boss ~M"
Sophie L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",455,14,28,2.0,2/23/2014,"Well, I came here and ordered from the chief special meal called Crab-Hash for Sunday brunch , turns out  it's just Big fried potatoes piled up with small deep fried potatoes, plus some over cooked egg on top as decoration...  what am I expecting lol, should have just ordered cheesecake here... Crap indeed."
Kuru A.,"Arlington, VA",3,4,3,1.0,11/16/2014,"I've always loved the food and atmosphere at cheesecake factory.I don't get to go as often as I used to add don't think I'll likely return to the Arlington location if I can avoid it.  I had a awful experience there about six weeks ago I sat outside, waited 15 minutes after another waitress sat me and got me a water while I looked at the drink menu. After what seemed to be forever, the waiter showed up 15 minutes later. I decided to have salmon and steak medium rare. Someone from the kitchen eventually brought us our food and I sampled a bit while waiting for our waiter or someone to order refills on our drinks and ask for A1 sauce. The steak was well done instead of medium rare so I just sat there thirsty and nibbling on the rest of my food that didn't taste like beef jerky. For so many reasons I rarely ever send my food back when it's wrongbut I would've made an exception this time. It would've been nice for the waiter to actually come by since I hadn't seen him since I ordered and I've been out of water since I started eating.  I noticed the other waitress also finally appeared after a 15 minute absence. she came back outside with a nearly empty pitcher of ice water, topped off the first two tables, then disappeared again. As All of this was going on for some crazy desperate reason the host sat several other tables outside instead of telling them that there was a wait and give them the option to sit inside. Sitting 3-4 other tables outside over a 20 min period was disrespectful and careless. This included a large group behind me that waited about 15 minutes before anyone even stopped at their table and that randomly ended up being some guy who said he was a manager. When he stopped by my table I ordered two waters and both of them the cars that it battery died and I got to give it a minute to fucking see if of them had and they had so little icewater 10 sure that I wouldn't run out and a few minutes later I have two waters with almost 0 ice which made no sense.  it still irks me so here I am creating a yelp account just to get it off my chest and hope I'll stop remembering."
Cassie H.,"Alexandria, VA",2,32,9,5.0,8/21/2013,"My little one and I have come here several times in the last few months and we are NEVER disappointed. I used to get the jambalaya pasta or chicken fettucine (sp?) but since I'm on a health kick I started eating off the Skinnylicious menu....kudos to them for having so many options! The turkey and avocado sandwich is amazing but I always substitute the salad, it's just not my cup of tea. My son loves their mac/cheese and the pasta and we split the kids strawberries. A yummy appetizer are the crispy crab bites! Extra points to them for always accommodating my need for a booth. My 2 year old does not like to sit still and the booths are big enough where he can ""explore"" and move about. Plus the waiters have always been nice and brought his food out first so we can enjoy our visit.  But the reason for even coming here is the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE! People it is NOT a game....this slice of heaven will have you hooking on the corner to afford it! hahaha Well...maybe not hooking but you get my point. All in all it is good for after church...romantic date....happy hour...or just about any occasion. An added bonus is you can walk around the area and work some of the calories off!"
Gloria S.,"New York, NY",85,56,37,2.0,7/25/2013,"If you are having trouble sleeping at night, you should just come here for a late night meal, as everything on their extensive menu of coma-inducing dishes are surely to put you to bed within 5 mins of finishing your meal.  The menu is too long, with super similar items listed in the same categories (i.e. some of their pastas).  It's also very hit or miss...  Some items are edible, some taste like cardboard.  I'm not sure why I ever make return visits to any of the Cheesecake Factories...  I don't even think I could call it a ""crowd-pleaser"" (unless you are into bland, uncreative entrees sweltering in butter and cheese that I swear they put roofies in).  And what's up with the Skinny Menu?  Everything under 600 calories!??!  How many freaking calories are in a regular entree??  1,000!?!? But their cheesecake IS pretty good..."
Lee F.,"Arlington, VA",1,204,2,4.0,1/21/2015,"I have to say, this was a very good experience.  For an appetizer, I got the tuna tartar, which was very good.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly to order.  I ordered broccoli, which was neither over- nor under-cooked.  My kids loved their kids meals, and my wife enjoyed her entrée.  And of course, the desserts were phenomenal.  The only complaint I have is that the restaurant was far too dark even to read the menu.  My wife and I had to use our cell phones to add light.  The menu is quite extensive--almost too many options to easily make a selection in a timely manner.  That includes the wines-by-the-glass list, which is not bad at all."
Cynthia R.,"Springfield, VA",0,1,,4.0,9/21/2013,Ask for Ezita as your servers she's great!!  She's such an upbeat person it made our experience even better (mind you it's a Friday night at like 10:30...If I was her..id much rather be out with my hubby and friends instead of working...) she didn't let it phase her at all. She was awesome!  The hubby and I went out to eat late after work so we decided the Cheesecake Factory would be good. We had such a fun time we had Ezita as our server she was beyond great. One of those servers that's 3 steps ahead of you. He got the Mac and cheese burger which was really delicious and I got the chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes. And the banns cream cheesecake. Everything was really delicious. Only bad thing was they no longer have the sweet mint green tea  all teas are unsweetened. Yeah...you can add sugar. It's just not the same haha.
Mike T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",39,181,29,4.0,11/18/2013,No problems at this location on a recent trip to D.C... pretty busy on a sat night at around 8pm.. had to wait a bit for table.. were seated at a small table but oped to wait some more for a nice booth.. host's kept us informed and seated us after waiting.. server was great very nice.. food was perfect like many other times I visited Cheesecake Factory..  still a fan even having to wait a bit for a table.. 4 stars all day.
