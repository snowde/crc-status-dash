Lottie Y.,"Oakton, VA",32,516,66,4.0,9/9/2012,"The bread is disappointing, not as good as what I heard.  Chicken breast and miso salmon both are great. The cheesecake are of course fantastic! The waiters are all busy. The atmosphere is a little noisy maybe due to the high ceiling."
Grace T.,"Washington, DC",19,83,44,5.0,8/27/2009,"I am not gonna review Cheesecake Factory cause probably everybody and their mother has been here.  I am simply reviewing their anniversary cheesecake ""Stephanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". Why no one has ever thought of making this before.. I DO NOT KNOW. It is amazing. We had heard that there was going to be a red velvet cheesecake coming out. We had brunch (in June) at CF and asked our waitress if it was out yet, she had no idea there was even such a thing. So then a few days later we find the link announcing that the red velvet cheesecake would be coming out the end of July. We went the first weekend in August and were sadly disappointed that they RAN OUT. BUT to our joyous relief they were getting 30 cases shipped from the Tyson's Corner CF. So you better believe we went the next day for just one slice and it was totally worth the wait and drive.  This needs to stay on their menu forEVER... it is delicious."
Tracie J.,"Lorton, VA",4,4,,4.0,8/15/2014,"This is typically my go to lunch and happy hour spot. Service is always great and the avocado egg roles and lettuce wraps are my favorite. It gets extremely crowded during happy hour so arrive early, especially on Fridays."
Crystal-Nicole B.,"Springfield, VA",18,57,1,5.0,5/4/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory. This location is a bit busy and parking can be a nightmare but the food is good and the service we had was excellent. A bit pricey but I would recommend this location to anyone.
J. D.,"Washington, DC",0,258,,3.0,6/1/2015,"The service here is wonderful. As soon as I walked in, I knew what to do and I easily ordered and received my cheesecake slices. The staff members are very courteous and efficient. I'll return to this location."
Joseph E.,"Arlington, VA",5,3,,4.0,2/9/2014,We stopped by for some happy hour appetizers. Great deal $5 each. Customer service ok but needed some improvement.  We will definitely come back though
Candace P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,12,5,2.0,1/10/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but yesterday I went to this location and was not impressed. I hadn't been to C.F. in almost a year because Ive been trying non-chain, mom and pop type places since moving to this big city. When I got a gift card for Xmas I was actually excited to go back. What a disappointment.The food was not good at all. I get the same thing all the time. When I went in the past it has never been this bad. I had buffalo blasts for appetizer. The first one was OK but the second one I bit into tasted like uncooked chicken. I tossed that one and tried another and it was half OK and the other half had like grissley (really can't think of the right word to describe the taste) chicken. I gave up. I had already ordered my entree so just waited for something better to come. The crab cakes were just okay not good but the fries were stale. I didn't even take my leftovers and we all know at C.F. there are usually leftovers. Don't go to this C.F. until they get new chefs. These chefs must have just got out of high school football practice and ran over to their weekend job. The best thing about this experience was meeting up with a friend, my drink was strong and the waiter was absolutely wonderful, hence the two stars for him. Even the cheesecake I ordered tasted like the crust was burnt. It was a snickers cheesecake so I know the crust is supposed to be dark but this tasted burnt. It was bad. I didn't complain to my waiter because all he could have done was go back and get me some more bad food. It was on a gift card so I took the loss since it wasn't my actual money. Please C.F. re-train your chefs."
Terri H.,"Lynnwood, WA",18,195,9,5.0,3/18/2012,"We went for an early dinner here and were AMAZED at the lunch salads we could order because it was before 5 p.m. The quality, taste, and price was impressive! We can't imagine the BIGGER dinnertime salad! I was thankful it wasn't any bigger because I had room for cheesecake! I will also say that I found the servers to be friendly and efficient. It was a great experience for my first time to CCF! I recommend the Southwest chicken salad!"
Mia N.,"Alexandria, VA",22,307,92,2.0,1/9/2012,"I don't know why I keep on coming to this chain.  We went in Naples, Florida last year and it was average and blah, so I should have known better when we went again 2 weeks ago to the Clarendon location.  I really wanted to buy stocking holders on sale at Pottery Barn, which weren't even there, and which I should have just gotten on line, but they had sold out online!  Anyway, I got excited thinking we could have good food here.  Never again.  I would rather go cheap and just find a Taco Bell for sustenance than spend another $50 here when I could spend that same $50 on at least 3 days worth of snacks and food from Trader Joe's or Shopper's. We made the mistake of ordering the nachos, which we or I gobbled up as I was famished. They weren't even that great.  Not that much salsa and no chili. Just fried chips with globs of greasy melted cheese.  The best nachos are at Numero Uno and Hard Rock Cafe.  Anyway, I was so full I couldn't eat my entree, a southwestern barbeque salad, which was tasteless.  Not enough dressing.  It was a wasted $9.95 and I didn't even eat it.  The corn wasn't even sweet.  The menu is just too much and full of  heavy sleep inducing fattening foods that I always choose a salad, which ends up not being that great.   Next time if I ever go here again, I will just order an appetizer and just eat the complimentary bread.  That's enough.  My hubby got a $14 burger.  I yelled at him.  He said he didn't realize his kobe burger was that much.  $14 for a freaking burger?  If he wanted a burger we could have gone to Burger King for a $3 burger.   Cheesecake Factory was and is a total waste of money.  Oh, and my kid's macaroni and cheese was absolutely miserable, greasy, and the pasta was undercooked and chewy.  We brought it home and miked it for my kid, and it had like 3 tablespoons of pure liquid oil/fat.  When I make home made/baked from scratch mac and cheese, I have never seen droplets let alone puddles of oil.   The only good thing is the cheesecake, which is light and airy and, which I bought on the way out.  No sense in adding it to the total bill so that I'd have to tip the guy more.  Anyways, our service was fast."
Wespen N.,"Arlington, VA",6,110,1,1.0,5/17/2012,"What the hell is this chain trying to be? They're catering to the family set, the bar set, the ""trendy, hip & modern"" set and the dessert crowd without being definitively one or another. I can see why Cheesecake Factory does well in mega-malls, but Clarendon? There are plenty of places that aren't horrifying corporate frankensteins that are within walking distance of Cheesecake Factory. There's no parking lot here, so you're going to be paying for parking one way or another, so why compound matters by going to a chain? I've been here a handful of times, and every time it's been loud. Loud Loud Loud. You don't have to shout to be heard, but you're pretty damn close. The food is palatable, but only because it hinges off the hack cooking technique of adding butter to everything. Paula Deen would be proud, I guess, but if I'm looking for greasy spoon-level food, I'm not looking for it to cost as much as it does here, nor am I looking for it to be presented in a goofy manner that some executive board thinks is ""haute cuisine."" Bah."
Viraj P.,"Philadelphia, PA",272,105,3,4.0,11/26/2013,"If you're looking for some suburban comfort, this is your joint. Everything is good with epic portions (if you plan it right, you could leave with lunch for the next two days!) and lots of flavor. The lemonades are *way* too sweet for my taste but will probably be great for the sugar addict in your life. Don't leave without getting some cheesecake- it's worth it."
Sonja B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,16,,2.0,6/30/2015,"Ate at the bar on Sunday and ordered the meatloaf entrée.   When my food came, I noticed there was only two pieces of meatloaf verses three that's usually served.   I then asked the bartender did they change the serving and she said, 'yes'.  Quite strange to me because I just had the exact same plate a couple days prior.  Asked for extra bread, it never came.  Our waiter/bartender was so inattentive to our needs."
Jimmeka T.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,10,,3.0,4/13/2014,Just as good as any other cheesecake factory. I had the veggie burger and I was pleasantly surprised that it appeared to not just be a frozen patty that was warmed up. They may have actually made them at the restaurant!  It was tasty and so was the cheesecake. I got the s'more cheesecake and it is definitely a good choice.  I only rated it a 3 because it was not any better than my other cheesecake factory experiences.
Erik P.,"Arlington, VA",12,33,8,1.0,3/23/2011,"I hate this place -- not just this location, pretty much all the Cheesecake factories are on par with each other. It seems like I try to give them the benefit of the doubt like once a year, then always leave saying ""im not going back there"".  Its overpriced, the service is terrible, the ambience/seating blows, and the food is decent but nothing to write home about. Last time (and this is a perfect example of any visit i have had), it took about 40 minutes to bring out our side salads.  It was obvious that the main courses were coming out too, so they put those under some hidden heat lamps until we were done with the salad, then brought out the main dishes.  One of the main dishes had salad with it to: NOTE to Cheesecake Staff: DO NOT place COLD Salads under a heat lamp!! This time we were seating right next to the lovely server computer where they ring everything in.  This was actually better than the usual: being sitting about 3 inches from someone you don't know. There are much better, nicer, more authentic places in this area to choose from. The cheesecake is pretty good, so i get it to go :)"
M M.,"Palm Beach, FL",135,49,10,5.0,2/29/2012,"I am always satisfied and happy when I visit any Cheesecake Factory, however, this past week my co-worker and I decided to visit Monday and yes Tuesday as well!! (We had quite a bit of Cheesecake overload the past 2 days) Both visits were great! We went in for lunch about 12:30 and to our surprise there was no busy lunch rush. We walked right decided to sit at one of the high top tables in the bar area and was greeted with our server immediately. Only downfall was that we were pressed on time and it took a little while for the food to cook. But you can always call in ahead of time and place your order so once you get there you can spend your time eating!! (The highlight of my day)  Overall, service was great, food was great and I always love the atmosphere. :)"
Mina G.,"Alexandria, VA",388,27,,1.0,4/10/2011,"I wanted to write an elaborate, funny, detailed review but it's early and I'm running on fumes from last night. So here's a basic review of the nastiness I had to endure at TCF. I got the shrimp scampi and the steak diane. The shrimp was overly breaded and there was barely any steak in the steak diane. Just a ton of mushy arse mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were decent I guess. Even my drink was gross. Can't remember what it was called but it was a hot drink with coffee, Bailey's and Kahlua. My BF got the meatloaf and all I could taste was a bunch of rosemary.  The only thing was half way decent about my meal was the little tapas style crabcakes and that's just 'cause I was super hungry. Oh and the banana cream cheesecake was superb. This is the kind of place you go to when you're dining with someone who is super picky and unadventurous when it comes to food. Otherwise....ewww."
Caitlin C.,"Alexandria, VA",18,63,24,1.0,6/19/2011,"This dining experience was not a great one. Overall the service and lack thereof was not good, the food was not great, and the atmosphere appeared beautiful but the lighting was wretched and depressing. I would have preferred an optional light at the table.  The portion size was good, but the food quality for the price was not. I think I could have cooked at home and enjoyed it better. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory. I really wanted to like you."
Jeff L.,"Arlington, VA",74,9,,5.0,3/25/2014,"I love coming to this place.  Yes it does get packed, and yes it can take a while but isn't that what every popular restaurant is like?  Food is great but even better is the decor and vibe when you walk in.  It feels like you are in an upscale Vegas restaurant even though you are in the heart of Clarendon.  Parking can be a little tight but besides that I love this place."
Rockelle M.,"Washington, DC",14,83,26,5.0,1/9/2014,"Artichoke dip, tomato - flatbread came out hot. Amazing Happy Hour too many apps and drinks to choose from. Adina and Joe were a great combo. Plates were removed immediately and drinks were everlasting. We live in G-Town but would make the drive for the food and service."
Tara F.,"Arlington, VA",10,41,1,4.0,3/22/2014,"So it is a chain (and I tend to be a chain snob); however I have always had great service. In addition, they are always accommodating to large groups. There is comfort in the continuity of their extensive menu and cheesecakes. I would suggest the avocado egg rolls, banana cream and red velvet cheesecakes."
