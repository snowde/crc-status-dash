Joseph D.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,5.0,9/17/2012,"I decided on a whim to try this place today; and it's a good thing I did!  To start, the waitress I had, was always smiling and cheerful, when I asked her for her opinion on an item, she had no problems telling me. She gets ******(6)stars for customer service! I ordered the ""Miso Salmon"" w/ white rice. Most Excellent!!! This dish paired well with the ""Tropical fruit smoothie"" that was recommended by the waitress. And then to top it off?! A delectable slice of their ""Pineapple upside-down"" cheesecake a-la-mode!!!!!"
Denise F.,"Santa Clara, CA",61,180,53,5.0,12/16/2010,"The review isn't really about cheesecake factory food as they are pretty standard across the country.  A group of 5 walked in on a Thursday night around 6:30pm and seated right away. The review I am writing is for our server Lamar Dawson. He was so polite, respectful and would always make sure we were smiling.  He was always very thoughtful in making sure we got enough bread, our water glasses were filled and cleared our dishes to make sure we had enough room for our entrees. He was really funny.  He would chat with us but not be overbearing.  Lamar was fantastic and I want the managers to know that!!! You should ask for Lamar Dawson. I know they don't honor all request but I would give it a shot! He's also very good looking. :)"
Claudia R.,"Alexandria, VA",8,17,1,2.0,3/22/2014,"I have been here a lot of times and I had really enjoy this place and their food.. But the last times I been here in different locations and the food is very lack of flavor the smoothies  were flavorless. I had some appetizer those were good but my ahi tuna was totally without flavor, my husband had a pasta and it was blend. Service was very good."
Justin W.,"Washington, DC",2,9,,5.0,2/18/2015,"We all have our ""staple"" restaurants. Our ""go-to"" places. Establishments that ""get it right"". Every. Single. Time. From the food, to the atmosphere to the server. The Cheesecake Factory in Clarendon, VA is one of mine. Tonight, Kaylyn served us. She was great. Everyone that I've ever been served by had been great. I love this. As long as they're standing, I'll be a returning patron."
Mike B.,"Charlotte, NC",74,106,2,4.0,3/24/2012,"Pretty good joint.  Keep in mind Cheesecake Factory has been named the #1 unhealthiest restaurant in America due to calories, saturated fat and sodium contents ( ). Good food that is reasonable priced.  Portions are HUGE!!! Only minor negative is when I was having lunch their today, I asked the server if cheese came on the ""Classic Burger"" after my burger was brought out.  Her response was, ""Oh you have to specify what kind of cheese you want...""  Come on!  Your not going to ask me what kind of cheese I want with my burger??!!!."
Sapna B.,"Ashburn, VA",27,189,329,3.0,8/18/2011,"I have been here several times but I've never been WOW-ed.  But I've had a good experience every time I've come and I've never experienced service that was lacking...and I've tried quite a few things: Drinks 1) White Sangria - I LOVED their sangria.  I think most wouldn't like it because it's fairly sweet, but I like the sweet fruity drinks so this was perfect for me.  Actually I think the wine was sparkling because I could taste the carbonation. 2) Ritz Martini - Good but I felt like the cointreau was overpowering...made it taste like there was Tequila in it. Appetizers 1) First of all, I could eat that wheat bread that they serve as my dinner.  It is delicious, especially with the butter. 2) Made-to-Order Guacamole - Delicious.  Wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it to be, but it was really good. 3) Thai Lettuce Wraps - These are fantastic.  They come with all the right ingredients and sauces and large leaves of lettuce.  This is huge so it should definitely be shared.  Actually my husband and I got these last night and didn't even order dinner, went right to dessert. Entrees 1) Chicken Madeira - I got this when I was on a diet and I remember it being pretty good and very low carb. 2) Weight Management Santa Fe Salad - I don't even know if the dressing is low fat, but it tastes like it is.  Other than that, I think this salad is pretty good given that it's ""weight management"" 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta - I love spicy food and this was delicious.  It still wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it to be, but it had a nice little kick and I love that the chicken was crusted in parmesan...added great flavor. 4) Thai Chicken Pasta - I remember that I got this once and the only reason I didn't get it again was because it was so good that I KNOW I would overeat if I got it again!  This is a perfect combination of like Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. 5) Garlic Noodles - Sounds good but very boring and bland. Cheesecake 1) Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG this is amazing.  I wish it were a LITTLE heavier on the red velvet cake instead of the cheesecake but this is amazing.  And if you get a bite with those little white chocolate chip shavings on the back...heaven. 2) Hershey Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - This is a new cheesecake and it's amazing.  This is death by chocolate.  Very rich so I could only eat a little bit but on the upside that means my $7 cheesecake will last for four days. 3) Tiramisu Cheesecake - Delicious and very much tastes like Tiramisu. 4) Brownie Sundae Cheesecake - This is good but with all the chocolate and fudge, it really should be accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 5) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake - Good but not wow.  The pieces of cookie dough were too big. 6) Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - Death by chocolate again.  Really rich but delicious.  I'm a choco-holic."
Shamika F.,"Arlington, VA",175,24,28,3.0,12/5/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is not what it used to be, but it'll do in a pinch. The drinks are usually watered down, so it's best to stick with wine or champagne. The food at the Clarendon location usually comes out luke warm and not very flavorful, so I don't really bother anymore. I popped in the other night to meet a friend in the area for a drink and had a couple of glasses of champagne (because they can't mess that up). The bartenders were great considering how busy they were. Overall it was a pleasant experience but that had more to do with my companion then the restaurant. It's The Cheesecake Factory so I'll inevitably be back for one reason or the other. It's a crap shoot on whether the service, the food, or the drinks will be good- but one way or the other I'll be back."
Joe S.,"Washington, DC",198,310,13,2.0,6/10/2013,"I've just never really been a fan of TCF. It's not you, it's me. I am usually afraid to order anything. Granted, the last time in, my salmon was good. It just had such a heavy butter based sauce on the rice and the sugary glaze on the salmon was just too much. Let the food sing on it's own."
Marj H.,"Hope Mills, NC",4,51,,2.0,6/27/2013,"I wanted to try on of the Rays places on Wilson, but dang, they must be running incognito.  I drove around down there for a good 30 minutes and never saw one.  So, we settled for the Cheesecake Factory.   We got there a little late, around 9:40, and waited about ten minutes at the hostess station for someone to come seat us.  There was no one else waiting at that time.  Beautiful place!  The hostess took us to a table, ducking under low hanging bushes to get there.   The table was preset for four, so my granddaughter and I stood aside as the hostess quickly removed the two extra place settings, but didn't bother to move the remaining silver ware, plates etc to a more convenient position.   That's when I noticed we didn't have any napkins.   We sat for another 10 minutes until a server stopped by and dropped off the menu's, and took our drink order.  That's when I noticed we didn't have any sugar, sweetener, etc on our table.    Our drinks were delivered, and I asked for sugar.  He turned to the server station right next to our table and took out the little box full of sweeteners, then plopped it on the table with a little attitude.  Hmmmmm.   I used all four packs of sugar for my tea, (they have really big glasses!).  While I was fixing my tea, were were given a basket of flat bread.  At least that's what I thought it was, but after seeing other diners breads, I realized that whoever sliced my bread just mashed it all flat in the process.  It was still OK though.  Our server came back to take our order and I asked for some napkins.  He reached behind him and produced a little stack of cocktail napkins, again slapping them down on the table...   Hmmmmmmmm.... We ordered Alfredo pasta and steak and fries.    Twenty minutes later, we got our meals.   Nothing special, I have had a lot better for a lot less and didn't have to put up with the attitude.   The folks beside us seemed to have some problems, too.  Steak not cooked as ordered and one appetizer missing (later comped).   And the customer seemed to not like the server's attitude and it must have showed.  The manager came out to talk to those folks.      Our drinks were filled as needed, although it took almost 10 minutes for the guy to take my glass out to the kitchen and then bring it back...   So....  not all that impressed I'm sorry to say.   The dessert case did look AMAZING!!!!"
Bonnie M.,"Washington, DC",0,21,2,4.0,10/22/2013,"I know that a lot of people don't like chain restaurants, and I usually have my doubts, too, but this Cheesecake Factory has not disappointed me during any of the three times I've been here during the last five months (well except that someone was a little skimpy on one of my glasses of wine once). I love that the menu is so extensive!  And, my food has always been fresh and served up in a generous portion. The waiters/waitresses have always been friendly and have not tried to rush me out after finishing my meal. My biggest complaint about this place (but not necessarily this location) is how busy it gets and how much time one has to wait for a table.  (The one in Waikiki is insane.  You must go super early!)"
LD S.,"Alexandria, VA",76,60,,3.0,5/9/2014,"Food is good and consistent and we all know what the cheesecake factory formula is.  Big Menu plenty of selections.  Drinks are too sweet.  Most Items have too much sugar or salt.  But that is what the public wants I suppose.  I will go there once in a while, because it is totally predicable."
Bryan P.,"Clarendon, Arlington, VA",0,23,5,2.0,11/16/2013,I swear this location must give bonuses for not giving out brown bread.  This time at 6pm on a Saturday I didn't get my bread until after the meal came.  The two customers next to me had to ask for bread after they saw me eating mine.   Why is this location so stingy on something so cheap?
Vonetta Y.,"Washington, DC",207,588,1,2.0,6/11/2010,"It didn't seem like that bad an idea at the time. I was hungry, so was my friend, so we figured why the hell not.  I got the chicken enchiladas since I'd been dyyying for enchiladas for days. Our server set the plate down in front of me and said, ""Be careful--the plate's pretty hot."" She touched it by accident and said, ""Oh, it's not bad."" And that would be because the food itself was pretty lukewarm (we waited quite a while for the food, so I figured that would happen). And lukewarm enchiladas are no bueno. By the the middle of the second one, my appetite was gone, but I forced myself to shove down the rest.  Not all was bad about the experience, though. The server was quite nice (but I think she may have been new because we did wait a really long time for our food), and my friend's crab appetizer looked pretty good, but being allergique, I only looked.  Meh. I'll stick with other choices around Clarendon next time. Even if some of them are pricier, the food's bound to be better."
Chris C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",74,9,,1.0,9/26/2010,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory with such poor service! The waiters seemed annoyed that they had to bring us our food.  Our specific waitress barely checked on us and the place wasn't busy at all.  At one point in the meal, we all needed refills on drinks and the waitress didn't seem to notice. Whether it was an alcoholic beverage or a simple glass of soda, we had to ask for a new drink each time. This was the second time my family had been to this location and this experience was only slightly better than the first time.  It's clear this terrible service is not just a random occurrence.  Not sure what is going on here, but I will never visit this location again."
Victor M.,"Falls Church, VA",0,3,,2.0,5/18/2014,"This particular one we went to was on/off. The service was bad, the food wasn't cooked fully, the waiter was rude and inattentive, the food, when it was cooked fully was ok tho. For the future I will most likely not come back."
Oliver R.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,69,41,4.0,4/1/2013,I stopped in on a Monday night for dinner and sat at the bar. Allison the bartender is great. The service was quick and friendly. The food was great as usual. I'll be back again soon.
Juichia C.,"Atlanta, GA",451,227,175,1.0,11/10/2009,"Why??? Why there are always lines out the doors of this Cheesecake Factory still remains a big puzzle in my life. Come on, people, have better taste. The food sucks, and it still sucks even if they halved the price. I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to. If you go there for anything else other than the cheesecake.... I don't know what to say!"
Leila E.,"Arlington, VA",9,37,7,5.0,9/4/2011,"I have been here a few times with my husband and last couple of times, we had great services.  we like to get salads and min dishes since the  plates are huge and we are always happy with the selections. Tonight specially was the best since i ordered from skinny menu and i really enjoyed my healthy Salmon. Our waiter Jeff also was the best so far. We have had a girl who kept forgetting things before but Jeff made all the difference :)"
Philip T.,"Washington, DC",70,179,112,1.0,10/21/2011,"I'm usually a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but tonight's experience was among the worst dining experiences I've ever had to endure. The problem here didn't lie in the with the food, which, like most other Cheesecake Factories I've been to, was average, but rather the service. This isn't reflective of the traditional style of review I do for Yelp, but it's something that I feel should be told for the benefit of others who come here. If you come to the Clarendon location and your server is Jay, run. I repeat, RUN. A group of friends and I came as part of a birthday dinner in which we were hoping for a generally quiet and comfortable meal. After taking our orders, we ended up waiting for almost an hour before our food came out, and after which, he never came back to check on us. The restaurant was busy, so we just shrugged it off not thinking much about it. Once we got to dessert, we ordered to-go since we had been waiting for so long which only seemed to annoy him, grumbling as he walked away. At this point, things were starting to really go down. When our desserts finally came, we found out he got an order wrong. When I noted the wrong order, he began to argue with me saying how I ""mislead him"" and then tried to guilt trip me with ""fine, I'll just have to pay for it then"". Excuse me? Really? Next came billing. At the beginning of the evening, we had asked him if we could do separate checks which he had agreed to; however, when we finally got to the end of the meal, he had ignored us and tried to convince us otherwise so he could get out of having to do work. I kid you not, his words were ""It would be less work for ME if you guys just split the check yourselves."" Sorry, but I'm pretty sure it's YOUR job, Jay, not the customers. In the end, we agreed to just split it up on cards and we did the math since we had already spent more time there than we initially had planned. He told us since we were a larger group to just include the tip in our per-card totals. As all was done, we were getting ready to leave once we got our checks back. When the first three receipts came back, we realized that something was wrong. The totals we wrote down, which included the tips, were not there, but rather, he had added an additional 18% tip to the totals that already had the 18% mandatory gratuity added. By the time we noticed this mistake, we also caught another mistake. The wrong dessert order from earlier in the night was still on the check in addition to the proper dessert order, essentially double charging us for one dessert. Needless to say, we were furious. When we brought the tipping issue to his attention, he said it was too late to reverse the transactions (I call BS) and that we would have to recalculate the totals to reflect the tip he was adding in even though he explicitly told us to include the tip in our totals from the start. Between the three checks he already completed, he scammed us out of approximately $14, god knows how much more he could have if we didn't catch it until later. After recalculating our totals, note, we had been working on the bill for over half an hour now, we finally gave the bill with the new per-card totals back to him. He then told us that he couldn't do it because the tax wouldn't be able to calculate (the hell?). When asked why, his story quickly changed and he went off to process the checks never revisiting the issue again. After about 45 minutes of struggling through this debacle, we finally were able to leave. In all honesty, if a restaurant hires such an incompetent employee with such immoral and unethical practices, they don't deserve our, or anyone else's business."
Jewell N.,"Hollywood, FL",1,5,,2.0,8/20/2013,"Okay, so obviously the Cheesecake Factory, has the best cheesecake, by far, but the service at this place was not good at all. The server, was not attentive at all, and he was a bit rude. We ordered a bottle of wine which we didn't get till almost 15 minutes later after we ordered it...and it was a little after 10pm when we sat down. What made me angry about this was that, we were also waiting on more bread, so when we asked the server, can we get our wine and our bread, his response was, it's going to be a while. This did not make us happy. This server made our dinning experience so awkward and dreadful. But I guess this is the problem with corporate restaurants, they make enough money so they don't have to strive for excellent service, seems like they forget about what matters....the guest."
