Matthew H.,"Alexandria, VA",20,54,8,4.0,2/22/2013,"I've never had a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory! The buffalo blasts are really really good - and they have great ranch dressing too. Portions are HUGE so you can share with 1 or 2 people and eat a proper portion. Cheesecakes are great too, albeit a little too sweet. Desserts are large portions too."
Nicole P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",39,64,21,3.0,12/1/2007,"This particular cheesecake factory was... just like all the others! (big surprise) First the good: Our server was awesome.  His name was Rob, and I wish that I could hire him for the company that I work for.  He was very attentive, great sense of humor, and was able to recommend/dissuade us about particular dishes. Now the bad:  Long waits. (Glad my friends got there first and I could just sit, haha), dark atmosphere.  Too, too dark.  What the heck am I eating again?  Too dark in the bathroom (did the last person miss or something?).  And the mojito was crap.  Really, really bad mojito.  I also ordered a ""Georgia Peach,"" which was quite tasty, but I seriously doubt there was any alcohol in it (I had three drinks and no buzz -- and I'm a lightweight.  This drink really did not have any alcohol in it). *sigh*  As I said... just like every other cheesecake factory.  Except for our server, Rob -- which is why they got a 3 instead of a 2. *edit* I emailed a copy of this review, slightly edited, to the cheesecake factory, and in turn, they mailed me a $10 gift card to try them again.  While this doesn't mean that the quality of their food improved at all (and therefore, I'm not changing my star rating), I'm certainly much more inclined to go back!  Maybe next time the Georgia Peach might have some vodka in it, as they claim!  =)"
chrissy s.,"Waldorf, MD",22,28,13,4.0,5/21/2013,"I love their small plates and appetizers best. Thats how we do CF now. We order 4-6 small plates and share. The chicken samosas, crispy crab bites, polenta fries and fried dumplings are favorites. The Vietnamese tacos and roasted artichokes are just bad. The tacos are soggy and the artichokes have zero flavor.  Like, they roasted them with a little oil and nothing else, not even salt. Of course, the cheesecake is great. I try to try a different one each time. Polite staff in our experiences."
Jamie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,46,8,2.0,6/29/2010,"Obscenely heavy mediocre food (check out their 1600 cal guacamole appetizer  ). This chain, and others like it, should probably finance half of the healthcare bill. Don't get me wrong, I believe in indulging sometimes, but for all that, their food is only meh.  Also, my firm gets delivery from here every week via takeout taxi, and I think they've gotten my order right about 25% of the time, which is one of the many reasons I stopped patronizing them."
Annabelle S.,"Alexandria, VA",6,2,,1.0,2/19/2011,"This chain is mediocre at best - but this location takes the cake for bad service. I met friends at the bar on a Sunday night around 7pm - we were waiting on a party of about 10-11 people to have a surprise birthday dinner. We are well aware of the practice of not seating until the party has arrived in it's entirety so we had a drink & waited - with the understanding that we would be sat once 10 arrived & the 11th was the birthday girl. Our estimated wait time was AN HR TO AN HR AND A HALF! This should have been my first red flag; having managed a restaurant I know tables flip in 30-45 & any self-respecting place is not quoting 1hr+ wait times on a Sunday night. Everyone but the birthday girl had arrived by 8:45 - at this point our buzzer had not gone off. When we approached the hostess, she told us it would be another 20 minutes. That would put our total wait time at OVER 2 hours. A friend spotted several tables that would seat us & I asked a manager who was now at the hostess stand if there was any way we could get one sooner since the whole point of us being there was for it to be a *surprise*. She brushed me off & told me it would be at least 15 minutes.  Bottom line - I basically had to beg for us to be sat in less than 2 hours. Tables were being held  (because servers had been cut?) This on top of the mediocre service - no refills on drinks, slow, slow, slow service & the debacle of splitting checks - makes me NEVER want to return to any location of this chain - but this one takes the cake for WTF service!"
Timothy P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,7,,4.0,4/28/2010,"I have never been to the Cheesecake Factory, but I have heard the rumors regarding the size of the portions served. I am here to tell you, the rumors are true! Every member of my party (4 persons) left with a box containing enough food for another meal. Since we went on a Sunday, all of us had a lunch ready to go for the following workday.  For appetizers we had an order of the Roadside Sliders (4 delicious mini burgers) and the Avocado Egg rolls (4 portions of egg-rolly, avocado-ee goodness). I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken and my lovely spouse ordered the Chicken Madeira.  The Madeira was listed the their most popular chicken dish. It consisted of sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese. Covered with fresh mushroom Madeira sauce and served with mashed potatoes. It was very good, my wife really enjoyed it. I thought is was good, but the flavors were too mild for my taste.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken was great! While the menu states it is a very spicy Mandarin-style dish, it was not overly spicy. When I order it next time, I will ask them to step it up a notch with regards to HEAT. This was served with green onions and roasted cashews over rice.  It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty wide open. The service was fine and the price was reasonable given the amount of food and the location. Overall, a very good experience and I have no qualms about a return visit!"
Kelly E.,"Arlington, VA",0,3,,3.0,5/6/2013,"! I have visited a few other Cheesecake establishments and this one was just here here. The decorations are great and they are consistent with their architecture and deco.  As always, the cheesecake a the cheesecake factory is delicious! But the costumer service needed help. The host was nor warm or welcoming. She did not smile or offer  a Hello.  Our server also was not friendly.  She took our order in a very nonchalent ok ok way. After I ordered she would walk around to other tables. I made eye contact with her three times to symbol to come back. She blatantly ignored and walked on. It needed help. The food was excellent. The service was not so much."
Robin S.,"Herndon, VA",32,383,,4.0,8/30/2010,"I adore the Cheesecake Factory!!! I am usually HIGHLY critical of chains, but this is one I can't get enough of.  The food is fresh and delicious, with leftovers for dinner.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait (!!!) I would give five stars except that the service was painfully slow considering that it was not so crowded."
Courtney R.,"Arlington, VA",351,489,30,3.0,6/10/2009,"My life sucks. It must, otherwise why would the first time I try Kobe beef be here? I've been to CF hundreds of times, all over the place. I'm not gonna lie, I love their crab wonton. I was unaware they had a Kobe burger until my friend ordered one. I love burgers, and this one was pretty decent. I ate the whole thing. The refills were flowin' and our waitress was on top of her game. It's freezing in there. The menu is huge. I don't love it, but like I said, I've been to the establishment oodles of times. I have a soft spot for this location though, because last time I was here (about four years ago) I bought a car off our waiter for $400. Sweetles."
Jim W.,"Alexandria, VA",48,263,26,4.0,7/4/2012,"So, hubby and I both had the grilled salmon.  A good choice.  Tasty and definitely hit the spot."
Anna D.,"Birmingham, AL",20,173,4,4.0,6/16/2009,"One thing is for sure about Cheesecake Factory: No matter what you order, you're going to get a lot of food. So, instead of complaining about how much food they serve you, be thankful that you're given a large portion so you can easily take half of it home for another meal or two. You're buying 2-3 meals for the price of one (at totally affordable prices), and that should make you and your wallet happy. Anyway, I have been to CF many, many times. It was once my favorite restaurant because their menu can satisfy just about any craving. American, Asian, Italian, whatever you desire, they just might have it here. I have probably tried everything on their pasta menu, as well as a few of their specialties. Their chicken piccata and, despite reading about its exorbitant sodium content, the stuffed chicken tortillas remain my favorites. Don't be afraid to come here for dessert if you don't like cheesecake. Their not-cheesecake dessert menu offers everything from a goblet of strawberries to rich, spongy layered cake."
Chris J.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2013,I went here for dinner with a friend last night and all I can say is wow that was some of the worst service I've had and the worst food I have tasted in a very long time. Starting with drinks when our server asked what kettle one was for a extra dirty martini we both stared at her shocked.. She then asks us how to spell kettle one!! Are u kidding me??!! Then when the extra dirty martini comes out it is very clear that its a regular dirty martini as both my date and I work at 2 different bars so we have to ask for extra olive juice that takes the server almost 10 minutes to bring out in a shot ass that has clearly been dropped and is chipped and has a crack going down half of the glass. As for ordering food this server comes up to our table not 2 minutes after we open our menus to see if we are ready... No shit were not ready sifting through 15 pages of adds mixed into their menu figuring out what we want... We get our apps some salad and Thai wrap both were the only good thing about the whole experience but then our entrees show up and they take our Thai wrap before we are done with it.. Wtf is wrong with u people ask if we are done before u take our plates.  Entrees .... How can I describe the worst food we have had in a long time.. She got the gumbo and nothing about it said gumbo the rice was completely over cooked  nothing on her plate was cooked properly and it was not thick like gumbo should be and she ate the chicken out of it and left the rest saying if she had a dog she wouldn't even feed the leftovers to him... As for me I had the shrimp scampi and how hard it is to cook pasta with some sort of flavor?? ..not hard at all I do it at home all the time but wow this was the most bland pasta and over cooked I have ever tasted ... And deep fried shrimp ..really if u want good scampi try sautéing them or grilling them instead  Dessert.. Cheesecake of course and at least they got that right .. Maybe this is all they should carry because clearly that's the only thing they can make correctly Service... Holy crap our server should go back to training and honestly probably never serve I finished my first drink around our apps and set my ass at the end of table clear that it was empty and she never once cleared it or asked if I would care for another I'm not going to beg u for alcohol so she missed out on me having at least 3 drinks And same goes for my friend she finished her drink and the glass was just left there through dinner.. So fuck it we drank water and planned to get drinks elsewhere with friends ... As for the water I don't think there is a water shortage but for some reason our water glasses stayed empty for half of the dinner before we had to ask for water and that took her 5 minutes at least to get and we were one of maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Overall I would never go back there are many other places in Clarendon that are so much better and honestly I would rather eat at Taco Bell Mc Donald's or any other fast food joint before I step foot back in Cheesecake Factory
H B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,19,,4.0,12/29/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory's food is the Cheesecake Factory's food - it's slightly better than most big chains but is otherwise not extraordinary in any way. I'll give the place 3 starts, but 1/2 of 1 of those stars is just because the menu is so huge.  I'm giving 4 stars for this visit because our server (Christina M.) was so great. It was the day after Christmas and we had just had a very unpleasant customer service experience while trying to so a movie, so we were not in a good mood when we sat down. But Christina M. was so pleasant and so very on top of things that it sort of turned our day around. So thanks for that, Christina M., and next time I want an easy meal without a bunch of melodrama I will definitely consider dropping in again."
Josh M.,"Denver, CO",0,23,29,5.0,12/22/2011,"I tried to stay away from Cheese Cake Factory as long as possible after moving to Arlington.  Every Cheese Cake Factory that I have been to in the US has been ok to subpar with regards to wait, service and food.   I honestly believe that this place is run by good management and for that reason I find myself writing a review to counter all those 1 star winers out there. My girlfriend and I had been visiting various restaurants around the Court House, Clarendon area over the past couple months and in general I will say that service has been usually subpar to terrible.  I can honestly say after traveling the US and living outside Arlington, that this city has a general corner on seemingly un-interested wait staff in general. We eventually decided to give the Cheese Cake Factory a go and were highly impressed. First, we usually go out to dinner around 6pm to 7:30pm.   We have never had to wait a single minute to get a table.  I can say that this place gets really busy around 7:30pm onwards, and if you choose to go to dinner late, you will need to accept the inevitable wait.  That's the way it is, this is a highly populated city folks. Everytime we visit, our waiter/waitress has always been prompt, friendly, helpful, refills our drinks and in general much better than your average restaurant in the area. The food is also generally very good.  You will find better food elsewhere (generally for more money), but for the price you pay and the service you get, I honestly dont think you can get any better. My girlfriend really did not want like this place.  To her, the Cheese Cake Factory represents your average terrible chain restaurant (similar to Chili's and Applebees).   Yet, everytime we go, she acknowledges with hesitation that this place is slowly becoming our go-to restaurant. I cannot comment on the 1 star reviews from those that did not like the way their shrimp was breaded or that they couldn't split a check with 25 people, but I can say that if you want great service, good food and some of the best atmosphere in Arlington, go to the Cheese Cake Factory."
Michele L.,"Washington, DC",200,257,223,4.0,8/23/2011,"Amazing martinis, good food, and OK service. Didn't have to wait long to get seated. Even for a Friday night."
Jake S.,"Washington, DC",42,145,7,3.0,2/11/2010,"As the epic snowstorm of 2010 was just hitting its stride, we were already apeshit stir-crazy, so we decided to go somewhere to eat. Being unable to agree on anything, we decided to pick the place with the biggest menu that we could walk to, and CF won out.  We both had the buffalo chicken sandwich (weirdly enough, since we couldn't agree on anything 5 minutes prior), and it turned out to be quite delicious. The chicken was moist (hehe, funny word), the breading was crisp, and the sauce was good. The drinks were just ok; 5.50 is an insane price for a heniekin light, but it's light years cheaper than the 11 dollar pomegranate margarita I ordered next. The margarita was delicious, but definitely not worth 11 bucks.  CF is a good middle-of-the-road place if you can't figure out what to eat, as they have several types of cuisine on their 100+ item menu. None of it could be mistaken for gourmet, but it's decidedly better than many other chain restaurants that have novel-sized menus. I wouldn't recommend staying here for drink after drink though, as the prices are insane, so eat up and then go elsewhere for your post-dinner libations."
Peter K.,"Arlington, VA",8,90,7,3.0,1/30/2012,"It is what it is.  And my young daughter loves to go there for her birthday.  I'm surprised how consistently good the food is, despite the large menu and large crowds."
Bryan P.,"Alexandria, VA",8,101,61,4.0,7/5/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory always has an extensive menu of great inventive dishes at reasonable prices. The Chicken Madeira is one of my favorite chain restaurant meals! The portions are huge, so I almost always have a doggie bag of leftovers to take with me. I have always had good, attentive service there. I love cheese and I love cake, but was never really into Cheesecake... but give the Reece's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. It's quite decadent (just don't be on a diet)!"
Justin G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,165,130,4.0,3/9/2012,"I love the Cheesecake factory.  This is one of a pretty big chain and it is just as good as any I have been to.  The waitstaff was good for me, but definitely there is a wait for a table if you hit the rush.  The portions are so big, my girlfriend and I often go and split an appetizer and one dish."
Michael S.,"Alexandria, VA",25,95,1,4.0,3/19/2009,"You know, Cheesecake Factory isn't getting much love here on Yelp. At least not this location. I've always been a fan of the ol' factory of cheesecake (Shit, that was horrible writing). Yes, there is always a curiously odd amount of time to kill in waiting for seating to open up at any of the Cheesecake Factories I've been too. But, you know what? They're always around some kind of shopping or places you can at least window shop. Plan for it. Quit bitching. Its just not a place to get a quick bite.  Their menu is pretty large, I've never had anything I didn't like. Their appetizers play it a little too safe with the same kind of stuff you see in most restaurants. The entrees are gigantic and you'll definitely have enough for a substantial lunch the next day. The cheesecakes pretty tasty too. There isn't anything remarkable or inventive about this place, but hey, I like the food, I've always had a good meal served and the service has always been pretty good, though I think whoever thought that the servers wearing all white was a good idea...might have a drinking problem."
