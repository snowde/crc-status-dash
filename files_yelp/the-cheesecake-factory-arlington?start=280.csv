Christine R.,"Fairfax, VA",257,415,75,2.0,5/25/2009,"I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once before (Tysons Corner location) many, many, manyyyyy years ago. All I could remember was that the portion of my meal was disgustingly huge, it tasted average (meaning it would only suffice as a good meal if I were raging drunk and had nothing else to eat at 5am), and always seemed crowded with a wait. So when a friend asked me to join her for dinner there I just shrugged all those vague memories off and decided to go and give it a second chance. Bad decision. I ended up getting a Cuban sandwich partially because it was the first thing I saw on the menu and I didn't feel like reading through 15 pages of items and I had my first ""Cuban"" sandwich this past winter at Liberty - which was awesome. The sandwich was huge. So big that I couldn't finish half of it. Why are your meals so large CCF? WHY? Not only was the meal so big but about an hour after leaving to go home I started to get a horrible stomach ache and swore off CCF for life right then and there. BUT on the up side our server was a doll. He was sweet, quick, and catered to our every whim. I just don't get why this place is so popular. Am I missing something?"

Mo C.,"Denver, CO",528,804,72,4.0,4/16/2009,"Just fantastic! The wait wasn't bad, the service was great, the food was spectacular. So, I'm sure many of you have had the experience at Cheesecake Factory where you get to wait for an hour for a table for two, let alone a table for six. Well, we rolled in at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night with our table of six, prepared to sit at the bar and wait for our table. We were told 30min, but were probably seated in 15 (hell yea!). Now, I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a while, but apparently in addition to their famous novel-sized menu, they have an additional specials augmentation. Good lord that's a lotta food. I ordered a breaded chicken dish with basil pasta from the specials menu and the fried cheese. My beer arrived, tall & cold. My fried cheese with marinara dipping sauce was great and enjoyed by all at the table. My friends dishes arrived. I was asked what I was waiting for and I said ""something with chicken"" because they always get a little too creative with their dishes names for me to remember them. My chicken arrived, with a strange pile of arugula salad on top of it, a bacon sized slice of procuitto and a pile of angel hair pasta with a basil and olive oil sauce. The salad on top was weird, but good. The chicken was fantastic and the pasta was very good, but too much to handle.  The thai shrimp across the table got mixed reviews in that it was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough. When spicier sauce was requested, tabasco arrived (boo!). Our server was quite persistent about the cheesecake menu after our meal, even though we were quite full. He teased us with the pictures and descriptions until I gave in. I picked out a piece of cheesecake to go and was told by the server, ""that's all I really wanted, was for you to take a little piece of me home"". Ok, that sounds creepy in print, but it was actually quite funny.  We were offered split checks without any whining from our server (this is quite uncommon in my experience). In fact, he suggested that we would have an easier time splitting the bill if we received split checks.  Unfortunately, this review loses one star because after that whole production about the cheesecake, my cheesecake never found it's way to the table, but at least I wasn't charged for it either."
Monica W.,"Arlington, VA",15,15,,4.0,7/15/2011,"I work across the street from here, they do wonderfully for lunch.  The service is great, and they have reasonably priced lunch sized portions for a lot of their entrees. They have a very large menu, which is quite helpful if you're with a large group.  They have a little of everything, and of course, wonderful dessert. I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and the food is quite good.   If you do go for dinner, especially on a weekend, expect there to be a substantial wait."
Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",280,192,83,3.0,11/12/2011,"This was an interesting dining experience but probably my least favorite Cheesecake Factory experience so far in the DC area. The Nitty Gritty- (1) The wait wasn't bad at all for a Sunday evening at the Cheesecake Factory. Which was a positive for me. And I was surprised to find that there is actually lot parking available at this location. (+1) (2) The drink I had I really liked. I can't even really remember what it was. It was some tropical something that I wanted to try. But it wasn't a martini and it was sort of frozen. Overall a very good drink. And I've never been disappointed by the drinks at any Cheesecake Factory! The whole wheat bread here is also really really really good!! OH! I love it. And of course the strawberry cheesecake never does me wrong. (+2) (3) The service was a little weird. First, they forgot the chicken out of my chicken and shrimp meal. I'm not sure how that even happens. Then someone who I thought was a manager came over and asked me if I minded and if I wanted my chicken on the side. I politely declined but 10 mins later a different guy who wasn't my waiter was apologizing and dropping off the chicken. Obviously this didn't kill me but I was very confused by it. (-1) (4) I usually order the same 3 or 4 things and rotate but I decided to step outside of my box and try the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (or something like that). It was supposed to have Thai flavors. But I didn't appreciate that it had peas because I hate peas and didn't remember reading that in the description. And overall it just failed as a Thai dish. I will NOT be ordering this again because frankly its not good. (-1)"
Ned F.,"Washington, DC",0,129,,1.0,5/4/2010,"Sunday 2pm. As we were waiting to be seated by our waitress, another table of four got seated before us outside. Does that even make sense? Waiter was an ass. We received our food after the table of four that showed up after us, finished their food. A club sandwich and pasta.  That shouldn't take 45 minutes to prep on a slow Sunday afternoon. I've eaten there three times. There is always a wait.  The wait staff doesn't care. You get big servings but you also pay for them $12-14 per plate.  When people say generous portions, it's because you are paying for it.  If you are an older couple or a teenager, then you would think you are getting a deal b/c you are getting leftovers for two days.   Newsflash: it's noodles. You're obviously not paying for service, so what are you paying for?"
Doug L.,"Fairfax, VA",6,28,,2.0,1/29/2009,"We came here as a last meal before our baby came. Cheesecake Factory ""CF"" wouldn't exactly be my first choice, but since I wasn't going to be doing the hard work, I didn't object.  Now, ever since eating fish tacos out in cali, I've been obsessed in finding comparable fish tacos out east; however, the one's I find tend to be made with fried fish, but while they are ok, they are not the kind I like.  But, much to my surprise and joy, I found that the CF in philly served fish tacos just like the ones I had in cali, and my love for CF began.  That was in philly.  That was several years ago. This is virginia.  This is now.  I ordered my beloved fish tacos.  Let me go back and explain that the fish tacos that I love are made out of this light, flaky fish and I believe that it is baked, not fried.  The fish tacos that I got from CF were tough and rubbery and dry and felt and tasted like chicken.  In fact, I was so convinced that it was chicken that I asked our server if they accidently gave me chicken tacos.  Nope, it was fish (supposedly) and he was sure.  I'm really curious as to what kind of fish so resembles chicken like that - maybe overcooked tuna?  I should have asked, oh well.  I've also tried the fish tacos at the tyson's CF with the same kind of mystery fish coming out.  Anyway, my quest for fish tacos begins again.  My love for CF has ended. My wife got some kind of salad with chicken, and it was ok.  Her dish - 3 stars, mine 2 stars, average = 2.5 stars, because I'm writing the review, rounds down to 2 stars. Side note:  I wonder why CF gives such huge portions of food.  By the time you're full, you've only eaten half your plate and you can't even think about eating dessert despite holding onto a menu in anticipation of choosing what kind of cheesecake you want to eat.  I would think, given their name, that they would serve normal sized portions at slightly lower prices so that people would be more likely to buy a slice of their overpriced cheesecake.  But that's just my thinking."
Ala M.,"Arlington, VA",1,57,,1.0,9/30/2012,"The meals just don't compare with local (rather than chain) restaurants, and the calories in each meal are ridiculously high."
Justin L.,"Arlington, VA",19,293,4,2.0,7/16/2009,"Pretty terrible experience here last night. I don't normally patronize chain restaurants like this but when I do, I expect a fairly standard, even forgettable experience. That's the best I ever hope for, but the service at this place was so poor it inspired me to register an account on here. It's the type of bad service that you can't even blame the actual servers for because they don't even realize how rude they are being. The problem is clearly with management and a lack of training, so it's not really the waiter or hostess' fault.  We walked in around 10:30 pm hoping to get a quick appetizer and dessert and be out in less than 45 minutes. It took a good 10 minutes to be even noticed and about a half hour just to get our food. We had to request cutlery. Midway through our meal the waiter asked if we would like to order dessert ""because they were closing."" This was maybe 10 minutes after their stated closing time, with loads of people around us still eating their meals. It's not as if we came in with a large group of people at 10:59 and ordered a huge amount of food. It was just 2 of us, and the reason we were still there at that point was because of their own slow and inadequate service. As we were finishing up, a large group of guys who were clearly not patrons (the cleaning crew, perhaps?) sat all around us, adding to the GTFO vibe we had already experienced from the waiter.  The food itself was fine and forgettable, which saves the place from a 1 star rating."
Emanon V.,"Arlington, VA",0,66,,2.0,3/5/2011,"I like this chain and particularly one of their salads which I get at least once a month and its so big it lasts for days. I went in about mid afternoon on a Saturday - it wasn't busy - put in a carry out order totaling about $25 and said I'd wait in the bar area - have done this before at the same location.  Shortly after I sat at a bar table a waiter came up and I told him I was waiting for my to go order  to which he replied that there were benches in the lobby for that and that the area I was sitting in was for paying customers - if I hadn't been so taken back, I would have told him that given I'd just spent about $25 that I WAS a paying customer but left the area and asked to see the manager.  The manager agreed that this is not the image they wanted to portray and we tried to find the server but he was MIA. In order for me to go to this location, I have to drive about 20 minutes and pay for parking - and this particular day passed over two other places that were closer and that had free parking."
S L.,"McLean, VA",1,5,,4.0,4/14/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is an awesome place if you are looking for a wide selection of entrees, including ""skinny"" entrees that are below a certain number of calories, wait staff who are attentive and friendly, and an upbeat atmosphere.  I especially love their margarita pizza and roasted artichokes. Their cheesecake is to die for. There are a few negatives, including the fact that they don't take reservations so you may have to wait over an hour for a table from time to time, and the place can be rather noisy.  But, overall, it's a great place to share a reasonably priced meal with friends and family."
Nesma A.,"Kensington, MD",0,1,,5.0,4/2/2012,I love the cheese cake factory because it has a  lot of very very good food. I think that you will like it because it's food is really filling.
Ahmed B.,"Rockville, MD",0,5,,3.0,1/30/2014,Its hit and miss. Sometimes great service and great food. Sometimes decent service and decent food.
Disree A.,"Reston, VA",0,6,,3.0,2/19/2014,"I decided to try this cheesecake factory location with a friend of mine. Great location that it is metro accessible and the menu has variety of dishes to choose from. Personally, I have always loved their food and keep coming back for the delicious food than anything else. The worse part at many of the location is the servers won't stop at your table. I waited almost 15 minutes before someone would come and take an order. The main course came earlier than the side dish. I thought the side dish comes before the main course? Maybe I am wrong and they do it completely opposite here. My disappointment came when I heard they had discontinued the white bean hummus. I would always order this particular side item over any other side item. Overall great food, but very poor service. I do not think a customer should be left waiting for their order to be taken after 15 minutes or more from the time they walk into the restaurant."
Nichole F.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,4,,2.0,12/28/2012,"Im a waitress, so I know how tough it can be.  Waiting 45 minutes seems typical, but when it takes 10 minutes for the waitress to show up at the table seems ridiculous.  After that, getting refills and bread took forever.  I asked for dressing on the side, and got none and by the time the waitress even showed up (since she did not deliver the food), I had already eaten most of the protein from my salad without dressing.  It would have been nice to know that when you day dressing on side, it means no dressing, since that is what the waitress told me.  She was friendly, but seemed aloof.  I would go back, but would not expect much from the service."
Samuel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",364,210,2,3.0,10/12/2008,"It's only been a month or two since we stopped by the Factory for dessert, after having a beyond scrumptious dinner at Harry's across the street. But I'm still thinking after that last visit: ""HAYZEUS MARIMBA! How did I ever survive, eating like this for SO LONG???"" Whenever I tell people about our initial experience eating at CF, I always tell the story about seeing them wheeling a cart of cheesecake slices by, and it looked to me like a scene from TITANIC. You think everything is big in TEXAS? Bring your DFW buds by for some grub at the Factory. The LUNCH portions could feed most starving nations overseas for a while.  The food quality has always varied, depending on what you choose from that bottomless menu. And whatever you do, plan on eating maybe a third of whatever you order and boxing up the rest...otherwise you'll have no room left for that infamously good cheesecake. This last visit when we just had dessert, we STILL had leftovers to take home and it took me two days to finish mine! So this is still a place to take your raging appetite, because it's guaranteed to be sated, trust me.  The one pet peeve that still remains is the wait time for a table. We lucked out...it only took us ten minutes to score a table on a Saturday night. But it was still fairly early (about 7:30), and that usually doesn't happen. 45 minutes and up to wait is not uncommon, so try to plan ahead. And although it might have changed in this respect, I still don't think they take reservations on weekends."
Rob M.,"New York, NY",4,67,,2.0,5/18/2009,"For a restaurant that has been so hyped up (at least it's NY location), I wasn't all that thrilled.  We went as a party of 7 on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately.  For starters, I was hoping for a more diverse beer menu.  I was so unimpressed by it that I simply ordered a Mojito instead, which is a rarity for me.  Then came the issue of selecting what to order.  The menu easily consisted of 35 appetizers and over 100 entrees.  By the time I got through it, I was no longer interested in eating anything. Ultimately, it turned out that we would be eating at a friend's house a few hours later, so I thought it would be wise to order their appetizer sampler.  That thing alone filled up three people to the point where they could not even eat an entire piece of cheesecake.  I never thought I would say this about a restaurant, but the Cheesecake Factory succeeds in having a menu that is so vast and portions that are so large that you end up feeling disgustingly bloated, that is if you are ever able to make a selection off their ridiculous menu."
Kristy R.,"Alexandria, VA",0,16,,3.0,8/24/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is your typical chain restaurant.  This location seems to always have long wait times for a table around dinner time.  The service can sometimes be slow.  Their menu has a variety of foods to select from.  I wouldn't go there when I'm starving because of the wait time, but I would order cheesecake to go!  The food I'd rate 4 stars, but the service brings my rating down a star."
Kadian F.,"Orlando, FL",24,142,5,3.0,3/9/2009,Cheesecake Factory attempts to do too many things. There are some really good items on the menu (mostly the appetizers; TexMex Eggrolls) (The Jamaican Black pepper shrimp and the chicken salad sandwich are my favorite items) Of course the cheesecakes are good and the other desserts like the carrot cake and the chocolate cakes are good.  The problem with this particular location is the service.
Dee H.,"Arlington, VA",2,105,6,3.0,4/19/2009,"My family and I wanted to take my mother out for her birthday yesterday, and this restaurant was her suggestion. I'd never been here before so it was all new to me. The restaurant looks big and fancy, but it belies the casual clientele it services. You don't need to be dressed to the nines to come here. We got seated awfully quickly for being a party of seven (including a small child and a baby). I wish we could've been seated at a table with more leg room as opposed to a booth, though. Our server (I can't recall her name) has the patience of a patron saint dealing with our indecisiveness and screaming kids (that's why I don't think I'll ever have kids --- I don't have the patience for them). We ordered an appetizer sampler for $30, and we should've just stopped there because it was filling (including calamari, quesadillas, tortillas with spinach cheese dip, amongst other things). While they do have booster seats for kids and highchairs for babies, they don't have a kids' menu. The waitress suggested a cheese pizza for my nephew, and I thought she said ""It's a big slice."" Instead she brought out a whole giant pizza, and I realized she said ""It's a big SIZE,"" not slice. He only had a slice or two before he called it quits. I had the wasabi-encusted ahi tuna, and I found the tuna great and the wasabi spicy enough to have a kick but not burn my mouth. The rice was great too, but I could've done without the sweet buttercream sauce and vegetables that came with it. I'd have liked more spice. I also had a glass of Domaine St. Michelle, which was pretty good, but an awfully large amount for little old me. I asked the waitress if they could get a group to sing for my mother, and she claimed they didn't do that. So tell me why did I see a group of waiters sing to another table seconds later? I guess it was another case of not understanding each other, because she did have a few people come over and sing to my mother, bringing her a small hot fudge sundae with a candle in it. Thank you! I ordered a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go, but I still haven't gotten around to eating that yet. I'm pretty certain it's going to be good, because it looked pretty damn good. In the end, I think this restaurant is a more comfortable experience for smaller parties (maybe for a date) than larger ones, and this is not really a restaurant for kids. But that menu was pretty extensive and had so many great things to choose from that I wouldn't mind going again myself (I love my family, but I love space and a quiet dining experience even more!)."
