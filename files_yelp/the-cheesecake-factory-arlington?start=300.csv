Jon M.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,11,,4.0,12/17/2012,"The Thai lettuce wraps are to ""die for"".  I have always enjoyed myself with the atmosphere, the professional service, and Man, the food!!!!"
Meg G.,"Washington, DC",146,450,66,4.0,3/9/2010,"10 minute wait open very late shrimp pasta was great after we ate ordered cheesecake took it to go service not slow drinks were quite nice two lemondrops sans ice friends were very pleased waitress - what a tease! sat in a booth wanna know the truth? not fans of such chains but the next time it rains  I will return (this is no ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"")"
Dee Dee S.,"Arlington, VA",0,10,,5.0,9/28/2013,"This place has left me speechless!!!! OMAR my waiter was EXCELLENT in service, personality and all in all a great person. He brought our drinks out quickly as well as our appetizers and dinner. And ALWAYS came to check on us to see if we needed anything. There isn't one single negative thing to say about him or his service.  When I come back here I am going to make sure OMAR is my waiter again. Went home a very full and happy camper. :)"
Britt P.,"Harrisburg, PA",9,85,22,4.0,8/13/2008,"I have been to a few Cheescake Factories in different states, and I have to say that so far this one has been my favorite. I usually go for lunch and get the four cheese pasta - delicious and the lunch serving is more than enough food. Obviously the cheesecakes (their desserts in general) are divine.  As far as service goes, it has been good the times I've gone so no complains in that area."
Muntasir M.,"Miami, FL",5,8,3,4.0,9/3/2008,"I've always been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I've been going there for years and have never been let down..  The food is always delicious, big portions.. The wait staff is nice, nothing to rave about but will do what is needed to make your experience satisfying.  The only issue I have w/ the Cheesecake factory, (not really an issue) is the menu is so extensive, there is so much to choose from and since the food is so good it makes for a hard selective decision.  The wait for a table was not obscenely long, like on Wisconsin Ave. I give this old time favorite an A.."
M T.,"Washington, DC",13,205,11,4.0,7/16/2008,*3.5 stars* I've only come for a few weeknight dinners with friends so I've always been seated within five minutes of getting there.  I'm guessing the long waits others are talking about are happening during the weekends.  I usually stick to the breakfast (I'm a big fan of anyone who serves breakfast all day) or the sandwiches.  The omelets are huge and packed with veggies which I really like.  I always get a take-out box so I can save the obscene amount of leftovers for lunch the next day.  I agree with Nicole P. that their drinks are all about the sweetness and not the alcohol.  No buzz for me. I like their cheesecake but I don't love it.  My least favorite so far is the raspberry white truffle.  I expected a fresh raspberry swirl in the cheesecake or something similar and instead they just used raspberry extract which does not have the best aftertaste.  The Godiva one was so rich that splitting it between three people was more than enough.  At least they're not shy with the whipped cream!
Nicole V.,"Springfield, VA",122,60,18,5.0,4/14/2013,"We visited for lunch earlier today.  Food was great as was expected.  However the service was impeccable!  Our waiter was Brian (or Bryan, not sure how it is spelled.)  We had 6 adults and 4 children.  He never asked if we wanted refills, he just switched them out when we were running low.  We always had what we needed and most times without asking.  He never left us waiting on anything... At one moment I turned my head to look at the person next to me, when I turned back and went to get a drink, it was a brand new one!  I didn't even see him!  We nicknamed him the ""Waiter Ninja"" at our table.  AMAZING!!!"
Barrie C.,"Seattle, WA",54,95,,1.0,10/28/2007,"To me, The Cheesecake Factory represents almost everything that is wrong with America's approach to food.   The portions are ridiculously large.  It's nice to get your money's worth, but seriously, when they talk about a lack of portion control contributing to the obesity problem in America, they're talking about The Cheesecake Factory.  People rail against McDonald's and their supersizing of items, but this is no different.   The menu is also ridiculously large.  So large in fact, that they felt the need to put ads in it.  Am I the only one who is annoyed by this, and by the increasingly ubiquitous presence of ads these days in general?  Ads during TV shows, ads before movies, and now ads in restaurant menus.  Before we know it, there will be ads in our dreams at night. The food itself is incredibly unimaginative and mediocre at best.  I have had the crab cake sandwich because I'm addicted to crab, and it's pretty average.  The service is so-so.  One time I had good service, the other time we were ignored for most of our time there. The one good thing about this place, and the reason it gets any stars at all, is their cheesecake.  They have a bunch of different kinds, and they're generally pretty good. I didn't mean for this review to sound as snobby as it does, and I guess that as chain restaurants go, one could certainly do worse than The Cheesecake Factory, but I'll never understand why this place is so crowded all the time.  With all the better and more unique restaurants in DC, why would you spend your money here?"
Jason P.,"Marietta, GA",14,73,1,3.0,6/14/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory creates a quandary for me to rate, because some of the same things that I like about it are the reasons they can struggle at times. I love the huge menu. I love having a ton of options. But the problem with this is... They create a ton of different dishes, but they don't really do anything in particular very well.  They also have massive servings, which is great. Having a big portion is kind of silly to complain about. What I should really be complaining about is my lack of will power to stop eating and take the rest home. But I think they should really take a hard look and reevaluate their stance in regards to the concept of quality over quantity. The problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that they are a ""jack of all trades but a master of none"". They do a lot of things pretty well, but nothing they do really stands out. They need to trim down on their menu and their portions and focus on creating a more quality product."
George S.,"Washington, DC",7,95,,2.0,9/5/2011,"Recently visited after several years. The place has really gone down hill. Seated before the dinner rush and got a terrible table, view of the wait staff rear ends, not a pretty sight. Waitress was young, inexperienced and robotic. Food was average, dessert was good, can't go wrong with a plain piece of cheesecake. At least the name fits the bill...."
Sherill M.,"Dallas, TX",3,308,32,2.0,5/14/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is alright, but nothing in comparison to those in Chicago.  My tortillas were tight and dry, the bread was cold and nothing was memorable. My sister ordered a salad that came with about a teaspoon of dressing."
CORINA C.,"New Orleans, LA",6,56,,3.0,5/13/2011,"Visited here with a group. Mediocre but better than expected. The portions were so large as to be wasteful, particularly since we were traveling. Staff was good with our large party, though, and very accommodating."
Richard W.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,21,,3.0,6/27/2011,"I have to admit right up front that we have never eaten a full meal at this place. We always go for an appetizer and then dessert. I cannot imagine trying to eat a full meal and then diving into one of their desserts. It may be sacrilegious, but we don't actually go for the cheesecake...though it is very tasty. Our favorite desserts are the Godiva® Chocolate Brownie Sundae and the Black-Out Cake. These are awesome and will leave you with a sugar rush that lasts for hours. Of course, the crash is horrid!"
J C.,"Arlington, VA",117,224,6,4.0,6/25/2007,"To be honest, I've only been here once on a date, but there wasn't any wait (granted, it was on a Tuesday night), and the service was friendly and quick. The server was there when you needed him to be there, but wasn't cloying or in your face every five minutes.  Indecisive people won't like the menu, that's for sure! There are so many choices on the menu, it isn't even funny. CF gets a bad rap among a lot of people who see it as just another cookie cutter restaurant, but it's honestly not that bad, and I'd certainly chose CF over Ruby Tuesday's, Friday's, etc. You get different foods to cater to different tastes, and they at least try to make the atmosphere pseudo-upscale (dimmed lights, minimalist decor). The food at this location was quite good (I seem to end up eating at the Cheescake Factory whenever I go on a business trip, and I must say I've never had a bad meal there). The fried calamari appetizer was nice and crisp without being laden in grease. The GF's salad was a huge pile of lettuce and veggies, and the chicken sandwich I had was very filling. Trust me, you won't leave hungry. In fact, you'll probably have enough for tomorrow's lunch.  The verdict: if you're too damn hip for the cookie cutter scene, you probably won't even be reading this review. But if you want some no-nonsense food without getting too experimental (like, your parents are flying in from Des Moines and their idea of ethnic food is ""eye-talian""), you could do a lot worse than the Cheesecake Factory."
Heather H.,"Arlington, VA",34,32,47,4.0,6/4/2009,"OVERALL. Cheesecake Factory is a tale of two restaurants: Giant menu...too many choices. Huge plates of food...overeating. You get the gist. My suggestion is to find something you both like and split it. Though you can, of course, each have your own enormous slice o' cheesecake. FOOD. For those of you unfamiliar, Cheesecake Factory's menu is so huge, it's spiral bound. That's how you know it's serious, people. While there's plenty to choose from, be warned that everything is...okay. The hazard of doing everything is that you can't do everything well. You won't get bad food, but you won't get great food, either. Like I said, though, you WILL get a mountain of whatever you order. So there's that. PRICE. You get the equivalent of two entrees...and sort of pay for it. However, you won't be ordering appetizers (again, GIANT PLATE O' FOOD), so you can probably count on spending about $20 per person for dinner. SERVICE. The waitstaff was confused. They tried to give us an app we didn't order, and then weren't sure how to ring up our bill. At least they were pleasant. ATMOSPHERE. I've been to locations in three states, and they've all pretty much looked the same. It's a large, pleasant space. A bit dim in the evenings. But certainly conducive to a good meal with friends."
Laura V.,"Alexandria, VA",99,300,,4.0,10/15/2007,"I love the food at Cheesecake Factory.  The only thing that gets me is how overwhelmed I feel while going through the menu.  I usually have to go into it first deciding what genre of food I want, then turning to that menu page and deciding from there. Recently, the BF and I stopped by this location to have a late lunch (or was it an early dinner?  Lunner? Dinch?).  Believe it or not, he had never eaten at a CF before.  Needless to say, the menu overwhelmed him and he was not too happy about having to decide between so many choices.  He finally decided on the asparagus and artichoke omlette.  It was served with their yummy brown bread and potatoes.  I had Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was quite tasty (although I wish I had gotten a tad more parmesan on it).  So the food was great. The service was just so so.  We had this stoner kid who was nice enough, but kept forgetting things.  He took my glass for a diet coke refill and never came back.  When we asked him about it, he looked at us and said ""huh?""  Then brought me another diet coke.  He also charged me for 2 diet cokes which we had to have corrected because clearly he had completely forgotten that the refill was free.   Overall, I really do like Cheesecake Factory.  Their cocktails are really good and I have yet to have a meal there that I didn't like.  I hate the fact that I'm always too full for dessert because the dutch apple cheesecake is one of my favorites.  Plus, there are like 5000 other really great desserts too.  I really think that Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone and it's a great go-to place when you just can't decide what mood you're in (but good luck deciding on your meal choice once you're there!)"
Rowena E.,"Falls Church, VA",45,122,,1.0,11/8/2007,"Reasons To Go To The Cheesecake Factory: 1. You have 6 hours available to waste in your life 2. You like hyped up, over-rated, individual entrees with portions so huge each one could feed a family of 6 3. You enjoy waiting 2 hours for them to bring you your check 4. You love paying $7 for a sliver of cheesecake that for some reason takes an hour for them to slice, put on a plate for you, and squirt with whip cream  To be fair, service was friendly (just so darn S-L-O-W-W-W. need more staff support) and the lunch specials were decently priced even though you have to wait until dinnertime to actually get to eat them..."
Felix C.,"Falls Church, VA",17,93,,4.0,12/10/2010,"It's the everything menu!  It's known for cheesecake but rarely ever get any since their yummy food portions are gigantic!  Sample the menu, it's all good baby!"
Stefan L.,"Temple Hills, MD",5,8,,5.0,6/19/2011,"I always enjoy coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Though the servings can be extremely generous, the food is very tasty. My party and I ordered different appetizers and tried each one. One of my new favorite appetizers is the fried macaroni and cheese balls. It's enough to share and very good. I also tried the corn dogs which was just okay. The atmosphere is calm so it's great for a private dinner or a group event. I will definitely continue to dine at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jessica J.,"Arlington, VA",3,9,,5.0,7/30/2010,"So I took advantage of the Cheesecake factory  $1.50 coupon, I took a screenshot with my iPhone and brought it in. The staff was so cheerful, the manager even gave me an extra coupon for a free cheesecake slice of my choice! Usually wait times vary but suprisingly I went during lunch and there was no wait. Great staff, Bartender was super cool."
