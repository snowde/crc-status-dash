Erik M.,"Washington, DC",40,45,9,3.0,12/29/2006,"The menu is AMAZING...... but the service is almost always terrible.  Seriously, I am not normally a complainer, but where do they find most of their waitstaff?  Let me give you three examples (from various visits):  1) One guy takes what felt like half hour intervals between visitng our table each time (bread, drinks, food, check), but then is back in 12 seconds with the check.  2) I ask a different guy to clear one plate from one of those small tables by the bar and he looks at me like I have just insulted his mother.  3) A third guy keeps forgetting things we've ordered and then basically tells us about his drinking habits outside of work as a way to make us relate to him better (this one's tough to explain but, trust me, it was weird).  In fairness, we have had one normal server and one very good server there on other visits that I can remember. At the end of the day, I've come to this conclusion.  TCF is the perfect take-out restaurant, but you're playing Russian Roulette with your emotions if you actually want to dine there."
Mar O.,"Arlington, VA",13,81,,2.0,2/2/2007,"I have no idea what the deal with this place is since it consistently has lines waiting out the door on weekends.  I've eaten here three times and have been disappointed every time.  It must be the cheesecake that people come for, but since I couldn't care less for cheesecake, I don't know. While I have not had a problem with the service, and the three times I've visited, it's been not terribly busy, my issue with this place is its food.  Terrible service and a long wait time I can deal with if what comes with it is amazing, blow-your-mind food.  Barring that, hell, I'll even take decent food.  Something that won't make me gag or feel my arteries harden just from staring at it.   Unfortunately, whatever comes out of the kitchen cannot be reasonably called food.  Oily and tasteless in stupid gigantic portions that you wouldn't even want to eat anyway. Please, don't waste your time here if you appreciate food in any sort of way at all.  At best, if you must, I've been told the cheesecake is pretty good, but that seems to be about all. I give it two stars because I've never had horrible service here, and they apparently have good cheesecake.  But based on food alone, I'd give it a one."
Eileen O.,"Alexandria, VA",24,187,,2.0,9/8/2007,"I've been to other Cheesecake Factories, and enjoyed the experience, food, and drinks. Apparently this location is not run like the others? As we walked in, I told the hostess that we'd like a table for 2. She said someone would take us to our table. A few minutes later I was still standing there and she looked up and said, ""Can I help you?"" No one else had come in, it was very slow - that confused me. We went for dessert - and the cheesecake was still frozen in the middle (after a 25 minute wait for 2 slices).  I also got a mojito - the ones I've had at the Tysons location are amazing. This one was like drinking sugar water. After finishing dessert, we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for the waiter to come back. Funny, because the people next to use ordered after us and enjoyed their salad and fried chcken (I think?) and left before the waiter even came back to check on us. I finally asked the guy busing the table next to us if he could find someone to bring our check. The waiter came with the check and saw that I hadn't had much of my mojito - and asked about it. I told him that it was really not good, and he did take it off the tab. The only good thing."
Ingrid P.,"Arlington, VA",4,18,,1.0,1/5/2011,"Writing negative reviews is fun but this isn't for my own health. Arlington is full of chains that exist just so people can shovel food down their throats. More about eating than about chewing or tasting, really. The Cheesecake Factory has added a good 3 pounds to each thigh of every Arlingtonian that has passed through there. Comments about the portion sizes are not a plus to me, they are exemplary of the huge waste happening here. If this food ain't good on the plate at the place, it damn sure wont age like wine in your Frigidaire. Bleargh. If you want ""bad"" food, but you want it to be *good* there are so many better places to go in town."
Viet D.,"Alexandria, VA",25,96,,2.0,9/6/2009,"First off, I hate going to chain restaurants since we live in the mecca of such awesome off the beaten path, mom and pop gems of eateries. When my fiance and I were deciding where to go, he mentioned Cheesecake Factory, (of course he is not a foodie like me and proves that opposites attract) and I said ok, since I am always down for left overs the next day. Of course, Cheesecake Factory reminds me right away of why I hate chain restuarants. Yes they have an expansive menu to choose from and they give you so much food, but the service was terrible and the food almost inedible. Fries were over salted, my guacamole was made from unripe avocados, and our mashed potatoes were bland and blech! The only thing decent was the cheesecake. Go for cheesecake and nothing else."
Larry L.,"Springfield, VA",0,75,3,3.0,11/11/2010,"Not a place I'd normally choose, but it was a kid's choice place.  I've never been, so was surprised by the 12 page menu.  My order, Caramel Chicken, was so spicy they had to warn me.  It came and I think maybe somebody confused sugar with pepper.  Not horrid, but surely not spicy.  The wife's tuna ahi salad was ok and my son's enchilada plate got rave reviews.  Of course, the kids' chose the restaurant for the cheesecake, which lived up to its billing.  To be honest, I thought it would be more expensive as well.  Entrees were in the $12-17 range mostly. A perfectly three sort of restaurant which I will only return to if my kid's again ace their grades."
Deanna J.,"Sacramento, CA",189,425,174,4.0,5/10/2010,"I have eaten here twice recently. The service is good, the food is awesome (love the dark bread they bring you after you order drinks,) the cheesecake is hard to skip, and the prices are high. The menu is huge, pages and pages of options, but it's expensive, especially if you order cheesecake and/or drinks."
Rod R.,"Mt Dora, FL",1,25,1,5.0,8/15/2012,"The waitress, Shana, made the experience a LOT of fun. Wish we could take her home to Florida with us!! :)  The food was great as always.....happy hour deals were affordable and tasty."
Dr. Noel G.,"VA, VA",27,41,4,5.0,8/8/2010,"Great dessert, great food and portions.  Been to about 12 in various States, always good.  Try grilled artichoke for a treat ($$), sliders also nice app.  Can't go wrong here, except for calories and sometimes the wait is long.  Best chain around."
Christina G.,"Washington D.C., DC",0,32,,2.0,10/17/2010,"I""ve been to this CF before and this time it appeared as if the quality has dipped. The menus were dirty.  Had dry food and grease smudges in them, nasty. Also when when I got my drink the straw had food on it.  I hate that they straws aren't wrapped in paper.  That means some strange person whose sanitary habits you aren't aware of is touching  something you are placing in your mouth and drink.  The food was ok. I had the Bang Bang Shrimp and chicken. It was decent. However it lacked a spice and the shirmp wasn't cleaned well, ugh..... I did love the cheesecake.  They are consisted for their names sake."
adriana a.,"Arlington, VA",3,16,,4.0,7/9/2009,"I have my likes and dislikes about this place but overall I really enjoy eating there.   I love the variety of the menu.  I'm a big fan of appetizers and they have plenty to choose from.  Fried Mac & Cheese, Edamame, and the Eggrolls are amongst my favorites.   The slices of cheesecake are a bit pricey but taste very good.  I love the banana cream cheescake and chocolate tower truffle cake (which was a huge slice and soooo good).   I've had a few bland meals (chicken tacos) but also have had tasty ones (white chicken chili).  The portions are very big.  I normally eat 1/3 of what I order and take the rest home. Which makes good leftovers to take to work for lunch.  AND the large portions give you plenty to share with your date/friends in order try other items on the menu.    The specialty drinks are tasty but kinda weak and pricey (as you would expect).  But I dont go there to drink.  The bread basket they bring you has two types (white bread and a brown kind similar to what outback gives) and it's always tasted fresh and warm.  I could get full on their bread alone. The only thing I dont like is that it's really dark inside and pretty cold.  Patio dining is a great alternative option in nice weather.  And so far I've never had a problem with the service.  Everyone was always friendly and attentive. If you go there once and have a bad meal, give it another shot.  It really is a great place."
nevan t.,"Manassas Park, VA",21,21,3,1.0,2/17/2013,"I love cheesecakw factory amd their food.  This review is for our waiter not the food.  First thing our waiter says is we are so busy that your food and appetizer will take a while.  We said ok not a problem.  We put our order in and he then asks if we have been there before we reply with a yes.  He then responds with I think I was your waiter before I apoligize if I was not good.  Now I am thinking um okkkaay.  So food does take a while to come out.  We needed refills which another waitress took care of.  He hardly came to check on our table.  Later I did ask for another refill that he seemed to forget about.  We decide to get dessert.  He disappears for about half an hour an then realized he forgot,  apparently he must have been on a brake sinceb he came back reaking of cigarette smell.  We paid with a gift card.  The hubby decided to order a 6in cheesecake with strawberries to go.   We ask if we could order it through him he then responds with can you order it at the bakery cause I am trying to go on brake.  So hubby responds with we are trying to put your tip on that bill since we dont have cash.  Then he agrees.  we order it and then he disappears again.  I tell the hubby screw this lets just go up and order it.  We run into him at the bakery area and he comes back with a bill and tells us the cheesecake comes frozen which I knew already.  Hubby hands him the credit card he looks blankly at us and walks away without taking it.  At this point we sit at the waiting area for him to show back up so we can pay.  After another half hour no show,  we leave the bill and walk out.  This is one location I will never return to.  Mmanager you may contact me to give you the name of the server."
Leigh K.,"Chicago, IL",237,507,54,4.0,12/27/2008,"I had been to a Cheesecake Factory once before last night, but only for dinner. This time I did it right and went there only for dessert with a friend. I had the banana cream cheesecake. This thing was just way too good. I also got the honey latte which smelled like honey, but tasted like coffee until I got down to the bottom of the drink. Must remember to stir! My friend got a limoncello pie, which was alright but I am so glad I picked what I did because whoa my, it was scrumptious. Our waitress wasa lovely Ethiopian woman who was very honest when I asked her opinion of a menu item. Embarassingly, losing track of time, we closed the place down. Really nice being not jam-packed. Think I would have felt diferently if the place had been slammed."
Cadence R.,"Washington, DC",100,222,,2.0,3/9/2009,Even in this recession somewhere that is overpriced and average has a long wait.  Why am I on that list? Ugh.
L K.,"Springfield, VA",0,11,,4.0,6/29/2008,"Suprisingly good food! I just kinda expected that since it's a chain, it's all up in the air... only issue I have is that the menu is SERIOUSLY A NOVEL!"
RD P.,"Springfield, MO",0,65,3,4.0,6/5/2010,"The food was great!  The service was great.  It was one of the better places that we ate at while we were visiting Washington, DC.  We had to park in the parking garage across the street but it was easy.  The Carrot Cake cheesecake was out of this world."
Kenneth L.,"San Francisco, CA",257,143,52,2.0,7/17/2009,"Ample portions but not ample service. They need to be reminded that they're unsatisfactory and rude. Food isn't so good either, ""average"" would be the best description. But at least with the large portions that you can take home what you've left and make it another meal. See, that's what they do best."
Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,3.0,5/20/2011,This location is great! So pretty! Right next to claredon metro station. The area is cute. Has great shopping. Food is really good I love their pastas. Get pasta da venchi and evelyns pasta is good too. This time I got the Thai pasta here it was okay a little too peanut buttery for me. My girlfriends got the factory burger and Louisiana pasta which she loved! Yay for lunch portions and cheaper prices! Bread is free and the brown one is so yummy! Got a great server and parking was at a meter. Had desert at crumbs for a light desert and split a cupcake into four :) my only complaint was that can water please get served in a real glass and not a plastic one! Pet peeve especially since this place is somewhat classy. My friend also complained about their Cokes being watery. I suggest for dessert to get a Godiva cheese cake so good! And strawberry shortcake! Very nice ambiance and generous portions!
Brittni P.,"Biddeford, ME",20,15,13,3.0,12/15/2010,"We have gone to this establishment twice. The first time, barring the 45 minute wait because the line was out the door, was a great experience. Between the time it took to get our orders out and us to finish eating service was amazing considering the amount of people seated around us. Food really good as well. The second time that we went however was a different story. We got seated immediately got our orders out got our food. That was all well and fine, the food itself not so great. My meal, the same that I ordered the first time was good, but not like it was the first time. The portions were smaller, it tasted different and I didn't even bother eating the left overs I brought home. My fiance's meal was far from edible. It came out looking like trash and didn't taste much better than a t.v. dinner. Definitely not the 15.00 plate that we ordered. The saving grace for this restaurant was that the management and the wait staff were so friendly. We got the meal that we didn't eat comp'd and he got pizza instead which while not the best pizza in the world, was much better than the meal he'd had before. We will probably return as this is just a case of two different kitchen crews but will think twice about going for lunch."
Suzanne M.,"Arlington, VA",73,155,,4.0,8/20/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a wonderful restaurant, always has wonderful service, although always a long wait on the weekends. The food is almost always wonderful. Of course love their desserts, just wish they were so many calories :)"
