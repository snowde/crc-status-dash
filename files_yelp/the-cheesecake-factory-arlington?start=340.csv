Cathy H.,"Washington, DC",799,317,1032,3.0,11/4/2008,"Great decor.  However, we're extremely disappointed because for our appetizer, we received stale tortilla chips and bland (we ordered very spicy) guacamole.  In addition, the Kobe burger and the grilled chicken tostada salad were just OK.  We didn't mind the extremely large portions that a lot of people complain about, but the quality was not up to par with less decked out places.  We might go just one more time to taste another set of dishes, but if those are not good, then that will be the last time."
Jodi P.,"Waldorf, MD",9,31,2,4.0,7/14/2009,"Why is it that when I come to the CF I never, ever have room for cheesecake? Through the years on my several visits to this restaurant the food is always tasty and filling (oh yeah said that already). I always order the firecracker salmon app and it is delicious. Tried the white chicken chili recently and it wasn't so bad but the cajun jambalaya pasta my husband ate was incredible.  One suggestion though CF: add sausage for more flavoring to the jambalaya.  My server was attentive and not overly bothersome. We sat outside and the wiff of trash was slightly present because of the public trash can located adjacent to the seating.  The passion fruit mojito was perfect but my husband found his pineapple mojito slightly weak...would certainly come again!"
A C.,"Alexandria, VA",3,61,3,3.0,3/2/2009,"A group of girlfriends and I decided to meet up at cheesecake for a night of fun cocktails, nice food, and a great piece of cheesecake.  The prices were moderate, except for drinks which are about $10 a pop but they do not list their prices on the menu.  We sat at the bar and our waitress was very attentive and nice.  The food was ok, nothing extravagant but that was to be expected.  The cheesecake was great and it definitely made my night."
Amy S.,"Arlington, VA",3,15,,4.0,10/19/2007,I like going there when I don't mind spending a bit of money. The portions are huge though and the variety is huge. The mixed drinks aren't all that great. The two dishes I always get is the herb crusted salmon and the pork chops. Those dishes are always usually good. I'd adivse to avoid the dinner rush especially on the weekends because sometimes the wait can be as long as 45-60 mintues.
J J.,"Woodside, NY",8,263,,3.0,9/18/2007,"Our server was amazing.  There were 12-13 people at our table, and she remembered our orders and got our bills right (we asked that we get our checks separately).   Food is pretty standard - good for what it is.  Their menu is like a book, so it can be hard to choose what you want.  I like the brown bread they serve before the meal."
Constance G.,"Alexandria, VA",0,55,,1.0,11/15/2007,"My office buddies love this place, but I agree with some/many reviewers that the food is overpriced, oversized and awful.  I have had issues in the past with Mayo (I hate it) and Mayo like sauces (they do some strange things to Mexican food here).  Also, the cheesecake is not as good as what I have had at Costco, and about seven times as expensive.  The service I have had here has not been bad, and the management is trying to be accommodating, but the basic product is flawed."
Bi N.,"Washington, DC",4,47,,4.0,10/31/2009,I am not a cheesecake fan but we went here for dinner because I think their food is good.  The service was quick and the food was delicious.  Can't really think of anything to complain about.
Ryan W.,"Arlington, VA",21,781,65,2.0,2/23/2008,"**1/2 stars We all know and either love or hate this chain.  I'm not going to describe what it's all about, since I think everyone knows about the portion sizes and ridiculous length of the menu.  I'll spend my time in this review talking about the quality of the food. First off, I haven't been to a TCF in a while.  Something came over me this weekend and we decided to go on a Saturday night.  I seemed to remember you could call ahead to put your name on the wiat list - but  no.  This meant a long wait when we got there - even longer than the estimated wait time.  Eventually, when we were seated and had finally decided on our selections, I was most interested in the appetizers, which were very good and freshly prepared.  I guess that's the problem I had with the rest of the meal - it didn't seem all that fresh.  The fries were definitely frozen and tasted a little like cardboard.  Even McDonalds does good frozen fries, so why can't TCF?  The chicken sandwich I had was good, but again the bun didn't seem especially fresh.  Finally, the cheesecake/chocolate cake combo dessert I ordered could've been a week old.  It was over the top and huge, and had it been made that day or even the day before would've been excellent.  But I guess you can't expect everything, or anything but the appetizers, to be freshly made.  Still, I don't go out to eat for ""semi-homemade"" cooking - I'll leave that to Sandra Lee and my mom.  I seem to remember on previous visits years ago being impressed by the quality and freshness of the food despite the large menu.  So, even for the chain experience that it is, I can't recommend this location of TCF."
Roberta C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,29,5,3.0,3/16/2010,"ok - it's a chain, but i rather like its faux Egyptian decor with its warm yellowish glow.  love booths.  very friendly waiter.  got the fish special - grilled mahi-mahi - very tasty, red mashed potatoes were so-so, and I forget the vegetable.  husband had salisbury steak.  it's a big diverse menu so pretty much all tastes can be accommodated."
Amarie K.,"Arlington, VA",1,34,,3.0,5/2/2009,"Went on a random Wednesday night with my boyfriend and had a great time!  I'm used to the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago on Michigan Avenue (Tourist hell!), so was surprised to walk in to this location and only have a 15 minute wait.  We grabbed a seat at the bar to wait and I decided on a Lemon Drop Martini---made to perfection!  10 minutes later we were promply seated and picked out the beer cheese dip as an appetizer.  The chips were a little salty, but the dip countered it.  Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were full and we were happy.  I commend her for doing a great job managing a few 2-3 person tables and a huge 15 person table.  I had the shrimp and salmon dinner and the portion was perfect!  Yes, their menu is a novel, but it is the place to go if you want a variety for the people you are with."
B MAC C.,"Arlington, VA",0,18,,4.0,2/3/2010,"You must try the BUFFALO BLASTS!.....great appetizer. And you must also order Extra Blue Cheese for dipping. They are soooo good. They come with celery sticks too. Its not fancy or anything, but it is damn good!"
B G.,"Overland Park, KS",0,31,,4.0,8/17/2009,"The food here is always solid and the service top-notch.  Most restaurants in DC have awful, awful service.  Cheesecake Factory stands out as being one of the few that seems to have hired competent wait staff.  My wife and I frequent this location because the food is consistently good and we have yet to have a bad experience with the service.  I know better food can be obtained in DC, and the no reservations policy is a bit of a pain, but the consistently good service is what keeps us coming back."
Queen W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,33,,3.0,3/8/2009,"As stated by many other reviewers, the portions are huge.  If you are hungry, this is the place to go.   Stick to the salads and sandwiches.  Anytime I have ordered a pasta dish or meat dish, something has been wrong.  I actually went there for my birthday this year.  I ordered the thai bang bang chicken and shrimp.  First, it came with no chicken-just the shrimp.  However, it was very tasty and the coconut sauce was delicious.  Then they brought me the chicken on the side.   For all you cooks out there, how hard is it to COOK chicken?  I cut into it and it was RAW! and pink.  In the dimly lit restaurant, I bet a lot of people don't look at their food closely and notice the color of their meat.   They apologized profusely AGAIN and then brought me another dish, swearing that the chicken was thoroughly cooked this time.  By this time, I had shared my friend's meal, was full, and ready to go.  I took it home and had it the next day.  Guess what? This time there was no coconut in the sauce and there were still RAW pieces of chicken.  This happened another time at the Fairfax location as well.   My boyfriend and I ordered chicken carbonara-the sauce was great but the chicken was undercooked in both of our dishes.  Do NOT order chicken here-especially if it is in bite size pieces hidden in some sauce.  I used to really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  After 2 RAW experiences, I am totally grossed out and have not been back ."
