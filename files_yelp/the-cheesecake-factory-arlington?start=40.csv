Be C.,"Alexandria, VA",379,156,817,5.0,11/29/2015,"I'm never really disappointed with this establishment. I love this location in Clarendon. After a long day of helping a friend move, Cheesecake Factory was my just reward. No pizza for me, give me real food and some dessert! My bff and I decided to eat at the bar, as waiting was not an option after being famished.  The bar was wide open.  Allyse was our waitress. She was very nice, speedy and accurate with the order. Everything came out freakishly fast. I ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger and bff ordered 5 small plates. I was beyond full but I still had to order my chris outrageous cheesecake and my snickers cheesecake! Im a fat girl at heart so yummy yummy in my tummy . I will be back Clarendon, I will be back."
Josepha L.,"Severn, MD",22,3,3,3.0,8/12/2016,This place is wonderful because of the food! But we were waiting long for a table and the lighting was horrible!
Kia D.,"Washington, DC",349,309,412,4.0,10/12/2015,"I went with my family- 4 adults, 3 kids and a baby (that's in the throws of terrible twos).  While I don't care to dine with such a demanding baby, the Cheesecake Factory was accommodating-- kids' plate with cut up fruit and bread for the messy, independent eater, a teddy bear to entertain from the hostess and our waitress rocked-- Taylor was unbothered by the large seating and very pleasant, knew to keep drinks and flatware away from the baby and had food to us quickly.  I enjoyed my dining experience again here. $4 parking after validation for the garage (ask, it wasn't offered) My herb crusted salmon wasn't as crusted as I had had previously. The miso salmon was also good.  The request for it to be cooked with a bit more brown/sear on outside put it on point.  Salmon on the kids menu is awesome for the kids that feel above chicken tenders, tisk! Jamaican black pepper shrimp was awesome too (not served with a green veggie) Salmon and avocado egg rolls are great. Mango key lime cheesecake has crept into favorite pie standing (must like coconut-- it's in the bottom layer crust)!"
Jessica T.,"Arlington, VA",284,263,131,4.0,5/29/2016,"They always save me when in a bind- I've probably eaten at this location once, the food is okay... But this review is for those cheesecakes! Often times when preparing holiday meals.... desserts always end up as an after thought in my mind, majority of bakeries aren't open or close to early for me to scurry on down to. This place has saved me on New Years Eve and now Memorial Day Weekend. I've never purchased a bad cheesecake here, and although the wait can be a bit long ,the staff get you in and out with a smile on their faces! :)"
Tabitha T.,"Springfield, VA",0,6,9,5.0,9/3/2017,The skinny enchiladas and vegetable medley was outstanding! Keshawn was the perfect waitress! She was responsive and kind!
Karolina K.,"Winchester, MA",43,4,8,4.0,4/24/2017,"Delicious food! Onion soup of the day a bit too salty for my taste and the Godiva cheesecake a way too sweet, but overall we enjoyed it! Great service and beautiful interior (besides the fact it was very dark - kinda romantic, so perfect for a date, but can't imagine hitting it with family or co-workers, when you have things to discuss). Overall, would def come there again for more delish food!"
Vanessa D.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",76,7,19,5.0,1/15/2017,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory's but this one was exceptionally wonderful. The service was excellent. The food was fixed neatly and precise. Everything came out in a timely manner. For a party of two, we didn't wait no more than 10 minutes during peak hours. I've also came with my entire family of 7 including a baby and waited for 30 minutes.  This place is awesome!"
Nomin D.,"Springfield, VA",131,740,806,3.0,12/17/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory in general however I feel overwhelmed when j see the menu and nothing really changes. I wished that they simplify their menu.  Today in particular, the server wasn't pleasant at all. She had a demanding tone and wasn't really friendly. We asked to get refills and when she did bring refill for our Sprite it was just alkazer water and it took a while for her to come back to check on us so we were just staring at the drink until she came back."
Brittany S.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,42,16,4.0,3/5/2017,"3.5 stars. This was only my third visit to a CF, and others times I wasn't that impressed. The food was just okay, but the cheesecake was good. This time, I really like my food. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken. It was very filing. I didn't get cheesecake this time, but my friend did and it looked good. We went on a Saturday night around 9-10pm, so I didn't understand the childrens bday party seated beside us. Also, the bathroom was disgusting. But this was a decent spot to get dinner on a Saturday night."
Peyton L.,"Beaufort, NC",2,19,1,4.0,7/31/2017,There's nothing cheesy about this Cheesecake Factory! Come and get it! These are catch phrases that my family thought would for some reason describe my experience but that just doesn't make any sense. My family and I went to this restaurant during national cheesecake day and we were extremely fortunate to find open seating. And even better we arrived during happy hour and were able to feast on some delicious appetizers that had a decent discount! My dad and I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and chicken and even though my dad made the horrible mistake to have broccoli instead of pasta we both enjoyed the dish greatly! I can't help but recommend the Tex mex egg rolls which were also quite a delight. The service was great making this a great time!
Javier P.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,,4.0,8/21/2017,"I've gone to this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times now and I think it's really good. I'm thin, but big guy and I'm hungry all the time, so it's awesome finding a restaurant with big portions. Additionally, it offers a lighter/healthier menu items that my girlfriend likes so when we aren't sure what to eat this place is always on the list for its variety. Service overall it's okay, sometimes better than others like you can expect anywhere, but overall I'm happy with it. They tend to bring the water quickly and check on you a couple of times throughout the meals. However, the only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because of their desserts... With that name I expected them to have great cakes, especially cheesecakes! Unfortunately, all the cakes I've tried (chocolate, red velvet and cheesecake) had too much of an artificial flavor for me :(."
Ayana P.,"Arlington, VA",131,186,14,1.0,10/2/2017,"Literally waited 45 plus minutes for our food. On top of that, it took 15-20 minutes to receive our drinks and bread after being seated. It took about 35 minutes for the waitress to even stop at our table to tell us our food would be out soon. She didn't offer to refill anyone's drinks or offer bread. A party of six had one round of bread that a party of two could have finished on their own.  I live down the street from this place and just have higher expectations of local restaurants. However, last night, I was reminded that this is not a customer-service based neighborhood establishment. The customers come last here. The manager's apology couldn't have been more sorry. It was the most unapologetic apology one could give. I order take-out from here during the week - A LOT for work customers. Nope not anymore, don't even care that it technically doesn't come out of my own pocket. I refuse to step foot in this place ever again."
Rachel H.,"Rockville, MD",71,200,62,3.0,6/17/2017,"We love The Cheesecake Factory. For the most part there is almost never a line, we were immediately seated and given menus. We gave our drink orders and were given some free bread while we decided what we wanted. Our sever came back and informed me that they were currently out of strawberry lemonade (which I ordered) but handed me a regular one until it was ready. ((The regular lemonade is not something I am a fan of, too tart for me which is why I got the strawberry)) At first this seemed fine but the sever never switched it out. I finally called him over and asked if the strawberry one was ready, he insisted on taking my lemonade yet didn't come back for a good fifteen minutes. I was confused as to why the sever needed to take the drink yet expected me to eat my hot food without a drink. By the time the sever came back half of my food was cold and I ended up taking my entire meal to go so I could heat it back up at home. I was really disappointed that I paid almost $5 for a lemonade and didn't even get a chance to get a refill on it. Other than that the restaurant it self is great, we come every other month as a date night and other than the last time always leave happy. We'll be back eventually but I'm not in a rush."
Madison F.,"Arlington, VA",159,45,34,3.0,3/3/2017,"One word...""consistent."" The food and service was good but nothing that is exceptional. The portions are HUGE so I recommend sharing. That way, you can get a desert!  Get there early because I arrived around 7:00pm and there was a 40 minute wait. I decided to eat at the bar.  Side note....the brunch menu looked good."
Nawal A.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I am writing this regarding the appalling service me and my husband received yesterday evening at Cheesecake factory in Arlington.  First and foremost I would like to say that I went there on july 25th for my birthday meal and the food wasn't up to standard. The fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. The crispy catfish wasn't so crispy and was wet on some sides. I understand that some of your produce maybe frozen but on that particular day I could really taste it. I decided to give it a blind eye and reassure myself that every business has its bad days.  However, 30th July we went back to the same location as it was my husband's birthday on the 27th and I thought I'd treat him to a belated meal. We approached the hosting desk where we were reassured that there was a table outside that just needed to be cleared and we would be seated in the next 10 minutes. As I am heavily pregnant I left my husband inside and went outside to get some fresh air where I saw the table being cleared. A few minutes later I see a group of people being seated on thay exact table. Therefore I went back in straight to bring it to their attention, my husband had informed me that the hostess that had promised us the table had brought it to the other hostesses attention but she decided to disregard those instructions.  I do have the hostess's name and wish not to disclose it for the time being as I am not someone that wishes to see her face severe punishment. Nevertheless I want to bring it to your attention that the way in which she dealt with it was utterly unprofessional. She insisted to argue that the other table were first regardless of the fact that her colleague reassured her we arrived first.  I am heavily pregnant, and you would think out of good customer service and goodwill she would have solved the situation in better manner. The manager wanted to compensate the situation with a dessert but seeing that neither I or my husband like sweet things he stated that was the best he could do.  All in all my experience in cheesecake factory twice in the same week wasn't very pleasant. I would suggest that the hosting team to be more precise and deal with such situations in a better manner.  I hope to hear back from customer service team"
Meg L.,"Laurel, MD",8,94,124,5.0,5/30/2016,"Hardly ever a wait at this location. Service has always been above par, and food is just as described!  For a chain, this is definitely one of my faves. Besides, who doesn't love cheesecake!?!"
Long S.,"Arlington, VA",0,41,,1.0,7/6/2017,WORST service at Cheesecake Factory EVER!! And I have been to CFs all over the States!! It is pretty clear that management could NOT careless about running the place. It is absolutely HORRIBLE - STAY AWAY!!!!
Pdhaensel ..,"Falls Church, VA",0,1,,2.0,7/23/2017,"Went here with the family. Great service, very friendly, I have no clue how they memorize that giant menu! There were options that suited everyone, and the meal was superb. The ice water was a bit too dry for my taste. Overall a fun night."
Kelley B.,"Cockeysville, MD",9,26,,1.0,6/4/2017,"I went for a late lunch/dinner to this location on 6/4/17. This by far has been the worst experience at A Cheesecake Factory location.  We were seated, it took the bar 3 times to get my beverage correct, the best part...it was a Shirley Temple . I ordered and was told the kitchen was out of turkey and to order something else  After we ordered the server disappeared.  We had to REQUEST bread.  My silverware was dirty, I asked for extra napkins.. the server asked did I want paper or cloth  Was he going to bring me a basket of cloth napkins...I mean really! My friend asked for mustard, he had to be reminded twice b4 it came out...A different server kindly refilled our water because who knows where our server was. He eventually came back I requested more bread..he brought out one type of bread NO BUTTER and stated the kitchen didn't have any wheat bread ready..I asked later he replied the kitchen still didn't. yet a different server passed by with honey wheat bread for a different table .  When it was all said and done we were trying to decide if we were getting dessert...he asked us 4 times in approx 2 mins...but yet he wasn't attentive all night! I will not visit there again. Shame Shame Cheesecake sub standard service!"
Brian F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,40,21,1.0,6/17/2017,"We decided to try the ""standard"" because we didn't want the food truck from the National Mall (smile). Ordered a 2 entrees.... came out all cold.  We laughed it off and the waitress took them away to try again.... they brought soup/salad to tie us over during the wait for the remake. 2nd time - cold again.... we just figured it wasn't our day.  The bread was great!  Carb lunch! Manager was great and friendly.... offered to give us a slice a cheesecake on the way out - we asked for one and then left.  Opened the bag in the car and it was a different one than we asked. We called the manager back as we were driving away - to give her a laugh.  Things happen!  But probably won't be back anytime soon."
