Laura W.,"Washington, DC",247,1150,1737,3.0,8/8/2016,"My boyfriend in college worked at The Cheesecake Factory and could have one meal per night to take home (up to $20-which is basically everything but steak), so I had already pretty much tried everything on the menu that I wanted to before the first time I had stepped foot in the physical location he worked since, you know, who wants to eat at their workplace on their day off. After that relationship ended, I still hardly ever made my way to The Cheesecake Factory because, frankly, after eating it so much for nearly 3 years, it was pretty boring to me, and my favorite item, the cheesecake, could be bought at the grocery store if I really wanted it that badly (which I never did). Anyways, we have a pair of friends who suggested meeting at The Cheesecake Factory to catch up over dinner, so, despite it being pretty far down my list of places I wanted to dine, I obliged since they are more of the ""chain-y type"" of diners, and this is a better chain than some other options they could have chosen. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday and it was not busy at all. On the one hand though, it seems like the place to go for birthdays as we witnessed the staff singing happy birthday to at least 6 different tables while we were there. After grabbing a booth, we realized our friends were already sitting at one-and they had bread and drinks-so we found them and sat down. Everyone knows that the brown bread is far superior to the other bread served, and I think most people have been to The Cheesecake Factory, so no need to be redundant on the yumminess of the honey wheat bread. For entrees, our dining companions ordered guacamole (which is served either mild, medium, or hot) with chips and chicken Marsala. Both of them seemed to enjoy their food and took leftovers home, since, as everyone knows again, portions are enough for at least two meals if not more. My boyfriend had the cashew chicken. He said it was his ""usual"" order, and he, too, ended up with leftovers. We split it the following day for lunch and wow-was it way, way, way overly salted! I kept wondering why he was drinking water like a horse during dinner and now I see why! I ordered the appetizer French county salad. It was, as expected, the size of an entrée salad, and contained beets, pickled onions, arugula, asparagus, and goat cheese in vinaigrette. I enjoyed the amount of beets in the salad, although I feel there should have been more than 3 little pieces of goat cheese in the mix. The amount of asparagus slightly made up for the lack of cheese. I appreciated the salad was lightly dressed as often salads are drenched in dressing at restaurants. Although I did not finish, I didn't take my leftovers home. Although I could have totally gone for a slice of cheesecake (preferably the Godiva chocolate cheesecake), no one else wanted dessert, and I didn't want to look like the heifer of the table, so I declined dessert as well.  While our service was slow, our server was friendly and kind of off the wall crazy but entertaining. Normally, I'd think it weird, but he kind of just made it work and was never intrusive. The Cheesecake Factory is never my first choice but it is a pretty reliable chain for those seeking out that option, and this location is quite convenient to the Clarendon metro."
Tuyen T.,"Chantilly, VA",62,2,,3.0,5/18/2017,"Food is good. Service is horrible. We have to sit for an hour waiting for our food, no apologize from the server at all. The manager came out to talk to us, still had to wait another 15 minutes for my husband's chicken sandwich. An hour 15 minutes waiting on the food, then the server walked by and gave us the look. Ridiculous!"
Melinda M.,"Waldorf, MD",2,59,,4.0,5/3/2017,"This particular location is one of my favorites to visit due to the nice atmosphere, great service, and the food is always wonderful. Parking can be challenging but it balances out."
Pedram F.,"Arlington, VA",225,104,127,4.0,1/30/2016,"Cheesecake Factories are pretty standard across the country, and I've been to at least 6 different ones across America. I can't say that I'm surprised the place has 3 stars as it is a chain and I'm sure there are thousands of different experiences. But, just from my POV alone, CF deserves a solid 4 stars. The food is always delicious, their service is typically pretty great, and all in all the place has an excellent variety to choose from. I guess it depends on what your personal rating scales are for dining out, but if a solid variety of options, tasty cuisine and friendly service are on your criteria, CF is a pretty reliable choice. Here's what I'm a big fan of: Appetizers: - The bread (of course!) - Crab Dip - Fried Zucchini Main Course: - Cajun chicken little - still some of the best chicken tenders I've had - Chicken Madeira - Orange Chicken Dessert: - Oreo Cheesecake!! Final note: beware of the long wait times on Friday and Saturday!"
Whitney A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,1.0,5/23/2017,Called the restaurant to place an order for takeout and they put me on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up and called back and no one picked up the phone...
Kath O.,"Springfield, VA",0,10,,1.0,5/8/2017,"My family and I went to have dinner here yesterday and I have many complaints. First off, the server took well over 10 minutes to come and greet us. UNACCEPTABLE. Then there were multiple servers that came by idk which one I was tipping. Anyway, we ordered the food. I got a shrimp scampi and my cousin got the shrimp bistro. I kid you not after 10 bites I felt like I had to throw up!! I ran to the bathroom. After coming back the same thing happened to my cousin. When in the bathroom the women in the stall next to mine was also sick. Now today, we are still sick. I just called the restaurant to inform the managers, not to complain and I was on hold for over 5 minutes. So I just hung up. UNACCEPTABLE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! Im so disappointed."
Juanita P.,"Clinton, MD",64,19,12,3.0,6/5/2017,I couldn't give this place 5 stars with good conscious. The food was sub par at best. Not riding the train to flavor town at all and the service was mediocre. I probably wouldn't visit this establishment again due to the fact I have a theory that all franchise restaurants lack in good food but also because it really wasn't the best.
Tawana B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,4,,2.0,2/15/2017,"I was disappointed with my meal. I remember loving the TCF food when I visited a few years ago. I ordered the black pepper shrimp, which description had me excited, and was left feeling sick. In all fairness, the salsa and rice and beans were decent and my waiter was friendly. However, the shrimp were over cooked and the pepper sauce was clumpy, oily and had a funny after taste. Unfortunately, I don't think I want to dine here anytime soon, if ever again."
Valencia W.,"Annandale, VA",102,782,8,2.0,8/27/2016,"I remember way back in the late 90's when the Cheesecake Factory was the place to be, where lines were long...my how things have changed.  You don't even need reservations these days and there are empty tables.  Came here to celebrate a birthday and because we figured it would be a good time to go.  Everything was fine until we place our order.  It took over 62 minutes (I timed it) for our orders to reach our table.  I wouldn't say the service was bad, but it was slow and once again there were empty tables.  These days, there are so many restaurants to go to that understand that you shouldn't have to wait an extraordinary amount of time for Chicken Madeira & Salmon.  Food was fine, but as the rating says -- I've experienced better."
Leah K.,"Washington, DC",322,508,509,3.0,1/2/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. You can't expect it to be more than a chain restaurant of decent food.  The thing that's good about the Cheesecake Factory is that they've got a large, extensive menu that has a little bit of something for almost every palate.  Nothing is particularly spectacular, but nothing is bad either. I'm personally not a huge cheesecake fan, but I love the lighter fare menu.  The service at this location is great and it's always clean and a decent place to go with a large group and coworkers."
Rhonda J.,"Woodbridge, VA",18,128,188,2.0,8/1/2016,"This pains me. I love the Cheese Cake Factory - they can do  no wrong. I have waited a solid hour just to enjoy their consistent menu and customer service. That is until going to Clarendon at night .....Saturday night. I didn't mind the wait - used to it. The customer service of the staff was crappy, the bread stale, OH and the small plates they give you had a left over piece of wrapper on it ewwwwww. I was deducting from the tip as soon as our waiter came over. I ordered the turkey burger.....had it before .....not sure what they did wrong but it was wrong! My fries hot so I will give them that. I normally visit this location during lunch or happy hours....maybe that is were they shine because the Saturday night crowd they clearly can't handle it. But on the plus side....my cheesecake was good!"
Dana S.,"Bowie, MD",3,20,8,1.0,7/20/2016,"Gross! The Asian tacos is my staple go-to dish.  Ive had it about 3 times at the Annapolis and MD Live locations within the past two weeks (hangs head in shame).   The wraps here were disgusting.  They only gave me 4 shrimp to spread over 4 ""tacos"" and the shrimp were undercooked. How on earth do you not know how to cook shrimp!?!"
Stephan C.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,1,1.0,3/22/2017,"I ordered the Romano Chicken to go, what I got was a disgusting & saggy breaded chicken. In fact there was almost no chicken, it was just pieces of watery bread crumbs!"
Kee K.,"Suitland, MD",145,39,8,2.0,3/20/2017,"Came for dinner Sunday afternoon and was very disappointed.  I've never had a bad experience at The Factory, but extremely slow service, food arrived at separate times, and the food wasn't as good as it normally is.  No rush to return to this location."
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,5/3/2016,What can I say about Cheesecake factory other than I love this chain and the bistro shrimp pasta. I don't even have to look at the menu to know what I want to order.  They have lunch size portions (for lunch) as well as dinner size portions.  Everything was great at this location except that our entrees did not all arrive at the same time. Three of the four entrees arrived and we all waited for the fourth entree to arrive before eating (so basically our food was getting cold while we waited). We didnt understand why the fourth entree took so long since it was simple to make--a burger!!  Thats the only reason why this place loses a star.
Natasha C.,"Annandale, VA",94,30,192,5.0,1/14/2017,"Have been to cheesecake numerous times in clarendon and fair oaks as you cant go wrong at this restaurant. Soo many options to choose from. From the super yummy cheesecakes to the small plates there is ample variety. They have  tacos, pastas, sandwiches, salads, etc. I used to order the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus alot as I love the lemony taste of it. I recently decided to venture out and try other things and have to say I love the beet and goat cheese salad. I have had it as a small plate and  during happy hour as a meal and its light and delicious. The spicy chicken pasta is very flavorful as well. I usually ask for extra sauce on the side and they are very good about providing more. In drinks the mint cucumber lemonade is refreshing and my favorite cheesecakes are the ultimate red velvet and  the sweet and salty caramel, although I have not tried all of them yet. These two are not super sweet and I like that about them not to mention the richness of the cheesecake itself. In appetizers the macaroni bites are great if your in the mood for comfort fried food.  There is also the nacho platter (its huge and the chips are fried just an fyi). The avocado egg rolls are good too as is the eggroll platter with an assorted mix of rolls and sauces. The food is a bit pricey for some things but the quantity is huge so be prepared to either share a meal or take home leftovers for a second meal. Great ambience, waiters are always friendly, and overall a great place to celebrate any occasion especially a birthday as the waiters sing happy birthday for you :) Oo yea and how can I forget great for happy hour as well."
Sean L.,"Alexandria, VA",35,56,,1.0,2/11/2017,"I was invited for lunch and arrived at noon and we were in the back on the left side. I could not believe how cold it was in there and it's like they didn't cut on the heat after such a upper 60 degree day on Thurs. It was so cold and horrible, when my pizza came it, it was just warm.  By 2nd slice, it was room temperature which was very cool.  Running a/c in the summertime was not as cold, and the pizza was no longer enjoyable.  As a matter of fact, we asked that ice not be added to our water the 2nd and 3rd time around. This was the worse thing to be sitting there trying to make conversation while we were literally shaking from the cold.  I was glad to see that everyone was finished and the bill was paid. This is bad for such a big place...no apologies...no warm food/drink comps...nothing."
Lilly S.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,,2.0,8/3/2017,"SERVER wasn't attentive. We shared combination steak for main course and waited for asking the plates to split it. She didn't come around our table until the meal was done without the plates. Also, when I was signing the bill and tips, she looked down at the bill and wait at our table. The food was good but her SERVICE didn't make me want to go back again."
Will F.,"Temple Hills, MD",8,55,113,2.0,4/21/2016,I have come during lunch hours and happy hours and have always been happy with the food and the service. Today..I have came in after lunch and before happy hour. 2 patrons in the place and my small salad takes 20 minutes to get to me. To top that off the bartender says that there is no fresh bread to go with my meal. My worst Cheesecake experience. ..EVER!
Ryan L.,"Arlington, VA",154,36,,5.0,3/7/2017,"I've been here twice and had great experiences both times. The first time we came with a large party and the hostesses were very accommodating, working to get us a table all together in a short amount of time. The second time was for my birthday, and my waitress was very attentive and quick. There are tons of food choices, and the portions are enormous (same as every Cheesecake Factory). It would be great if Cheesecake Factory had customer parking like the nearby PF Changs, but it's Clarendon, so I can't be too surprised. I will definitely be frequenting this location!"
