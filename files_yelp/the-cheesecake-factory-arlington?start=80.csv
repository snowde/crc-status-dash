Terri S.,"Leesburg, VA",14,33,15,2.0,1/21/2017,"Typical restaurant chain food.  The decor is so dated, they need a makeover. It's always crowded, the restaurant is loud, they dim the overhead lights during dinner which is weird since there's no table lighting so you won't see the food very well.  Their portions are huge, and the food is pretty salty, fries are good as well as some fish dishes.  Salads are covered in an excessive amount of toppings.  We go there often because of the convenience and size of the place, we don't have to wait long for a table even on Saturdays. Not my favorite place but it's a safe bet you'll get consistent mediocre service and food."
Ian W.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Amazingly Bad Experience at CCF!  Ordered the soup of the day yesterday,  Clam Chowder,  and we both tasted one spoon full of the ""brew"". and declined NOT to eat it sent it back due to a strange taste !!! However shortly thereafter departing CCF,  we both stricken with food poisoning !!!  Beware of The Clam"
Catherine M.,"Blacksburg, VA",8,318,86,3.0,11/7/2016,"I have ordered take out from here a few times and haven't had too much of an issue. Can't speak for service too much but the Take out person was very kind and prompt. I suggest ordering it yourself and picking it up over using an app like Post mates, because I've had bad experiences with them with not bringing the whole order, but not sure if that's an issue with the driver or the restaurant. Even the skinnylicious sizes of the salads are freaking huge but they have some amazing Caesar dressing and croutons. I also have tried their skinnylicious turkey and avocado sandwich, which was good but the brioche bun seems a bit unhealthy. I would love this same sandwich on a wrap or something healthier instead. I think the biggest rip off I had was a $7 vanilla milkshake here, which was, surprisingly, not the typical Cheesecake factory oversized portion. For $7 I would expect a huge milkshake but it was the same size as a McDonalds one but like 5x the price."
Amanda M.,"Alexandria, VA",194,4,,1.0,7/13/2017,I used to love cheesecake and before this I have never had a bad experience. They messed up and the food took 3 times as long as it should have. The service was soooo slow prior and after the food was late. They did apologize but didn't take off anything from the bill until we asked. Then it was only a piece of cheesecake or 25%. Any other restaurant I've ever went to that messes up half this bad usually cover the bill or at least take off the meals messed without even asking.
Cardon M.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2017,i heard they have roaches.might even be a infestation.not nice seeing one walk by you while eating.
Dave S.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,3,,3.0,7/9/2017,My wife & I arrived at 8:30 and requested outdoor seating. We watched the waitress assigned to our area pass us 4 times before I went back inside to complain. Immediately a server came and took our drink orders then 20mins later we received our drinks. Then 5mns later we received some bread which should have been immediately upon sitting down. Waiting on water & our appetizer after 45min. Had to go to the bar to get two waters. Food was Amazing but wife's order was messed up and she had to return it. Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong but the food was  amazing! Waiter was great and we felt sorry for him cause he was very nice. They took the drinks off and we Still tipped.
Dennis M.,"Lorton, VA",250,187,569,1.0,12/31/2013,"ZERO STARS! I write this review at 3:20 AM Tuesday because I am still being punished for going to the Cheesecake Factory Saturday night. My family and I always hated the Cheesecake Factory.  It's overpriced, insanely unhealthy for you, and they have a book for a menu.  The food poisoning I received will strengthen my hatred for this AWFUL place for the rest of my life! I was forced to go to the Cheesecake Factory because two of my friends were celebrating birthdays that exact night and that's where the consensus wanted to go. NEVER AGAIN will I be a team player when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. It was greasy and apparently FILLED with salmonella.  I will live out my days forever cursing the OVERPRICED,  OVERRATED, OVERLY disease filled HELL HOLE known as The Cheesecake Factory!"
Sean L.,"Alexandria, VA",0,21,3,3.0,6/3/2017,There is never consistency in service. I guess I always expect smiles and friendliness from all the staff.
Tumani T.,"Washington, DC",33,103,69,3.0,10/10/2016,"This location is having a serious off day. First my party stood at the receptionist desk for an exceptionally long time. The dish I ordered took forever to come and when it did, the salmon was not cooked all the way thru. Not one time did the manager stop by to speak to my table. That's horrible customer service. My last time coming here, not representative of normal service and quality of food I'm used to at the chain."
Lauren B.,"Washington, DC",122,309,737,4.0,1/22/2015,"It had been awhile since I had been to the Cheesecake Factory and it was my first time visiting the Clarendon location. Overall, we had a great meal with good food and service. We were there for a very late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday afternoon, so while there was a 20 minute wait to sit in a booth, there was no wait to sit at a table. Considering we were starving, we opted for a table. During our time dining, it was the middle of a shift change, but unlike other restaurants where you don't end up seeing either of your servers, at Cheesecake Factory, that wasn't the case as both of our friendly waitresses were attentive and kept coming by to check on us. Also, I don't know if I've just never noticed the music playlist before (because usually the restaurant is packed and super noisy), but honestly, it sounded like I was listening to my own iTunes playlist, can't beat perfectly curated music to accompany dining.  Our waitress gladly fulfilled our request to have two loaves of the pumpernickel bread, rather than have one of each. It had been such a long time since I had been to The Cheesecake Factory that it was nice to be able to order some of my old staples and have them taste just the way I wanted them to. I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade - super sweet with a sugared rim, one of my favorites and the crusted chicken romano. I was surprised that this Cheesecake Factory didn't come by and ask if I wanted freshly grated parmesan cheese on my pasta like all the other locations used to do, but there was some cheese already on the pasta so it wasn't a big deal. The one disappointment was I ordered the Reese's Peanut Butter Cake Cheesecake. There were supposed to be chunks of peanut butter cups in the layer of original cheesecake, but my piece didn't have a single peanut butter cup, which kind of defeated the purpose of me ordering this cheesecake because it was supposed to have cheesecake. I reached out to Cheesecake Factory via the guest comment portion of their website just to let them know that the cheesecake they were serving didn't match the description online and suggested they change the name if it wasn't going to include peanut butter cups. While the cheesecake was good, it just wasn't what I had ordered. I was extremely surprised when I checked my mailbox and found they had responded with a letter and sent me a gift card to come back. Good job with the customer service Cheesecake Factory!"
Nada M.,"Black Pearl, New Orleans, LA",0,14,3,2.0,5/20/2017,I usually like Cheesecake Factory but for the second time in a row I come the silverware on the table is not clean. Today there was a dirty tea spoon on the couch that is not clean. Such a shame.. I hope my food is at least clean. I'll wait and see... such a shame
Lizzy E.,"Washington, DC",0,26,3,2.0,10/22/2016,"It was a mediocre experience.  Pros: -Our server was really nice, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. -Clean environment. Nice decor.  -Cheesecake was good.  -Good location.  Cons:  -Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi was not good. The mashed potatoes seemed defrosted. The shrimp was overcooked fried - couldn't taste shrimp flavor. The salmon didn't have any flavor to it either.  -Kobe Burger was okay from the outside, but the inside really didn't have any flavoring. The fries were horrible - so plain. Only thing good about the burger was the spicy mayo.  I gave it 2 stars only because the server was great! However, service is only part of the overall experience. The food is the main reason why people go here and for what is being charged, it should be above average, but it was in fact below average. Nothing special, unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone. Your money will be better spent elsewhere."
Tiza M.,"Duson, LA",23,21,26,1.0,2/14/2016,twenty five minute wait . Btw all we ordered was cheesecake. She brought it out in to go containers. Did ask if we wanted it plated but I figured we would be elderly if I had to wait again. We did not ask for it to go.  Never coming here again. Cheesecake was good but being aggravated made it not as tasty.
Cuong T.,"Houston, TX",86,208,228,3.0,8/5/2013,"Cheesecake is absolutely delicious. Get the Red Velvet one if you have no idea what you want. I promise you'll love it. I've only eaten cheesecake here in the past year or so but I remember going here a few years ago and eating other things..but it's been too long since then so I can't review how my experience was back then. The service is kinda slow, but the waiter to table ratio isn't too good so it's understandable in my opinion. The lighting is a bit too dark for my taste though...kind of annoying. But yeah back to the cheesecakes. I mean they're all good, but like I said, they can be really filling...and I advise you to stop eating when your stomach tells you to stop. If you overeat the cheesecake the ""fillingness"" and richness of the cheesecake will DESTROY you and cause to you to vow to never come here again. Do yourself a favor and take it to go. It's best to be enjoyed when you haven't had it within the past 24 or so hours. What took off a star was the price of the cheesecakes. I think 8 dollars for a slice is simply outrageous. if they lowered it to 6 then I'd be fine but 8's just too much. Here are a few pics. I know the blurry one is Chris's outrageous cheesecake and the red/white one is the red velvet one. I think the other one is the snickers one. All in all would go again...if attending a b-day party or it was half-price off cheesecakes again, haha."
Mitch N.,"Chevy Chase, MD",0,2,,5.0,5/8/2017,Excellent dinner -- Salmon/Miso Salmon/New York Strip/Orange Chicken.  Great Service.  All topped with a birthday chocolate cheesecake for my wife.  Would do this again in a heartbeat.
Curtis H.,"Denver, CO",43,250,301,4.0,3/22/2015,"I hesitated when giving the starred rating on this one. Our server, Kayla, was really sweet, though it seemed like she was in the ""weeds.""  Again really nice, but seemed to get stuck on one table and neglect her others. I ordered a Cuban sandwich and my wife, a pit beef.... But don't call her that... You might get punched! :)  Both of the sammies were awesome! Full of flavor, on crusty bread. We decided that e wanted a coke halfway through our meal. Our waitress was nowhere  to be found, so I ordered from the bar. Thankfully, we weren't charged for it.  Our waitress came back, just in time to give us the check, then disappeared again. I think that her coworkers knew she was having trouble, because about 3 other servers came out of nowhere to help pick up the slack. One took our card and processed it, others helped others helped other tables. We were putting on our jackets to leave.... Poor thing looked a little shell shocked. I do commend the factory for ensuring that it's guests were taken care of, but it seemed that there could've been another server or two in the bar section."
Mackenzie K.,"Alexandria, VA",456,282,583,5.0,3/18/2015,"I go to Cheesecake Factory at least every few weeks, one Saturday we went 4 times haha! I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and pretty much everything they offer and my last visit was nothing different. We were there on a weekday evening, we didn't need to wait, but for weekends there will be a very long wait- and no you can't make reservations.  We were sat and our waiter quickly asked us for our drink order, and promptly brought them to us. We started off with the fried zucchini, yum, one of my fav appetizers they have, it's simple and delicious. We then ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and the chicken costoletta. Both were served hot and were delicious! Cheesecake Factory has very large portions, for a pretty decent price, so plan on taking a box home!.. you need to save room for desert!  For desert we had the red velvet cheesecake and Linda's fudge cake...drool, both were very good.  The food was great, but what really made this visit for us was our waiter, Eliezer. Seriously if you go to this location, ask for him. he was on top of everything and SO polite. He definitely gets my favorite server of the month lol. Like I said, try to plan ahead of you plan on going here on the weekends, there will be a wait. Also, there are 2 different parking garages near the restaurant so parking should be pretty accessible !"
Martha V.,"Alexandria, VA",0,4,,5.0,5/5/2017,"Yesterday after a funeral In arlington we went as a party of twenty. They were wonderful seated us immediately ,service was marvelous and food was delicious. It was a great comfort to our family during this time to have such excellent care during this sad ocassion. They deserve five stars and more !!!!!"
nk j.,"Arlington, VA",0,5,,5.0,10/12/2016,One of my fav restaurant.  I love their fresh baked bread. That's one of the reason why I always want to go back. I had several different dishes there but my most fav dish was Diana steak. If you love meat I would recommend you to try it. Best steak so far
Mischita H.,"Orlando, FL",173,612,1346,4.0,7/2/2013,"I think that the Cheesecake Factory is almost always a pretty cool place to hang out. I met some awesome Yelpers here today for happy hour (UYE).  The Happy Hour special are decent - $5 drink and food menu.  I must say the J.W. Pink Lemonade was very good.  Today's service was ok - one Yelper had a small problem with her item being overcooked but the Server took care to get another order and the Manager took care of the bill for that item. Otherwise, the food was good.  In the end, everything worked out and I left a happy camper - one day I will return..."
