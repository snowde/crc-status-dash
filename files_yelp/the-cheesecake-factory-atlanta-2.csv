Elaine W.,"Toronto, Canada",33,97,18,5.0,11/18/2017,"I've eaten at cheese cake many many (one too many times) LOL. The food was standard good and I have no complaints.  However, I just had to say our server was one of the best human beings I have ever met. Cepheas H. was the most charming and friendliest server I have met in my life. He seemed to love his job and mans the whole experience of eating at cheesecake unique despite the fact that I have eaten at many different ones in different state.  He should get a raise or a promotion or at the very least free food for a year LOL. Thank you so much!"
Honesty G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,6,1.0,1/5/2018,"The cake nightmare!!! I am DONE with Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a Oreo cheesecake for a colleague's birthday with her name written on top. You have to pay extra for the name to be written on a special card to place on the cake.  Upon picking up the cake from CF, the girl proceeded to tell us that they do not have anymore cards, and the name was not written on the cake for that reason. She was not apologetic by any means. She actually looked annoyed. How could you be annoyed? You're not the one that has to give a birthday cake to someone without their name on it. Personalizing a birthday cake is how people feel special on their birthday. This is a very important part, not to mention the fact that we are spending OVER $50 for this cake! Why didn't anyone call us!? Why is the girl behind the counter having an attitude?  Finally the manager comes over, his name was Patrick. He was very nice and at least tried. He wrote the name on the cake. It was not the prettiest but he tried. I gave one star bc he tried. In the future, do not have an attitude with the customer, it isn't their fault that your inventory is not correct and we were not notified. Also if you're going to work in the bakery, and have an attitude, maybe you should work in the back. Bake the cookies, rather eat a cookie and have a smile! She needs a new job. She is lucky she didn't have her name tag on! Patrick thanks for trying... but after $50 that is ridiculous! To others just go to Publix and buy a cake. At least they will not give you an attitude."
Tera D.,"Norcross, GA",32,44,46,3.0,12/1/2017,"At one point in my life, I loved The Cheesecake Factory but I feel like the quality of their food has really gone down. Maybe it's just me and my evolving tastebuds but the previous times I've left very unsatisfied. I've tried many different dishes and they all proved to be equally disappointing. There are two things that I actually enjoy on the menu and that includes the fried mac n cheese and of course the cheesecakes but I don't think they carry enough weight to keep me coming back.  Otherwise it's a pretty decent restaurant, albeit there is usually a long wait.... and staff are always nice. This is just not a restaurant I will choose to dine at very often."
Uma P.,"Atlanta, GA",7,117,160,4.0,1/8/2018,"This is your run of the mill chain restaurant but this particular location is better than most! Most CF locations are average, 3 Stars but this one, this one is a 4. Went here to catch up with friends tonight and had excellent service! The passion fruit mojito was a hit! Served in a martini glass and well made, great bartender! Bravo to you. The avocado egg rolls are good (maybe need a little extra salt). Chinese chicken salad was good too. And as always, great cheesecake, Oreo is my fav...but I got the hot fudge sundae this time, still good. they kept the fresh bread coming...carbs, ice-cream/hot fudge and alcohol...this is key to keeping girls happy :) good job Cheesecake Factory, good job. Well done. FYI it's at the Perimeter mall so parking can get annoying but it's free and a huge lot. Great location. Prices are as expected for CF."
Pierre D.,"Atlanta, GA",53,12,22,5.0,1/10/2018,"I grew up in he area. This Cheese cake factory had been a staple in my life. I've had 2 family members work here. So I occasionally drop in to sit and the bar and grab some beer or a slice of cake but never both cause I feel like that wouldn't taste good together. They might. I haven't tried. I like the place. The menu is hilariously large so me trying to try everything on the menu who do be a task. I've had most cheesecakes though. Of course #1. And unlike Drake, my girl doesn't fight me at cheesecake, so I love to go there.  yayyy! Rap lyrics in a review, you're welcome."
Jeneen P.,"Atlanta, GA",62,51,227,4.0,1/7/2018,"Had a great night on Friday for my godsons birthday dinner. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and a cucumber lemonade.  Parking was easy. When I got to the restaurant, they were already seated.  They don't do reservations so before I got there the party waited an hour . The food was good."
Becky H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,60,119,4.0,10/14/2017,"We had a great time at Cheesecake Factory. It's located at the Perimeter Mall with ample parking. The interior is very nice, certainly much nicer than I remember CF from a few years ago! Our server was very attentive and helpful. We split the guacamole appetizer that was very good; they were accommodating in the kitchen and proper serrano separately since we had varying spice level preference.  I ordered a whiskey smash that was good, not too sweet! For my main, I ordered the veggie burger with side salad. The burger was enormous! The flavor was pretty good and the salad greens were fresh. Too full for dessert, lots of great looking options on the menu though! I've ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp in the past and it's crazy good, highly recommend."
Julie R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",46,26,3,1.0,11/11/2017,So unbelievably slow.  This was the final straw.  When did CF become a self service restaurant?    Today it took my friend and I 3 hours to have lunch here.  The service was so bad I got up and went to the bar to get a refill on my iced tea because I sat for over an hour being ignored by our waiter.  It took over 30 minutes to get the drink order to begin with. We were ignored multiple times.  Our waiter literally went to get the cheesecake order  and disappeared  completely for 45 minutes.  He only paid attention to us when we finally got a check.  Then he buzzed around us like a ravenous vulture waiting for a tip.   I won't be back.
Monique' M.,"Atlanta, GA",22,109,213,3.0,9/11/2017,"I have been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for years. I have created many memories at various CFs. And the food and atmosphere is still bangin. If you are looking for a place with an extensive menu and a plethora of cheesecakes then this is the place to go. Now about the Perimeter Mall location...whoever the young lady was working take-out two weeks ago, she had a very sour attitude and lied to me about them discontinuing a menu item after we had a disagreement on the name of the item. I was trying to order cauliflower wings and she stated that they did not sell those. After a few seconds of back and forth and having her get a menu for me, she informed me that they are called Korean fried cauliflower and that that menu item has been discontinued. Therefore, that day I left only with a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. Well then, why to my surprise did I go back to CF this past weekend and I was magically able to order the Korean fried cauliflower? Smh, not a way to build customer rapport. Also, I don't know when or why restaurants started doing this, but there were three people in my party and each person got their food at a different time, the last person getting his 20-25 minutes after the second person. Everyone was done or very close to finished eating by the time the last person was served. Awful timing, thus creating a not so nice experience."
George E.,"Marietta, GA",0,7,,1.0,12/30/2017,"We went there for lunch on on 12/28/2017 & I wish we didn't . The Cajun jambalaya was burned , it literally tasted like a burned pan. The shrimp scampi was so oily , it looked like they put a stick of butter in the plate before they warmed it in a microwave. And last but not least, the waiter was pushing us to finish & leave as quick as possible. When we ordered dessert at the end , the waiter said "" to go I assume"".  We have been to different locations many times before & we like it , but this visit to the Dunwoody location ( in perimeter mall) I give it a 0/10.  Merry Christmas."
Breyana D.,"Savannah, GA",18,55,74,4.0,9/18/2017,"I had such a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory! I went with a group of friends on a Friday evening and surprisingly there was no wait. Our server was very attentive even though he was juggling two big parties. I ordered the Georgia Peach for my beverage and the pineapple chicken and shrimp as my entree. The drink was just okay- I didn't taste much alcohol. But the food was amazing! There was a combination of flavors to include garlic, onion, and pineapple- which added a nice sweetness. The chicken and shrimp were fried and tossed in the sauce as well. It also came with white rice. I would recommend this dish if you're looking for something different and light. The dish included a lot of food but was not heavy at all. Can't wait to try something else!!"
Cristina S.,"Atlanta, GA",142,53,93,3.0,11/29/2017,"I love the cheesecake but the food is blah. We only go for the cheesecake and if you're picking up on this location on the weekend, be prepared to wait. It's going to be slow."
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,4.0,8/27/2017,"Well, if you have been to one, you have been to them all. Same great menu and service. The bartender(s) I think are better at this location the other CFs I have visited. This location seems smaller than some of the ones I have been to around the states. Again, you can't go wrong."
Kimberly S.,"Atlanta, GA",145,41,69,4.0,9/17/2017,even though our last visit was sub par my boyfriend wanted the parm chicken pizza so we tried it out again.  everything was definitey better this time. service was good at the beginning and i guess everyone wanted their check at once so it was slow towards the end but better service than last time. our food came out and it was very good. boyfriend got his pasta pizza and i got a burger. it was cooked perfectly and i got my salad dressing on the side cause last time my greens were drenched. my boyfriends pizza was good he said not as much meat as last time but it was still really good.
Terry H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,79,215,3.0,7/30/2017,"I've been eating at Cheesecake Factory ever since they opened their DC location in 1993, the chain's 4th location and 1st location outside California.  Despite wait times often exceeding 3 hours (and my limited dining budget), it was part of my regular restaurant rotation.   While I don't frequent the chain nearly as often as I did, it has always been a great choice for quality food and good service. Unfortunately, today was different.  It was National Cheesecake Day but we arrived around 11am while the restaurant was still half empty.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese dip and Cajun Jambalaya pasta.  The food was served in a timely manner and the food tasted great.  But aside from taking our initial order, our server was nowhere to be found.  We waited and waited for drink refills or for anyone to check on our table. Once we were done with the food, we were ready to order dessert.  My dining partner ordered a cheesecake and I ordered the Apple Cobbler.  We also asked for drink refills.  A few minutes later, the server returned to inform me that the restaurant sold out of Apple Cobbler.  Not a big deal if this was a mom and pop restaurant but this is a billion dollar company that should be better at supply chain management.  Worse yet, I never got my refill.  If he hadn't taken my glass, I could have quenched my thirst with the melting ice but with no glass, I just finished my meal and ate dessert without a drink. Our server was friendly but hardly present. Not sure if he was inexperienced or if the restaurant was understaffed.  Either way, the service was below expectations for the Cheesecake Factory.   I hope this was an isolated experience and not the new standard."
Charlie H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,4,5,4.0,8/1/2017,"I should be coming here for the desert right? Nope! Not to say that their Cheesecakes are bad, because they are anything but, I actually really like their food! If anyone has seen the menu, then you will know right away that the menu is more like a short story book rather than a typical menu, which some people will have a problem with, but I don't mind too much. During my most recent visit to this establishment, which was indeed quite recent, I have to say, I was quite impressed with how everything went! Usually when I do go to Cheesecake Factory, I always expect slow service, like really slow... However, to much of my party's surprise, everything went quite smooth and efficient. Whenever we are around this area, especially around dinner time, there are always a lot of options to choose from. So when we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory, we were expecting to wait 30-45 minutes (at least) to be seated, however, it only took us 15 minutes to be seated! I think that should be considered an all time record, especially since it was during a weekend afternoon. So after we got seated, we were greeted by a very lovely server, named Nikki (sorry if not spelled correctly). She took our drink orders and in no time at all, we had our drinks. She was also very fast in bringing our bread and butter, and if you know me, I love me some complimentary bread! After our table basically devoured the bread, she was so kind to ask us if we wanted more, and of course I said yes. Again, her service was exceptionally fast! Whenever I do go out with the family, we sometimes decide to eat family style (sharing entrees) which we did for this night, after we ordered our food, she brought us extra entree size plates without us having to ask. Again, Cheesecake Factory has a good amount of things to choose from, and whenever I go, I have to have at least one pasta entree (they make good pastas!). Because their portions are quite large, you could easily share one entree for two people. We ended up getting a Pasta Carbonara w/o chicken ($16.50), a Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95), and a Factory Chopped Salad ($12.50). The food came out within 15-25 minutes and everything tasted great! The Carbonara is always made well, the chicken was seasoned well and had a nice crispy bite to it, and the salad was delicious, dressed with just the right amount of dressing. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the service for this particular day was phenomenal, again, thanks to our server Nikki, and the food was superb. If they continue with this type of great service, as well as continuing serving good food, this place will easily be a 5 star for me!"
Ashbeezy B.,"Suwanee, GA",1584,375,6404,5.0,1/24/2017,"Someone has been keeping this under wraps but I got the scoop! I had no idea they did Sunday brunch. Apparently many of my Atlantans have been keeping this secret. Well NO MORE! I had the best French toast brioche I've ever had in my life! It was soft fluffy flavorful and most of all yummy! Lol. The texture is unlike anything I've ever had. I can't really describe it. You've got to experience it for yourself. It was so good I had to ask for the manager. April, the manager, was as sweet as can be. She detailed how the brioche actually soaks overnight for this extravagant tasty outcome. Wow.  I am amazed yet again. Thank you Cheesecake Factory. You made my weekend brighter!!!"
Helen K.,"Atlanta, GA",122,466,3998,4.0,1/28/2017,"Its my bestie's favorite so its not so uncommon that we'll end up here if we can't decide where to eat.   Cheesecake is a chain and it differs from location to location but we prefer this one over Buckhead due to convenience being a central location and that they still carry chicken luau salad that Buckhead doesn't. Though Cheesecake can be a headache with long waits and too many options, its always the perfect option to cater to all cravings.  Yesterday, I finally satisfied my craving of a burger with the skinnylicious burger.  Though I didn't really eat skinnylicious when I ate a good portion of my fiance's Louisiana chicken salad on top of their bread lol. That brings me to their awesome Hawaiian and sour dough bread! Try to tame yourself though, you get all your carbs before the actual meal, which we usually do.   Typically we come to cheesecake without getting cheesecake due to the HUGE portion sizes here but great for sharing.  Some of our favorite plates are:    -Luau chicken salad that comes with crispy wonton flakes that you break up with tangy and sweet dressing -Louisiana chicken pasta - flash fried chicken cutlets with peppery and creamy bowtie pasta -Pasta carbonara that's creamy and bacony with a spoonful of green peas (That counts as veggies!) This is one of my favs but totally made out of carbs, hence the name. -Cajun jambalaya pasta - Bountiful of chicken and shrimp with fresh tomatoes on top.  Pretty tasty! -Chicken lettuce wraps - Awesome taco alternatives by substituting the tortilla.  Flavored with Asian sweet sauce. And the list is endless... But on top of it all, they have skinnylicious cocktails so you don't have to skimp out on Friday night celebration or any celebration. IF you have room for cheesecake, I would highly recommend the banana pudding cheesecake.  Even for those who doesn't like cheesecake will like this with fresh bananas and cheesecake so airy and fluffy with light, refreshing banana flavor. Cheesecake offers all and will leave you full everytime! Its just the day after your scale will snap you into reality hehe."
Blake W.,"Atlanta, GA",39,195,87,3.0,8/21/2017,"I really debated between 2 and 3 stars. I ultimately went with 3, because to get a 2 from me there usually has to be something definitively wrong with the place. And there is nothing wrong per se with Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter.  I just do not find the food special, and for the price it really should be something special.  This location is located at Perimeter Mall.  It gets pretty busy as most Cheesecake Factories. Being at a mall there is usually not a major issue parking, just a matter of how close you can get.  There are plenty of jokes around about the size of the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  It certainly has a huge selection. I tend to suspect that is why nothing is special. If you try to be everything, then nothing is great. Some of the best places in my opinion have a few things they do, and they do them well.  Last time I went to Cheesecake Factory it was me and my wife for lunch. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had a not memorable pasta dish. No alcohol and our bill was almost $40.  Again, nothing wrong with the food. The food was just okay and the service was fine. Going forward though when spending $40 for lunch I will be seeking out something more special."
Sharon C.,"Atlanta, GA",243,297,1497,1.0,7/2/2017,Not to fond of this location. Our booth we sat at had nothing but gnats and our server had major rbf (resting b face).  I had the spinach artichoke dip and the veggie burger. The dip was surprisingly very good. The burger was sloppy and falling all over the place. The taste was decent but it didn't have a component to hold it together.
Annie W.,"Sandy Springs, GA",98,180,974,5.0,3/14/2017,"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about, but I love The Cheesecake Factory chain. This location is just as great as the others; they're pretty good about being consistent.  Details:  There is valet and there is self park at Perimeter Mall. This location is attached to the mall and I think you must enter from outside.  They have a bar, Togo and dining area  I never order alcoholic drinks here because they're expensive and youll need a few to get a buzz. But if you want a super expensive smoothie, be my guest. They do have happy hour but I don't remember at what time but you sit in the bar high tops and order from a happy hour menu.  Their food is kinda pricey, but it's good so I keep coming back. They have a few selections on the lunch menu but this time I ordered a burger since those are priced the same. Also, the macaroni and cheese burger was awesome! They put all the toppings like lettuce, tomato, etc on the side, and they gave me honey mustard on request. They make their own so it's really good. They also sell all their sauces up front in to go.  You should also try such items as avocado eggrolls because if you love avocados, it's pretty much a must! Also, the chicken Bellagio is a pasta dish that packs some flavor without looking like it's doing a whole lot.  Don't do the artichoke appetizer; it's a whole artichoke so you're going to be biting each tint edible bit off of each hard non edible bit. Too much work for the price  And the cheesecake is so worth the cost! They also have an amazing tiramisu. They also come out with a new flavor every few months and feature it on the back.  It's a small put off that the menu has ads (yes I know.. it shocked me too at first) but just ignore them and keep turning pages."
Susan P.,"Perimeter Center, Atlanta, GA",4,1,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"Waited 2 hours to get seated with large party. Told ""waiting for one table to leave. When asked to seat at least part of the party at an empty table next to where we were to be seated and was told"" that table was for another party   Waited 25 minutes just for water   33 minutes for bread. Diners were served 5-10 minutes apart.  Took over one MORE hour for all to be served. Women's bathroom had overflowing toilets, water all over the floor, no toilet paper near toilets (it was all stuffed in the toilet or in the floor).  Miserable experience I am so sorry that I had to give one star."
Shenna J.,"Union City, GA",0,11,3,1.0,11/2/2017,My coworker asked for cheese on their sandwich and they literally took the plate and put a slice on the burger placed the entire plate with vegetables in the microwave and brought it back. A party of 10 and everyone had individual issues.
Dawn D.,"Atlanta, GA",4,82,84,5.0,12/24/2016,"An annual tradition has us at Perimeter Mall, at 1130am, to enjoy a great holiday lunch during this busy season. Service was staffed accordingly as we strolled in quickly and we're seated in less than 60 seconds.  If anyone has ever been to this place, you know the decor, menu, bar and dessert area is all the rave. The menu boasts 45 pages at last count, with too many options for you to consider in the 5 minutes the server leaves you to decide the next phase of your journey. Joy, our server was phenomenal! She offered her suggestions as I asked because our party of 4 has some questions and I was on the fence with going to my 'old trusty' or venturing out to something new. We ended up with sliders, fries for a meal, fished tacos, salad/black beans, and Monte Cristo sandwiches.  The hibiscus lemonade is the bomb-not too sweet and won't send you into diabetic shock, lol. Considering we were ordering dessert, we definitely wanted to snag some cheesecake on out way out, we ate light today. When the food arrived, it came out hot, fast and correct. This establishment rarely gets the order wrong, although I admit I almost ordered my son's food incorrect if I had not been reminded to add cheese to his sliders, and just ketchup and nothing else. Our server Joy was very friendly and gracious and make the adjustment immediately.  As I stated before, we arrived before noon, so we saw a ample supply of empty tables, however that changed by noon- almost 50% capacity. The bar boasts a big screen TV where you're invited to chat with the bartender or servers. The temperature was nice enough for outdoor seating although I wasn't sure if that's an option this time of year. We ended our experience on our way out and ordered some cheesecake. The original, and the pumpkin pecan. Yummy! Healthscore-91 Service-Phenomenal Restrooms-1 Handicap, 3 stalls fully stocked and clean Managers-Available, Visible, and Engaging  Parking You'll have to ride around once or twice. The mall parking is ridiculous so what can you do?"
Erika S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",221,12,1,1.0,12/20/2017,I use to love this loocation better than all of the other locations but not anymore. I dined their just yesterday and I came in at 10:15pm on a date. The server we had rushed the entire time. Saying things like can you hurry because the kitchen is about to close and that the kitchen is yelling at her to get our food order. I asked her for a recommendation and said well I'm vegan. Then I asked her what's popular and she didn't even reply. My date didn't order anything becauee of it. I ended up ordering the orange chicken which was Cleary rushed as well because the rice tasted undercooked. When I asked the server for more Brown bread she said I don't know because the kitchen is really closed.
Michelle M.,"Easley, SC",9,88,265,3.0,7/7/2017,"I dined here during the week of the fourth. I ordered the fried Mac and cheese as my appetizer and the turkey club as my entree. The fried Mac and cheese was good, fried crispy with the marinara dipping sauce. The club had fresh sliced turkey breast, not the deli kind with lettuce, tomatoes, crispy thick sliced bacon on toasted bread with an herb mayo with s side of fries. I had strawberry lemonade that was the bomb! Their portions are big you will have leftovers. This was not my first visit to this Cheesecake Factory, and like  all of the other the Cheesecake Factories I think it's over priced and you're paying for the ""experience "" of eating here. The cost of my meal and mother's meal(chicken tenders and fries) two strawberry lemonade s was $50.62."
Kierra J.,"Atlanta, GA",255,33,89,4.0,10/25/2017,"First of all, this place is too dark! I can barely see anything. But the food is delicious and it's very clean so I guess it's ok. You get a big serving of food plus they bring out some warm bread while your waiting. The staff could be a little more attentive. The only annoying thing is you have to pay extra to get a different side than what's listed but overall it's a good place, especially for date night."
Vex B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,5,3.0,11/4/2017,"After posting my last review of the Cheesecake Factory, Ms. Kristin Hall called me personally. I would like to thank Ms. Hall for her understanding, and her excellent customer service. I would also like to thank her for keeping her word, by sending me a letter and gift card. I hope to have wonderful experience upon returning to Cheesecake Factory Perimeter."
Susan K.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,144,339,3.0,6/13/2017,"I really like The Cheesecake Factory chain and this location is no exception.  The menu is crazy long, so it is a great place to go with a group - anyone can find something they like. Today I ordered the House Salad and Pizza combo from their lunch menu.  The house salad consists of greens with tomatoes and choice of dressing.  The pizza options are from the regular menu, it is just a bit smaller on the lunch menu.  I am usually a big fan of their food, but today, even though the pizza had lots of toppings, I had to eat it with a fork because the middle was soggy. :(  I'm hoping this was a fluke - as I have not had this issue in the past. Keep in mind that the meals are rather pricey, but the portions are usually enough to take home leftovers (or split a meal)."
Ming N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,37,4,2.0,12/17/2017,"Service was incredibly slow today, you can maybe chalk it up to the holidays but I'm pretty certain this is probably pretty normal. 10 minute wait for someone to come bus the table, another 10 for the server to show up, about 25 minutes for the food to come out. Food was kind of lackluster and bland. Normally when you think of Cheesecake Factory you think gargantuan portions. Not the case today.  Overall our server was not attentive, she was too busy talking with another employee. The only reason for more than 1 star, is their cheesecake is still pretty decent. Won't dine in again at this location, if I go back to a CF it will just be for the cheesecake, to go....ordered in advance."
Angela S.,"Sandy Springs, GA",18,1,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Visited Perimeter Cheesecake the other day and the waiter got my order incorrect. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and received the grilled salmon (that has grill lines). In the attempt to correct the problem, the manager returns with herbs heated on top of the grilled salmon which was totally incorrect. Herb crusted salmon is not grilled! As to not cause any additional problems like someone tampering with my food by a second refusal, I accepted it unwillingly and picked over it. This was poor customer service in the attempt to disguise what was already an error and pass it off again!"
Cyn F.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",48,176,149,5.0,3/26/2017,"I had a great experience at this location! We walked in on a Friday night and the wait was only 30 min. We were told that if we see an opening at a high top table, we could go seat ourselves. After 15 minutes of waiting, a high top table opened so we sat down. The service was great. Our waitress Portia (sorry if misspelled!) was great! She was really attentive and was very helpful to us. She really made the experience here a 5 star experience. The food came out quickly and was delicious. I am only visiting Atlanta for the weekend but if I ever come back, I would definitelyyyyy return to this location!"
Paula S.,"The Colony, TX",164,176,22,4.0,2/14/2017,"I still love you, Cheesecake Factory. Especially your bar. Even though you share your good cooking with everyone since you're a chain. I still love you! I guess that makes me the side chick :(     #dontjudgeme They make an AWESOME Strawberry Martini. And if you're a fan of blueberry and a fan of martinis (girly ones, not grown man ones with the olives), order a Cosmo with Stoli Blueberry. You can thank me later.  My favorite dishes (that are still on the menu) - Chicken Picatta, Hamburgers (Yes, I know it's the CF, but their burgers are AWESOME), Chicken Littles, Avocado Eggrolls, Buffalo Blasts, Shrimp Scampi, Herb Crusted and Grilled Salmon, Southern Fried Catfish, and a few of the combination platters. Please make sure you're ready to work this food off, because the portions are huge and the calorie counts are NOT low, for the most part. Budget your calories for this place, especially if you plan on having cheesecake (which is also amazing). The menu is extensive, so if you've got indecisive or picky eaters, this is usually a good ""compromise"" spot. They'll even customize your food for you (within reason). Amazing food, amazing drinks, usually amazing service (It ranges from good to amazing, but I've never been to a CF and had BAD, let me complain to the manager service) - I still love this place.  The minus a star isn't for this location specifically - it's for all. They've recently changed their menu and took away some of my favorite dishes, like the garlic noodles. WHHHHHYYYYY??? DAMMMMN DAMMMMN DAMMMMN (*Florida Evans Voice*)!"
Tanya H.,"Chicago, IL",52,61,42,4.0,3/22/2017,"The cakes are always great, favorite dish here is the Chicken piccata, but the Chicken Riesling is a close second. Nice addition to the menu. Only drawback is how busy the place gets on the weekends, it's a madhouse. It's recommended to put your name on the list and plan to wait. Take a walk or simply have something to do while you wait."
Hannah W.,"Atlanta, GA",437,466,1045,2.0,2/14/2017,"My friends and I came here to celebrate someone's birthday. Since we already had dinner, we just came to have some cheesecake. This was probably the first time I had been in a Cheesecake Factory in years... and it was disappointing.  It's great that they put how much calories their food contains on their menu, but this sucked in the sense that I went from wanting a cheesecake to not wanting one at all because of how much calories are in these slices of cheesecake. The cheesecakes I originally wanted to try were all around ~1500 calories per slice... Wow, that's about all the daily caloric intake I need in one whole day. I ended up compromising for a tiramisu cheesecake which had just a little below 1000 calories. The cheesecake was just okay. It may have been in the freezer/fridge for a bit too long because the cake portion of the cheesecake had a stale fridge taste to it (like it's been soaking up the smell of whatever else was in the fridge with it).  Also, the bathroom was not clean at all and there were no toilet paper or paper towels anywhere.  I will say, the only good thing is that they were able to accommodate our large group of friends pretty last minute on a busy Saturday night."
Detrell H.,"Albany, GA",61,14,11,4.0,10/2/2017,"I really enjoyed the Chicken Madeira.  It was seasoned very well with perfectly prepared asparagus on top of it.  The mushrooms were tender and delicious, in a beautiful mushroom sauce.   The ambiance was just right for our group of 25.  Our food was hot, with the exception of my potatoes.   The staff was very attentive and professional.  I enjoyed the entire experience! I will definitely be back!"
Jaclyn K.,"Gainesville, FL",481,5,1,1.0,12/27/2017,I am extremely upset about the quality of food at the Cheesecake Factory as it has gone down hill significantly over the years. I called ahead to order the BBQ chicken salad but with shrimp instead of  chicken because i don't eat meat. It was about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday night (not a crowded time). I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived in 25 minutes and it was not ready. In fact i don't  believe they event started making it because the girl went back to the kitchen to get it for me and she was gone for over ten minutes. This salad has 6 ingredients (besides the shrimp) and i was charged over $21 which is absurd in an of itself. But they left off one of these ingredients (the fried onions) which i did no notice until i arrived home. Some lettuce and the avocado were also brown. I was also given no butter with my bread. Needless to say i will not ever get food at this location again as this is not what i expected and a huge waste of money.
Courtney C.,"Atlanta, GA",34,53,180,5.0,9/2/2017,The food was really good . The server wasn't too friendly . It was a party of 17 maybe he was overwhelmed . But the food was great and came out in a timely manner .
Meredith R.,"Marietta, GA",431,621,,3.0,1/29/2017,"After an exhausting day of shopping -- tough, but somebody's gotta do it! -- Ellen and I popped into the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  I reviewed the restaurant a few years ago, and if I recall, awarded four stars.  Having ordered the same thing this time, my assessment slips a notch. ""Renee's Special""  (who's Renee?) is a good deal.  Half turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a bowl of soup AND a salad for $12.50. Well looky here: they brought me a whole sandwich!  But the chicken salad was null and void.  Right proportion of chicken to mayo, but not enough zing.  Rather than a choice of soups -- surely they should have at least two -- the restaurant only prepares one per day.  Yesterday's soup du jour was 'loaded potato': thick, gloppy, highly caloric, not my thing.  (For what it's worth, Ellen enjoyed hers.)   The field green salad was fine -- a good-sized portion -- and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing -- ""on the side, please"" -- was excellent. Our server was an adorable, on-the-ball college student, so we were well taken care of . I like shopping at Perimeter, cause there are options for lunch if the food court isn't your thing.  Would I return to the Cheesecake Factory?  Sure!"
April V.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",92,4,,2.0,11/14/2017,"This has to be the worst experience I have ever had at this place, from start to finish was a joke! We arrive and in the area it is one woman next to us and we order knew exactly what we wanted and I watched the guest next to us get up go to the bar and pick up her drink that was waiting to be served to her ! We wait over 30 mins for our drinks to arrive and watched 4 people get served before us and now we have waited an hour. Finally he tells us 4 mins and sorry for the wait at this point we are ready to leave, and we ask for the food to go and just pay! The food was not what we ordered and the appetizers we ordered was cold !"
