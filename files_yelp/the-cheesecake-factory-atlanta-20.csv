Saira K.,"Atlanta, GA",147,1047,403,5.0,1/20/2014,"I would not have expected to give The Cheesecake Factory such a high rating, but their lemoncello cream torte is worthy of 5 stars. Absolutely delectable layers of vanilla cake and lemon mascarpone cream are topped with streusel and served with strawberries, syrup, and whipped cream, and I think I tasted lady fingers as well. The cake is so moist and soaks up the strawberry syrup, strawberry juice, and lemon mascarpone. You can see the photo I posted. The mixture of the strawberry and lemon made it taste like passion fruit. I am not a fan of their cheesecake; I find it too soft and lacking in taste, and it just doesn't have the right texture - I am quite smug about the cheesecake I bake (my secret recipe), although ordering cheesecake is fun here because of all the choices. The rest of the menu is just okay; this is a chain. I was recently in Austria and Germany and was terribly disappointed by the desserts there, even in Vienna's famous cafes. The lemoncello here is superior to what I had there, and they got the streusel just right; the mascarpone is uniquely done!"
Thomas L.,"Norcross, GA",26,87,4,3.0,3/6/2014,"I don't normally enjoy writing reviews about corporate, chain restaurants. Firstly, I believe their atmosphere and theme to be silly and derivative, and secondly, I'd rather spend my money on an establishment where the money flows more directly into the community. With that said, I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Perimeter Mall and it warrants a review, for reasons both good and not so good.  To begin with, the interior of the restaurant looks like something one would find at Disneyworld - this is to say somewhat cute, an obvious attempt to come across as attractive. I don't even know where to begin to describe the décor or this place - it had fake columns reminiscent of the Classical world,  carved faces in the fashion of the Aztecs and Mayans, and painted ceilings resembling poor man's imitation of Michelangelo. Weird, but not outright unattractive.  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and doesn't take reservations on weekend nights during peak  hours. This means you will wait for 15 - 30 minutes to be seated. That's not so bad, but even though the restaurant is quite large, it's also cramped and loud making conservation quite difficult. The service is definitely friendly. I was asked, ""How are you tonight, sir?"" multiple times (which I presume to be a dictat from on high to the staff) but it's not very snappy, either. This is to be expected and forgiven in such a busy establishment, though. That said, it's not somewhere I'd recommend you go out for a date night or an intimate and relaxing dinner.  The menu is very extensive, almost overwhelming. Personally, I prefer a restaurant that trims downs it menu and focuses on doing several things very well, but the Cheesecake Factory takes the opposite, broader approach.  Now, to the most important part - the food. It's nothing to write home about but I certainly didn't leave hungry, either. I had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer - rich and filling, and chicken pot stickers for dinner. I've certainly had better pot stickers, but they were quite good, served with a slightly crispy shell, chicken and seasoned with ginger soy sauce. I cleaned my plate and have no real complaint to deliver about the fare, but no accolades, either.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey end of normal. The house wine is $8.00 and the Lemon Drop I ordered was $10. Not outrageous, but more than what one would pay at a similar corporate chain restaurant.  Finally, the place is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. Numerous varieties of that delicious pastry are available and if you like them as much as do I, you won't be disappointed. Personally, the Red Velvet is my favorite, but I plan on trying the numerous other varieties over time. Finally, The Cheesecake Factory is a  restaurant that does what it does without having a unique experience and serves good, though not exceptional food. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat here, but if you know what you're getting into, and want to take home a delicious cheesecake for a midnight snack, give it a shot.  Pros: CHEESECAKES. Extensive menu means that even pick eaters will be able to find something they enjoy. Cons: Not much to offer in terms of ambiance, and while the food food is nominally good, nothing stands. Verdict: Recommended IF someone else is paying, or a group can't decide what kind of good to eat that night."
Brandon K.,"Flowood, MS",0,4,2,2.0,5/30/2016,Server was pleasant but made it known that we needed to eat fast so they could get off work. Didn't bring out any beard because they had already thrown it out for the day. Didn't get everything I ordered. Good was hastily thrown together and presented poorly on the plate. Will not go back to this location.
Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",111,362,176,3.0,8/8/2012,"I have been to this location several times, and while the food is always delicious (when does CCF ever put out bad food? Never!) the service is remarkably subpar. Not only is it usually slow, but I've had a few waiters be downright inattentive to the point of rude. I have a suspicion it is because I'm usually with my younger siblings (high school/early college aged) and they assume that because we're all relatively young that we don't tip well. On the contrary, my standard tip is 20%, with percentage deducted only for bad service, and all my dining companions tip the same way. We're never rowdy or rude, so I am really shocked to see that this behavior by the waiters is a pattern and not a fluke. This is the only Cheesecake Factory location I've ever had a problem like this at. Food: 5 stars because it's always delicious, fresh and huge portions Service: 2 stars because I'm almost always treated terribly and left to wait forever for food, drink refills and the bill Compromise: 3 stars total"
Tabatha W.,"Smyrna, GA",12,1,15,5.0,8/18/2015,"Absolutely Fabulous! I love this place . I practically live here . Several favorite dishes - kale and quinoa salad , pork chop , filet , chicken chipotle pasta, sliders, mmmmm..... It's all so good ! Favorite dessert is Chris's outrageous, lemoncello, or the all new salted caramel ."
Eleni D.,"Atlanta, GA",181,2,,1.0,4/26/2016,This is probably the worse place to go to. First off every time I've been here I wait an hour. The service is awful! And the manager at this location is not very polite. I went with a group of my girlfriends and we are seniors in high school. They treated us with no respect as if we were children which pissed me off. Just because we are not adults does not mean you can give less service to us. I mean we are paying customers. So we wait for 45 minutes then we were seated at a table that was too small for the 8 of us. They made us get up and wait another 30 - 45 minutes. So by the time we were sitting down we were pretty mad. We all ordered and the waitress was nice but still awful service. We received the food after we waited for another 30 minutes. It looked appealing but it was actually below average. The food here is really not that good. The only good thing worth ordering here is the cheesecake but honestly it's not even worth sitting down and having a meal. I suggest if you ever go here just order cheesecake and pick it up.
Petrina P.,"Atlanta, GA",172,107,28,4.0,10/21/2013,"$5 happy hour? I'm there. I was looking forward to good food, great prices and an awesome happy hour companion and thats just what I received in addition to a go with flow waiter. His name escapes me right now but I love the fact that my off the wall jokes didnt deter him and he just fit right in. I've been here before but not as a ""Yelper""  ha! Now that I'm doing reviews,  I've become extra nosey, and if you know me I'm super nosey, got my P.I. license at H.O.M.E. but anyway on with the reiview.  There was no wait time due to my  friend securing a great spot in the bar area. I was happily surprised they allowed an incomplete party to be seated right away. The server was funny and had a great attitude. I had the spicy chicken rolls and the avocado rolls...The avocado rolls are to die for and the chicken was just ok, not as good as the Southwest Egg rolls from Chili's but hey they tried. I had the Pink Lemonade to quench my thirst and that it did. One of the best mixed drinks I've had in a long time.  All in all I enjoyed my visit and will partake in their Happy hour more often. I may be headed there this evening. What an awesome way to spend $20."
Smurfetatl W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Went for 16th Wedding Anniversary to Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall.  Staff was very pleasant to everyone but us.  They apparently had some miscommunication about table assignments which lead to a 15 min wait - AFTER I asked who's the server.  Received a lack luster apology - the sever brought an incomplete serving of cold bread without butter, brought water without taking our beverage order and disappeared for another 10 mins (should have known something wasn't right - too many empty tables). Then another waiter came apologized for the confusion, took drink order, appetizer order and main entree order.  I thought we were on the right path when the drinks and hot bread (full serving) with butter arrived at our table within 5 mins.  Waited another 25 mins - no appetizer or waiter.  After overhearing a table near us complain while speaking to the manager, we PAID for our drinks and left after wasting 2 hours attempting to eat ( we only waited 15-20 mins to be seated).  Will never go to Perimeter location again. Side note - we drove to the Cumberland location same night around 10pm. Was seated and waited on, and began eating appetizer by 10:33pm. Food, service & resturant atmosphere @ Cumberland 5+.  Also, we did not share our Perimeter experience with the Cumberland staff. I'll give Cumberland 5 stars. Perimeter Cheesecake -1 star."
Morgan W.,"Atlanta, GA",96,64,16,2.0,12/10/2014,"A little overrated.  I haven't had the best service when I've come here. On the plus side, the decor is really pretty and of course the dessert is delicious."
Mandi T.,"Atlanta, GA",10,283,9,4.0,12/9/2014,Always a good experience. The service was great. Portions are huge! Save room for red velvet cheesecake.
Mari O.,"Atlanta, GA",0,37,,1.0,8/29/2015,"The next time you expect and want  good quality war/hot food, professional management aware of good customer service, DON't COME HERE!!  it may be a huge disappointment!! Tonight we were outside enjoying the balmy, gorgeous evening.  My food arrived with a very hot plate, but Cold food. (weird). Our excellent waitress took it back and advised she would contact the manager to come over.  The plate came back., with the same cold food, and a female dressed diferently, who said , "" this should be warmer."". (total words) meanwhile, having waited for the food, I had lost my appetite.  Ate the bread! Received the bill, NO COMPENSATION.  Informed our waitress the manager had never come.  Her replywas :  Oh yes, she did come.  She was the who delivered the second plate!!  Wow, no apologies, no comp for a waste of a food experience, and a company who has no care for customer serivice or satisfaction.  This manager needs to be replaced, asap.  Will write to administration, this location has gone way down.  A first for me with this company."
Randy H.,"Sandy Springs, GA",207,299,682,4.0,12/18/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory...You are pricey but your food is great. The atmosphere is great. The waiters are great. If you want good food for a special occasion, I would say definitely go here if you havent before. They have several unique dishes with something for everyone. I tried the Jamaican Curry? plate and it was delicious!"
Ali F.,"Atlanta, GA",123,219,602,3.0,7/16/2012,"I like Cheesecake factory but they are waaaaaaayyy overpriced. I love the bread, cheesecake and the spicy black pepper chix is my favorite dish. The drinks over waaaaaaaay overpriced also. Love n Hate relationship with this place."
Talmo F.,"Atlanta, GA",84,57,84,4.0,4/25/2015,"I'll have one of everything, please. The only challenge is parking. Buffalo blasts, orange chicken, and the goat cheese and beet salad are my favorite."
Krystle S.,"Atlanta, GA",8,2,2,4.0,1/1/2014,Had a date here for the new Year and it was so sweet we knew we would have a wait so it didn't bother us the host was so nice and worked with us to get a good table. Plus our server Darnel was so sweet even comping our food so that I Could get something else. No complaints really Just didnt like one of the drinks from the bar and the divinci pasta wasn't doing it for me it tasted like it had no sauce. But Darnel switched it out for another bistro shrimp pasta that was so yummy.
Shaun W.,"Snellville, GA",38,7,8,3.0,9/20/2014,"My family and I arrived at the restaurant just before 9pm after spending the evening shopping. We were told there would be a 40 minute wait, we were given a pager and we sat outside to wait. After noticing that the majority of the other guests that were waiting had been seated, I checked with the hostess to find out how much longer our wait would be. When I handed the hostess my pager she looked in the system and she seemed very confused. She checked with another hostess because she could not find our pager number in the system. He told her he paged us already and went back to what he was doing. The original hostess told me to go get the rest of my party and that we would be seated right away. I did that and when we got back to the desk they continued to seat other parties. I finally had to ask if they were going to seat us and eventfully our name was called. I immediately asked to speak to a manager and I explained the situation. She said it's not their fault the pager didn't work. I, of course, understand that if it was true that we received a busted pager, it obviously wasn't their fault but a simple apology would have diffused the situation and in all of my years in customer service, I've never told an angry customer that something wasn't my fault.  The manager did offer to comp an appetizer after I expressed my extreme displeasure with the service I received but when the bill came, the ""free"" appetizer had not been taken off. I realize I am just one of the Cheesecake Factory's thousands of customers and I truly felt that way today. I felt like they just wanted to get me out of there, happy or not, so they could move on with their night."
John S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,24,2,5.0,5/27/2015,"This is our standby when we can't think of anything else on the fly.  Frequent this place at least once a week.  We normally sit at the tables at the bar, service was a bit slow this time but not too bad.  I normally have sheilas salad and it was perfect as normal.  Love the new white bread that they give you, lot better than the old white bread.  Good job bakery!"
Judy L.,"Atlanta, GA",518,285,1922,5.0,11/11/2011,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I've been visiting this location for years now. I'm finally writing a review. I came here a few nights ago with 20+ people for a birthday party. The bad thing about big party reservations is that the whole party has to be there or else they can't hold it for you.  I always order the spaghetti with meat sauce. They take a simple American classic dish and makes it as good as it can get. This dish never fails me. However, this time, I wanted to try other dishes they had on their menu. I ordered off of their specialties selection of their menu. I ordered the chicken bellagio. It is a ""Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad"" as described on their menu. It was good, however, I'm not a fan of the thin fried chicken ""steaks"" or patties. The pasta was good, surprisingly, with the arugula salad (that I mixed with it). It also comes with a thinly sliced ham on top of the salad. The server described it as ""pork"". Overall, it was pretty good. I still had a lot left over because the portions are really big. My boyfriend ordered thai chicken pasta which was very delish. It is cooked with green and ""normal"" pasta with chunks of chicken with bean sprouts. Sort of like pad thai. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It is one of the best calamari I've ever had. It comes with marinara and tartar sauce. My boyfriend ordered the coke and tequila mixed (coke & jose cuervo) drink which he didn't think was mixed well.  Also, the cheesecake here is very good also. I didn't order it this time for we brought in a birthday cake. Their dessert menu is very extensive.  Overall, I had a great experience and it was well worth my money since you get large portions that you could eat for the next day."
Tina W.,"Atlanta, GA",128,3,1,5.0,6/21/2015,"I love the atmosphere and the appearance, and i must not forget the food is Great!"
Jackie H.,"Atlanta, GA",316,419,286,4.0,8/2/2011,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  I just feel good when I walk in here.  I like the decor, the service, the people, and the food.  I have tried many items on the menu, which is really a book, and my absolute favorite is the Chicken Madeira.   Were you there one day and heard someone at the next table slurping and smacking very loudly?  Yeah, that was me.  I had picked up the plate and was drinking and licking the rest of the Madeira sauce off of it.  I didn't notice you looking at me.   Whenever I go, the service is always on point, the drinks are good and strong, and I leave a very happy woman.   Plus, I love their Happy Hour.  M-F 1/2 priced appetizers ($5) and huge portions.  $5 drinks.  I'm a regular Bae!"
