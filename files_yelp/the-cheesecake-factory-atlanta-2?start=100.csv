Bee B.,"Marietta, GA",98,2,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Very poor customer service...I called to place a to go order and was asked to hold for one moment, the female Lola never came back to the phone and after 12 minutes of holding a male picked up and stated that he just seen the line holding and asked to help, I told him I had been on hold a long time and only wanted to place a order, he stated he would transfer me to the bakery and they would assist me , I was transfer and left on hold almost another 20 mins before some one answered and finally took my order."
Penny A.,"Aurora, Canada",1,27,9,5.0,1/31/2017,"First time here, got the herb crusted salmon that comes with mash and asparagus. It was amazing, I'm trying to inquire how to buy a huge tray of that mashed potato because I've honestly never had such a good mashed potato experience in my life. We also got macaroni cheese balls which were okay and some buffalo chicken springroll/egg roll thing that was just okay. Cheesecake was obviously good got the carrot and some chocolate one."
Francisco C.,"Atlanta, GA",61,3,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Mediocre service, to top it off my steak was tasteless. I would not recommend anyone to eat here if you want to have a good experience.. I will deffinently not be returning.."
Sam L.,"Doraville, GA",0,2,5,1.0,10/31/2016,"This was my 2nd time here, and the food quality was poor, and the service is definitely suck, and accidentally left my wallet there and went back to pick it up on the day after, and all my cash was missing, they say they gonna ask and call me back, which I have no faith on them! And like I say till now they haven't even get in touch with me."
Toni R.,"Tucker, GA",56,57,1,2.0,11/10/2016,"On Monday, 11/07/16 we went in for lunch and it was VERY good..... Then our server Teresa got our bill wrong 2 times....76.00.....53.00 (which was less than what we owed so we honestly let her know to add our desert to the bill) and finally 62.00 (the correct amount). We were told that the incorrect amounts would be credited back to the account in 24hrs.....By Wednesday the 53.00 had dropped of but not the first charge of 76.00. The manager Tony asked that we speak with someone in the office by the name of Amber but we were also told to contact our bank. Needless to say the customer should not have to do the leg work to correct the employees mistake. Hopefully everything will be settled by the end of the week.. It's just inconvenient to have your money tied up like that."
Yvette J.,"Montgomery, AL",0,5,,3.0,7/29/2017,Great atmosphere but cold. It was pretty busy but understandable for a Saturday night. We had a long wait for our food so we asked for it to go cause it was so late and we were tired. Our server told us about all the problems the kitchen was having and it reflected in the quality of our food. Our server was great just want to make that known.
Carrie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",128,145,329,4.0,5/20/2016,"Had a great time here! The food was delicious, the server was friendly and personably, we were seated immediately, our food came out quickly and the server grabbed some pals and sang me happy birthday! You can't really go wrong at Cheesecake Factory, there has got to be something on the menu for everyone!"
Hoa Binh N.,"Gainesville, GA",0,7,,5.0,1/2/2017,"Food always good and consistent.  Staff always nice and friendly. Such a long wait today!  Almost an hour. Holiday week, can't blame them."
Stanley M.,"North Augusta, SC",25,55,114,5.0,6/3/2016,What can I say every factory I go to I have a great experience this location no exception service food all great only thing that happy hour needs to be little longer other than that keep doing what you do making great food
Michael C.,"Wild Rose, WI",25,2,1,1.0,10/17/2016,We went there tonight October 11th 2016.  I ordered the chicken burrito.   I asked if they could substitute beef for the chicken!  She said sure!  I got the bill and they charged me $4.95 for the beef!  Lol!  Well that's the last time I go there!  I did not finish it!  It was loaded with rice and very little beef!  Their loss!
Elizabeth N.,"Kennesaw, GA",120,102,156,4.0,4/19/2015,"The food is always amazing here. The servers are extremely helpful too. With such an extensive menu, this is especially important!.. I had order something new and she double checked to make sure i knew what i was getting then suggested a better option. Definitely try the salmon egg rolls and miso salmon. It's incredible!! I soooo miss there blueberry mojito. Their Reese's cheesecake is awesome tho btw."
John G.,"Kennesaw, GA",100,278,473,2.0,4/25/2015,"Didn't start off great when a 45 min wait turned into hour and 15 min, drink orders were mangled badly and two of the meals weren't even up to sub par with not a bit of seasons for two out of the four of us. By end of the meal and desert regretted choosing this location and atmosphere was a bit upended tonight.  For a party of four spending $200 you expect a lot better and this was sub-par where a Denny's or Diner would have been better. They definitely need better training for waitstaff and chefs need to be tasting what they serve."
Lou A.,"Oceanside, CA",1,10,,2.0,6/21/2017,"I travel frequently and normally don't write reviews. I went to CF because they usually have good food and service. I ate at the bar because I was alone. The bartender, Dex, made my drink exactly as I asked. I ordered chicken Madeira for dinner. The plate was hot, the potatoes were cold and the chicken was tiny and covered in semi warm mozzarella cheese. Go for a drink from Dex but not for dinner."
Taira D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"Had a great meal at a neighboring restaurant, but wanted a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Stopped by to grab a slice at the cheesecake counter and the young lady behind the register tells me that there's a 15 minute wait. For cheesecake that is literally in front of my face and to go boxes in front of her. Unacceptable. No wonder the reviews aren't very great. Called a manager to ask for an explanation, but was transferred/placed on hold. And no one answered. So I guess I'll call corporate and ask what the purpose of the cheesecake take-out counter is if you have to wait that long. Disappointing."
Bill R.,"Smyrna, GA",0,14,,2.0,6/30/2017,Very slow lunch service. Food ok except salad had some pretty badly wilted lettuce.  Won't go back to this location.
Ann W.,"Havre de Grace, MD",8,33,8,1.0,11/3/2016,"Awful. Everyone at my table was served but me. When their meals were half gone another waitress came by and asked if I ordered anything. I said that I had and she said she would check on it. Needless to say she never came back. When the meal was over and we were ready for a checks the original waitress came by and asked if I still wanted mine after I pointed it out that I never got my order. I declined, asked to speak to the manager, and she huffed that she already told him to come over. When he did come over he did apologize and asked how he could make it better. By that time I was to angry and her horrible service on top of my own personal experience. He did try to offer me my order to go at no charge, but I was to angry to even eat. Stay away, there are 3 other AMAZING places that are worth the money and time."
Sandeep G.,"Alpharetta, GA",37,213,6,5.0,6/20/2015,"The only restaurant that has such a diverse menu. Today was a Father's Day lunch with my daughter. We reached around 1:00 PM and were able to get a place almost immediately.  The service was great the food was good. I ordered Stuffed Mushrooms and Pretzel Chicken from the ""Small Plate menu"" and both were very well executed with some very great flavor. My daughter ordered Chicken Bellagio and took half of it back home. Overall a great experience. We skipped the Cheesecake though."
Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, CA",607,405,1744,4.0,12/28/2014,"My mommy wanted a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake and begged me to go with her to Cheesecake Factory after shopping--how can you say ""no"" to mommy??? We walked in and they were just as busy as the Cheesecake Factory in the Bay...slammed!  We walked past the people waiting and went into the bar area where we could easily grab a hightop table for a quick drink and slice of cheesecake.   Our server greeted us quickly and brought the coffee, cocktails and cheesecake just as fast.  What a great idea! I cannot speak for the actual meals, as we had already eaten; however, I can vouch for the cheesecake.  The cheesecake is always so good, no matter which location you visit, and consistency is really a key to success in any restaurant.  I am not a big sweets person, but I will always have ""just one bite"" with my companions.  I like the fact that I always know what I will be getting with the desserts at Cheesecake Factory. Still catching up on my Thanksgiving reviews....thank you for being patient.  This was before that awful foot surgery...I am just happy I could visit my fam and teach them about yelp. Stephani Smiles for CF ;)"
Stuart B.,"Atlanta, GA",11,3,1,2.0,12/14/2016,"What a shame. These folks have a beautiful room with nice high ceilings, and kitschy, Hollywood movie set look, a gorgeous bar and plenty of space.  We were met with blank stares (by the afternoon manager) and shuffled off to a noisy seat by the kitchen after asking to be moved from a boring, cramped, two-top booth looking out to the side parking lot. I explained to the manager and staff that I was taking my son out for lunch after college finals and we wanted to enjoy the space (which was not at all crowded at 3:30 pm). Over the din of tacky tourist muzak and clattering plates and glasses, I asked that we move again, this time a little closer to the bar. Again, the room is nice and airy, but the tacky muzak just beats down on your mind and provides great cover for the waitrons to momentarily acknowledge the customer, throw stuff on the table and keep moving.  My son said his Kobe beef burger was great. My ""Jambalaya"" pasta was so-so...spicey and plentiful, but frozen shrimp and dry chicken place keepers were inexpertly prepared and presented.  ""Close...but no cigar"". The contempt by the manager and staff for the suckers whom wander in to overpay for the mediocre, loud tourist experience is pretty thinly veiled--but given cover by the relentless cacophony pressing down from above. Why unlock the doors and let folks in if you don't really want them there? I mean...show more love, man. Turn the Muzak down a little.  What a shame. Such a nice room."
Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, GA",949,1375,5317,3.0,1/15/2014,"it's always really hard for me to review a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, but I'm going to give it a shot. I always remember Cheesecake Factory as HUGE portions for the price you pay. I prefer getting the classics, and you can't go wrong with the Shepherd's Pie or the Meatloaf. Any of the pastas aren't bad as well. Everything here is quite heavy, and the cheesecakes are intimidating but the best (and unhealthiest) dessert ever. RED VELVET CHEESECAKE ftw. They offer a Skinny menu for healthier eating... but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory, why bother, just go all the way :)  Service is usually pretty good here. Although it's quite busy, I've never had to wait more than 10-20 minutes for a table, whatever the size of our group is (I've never been during a peak hour before though so that may be an inaccurate estimate). The servers are usually nice and friendly. One of my friends dropped his flatbread seconds after the server delivered it to our table. Although I'm sure both parties were at fault (the server set it down dangerously close to the edge, and my slightly buzzed friend brushed past the platter when standing up to go the bathroom, they quickly moved to replace it free of charge, as it should be. Drinks take a while to be served, so I advise ordering them early on so you're not chugging it near the end of your meal."
