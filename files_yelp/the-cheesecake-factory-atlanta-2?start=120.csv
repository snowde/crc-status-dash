Marcia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,348,396,5.0,6/3/2015,"It was Saturday night and we were famished, decided to call ahead to see what the wait time was for 2 hungry folks, 10-15 minutes we were told and we were sold! They held true to their word! We were seated and service was awesome! I ordered the shrimp scampi and he ordered the miso salmon. Both dishes were esquisitely delicious. Got our desserts to go, dutch apple cheesecake and Lemoncello torte. Never a disappointment! Parking can be a bit of a pain."
Tavi H.,"Duluth, GA",88,67,150,3.0,3/16/2015,"I love this place and the food is always good. The cocktail drinks are awesome and on Que. Yesterday, the first day of sunny and warm weather, me and my lovely decide to go find a terrace for dinner. Everywhere seemed to be packed, but we got lucky and caught a table outside at Cheesecake Factory. Everything was good except the service. Our server was distracted and border line rude. Maybe the big crowd was a factor in her behavior, lack of experience or the other extreme; being burned out from serving.  Ether way, I still left her 20% tip. Not sure if that was the right think to do since I do not like to reward that kind of behavior. I guess I will let the universe take care of that."
Michael C.,"Atlanta, GA",49,12,12,4.0,11/21/2016,"GF - welp if you are Gluten free and craving a hamburger and shake your are in the right place.  It was too busy to even attempt to eat here Saturday evening,  Monday night much less crowded.  I really don't know how anyone can give less than 3 stars cause you pretty much know what you are getting if you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory before.  I'm picturing if I was to scroll through 500 + reviews I would see an average of 3s and 4s.  I want a 3.5 option soooo 4 it is then if it gets up to 4 I'll let someone else be the bad guy, unless it's me the next time I'm here very soon.  I like to say this is where the ladies come to get wasted on marand pretend they came for desert."
Rachel P.,"Schererville, IN",99,2,6,1.0,4/30/2017,I wish there was a way to rate this Cheesecake Factory less than one star because it doesn't even deserve one star. I don't even know where to begin. After we were seated it took a good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence to get us drinks. We then waited an hour for our food & when we finally did get our food 3 out of 5 meals were cold. When we informed the waiter about it he asked if we would like him to heat it up for us and then informed us that the area where the pasta is cooked is not working properly so none of the pasta items were cooked correctly but still brought it to the table for us to eat knowing it was not up to standards. We also only saw our waiter maybe every 30 minutes. My friend ordered a lunch menu item and because we were there for so long they then charged her item as a dinner entree because lunch was now over. (Even though when we ordered our food it was still lunch) I think our drinks were refilled once in the 2+ hours we were there. The table next to us waited almost 20 minutes until their order was even taken & the table on the other side got up and left because no one ever came to help them. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but me and my party of 5 will probably never be returning after this awful ridiculous experience. Unless you're not hungry and have 3 hours to kill with terrible service then this is the place for you.
Elshadai S.,"Lithonia, GA",51,1,,1.0,9/3/2017,"We were sat relatively quickly, however we waited over 23 minutes and still were not seen. A party of 6 and a party of 2 were sat at least ten minutes after us and they were seen. Many servers walked past us and said nothing. I can understand not worrying about a table if it isn't yours but if you see menus on the table with no bread for an extended period of time, it's just curtious to ask if we have been helped. I honestly thought that we were being treated that way because the servers did not think we were going to tip them well. But it is not fair for someone to judge us before they even served us. We had to inform someone that we had not been seen. And even after we told the hostess we were still not seen. I had to ask for a manger to explain that we had been waiting for so long and it was not fair especially since all the surrounding restaurants were preparing to close. Otherwise I would have gladly just left. The manager quickly sat us down and our server was great. The food was ok, but I expected to get some kind of complimentary offer or a discount for waiting so long. Overall I feel like I just wasted my money and my time."
Ma S.,"Buford, GA",1,2,,1.0,12/2/2016,"So me and my boyfriend are both In the restaurant industry, we are both GM of two different restaurants and today we finally had some time for owerself with out the kids and decided to go out to eat, we made the HUGE mistake to go and eat at this place. It took 25 minutes for us to see our server we actually had to ask for her, she finally came and took our order and  when she walked 4 feet away from us to the computer she had already forgotten our APP order. Food came and she never checked on us. And we sat there after we where done eating for a good 45 mins, we finally found someone to flag down and when se told our server we needed her, she just kept walking without even looking back to the table. It wasn't even busy he got there at 11:00 and left by 12:40am. UNACCEPTABLE!!! On our way out we let the host know and he raised his eyebrow like he didn't care and I noticed in my way to the car he and the ""manager"" where just looking at us laughing... DISRESPECTFUL!! I had to give one star otherwise I wouldn't be able to share this unforgettable experience it's a complete insult to what customer service means! Now I know where I won't be back!"
Alicia E.,"Acworth, GA",35,60,10,5.0,9/21/2016,"This was my first trip to the Perimeter location, and it did not disappoint. Our server (gosh I wish I could remember her name) was terrific! There were 12 in our party, and we arrived a little before 6pm on a Sunday and were seated almost immediately. Our food was all made as ordered, delivered hot & fresh, our server kept our drinks refilled... It was perfect. My boyfriend & I hot our usual Stuffed Chicken Triangles, and Buffalo Blasts... Wonderful as usual. Thank you, thank you!"
Shawn W.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",122,470,2428,4.0,1/26/2015,It's the usual case with Cheesecake Factory. This is one of the few chains where service is consistently good and the food is good. I am a person that prefers places with small menus but this place has a large menu. I try something new every time no matter where I am at and the food is always good. I ordered the meatloaf this time and my companion ordered the jambalaya. Food came out promptly and the service was attentive and no complaints. I am usually a type of guy that prefers tomatoes and ketchup on his meatloaf but the caramelized onions and gravy was quite tasty and made me reconsider my meatloaf choices so far in life.
Alvin W.,"Tucker, GA",290,81,74,5.0,10/24/2015,"This is a very nice place to eat. They don't jest give you small portions of food, you get a lot. The waitresses are very good at what they do. I spent $120 here and it was well worth it. That was four people eating. Had a great time and will return."
Terralyn W.,"Houston, TX",26,12,,3.0,2/7/2016,"This isn't one of my top choices to visit this particular location in the Metro area, but I was with my cousin celebrating her birthday. We walked in, and was acknowledged and seated quickly. Our server was attentive, and and friendly (and easy on the eyes lol). I wasn't really hungry being that I had just left the mall, and screwed up my appetite there, so I opted for a small appetizer.  I chose the loaded baked potato tots. It was labeled as a baked tot filled with cheese, bacon, and green onions served with sour cream. Sounds promising, so I'm amped about trying it. When they reached the table, it looked like a freakin hush puppy. So, I'm like what in the bleu cheese hell, and decided to go for it anyway. Ughhhh, so disappointed. It was filled with something like fondue cheese, and I never tasted bacon. The green onions were sparsely thrown on top of the sour cream.  The only thing that saved this rating was the cheesecake (Adam's), and the cute server. Other than that...it was a fail."
Juan C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,3.0,3/12/2017,The pasta with shrimp and sausage is actually pasta with sausage. It only came with 3 shrimps.
Dae B.,"Roswell, GA",15,24,,1.0,8/13/2015,"If your server is Martin M, be prepared to be underwhelmed. He did not write down our order and as a result brought out my girlfriend's meal with peppers instead of without. He then, when she mentioned it but added that she just wanted to go ahead and eat, had the balls to say ""I can't help you if you don't tell me what you want me to do."" Needless to say, this piece of work only got a 10% tip (if that) from a fellow sever. If I pulled that shit at my place I'd be out of a job."
A G.,"Lithonia, GA",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2017,"To whom it may concern, This is a two-part story, I visited your Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter on 2 occasions and the experience was very unacceptable. 1st occasion, we went in January of 2017 on a Saturday around noon or so, we were placed in a booth; 15-20 mins passed; no server came and I decided this isn't going to go well, lets just leave. The restaurant was empty because it just opened therefore my motto is, if it don't feel right, just go. 2nd occasion, March 22nd, 2017.  We went after shopping and the wait was not long, maybe 15mins;  It was me, my son and girlfriend.  My Waiter-Marcus came and we ordered our drinks, food, and appetizer.  Everything rolling along fine until we placed our order.  Appetizer came out within 15mins, after that radio silence. My girlfriend ordered the turkey burger, I ordered the Gumbo, and my son order the Filet Mignon, therefore we were spending a good amount of money w/ drinks.  After 25-30 mins, we looking around like where is the food; Marcus comes by and says nonchalantly let me check on your food.  About 5 mins later (30-35 total),  turkey burger came and Gumbo. I ordered my gumbo w/ white rice which sits in the middle of the bowl, this one had brown rice. I told the server I order Gumbo w/ white rice. The server said here I will bring you out some white rice, I said no take this back, that is not what I ordered. He stated it only sits in the middle.  I am like, did he just try and give me a different version of what I order and wanted me to make the adjustments on the plate that I am paying for.  I told him to take the plate back and bring it out correctly.  During this point our server Marcus is no-where to be found in response to the mishap.  And notice, I did not mention my sons plate, because he hasn't received it.  So now, here comes my corrected Gumbo w/ white rice, no apology or anything.  Also here comes the Filet Mignon w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. My son ordered a Filet Mignon w/ French fries and broccoli. We look at the plate and say, are you serious?  Mind you that's a $30 dollar dish, at this point Marcus appears and I inform him, this is not what we ordered, His response, "" I'll bring him out some fries and broccoli"" (i.e No accountability or apology).  He brings out a bowl of broccoli and unseasoned fries, and says my bad to my son.  At this point, Marcus isn't even worth eye contact because I'm upset. I am the type of person that if good service and quality food is provided, I will forever patron your restaurant.  Because, I can count on feeling good about the entire experience.  I don't know why the service was so horrible nor do I care because I am the customer and Marcus was the face of Cheesecake at that point.  You had 3 orders, got 1 right and 2 wrong, that's 33.3%; that's below failing.  I hate when people do not tip and give good service a hard time, but on occasions like these, I see no reason for anyone to hold back if they want that type of confrontation.  Me, I am a little more reserved and better voicing my opinion in other ways, such as this.   Finally when the check comes, there isn't an apology or nothing.  I am like this is ridiculous.  I expect more from a location such as yours and its disheartening knowing people aren't treated with the type of service they are paying for, And the only reason Marcus got a tip which was 14.00 dollars on a 100.00 tab is because we chose to come and eat there.  But, let that had been no tip, the only comment would have been, black people don't tip, even though the service you provided was awful; between you and the kitchen staff.   I am not a waiter but if I was, my main goal would be to provide the type of service that you cant deny giving me an exceptional tip no matter what is going on in my life, that is blocked out because I am working. I am very disappoint in Cheesecake Perimeter."
Joseph W.,"Columbia, MD",75,229,48,4.0,8/28/2014,outside visitor to the area. Pretty much like every other cheesecake factory. Lights dim. Food was okay. Triple chocolate cheesecake was on point. Service was great.
Galina Z.,"Tucker, GA",17,33,23,3.0,1/13/2016,"The food was great and drinks too But the service was atrocious.  Note to the management: if you have trainees on Tuesdays night, charge like 50% less, otherwise it is a expensive cruel joke what you do to your customers. Spent $150 , but I could do better as a waiter, even I never tried."
Kat B.,"Lexington, SC",1,23,46,4.0,2/5/2015,I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory! They have a variety of items to choose from that are gluten free and freshly made salads!  My one point of contention is the lighting. Our table was so dark we couldn't read the menu.  I ordered the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake and it was divine!
Jackson N.,"Decatur, GA",54,23,7,4.0,9/3/2016,"Most of the time I go I order the farfalle. It is a delicious pasta entree with bacon bits, chicken, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. Sometimes that particular entree is saltier than usual and sometimes its more on the bland side. When I inform the waiter/waitress, they take it back and fix it and it's fine after. I recommend the place and that dish."
Tracy M.,"Duluth, GA",3,4,19,5.0,1/28/2016,"He gave me a big surprise, in the style made me feel the chef's intentions; in taste, really fresh and delicious! Worth everyone to enjoy! Attitude is also very good, the restaurant environment is impeccable! I like this place！！"
Jay S.,"Jefferson, GA",44,68,159,3.0,11/23/2014,"I always here the hype of this place for so long and finally decided to go here with my gf cause she was craving a dish there. My first impressions, the interior was pretty nice, we got seated pretty quick, our service was great, we ordered some calamari to start it off and for our mains we ordered the Chicken Marsala and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic . Both dishes were very good, but also very very heavy, we ended up not even finishing our dishes. For dessert i ordered some strawberry short cake and some chocolate cake for my gf, both were very good.Overall i think thought the food was actually pretty good, but just too heavy for me, i actually like to finish all my food and enjoy my dinner. Maybe next time i'll try ordering something else. But for those who haven't been here, id say it good to try it once if you havent, i'd prolly go back there sometime but maybe not anytime soon. I ended up spending about 70dollars total for dinner but didn't really seem satisfied. Different strokes for different folks tho. The food wasn't bad at all, i just enjoy eating alot more variety of food that is alot more lighter."
Ronald W.,"Alpharetta, GA",42,9,40,4.0,12/5/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very similar to their other Atlanta locations: decent drinks, good menu, and delicious cakes. I just took my date to this location tonight, so my review will be based off my isolated-experience: this restaurant was good, and does deserve my 4-star review. The main reason I took ""one star off"" is, like my fellow consumers, the Cheesecake reservation system sucks (in my opinion). Granted, this location is next to Perimeter Mall, and the restaurant is always overwhelm with customers (so I don't blame them for not implementing a tradition ""Call-ahead reservation system"". Thus, I will leave my review with a question to the Cheesecake Factory management: At peak customer-traffic time, is there any way that you can improve the crowded-ness of your Customer Waiting Line? Just tonight, I had to pass 20+ people just to get to your hostess... (just my two-cents)"
