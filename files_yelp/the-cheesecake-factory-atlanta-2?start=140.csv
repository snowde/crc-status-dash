Jon B.,"Mendham Borough, NJ",4,151,76,1.0,4/18/2016,I have to agree with most everyone on here. Service is terrible. Painfully slow even when restaurant is empty. I'm guessing management just sits in the back and doesn't care what happens. Food averages 35 minutes to get no matter how basic- salad 35 minutes. Glass of tea- 35 minutes-  basket of bread 35 minutes. You get the picture? Asked to speak to a manager we left after 15 minutes and no manager.
Christy G.,"Lilburn, GA",81,16,9,1.0,8/1/2015,"I am usually incredibly pleased with the Cheesecake Factory. However, this visit was the worst. From dirty floors to poor service to cheesecake that looked nibbled on. I will stick with the Mall of Georgia location. Never again will I come to the perimeter location."
Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2413,3.0,9/7/2012,"(Note: Since it's been a very long time since I'd last dined inside this particular Cheesecake Factory, this review is specifically for the take out section.) After enjoying our lunch at Maggiano's Little Italy on a Sunday afternoon, my sister wanted dessert, but not just any kind.  My sister was craving GOOD cheesecake, and she wanted to treat me, too!  =)  Since it was blazing hot that day, I drove the (incredibly) short distance from Maggiano's to park closer to this Cheesecake Factory. We walked straight to the take out counter, which is on the right as soon as you enter the restaurant.  There was one customer in front of us, and since my sister and I pretty much knew what we wanted, we had made our decisions on which cheesecakes we wanted by the time the customer was done ordering. To make a long story short, the employee taking orders at the cash register was busy taking orders over the phone and preparing take out meals.  We stood and waited at least five minutes before she finally took our cheesecake orders, and we specifically requested whipped cream to be included on the side (since I wasn't sure whether they always provided whipped cream).  After ordering and paying, we waited another ten minutes or so for our cheesecakes.  The employee was not friendly or apologetic about the delay. When we finally got our cheesecakes, we looked at both to ensure we got the right ones and that they had whipped cream.  Neither included whipped cream, and one order was incorrect.  My sister had ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, but she got the Oreo one instead.  WOW.  So we requested the whipped cream again, which they put in plastic containers.  And, of course, my sister notified them of the mistake they made. If you've never ordered the Red Velvet cheesecake, you should know that it is a HUGE slice, so it's put in a plastic container that is larger than the standard cheesecake slice container.  The container is large enough to fit a huge salad.  However, instead of putting the large container in a plastic bag for her to carry, the employee simply handed it over to her.  Per my suggestion to request a bag, my sister got one because it would have been awkward to carry the large container, and of course there's a higher risk of dropping it on the way to my car without a bag.   Once we got home, we didn't eat our cheesecakes right away since they were no longer cold.  We put them in the fridge for a few hours and let them chill so that we could enjoy them later. * Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake ($6.95) - Per the menu description, this is a ""Silky Chocolate Cheesecake Topped with a Layer of Belgian Chocolate Mousse.""  Although I'm normally not a dessert person, I am a huge fan of chocolate mousse.  This cheesecake was as delicious as it sounds.  I just love the smooth texture of mousse, and it isn't overly rich like regular chocolate frosting.  You must put a bit of whipped cream on each bite!  Yuuuum...  =) * Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95) - ""Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake and our Original Cheesecake covered with our special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting.""  It's HEAVENLY.  There isn't much else to say, but I really like that there isn't an overly cheesy/milky aftertaste as some red velvet cakes have.  I definitely want to get this one next time! Overall, The Cheesecake Factory (take out section ONLY) at Perimeter Mall gets 3.5 stars because the cheesecake is amazing, but service wasn't.  The cheesecake itself easily deserves 5 stars.  So good!  I know this will sound crazy, but their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is the best red velvet that I have ever tasted!  I can't believe I had never tried it until recently.  I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already!

Per T.,"Dallas, TX",40,21,11,3.0,12/6/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has been our go to place whenever we have come in to Atlanta on Sundays for meetings the coming week. This time there was a slight disappointment that many things were not working.  Ran out of Stella draught beer,  no milk for a cappuccino and our cheesecake salted caramel was not available. According to the manager it had been a very busy weekend and supply couldn't meet up with demand. Overall our food was good, miso salmon was excellent and so was the pork chop and the fish and chips. When I got the bill I was disappointed to see that the percentage tip recommendation is based on the after tax amount, that seems like trying to trick customers to pay a higher tip."
Tricia W.,"McLean, VA",0,4,,5.0,1/28/2017,"This is my son's favorite restaurant. But it's not just because of the food: Thank you to the delightful Joe (from Haiti) who works behind the counter, and the lovely ladies who work on take-out orders too. You make it a pleasure to brave the crowds and endure the line. Merci!"
Britney N.,"Marietta, GA",613,4,,1.0,1/3/2017,"Food was great but service was...not. Drinks never refilled, no recommendations, no attention, no personality. Just as I felt like my  boyfriend and I were purposely being neglected I noticed another one of our waitresses tables standing looking around for her. We started with the avocado egg rolls which never seem to disappoint. Upon finishing our appetizer, our waitress asked if we were still hungry and never asked how the food was. The Chicken Bellagio entree we chose was amazing. We were wanting a dessert but couldn't stomach spending any more money with someone who didn't bother to mention her name to us one time. Found her name on the receipt; thanks for the Most basic service Janea W."
Dean H.,"Newnan, GA",6,33,,5.0,7/24/2016,"What a wonderful place!! They have a great selection of food and the most amazing cheesecakes!! This place has not too bad prices. A great place for families and especially dates. Wonderful decor, great friendly service and dimmed lighting."
Endalk T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Zero customer service, looks like this place run with out manager. Normally I don't like to write bad review... This passed weekend we had a very bad experience at this location we are waiting so long for our server came to take our orders... He seems looks like he's not ready for work   To come back on the business all staff including the manager needs more customer services training."
Ivan T.,"Dallas, TX",0,14,2,2.0,1/15/2017,"Poor customer service eg inattentive wait staff, slow service and average food quality."
Bob W.,"Atlanta, GA",201,77,109,4.0,8/5/2016,What can I say. The cheesecake is awesome. I wish they would bring back the Pina Coloda cake. That was the best. My go to cheesecake is Vanilla bean. It's somewhere to eat when you know hat to expect in a meal. They have a variety of dishes that won't disappoint. Salmon several ways and many chicken dishes. I love the Kale salad and the crab dip. Overall great service and a wide variety of drinks.
Jean D.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,26,,2.0,1/28/2017,This location was very disappointing. Don't order the chicken salad with the soup. The chicken salad had the grisel of the chicken in it. It was served on a stale 1/4 of a piece of white bread very disappointed. My husband ordered a salad with honey mustard dressing they brought it out with the wrong dressing then took it to the back and removed the wrong dressing but returning the same salad. They did not make a new one. It was my daughters birthday so we ordered her a piece of cheesecake for $7.95 it was half the size and three dollars more than it used to be.. Not worth it
Thomas L.,"Atlanta, GA",8,79,33,3.0,4/5/2015,"Almost every Cheesecake Factory I go to seems to always be packed. The Perimeter Mall location is not really an exception, you might be able to eat at a lull sometimes but I've seen this place be busy at 3 PM or 9 PM, so it's a bit of a crapshoot. Cheesecake factory always has a huge menu of options, like any place with so many options you'll get some things that are better than others. The fried mac and cheese appetizers are really good, they give you 4 and that will fill 2 people up before any entree itself. I've had entrees like chicken parm, philly cheesesteak, and some of the pasta dishes. I think overall the quantity is huge, they give you a lot for what you're paying. The food doesn't always taste quite cohesive, for example the philly cheesesteak has too many large peppers that kind overpower the meat. Service and quality can be variable sometimes, when it gets busy it can be hard to get a waiter or waitress, and i agree with some of the comments that you might notice a few dirty plates/utensils because they didn't clean it well (perhaps they just put it in a washer without scrubbing completely). I do think they try to make the place clean but with so much foot traffic the quality of cleanliness seems to drop sometimes. Overall it kinda does feel like a factory, there's large quantities of decent food at ok prices, but a lot of small details can get overlooked with service and cleanliness."
Tameka S.,"Conyers, GA",91,32,252,4.0,9/5/2015,The food was good as usual. The ambiance is great. The dessert and strawberry lemonade is to die for. It's a great place for large groups and children.
Lakisha J.,"Atlanta, GA",76,9,1,2.0,5/4/2015,"This past Saturday, I dined at the Cheescake Factory at Permieter Mall with my family and unfortunately, it was not a good experience. Our server was great but my meal, the ""Herb Crusted Salmon"" was not what I expected.  It was neither hot nor fresh; and when I sent it back, the manager brought the food out within a matter of minutes.  I asked how it was possible for the food to be ready so fast and if this was fresh.  She said yes but after I looked at my plate, I could tell that it was the same piece of salmon because the corner that I bitten off of was missing.  When I questioned her about it not being fresh, she stated that it was not against company policy for them to reheat food.  I was appalled because I am very well aware of the dangers associated with  improperly reheating foods and the potential illness it can cause. I said ok, asked for my check, and left the restaurant.  I'm certain that I will never return.  When I walk into any establishment spending my money, I expect to be treated with the upmost respect for my time and for my money."
PjKt A.,"Atlanta, GA",1,40,158,2.0,4/11/2015,"Our waitress was the ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!! Food was just ""ok."" Not worth the time or the money! Only thing I would say was half way decent was the cheesecake...however it left an after taste...not worth it if you ask me."
Jon-Michael M.,"Stone Mountain, GA",25,91,42,4.0,7/8/2015,"Have you tried brunch here?!?  Good stuff, and the prices aren't bad at all!  You can actually find brunch items for as low as $8 to $9.  Service is usually good here.  Prepare for a crowd and possible wait, depending on what time you arrive.  I would say between 10am and 11am for less, after 12pm for more!  The French Toast here is definitely on point!   If you're a Reese's fan, definitely try the Peanut Butter / Chocolate Cheesecake."
Stephanie C.,"Atlanta, GA",420,109,138,4.0,3/30/2015,My boyfriend and I go here alk the time. It is probably my favorite restaurant to go to because of the variety of food to pick from. They always have a fast service when you are seated inside but I think sitting outside is a different story. When outside everything seems a lot slower. The only time we have sat outside is the only bad experience we ever had there. The waiter would make very rude comments and got very impatient with my boyfriend and I. She did not get our order right and came back 2 times to ask us questions about the order. But this one experience will not over ride all the good ones!! Try the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake!! It's my favorite!! And the mushroom appetizer is so amazingly yummy!!
Jen L.,"Atlanta, GA",208,326,620,5.0,12/20/2013,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory almost all my life! I've never had a bad meal here ever! The Iced Mint Green Tea is always fantastic! I love a number of entrees that I get repetitively such as the ones listed below: Chicken Marsala Chicken Lettuce Wraps Chicken Madeira Chicken Piccata Grilled Salmon.  Believe it or not, I'm not the biggest Cheesecake lover in the world but I have tried the Chocolate Cookie Dough Peanut Butter Cheesecake which was quite yummy! This is a great place to go on a date or have special occasion celebration dinner. The food, drinks, desserts, service etc. is just superb!"
Marian M.,"Atlanta, GA",1,127,85,3.0,7/20/2015,"I know a lot of people like Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is extensive and a great selection. It is not a place I would choose to have a tasty meal. Of course, their cheesecakes are out of this world."
Bryan H.,"Franklin, TN",83,367,28,4.0,1/30/2015,You can never go wrong here.  I sure wish they took reservations or call ahead though.
