Lara S.,"Atlanta, GA",185,157,309,4.0,7/8/2015,"We're go about 2-3 times a month. Usually will sit near the bar. High top tables are first come first serve. Staff are usually solid, personable and typically no complaints.  When we do order to go frequently.... always ready in under 20 minutes. I am a major fan of their veggie burger. Of course the vanilla bean cheesecake is always a hit. The portion sizes are typically on point. We do always check our carry out because once every few visits they mess up on order or skimp on the portion size.  Enjoy their bartenders and staff. Super friendly and drinks are good. Happy hours are from 4 pm - 6 pm, and worth it. Lol"
Melodia H.,"Birmingham, AL",19,2,,1.0,5/27/2017,"Rude customer service. I'm so used to this restaurant being busy at Cumberland and Lenox, I assumed it would be the same at Perimeter. So I decided to call in an order of cheesecake. Job took the call and when I explained I wanted to order cheesecake he disconnected the call. So I called back and who do I get again? Job. So I explained he hung up and with a very nasty attitude explained I wanted to order cheesecake. He was so sarcastic. With attitude he informed me that my cheesecake will be ready when I walked in. WTH. Excuse me for trying to order ahead and forgive me for not knowing that this location isn't busy. I'd rather deal with high crowds and better attitudes than with someone who speaks as if my money isn't welcomed. So kudos to you Job for making me understand my business isn't welcomed at this location. I hope your manager sees this and gives you one on one training in customer service. After all I didn't tell you to choose a job you didn't want."
Vladimir M.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,18,9,3.0,4/3/2015,I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is always fresh and delicious. However at this particular location (in Perimeter) I faced unacceptable things that made me leave right after the server brought menus. Our silverware was dirty - small pieces of dried food stuck to knives and forks. Spoons were covered with water spots. The floor was so greasy that anyone could practice ice-skating right there. Please make the place SAFE and CLEAN. 3 stars until that for good service and tasty food.
Amina M.,"Atlanta, GA",3,35,4,4.0,1/5/2015,"If you're  really hungry and you chose Cheesecake  Factory, then you pick the right place!!!  I've  been here many times and the food is always good.  The menu is a little  overwhelming, but when you're  undecided or with a group that's  undecided about what to eat, then they offer a wide variety  of things to eat.  I chose the Teriyaki  chicken  and it was delicious,  can't  go wrong with that choice. I would've  given it 5 stars, but the floor is sooo slippery from grease, it kind of turned me off.  That's a 'slip and fall' waiting to happen!!  There needs to be a solution because one, it's  gross and two, it's dangerous.  Please, put down a runner or something fancy or constantly  clean the floors, because it's  not a good look for a great restaurant  such as this  one."
Michelle K.,"Atlanta, GA",636,620,3618,5.0,11/4/2014,"I came here with 12 lovely friends including the birthday girl for a lovely birthday brunch last weekend. I'm pretty sure it's been about 7 years or more since I last stepped into a Cheesecake Factory so this was quite the exiting visit and occasion.   I forgot how much I like the Cheesecake Factory and was so impressed with the service and food that I might just go back for future visits.  The menu hasn't changed much but they did have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for the calorie counters or if you're craving something low-cal.  I actually ordered off that menu during my last visit because I was craving a salad and was fully satisfied with their Mexican Chicken tortilla salad.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their brunch/lunch menu and our sever, Caroline was AMAZING. She handled all of our requests promptly and with a smile.  I really appreciated that even on a busy Sunday morning, she was super attentive and made sure that everyone's glass was half full at all times.  Even when it came time to paying our bills, she was accurate and efficient.  Their cheesecake menu still rocks and although I didn't get a slice during my last visit, my friend Jessica Y. and several others ordered their desired slices and the portion size looked perfect.  Looking forward to visiting them, possibly just for the cheesecake, next time!"
Toney S.,"Columbia, SC",81,3,3,4.0,7/1/2015,"Stopped in for a bite nice crowd fast abd friendly  service from my waiter, Matthew was very inpressed by his knowledge of the menu and honest suggestions. He convinced me to try the dulce leche cheese cake so i grabbed a slice to go. I would definitely come here again when in town"
Stephanie M.,"Atlanta, GA",33,3,,4.0,11/5/2016,sat out on the porch and enjoyed the night life. mixed mature crowd loved it
Jean H.,"Belleville, IL",13,2,,5.0,5/4/2016,Food was awesome - had to visit the following day.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes were great.
Edward T.,"Marietta, GA",179,7,3,3.0,10/30/2016,"Finally got to try this place after years of hearing about it. First off, when we got there at about 7pm on a Saturday, they told us to wait 1 hr 15 min. Ended up having to wait 1 hr 35 min. After we got seated, we waited for about 15 minutes before the waitress came to give us our drinks. I understand that the restaurant is busy and all, but having to wait that long for just drinks is indicative of either the restaurant being understaffed or having incompetent servers. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, OUR BREAD FINALLY CAME OMGG. Bread was great, especially the rye. about 5 minutes later, my food came. I ordered the popular chicken dish with asparagus and mashes potatoes. Really enjoyed it, especially the chicken. Gf ordered some pasta with bacon, pasta, and mushroom. 20 minutes later, we received the check. We literally waited for our food twice as long as it took them to give us our check. Customer service could be better."
Minh T.,"Stone Mountain, GA",6,12,,4.0,11/20/2015,Best cheesecake in town hand down. I love the asian chicken wrap here. My fries was over cook but the steak was cook to perfection.
Tamara K.,"Detroit, MI",113,208,470,3.0,2/19/2015,This restaurant delivers good food and this time was no exception.  Had the Louisiana chicken pasta which has Parmesan crusted chicken on farfalle pasta with a delicious spicy sauce. Don't skip the sourdough warm bread and butter basket either.  But I must note that my service was pretty mediocre.  The waiter didn't check back on us and just seemed like he didn't care at all.
Brian B.,"Johns Creek, GA",32,87,34,3.0,3/11/2015,"This Cheesecake is ok. Been here sometimes and it's great others not so much.  Usually can't go wrong with the burger though, and the bartenders are always cool so the wifey and I typically eat at the bar."
Chia C.,"Shaker Heights, OH",7,6,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Went to this location about a week ago. Our service was poor, I contacted this location about it and never heard from anyone. This tells me the service we received was acceptable to management. The food was good and if I had good service it may not have been my last time visiting."
Christopher M.,"Roswell, GA",394,11,,3.0,9/13/2016,"The food was good. Jelani our server was great. My only complaint was that I had to point out a roach to the individual at the front desk while me and my girlfriend waited for a table. It was a little off putting, but still a good experience overall."
Leah J.,"Fort Bragg, NC",45,86,34,1.0,2/5/2016,"Terrible service. It took twenty minutes just to try and place a to-go order. My wife and I were with a friend and when he stepped up to order a family of 5 cut in front of him and the waitress/cashier  acted like she didn't see us. Meanwhile, her coworkers were cackling next to us and doing absolutely no work while the line just got longer and longer. I won't be returning."
Allison C.,"Norcross, GA",0,6,,3.0,4/3/2016,Hands down this used to be my favorite eatery!!. I was a little dissapointed that i waited 25 mins to sit in a half booth next to a million people. Their conversation was over powering ours.. It was a bit annoying. I think they could have at least told us then we wouldnt have waited
Queenie D.,"Atlanta, GA",287,708,374,3.0,11/23/2011,"The atmosphere is pretty hip. Most of the people that come here are in their 20 somethings. Since Perimeter Mall caters a bit towards the upper end, it is not surprising to see that kind of crowd in this restaurant. The food is good but can be towards the pricey side if you want to step out of the burger and fries venue. Our waitress was kinda slow that day and when my friend and I told her that it was our other friend's b-day, when it was time for them to sing for him, the waitress acted like it was all her idea ... ** (just kinda felt weird for me when the waitress was like ""see there u didnt think I didnt know your birthday huh? See, this is why I got everybody singing for you cuz I knew it was your bday!""-- I mean we know u r working hard for that tip but damn girl! I almost wanted to ask her ""well since YOU know all this and YOU set all this up for his bday, YOU gonna pay too? lol.)  Other than that, it was all good. The decor is this creamy gold and dark brown that sits well with the whole ""cheesecake factory"" idea."
Sam R.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,3,,3.0,3/29/2015,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, which means you get the consistent Cheesecake Factory experience. It's often stupid busy but the staff are nice and handle it as best as possible. The desserts are amazing (Limoncello Cream Torte is spectacular and, I suspect, under appreciated because it's not cheesecake) and the portions are stupid large.  Stuffed tots, thai lettuce wraps, guacamole, and tuscan chicken are my favorites, your mileage may vary."
Alan H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,1.0,3/13/2016,"Horrible experience. Disinterested and incompetent waiter, very poor service, poor food quality and relatively perfunctory apology from a weak manager. Stay away!"
Amy And Nancy S.,"Roswell, GA",0,15,,1.0,4/26/2015,"Food was OK but everything else killed the joy. Sunday morning, and it felt like the entire place was hungover. ALL the silverware was dirty (manager eventually took care of it because the entire dish load hadn't been done right). Server was well-intentioned but didn't know the menu and didn't come back with an answer about the food ingredients. Not one person there had any sense of urgency. Food took much too long to come out.  One too many subpar experiences in the Cheesecake chain... I'm out."
