Ebony C.,"Alpharetta, GA",60,379,532,3.0,8/31/2013,"The waits at the Perimeter Mall Cheesecake factory can be a bit crazy, but they're sweet enough to prioritize people that are eating alone and that want to eat and leave. That's AWESOME of the management and host to do. The food portions are great, and the menu is overwhelming with everything from breakfast, to pan pizzas and ""asian"" inspired fusion food and ""Italian"" dishes.  Overall, they do do well at not serving super authentic food that manages to still taste really good. The portions are huge, and good for sharing family style. The bread that is served with the food is DELICIOUS, fresh and warm. I go for the dark bread only. Their mojitos are well made, some with Trinidadian 10 Cane Rum (MY FAVE), and are well mixed. Not strong drinks though they have strong drink club prices. The cheesecake or dessert will run you anothe $6 to $10 so it's NOT a cheap date-- and at over 1000 calories a slice, it's not waistline friendly, either. Eater beware and budgets beware.  Overall, busy franchisey place, solid servers at this location, and desserts to die for. I'd go!"
Nikki F.,"Atlanta, GA",3,16,13,4.0,8/3/2014,"4 stars only because there are limited places to sit while you wait for your table and there is always a wait.  Food is consistently good and I never run out of new things to try! Went on half price cheesecake day and I am still dreaming about the Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake, I always get that one lol!"
Wayne K.,"Evans, GA",1,83,,4.0,7/24/2016,"After a long day, we decided to stop at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was Anthony G.  The entrees were brought by other employees, steak Diane Salmon combo, Cobb Salad, Chicken fingers. Overall the food was good. We order 3 different cheesecakes and some too rich to eat, or OK... There may be some I would like but I don't plan on trying everyone.  I would like to see a smaller cheesecake menu.  With all that said our server, Anthony was great.  A few minute after we received our entrees he came back to ask how everything was, which in recent years has been nonexistent by other servers. He was prompt, very considerate, friendly but not overly.  At the very end after I signed the check, which he did not see, he again thanked me and shook my hand.  This time the CF was nearly a 5 star, the only negative was the tile floors throughout the restaurant were slightly grease."

Xu L.,"Atlanta, GA",0,15,12,1.0,1/17/2016,"There was a long line when we got here, but we only waited for less than ten minutes to get our seats. One thing I never understand at this Cheesecake Factory is that they call my buzzer and let me wait for another 10 minutes every time. Anyway, our waiter seated us. At first his service was pretty decent, he took our order very carefully, even kneed down to the floor because he couldn't hear us very well. We ordered bufflo chicken meatball and decided to share Louisiana chicken pasta since we decided to save up our appetite for some cheesecake! He offered us water as we wanted pretty fast and then VANISHED. And things went down from this point. Nobody brouht us any bread or butter, we just sat for our meals with an empty stomach for over 20 minutes since the restaurant was packed. Here comes the worst part, our meal came out before our appetizer! How ridiculous was this! My boyfriend and I were so starving that we even didn't care about this ""accident"". The waiter who  brought our entree ( not our waiter) heard about our meatball didn't come, he asked us whether wanted to wait for it first, we just too eager to eat and  let it go. When we almost half done with our meal, the appetizer came out,  as I imagined, it was cold. I don't know how long it was seated under the heat lamp but it was definitely not fresh. I was pretty irritated by what happened there, but to this moment, our waiter even didn't show up once to check on us or refill up our water. I just finished our meal really quickly and decided to leave ASAP. Right before we finished our pasta he showed up with the dessert menu, I just ignored him and asked for the bill. I left without having the piece of cheesecake I was craving for, that's how pissed I was. After all, the service was HORRIBLE."
Phong T.,"Stone Mountain, GA",462,435,1806,4.0,7/10/2013,"Although I hate crowded restaurants, especially at a franchise such as The Cheesecake Factory. I like this specific location. It tends be very busy during the weekends. I have been here for lunch several times during the weekday and it's not as noisy, which is relaxing when you can actually hear the music.  I have been here numerous amount of times over the year. I remember celebrating a birthday dinner here about 4-5 years ago and at the time, they accommodated my large party with reservations prior to the event. I don't think they do it anymore based on some recent reviews I've read.  FOOD/DESSERT: Pretty good food and portion for the price. I love their calamari and tex-mex egg rolls appetizer. For entrees, they have an extensive menu ranging from items such as pasta to burgers to salads. They also have a SKINNYLICIOUS menu for folks watching their calories. That's always a cool thing.  Cheesecake is pretty good as well as their cakes. I tend to get the fruity cheesecakes such as the Mango Key Lime (comes with macaroon crust, which is coconutty) or chocolate-based cheesecakes.  SERVICE: On point all the times I have visited."
Sanjay J.,"Campbell, CA",2,15,20,4.0,8/27/2014,Good customer service and delicious food.  Try crab meat with artichoke.  Huge portions.
Bridgette D.,"Marietta, GA",12,83,52,2.0,10/24/2015,"I only went to Cheesecake Factory because my teenage daughter has been begging to go there for months.  I've eaten at the chain many times in the past but not in the recent past.  I absolutely loath these types of chains because they lack any type of quality in their food.  They function on volume and it shows in the product.  The server was decent and the prices are low so that's why I give them a 2 star rating.  Their cheesecake lacks freshness and it's obvious they're just pulling the cakes out of the freezer.  If you're looking for a cheap bucket of food, that's what you'll get here because they give you a heaping portion.  I didn't eat my full meal because it wasn't tasty or worth taking home anyway.  Enter at your own risk."
Cameon T.,"Douglasville, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/30/2015,I hate this location! The food is never right! Today I had the blast chicken which I always have but here it was over cooked or old and they tried to recook it and serve it! The shrimp was over cooked and I can understand a bad day but it's always like this at this location!!!
Heidi P.,"Marietta, GA",806,491,1824,3.0,3/27/2014,"This is probably the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in maybe 8-9 years... okay maybe longer. All I had remembered the menu is HUGE and the cheesecake is tasty.  We were going to get Mexican, but it was 5pm and the height of rush hour.. we sat for 15-20 minutes and didn't even get barely a mile. We were both in the ""I'm too hungry to talk to you, be nice to you, or not scream in traffic"" kind of mood, so we pulled into the mall, thinking we'd just walk around and get something from the cafeteria.. and then we walked towards Cheesecake Factory, because of where we parked, and we decided to give it a go. We were sat pretty quickly. I noticed it was in the middle of happy hour and waited a few minutes for drinks and bread. One lady walked by and dropped off some bread, some rye? pumpernickel? with oats?  I don't know, but it's good.  I think it's the same as O-u-t-b-a-c-k bread actually. AN-Y-way, We ordered about 10 minutes in.. we finished our bread and almost our drinks..  and before I knew it, we had been sitting there for over 40 minutes and still no food, no bread refill. The table that showed up after us, was getting their food. I was sure they didn't order before us.. I was about to get angry, when our food was placed in front of us. He got a turkey avocado sandwich, which he inhaled, with sweet potato fries.. which we brought home. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which besides sounding like a fancy-as-$#@! name, is delicious. Crispy baked chicken on top of basil pasta with a bit of a buttery creamy sauce, with prosciutto and arugula and parmesan cheese on top of that.  The first bite was delicious.. and then then next and the next and the next.. and soon I realized how RICH and savory it really was, and decided to box up over half of the plate to bring home.  The waitress came back by and we asked for the check and a piece of the Adam's chocolately peanut buttery fudge ripple cheesecake to go.  We ate it later at home and it did not disappoint. Overall, if the food sucked, this place would be a 1 or 2 star experience, because tonight's service was not impressive.  However, we both really enjoyed our meals, so there's your saving grace. After all, the actual food can have an impact on how you feel about a restaurant.. sometimes. We have a bunch of food leftover, and I'm not sure if I'd go back necessarily, unless someone specifically requested it, or it was the only thing open, but 3 stars for this experience. A-OK."
Julianne K.,"Doraville, GA",56,11,39,4.0,8/10/2015,Like this place ! My favorite favorite dish -Bristro shrimp pasta!!!  just so~ good !
Dave M.,"Anderson, SC",0,32,,1.0,2/6/2016,"There were four of us at dinner here, and each one of us received our orders at different times.  I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my fries!  All of our food was cool to the touch and seemed like it sat a long time before being served to us.  The manager tried to correct the problem, but if a cook or server doesn't care about the food the first time around, they won't care the second time.  Manager was very concerned and good about it, the server not so much.  I won't go back!"
Annie L.,"Atlanta, GA",715,924,1252,5.0,6/25/2010,"I absolutely love this place. Particularly the location. I've been to the Northpoint Cheesecake Factory and the service is a hit or miss there...fortunately, I can say it's a steady flow of amazing-ness service at the Perimeter location =] Yes it's a chain restaurant. Yes it is commercialized. But you know what? What business isn't? I also understand the menu is freaking HUGE but I kinda like that...I can go for a sandwich, salad, pasta, pizza, burger, steak, soup, blah blah blah. They even have orange chicken. I mean, if you want a crowd pleaser I'd recommend going here. I love the cobb salad. With bits of bacon, diced up eggs, avocado slices, chunks of chicken (to be honest, I can do without that but I'll take what I can get), blue cheese crumbles....ahhh. Thinking about it is making my mouth water all over again. *drool*   The seared tuna salad is delicious too. Unlike the other salad entrees that come in ridiculously huge portions, the portion size for this particular salad is kinda small. But it's perfectly seared, with a peppery crust and a nice rare center. Mmmmmm. Another dish I adore? HIBACHI STEAK!!!! Ahhhhh! For all you sweet-savory-salty people out there...this is an ABSOLUTE must. The steak is extremely tender and the mashed potatoes gives you the pleasant surprise of the occasional chunk of unmashed potato in it. Some people don't like that but...I dig it. Mango smoothie with a dash of raspberry puree gets me everytime. If you can't afford their pricey cocktails (like me) bring your own flask and spike it...yes I've done that before. Bite me. Lastly...I should probably mention I'm a huge bread kind of girl. I like their bread here---comes with complimentary mini loaves of the oat-wheat-brown bread and the sour dough. I'm a fan. Ask for the blue cheese dressing (it has chunks of blue cheese in it) on the side and the tabasco sauce...hellloooo dipping sauce! Fo fwee! Win! I've tried their cheesecakes before and nothing really pops out to me. I'm not really a ""cheesecake"" type of gal though...pass. Tiramisu is pretty hands down AWESOME. Although they can lighten up on all that whip cream.... Parking is easy shmeazy. It's not valet but you DO have the option of doing that if you'd like to fork out that extra $4-$6."
Luke T.,"Tucker, GA",429,613,645,2.0,2/15/2013,This place is too busy and IMO not worth the wait. We came early.. say 6 pm and had to wait a darn hour. No way I am coming back to stand in line for mediocre and salty food
Odessa B.,"Decatur, GA",3,8,,5.0,11/23/2015,This is a great restaurant to celebrate special moments! Lots of great treats to choose from.
Amber G.,"Morrow, GA",26,25,13,3.0,5/19/2014,They just ran out of spinach dip. That's what I came here for. And they ran our of spinach dip. WTF! Not the ingredients to make the dip. But everything that goes in the dip.  We are here with a large party and they waiter seems to be overwhelmed. Forgetting drinks and orders. Not too great. I do not know if he is new....but that is no excuse. And the chick helping him is clearly coming across that she doesn't want to be here.  Although the waiter took our order it still took him 20 minutes and three times of tell us he will be putting the order in before he actually did!!! Oh well. I shall get my cheesecake and go home....
Angie W.,"Columbia, SC",286,159,115,5.0,4/5/2014,"We had to order a meal to go. It was sooo yummy. Artichoke, grilled asparagus thing and finally steak medallions. A+"
Gna T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,4.0,6/29/2016,Soooooo my Boo decided we would go here for dinner no grip lead the way OMG by far all to the good the food was great the waiter was very polite the wait time was 0 mins  I can't lie I have to give it up to the crew FRIDAY nite 6/24 will be going back very soon.
Alan J.,"Marietta, GA",1,9,6,4.0,5/5/2014,This place always is clean and the food and service are top notch. The only reason why I can't give this restaurant 5 stars is because it takes a long time for the food to come out- even when the place doesn't seem that busy.
Toya C.,"Pensacola, FL",3,319,1742,5.0,7/17/2014,Always satisfied when we dine here.  Love the sweet wheat bread with butter to snack on until dinner arrives.  It has been about a year since I've last dined here and the menu has changed a bit but sill offers yummy sounding dishes.  this time I got the bbq salmon topped with onion rings and served with mash potatoes and broccoli.  hubby got mac and cheese burger and sweet potato fries.  Everything was delicious.  Also got a slice of chocolate cake - huge slice with whipped cream
