Paul E.,"Acworth, GA",0,6,1,1.0,3/28/2015,Currently dinning at the factory. Terrible service. 45 minute wait for food as the computer lost our order. Then it had to be put in again. Then things are coming out one at a time. This is the worst service I have ever had. Then nothing from the manager.
Jessica D.,"Columbia, SC",14,123,1,5.0,7/30/2013,"I met a friend here for happy hour (4-6pm, $5 apps and drinks) and cheesecake on Monday evening.  Service: Our server was professional and super nice. He was great for recommendations and kept everything refilled.   Wait: We opted to sit in the bar for happy hour, so there was no wait at all on a Monday evening at 5:45.  Food: We ordered spinach artichoke dip (ok), avocado egg rolls (must get these! so good!), the new s'mores cheesecake (yum), and the Godiva cheesecake (omg! the server suggested this one and it was delicious).   I try to avoid chain restaurants, but the call of cheesecake was too good to pass up, and the happy hour here is pretty stellar.  We'll be back."
Karly G.,"Suwanee, GA",235,507,28,4.0,5/23/2013,"This place is always pack, no matter what time of day you think is their down time... there truly aren't any. I'm almost positive that everyone has consumed here... I won't go into details of food. I come here for fabulous cheesecake, generous portion of food that I either share/take home for lunch the next day and mango freeze.  It's one of the few chain restaurants that I keep coming back to because of their consistency in service and in their food."
Alexis W.,"McDonough, GA",0,2,,1.0,3/18/2016,"The food and staff quality has significantly gone down in the past few years. It took the manager who was at the front a while to even acknowledge my presence . Upon seating me the hostess said she was so tired of these folks and ready to go. The waster glass didn't even look clean My food was not hot and not seasoned well. The cheesecake was not the same , their was no strawberry glaze and the strawberries were not fresh.  I used to love spending my birthdays here ."
Miguel D.,"Dunwoody, GA",16,3,,1.0,10/4/2014,"They removed the Ahi Wasabi Tuna entree, the main reason why I use to came to this place! They won't find me here again! It sucks when you go to a specific place, not for the environment, not for the service or not for the good deals, but for a simple entree that I love and now is out of the menu! Shucks..."
Sandy L.,"Norcross, GA",0,5,,1.0,7/31/2015,"First and last visit to this location.   Service was horrible, food was great however did not make up for the less than stellar experience.  Fries came with my meal, burger was deliver w/o fries was told they were on their way.  Ate half the Burger planned on taking other half home.  Finished burger still no fries, asked twice still no fries.   Asked for to go boxes. My son only ate half his meal including soup.  Asked if he could get the soup to go also. ""Sure no problem"". Please adjust my bill to reflect the food I did not get ""sure no problem "". Bill comes not adjusted.  Please adjust my bill.   Manager comes out says he cannot adjust my bill as fries come with the meal. okay great but they did not come with my meal.  Offered to give me a side to go.  Not acceptable to me.  He finally took a ice tea off my bill.   All this also took an additional 45 mins.   Got home no soup in my bag that they boxed up.   Poor service.  Poor management and very very poor customer service."
J L.,"Rex, GA",0,16,,2.0,7/3/2014,Okay so yes the food is amazing here BUT the service is the worst I have ever seen. I have tried it 6 times each at different times and different days and I haven't had a good experience once! It is really dissappointing because the food is so amazing and it is one of my favorite restaurants but I can't get over the fact that I have to wait 2 hours (after I have been seated) for dinner. They either need more employees or need to consider letting some of their staff go.
Michael B.,"Hanahan, SC",493,832,1219,4.0,2/24/2011,"Just got back from having my resignation luncheon at the Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall. My coworkers and myself had great lunch!  I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta lunch portion which was huge! If that was the lunch portion, I'd hate to see how big the dinner portion is. The dish itself was very good, but could have used a little more chipotle seasoning in it. It wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be, but still very good.  Our service was wonderful and handled our order (big group) with ease. The waitress was very friendly and kept our drinks refilled.  Great lunch with great coworkers!"
J T.,"Atlanta, GA",20,81,170,3.0,9/15/2013,Always a lot of menu choices here and massive portions. The waiter was pretty blunt about what menu items were unique and worth it. I selected the Louisiana Chicken Pasta from his recommendation. The Chicken pasta was very tasty although very excessive in portion. I will definitely return to try different dishes.
Apearl C.,"Atlanta, GA",254,611,185,3.0,5/6/2011,I've been here several times.   Nothing special or bad about this location.  Food is alright and staff is cool.
George B.,"Arlington, VA",0,67,66,5.0,10/4/2013,"Our group had salads, flatbread, pasta and everything was great.  The best part was our waitress, Eden.  She was fantastic - great attention to our table and wonderfully friendly service - if you come to this location, ask for Eden.  We got the cheesecake to go, yum!"
Michelle B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,35,8,5.0,6/12/2014,"I love this place!  They have delicious food, so many options on the menu, and them of course there's the cheesecake!!  I love that they start you off with two types of bread that are both delicious.  The service is always good because they keep a large wait staff.  The school I work for has had our Christmas party here two years in a row and they always did a great job accommodating us.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Jin J.,"Atlanta, GA",36,19,1,2.0,11/11/2015,"All I can say is ""not  good"" and I will never come back here if I don't have to. It took 20 min for my Ketel One martini STRAIGHT UP.. and when I got my drink, I received a Dirty Martini... I reordered and that took another 10 min..  (IT WAS NOT BUSY AT ALL and my guest was waiting to cheers me this whole time...) In regards to our food, our pasta came out looking like it had been sitting at the kitchen window for a bit, and our salad had basically no dressing on it. I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory but you've confirmed why I'd rather eat at other restaurants that have way better food and service for the same price point."
Pat B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,7,4.0,10/23/2015,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a few years so I was happy to see that the quality of the food hasn't changed. The menu is still long as all get out but I saw a lot of new things that I was excited to try. The macaroni and cheese bites are AMAZING. For dinner I ordered a chicken and shrimp Thai style dish- I can't remember the name but it was very tasty as well. I could barley but a dent it in after the appetizer though. I'm trying to cut back on the sweets so I didn't get any cheesecake this time, but we'll see for next time."
Tacara S.,"New Orleans, LA",8,31,4,3.0,9/19/2014,"I may be bias since I'm from New Orleans, but I found the food rather bland. The restaurant was beautiful, and the service was good, but I honestly didn't care for the food.  Perhaps I'll try it again next time I visit since we don't have this restaurant in New Orleans."
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227,3.0,1/30/2013,"Came here again last night for a birthday dinner. Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it was a bit difficult to be seated since half the party showed up almost an hour late (better late than never, though!). We were among the first to arrive and went ahead and gave them a head count of 15-20. It actually wasn't too long until the tables were ready, but in order to be seated, we had to have at least 8 people present. At the time, we didn't, so we made the executive decision to give up our table and wait until they could get enough seating again later. It was a shame, because they actually held our table for about 40 minutes. If only people would just show up on time. The staff was extremely understanding, accommodating and kept us informed throughout the duration of our wait. 5-star service right there, folks. Fast forward an hour later, and a few moments after the final guests arrived, our new seating arrangement was ready for us. Here's the rundown: Service: Our two waiters were friendly and came by often enough for refills on everything but water, for some reason. Overall, not bad. Drinks: Frozen drinks were good; I'd recommend the Georgia Peach. Mixed drinks ($10) were okay but they were mostly ice and not enough of the drink itself. Just request for a little bit of ice and you'll be good to go. One buddy of mine ordered his usual Crown on the rocks ($12) and received some sort of mixed Crown concoction. The color was VERY off and it tasted extremely light. Skip on getting anything on the rocks, because they seem to cheat you of your spirits. Food: For the bigger foodies, we thought the dishes were very.. mediocre / subpar. For those who don't get out nearly as often, they thought it was great! Food portions were giant (that's their signature thing) except for the ""combination"" plates. So, keep that in mind when you order.. whether you have a big appetite or not. I got their crowd pleasing Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (according to the menu) but I found it to be very bland and the shrimp was overcooked and tough. If you come here, I'd suggest sticking to ordering small plates / appetizers and desserts only. I can't remember a time when I thought any entree was bomb[dot]com. For small plates / appetizers, I recommend: 1. Vietnamese Tacos. It's not authentic, and it's pretty much a glorified, Americanized version of a banh mi. It was interesting, but pretty darn delicious nonetheless. 2. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. You can never go wrong with any sort of cheese dip to start off your dinner! 3. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. D and I got these on a whim when we were here before and it's probably my most favorite thing off their entire menu! However, much to my disappointment, it wasn't there or I overlooked it, in search of it ten times over. For desserts, I recommend: 1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. There are layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake, combined to create this piece of heaven. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Simply put: it was perfect! 2. OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. This one is new, and an amped up version of their OREO cheesecake they offered before. 3. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel. I thought getting something with fruit in it would make me feel less guilty about ordering a dessert. Nope! This one is actually the sweetest tasting of the three I suggested. Surprising, huh? There is no free dessert for birthdays (darn!) but they do write a pretty message on your plate and come by to sing happy birthday. There were a LOT of birthdays celebrated yesterday. We heard the staff sing 3-4 times before it was finally our turn. Parking is ample, as Cheesecake Factory is attached to the mall."
Canyouwoowoo W.,"Atlanta, GA",88,193,21,3.0,4/4/2012,"A ""safe,"" consistent, unimaginative sort of place, like the kind that you take a client to for lunch. Good service, above average food, and the digs are nice enough, but you wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to ever come here again. If you want consistency and predictable amount of quality, then this will probably do. If you like adventure and some sizzle, then best to avoid."
Sophie L.,"Atlanta, GA",0,63,2,1.0,5/5/2015,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory every Tuesday on a dinner date with mom. This place has gone DOWNHILL. Last week, my order was wrong and they brought the wrong food. Today, I had hair in my nachos MELTED IN THE CHEEESE. The server got a manager, who did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. He only said sorry and then took if off the bill. He should have covered my entire tab to make up for this. Horrible customer service and extremely disappointed in this place. STAY AWAY!"
Diari C.,"Atlanta, GA",89,163,146,3.0,12/26/2012,"I'm a big fan of their cheesecake, but not so much of anything else.  I find the exhaustive menu of small plates, entrees, and drinks as well as the large portion sizes a little overwhelming, but that's just me... What's funny is the 10+ page menu, large portion sizes, and their cheesecake is the exact combination that has made this business such a success.   Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's not ""fantastic""...  It's just okay.  You can't go wrong with their pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, and a few of their specialty entrees.  The entree that I enjoy the most is the Grilled Pork Chops which comes with mashed potatoes, spinach, and ""house made"" applesauce.   It's also a good place for Sunday brunch, lunch, for kids, groups, and anything ""night"" e.g. date night, girls' night, etc.  LOL So while not my favorite, they are on my list of places to go when I know I can rely on the food, the service, and the overall dining experience to be fairly decent."
Tammi D.,"Suwanee, GA",122,519,888,3.0,11/12/2012,"This is a place to go when you are really really hungry!  The portions are huge, which I find surprising, because you would think the cheesecake is their selling point.  The brown bread is good...I'm a huge carb lover.  Nothing special about the food.  The cheesecake is very creamy and rich, but it's hit or miss for me on the flavors.  I was recently disappointed in the red velvet one."
