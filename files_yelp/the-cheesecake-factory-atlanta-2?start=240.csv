Alyssa M.,"New York, NY",232,246,78,4.0,12/9/2012,"I'm a big Cheesecake Factory fan. Out of all the locations I've been to, I was shocked and floored we got a table immediately, at noon, on Black Friday, attached to a mall. Like, let's get real here. That never happens. We had a great waitress, clean and spacious booth, food came quickly, and it tasted great. There were a few things that could have gone better (water had no ice, table had no silverwear) but overall we had a really good experience here."
Berni B.,"Atlanta, GA",20,20,4,2.0,1/5/2014,I've been to this one 3 times now and while it's standard corp restaurant food the place is really not as good as it could be! I sit at the bar the male bartender (who is always the same one) is ok dry personality and has no sense of urgency greats u and offers nothing always chewing gum!!! Oh how I hate this in a restaurant! Takes drink order....takes good order does not ask how things are just asks if u want more...and for some reason today I took a server coming by to get a refill on my coffee...my eggs where ovr cooked but since he never asked me if it was good I couldn't tell him and I sat w dirty plates n drink cups infornt of me longer than I think I should! Now that I've been here 3 times w the same experience every time I will only come back for Togo slices of the cakes! In this area u can do btr for food drinks and bartenders I promise!
Carrie S.,"Atlanta, GA",8,133,273,4.0,7/13/2012,"HUGE menu and has new healthy items that are delicious!  I am so glad they added healthy items to their menu!  We usually get it to go, but it does have great food! Drake is right, Cheesecake is good!"
Tristan A.,"NY, NY",78,167,1,4.0,8/11/2012,"That damn delicious bread they serve!!! Good thing we just ordered a few appetizers...cuz I would never be able to eat the entree.  I could eat all the bread in the kitchen. I love it. The chicken sliders were pretty good. Taste like white meat..very crispy, great bun. I come here for the cheesecake tho...since I'm not in Brooklyn anymore, living across the street from Juniors (how I miss you so). I dont think you can go wrong with any cake they serve.  This location was a little on the loud side, and a tad bit too dark at night. I do get the vibe they are going for..but I need a little more light to see my food lol. No major complaints here."
Jovan B.,"Atlanta, GA",43,28,11,1.0,2/28/2014,I've been here a few times with hopes they'll do better next time everytime I go to this resturant they are packed to capacity I ordered fried chees which was not fresh chicken carbonara which was dry I asked for extra sauce brought me a tablespoon of it I complained and the manger said I'll bring you more sauce to enjoy it at home Wtf are you serious I want nice fresh food not leftovers
Haley R.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",0,12,,3.0,9/3/2014,"I'd eat here again.  Not often.  But, again.  And I'd probably only order booze and cheesecake.  The portion sizes are huge, so prepare for leftovers!  The fried macaroni and cheese balls were as much of a carb-bomb (and as delicious) as they sound, the chicken piccata was good (could use a little extra spice / salt), and the dessert was (of course) amazing.  I was really surprised by the beverage I'd ordered.  Was expecting a too-strong mixed drink, considering it was mostly alcohol, but was very happy to find it tasty and refreshing.  The bartender did a good job with the Ruby Red Sunrise.   Appetizer - Fried Macaroni and Cheese  Selection: 5/5  As Described in Menu: 5/5  Cold Food Cold / Hot Food Hot: 5/5  Taste: 5/5 Entree - Chicken Piccata  Selection: 5/5  As Described in Menu: 5/5  Cold Food Cold / Hot Food Hot: 5/5  Taste: 4/5 Dessert - Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake  Selection: 5/5  As Described in Menu: 5/5  Cold Food Cold / Hot Food Hot: 5/5  Taste: 5/5 Beverage(s) - Ruby Red Sunrise (Mixed Drink)  Selection: 5/5  As Described in Menu:  5/5  Cold Beverage Cold / Hot Beverage Hot: 5/5  Taste:  5/5 Service   Greeting: 5/5  Beverage Delivery: 5/5  Food Delivery: 5/5  Dessert Delivery: 5/5  Checkback: 5/5 Cleanliness  Lobby and Dining Area: 5/5  Bathroom:  n/a  Server Uniforms: 5/5"
East Cobb S.,"Roswell, GA",125,54,26,3.0,6/12/2014,Went out with colleagues. Ordered Southern fried catfish. It was watery and wasn't very appealing. Waiter service was good as was the cheesecake dessert. Facilities were clean and ambiance was very good. Would go again but wouldn't order the same selection.
Neal R.,"Everett, WA",2,35,1,5.0,4/27/2014,"This is my go-to place in Atlanta. The chicken and biscuits are incredibly rich and delicious, and you can't go here without trying one of their cheesecakes. They have such a variety of choices that you can try something new every time."
Shyam S.,"Isla Vista, CA",339,720,68,3.0,3/8/2012,"I suppose all Cheesecake Factories are the same. However, hats off to the managers and servers at the Dunwoody location for being really open to helping my wife and I find food that met our dietary requirements (halal). These days so many Americans have dietary restrictions, but not all restaurants are as accommodating as these folks. Let them know if you have issues with alcohol/gelatin/cross-contamination and I promise, they will help!"
Valrie M.,"Marietta, GA",0,20,,4.0,12/18/2014,"Went here for lunch with a friend. The place was packed, but we got a booth. Our waitress was very good, and a nice guy named Brandon or Brendon helped us a lot with retrieving silverware, and suggesting the blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. We shared the Americana hamburger-delicious- and the Cuban sandwich-also yummy. Great place - will return soon!"
Chanel A.,"Daly City, CA",6,42,14,3.0,11/19/2011,It wasn't any different from the Cheesecake factories in Cali-pretty much standard-nothing bad-nothing spectacular either-lol I always want to ask about the decor tho-like the ceiling has cherubs painted on it-YET the columns are egyptian-does anyone else notice these things lol???
Rad D.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,50,,1.0,11/14/2015,"This location is AWFUL! We've had better service and food at chili's. We had several different checks at the table. Which at 1st the servers were asking who's on what checks but when they took the food order they didn't bother to adhere to the separation.  We mentioned this and they said ""oh we got it well just separate it at the end."" Well it took an hour to do the checks..... On to the next problem. The food was nasty and awful. The chicken fingers were not good and the chicken sandwich was equally bad. By the way all of us were STARVING , so we wanted to eat . Then the eggroll  appetizers were nasty along w some type of burrito beans and rice plate. Lastly the luau salad was beyond nasty, oily and processed. In All we had  5 different dishes that were nasty and couldn't eat. We were told the manager was going to come to the table and talk but never did. Do yourself a favor and keep ur money."
Kyra M.,"Atlanta, GA",516,289,80,3.0,5/4/2011,"I am not gonna waste anyone's time typing bout the czcake factory that everyone has already tried.   I do beg everyone to try the buffalo blasts appetizer (basically chix,cz&buffalo sauce deeped fried).  I am not trying to brag but I have put so many ppl on this.  You must order w/ their homeade ranch.   Pls pick whatever entree you like but order the pineapple mojito, I repeat order the PINEAPPLE MOJITO!  You can thank me later:)"
Danielle H.,"Atlanta, GA",55,3,,3.0,4/27/2015,I went with my spouse and his Aunt. I had a great time. The steak was amazing. The receptionist(s) should dress less promiscuous though. Our waiter had a great sense of humor.
Katie W.,"Atlanta, GA",210,493,45,4.0,10/13/2011,"I hadn't been here for years and just recently returned because people made me go. All the way to Buckhead. It was fine. Of course, there were a bazillion people waiting for a table but we got ours within the promised 20 minutes. Their menu, as ever, is extensive but I'd already eaten so I opted for just the white bean hummus. It was not bad at all. I also got this frozen bellini cocktail which was pretty good. It reminded me of the brandy slushes my mom used to make. My favorite item here is the Navajo, which is a bunch of chicken and stuff on fry bread (hence the Native American-themed name of the dish) but I didn't partake because I wasn't that hungry. We skipped the cheesecake but I recall never really caring much for their cheesecake, anyway. The service was fantastic. These servers are well-trained and this place runs like a well-oiled machine. It will probably be some time before I return but it was not horrible."
Stefan O.,"Atlanta, GA",41,34,,3.0,4/21/2014,"Not bad, considering it's a chain restaurant. This location has good service, sports an ample menu selection, and is coincidently located near many area offices."
Carl G.,"Hollywood, FL",114,65,10,2.0,6/16/2014,"I'm giving the low stars NOT because of food quality.  Everyone enjoyed their meals. It is solely because the service at this cheesecake is way below par. I've eaten here several times before because it is convenient place to meet family when we visit Atlanta. It has never offered great service but this last trip took them off my list for good. We waited an hour for a table when we were told it would be 20 minutes.  Ok that happens but when you have 2 children that's a big deal. We told them we didn't want to wait more than 30 minutes as we could have (really should have) walked next door and gone to Maggianos. Anyway we didn't. It took almost an hour from sit down to being served dinner.  Unacceptable. We eat at cheesecake in Pembroke Pines florida and it just as busy as this one and always receive great service and food served in a timely manner.  Like I mentioned. Food tasted very good - I had a salmon dish. My wife had fish tacos and she didn't like hers. Family ordered a pasta dish - food, another fish dish - good. Kids had noodles with butte, how do you mess that up and the other chicken fingers. Dessert was chocolate cheesecake and everyone but me enjoyed as I don't eat dessert anymore. Only come here if you want their delicious cheesecake AND you have plenty of patience. You'll need it."
Greg R.,"Lithonia, GA",1,67,13,3.0,1/1/2014,"Went again New Year's Eve.  The meal and service was good. I had the fried fish sandwich. It was tasty and cole slaw that came with it was good. We tried a new appetizer, the nachos.  Do not get the nachos.  They were horrible.  I can't describe how bad. The meal and pineapple upside down cheesecake saved it. Food was better than my visit in February 2013 so I may go again later this year."
Natosha F.,"Lithia Springs, GA",3,5,1,5.0,3/14/2014,I went here today for lunch and our server Star was awesome! Very attentive! Food was very good as well.  I had the Medallion steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Very tasting!
John M.,"Plympton, MA",14,100,2,4.0,11/29/2011,"Hey it's the Cheesecake Factory, if you've been to one, you've been to them all. As far as chains go, it's pretty good. I frequent this one in Atlanta when I travel here on business and I like it. The bartender where I dine does a great job, he's very attentive and friendly. As far as the food, they do it the same as the others I have been to. I'm a creature of habit and I have had an ongoing love affair with the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo for many years now. When I dined here recently I had it yet again and as usual it didn't fail to please my taste buds. It's a perfect combination of spicy, salty and Cajun. For an app this time I tried the fried calamari. It was nicely done, very light and crispy, but the real star of this dish was the side dipping sauce which is a garlic based mayo. I could put this stuff on anything and love it. For dessert, I had a piece of the Reese's Peanut butter Cup Cheesecake. Awesome, nothing more to say about it. After that I rolled myself out of the place... I ate way too much, but left with no regrets whatsoever. Thanks Cheesecake Factory, you never disappoint!"
