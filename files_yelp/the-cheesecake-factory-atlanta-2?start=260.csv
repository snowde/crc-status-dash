Adree O.,"Atlanta, GA",521,188,28,3.0,10/8/2013,The Cheesecake factory was a nice chain but the food is just ok. The Cheesecake is awesome. I tried the red velvet cheese cake :) and the oreo cheesecake. Both were delish!
Jomo F.,"Lithonia, GA",14,7,,2.0,12/28/2010,"Drinks were good, but the pasta off the lunch menu sucked my lady got and it tasted old and way to heavy on the chilli powder, we love spicy but not let me toss chili powder on it spicy,  Won't be back for lunch, maybe dinner after I forget abot the lunch"
Kenneth N.,"Sandy Springs, GA",56,119,3,5.0,2/25/2012,"The menu is HUGE. Something for everyone. Most restaurants overreach and quality suffers when trying to provide so many choices, but not this Cheesecake Factory. I've had a number of different dishes and all were excellent. The staff has always been attentive and responsive.  And kudos to the management. With so many customers, they run a smooth ship and the one time I had a small gripe, the manager was quick to resolve my problem.  Thanks"
Megan S.,"Atlanta, GA",502,7,1,1.0,5/22/2013,"Terrible. Bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper in stalls, pee on the floor and seats, nothing flushed, gross. Service staff were rude, and that's if they spoke to you at all.  I guess they were mad because it was near the end of their shift. But we always tip really well anywhere that we go. Would have been nice if they seemed to care at all. Soup came out cold. Food was mediocre at best. Just overall a bad experience."
Reginald T.,"Atlanta, GA",104,14,18,1.0,11/24/2013,"I'm a man of few words. So this will be short and to the point. After my waitress took my order, she brought my meal and didn't return for about 30 mins. I was left with cold chicken, pasta that had been  sitting in water for over an hour, and over cooked shrimp. My friends finished  their meals as I watched. Not a good experience."
Tasha A.,"Decatur, GA",51,186,32,5.0,5/1/2011,"I could never say anything bad about the cheesecake factory!  This place has my totally! :) So here we go! Drinks: Yes you should totally drink when you go to the Cheesecake Factory.  Have my favorite strawberry martini - it's so YUMMEH! Appetizers: Thai lettuce wraps, calamari, crispy crab bites - those are all pretty good & of decent portions. Entree: The last time I had the filet cooked medium it was only alright, a bit too dry for my liking, but it was good.  I also love the teriyaki chicken with boneless chicken breasts.   Cheesecake: Isn't this what you're going to the Cheesecake Factory for?! Of course it is! I love the pineapple upside down cheesecake as well as the red velvet cheesecake (although that may have been a special).   Service: Yeah, it's always pretty good.  My last visit, our waitress was a little preoccupied with a group of cute guys across from us, but so were.  I can't blame her for that right?!  All around excellent place.  I realize it's a chain, but who cares, it's a really good chain!"
Chris W.,"Louisville, KY",116,426,1703,4.0,6/12/2011,Great atmosphere. Nice place to go for desert or coffee. Something different than a Starbucks for a casual meet up over a cup of coffee or desert.
Colleen L.,"Atlanta, GA",1,15,,2.0,1/13/2014,"I hate this place. It's probably b/c I have been way too many times. My parents love it so I am forced to go. LOL! I am not a huge chain restaurant fan. It depends on the chain though, some are good.  Their menu is all over the place. I feel like I reading a short story every time I page through it. Even with all the times I have been, I still don't know what to order.  I gave it 2 stars b/c their cheescake is good. That's it though."
Alexis D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,5.0,12/28/2013,Omg this place is amazing ! I ordered the chicken samoas and they were phenomenal . Not too spicy just perfect! Waiter was quirky and cute and cheesecake amazing!!!!
Gary B.,"Atlanta, GA",7,75,8,4.0,7/17/2011,"Food:  Food has always been great here, I 'usually' get the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, which is awesome. I try a different cheesecake, usually, and I have always enjoyed every cheese cake I've tried. No complaints about taste or quality of food here. Atmosphere: Very nice overall atmosphere, however my small complaint is that the tables usually have bread crumbs on them when I get seated, something I really don't like to see and I usually have someone wipe the table down, BUT that is my only complaint about this place and definitely will not keep me from going here! Service:  Always spot on, service has always been fast and the staff have always been nice, absolutely not even one complaint here. Summary: If I could give this place a 4.5 I would, I only dinged them because the tables are almost never breadcrumb free when I am seated, other than that minor flaw I will continue to eat at this wonderful and delicious place. The food is always excellent and the staff are wonderful."
Shajeeah M.,"Scottdale, GA",0,6,,4.0,2/2/2014,"I had lunch here with my mother in law and son , it was a nice atmostphere the waittress was pleasant . The appetizers was sooo yummy we had the tortllas and spinach dip. Over all it was a awsome service"
Cindy M.,"Clearwater, FL",0,31,,4.0,9/18/2013,"The salads here are delicious, and the Sunday brunch menu items are terrific, as well.  During busy times, this place can be noisy, though.  This is a go-to favorite of mine.  The menu is ridiculously large and varied...give it a try!"
Siddhesh D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/10/2015,"The restaurant was empty, but it still took them 30mins to seat us. Once we got the table, the server never showed up to till 40 more minutes after we seated. Hope the service improves."
Dallas B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,18,,4.0,12/29/2013,Food is okay but you go there for the cheesecake. Love the red velvet cheesecake or the peanut butter cheesecake. I great place to have a late night desert. Service is always good.
Emily T.,"Saint Louis, MO",36,233,7,4.0,3/25/2013,"Summary: TOO MUCH FOOD. Now, for the details... We had an early dinner on a Wednesday evening in March. We sat in the bar area, so we took advantage of a happy hour special (half off appetizers). S.O. had the Crusted Chicken Romano, which should feed at least two people. I had the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and a Greek Salad appetizers. The Greek salad appetizer has no lettuce, so it's VERY DENSE. It was a lot of veggies, but I wouldn't try it again. The sliders were well-prepared, but a bit bland. The tenders would be better sans buns. There were also too many sliders for one person, but I should have expected that! Shoutout to Janeen for SUPER-AWESOME, speedy service. We'll be back, as long as the wait is less than 10 minutes. :D"
Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,4.0,3/28/2011,"I had been wanting some cheesecake after eating some from their Alpharetta location a few weeks ago and we decided to just go ahead and make a whole meal of it. We decided to go to this location since it was near the Perimeter Mall and I knew we would need to walk some of this off after eating here. As you may expect, this place was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon although we were seated very quickly, we waited less than five minutes. The biggest thing that stands out to me about this place was the portion sizes...WOW!!. You definitely get your money's worth here. I got chicken and biscuits for my entrée and I think it was $13 or $15 dollars and I definitely got a commensurate amount of food. My plate consisted of a few chicken breasts and 3 or 4 biscuits sliced in half with some country gravy, peas, carrots, and mushrooms smothering all of it. My wife got the pasta carbonara and I managed to get a bite of it and that was pretty good also although I can't tell you much about it since I was to engrossed with my food. I was looking at what some other people were eating next to us (salads) and those were huge as well. I was surprised that I was able to get all of mine down....all I had to do was starve myself all day before I went in here,LOL. We bought some cheesecake for dessert although we got it to go since we could barely move under our own power after eating this stuff. I got the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake and the wife got the Tiramisu cheesecake. The portion size on both of these were very generous also although I didn't eat mine until the next day. I managed to sneak a little of the wife's Tiramisu cheesecake that was really good also. I could see us coming back to this place over and over again just to work our way through all of the different cheesecakes that they have. The guy that served us was pretty cool and was always checking with us to make sure everything was ok. We had some questions about the restaurant and he seemed very knowledgeable about everything that was going on. Very good experience overall and we'll be going back to this particular location."
The S.,"Stone Mountain, GA",1,119,33,3.0,7/6/2013,"Moroccan Chicken was overwhelmed by too much strong sauce and too little couscous. Similarly for the chicken Madeira. Service was slow, the waiter spending too much time chatting with customers.  Bread was okay, the multi-grain one better. Lemonade was way too strong , even with additional water. Not planning on returning to this establishment."
Candy L.,"Warner Robins, GA",4,23,24,3.0,4/12/2011,"Food is....ok! I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this time the service was poor and the food was mediocre. The next time, I will definitely avoid sitting in the section with a large party."
Jan R.,"Marietta, GA",4,7,,2.0,6/27/2012,"I recently ate at the Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter and I have to say that my friend and I had a bad experience with one of the servers and we were really disappointed. The food was ok but we were not happy with the way we were treated. I emailed the corporate headquarters and they in turn sent my email to the restaurant manager. He and I spoke about the incident and he was very apologetic, and offered to mail us a gift certificate so that we could come back for a better experience and told me he was going to follow up on the matter. I never received a return call or the gift certificate,so I assume he must have forgot our conversation. I highly doubt I will be eating there again with the multitude of better restaurant choices all over Atlanta."
Paul L.,"Atlanta, GA",7,35,1,4.0,2/26/2013,The food is good but a little on the pricey side. The cheesecake is excellent. It's great if you don't have to wait forever to be seated.
