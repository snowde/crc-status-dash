Thomas B.,"Alpharetta, GA",22,98,2,3.0,12/21/2010,"Came here for my Birthday Dinner and had a good time.  It's loud and always packed but the food is good and their selection is vast.  Think of anything and they probably have it or will make it for you and yes their Cheesecakes are to die for.  So good and not a tiny slice, oh no, it's as big as your face! This is a go to place after a long day of mall shopping but be prepared to to wait 15-30 minutes, call ahead.  Very casual and not expensive but it will run more than your local Applebees."
Nancy R.,"Atlanta, GA",77,382,2,5.0,6/3/2010,"There's always parking spots or valet, and service is always great! We came here for their happy hour specials and took advantage of their $5 Cosmopolitans. Happy Hour: Mon-Fri 4:00-6:00 in bar area.  FOOD: We also got their happy hour food specials - avocado egg rolls, factory nachos, and fried zucchini. Each one was so good and plentiful for two people.  The humus is good with their pita breads."
Sandi H.,"Atlanta, GA",10,18,,5.0,7/8/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is very consistent, most of the portions are enough to feed 4-3 people, so you definitely want to share or plan on left overs. We only tried to order separate meals once we were so full we hurt. They are very accommodating with changes & special dietary needs. My husband and I love the Small plate Factory chopped salad (not small at all) I don't like chicken & he doesn't like blue cheese so we order those on the side & get 2 different homemade salad dressings . They always get it right :) The blue chess dressing is so awesome I could eat with a spoon & often buy a jar to take home.  Due to noise level & long wait on weekends we will often order our meal to go. 1 time the forgot my beloved blue cheese dressing (really the only reason I eat salad)  it was late so I use an inferior brand I had got from the grocery store. However, I did call to let them know what happened & they sent me a gift card so my next meal is on them, now that's customer service!  We have tried many items on the menu and  they  never disappoint."
Christian M.,"Hendersonville, NC",0,1,,2.0,6/16/2013,"As a cheesecake fan, I have gotten many from them before. And at $8 a slice, I expect it to be good. Unfortunately, I had the same outlook for our dinner. We were visiting Atlanta as we do several times a year as we lives just a few hours away and we arrived at the Cheesecake factory. Parking is hard to find and it. was. packed. (as any other Cheesecake factory location) We sat down on the outside patio. Our waitress was nice and polite, but didnt have the best waitress skills. We went without water and drinks, bread, etc. But that wasn't a big deal The food and serving sizes were terrible. My salad was disgusting as it was not a salad with ranch, more like a spicy caesar, and my burger was on disgusting french bread...  My advice, go somewhere simple and less expensive with less wait times.  The only reason why this got 2 stars instead of 1, was the cheesecake"
Adam R.,"Atlanta, GA",52,189,17,2.0,9/26/2009,"It has been awhile since I have been to the Cheesecake Factory, and with good reason. I have been writing mostly positive reviews lately and I took some time to think of some places that I could write negatively about. Cheesecake Factory fits well into this category. The only times I really came here were with my family, mostly when I was in high school. My sister loves this place, mainly for the desserts. She always wanted to go here for her birthday, and I, being the good brother, indulged her. The wait is always bad. I always had a hard time understanding why people come here, and wait over an hour on weekends to come here. As I got older, I would meet my parents and sister here usually at least thirty minutes to an hour after they would say to meet because I am not a patient person when it comes to waiting. After the long wait, I found the food very mediocre. I am doing this from the memories of years ago, but I usually would order the burger. I remember it to be always overcooked. I am a big fan of the pink center (giggity?) and they just ALWAYS overcooked my burger. Now granted the name of the restaurant is not ""The Burger Factory,"" but I have never wanted dessert from this place, probably because I do not like cheesecake. Though I cannot tolerate lactose well, even growing up when my parents never believed that I had such a problem, I never liked cheesecake. I have come here with friends for a party or two as well for dessert, and I usually have a drink and that is it. I have no interest in purchasing their overpriced desserts. This place is just way overpriced and it thinks it is better than it is like many places. I really cannot think of anything that is reasonably priced here except maybe the water. My sister says the cheesecake is good so I trust her on that one, but they try to sell themselves as a full service restaurant. In fact, their website's motto is now ""something for everyone."" Well I guess they do have something for me, an exit sign."
Marc M.,"Redwood City, CA",537,188,,4.0,7/12/2012,"Stopped in to meet with a friend while visiting ATL. I can always appreciate a restaurant that has a 'skinny' menu. Our server Crystal N was amazing. Professional and very courteous. For lunch: Appetizer: Guacamole - can't go wrong here, everything was fresh and satisfied my hunger after trying to find parking during the mid day rush. Entrees: Miso Salmon - asked for the Miso Salmon without the rice and substituted with broccoli. Everything looked great and colorful and tasted delicious. Skinny Chopped Salad - Excellent Drinks: Lemonade and Iced Tea The service really made this experience, I frequent CC Factory all the time, but this was a memorable visit. I put a smiley face on my receipt. :)"
Andrew D.,"Norwich, CT",25,117,16,5.0,4/24/2010,"Not long after the thunderstorms wrecking the southeast blew through Atlanta, I ventured out of my hotel in search of food, and ended up at TCF.  Being from the north, I assumed no one would be out after a storm like that, so was I ever surprised to see a line out the door and a 45-minute wait.  Thank goodness every restaurant, eatery, grocery store, and day care center in the city has a full bar in it, so I dropped myself down in a bar stool and ordered up the tastiest pomegranate margarita I've ever had.  The bartender was a flawless southern belle: blonde, pretty, cheery, and literally bursting with southern hospitality.  I couldn't have asked for better after being cooped up in my hotel room all afternoon. The service here absolutely astounded me.  I ordered up some fried cheese and farfalle with chicken and garlic, and both arrived in under 10 minutes, while there was still a huge line of people who hadn't even made it in the door for a table yet.  The pasta and appetizer were standard TCF fare: huge portions, good quality, and the exact same recipes as the one back in Boston that I'm used to.  I finished off the meal with a hot coffee, and was soon sent on my way with a wave and a ""Have a good night, darling!"" from the bartender.  Now I'm happy, stuffed, and just a little caffeinated, exactly how every meal should end."
Josh B.,"Buford, GA",36,111,11,4.0,9/18/2009,"Cheesecake Factory, what can i say about Cheesecake Factory. Its good but not great. Its always super busy, don't even try to go on a holiday without reservations. The menu has more options than almost any other place i've ever been. With all that, i still like this place for some reason but i really can only go once or twice a year. There food is good for a giant chain like Cheesecake. I really like the Steak Dianne and the seared tuna salad. The steak is delicious and the sauce is awesome, it usually comes with potatos and something i can't remember and its always too much food. I like the Seared tuna salad when i go for lunch. The tuna is perfect and never over done and the dressing on the salad is great, its a really nice light lunch. When i feeling particularly gluttonous i like the meatloaf, its way too much food and could really feed a family of four but its great. Of course the cheesecake is great so i'm really not going to go into it all that much. I love it, in fact, i had some for breakfast just this morning. that should say how good it is. The reason i give four stars and not five is because the service can be dreadfully slow and there is a wait all the time, no matter what time of day you go. and as i said before, if you don't have a reservation, weekends and holidays are out of the question, no one wants to wait 2 hours in this madhouse."
Randi D.,"Detroit, MI",0,2,,5.0,8/31/2012,First time at the cheesecake factory since their isn't any in Michigan..went for lunch and the food was delicious. They give you a loootttt of food. And we had the funniest waiter ever.
Brian L.,"Alexandria, VA",71,65,3,4.0,5/9/2012,"Large selection on the menu. Something on there for anyone. This was my first time eating at a cheescake factory. Our waitress was very attentive. The management even slips in once in a while, too. I think this place is great for dates. U can even get desserts to go if u get overfilled on the entrees."
Malinda L.,"Lawrenceville, GA",106,23,12,4.0,3/9/2012,"this place is amazing! we had great service! The food was delish! It is not too pricey, so it is well worth it!"
Mphs B.,"Evere, Belgium",26,10,5,4.0,5/2/2012,"Went here with the boss on yesterday for a late bday lunch celebration.  It was uncharacteristically slow there for some reason, so we were seated right away. VERY LARGE portion plates, Nice atmosphere, very nice wait staff, attractive people, mixed crowd, they even played EXSCAPE WHO CAN I RUN TO as I ate my high calorie meal wondering how many miles I would have to run to burn off the pasta and strawberry lemonade......"
Shea B.,"Atlanta, GA",4,37,3,4.0,3/18/2012,I will say this one of my favorite restaurants to go to every now and then. I am a creature of habit at times and I just love the Chicken Madeira which I usually order. The menu is like a book with plenty to choose from appetizers to small plates to entree size portions. I have tried quite a few things here and have never been disappointed. They did use to have this seaseme crusted salmon that was oh so delicious but now I think they have it as s pecial every now and then. Too bad because it was definitely better than the Herb Crusted salmon (which is good). They also have good drinks and from what I hear the Cheesecakes are good (I don't like cheesecake).  There are a few restaurants around Atlanta so if one is crowded drive around to the Cumberland location or Buckhead the location.
Nicole B.,"Kansas City, MO",3,23,,4.0,3/17/2012,"Two things I love about this place: Buffalo Blasts and Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake!  The service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. I really have never had a dish I didn't like. They have an enormous menu. Too much to choose from, but I guess that's not a bad thing. Hey, a chain is a chain is a chain, but at least the food here is usually good every time."
Ben H.,"Atlanta, GA",68,309,29,2.0,2/11/2009,"The cheesecake was pretty good, but not amazing.  I had some chicken pasta dish.  I remember it being a lot of mediocre quality food that was too pricey for what it was.  The interior made me feel like I was eating on the set of a crappy movie/theatre production.  Overall, everything was just very mediocre and 'blah' - not surprising from a restaurant that advertises itself as a ""factory"" though.  I'd only go again if I was in the area and had a once-every-few-years desire for some cheesecake. 2"
Anna S.,"Sandy Springs, GA",2,9,,3.0,4/1/2014,"Mmmm.. the only reason I went here was because I had a gift card. The Cheesecake Factory claims to have a gluten free menu.. I went with one of their GFree pastas. While it was certainly super delicious, as I was looking at my noodles I noticed there were a lot of different types of noodles. This is problematic because it appeared it was contaminated with wheat flour noodles. I actually ended up getting pretty sick from it, as I have an allergy... Sure they have a disclaimer for no gfree kitchen, but I don't understand how other noodles ended up in my pasta. My suspicion is they cook noodles together. That was a big negative to me! Their cocktails are delicious, and I did have a nice evening.. Other than the aftermath. Probably won't return, unless I get another gift card / they improve their menu. Or next time just go for drinks!"
Juli H.,"Atlanta, GA",4,33,1,3.0,3/26/2009,"I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory for it's Chicken-n-Biscuits entree which has a gazillion calories and grams of fat but is oh-so delicious.  I can't comment on the cheesecake as I've never ordered it.  Cheesecake makes my digestive tract to seize up, but that's TMI, so onward with the review.... Take-out at this location gets 5 stars.  Even at peak dining hours you can order take-out and it will be ready for you in 15 minutes.  (You also get to park neat the door in the Take-Out parking spaces).   Friendly wait staff at the counter.   My issue with Cheesecake Factory is the pricey entrees.   Atlanta has fabulous restaurants with similar pricing that offer better food quality.  The Chicken-n-Biscuits has a price of $14.95 plus tax.  The entree, in my opinion, should cost around $9.99."
Lisa B.,"Woodstock, GA",128,417,34,4.0,2/3/2009,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory location. I actually live closer to the Buckhead location but refuse to go there because of the inconsistent service and crazy wait times. I have been to the Perimeter location a substantial number of times and have never had to wait more than 30 minutes. The service is generally pretty good. The food of course is not off the charts, but there are some good dishes on the menu. There are about a bazillion menu items so you should be able to find something you like.  As an appetizer I like the Buffalo Blast Bites (they're spicy!). I am sad they removed the Brushetta from the appetizer line up - it was excellent! I always get a sandwich here - I like the Classic Club sandwich and the Chicken Avocado Club the best. I have had some pasta dishes and they were only ""ok"" to me. As far as desert of course you have to get a slice of cheesecake (although their chocolate cakes are off the charts good too!). I am so happy they introduces the Dulce de Leches cheesecake a few years ago - it's my absolute fav and you must try this is you like caramel. The Cheesecake Factory is a step up from your standard casual dining chains so don't come here expecting a full out gourmet experience."
Sarah E.,"Lawrenceville, GA",229,397,1,3.0,1/25/2009,"I absolutely loved this place when I was younger and had less experience with good restaurants.  Now, I know better.  It's not awful, but in a city that's known for its food, there are a lot of better places you could go.   The food is pretty good (but not astoundingly so), and there is an enormous selection of items.  The portions are huge.  However, the wait is always freaking RIDICULOUS and the prices are quite high for what you are getting.  Also, the advertisement-laden menus are a little odd.   Unlike some others, I do think that the cheesecake here is quite good.  I'd recommend this place later at night (when the rush has died down) for a slice of cheesecake and a drink or a coffee.  For some reason, I still end up here for lunch or dinner with my family every now and then, and it's never bad... except for the stupid wait.  I don't get it."
Amrita R.,"Saint Louis, MO",293,359,161,3.0,10/30/2009,"Cheesecake Factory isn't my first choice for a meal. It's rather overpriced and the food isn't that great. Not to mention, the menu is a bit overwhelming and it's hit or miss. That being said, I have managed to find a few gems on the menu that never fail me. I only go about once every few months if I am really out of ideas for dinners with friends, or taking a picky eater for a meal.  I just have to be prepared to consume many unhealthy calories. The avocado eggrolls are to die for. It's weird how some things on the menu can be unbelieveably bland and others can be so flavorful your mouth waters thinking about it.. odd. The eggrolls are totally worth going for actually, or just splitting with a friend as a snack. My favorite dish on the menu is the mahi mahi mediterranean... I find mahi mahi rather dry and it's my least favorite fish but the flavors added make up for it. The mahi mahi is served on top of delicious mashed potatoes and garlic and onions, with pesto and surrounded by diced tomatoes in a tasty sauce. However, nothing here is really worth the price; the fish costs $19.95; although the portion size does satisfy me for nearly 3 meals... I wouldn't choose to come here very often but if I must, I stick with these tried and true favorites. Oh yes, and the strawberry lemonade is always made with perfection as well, usually with sugar around the rim for my sweet tooth. And of course the cheesecake is cheesecake.  :)"
