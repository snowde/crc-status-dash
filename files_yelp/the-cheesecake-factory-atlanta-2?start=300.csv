Yeme T.,"Atlanta, GA",133,163,17,3.0,3/31/2011,"Good food! Im not particularly crazy about any given item on the menu. However every item i have tried is pretty good. Service is not too good. Dont even think about coming on a Friday or Saturday evening. Super crowded, 1 hr+ waits, and horrendous service."
Alaina F.,"Decatur, GA",31,67,60,4.0,3/18/2011,"After a day of shopping at the mall, my husband, mother-in-law and I decided to eat here. After barely squeezing in the door due to the packed foyer of the place, we gave our name and the hostess said the wait was 30 minutes! At this point I'm starving and 6 months pregnant, so you can imagine my mood. Luckily we grabbed a few menus while standing for an abnormal amount of time, and I got the idea of what I wanted to eat. Then I got tired and a bit dizzy, one of the waitresses was kind enough to bring me a chair to sit in. After a couple minutes in the chair, we were called and seated in a roomy quiet booth. The place was hopping and people were everywhere, so I thought that the food must be damn good for a slew of people to want to wait 30 minutes before sitting. Our waitress was very friendly and accomadating, and brought the bread basket and drinks out fast. Bread was good, and it helped with my hunger.  I ordered the clubhouse salad which was one of the best (and most fattening) salads I've ever had. My husband ordered the hamburger with fries, which I tried and loved. The fries were crispy and perfect. My mother-in-law ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. I tried hers as well and it was very good. The succotash was very fresh and crisp.  Afterwards we ordered desserts, my husband and I split a piece of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, which of course was very delicious. My mother-in-law got the lemoncello cream torte which was outstanding.  All of us enjoyed our meal tremendously and plan to return. Hopefully next time the wait wont be as long, and the place wont be packed with such rude people. The staff was great, felt bad for our waitress after seeing the check left by whoever sat in our booth before us--they left $7 tip on a $80 bill! How sickening. People should be punished for leaving hideously low tips, waiters have hard jobs, they only get paid less than $3 an hour! They depend on your tips people for their income! Don't be so cheap!!!"

Romika A.,"Atlanta, GA",2,10,,4.0,9/27/2012,Am a huge fan of there redvelvet chese cake and cant live without it on every special ocassion. As far as the food goes I have no complaints and dine here ocassionally. What I like about this location is that they are always very welcoming and have great service for picky eaters like me.
Natalie G.,"Loganville, GA",610,193,53,3.0,2/2/2011,"I think that they tell you not to have sex until marriage for a reason. I think the philosophy behind it is this: If you only have sex with the person you marry, then you do not have anything/anyone to compare them with. Well...on that note,  Hubbi and I went on a triple date here. The ambiance in really nice. I really liked how all the waitors/waitresses were dressed in all white. The food: I only ordered the shrimp (popcorn) appetizer. I must say that it did not come out looking like popcorn shrimp...I could only then imagine what their jumbo shrimp looked like....the size of a chicken leg maybe? I was really full from eating a full sushi dinner before I got there. Hubbi's impromptu idea to go out to eat.  The shrimp was pretty good. I also took a sip of my hubbi's alcoholic beverage and it was sooo strong. Mai Thai.  I ordered a blended berry juice concotion that was really good. I would like to try this place again when I can drink (my alcoholic) beverages again.  This place was just mediocre to me... Compring to other places....."
Ariana M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,8,,1.0,1/5/2014,"Updated review: I wrote a review for this restaurant before but recently I have went in and was completely disappointed! The server was rushing me to order because I was the only one at the table who didn't know what to order so she attempted to help me out quickly and ended up recommending a pasta with bacon in it without letting me know that it has bacon in it. I do not eat pork and I violate my religion! When I asked the server if it had pork it in she did not know, which shows that they do not know about the food they are selling, not do they care if the customer will enjoy the meal. When I told her I couldn't eat pork she grabbed the plate the plate from me and said ""what do I do? Do I move it away from you?"" In a sarcastic tone as if there was something funny about this situation. I refused to pay for the meal and was told that I ate all of it and that can't be done. I'm sure that even people who do not like their meals at other restaurants the waiters and managers are pleased to satisfy them without even a question and offer them another meal. The manager at this Cheesecake Factory took this situation very lightly as if it was unimportant to me or him! He was very careless about my religion and not very sympathetic! This is was truly pissed me off, I know people make mistakes and when they are not able to own up to those mistakes and act careless as these people who would ever want to come back here? As I was waiting for my friends I overheard other workers who had no part in this situation speaking about me, laughing and mocking me to their coworkers. After hearing this, I asked the guy who was speaking of the situation for his name which he would not disclose, and neither would the manager! He just stood there as if he was not a manager and as if there was nothing wrong with that .This situation was not everyone's business and I will be going to corporate about this, if not any further!"
Amrita J.,"Duluth, GA",343,172,30,5.0,7/31/2008,"Ok so this 5  star review is just for last night and my delicious cheesecake that I had!!   So yesterday was the 30th Anniversary for Cheesecake Factory and they had $1.50 slices....yes ladies and gentleman you read that correctly only ONE dollar and FIFTY cents!!!!!    ooooooh.....ahhhhhh......... Let me add, that granted the wait was absolutely ridiculous due to this joyous sweet tooth occasion, but man was it worth it......I had the Dulce de Leche cheescake and it was soooooooooooo yum!!!  Even met other cheesecake fans while waiting, it was a great deal, and a good dessert run!!      :)"
Linda K.,"Buford, GA",11,1,,5.0,1/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat!  I've been here many times and they have never disappointed me.  They have an amazing menu.  Staff are excellent.  For dinners, I recommend getting there early.  My husband & I went with another couple 2 weeks ago.  We put our names down around 6:30 p.m.  It was only a 5 min. wait.  Within 30 min it went to a 45 min wait for 4 people.  For dessert, I recommend the Hershey's cheesecake.  Yum!"
Emily R.,"Atlanta, GA",239,85,27,4.0,12/2/2008,"I would like to preface this review by saying that I do know good food, I have eaten at some of the worlds best restaurants, Michelin starred restaurants, etc.  What the Cheesecake Factory serves is not good food, it's acceptable food. You can expect to have food of a reasonable quality that is exactly the same every time you dine there.  Where CF really stands out, other than sheer convenience - I can walk there from work and live within 2 miles, is the service. I would highly recommend asking for Eric to be your server and if his section is full, it is worth the wait to have him.  He knows the menu so well, he can make great suggestions like with x dish you should request extra sauce or z dish goes better with this side than the one that comes with it. At a restaurant where food quality isn't that fantastic, this kind of information is invaluable. Plus he's just a really nice guy. Michael at the front desk is also fantastic and has made good suggestions for alternate servers when I've come in when Eric is off.  As for food, the roasted chicken is usually tasty and I like their waffle with strawberries for Sunday brunch. The vanilla bean cheesecake is delicious, as is the sundae because they make their own hot fudge and caramel sauce, which put their desserts on a much higher level than most chains that get sauces from Sysco and whipped cream from a can."
Nateia F.,"Atlanta, GA",98,230,79,4.0,6/10/2009,"I love the cheesecake factory because they have the best cheesecakes!  Whenever I eat there, I only get either the Salmon Salad or the Cajun Chicken/Shrimp Pasta.  My daughter will get the Chicken Fingers (they 're good or the Burger and Fries. My favorite drink there is the Tropical Martini.  Also, when I want a Virgin drink, my daughter and I will have the Frozen Mango drink...oh it is sooo good! Great spot to eat for a birthday!"
John S.,"Marietta, GA",10,37,,5.0,10/26/2008,"My wife, son and I went here for afternoon lunch and I must say, it was great! We thought that it was going to be busier than it actually was. We went in and sat right down.  Everything went pretty normal for dining out (drink order, apps, food order and dessert order). All our food was excellent. I got the Factory Burger, my wife got the original burger and my son got the cajun chicken fingers meal. We got the popcorn shrimp for an appetizer. All of our food was hot and quick!  We got a Plain Cheesecake for our daughter, my wife and I got the Black Out Cake and my son got the Oreo Cheesecake. All were very excellent!! Our server was also excellent! She didn't let any of our drinks run dry and took all our empty plates and dishes as soon as we were done. She didn't push us out or push us to buy anything we didn't want to.  Overall, I think they got it goin' on!! I have only been here 2 times and both times were excellent visits!"
Carolyn B.,"Atlanta, GA",187,123,,3.0,5/22/2008,"Three Stars... 1 for the mediocre service (hostess) but it is to be expected with places that set 'themselves' on a pedestal 2 The large portions of food which in my opinion aren't good enough for the price that these dishes are tagged with. I had grilled chicken that was a bit scorched from the grill =( 3 To be able to keep a table of 6 happy the waiter definitely did his thing. Very friendly, good with the recommendations (I mean overall) and making sure our needs were met. ...I just can't give this place more than three stars because of the wait. You wait an hour for a table, then once you sit down and order the food it's another hour to an hour and a half just for the food. For this time frame I could've whip up my own mediocre meal at home for free."
Reid B.,"McDonough, GA",14,39,3,5.0,4/12/2009,"My wife and I ate at this Cheesecake Factory because someone had given us a gift card.  We had eaten at the location on Peachtree Street several years ago and for some reason we had never gone back over the years.  After eating here again, we will definitely be going back. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were pretty good.  I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, but my wife's ""oohs and ahhs"" about them made me think that they were better than I thought myself.  We both got sweet tea and it had a funny after-taste, so we changed to another drink.  For the main course, my wife got a Margherita Pizza and I opted for the Kobe Hamburger.  The pizza was good, but I have to say that the burger was one of the top 3 that I have ever eaten anywhere - period.  It was so flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I will go back just for the burgers alone.  For dessert, we got the Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake and it was very good, too. The service was excellent and the food was excellent, what more can you ask for.  I am usually not a big fan of chain restaurants like this, but I will definitely return again.  Great job, folks."
Megan C.,"Bothell, WA",100,79,3,2.0,3/10/2010,"I hate this place.  The menu is too large, I occasionally return, thinking I might find something I like, but I never do.   The drinks are pricey, food mediocre for the price and the cheescake is decent.  On my last visit, my waitress spilled a beer all over me and was unapologetic.  I had to call over the manager and request they cover the cost of dry cleaning my dress.   I will not be returning anytime soon."
Daryl G.,"Collinsville, MS",5,45,32,5.0,3/13/2011,"One of my favorite stops.  I've never had anything off the menu I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  The lunch sized salads are the best deal around.  You can get one of the best salads you've ever had, in a nice atmosphere and good service for less than fifteen dollars, including tip.  Of course if you order a drink besides water and decide to sample any of the wonderful desserts, it'll get pricey quick."
Adrienne T.,"Atlanta, GA",140,814,120,3.0,9/3/2007,"Just like all the other Cheesecake Factory's- stick with your favorite dish, and you'll be good.  Service at this one was incredibly friendly, and fast.  Enjoyed the laid back atmosphere, and the bar drinks were tasty.  If you like the CF, or are looking to try one out, you'll enjoy this one."
June C.,"Roswell, GA",5,86,,5.0,7/4/2012,"I have eaten here on my birthday a couple of times at their Alpharetta location and enjoyed it a lot. The food here is super flavorful and delicious. I love the awesome and great service here. Also, the cheesecake here is absolutely to die for. The food prices here are reasonable. The food portions are plentiful and will have you leaving full. I love the interior of this restaurant. I will definitely be back here again soon."
Teddy O.,"Atlanta, GA",160,62,,4.0,7/16/2011,"Food was good, service was good. I think I'm getting tired of everything but the cheesecake."
D W.,"Wahiawa, HI",0,4,,1.0,4/10/2011,"Worst service EVER!  Waitress was too busy talking to friends to get us refills. Waited for our table for 40 minutes, after ordering waited for our food for 50 minutes, order was wrong  never got an apology, never a sorry  in fact the waitress argued with us!  Complained to the management about the waitress- after we had paid the bill- he just said ""Thanks for the feedback"". Will never return!"
J. D.,"Atlanta, GA",47,442,85,3.0,12/12/2006,"I lived in California for some time, and there were Chessecake Factory's in many locations, so it wasn't such a novelty as here in Atlanta.  This Perimeter Mall Location is the second in the Metro area (Buckhead was first).  Cheescake Factory is a phenominom in the restaurant world.  It is wildly successul.  It is easy to pick on this place.  It has over the top gaudy decor, a large diner-like menu with actual paid product advertisements for car dealers and the like, and other quirky features.  With all that said, I like this place for what it is.  The food is fresh and tasty.  The namesake chessescakes are really good, and so are the other cakes and desserts.  The portions are huge and somewhat hard to finish.  The crowds that line up and wait for hours to eat here seem a little too devoted to all this excess.  I like to eat here in off hours or sit at the bar."
