Tiffany S.,"Atlanta, GA",11,44,,3.0,5/24/2007,"They have a drink called the Georgia Peach -- it's a frozen drink that is reaaally good. Tastes just like a peach and uses the alcohol taste to the advantage. Seriously. YUM YUM!! But the food is so-so. There are things I love that taste great, but there's also some really crappy food on their menu. Luckily, last time I went...had a awesome waiter who's advice...was sooooo right on.  As for the cheesecake, it's yummy...but more often than not, I feel too full to indulge. Alas, if only their menu wasn't so ghetto looking with the adds...and the menu wasn't so big that you couldn't pick the bleh food from the good food."
Peter Y.,"Duluth, GA",87,180,4,3.0,7/10/2008,"You get a decent amount of food but the quality isn't quite there. The spinach appetizer and of course, the cheesecakes are great.  I don't come often but whenever I do, I end up not getting any real food and eating 2 or 3 different types of cheesecakes. I like the Oreo and Tiramisu."
Amanda S.,"Cumming, GA",5,109,14,3.0,2/1/2008,"Came here today for lunch with a friend.  I had only been to a Cheesecake Factory twice previously, and never at this location. We were told there'd be a 15 minute wait to be seated, but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Impressive!  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in choosing what to order.  (And if you've never seen CF's menu, you WILL need help--it's the longest menu I've ever seen!  And there are no pictures of the dishes, just ads on the back of every page.  Rather tacky for an otherwise upscale chain.) We had our food promptly, and our waitress was good about keeping our drinks refilled.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to order cheesecake because my friend had somewhere to be, and without cheesecake the experience was sorely lacking.  Word to the wise: don't go a restaurant named after a dessert if you won't have time to order said dessert. If I were to give the chain's bigwigs a piece of advice, it would be to shorten the menu and specialize in just one type of entree.  Specializing in just one type of dessert seems to have worked so far."
Chriss F.,"Atlanta, GA",37,252,,3.0,6/16/2010,"I have been at this location many, many times and have enjoyed the service which is a highlight of Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Food is excellent as well as the iced mocha !   Desserts are rediculous haha ..definitely more than your recommended daily allowance of sugar and fat :)  But who's counting  ha"
Whitney T.,"Atlanta, GA",459,491,105,5.0,5/13/2009,"""One of my favorite restaurants! The filet mignon is awesome :). Strawberry lemonade is delicious! And of course the cheesecake is spectacular!"""
Ayna M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2012,"I tried to order the Ahi Tartare to go over the phone and was told that I cannot order it to go. No explanation, simply that it cannot be done. My coworker had just picked up the same item for me last week and brought it to the office, and when I mentioned the same to the phone attendant, she simply reiterated that they do not have it on the to go menu and cannot offer it to go. Poor and inconsistent service :-( Needless to say, I went across the street to Alon's for a tuna Wasabi sandwich....their loss..."
Stephen M.,"Athens-Clarke County, GA",31,102,130,3.0,7/16/2011,We went here on a Friday night for a friend birthday. The wait wasn't bad just 40 mins. The menu is way to large. The food was okay for me but the people around me really seemed to enjoy their meal.
Jan K.,"Duluth, GA",15,272,,5.0,6/23/2011,"How can I not like this place? Service is impeccable. Portions are value recieved and the food tastes very good. Hubby had his ""the best"" burger in the city..and not one of those silly little gourmet burgers. This is a real man's burger! hanging over the side of the bun,loaded with cheese,grilled onion,lettuce and tomato and garlic mayo. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and deliciously sloppy.""Cut it in half"" I say. ""Oh no ."" he replies. ""It is much more fun this way."" I had a girlie salad with about 750 calories. It is the new clubhouse salad with turkey,beets,avacado,tomatoes,swisscheese,etc.and tossed in one of the best thousand island dressings in the city. Tell no one we had the apple crisp for dessert. Since I am not a fan of cooked apples I only ate my half,with the whipped cream and the ice cream. No dinner or breakfast for me. We love this chain restaurant very much but try not to go more than once a month. BTW with a 6$ tip the lunch was 40$ USA."
Tiff Y.,"Phenix City, AL",0,89,,1.0,12/4/2008,"I think the only good thing here is the cheesecake! Everything else is just not that great to me. The portions are enormous and could easily be shared, but nothing seems to be all that tasty to me."
Mack D.,"Atlanta, GA",7,196,,4.0,4/28/2011,The fried macaroni and cheese is amazing!  Perfectly fried and breaded on the outside and gooey and tasty on the inside.  The service is always top notch and the deserts are pretty good too.
Lesa T.,"Mableton, GA",17,120,24,4.0,4/1/2009,"Okay, I know this is a chain, however, everytime I am at this location the service ROCKS!  We were greeted and seated promptly, our server was attentive but also understood we were very busy talking!  :)  And the food was great.  Oh and the new chocolate cake/cheesecake...a new favorite.  Dear heaven!  Yum!"
Chuan S.,"Atlanta, GA",47,143,,4.0,6/27/2008,I was out there for a co-worker's kid's birthday the second day I was in Atlanta.  The advantage of having dining with a family is that you guess to try a bunch of different appetizers.  Hot spinach and cheese dip was good.  Also had the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer rolls.  The best appetizer was the Thai Lettuce Wrap.  It was a make it yourself chicken lettuce roll.  Fun and tasty.  I ordered a Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon which was bigger than I imagined.  The salmon was cooked just right.  Not too dry and not too raw.  The herb crust gave the salmon extra texture while still biting into a tender piece of juicy salmon.  I was fulled but I couldn't resist the temptation of a Snickers Cheesecake.  Bless the soul that decide to mix Snickers with cheesecake.  It tasted just like the ice cream snicker bars.
Lori T.,"Atlanta, GA",11,175,52,3.0,9/12/2010,love the variety on the menu at this restaurant. the drink selection is pretty good - i can always find an alocholic beverage i like. the portions are way too huge though - you should order one item and share it with a friend or loved one. i think the prices are a little too high for what you are getting. i don't eat here often unless i get a gift card.  the fried mac & cheese is a delight!
Eric G.,"Atlanta, GA",47,75,9,3.0,6/15/2008,"Haven't been here in a while and I remember why. It is always crowded. After waiting for a table they decided to try and squeeze us in this tiny table for two next to a large party. I said I don't think this will work. So we opted for a high top table in the bar. We decided to do appetizers since it was late in the day. The popcorn shrimp was as I remembered. It was ok. I decided on a soup and sandwich turkey sandwich and what was supposed to be Broccoli cheese soup. The bacon was right out of the fridge. Why do restaurants server cold bacon on a sandwich. I can't stand that. The broccoli cheese soup was Nasty... I love their passion fruit Iced Tea. My other half had a BLT salad and a lunch pizza. He enjoyed it. Again, I always seem to choose franchises last of the minute. When I get hungry watch out. Feed me quick or I get mean. The service was very slow and when the server asked if we wanted cheesecake I was not in the mood. This was a mediocre experience."
Bootsy L.,"Provincetown, MA",0,59,,4.0,1/11/2009,"A bit Vegas-y in terms of ambience and the advertisements on the rightside of the menu tasky, however, my party enjoyed it's meal at the Perimeter Mall Cheesecake Factory. The food was well represented, the waitress a real doll, and boo-yah! some delicious White Chocolate somethin somethin cheesecake to chase it all down. Not a fan, but I'd do it again out of convenience."
Scott L.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,59,4,4.0,2/26/2008,"If you have ever been in a large Las Vegas Casino and eaten in their lavishly decorated Cafe's then you know what the environment is like. High ceiling, large indoor trees, busy, great smiling service, long waits for tables at peak times and large groups of people wandering in.  No wonder - wait til you see the portion sizes, large menu selection and the CHEESECAKE selection. Yum.  My Cardiologist wrote a prescrip limiting my attendance to once monthly.   Great place to take family or a casual date. Save room for the Cheescake. I ususally take mine home with extra whipped cream."
C. P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,100,,3.0,10/14/2010,"Great location and great cheesecake, but the food leaves something to be desired. Also, it's ALWAYS packed. I've never had less than a half-hour wait when dining here. My husband and I usually just stop in for cheesecake. The food isn't bad, but it just isn't stellar, especially considering the price points. Also, the portions are huge so you can get away with splitting most dishes (especially when you're having dessert). We've also never gotten very good service at this location. Most of the waiters and waitresses are surly and have an apathetic attitude (although I'd imagine waiting tables here is very, very stressful considering the huge volume of customers flowing in the door at all times, so I can kind of understand why they aren't beaming with excitement). The only true complaint that I have is that if you get cheesecake to go, they will give you a very small slice that's probably 1/3 of the size that it would be if you ordered it in the restaurant. I know this happens regularly and I believe it's a company-wide occurrence because it's happened to other people I know and at other locations. Lame, Cheesecake Factory, lame!! It costs the same whether it's to go or dine-in, so the portion should be the same!"
B W.,"Atlanta, GA",6,130,27,4.0,8/13/2010,I like coming to this location for a girls night on the town. I love sitting on the patio people watching and the drink 'georgia peach' or whatever it is is great. one of the better spots for good service.
LJ S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,4.0,1/1/2011,New Years - football and a very good meal at Cheesecake Factory at the Mall.  Cool daysa lately and their Jamaican pepper shrimp and a mojito hit the spot.  Server was polite and helpful.
Michael V.,"Atlanta, GA",254,13,,2.0,4/5/2009,"I attended the Cheesecake Factory last weekend for the first time, mainly because I was given a gift card for Christmas and finally got around to cashing it in.  We had to wait for about 45 minutes, which I wasn't worried about at the time, but once the food came I was a little upset I had waited so long.  Now, admittedly at this point in my life I should know better than to order a steak at a chain restaurant and expect the world, but I had a big gift card so I figured what the hell.  And any chain establishment that's willing to charge $33 for a filet mignon had better mean business.  Well, suffice it to say the Cheesecake Factory does not mean business when it comes to the steaks.  The meat was just okay tasting.  Clearly not prime beef or anything close.  I guess I equated it to when you pay $33 for a steak at Ruth's Chris and the thing melts in your mouth and it's totally worth it.  Any establishment that can make meat melt is a-ok in my book, but there is no meat melting at the Cheesecake Factory people.  Let it be known.  The whole thing just tasted like a halfway decent piece of meat drenched in Worstershire sauce and a few spices.  Also, the fries I got were so bland and clearly frozen and that just sucks.  I mean, at this point if you're not doing fresh cut fries in your restaurant, I just do not understand what you are thinking.  They are such a crowd pleaser and not that difficult to make, but I digress.  I did not actually have the cheesecake, which was probably a mistake, but I was too full of mediocre steak at that point and was just ready to go home.  Highlight of the meal was the service, which was excellent.  Our waiter was very charming and was on top of our every need.  Also, the fried calamari appetizer was quite good.  Not chewy and overcooked like you get in most bigger chain joints.  I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying I won't order the steak again, and I suppose I thought they should be publicly spited for charging so much for such an affront to the steak community."
