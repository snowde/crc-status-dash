soomy s.,"Cumming, GA",39,34,,3.0,11/30/2008,"My friends and I usually choose the Perimeter area to grub and gab cause it's a good middle point for everyone.  We came here cause the portions are huge, big selection of items and generally speaking - cause it's a chain- we don't need to worry too much about variation in taste.  Thus, we're able to focus on the main attraction - us, not the food.  I know, I know, yelpers are probably thinking - the whole point of writing a review is to write about the food.  And that is true, just not 100% of the time.  So, these are the usual suspects that we feast on - that pretty much is a guarantee that you will leave satisfied.  The key to eating at this eatery - is to eat chinese family style.  That way you can taste a bit of everything and not get bored of the dish in front of you.  So...for the four of us, we usually end up getting 3 dishes and split everything.  We got the Chinese Chicken Salad (dinner portion), the Thai Chicken Pasta (dinner portion) and the The combo Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane.  These are pretty safe bets when you dine there.  Just don't make the mistake of expecting the quality of the steak to match Stony River in Duluth, or the Thai Chicken Pasta to be able to compete with your favorite Thai restaurant..just don't do that and come with the mindset  you are there to catch up with friends and  you'll leave pretty happy.  Oh, also can't leave w/o a cheesecake - they're pretty damn good - even better sharing with friends.  Also, have to say they make excellent bloody mary's...don't even need the shot of vodka.  cheers!"
Brandi R.,"Atlanta, GA",35,4,,4.0,4/21/2010,"My first time going to this Cheesecake Factory was on April 3, 2010.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience.  My friend and I went at around 8 on a Saturday night and I was really nervous because I thought we would have a super long wait. However, once we gave the host our name, we were seated within a couple of minutes.  I was really happy and shocked. I'm guessing the reason we didn't have to wait is because there were only 2 of us.    Our waiter was named Gary and he was really good.  To start, my friend and I both ordered from the Small Plate section of the menu.  I got the mini-crab cakes and my friend got the pizette(which is described as a small pizza) and her topping was sausage.  My mini-crab cakes were delicious!  They were basically crab cake balls and they give you about 7 and there was way more meat than filler, which is what I look for in a crab cake.  My friend's pizza was also good and for it to be on the small plate section of the menu, it was a good size.   For my main course, I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp that is served with rice, black beans, and plantains.  The shrimp are small, but they give you a lot.  Honestly, the shrimp were good, but I have no intention to order them again.  My friend had the steak diane and chicken combination plate. She said the chicken was okay, but the steak was really good.     I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but I figured I couldn't go to the Cheesecake Factory without having cheesecake, so I order the red velvet cheesecake.  It was really good and I would order it again!  I forgot which cheesecake my friend ordered.     So overall, I enjoyed my experience here.  We were promptly seated, the waiter was really nice, our food came in a decent amount of time, and the food was good.  I would definitely come here again."
