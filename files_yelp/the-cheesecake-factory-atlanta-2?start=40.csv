Tinisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",76,66,186,3.0,7/1/2017,"I've been to this locations several times for dinner, lunch and happy hour. There is ample parking as this location is pretty much at the mall. As usual for Cheesecake Factory the restaurant is massive with a massive menu. My bf always gets the fettuccini Alfredo with a meat and broccoli. He must like it since it's the 4th time he ordered it. I like the fettuccine noodles they use, the sauce is pretty good too. They do tend to skimp on the meat and broccoli though. I had the skinny chopped salad which was pretty tasteless and had some brown romaine hearts in it. Portions are super large here so I suggest ordering off the lunch menu if you can. Prices are reasonable because of the portion sizes. Wait staff has been pretty consistent with pretty good service. Food comes out hot and promptly. Taste wise the food is average at best. Happy hour prices are great on food (get the burger!) and ok on drinks.  Oddly enough I've never had the cheesecake. It's probably because I'm always so full after my entree. All around a solid place to eat but it won't wow you. Enjoy!"
Judy R.,"Atlanta, GA",9,92,12,1.0,11/13/2017,Went down hill used to be good hamburger was so dry and fish had no taste slaw had no dressing told manager didn't seem to care we eat out a lot never again at this location dirty  silverware dirty tsble
Salim O.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,11/4/2017,Staff was really really rude.. we were 6 people together and we told them at the time of check in.. after 45 mnts we got a table and server comes and said this table is only for 4 people and you ll have to wait another half an hour. Did not even apologize :(((((((
Lashanda W.,"Atlanta, GA",4,16,24,4.0,12/14/2017,"Best experience with a group that I have had here thus far. I came to Cheesecake in Dunwoody for my boss's farewell party with about 18 of my colleagues around 11:30am on a Tuesday. Once we arrived we noticed that the restaurant had just had a Food Safety inspection and had not received a favorable grade. We were for a lack of words mortified to see that right before our meal as we are ironically employees of the nations premier health protection agency. Nevertheless, our reservation was made and it would be difficult to navigate such a large group to another restaurant with such short notice so we decided to take a chance. We had one waitress I believe her name was Ashley or Britney and she served all of us efficiently and with courtesy. The food did not come out all together but that wasn't a big deal for us. No one had any issues with their dishes, all preferences were paid attention to. We received our drinks in a timely fashion as well as our checks. I ordered the same thing I always get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with extra veggies. It was piping hot but a little heavier on the sauce then usual. No one reported ill so all went well."
Victor A.,"Houston, TX",60,21,3,3.0,6/6/2017,My favorite spot for slow customer service! On the plus they still have a wide variety....of food and service....
Rebecca H.,"Atlanta, GA",258,74,257,2.0,6/15/2017,"Flavor-wise, I think this is one of the worst locations I've visited. The service I can't really comment about, it's just mediocre and nothing special. The food though! I genuinely enjoy a lot of the dishes at most Cheesecake Factory locations. This one was a stickler--absolutely everything was bad! My carbonara had barely any cream, had no taste, had maybe 7-8 pieces of tiny bacon thrown in. My friend ordered the angel hair shrimp pasta and oh my gosh, that was the worst thing ever! The noodles were no where near al dente and basically melted in my mouth, and that's not a good thing. The noodles just broke apart because they were so over cooked. Plus, the portion was oddly small for a Cheesecake Factory plate. We also ordered an appetizer, the fried tods. Supposedly this was supposed to have pieces of bacon! Nope! All I could taste was flavorless mush. An odd texture and lackluster taste. The highlight of our meal was probably the bread service. That was yummy with the butter... but honestly, quite disappointed and will not be coming back."
Hema M.,"Sparks, NV",0,56,46,1.0,5/16/2017,"Ok just so you know i'm not picking on them for no reason Neil my server was a sweetheart. This is more to do with the way i was treated from when i walked in.  The hostess didn't introduce herself, didn't welcome me to the cheesecake factory did not say thank you and moved 2 people in front of me even though i was the first one in! This happens a lot in Georgia the only thing i can assume is because i am not of the same ethnicity. Coming from the west coast this has never been a problem but it happens all the time only with women in Georgia. Then the girl who seated me actually went out of her way not to give me what i wanted. I asked if i could sit in a booth and was told there is no server in that section, and low and behold there are now people sitting in that area. Maybe its just me but i think her attitude and LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE stinks. I'm just visiting Atlanta and this will be the last time i will come to the Cheesecake Factory here.  I thought we were all born equal! apparently not. This needs addressing by management.The time of my visit is 6pm the date is May 16th 2017 you should be able to work out who the two girls are. Very Disappointing. I love Cheesecake factory on the west coast we have none of these issues in California. Neil the Server is very nice, attentive and polite. His customer service is excellent. I can't praise him enough."
MaryShannon R.,"Atlanta, GA",139,38,78,5.0,7/18/2017,I'm glad this location is close because it's always a go to when we can't decide where to go and we are never disappointed. It usually stays pretty busy but it's a huge place so room for everyone. The outside seating is awesome and I try to sit out there when it's open. Food is always amazing! Mac and cheese balls appetizer is good and enough for everyone. I've never been disappointed with anything. If you have room there have ton of dessert options (duh) I always take some to go! Parking is all over the place but it shares a lot with other restaurants and a mall so it can be trying depending on Day and time.
Paula P.,"Madison, AL",2,34,14,4.0,7/6/2017,Food was great. Martini's were strong.  Loosing a star because the patio could use some cleaning. All of the chairs had bird shit on them. When you're spending $100 on a late lunch you expect a comfortable clean environment.
Marie M.,"Atlanta, GA",204,214,37,3.0,11/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory should not surprised anyone. It is after all a chain. I am giving it 3 stars since I think we received excellent service by Our server Kwame and the food was just ok and a little bit pricey for what it was. We ordered a flatbread and a chili to share. We also got one slice of cheesecake. I still ended up paying around $20 even with a $25 gift certificate. Still, the food was consistent. The chili was really tasty. The flatbread was OK, nothing special but it tasted ok. The pumpkin cheesecake was of course very tasty. Can't go wrong with that! Having said that, it looks like the cheesecake portions are getting smaller. It's the Cheesecake Factory so you should have a good idea of what to expect. The service was really good, the food average."
Nina L.,"Doraville, GA",96,107,204,4.0,4/16/2017,"I had the Super Food salad. It was soooo good. And good for me. They have a very extensive menu here and a crazy amount of cheese cakes, every one in your party should be able to find something they'll like on the menu.  It takes me a long time to figure out what I want to eat, so I usually pick it out on the online menu ahead of time. I feel reviewers are slightly biased against chains - keep that in mind when you view a chain restaurant's score. Reviewers favor restaurants that are not well known- it's like a hipster mentality thing. They give these novel one - of - a - kind spots raving reviews, and then when you go there, you're like, why was everyone raving about that? There's a reason why there are 20,000 MacDonalds, but every MacDonalds somehow has a 2 star rating *thoughtful finger on chin emoji*. You know where chain restaurants actually rack up big points? Consistency. Expert designed recipes. Ability to comp over slight dissatisfactions. Coupons and specials. Rarity does not equal higher quality- the reverse is actually more likely."
Jennifer F.,"Covington, GA",1,19,32,5.0,7/11/2017,"Love this place, I have yet to have a bad experience. Food is always good, server was great. Wait is never longer than 15 mins."
Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125,1.0,2/23/2017,"Food was so-so (3 stars out of 5).  It's a typical Cheesecake Factory location with a menu so large, you really don't know what to get. We got the banana cream cheesecake and the chocolate turtle cream cheesecake, both of which were pretty good at first, but were doused in whipped cream so it was a bit overwhelming. Service was what drove this place to be 1 star.  We were there in a group of four in what should have been a 60-75m dinner, but turned out to be 2H.  The service was just flat out slow.  Multiple times, we were looking around for our server and he was nowhere to be found.  We ended up having to pour our own water at one point.  The first time was between the bread and the entrees, and we saw him chatting with another server.  The second time was after our entrees were finished and we wanted to order cheesecake and he was nowhere to be found.  When we finally wanted to order cheesecake, he mentioned it would be faster to get it out front (but we said we wanted to eat it there). Just to get the check took another chunk of time.  Overall, the meal got dragged out longer than necessary.  Thank goodness for the good company!"
Haley F.,"Lawrenceville, GA",4,26,6,4.0,6/16/2017,Nice atmosphere...internal temp is perfect. Bartender gave good pour and food is good. What else do I want? Not much lol
Shijie Y.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,4,4,1.0,4/2/2017,"The worst experience I ever had! This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory. CF is well known for it's consistency due its standard ingredients and recipes, however they forgot that the quality of workers is equally important. - Bad chefs: Eggs Benedict - poached eggs or hard boiled eggs? A local diner can do this better. Breakfast for 4 people took 45min for the food. We are not talking about peak hours. It was 10:50am!  - Bad service staff: even after I complained about the food, she still included full amount for something I didn't eat in the bill.  - The WORST manager: this is the root cause of everything. Their management is really bad. I called the manager and explained my experience. He had no facial expression and he did NOT say the word ""sorry"" at all. It was surprising to see that in the service industry! Maybe they think they will get business no matter what because they are in a popular area, but I will not come back to this place any more."
Jacqui H.,"Atlanta, GA",22,89,200,3.0,2/13/2017,"The menu here is huge!  I also noticed they had a 'skinnylicious' menu which has items with lower calories if you're more health conscious.  It has good atmosphere and the drinks are great too.  I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and got fries instead of rice.  The shrimp had good flavour, not spicy at all but the pepper sauce was tasty. I wasn't too keen on the black beans and marinated pineapple, I guess it didn't really go with the dish.  The burgers and sandwich were tasty too, I didn't try it though.  It was pretty good, food is decent and it's a nice place to catch up with friends.  Good location too.  On this occasion, service was a bit slow but other than that I usually enjoy this place."
Liz P.,"Duluth, GA",141,43,98,4.0,8/11/2017,"Best time to come in is before 6pm to avoid the dinner rush. I had the Louisiana Cajun Pasta which was good. Dinner for four came to $140 before tip, including dessert. I have always had great service at this location and the portions, as you know, are HUGE. Yes it is a chain restaurant but the service at each location makes a difference and distinguishes each one."
Vicki N.,"Duluth, GA",40,195,133,2.0,7/6/2016,"Came here on a Tuesday evening for dinner with my coworkers. The wait was not long at all. Our entire party wasn't there yet, so most of us had to be there to be seated.  Our server seemed quite rude and stand-off-ish. From the moment should spoke to us, she didn't seem so friendly. Weird because we're a friendly group haha. There were little things that bothered us about her, especially her serving etiquette. Our last person came late, and he literally had to stand even though we asked for a chair the moment we sat down. He went to the bathroom and came back, and we still didn't have a chair yet. We ended up having to flag down a hostess to bring us a chair. If you requested anything from her, she would walk away without saying a word. We received our appetizers but no plates, so we had to flag someone else down for plates. Then for dessert, I asked for plates with forks and she gave me just plates.  I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. The portion of steak is very small, but the portion of shrimp and mashed potatoes is plenty. The shrimp scampi is not what I'm accustomed to. I assumed it would be sautéed shrimp in a butter and garlic sauce, but it was breaded shrimp in a creamy sauce. Not a fan.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile, so I remember the slices of cheesecake being humongous, but I guess they're a lot smaller now. Still tastes good though. For appetizers, if you like buffalo chicken, then I highly recommend the Buffalo Blasts. Its shredded buffalo chicken with cheese then deep fried. It's a huge portion! About 6 large triangular pieces served with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce."
Melanie M.,"Chattanooga, TN",82,154,141,4.0,2/25/2017,I've been here several times and it is always crowded for a good reason. Food is great and service for the most part is ok.
Mimi J.,"Foley, AL",0,6,,1.0,11/21/2017,"How disappointing! Horrible service! We were seated for 1/2 hour with no service whatsoever. There were 5 of us waiting. Until I approached the hostess, there was no recognition that we existed.   Then a server came to our table and explained that the shift was changing and we shouldn't have been seated in that section.  We, the customer, just wanted service.  We did not need to know the behind the scenes issues. She, then, stated that even though she was getting ready to leave that she would wait on us if we only wanted coffee and dessert!!!   We ordered coffee and dessert! Again, we waited for 20 minutes-no water, no coffee-nothing. Now we've been sitting for almost an hour with no food or drink. After this wait another server brought our coffee and dessert.  What has happened to this Cheesecake Factory???  The service is now poor and the food is no longer up to par. No need for apologies.  Just needed to share our experience."
