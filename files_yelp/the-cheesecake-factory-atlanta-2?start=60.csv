Katy K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,6,2.0,1/2/2017,"We ordered take out today (Bistro shrimp pasta) and asked for the shrimp to be grilled instead of battered and we asked for broccoli and sun dried tomatoes to be added. When we got home and opened the box we were sad to see that no broccoli was added, instead a few leaves of wilted arugula. When we started eating we quickly lost our appetite after discovering that most of the shrimp were not cleaned properly and some of them had a very strange color, Not burnt but more green-blue, like they were rotten. We threw everything away and now we feel grossed out :-( On the upside, we also ordered the reeses cheesecake and that one is the bomb. However, we will probably never order food (except dessert) from cheesecake factory again. Please cheesecake factory, make your cooks more aware and responsible. These shrimp should have never made it out of the kitchen."
Tiffany Y.,"Marietta, GA",213,239,472,2.0,5/10/2016,"Quite the different experience we had at the Cheesecake factory today.  Can't say I was impressed at all with this location.  You would think with all the competition near by they would be on top of things... but guess not.   Anyway for a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm, there was no wait and my friend and I were sat in a small booth in the back by the windows...  As we were deciding on what we wanted to eat, we noticed flies kept buzzing around our table... I ended up killing one on the window but more kept coming and along the window seal my friend pointed out lots of dead little bugs... Gnats, flies... yeah so I wanted to move immediately... Should've take that as a hint to leave the restaurant completely but we were starving and wanted a quick bite before the movies and The Pub was packed.... should've tried The Cowfish place...  So we move to another table... no bugs near by but they cleared the table we left and reset it like nothing happened... they didn't even clean the window seal after we'd pointed out there were dead bugs on it...  I felt bad for the people they sat at the table right after us... I could still see little flies buzzing around that window...  So we decide on our food and while we wait we munch of the regular ol' bread they bring out... The wheat bread was fine, but the sourdough was odd, so we just picked at it...  It didn't take long for our food to come out and initially everything looked ok but it just went to meh in a hand basket as we started to eat.   I ordered the factory nachos, which I've ordered numerous times before and they came out luke warm with globs and Globs of cheese melted on top... I ate what I could but it turned into a soggy unappetizing mess before I could get a quarter of the way through them.  There was a pool of grease underneath the pile of soggy chips and I just gave up.  I drank my strawberry lemonade and waited for my friend to finish the chicken sandwich she wasn't really happy with.  She said the chicken was falling apart and not in a good way... It was probably reheated from earlier... she said the toppings didn't help it either...   Anyway as we were leaving the restaurant, I told her next time we come back to Perimeter Mall... I wouldn't be suggesting Cheesecake factory at all... Just a bad experience all around and their saving grace was the super nice server we had...  Only saving grace... only.  So many other options to choose from at Perimeter and after today even the foodcourt will be an option before we come back here..."

Gino B.,"Vancouver, Canada",289,186,1770,2.0,6/29/2015,"I can see why the Cheesecake Factory restaurants closed most of their locations in Canada.  Yes, they have divine cheesecakes but aside from that, there is nothing special about this franchise place that was jam Packed with diners. Starting with an extensive thirty plus page menu filled with advertisements and way too many food selections; the decor is old with beige accents; very 1990's... We noticed Everyone, without exception, was leaving with a doggy bag as this is another chain where a huge amount of very average low quality food is served at somewhat ""affordable"" prices.  Our plates were uber-bland, tasteless, super salty and just not good; but they were HUGE portions loaded with unacceptable amounts of sodium and starch  - none of which are worth describing.  I will admit that the presentation on the plates looked great and very appetizing until you start eating; that's when all the built up anticipation disappears! The waiter proudly brought us a branded shopping bag with empty containers to put our hardly touched food leftovers in; no thanks!  Why the one star instead of just a zero grade? Well, the cheesecakes are truly divine and a heavenly indulgence.  There are over 33 of them on the menu! Skip the reading and head over to the refrigerated display to indulge.   I will never dine in this franchise's restaurants again BUT,  will definitely have a cheesecake slice again and again for sure:  just calling it in ahead of time and taking it to go though!!!!"
Corey S.,"Paramount, CA",561,387,356,5.0,10/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is among my favorite restaurants to visit.  This location proved that when I was looking for a place to eat with my friend due to other restaurants in the surrounding area closing around 9:00pm on Sunday night.  As we all know, Cheesecake Factory is known for their large selection of cheesecakes as well as their bible like menu.  The location at Perimeter Mall as well as the outdoor seating is perfect for an intimate setting.  The servers were great and made sure we had a great experience.  So far this location tops my list in Metro Atlanta."
Kai E.,"Atlanta, GA",215,185,503,3.0,10/13/2016,"We dined at this Cheesecake Factory location for my niece's birthday on a Friday night. The hostess was very friendly and surprisingly  there was no wait so our party of 4  was seated immediately out on the patio.   We waited for our waitress for about 15 minutes before she showed up to take our drink orders.  After our waitress  dropped the drinks off and walked away we waited for another 10 minutes for her to come back to take our food orders. I had a Strawberry Daiquiri which lacked flavor and alcohol. Everyone at my table ordered the Ceasar Salad and their Ceasar dressing was flavorless, it tasted like I was eating lettuce with heavy cream on top, the salad was a total fail. Since their portions are typically big enough to feed a family of 4 I opted to just order a appetizer.  I ordered the bang bang salmon wraps which looked delicious from the  description , I assumed bang bang meant spicy but apparently I was wrong, the Salmon was fishy and the flavors did not go well together. The other members at the table seemed ok with their selections with the exception of my one niece who did not like her entrée. Although during most of our dinner, our waitress was not very attentive, she did make every attempt to make sure my niece liked her dish by bringing out sauces and when that failed even though we didn't ask or complain she removed the Uneaten dish from our bill. To top off what started off as a horrible birthday dinner, our waitress brought out a birthday dessert for my niece because she overheard us talking about it. My experience here gave me mixed feelings about the popular chain that usually provides better service. If I ever come back to this location it would only be to get Cheesecake."
Louis P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,1.0,4/10/2017,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  SO BAD, WE LEFT!!   Can I rate them a zero???  We went early afternoon on Saturday, April 8 ... weather was gorgeous, so we sat outside.  It took the waitress at least 15 minutes to finally come to our table for drink orders ... It was not crowded outside ... got my drink fairly quickly, but my wife's never came.  The waitress finally, after maybe 15 more minutes, came to take our food (dinner salads only) orders - never coming back to offer a drink re-fill to me or additional bread.  When our order didn't come after 30 more minutes (about 1 hour total being there ... and, again, it was NOT crowded outside!!), we decided to leave.  I went inside and asked for a manager to tell her we were leaving and I would pay for my drink - and she was as pathetic as our waitress - only said she was sorry - never said something like ""please hold on, let me check to find out what's the problem"".  I then walked outside with her and pointed out our table where my wife was still sitting - she then walked back inside to a computer screen, presumably to see what we had ordered and when.   My wife later told me that while I was inside talking with the manager, the waitress came to our table with a drink re-fill for me and said she'd check on our meals (salads, no less) that had been ordered about 30 minutes prior, and my wife told the waitress that we were leaving and the waitress just said ""ok"", never apologizing or saying she would get a manager.  My wife then walked up and the manager never offered us anything such as a complimentary meal in the future, a take-out of our order for free, or even a dessert to go --- and she never said anything about finding out what had gone wrong - she just said, ""I'm sorry"" - right, that only goes so far. - pitiful customer service.  We've been to this Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall many, many times, and told that to the manager, but that didn't seem to phase her.  We have never walked out of a restaurant due to poor service, but everyone failed here - absolutely the waitress, presumably the kitchen and definitely the manager.  BOTTOM LINE - WE WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE, NEVER! Totally canned BS response from customer service ... and that's why this location is so pathetic and should be avoided"
Abby W.,"Atlanta, GA",72,123,443,4.0,6/13/2016,"My last meal for 2015 was at the Cheesecake Factory! My first meal for 2016 was from? ... Yup you guessed it, Cheesecake Factory! This is because you get such a large portion and yes the food is great. Be it a busy NYE dinner or a regular lunch date, I've always enjoyed good service here. Cheesecake has a $5 happy hour menu that can't be beaten.  They have a select number of specialty cocktails and apps, that's more than enough to keep you satisfied. In addition to this their small plates/snack menu during happy hour ranges from $6-7 with so many choices you can't go wrong.  The menu is only available at the bar area but there is adequate seating. Ironically though, I must confess... I haven't had their cheesecake.... shhh. I'm usually so stuffed that I forfeit dessert. Next time though I'll be sure to grab a slice, promise :) Menu 5/5 Service 4/5 Taste 4/5 Location 5/5"
Paola S.,"Plano, TX",0,19,5,2.0,10/21/2017,"We sat at a table at the bar unseen for a good 10 mins until we asked a girl to be our server! It didnt improve, she provided one of the worst services I've had in a while! Didn't bring the drinks, forgot to bring the food, never checked on us. We could see our second round of drinks in the bar seating there forever until we had to grab someone else and ask for the drinks.... things went on and on... food was delicious service is the worst ...."
Tee D.,"Atlanta, GA",404,41,564,5.0,5/13/2016,Must try the Salted Caramel Cheesecake! It has a blondie brownie base with a thick layer of salty-sweet caramel on top. Magnificent!
Sneha P.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,,2.0,10/18/2017,Literally took 15mins for a to-go order. I don't see the reason for their busy. There's no customer at the counter. Pretty bad service.
Christie M.,"McKinney, TX",6,45,31,2.0,7/19/2017,Dinner was Ok. I was disappointed in a few items. There were 7 of us. Also my 7 year old daughter ordered cheese pizza and the waitress rung up and brought her a full size/full price which I was VERY unhappy with. I had skinilicous lemon crusted shrimp and the shrimp was over cooked there was not enough sauce on the pasta and the green beans were barely cooked (way less than aldente) our waitress was decent but very behind. We constantly had to ask for refills and really did not feel waited on. It was an Ok meal but for $160 I was super disappointed and will not return.
Liv J.,"Duluth, GA",32,68,53,4.0,4/9/2017,"I come here all of the time for their happy hour specials Monday through Friday from 4 p.m-6p.m at the bar, and the tables near the bar. Cheesecake factory has the best hands down appetizers.  I love their corn tamales, chicken buffalo. Yummy.  The drinks are ok. Feels a little water down to me.  The bartender are sweet.  Totally recommend this restaurant to everyone."
Cynthia N.,"Atlanta, GA",480,366,227,3.0,7/30/2016,"I visit Cheesecake Factory when I don't want a surprise in my meal.  It's also a safe bet when meeting picky friends for lunch/dinner because CF has something for everyone.  If a person can't find something to eat at CF, they probably have a personality disorder.  (This makes it a great first date place!) They stopped serving my favorite snack - buffalo chicken meatballs.  They were so delicious and a perfect appetizer size.  I hate that they no longer carry them.  That being said, I console myself with the fresh kale salad and sausage and ricotta flatbread.  My favorite cheesecake is the key lime (... but I also like pumpkin when it's in season.)  I used to avoid CF because their portion sizes were so large but now with their small plate options, it's a much more reasonable place to consider for lunch or dinner.   I'm writing this review because I think people sleep on the good cocktails that are made at CF.  If you work in the area, the CF bar is a great place for happy hour.  The drink sizes are generous, suitably potent and worth their price point.  My favorites are the Mai Tai and J.W.'s Lemonade. You're not drinking a ""crafted cocktail"" but you're drinking a well-made cocktail and that's okay too. I usually sit at the bar here and service is okay.  I don't hate it but I don't love it.  They could be more attentive, but this isn't a five-star restaurant so we have to take what we get. *le sigh* Yelp 100 #46"
Diana P.,"San Diego, CA",333,360,1462,4.0,3/12/2015,"I'm not a big chain restaurant fan.  Had to host a business team dinner and Perimeter was the most convenient area for everyone. We were able to get seated right away at 545 pm for a party of 6.  Well, they wait until 80 percent of your party arrives which I understand.  Booth was a little tight for all of us but it was ok.  Close to door as well as to the bathrooms.   Our server was friendly and quick.  We oder ed 3 appetizers...a academic egg rolls, sweet corn tamale cakes and edamame.  All were excellent and we shared them.  Entrees ranged from bbq chicken salad, chicken parm,  ahi salad, salmon and Sante fe salad.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and of course most had leftovers cause the portions are huge. We didn't have room for dessert but you can't go to cheesecake factory and not have cheesecake so we got a slice of vanilla bean with 6 spoons!  Simple but amazing creamy rich cheesecake.  It may be my favorite now. Great service and good food this visit.  Tons of parking since it's in the mall.  May be my favorite location and I've been to so many in different states."
Katrina Y.,"Duluth, GA",0,5,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Visited this location on 11/22 to celebrate a friend receiving her doctorate degree.  I must say it's an experience we will never forgot.  The service was a bit slow but because we were occupied talking it wasn't a big deal.  We did have to wait long periods of time/or did not receive at all requested additional items such as napkins, salad dressing, etc.  What put the icing on the cake was a ROACH crawled out from under our table.  We made the waiter aware but he was not able to catch him.  The couple across from us (not in our party) alerted us when the again appeared from under the table.  The waiter was made aware and he proceeded to step on him and them pick it up with a napkin.  Not sure if he washed his hands after.  Corporate was e-mailed and we received the computer generated response that someone would contact us within 48 hrs (It's been weeks).  I can only imaging what's crawling around in the kitchen"
Dana G.,"Atlanta, GA",124,1,,5.0,6/26/2017,I love cheesecake in Dunwoody. The management there is the absolute best. All the employees are knowledgeable and the food is Excellent. I would definitely recommend this establish. I am a frequent diner here.
She R.,"Atlanta, GA",1,4,,1.0,3/14/2017,"****Still waiting to hear back from corporate regarding a Dunwoody manager complaint about my food.  We were a party of four with 20 minute wait time for bread & water, & to top it off, my chicken Madeira  was cold when it arrived! Who eats cold chicken, potatoes, and asparagus? I told the manager, as he sped by our table, and first he said, in a very rough voice, ""what would you like me to do? I can reheat it or replace it"". My concern was waiting for another meal. Everyone else would be finished with theirs. I have been there at least 50 times in last 12 years of living here. It's our stop when family visits. Anyway, I was not sure how to respond so I said I'd like a replacement (no dried out meal for me), I'd like it to go, AND complimentary. He said that's not going to happen. He said, ""if I make a new meal, you'll pay for it"". Keep in mind, we've paid thousands over the course of 12 years and with large families visiting, we've had even larger bills. Is that Customer Focused? Addendum-- I have commented twice on your website. I'd like to speak with someone about this. It is more principle than anything else. We have obviously enjoyed this restaurant for many years so it was very disappointing. I have the receipt with server and manager's names on duty at the time."
Asperita R.,"Walterboro, SC",0,6,3,5.0,5/29/2017,There was no wait time! My drinks came right away and so did my food! I've been to other Cheesecake Factory when I go out of town (they sooooo need one in Charleston SC!) and I've never gotten service this quickly! Thanks guys! Obviously you took the time to improve your services after others bad experience and that says a lot!!!
Stiletto C.,"Midway, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"The service was subpar! My son-in-law ordered the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger and there was a piece of hair on his burger. Thank goodness he looked at it prior to taking a bite. My daughter ordered the Shrimp Scampi and it was not good. The shrimp was breaded before being tossed in the scampi making it not ideal for consumption. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi-Steak Diane with mashed potatoes. The Steak Diane was delicious---the only bright spot of the dinner. The potatoes were hard as a rock, lumpy and cold. The men's and ladies' restroom was filthy. It looked like it had not been cleaned for hours. Paper all over the floor and running over out of the trash bins. I was very disappointed in my visit tonight."
