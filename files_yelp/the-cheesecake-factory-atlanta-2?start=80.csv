John E.,"Atlanta, GA",1070,642,7816,3.0,3/14/2016,"You can find this location of the Cheesecake Factory at 4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30346 towards the northeastern corner of Perimeter Mall (far right when facing the main entrance from Ashford Dunwoody Rd). Parking is easiest from the lot to the right in front of Dillards department store and walking across, unless you want to pay the valet but you'll still end up walking a bit so I'd advise you to forego that inconvenience. I have a feeling that most of you have had the experience of the Cheesecake Factory - the first built (and now closed and replaced by a different location) in Buckhead at one time was the highest-grossing restaurant in the US. I believe this location was the second or third built in Atlanta and it's a really fantastic location. The interior has a fantasy array of Byzantine columns, wonderful fantasy-like wall sconces and very feminine fresco-like murals on a warm tan stucco adorning the ceilings - quite nice and it will make you feel a bit like you've entered a Disney theme park restaurant, however much like said-park the experience hardly meets the promise. I've worked in this area of Dunwoody for 15 or so years off-and-on so I've had many occasion to eat at this Cheesecake Factory. It's not a bad place to meet for special occasions as they can accommodate large parties - for my most recent visit I met with many coworkers for a bittersweet occasion - a member of our team was leaving for another work opportunity. When you are seated you'll be presented with a booklet of many, many items and now I'll voice my biggest gripe. The menu is much too large - I mean it's so big that there's advertising on some of the pages - is it a menu, or a catalog? I really don't see how any restaurant can offer so many dishes and hope to do all of them well. The last thing I want to see is a binder full of pages - where do you start? What's good? What's not? Too many choices.  The food here, and I've tried dozens of items, is passable - no real standouts from the many appetizer or entree sections. I honestly can't recommend any one item as something that's your missing or something you can't get elsewhere and I think this is where the restaurant's identity takes a hit. You're sitting in this fantastic setting yet with one exception, the food is pretty humdrum. We'll get to that exception shortly. I do like the basket of bread that they bring out - something about that wheat bread I really like. But then again, don't come here for the bread. When I think about the food here it reminds me a bit of TGI Fridays. Not that they are all that similar, but the food is very formulaic which is both a good and bad thing. It's good in that there's usually some semblance of food balance - starch to fat to acid ratios are good. It's bad in that the combinations are a bit tired - not much magic here. For mall food it's good and certainly better than the food court - of course you're paying more for it as well. Back to the Fridays comparison - I think the food here is better than Friday's as it's less snacky and more of a meal. Satisfying but not awesome. The exception of course are the desserts. I am not a big fan of cheesecake - it tends to sit very heavy with me, but I'll concede that the cheesecakes here are exceptional. I also like the Sunday and the ice cream in general. And maybe that's the point - I mean it is called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" so perhaps everything leading up to the dessert is just the build up to the big finish? But if so, why the phone-book menu? My final point is about the service. I find it very hit-or-miss. I've received both exceptional service and horrible service and it doesn't seem to matter what size the party is - sometimes the service is amazing on a group of 20 and terrible on just two. No rhyme or reason for it. I've had so many orders get screwed up here and it's really unclear if it was the server or the kitchen. I've had tables where everything showed up together except one lost plate and it took 20 minutes for it to appear with everyone either finished or sitting in front of cold plates, to wrong items showing up, to meals with food restrictive (bacon) items showing up with extra (bacon), etc. When service is good the server is usually very attentive and fixes any mistakes quickly. When service is bad you can't find the server and the attitude is really crappy. Like I said, hit-or-miss. So what's my final overall opinion? I think The Cheesecake Factory is exceptional for their desserts. The appetizer and entrees are mediocre but palatable and certainly better than mall food. The service hit-or-miss. Would I eat there again? Sure as it's close and useful for certain situations. Do I find myself wanting to go here? No. On a scale of 1-5, it's a fairly solid 3 due to the desserts.

Joshua C.,"Hiram, GA",2,44,61,3.0,5/6/2017,"As soon I walked in the front desk attendants had a horrible attitude. None of them smiled or even looked up when talking to me. The only thing that saved this visit was the server I had. He was beyond friendly and had great customer service. Maybe, they should take notes of his attitude and apply it to the first thing people have to go too. The food was nothing special that's why I rate this at a 3. Would have been a 2 star but the server saved it. I highly suggest the owner or manager take the time to train his front desk in customer service..!!"
Cherparadise B.,"Marietta, GA",57,8,,2.0,6/26/2016,"Me and my gf visited about 2 weeks ago--and we won't be back!  We usually visited every now and then , but we will just go to the one in Buckhead for now on. We went in to get a to -go order of Shepard's Pie and two slices of cheesecake (no issue with the cake or course). Tony (the manager)  was on the phone while we stood in front of him for at least 3-4 minutes without acknowledging us,  then hung up before even whispering anything to us ; hold on,  hand gesture signaling one moment; Nothing! ..  Fast forward to 20 mintues later when we get home . We open it up and start chowing down,  or attempting to do so.. I notice that all the insides of the meat were pink af! Disgusting!  So.. We called back to the store to inform the manager Tony (guy). He asked ""what do you want me to do? "" in a tone that didnt sit well with us. umm... Fix the issue!!  We asked for the money back and drove back to get our $$$ back.  Just for him to not come out,  he sent another manager out to speak to us.  Then he came around the corner so fast and just sat the money on the counter so quick,  didn't say anything.  Just a half a second to put it down and a half a second to walk away.  That was bullshit! No apology,  no anything.   We won't be back!!   Back to Buckhead we go; where the manager was extremely helpful to us when we had an issue before !"
Whitney A.,"Atlanta, GA",88,2,,2.0,5/15/2017,"Service was AWFUL. We found ourselves looking around for our server several times during our meal. My salad was served without dressing and my sandwich came without the dip. I had to ask for both. Food was good, but worst restaurant service I've had all year. No plans to return! I even spoke with the manager - he apologized and thanked me for the feedback - somewhat halfheartedly, asked where I was seated and that was it. I have no plans on returning."
Nisha P.,"Alpharetta, GA",216,13,13,2.0,3/21/2017,"The waitress, ashley w, was very rude. When we first ordered, she had a very condensing tone. After the food arrived, my friend re-asked for something that she had earlier requested in her order; our waitress walked away mid-request, said one minute,  and sat at a table chatting for 10 minutes. We had to ask another waiter to help us because she was still sitting at the table."
Jamel D.,"Rosedale, NY",0,70,25,4.0,8/28/2016,"This was the first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory and was pleasantly surprised. Had the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was delicious. It was close to the hotel -Le Meridien, so well worth."
Pamela C.,"Atlanta, GA",6,15,,5.0,3/15/2017,"I placed a delivery order (thru DoorDash) for a very large group today. Not only was the entire order perfect (which is rare for our group), but EVERYONE loved their dishes. It's hard to impress large groups. There's always at least one issue or complaint. I had to leave a review to say thank you for such excellent food and service!"
Aaron L.,"Atlanta, GA",44,20,49,4.0,2/26/2016,"I haven't eaten at the Cheesecake Factory in over 5 years. There wasn't anything on their menu I enjoyed eating. Someone told me they have a new ""super food"" menu.  I went there and tried their vegan salad. Have to say it was down right good. They have gained a customer back. I will try their other salads."
Stella L.,"Sandy Springs, GA",21,4,5,4.0,6/24/2016,"We were sitting outside porch.  Server was very friendly and cheesecake was perfect! (i love vanilla bean cheesecake:P) But one problem is!!! there was tree around and porch. cockroch coming from the trees.......  We could see they moving so fast here to there... I know its not cheesecake factory's fault... so I can't blame.. IF you are really cockroch phobia, don't sit outside lol"
Annette T.,"Atlanta, GA",12,1,,1.0,3/25/2017,Food was not hot. Called in the order and the wait was beyond 30 minutes when the estimated time was 20 minutes.  The order was incorrect and the customer service was ridiculous. Disorganized Mess!!!! Definitely not the quality I'm use to receiving at Cheesecake Factory.
Adrianne R.,"Atlanta, GA",924,239,295,2.0,7/20/2015,"I have to say that I was really disappointed with the service that I and my family received this time, Went in to have dinner with my mother inLaw and Sister. Was seated right away but our waitress took a while to come to our table, when she finally came she asked what we would like to have to drink. I ordered a mojito and a water and lemons, my mother ordered a water with SEVERAL LEMONS, my sister ordered the same. She came back with our water and about 5 thinly sliced lemons.  Then asked us if we wanted to order any appetizers which I did, I ordered the buffalo blast and she brought us some bread.  Ok here is where it gets a little rough.....she brought the appetizer and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the Greek salad and my sister was trying to figure out what she had the last time she was there, asked the waitress some questions about the entree and after about 3 mins she placed her order. My mother still had not decided what she wanted so we told the waitress to just put our order in and give my mother a little time. The waitress did not say anything and turned away with an attitude like we bothered her by not being able to place our whole order.  .....ok O_o The waitress comes back in about 10 mins and ask my mother if she was ready and my mother told her that she was ok and would just be full off of the appetizer and bread. Note; my mother is a really fit chick that doesn't really like to eat after 9pm.  So the waitress then tells us she is going to put me and my sisters order in..... What?!  We thought she had done that already when she took our order the first time.  And way after that we sat there for a good 40 mins watching other people that arrived after U.S. Get their food. Our waitress not one time came to check on us or tell us that our food would be coming shortly. So after I seen her walk by U.S. A few times I politely asked her ""ma'am can tell us when our food would be coming""? She said she would go check on it. Please tell me why she came back by our table and totally ignored us? Didn't say your food is taking a little long, didn't say anything! Just walked right by us. I decided to go in and speak with a manager and I told him what happened, he was very nice and asked if we still wanted our food, my mother comes out and I told him to just give us the check for our table because we had waited too long already. He offered to pay for my drink and appetizer and we left. I Looooove The Cheesecake Factory and this will not stop me from going back, I just hope the young lady that served us poorly gets it together.  Other than our service the restaurant is very nice looking."
Michelle J.,"Roswell, GA",0,12,1,4.0,8/18/2017,"I've been to this location in particular several times and although some of the visits have been less than satisfying, overall it's still a great place to go and I will return."
Rachael D.,"Cumming, GA",1,50,1,4.0,7/30/2017,The food is consistent for this chain and service is very consistent as well. Always super busy (as with most Cheesecake Factories) so plan to wait 45+ minutes at dinner time.
Aurelio S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2017,"We were quoted twenty minutes, waited 25 and finally decided to go sit at the high tops by the bar.  I really don't understand why a restaurant would be on a wait when clearly half of the tables are clean and ready to be seated. At this point we have been waiting for 30 minutes and a server finally comes by to tell us that he will be with us in a few minutes. About ten minutes go by he finally makes an appearance to tell us that he's going to get us menus and silverware. We have now been here for over 40 minutes and we still don't have menus! We decided to leave. I can understand if the restaurant was understaffed, but a quick glance around the restaurant you can clearly see servers standing around not doing anything.   There's absolutely no management presence.  No restauranteur would turn down sales by going on a false wait.  Management really needs to open their eyes and be guest focused. There are way too many options out there."
Casey D.,"Sparks, NV",0,21,2,4.0,9/16/2016,We really enjoyed our visit to the Cheesecake Factory. Great food and excellent service!  The egg roll sampler is delicious!
Telicia B.,"Austell, GA",1,20,4,2.0,3/11/2017,The food was just okay. There was nothing special about it. I ordered the fried shrimp with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I didn't even bother taking the mashed potatoes with me. They absolutely had no flavor. The server was horrible. We sat at one of the smaller tables and he never once removed any item once we were finished with it. We literally had a table full of stacked plates in front of us. I will say that the JW Pink Lemonade was awesome.
Ravi B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1427,538,1933,3.0,9/2/2014,"Amazing cheesecake! Been coming here for years. I've had a variety of experiences. Today's experience was one of the best, but I have to remember cheesecake factory is a chain. Now if you're rating just the cheesecake - 5 stars!!! yum! Best cheesecake. If you're rating the service -- today I would give 5 stars also. I have had bad experiences at this location in the past though. Some servers have given attitude when I am not buying 3-course meals and just an appetizer and dessert. The food depends on what I have gotten. It's usually ok, but I always have to remember that this place receives awards for how much sodium is in their food and highest caloric content of chains. I guess it's different to go to a nice restaurant and not know how many calories you're ingesting and to go to a place where their calories are published online :P. But in all seriousness, it's a great place for birthdays, family dinners, celebrations, catch-ups. It's easy to talk. There's music, but its not too loud. They have strong drinks and HUGE portions, and there is a lot of variety in their items! I've had their chicken marsala, peanut butter chicken (forgot name, but similar), one of their fried tuna sushi appetizers (Best i've ever had), and a couple of other things in the past. =)"
Teresa L.,"Sisters, OR",211,624,31,4.0,6/12/2015,"Until today, I had only visited this restaurant since around 1995.  I recall enjoying my meal, but I didn't love the overcrowded atmosphere.  I only visited this restaurant today because it was my mother's birthday and she loves the place.  Our party of four was promptly seated and our drink orders were taken immediately.  Service was perfect. I am very picky about the way salmon is cooked, but my miso salmon was cooked to perfection. It was served with about 8 snow peas, rice and a sauce.  I'm pretty sure that it was the healthiest thing on the menu.  The salads are not healthy.  One person in our party ordered a chicken salad.  It was huge and included fried onion rings and tons of cheese.  My elderly mother and her friend had the appetizer chicken fingers with potatoes and they loved them.  Their dishes were so huge that they had leftovers. I have two problems with this restaurant.  First, the dishes are so huge that they are unappetizing to me. The second problem I have is with the size of the bathrooms.  There are three small stalls and a very small standing area in a restaurant that is large enough to probably seat 500 to 1,000 people."
Derek G.,"Decatur, GA",0,64,78,2.0,2/25/2017,"We ordered hamburgers and they were pretty good--but honestly not as good as we remember from previous experiences.  Unfortunately, our server was not very attentive (no refills on our drinks the whole time we were there; also, we arrived just after the restaurant opened, so it was not busy).  We were served none of the usual ""free bread"" (we saw other diners get served their free bread).  We have had better experiences at this location in the past so we were disappointed today.  The cheesecake we got (to go) after we ate was excellent, though, so it went some way to make up for the dining experience."
Rosegret H.,"Kärnten, Austria",1,16,2,5.0,8/27/2016,"Excellent food and awesome cheesecakes! I'm really picky with cheesecakes and to be honest, I thought mine was the best but I tries the Mango Key Lime yesterday and it was yummie! If you go there for lunch or dinner and want to eat the cake as a dessert you should just order a side dish or an appetizer for the main course, because the sizes are a gigantic! Love it! Thumbs up!"
