Paula P.,"Madison, AL",2,34,14,5.0,11/20/2017,We always have great service. Food is yummy and desserts are heaven.  Their Lemon Drop martinis are SO good!! :)
Tahesha G.,"Tampa, FL",14,183,635,1.0,11/11/2017,"So I had someone pick up a carryout order for me this evening.  The person made another stop also, so when I saw how big the bags were, I just thought they put a bag from the other store inside one of the Cheesecake Factory bags.  Well, turns out included in my bag and charged me for someone else's dessert order (2 pieces of cake for $19). I called and asked to speak to the manager and he actually said that it was my person's fault for not looking at the receipt and then asked if I would come back out at almost 9pm on a cold evening to bring the items back.  I did tell him that the desert had not been touched (I called as soon as I noticed that it was in the bag) and that they could send someone to the hotel across the street to pick it up.  The manager was very snippy about their mistake and refunding the card.  He only offered to take care of it after I said that I would call corporate and get my refund from them. This was my third bad experience at this location in the last few months. As much as I love their pumpkin cheesecake, I'll have to get it elsewhere.  I will not be returning to this restaurant until they train their managers on soft skills and get a better process for checking orders."
Joy B.,"Atlanta, GA",1,35,33,2.0,10/1/2017,"Update: I visited The Cheesecake Factory for lunch and the service was horrible. I'd never seen it so disorganized and a server that was so uninterested in serving the diners. He was dry from the moment I arrived and ended the visit by not speaking to me. It was very unprofessional. He would take forever to come to the table and when he did I asked for condiments. He responded by saying ""Is that it?"" And proceeded to walk away. About 10 minutes later when he returned he didn't have everything. I was growing impatient. So I asked for a Caesar Salad Togo because I never got the condiments I'd asked for. He said he would bring me a Togo box. Everyone knows you can't take a salad with dressing on it to go. It withers. I asked the manager as she was visiting the table next to me about the salad. Side note: They were on their second steak that was prepared incorrectly. The next time I saw the server he just dropped my Togo salad and ticket on the table. He didn't speak. He just walked off with his head turned away from me. For a $20 sandwich and salad, they need to hire more carefully.  Also, my table (or the neighboring tables) was never cleaned off. My drink was empty. I went through 3 sets of silverware to get a clean fork and knife.  Previous rating: 4 I visited this location multiple times. The good thing about it is that the food is pretty consistent. The bad part is the menu is so big and diverse and can be hard to decide. The large menu probably contributes to the taste of the food. They don't have a good specialty. So some items can be extremely bland for the price. I have a couple of items I eat every time I visit and those are great. I LOVE THE CLUB and CEASAR SALAD. It's great. They also had a shrimp club and crab cake sandwich that were delicious. They also have good drinks at the bar.  The service is good (dine-in and take-out). There can be a long wait and parking can be an issue depending on the day/time. I personally just park in the mall parking deck and walk through the mall to the restaurant. They could step up cleanliness. I've sat at tables with crumbs or received bread plates with crumbs. Overall, I would recommend this location, just know what you want before you arrive and stay away from the bland pasta."
Antwynette R.,"East Point, GA",9,91,189,4.0,12/13/2017,"Came on a day it snowed, so service was excellent and food was hot and fresh since it was practically empty. Ordered lunch portions of chicken riesling pasta and shrimp & sausage pasta. Portions were generous, especially the chicken reisling pasta. I think they may have mistakenly given me the dinner portion. Too many menu options, so it's difficult to choose what you want."
Kia S.,"Douglasville, GA",96,9,,4.0,1/5/2018,"I don't come here for the food, just the cheesecake. The food is just mediocre, but the cheesecake is fantastic. It's rich and decadent and well worth the price tag if you consider the fact that you can easily split one slice in half and have enough dessert for two meals. The staff is nice enough. The cheesecake is just as consistently good as at their other chain locations. Even during peak hours, they get you in and out pretty quickly, which is nice. I'd give it 5 stars if the food were actually great, but it's just a mediocre stomach filler. I've never WANTED any food from here. Just the cheesecake that the place is named for."
Jim P.,"Macon, GA",1,67,16,2.0,11/1/2017,"Three of my co-workers and I had lunch here today. The food was pretty good but service was terrible. The server took more than 15 minutes bring drink order and it was not correct. We waited over 50 minutes on our food order to arrive after ordering. It was simple order of hamburgers and salad. I suggest you have plenty of time if you want to eat here. We were there for lunch and like most working people, we have a limited time away from our job. I'm curious if the Cheesecake Factory gives their employees two hours for lunch?"
Susan K.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,144,339,4.0,7/19/2017,"As you know this is a chain restaurant, but it is still one of my favorites!  With a multi-page menu there is sure to be something for everyone in your group, no matter what the size.  Everything I've tried, from appetizers to dessert, has been just delicious. Even the food on the children's menu was very good. :)   No matter what you order, I recommend saving room for cheesecake.  With over 30 choices there is definitely something here for everyone's taste!"
Tonya L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,110,21,1.0,1/1/2018,"Came in to use a gift card, otherwise we would have never eaten there. Service was slow, tables dirty. Definitely understaffed. Dishes and silverware were so dirty that we went to the to go counter and got plastic ware. We were there for over two hours. My son had ordered a coffee and while drinking it had a noodle in his mouth from the coffee. So nasty. This place is nasty!"
Shon I.,"Mableton, GA",56,120,227,4.0,5/24/2017,"I must say that I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory. I almost vowed to never go back as it brings back memories of a time when I had bad morning sickness but I've managed to survive. Nonetheless, I can't say I've had anything really bad. My favorite are the raspberry lemon cheesecake and the monte cristo."
Ashley S.,"Panama City Beach, FL",147,8,,1.0,1/6/2018,"This is my favorite place to eat but there's never been one near me so we always have to drive pretty far to get to one. My sister in law is in town so we decided to drive over and the experience was mostly terrible. The food took forever, they got our order wrong, we ordered the Chicken Romano and it had the wrong sauce on it so they offered to replace it, which was nice but it took another 25 minutes for them to replace our food and the manager was extremely rude about it. The ONLY saving grace for this particular Cheesecake was our waitress Leni Andro, she was amazing!! She was apologetic, very sweet, and she personally paid for a mistake the kitchen made at another table, out of her own pocket. This girl loves her job and Cheesecake is lucky to have her, especially this branch! She could teach the manager a thing or two."
Mykel R.,"Fayetteville, GA",238,105,36,2.0,9/7/2017,"Ok what's going on at the Cheesecake Factory, with regards to the cheesecake? To be a little  more specific what's the deal with these smaller cheesecake slices? I ran in last night after leaving Costco to satisfy my sweet tooth and noticed when I got home the slice was Smaller than usual, and remembered a  couple of my coworkers commented on that recently. They were giving you slices that you  could share with someone or finish later. What's  up with that??? Listen for $8 a slice you guys better get it right. I may have to start going over to cafe intermezzo."
Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516,5.0,10/7/2017,This place is quick! We got out food before we even finished eating our bread. Granted we ordered our food with our drinks but I was still impressed. The food was fantastic!!! Hubby and I ended up splitting our favorite meal so we wouldn't have leftovers to worry about going bad on the long drive home and we were both pretty full from it. I could have totally eaten so much more because it was so addicting but this worked out well! I would totally come back here!
Kisha W.,"Atlanta, GA",8,54,128,5.0,6/19/2017,"My review is solely based on my visiting this location for takeout. I try not to come on the weekend because the parking lot is jammed packed to the brim! Luckily the restaurant has three parking spots in the front for guests who are solely there for takeout. Look carefully and you can spot them. When inside, the restaurant is huge! The takeout line usually goes very fast especially if you are in a rush. I always get the ultimate red velvet cheesecake and it is THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED! It is about $8 for a slice but it is definitely worth every penny! It is very rich and cannot be eaten in one sitting. I will definitely keep coming back for my fix. The staff there is always nice and the restaurant itself is very elaborate yet intimate."
Nancy J.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,7,,3.0,12/13/2017,"First, the food is awesome! And you can't go wrong with the cheesecake- every flavor is delicious. Kudos to the chef/bakers! Second, the service has been constantly sub-par. Typically see the server once for drink order, and once to bring the check. Some seem to have an attitude problem, but some of the customers they had at the same time seemed to be a bit difficult, so maybe it wasn't entirely intentional. Come for the oreo cheesecake Will probably be getting it to go"
Kris L.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,8,3,5.0,10/7/2017,Came In On A Late Saturday Evening. No Reservation But Got Seated Very Quickly. Our Server Autumn Was Very Pleasant And Very Attentive To Our Needs ! Great Demeanor. I Had The Bang Bang Shrimp And Chicken Very Tasteful ! My Girlfriend Had The Chicken And Shrimp Gumbo Also Good. Just Maybe A Tad Bit More Flavor And A Plethora Of Cheesecakes . Amazing Night with An Good Server . Ask For Autumn
Keysha P.,"Jonesboro, GA",7,69,205,1.0,3/25/2017,"Lackluster!!!  Unfriendly staff behind the bakery counter, small expensive ($7.95) cheesecake slices.  DONT RIP THE CUSTOMERS OFF.....If you are going to charge almost $8 for a slice of cheesecake they should be cut bigger.  The next time that I want cheesecake I will go to the best and order one from Juniors in NYC and let them ship it to Georgia. Let me say this, Juniors Restaurant has been standing in Brooklyn since the 1800's, Carnegie deli and Katz deli standing in Manhattan for a long time too.  Nobody beats any of these spots for authentic NYC style cheesecake....melt in your mouth delicious!  And even they don't charge $55 for a whole cheesecake.  And did I forget to mention that the Cheesecake Factory is  pulling the cheesecake out of the freezer and telling you that you have to wait 2 hours for it to thaw out so you can eat it????  Could understand them freezing it if they were shipping it to someone but not when it's being sold in the restaurant. Paid $26.95 for a raspberry truffle, white chocolate Cheesecake factory cheesecake.....opened the box when we got home and cannot figure out what we paid $26.95 for.  While it taste pretty good, it's  not good enough to justify the price.  At these inflated prices I don't want a frozen cheesecake.....It should be fresh!"
LaTyess H.,"Morrow, GA",25,70,176,2.0,3/27/2017,"This cheesecake factory is beyond ghetto. I called in my order and after having to call 10 times someone finally answered the phone. I placed my order than I was advised that there were no more shrimp so I changed my order and was told what time to pick it up. Once I got there to pick my food up no one acknowledged me at all. I had to wave a lady down to get someone to help me. As I waited for someone to bring my food up I had to hear the employees curse back and forth at each other being extremely disrespectful to all the customers in line. Once someone finally did bring my food out everything was missing!! When I realized that, I told the lady that was ringing me up that some things were missing she caught like the worst attitude because she had to go find the rest of my order... Never again. Pro: Resturant is in a great location right by the mall. Cons: Too many"
Amanda H.,"Atlanta, GA",273,60,184,4.0,2/6/2017,The Cheesecake Factory has an impressively large menu which makes it easy for everyone to find something they like. They have really good gluten free options and lunch vs. dinner portions if you are looking for smaller meals. I also recently had Sunday brunch there for the first time and was pleased with their breakfast options.
Candace H.,"Fairburn, GA",157,261,782,3.0,1/7/2017,Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice for drinks and food because the menu is so extensive. There is literally something on the menu for everybody and it continues to grow every time that I go. I wouldn't say that the food is great but the portions are a nice size and it is appetizing.
Gerald E.,"Atlanta, GA",1219,245,497,4.0,12/21/2016,"This has to be one of the most popular chain of restaurants in America...on a mid-range tier...not your run of the mill Applebees or Ruby Tuesday's. Not knocking them but The Cheesecake Factory is the on the next level. I've been here and many locations of the chain but never reviewed any of them. So with today's lunch being sponsored by my company, I thought I would share my indulgence.  I am tracking my calories so I am so glad they have the Skinnylicious menu. It offers a ton of items that are still tasty but the calories are cut and listed. Compare this to the regular book menu the restaurant offers. I'm pretty sure a dish averages 15,000 calories overall, and that's being generous. I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp with angel hair pasta. I never really eat pasta dishes because it is so high in fat and calories but this was a great chance to take advantage. I had about 6 large shrimp in my dish with a red and green sauce. It was good to taste.  I also had a few tortilla chips dipped in spinach and artichoke. It was kinda of bland to taste but I preferred that to salty. Of course the hot bread was delivered. Our service was pretty solid. Brandy started not to check on as much towards the end but her and other staff members kept our water glasses full. I think I took 2 sips and put my glass down and she was refilling. No complaints from me.  How could I leave without trying a piece of cheesecake. My boss recommended the Mango Key Lime Coconut in which I had a 1/4 of it. Wow, it was rich. I don't think coconut is mentioned in the name of the cake so it was a bit of a surprise. The consistency was so thick and rich it seemed like a sherbet or ice cream with graham cracker crust. I want another piece."
John P.,"Acworth, GA",210,10,2,4.0,11/15/2017,"This is probably one of my favorite places in the Atlanta area. The food is priced well and food quality is worth it anyway. The waiting staff is very kind/enjoyable to interact with, and are always willing to help. The restaurant atmosphere is very beautiful and it's a great place for groups or for a date night. Also it's named appropriately, the cheesecake is really what keeps me coming back lets be honest."
Tony H.,"Chattanooga, TN",48,494,255,3.0,1/12/2017,"This is a chain restaurant found mostly in or around malls. The menu is extensive, a little too extensive, and the food is just okay. I would put it in the same class as Chili's, Applebee's, etc. Most people that come here know what they are walking into. I thought it was decent not great (okay, the crab cake appetizers were great). The service was good, pleasant and efficient. I had a tortilla salad that was huge but not that delicious.  The portions are huge and you could probably share any entree."
Dave Y.,"Enterprise, AL",0,48,9,2.0,9/3/2017,"We've enjoyed better meals at other Cheesecake Factory locations in other cities. This one was only ok. Granted, we were seated rather quickly (less than 15 minutes), and our waitress was professional and polite. However, the service was SLOW. We only ordered appetizers, salad, and a child's plate of pasta and had to wait upwards of an hour. When the food arrived, my daughter's pasta was room temperature and undercooked.  My salad did not show up until well after all other food was delivered.   Then there is the issue of climate control. You can hang meat in this place. Absolutely FREEZING. My wife shivered near me for the entire meal. We appreciate a cool atmosphere, but not sub-arctic. Ladies:  if you attend this venue in summer clothing, be sure to bring a shawl or jacket.    Oh, the air ventilation ducts drop water too. On guests while they dine.    Will not return to this CF venue again."
Dan D.,"Tucson, AZ",20,83,33,5.0,6/16/2017,"I came here from Arizona. And despite having a Cheesecake Factory 20 miles from my house, I decided instead to travel 2,000 miles to try it for the first time.  I might have make that shorter trek sooner or later. Ordered mini crab cakes, Chicken Riesling, a slice of Cheesecake, soda, and a Gin & Tonic. This entire thing, tip included, came out to about 45 dollars. Normal folks who don't need all of that will naturally pay less. The drink came in a rather large glass, far bigger than most places I've been to. I ordered a Hendricks & Tonic, which is a more premium Gin, but I was surprised that given the size of the drink it was only around 9 dollars. I had honestly expected it to be more.  The crab cakes weren't bad, but slightly burnt. Without prompting, inquiry, or concern for this though, the chef had another order of crab cakes brought out to me pre-empting any concern. While I didn't take it, that is... actually a hell of a thing to do. Even when a touch burnt and not completely uniform in size, it was pretty solid.  The Chicken Riesling is a mix of chicken, bacon, onions, and a creamy sauce with pasta. To me, that hits basically all my happy notes. I don't know if it does for you.  Their cheesecake is also pretty solid, and the Sour Cream top works well for it, although I'm not really a huge sour cream fan. I would probably have given this four stars, but the fifth star comes from the chef caring enough to actually pre-empt any concern of mine and deliver another appetizer that didn't meet their own standard. Hopefully this is the level of concern that this location maintains for every order that goes out, because that was pretty above and beyond the call of duty."
Ashley A.,"Atlanta, GA",17,121,119,2.0,7/23/2017,"This place is so slow it's ridiculous. After today's visit I am not coming back. Took 40 minutes to receive our app - tamale cakes, and our drinks were perpetually empty. Our meals took 20 more minutes after apps were dropped. We asked for the dessert menu when the meals were dropped off because of how long everything took. But our server only returned after we were long finished, roughly 15 - 20 minutes after finishing. Good thing there wasn't anything wrong with our meals, besides being mediocre. We ordered a cheesecake togo, and it took 20 minutes!  We were there almost two hours. 'Ain't nobody got time for dat!' I think I'm actually gray from the wait now. Never again."
Laila T.,"San Diego, CA",42,115,104,3.0,10/4/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so the food is consistent.  I did find it odd that my food was missing one of the main ingredients, mushrooms.  I thought I had the wrong dish.   My waitress was very nice, but the service was very slow. At 10pm with a mostly empty restaurant, she had no excuse."
Felicia T.,"Atlanta, GA",115,8,,5.0,7/31/2017,"My daughter and I visited the Cheesecake Factory this evening and I made the worst mistake ever.  I ordered the wrong entree.  I get the same thing every time (The Farfalle pasta). For some reason I accidentally ordered the chicken Marsala with mushrooms, which I've had before but didn't particularly care for it.  I  ordered one for my daughter and one for me. Once the food arrived I immediately realized the mistake.  I apologized to the waitteress and she said it wasn't a problem and she would call the manager over and replace it with the one I wanted. She was very nice about the situation.  I hate that I forgot her name.   Once the manager came over he wasn't very happy at all and I could tell that he was irritated ( I forgot his name). Once he displayed his frustration I was no longer interested in having my meal replaced.  As I was preparing to pay for the drinks and appetizer the waitress comes back and I tell her we are just gonna skip dinner because the manager wasn't happy and I wasn't comfortable ordering another dish. She told me that she would get the general manager.  His name is Alex.  OMG ALEX...he came over tapped me on the back of my hand and told me shame on me in a very playful manner lol.  He was very friendly nice and understanding.  He said that it was no problem and I felt comfortable ordering our dishes.  Not only was ALEX a sweetheart, he was also very handsome.  IJS.  Thank you Alex you were awesome and you rock.  I appreciate you."
Jesse F.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,18,28,1.0,2/11/2017,"Is there a restaurant where the people frown and hate their jobs more than here? Maybe the underachieving Corner Taquería in Smyrna, but I'm hard-pressed to think of any others.  It's depressing.  Lots of potential in a great location.  The food is OK. Try this:  order carry out, walk to the pick up section in the back, and see how many people  walk right by you avoiding eye contact , and see how long you can go without anyone asking how they could help, if you have been helped, etc.  The only way to get your order is to literally wave your hand and desperately try to make eye contact with someone, and then when you ask who can help with your to go order, they often shrug and say, ""some lady does that stuff, but I have no idea what her name is.""   Even the so-called managers look visibly stressed and see you as someone who is just making them work harder. They are EXPERTS at avoiding eye contact and ignoring guests.  I can sense tension in the team, the coworkers don't like one another, and disdain their managers.   And it reflects in how they treat their customers.  Ultimately disrespectful for an establishment that is in the business of serving people.   No one knows who does what, no on takes ownership, and absolutely no one cares about customers when you walk in as a carry out guest. I hope Cheesecake learns to maximize their potential and step their game up.  And it starts with the people."
Ashlye B.,"Lithonia, GA",84,55,430,4.0,7/4/2016,"This is the perfect spot for go to food at the bar. You already know what to expect from the CCF. On this occasion I had the Philly Cheesesteak and my favorite cocktail(lemon drop martini).!My friend got the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious. This location at Cumberland Mall is pretty busy at 10:30 pm. Lots of meet and greets or pop ups coming through. I wanted to Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake but I was too full after my sandwich. The waitress was pretty attentive even on a Sunday late night. So long story short, great atmosphere and great food!!!!"
Candice C.,"Austell, GA",142,73,143,4.0,3/2/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always one of my favorite restaurants. Typically always back and a tourist and local favorite. This particular one is located/attached to the Cumberland Shopping Mall along with other restaurants. Parking is found in the lots surrounding the mall or the valet service. Every time I have came here it takes a while to find an open space; however if you are getting your food to-go there is one to two spaces to park at for 15mins to pick up your food. The wait time can rage between 15 mins and 45mins, just depends on day and time. Weekends are extremely pack and during the week not so much. The bar area is available as well for faster seating but once again it tend to be filled up. My favorite appetizer that I highly recommend is the fried macaroni and cheese balls---delicious and needed before the meal. My whole family loves them since I introduced them to it. I tend to order the shrimp and chicken gumbo paired with brown rice and maybe a daiquiri. The presentation of this dish is beautiful and the flavors and  taste just the same if not better. I highly recommend this dish and it will fill you up with leftovers to take home as well. If possible please leave room for dessert or take it to-go. I cannot visit any location without ordering one of the cheesecakes. I have personally tried and loved the following kinds: Red velvet, Original Strawberry, Chocolate lover, and Oreo. My all time favorite and pick is the red velvet. The city and area of Atlanta have so many restaurant choices when I can't decide The Cheesecake Factory is my go to place."
Judy R.,"Atlanta, GA",9,92,12,5.0,11/16/2017,The best one in Atlanta very clean good fresh food don't go to perimerter mall it's dirty and bad service no comparison Cumberland is the best we eat out quite a lot hope it stays good
Cynthia H.,"New York, NY",15,29,9,3.0,8/5/2017,Food was good today but honestly it wasn't hot. Showed it had been setting before ever coming out. Had to ask for Parmesan. It was a pasta dish. Drinks were slow to be refilled....nothing was done quickly tho our waitress seemed to always be in a hurry. Very slow service...were there for 2 hours. It wasn't for us just sitting and talking.
Dearld S.,"Dallas, GA",1,7,,4.0,7/16/2017,"Today, my wife and I tried a new appetizer ""crab bites"" they were ""insanely delicious"" ...we thought since they were so small they would have more bread than lump crab but were we wrong. The chipotle sauce was amazing and complimented the bites extremely well. If you have never tried them I would strongly recommend you do so.  Tasty bites comes in small portions!"
Rhea T.,"Atlanta, GA",83,207,593,4.0,6/4/2016,"My family and I love the Cheesecake Factory! We usually frequent this location because it's the closest one to us. Like all Cheesecake Factory, be prepared to wait. The wait is always long and they do not take reservations.  The food here are delicious! We've tried many items here from their pork chops, meat loaf, pizzas, burgers, pastas, steaks etc. They have a huge menu! My favorite here is probably the blackened Jamaican shrimp and their kale salad. But really they have a lot of good menu items here. It's one of my family's favorite restaurant chain.  Almost forgot, they have all kinds of flavors of cheesecake. I'm not a big fan of sweets but I do try a bite whenever my hubby or boys order one and they're delicious!"
Andra F.,"Powder Springs, GA",27,37,2,2.0,2/12/2017,"If you go to this place after 4pm on a Saturday, be prepare to wait an hour - 2 hours.  I've going to this location for years with my wife and child, and I will say this was the worst experience I've had.  The crowd has grown over the years and this seems to have affect their customer service.  The lady at the front counter came no where close to spelling my last name ""Fleming"" when were checking in for our 1 hour 45 min wait time.  So when our buzzer went off we were to told to stand off to the side and they will call our name.  The guy looked at the piece of paper that was printed out with our name on it.  He hesitated and yelled out something no where near ""Fleming"" and my wife approached him and said ""don't you mean 'Fleming'""?  He laughed, shook his head and apologize and seated us. I hate sitting next to big parties and that's where we ended.  It seems like this place brings out  all the less desirable people who want to loud and need to be seen.  An that's who we were seated next to.  The waitress was pleasant.  They have cut back on the brown bread.  I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  They cut back on portions, but that's not a big deal.  I began eating and it didn't taste the same.  I further inspected and found just about all of the cashews were burnt, not charred or roasted, but burnt.  If you saw them you think they were black beans.  I told the waitress, she looked and them and apologized.  I told her I wanted to send it back and didn't want anything else. The manager came over so he could ""verify"" the cashews were burnt.  They took it off my bill. You know the quality of service and personnel is very low. When you have the audacity to send out food that is clearly burned, you have failed your company.  There was a lot of confusion going on as well.  After we had our food, different wait staff members came to our table with food asking who order what.  We simply told them we already had out food.  They were all over the place taking food to the wrong table and it became annoying.  I was ready to go when this lady who was part of the large party actually asked the waitress ""how should I mix my salad""?  The waitress told her to take her 2 forks and toss it / mix it together.  I told my wife it will be a while before I eat here again.  The Cheesecake Factory is nothing more than an over sized Applebee's."
Nate C.,"Atlanta, GA",318,251,771,5.0,11/9/2015,"The experience here was short and sweet. Long story short visit the bar. Met the bar tender Drew! Amazing conversation and service. He suggested the meal. The meal was pressured to my satisfaction. He suggested a wine, the wine was perfect. We chatted as the bar area got crowded. And then I became dust in the wind! It was precise and worth doing again. I plan on coming here as often as my palate desires! Nate C"
Phoenix A.,"Atlanta, GA",276,4,3,3.0,8/11/2017,"This isn't one of their best nights for service, cleanliness, and taste.  I'm disappointed for the amount that they charge. Normally everything is good but not tonight."
Michael J.,"McDonough, GA",0,56,13,5.0,4/8/2017,Absolutely love this place.  On way to concert and this was bonus.  Stacy too care of us and she was simply wonderful.   As always a long wait but worth it.  Great food great service.
Kris J.,"Atlanta, GA",5,227,333,4.0,12/31/2016,Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite chain restaurant - mid price range. We always gets either the avocado egg roll or chicken egg rolls to share. Both awesome. The dinner portions are enough for 2 people to share. Huge portions! I love the Louisiana chicken pasta. Comes with crispy breaded chicken. So good. Macadamia nut cheesecake is my fav too.
Christina K.,"Atlanta, GA",6,25,26,1.0,7/13/2017,"I ordered a veggie burger and added avocado. The burger was over $15! They forgot to add avocado and didn't add onions. In addition, the burger was cold. Tasted like it has been sitting in the fridge all day. Also, they gave me only a few fries.  In addition, the staff behind the bakery counter are so rude at this location! She didn't greet me and acted like it was a burden to go to the kitchen and add avocado that I paid for.  For such a high price, I expect quality food and reasonable potions with friendly staff."
