Jasmine L.,"Lithia Springs, GA",177,11,14,4.0,1/9/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat when I am at home. I always get the herb crusted salmon is always delicious. Or if you can't decided on what you like they have a combination plate with some of their best dishes. The drinks are also great as well. This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory out of all of them in Georgia
Joe S.,"Marietta, GA",0,11,,1.0,3/11/2016,Your microwave could cook the food they serve. The wait staff is so lazy you can see how painfully slow they move if you just look up. This place is not worth your time or hard earned money.
Kayla K.,"Smyrna, GA",110,28,3,5.0,2/9/2015,"The ambiance at this location is wonderful. The food is delicious and I especially recommend the Chicken Madeira (similar to chicken Marsala but better!) and their Louisiana pasta dish. However, my main reason for writing this review is due to the EXCELLENT service we received the other night. Drew was our server and he was probably one of the best servers I've seen in a while. He was so attentive to all his tables and engaged in friendly conversation with everyone. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us some great recommendations. I noticed that he had a lot of tables and most of them were around the same stage of dining so he was constantly running around but not once did he ever seen stressed or flustered. I was so impressed. We will definitely ask for him from here on out!"
Ms R.,"Madison, AL",3,30,8,1.0,1/4/2015,"I haven't ate at the TCF in many years, 10 years to be exact. I didn't like it then and nothing has changed now. We dined at TCF ON 1/3/15 at the Cumberland location...waited 45 minutes, which was expected. Our drinks the Typhoon Punch and Margarita were good. We ordered Rib-eye steaks for entree's extremely mediocre. I've had better steaks at Applebee's for a fraction of the cost, too pricey to be so mediocre. Save your money....you are paying for the name ""The Cheesecake Factory"" if you decide to dine here drinks & desserts only."
Eric S.,"Mableton, GA",1,23,2,1.0,1/19/2015,"I have been here three times over the last 12 months and every time, it has taken the kitchen FOREVER to get our food out to us! And then when the food comes out, the quality isn't great. We have a  much better experience at the Perimeter location. I have addressed my issue with the manager on duty, and he did nothing but make excuses."
A. P.,"Douglasville, GA",0,6,1,2.0,2/21/2016,"Ok so this is an update of my original review. My first time going to Cheesecake Factory was not so great so my hubby and I went back for Valentines Day and this time we took the kids. We had to wait 2 hours for a table which we were ok with.  Our problem was the food...again. This time I ordered the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and it was just ok. It was very bland and I kept complaining to my husband that I didn't taste or even see any chunks of garlic. Anything with the name scampi you assume would have a very garlicy taste. It came with 6 nice sized shrimp, a small portion of pasta and a small slather of sauce for almost $20.  My son had the kids spaghetti and meatball (yes one meatball not big enough to suffice) and was served 3 times more pasta than what I had on my plate with even less sauce. It was very dry and also very bland and he didn't want to eat it so I gave him my plate and I ate his...ugh is all I can say to describe the taste.  My other son had the kids chicken quesadilla and loved it, although you really can't much mess up a quesadilla.  My daughter had the kids sliders which she didn't like, but love the mixed fruit she ordered with it.  My oldest son and his friend ordered the kids chicken tenders which turned out to be more the size of nuggets. They liked them but not the fries.  My husband had the chicken alfredo which he liked but said there was nothing extravagant about for $20. My homemade seafood alfredo is better.  No one liked the sweet tea but my ultimate margarita was nice. All in all we won't be wasting any more money at the Cheesecake Factory. The food is far too expensive to be so subpar."
Adrienne l.,"Smyrna, GA",16,46,,5.0,4/1/2015,"Excellent as always...lovely outside patio...What made it special was the service that we received from PJ Caldwell and Anthony Lopez.   The are vibrant, know the menu and an attribute to the restaurant.     Will go back and ask for their stations for each and every visit.   Outstanding."
Marie M.,"Atlanta, GA",204,214,37,2.0,11/27/2012,"I will start by saying that I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. But this location is very dissapointing. When we first got there, they greeted us just fine but when we got to the booth that we were supposes to seat at the hostess all of a sudden said that she had to check because they had told her that it might be taken. So, we stood there while she went back to the hostess desk to check and then she moved us to another table. Our server; well, we never learned his name. He never provided it. The drinks took forever and it was only water and one margarita. The plate that they brought my 3 yr old's pizza in was SO hot that the runner felt bad and went back to get another plate to switch the pizza. They didn't have any kind of crayons or anything for kids. The food itself was bland. I was looking forward to a great experience and I left feeling completel underwhelmed."
Kevin W.,"Euless, TX",691,570,464,3.0,12/21/2012,I do not think this place will ever be more than average to me. This was one of the last places open near my house late at night. I came in and got immediate service at the bar. I ordered the dynamite shrimp and fish tacos. The shrimp was great. The tacos were horrible. The tortillas tasted like gritty paper. The fish was ok.
Aprince G.,"Marietta, GA",3,31,9,3.0,11/25/2014,"Wow! Cheesecake Factory you no longer have spaghetti with meat sauce? What's up with that? I'm going to try the spaghetti & meatballs with angel hair pasta and give my opinion. Well, not as good as my spaghetti with meat sauce and angel hair pasta....."
Steve B.,"Atlanta, GA",12,777,203,4.0,1/6/2013,"The cheesecake factory and I have a good relationship over the years.  I really come here more often on a drive by tip to get a fix of a few selected cheesecake slices on a take out mission.  Cheesecake factory works wonders when it comes to that.  Oh, the cheesecakes as many of you know are banging.  Sometimes it's testing your patience on weekend parking if you want to tolerate the traffic at the Cumberland mall.  If you choose to dine in, they have a gang of items on the menu.  I think the Cheesecake factory menu may be top 5 in NW Atlanta as far as depth on the menu from seafood, pasta, burgers, etc.  My favorite is their cajun jambalaya pasta.  I seem not to always go for that when I come here.  It is one of their favorites advertised.  The service is cool.  The energy and atmosphere is pretty good as well with versatility of the crowd.  Love the Buffalo meat appetizers as well with slammin flavored lemonade.  All cool with me.  Grade: B"
Gabby G.,"Acworth, GA",2,132,118,3.0,8/23/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Cumberland Mall to enjoy our anniversary lunch date while our kids were in school. We always get good service and great meals here so this was a no brainer, or so we thought. We're very familiar with the Cheesecake Factory menu and had an idea of what we wanted before even arriving.  The very young maître tried to seat us in ""singles-row"" where there wasn't even any other customers sitting there yet, but booths were open?  Hum. So my wife said, ""no"". I asked for a booth, so she continued on to an open booth. Problem solved.    We were already gazing at their ridiculously large, and bad layout of a menu when our server showed up. She told us about their new daily lunch specials, not, the average price was $15 - HUH?  $15 and up for a special?  Anyway, I went right into ordering our favorite appetizer, their Crispy Crab Wontons, plus waters, and a Stella Artois draft. The waters came. The crab wontons came. My Stella? Apparently there was an issue with the tap, as our server stated. After a 10+ minute delay, I stopped our server and started asking for a different beer when a manager came over with my Stella in hand, apologizing for the delay. No harm, no foul, as it was a cold Stella draft. Crisis diverted. Now it was time to order our meals. My wife opted for their Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club and I the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak which is a fancy way to say sirloin steak, medium-rare, no fries, rather spinach. The server repeated the order, shifted to walk away, then turned back and said, ""medium on the steak?""; I quickly replied, ""NO, medium-rare"".  The Crispy Crab Wontons were excellent as always. My wife's Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club came, and then a 2 minute delay then my sirloin steak arrived. As soon as the server placed my steak plate in-front of me I was concerned as my steak looked over cooked, well charred in-fact. The server didn't ask me to cut into it, nor waited, she was off - note, it was lunch and they were getting busier by the minute. I immediately cut into the ""medium-well, to well done"" cooked steak. Looked at my wife and sighed. I got up, found the server and explained the issue. She took the crispy critter away. A few moments past, and a different manager came over to apologize again, this time for the steak, he would make everything right, yada-yada. Typical manager spiel. OK. Fine.  My wife, a slow eater (true honey), was done with half of her massively huge, incredibly tasty sandwich and would be taking the other half home. Me? The spinach was excellent and I gobbled it up. Steak?  What steak. My steak never came and we were at the hour-twenty mark. I was done. I had enough fun for the day. This wasn't going to happen for me. I got up, found our server and said, ""I'm done. The steak never came. She looked shocked and gasped ""what?"" I stated, ""never came, I want the check. OK?"" She apologized, removed the $18 steak off our bill and handed me the check. I paid the $36 balance and that was that. What's curious, no other manager came to our table. After the hour mark they definitely should of showed up with more spiel but nothing. Live and learn.  I have to state I usually get the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club  or Classic Burger and both are always outstanding. Lessons learned - I should not have ordered a steak and can not recommend a steak at this Cheesecake Factory location. I have to add there was discontent within the server staff at this location; things I overheard that I clearly didn't need to hear. The overall service is slipping into a spiral at this location.  Will we go back to this Cheesecake Factory location? Time will tell. This location is clearly not managed very well anymore, and is not like the Cheesecake Factory of old. We're going to try Maggiano's Little Italy next to the Cheesecake Factory on our next visit to the area. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, you did it to yourselves."
Mrs. G.,"Marietta, GA",1,82,15,3.0,7/11/2014,"This is one of our favorite restaurants and we visit there about once a month. Lately however, the food has been slipping. I ordered my usual dish, spaghetti with meat sauce with sautéed shrimp. We also had the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer. The lettuce had dirt on it and the shrimp were not not clean nor fully cooked. Also the pasta must have an allergy to sauce because it barely had any on it. Am I wrong to expect clean, cooked shrimp, clean lettuce and sauce with my pasta for $120 for a family of 3??? Disappointed is the word of the day!"
Paris C.,"Atlanta, GA",2,38,12,3.0,5/9/2014,"So the food assessing good. Ordered the guacamole marrying order and the ahi ...the flavor of these two appetizers were amazing and I couldn't complain, but I gave three stars simply for the service. I sat at the bar and I get that it can get busy fast...our waiter was nice but definitely slow. Then I waited for him to take my drink order. ....but became very frustrated when I noticed he was having side conversations. Definitely will visit a different location next time."
Laura D.,"Cumming, GA",19,9,5,4.0,12/6/2014,"Wait was a little long, but hello.  It's Saturday night,  so we expected a wait.  Spinach dip appetizer was very good, husband enjoyed his Chicken Bellagio, and my Barbecue Chicken Salad was delicious .  We shared a Lemon - Raspberry Cheesecake and it was very nice. Our waiter Louis was just right, attentive but not a hoverer. Our only complaint was that the 2 person tables need to be given a but more room. It is hard to get in and out.   All in all, a very nice date night."
Richard W.,"Rockmart, GA",0,1,,2.0,1/25/2015,Not what was expected. Didn't mind the wait time for a table. Gave us time to walk next door in the mall food court and get some soft pretzels. But after being seated and receiving our meals.... Food was bland hardly any taste. My meatballs we're like sawdust. But the cheesecake at the end was good. Maybe we should have just stayed at the pretzel hut at the mall.
Bob M.,"Medford, NJ",0,2,,3.0,8/13/2013,"Nothing outrageous, but always solid and dependable, and always something to hit the spot.  Good place when you can't decide what you are hungry for - crazy amount of choices.  Decent martinis too. Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of the best chain restaurants in my opinion.  Killer cheesecake if you have room left."
Ken T.,"Nashville, TN",17,47,16,3.0,4/26/2014,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory but I may be over it. This experience and a few other like it may have me walking past one of my old favorites. For starters, the bread they served was smashed and not that fresh. We ordered my favorite appetizer the avocado egg rolls. They were okay but not up to standard. My wife and I shared a chipotle chicken pasta that was not up to CF standards. It was supposed to have asparagus but I couldn't find any. It was dry and finally the chipotle was not subtle but overpowering. I'm good w spicy food but this was too much. We added some cream sauce to it but it didn't help. We finished dinner w the Godiva brownie hot fudge sundae. They should've served a microscope at the same time because we could barely find the hot fudge and had to order more. My wife thought the brownie was excellent. Too frufru for me. Okay, I will go back but not right away."
Josh S.,"Bartow, FL",0,5,,4.0,1/12/2015,"We just stopped in to buy some cheesecake. All you can say is yuuummmmmmmmyy, the line wasn't bad given we were there around 3pm"
L C.,"Duluth, GA",6,12,16,5.0,10/3/2014,"Service was attentive and polite.  I sat in the bar area for lunch which ends at 4pm.  I ordered the lettuce wrap, Fett Alfredo with chicken.   Both plates were really good.  The pasta was very creamy and the lettuce wrap had a variety of tastes.  I ordered some cheese cakes to go.  Who goes to Cheese Cake Factory without ordering their cakes.  All in all, good food and service.  I am satisfied."
