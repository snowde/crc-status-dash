Brigitte L.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,5,1,1.0,9/28/2016,It would be nice not to have to wait 20minutes before our waiter came to get our drink order.
Chantrice C.,"Atlanta, GA",78,107,46,3.0,6/18/2016,"Arrived here around 4:45pm on a Sat. Was told it would be a 20 min wait. After 30-35 min of my pager not buzzing nor having my name called, I went back to the hostess and she said we were next. Another 15 mins passed and I saw that two families, that came in after us, were being seated. So again I had to go to the hostess and she said ""oh yeah y'all were supposed to be next"". So basically we had a defective pager. But soon after that we were seated- after nearly an hr wait, which was only supposed to be 20 mins. It didn't take long for our server (Tamara B) to arrive and I have no complaints about her. Actually, her service made up for us having that issue with the wait time. No complaints about the food."
Dawn C.,"Villa Rica, GA",0,2,,5.0,4/24/2017,What a Fabulous 18th Birthday celebration for my son. Our 1st time here & our waiter Reno was on top of everything. He had a great understanding of the meals to help our party of 8 figure out what to order & we nvr had to ask for refill b/c he automatically kept our glasses full. Different people assisted him in bringing out our food & everyone was courteous & nice. I asked for a side of alfredo to put on my jambalaya & a manager came & brought me her recommended sauce & discussed it further with me. I was so happy she did. The appetizers & food came out in a timely manner. Everything was so good. Half of us took our meals home to save room for the scrumptious cheesecake!!! THANK U RENO FOR YOUR AWESOME SERVICE!!!!!!
Princess J.,"Atlanta, GA",167,6,,2.0,4/24/2017,"I had decided I wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory on 4/22/17 to celebrate my birthday that was this passed Wed (4/19/17). Every time I go, I always order the Herb Crusted Parmesan Chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. This particular time, I was sadly disappointed. The chicken was soggy due to it sitting in some kind of sauce. The mashed potatoes and the green beans were so bland that I had to heavily season it with salt and pepper, which barely helped. I just decided to charge it to the game and keep it moving because I had little time left to spare, and our waiter seemed less than friendly. All in all, I probably would not come back to this location. Such a shame that an establishment that had high reviews at one point has went in the opposite direction."
Ali P.,"Marietta, GA",146,137,6,3.0,8/7/2016,You already know what this is... but it's good and the steaks aren't bed either... try the chicken wraps and usually the soups are great too. Burgers decent and I usually get the rib-eye. Good place to get smashed although I dont drink.
Napolean P.,"Marietta, GA",0,10,14,1.0,3/24/2017,The restaurant is less than half empty (4:06pm) and we waited more than 10 minutes for them to  ***believe it or not*** WIPE OFF A BOOTH. Terrible service!
FarraH B.,"Henderson, NV",127,109,66,3.0,8/30/2015,"My staples here(nationwide) never seem to change... Avocado rolls & vegan Cobb salad  Maybe wine,split cheesecake or none  My servers 80% of the time are great. Usually it's kind of a known aspect they don't take care of you as much as you desire given its always 50 billion people here..but that's given its so busy,I get it  My server tonight was ok...not good...ok...blah...no personality or smile...but she did her job...she served food and gave check  It's hard to complain when your order wasn't messed up or your food wasn't taking too long..but it's easy to notice somebody who doesn't want to be at work...or doesn't want to deal with...ummmm humans lol... All in all...the host was great,the food was as always great and the service was sufficient..."
Amy I.,"Dallas, GA",49,15,,1.0,9/4/2016,The food is not that good. We had 11 people in our group and 7 of our dishes were under cooked or tasted bland. When approaching management the problem was still not solved and for the price it is definitely a place to skip.
Angela S.,"Atlanta, GA",50,10,1,5.0,6/1/2016,Great service got in without a wait.... And they were quite busy.   Food was excellent servers were wonderful.   Will definitely be back again.   Cheesecake is to die for.  Chicken maderIa is my favorite dish although their steaks are great too.
LaTeefha M.,"Austell, GA",166,5,2,4.0,1/31/2016,"Last night my husband and I went to have some dinner and drinks. The food was really good and my Strawberry Margarita was one of the best that I've ever had! For our appetizer we had the Crab and Artichoke dip, it was delicious! My husband had the Herb Crusted Salmon and Steak. I enjoyed the Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira. We both enjoyed our meals, but weren't able to finish them. We enjoyed our dinner, despite the hour and so wait. The wait gave us some time to do a little shoe shopping! :)"
cynthia l.,"Woodstock, GA",66,25,7,5.0,9/3/2016,This has become my new go to place for salad. Such LARGE portions. A great value. Also love chicken Madera!  My favorite cheesecake is raspberry with white chocolate. Wish the prices were a little lower but would hate for the quality of food to suffer. Always excellent staff!
Tanisha B.,"Newnan, GA",1,31,58,1.0,9/21/2014,"Very unsanitary!! They cleaned the tables off with the dirty dish rag, wiping every onto the seat & then placed the silverware onto the bare table. They could have at least put the silverware on the napkin that was on the saucer. The service was super slow!!! It took about 10 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink order. By the time he brought the drinks, I didn't want an appetizer, I just wanted to order my entree. I also ordered my desert (to go) way before he brought the check so that I wouldn't have to wait forever on it.  The food however was delicious! 2 stars for the food only."
Angie R.,"Mableton, GA",3,261,1,2.0,4/29/2016,They need new hostesses. They are kind of rude and inattentive. They are like machines... Give your name.. Give you a buzzer and move aside. That's the feeling atleast. The food is well food... It's Cheesecake Factory. This location is just ok
Tomeka P.,"Atlanta, GA",53,11,87,1.0,7/29/2016,"A rude potential customer jumped in front of the line just to get on the waiting list. And the hostess accepted her rude behavior. Although we still have a 75-90 minute wait, we walked to a nearby restaurant, was given a 45 minute wait, actually waited less than 20 minutes. Very disappointed in The Cheesecake Factory."
Christina S.,"Austin, TX",0,8,5,1.0,7/31/2017,"Absolute worst service of my life. First off let me tell you I work in the service/food industry so I have remorse for busy servers etc. We were placed in an awful two seater booth by the bar (definitely should not even be a spot for eating) and it took awhile for anyone to come around. Finally a server showed up took our drink orders and left. Another server dropped off our drinks and I had to stop a random server 5 minutes later to POLITELY ask for waters that we asked for along with our wine and bread. She was so rude and responded ""what do ya need?"" with a nasty face on. Our server finally brought waters and bread and took our orders. WE SAT THERE FOR 45 MINUTES WAITING FOR OUR FOOD WITH NO SERVER CHECKING ON US. Everyone around us who came in after had already finished dinner. Manager finally brought our food out after the server spoke to him, he was probably too embarrassed. Over all, servers are rude and it was just a bad atmosphere where we were sitting and you'd think the server would make up for it but NO. Was excited for a nice night out but it was sadly ruined by the service."
Caron L.,"Jonesboro, GA",10,12,1,4.0,7/25/2016,I've been a fan for a long time..the food has gotten a lot better and.. very good.. a fan for life
Charli P.,"Mobile, AL",88,154,125,4.0,9/24/2014,"Four of us dined at the Atlanta location last night.  The service was slow but the food was great.  There is a huge menu so I suggest skipping appetizers because the entrees are large portions!  We enjoyed the Herb Crusted Salmon, Southern Fried Catfish, Chicken Piccatta and Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken.  Unfortunately, the waitress forgot my friend's salad, but she did take it off the meal.  If you are in a hurry, skip this restaurant or at least this location.  For a Tuesday night, it was moderately busy, but certainly not packed and the meal took about two hours. Save room for dessert!"
Wynter F.,"Kennesaw, GA",671,203,178,3.0,6/27/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory. I mostly love the cheesecake part of it but I think the food is good too. I just wish it was a little bit less expensive especially the lunch menu. I went one day for lunch with my mom and I ordered a cobb salad, which even for the lunch portion, is still a good sized salad. I can't imagine what the dinner one looks like! If it was even smaller and cheaper I would like it a little more since I couldn't even eat half of it. The cobb salad is full of bacon, bleu cheese, shredded egg, half an avocado sliced and mixed with a vinaigrette. I like to mix ranch with vinaigrettes so I asked for a cup on the side.  The service was good. I never feel like I get great service though. This time was no different. Our server brought bread out and brought the extra dressing we asked for but never returned to see if we needed anything else until she brought the bill. Every experience at this location is always the same."
Angelynn J.,"Lakeland, FL",94,161,343,4.0,9/16/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. When I come to this Cheesecake Factory it's hardly ever a bad wait, and the food is never bad. Sometimes there can be a bad server but most of the time that isn't a problem. Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory I have to get the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake it's my favorite."
Johnathon H.,"Marietta, GA",39,20,25,3.0,11/22/2015,"Meh.  The wife and I haven't been here until today and I can almost guarantee we won't come back.  Took 10 minutes for the waiter to come ask us what we wanted to drink . OK cool that's understandable, they are sort of busy. Then 5 minutes later be comes and asks again. Then a few minutes later I overhear him asking another waitress to bring us drinks. It's not really our waiter's fault though. Management has them spread too thin.  I ordered a sandwich and an app then my wife got spaghetti. The spaghetti tasted like it was sponsored by Morton's salt. Like Morton himself made the sauce. Pure salt.  All this took about an hour and a half to get in and out. The food wasn't worth the wait or the price we paid."
