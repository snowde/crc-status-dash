Amy W.,"Smyrna, GA",32,109,,4.0,9/14/2015,"Cheesecake as far as the eye can see and a menu so overwhelming you will need a bookmark, but you can't make a mistake. A date night favorite and good for groups.  They don't take reservations though, which is super inconvenient"
Krystall E.,"Atlanta, GA",11,54,13,4.0,3/17/2016,"Waited about an hour and a half for a table but it was soooo worth the wait. Our server was very nice. The table was awful and cramped but the food was amazing!!! And the cheesecake oh my, I could love off of it. Can't wait to go back, just not on a wekeed night."
Janis W.,"Hudson, OH",41,214,113,4.0,7/20/2015,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?  Load up on appetizers and indulge on the cheesecake!  I had a vegetarian friend with me who ordered the nachos and asked for no meat - they put a chipotle sauce on it with jalapenos, cheese, onions, etc. and it was excellent.  The stuffed mushrooms had a crunch to the topping which was a wonderful surprise, and the tempura shrimp were excellent although the ""dynamite sauce"" didn't have much ""dynamite"".  And of course the cheesecake was fabulous - my fav is the tiramisu version.  Heavenly!  This was the most expensive dinner of the three nights there, but so worth it!"
Camillia H.,"Smyrna, GA",68,9,1,1.0,6/19/2016,"I had the most disappointing time at this location. This past Friday the whole buildings electricity went out for some reason & where we're left to eat dinner in the dark. I know different things can happen, but there was no communication about what was going on or anything. We were told after 15 minutes that the cooks couldn't cook anything & the drink machines wouldn't work either. I had no clue about how long it would last so I asked to close my check out. The waitress was gone for another 20 minutes, before I asked to speak to a manager & the manager finally brought me my handwritten check. Very horrible customer service that there were no apologies or mention of maybe a comp on our next meal or anything. I will not be going back."
Yeeli C.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,4,,4.0,7/11/2016,"After 9 days on the road, driving cross country from AZ to GA, we arrived at our hotel on my birthday. :) After getting settled in, we thought Cheesecake Factory sounded awesome. Since this location is close by our hotel, we head over at about 5pm. With 2 young children in tow, we always try to beat the crowd and make breakfast, lunch and dinner just a little earlier when eating out.  We got there slightly past 5pm, was seated immediately with no wait. I told the hostess to put us in a booth or table, preferable away from everyone else, as my 2.5yo can be quite ""distracting"" and likes to play with others who seats around us. I mean, it can be cute when a 2.5yo plays peek-a-boo with you from behind a booth. But after about 5 mins or so, it gets bored quickly... ;p We were seated at a booth along the glass windows next to their patio seatings. It was perfect! I think we were the only table there at that moment, but our server came quickly to take our drink orders. Warm bread were brought to the table shortly after, drinks, and then dinner is served.  I ordered the shrimp and sausage with pasta. It is in a red sauce with a little spice to it from the sausages. Wish there were more shrimps in the dish though, but it was pretty good. Leftover was even better the next day.  hubby ordered chicken Alfredo, the sauce was rich and creamy. Leftover for this dish, however, was not that great the next day because there were not enough Alfredo sauce in the togo box. Think our server might have missed some sauce when she packed up our leftover. The kids ordered from their kids' menu -- pizza and chicken quesadilla. They were amazing!! Portion was quite big, but we don't really mind as we adults were eating of the kids' plates. ha! And yes, there were leftover from these too. And they were great the next day. And we can't leave without having some dessert. I got the oreo cheesecake, and the boys shared something with a lot of chocolate on it. And the waitstaff sang happy birthday to me. I can tell that aside from our server, who was GREAT and AWESOME, the other 2 staff members were not too excited about singing me my birthday song. They sang with minimal expression on their face and left immediately after the last note. Well.... I was not expecting it, so I was not too disappointed by it either. :) Our server was great though. I wish I remember her name. She is petite, in her 20s, African American, with a great smile! Service was great, our server was great. We would definitely come back to this location."
Erika E.,"Smyrna, GA",43,181,6,4.0,4/15/2016,"I have visited this Cheesecake Factory several times since my first review, so I think it's time for an update.  I think the food has definitely gotten better over the years, and the Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has something for everyone.  It is the perfect gathering place for lunch or dinner.  I stopped in last week and ordered lunch with a friend.  My server was wonderful, and even though we caught the lunch crowd, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the mushroom burger with fries and it was delicious!  I definitely keep coming back to this place time and time again!"
Temoor B.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,2.0,7/9/2016,I have been having food from cheese cake factory for past 6 years. I have tried nearly all cheese cake factory restaurants in Chicago and a couple in New York . Unfortunately this restaurant was the worst among all. Their sides were so small. Their branches in Chicago always give big sides buy over here I paid 21$ for a combination deal and got 3 pieces of shrimps fully covered with tomatoes and 3 tiny pieces of steak . Where in Chicago same dish consists of 6 pieces of steak and 6 pieces of shrimps . Seats were uncomfortable to. Well it was just a one day visit to Atlanta so no more worries
Carolina M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",103,783,259,3.0,5/19/2014,"I've only been here to do takeout, haha, because I was lazy. Like, so lazy, I did their curbside to go because I didn't want to get out in my pajama pants. So I appreciate the fact that the waitress was efficient and even complimented me that I looked great. I tipped her well. I ordered just a few things: Ahi Tuna Salad: Still really consistent at every Cheesecake Factory I've been to. They keep the tuna chilled, make sure there's lots of fresh greens, and there's more than enough dressing.  Mushroom Flatbread: Not impressed. The portion is good for one person, but it didn't look appetizing with its shape. The taste was ok though, but I probably wouldn't order it or any other flatbreads again. Chicken Samosas: The sauces with the samosas are delicious. The samosas themselves were flavorful and a little too salty for my taste. Then again, I did just order samosas from a chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in Indian cuisine, so I blame myself for that one. I was just too ashamed to order something like southwest eggrolls. So Cheesecake Factory is still a good ol standard to eat that's a step-up from the other fast foods. I definitely appreciate the ease of calling in my order and picking it up especially when it's close by."
Kenisha H.,"Douglasville, GA",67,1,,1.0,12/11/2016,"This was the worst service that I have ever had.  First off my friend had made a reservation for her daughter's birthday party 3 weeks ago and was told that they would accommodate that.  She was told on the day of the dinner that they do not do reservation.  Arrived at the resturant at 430pm and was not seated for 2 hours.  Once seated was not offered any drinks or appetizers.  The wait staff continued to ignore our table for another hour.  Other guest asked could they order drinks and was told yes, the servers never return.  These guests ended up leaving due to the bad service.  Finally had to ask a random waiter could they bring us bread and drinks and it still took so much time to even get that.  I watched other tables and big parties get the service that anybody who comes to a restaurant should get and deserve.  It was another 2 hours before we even got to order our food, it was about 9 pm at this time.  Once the food was ordered, the food still took another 30 minutes to 45 minutes to come out and that was when we inquired about our order.  Your managers are rude and nasty.  They should not be in the positions that they are if they do not know how to deal with customers.  I was told by one manger that my food came out before everyone which was a lie, it actually came out 3rd out the remainder guest that was still there.  This was my first and last time ever coming to this resturant.  I have never had this type of bad service from a restaurant in my life.  This is the worst service I have ever had will not be returning.   The entire staff needs better training overall. Very unhappy customer."
Timothy K.,"Lithia Springs, GA",171,4,2,3.0,5/2/2016,"The food is good, this place seems more of a tourist  restaurant,  there are many restaurants that the meal are better,  but the sweet are 1000. Cheesecake Galore. The service is ok if u are dining in, a bit rushed ordering take out"
Yessy S.,"Atlanta, GA",10,10,4,3.0,7/18/2015,"Checked out the factory @ Perimeter Mall (not Cumberland) last night with my 10 month old, a friend and her 4 year old. It wasn't busy but the service took a while so expect to wait a while to get seated, have a server come take your order and bring your food out. I mainly went for the cheesecake, hadn't had one in forever but I also ordered the mango crush which was pretty good and had the crab bites-- not bad and pretty fulfilling considering that I hadn't eaten since lunch time @ work. We were there around 8:30pm I rated an A-OK because our drinks (including the water) took FOREVER to get to us. It shouldn't take almost 30 minutes to get our drinks especially when the restaurant wasn't packed..."
Mike R.,"Savannah, GA",39,1,,5.0,4/9/2016,Great service and accommodating for larger parties.  Very good food too.  Definitely recommend.
Kayla S.,"Knoxville, TN",1,30,4,4.0,3/26/2016,"The food is fabulous as always! The wait time wasn't that bad for such a busy restaurant. My only complaint is that the servers seemed a little overwhelmed, like they had too many customers to wait on."
Fiona F.,"Atlanta, GA",51,73,89,3.0,4/29/2014,"They have a skinlicious menu with labels for calories amount, which is nice.  I like their lettuce wraps - 6.95 for 3 - decent price for lunch choices.  The wraps are well put together and stick together - less messier than I expected.   They have several flavors - I like the Asian one the most. Mexican ones are a little too plain.  Overall I think Cheesecake Factory has quality food like pasta, salmon.  - good service and a variety of choices. Nothing too special but something for everyone!  This thing is this place gets too crazy over the weekend that you need to wait a long time to be seated. For this reason I don't go this place often."
Karo R.,"Powder Springs, GA",1224,400,1170,4.0,9/22/2013,"Hate chain restaurants, but ...... I love this place!!! The food was delicious, I was there celebrating my friends mothers 30th anniversary, so it was a party of 8, we were seated quickly and server waa very attentive, atmosphere was perfect. I finished off my meal with a cheesecake with so many layers they named it outrageous. This is definitely a spot that I will be visiting again soon."
Jonathan M.,"Marietta, GA",34,51,143,4.0,10/5/2014,"Kinda late on this review lol. came here last Friday with Ryan Gorman for dinner, packed as always on the weekend, we had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, not an issue with me since the food is always worth it and the servers are always great. We started with the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers; I love avocados, so good with the tamarind cashew dipping sauce, literally the only kind of eggroll I actually like. For entrees Ryan and I decided to go with pasta, I ordered the Tomato Basil Pasta and Ryan ordered the Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes, our waitress Sunshine (yes that is her actual name, cute right lol) was great, but she got the order wrong for Ryan and brought him the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo instead, Ryan was nice enough to keep it actually and ordered some marinara sauce to compliment it, both plates were delicious and plentiful I was only able to eat half. Obviously we ordered cheesecake afterwards, Ryan got the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I got the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, both were mighty delicious and creamy, enjoyed them completely. In my opinion we should have gotten a discount for getting part of the order wrong, or at least charge us the price for the sun dried tomatoes which is cheaper the fettuccini alfredo, but they charged us full price, that is the only reason I'm giving four starts instead of five, other than that, we had a great experience all around."
Carmen B.,"Atlanta, GA",7,12,50,5.0,10/28/2014,"Decided to try again, cause I love their menu. Much better experience! Stacy was our server, she was great! Came with my hubby this time, so my Momo missed out.  A  little late, however, I needed to put them out there.  Prior to moving to Ga, my family and I spent some time stationed in Hawaii, with the US Navy, where we frequented the Cheesecake Factory Waikiki, often, no problems. It's around 7:00 in the evening, we're hungry, and my 10 year old daughter suggests we go to the Cheesecake Factory. I'm all in, love their old fashioned strawberry shortcake, chicken caesar salad, amongst other things. We get there, it's not that busy, the hosts seats us, and we're looking at the menu. After waiting about 10 minutes for water, or just to be acknowledged, NOTHING, okay.  A woman is seated along side of us, turns to look for her other half, spots him, he sits down, and in a flash, napkins are laid on their table and they are asked how they're doing and what would they like to drink. My daughter noticed the ignorance before I could even respond. Needless to say, we left and had a wonderful experience at The Grub Burger. Their entire staff needs to be re-trained in QUALITY customer service, cause those lame-O's are giving a quality restaurant a bad name! Four thumbs down!!!!"
Izzy r.,"Wilmington, NC",0,3,,1.0,10/19/2016,"We just left the Cheesecake Factory. I initially ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. It wasn't good at all and was not seasoned. I then ordered the chicken piccata which I have ordered for years. Still no seasoning. My boyfriend ordered the chicken tenders meal. His fries were cold and his tenders weren't well seasoned either. Now we have eaten at different Cheesecake Factory locations for years. This was by far the worse location we have ever visited. We spoke with the manager, Tabitha, who only offered to replace the meals. If we already replaced one meal with another one and neither of them were good, why would we want to replace the meal(s) a third time? Normally I am happy about paying whatever I need to pay for my meals, but tonight I was pissed. We expect great service and great food because the caliber of restaurant this is. Maggiano's and PF Changs are located on each side of the CCF. Maybe we should have gone to one of those restaurants. We will NOT be returning to that location and we are NOT happy with, Tabitha's, response. She was more worried about her numbers than she was worried about returning customers. I will be posting this on your website and social media.  Ms. Cotton"
Lauren L.,"Norcross, GA",0,14,1,1.0,10/24/2015,"Service was extremely slow, food was ok not the best. Can't say I had a good experience.  The waitress seemed like she was hesitant to take on our party. Won't be back to this location."
Kevin M.,"Atlanta, GA",1,29,,2.0,3/23/2015,"Went there for lunch today. I ordered Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, but I aaked for peanuts instead of the standard cashews. Well, I didn't get peanuts or cashews...I got pecans. And there was no avocado at all which is a complete brainteaser considering the word ""avocado"" is in the name of the dish on the menu.  Also, I'm not sure which restaurant can lay claim to being the first but this salad is very, very similar to the Thai Chicken Salad at J. Alexander's...the chicken is even sliced in the same super-thin, length-wise manner. And considering the one at J.Alexander's is far superior to this salad in just about every way (flavor, texture, value, etc.), this salad felt like a knockoff.  The avocado misstep normally wouldn't deserve one less star but since it's in the name of the dish itself I couldn't look past it. Not remembering the peanut switch request also wouldn't normally be such a bad thing but I got neither what is normally on the dish (cashews) nor what I asked for (peanuts). Therefore, that was worth an entire star, too. Two big mistakes on the same day made me miss the J.Alexander's version even more. It's never good when a dish reminds you of a competing restaurant. So that had to be worth a star too.  Add it up, and it was a 2-star experience."
