Nicki K.,"Norcross, GA",286,702,2383,4.0,12/6/2013,"Cumberland Mall sure has grown within the last decade with better stores and restaurants flourishing the area. Even my job have meetings at Maggiano's there. Cheesecake Factory is right next to Maggiano. I have to admit, I got a really bad experience at Cheesecake Factor a decade ago and never went back. On top of that, I don't like cheesecake.  It took some convincing but a co-worker wanted me to try the food and says it's worth it. I mean after all, it's been over a decade, right? She was raving about the Mac & Cheese burger and fries. I almost got that...except I don't eat beef, more like I don't like beef. If the waitress would've offered or suggested putting it on a turkey burger, I would've been down to try it. So instead, I got the chicken burger and fries. I was not disappointed at all. The restaurant was a lot fancier than I thought and wasn't as busy either. We went when it was noon. It was harder finding a parking space than being seated. Co-worker wanted to prove to me I just had bad quality cheesecake in the past, so I decided to order the turtle cheesecake. She got the pumpkin cheesecake. We both took dessert to go and ate at our desk. We were very happy. I can happily say that I will go back to Cheesecake Factory and order again, especially the cheesecake."
Amanda D.,"Marietta, GA",65,10,,2.0,5/15/2015,"I'd give it a ""meh"" out of 10. This was my first time and we went because I had a gift card. The ""fire roasted artichoke"" that we started with seemed like it was steamed instead of roasted because it came out really soggy and unappealing. Not really enhanced by either sauce it came out with either.  After our appetizer it took and exceptionally long time to get our main course. Without us asking about it a manager came out to explain that the kitchen forgot to cook the salmon for my girlfriend's salad which was causing the delay. So by the time the food actually came out mine (chicken and broccoli) volcanically hot and dried out from being reheated.  Our server was nice and apologetic about the wait on the food, but overall I don't have any strong desire to head back to Cheesecake Factory."
J F.,"Marietta, GA",9,124,278,4.0,1/21/2015,Came out with friends great night. ..service good. ..sat at bar a Lil slow but bartender was very busy with no help. ..food was on point. ..drinks weak but that's normal here!
David J.,"Lithia Springs, GA",1,8,,1.0,9/27/2015,"wow...  So we all know the cheesecake is to die for...  and maybe I shouldn't complain about their savory side. that being said.. I'll proceed with honesty.  I kept it simple with a Margherita pizza. sounds like it would be a tough one to mess up but nevertheless..  it arrived with sparingly used marinara,  no tomatoes and no basil... ??!  really?  They added basil...  the pizza was 13 on the menu.. meh.  As for the 7 year old, my son,  he played it safe with buffalo strips and fries..  no complaints really but not elevated or anything.  8 bucks on the children's menu.  My lovely wife created her own omelet. Cheddar, roasted peppers, jalapeño, and diced ham. Omelet seriously lacked cheese..  enough to make her dig for it..  toast with no butter or fancy organic jam {what was the purpose} and served with seasoned potatoes which were pretty good but it's potatoes.  overall...  way overated ..  eat anywhere else more affordable nearby and just scoop up a piece of pie on the way home."
Simone T.,"Hiram, GA",173,8,3,2.0,9/2/2016,"Tonight was a terrible experience. So my boyfriend and I were seated outside as requested and then 20 mins passed by and I just asked one of the many waiters who passed by can someone serve us and bring 2 waters. We weren't her table but she helped out and then a guy brought water out didn't speak just dropped it off and kept moving. She came back and checked on us and told us that was our waiter that brought the waters of table and we were shocked... He had a big attitude from some reason and didn't bother speaking... That ticked me off but I just carried on, then I was about to eat my bread and the plate was noticeably dirty, I saw a man walking by in a suit so I figured it was management. I asked for replacement and he then bought me another dirty wet plate, as if he just rinsed it off!!! That pretty much did it for me... I tracked down  the helpful lady from before and asked for my food to go. I gave them 2 stars, one for the cheesecake and the other for the turkey burger that I am going to devour shorty.... But customer service and cleanliness is in the negatives tonight"
Jenny L.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,26,,4.0,9/18/2016,I came in at 4:53pm on a Saturday and the wait time for a party of 10 was 1.5 hours which seemed a bit long. When the food arrived my order was wrong and the manager came over to apologize which was already more than necessary and she told the waitress not to charge me for my entree! Great food!
Addy C.,"Atlanta, GA",1046,877,4291,4.0,1/9/2011,"I'd been here twice for lunch, both times to catch up with a wonderful friend I had met at an alumni reception in Durham - she graduated 30 years before me, she loves Cheesecake Factory, it seemed proper to let her pick the restaurant, plus the wide menu selection makes it easier for both parties to find something they like.  Both times we got the lunch specials which are available every day. And like dinner, lunch portions are also generous - I always have enough leftovers to make another meal, which is why I don't get the salad. (Who likes soggy salad leftovers?)  SPICY CHICKEN CHIPOTLE PASTA - $10.95 I'd remembered that another friend had told me this is what she always orders. I also remembered having a taste and loving the creamy sauce, and deciding this is what I would get next time. Honey-glazed chicken, asparagus, red & yellow peppers, peas, garlic & onion in spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce. The sauce is really what carries the dish - slightly sweet & slightly spicy, just like I like it :) Being the new year, I exercised portion control and made 3 meals out of the 1 order. Actually, knowing we'd be ordering cheesecake afterwards made it easier to stop eating to make room for dessert :) Win Win! GARLIC NOODLES - $12.95 Also good dish. Spaghettini, fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes, & parmesan in garlic sauce w/ chicken. Delicious sauce.  SALMON W/ MISO - $12.95 I had just a bite and loved the sauce. My friend got this both times. The cheesecakes are great and like their entrees, the slices are generous. Both times my friend and I shared 1 slice which was plenty. Tried Red Velvet and the Lemon Raspberry Cream - both very good.  Service was excellent both times, and both times the server asked if wanted separate checks w/o us asking.  FYI - restaurant is part of Cumberland Mall so plenty of free parking in front."
Chrystena M.,"Atlanta, GA",1,15,1,3.0,3/14/2016,"The stars are for the food and other employees. I had the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. My server did not refill drinks, prebus my table(A 2seater table gets crowded pretty fast with used dishes) or showed face when I needed anything. She passed my table several times but her primary concern was all the other guests. I personally didn't think she deserved a tip. Tips are earned based on service. She didn't really serve us. However, she still got 10%. Luckily her fellow servers filled our drinks and brought our order out. That's the only thing to save this review."
D J.,"Chicago, IL",1,89,24,1.0,8/4/2015,We Came here on Sunday for lunch while visiting the Atlanta area. Well... Let's say I wondered why this restaurant didn't get the best reviews and now I know why. Our waiter was a guy named Terry who was extremely rude and made the entire table feel as though we were annoying him!! We will never go here again
Yuzetta A.,"New Orleans, LA",118,21,,5.0,1/15/2016,I went with my family for my little cousin graduation from college. The food was so good. I think the chefs there cook with that southern love!!!
Shawn A.,"Hampton, GA",2,62,74,4.0,9/23/2015,Great food. Great service. Bring a credit card
Meggan N.,"Powder Springs, GA",32,31,25,5.0,8/15/2015,"This location has always been a great place to eat. My party was actually wanting to go to P.F. Chang's next door, but due to their lack of accommodation, the wait was way too long. We checked next door and The Cheesecake Factory was able to take a party of 8 immediately, no wait. Surprising for a Friday night as well. Our sever was great and very attentive, and diligent. Everyone's meal came out at the same time, so you didn't have that awkward pause of, should I eat or should I wait?. It was a delicious end to a great night."
Shanette S.,"Marietta, GA",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2016,"Just had one of THE worse experiences of my life at this location . Its my birthday & my fiance made suprise reservations for mu entire family at 5pm. Everyone arrived on time. All 20 of my loved ones and almost a hour later, we still were not seated. They gave one of our tables that they said was for us away. After about 45 minutes, another manager informed us that reservations were not allowed on Sundays... which Ive never heard of. It should have been explained when the reservation was made. It was a very bad experience. Far from professional. They need to get better organized in there. It's such a shame. I expect so much better from this establishment."
Aisha A.,"Marietta, GA",1,4,,3.0,4/6/2015,"You can't technically go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. The five minute was reasonable for a party of five.  There are plenty of options small plates, skinny drinks, burgers, steaks, fish etc.  .  The server was friendly. My Piña Colada wasn't the best and that is a drink that is hard to mess up. My appetizer the Tamale corn cakes were very good except they were room temperature. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad it was delicious the portion size can feed two. I was overwhelmed with what to eat as my main dish, however I was able to convince someone at my table to order the Chicken Scampi that was excellent.  You can not leave without having cheesecake and the key lime cheesecake was amazing. I would eat here again, there was nothing that was special or made it a very intimate dining experience."
Omega F.,"McDonough, GA",34,36,51,5.0,11/1/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. Everything I've had on the menu has been delicious. This time I decided to try the Fish 'N Chips on the lunch menu. It was fried perfectly, with a light, crisp batter, and with crisp chips. It was perfect with malt vinegar.  Of course I can't forget about the Cheese Cake! This time I tried the classic Vanilla Bean. Which has a layer of vanilla mousse, it was heaven on my plate. There are so many choices that it took me half of lunch to make of my mind which cheese cake to order.  I have to say that the cheese cake brings me back everytime!"
Christy H.,"Marietta, GA",3,27,30,4.0,7/11/2014,Their food is okay. I'd go at lunch when it's cheaper. I only come here for the cheesecake. If you come on a holiday...don't unless you like waiting in a horrible line outside the door in Georgia's humid summers.
John G.,"McDonough, GA",22,13,5,3.0,12/21/2015,"Had late lunch/early dinner here with family and friends on 12/20/15. This was actually my first time at this location, but my kids had been before. I had the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, which wasn't bad, but wasn't great, but overall, I enjoyed the experience. I did enjoy my after food cocktail the Modern Old Fashioned. I'll definitely consider going to this location again."
Q Y.,"Homestead, FL",3,31,9,4.0,10/28/2014,Delicious egg benedict. I only wish that they didn't put too much hollandaise over my eggs. And of course delicious cheese cakes.
Sarbeth F.,"Atlanta, GA",71,36,15,1.0,4/20/2014,Horrible service today. My daughter and I eat out about 5-6 times a week. Had to ask for bread which didn't come out until after the first appetizer. Ran out of cocktails sauce with our calamari and had to ask THREE times for some more cocktail sauce. The waitress just kept bringing cold tomato paste instead of cocktail sauce. My daughter even suggested to me that maybe the waitress forgot about us or went home. Had to ask for refills of our waters that were completely out. First time in a long time I contemplated not leaving the tip at all. I still left the tip even though she did not deserve one at all. So ready to just leave didn't even order dessert.
Carolina A.,"Marietta, GA",7,61,31,2.0,5/11/2016,"Not worth the price. I came here for a banquet with some friends and I was not impressed at all. The chicken tenders did not taste fresh, and we all agreed that the fries tasted flavorless and obviously frozen. I wish most of the entrees here weren't so expensive - I guess this restaurant is all just hype. I got the macaroni and cheese burger - nothing special, overly greasy fried mac and cheese. I just LOVE how I ordered a barbecue sauce with my fries, (the waitress said it would be 95¢ extra, I said fine) and got a half empty tiny cup of it. Good thing the fries tasted bad, or else I would've ran out of sauce.  I ordered the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and wow was it small - I thought I would take some home but it was just a sliver. They were also very stuck up when seating my party. We got there at our reservation time and they wouldn't seat us because a few people were missing - not even half of our party. Won't be coming back unless forced to."
