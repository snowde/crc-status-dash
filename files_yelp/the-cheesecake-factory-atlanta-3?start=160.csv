Amanda S.,"Smyrna, GA",49,35,210,4.0,11/6/2012,"4.5 Star.  Cheesecake Factory (this one particularly) is a staple favorite of Mine ever since the T.G.I Friday's left Powers Ferry Road in Marietta. It's My go-to for many dinner dates and afternoons with friends.  A party of 2 can expect 20 minute - 1 hour wait times on a Friday or Saturday night. Valet is available on these nights, and it's recommended since parking spaces are few and far between.  The large fountain courtyard is a good place for your party to relax and chat while awaiting a table if sitting at the bar isn't of interest. Like all Cheesecake Factory's, portions are huge, the selections are extensive, the ambiance is lively but romantic under some circumstances, and the interior decor is beautifully designed. The soaring mural ceiling and large windows (which are promptly shaded upon sunset) really give the place a sense of spaciousness. There's an outdoor dining patio scattered with powerful heat lamps so diners can enjoy it even during really chilly evenings, it it also quieter than indoors. I always seem to order the same thing, despite the vast number of items on the  menu.  When I have ventured to try other items, I haven't been disappointed. My favorite order is the Thai Lettuce Wraps followed by a Chinese Chicken Salad.  The Thai lettuce wraps are insanely good and the portion is more than plentiful, it is a meal in itself. There are large lettuce leaves (iceberg and a purple variety?) which you fill with Satay chicken, shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and noodle strings. It is served with 3 different Thai-inspired dipping sauces, they are so delicious, I always order extras of each. Things will get messy with these wraps, but I promise that you wont even care! Other favorite appetizers are the Firecracker Salmon Rolls, Avocado Eggrolls, and Buffalo Blasters - they're awesome and great to share. The Ahi Carpaccio (raw tuna with wasabi and avocado cream) is also wonderful. The Chinese Chicken Salad mountain makes a grand entrance, it is piled high! Crispy rice noodles and wontons, savory grilled chicken, mandarin orange slices, sesame seeds and other toppings grace this delicious Asian-inspired salad. The tasty Chinese plum dressing really sets it off. Yum.  Their orange chicken is pretty good too, it's not actually spicy though and I wish the sauce was heavier. Same goes for their Bang-Bang chicken & shrimp and the Caramel Chicken (which I ordered sans-mushroom) entrees.  The best way to order your drinks is directly at the bar, the bar also offers the perfect diversion if you're stuck waiting for a table. They have added a ""Skinny Drink"" menu, and many other drinks can be made ""skinny"" as well.  On the ""Skinny"" note, I once ordered the grilled artichoke, it was surprisingly tasty.  Once you're seated, even if the place is packed and service is slower than usual, you'll be given a complimentary basket of 2 sliced bread loafs with sweet butter to accompany them. The basket will be replenished upon request. I've always received reasonably good service here, no complaints to make. I rarely order dessert because I'm already bursting at the seams and holding a to-go box by the time I'm finished with My meal. However, you really can't go wrong no matter what you order! I enjoy My cake ala mode when I'm able to indulge."
Charlie B.,"Palmetto, GA",18,34,5,1.0,7/15/2016,"Ok guys the last time I ever visit this location again! Went here for my birthday and I'm not going to complain about the wait it is what it is. But after 45 minutes then we are seated then wait 35 minutes for water and someone to take our order. You could tell our waitress was having a bad day but we made sure we smiled and was friendly but to no avail she just didn't care about us! So now here comes the fun part, food showed up one meal at a time 6 to 8 minutes apart, 4 of us getting our meals 20+minutes apart. I ordered chicken pasta and my meal had 3 pieces of chicken the size of dimes. I asked the waitress if this was correct and she said I don't know and walked off. So I reached out to another person walking by and they said they would carry it back. This time when the food came back 30 minutes later after everyone else had already finished the manager said nothing , not I'm sorry not have a nice day, not even enjoy. Service is slow, rude and just don't care. I have been here 3 times and every time has been terrible. This review like many others won't even get a look or reply from this establishment. I urge anyone thinking about going here drive a little farther and go somewhere else!"
Karen A.,"Atlanta, GA",23,35,11,4.0,5/2/2015,"This location at the Cumberland Mall is usually so busy, but this particular Saturday we beat the crowd and was seated in approximately 15 minutes. The bread they served was blah. Not warm and kind of hard. I ordered the grill steal medallions. OMG it was so tasty for a ""skinny"" meal! It's not a lot but it may be perfectly portion sized but big girls need more. I was surprisingly fulfilled by the portion size though. The steak is served with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and mashed potatoes. Sooooo good! My daughter ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Can you say spicy! Yikes! But she enjoyed. The waiter was friendly and attentive. All and all it was a cool relaxing experience and I'll be back when I'm on that side of town."
Barbara B.,"Marietta, GA",0,6,1,2.0,1/12/2015,We arrived a few minutes after opening. The hostess was too busy talking to a fellow employee about personal business. So  we waited and waited and we were finally seated. We arrived before the lunch crowd hit. Our waiter Dwain was awesome no complaining there! I  ordered the Roadside Sliders as always with the fries. Always amazing but this time one side of the burgers were burnt. The topside was perfect. I will be taking a break from the Cheesecake Factory! I felt like we were treated rudely by the hostess and my sliders forgotten. First bad experience! :(
Lee F.,"Smyrna, GA",61,19,,5.0,5/24/2015,"The Cumberland location is beautifully decorated in a Roman Fantasy motif with Art Deco accents.  My recent visit was on a beautiful day, so we had lunch on their covered patio, which is cooled by overhead fans just in case there are no summer breezes available.      Our server, Brandi, was not ""bubbly"", but when engaged, was genuine, amiable and knowledgeable about the menu.  She showed up with drink refills without being asked, and checked on us several times during the meal to make sure we were enjoying our food and didn't need anything.      As I am trying to lose weight, I ordered from their reduced calorie ""Skinnylicous"" menu (under 560 calories).  I had the Tuscan chicken, which is incredibly delicious for a ""healthy choice"" option. The oven roasted Roma tomatoes are amazing, and the pesto sauce is so good I couldn't resist dipping my bread in it to savor every drop.   If the other ""skinnylicious"" entrees are similar to the Tuscan chicken, you will definitely leave with happy tastebuds, a full belly and feeling indulgent."
Petrina P.,"Atlanta, GA",172,107,28,2.0,2/18/2014,"Ahh the chain restaurant. Same name, different service. The Cumberland Mall location is less than appealing. Nothing to write home to Mama about just a restaurant with a familiar name. My first sense of displeasure was with the waitstaff. A few of them were gathered behind me complaining and  very loudly. Not sure if it was personal or business but it was definitely inappropriate. Secondly my waiter, Samuel, his whole demeanor was off. We went back and forth on whether or not they had a Happy Hour menu. He was adament that they didn't and then 2 minutes later provided me with a ""special"" Bar menu where all most appetizers were $5 during 4 - 7...hmmm sounds like happy hour to me. As I waited for my friend, I noted how empty it was.  Normally The Cheescake Factory is always crowded but then again that's usually the Perimeter location.  Overall, the visit was fair, even though Samuel decided to argue yet again. This time about the ingredients in a Hot Toddy.  I stand by the fact that alcohol should,  in fact be included. I returned the drink, we paid our tab and left knowing the Cumberland location would not get another dime out of us.  Too bad. I loved the 1530 calorie Fried Mac 'n Cheese."
Jackie H.,"Atlanta, GA",316,419,286,4.0,5/9/2012,"I simply can't stay away from TCF.  I'm there for somebody's celebration or because I crave the Chicken Madeira or because I love the happy hour menu or because I need the Banana Fosters cheesecake. It's always one of those that gets me there and I am always happy when I leave.   Whichever one I end up going to (I've frequented all of them in the Atlanta area), service is always good, the atmosphere is nice, and I get some good grub.  I have never ordered nor tasted anything off another's plate that I didn't think was yummy.   The Chicken Madeira is excellent and served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I have such a hard time getting away from it.  Also, the happy hour menu, available from 4 to 6, M-F, features some of their regular sized appetizers for only $5.  I love that!  Portions are large and the selection is awesome.  They pour some pretty good drinks too!   Like I said, I can't stay away from TCF."
Maricela H.,"Waukegan, IL",19,55,33,4.0,7/1/2015,Same great good food may be better with a few more emoloyees. Everything clean and the service we received was pleasant
Jeremy S.,"Jackson, MS",69,2,,5.0,6/17/2016,"came here with my wife and daughter after we were done shopping in the mall...they were busy so i was expecting it to take awhile to be seated, walked in they took name and told me to wait...2 mins later table was ready...waitress was very professional and food came 5-10 mims after placed...would recommend this to anybody to come try"
Joshua S.,"York, PA",216,2,1,3.0,3/11/2014,"Food was decent (not as good as I remember) and waitress was very sweet, however service was a little slow."
Justina D.,"Canton, GA",48,5,1,2.0,6/12/2016,"The food is always consistent... that's why we go there. The floor was very dirty, slippery in places. The service was just okay. Basically, we were seated for 15 minutes before our drink order was taken. 10 minutes later we received our water and bread. The food came out in a reasonable time but no one checked to see how it was. Our server checked on us at the end to see if we needed boxes or wanted desert. 10 minutes later we got our check. No refills on our water. I had to find the server (chatting with other servers) so we could pay. It was obvious the other servers had great personalities; ours just wasn't around. Such a shame. I usually tip 20-30% but it was all I could do to tip 15%. Our server probably isn't thinking his service should be better in order to get better tips, he probably just thinks we're not good tippers. I hate to write a bad review but it has to be said. This location needs some work."
Scott C.,"Marietta, GA",1,2,,1.0,4/4/2014,"I have usually had good experiences here, however tonight was not that night.  My family arrived for dinner around 5:15.  Service was okay for the crowd, however once we got our order in it took close to 30 min for the food to arrive.  This normally doesn't work when you have twin 6 year old boys who aren't very patient. So, the food arrives and the boys food is piping hot.  Luckily they didn't burn themselves.  My factory burger however is ice cold.  I should have just ate it and  kept my mouth shut,  but I saw the waiter and he said he would take care of it.  But, then he comes back and says they have to make a new one which will take 5 -10 min to make. After waiting close to 20 minutes, my family is done with their meal and they bring the cheeseburger out.  At this point, my appetite didn't want it any more or even desert. The server asks if I want to box it up and I decline. I explained this to the waiter and we ask for a piece of cheesecake for our boys.  He asks again if I want the cheeseburger to take home.  I decline again and ask that the manager stop by. We get the bill and my burger, drink, and the piece of cake are not on the bill. The manger comes by and apologizes again  and offers me the cheeseburger again to take home.  Like these cheeseburger is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Honestly,  when I came I was just looking forward to some cake but I didn't want to give them the satisfaction of spending one dime here ever again. Now,  I wasn't expecting the entire meal to be free,  but they could have at least offered me a free desert or a free future meal. While leaving,  my final thoughts are they really don't care about future business or understand what good customer service is."
Susan S.,"Powder Springs, GA",46,10,6,2.0,8/26/2015,"Due to poor management , we will not return. All over a side of sausage. Wish they didn't turn our birthday party into  a bust;("
Tabitha D.,"Decatur, GA",0,9,1,3.0,8/22/2014,"When I come here for dinner, I am very underwhelmed.  The food here is just okay, especially considering the wait it long and the parking is a pain.  The cheesecake however is divine. I have had many of the flavors, and they are extremely delicious.  The only one I do not like is the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. The cookie dough is very hard and cheesecake has walnuts in it."
Scott D.,"Glendale, AZ",800,557,266,3.0,9/29/2013,"I thought I would eat outside the box and try something completely outside of my comfort level. So why not try some good ole southern comfort food like Chicken and Biscuits.  The entrée is delivered with a lot of gravy smothering the chicken, biscuits and mashed potatoes. They give you a lot of biscuits but only one small cutlet of chicken. I had to ask my waiter ""where's the chicken?"". I didn't really realize that the chicken was missing in action until near the end of my meal. Did I mention that there was a lot of gravy on the plate? My waiter came thru and brought to me a great tasting piece of chicken from the kitchen to save the day. Needless to say, the waiter was really good and made sure I was happy with my meal. It's probably been a good 10 years since I've been to The Cheesecake Factory. But I think next decade I am going to order something else besides the Chicken & Biscuits."
Diana L.,"Smyrna, GA",134,53,43,3.0,3/22/2014,"Nothing was terribly awful, but there was also nothing that jumped out at me that impressed me either -- your average chain restaurant. The decor here is better than some of the other Cheesecake Factories, so kudos for that. My favorite here is usually Steak Diane, but sometimes it doesn't meet expectations. This time I went with the Steak Diane and Salmon combo! Definitely a great surf and turf type combo."
Lisa A.,"Villa Rica, GA",1,19,,2.0,5/25/2016,"First time ever visiting The Cheesecake Factory.  I was disappointed. It surely did not live up to its pricing nor all the other hoopla surrounding it.  It gets three stars soley for the no-wait time, atmosphere and the cheesecake. The dropped the ball in every other area. I ordered the salmon and it was extremely bland. It definitely needs some more flavoring. I used my whole lemon to try and vamp it up some. The mashed potatoes were really good. The bread was extremely hard and not warm. I like my bread soft and warm and not crunchy like a potato chip! ;/  My date got the parm. chicken and it looked really good. My server (older white female with blonde hair) was very unpersonable and had limited menu knowledge. After telling her it was my very first time here, she never even acknowledged the fact, much less welcomed me as a new guest. I had to ask her for a suggestion and her only suggestion was what sold the most....not really what I was looking for. I ordered the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert and it was reeeeally good....overall, meh.....Maybe I will try again at another location.....sans the salmon! ;("
Katie M.,"Auburn, AL",3,3,6,5.0,8/13/2014,"This was phenomenal! We've always wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory. (Cheesecake is my hubby's fave dessert.) we have lunch on Saturday and it took a while to get a table, but the food and service was A+. Hubs got the Chicken Bellagio which was the best, and my pasta (with sun dried tomato sauce) was ok. Do to necessarily recommend that exact dish. Also, he had the fabulous red velvet came cheesecake and I had the banana cheesecake. They were both awesome!! And hue slices!! We loved it and hope to be back!"
Sheri A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,48,1,2.0,10/5/2015,2 stars for nice lady who brought the food out. As for the food it was really disappointing. I was in the area and thought I should grab a bite to eat here. I ordered a burger and fries to go. One bite into the burger and i knew i had made a mistake. The fries were not so great either.
Daniel B.,"Atlanta, GA",2874,2874,40846,3.0,9/25/2011,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times for lunch with my coworkers.  While it's one of the last places I'd probably choose for lunch, the food and service I've experienced at this location has always been good.  This Cheesecake Factory is located outside of Cumberland Mall.  There's plenty of parking outside with a handful of spots reserved for curbside to-go customers.  Unlike the Buckhead location, you can call an order into the Cumberland location and have it brought out to you in the parking lot. You can get ""lunch-sized"" portions of most of the pasta dishes until 5pm.  I put lunch-sized in quotes because the portions are still quite big.  Some of the entrees I've eaten here include the pasta carbonara with chicken and the farfalle (bow-tie pasta) with chicken and roasted garlic.  The pasta carbonara is a basic spaghetti dish with bacon, green peas, and a garlic-Parmesan cream sauce.  It's simple, but pretty appetizing.  The farfalle isn't bad either and includes mushroom, tomatoes, pancetta, and caramelized onions.  The sauces for their pastas are generally rich and creamy. The cheesecakes are downright delicious.  I've tried the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake, the fresh banana cream cheesecake, and the Snickers bar chunks and cheesecake.  I can't say I like any one over the others as they are all very good.  The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake has walnuts inside.  The Snickers bar cheesecake has chunks of Snickers baked inside and is topped with hot fudge and caramel.  Delicious. Lunch crowds during the work week can vary.  Service is typically on point and separating checks between several people (4+) has never been a problem."
