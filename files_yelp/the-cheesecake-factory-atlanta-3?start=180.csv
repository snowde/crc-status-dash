Tee J.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,17,12,4.0,6/30/2015,"Customer Satisfaction!!!! On Friday (June 26th) my family and I celebrated my cousin's graduation. After patiently waiting for our party of 12 to be seated for close to 2 hours. The GM (Mike) gave everyone a free appetizer, non-alcoholic beverage, and slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience. This was all we needed to hold us over until the main course was ready at home. Our waitress Cassandra was friendly and attentive to the needs of our group. On behalf of my family thank you for making this celebration a success!!!"
Tim D.,"Atlanta, GA",290,82,87,4.0,9/23/2012,"Today we ate at Cheesecake Factory in Cumberland Mall. I wanted to try something different today so I ordered the Mini-Corn Dogs and also the Mini Cheeseburger Sliders....wow  I was blown away by both of these! I was expecting the little corn dogs, but Cheesecake Factory never does anything like everyone else, these things we amazing! The mini-Cheeseburgers were awesome as well! The service was incredible, we had a server named Earl. He kept the drinks flowing and was there every time we needed something!  OVERALL GREAT MEAL!"
Smurfetatl W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,4.0,9/20/2015,Celebreted wedding anniversary late in the evening.  Service was friendly and personable.  Food was great and delecious as usual. Visited both Perimeter location and Cumberland - Cumberland was 100 times better! Both locations should do something about the pretty yet slipperary floors.  I slipped a few times entering and exiting (did not drink alcohol  ).
Cherise K.,"Naperville, IL",0,14,,1.0,7/30/2016,"While I'm a fan of The Cheesecake Factory and the food I have to give this location 1 star simply because of service. Due to their long wait times we always order for carry out. In the past we've spent 10-15 minutes in line just to pick up the order but figure it's better than waiting 2 hours for a table. Tonight I placed an order well before 7:00 and asked that it be ready by 8:00-I figured an hour plus was plenty of time to assemble some salads and cheesecake. My husband got there at quarter to 8 and there were no less than 30 people (he counted) standing to either place or pick up an order. In 25 minutes the line hadn't moved. He asked the hostess and was basically advised ""oh well-you have to wait"". What is the point of ordering ahead? Why in 25 minutes had the line not moved? When he asked to speak to a manager and asked if maybe there was a need for more help the manager's reply was ""sorry-we're just busy"" How do you wait in line to PICK UP food and there is no movement for almost a half hour?Especially when you have more than an hours lead time. Needless to say my husband just walked out. No food. No cheesecake for me. I'm now eating Moe's for dinner."
Malana F.,"Jonesboro, GA",0,3,3,1.0,5/13/2016,"As my first time ever being to Cheesecake Factory , I am not impressed , today we went for my friends birthday who reserved a table at 8 o clock as the rest of the group arrived we waited until 9:50 and a few of us asked about 4 times the status of the table and we were each told a different story , once we finally got to the tables we asked for a manager before our waiter came to the table we still haven't seen the manager and the waiters  have waited on us for and took our drink order only four people received drinks and the 11 of us waited 5 to 10 minutes for the rest of drinks and we weren't asked if we were ready to order we had to tell them we were ready , I won't be coming back ."
Rhonda W.,"Smyrna, GA",2,44,,3.0,6/6/2015,"Had dinner here on a week night with my daughter. The waiter was very attentive. The food was nothing memorable. I got a hamburger, it was ok. My daughter got a chicken pasta dish that could have easily fed 3 people. We both had plenty of leftovers, mine heated up just fine, when her pasta was reheated it was a greasy mess-gross! I think if they could cut the menu down, and focus on less items it would be much better. They are a little on the high side as far as pricing for the quality of the food, but the restaurant is beautiful and I will return."
Edward L.,"Atlanta, GA",318,371,105,4.0,2/10/2014,"The unofficial favorite lunch spot for Victoria and I on our weekly lunch dates. Cheescake Factory is kind of the same all around. 30 something types of cheesecakes and a menu that's way too big for it's own good. I like this Cheescake Factory because there never seems to be a wait even during lunch time. Sure you don't get the space you want, but at least you get your food. Servicce is fast, too!  The only thing you will actually spend time doing is finding parking. The parking at Cumberland is awful."
Amanda Z.,"Atlanta, GA",51,115,431,3.0,2/18/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always delicious; I have yet to visit a location that does not provide incredible food. The atmosphere is delightful, and the interior decor is beautiful. This was our first visit to the Cheesecake Factory at the Cumberland Mall. They conveniently have valet parking out front (only $3 before 3pm!) Our server, however, was less than pleasant. He acted annoyed to be serving us. He said no more than 5 words and never looked at us. He would come by quickly, slamming things around on the table, and spilling drinks from pitchers as he refilled our glasses. The restaurant was not busy at all; we dined at 2pm on a Tuesday."
Matthew D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,17,2,3.0,8/20/2015,"A bit over priced, but service is usually good as well as food. It's not a bad place but not the greatest if you want more exquisite delicious food ."
Quiba Q.,"Atlanta, GA",5,21,,3.0,6/6/2015,It's food. Not always fresh. The chefs have no idea what they're doing here. Buckhead location is much fresher!
William C.,"Smyrna, GA",0,2,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Me and my party arrived and put our name on the wait list. We waited right next to the podium. The first call for our table was heard ""Last call for ... party."" The first call was already the ""last call."" We are seated and minutes later we order our meal. We are seated by 1:12 pm. I order the white chicken chili. It's a meal I've had before at the Cheesecake Factory and like the name states it is supposed to be a white chili, which is a basic (not acidic) dish. What comes out is a tomato-based acidic chili with a few white beans tossed in. When I informed the waitress of the significant difference between the first time I had ordered the same dish and the current time, it was offered to replace the dish. Who I can only assume was the supervisor came over, introductions were not made, and when it was explained that due to reflux I was not able to eat the acidic dish which had, in previous experience, been basic and was described as and commonly is basic, it was stated by the supervisor that it is a white chicken chili because there are white beans in it, though she seconded the offer to replace the meal. No additional requests had been made after the initial offer and acceptance by myself or the rest of my party. I ordered the Factory Meatloaf instead. It was then 1:43pm.  At 2:20pm, the meatloaf dish arrived, my party long since finished eating. It initially looked fine, but due to the previous issue and the long wait time for what is typically a pre-prepared and simple dish, I took a closer look at meal, particularly the meat which was covered in onions and gravy, which was not unexpected. Upon review, the bottom of the first piece was burnt black on the edges encroaching toward the middle, but, after waiting so long, I wasn't inclined to send it back or complain for what was still largely an edible dish. I checked the second piece, and the entire bottom was blackened to the point that my fork could not pierce it. Over an hour had been spent waiting for food, and without a desire to wait another 40 minutes for a meal and have my party wait further,  and with the lack of desire to trust a request for a third meal without tampering, we opted to leave, a second chance already having been given. The item itself was removed from the bill, but no offer of recompense was made for the wasted time or for the poor experience, including lack of offer for the bill itself being cleared (party having only consisted of myself and one other). These days it seems like quality of service is in decline and you are only offered compensation if a scene is made. Decorum and fair exchange of goods is a thing of the past, as certainly my and my parties time and experience did not equate to the monetary value required in relation to the services and goods received. At this time, I do not intend to return to this location of The Cheesecake Factory. The waitresses service was adequate, and she was still tipped, as she did not do any wrongdoing herself and therefore should not pay for the poor experience. My problem is with the establishment itself and with the quality of the food, the chefs, the length of time for service in receipt of the food, and the amelioration of the situation. Certainly, if the food had not been burnt and overcooked, it would have arrived quicker, killing two birds with one stone. Over an hour passed, an hour wasted, and I'm left to seek another establishment for nourishment. Unfortunately, this time, Wendy's proved better and more reliable fare."
Sho C.,"Marietta, GA",0,8,1,1.0,5/27/2015,"Ordered herb salmon and shrimp scampi off of their combination dinner to go. My pasta was missing, no silverware, or napkins. I spent $70 in their establishment the least they could of done was give me silverware. Bread was hard as a rock. I normally don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory and this sealed the deal."
S D.,"Decatur, GA",6,21,,4.0,2/19/2015,"I had the herb-crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  It was simply delicious.  Need I speak of the cheesecake?   Being the to-go queen, I did not eat in the restaurant, but went inside to the bakery to get my order.  I love their attentive staff.  I was greeted with southern hospitality by the model-worthy hostesses, waiters passing by, and those who worked in the bakery.  I will be back!"
Kati A.,"Smyrna, GA",171,11,3,2.0,7/2/2014,"I really hate doing this but the experience we had at dinner the other night was extremely bad. To start off I work in the service industry and have for over 10 years... ( this may be my problem, I just want the same treatment I give to others) Anyways, I called to make reservations for a Tuesday evening at 8pm for 14 people, it was the gathering after my new husband and I tied the knot. We areived at 7 and had a cocktail then I got notified that our 14 was now 16. I went to let the host know at 7:30 that it was going to be 16..in which I was told ""well we will see what we can do"" ok, no prob. Here comes 8:45 with no word on the table, when asked we were told since we added two more people it will take longer. Ridiculous.  We then asked to speak to a manager and let him know the situation and he, again, told us the extra two people are what screwed everything up. Longer story short... we get seated at 9. We had a waiter and waitress. Isabella and a swrver who will remain nameless.. The only reason this post gets 2 stars is because isabella was incredibly sweet, polite and personable... the manager also took care of our apps which was amazing! The male server on the other hand should probably go try to find another job that does not include dealing in customer service. I have NEVER been out to dinner before and been waited on by someone so uninterested in their tables. I really hope his night got better. Not tobmention the amount of items that were forgotten was not acceptable. .at all. To end the long service we didn't leave the restaurant until 11:30. And nobody got dessert to eat there.  All in all....I hated writing this but sometimes situations like this need to be seen."
Zakiya L.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,6,,5.0,3/7/2016,"Our server was Staci and she did an excellent job. As a vegan I usually find it difficult to eat at restaurants that don't specialize in vegan foods, but the vegan options are very good!! I'm quite impressed!"
Marianne B.,"Decatur, GA",0,7,,2.0,4/15/2013,"First of all, pointing out the obvious...this place is a corporate CHAIN restaurant.  I typically avoid dining at this type of establishment, but opted to eat there anyway because it was convenient on this particular day.  Sat at the bar with a friend.  Service was slow and unfriendly.  The menu has WAY too much going on.  It took us at least 20 minutes to get through the menus and make a decision.  The bartender offered bread, and we accepted.  It wasn't complimentary, and they should let people know.  There was a charge for $2.95 for bread service on our bill.  My friend took her left overs to go and wanted to put the bread we hadn't eaten in her to-go box, but the bartender threw it away before she had the chance.  Disappointing, considering it was something we paid for.   Won't go back.  I knew better in the first place."
Duck 1.,"Buchanan, GA",3,26,11,3.0,3/8/2015,First time going.....not so thrilled with it?! I did not like the food I ordered at all   The atmosphere was really nice! Maybe if we go back I will try something different might be better. Big huge piece of cheesecake though
David L.,"Macon, GA",0,2,,3.0,5/25/2015,between a 6-7/10 for this place i mean it is pretty good people rant and rave about the cheese cake factory and for good reason because it's good but it does seem like everything is like 50% more expensive. The waiting bread was delicious and the Kobe beef burger i had which was actually reasonably prices was perfection. All in all in all a good experience.
Alex C.,"Atlanta, GA",85,833,54,3.0,10/6/2013,"Cheesecake Factory. Same old stuff. Watch out for cooler days though, they blast the AC regardless of the temperature outside so you end up FREEZING."
Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572,4.0,12/21/2012,"Our family decided to meet here at TCF outside of Cumberland Mall this past Sunday for lunch at noon. I had called earlier on the phone but they do not take reservations even if you are a party of  8. Upon arrival, I had to to circle around several times at the parking lot as it was very crowded. Plus the Christmas season around the corner did not help either. There are a few empty spots reserved for call-in-take-out orders where the staff will bring your meals to you at the assigned parking spots. That is always a plus if you don't have time to sit down. We are a party of 8 and we were seated pretty quickly at noon. It was a big surprise to me as I expected a long wait. Maybe I had been to TCF at  Buckhead way too long.  So I was very happy to find our seats right away. The waiter came to get our drink orders and later came with 2 baskets of bread. There were 2 different kinds of bread that came with the butter slices. For appetizers, we had Margherita Fresh Baked Flatbread. It had Mozzarella, tomato and sprinkled basil on it. The other Flatbread we had was the Wild Mushrooms Flatbread. It was filled with mushrooms, garlic, shallots and fresh herbs. Very yummy. For my main entree, I had the lunch size Luau Salad. It had slices of grilled chicken breast buried with mixed greens, cucumbers, onions, red & yellow peppers, carrots and crisp wontons with some nuts, all tossed in a light vinaigrette. I was hungry and cleaned my plate. My hubby had the Caesar Salad. It was the normal lettuce with croutons, Parmesan cheese and Caesar dressing. It was alright for him but no wow factor attached. My brother-in-law had Sausage and Broccolini Pasta as his entree. It had everything a guy would want - Italian sausage, tomato, fresh Broccolini, spinach and asparagus tossed with Penne pasta and Parmesan cheese. Yum!  It must be delicious because my BIL had a fairly clean plate at the end. My SIL had the Crab Hash from the Sunday Brunch menu. It had poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce on top of sauteed crab meat, red and yellow peppers, onions and potatoes. Please check out my pictures for a better idea. She said she enjoyed every bite of it. I am now hungry thinking of her meal as it is breakfast time now.  Of course I had to save room for my Cheesecake dessert. I had the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. It was a little too rich for me and I had to take it home with me. However, I did get a bite of my hubby's Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It was moist and delicious. The Caramel Mousse did it for me. My SIL had the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. The layered cream cheese in between was so good. Of course, I had to get a bite of that too. Overall, everyone had a nice dining experience including the kids. The waiter did come back twice to check on us. He had to adjust my tab since he charged me for an extra cup of hot tea which I did not order. No problem after the adjustment. Food was good, nice atmosphere and ambiance, attentive waiter and cheesecake is always calling my name. So I am coming back!  Yelp 27/365"
