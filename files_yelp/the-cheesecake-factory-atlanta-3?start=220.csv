Lisa G.,"Centre, AL",0,8,2,2.0,5/2/2015,Food ho hum no seasoning. Tasted like it had been reheated. Not worth my while to come back. Ridiculous menu. Why try to do everything?  Should cut menu by half maybe food would improve.
Melinda L.,"Carson, CA",3,31,7,3.0,6/26/2012,"I went here just to get a slice of overly priced low-carb cheesecake. Since I didn't pay for it, it was not overly priced. So maybe I should take that back. :-)  Anyway, there is much to choose from. I just stick with what I know I will like. I love the ambiance of TCF (the lack of light). It quite noisy all the time no matter which one you go and I have been many different ones over 15yrs but I can deal with that. So with TCF you know what you are going to get, nothing great but the same ol goodness you have always expected."
T C.,"Chicago, IL",0,83,16,2.0,8/4/2015,"Came here this weekend and I am giving it 2 stars. Giving it 2 stars bc valet parking was cheap compared to valet parking in chicago..Almost gave it 1 star.. Looking from the outside this place seemed like it was going to be a great experience. Normally if a restaurant is crowded thats a good sign and you expect things to go well. HAH, not here. It took the server over 20 mins to bring out the bread( had to ask twice) and the Chef took over 35 mins to cook broccoli. The server appeared to have an attitude and the manager seem to not give a care either. With all the customers this place has these reviews probably dont mean anything to the owner of this Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. If you come here be prepared to wait, wait, wait and wait some more..The sad thing is, I have been to restaurants that are busy and the manager knows how to keep the food coming in a timely manner.. NOT HERE.. I wont return no time soon. The only tip I gave to the server was.... ""FIND ANOTHER JOB""!bc it takes skills to work in a busy/stressful environment when serving food.."
Travis B.,"Smyrna, GA",0,16,,1.0,11/20/2014,"Terrible service on several occasions great food, but I left boiling with agitation and lighter in the pocket.. Place would be 5 stars with average service, but they are not cutting it."
F S.,"Austin, TX",0,9,1,1.0,8/3/2014,"The service is terrible!!! After we were seated, it took a long time for our waiter to come and take drink orders. He didn't seem to care or help out with any substitutions, being vegetatian, if I am paying the same price for an item to take out the meat, you would think asking get more veggies added wouldn't be a problem..not the case. I guess he didn't care to give a great service since we didn't order a lot of food or their disgustingly huge cheesecakes so he figured his tip wasn't going to be much! Needless to say, food is not great enough to come back for a horrible service. Btw, wish they would consider adding cheesecake shooters..or in a much smaller portion for people who would like to try desert without getting diabetes."
Elinor A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,3.0,11/1/2014,"We waited an hour after we were told that the waiting time will be 40 minuets.  The salad came with no dressing, the drinks came after we started eating and ask about our drinks... The bread came after we finished our food and were ready to go.  My daughter asked for Parmesan on her pasta, it came 20 min later, and her pasta was cold already.  However, We are eating a lot in that location, but this is the first time it happened."
Panseh T.,"Marietta, GA",0,1,,4.0,10/22/2015,"One of my favorite chain restaurants . Went there for my birthday last month . We got there little bit after 8pm . It was very full . Food was delicious . However, service was a little slow being a not so busy night . Will visit again though ."
Stefan D.,"Greenville, SC",1,19,1,5.0,7/20/2015,Cheesecake factory is always good and delicious food all over the country. If we don't know what we want to eat for dinner we go to a cheesecake factory and everybody gets what we want.
Kelly H.,"Fleetwood, NC",0,3,,4.0,8/22/2015,"My wife and I waited only about 2 minutes after being told approximately 10 minutes, on a busy Friday night nonetheless. Our experience only got better from there, the service was fast and friendly. We had amazing appetizers, with the egg roll sampler and the pretzel crusted chicken! Both were something to write home about, and we will be joining y'all again when we visit Atlanta. My only complaint is the lighting is very dim and hard to see the menu."
Marcia A.,"Powder Springs, GA",5,4,1,2.0,8/16/2014,"Went this evening with the family.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a hostess who clearly has no enthusiasm for people or her job.  She didn't smile and barely made eye contact.  As I surveyed the staff, I saw the gloomiest crews of wait staff I think I've ever seen.  No smiles, no pleasant greetings, the total opposite. Everyone looked angry.  So, so much for atmosphere.  Our waiter was pretty ho hum about taking care of us but luckily his shift was up and early in he was replaced with someone who had a bit more enthusiasm for his job.  Interestingly enough my daughter had pointed him out earlier as the only one in the place (on the staff) who was smiling.  So we lucked up and got him as a waiter, he did a pretty good job of being attentive, too.   As you  probably know, the menu is massive.  They have plenty to choose from, which always worries me in a restaurant.  We ordered Calamari, Edamame, Chicken Picatta, Seafood gumbo, salmon salad, 4 cheese lasagne with chicken and 3 different kinds of cheesecake - vanilla bean, oreo cookie and classic/strawberry.  First the appetizers and dinner was a big disappointment.  My daughter enjoyed her 4 cheese lasagne but the rest of us kept trying to add salt because it was so bland.  The chicken picatta had none of that lemony dill flavor you expect, even though it was covered in lemons and capers.  The salad had to be doused w/more salad dressing and the salmon hit with table salt. The gumbo was spicy but that was all. It was pretty...well, ""Meh"".  The bright spot was the cheesecake.  We all enjoyed our cheesecake.  The oreo cookie was everyone's favorite.  It was huge and super rich. If you're a chocolate lover, this is for you.  The vanilla bean was subtle and really delicious.  It wasn't overly rich and slightly smaller than the others but there was plenty and it  didn't leave you feeling like you'd over indulged.  The plain cheesecake w/strawberry was great, too.  Exactly what you expect in a classic. The cheesecake factory certainly doesn't skimp on portion sizes but if the food is bland and tasteless, who cares how much they give you.  We havet to go boxes in the fridge because I figure I can doctor it up and make it tasty. The truth is it will probably sit in the fridge until I finally toss it out. I'd go again for drinks and dessert but I'd have dinner somewhere else and if a friendly, hospitable, upbeat wait staff is important to you, skip this place altogether.  Lots of places make good cheesecake."
Dion B.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,4.0,8/9/2015,My family has visited Cheesecake Factory while on vacation for the past 10+ years. This was our first time in Atlanta. The food was so good that we went back a second time
Miss O.,"Snellville, GA",90,29,28,5.0,5/9/2015,super good!! came here for the first time for my bestie's flirty thirty back in feb 2015 and fell in love with the macaroni and cheese balls...i kept coming back just for this!
Shana B.,"Atlanta, GA",89,174,11,2.0,1/8/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is usually a fun experience with over 300 menu items to choose from and great desserts to try after dinner. However, our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was a disappointing to say the least. The waitress seriously needed to be fired. If I had a dollar for every item that she forgot while she was serving our food, we would have gotten a free meal. When we finally got our food, we were satisfied but it took such a long for the waitress to bring the food out. I also ordered cheesecake as well and I think the waitress mixed up the cheesecake order but we were were so exhausted after complaining so much that we kept whatever she brought us.  In terms of our food, I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and it came with fries. I loved the sandwich and would order it again. As I mentioned earlier, the food was good but the service was AWFUL!!! Perhaps if we had a different waiter/waitress, we would have had a better experience."
Christian H.,"Smyrna, GA",13,48,,4.0,1/24/2012,"The menu is huge, everything I have tried has been delicious, and the prices are pretty good.   The down side is that the place is packed at peak hours and they do not do reservations.  So plan on putting your name in and walking around the mall for 30 minutes or something.  If you have a large group plan on an even longer wait and get your name on the list about an hour and a half beforehand.   The drinks are also very expensive compared to the menu prices.  My wife paid $10 for a standard mixed drink, FML.   Other than the wait time and expensive drinks the CF is a great place for groups or a couple due to the huge menu and reasonable prices.   Accept the wait time, don't buy alcohol, enjoy the food."
Sarah W.,"Beaufort, SC",0,20,,4.0,8/9/2014,I have been here once. I had grilled salmon and the red velvet cake cheesecake for dessert. The waiter we had was good and so was the service.  It was a decent experience overall.
Tunicia W.,"Atlanta, GA",530,276,85,2.0,8/6/2013,"I have never felt compelled to write about my experiences at Cheesecake factory but this time is an exception. And not a good exception. I understood that National Cheesecake Day would understandably be a busy day and I expected a long wait to be seated. That part wasn't as bad as I thought. I was quoted an accurate wait time. The bad part was our service. I cannot think of the young man's name that waited on us . That's how crappy our service was. When we were seated he did come immediately to the table and took our drink order. We only ordered water and coke zero. That took 10 minutes in itself. My grandma said he must have placed us on a low priority since we didn't order expensive drinks. When he did come back to our table he did have bread with him which was a plus so I figured he would be very efficient. I thought wrong.  Once our order was taken we never received anymore bread, was never asked if we wanted anymore. I was lucky to get a refill on my water. The expeditor brought out our food. Our waiter almost passed our table before he realized the food was there to ask if we needed anything else. After that, he didn't come back to the table within a span on 20 minutes to ask if our food was okay or even to ask if we wanted to go on and order our cheesecake. I grew so irritated I just got up and ordered my cheesecake from the takeout line. I have worked food service before in every level imaginable, from hostess to manager. So I always try to give the benefit of the doubt on an exceptionally busy day. But when it seems like our table was a second thought to our waiter, that's a whole another thing. This location is so inconsistent. I've either had excellent service here or crappy service. Never a happy medium. #Yelp100"
Tim G.,"Franklin, TN",419,357,26,5.0,1/1/2014,We love Cheesecake factory but our diet doesn't.  Very easy to overeat and feel blah when you are done...but it is so worth it!
Diana B.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",430,132,260,4.0,6/19/2013,"There is lots of great sweets!  If you love cheesecake, then this is the right place for you.  I have an amazing piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake.  It was huge - no way to eat it all at once.   It was my first Cheesecake Factory, but I would return."
Claire M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,,4.0,10/24/2013,"Only 2 trips to this location, food is great, service was a miss and then a hit. Pricey, but a nice treat. They can count on me to return!"
Jennifer N.,"Atlanta, GA",136,80,44,5.0,10/22/2013,"Hey, what can I say? The place has something for everyone and has been a desert spot for me and my family for years.  I don't visit many chains but who can say no to cheesecake? The beef sliders and the French vanilla cheesecake are always my faves.  If you love chocolate like I do, the Godiva cheesecake is for you.  Other than that they offer everything from pizzas to pasta dishes to salads and it is all fine some of it is really great, some average but overall the food is good and a great place for large groups and families."
