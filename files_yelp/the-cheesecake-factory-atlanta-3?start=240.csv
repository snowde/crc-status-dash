Scott C.,"Atlanta, GA",15,146,6,1.0,3/19/2011,Stopped here with friends after a show at the Cobb Energy Center.  Dark and mediocre.  So dark I had to whip out my phone install a flashlight app to read the menu. The server was obviously disappointed when he found out we were just doing drinks and dessert.  The service was obviously disappointing as well.  However he did not fail to add on an 18% gratuity.
Ula H.,"Atlanta, GA",120,75,30,4.0,7/16/2013,"It's always busy, but the wait isn't bad. The food was good compared to the last Cheescake Factory I went to. The take-out is also quick. The waitress I've had were sweet and attentive."
Amy T.,"Acworth, GA",34,173,3,2.0,9/5/2011,"I usually enjoy Cheesecake Factory, but our dinner last night was disappointing and S L O W as molasses in winter!  Our server was polite friendly and apologetic, but it just couldn't compensate for the slowness.  The restaurant seemed to be out of everything too - no sangria, no butter for the bread, and no raspberry white chocolate cheesecake.  I fault management for those things, as that is just a complete failure to plan. Our meals were good, but again, not worth the wait or the slow service.  Next time we're at Cumberland, I think we'll hit Maggiano's or just head to Perimeter if we want Cheesecake Factory.  Perimeter seems to be more on top of things."
Zach P.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,4.0,4/22/2014,I took my wife here for our 7 year anniversary. It did not disappoint! We enjoyed a great meal for less than $50. Classy dining experience w/o a huge price tag. We will be back!
Jackie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",852,371,537,4.0,7/14/2009,"Cheesecake Factory -  CF is good everywhere. In Particular, I ordered the Chicken Piccatta here and it was phenomenal! It was soooooo good. This CF is packed as hell like everyother CF all over the world. 4 stars. Service was good even tho it was packed!"
Jhennyfer C.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",52,14,,2.0,2/17/2015,"I came here with my mom for her co workers birthday lunch. We were both excited since we've never eaten here before. The service was quick and we ordered waters and looked over the menus. The menu is huge and seems to have some delicious options. I ordered a fettuccini with chicken and my mom ordered a chicken salad sandwich, tortilla soup and a side salad. When we received our waters, no one had a single ice cube in their cup and the cups look absolutely filthy. They're plastic and ""clear"" but they look yellow. Odd but I was thirsty so I drank it anyway. A few of the ladies ordered some hot tea and one ordered a cappuccino which was cold when she received it. She asked for a new one and the server accommodated her with a new one. We received our food and one of ladies found 2 hairs on her meal and I wasn't impressed with the chicken. It seems the chicken was almost chewy. It made me nervous it wasn't cooked all the way. I moved the chicken to the side and just ate the noodles which were delicious. I don't like complaining about food at restaurants so I just ate what I could. Once I asked for a refill on my water, i again received only water and not a single ice cube. Are we having a recession on ice? Oh well. Like I said, I was thirsty so I just drank it. The manager approached us and apologized about the hair in the meal. Last, we ordered some dessert for the birthday girl which was the tiramisu cheesecake and that was okay. Overall, the restaurant is awesome looking and clean. The servers are attentive but the food quality needs some serious work."
Jai R.,"Atlanta, GA",252,338,159,3.0,8/8/2011,"It's a restaurant chain so I can't say that I am ever too thrilled about going to the Cheesecake Factory.  But in all honesty it has to be one of the best chains around. I think this place is great for groups and even better for picky eaters.  They have an extensive menu that allows for everyone to find something.  The staff is usually friendly, well versed and know the menu inside out.  I have no complaints about service of cleanliness of the Cumberland location or any of them for that matter.  This chain is really as carbon copied as the rest.  In my opinion if you have been to one of them you have been to them all.  You should never walk away without being satisfied with your service, they really aim to please. I will gloat about their lemon drop martinis though.  They are my favorite!  Also, being that over the years I have tried several cheesecakes I recommend the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (in season)."
Eddie B.,"Marietta, GA",15,6,3,5.0,12/7/2014,"Food was good. Nothing that blew me away, it was regular good ol cheesecake factory food. Service= attentive and relaxed, the place is enormous so your not getting rushed outta here anytime soon. Reason for review = I had forgotten my money clip with ID and credit card and 250 cash. Service picked it up and held it for me for 3 days!!! I called retracing my steps and to my surprise manager Ross was there to deliver the good news... honest people, good food, good service, beautiful place= no reason why I shouldn't be back. Ni reason why you shouldn't try it out.."
Joyce F.,"Denver, CO",91,1501,203,4.0,6/8/2011,Funny how our group came to CF.  We went to PF Chang's next door but the wait was 45 minutes so we walked next door for the 5 minute wait at CF.  Half of our group went to CF last night but didn't mind going two days in a row.  We ordered the crab balls and corn fritters.  Both were good and I really liked the sauces.   I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and liked it.  The grilled garlic was delicious.
Luckie D.,"Atlanta, GA",69,625,487,3.0,7/20/2011,Four Stars because: Nice vibe...although a wee bit noisy Friendly waiter Clean surroundings Quick service Good people watching and the Santa Fe Salad is amazing!!!! You will see me again.
Ashley N.,"Atlanta, GA",172,120,266,2.0,6/10/2014,"I never thought I'd give a The Cheesecake Factory 2 stars! We got there at 8:45 pm on a Tuesday night and there was a wait even though plenty of tables were open. After 15 minutes we got seated. We sat for 10 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged us. He saw our menu's were closed and skipped straight to ""are you guys ready to order?"" We ordered, and he didn't write it down. Therefore, my order of the appetizer ceaser salad with chicken came out as the dinner portion ceaser salad with no chicken and I had to send it back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, the person I was with ordered the Factory Chopped Salad which she and I both have had many, many times at the North Point Mall location. This salad looked nothing like what we were used too. The chicken was dried out. There was no avocado to be found and the lettuce wasn't even chopped for the CHOPPED salad! I finally got the correct ceaser salad. Once it was dropped off we didn't see the waiter again to be able to ask for our water glasses refilled. All-in-all not the experience I expect when I go to a The Cheesecake Factory."
Arpana W.,"Memphis, TN",49,63,42,3.0,4/2/2013,"After an exhausting shopping trip to the Cumberland mall, I decided to try out the Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner.  I like the fact that there is so much to choose at this chain restaurant - and it's usually all pretty good.  I did get an excellent suggestion from my waiter - the Lemon Herb Chicken - but her rare appearance at my table in the 2 hours I was there ruined the experience.  I haven't eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in years and I was disappointed that I didn't venture out to a local restaurant instead."
Kenya J.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,44,2,4.0,8/27/2013,"Ok so the whole time I lived in Atlanta, I never went to this place. I went home this past weekend. Me & one of my ever-faithful road girls took me here. We went in the afternoon on 8/24, so it wasn't that crowded. Our server, Monique (Mo!) was very helpful & friendly. My drink was a strawberry lemonade. My appetizer was crab wontons. The actual meal was herb-crusted salmon, mashed potatoes & steamed asparagus. My friend had salmon egg rolls for her appetizer & some kind of chicken/sun-dried tomato/fettucini pasta dish. We were both too full for cheesecake! Alls I know is that I will definitely being going to the Cheesecake Factory here in the DC area when I get the chance and THIS time, I'll get a piece of cheesecake to go."
Danielle H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,9,,1.0,1/28/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but not this location. My friends and I had the absolute worst experience ever! The other handful of times were also bad but this particular visit was awful. We waited forever which we expected but then our server took 15 minutes to come take our drink order, no hi how are you sorry for the wait. He popped up said drinks and walked off. Next the drinks took another 10 mins. We had to catch him back to order when he tried to run away. We never saw him again, a different person brought our food. We never got the bread! He brought tiny boxes and caught w us over whether it would fit. We didn't get a bye have a good night either after making eye contact...I shouldn't have tipped but I felt bad... Never coming back"
Kisente F.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,111,61,4.0,4/15/2013,"I never knew Cheesecake Factory was a restaurant until I came here. The first Cheesecake Factory I visited was in Las Vegas and it only sale cheesecakes. Anyway, the restaurant in here is attached to the mall. It has a nice decor and the cheesecakes are amazing as always."
Will E.,"Atlanta, GA",2,99,1,2.0,3/23/2013,Went here on a saturday so they were at full capacity.  We were told it'd be 20 minutes.  An hour and half later we hadnt been called yet.  Went and talked to them and were told our beeper indicator whatever you want to call it must be broken.  Told the manager and he replied ill make sure to take iy out of service...
Benny B.,"Philadelphia, PA",38,56,37,1.0,6/5/2010,"Didn't get to enjoy the dining experience in this restaurant.  We drove 30 minutes in the rain to Marietta.  The host told us to have a seat and wait in the lobby.  He would call us when a table was open.  There was one other party waiting for a table.  It took 15 minutes after we got there for those people to be seated.  About 30 minutes later another couple showed up and they were seated before us.  At that point I asked the host how much longer it was going to be. He said ""A table is being cleared right now.  It should be a few more moments.""  30 minutes later still no table, I'm pissed and we decide to get a cheesecake to go.  It was at this point this little motherfer had the nerve to ask me if we had been seated.  It took everything in me not to slap him into next week.  We left (hungry) and went to TGIF."
Atlanta T.,"Atlanta, GA",10,17,1,3.0,7/8/2013,"We love Cheesecake and go every time we are back in ATL.  This one was pretty good with, good service. I had the pasta alfredo and 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE, it was freakin awesome....."
Rani C.,"Atlanta, GA",33,131,,1.0,6/23/2010,"This is the second time we've come to this place. Second time we left before ordering. After sitting there for about 10 minutes, no one greeted us, took our drink order. Nothing. Somebody put napkins down but left before we could say anything.  Too loud. Lights got dimmed and it was too dark. Just not a conducive place to relax and eat dinner."
Christine S.,"Atlanta, GA",2,26,6,4.0,1/25/2011,"Before I knew what the Cheesecake Factory was, I always believed it to be a dessert place. Boy, was I wrong! All of the food was excellent and I have been pestering people to go with me ever since my last trip. Parking is a little difficult to figure out for first-time-goers, but once you figure out where to turn, you're good to go. The atmosphere is excellent and a place where you can dress nicely and still feel comfortable. The menu is the perfect size; the selection is small enough to where you're not finding it super difficult to order, but there is still plenty to choose from. I could hardly decide what I wanted, on the hand, so I left the restaurant after eating a giant drink, two appetizers, one entrée, and one scrumptious dessert. For just me, my bill came out around $50, which isn't too bad for a ""nice"" dinner."
