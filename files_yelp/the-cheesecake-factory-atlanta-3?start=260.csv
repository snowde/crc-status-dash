Jillian B.,"Chilmark, MA",49,56,6,4.0,1/13/2013,"The food was superb! The service was a little slow and it took several minutes for our waiter to come around after trying to ge his attention for what seemed like forever, but he was super friendly! Great lunch spot!"
Jennifer V.,"Mableton, GA",12,87,,5.0,8/25/2012,"We love TCF. We have always gotten amazing service here as well as amazing food. The skinnylishious menu is my favorite part. I like to order a skinny dish and then binge on cheesecake!! My favorite is the skinny pasta. It's absolutely delicious, unlike other restaurants with skinny menus. My favorite cheesecake is the hersey's candy bar one :) It's two pieces of amazing chocolate cake (frosted), chocolate cheesecake in between, and chocolate chips on the edge. It's absolutely incredible!"
Mitchell W.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,5,,1.0,9/8/2014,"My family and I just left this location. We had not been to any Cheesecake Factory in many years. They have really gone down hill. The service at this location was terrible. It was extremely slow, and ALL of the food we ordered was bland and overcooked. I would not recommend The Cheesecake Factory for anything other than take-out cheesecake...and we haven't made it home to taste that yet. Hopefully, the cheesecake is still as good as I remember."
Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,2.0,2/21/2012,"The food at this particular Cheesecake Factory was up to their usual standards but that was about it. I think our first mistake was going here on a Saturday night although even after taking that into consideration, this place was a madhouse,LOL. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's on weekends and they weren't as bad as this was....I guess I'm just trying to say it was extremely crowded. The service here (or at least our particular server) left a lot to be desired also. I had to flag down another server on two different occasions just to get our drinks refilled and to get some more bread. Additionally, our server never came back to see how we were doing.....and all of this was reflected in the tip I left for her:) Anyways, good food as always but crappy service. I doubt we'll be going back to this location, the Alpharetta location is far superior as far as their customer service goes."
Anna L.,"Smyrna, GA",34,16,,4.0,5/9/2011,"I've been here numerous time and its never disappointed. The only time I was getting upset it was mother's day because it was packed and had to wait 2 hours, but hey...it was mother's day!!  Service for me has been good every time and food is always good and plenty.  The last 4 times I have ordered the chicken Madeira, its so good!!!!  Can't get tired of this dish. The mashed potatoes are perfect, madeira sauce is so exquisite and goes perfect with the chicken topped with melted cheese! And of course you have the asparagus to balance it out.    The only bad thing are the prices, they are a little to expensive but its worth it!  I also like their cheescake, there a bit too sweet and sugary for my taste but I tend to share it or save some for later."
Michael W.,"Atlanta, GA",10,7,3,5.0,1/18/2012,"I really had a great experience last night at the Cheesecake Factory, the atmosphere and ambience was on point, It was hard to chose what I wanted to eat because it's so much good food on the menu so my girlfriend and I shared plates and really enjoyed ourselves.  I see why they've been around all these years."
Ray H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,37,,1.0,4/15/2014,"From being ignored at the hostess stand, to a wilted salad that tasted as if it had been sitting out all day, to a club sandwich that had 3/4 inch thick, rock hard tomato slices, this place was a total disappointment. I am amazed at how busy and expensive this place is. I would rather have had fast food, at least you get your money's worth."
David P.,"Dublin, GA",29,226,19,4.0,6/7/2012,If you can find a place to park after 530pm it is worth going to.  I had a party of 8 and no one had a bad meal choice.  The reeces cup cheesecake was the favorite in my group.  Service was decent even with all the guest.
Stephanie R.,"Marietta, GA",71,132,11,3.0,9/22/2009,"Warning: I'm a little opinionated in this review. If you're a fan of CF, please don't be offended.  The Cheesecake Factory is one of those unoriginal first date places; classy and safe, but overdone (in my book).  That being said, it serves as a wonderful ""date place"". You know, once you two get to know each other, find out it works, and have finally gotten comfortable together. I recently ""secret shopped"" the Cheesecake Factory near Cumberland Mall. Little would they suspect the two girls in their upper 20's would be ""shopping them"". Anyway, the point of mentioning ""secret shopped"" is to note that I paid close attention to detail.  We walked in the door, up to the host stand, and waited for her to get off the phone. I'm fairly certain it was not a personal call but we did wait a minute.  We were sat and Eli, her 1 year old, got a high chair. We fiddled with Eli for a bit. after 5minutes had passed my friend and I realized it was happening all over again. We were forgotten!!! No drinks, no water, no nada! Ugh. After looking around a bit and just a little bewildered, Alex came to our table. He took our drink order and informed us he was not our server, Renee will be right out. (Suuuure.) However, after that little episode, lunch/dinner turned out to be superb. We split a lunch size fettucini with sun-dried tomatoes . (Renee warned us some people find the pasta to be bland. It is a hit or miss dish. It was a hit dish with us, but we both love sun-dried tomatoes.) The guacamole appetizer was TO DIE for. Yum!   Of course, since we were at the Cheesecake Factory, we had to have cheesecake. I have four words for you:  ""White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake"" Heaven! Overall, don't come here between 3:00pm to dinner hours. The servers aren't as attentive. However, Alex gets props (we're requesting him next time we come) and the food is delicious. If you like a quieter Cheesecake Factory and don't mind having a little longer wait time at your seats, this is a good time to come.  Additionally, I didn't notice their Health Code Score...so I can't report on that. Sorry! Yumminess!!! I'll come back on a fourth date."
Nancy R.,"Atlanta, GA",77,382,2,4.0,3/21/2010,"I usually don't review chain restaurants, but I decided that I needed to on this one.  First of all, the parking lot is always full and so hard to find a parking spot.  Valet for $6 may be the way to go.  Service was so slow, but friendly.  He took forever for our complimentary bread.  It came out with our entrees. FOOD:  Cheesecake Factory always has enormous amounts of good food.  I had the Chinese Cashew Chicken Salad with a side of french fries with iced green tea.  The abundant mound of salad was full of lettuce, cashews, chicken with sprinkles of cilantro, sliced carrots, and sliced fried wontons.  This salad had a nice crunch added to the sweetness of the dressing.  The side of french fries were more like an order of fries for an entree.  The iced green tea had a refreshing minty taste to it.  Of course, we had the red velvet cheesecake which was a nice portion to share and a great ending to our meal."
Anna B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,7/20/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I called in to place a pretty small take out order for 2 people. They told me my order would be ready 30 minutes after I placed it so I arrived right on time. I pulled into the to go parking and called the curbside take out number where I was transferred over to the bakery hold music. 5 minutes later no one answered. Then I called in again and the same thing happened so I went inside the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. The manager said he would be right back with my food ... 20 minutes later he ushered me over to the to go area. Even though I expressed how frustrated I was with the terrible service, the manager did not comp anything and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. I did not get his name but he is bald and has a NY/NJ accent. When I finally got back to my office our food was cold and was clearly sitting out for a while. Also half of the lettuce on the thai lettuce wraps was wilted. Checking out a customer with a to go order should be very simple.   The Cumberland Malls Cheesecake Factory is far too disorganized to handle this simple task and showed no regard for making things right with their customers. I will not be returning to this location."
Chuck T.,"Valparaiso, IN",5,44,5,5.0,9/19/2012,"I love their Chicken Alfrado, The cheescake, we already know it good. The service was great  My only complaint.  I want one closer to my house"
William H.,"Washington, DC",109,360,80,3.0,3/16/2010,"Food was very good, service as well.  the place is noisy, but the location worked well. The Cumberland Mall is a 2nd tier mall, but having a choice of nice places to eat like this is a good addition"
Jay W.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,28,7,5.0,3/5/2012,"Fried Mac n' Cheese is to die for! Also, try the Buffalo Blasts, and the Chicken Caesar salad; you can't go wrong. Always crowded, though."
amanda m.,"Marietta, GA",1,18,2,1.0,8/25/2012,"The cheesecake is awesome. Everything else on the menu is gross. I went last night, there were 8 of us. I ordered the herb encrusted salmon w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was terrible. The salmon was covered in a terrible slimey green 'herb', the asparagus was drowning in a terrible lemon sauce and the mashed potatoes was cold. My mom had the shepherds pie and my sister had the Diane Steak and Shrimp. Both my mom's and sister's food tasted the same because of some wine sauce. Both of their entrees tasted like a Lean Cuisine. Very disappointing. I tried some of  a cheeseburger and that was good. I got there at 7:15 and put my name and in we were finally sat at 8:40. I will say that the hostesses and our server were really nice. The food just sucked.   If you go to Cheesecake Factory, have low expectations,stick to a burger and a slice of cheesecake and you'll be good."
Tom N.,"Woodstock, GA",51,362,204,3.0,11/3/2011,For the love of god how many people come here on their birthday. I mean seriously enough is enough it was a constant chorus of happy birthday to you! The food was pretty good I just got a burger and fries and they were tasty. 10.50 for a simple cheeseburger is expensive but it was big and it was good. Compared to to other items on the menu I was a cheap date haha. I don't eat cheesecake but I assume they are good because it seems that's the main reason people come here. The service was great and the fried mac n cheese was a pretty cool surprise. I wouldn't go back because I wanted to but I'm sure somebody I know will have their birthday here. UGH seriously they should check IDS!
Ellie G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,2.0,2/16/2013,"I recently went  here with a friend and her son.She had ordered a simple Mac-n-cheese for him which the waitress indicated that they could make it and serve the same. We waited for 45 mins before we lost our patience and requested his food at least as he was getting hungry and wanted to leave. We were then told by the waitress that she had just placed the order. we then called for the manager who spoke very rudely. When my friend asked to cancel the food, he asked if he should then eat the food when it is ready. Disgusted by the attitude and the service and not wanting to ruin our evening further by creating a scene, my friend asked  asked for the food which arrived after 5 minutes (The food was nothing great and we felt really miserable that we waited so long for the same). I ended up paying $98+ and still left feeling MISERABLE.  I have been a customer of Cheesecake allover (Where I enjoyed excellent service and food) and on my recent move to Atlanta started visiting here for the first time. This is the WORST restaurant experience ever (Not just at Cheesecake). I will never again dine at this location again."
Jeanne V.,"Champaign, IL",0,9,,2.0,6/4/2012,The Cheesecake Factory suffers from menu overload. It tries to offer something for everyone and the food is just average and pricey. It is also usually very noisy.
Susan K.,"Marietta, GA",0,21,,5.0,2/27/2012,"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but this was very good.  Met some friends last Saturday around 1:00 pm and we had no trouble getting seated right away.  The four of us each ordered something different and everything was good considering the extensive menu not always sure an establishment can do that many items well. Watched a lot of what was delivered around us and all the portions are more than ample, it's hard to think about desert.  We took our deserts to go and enjoyed them much more the next day after such big portions of lunch.  The offer a low carb cheesecake, nice. Our sever was super nice, always willing to recommend items or explain items on the menu.  I was impressed that we never felt rushed even though there seemed to be many people waiting by the time we left.  The decor is quite impressive too."
S W.,"Smyrna, GA",25,234,77,2.0,9/5/2011,Crappy food for a simple palate. Ugh.
