Lorraine C.,"Kingston, GA",36,1,,1.0,3/31/2014,"Sunday, March 23, 2014, I took my daughter and 8 of her friends to the Cumberland Mall Location to celebrate her 18th birthday.   My first sense of displeasure: no reservation for large parties which resulted in a 2 1/2 wait for a table. My second sense of displeasure: the hostess was somewhat rude when asked questions. Yet, she took the time to hold conversations with ""friends"" who passed by as they were leaving. My third sense of displeasure: The same rude hostess seated another large party that came in AFTER I did before me.  It took me complaining to TWO managers to get us seated. My fourth sense of displeasure: Our waitress , Sandy B.  It was 5 minutes before she acknowledged us. She asked us for our drink orders, left before we could utter the words ""we're ready to order now"" as we had a loooong wait and knew what we wanted.  She came and sat the drinks down and left again.  However, she was very attentive to the table across from us.  I had to raise my voice  to get her attention as she yet again passed our table so that we could place our orders.  When she finally came to take the order, one of my party put in a special request ""ABSOLUTELY NO TOMATOES"" on her burger.   When our food finally arrived, my pasta dish was overcooked (noodles clumped together and dry); the special request ignored. I was snippily told that the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was not a ""saucy"" dish.  and grudgingly offered to have a new one prepared.  When told about the tomato, she, instead of apologizing for HER mistake in not forwarding the request, asked whether or not no tomato was requested.  As she walked away, I asked her to make sure that a new turkey burger was prepared and the tomato not simply be removed as the party was allergic, she mouthed ""B&*^H"". Because I had ""impressionable youths"" with me, I did not create a scene. I simply left her a note explaining how I felt about her service.  Needless to say, my daughter's 18th birthday dinner did not turn out as she expected.  I should have gone next door to Maggiano's or down the street to Copeland's and been better served and appreciated!  We paid our tab and left knowing the Cumberland location would not get another dime out of us."
Tara H.,"Acworth, GA",33,133,27,4.0,9/26/2008,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary last night.  We've been here before, usually with a large group, and the food is great, so that's why we chose it.  We weren't disappointed either! We started our meal with an appetizer for fried macaroni & cheese.  This stuff is TO DIE for.  It is so creamy with a nice coating of bread crumbs.  They bring out 4 baseball sized balls (maybe a bit smaller) with some marinara sauce & cheese.  It's enough to share amongst 4 people, but since it was just the two of us, we had two each!   I also tried a type of flavored unsweetened tea that they have.  It's a citrussy flavor.  Our waitress told me that she'd bring me a glass to try before she rang it in because some people love it and some people hate it.  I was one of the ones who hate it, so I stuck to diet coke.  It had a very strong flavor, almost indescribable, but it was not a good indescribable! For dinner, I had the Pasta da Vinci.  I get it every time I go!  It's SO good.  It's penne pasta w/ mushrooms and chicken in a Madeira wine sauce.  It is my favorite!  it's very filling two, and it's enough for two meals.  My husband had the Chicken Madeira, which he loves!  It is chicken topped with asparagus and mozzarella cheese with a mushroom Madeira sauce.  It's a bit sweet for my liking, but it's not bad.  It's also served with mashed potatoes. Now, on to the best part!  Dessert!!  My husband had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake (which he gets every time) and I had something new.  It was a pistachio/chocolate swirl cheesecake!  It was so rich and good!  I really like the whipped cream that they serve with their cheesecake, I swear they put some kind of drug in it! Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!! The menu also notes that they serve breakfast all day now!  I'm sure that will appeal to some folks!  They do have valet parking (which is $6), but it's not really that big of a parking lot, so you should be able to get away with just parking a short distance and walking over!  We had a great anniversary dinner, despite someone falling asleep at a table nearby, leading the staff to try to wake him up for about 5 minutes.  In the end, he was fine.. so much so, in fact, that he was trying to hit on the hostess!! Classic!!"
Erik B.,"Kennesaw, GA",3,21,12,4.0,7/29/2013,Have been here several times. Customer service is great but not perfect for a restaurant like this. It depends on who waits on you.
Chris B.,"Newnan, GA",17,9,12,5.0,11/17/2013,"Lived in GA all my life and the first time I've ever been to the cheesecake factory was a few weeks ago.  I honestly regret not experiencing the delicious eat much sooner.  I will admit if you're indecisive about food (like myself sometimes) because there is so many delicious options to choose from, then this restaurant may not be for you unless you go with someone who will choose a menu item for yourself.  Atmosphere for this location was excellent.  Almost made me feel like I was in an elaborate restaurant on a cruise ship.  I was stuck between 5 menu items and ended up choosing the grande burrito for some odd reason.  First off, it is very much grande (HUGE).  I honestly did not expect that much food for the price, because most restaurants skimp and you pay for the name or atmosphere of the restaurant.  Not here, very reasonably priced for the portions served, atmosphere, and more importantly QUALITY of food served here! I went during the week around 7-8 so it was a reasonable wait of 5-10 min.  Also ordered some cheesecake (Reese) which was excellent.  I'd have to agree with the title of the restaurant because all of the cheesecake choices looked phenomenal.  While the menu is very diverse, from an assortment of chicken entrees, italian dishes, cheesecakes, sea-food, hamburgers, mexican dishes, etc...it is definitely worth a try especially if you have been holding out as many years as myself.  The service was fast and our server was very friendly/knowledgeable of their menu.  I would highly recommend to anyone in the area to try this delicious eat."
Brittany S.,"Detroit, MI",35,59,9,4.0,5/24/2008,"The waitress I had on Friday SUCKED but...here is my opinion on the foods I've tried at this particular Cheesecake:  Their Bistro Shrimp Pasta is to die for. It also provided me with 3 days of dinner. Nothing like stretching out your buck. (I did the Curbside pick-up for this one and I was pleased with the prompt service). Their Spinach Dip is wonderful. Just the right amount of spinach, cheese & artichoke :-) Their Fried Macaroni & Cheese is GREAT. And I hate macaroni & cheese.  I went on Friday and was looking for something light for my stomach. My dear vegan friend, Ain D., recommended their Portabella Sandwich...which is a portabella mushroom sandwich ""with herbs, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and spicy  mayonnaise."" Although they slapped the whole red onion on the sandwich, it was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!! Honestly, portabella mushrooms can pass as burgers if you're into healthy eating.  *Note: They do not carry Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake anymore.  Last but not least...the strawberry lemonade = liquid cr**k. It is simply addictive...but I can't and won't say no. One of my good friends from Motown USA  works here (he's a much better waiter by the way) and he plans on throwing a cup of that sweet goodness my way one day very soon. I can't wait."
Lori A.,"Woodstock, GA",3,7,,4.0,7/1/2011,Giovanni. Was our server. Great attitude. Food was great as usual.
Daniel F.,"Tucker, GA",0,24,,5.0,8/30/2013,"Amazing service and friendly staff, but the reason I come is because of the Macaroni and cheese burger.... Wow its heavenly."
D A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,1/25/2014,"Its a tasteless, greasy, pile of junk............... i will not suggest this to anyone........ the price is way too much for this kind of food.......... i will never go back to this place............service was ok and tables were greasy as their food"
Brigette G.,"Atlanta, GA",4,25,7,1.0,9/12/2012,"If you're looking for slow service and mediocre food, look no further!  A group of us went last night at about 6:30pm.  We were there til after 9 - not because we were sitting around gabbing, but because it took so long for the food to arrive.  My friend and her mother ordered an appetizer and an entree - both arrived at the same time.  I ordered a small side salad - someone may have spritzed some salad dressing on it, but I'm pretty sure the essence of vinaigrette was just the smell from the kitchen as the leaves were dry - but no one ever asked how the food was - they dropped it at the table and disappeared without a word.  Errol, our server, could be seen at other tables, but he didn't check on us until we waved him over.  Don't even bother ordering anything from the bar - they take FOREVER to arrive.  Errol perked up a bit when checks were passed around - maybe he remembered that he works for tips, but we certainly didn't help him out much there.  Won't be going back.  (I will say that they were helpful to my other friend who left her debit card at home & had her husband call it in to pay for her meal, but that was the most service we had all night)."
Lady N.,"Decatur, GA",8,149,135,5.0,1/20/2013,"The five stars is for the cheesecake! My favorite is the oreo cheesecake.  Cookies throughout the entire pie and also the crust. It's a chocolate lover's din of sinful bliss. Love it love it love it. I've eaten there before. I don't recommend that you get their pizza. It's expensive and ridiculously small for the price. You're better off using a coupon for domino's and getting more slices. also, the pizza doesn't taste all that great. It's like eating slime on a cardboard shingle. However, I've had their burgers and those are awesome. My friends order the pasta dishes and seemed to love it. The complimentary bread and sweet butter is very tasty. I've had great service thus far but of course I come mostly for the treats. I'm happy that they cater to lots of different dietary needs. I'm able to get a veggie burger which is mouthwatering and sumptious to say the least. You won't be disappointed in it. Parking is a drag on the weekends and for that reason I never go on the weekends in the cold months. I don't mind waiting in the cool breeze of the spring and summer evenings but I refuse to freeze my ass off in the blitzing cold. So, when spring shows it's lovely face, I show mine to the Cheesecake Factory to catch up on my dessert feast."
Clay K.,"Forsyth, GA",29,146,61,4.0,1/2/2011,"The service was amazing, the food was delish, and the selection was fantastic.  While the Cumberland Mall itself has slipped a few notches in prestige over the last few years, the anchor-store chain restaurants are thriving.  We had fried artichoke hearts, crabcake balls, and a selection of entrees too varied to accurately discuss, other than to say the daily specials are worth a look.  We followed it all up with a slice of Godiva cheesecake split between the group.  Excellent!"
Amy S.,"River Grove, IL",33,9,7,2.0,5/17/2013,"Went about 6:30 PM. Our server Erroll was very welcoming at the beginning of our visit. And at the end. We barely saw him in between. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as the app and We split the chicken Costoletta. The food was actually very good despite the fact they tried to being us out appetizer and entree at the same time. To the kitchen's credit, they didn't just toss the chicken under the warmer to keep it but actually remade the dish. I had the Firefly martini which was very good but sadly took forever to get. A friend that joined us only had time for a couple of glasses of wine and had to go back to work. She was able to order her second glass, ask the server for the check, give her card, pay for her drinks and about 10 minutes later finally got her glass of wine. She was pretty annoyed as were the rest of us. The food was great but the service was very slow. Our server got much friendlier and attentive at the end of our meal but it was really too little, too late. The cheesecake as always was fantastic, however I think I will be getting my cheesecake to go from now on."
Wallace S.,"Smyrna, GA",215,175,9,2.0,9/27/2007,"I am so through with Cheesecake Factory!  The food here is fine, nothing special, but this particular location is crazy.  I don't know if its because this is Smyrna, and people have no place better to go or what, but this place stays packed.  Last time I went, I had a wait, there were a ton of birthday parties and families around, and I had to wait in a line to go to the bathroom.  I'm a man, dammit!  Since when do men stand in line to use the freakin' bathroom in a restroom?   Anyway, it's crowded, the service isn't that great, and the drinks are weak.  When I was in college, Cheesecake Factory was THE sophisticated place to go.  I guess I've grown up a little since then."
Bill S.,"Atlanta, GA",382,385,1,3.0,3/24/2008,"I admit I do enjoy the Cheesecake factory. Especially the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta dish.  heaping bowl of fettucine, chicken, shrimp vegetables and spicy seasoning. Tasty stuff!  The waits at any CF location, here or elsewhere border on insane. When we go, its usually late, to avoid the crowds. Jane and I went for Saturday night dinner, arriving at 930, and it was still about 20-30 minutes for a table for 2. Beats an hour and a half when you arrive at 8. To me it seemed like half the restaurant was dressed up for a fancy evening, while the other half were slumming in tshirts and jeans (or just finished a soccer game as it seemed was the case with a crowd of teenage girls in athletic wear)  If you are looking for a date night where you want to dress up and/or impress someone, dont go here. There's hundreds of better options. If you just want to go out and get a decent dinner and fantastic dessert, and don't mind waiting, do come here.  CF is somewhat pricey in my opinion, but portions are pretty large, so that mostly makes up for it. Still, most of their appetizers are at least $10, and if you want a salad with your meal, its $7. That's not a big deal to me though, because you are supposed to save room for the decadent cheesecakes at the end of the meal, so take my advice and skip the apps and sides. They have complimentary fresh baked bread if you need to nibble on something while waiting for your food. As for the cheesecakes, with 40 or so varieties, everyone can find one that suits them. I've never tried one I didn't like!"
Shica B.,"Marietta, GA",359,255,2,2.0,10/16/2009,"I heard about their new cheesecake, Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I was so excited and am severely disappointed.  The cake was hard.  The cheesecake wasn't soft and fluffy.  I do not recommend this $8 dessert to anyone."
Ashley C.,"Smyrna, GA",13,43,2,4.0,5/13/2009,"Cheesecake Factory had always been one of my favorites since childhood, but there was a period when the food was not up to par (but the cheesecake was always delicious!).  However, my family and I returned on Mother's Day, and of course it was very crowded. The food was absolutely delicious this time around though, and we ordered several different things. Let me just say that the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps are a must-try, and it really is a lot of food. Same goes for the Spicy Chicken Nachos, I was surprised how tasty they were! I was also surprised that the service was so prompt and the food so delicious on such a dreaded holiday for waitstaff. They have redeemed themselves for sure in my book!  I do have one complaint though, they have slightly changed the recipe for Linda's fudge cake, and it is not the same!"
Whitney T.,"Atlanta, GA",459,491,105,5.0,5/13/2009,One of my favorite restaurants! The filet mignon is awesome :). Strawberry lemonade is delicious! And of course the cheesecake is spectacular!
Anne J.,"Atlanta, GA",65,134,12,3.0,8/20/2011,"My husband and I love to cook, but sometimes it gets late and we get lazy and we need a late-ish night spot to eat. The Cheesecake Factory at Cumberland Mall is close to our home, and they are open until 11:00 Monday - Thursday and even later on Friday and Saturday. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know they have a book for a menu. If you can't find something you like to eat here, you should probably look into joining Adult Picky Eaters Anonymous. They have everything. When a restaurant has such a huge variety of food, sometimes I am a little leery that  the food will lack focus and be missing on flavors. This is not the case at The Cheesecake Factory. I am always satisfied with my selection. One of my favorites is the French Country Salad that has roasted beets, asparagus, and goat cheese. It is quite tasty. I knocked off a couple of stars because of the atmosphere. The decor reminds me of a stationary cruise ship, and it's usually pretty noisy. the service is usually ok, but nothing spectacular. I am always tempted by the cheesecake selections, but I try to employ self-control and skip desert. I recently discovered that they have a split of Mumm Napa sparkling wine at a very reasonable price. This makes me very happy, and I often choose to have this as a liquid desert."
Pat S.,"Smyrna, GA",1,13,,4.0,12/8/2009,"All I can say is, ""Been there. Done that..., a number of times and at a number of their locations!"" This is still my go to place when I am with a party from the office or have family from out of town looking for a nice place for lunch. I love the Avocado Egg rolls, the Firecracker Salmon Rolls, the CRAB CAKES and the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, as appetizers. As mentioned, the 'Cajun' Chicken Littles (not spicy to me - so don't be worried), as an entrée are wonderful and so plentiful that they will last for another two or three meals! I order the 'Sweet Hot Chili' sauce for dipping, in lieu of the honey mustard or barbecue sauce they normally provide on the side. The Sweet Hot Chili sauce usually accompanies the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and is much preferred! It is so-o-o good, I could drink it!) The Steak Diane, Factory Meatloaf, Shepherd's Pie, Factory Burrito Grande and, did I mention the CRAB CAKES?, are top on my list. I have had a few of the pasta dishes and can not complain. I even enjoy their corn succotash and mashed potatoes. (GRIPE ALERT: I really wish the restaurants would peel the darn potatoes so I could enjoy the creamy texture and not find myself trying to elegantly rid myself of an offending, tough red skin that can not be chewed, or be forced to pick them out and segregate into a mini pile on my plate away from the potato itself.  Before you yell at me, yes, I know:  There is not really a way to elegantly rid yourself of the offending stuff once it is in your mouth.  Someone will always see!) In terms of dessert, of course, I have sampled the cheesecake and they have all been wonderful. I typically prefer the entrée over a desert, but they still get the 'nod.' Cheesecake Factory - Long may you reign!"
Michael S.,"Villa Rica, GA",27,19,9,5.0,5/25/2009,Dinner was great. The menu is huge and can make decisions difficult but worth it! Thai Chicken Pasta is awesome as well as Thai Lettuce Wraps.
