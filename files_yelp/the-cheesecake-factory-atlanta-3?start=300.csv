B W.,"Atlanta, GA",6,130,27,3.0,8/13/2010,"the service i get at this loaction is hit or miss. sometimes its good. sometimes its not, and that can happen at ANY restaurant, but overall its CF so we come for the buckwheat bread and the cheescake. my fav dish is terriyaki (sp) chicken boneless or the mahi with veggies. they have awesome sliders, and the orange chicken is good too."
