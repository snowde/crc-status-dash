Michelle K.,"Atlanta, GA",636,620,3618,4.0,6/25/2015,"I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory at least 2-3 times a month growing up. It was the ""cool"" place to dine at when in high school. With plenty of menu options and delicious cheesecake, you just can't go wrong.  Plus the bonus was that you usually can find a Cheesecake Factory next to your neighborhood mall so it was quite convenient.  Not much has changed since then because this location and its sister locations are all within the major malls as well.   I've somehow managed to avoid dining at this chain for most of my 20s but have recently started going back for casual lunches and dinners. Mainly, because of the delicious cheesecake we pick up for dessert.  This location is in Cumberland Mall.  You can't miss them because they are located near Ted's Montana Grill.  Service is excellent the handful of times we have visited so far and of course the cheesecake is always delicious. During our last lunch visit however, they served me a slightly frozen slice of my favorite ""Wild blueberry White Chocolate."" It wasn't a huge deal for me because it was still delicious but I can see how others might be peeved by it.  My boyfriend ordered the ""Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel"" and he enjoyed very bite.  If you love apple pie, you're going to love this cheesecake.   During our last visit, we were both craving burgers so he ordered the Mac n Cheese burger and I ordered the Factory Burger.  The Mac N Cheese is exactly what you think it would be. Picture a juicy burger with includes a mac n cheese patty.  He loved it and was very pleased with his menu choice. I also enjoyed my burger. I was drawn to the wheat bun and the fact that it came with caramelized onions. It's the same wheat bread that you are typically served while you wait for your entrees.  The meat was cooked well and we both left satisfied. NOTE: Our server gave us a heads up that at this particular location, they tend to under cook their meat so if you generally order ""medium"" then your best bet is to order ""medium well"" and so on.   I'm sure we'll return soon enough for more cheesecake slices and explore other menu items."
Lindsay S.,"Atlanta, GA",31,50,3,1.0,6/30/2017,We just walked out because after sitting at a table for 5 minutes we had yet to see a server. We've been to this location once before and the service was fair. This time we didn't even get that far. Not sure how this restaurant stays open with their lack-luster service and overly inflated prices.
Tiffany J.,"Atlanta, GA",45,125,415,5.0,9/29/2016,What can I say about this place that you don't already know. I had the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and it was AWESOME!!!! I took home a slice of Red Velvet and Oreo Cheesecake! They are my absolute favorites!!!
Joche' H.,"Atlanta, GA",159,172,860,1.0,9/18/2016,"This was the worst experience ever. It was my line sister's birthday. We had a party of 9. We arrived at 5:15 didn't get seated until 7:30. Our waitress Walida didn't seem to want our table because i informed her that 3 friends were parking. She had an attitude walked off and came back to take drink orders. The other three guests arrived shortly after. Bread was brought out immediately. The drinks were brought out after 15 minutes, one received her drink a strawberry lemonade late. And so did one male guest after I attempted to inform the waitress that the party was complete so that the additional people could have their drinks put in. It took her about 20 minutes to come out with the pad to take food orders. After a 45 minute wait for food, our entrees arrive and one was completely forgotten about, the 4 cheese pasta for JD, my friend Kaila's tacos were cold and my eggplant parm was burned and covered with sauce and Luke warm. Desmond's wonton appetizer was also cold. Angelica's mashed potatoes were clumpy and hard and she wanted them made over. The waitress apologized and brought a manager to our table. She explained that she could put the mashed potatoes in the warmer and my line sister explained that she wanted fresh food cooked. 4 of us sent back food, 3 of us did not want it remade. My fried cheese was salty. And it took 40 min for the check and our waitress had to be reminded for refills. She was extremely sincere about the food issues, but every one was upset. After waiting for hours to eat we expected hot fresh food. Not luke warm, cold, food that had been prepared and sat on the window. No one liked their food they were just ready to go. And it affected our going out plans because we left at almost 10 PM. It took 25 min for the waitress to bring out 4 cheese cakes. It was horrible. I'd never return for a special event. It was completely ruined."
Linda S.,"Smyrna, GA",0,5,,1.0,10/21/2017,"It shouldn't take 30 minutes for 1 slice of cheesecake to go. We saw multiple ppl order after us... and only to get theirs before ours and once we informed the cashier of our issue, she didn't even apologize or acknowledge they lost our slip. I will not return and purposely drive further to avoid this one. Rude and horrible service."
Za S.,"Marietta, GA",83,27,5,4.0,9/1/2016,"Went to the Cumberland Mall location on a Friday night and was seated immediately. The decor is everything and I know from previous experience that the cheesecakes are bomb.  However, I would NOT recommend the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, b/c it was hella bland. It was so bland that I decided to eat it for lunch and/or dinner, but forgot to grab the leftovers on the way out. Blah. Like, if Cheesecake Factory & I ain't go way back; the meal would've earned it a 3/3.5 star rating.  I would definitely recommend the Pineapple Moscow Mule though! My date ain't much of a drinker and he thought it was good too."
Davis W.,"Newnan, GA",2,72,1,1.0,5/29/2017,Customer service is terrible.  Order a steak and you get no steak knife. The people that bring your food drop it off on your table and take off running back to the kitchen. They can not ask if you need anything else. Then you sit there waiting for your server while food gets cold. Share this with female manager and they do not care.
Dary P.,"Stoneham, MA",0,5,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Worse service I ever had, just went in for apps and Cheesecake this took 2 hrs when my corn cakes they were burnt. I spoke to a manger and 15-20 later I received another one. They comped the corn cakes but charged it twice and removed one to get the waiter its forever. Then he fixed it after another 10 mins. It took forever and service and food was not what I except for a Cheesecake Factory."
Seon A.,"Atlanta, GA",46,5,5,2.0,3/30/2017,"I like coming here but today it took almost 10 min before our server brought our drinks. And our appetizer never came and when the manager brought our salads out we had said we never got our appetizer and he just said I'm sorry, meanwhile our server is at another table just chatting away. He finally came over and said I'm sorry about the appetizer I didn't think it would take that long to make. And he never asked how our food was. It will be a long long time before we return back."
Srikanth M.,"Smyrna, GA",1,28,2,4.0,6/4/2017,"Ordered a chicken pasta with chipotle sauce and no words it's just delicious. Too many options on the menu. Very friendly staff, lovable ambiance, enough space. Bread and desserts are too good. Bread gets hard in no time, had to eat as soon as it reach the table."
Jess B.,"Ashburn, VA",7,40,189,2.0,8/31/2016,"I went to here for a late lunch today.  An estimated hour lunch turned into two hours.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip for my appetizer.  Can you say 30 minutes for dip!!  I only got it in 30 minutes because I prompted my waiter to check on it.  Then once it came out it was like warm.  I rolled with it because at that point I was starving.  I ordered the bbq ranch chicken salad for my entree.  It was heavy on the veggies and slim on the chicken.  Well at least my strawberry lemonade was good, I guess."
Faydria G.,"Atlanta, GA",143,155,1843,3.0,1/22/2016,This will be a very short review. The only thing I can give a review on is those awesome cakes they have to offer. I have to admit I've NEVER sat i sideand had their food before.  Whenever I come its always at a rush for a few slices of different flavors of cakes and cheesecakes. With that along this is why I keep coming back. I will change my 3 star review once i have eaten there.
Ryan S.,"Villa Rica, GA",0,4,,1.0,10/2/2017,We initially tried to dine at CCF but the wait was 2 hours so we went to another restaurant and ate.  Then we came back to get dessert to go.  Even with that we waited 45 minutes after we ordered to get our order.  Ridiculous.  I know it was busy but there is no excuse other than bad management on fulfilling orders.  The food was great but waiting to get it was a very bad experience.
Christina C.,"Atlanta, GA",322,146,1410,5.0,12/12/2015,I love the Cheesecake Factory. Cheesy?! Well so what? It's like Houstons or papadeuxs (always good quality food)  but with a huge menu. It's a chain but it's consistent and they can get away with their massive menu bc everything on it is delicious!!! I've never had anything that I didn't like. The portions are huge they always have good service and the lighting couldn't be better.  And the bread?!!  Swoon! Love that! Over the years I've been partial to the chicken piccata the pecan crusted fish ...the burgers..the salads... You get my drift...Last time I got the sausage ricotta flat bread which was only 6.95 and quite good.... I'm not a fan of sweets but the Godiva cheesecake will make me make an exception. It's a good place for dates and business meetings and if you bring someone here that can't find something on the menu their ass needs to be dropped off at home. Go!
LaShonda H.,"Marietta, GA",201,301,939,4.0,6/28/2016,"I like CF obviously because of the red velvet cheesecake. I go here mostly just to get that. One Sunday I had a gift card and decided to sit at the bar and order. I ordered the Chicken Madeira, the bartender said it was the most popular chicken dish. It also indicated that in the menu. I also ordered the special house made lemonade. I believe there are no free refills on that so sip slowly although that was a struggle (it's reallly good lemonade). I'm not sure why the chicken madeira is the menu favorite, it wasn't over the moon good. In fact, I won't order it the next time I eat here. It was ok, mostly the sauce made the dish. The dish consists of sauteed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes. I don't know what madeira sauce is but it's similar to carbonara sauce. I believe it's a wine based sauce. Anywhoo, the chicken was a little rubbery for me. The melted cheese on top gave it a tangy flavor which would have been excellent if the cheese was actually melted all the way. The asparagus was amazing and so were the potatoes. But I found myself picking through the chicken to find good pieces. Maybe I just had a bad batch. I also ordered the Salted Caramel Cheesecake to go. It was really really tasty, but nothing beats the red velvet I'm sorry. It took me 3 days to eat that one piece of cheesecake though so maybe I wasn't really feeling it. I'll be back for sure because this place has good service and consistent food. I'll try some of the cocktails one day, I heard they have a happy hour."
Candace T.,"Mableton, GA",100,16,11,5.0,5/5/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Everything cooked in lots of butter, plus cheesecake and good drinks. You can't go wrong. I've eaten at this one plenty of times, as it's the one closest to my home. Never any service problems. Even on holidays or event days where it's packed you'll still have good service."
Nyomi E.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,17,11,1.0,8/6/2016,The food here is always below standard. Incredibly bland the only good thing at the cheese cake factory is the drinks and maybe the desert. I Took a chance at the gumbo and oh my goodness it was incredibly tasteless.
Letoya H.,"Smyrna, GA",133,25,3,3.0,4/13/2017,"The bartenders were friendly. However, I had to wait 25mims for my single order. It wasn't packed or busy. When I finally got my food the dish was cold but the plate was hot. I asked for a manager who offered to ""reheat"" my food and offered me a salad while I wait. I declined the salad and had toes it another 10mins for food. No discount was given for my time or inconvenience, not even a salad's worth. My time and hunger pains are precious. Keep the bread bring me my food in a timely manner."
Dori B.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,18,,5.0,9/12/2017,"We ate at the Cheesecake factory yesterday. Despite being short staffed, because of Tropical Storm Irma, kudos to Drew, the bartender and Nicole, the manager, who made it all work."
