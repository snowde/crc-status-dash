Herschel G.,"Lithia Springs, GA",134,60,392,1.0,5/30/2016,"Came to this location recently for our friend's daughter's birthday. Awful experience.  First of all this location is ALWAYS crowded.  One of the main reasons I hate coming here.  But it wasn't my choice, so I was a good little soldier and didn't complain. At first.  Now it's not necessarily their fault that they're a popular franchise in a high-traffic location, but if they managed it better it could possibly work.  We had a large party, so I figured that our friend had made some sort of reservation. Well. It turns out that The Cheesecake Factory doesn't DO reservations. I know, crazy right? I had no idea either!  So we were forced to wait. And wait.  For more than two and a half hours until they could accommodate us.  In the meantime, we watched smaller party after smaller party get seated ahead of us and proceed to occupy tables LONG after they were finished eating their meals.  And once we were finally seated, we still weren't all seated together.  Sigh.  Oh well, on to the food... The long wait meant that we didn't get served until after 10pm. Way too late for my over-40 butt to be eating anything spicy. Regardless, I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo.  A few measly shrimp, bland broth and some chewy, gristle-y chicken.  I thought the late meal time was the reason I started feeling nauseated a few bites in, so I stopped eating and asked for a to-go box so I could order what I really came for: Oreo Cheesecake.  It was great.   One thing The Cheesecake Factory never gets wrong is, well, cheesecake. Maybe they should just focus on that and not food.  Because the next day when I reheated that gumbo it made me nauseated all over again and I threw it away.  Happy birthday Sadeja. Love you kiddo... But please don't invite me next time."
Mel V.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,57,4.0,5/8/2017,Food was ok. Service was excellent.  Waited a while for the Food to come out. It was my friends BIRTHDAY and the staff treated her like a rockstar. A great time was had by all and it is beautiful inside!!
TS A.,"Atlanta, GA",52,29,12,3.0,3/2/2016,"I met up with a friend, who had been shopping, to catch up on some girl time over dessert. Typical Cheesecake Factory setting.  We were seated immediately around 7PM on a Tuesday.  Our server was attentive. I ordered a Piña Colada and Black Out Cake.  The drink was not delicious, the cake was very dense and not cake-like, and the almonds on the outer edge were a little soft and not crisp. I also ordered an Oreo Cheesecake concoction to go for my husband, he enjoyed it."
Shawn T.,"Roswell, GA",3,12,2,1.0,12/6/2016,Service sucks..... I went to the bar area with he tall tables waited 15 mins for service no one came. So I asked for a server. He came he sucked he seemed like he didn't want to help didn't check on us came by the table many times when it was time to pay...  I wish them luck I will not come back to this location..
Aline R.,"Frisco, TX",0,9,,1.0,4/4/2017,Really bad service. Lunch time on a busy area and it took us almost an hour to get our meals and another 30minutes for the dessert which we ended up canceling. This is on a Tuesday and the restaurant was pretty empty. I do not recommend this location. The server never apologized for all the delay and handed us the bill without acknowledging anything.
Kyle P.,"Mableton, GA",23,17,14,4.0,7/30/2017,"So here's my review. Me and a crew of about 12 came out here for dinner. Well we made reservations at 7pm, we didn't sit down until around 930pm. We didn't start getting our food until 1045 very close to 11pm to which they were handing plates out to us one at a time! So it must've been very short staffed there because our waiter had to also bring out the food by himself. Most of us really enjoyed the food a few complained but overall it was not really a good really a good experience. The poor waiter really tried his best to accommodate us being that we were such a large crowd. Im giving it 4 stars because the menu selection was awesome, and because of the extremely long wait the management did give us appetizers for free. I will be giving The Cheesecake Factory another chance because I know its a great restaurant."
Alexis B.,"Atlanta, GA",696,34,7,2.0,6/7/2016,"This mall is awful.... And so is this Cheesecake Factory. I would never come to this location again solely based on the clientele they have here. They allow people to act like complete imbeciles inside of the restaurant. The wait is not worth it, at all. I will commend them on their drinks, I had a really yummy peach drink (don't remember the name) and I loved it! Sub-par service, but the management needs to know when to ask people to leave."
Unhappy C.,"Toledo, OH",0,11,11,1.0,9/27/2016,Dinner on Tuesday with a large group. Ordered a simple side of 3 meatballs as my entrée and after 20 minutes found out they didn't even have them. Ordered pumpkin cheesecake to again find out they didn't have the item.  Waiter told us never to come in Monday or Tuesday because they always are out of stuff.  Don't waste your time. Go somewhere else.
Christine A.,"Atlanta, GA",298,117,33,1.0,7/14/2017,"I've been here twice recently (June 2017) - once for dinner and once for dessert.  The night we went for dinner, the restaurant was short-staffed - 1/3 of the tables were empty, yet the hostesses had a 20 minute wait.  It was a weeknight - probably a Wednesday if I had to guess.  We decided to sit in the bar area instead, which wasn't much better.  Our waiter was overloaded with tables, drinks were extremely slow to come out - to the point where the one drink we each ordered lasted through the dinner, whereas we had intentions of buying a couple of drinks.  We split the avocado egg rolls, which were good, and a pasta dish that was pretty bland.  All in all, we regretted spending our money here.  Then a couple of weeks later, we decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go on a Sunday night at 10pm.  There was a 20 minute wait after ordering the slice of cheesecake before we could walk back out the door to the restaurant.  Let me repeat, a 20-minute wait on a random non-holiday Sunday night.  Then when our order FINALLY came up, the restaurant had run out of the cheesecake that we selected, despite the fact that they had 3 slices of it in the display case when we ordered it (and someone should have noticed that they were running out of that one and gone to get one out of the freezer to thaw).  We had to select a new cheesecake, and no offer was made to try to make up for the fact that we waited 20 minutes for a slice of cheesecake that they didn't have available.  I highly doubt I will ever go back to this location again, despite it being walking distance from my home."
Corey W.,"Miami Beach, FL",195,15,36,5.0,8/14/2016,I really enjoyed my visit today our waiter Reno was great he made sure our glasses stayed full and the food was good to except the fish tacos but all in all I was blessed and pleased to pay 74.00 on the meal with a 20.00 tip great service deserve a great reward!!!!
Reza V.,"Houston, TX",2,4,1,2.0,7/10/2015,We checked out this location on a typical Friday night and we ordered grilled artichokes as appetizers and steak and pasta for main course. We started with artichokes and were half way don that my wife found a live worm on it (the picture is attached). As you can imagine it ruined our appetite. We asked for the manager and he tried to discredit our claim but he couldn't since the worm was alive and moving. It took a very long time to bring our order and they brought the stake first without a steak knife!  It took them another 5 minutes to bring the pasta and a knife. At the end we asked for a check and they brought us a check!  The service was awful and the food was bad. I do not recommend this location to anybody else.
Sheri E.,"Atlanta, GA",6,3,,5.0,7/27/2017,Just had an amazing experience here... had drinks and dinner on the patio and Kaina was our server. She was so great! Timing was perfect! Couldn't ask for more. And the manager Rodney was a gem! He checked on us multiple times and was very attentive. We'll definitely be back!
Slim M.,"Atlanta, GA",19,264,173,3.0,9/4/2015,"My last visit here was this past Sat, 8/29. The wait wasn't too bad, even though the line was out the door. We were seated in a booth. Since the aisles are so narrow, we had to put the baby's stroller near the narrow-door entrance, not the main entrance.  I ordered the fish tacos. They were devine. The first two were so good. You know how something has such a distinct taste that after awhile, your taste buds get over them quickly? No? Okay, maybe it's just me. After the first two, I was asking for a taste of my partner's Shepard's Pie, which was SOOO good. I almost wished I'd ordered that. Maybe I will next time. The fish tacos had a nice seasoning, helping of guacamole, and a sweet sauce. Loved it. Just got tired of the taste after the first couple.  I also ordered the Apple Crisp instead of cheesecake, since I'm not a cheesecake fan. Well, this place is called the Cheesecake Factory, so perhaps, I should have tried out one of 'em. The Apple Crisp was disappointing. I'm not a fan of nuts, so the fact that the entire bottom of the dessert was a layer of pecans was disappointing. I totally missed that part on the menu. Yeah... quite disappointing.  Our waitress took a long time to do anything, granted it was a Saturday. The wait was awful. Our cups sat empty for most of the time we were here. I forget her name. I'll try the Shepard's Pie next time I come here and perhaps, a cheesecake finally.  ;)"
Tom C.,"Cartersville, GA",329,3,3,3.0,11/17/2016,They do more than just cheesecake! The lettuce wraps are awesome and the cheesecake is really good too. We ate there for our anniversary and we'll be back. The biggest problem at Cumberland is the lack of parking.
James H.,"Live Oak, FL",25,4,,1.0,11/19/2016,"Cold bread and wrapper butter is not the best first impression. It took the waiter a while to serve us, and even longer for the food. The food was good whenever it came out. My drink went empty several times and it took them a while to be able to notice and fill. Good food, slow service. Also charged my friend extra when she ordered off the lunch menu. When she brought it to their attention, they didnt change it!"
Daniel L.,"Crown Point, IN",96,17,10,2.0,11/5/2016,"I don't like having to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to take my order. On top of that for them to leave a spoon on the floor, not offer refills and leave dirty dishes on both sides of me while I eat. Just not what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory. They definitely need secret shoppers in there to get these below average wait staff up to par."
Raul L.,"Town N Country, Tampa Bay, FL",11,130,124,3.0,11/15/2015,"In my opinion the food was average as well as the service. I ordered the chicken piccata and the quantity looked like it was from the kids menu. Granted it was from the lunch special, but come on its spaghetti how much could it cost. In regards to the service, it took a minute for our waiter to arrive at are table, but once he was around he did a good job.  It's a shame. I really like the place. It's decorations, location, and atmosphere can make this place a top 5 in any state or country."
Rachelle P.,"Ooltewah, TN",6,41,82,3.0,9/27/2016,"I dined at the bar on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was busy, but there were a few spots at the bar. I was alone so I didn't mind and I wanted to eat quickly and then get on the road with a 2 Hour drive home ahead of me. One of my favorite indulgences is the sweet corn tamale cakes. They were good, but not as good as I remembered them from times past at other locations. I ate those while I sat at the bar, and ordered Thai lettuce wraps to go. They were kind enough to substitute grilled salmon for the chicken. I'm fortunately, this is where things really went wrong. I waited a long time for my to go tieless wraps, which should have been a fast order to prepare. I also asked for brown bread only to go, and ended up waiting 30 minutes just for that. When I finally got up and threatened to leave without my order, they pulled it together and got it to me."
James L.,"Douglasville, GA",22,13,2,2.0,4/5/2017,"It was a Tuesday, though there were other people in the restaurant it wasn't very busy. There wasn't a wait, and we were seated promptly. Now the bad. I had to wait over 15 minutes for a lemonade. It was over an hour before any of us were served anything to eat other than bread. The dinner order came separately and about 20 minutes apart. My wife sent her meal back, my meal didn't taste anything like how I remembered it, my son didn't like his burger (mine and my son's meal took the longest time), and my daughter's dinner was cold.  The easier was nice, and I don't believe that the issues were his fault, and he brought the manager over without us promoting him to. The manager did comp us 4 cheesecakes which was nice, better service would have been better though. It appears that the cheesecake factory in this area suffers from lazy kitchen staff and lazy food runners. That also speaks to poor management. I will not be visiting cheesecake factory again, it just isn't worth it!"
Ryan M.,"Charlotte, NC",2,8,2,1.0,6/17/2017,"RAW CHICKEN!  Don't go to this location.  I've been to other locations with good service and food, but this one was a terrible experience.  The waitress even couldn't believe how one thing happened after another.  I was in a very good mood entering the restaurant with my wife, and we started with the Thai chicken lettuce wraps.  Biting into my second wrap the inside of the chicken was cold and slimy.  I knew it was raw, looked at the inside and it was very clear that it wasn't cooked.  The waitress apologized and comped the appetizer.  I had already ordered another chicken dish for the entree and was worried the same experience might happen.  Fortunately the entree was cooked right, but it didn't taste any different than KFC or Cracker Barrel's fried chicken that you can get for a fraction of the price.  Their other dishes are unique and have bold flavor, but the truffle honey fried chicken definitely is not.  I asked for some of the honey truffle glaze, so I could see what it tasted like, since I couldn't taste it on the plain fried chicken.  It took the kitchen too long to get it out and I thought they had forgotten about it as I tried waiting.  My wife was completely finished with her meal by the time they got it to me after I had to remind them again.  Sounded like it was the kitchens fault for not having it ready for the waitress.  The waitress comped our Cheesecake at the end of the meal, which was good and of course left us in a better mood since their cheesecakes are so good!  1 star for the location, but not the chain."
