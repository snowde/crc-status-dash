Jonathan P.,"Mobile, AL",7,55,10,5.0,10/2/2016,Me and my brother come here all the time to get cheese cake love the food! I would recommend the banana cheese cake with extra bananas :). Also every time we come the staff is super great offering free bread and doing what they are suppose to!
Stella F.,"Marietta, GA",38,3,2,1.0,1/24/2017,ABSOLUTELY  WORST SERVICE EVER. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch during our 1-hour lunch break. we waited for 15mins to be seated when there are plenty of tables available. Ordered our food and took them 30 mins to get the food out. Got our food to go didn't even get to eat our food. A Manager came over apologized and didn't even do anything about it. Why do I want your apologize when you are not gonna compensate us? Will not EVER go there. I threw away the food it tasted disgusting after I took one bite.
David L.,"Northbrook, IL",12,126,31,2.0,3/27/2016,"We are visiting from ChicagoHostesses have no personalities.  Waited over an hour. Was told several times that should be few minutes that turned to 10-15 minutes.  Finally got seated.  Server greeted and we immediately gave our orders. Has been over 10 minutes and just brought our drinks. Still waiting for our bread. And finally got our bread and butter.  And our flatbread appetizer.  I can't tell if our server is happy with us or not. Asked for another water and more bread and wasn't that thrilled about it. Food came out. Ordered the Smoked BBQ burger. Well made but lacked the bbq so had to request bbq on the side.  Oriental chicken salad was great. My son ordered fettuccine alfredo without any garnish or herbs. Couldn't even eat it - it was salty as if it just came out from the ocean. That was comped by the manager. Daughter's crusted chicken that came with pasta and marinara. Chicken was well made but again the pasta was salty. Tongue felt ""numb"" from the saltiness.  Overall the experience at this Cheesecake Factory was bad from the start. Only deserves 2 stars for my burger and the salad."
Ash B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,60,44,1.0,3/27/2016,Horrible experience the food and service at this location sucked. Nothing appears fresh and the taste of the crab and artichoke dip horrible. The Farfalle pasta horrible. Rachel our server horrible. We will not be returning!
Meme R.,"Atlanta, GA",32,70,412,3.0,4/16/2016,Was here the other day for happy hour (M-F 4to6) the happy hour menu is 2 pages and the food  is $5.50 to $6.95( no drink specials). The service was super slow but the food was good.
Maggie N.,"Atlanta, GA",53,33,2,3.0,9/6/2016,"Visited for lunch today with a few girls from work. Food was great, however it came out in such odd increments that it was really frustrating. Our server was fine, but didn't do more than the minimum requirements for getting us fed."
Lynx M.,"Atlanta, GA",363,473,2981,3.0,6/12/2015,"1. The wait can be long depending on when you go. It's in a mall so the weekend can be a long wait or any type of holiday. 2. The restaurant is medium, the seating can be cramped due to the overwhelming crowds. 3. The wait staff is usually good, it's only been one time the waitress was not to my liking. 4. The food here is decent, I preferred the buckhead location better before they moved to lenox. 5. Parking is a pain in the ass, like I said it's in the mall. You can valet but I'd rather walk. 6. You have to request for your bread to be warm and your butter not to be little frozen blocks of butter. When I asked the waitress did she have either warm bread or room temperature butter she looked at me like 0_o I'm like *_* miss you can't spread ice cold butter on cold bread. She appeared to have an attitude. I laughed it off. 7. Came here with my bestie she wasn't thrilled about the company so she was ready to go. We had appetizers and split. 8. They have good cheesecake, the bakery bar is this this locations saving grace. They always move quick, are professional, and knowledgeable about the desserts.  9. Giving 3 out of 5 stars because I can't give 3.5 they need to work on keeping the restrooms clean, having the food come out warm and not room temperature, the servers could have better demeanors but I know how it is dealing with idiots, hood rats, the undecisive, people that complain about everything, and the lunatics with their requests of hot water smh do us all a favor and just eat at home or get the plastic to go utensils! The food used to be good but now certain dishes have slacked up, like less shrimp, or 2 less wings, 3 less steak medallions, etc and yet the prices keep creeping up.  10. Good place worth checking out some people love cheesecake factory like me but I've encountered people who absolutely hate it **shrugs**"
Steve F.,"Kennesaw, GA",2,20,95,3.0,4/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is located in Restaurant Row along the outside of Cumberland Mall. While the service and food is always wonderful and friendly, the speed and cost are what knock this down to a three.  When they get very busy, expect to wait a lot longer than normal for a table, and expect the food delivery to take a long while.  But if you come during off times, they are closer to a regular restaurant (albeit even then a little slower).  We always enjoy our food; in the 5-6 times I've come here I can only think of one time when one of my kids complained about the food.  Despite the long waits at times, my kids always choose Cheesecake Factory to celebrate their birthdays- and we continue to oblige."
Lynette R.,"Kennesaw, GA",280,144,121,5.0,12/9/2014,"Called to place a to go order and was given a 15-20 minute window for when my food items would be ready.    Love how my food was ready shorter than that.  I mean, why wait longer than necessary right? Okay, now this is what sets them apart from other restaurants I've placed togo orders with.  You know that sourdough and wheat bread they serve while your waiting for your food?  You know...it's  oooooh sooooo good and you can make a meal out  of it?   Well hold on to your seats because the person that took my order, asked if I wanted some to go with my meal along with the butter.   But of course I exclaimed!!!   Most restaurants only save that for dining in or will actually charge you for it. This was the first time The Cheesecake Factory offered to do that and I am no stranger to The Cheesecake factory - nice touch."
Sharon K.,"Atlanta, GA",71,22,83,3.0,4/7/2016,"Lunch with my co-worker at Cheesecake Factory at Cumberland Mall. If you go around 11:45AM, there is enough seating and you do not have to wait a long time to be seated. Plus you get to beat all the lunch traffic by arriving before noon. And it is much easier to find parking. The server always give you sour dough bread and wheat bread. I prefer the wheat bread. It is softer and has sweet taste to it. We ordered BBQ ranch chicken salad and Garlic noodles. The BARBEQUE RANCH CHICKEN SALAD had Avocado, Tomato, Grilled Corn, Black Beans, Cucumber and Romaine All Tossed with Barbeque Ranch Dressing. And then it was Topped with Lots of Crispy Fried Onion Strings for Crunch. I loved the crunchy and crispy onion rings. The GARLIC NOODLES was a pasta dish. It was Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Delicious Garlic Sauce. This is a great place to get your salad and pasta fix. Our food came out fairly quickly, but this will not be your 1 hour lunch break. You will need to estimate out to be about a 1.5hr lunch break. Server was SO slow and forgetful!"
Judy C.,"Marietta, GA",0,3,,1.0,5/7/2017,"The wait was too long we waited for three hours, got there at 3 o'clock didn't get seated till six, the only reason why we got seated is because one of the people we were with walked around and seen empty tables and they were trying to seat another party that wasn't even there yet, but told us they don't take reservations.....mmmm fishy!!!! Some of our food did not have any flavor and was not worth the three hours we waited, never going back!!"
Danitra G.,"Alpharetta, GA",80,36,18,5.0,2/6/2016,"There is not a bad selection at the Cheesecake Factory.  Selection and consistency is truly uncanny.  Salmon was soooo good.  Mastered the art of that firm seared-like exterior yet absolutely perfect, moist, succulent inside.  Smh.  Mango Key Lime slice to go.  Oh!--and cucumber lemonade:). Best lunch I've had in a while."
Jada C.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,14,2,5.0,5/3/2017,"As always, the food was delicious. We were seated right away and our waiter, Justin, was there within 30 seconds. He was friendly (but bit obnoxiously so), courteous, and professional. If there was a wait staff standard, he was the perfect example. Thefood was a little slow, but it was during lunch rush, so somewhat expected. Such a big room can be very loud, but we were seated in a (relatively) quiet corner and were able to enjoy conversation without yelling. Very positive experience."
Queenie D.,"Atlanta, GA",287,708,374,4.0,4/14/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! If you are in the mood for sweets, may I suggest venturing out of their cheesecakes and try any of their chocolate cakes?? they are huge and decadent so I suggest to have at least 2 people work on that baby ... maybe even 4 people for every slice ... SERIOUSLY!! Now i forgot the name of the cake I had the last time, but it had three different layers of chocolate with all kinds of other chocolate stuff around it. Now, make sure you have a reservation and patience during their peak hours, cuz the wait can be long.  I definitely enjoy their free bread and soft butter/margarine while you wait for your ordered meal. They have white and wheat bread to choose from. The only thing about this is that you need to sorta kinda control yourself because it is unlimited and it is so easy to fill up on these things before your actual meal comes.  Most of their pasta dishes are huge and can be split with two people. So, unless you are just hell-bent on devouring some food that day, i would say that splitting one pasta entree between two people is the perfect portion per person. We always have the chicken scampi, and it is always on point.  I do not suggest their miso salmon on rice - if you are familiar with what actual miso really is ... It is nowhere near the Japanese miso that we envisioned ... it was more like teriyaki salmon. Eek.  Their meal easily range from $12-30 so it is really up to you how to make the most out of your money and meal. They have a HUGE selection on food and prices really varies due to this.  I suggest to try it once and see for yourself. Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of those places that you either love or hate."
Jay D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,5/26/2017,"Will never go here again! Worst service I've ever experienced. Seated for dinner and waited 20 mins for water, no bread and 45 minutes for food. It came out the same time the appetizers did and food was cold. No apology from waiter and manager was also no help. GM stepped in but at that point to late. If you get Thaddeus as a server ask for someone else. HORRIBLE!!"
Beth H.,"Marietta, GA",0,5,,1.0,2/5/2016,The worst experience ever! Loved our waitress Dede and proactive Landon (he got our order fixed).  Our bread was old and cold. Our Chicken Costelleto was cold...the chicken...the asparagus...and the sauce. The only thing hot was the mashed potatoes. The manager said the sauce was supposed to be room temp. No sir...bullcrap! We asked our waitress to make sure our sauce was hot. It still came out cold!!! The kitchen at this location is a constant disappointment and I say Im going to give it another try. NEVER AGAIN! Sad that management wants to use the excuse that the sauce is supposed to be room temp. What a bunch of crap!! Obviously the manager has better things to do then care about his customer base. YOU ARE A HORRIBLE MANAGER AND SHOULD GO BACK TO CORPORATE TRAINING...IF YOU WENT IN THE FIRSY PLACE.
Courtney R.,"Atlanta, GA",77,64,79,3.0,11/29/2015,"Sat at the bar for happy hour/bar menu specials.  This location DOES NOT have drink specials (reasons #1-57843 that I will be going back to the Perimeter Mall location.  service was slow and bordered on surly. Sat at the bar and wasn't greeted. Menus were placed in front of us, and the bartender walked away. We waited about 10 minutes for service, menus closed and sat next to us. May have been a one - off but we will not return"
Jason C.,"Atlanta, GA",36,20,1,1.0,10/28/2015,"God awful experience. Let's see..currently I have half my meal in front of me. I stopped eating it 10 minutes ago when I ran out of both beer and water.   It took over 10 minutes to simply get drinks in the first placed. As in, we ordered drinks, and then didn't see the server for 10 minutes. It took almost a half an hour for our entrees to arrive after ordering. I have been here TWO hours now, for one course!!!!  I wanted dessert, but at this point I give up. And they are NOT full. No wait. Open tables. This is not worth the frustration. I'm gonna go to the bathroom now and drink out of the sink, as nobody has been by as I type this. Good luck eating here."
Tracy W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",11,3,1,1.0,9/12/2016,Won't be back. Seated immediately then ignored for 20 minutes. Tons of servers and a light late lunch crowd.
Amanda S.,"Dacula, GA",12,18,3,4.0,10/25/2016,My family visits this location a lot. Usually lovely just expect a long wait  on weekends (no reservations)!
