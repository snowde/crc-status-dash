Kawana C.,"Suwanee, GA",67,14,9,5.0,1/2/2018,"At first the bartender was very rude. We sat and waited while he made drinks right in front of us. He came n went a few times and never acknowledged us. After 5 minor so we asked for menus. He rolls his eyes and grabs two menus and places them in them in the bar not in front of us... Just on the bar. Never once made eye contact.  We just got up and made out way to the host stand to get a table. Hosts were hosts and no complaint there. Our server is the reason for 5 stars. She was knowledgeable, sweet, prompt and made sure we were taken care of!!"
Robert P.,"Centennial Place, Atlanta, GA",305,6,3,1.0,1/10/2018,"Terrible. Me and a girl both ordered a whiskey on the rocks. At first I was amazed by how much they poured, and gave the bartender a compliment saying thanks for the big pours randomly. When I got my bill she charged us both a double. You don't pour doubles without asking the customer... wtf? Never coming back here again."
Ashley T.,"Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, GA",80,205,273,5.0,12/22/2017,"It's a tradition that my co-workers and I come here for our annual Christmas party and besides coming with my co-workers one time a year, I can say I rarely venture to Cheesecake Factory.  It was super busy at the mall (when isn't it?) so finding parking was an issue but my superpower patience kicked in and finally found a spot on the other side of Switzerland.  Anyway, I got there about 10 mins after they open and was able to put our name on the list but of course we couldn't be seated until half of our party showed.  The hostess was kind and checked in with me periodically as to whether or not my party showed and we were seated as soon as everyone arrived.   The restaurant is huge and has both indoor and outdoor seating as well as a take out area andddd the amazing display glass of cheesecakes.  I do wish they would make the waiting area bigger because that place gets packed and when there's a line, it's just super congested and you don't know who's waiting or who's in line to be put on the waitlist.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant but for a group of our size, they put us at the smallest table.  There were any other tables we could move to so we bunched up and made it work. Our waitress Jade was sweet and I loved how she interacted with the group.  She was attentive, apologized for delays, and I could tell she was a people person and handled our group with ease and threw in jokes here and there so that made our visit enjoyable.  The menus are huge and have sooooi many items to pick from (they do need to be cleaned because most of them were quite sticky) but I kept is simple and ordered the pasta carbonara which came with green peas, bacon, a garlic Parmesan cream sauce, and I added chicken.  It arrived hot and smelled reallllly good.  The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the bacon was divine.  I also ordered a red sangria (kudos to the bartender) and the white chocolate cheesecake to take home (ohhhh it's in the fridge and will be noshed upon at the perfect time). Overall a great experience and if Jade's manager sees this.  Give. That. Lady. A. Raise."
Tenita F.,"Snellville, GA",63,55,45,5.0,1/3/2018,So I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a long time so I thought why not!  I am trying to eat better so I ordered off the skinnylicious menu!  The Asian lettuce wraps were the best I have ever had!!  I like that they are already wrapped not a mess that I need to create.  I also had the edamame and it was ok the Sangria was also good!! It was a typical crowd with a short line. I didn't realize they have happy hour from 4-6 and had just missed it!!! I will be back!!!
Raisha S.,"Atlanta, GA",155,70,118,2.0,12/11/2017,"I've been to cheesecake factories before, this place is known for being packed and hours of wait time which wasn't different for us on a Sunday night either. We had a 70 minute wait time, still opted for it because of the group we were in, didn't mind the wait too much. When our wait was over and we got the text, there was another 10-15 min wait to get seated. So after an hour and a half wait as we get seated, there wasn't a server to our table for another few minutes. Silverware missing, had to grab it ourselves from another table because the wait is too long when we asked for anything. Didn't get water or menu for a while again. No fresh bread either, it was apparently in the oven forever.  We ordered Louisiana chicken Pasta and Parmesan Chicken Pasta Pizza. Food arrived another 30 mins later. Although the portion size was great, the food quality was below average. Wasn't fresh, everything tasted as if they were frozen. By that time in 3 hours the restaurant was already half empty, so not sure why there was still so much of a delay. All servers are running around but didn't seem to get anything done - probably short staffed. Multiple tables were having similar issues like us.  Cheesecake Factory is a popular chain in the nation, receiving such poor service and food was highly disappointing - most likely never going back. I wish them the best."
Mohammed K.,"Atlanta, GA",7,35,28,1.0,12/28/2017,"When the lady and I checked in with the hostess, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait. During the 30+ minutes, which we waited patiently, we noticed that at least 3 tables remained open the entire time, where servers were on duty. The tables must have been out of order. After we were seated, we ordered drinks, Gin on the rocks, and a few appetizers, Fried Calamari, Buffalo Blast,  and a Greek Salad. The Greek salad was great, the calamari was cold, and the Buffalo blast was sent back to the kitchen. The server was friendly, but she totally kept forgetting to pick up the dirty plates from our tiny table for 2. The dirty plates sat at our table the entire time we were dining.  The overall experience here earned them 1 star in my book."
Soham N.,"Atlanta, GA",32,25,38,5.0,10/6/2017,"I have been here twice now, and I have had nothing short of a satisfactory experience each time! I will start with my recommendations; definitely try the Oreo Cheesy Milkshake. It comes in humongous quantity so order your other meals in moderation. If u r not a fan of Oreo shakes, there's chocolate and strawberry available too and both are pretty good. Cheesecakes are another obvious winners here with almost 30 to 40 different options. On both occasions, we ate one there and packed another one for home for later indulgence. I ordered pastas on each occasion so I do not have much to comment on the food section. The servers have always been very polite and quick and responsive. I would recommend sitting outside rather than sitting inside, I felt a better and a more lively vibe outside rather than the cozy dark ambience on the inside."
Michelle T.,"Smyrna, GA",149,59,69,4.0,10/30/2017,"Me and my friends went before a concert on Saturday evening. There was a 45 minute wait and we were pressed for time. However, there are small tables at the bar so it was perfect when a party of three left and we were able to sit at that table.  I only wanted something small so I saw the cauliflower bites and the crab bites. Both were delicious but those cauliflower bites were crispy, sweet taste and worth every bite. They almost tasted like general tso chicken.  Our waitress had a slight attitude but we didn't take it personal because it was a Saturday evening and I'm sure she was extremely busy.  Overall I can't wait to go back to get those cauliflower bites."
Felicia W.,"Atlanta, GA",39,95,48,3.0,12/19/2017,"My daughter and I came in on. Tuesday night at approximately 10:00. The wait time was about 20-25 minutes. It took an unusually long time just to get our drinks and even longer for our appetizers (30 minutes to be exact).  Management did explain the cook burned one of the appetizers, that explains the delay for the chicken quesadillas . To top things off, we used the rest rooms which was in a horrible state (not clean at all).  I had to ask an employee to please make sure management takes care that. Last but not lest, I wanted to order a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go however they were out  I will say that I've visited this location at least a half dozen times before and this is my first bad experience.  If that was not the case, this recipe would have one star.   !"
Seven W.,"Columbus, GA",23,12,35,5.0,12/28/2017,"They told us it would an hour wait, but were seated in less than 10 minutes. Great service and awesome cheesecake! No dinner this time, just dessert."
Tanya J.,"Union City, GA",0,13,2,1.0,1/6/2018,"Very horrible experience.... From the servers to management. It started bad and ended bad. We were told by 3 servers that the server for our table would be with us for 30 min. Bread was brought to our table with no butter. The table that sat next to us after us got all of their  food before us and in a timely manner. When we finally got a server our glasses stayed empty as if we didn't need a refill. The manager looked at us when we complained like we were wrong to complain, my food came out undercooked and by that time I was over it. The manager had the nerve to come back to the table after she was told that I didn't want my food to ask what's wrong now..... Oh we were also told that we shouldn't have been seated in that section because the server in that area was really busy with a big party... I chose this spot over Mimi's I will never make that mistake again nor will I ever eat at CF."
Chelseia E.,"Atlanta, GA",40,15,179,5.0,12/7/2017,"Cheesecake Buckhead...great location for shopping and eating. Awesome duo. When in doubt, the bar is the best location, while solo. The bartender was very attentive and since it was happy hour and I wasn't starving I ordered ""small plates."" Great portion size. The whiskey paradise punch is a plus!  I suggest Cheesecake during your holiday shopping at Lenox!"
Esther K.,"Johns Creek, GA",131,302,1641,4.0,5/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory- I promise you there is something for everyone here.  A book/menu of a wide range of dishes and desserts.  If you're gonna to have cheesecake in your business name you better believe this place knows their cheesecakes.  The cheesecake game is very strong at CF!  So yummy. This is a really nice Cheesecake Factory location.  This CF is located in Lenox Square Mall.  It's in the front main entrance area near Starbucks.  I must say I was disappointed when they shut down the original Buckhead CF location a couple of years ago; however, they did this new location nice!  It's not two stories like the old location but this spot is bright, open, and very spacious.  I dig the layout.  Love the signature yellow tone colors with the cool light fixtures on the high ceiling and the new modern addition of mosaic artwork behind the bar.  That mosaic artwork is so pretty!!  The bathrooms a little far off if you're sitting at the tables near the bar but it did allow me to see all the cool details of this place.   Service was good.  Hostess was friendly, prompt, and helpful.  Our server made sure we had everything we needed and checked up on his throughout our meal. The lettuce wraps was a very nice generous portion and had beautiful plating.  We also ordered the Da Vinci pasta, jambalaya pasta, and Madeira chicken.  Everything was pretty cooked well and you know, Cheesecake Factory does NOT play with their portions.  They are very generous in the portions for all their main entrees.  Always enough for you to take some leftovers home.  The Da Vinci pasta didn't have enough sauce on it but did like how generous the portion was.  The mashed potatoes on the Chicken Madeira is sooooo good! We opted out of the desserts this time but their cheesecakes are pretty amazing.  Actually...they are really amazing.  They have a huge variety available as well every time. I will definitely be back to this location!  Don't know why it took me this long to check this ""new"" location out.   They have free parking (mall parking) and also mall valet is available.  They also have a patio too."
Subhasree M.,"San Francisco, CA",19,2,,3.0,11/22/2017,"It has a great ambiance and the carrot cheese cake is one thing that one should not miss if you are visiting this place!!!!! Now saying that, although the food is great, the only problem is the waiting. I had to wait for 40 minutes and when I tried making reservation on the phone beforehand, they said we don't take phone reservations. Overall the place is very nice but the waiting part takes the thunder away."
Larren M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,5,16,5.0,10/29/2017,"I went on a busy night while in Atlanta on vacation. I sat on the patio, which made the experience much greater! Although, it was 60 degrees outside the heaters kept us nice and toasty. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance the setup created. My waitress was not the best. She barely came to see if we were ok and when she did stop by the table it was to let myself and my party know she hadn't eaten all day and would be missing because she was hungry. A horrible waitress however, did not ruin the night. I had the Pizza style Chicken Alfredo, It was delicious! The others with me raved about their food as well. Lastly, we all split a slice of cheesecake which was also delicious. I give this place 9 out of ten stars!"
Hope T.,"Atlanta, GA",357,76,23,4.0,8/28/2017,The only problem I have with this location is when you go in the evening all the kids and young people are working so they service is always better in the day. Food was delicious as always. I went for dinner so I decided to go around 7:30 because of the traffic headed that way.  I had the Crusted Chicken Romano and it was perfect. The food took a little too long to come out especially because there was a table next to me with more people who came in after me and they got their food before I did. The fact that the food was great made up for it a little. Oh yes and you will be parking at the mall so just beware and put belongings in their rightful places. Remember where you parked your car and try to park in front of Macy's or the Sprinkles ATM if possible.
Tanesha A.,"Marietta, GA",40,93,158,3.0,7/22/2017,"So we went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate a coworker leaving our offices to go to another office. The food was good but as always the service was rather slow. No fault of the waitress she was absolutely great. She gave honest opinions of the food; and her favorite Cheesecake.  I chose to have a meal off the light options menu. Although I forget the name of it, it was delicious. I had a little room for dessert until I saw the size of the cake I selected. My advice to everyone who choose to eat there...DO NOT GO BACK TO WORK AFTERWARD.  Please see the pictures I post."
A R.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,27,24,4.0,12/4/2017,"Seriously what positive thing has not been said about TCCF. All of us had wonderful meals. I had the Cuban Sandwich myself amazing. Then this lovely cheesecake here really hit the spot, very sweet n rich. Always a joy to go to the TCCF."
Devin S.,"Augusta, GA",23,23,8,2.0,11/16/2017,This was my second time here and the second time the service was terrible. Brittany was our server and if you get in her section bring some crackers. She's terrible. We ended up having to get the manager to check on our food and then the waitress wouldn't come to our table after that. It might be better in another server's area but I was not impressed and don't know if I'll be back.
Mariel S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",58,10,11,5.0,12/31/2017,"Delicious as always, but our waitress Peaches was awesome & on point!!! Our drinks were never empty, she was fast & nice. HAPPY 2018!"
Chuck R.,"Smyrna, GA",56,20,36,4.0,10/14/2017,Very good presentation! Haven't been in a while but enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan Pizza style... Also enjoyed the lightly fried zucchini. Ended the dinner with a to-go order of Salted Caramel Cheesecake... Huge portions
Jack S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,11,3,1.0,12/21/2017,"50 minutes.  That's how long it took from order to food delivered to table on a Thursday night.  Got there at 830, waited for a table until 9, ordered at 915, dinner ""served"" at 1005. Not even an apology for how long that took.   No restaurant in the world is worth that sort of wait. We should have just walked.  There's nothing special about this food--it's just another chain. With so many great options in Atlanta, I got outvoted because a few people in my party really wanted ""great"" desserts.  The cheesecakes are frozen, people.  They are made somewhere else and frozen, then (mostly) thawed at the locations.  I am re-evaluating my ""friends"" that thought this place was a great idea. Such poor judgement suggest deficiencies elsewhere. If you think this place is great, I don't think we should travel in the same social circle."
Catherine H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,"We dealt with manger Lou, customer service was horrendous. While trying to resolve a problem he was frustrated, irritated and rude. As an acting manager he hung up on me while I was trying to understand why my card had been charged an amount that I did not authorize. I am familiar with working in restaurants for 10+ years and although everyone has a difficult customer experiences you do not treat a customer that way. To not exercise proper conflict resolution & how to deescalate a situation especially at this establishment is unacceptable. If the top of the chain is not fit to lead than it only creates bad habits by current and future employees. Truly adds a sour note to the wonderful quality of food that is served."
Jessica P.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,1,,3.0,12/21/2017,This is always a treat because we don't have one near us. Unfortunately the table next to us sat down after us and received all their food before us and we had ordered appetizers only. When I received my taquitos they were cold and I had to send them back. The service was great as usual never an empty glass. I realize it is Christmas season and everyone is hustling & bustling but I was a little disappointed.
Keo K.,"Clarkston, GA",96,10,37,2.0,8/25/2017,"We came in from the side entrance of Lenox Mall.  The restaurant was not busy and the hostess pleasantly greeted us.  Comparing to the Dunwoody location,  the food just wasn't the same.  My server was right next to us when the server assistant brought out our entrées.  She did not take away our appetizer plates and asked us to put them on top of the wooden counter.  Hello?  The server was standing right next to us.  The portions were big but the foods have a bland taste compared to the Dunwoody location.  I gave this location 2 chances, but I don't think I will ever  come back here again."
K L.,"Tucker, GA",0,12,6,5.0,10/23/2017,The food was marvelous and the service was excellent too!!! We celebrated my BigBro's Birthday!!!
Nyisha N.,"Atlanta, GA",97,18,39,5.0,11/8/2017,Beautiful atmosphere. Prompt service. Never disappoints!! The heated patio is a definite this time of year!!
Block B.,"Atlanta, GA",33,6,5,1.0,12/6/2017,I came in to purchase a red velvet cheese cake  the server Denise I'm going to up load a picture you really have to call out people who gives you horrible service put a melted cheese cake in the bag I asked her can she please swap out the cheese cake I refuse to take it it was melted and smashed in the box she told me No she can't change it I asked her why she says she's busy and it would take to long I told her I wasn't accepting it she told me if I don't wanna take the cheese cake I can leave her establishment I asked her name she said Denies and was very rude. Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places to eat but the rude server  has no idea of customer service I don't think I would patronize this particular store horrible horrible experience and at the end of it all I didn't get a cheesecake something needs to be done about rude employees
Atula D.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",28,40,513,4.0,3/30/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory to dine twice earlier and my husband & I were here last Sunday for dinner after almost a year.  What particularly impresses me about this place is: First, their menu is really extensive. They have so many options to choose from; from snacks,appetizers to entrees the range of dish and cuisine is commendable. Second, whatever dish corresponding to a cuisine that they offer, is true to it's flavor and toothsome.   They also have a separate brunch menu.  AMBIANCE:  Beautiful decor with large sitting area. classy ambiance with lively energy as the place is usually packed on weekends! FOOD: They serve hot and fresh mini baguettes with butter spread as complementary starters.  Placed the following order for our dinner: Appetizer:  1. Nashville hot chicken nuggets(~$10): juicy chicken nuggets, fried to perfect crispiness smothered in a delectable hot sauce and pickles. Loved it! 2: Chicken Potstickers(~$10): The potstickers were good but what stood out was the sauce! It's very delicious.  Main Dish: 3. Chicken Madeira(~$15): this is their most famous chicken dish which comes as perfectly cooked chicken breasts topped with mozzarella cheese and served with mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. Tastes good. Portion is huge 4. Jamaican black pepper shrimp & chicken(~$19): this is such a wholesome meal. You could choose either shrimp or chicken or combination of both which I did. Shrimp and chicken pieces in a spicy black pepper sauce served with brown/white rice, black beans, fried plantains and pineapple salsa. Absolutely loved the spicy black pepper sauce and the fried plantains. The portions of food here is huge. Every time I am here, I always have left overs to take away. During my earlier visits, I have tried the stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, shrimp scampi and chicken marsala; all of them being delicious! Their Cheesecakes which they are famous and known widely for is classic and perfect! I have had Cheesecakes here(carry out) so many times that I cannot even  keep a count of it.  SERVICE: Friendly staff, service is fast and efficient. It could get really busy on weekends so there could be long waiting time. Overall, a great choice to dine when you are in mood for a  three course meal in a fancy yet casual atmosphere. Also a very good option to dine especially when you are not sure what cuisine you want to eat on a particular day, as they offer so many choices here. A dish/cuisine they offer might not be the best in the city but everything is tasty, high quality, true to its flavor and of huge portions.  If you are not in a mood to dine, then it's an ultimate place to have Cheesecakes as carry out from their take away counter.  Taking into account the dining experience here (and not exclusively  their Cheesecake which they are so famous for) I give it a 4/5."
Tamika B.,"Atlanta, GA",73,63,92,5.0,3/24/2017,"My only hang up was the wait. I think there was an event in town that day so I'll give them a pass this time. Food and service was great. I enjoyed my meal, my son ate every bit of his. My son enjoyed his strawberry cheesecake. My waiter and my son shared the same name Deondre. He was just as kind as my son. Very attentive and helpful. Ill be bringing my son back on a few weeks for his birthday."
Mallorie H.,"Dudley, GA",2,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,Very disappointed. This is by far my favorite place eat but the service has severely gone downhill. The hostess told me it would only take 20 mins and it took 55 minutes before I was able to grab myself a table at the first come first serve bar seating. 10 minutes after I seated myself I was finally sent a text message saying they would seat me. Disappointing to say the least.
Mali H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Thank goodness for the kitchen staff. The service however was terrible! Deontra M. was the most inattentive server that I've ever had. The service can either make or break your experience, and it definitely broke the experience. I understand that a Friday night is peak hours for the business, however lack of follow up and follow through is just unacceptable. To top it off, after we brought the concerns to one of the managers on duty, he blew it off. This will be my last time at this location or maybe Cheesecake Factory in general."
LaVelle J.,"Marietta, GA",6,30,13,4.0,10/15/2017,"Very good, I went with a friend to celebrate my birthday week. The pina colada was magnificent and my meal was delicious as well. I normally get the Lemonchello cheesecake but decided to get the seasonal pumpkin pecan. Had to get my Avocado egg rolls but I think 11.95 is a bit much, I remember when it used to be 8.95."
Mandi S.,"Kennesaw, GA",2,21,10,5.0,10/31/2017,"I went here on a Sunday after church services which is a very busy day for the Cheesecake Factory. BUT one of the waiters near the bar said that the high top tables were first come first serve. So, we were able to be seated quickly! My boyfriend and I split the Chicken Madera and it was delicious. The waiter recommended it as a popular dish. When you see the Cheesecake Factory's menu for the first time, it can be super overwhelming because there is SO many dishes. We definitely tried the Cheesecake. I got the s'mores flavor and it was great! It had a roasted marshmallow on top and all! Great display and flavor of food! The prices are okay for the type of restaurant but the food portions are HUGE I definitely recommend sharing a dish if you're with a family or close friend."
Marjorie M.,"Gantt, AL",0,25,9,2.0,10/29/2017,Only good thing was even thought it was raining we did the out side seating so didn't have to wait forever. And my mango key lime cheesecake was tasty. Service was terrible. Never came back to ask if we need refills or anything else to drink. One of the party ordered a cup of coffee which she never received. I had the chicken pot pie with the puff pastry. Well the puff pastry looked good but the food was cold so I sent it back. All they did was stick it in microwave which made pastry rubbery. Ruined the whole dish. Should have just gone by the name and had the cheesecake only.
Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,790,2216,2.0,11/9/2016,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory. Giant long lines,,, eccentric décor and is usually one of the draws in the mall area. I mean really though, who can say no to Cheesecake Factory for dindin?? Anyways, people like me usually come to chain restaurants like these because of consistency. I know that my chicken marsala will consistently taste the same as I had it last time at the CF near my house. If not, close to what I had experiences. Which was the case when dined in.  My fiancé's shepherds pie however was a totally different story. The flavor was totally off. It was kinds gross actually. The kind of gross that he didn't even want to pack the leftover home. He actually ate my leftover chicken marsala for lunch the next day. And no,, we're not the type to return food and not pay for it. That's where my reviews come in. The service was on point btw.  Thank you for reading my review. Have a yelptastic day!!"
Madison D.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",2,4,5,3.0,8/27/2017,The cheese cake factory was so good ! I had the honey truffle chicken & it was so bomb ! But I wish it was a lil more honey on the chicken to balance out the taste . I also had another problem while we going to sit at our table it was a roach crawling on our seat that was a big turn off ! But other than that good was delicious
Gina T.,"Newnan, GA",42,40,,1.0,5/26/2017,"I have always loved the Cheesecake factory.  However, this one has disappointed me every single time.  Since I work in the mall, I go to Happy Hour so I can get in and out and get back to work on time.  The last 3 visits that I've had were the worst experiences ever. We would order off the Happy Hour Menu, and it would take 45 minutes for us to get served.  Of course, we are shoving our food down our throats so we can get to work on time. Today, I went in at 4:10pm, I ordered a Caesar Salad with Shrimp, please explain to me why it took 50 Minutes for it to be brought out to me.  My server never checked on me, and by the time I got my salad, I could only take 3 bites of it, and then I had to have her put it in a to go box for me to go back to work.   Yeah, I'm done at this point.  Never again!"
Nancy H.,"Sevierville, TN",13,344,400,3.0,12/27/2016,The appetizers were tasty.  We ordered chicken enchiladas and another sandwich.  Nothing stood out as fantastic.  Very very crowded.  Located near Macy's at Lenox Square.
Attaicus C.,"Atlanta, GA",87,269,233,1.0,6/8/2017,Came here for dinner around 9:15 for dinner we order the 2 glasses of wine with the Honey Truffle Chicken.... Mike Snyder was the Dining room manager who was unconcerned Everything was ok until the dinner was delivered
