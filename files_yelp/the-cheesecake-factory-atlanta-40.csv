A.J. C.,"Atlanta, GA",160,454,38,4.0,1/2/2015,"I've had lunch on the patio, dinner at a table, and drinks at the bar.  Every time was a good time.  And you never leave the Cheesecake Factory without some cheesecake."
Miguel C.,"Decatur, GA",29,18,12,1.0,2/3/2016,"I Made a The Cardinal Sin of Sending my Food Back. I thought it should have been different cause it was the Cheesecake Factory. I guess It don't matter. I went on 1/2 off Cheesecake day. I order a Chicken Breast Sautéed with Fresh Mushrooms in a Rich Marsala Wine Sauce that didn't read that way on the Menu. I don't do Mushrooms or Wine. So when I sent it back it took a really, really Long time. That should have been a Clue but it wasn't. I ordered the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage. I thought it was good Until I went home to take a nap to work 3rd Shift. When I woke up I had to make a Mad Dash a Couple of times to the bathroom. Hoping I was done due to having to catch the bus to Work. made it out the Door then I started to drag, diarrhea, sweating, dizziness, stomach pain . By the time I got to Work(The VA Medical Center). I had to Check into the ER, then make another mad Dash to the Bathroom. They gave me some meds and IV for Dehydration. What suppose to be my Friday Night of Work turn out to be a Early start of my Weekend Due to my trusting it was ok To send my Food Back. I have Learn a painful Lesson. To Bad I throw out the Food Cause my Co-workers that works in the Lab Wanted to Test it. Thank You Cheesecake Factory for your Great Customer Service."
Juan G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,27,12,3.0,6/7/2015,Service was good and efficient but the food was awful. The Ahí Carpaccio and Tiramisu cheesecake were good but the California Steak Cheese Sandwich was awful and uneatable! The beef was too thick and greasily... Impossible to chew! The cheese seemed to be some left over from someone s macaroni and cheese... Terrible mix!
Jordan P.,"Atlanta, GA",20,212,,4.0,1/26/2015,"Really large portions and pretty tasty, but nothing special. Same as any other location and its a guaranteed wait of at least 30 minutes"
Leigh Anne M.,"Huntsville, AL",3,13,4,4.0,3/23/2015,"I had the Skinnylicious Beef Medallions and my son had the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage. Both were quite nice, and the Caramel Apple Cheesecake was impressive to look at and delicious (per my son). Service was pleasant and efficient - an all-around nice experience. I'd go back next time I'm in the area."
Stephan T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,,5.0,3/20/2016,"I have always had a pleasant experience here. The waiter we had, whose name is Courtney, was fantastic. He went above and beyond which was required. To the point that I gave him a tip for the same amount of the bill. The wait is sometimes long, but service like this makes it worth it. Getting great service is extremely hard these days, but especially in Atlanta. God bless."
Shawn F.,"Atlanta, GA",237,123,437,1.0,11/7/2014,"I always seem to have problems at the Cheesecake Factory's in Atlanta, mainly with the service. This was my first time at this location. I went in for lunch with my girlfriend, no wait, sat outside and had a pleasant meal with my girlfriend, except for the terrible waitress. I'm not going to get on a long rant about what she did, but basically did not do anything a good waitress should do. Of course, she took our order but that is about it. My girlfriend asked for a drink and she did not bring it, had to remind her. She said she was coming out with bread, that never came. Flagged a manager down and said it has been 15 minutes and still no bread, he said its been baking. Really? It's lunch hour and its baking, for 15 minutes? I don't think so. Our food came out, all was fine and dandy, but no bread. Finally the waitress brought the bread out and it did not even seem fresh. We told the manager that all we wanted was some communication from our waitress. Did not get drink refills, nor did she ask how everything was. She was just terrible, a few other little things I am not going to mention about her attitude, I'm not going to post on here. Had to flag her down for everything. I have been a waiter for quite a while at a few restaurants and I can be patient and understandable about most thing. But if you do not communicate with me and leave me hanging, you will not get my respect or a tip from me. If you are busy, just tell me and I will understand. but don't tell me you will be right back with my girlfriends drink and some bread, then disappear for 15 minutes. Just communicate with me, refill my water, and ask how our meals are. That's all, it's not that hard. Left zero tip, as she did not fulfill a servers basic, I mean real basic duties."
Shaun W.,"Peachtree City, GA",15,16,5,4.0,2/6/2015,"My sister-in-law was in town and she likes good desserts and good food. Where to go? Hmmmm....yup Cheesecake Factory it is! It was my first time at the Lenox location. First things first--we had to pay $7 for valet parking as every self park was full. Bad start. Once we checked in, we had about a 20 min wait (8:00 pm on a Thurs night) before we were seated. Now the hard part-- what to order? The menu is huge! I got the fish tacos and my wife and sister-in-law got salmon and a pasta dish. We were all very pleased! Now onto the cheesecake. We ordered two for three of us, which was more than enough. Very tasty! The service was excellent also.  We will be back!"

Thanzil C.,"Atlanta, GA",2,1,6,1.0,6/24/2014,"Beautiful decorations but unhygienic. The server didn't really care about the dirty silverwares. No sorry, no nothing. If you don't care about the dirty spoons and forks, go for it. Hint: sarcasm (the food is great) I highly doubt I'll be back. I'll tell my friends not to go there as they planned."
Erol S.,"Auburn, AL",0,1,1,1.0,4/26/2015,I saw lots of good comments here so I believe I am having a bad day but I ordered omlette and the breakfast potatoes coming along with it was   was left-overs. I asked to the waiter and she told me that is what they serve!!! I didn't say anyrhing else after that comment.very slow service! It was just a bad experience.Go to other branches!!
Kylie B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,,5.0,3/4/2016,"Every cheesecake factory I go to is always incredible, but this one especially. I had the spicy cashew chicken and it was so flavorful and hugely portioned! Also had the clam chowder and phenomenal as well as a large portion. Tennye was our server and she was very sweet and gracious. Cannot wait to come back again!"
Kayla M.,"Lithia Springs, GA",69,20,,5.0,1/10/2015,Took my grandmother out for New Years here first time at this location. I usually go to the one at Cumberland but wanted to go to the city this evening. Food was good and nice servers as usual
Angela B.,"Atlanta, GA",5,8,,2.0,8/28/2015,I will not be back to this location. I have had a great experience at this Cheesecake Factory until last week.  I ordered my favorite meal and it was good as always until I saw what looked like a maggot or some other type of larva crawling around in the plate. I told the waiter and the Cheesecake Factory handled the situation very well...my meal was comped and I received a gift card. The only reason I am posting a review is because I was told that this same situation happened earlier in the week which is concerning.
Swuazey H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,4.0,4/4/2015,Went there last night. It was very packed but we were seat in about 7 mins. The outside seats were very comfortable. The pricing wasn't bad at all. The food quality was great also. The customer service was fairly good. The guy was ready to go and it showed but he was still cool.
Kristi J.,"Atlanta, GA",3,1,,2.0,3/27/2015,I ordered the chicken and biscuits and it was bland.  I had to get extra gravy to make it edible.  It was highly over priced and no where near worth it.  The server was nice though and just about the only redeeming part about this place.  The Cheesecake was also not worth the money.
Andre F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,1,1.0,8/17/2014,The hostess was rude and impersonal. When we got to our table the previous patrons had left a $0.06. We should have took this as a sign. We sat down for 30 minutes and no one even took our drink orders. Staff kept walking by our table and ignoring us. So we got up and left. Worst experience at cheesecake factory ever....
R G.,"Mebane, NC",1,6,,1.0,6/19/2015,"Even though I am a fan of their cuisine (esp. Desserts), the service in this Lennox Mall Cheesecake Factory was really bad."
Food C.,"Orange Park, FL",0,5,1,1.0,7/30/2015,"Visited this location on 07/13/15, while on vacation. Wife got chicken fingers & i had grilled salmon. Meal comes out but my fish is bone dry so i send it back and wife starts eating. Second piece comes out and it is burnt to a crisp, tasted charred and smokey. Manager suggests I try it pan fried. I agree and wait for 3 piece while wife finishes her meal. 3rd piece comes out, manager explains he stood next to cook and watched them make it, outside looks yummy but I cut into the inside and it was RAW! This is not a sushi meal. I tell them not to make me any more fish. We order strawberry shortcake for dessert since I've yet to eat. While eating dessert, manager brings out 4th piece of salmon and no surprise but it's raw inside. He takes fish away in disgust and never returns. Get the final bill for chicken and shortcake, + 3 fish meals all comped, gee thanks. So we pay for the food wife ate and i leave starved after 2 hours in restaurant. Won't go back obviously, surprised they didn't comp the whole meal but why lose money just because someone never ate... PATHETIC"
Travis B.,"Lithia Springs, GA",0,4,1,4.0,2/7/2015,The food was amazing and the service was impeccable. The wait wasn't too bad considering it was Saturday night.
