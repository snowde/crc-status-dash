Austin C.,"Mesa, AZ",197,47,22,5.0,4/21/2015,"Very classy and very delicious.  The server was extremely respectful although a little slow.    They have delicious drinks and the food menu is huge! They have options for everyone. OH and their bread is delicious . I order fried macaroni as my appetizer since I ate so much bread. It was as amazing as it sounds..and I even combined bread and macaroni and fell in more love.  I also got strawberry lemonade that wad equally delicious  Besides being a little expensive, you pay for the ambience and the food!"
Senta F.,"Cincinnati, OH",20,34,196,2.0,10/18/2016,"Oh, I used to love this place when they first opened across the US. I would travel to the different locations just to eat their food. Now I feel they are over rated and the food quality, flavor and presentation has gone down. The food I had today shrimp scampi was not flavorful at all. Along with the crab dip it was just okay. I am giving it two stars. It is not one of my favorite places anymore. I probably won't be back for a long time."
Mai M.,"Columbus, GA",0,45,18,5.0,10/25/2016,"Any Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites! I just live their food! I been here countless times one of them being on my birthday, I had the option to go to Florida or Atlanta and I chose Cumberland just to go eat here AGAIN! I just love how I matter how many people are waiting we get a table FAST! And the food is just delicious!"
Lizette C.,"Lithonia, GA",165,366,1058,2.0,2/8/2016,"I was given a 4 hr wait time on a saturday night. No biggie. You expect these things. Popular restaurant, popular side of town. Done deal. However, this was my bday dinner, which had already been ruined by another restaurant. SO I was on edge. We were given the wait time and I asked if they thought we could possibly get in sooner. I was told that it was basically possible. So we waited. My friends grew hungry so we went back in to evaluate. We were sure that not everyone would want to wait so we took our chances. However, when we came back in and asked we received the following response. ""We quoted you 4 hrs. You only waited 1 hour and 16 minutes. You're GONNA have to wait the full 4 hr.* *neckroll, neck jut and head cock...with attitude* No No boo boo. I can deal with a wait, but what I WON""T deal with is rudeness. We high tailed it out of there so fast. Before I was on Channel 2 for  choking someone on my birthday. I would never, but I was irked enough to. Do better."
Macey M.,"Atlanta, GA",66,148,284,3.0,2/7/2015,"A Cheesecake Factory is nothing original. But, between the savory food and creamy cheesecakes, it makes you crawling back every once in a while for more. This location offers different seating options. Indoor seating and heated outdoor seating. This location is also very large, BUT there is almost always a wait. I cannot count on my fingers how many times we've come to this location and we're told that we need to wait upwards an hour for a table and we just turned around and walked out.  It's also very loud and the indoor seating area is caotic. So, u suggest you sit outside of you can. We really enjoyed our food though. And the portions are huge!!!!!"
Ophelia L.,"Atlanta, GA",112,290,760,5.0,2/27/2015,"Despite some of the low reviews for this review, I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this place very much after 2 visits. My bf first brought me here one year ago b/c we were in the mood for some dessert after our dinner. I've never been to this establishment before despite it being a commonplace chain. We were seated in one place at first, but we wanted a different seating and got it cuz it wasn't so busy that late night so kudos to the waiter. We told the server that we were only going to get dessert and he still gave us the complimentary bread with butter, which was really tasty and awesome.I actually wished I wanted more but had to hold back cuz I just had dinner and needed room for the cake that were going to order. We got the Tiramisu Cheesecake and Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake (Raspberry-Vanilla Cake, Creamy Lemon Cheesecake, Raspberry Lady Fingers and Lemon Mousse) We both enjoyed the Lemon Raspberry chzcake a lot more than the Tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't bad, but I think we only found out that we preferred the sweet-citrusy taste over the coffee taste.  For my 2nd visit, we found out that it had moved to Lenox Mall, so of course it was extremely busy. We arrived around 7:15pm, got a ticket that said ETA 75-90 minutes (yikes! used the waiting time to explore the mall). They got our cell phone number to text, which was nice. We got seated in the booth, ordered the  Stuffed Mushrooms for small plate and Chicken Bellagio to share. The stuffed mushrooms were cheezy good. My bf recommended the chicken bellagio to me cuz he had tried it before and this dish is FANTASTIC! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! We even took some chicken bellagio to go! Everything tasted great! Service was on the slower side, but to be expected."
Brittney G.,"Chapel Hill, NC",35,43,18,5.0,12/20/2015,"So anyone who knows me knows that I love Cheesecake Factory. I've been to every location in Atlanta multiple times and others in different cities. Yes, I'm a fan and have never had a bad experience at any of them (although I recognize that others may have).  That said, I've never reviewed this restaurant because... well I'm not really sure. I guess there are so many reviews out there and it is a chain restaurant so what you get is pretty standard wherever you so.  Nevertheless, I had for the first time their turkey burger from the skinnylicious menu and it was so good. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just so good. On top of that the waiter on this particular visit was exceptional. I wish I remembered his name. Oh well... if you're in the lenox area it's definitely worth a visit!"
Kezia F.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,1,1.0,5/21/2016,"I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED with BRAD, one of the  Managers (the other was Alex) on duty at this location. I ordered take out last night and loved my dish! So I ordered it again for the road (Back to Orlando, FL) only to find out that the order was incorrectly made. I called and spoke to Brad who told me there was nothing he could do and hung up the phone on me. I frequent Cheesecake Factory because I love it so much but this was the most disgusting customer service I've ever received! Shame on you BRAD and corporate will also hear from me."
Thomas A.,"Atlanta, GA",29,71,27,1.0,2/25/2016,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. This review is solely for the curbside to go service. As I sit in my car typing this review; 30 minutes have passed since I placed my order. All I order was a cheesecake nothing they have to prepare. As the ""duke"" for this location,I can attest to this bring a common occurrence. Sometimes I just go inside to get my items and leave. (Completely negating the convenience of curbside to go service) Also, there are 5 spots reserved for curbside to go service. People will park their cars here and go into the mall shopping. No enforcement at all. This location should do away with this service as they do such a poor job coordinating it."
Rae Lynne K.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,382,67,3.0,11/5/2015,"I've been to this location a couple of times and must say that it remains a solid 3 star visit. The service has been hit or miss, which is the primary reason for the low stars.  Upon check in, the staff always seems in overwhelmed mode, and can be on the rude side. I asked both times to be seated outside. The first visit I was seated right away, the second time I was told there would be a 15 minute wait, and there was very few people seated outside. Now I don't mind waiting, but after 25 minutes, I was still seated inside, after being told that there was no available tables outside. I do like the fact that you can enter your phone number and receive a text message when your table is ready. However, when you receive that text message, be prepared to wait at least another 10 minutes while someone else comes over to help you, or as they stand there looking at you, holding your seating fate in their hands. The location is very nice inside. When I sat outside, we were able to have the heater turned on making for a very comfortable environment. On the inside, the place was extremely loud and the table was cramped. Not to mention the people seated next to me thought it was a good idea to enter my personal space with their chairs. Definitely not the best dining experience as I had to ask the woman twice to move over, as her hair ended up in my food both times. The waitress just kind of shrugged at me after the woman refused to move over, and had I not been an adult, I would have just dumped my dinner on her since her hair was in it anyway.  Now to the food. I've tried the buffalo wings on both occasions, and they are very good. I also tried the fried mac and cheese which was delicious. I like the skinnylicious menu as well. I've tried the cajun jambalaya pasta dish which was delicious, just the perfect amount of spicy, as well as the grilled salmon, although a slight bit overcooked, still moist and delicious. The portions are large, and the pricing fair for what you're getting. Drinks wise, I've tried the pina colada, the tropical martini, and the pineapple mojito, all of which were good on the amount of alcohol and fantastic on flavor.  The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is, and will always be the cheesecake. I always get the red velvet cheesecake as it is my favorite. Save lots of room for the cheesecake, the portion is huge, and extremely filling. This place certainly does cheesecake right.  Now, if only they can get the service improved, the rating would improve. But I'll eat here again for the cheesecake alone."
Meredith R.,"Marietta, GA",431,621,,4.0,12/26/2014,"I've been known to poo-poo chain restaurants, but I'll tell ya: lunch at the Cheesecake Factory today, was pretty good! For $10.95 I got a combo -- the Renee something-or-other -- which included soup (a  delicious bowl of New England Clam chowder: very clammy, not much filler),  half a chicken salad sandwich, and a large portion of field greens (with homemade chunky blue cheese dressing.)  The gratis bread brought to the table was crusty, fresh and just the way I like it. Despite post-Christmas crowds at Lenox Mall, at 12 noon there was no wait for lunch.  The restaurant is large, the seating comfortable and the wait-staff quick and efficient."
Keith R.,"Conyers, GA",0,6,,2.0,1/27/2016,"I thought that going to the prime location in Buckhead would promise a great evening. However, I was completely wrong. Even though we were seated outside rather quickly for a Saturday night, they didn't have the heaters on in December. I know Georgia weather is crazy, but come on.  It was my wife's birthday and I had hoped she would enjoy herself. The drinks took forever to get to the table. The waitress seemed attentive at first, but that soon changed. I understand that they can get busy, but that shouldn't affect the service as much as it did. I even had to flag down her down when my wife had an issue with the horrible excuse for ""mashed potatoes"" she received when the food finally did come out.  My wife loves cheesecake to death and didn't even feel like ordering a slice on her birthday. Enough said."
Carol C.,"Roswell, GA",0,29,,5.0,9/24/2016,"What's not to love about this place? A little shopping after brunch , valet parking, friendly smiling faces, great food..."
Ginette O.,"Smyrna, GA",17,44,12,3.0,1/24/2016,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory, how I so want to love you more! I always crave their strawberry martinis and their margarita pizza, but when the bill comes, I always regret it! Lol! It's seems their prices are getting higher to me. Otherwise, I'm ordering 1 too many strawberry martinis! Now that I've learned how to make them, I might just be taking the party to the house!"
Jayden J.,"North Charleston, SC",1,5,,4.0,10/20/2016,"The atmosphere made me feel fancy. Make sure you get one of the 100,000,000,000,000 cheesecakes.I Usher  all of them taste goooooooooooood."
Jan K.,"Duluth, GA",15,272,,5.0,6/9/2016,Absolutely delicious. My husband declared his burger today the best he has ever had anywhere. My southwestern salad with 1000island was predictably yummy. Service was perfect. On a good day this place is had to beat for value and service.  Oh and the burger was a perfect med. rare. No wait at 11:45am on a Thursday.
Big B.,"New York, NY",236,662,16,3.0,2/5/2017,Good standardized American restaurant. The food is not very tasty nor bad. And the pricing is great. A just ok place.
William R.,"Tempe, AZ",0,7,4,4.0,10/14/2016,"Had a great dinner here this evening. Staff was professional and courteous. The food was well prepared, good tasting, and served in portions that definitely fill you up. It goes without saying that the cheesecake is delicious also."
Annie L.,"Atlanta, GA",715,924,1252,5.0,11/6/2014,"I'm an avid ""Cheesecake Factory"" consumer, and the experience at this location was no different. My wait on a Sunday morning was approximately 15 minutes, but the actual wait was a little less than that. After getting seated, our server quickly came by, got our drink orders, and promptly brought out our beverages/bread. The cobb salad was more abundant than the other locations I usually go to. Lastly, our waitress ""LaToya"" was spot on with all aspects. Main point = I still love Cheesecake Factory."
Martha K.,"Atlanta, GA",6,21,36,1.0,11/17/2014,"The new restaurant in Lenox Mall is very impressive and large. My sister and I came here for dinner and the wait wasn't too long at all.  We were seated next to a large group and no server came to great us because they were too busy openly praying with the table next to us. That was an uncomfortable situation because praying is fine, I don't mind that of course but to stop your service and pray with a table for a long period of time was awkward.  Our server finally came to our table and took our orders without writing it down so she had to come back and ask us what we wanted..... Annoying.  The food here is not great it's very bleh and meh and average. I would much rather not eat here again. I will pass."
