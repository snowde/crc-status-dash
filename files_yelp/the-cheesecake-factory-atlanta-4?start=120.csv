B T.,"Rome, GA",2,77,1,4.0,9/2/2016,Had the Madeira chicken dish. It was great. Service was Good. Peanut butter cheesecake was delicious.
Apearl C.,"Atlanta, GA",254,611,185,2.0,10/24/2014,Do not eat here for lunch during the week. Long wait to get a table. Misquoted wait times. Hostess stand not organized. Decided to have lunch hear on a weekday and realized it was not a good idea early in. The wait time to sit down is unacceptable for lunch and the food service was slow. We waited about 30 mins after ordering for our food to come out. I did like our server but outside of that I could of went without that experience.
Macario V.,"Duluth, GA",9,12,10,1.0,2/11/2016,"Awful service. The waiter doesn't even stop to ask if we need anything half of the times. There's some problem with the customers in the next table, but that shouldn't make our service that bad. They haven't cleaned the table for 15 minutes."
Carla M.,"Atlanta, GA",2,49,3,5.0,8/19/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory been coming forever you cannot go wrong, the menu is a book, something for everyone and the strawberry lemonade is Amazing,and I love the cheesecake everything I ever eaten here was good the only issue is there is always a long line."
Donna A.,"Key West, FL",92,2,,1.0,9/21/2016,"BTW Cheesecake Factory, we did arrive at 2pm to avoid the extreme long wait.  We still waited four hours!  The host acted like he hated seating a group by telling me that he would unlikely have any seats to hold us all.  I also told him that we could sit at two tables as long as they were close together."
Ashley F.,"Atlanta, GA",46,110,372,1.0,7/20/2014,"Highlights: This is of the new Lenox Mall location... If you care about service, go elsewhere. Outside of ordering takeout cheesecakes, I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory with groups of people, mainly because of the varied menu and the ease of accommodation. I've never had any problems until now. I planned to visit today with a group of 11 and was thoroughly turned off by the service I received. I called in to inquire about a reservation and was met with a rude hostess on the other end.  She tartly told me they don't take reservations and they don't accommodate large groups well. That was news to me since Cheesecake Factory's own website, specifically the details section for the Lenox location says ""We can easily accomodate large parties."" She also said we'd have to wait two hours. As I was saying, ""Ah OK, thanks,"" she simply hung up the call. Wow, really? I planned to call the manager, but didn't want to be put on hold for an obscene amount of time. Instead, I'm calling corporate about the sorry service.  **Manager's take note: Service is still a priority for many patrons. If the gatekeepers of your establishment are turning people off/away you have a real problem that needs addressing."
Lindsay W.,"Decatur, GA",280,542,49,4.0,11/3/2014,"It is hard to state that anything can be ""bad"" here.  The menu is HUGE, the selection is MASSIVE, and the food tastes GOOD.  I can definitely tell that they changed some of the salads around, but that is ok.  Our server was nice and quick to come out with drinks, bread, and the salads.  I had the Chicken Salad that had an Asian flavor to it.  It was just ok.  I expected more of a peanut style dressing, but it was more salty than anything else.  My sister ordered the tacos which were just so so.  Then again, why order tacos at a non-Mexican restaurant?!?!   Overall, you get a lot for your money and at lunch time the lunch portions are huge!"
Oniequa A.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",58,15,5,5.0,9/5/2016,Study lunch date with my daughter. Great location. Great food!! Everything was perfect.
Helen H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,3.0,2/26/2017,Had dinner here and had a salad. The atmosphere was typical Cheesecake Factory. Nothing special
Lola O.,"Rockville, MD",62,41,10,1.0,7/24/2015,"I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory in Lenox and Perimeter Mall.  For the most part, I enjoyed my service. However this last visit to the Lenox location was HORRIBLE.  My family of six had our family brunch.  We ordered our food and only 4 of us got our food. We thought that the 2 orders would come out.  It turns out one of the meals was not even made, and the other was just sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered to our table. So my brother waited 20 minutes after we had all gotten our food. My sister had to wait an additional 30-40 minutes!!!!  This there our whole day off, and we were late for our next event!! The manager (whichever manager that is present on Sunday afternoon) was not very sympathetic.  He had the audacity to only offer to give us a single slice of free cheesecake as if that would fix everything. Its so sad because he relayed this message through the wait staff instead of coming out to speak to us.  So we immediately asked to speak to the manager. He offered to take one of the late meals off the ticket and give us two slices of cheesecake. But he did so rather unapologetic about the inconvenience that was caused and was rather defensive.   The Cheesecake Factory Lenox location absolutely just lost 6 customers.  We'll take our money where management demonstrates better customer service and treats their patrons like they actually want their return business"
Mátyás K.,"Atlanta, GA",48,3,,4.0,7/21/2016,The food is great. But make sure you check your credit card statement. Recently got overcharged
Katalina S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,28,14,2.0,12/15/2015,"Let me start by saying...oh, how I love this franchise! Imagine my disappointment when I received such awful service at this location. I really hate to only give them 2 stars but this location deserved it. Poor service! So, I went to this location a couple of weekends ago around 3:30pm. We were told it would be an hour wait for a party of two. We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half. But I was excited to show the place off to a newbie so we waited. I've been to other locations - Jacksonville, FL, Miami, FL, Cherry Hill, NJ, and Charlotte, NC. I knew what to expect as far as decor and prices. Yes, they are pretty pricey but it has been worth it at every visit EXCEPT this one. The service was just awful. No other word for it. I had a spicy pasta and had to stop several other waiters for a refill as our waitress literally took our orders and brought the check. I asked her for a refill and she said ok but I saw her walk past several times. The food was so subpar here. The bread they give you was cold and hard. The table next to us had to send their pizza back because the bottom was completely burned and black. The cheesecake never disappoints though. It was great as per usual.  Needless to say my Cheesecake Factory newbie was not impressed. Better luck at another GA location, hopefully."
Shane W.,"Columbus, GA",0,1,,4.0,2/12/2017,Went About 5pm  we did not have to wait ! Had a great waiter and food was delivered in a timely fashion and as always the food was great ! I wanted the lunch portion but they said only at lunch time ! They never refused be before ! But that s ok ! I took the rest to the hotel and ate it for lunch the next day !!
Ankit S.,"Atlanta, GA",11,36,11,3.0,8/6/2016,"Food Quantity good. Food quality good and taste average. Price not bad I will be going here again, make sure to setup reservation if you are going on Sat evening else you will end up standing/waiting for several minutes."
Janice J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,12,,5.0,1/31/2017,"OMG! I love this location, I've been here a million times and I've had amazing memories here. The hostesses and servers are always very professional. I usually get seated right away when I arrive early in the day. The servers always ask if I want bread, when seated. I love the wheat bread with butter, yum. The appetizers, entrees and desserts are always fresh and delish. I love the outdoor space during the Spring, Summer and Fall months. The menu is huge, they have everything from pizza, shrimp scampi, burgers, salmon, steak and the best desserts on the planet...whatever you want they have it!!  This location is two steps away from Lenox Square Mall, the location is excellent. Go there, you'll love it!!"
Shahid S.,"Mableton, GA",3,2,1,3.0,8/11/2015,"Location is still rather new so it's very busy and disorganized most of the time. Whether you're dining in or taking out its always a mix up and something will occur that will affect your order. Overall the food is decent, it's just the service is really frustrating there..."
Crystal A.,"Atlanta, GA",10,20,6,1.0,2/28/2016,"As you see, a great majority of the positive comments about this location are from last year.  I love The Cheesecake Factory, but to echo the many people here, the staff at this location predominantly is HORRIBLE.  Experienced a rude lady on staff last November who works the dessert and pickup area.  I hope she sees this too because she'll know it's her based on the time of year.  RUDE MANAGERS who ALL NEED TO BE FIRED.  Have spoken to the managers and not only were they no help with the issues, they flat out didn't care.  As you also see here, nobody from the restaurant has dropped by to respond to these reviews or take them into consideration.  THEY DON'T CARE.  They take for granted that people will just flock there because of the food, so they don't care how they treat people.  The General Manager told my sister on the phone when she called that ""you could imagine how many customers we had last night""... Um, every customer should feel like the only customer! I ordered delivery from them (ADDED 4/27...thru DoorDash-- because they also swore up and down that they don't do delivery lol smh) and items were missing-- the managers, including the General Manager, were NO HELP WHATSOEVER and did not replace the items.  The missing items were caramel sauce ON the cheesecake (they are also not fixing cheesecakes right either because the Dutch Caramel Apple Pie is to come with caramel sauce on the cheesecake), the second dollop of whipped cream (that a manager told us only one dollop comes with cheesecakes-- dead wrong), and complimentary bread for one of the meals.  They sent us two Dutch Caramel cheesecakes ONLY and gave us a hard time about sending the free bread that people eat baskets of! Get this, there was only one of those Dutch Caramels ordered and a Dulce cheesecake ordered originally, but they sent us two Dutch Caramels; we didn't even request that cheesecake be sent, so some smart person gave $20 away.  If service was like this at their previous location on Peachtree, I'm not surprised people zoomed right by without stopping!  The ambiance of the Lenox Mall location is way too nice for these nasty people-- they need to be replaced and should find jobs away from people."
Joey R.,"Atlanta, GA",74,68,115,3.0,7/30/2014,"I love the new location.  It's much more convenient to access.  They also have curbside takeaway!  They have designated six parking spaces where you can have your food delivered to you after you phone in your order.  The booths are more intimate than all of the seating in the middle.   The manager mentioned that the new restaurant is literally half the size of the previous one (from 500 down to 250) but they have literally doubled the number of people coming in there each day!   On my recent visit the food was consistent as usual.  The tex mex rolls are always great...the sliders and chicken sliders have always been one of my favorites. Their menu is a small novel, so you will always find something....no matter what your mood is.   The biggest downside on my recent visit was the service.  The service is hot and cold here.  This time the server was nowhere to be found for most of the meal.  I kept having to flag down other servers.... The other complaint most people have is that in this day and age, it's hard to go somewhere that doesn't take reservations.  It's so easy to make online reservations at most Atlanta restaurants and not have to wait ...sometimes it's hard to justify going anywhere won't accept reservations.  I always recommend calling and finding out how bad the wait is before going to Cheesecake Factory.  I would also recommend staying away on a Saturday  night.  There are hundreds and hundreds of top Atlanta restaurants that are on Opentable and accept online reservations.  Why bother going somewhere on a Sat. night where you might have to wait an hour to be seated??"
Nirmal P.,"London, United Kingdom",84,67,41,4.0,8/17/2015,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Great food & Cheesecakes with massive portions.   Highlights:  Amazing Cheesecake plus Food is cooked right and tastes great, Huge menu selection with now great healthy options, Massive portions for the price, Fast service, Short wait, Clean and Ample parking.   Can improve:  Take reservations.   Benchmark:  They set the standard for Cheesecakes in my book and I have tried all the popular spots in New York City to compare.  Their food is good as well and extremely reasonable for the portions they provide. Dined in Aug 2015 and will return.  Def. try the chocolate mousse cheesecake."
Yvonne W.,"Atlanta, GA",118,51,261,4.0,3/19/2016,"Me and Adam were looking for a spot with outdoor seating today. He suggested coming here and it turned out to be a great idea. When we got there, it was a long line for indoor seating but only a 5 minute wait for outdoors. We got lucky with that. Their seating are cushioned and not metal hard chairs like other places. The atmosphere was also way more quiet than sitting indoors. The chicken lemon couscous is now my favorite dish there.. it has all the healthy vegetables that I like! Kale, green beans, corn, tomatoes, and much more. However, the creamy mayo like sauce that the couscous was sitting in along with the heavy amount of butter was borderline too much for a dish that I chose because the description made it sound so healthy. For the bread, I really wish they would make the crust softer on the white bread. As I bit into it, one sensitive spot on my tooth, the hard crust made it feel terrible. Yea...so no more of that. The Strawberry Creamsickle shake was AMAZING and not overly sweet."
