Harold J.,"Wilmington, NC",83,674,40,1.0,6/26/2015,"This visit was another reminder to why I hate going here.  A vast complicated menu executed by a frazzled and chaotic staff.  I just wanted a quick bite at the bar.  Only one bar tender was present so I waited ten minutes just to be acknowledged.  After ten minutes I just walked out and went to one of their competitors.  I'll be back after another hiatus of 8 years, maybe it will be a better experience."
Dustin L.,"Greenland, NH",18,64,,3.0,8/21/2015,3 stars is about right.  We were slow to be acknowledged and the food was slow to come out.  Service was ok but not personable nor very polite.  As a business traveler there are too many other options to return unfortunately.  I do expect more from Cheesecake Factory.
Cindy A.,"Marietta, GA",58,167,135,5.0,6/21/2014,Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorites. The new location at Lenox is really nice. The decor is appealing and the wait staff is very competent and attentive. The bread is so good to start with. I had the teriyaki chicken and my husband has the chicken and biscuits. Both were delicious and had enough to take home for lunch. Then there was dessert. OMG- the cheesecake variety choices. Not a bad one in the bunch!  We shared the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Delicious!  We will be back.
Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,4.0,6/10/2014,"New location. Spacious, clean, well-staffed (when I went). Your standard Cheesecake Factory fare, except .. GASP .. no Thai Chicken Pasta. :(  My heart was broken by the lack of my favorite lunch item, but my server suggested the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which was awesome. In fact, you could hold the shrimp and hold the chicken and just give me the sauce over rice and I'd be happy. Especially with the wheat bread to dip in it. Yum."
Amanda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,12/14/2016,This absolutely was one of my favorite places to go to until the person at the bakery and behind the kitchen decided to make a complete and inappropriate uneducated guess with me and used a very unprofessional approach as a guest in their restaurant. I wouldn't go here I think that there are other Cheesecake Factory restaurants where the waiters are more friendly.
No E.,"Conyers, GA",2,36,362,3.0,7/1/2015,Food is so so and the service is a hit or miss.  I like the location and the deserts.
Nelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,116,94,4.0,1/21/2015,"A friend and i needed to energize ourselves before heading to a nail salon in the area and Cheesecake Factory provided the perfect lunch. We even decided to return after the salon for dessert!  The menu is extensive - I recommend checking it out online if you can before you go, unless you enjoy leisurely considering menu options when you're starving. i enjoyed my Caesar salad and my friend liked her baked chicken which i thnk was accompanied by quinoa and vegetables. The dessert we had later on was the highlight of the day, however. We both had the apple pie a la mode which came with the most diesel dollop of whipped cream on the planet! Each bite was euphoric.  Definitely recommend the CF for a casual dinner with friends or a date. Valet parking can be a bit of a zoo, especially when trying to exit, but it's worth it."
Regina A.,"Ocean Springs, MS",24,42,10,1.0,2/20/2016,Lol expect to wait 40 minutes longer than expected...got a baby sitter for only 2 hours thinking it would be enough time....we pretty much had to get our food to go....how delightful
Salar T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",43,14,8,1.0,1/1/2015,"We are about to walk out , very poor service. After informing our waiter that our nachos is bad he told us that he will call the manager after 15 minutes he came back with a very cold cup of canned cheese! Nachos was burned and with no cheese . If manager can't take a minute to address the issues with the food ! How can he manage the restaurant. Been to many cheese cake factories and by far this is the worse one"
Shelby S.,"Locust Grove, GA",1,13,,5.0,9/13/2016,"Just can't say enough good things. Enormous menu, huge range of food - everyone can be happy here. The chopped salad is so good that I get it no matter what else I order and take it home. I could literally drink the salad dressing! My only complaint is they took the bananas foster cheesecake off the menu and replaced it with some other not as good banana cheesecake. BOO!"
Alexis L.,"Decatur, GA",0,11,3,1.0,3/10/2016,"Very disappointed with this location. Me and my boyfriend came here to eat after shopping and order shrimp Alfredo and it was AWFUL!!! The sauce was water down, and no flavor. Will not come to this location for any type of pasta"
Chrishaun J.,"Newnan, GA",205,18,16,5.0,1/21/2016,"Went to your Lenox - Atlanta location last week and feel in love with your waiter Kathy. The best customer service in life! I come to this location all the time, but she really made me feel comfortable and welcomed."
Donna F.,"Atlanta, GA",56,28,7,2.0,2/2/2015,"Not fond of this location. Food was mediocre and our service SUCKED so bad that it made the food seem outstanding. It was Super Bowl Sunday, but SO WHAT!! It was also my birthday dinner choice. My night was not nearly as fun as hoped to be because of this experience by a girl who had NO clue how to be a server.  1) IF other's must run out all your food, at least check by to make sure it's satisfactory! (also, remind your food runner to NOT hand your patron her salad OVER THE HEAD of the person next to her in mid air!) unbelievable! 2) drink refills are a good thing! (had to request it twice, while you plainly could see the empty glass)  3) do not ever, ever come to a table to refill drinks, etc. while holding a towel that you JUST USED TO CLEAN THE SEATING next to them!! OMG! 4) Change professions....quick!  I wasn't paying the check so I am positive she was OVER tipped by my sweet friends. VERY disappointed."
Rachel K.,"Duluth, GA",0,2,2,1.0,4/4/2017,"One star for the food zero stars for service. I think that the first impression of the waiter changes your whole experience. Having a bad waiter will make rest of the meal a bad experience. I want to make a shout out to our waiter Justin, the black guy with a beard, for making my birthday and family feel like we weren't special nonetheless a customer at Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if it's because we are Asian that you assume we won't leave good tip so you gave us shitty service from the start, but I would like to say I hope you knew you weren't getting any good tip from your not even mediocre service. As a person who worked at restaurants I always leave 20% tip, more if the server works hard. But you don't even deserve 10%. Learn your table manners, look at me when I talk, and look at me when I ask for something, and look and me while you answer instead of looking over at your other black customers that you feel will give you a better tip. Work for your money dude, you made my birthday dinner feel pretty shitty so CONGRATS ON THAT!"
Nihal S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,51,21,4.0,4/17/2015,I really like this restaurant. The food is delicious and portions are big. Sometimes you need to wait because it is very crowded and it can be noisy.
Prashant R.,"Atlanta, GA",3,21,44,3.0,4/3/2015,"We went to Cheescake factory last night. There was a wait of around 15 mins. That is normal since it was a Thursday evening and also a day before good friday. The server was friendly in the beginning and later while taking order for entrees/appetizers, he was taking dishes from the adjacent table and talking to us. He , from that point of time, did not seem to be interested in serving us. Anyways I ordered Crab and Artichoke dip with bread. It was yum. I loved that. Strawberry lemonade was just too good. The bartender knew how to mix in right proportions.  My wife ordered Margerita pizza and it took long time to come. The waiter did not even bother to ask whether do we need anything else or are we still waiting for something to come. I had to signal him to come to my table and ask why pizza is taking long time. After that it took several minutes for them to bring. The quality of the pizza suffered and it did not look what we saw in the picture.  I am a fan of the food what I ordered, however I am disappointed with the service.  Kindly improve it. I hope when I visit next time, I am forced to write a good review."
Rhana T.,"Atlanta, GA",7,18,18,3.0,2/2/2016,Never been to much of a fan of this place but they are convenient.  The gumbo is not to die for but they have good cheese cake.  Only a plus because this was my first date with my love..
T N.,"Atlanta, GA",12,13,20,2.0,7/24/2016,"The entire floor is very slippery,  we almost fall. Quite a lot of gease on this Sunday  and need maintenence"
Alivia A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,4.0,5/10/2015,"This was my first time at this location, and I must say I was impressed.  It was a busy Saturday evening around 10:30. Myself along with 5 other people were there to celebrate my brothers birthday. Our waiter Quinton was an absolute sweetheart! He made us feel comfortable, and his service wasn't slow at all. I had the shrimp scampi, and it was delicious. The angel hair pasta wasn't the best, but the sauce and shrimp were impeccable. I'll definitely go back to this location again!"
Alicia M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,8,1.0,2/2/2017,"I had the worse experience ever in life at this place and I frequent here quite often. My fiancé and I decided to go a late night date after been apart for almost two weeks because of work! When we walked in the hostess didn't acknowledge us for about 10 minutes and when she did her response was "" what do you need"" after placing our name on the waiting list we took a seat! The wait wasn't long at all maybe 10 minutes so when we were seated she sat us in the bar area at a table. The waiter ""Justin"" came to the table and introduced himself and brought a basket of bread. While going through what I took as a normal routine of telling any specials and recommendations I stopped him to tell him that the silverware was filthy with food still stuck in between the fork prongs and as I examined further the saucer for the bread had a black/brown food debris in the middle so I showed him that... He never said anything but he aggressively grabbed the silverware, napkins and plates up with rage! He mad such a ruckus that the table of 4 sitting next to us stopped eating to see what was going on... He then proceeded to walk off with an attitude to the hostess stand where about 6-8 employees was standing along the manager (that stated he was new there and had only been there 2 days ,he looked like he was of Spanish decent, from Knoxville, Tennessee so he didn't know all of his employees yet) I took it that he went to vent to them about the situation all while still clutching the dirty dishes in his fist. My fiancé was appalled so he got and proceeded to the hostess stand to find out what was all that about and exchanged words with Justin who then stormed off to the kitchen area. The ""new""manager came over to ask what had happened and we explained the situation but he had no remorse for the situation but only thing he could tell us was that he was new and did we still want to dine in! My fiancé didn't want to eat anymore but I wanted to eat bc it was already late and it would be hard to find another restaurant before closing time. He told us he would get us another waiter which was ""Cooper"", he was totally amazing, but the Mgr never apologized but he did ask us what do you want me to do then, of course my fiancé said fire him but I was realistic about the situation and was he needed to be reprimanded for that and suspended so he can appreciate his job because we as consumers keep him with a job! If we don't come in and eat then he has no job. We moved tables because the scene had blown up so everyone in the area was staring to see what would happen next so we moved to feel a little more at ease. I would have thought the manager would have offered some compensation or remorse but of course he didn't but the waiter Cooper made sure he tried to make the experience pleasurable with his outstanding customer service skills. Our bill ended up being about $167.?? and tipped $30 but at no point were we offered a discount or even a heart felt apology. I will never visit this particular restaurant again because I didn't feel like I was appreciated and even after he horrible experience I still ate, paid and tipped but I had to let it be known what had happened! Justin is a horrible disgusting person that shouldn't be working in anyone establishment with that poor customer service!"
