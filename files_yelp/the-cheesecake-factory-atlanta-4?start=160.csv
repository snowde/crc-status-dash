Elyse N.,"Atlanta, GA",20,17,1,1.0,7/31/2016,"I called to place a to go order for dinner as I was in the mall getting my hair done. I was immediately placed on hold without explanation. I preceded to be on hold for 20 minutes. By the time they answered the phone I was in Cheesecake Factory. I walked to the hostess stand where I stood there for about a minute And a half without being acknowledged. I promptly asked for the manager as I wanted to show him that I was placed on hold for 20 minutes.. He just looked at me with absolutely no empathy and said, ""it's Sunday we're busy you're next in line to order and turned around and walked off. That is just absolutely unacceptable behavior for a manager. If you're busy please have your barista answering the phone explain that  I am X person in line. You are not a new restaurant and have been around for years being busy is not an excuse for poor customer service. My expectations is to call to go, place my order, and pick it up in 20 minutes (that's the point it's convenient) If Sunday is historically busy staff accordingly. I ordered my food when I arrived at the restaurant so on top of being oh hold for 20 minutes I waited an additional 40 minutes for my food AND I believe I waited longer because they never called my name when my food is ready.  The two employees I encountered names were Brad (the manager on duty) and Natalie ( barista). I imagine because your restaurant has been around for so long what I encountered is something that doesn't happen often, however I'm very disappointed with my experience and not sure I'll ever come back."
Chrissie M.,"Decatur, GA",34,5,2,3.0,10/11/2014,"Our meal was good, but ironically, my cheesecake was the most disappointing part of our experience.  I've had Cheesecake Factory's hot fudge before and was looking forward to it as a topping for my vanilla bean cheesecake. But instead I got a small cup of a thin chocolate sauce that was clearly not hot fudge. I asked the waitress about it, and she said, ""We have two, the pump and the squeeze bottle. Sometimes the pump acts up and they use the squeeze bottle."" She went back to check on getting actual hot fudge, but returned and repeated, ""Yeah, the pump is acting up."" Seems like they could simply take off the pump and scoop out the hot fudge, but either way, substituting what was clearly Hershey's syrup is not a solution. I would have rather she'd told me they didn't have hot fudge so I could order a different flavor cheesecake. As you can see, I have very strong opinions where hot fudge is concerned, and this Cheesecake Factory location clearly does not have the same respect."
James G.,"Atlanta, GA",35,11,,4.0,2/29/2016,I love the bar area. It is pretty interesting and the staff are great. It is a nice place to sit and have a drink while waiting on my girlfriend who is getting a facial or her haircut. The menu is amazing. It is a fun place to chat with interesting patrons.
Colby H.,"Atlanta, GA",360,18,5,5.0,9/28/2015,The server first off was AMAZING! We went in before closing and he didn't care he served us like we were his best friends. Now to the NACHOS....yooooooo I felt the Holy Ghost in those nachos! If you're hungry order that! I promise you it'll have you slapping yourself it's so good. Also the strawberry lemonade was on point! This place rocks! Love it!
Erin P.,"Atlanta, GA",12,50,985,1.0,6/17/2014,"Seriously??!! It wasn't that busy when we went in. All we were getting were desserts to go. We had to wait minutes for the slice of Pineapple Upside Down Cheese cake and slice of Blackout Cake we ordered. I checked the order and the sliver of cheesecake was about the same size as the to-go fork they gave us. There was a line by this time so I didn't bother to say anything to them and would just have to deal with it (such a scam). What the heck is with this bait and switch Cheesecake Factory pulls with to-go desserts??!! Come on! When one is paying nearly $8 for a slice of cake it better be worth $8 bucks, especially when I know I could get an ENTIRE cheesecake for $8 else where, yeah it's called Publix bakery. Get it together, geez, so annoying."
Jenny T.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,8/29/2015,"I just waited 30 min. At curbside to pick up my order. The rude lady on the phone told me someone would be outside shortly then they stopped answering the phone all together. 20 min. After that, I left so I apologize for not having a review on the food but it probably would've been cold and the ice in my lemonade melted."
Ife R.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,4.0,2/19/2016,"First timer here at Cheesecake Factory. Very nice service here by waiter Joel.  I did happen to find an actual ball of hair in the bread basket which turned my stomach away from the food. With that being said, the manager Moya came out and comped our dessert. She was very friendly and with great service like that, it holds a strong possibility of me returning in the future."
Eric H.,"Atlanta, GA",9,61,12,2.0,6/21/2014,"This location seems to be very unorganized, and the server was generally disinterested and seemed aloof (doing the bare minimum). However, the hosts were very welcoming. For the most part the food was good. The crab wontons were very good and the bread (as always) was good. I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp added, which costs an additional 4 or so dollars. I was a little disappointed that I only got 4 and they were a bit overcooked. The other components of the dish was very good. I know this is a chain, but it presents itself as something above Applebee's and I kind of felt like I got Applebee's..."
Brandi W.,"Tulsa, OK",3,43,23,2.0,10/20/2015,"You can't go wrong with cheesecake specifically,  the oreo cheesecake. Too die for!  I've found that each Cheesecake Factory tends to taste different. I've had better. My food lacked flavor, I really felt like I was at a generic restaurant not as good as those in Georgia."
Justin G.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",6,63,3,1.0,7/22/2015,"So, let me start off by saying I work at the mall and eat here all the time during happy hour with my girlfriend. I'll also add we only have 1 hour to eat there before we are both due at work. Now usually I get pretty decent service and delicious food at the bar, today was different. We asked the hostess if we could sit at the bar or should we wait to be seated. She told us to be seated. After 30 minutes we never received a menu, a glass of water, or even a acknowledgement we were there. All the waiters and waitresses were simply talking amongst each other like they weren't at work but a social gathering. I find that ridiculous, and do not plan on eating there or suggesting any of my coworkers and customers to eat there either. As much as I love the prices, customer service is way more important, I'll pay a little extra if I can at least get a glass of water."
Candice T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2016,I am very disappointed with the quality of service i received at the Peachree location. It took over 30 minutes to receive our appetizers and then my food was burnt. And to top it off the manager Brandon was rude and didn't appologize for food being delayed and burnt. Out waitress Tennye was very appologetec and kind. If I could a zero as a yelp score i would
Swan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",330,183,624,3.0,5/24/2015,"Friends and family in town for the holiday so you know this is the ""go to"" especially if they don't have a cheesecake factory in their city (go figure). Always good for out of town guests to go oooh and aaahh.  But since we've been before, we just stopped in for appetizers and drinks before our ""real dinner"" later lol. We had a lot of fun. The table enjoyed the tomato basil flat bread, spinach artichoke dip w chips,  made to order guacamole w chips, the honey oat wheat bread (the free stuff)  and plenty of drinks including filtered municipal libations (water). Fun environment and the best service overall at this location except for our visit the day after Christmas.  But anywho...great spot to people watch, have some fun with friends and family and even a cool date spot. Love the energy, but the wait is something that causes patience. It was good just not beyond the 3 start category."
Samantha H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,14,,2.0,7/13/2014,"I came here for lunch with a friend and was highly disappointed.  I ordered the lunch salmon special and it was very bland. My friend ordered a soup, salad, and sandwich combo and the bread was as hard as a rock (literally), the soup looked like pancake batter, and her salad was very sloppy.   Since I never complain I barely ate my food but paid for my meal anyway with no complaints. My friend advised our server that she didn't like her meal and ordered something else that was also badly plated and poorly seasoned. The worst of it all was really the service.  I think our servers name was Jaylene.  Apparently, during our dining experience, Jaylene was getting off and the next shift was starting so she asked us 6 times (we counted) if we wanted dessert.  Once before I even ordered my meal (my friend arrived before I did).  My friend eventually asked her if she was getting off and offered to pay our tab.  It's in bad taste to be rushed out of the door at 3pm in the afternoon. Did I mention that the seats were dirty?   Maybe it was an off day."
Bala B.,"Duluth, GA",0,11,,4.0,12/1/2015,"We enjoyed the food, ambiance, service. So a win-win. We also enjoyed the dessert- cheesecake. The portion is large so you can split the main course."
Amber N.,"Inglewood, CA",0,3,1,5.0,7/5/2014,"Amazing! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Huge menu, several pages. Drinks are mostly sweet but they have a large selection. My favorite is the J.W pink lemonade! The bread is great wheat and white. ;)  go early and add name to reservation list, they send you a text when table is ready, so you have time to browse mall. Average 32 a person with a drink! Great for data night! Seat outside.  -AV"
Yonikka T.,"Detroit, MI",220,16,47,5.0,9/5/2015,"I was extremely excited to visit the new Cheesecake Factory at Lenox mall for the first time. I'd done some shopping and walked past on my way in. It was popping! I assumed the wait was long but after working up an appetite I still wanted that darn cheesecake. The hostesses were very organized. For a party of one the wait was 15 mins.. I over heard parties of 3 or 4 with the same wait time. I was asked my cell number to receive a text when my table was ready and I thought that was awesome too. I waited outside on the bench for my table and shortly after I did receive that text. I was quickly seated and then greeted by my server Atika. She was very polite and courteous and also very attentive. I love the eye contact she gave me throughout the night and her beautiful smile. I ordered the passion fruit margarita which did confuse me when it came in a martini glass. I did not send it back because it was extra delicious. I also ordered a small Greek salad, the spinach dip and the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Everything was quick hot and proportioned in big sizes. My favorites were the salad and the drink. The guest around me were having an awesome time too."
Sofia G.,"Ruskin, FL",0,3,,5.0,7/18/2016,Audrianna was amazing! She was on point with helping out our big group of 15 people. Next time in Atlanta I would come back specifically because of her!
Mark B.,"Atlanta, GA",12,131,7,4.0,7/26/2015,"My wife and I had been shopping for several hours at Lenox Mall and needed to rest and recharge, so we opened our Yelp app to see what we might like.  Several places came up I had wanted to try, Zin Burger and True Food.  However, we wanted more menu options and I said ""hey let's go to Cheesecake Factory"" since we had not been in a year or so and not to the new location.   I know what you are thinking, but you know the Cheesecake Factory is usually pretty consistent and there is something for everyone.  The huge portions are a bit much and the place is huge and a little funky, but we were in the mood and it was lunch.  We were promptly seated and greeted by a lovely young energetic server.  I do like their cocktails and since I needed to recharge I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  The cocktail and bread came quickly and we enjoyed sipping and the bread while we decided what to order.  They do make a strong cocktail and I have always liked the oat bread and butter. It takes a minute to digest the ""book"" of a menu.  I have appreciated their ability to produce so many different dishes.  My wife wanted a salad and settled on the vegetable chopped salad.  For some reason the chicken piccata caught my eye.  We decided to have the salad out first and split it and then the entree size piccata.   The salad was nice and cold and fresh.  It is so large that splitting it was great.  Quite frankly we could have stopped there.  Nice fresh vegetables and a very nice citrus vinaigrette dressing.  Our server did not rush us and the entree came out at a perfect time and again the size allowed us to split with not problem.  The sauce was very good, not the best I have ever had but very good.  The chicken was tender and not breaded, which is a mistake I see often with piccata.  There was nice amount of capers and a al-dente angel hair pasta.  I also appreciated that there was not too much garlic. It was a nice meal!  I am giving the Cheesecake Factory four stars because it succeeds in what it is trying to be.  It is not fine dining but a restaurant that has something for everyone, in a nice setting, at a reasonable price."
Sarbeth F.,"Atlanta, GA",71,36,15,1.0,7/30/2014,Service was extremely slow!!!! It took us 45 minutes to receive our cheesecake slices! We had to begged for water several times to get a refill. My friend never received her sour cream for her tacos. The manager David was great and actual gave us a complimentary slice of cake which we received before the original order.
Derek B.,"Alpharetta, GA",514,52,22,3.0,8/25/2014,"We had a gift certificate. We sat down at a bar table where we were told it was seat yourself, aparently that just meant at the high tops. We watched two servers come to the tables on each side of us several times and were never noticed. When we found the manager greeting people and walking about (it was very busy) he appologized and explained and seemed to tell someone to take care of us and so on... When someone finally came over we were told we were not able to do the happy hour specials as we weren't there in time. We got up and left.  Second visit....also very busy. Sat at the bar, some petite brunette who was working her butt off to make drinks at the service bar served us and was very gracious and wonderful. I asked her about a particular dish and knew the cut of meat being used, she said thanks for teaching me something and that it would be valuable down the road. The place was busy, filled with people who would eat at the Cheesecake Factory and that will be the last time I would need to go there. She was great, the food was fine, but who needs corporate run, glorified Perkins chain restaurants?"
