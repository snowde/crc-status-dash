Giselle B.,"Atlanta, GA",88,66,95,4.0,8/22/2015,"It's busy here, but the food is really fantastic. I really love the choices.  From comfort food to lite fare, it really is a great place to eat"
Chancia C.,"Washington, DC",1,35,55,5.0,10/16/2015,I like this location. I arrived and was seated almost immediately on the patio. My food came out pretty quickly...then again it wasn't packed in there. I got the chicken n biscuits with no mash and extra vegetables. It was awesome as always! The waiter was very attentive! Food is regularly priced here but can def go up! All I drank was water.
Letora H.,"Lithonia, GA",10,39,8,4.0,7/20/2015,"This restaurant is one of my favorites, but my favorite one is the cumberland mall location its extravagant love the scenery. Waitstaff was great and punctual. Food was very good cooked just right. Only thing you have to wait so long to get a table so u need patience something i have very little of but i did enjoy it"
Tameka S.,"Conyers, GA",91,32,252,3.0,7/18/2015,"I've eaten here several times, and it's a hit or miss each time. Today was a miss. Service was a miss and the food was just ok.  The desserts; however,  was very good."
Jessica N.,"Norcross, GA",3,37,22,3.0,7/18/2015,"I give this place 3 stars because we must have caught them on a bad night. After telling our sever it was our first time, he did not recommend any popular suggestions and up sell any dishes. It took us awhile to order, but we just went with the pasta that seemed appeasing from its description. The pasta was not seasoned and tasted bland. After taking a couple of bites, I had to use so much salt and pepper, then told our server to add more cheese (pics show the excessive amount of cheese needed). It had a lack of flavor that my boyfriend and I couldn't finish the dishes. We told our server and he suggested he would box it up for us, still not resolving the issue. After asking to speak with the manager and telling her about the food, she said many people do not order the pasta and that is not the restaurant's quality dishes or most popular. She began to name off the popular dishes (as if we knew what to order prior because our server never recommended anything to us). To compensate, she gave us free cheesecake which was awesome of course...it's The Cheesecake Factory! All three cheesecakes were wonderfully made and hit the spot. Next time we come back we will order something else other than the pasta dishes."
Julie V.,"Buford, GA",0,10,,3.0,12/23/2016,"I have to admit that this establishment has gone down with quality of food and presentation since the days of yore.  During the holidays, I would expect exceptional quality for the price and value of your menu items.  The artichoke appetizer was skimpy and poorly executed on the plate.  If it's not in season, don't offer it or at least spruce it up.  The fish tacos were mediocre at best.  Left an unpleasant after taste in my mother and sister's palate.  Gordon Ramsey would definitely agree with me about downsizing the menu since too many items become more clutter than appetizing and attractive to the senses.  I suppose since your establishment is a franchise you have to hold to certain standards, but perhaps reinventing the wheel would be pivotal in elevating your establishment to a new level of success.  Our waitress was very pleasant considering how busy it was during the time of our visit for brunch."
Cong H.,"Orlando, FL",97,1,,2.0,11/28/2015,There was absolutely no assistance and we were standing there like Alice in the Wonderland. I understand it gets busy but you could have been more attentive to your customers. The food is of course wonderful though.
Kitrina D.,"Atlanta, GA",10,219,40,3.0,6/15/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely a go-to! They have so many options, and each is great. Lately I have been ordering the chicken and dumplings, which I would highly recommend. Don't forget to finish off with a piece of Oreo cheesecake!"
Kritika D.,"Decatur, GA",9,1,,5.0,11/5/2015,Really good and great customer service... made my husband's birthday a memorable one.. love the nacos...
Dustin D.,"Sparks, NV",0,1,,1.0,10/28/2015,"This was a sadly poor experience with a large group (14).  From the start we, as a group came in during a slow period in the evening this Wednesday. There were plenty of open tables, yet we stood waiting to be seated for 30 minutes.  The service was exceptionally slow for the traffic this night and the waitress was adamant to let us know early on that it would be ""very difficult"" to split the check as we needed and she preferred to do it in a different manner. Also, later informing us that our checks would take a long time to be dealt with due to the size of the order. It's simple math really. Total in dollars divided by 14. Wow. This is my second time visiting this location this month and my second poor experience, except this time I felt it was necessary to let others know. On this side of Atlanta, you would expect better, quality service. Specifically in the renowned Lenox Square.   To top it all off, the dessert.... You guessed it, cheesecake was also served incorrectly.  Literally, the only reason I came to CHEESECAKE Factory was for the cheese cake. Avoid this location, they couldn't care less about your time or service. Just a sad few experiences for such an ordinarily decent experience.  If you're having a bad day, fine I get it. But you just made over $100+ in tips in one and 1/2 hours. Be grateful you have the opportunity to serve in such a high class area, otherwise you'd probably get stiffed; and that goes for the whole staff. I signed up for Yelp solely to leave this review. Thanks for the memory."
Talwinder S.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",54,4,2,4.0,7/11/2015,"A long wait time. But do not ever miss the good old original cheesecake here. It's the best cheesecake I've ever had. I didn't like the margarita pizza though. I wish they offered a pizza with custom toppings like pineapple, jalapeños, etc. I liked the lemonade. The server was great and courteous. Great ambience!"
Kris H.,"Duluth, GA",2,61,,4.0,3/8/2015,"Me and the Cheesecake Factory go waaaaaaaaaaay back.  This is one of my favorite places to go for good food, good atmosphere, and of course, good cheesecake.  I visited this location for the first time today.  The restaurant, server and food was great, but the parking is murder!  If you decide to come here, don't even bother trying to park in front of the restaurant.  People play Chicken for spots and you'll be driving around for about 30 at least (and we went at 3:00pm).  Drive to the parking desk and walk instead."
Sherry G.,"Atlanta, GA",3,33,107,4.0,6/30/2014,"I like their the outdoor dining place. Good place to relax after shopping at Lenox. Their food is pretty standardized and tasty. The only complaint is that the service was too slow and it took us more than two hours to finish the dinner, probably because there were so many people dining there."
Lynnette L.,"Atlanta, GA",5,23,55,4.0,4/23/2015,Food is always good. Tried something new today since it's my birthday. Shrimp and chicken gumbo awesome. Wait time for everything tooooo long and I'm near the bar. smh
Kaprecha R.,"Atlanta, GA",42,109,55,5.0,3/9/2015,"I have to admit I absolutely love the new location of the Cheese Cake Factory it has relocated to Lenox mall and it could not fit better in this mix of retail. I often opted not to go to Cheese Cake Factory's old location because it was too difficult to enter and exit the parking lot. I love the food, location, and the portion size. I can almost always expect a great meal and leftovers for the next day. Cheese Cake Factory is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and the food is amazing."
Quiba Q.,"Atlanta, GA",5,21,,4.0,6/7/2015,"As far as professionalism, quality and freshness of food is concerned, this is the best Cheesecake location in the area. Luv it!"
Chris B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,52,,1.0,4/13/2015,Visiting from out of town.  Usualy order from chain restaurants to ensure quality of food.  I call at 9:30pm and again at 9:40pm to order a to go order.  Both times i was put on hold for 5 plus minutes after intiail person answered.  Can't imagine that on a Monday night at 9:30pm they are that busy.  Was not impressed.
Jacqueline J.,"Marietta, GA",0,27,1,1.0,3/30/2016,"The worst service ever. And they could care less. I have no intention of ever returning to this over price restaurant. Never understood the hype over generic, bland overly salty food."
Matthew V.,"Atlanta, GA",99,158,117,5.0,2/7/2015,Great service!!! S/O to the manager Mr.Dennis for the amazing service!! I will def be back again.. Ask for Miller to be your server! He's official
Cheezwhiz R.,"Eatonton, GA",3,120,19,4.0,2/7/2015,Busy busy busy that is this chain resturant if you can't find anything you want on this menu something is wrong! Cobb salad was good and big.  The cashew chicken slightly dry but enjoyable.  Food get a 3 Cheesecake gets a 5.   Service was good.   Split the difference for ac4
