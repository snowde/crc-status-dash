Jourdan H.,"Smyrna, GA",10,56,13,4.0,9/15/2014,"Cheesecake Factory never fails us. Whether it's to eat dinner: Macaroni Balls, Fettucine Alfredo, Salmon (yummm) or dessert: Red Velvet, Caramel Apple Strussel, Plain with Strawberries (smack yo mamma good). Good for date night, birthday celebration or for groups. You will absolutely enjoy yourself."
Ndeye N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,,1.0,12/31/2015,Worse service either. Waiter was rude and had our order all wrong. Do not go to this one!! Crowded for nothing!! And the wait time even on weekdays is ridiculous!
Eddie P.,"Mobile, AL",1,21,9,4.0,7/15/2014,"My wife and I ate an early lunch. The food was fantastic. I had the Asian Chicken lettuce wraps and my wife had a small pizza. I was most impressed with the waiter, Terrance. He was extremely attentive and cordial. I recommend this restaurant to anyone with an appetite. The menu is enormous, restaurant is new, clean and chic looking and the service from Terrance was outstanding."
Melissa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,21,,4.0,1/29/2015,best cheesecake on the planet hands down !!!!  food on the otherwise is sometimes good & sometimes it does not taste as good but cheesecake never fails me !
Derek A.,"Atlanta, GA",7,3,,5.0,11/6/2014,Very great meal and exceptional service. I would highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory location!
Michael J.,"Macon, GA",0,33,,5.0,11/2/2014,"This restaurant is a phenomenon to our family. The food is always fantastic service is always nice. the bathrooms are clean.   the prices are fair. The portions are oversized to say the least. It's a great family spot and a great place for a date.  Try the spinach dip. Definitely want to try the spicy hamburger. Sweet potato fries are rockin   And you deathly want to try the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake ""bam """
Terrie C.,"Pensacola, FL",2,8,3,3.0,8/21/2014,I went on a Sat afternoon and the parking was horrible. They didn't have valet parking that day. The service was about average. I still love the Cheesecake Factory.
Andie B.,"Dallas, GA",0,8,,2.0,9/6/2015,"Not sure if it is all the Cheesecake Factories or just this one BUT the Red Velvet Cheesecake is AWFUL. No flavour at all. Did not taste any cream cheese frosting. You would think I would considering it's a CHEESECAKE. Just awful. I got it go. Should have tasted it before I left. I would have asked for another type of cake.  What a disappointment for the price I paid for it. Also, the slices are smaller!!"
Noha A.,"Moscow, ID",1,2,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Stay away from this branch , our family loves Cheesecake Factory for there outstanding service , we went to Las Vegas , Seattle , Washington DC ,San Francisco and Los Angels and this was the worst of them all. First the waiter did not bring the complimentary bread , we ordered Nachos and we asked for the jalapeño to be on the side , the dish came burned and soggy with all the sides on another plate , and it seems like it was leftovers and was reheated . We asked to talk with the waiter since he was busy chatting with another waitress , instead he sent the manager to talk to us . He came and was like what do you want ? We told him that the waiter did not bring the bread and he said it was still in the oven !!! Really 20 minutes and may be over in the oven , we told him about the Nachos he seemed like he does not care , he just shoved the plate and told us that another one will be ready soon ,no apology or nothing !! We were so hungry so we waited , otherwise we would of left at this point . Suddenly the waiter appeared he apologized and asked us if we want to continue our meal or not ?  We told him yes . He brought the bread and the Nachos then came the Fettuccine and the pasta that we ordered , no need to say that the Fettuccine pasta was all broken as if it was the leftovers on the bottom of the pasta box and it was mixed with the other type of pasta that we order , it looks like that they were boiled together !! We left with a very bad experience on this branch , we will never be back again."
Janet C.,"Town Creek, AL",0,1,,1.0,7/28/2015,"Went in for a late night appetizer and dessert. The service started out badly, waiting more than 10 minutes after seating for our server. The time was after 10pm so they were not busy which made me wonder where everyone was. (Found out in short order they were all hanging around the kitchen waiting for closing time.) The staff was loud and inattentive.  Finally placed our order, nothing too complicated. Our server came back in another 5 minutes to say there was no butter for the bread. ??? This is a restaurant right?? Moving along, the food arrived or rather was deposited by a server who could not have been more disinterested if she tried. Well, maybe she was trying because she was damned good at it.  We made it through dinner without seeing our server again, not even for drink refills. For server location see paragraph one.  Now on to desserts. Place our order without a hitch. The desserts finally arrived. Really only two did, the other came in the form of an excuse. ""We don't have hot fudge for your sundae."" They  say. Again, how the hell can you be out of everything.  Two of us had desserts, which were all right but not $8.00 all right. Should have gone to Baskin Robbins.  Over all: The food was average to good. The service was awful. Corporate needs to bring a training team in to audit this location and fix the service team."
Cassie J.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,2,,2.0,6/24/2015,"We came in as a party of 12 which I know can be a but much especially with separate checks. The table was not set completely and another seat had to be added. Service started out okay but there were a few times the server never asked about differences and options in the meal when she should have (ie buffalo or spicy). When bread came out, one server hit one of our guests in the head with the tray. After she took our order, we waited about ten minutes for a refill in water and only because she had come over to let one of the girls know she was unable to get the meal she ordered.  (Mind you this was ten minutes after we ordered). When water came out, another guest had ice and water spilled on her by the server. Food finally came out and servers were calling out orders instead of knowing where the food goes, one had to wait an additional 5 minutes for her food. We got checked on once, dessert was ordered while people were eating, and dirty entree plates sat in front of people until dessert came out. One was supposed to be to go and it came on a plate, a few came out frozen. The only reason for this 2 is the food was excellent and a clearly more attentive server stepped in a few times to help and was much more efficient. Unfortunately the service does not pair well with the food or The Cheesecake Factory name."
Shcharansky D.,"Atlanta, GA",97,2,,1.0,3/3/2016,"We decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory at Lenox Mall on March 1, 2016 around 10:15 pm. Keep in mind they close at 11:00 pm but the service should still be the same as if I had arrived at 2:00 pm especially when your still open to the public. The waitress was a female who seemed ready to get off was always missing in action. I had to keep asking other waitresses can you get her for me. Once the food arrived, the buffalo blast was heavily coated in batter that you could barely taste the meat. Keep in mind I always order the same thing each time I go so I noticed the difference right away. Then when my chicken and biscuits arrived they was luke warm and was not seasoned. My spouse ordered the chicken carbonara which the alfredo sauce was runny like water so we sent it back. Once again we had to ask another waiter to get our waitress and by the time she arrived it is now after 11:00 pm and our original waitress says well the kitchen is now closed. The manager comes over and says let me see if we can get you something else which we ordered a BLT. The BLT comes over and the fries are also luke warm and the manager says he guess they was left over. I never asked for a discount because I pay for what I want so the manager ask me if I wanted a slice of cheesecake and I told him I don't like sweets. He says well I'm trying to offer you a $ 9 cheesecake for a $ 1 fry. Now talk about insult I told him to take the BLT and chicken carbonara off the bill and I wanted corporate's number. This was an experience from hell."
Erica R.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,6,,2.0,2/23/2016,"This is absolutely the worst place to dine at. Let me start by saying that it took 10 minutes to get water, when our server returned we were ready to order. We told her what we wanted as an appetizer and what we wanted as our entree, and yes, we specified. About 15 mins later, we get our entree. A manager dropped it off and asked if we needed anything else. I told him that we ordered an app and that it hadn't come out yet, but we didn't want it anymore because our entrees were already on the table. He says he will go check on it.... He never returned, go figure... Mind you our server has been walking past our table and didn't realize we didn't have our appetizer... We are halfway through our meal and she runs up saying ""oh let me go check on your appetizer"" I tell her we don't want it anymore and that we are ready for the check. She brings the check and I give her my gift card right away so that we can leave as soon as possible. She gives us back the receipt but decides to keep my gift card. What a terrible and untrustworthy thing to do- to a complete stranger. And not to mention how awful the management is. If you see a guest isn't being taken care of, it is your responsibility to take care of them- so that they want to return to your establishment. I will never eat at any Cheesecake Factory unless I have a gift card again, and that will be spent on cheesecake and I will get them to go."
Mary S.,"Columbus, GA",8,2,,1.0,1/11/2015,"The staff were all black and extremely racist. They kept some good tables in good spaces empty and let black people sit there. While they sat the other races on the worst spot, mostly close to bathroom area. When I complained to the front desk, he didn't even listen to my complain. I talked to the manager later and he looked like so indifferent to the situation. Food was good. But, while watching their ongoing mistreatment toward white people, I didn't enjoy it at all. If they want to fix the situation they should include other races in their staff, otherwise, this restaurant will go down."
Adam S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,19,,2.0,1/7/2015,Food good but can't enjoy it when the ac is blowing cold air.  Every person is wearing a jacket.  Manager should turn off the fan if it's broken.  Silly.  Skip this place
Ed S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,16,1,5.0,6/25/2014,You feel like you in Paris eating dinner. Real elegant. The waiter was nice and the food was the bomb.
R N.,"Roswell, GA",0,4,,3.0,8/27/2014,"Good Service!! Cheesecake Factory has always been a bit over rated in my book. It is always overly crowded and never more than a mediocre experience with the food and drinks. Service is normally decent, I have never had an issue (The Original Buckhead Location). Overall it is not truly worth the cost when you combine it with the wait time, which is always outrageous! So this is the relocated location which has moved to Lenox Mall, this is a bummer because going to Lenox is such a hassle in my opinion. We were not aware of the move when we visited recently, or we would have gone elsewhere. We decided to just go anyway. The food was better than usual, not OUT-standing, but pretty good. Drinks were good, & the wait time was fair (because we sat outside and it was fairly warm). I am sorry I cannot remember our servers name but it was last Friday night, the 22nd and we sat outside, she was a slim girl with dark hair and she was OUTSTANDING!! Thank you for making this one of our better experiences!!! I don't want to try my luck again by going back too soon, but I will definitely put them back on my to-do list, to revisit, one day. ***Management remember customer service can make or break your establishment, ALWAYS give 110% it will be worth it!"
Adam S.,"Atlanta, GA",69,34,,4.0,8/13/2014,they have added even more menu items..  many worth  trying...edamame..  new pastas...  was very pleased.   joked with them that they had 500 menu items  cause it sure seemed it.   is getting a bit easier to order vegetarian...points for that   have not been displeased in my visits at all.
