Amanda M.,"Wilmington, NC",6,40,15,1.0,12/17/2016,"Not a good location to go to. 80 minute waits when there were whole sections open. We started out ordering 2 entrees and an appetizer. The entrees made it to the table a good 30 minutes before the appetizer - no grated cheese was offered for either and no apologies either. Drinks remained empty for up to 15 minutes. When we ordered cheese cake the waitress remarked ""oh, is this for here?"" Returning to literally throw the plate onto the table without bringing forks or refilling drinks. We asked a team member to speak with a manager, they acted as they were going to get one and then stated bringing out food for another table. The waitress returned and threw the check on the table and waited for the payment to be placed in it as if she was rushing us out - no manager ever showed up.  Update: contacted customer service per comment, a week after no response."
Steve B.,"Atlanta, GA",12,777,203,4.0,12/11/2016,"Cheesecake factory as we all know is a popular chain.  The decor, ambiance, the food menu pretty much is standard and consistent.  What maybe different going to each one is the service. The service at this location is pretty good or usually is at this location.  Whether you come here for brunch, dinner, lunch portions...they have what you may want.  The pizza is pretty decent. That's the only thing I will add onto this review that I was quite surprised.  Not saying it's good as NY Pizza but pretty ok for that chain's standards.  The cajun pasta is the go to menu item here!  Good place, and can get crowded on the weekends. Grade: B"
Megan M.,"Atlanta, GA",1,75,56,4.0,4/30/2017,"This place is packed on a Friday night around 9pm. The line for a table was so long, I decided to to the fast to-go line for a dessert. Since I don't love cheesecake, I went with the apple crisp. Wow. Two generous scoops of vanilla ice cream and enough apple crisp for 6 people. Excellent value! We took our to-go order and ate outside at the Starbucks tables (no one else was there)."
Ashley L.,"Atlanta, GA",1,8,4,1.0,9/8/2017,"If I could give it a 0 I would. Our server Mirtha G was impossibly slow. I mean impossibly. I went here last night for drinks and dinner with a friend. Never received our bread, one app was delicious the second was horrible. Mirtha would have known had she come back to the table and ask! We weren't going to make a deal out of it instead order an entree to share, except by the time she did come around we'd been waiting so long that we decided to just get the check and have dinner somewhere else. Now I know Cheesecake Factory isn't known for their award winning customer service but this one is far worse than any I've been to. I mean it was a Thursday night, it was slow in comparison to their weekends, SLOW! There was no reason for tables all around ours to be getting refills and checks in timely manner but not ours. Smh. Last night my friend and I swore off Cheesecake Factory forever."
Lauren S.,"San Francisco, CA",219,53,481,5.0,4/3/2017,"The hostess was really friendly and got us in pretty quick.  Cooper was our server tonight and he was awesome. Very attentive, down to earth,  friendly, and great with my little guy!  Food was great: I got the healthy grilled salmon and veggies -- done perfectly! So good!!! And a big portion! My dad got the Cobb salad and switched the dressing-- delicious. And my little guy got the kids pasta w butter and parm-- tasty and he'll have leftovers for lunch! Perfect!  Then came Bebe (BiBi?). She stole the show! Haha She wasn't our server, but she saw my three year old being fidgety and trying to escape from the booth. She swooped in and asked if she could hold him and being the overly friendly guy that he is, he went straight into her arms. She asked if she could take him to the open kitchen lol I needed a mama break-- take him please! lol I watched her take him up and down the food line and show him everything and say hi to everyone. Then she put him on her hip like she did this every day, and continued to check on other tables, at the same time hahaha I love her! My child was loving this. And so were the customers. She had him help her swipe the credit card and press the buttons lol and then got him strawberries as she picked up someone's cheesecake order. You can tell she's a natural with kids, but also that she just naturally goes above and beyond for people. She was so great, and I truly needed that mama break! Thank you for having such great customer service and loving servers!  I just moved here from Cali, and we'll be back for sure to this location!"
Malika S.,"Augusta, GA",4,23,35,5.0,6/4/2017,My food was really good and the staff was attentive even though they were very busy. I got this bacon burger and the cheese was delicious. I would go again.
Beth K.,"Napa, CA",12,132,112,1.0,5/2/2017,"Well I was expecting a great lunch here. I ordered a Vegan Cobb salad. It came covered with black pepper. I know I'm not a local to Atlanta but Who serves salad with black pepper all over It, usually they ask. I returned the salad and asked for no black pepper well they couldn't do that either. I'm sure they just scraped off the black pepper and returned it as it was, there was less black pepper so I just move the stuff with black pepper on it to the side and did my best to enjoy the salad.  Then I found slimy endive, yikes!  The salad concept was great but the salad wasn't. Unfortunate lunch for me won't be back!"
Crissy F.,"Houston, TX",1,34,8,1.0,5/28/2017,"-1 star. Never again. I ordered a 6 inch cheesecake for my mom ( I usually avoid this place like the plague) at the counter & was told it was ""severely chilled"" a/k/a frozen so it would take 15-20 min. After 30 minutes, I inquired & was told someone was pulling it. At 45 min, I checked again. Other people who ordered after me got theirs before me. Finally I got it after 50 minutes! I got home & it was still 100% frozen (like their other pre-made chain food). Why the heck make me wait almost an hour just to go up to the freezer & pull out a frozen cheesecake. When I discovered this at home I called to complain & was told the reason was miscommunication, they were busy, they shouldn't have told me it was going to be 15 minutes, etc....  Terrible service! Low quality food. Long lines. Overpriced. Just avoid this place. You'll have a better experience getting a cheesecake at Kroger."
Becky S.,"Evans, GA",1,28,22,4.0,3/17/2017,"My husband and I come here every time we are in Atlanta to get cheesecake. This is the first time we've ever actually eaten here. It did not disappoint! The stuffed mushrooms were outstanding! Probably the best I have ever tasted! Cooked perfectly and full of flavor. I had the skinny lettuce chicken tacos Asian style. I could have drank the sauce, it was so good! My husband got the wings and said they were good too. Glad we decided to eat lunch here, can't wait to do it again!"
Jessica P.,"New Orleans, LA",0,7,6,4.0,5/28/2017,"I have been here several times and the food is always delicious. They serve complimentary warm bread once you are seated that is very yummy. The Tex Mex egg roll appetizer was warm and accompanied by an avocado sauce that goes perfectly with it. For my entree I ordered the fresh basil and tomato flatbread which was pretty good. I personally needed a sauce with it so my waitress recommended the creamy marinara which made it much better. The only complaint I have is that the menu is entirely too long so it's difficult to narrow down the options. My server Amy was amazing and made sure we were satisfied throughout the entire dinner. Overall, the experience was pretty good."
Evelynn B.,"Atlanta, GA",10,28,8,4.0,4/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory changed my mind for the better about the Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain.  I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory in my life until I moved to Atlanta, the thought of the immense menu made me question how quality the dishes must be....but if Drake loves it so much that he'll write a song about it...there's no way I'm going to miss out on trying it out, so I went appropriately to the one attached to Lenox mall.  I've frequented this particular cheese cake at least 6 times for both take out and dine in.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly, no matter how busy it is, because it does get very busy on weekends (so keep that in mind).  The food has always been delicious, I usually get the ""grilled steak medallions"" off of the ""skinny"" menu.....trust me, they don't taste skinny the dish taste amazing!  And obviously desert....NEVER disappoints, I usually get the Reese's Cheesecake...not to be confused with the Adams peanut butter cheese cake...I personally this the Reese's Cheesecake is better!  An issue I have with this particular restaurant is that the line between people picking up food-ordering strictly cheesecake/dessert - and people waiting to be seated verses waiting to put their names in for a table gets VERY compacted and confusing in regards to your place in line and where you have to be to get what."
Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, GA",949,1375,5317,3.0,1/19/2016,"I haven't been to this Cheesecake Factory since it moved over from further down Peachtree Road. Cheesecake Factory has always been a part of my Atlanta chain restaurant staples. My first experience at a Cheesecake Factory was at the original Buckhead Cheesecake Factory. The wait on a Friday night was pretty long for 2 people. My sister and I got to the restaurant around 9:30PM and waited for about 25 minutes. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, and were constantly being interrupted by people leaving or entering the restaurant through the mall entrance in the back. We rarely saw our server, but were served our basic needs, albeit at a slow pace. My sister ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was SO sickly sweet. She asked for a free refill, but even my sister, Queen of sugary sweet things, couldn't finish a second glass. She ended up taking a to-go cup.  THAT BROWN BREAD THOUGH. I know it's not pumpernickel, but we trick ourselves into thinking it is so maybe it doesn't seem as unhealthy. Not that using an entire stick of butter on the bread is any better. It took a while to get to us, but once it did, it was soft and warm.  My sister and I split a pasta and an order of calamari. I got tired of the calamari real fast - my sister didn't like it so I ended up eating the whole $12 appetizer order of fried squid. It was just too much. I prefer not to take fried food to go, so I ended up leaving 1/4 of it there. My sister ordered the tomato basil pasta, and it wasn't too bad - just a standard pasta. My sister is a picky eater, and didn't like the pesto drizzle on top - that was NOT listed in the menu. She tried to eat around it, but as the trend goes, I ate most of her meal.  Overall, the food and service was at par, but that's about it."
Garrett O.,"Powder Springs, GA",893,147,678,4.0,1/8/2017,"I am honestly shocked that this place is a three. If you have ever had the Cheesecake Factory the name alone is a three and everything else is just a plus. The only reason I am giving this place a four instead of a perfect is because of the wait time after we were done eating and the time it took for the waiter to come back and provide us with the desert menu. I will say that we came right with they opened so it was very easy to get a seat. Also, I asked the seater for a table and he gave us a booth (I didn't bother to correct him). The variety of food is too much as always. I was switching back and forth between a salad and macaroni burger. I thought it was a little crazy that the salads were almost $20, so I ended up getting a burger. I guess part of the price is the experience. Of course if you come to the Cheesecake Factory you have to get some Cheesecake. Was a little disappointed they didn't have the Khalua available at that time, but no harm no foul. The wait time for the food wasn't long, but again, we came right when it opened. Your experience might be different, but I honestly cannot complain."
Matthew S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",239,9,,1.0,2/3/2017,"Way too many tables for one sever. Took my girlfriend and I 2 hours to eat a burger. Never were asked for refills, never got a new drink.  Awful service and cold food. The poor guy was trying but had over 10 tables that I could count."
John E.,"Atlanta, GA",1070,642,7816,3.0,7/3/2016,"I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory. In general I like the food, it's always tasty and the portions are huge. The problem is the long waits to be seated and an overall lackadaisical attitude from the servers. Oh they're very attentive when around, but at times it seems half the table needed drinks and the server was taking a break or something. Who knows? My second gripe is with the menu - just too many choices. My thought is that everything can't be good? as they'll have to keep so many ingredients ready that it seems there would be a lot of spoilage.  At least my crispy Asian salad was tasty."
Carmen L.,"Buford, GA",171,118,720,3.0,7/9/2017,"Average food. Great cheesecake. I only came here for the cheesecake. There wasn't a wait when we arrived. Our waitress was okay, refills took awhile and took a long time to get change for our bill. We started off with an egg roll sampler. It came with A Variety of Egg rolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon. Some was a hit some was a miss. They give you three different sauce to dip as well. It was okay but I will not order it again. We ordered lunch portions. I order the Louisiana chicken pasta. It is Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. I thought the chicken was too plain with no dipping sauce. My boyfriend ordered the famous factory meatloaf. It is Served with Mashed Potatoes, Mushroom Gravy, Grilled Onions and Corn Succotash. He thought it was mediocre. Nothing too fancy. I thought if they didn't have so many items on their menu the food would taste better. We finished off with a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. It was delicious! My favorite part of the meal."
Sep S.,"Ithaca, NY",3,33,4,1.0,11/10/2017,Terrible service with extremely long waiting times. And they always underestimate waiting times.
Nishant G.,"Atlanta, GA",444,255,101,5.0,6/2/2017,Consistent food. Great service. Positive dining experience. Kayla was our server and she was great. 5 stars.
Naazir R.,"Avondale Estates, GA",0,1,2,1.0,8/10/2017,"Dirty silverware and dishes. Smart-ass manager, ""I'm sorry, we don't polish our plates."""
Buffy S.,"Atlanta, GA",44,256,34,1.0,11/13/2016,"The food is standard, mostly bland and u had to search for fish thru the breading of the southern catfish. But my main problem with this one is service. It seems Cheesecake Factory in general has declined in quality of service or they just don't care who they hire or how they train them. The only one who actually smiled in this place was the hostess. She was lovely. Otherwise our waitress was non attentive and her attitude was not cool.  First, we had leftovers so wanted to pack the rest to go. She cuts me off and says ""well I don't know what u want so I'll just bring u out a couple boxes"". And walked off rolling her eyes. Um ok... Then wanting to pay I had an online gift card so I take out my phone and before I even open my mouth or show her anything she says ""we don't do coupons here"". Coupons?! Who said anything about coupons?! And mainly the whole time stomping around our table rolling her eyes. Wth is that about?? And when getting up to leave, keep in mind my mother needs a walker to get around, another server is behind her rolling her eyes like she's saying ""hurry up!"". Let's see how u are thirty years from now and disabled u bitch. This is the worst and most rude place I've been.  Anyway it would take a miracle for me to go back to any cheesecake factory restaurant. Not worth the aggravation."
