Stacy K.,"Burr Ridge, IL",320,177,928,3.0,9/12/2015,"Cheesecake Factory Pros: Location, Cheesecake & menu selection  Cons: Service I like the atmosphere and I love the location of this Cheesecake Factory, however the service here is hit or miss. With that being said, I don't go here very often. I've had a few experiences where the waiter wasn't very helpful, if the waiter was available at all. The food is ok but it's not something that makes me want to tell all my friends about it. The best thing about this location is the fact that it's attached to Lenox mall, the cheesecake and the beautiful atmosphere.  They could do a better job with making sure the staff treats every customer with superior customer service.  Overall my experience at the Cheesecake Factory could have been better but due to the amount of restaurants in the Atlanta area I don't have to go to the same place over and over again.  I only recommend this location if your looking for amazing cheesecake. If you do go here I sincerely hope your waitress/waiter understands the importance of customer service."
F M.,"Navarre, FL",78,6,,2.0,10/21/2017,"I did NOT enjoy my dining experience. We were sat in a secluded booth area in the back of the establishment near an exit. The walls looked smudged and sticky.  It took ENTIRELY TOO LONG to order/receive drinks, order/receive appetizers, order/receive food. On top of this, my order was incorrect even after writing it down! After consistently misordering every course of the meal and sending the food back, the manager NEVER bothered to inquire why. After having to walk up to the hostess counter, I finally get my bill, the bill was incorrect too! This experience is not indicative of what I've experienced from other Cheesecake Factory chains (CA, SC, NC, GA). Seems like it is only like this in the Southeast...losing my business and that of 1000 other people I know by the minute...shame"
John M.,"Byron, GA",0,31,,3.0,10/19/2017,"Food has gone downhill. Still good, but not great and prices still high. Service was slow and drinks went without refills."
Kirby F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,2.0,10/14/2017,"Stealing is bad.  Food was really good, service was good, only a 5 minute wait on a Saturday evening, should have been a great visit.  But the server pulled a fast one.  We paid with a gift card, server said there was $4 left on it, we left a cash tip.  Decided to get cheesecake on the way out but suddenly the card had a $0 balance - turned out the server had added the $4 to his tip on top of what we left!!  Took the manager 20+ minutes to sort out; she put the $4 back on the gift card and comp'd 2 of the 4 pieces of cheesecake we ordered.  So it was handled pretty well but stealing is bad, not sure if we'll go back...."
Marlin S.,"Atlanta, GA",208,187,241,4.0,11/17/2016,The bar and the bartenders all get a thumbs up! They are pouring heavy and very attentive! Love it love it love it! What more can you asked in a $12 Long Island!
Sabrina W.,"Accokeek, MD",249,92,42,3.0,5/30/2017,"Meh. My family ate here with a friend this weekend and were not impressed. The Greek salad was bland and the best salad was off. How do you mess up salad?! The orange chicken was mediocre. My hubby did like the chicken sliders. Overall, nothing to brag about and nothing to pay $100 for."
Amanda R.,"Decatur, GA",0,83,61,5.0,8/5/2017,"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars on the overall rating? I had a good experience here when I came for lunch. I was seated promptly, and the waitress- Kayla was super cool and very pretty. She had a great attitude and was very accommodating throughout the dining experience. The food was fresh, and the place was nice and clean (including the restroom). This was my first time at THIS location. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try!!"
Sonia K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,18,4,1.0,6/8/2017,I DESPISE this location!!! My to go order is ALWAYS wrong!! I live down the street from this location but go out of my way to perimeter where my order is always correct and the staff have better attitudes! I've even written in and complained about the Lenox location. Nothing changes. My salads always have discolored avocados!! Why??? Only here. So annoying!!
Michelle T.,"Atlanta, GA",289,197,871,3.0,1/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is like a buffet. Tons to choose from, but the quality may not really be there.  I have had good stuff here and I have had bad stuff here.  It's the luck of the draw really.  It's your typical American dishes with a little flair by adding a new skinnylicious menu and large portions.  The salads I have to say are really good! The cheesecake is even better. So many choices, so little time.  Good thing they have a walk up counter for the cheesecake so you don't have to dine in to get some.  I was annoyed at the hostess stand because we had a party of 5 and of course they don't seat until the whole party is there. Fine, those of us who are there are checked in.  But when our party was fully there, we had to wait? So I am confused because logic tells me I been had my name on the list, we checked in, we are now all here, then I should be next, right???? Nope we had to wait, and wait too long where we had to say something.  No Bueno in my book.   Our server was nice; she was just a little bit busy. The food took a little time to come out so I was thankful for the bread.  The bread is great comes out warm.  The butter should be room temperature as well. Overall ok experience."
Ana A.,"Tucker, GA",227,3,,5.0,6/19/2017,"We sat outside very nice, quiet & kind of romantic place with dimmed lights, loved it. The food was AMAZING. I got extremely full which never happens because most places make pastas in small portions. I also got a cheesecake, it was delicious. DEFINITELY coming back."
Michelle K.,"Atlanta, GA",636,620,3618,5.0,1/12/2015,"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review for this location since I've been here about 3 times in the past 2 months.  First off, Cheesecake Factory is great because no matter who you dine with, there's always something on the menu for everyone. The menu takes at least 5-7 minutes or more to view from cover to cover.  That's why it's the perfect place to go to if you're just craving a predictable menu with solid service.  Oh, and I'm sure most of you dine here for their dessert menu as well. The last couple of times I was here, I went for a birthday brunch and happy hour.  Our brunch group was over 10 people and the service as stellar. We could not have asked for a better team of servers that took great care of us.  I ordered from their lo-cal menu and got their BBQ chicken salad. Portion size was perfect and my chicken was well cooked.  On another visit, I went to their happy hour on a weeknight with a dear friend, Morgan W., before heading to the YELPmas holiday party and sitting at the bar was quite the experience. Our bartender that night didn't quite understand that waiting 15-20 minutes for a drink order was frustrating because he just assumed his order was being handled by another team member.  Luckily for him, I wasn't in the mood to get i-rate so I just asked one more time for my friend to check on her drink order and that was all it took. My last visit was yesterday and decided to order something complete different.  The Chicken Madeira was calling my name because it came with their infamous mashed potatoes and asparagus. My chicken was cooked well and had this delicious, tangy and sweet sauce that seemed soy sauce based.  I dug it and completed my entire plate. It came with about 2 pieces of chicken breast (grilled) topped with melted mozzarella cheese, sautéed mushrooms, and the grilled asparagus. YUM.  Our server was fantastic. She was on the ball and gave me my extra plate of lemons for my water and tea and made sure that our tea mugs were always half full.  Kudos to our server for taking great care of us on a busy Sunday!!  I look forward to returning for future happy hours during the week since my office is less than 10 minutes away and post shopping lunch and dinners."
Kelly A.,"Lake Junaluska, NC",89,6,2,2.0,8/20/2016,"I usually love the cheesecake factory but this location wasnt impressive. The wait was long and when they called our name they told us the hostess would then help us. She walked away while we stood there confused as what to do. They were extremely busy so this was understandable but they were out of bread and we were hungry from the long wait. The three of us all got pasta dishes and that as well took an extremely long time. The food was good, but not worth the time we spent waiting at every step."
La Vonia D.,"Douglasville, GA",0,11,14,5.0,5/3/2017,Simply the best of Service!  Bravo to Jonathan our server.  He was very attentive and professional.  Great management team--Nicole and Michael are the epitome of hospitality and professionalism.
Meredith H.,"Alcoa, TN",118,7,5,5.0,5/3/2017,"Our lunch here was delightful today. We had Jonathan G. as our server and he took great care of the group of ladies we had today for a work lunch. The operations manager, Nicole Davis is always helpful when planning an event or group coming to eat. Thank you for the hospitality and great food."
Jason E.,"Johns Creek, GA",144,44,282,3.0,4/2/2016,It is Amazing!! Love the veggie burger is so tasty!! It is a brown rice burger and seasoned just right. The Old Fashioned Burger was cooked medium. It was very juicy.  The garlic noodles with chicken I would say was a 3 out of 5. Had a small piece literally just a piece of chicken on the pasta and the piece that was there had a bone in it with little meat. Had to request the manager to get extra chicken in which they then questioned if the chicken came with the meal. Really? Had to stop eating to wait for rest of chicken because it took another 14mins for the new chicken to come out.  Brown bread is the bomb enough said for now.
Kennith H.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,18,49,1.0,2/4/2017,Going to the Lenox Mall location on a Saturday I knew it was going to be a wait. When I called to the desk for my table what caught me attention was seeing one of the hostess pick up a dirty rag with silverware in the same hand to go wipe down a table. If she and the other hostess did the same thing with all the tables think about the germs that were spreaded since they place the silverware on the bare table tops. It's been a couple of years since I been to a Cheesecake Factory and I hope what I saw is not a common practice. Men restroom was dirty also.
Gwen J.,"Buford, GA",38,26,10,4.0,5/24/2017,Visited this location this past weekend and put our names on the list. We were told it would be 40-45 minutes before we would be seated. We went to a store in the mall to kill time and was surprised to receive the text within 30 minutes that our table was ready. I ordered the butter lettuce wrap Mexican tacos and they were delicious and filling. Great choice for anyone looking to cut back on carbs.
Ryan S.,"Chicago, IL",83,5,,2.0,7/28/2016,You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory or can you?? The wait was supposed to be for 40 min for a table of two during peak hours but since we asked to sit outside or first available during a hot day it really only was 10 minutes. Kudos!  Now here's my problem. My friend and I split the bill and a couple days later I checked the balance and someone apparently decided my 20% tip wasn't enough and added an extra $2 and some change on my bill and also on my friends! Check back with your accounts after it fully processes to make sure this doesn't happen. Also I called and spoke with a manager who said this would be resolved in 3-5 business days and well... It never was... Thanks for making me do all the dirty work of calling my bank and refusing the charges when they should have resolved the issue in the first place.
Grace T.,"Charleston, SC",26,130,29,2.0,10/21/2015,"The service here kind of sucks. That alone docked the review down to two stars. We stood in front of the bakery/cheesecake display for a long time, there were no other customers, and no one offered assistance to see if we wanted to buy anything, so they lost our business there. In addition, when we went to get seated at the front reception area, we weren't acknowledged for at least 10 minutes, and there was nobody else waiting for service! When they finally took our names, there wasn't even a wait to be seated, so I really wonder what kept them from just looking at us and saying, ""I'll be with you in a moment."" It was truly frustrating, especially because we were there to have a nice dining experience.  The only thing that saved this review from going down to a one-star experience was the food. The food was really good. My boyfriend and I both ordered the chipotle chicken pasta with an appetizer of the buffalo blasts, and we were impressed. I think the price of the food, although a bit pricey, was comparable to the quality of food served. We will definitely visit the Cheesecake Factory again, but we won't ever go back to this location."
Emeka A.,"Nashville, TN",131,59,5,4.0,3/17/2017,Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. Never disappointed. Always satisfied. They have great drinks and even better desserts
