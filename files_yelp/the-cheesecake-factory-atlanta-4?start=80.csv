Vicki E.,"Asheville, NC",0,4,,2.0,4/11/2017,Wait was over an hour.  No bread-asked waitress and received an attitude-food was average at best.  Cheesecake slices have decreased in size.
Jaymz H.,"McDonough, GA",0,3,1,3.0,12/22/2016,Thai lettuce wraps are awesome.  Bathroom be hella dirty sometimes.  Fast seating even on busy days. Parking is Decent unless it's a holiday
Justin L.,"Lilburn, GA",3,1,,2.0,7/26/2017,"Great food, our waitress was fantastic, but the wait for our food was unforgivable. It was busy, which I understand, but there's no excuse for a 50 minute wait for food. We were even told a cook forgot to put bread in the oven so we were waiting on bread that whole time too."
Chanel R.,"Atlanta, GA",5,31,121,4.0,1/19/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at Lenox Square Mall is amazing for its ambience. The lightings of the restaurant are dim and yellow, the concept of the restaurant décor is mixed, it can be romantic but also suitable for groups and gatherings. There is a bar too, so the noise level is quite high and not suitable for business meals. The seats at dining area were not very comfortable, the tables are quite small for two especially if you are going to order a lot of food.  I came on a Saturday, the restaurant was crowded, however, not difficult to get a seat. The staffs at the front desk were attentive and they serve you right away when you entered. Few tables were assigned to each waiter/waitress, so he/she will definitely be attentive to serve you. I was quite satisfied with my waitress. At times, she was too busy serving other tables, but she came back to check and apologized.  Before the meals hit the table, I was served with two different kinds of fresh baked breads, brown honey wheat bread and sourdough. The breads were soft and served hot, goes well with butter.  I ordered the Cabonara spaghetti pasta Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce and Tortiglioni pasta with meatballs. The portion of the dishes were filling, pastas were cooked well and the taste was quite ok. I would say a 5/10. As for dessert, I ordered a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. The cheesecake was a little wet and too sweet, too much whipped cream. I was quite disappointed as I was having high hopes on Cheesecake Factory since cheesecakes are their main iconic food. I give it a 4/10. I will still visit again when I crave for dessert, willing to give it another try. The service is great, the ambience is nice, the food was ok, slightly costly. Overall Rating 5/10."
Steve R.,"New Orleans, LA",0,46,16,4.0,3/22/2017,I really like the variety of the menu. I tried something different today called Evelyn's special pasta it was excellent. This location is very clean. Also they offer a happy hour menu from 4-6 Monday- Friday. I look forward to going back.
John E.,"Atlanta, GA",202,6,1,1.0,3/21/2017,Stopped here for lunch and the service was horrible. Me and a friend sat at the bar and the bartender was very pleasant but took 30 mins it's just to make a martini and old fashioned. The food came about 20 minutes later but my friends second dish never showed up. The server even walked up and asked did we still want the second dish.  We said yes and it still never came. The manager was called and she stated that she didn't see a second dish. Smh. What in the world!!!! It suddenly came out hot and ready. Upon receiving the tab it had been comped. I guess that was the ok part. But more so I always like to have excellent service. Not so sure about visiting here again.
Yegor S.,"Newark, CA",0,23,4,1.0,10/16/2016,"I walked in and placed to go order. Cashier advised that it will take 15 to 20 min. Well, it took 30 min for the food to be ready and then 45 more min to CHECK ME OUT! Great management! Nothing else to add. Actually there is - the order ended up messed up!  This is not even funny to read, huh?"
Brian Y.,"Atlanta, GA",52,12,,5.0,9/13/2016,Bacon bacon burger was a monster of a burger to devour! I recommend that burger to any of my friends any day. It had different types of bacon on the burger and it gave jt a sweet and smokey taste.   The filet mignon was well worth the price of 30$.  I will definitely be coming here again soon.
Kim J.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,176,63,4.0,5/13/2016,Went for dinner with the family on a Friday night around 8:00p and there was a 39 minute wait. It was a little confusing as to where we needed to sign in but once we found the right line they took our number and texted when the table was ready. It actually only took 20 minutes.  Our waiter Kevin was the bomb dot com! Very attentive and thorough. Good communication with us all night and sent us home with a loaf of that amazing bread!  Food was great. My dad is obsessed with the calamari especially since he's been looking for some good calamari lately. I had the Greek Salad and Feta/Sausage Flatbread which is my go-to. My stepmom had the jambalaya pasta and it was off the hook! Huge portions so be ready!!
Richard M.,"Swainsboro, GA",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2017,Don't know if it's because of the shift changing or what 90% of the staff was rude and we waited over an hour after the appetizers for our food. I won't be visiting this establishment in this area again
J C.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,99,40,1.0,12/17/2016,Just placed an order for the office of about 20 people... The order was totally messed up... Upon notifying the restaurant of the missing we were told we needed to pay for the items that were missing again after spending over $1000.  So I am going to pay extra for something already paid for - Okay. The representative that we dealt with was quite rude. He made a mistake but however we were forced to pay for it because his listening skills were not up to par. So I would highly recommend that anyone beware when doing catering or individual orders. Totally ruined our office Christmas Luncheon.
Theresa H.,"Atlanta, GA",56,290,1674,3.0,7/10/2014,"Writing this review while I am still here, still standing and waiting for a table after more than 45mins wait. The buzzer buzzed some time ago, we handed the buzzer to the hostess. She took the buzzer from us, did not say a word and turned away from us. We are clueless, not sure when we are getting our table. Finally someone called one of my friend's name, we followed her just to be told to wait again as table was not ready. No apologies, nothing. Yup, we are the dumb people who chose to come here and being snubbed by this 5 star fancy restaurant. We deserve to be treated badly! Seriously??? The lack of basic customer service among the hostess(es) was appalling. Why are these incompetent people even here?? Yes, the place was busy, people kept coming in and the inadequate of proper place to accommodate those who were waiting for a table. But that is no excuse to be rude and snooty. By the way, whoever designed this place is a joke. People were standing in front and everywhere simply because there is no designated area for them to wait for their table. More waiting... Finally.. Our table is ready.. (To be continued) ... It's 10pm now, just got home..  Continuing from earlier... After almost 2 hours, my friends got their food. Shortly, a gentleman came to our table (whom I  believed to be the manager) started apologizing, letting me know the fish & chips I ordered has gone missing. He said he has already asked the kitchen to redo the fish & chips and it would be out shortly in a minute or two. I felt a lot better even though my fish & chips has gone AWOL, at least someone came and informed me and apologized for the wait. Our server, David, who has been very nice all these while also came and apologized about the long wait for the food.  Based on that only, I have gone ahead and amended my review draft from a 1 star to 3 stars.  Food was good but I supposed a piece of bread will be just as tasty. I was starving since like about 3 hours ago. At the end of the night, the check came and David told me they have taken off the fish & chips. I thanked him for that, took care of the bill and off we left. We lived like a couple of minutes away from the mall. By the time I got back home, it was like 10pm.  It was a disaster to come here for dinner. Guess the manager and our server managed to save this place by helping to bump this review from a 1 to 3 stars.  Phew!! What a night!!"
Semira A.,"Atlanta, GA",49,10,3,2.0,1/13/2017,"Only because I was in such a mood for cheesecake that I braved the rainy weather did I TOLERATE the outright filth of this establishment. Not what you'd expect hanging out at Lennox and all. The smell hits you as soon as you step in the door. Like all the tables had been wiped down with a dirty rag and the bar taps have never once been steam cleaned. You seriously got to hold your breath and get really tipsy to get comfortable. One word, unsanitary."
Stacy L.,"Sharpsburg, GA",37,1,,3.0,7/30/2017,"Visited the restaurant for the first time this evening.  Our server was great, even suggested a different dish for me to try, that was great.  Service is on the slow side, which I didn't mind between appetizer and entrees, it gave us time to visit and chat.  However, the hour long wait to receive our desert was quite ridiculous.  An hour, really to receive our cheesecake?  During this hour the server passed by once to apologize and we didn't see her for awhile, asked another server for refills on drinks that sat empty for this hour, she never brought them.  Then finally our cheesecake arrived packaged and ready to go for the hour long trip home.  Get home and the 2 orders that were to go orders were wrong.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory for making us wait an hour for an incorrect order.  If it wasn't for the fact it was my daughters birthday, I would have walked out without them. Suggestions for others, order your dessert when you order your drinks."
Audrey M.,"Atlanta, GA",25,13,,1.0,2/11/2017,"We arrived at 3:30pm to celebrate a pregnant friend.  After getting past the lack of parking, we check in and was told the wait would be a while.  We repeatedly checked in with the Maitre D's who acted as if they did not care.  We finally gave up 2 hours in and left.  The text message letting us know our table was ready came at 7pm!   I would not recommend this place to anyone.  There are better places to eat in the area like Tuk Tuk, California Kitchen or Red Pepper Taqueria."
Tatiana V.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Very poor service. Went here last night. Waiting an hour for a glass of wine which never came. Ended up leaving without waiting any longer because who knows when the food would come. Go to True food kitchen, always good food and service!"
Helen H.,"Duluth, GA",290,703,850,5.0,5/2/2015,Typical Cheesecake except this one seems to be less busy than the one in Sandy Springs and smaller. I guess its because this is considered a cheaper alternative in Buckhead and also a bit boring with all the great restaurants buckhead has to offer. We just choose this place because it was in the mall so it was easy and convenient and ricky wanted his lunch cocktail and I wanted the bread lol.
Donika B.,"Conyers, GA",0,4,3,5.0,1/19/2017,"Great customer service! Came here for a friends birthday on a Thursday night, the location is perfect. The lighting is really dim which makes or perfect for a nice date with your significant other. The drinks are also strong and worth the money. Not too pricey at still I would definitely come here again."
Victoria B.,"Augusta, GA",4,28,33,2.0,2/29/2016,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory restaurant at the Lenox Square Mall yesterday (2/28/16) and I had mixed feelings about the visit, so I decided to give myself 24 hours cool down before writing this review.  First, the Cheesecake Factory is a chain. We have eaten at various other stores and are familiar with their offerings. As usual, have rave reviews for the food and drink. Everything was delicious, well-seasoned and the quality I like to see at restaurants. In addition, our server Brittany was fast, efficient and very pleasant. Cudos all around for her performance. Where this visit went off the rails was at reception. The hostess was nice, but seemed a little frazzled. We were given a 40-minute wait time and instructions on how to respond to the page to my cellphone. Waits at Cheesecake Factory are business as usual, so we took a seat outside. As we waited, I counted 5 empty (dirty) tables waiting to be bussed. The hostess actually cleaned one of the tables when she came to seat guests, but the remaining four were dirty the entire time we watched during our wait. After we were paged and went inside, there was another queue to wait in for a hostess to seat us. Once again, I counted 3 booths and a table (visible from where we were standing) that were dirty and in need of clearing before seating other guests. A number of other guests who had already been paged were lining the walkway and waiting to be seated. (This design created an obstruction to the walkway and a potential hazard.) As we were seated, I noticed that in places the floors were slippery, but this could have been just a spot or two of water spilled on the floors. While we enjoyed our meal, I did notice that a manager was clearing tables, so it's possible this was an isolated incident, but this is the type of thing that spreads ripples through an entire service. Uncleared tables lead to decreased capacity and longer wait times. These in turn poorly flavor the guest experience and affect return visits. Our visit was early (3pm) Sunday afternoon, not during the busiest service at all. All things considered, we're happy with the food, but with other comparable competition, no longer make The Cheesecake Factory a regular dining experience."
T F.,"Stone Mountain, GA",0,21,1,4.0,7/15/2017,"Sam was a great server.  Parking is a beast.  We all enjoyed our food..California Guacamole Salad, Steak with Wasabi potatoes, Turkey burger and veggie burger. Eating out is most times pricey this was overall a good experience."
