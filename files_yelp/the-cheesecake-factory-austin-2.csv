Barbara P.,"Cameron, TX",5,35,4,3.0,11/29/2017,Food was great but the lady hostess was very unfriendly!   Tried to make her smile but nothing worked.   First person you meet should be friendly.   Need to put someone else as hostess!
Sarah H.,"Wellington, FL",89,113,253,3.0,10/26/2017,"I hate to come to Yelp to write a bad review BUT I'm totally dissatisfied with my Cheesecake experience yesterday. My son has swim class off Bee Cave so I decided to treat myself to two of my favorite things from TCF; pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and their French country salad. I looked a hot mess after the pool so I called my order in. Customer service was great, from my phone order to picking up, AND I got a front row spot at the mall for once.  The anticipation was killer on the drive home, I contemplated taking the cheesecake out for a bite while stopped at a light. I refrained because I didn't feel like teasing myself. I get home, take a bite of cheesecake before I open my salad - AMAZING, everything I've been hoping and dreaming about. Then I decide to tear into the salad. I LOVE the dressing so I drizzled every last drop on that shizz. I start munching, eating mostly spring mix with plenty of dressing, saving the best for last. I get to the bottom layer of greens, and an so upset to see the lack of components that make the salad so yummy. I literally recall 4 pieces of asparagus, and very little goat cheese. This is an $11 salad, so I definitely felt ripped off. Had I dined in I would've sent it back to be remade, but I was 18 miles away, and stuck with it. Damn you, salad maker, damn you. Your salad making skills are weak af."
Mike A.,"Copperas Cove, TX",6,50,22,4.0,9/26/2017,"I have been here twice, I love the service and the food is great! We took a party of 8 there the 1st time waited a little but not to long. Food comes out fresh and hot, the cheese cake is some of the best I have had any where!  The 2nd time we went 9 people in our party we waited over an hour and still did not get a table, they where busy but they seated a few tables of 4 witch if they had have waited would have given us the 2 tables we needed!  We did get out cheese cake to go and it was just as good at home!!!"
Brian S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,251,80,3.0,12/8/2017,"It is a cheesecake factory so you know what you are getting.   Our waitress waa not too sharp but competent enough.   The portions are always huge, the food is always good but not great, the menu is enormous and there is something for all tastes.   I am not a CF fanboy and only go when others want.  It is ok but nothing special..."
Jennifer N.,"Austin, TX",85,417,2629,2.0,3/17/2017,"I love me some Cheesecake Factory, but this one must be missing the mark for being attached to the mall.  So parking would be terrible if you are trying to come here just for dinner, since they are located next to the movie theater in the mall. I only come here when I'm already in the mall but there are other better options so in reality I only come here when other people in the group want to go here. The North Austin location is hands down much better. The service here is hit or miss, I guess they don't really care as much I'm not quite sure, and the food always has a problem. Maybe their oven is too hot? But everything is always burnt. The bread is hard as a rock and burnt, the biscuits on the chicken and biscuits were like hockey pucks. The price isn't cheap so for the price you are paying and the giant portions of sub par food, I'd say your better off eating in the food court.  But the cheesecakes are probably still a solid decision, since none of it is actually made on site, but I can't say for sure this location hasn't some how messed it up, since by the time it's dessert I'm over the entire experience."
Kwynn U.,"Austin, TX",180,4,,5.0,12/18/2017,"Me favorite plat. Is best food and drink. Wish I work there. I work in Lupe Tortilla I am Busser table., love food and people there"
Gina H.,"Austin, TX",428,242,1483,5.0,6/16/2017,I am thrilled to eat at this location everything was great except the Beef medallions  was a little  tough overall good. Parking easy especially lunch crowd. Janne is our server attentive  and polite  clam chowder is to die for... Salmon was very good as well. I will try more of the menu upon my return. The kale salad served with the crusted salmon was tasty and loved the way it was cooked. This location is at the Barton Creek mall which is off mopac and loop 1. I ordered the lemonade is not tart but perfect the way lemonade should taste. I would let everyone know they do get busy since they are right next door to a movie theater so just to tell you serving can be a bit of a wait. SEE all of for my next review.
Wayne N.,"Austin, TX",61,587,133,3.0,7/10/2017,"Surprisingly, despite living for 27 years now, this is my first trip to any Cheesecake Factory. That's pretty shocking considered how popular it is to many people. A friend gave me a gift card here for helping him out, so figured now is as good as ever to try it out. Although I wasn't ecstatic about my visit, I will say I can cross an item off my to do list of food things every person growing up should try. That said, as much as I appreciate the calorie info on the menu, it's kinda disgusting how unhealthy everything is, especially since the portion size is pretty normal sized...that said it'll help you make some better health decisions cause the taste that you get is marginal difference. The bread is pretty good. Normally I reach for the white bread and though the sourdough baguette is alright, the brown bread with the oats is pretty good. A little pat of butter makes it great. And as for what we ate? I got the chicken madeira and steak diane combo - the wife got the herbed salmon and shrimp scampi. The chicken madeira as their signature dish I would have expected more from. A razor thin chicken cutlet with cheese and chicken wasn't that impressive. The mashed potatoes are buttery and chunky with the red skins, so I appreciate the all natural feel of it. The steak diane is good - sirloin tips with a bit of heat and creamy sauce. Salmon is perfectly cooked and flaky with some herbaceous notes. The shrimp scampi was the favorite of them all - though it tastes more like roasted shrimp than any shrimp scampi I've ever had. Weird it didn't come with noodles on the combo plate either. So the food is pretty good, cheesecake slices are huge, but just can't help but think given what else is in Austin (and even within similar genres), there's better to be had. Sorry to be a local snob over the chain, but hard to argue with the truth...."
Antonio P.,"Austin, TX",7,39,17,4.0,10/5/2017,"So many choices and decadent desserts.  I had the bow tie pasta with sun dried tomatoes.  Large portions but  just mediocre.  I recommend the Vanilla Bean cheese cake, heaven."
Drishti W.,"Cypress, TX",442,26,20,4.0,2/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a family favorite!  Service: 4  Food: 5 Ambience: 5  The only reason I'm docking a point off service is because of how busy they are. The servers always seem to have more tables than they can handle but are sweet regardless.  With their huge portion sizes, the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. This is not the place to go if you're on a diet haha even though they do have a Skinnylicious Menu for those looking for a lighter fare. Everything on their Skinny Menu doesn't taste quite as rich as their regular menu but that makes sense considering it lacks butter and such.  Another reason I enjoy Cheesecake Factory is the wheat and sourdough bread that comes for FREE with your meal! The bread is warm and I always land up eating more of it than I should.  My go to's at Cheesecake are their Picatta Chicken and their Godiva Cheesecake. Both these items deliver in quality and are ALWAYS fantastic regardless of which Cheesecake Factory I go to.  Props to this family favorite for keeping up with their consistency all these years.! We will always be coming back!"
Robin W.,"Spicewood, TX",71,344,184,5.0,3/3/2017,"Today we ate here for a late lunch.   I had the skinnylicious shrimp tacos, which was very tasty. My hubby had the reuben sandwich and it was very flavorful, not soggy and more than enough to bring some home. My mother in law had a  chicken caesar salad and it was huge.  We started the meal with mandatory avocado egg rolls and finished the meal with the original cheesecake topped with strawberries.  We enjoyed our meal immensely and our server was awesome. Our drinks stayed full and he was very patient as we thumbed through the novel of a menu.   We will definitely be returning to this location."
Deanna B.,"Austin, TX",1,35,20,5.0,9/25/2017,"Update 5 stars: Tyler changed my mind completely about my negative thoughts. He was a fantastic server and had an amazing attitude! Thank you Tyler! Old 3 stars: Usually I really enjoy this specific Cheesecake Factory but recently it seems they are just throwing who can wear a uniform into being a server. My last three experiences have been less than adequate. The last one though completely blew me away with her rude tone and inability to understand our order.  She seemed polite at first but as time went by she had a frustrated tone. We ordered something they ran out of and I was a little upset but accepted it. Her response ""oh yeah sorr----y"" was what made me question her. After this she messed up our order and then at the end didn't offer us second drinks, immediately wanted to give us a box and made me box my food (I don't care if I had to do it I just know they do that there and I always liked that). Overall Amanda was a rude unhelpful server."
Russell S.,"Houston, TX",331,3,1,2.0,7/20/2017,"Wanted to get a warning to Vegans or people with food allergies. This location has no problem serving foods without following your requests. Our visit began with a 40 minute wait for edamame. The server came by and offered us free cups of soup for inconvenience and blamed the slow service on the computer system going down.  When we finally received our order, they served our veggie burger which we ordered dry with mustard on the side, fully loaded with mayonnaise. No mustard to be found. We waited 20 minutes with no sign of our server. So battling between ethics of eating the eggs in mayo or going without lunch, decided to scrape off the mayo best we could and eat the burger with ketchup.  We told the server and she asked what our problem was with her. We told the manager and he seemed to not care. Now I am wondering if our pasta was dipped in butter instead of the olive oil as we asked. Lucky this wasn't a food allergy or we would be off to the hospital. Just be careful when you eat here.  They really don't care."
Somya D.,"Austin, TX",19,10,14,4.0,5/2/2017,"Second visit to The Cheesecake Factory. Good number of vegetarian options. Ordered Cucumber lemonade, Fresh basil tomato cheese flatbread, Four cheese pasta and Godiva  chocolate brownie sundae. Everything was delicious! Lemonade was more on the sweet side, pasta was a delicious surprise and I am crazy about their calorie loaded sundae :-D Went on a weekday for lunch, so no rush, sat outside, loved it !"
Lisa H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,5,3,5.0,9/16/2017,"Well I came in dressed in my gym clothes because I planned to work out afterwards. I was greeted kindly and with a smile by the hostess. I wanted a particular booth that was somewhat quiet. The host gave the staff person the directive to find such a booth for me, I followed.  She took me outside of the inside dining area, and pointed to, not a booth, but a table closest to all the chaotic crowds that was trafficking the mall. I asked to be placed in a booth that was quiet and away from lots of people she was taken aback a little so she stared at me not understanding. She asked me to repeat, I did so. I went back inside she followed me. She said, ""All of the two-party booths booths are taken,"" implying that I have no choice but to take what she's chosen for me.  That would never do for me, I would've driven away and gone elsewhere. But instead I looked around and found an empty booth in the corner close to the bar, no one was in it apparently it was a ""four party booth."" I could see the struggle in her face... Number one, I was not ""four people,"" and number two, I was dressed in my gym clothes. I understand.  But I was not going to be any longer than an hour. So I let her know that that's the booth I prefer. She said, ""let me go see if my supervisor approves."" Or something to that effect. She began to walk towards the host and I followed...really in case there's a short conversation against my sitting there. She realized I was behind her and so she pointed to the booth without a word so that the host could see which table it was. The host said ""OK."" So she led me to the table, I said ""thank you"" genuinely, but she just walked away. I felt a little chill; and it wasn't the air-conditioning. I hope she wasn't upset but if she was, perhaps there's more customer service learning to do on her part.  My experience became a more positive one when I met my waiter, Castro. He was upbeat and kind. He was funny, light, and very creative in this banter with me. I hadn't been to this restaurant in a long while in fact I used to go to the one up north in the Arboretum often years ago. This is the first time actually sat down in this particular location. I usually get either the salmon dinner or the salad and pizza. The salad was well-dressed, there was not a leaf of lettuce that did not have Caesar dressing on it, the right   was crisp to the last bite, and I don't croutons but they were really big and enticing. They were toasted in such a way you could get a crunch and  wouldn't break your teeth. I tried one.  Since I was getting the lunch special which was a salad and a small pizza I didn't want to load too many carbs up. By the time I had my slice of pizza I was already full.  So now I have pizza for dinner since I got the rest of it to go.  There was no attitude toward me about my reading and writing during my meal.  I could take my time I think. I spent about 45 minutes to an hour at my booth. Castro remained kind in a non-strained sort of way, it was genuine. I left the restaurant with a light heart grateful to have a little privacy within the public crowded mall.  The restaurant space inside manages to have their own ambience apart from the mall chaos. I recommend it. It is a good place to unwind and have a nice meal after a days worth of shopping."
Amy T.,"Round Rock, TX",259,747,539,3.0,12/12/2016,"I'd rate 3.5 stars. But was still treated with more respect than I was at Bob's Steak and Chophouse, go figure. Came here Friday night after going to amc.  DRINKS: a glass of merlot and a yummy glass of sangria APPETIZER: tuna tartare - next time I'll order 2 of these as my meal. Wish they made that into a plate. Best thing on the menu ENTREE: Chicken Romana - basically chicken parm with angel hair pasta Chicken Bellagio. yummy lightly breaded chicken cutlets on top of parm sauced noodles (pesto notes) and topped with prosciutto topped and arugula Was stuffed and asked for boxes, they box it for you. Was kinda happy they didn't push dessert. offered yes but not pushed as much as drinks which i'm sure is a bigger profit margin.  No cheesecake this time... but for that you cant order food AND order cheesecake its a calorie suicide!"
Valerie A.,"Houston, TX",25,54,21,4.0,7/10/2017,"Came in yesterday to have lunch with some family.  For a Saturday at lunchtime, the restaurant was not extremely busy, which was great. We had a a party of 5, and our wait time was only 15 minutes.  Service was great, the hostess and the waitress were really nice and accommodating. The waitress was really sweet and on top of it! I can appreciate that.  The food was delicious.  Appetizers: -Fried Mac & Cheese Balls: crunchy on the outside, perfectly mac and cheesy on the inside WOW  -avocado egg rolls: pretty good!  Entrees:  Bistro shrimp pasta (we all got this)  Pretty good- although a bit greasy  Cheesecake:  Tiramisu cheesecake- mmmm I love anything tiramisu so this may be biased but it was so amazingly delicious. Overall, great experience!"
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",30,26,61,3.0,4/16/2017,"They've got some local flavors. Otherwise it's about as Cheesecake Factory as it can get. Their menu is basically a book, plus extra menus on skinny dishes and specialties. One thing I like about Cheesecake Factory in general is that they've got something for everyone, and therefore a good place to take someone you don't really know. The deco is always nice, and the cheesecake is good."
Amanda R.,"Austin, TX",99,18,4,2.0,6/6/2017,We love Cheesecake Factory so when we were at the mall today we decided to stop in The hostess did not greet us. We actually had to greet her before she would say hi.  We were sat and we're not greeted by our server for almost 5 min. We were actually talking about getting up and just leaving and she finally showed up.  The food took a long time. It was after lunch time and I'm not sure why it took so long.  The food was so disappointing. Flavorless grilled chicken. Fries that were warm but tasted old.  We got the jambalaya with extra sausage and chicken and we could hardly find one piece of sausage in it.  We will not be back to this location for the bad service and less than mediocre food. We live close to the arboretum and that's the only location worth going to.
Bhagyashree B.,"Austin, TX",42,20,14,3.0,4/1/2017,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory at this particular location 3 times and feel compelled to write a review now. The only reason I revisit it is for the fresh bread and ofcourse the delicious cheesecakes. The restaurant should really sit back and re-evaluate their customer service. The first time I visited, our table was switched between 3 different servers. They did not do a good job coordinating with each other resulting in an hour's delay to get our order. They were out of the falafel salad that we ordered so we switched to avacado toast. The toast turned out to be burnt black and had to be sent back. Dulche le leche cheesecake saved the day! On our second visit - everything went ok but the server did seem a little distracted. Mango key lime cheesecake saved the day! We were at the Barton Creek mall today and decided to eat there again. This time our server forgot to bring our appetizer but charged us for it!! We had to tell him about this error, he didn't even realize it until then. Tiramisu cheesecake saved the day! Food it too expensive and not worth the service we get. Plus I don't like the fact that smaller/half portions cannot be ordered. But that's something you can't change about the franchise. I have been to the Cheesecake factory at other locations and been treated very nicely as compared to this one."
Tom M.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,2.0,12/9/2017,"Burger was blah, service meh, at least the cheesecake was ok. First time will be my last"
David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,156,4.0,11/25/2016,Average for a Cheesecake Factory which is still a good thing. Service did include the excess of the drink I ordered which was nice. Note that prices are higher than other locations around the country but portions are WAY bigger.
Amanda H.,"Wilmette, IL",0,5,,2.0,2/27/2017,"My children and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory last weekend. Our server was initially very attentive, until our food arrived. Unfortunately, there were several hairs in the flatbread that I ordered. When our server finally came over to check on us, I made him aware of what was on my plate. He acknowledged this and offered to remove the dish, but issued no apology. He never returned to the table to check in on us again, refill our drinks, or offer an apology. When he finally returned he brought the check and said that the wait was long because he needed to notify his manager to remove the charge for my food.  I am really disappointed in the lack of customer service and service recovery. No one from management came over to offer a personal apology or to figure out a way to make it right. We're frequent customers since we live so close, but sadly, Cheesecake Factory, you've lost my business after this incident."
LaRae L.,"Clarksville, TN",41,7,,1.0,8/18/2017,"I would like to personally congratulate this Cheesecake Factory for ruining what was supposed to be one of the most special nights of my life. My now fiancée attempted to propose to me here last weekend. The floor was so disgusting she couldn't even get down on one knee to pop the question in fear of ruining her pants. And let's not mention how inconsiderate and rude our waitress was. Maybe she wasn't too fond of seeing a lesbian couple, I don't know. It was no excuse for her lackluster service. She seemed as if she just wanted us gone. I am extremely disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. I love going here, but I had much better service at the one in Houston. I will not be returning to this location and will continue to discourage anyone else from doing so as well."
Luis E.,"Harlingen, TX",0,3,3,2.0,3/18/2017,"Very disappointed. This was the worse experience ever. I was served meatballs that were dry and burned! I had to spit one out. The manager brought me better looking meatballs after I complained. Too bad I had already lost my appetite. The waiter asked if their was something else he can do. My husband told him if he can throw in a free slice of cheesecake. The waiter responded ""sorry I can't do that"". Talk about awful customer service. Cheesecake Factory just lost another customer."
Victoria M.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I am still so disappointed. After a beautiful day shopping with my husband and 11 month old, we wanted to treat ourself to a lovely lunch! Without hesitation we both said ""the Cheesecake Factory."" We walked in and waited about 5 mins to get seated and once sat is when things turned horrible. It took our server over 10 mins to greet us, and then we had to wait for bread and our sweet teas. No worries, we were patient. Then after finally deciding to order, since they obviously thought we had all the time in the world, we waited over 45 mins to get our food. Again, no worries, I use to work in restaurants I understand but our food came out COLD! The lady, who wasn't our sever, said ""the plates are hot be careful,"" NOT HOT at all!! Now, keep in mind we had my son, 11months, who goes out all the time but me and my husband are pretty fast eaters and don't lounge around when we go out to eat! We had to get up to get our sever because she was no where to be found and told her we just wanted to go! She sent over the manager, and he was a joke! ""We can warm it up for you."" No!  I don't want a $45 tab ""warmed up"" we were so upset, we walked out!!!!!!!!!! I have never been so dissatisfied before. I do not suggest coming to this location. We will NOT go back."
Omar R.,"San Marcos, TX",1,14,16,4.0,12/8/2016,"Walking into the Cheesecake Factory it reminds me of a cruise liner's restaurant. I don't know why. Maybe because the layout has a lot of curvature. Glancing around, the restaurant looks really taking care of. Very whimsical in a professional manner.  Michael, my waiter, was quick to serve my table. (I timed it btw) as he quickly brought my drink and a side of bread with butter. He was knowable about what's on the menu, very helpful for any first timer. Also adding I never had an empty cup. So far so good...now I wait for my order. (FOOD) I ordered something simple, the Americana Cheeseburger with the side green salad, a sweet tea and an order of the original cheesecake. ( Of course I'm going to get a cheesecake, it's the freaking Cheesecake Factory).  Out came the order and it looks fantastic.  Americana Cheeseburger was great. The potato crisps as the garnish was a well addition to the burger, it had a nice little crunch to the burger. The top bun was lightly toast with their secret sauce spread (not bad) it had a light sweet taste to it, but went well with the burger as a whole. The grilled onions might have been a little over cooked. (Personally I was never a fan of onions, so...). Ordering this burger you will not be disappointed, its a simple classic.  The green salad is what you think it is, romaine with light ranch dressing and a tomato wedge. It was good. It was a salad.  The cheesecake was excellent. I'd be disappointed otherwise, because obviously reasons, right... The experience was great. Will I come back again, yes I would. Recommend? Yes.  Don't let bad reviews or even good reviews make your decision. I just told you my own experience. Try it out for yourself and you be the judge. Good luck. And thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,101,157,4.0,7/8/2016,I like to come here and eat. Normally I'm by myself. Service is always good and food too. Never had to wait for a booth but I do come after the rush for a reason.  Sitting at the bar is a good option too.  Got the Pasta di Vinci today it really hit the spot.
Ekatarina V.,"Austin, TX",186,142,114,4.0,5/26/2016,"When the weather outside is as blustery as the 100 Acre Woods, this place is pleasantly empty. Enough people to create background noise and ambience without the din. And even better, without the howling kids.  I enjoy my HH and this is my first weeknight here. I'm hoping it's not just the weather making it so pleasant!"
Errol M.,"Austin, TX",893,1005,2399,5.0,8/25/2015,"""OMG! THE NEW CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS HERE! THE NEW CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS HERE!  I'M AT THIS MALL EVERYDAY AND CAN EAT HERE WHENEVER I WANT. I LIKE NORDIE'S BISTRO AND SARKU TOO!"" ************************ (Editor's note: Errol M actually lives in a very small world. The new Cheesecake Factory at Barton Creek Mall is a superb example of maximized seating in a minimal space, along with its ""inside patio"" & outside tables. It has the same extended CF hours & extended menu, along with the best-trained staff in the business. They've introduced valet service to this old-school Simon mall, and it's simply hard to dislike their cheesecake. If you like The Cheesecake Factory, you'll like this one too.)"
Sara H.,"Austin, TX",3,5,2,2.0,7/2/2017,I ordered takeout- not worth the money at all. Their Caesar dressing tastes nothing like caesar. It was basically ranch so I threw it away. The southwest chicken sandwich I ordered was soggy and falling apart by the time I got it home. Would have been more satisfied with McDonald's. Disappointed because Drake gave this place a solid endorsement :/
Hana S.,"San Francisco, CA",342,503,146,1.0,4/24/2016,"Came here today around 3 pm, we walked in and got seated immediately and then proceeded to wait 15 minutes to be served. :| Kind of ridiculous to not even have our drink order be taken for that long. We also didn't receive bread during our wait for the meal to be served. I come to Cheesecake Factory because they're known for their speedy service and delivery of food, so this was disappointing. Our server Michael was apologetic as the waiter who normally served our table was MIA or something. He really did an amazing job and was running around the entire time, making sure we got everything as fast as possible.  Regardless it's shitty that he had to pick up so much of the slack when there were numerous waiters standing around the restaurant since it was not a standard meal time. Really reflects on the management staff and their lack of leadership and control."
Chris C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",15,292,622,5.0,5/14/2017,"In Austin for graduation of our son.  Took him to lunch before we headed back.  Awesome food and deserts, good service.  Manager checked on us towards the end of our meal .  I like that.  All our meals were very good.  Huge portion sizes.  I will be back!"
Kimberly F.,"Round Rock, TX",71,5,,1.0,5/6/2017,"Well. We came here and ordered the fried cheese to start with. We waited quite a while and then they brought our meals out. At this point, I asked where our appetizer was and the waitress asked if we ""still wanted it"" and when we said yes, said she would go to check on it for us. After all of this. We got our fried cheese halfway through our meal. No one comped them and the manager didn't even come to apologize. Needless to say, I'm furious and will never be coming back."
Mallori B.,"Cameron, TX",28,60,19,4.0,5/14/2017,"Service was average and of course great food! I had no issues on this visit, my only critique is that my poor waitress needed help, I think they must've double sat her because she seemed frantic and forgot about some of my things. But she was kind and friendly. Just preoccupied."
Marcy C.,"Austin, TX",3,56,235,3.0,10/12/2015,"Mediocre=not bad but not great. Went for brunch. The drink menu didn't have prices. When I pointed it our to the waitress she said we can tell you the prices. Ok how much is your mimosa? Waitress:""I think"" it's $8. Um hello you don't know what ""the"" brunch drink costs?! My son got the monte cristo and it was loaded with eggs and it wasn't fried like a MC. Eww not a good MC.  My husband got the meatloaf and it looked ok. My daughter had the pasta and it was kinda dry. I got the impression that they were trying to cut costs by giving cheap ingredients. I got the crab hash. The potatoes were very salty and oily (see pic). I don't know about the crab. All I know is I felt sick afterwards:("
Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",416,244,327,4.0,11/18/2016,"Been here a couple times and the service is always mediocre at best. Every time they never have the bread out in time for the table and today we got the bread AFTER we got our entree! The servers don't come by as often as they should. Other than that, the place is kept up and nice. Today I got the spicy chicken pasta and it was pretty good. It was a lot so I had to get a to-go box. Every time I come I get the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It's the best thing they have on the menu and it's the best cheesecake I've ever had. The mango topping is amazing, really sweet! The cheesecake itself is very good and the perfect texture. The coconut crust is also amazing as well. The food is usually a 5/5, but the service is a 3/5. I'll come back because of the cheesecake, but the service definitely needs to get better or I'll start taking cheesecake to go instead of dining in."
Patricia R.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,1,5.0,6/18/2017,Love love this place. The food is always excellent and the waitresses and waiters are superb!! Thanks Stephanie for recommending the lemon ricotta pancakes! See you next week!
Paige A.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,3.0,10/24/2016,"Our waitress, Whitney, was very helpful and made sure all of our questions were answered. She made great recommendations and made sure we were accommodated.  The food was great, per usual!  But, unfortunately, the reason we are giving a three star review was because of the behind the scenes staff... We understand that the bartenders can be busy with the whole restaurant but it took about 15-20 minutes to get a double whisky with water. We came on a late Monday night with a pretty empty dining room.  Second, as we were leaving we decided to get some last minute cheesecake. Being super excited, it took a minute for the THREE people behind the counter to even acknowledge us. We were acknowledged by the guy (unfortunately we were unable to get his name) with him saying, ""they'll be right with you""... He then walked away to make small talk with the hostess. He could has easily helped us. Meanwhile the other two girls behind the counter never acknowledged us.  Anyway, we left without cheesecake and a very uneasy feeling."

I would always look forward to eating here... now I could really care less for this establishment. I expected just OK food, but what I was served was super salty, werid cuts of meat and below average dishes.  Came here out of convenience since we were shopping in the mall. Spacious location & all indoors. We wanted something lighter since most dishes here are quite heavy so we ordered the Ahi Tartare, Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Thai lettuce wraps.  The Ahi Tartare... a nightmare. The raw tuna was not even diced/sliced properly.. The pieces were like half cut, but still stuck on to each other like links of fish? Will I get sick from eating this?? And the seasoning was also heavy, heavy on the soy! The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was not any better either. The server told us it would be mild spicy. However, it was a lot spicier than predicted and the dish was SO SALTY, I needed to drink so much water! The Thai lettuce wraps was OK, but the butter lettuce used was not fresh.  To receive this quality of food, I would rather just eat at the food court and it would be cheaper there too!  PS. Sorry no pics, phone died, but really... Cheesecake factory is pretty self explanatory."
