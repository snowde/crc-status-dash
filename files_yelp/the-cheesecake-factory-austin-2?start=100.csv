net W.,"Santa Clara, CA",40,7,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Zero stars. Our take out order was a disaster. I asked to hold the cheese on one of the items. What I got (noticed once home, 25 minutes away) was dry meat (they just held the wine sauce) and melted cheese on parts of my order, clearly scraped off by someone. In short: they cooked it with cheese, realized their mistake, scraped it off (likely holding it in their hand) not getting it off successfully from the entire dish, put it back, forgot the sauce, and voilà: my dish. You mess it up? Redo it! I had to throw it away because the image of someone in your kitchen scraping off the cheese of the meal was gross. No sauce on that dish was just a dry piece of chicken, and the potatoes looked like they've been recycled from another plate.  What a disaster! If I lived closer, I would have brought it back and demanded a refund. Beyond unacceptable!!"
Manuel E.,"Kyle, TX",29,52,18,3.0,3/30/2016,My first time at the new location.  It's very nice and plush. I had a very small Greek salad that was delicious for $7. For my entrée I had the Pit Beef Dip. If you don't like raw oysters on the halfshell this sandwich will gross you out. It was tasty but you couldn't tell if the juice was from the Au ju or from the beef fat in the sandwich. Not what I expected from a $14 sandwich. Lastly I had a $5 strawberry lemonade to drink. It was so concentrated you could use it on pancakes. This visit was not a good first impression.  One person for lunch $28. You decide?
William G.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Worst experience of my life.  We visited this location on Saturday night with the hope of a wonderful evening.  We arrived and had a ten minute wait for a table, which is a wonderful! We were super excited! We were seated out on the patio in the mall and our waitress stopped by and said she would be right back to take our drink order.  20 mins passed and we never saw her, finally 5 mins later she stopped by and asked us what we would like to drink. We told her our drink order and 10 minutes later she stops and tells us she forgot about us!!! What how do you forget to help us!?!?! The food was ok, but customer service was awful."
Lexi S.,"Austin, TX",0,12,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Food was great,  Service was a let down. My sister and I went there for lunch and we ordered a turkey burger, salad, and tuna.  After 30 minutes of waiting for our food a guy came over and said ""He is really sorry,  his kitchen staff just let him know that the Turkey burgers were frozen and asked what else we wanted"".  After quickly deciding to go with the veggies burger it took the waitress about 5 minutes to come back over to put in order.  Another 20 minutes went by and we finally got our meal.  We were there for two hours and they didn't even offer us any type of discount."
Matt H.,"Southeast Austin, Austin, TX",1,7,,1.0,12/15/2015,"Terrible! We ordered are meals only to be told 5 mins later they were out of the entrees we selected. So one of our parties had to select a second item, we thought all was good. Another few minutes later the waitress returns to tell us the 2nd item picked was out also! The ""floor manager"" comes to the table and shows a list, a long list of items the kitchen was out of for the night.  Subsequently our food took Forever to get!  40 mins for a very simple 6 top of burgers and pasta. Quality was ok at best and for the prices we paid I would call it A complete rip off. Example the kids cheese burger with fruit was $8 and the side of fruit was old and sour. The burger I placed was not cooked correctly as requested. I also asked for a simple side of steamed broccoli vs. fries was not ever delivered to the table.  No attempt was ever made to correct these issues to make it right for the table.  Although we were repeatedly asked if we wanted more drinks from the bar or cheesecake after we asked for the check.  Not impressed at all. Don't waste your time or money!"
Moe I.,"Austin, TX",81,19,1,5.0,11/2/2015,"It's my first time at this location, I had my birthday dinner and we were 20 people, manager Kim was great and helpful along with the two waitress that served our table. It was a good experience and I'm coming back for sure."
Bobby S.,"Austin, TX",5,136,29,2.0,9/18/2015,"This place tried to make up for a lack of quality with quantity. Not only was the food sub par, we waited an hour for our food after placing our order. Our waitress was very sweet but impossible to get attention from."
Noelita L.,"Austin, TX",18,18,16,3.0,11/24/2015,"The sourdough bread was horrible. The strawberry shortcake was subpar (strawberries were at least fresh looking). The fire-roasted artichoke was basically dried, old artichoke halves that were burnt -no flavor and no ""artichoke meat"" to enjoy. The only saving grace was the Classic Burger -juicy! But they ran out of lettuce and onions so my burger didn't come with ""fixins"". The pumpkin cheesecake was good too. I will not be visiting this location again."
Mandy L.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,7/22/2016,"Service was wonderful, food was great :) my favorite thing on the menu is the chicken bellagio. Me and my family went to have dinner and the wait was not long and the service was fast!"
Richard F.,"Oak Park, MI",2,6,3,1.0,9/5/2015,"Notwithstanding the quality of the cheesecake factory products are good however I just waited 45 minutes to get a salad from takeaway, their takeaway service is unacceptable"
Cindy B.,"Austin, TX",0,36,,2.0,1/14/2017,"I usually wait until I've been somewhere twice before I write a review, but I don't think I'll go here again. Walked over with 12 people after a movie on Friday night at about 10pm. We were told that it would be 45 minutes until we could get a table, That seemed excessive, but I know it's hard to get 12 together. Hostess did not think to offer us the option of two tables, or suggest seating in the bar. We noticed that the bar had a number of open tables, and she told us that we could be served dessert there (all we wanted). Although the bar was not especially crowded, the service was ridiculously slow. It was probably 20 - 25 minutes before our orders were taken and at least that long again to receive our desserts. Remember, the desserts are already prepared and cut, they just have to be plated. The desserts were good and priced fine for their generous portions (about $8 each), but the service will keep me from trying Cheesecake Factory again. The manager should have been out working tables, and the staff seems like they hadn't been well trained: either the hostess or the waiter."
Jennifer W.,"Anchorage, AK",0,2,,1.0,8/7/2016,"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory and look forward to enjoying a dinner here whenever I travel but after this visit this chain will be lucky to get anymore money out of me!!!  I understand construction and being rushed because of it. I understand getting our cheesecake ordered before our appetizer has even been served because the electricity is going to be shut off. What I don't understand is taking our main entree order then telling us they ran out of potatoes when the chicken and veggie is ready to serve ""can we bring you pasta or rice""?!  After we choose she leaves the table saying ""well put that on right now"". Really?!  It is now 30 minutes past the time they said the electricity would be shit off. Very disappointed!!  All this from the ""manager""!!  Very bad management to allow NO COMMUNICATION that greatly affects customers!!!"
Jenny C.,"Austin, TX",27,44,2,2.0,11/7/2015,"We've been here twice. First time it was fine. The second time the service was poor. I don't expect much from a huge chain restaurant in terms of menu so that's the not the reason for the two star review.  We were quoted a 40 minute wait. It ran over 50. Okay, I get it, sometimes a wait goes longer. But after waiting 50 minutes THEY SAT US IN THE BAR. Other people walked in way after us and walked up to bar tables and waited for them to be cleared and  then took a seat PRIOR to us being seated. If I am going to wait for close to an hour, don't seat me in a bar area where then have to wait even longer for a server trying to manage far more tables than he is able. We sat at our table for close to 10 minutes before the server even got to us. Then we ordered our food. Which ended up coming out via a food runner prior to our getting out drinks. I guess this is what we get for not eating 'local'"
S W.,"Austin, TX",22,10,2,3.0,10/8/2015,"Great service and loved the patio that extends into the mall. The lettuce wraps were good, there wasn't quite enough lettuce and I wasn't fond of the noodles that tasted like styrofoam, but the mushroom chicken filling was great. The mushroom burger ended up a little more rare than had been expected, mushrooms tasted burnt and it was extremely greasy. The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about, but better than the burger."
Judd S.,"San Antonio, TX",6,7,1,4.0,3/25/2016,"Brought my family here and the large variety of foods made it perfect for my family! The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever had, amazing! Kids dishes were good too. Older kids got the Salmon and it was very flavorful. We will be back!"
Brian K.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,"2016. 11. 05 Saturday Around 8:30.         Food is great and awesome as always. I would definitely give 5stars to my server Emily who were really kind and professional. I feel even so sorry for Emily that i am giving 1star just because of a rude hostess Jamila (i am not even sure if i spelled it right) who can never say sorry to customers that were pretty irritated by her attitude. it was my party's turn to be seated after 20 minutes waiting. We approached to the hostess and she told my girl friend to step aside so she can talk to a lady behind of us. If was our turn and the ones who were behind were seated first. We also got seated right after but i was quite upset about the behavior and headed back to the hostess station. All she said was that ""oh we dont do it that way. I told you to step aside so you could be seated."" Now what. I explained how we were irritated and she would never say sorry. I did not want to argue and told her that it was all our fault to get upset because you did not do anything wrong. Guess what she said. ""Oh yes we dont do it that way."" And i got sick of talking to someone who does not understand human language. Good day good weather good food and good server, but Jamila the hostess totally ruined our weekend dinner."
Mary U.,"Austin, TX",7,41,,5.0,3/14/2016,Ate here not long ago with a hefty friend. The chairs are strange tend to make you feel like you're leaning back but not comfortable for a fat butt. Which you would think at a place called Cheescake Factory the furniture would lean toward the heavy side but it was more like outdoor furniture. Okay enough about furniture. Once you are seated have fun reading the menu which way too many pages of food. We split an order of avacado egg rolls which by the way were delicious. Then we made the mistake of ordering an entree. I had a carbonara plate. Huge portions it was yummy but after three bites I knew it would go home to make another meal. I had to have a slice of tres leche cheesecake. It was heavenly. My companion had lemon meringue cheesecake that was out of this world. All in all we both dropped $30 a piece which is pricey but it fed me twice. Very good overall good service and a desire for more cheesecake in my future. Next time though just appetizer coffee and cheesecake
Nada C.,"78704 (South Austin), Austin, TX",2,4,1,5.0,10/24/2015,Bobby at the bar is awesome! We were over charged and he took time out (even though the bar was packed) to go talk his manager and fix the charges. Definitely will come back to see him!!
Jorge T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,6,,5.0,2/21/2016,"Waiter was vey friendly, amazing food and great experience. Reasonable prices, great location."
Carla Z.,"Kyle, TX",6,95,,5.0,8/31/2015,"Super Cheese Cake Factory has finally opened in Barton Creek Mall.  We went Sunday afternoon for lunch and it was very busy.  We sat at the bar which is really nice and we had a super bartender, Monica, who took very good care of us. The food was wonderful, service great; lots of servers so no one had to wait long for their orders and all the servers really knew the menu and had tasted the dishes so they could answer our questions...  The restaurant is beautiful.  We plan on going back very soon."
