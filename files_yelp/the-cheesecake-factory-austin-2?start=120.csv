Haibo L.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,2.0,12/12/2015,"We waited for over an hour for our food, and one of our dishes were served to the wrong table, which cost us another 10 minutes. I waited for so long that I had two and half load of bread, and by the time our food is here, I was already full. I ordered Shepherd's pie, it was just average, nothing outstanding. I would probably not come back again."
F. R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,2.0,11/13/2015,Tonight's visit to Cheesecake Factory Barton Creek square very disappointing my companions meal was requested a certain way and when it was brought out it was done incorrectly the manager then came to the table and offered little to help the situation but rather take the plate away the check came and we were charged for the meal that was taken away and what has happened to the portion sizes of the cheesecake $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake that used to be able to be shared by two people very disappointing
Jessica W.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,14,,5.0,11/3/2015,The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone. The menu is so extensive that it covers just about all areas. The cheesecake and other desserts are the best ever. The staff is always courteous and the prices are fair. Be prepared because the servings are huge.
S.J. J.,"Round Rock, TX",18,7,5,2.0,9/13/2015,"Me and my husband decided to go to a beautiful restaurant for a lovely dinner date today. As soon as we walked in the door I was very excited and then immediately pissed. A place that looks as gorgeous as this should have top notch employees. We stood in front of the hostess podium for a couple of minutes being completely, and blatantly ignored by 4 hostesses while they enjoyed their conversation. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. My husband finally chimed in and said, ""Two please."" And without even a, ""Hello"", or a ""Sorry"", or even a care in the world one of them bitchily says, ""Your name."" ""We'll be with you in a few minutes."" Then a few minutes pass by and they sit us at a table with 8 plate settings! Wtf? The waiter had a better attitude then the hostesses. Which is the only reason this place gets stars at all. These employees need to take a field trip to Chick-fil-a and learn a little bit about customer service. If I was a manager at this cheesecake restaurant I would be absolutely ashamed. Thank you for destroying my anniversary by treating me like shit!"
A H.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,3.0,9/5/2015,"Fiirst impression is that this place is small. They do have an outdoor patio and an interior patio seating area which helps. Came on Saturday for lunch and waiting was 10 minutes for 2 which is alright. Bar area is small but service was quick. Dont make the mistake of laying your drink on their wood cabinets because there is nowhere else to set your drink like I did. Manager kindly asked me to move to marble countertop area which was near POS system. Not my first choice but ok sir. Anywho rest of experience was service with a smile and prompt servvice. (Thank you Iris) Food is what you came to expect from Cheesecake factory, so thats good. We had the Fried Macaroni and cheese balls, the fried avocado-mushroom-zuchinni spears and a salted carmel cheesecake. Not exactly a healthy lunch with beer, but hey!, its good eating. So in conclusion come here if you can not bring yourself to drive up North to Arboretum. Otherwise, go there."
