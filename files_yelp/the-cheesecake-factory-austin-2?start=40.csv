Danny M.,"Austin, TX",0,7,5,4.0,9/24/2017,"Three words... red velvet cheesecake! Food was good. Good portion size. A little more expensive then places like Applebee's and chilli's. But worth the money. Hostess was kind of rude, probably having a bad day. Waitress was great!! My date drunk like a gallon of water and his glass was never empty."
Eileen C.,"Austin, TX",0,5,2,2.0,8/20/2016,"This location isn't great...unless you are just eating the cheesecake which is about the only consistent thing they serve in comparison to other Cheesecake Factory's. Food options seem to have a wide variance. I've ordered the same thing multiple times, and each time there is something amiss!  The most recent issue I had was their shrimp tacos. For $15 one would think they would serve you clean shrimp. Not so, and they were some dirty shrimp. What a turn off!!! Guest Services responds to my post a month later telling me to tell a team member about my unhappy experience?! How about you clean your shrimp before you plate them!! This was a carry out order, so I was unable to tell my server as they were discovered after I got home. Too far and too much trouble with an infant to drive back to the restaurant to deal with these disgusting shrimp!"
Hailey H.,"Bee Cave, TX",1,12,,2.0,3/22/2017,"Have you ever paid 30 dollars for a steak with the expectation of it being savory, cooked to a medium range so that it basically melts in your mouth and that A1 isn't a necessity. Well I paid 30 dollars for a steak that could double as a hockey puck.... on my birthday. The steak was tough, well done and hard to eat. I had to drown it in A1 to even get it down my throat.  The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because the waiter was a total sweetheart and gave good service."
Sara P.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Completely dissatisfied with my first visit to The Cheesecake Factory. The meal is tasteless and unexciting, the drinks are made with cheap vodka and the service is spotty."
Frank A.,"Georgetown, TX",3,63,74,2.0,1/24/2016,"Bathroom did not have paper towels, no dispenser. You get wash your hands and face then air dry your handswhile water drips off your chin. After you get over the fact that your face is wet you get to open the door inward to exit, hoping the person before you washed their hands.  Service and food was right up there with 4 to 5 stars. Just dislike the cheap bathrooms that have no logic except for cheap and easy to keep clean."
Sara L.,"Austin, TX",36,50,2,1.0,11/14/2015,"If you were served a piece of broken glass in your pasta, what would you expect to happen next? My husband bit into a large, sharp piece of glass. Most mistakes I can overlook at a new restaurant, but this was not a simple mistake. This was dangerous. We alerted out waitress but didn't get so much as an apology. It was basically, ""Oh shucks, let us remake that for you."" The waitress didn't apologize, the manager was having a goodbye-party in the back and we never heard from her. We paid for an entree that had to be remade (for SAFETY reasons) and came out 20 minutes after everyone else's food. Basically, we were served contaminated food and a $100 bill. The Cheesecake Factory, this was not an acceptable response to something so serious. When we have to visit a doctor after eating at your restaurant, the very least you should do is apologize. Beyond, that, I would have expected some sort of process in place to make sure there wasn't more broken glass in your kitchen or other diners' food."
Rachel M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,129,63,1.0,11/29/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is an anomaly. It's the one chain I could count on to be consistent, no matter the location. The food and service here was bad. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box, and the rest of our meals just tasted off. There was some missing ingredient we couldn't put our finger on. This is the first time I've ever dined at Cheesecake and didn't take leftovers"
Christina J.,"Austin, TX",144,22,,4.0,8/14/2016,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory, it's easy to overlook your novel-like menu, your classic American over-sized portions and your calorie laden food (yes, yes, you have that Skinnylicious menu--I suppose we can pretend at least.) And kudos for that new Super Foods section this go around. That made for a fun twist! But let's get serious here. We love the magic. We love the soft butter. And we love that tiny basket with three kinds of bread you keep graciously bringing to our table. The orange and gold glow of restaurant lighting melts perfectly with the moderate murmur of the crowd and the busy clink of knife and fork on plate. Once again we are whisked off to our wonderland of rich delicacies, sauces, and dreamlike portions we will be eating for lunch for days. Bonus points for accommodating a large group of us after church and for being so polite in bringing us separate checks. Lovely server lady with large sparkly earrings, you did your position proud. I have no real complaints for you, Cheesecake Factory...You had me at Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake. That's all you needed to say...Have no fear. I will return as soon as your savory winds tempt me back!"
Anthony T.,"San Marcos, CA",0,5,6,5.0,8/5/2017,"I had the best experience with Stu S. at the bar, great service! Stu went above and beyond to take care of me! This was a great hire Cheesecake Factory, keep up the good work!"
Gabriela G.,"Copperas Cove, TX",25,13,72,1.0,2/20/2017,"Horrible service, we literally only saw our server twice,  to order the food,  and to bring us the food.  My main reason to come here are the desserts,  and that didn't happen cuz the guy was nowhere to be found.  By the way it was 4:00 pm on a Monday,  the place was empty."
Suzanne M.,"University of Texas, Austin, TX",0,1,,2.0,5/31/2017,"When this restaurant first opened at Barton Creek Mall, the food was much better. Both the service and the food seem to have deteriorated over the past year or so. Very disappointed today(again)so we won't be going there again."
Roshan D.,"Austin, TX",90,108,78,2.0,7/20/2016,"Not vegan friendly. They have very few items that can be made vegan. The waiters are not aware. So, Google online about vegan customizations. With customizations, their food is not that tasty. Evelyn pasta is dry and not flavorful. The only vegan item on the menu is Cobb salad, which is tasty."
Marshall H.,"Austin, TX",11,19,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Ordered from a delivery company, because I was in a bind and needed to feed kids, etc. Just awful food. Food was way too salty and my 2 year old wouldn't even eat the pizza. Learned my lesson ordering from a big box chain.... never again. Avoid this place."
Steven B.,"Cedar Creek, TX",2,35,,1.0,7/29/2017,"I have been to the location in arboretum and never had any problems.  This was my first visit to this location in barton creek mall.   I ordered nachos and the majority of the chips were over cooked and sad for the price they are charging for nachos.  I asked for more chips hoping that would help and the ""new"" chips weren't any better than the original chips served to me... needless to say I didn't eat that much of my meal.   The daughter ordered a pasta dish with shrimp.  Immediately after getting home she started throwing up and complaining about her stomach bothering her.  She said the shrimp was chewy, guessing under cooked.  Whatever it was, I can't say that I recommend this location to anyone.  In fact I advise to stay away."
Sara J.,"Austin, TX",409,12,1,1.0,6/22/2017,"Horrible.  We have tried to come here four times,  months apart . Always a let down . we ordered and sat here 20 min before the waitress came to tell us they were out of pineapple chicken and shrimp,  (no big deal)  we ordered a turkey club and the gm came about ten min later to tell us they are out of Turkey.  What a joke . Last our experiences here with the food are always disapointing . This will be the LAST time we ever come to deal with this disaster ."
L A.,"Buda, TX",0,5,,2.0,2/26/2017,"Went on 2/2517 for dinner, ordered the Cobb salad and when I lifted my plate I realized the under side of the plate was greasy and had food particles on it, I told the server and she took it back and gave me a salad on a clean plate. The salad wasn't fresh, it was a little brown and wilted, I didn't send it back, dessert of course was great, I will not go back."
Beth G.,"78704 (South Austin), Austin, TX",1,6,1,2.0,7/29/2016,"My partner and I like to eat here whenever we shop at Barton Creek Mall. We usually get the beet salad and the shrimp pasta from the skinny menu because they are two of the few dishes we enjoy here at Cheesecake Factory. However, we had a disappointing experience at the restaurant tonight. We had to wait ten minutes before we could order our drinks once we were seated. Secondly, we had to send our beet salad back to the kitchen twice because it was soaked in the dressing. Lastly, we were charged for the beet salad which we sent back twice. We were not satisfied with the service at the beginning nor with our salad and we had to pay the full price for it? I don't think we'll be returning to this restaurant again."
Jim H.,"Claremont, CA",0,38,2,5.0,11/15/2016,Lettuce wrap Asian chicken tacos are my favorite....healthy and tasty. Fast friendly service in wonderful atmosphere.
Ethel B.,"Austin, TX",1,19,3,5.0,2/16/2017,"I haven't been here to sit and eat.  However, I've been here several times for takeout and the service was exceptional every time including one were I was about to pass out.  They couldn't have been nicer getting me tea with refills while I waited.  This food is so good and you get so much!  My favorite is the grilled chicken and avacado club sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Yum!  Of course the Black Out Cake and cheesecake are simply the best!"
Jae R.,"Austin, TX",0,27,,3.0,5/28/2017,"Good food (love the skinnylicious menu) and dessert worth waiting for... for a higher priced restaurant the place needs to be kept cleaner, especially those restrooms, I hate for my family to see this-turns us off completely and makes for a bad overall visit"
