Ferris T.,"Georgetown, TX",0,165,,1.0,1/3/2017,"While the food is good, the ambiance is horrible. Specifically the noise level. Dishes crashing, loud patrons, babies crying make this a horrible place to eat and have a conversation. I don't know what it is with restaurants today that thing the louder the noise level the better the environment.  It was so loud that we asked to be moved to the outside patio on the mall level. Never again will we eat that this place. If you decide, please take your ear plugs. The decibel level must be over 100!"
Lury C.,"West Bronx, NY",0,8,9,5.0,8/20/2016,I can't ever give a bad review to them even when my steak wasn't the way I wanted they went above and beyond to apologize n make everything the way I wanted it 5 stars alllll the way
Danielle W.,"Austin, TX",31,45,9,2.0,5/17/2016,"I am hesitant to write this review.  The server was lovely and thoughtful and my Diet Coke was never empty which is basically a miracle.  But we go out to eat because food is delicious, much more so when you don't have to make it yourself, and that is where I ran into some problems.  I ordered a burger off of their (way too) large menu.  So many choices.  When your menu has ads for other items, you need to trim it down a bit.  The server said it could be cooked to order and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for rare/medium rare. After a moderate wait, the food came and I ate the French fries first because obviously fries lose that special something when they get cold and they are just never the same.  Then I cut into my burger and it is super well done. Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, and then come back to this dimension and check on us. I tell her about the burger and how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread and fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it is full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat and that she took away and just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over and starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée and that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full and it was unnecessary and it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée and fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  Honestly, this has happened at literally every Cheesecake Factory I go to.  My order is always screwed up, no matter what I order. This was my first time getting a burger and it surely will be my last.  Probably even my last time at any location, at least for a good amount of time.  This one is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit? Nobody likes to wait thirty minutes for a check."
Nicole M.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,5.0,1/12/2017,"Our server, Sean, was the perfect mix of charming and giving us space to enjoy our meal. The food was great, too. But I would definitely ask for Sean's section the next time I come here."
Alan H.,"Arlington, TX",78,35,,2.0,9/14/2016,"Any restaurant with this many things on the menu is never great. Always mediocre and this is no exception. Jack of all trades, master of none. Definitely geared for middle America that only has three taste buds, sugar, salt and fat. You just simply can't be good at pizza and Chinese food. Focus man focus."
Veronica R.,"Hutto, TX",2,6,,1.0,1/3/2017,"It took us approximately two hours to be in and out of that place,server put the order wrong and forgot to bring a side as a part of my sister's meal,our nearby tables got up before we received our meal.Please do yourself a favor and go to the location at great hills trail or Grand lux cafe at the domain."
jim s.,"Austin, TX",0,21,,1.0,10/19/2016,"If you like screaming babies and pitiful waitstaff, then this is your place. I ask to be seated in another booth due to the screaming baby in a very polite manner. The RUDE waiter  told me he couldn't do that and to return to the podium. The place was far from full during the middle of the week at 12:30 I repeated my request to no avail and simply left hungry."
Clare S.,"Austin, TX",175,89,10,2.0,2/9/2016,"Ehhh.  S'ok.  I find cheesecake factory food to be generally decent tasting, but minus the 'lighter' menu the tastiness is mostly a result of fat and sugar and less the result of creative use of food.  The place tends to be overly crowded and not really worth the stress. BUT I do still go to grab a slice of cheesecake every now and again."
Michelle S.,"Cedar Park, TX",22,24,2,4.0,8/26/2016,"Our sever was friendly, and attentive. He even took a few extra minutes to listen to my son brag about playing the piano. The food was ok, but not bad. Overall, the experience was good."
Katie L.,"Kyle, TX",27,115,8,4.0,1/4/2016,"We ate here on Saturday night. We were at the mall and saw it was open and figured why not try this location. It's a chain restaurant lets just put that out there. I like to eat, everywhere! Chain or non chain as long as the food is good I'll eat it! We had a 25min wait play around 4:45pm we were seated at 5:15 and instantly greeted by our waiter and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered the Mai tai and a water and the mai tai was very good! For dinner i ordered the hibachi steak that was delicious! It came out in perfect timing and was cooked a little over what I wanted but it was still great! All in all I prefer this location to the arboretum. I will return!"
EJ D.,"Driftwood, TX",1,14,3,5.0,8/28/2016,"I needed a meal with no gluten, no sugar and no dairy. The manager was very accommodating and checked the ingredients in their steak rub and discovered there is sugar in it. He ensured my steak and steamed veggies were prepared properly and was even the one who brought it out. He was on it from start to finish!!"
Lauren C.,"Austin, TX",0,19,2,4.0,11/27/2016,"Normally I strongly prefer local businesses,  but went to The Cheesecake Factory last night for dessert with friends and had a blast- and the food (and service) was great!  We ordered several different types of cheesecake to share and all were delicious. Only downside was that they were out of strawberry shortcake, which we really wanted to try. Guess we'll have to go back :-)."
Makaela M.,"Austin, TX",59,10,1,5.0,5/14/2017,Today my family and I took my mom here for Mother's Day and the service was awesome despite of how busy they were! We got our food quickly and everything was very yummy!! Our waitress was very sweet as well! I will be coming back here!
Pancho R.,"Novato, CA",40,13,8,2.0,4/13/2016,"I have to say I wasn't impressed with the Tuesday night kitchen staff. For a restaurant with maybe 4 tables which I could see which had people in them, meaning, THE PLACE WAS F*CKING EMPTY!!!! It took about 30min for our food. Which consisted of Pasta and tacos. Wtf. Another thing was, I ""watched"" the waitress write ""NO MUSHROOMS"" and my food HAD mushrooms in it. NOT her fault... it's the drugged kitchen staff working in the kitchen. Lay off the weeed guys.. Now that that's over with... Nikki, our waitress, was phenomenal. What a sweetheart and attentive waitress. She has a heavy Texas accent, was on top of her game as a waitress, and knew her menu!! We will return and request Nikki, best service since we've been in Texas. Just seems like a bunch of hipsters work everywhere, it was nice to speak with someone who knew the menu and paid attention to us. The food itself, was delicious. I got Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, substituted Pine nuts with Feta, omg, delicious. My mates got the Baja tacos, said they were bomb as f*ck, and my other mate got the spring rolls.. he wasn't too impressed, said they were too greasy. Overall, we will come again,  just not if we are starving, can't imagine what's it's like on a bust day here. Oooooooooooohhhhh MY GOD...I FORGOT ABOUT THIS.... ew...ew. ew eeeeeeeeew.. I watched one of the waitresses last night see something in a customer's dessert, it was a bug or something, and she walked almost to our table, turned around, returned to the desert counter, and had the desert guy scoop it off with a knife. F*CK NO YOU DIDNT. And then she hurried the desert to her customers. As she walked past me I acknowledged that I saw her do that, and she smirked. Fun. Gross. Not getting desert here. I started this review with 4 stars.. then changed it to 3.. now this makes 2, gross."
Alex W.,"Austin, TX",1,4,1,1.0,5/20/2016,The worst service I've ever had at a Cheese Cake Factory. The hostess was very rude. I recommend avoiding this location. The food was mediocre.  The place is beautiful but the service needs work. You're better off going to the food court and getting something from Sarku or Thai Kitchen. Any place but this.
E.F. A.,"Austin, TX",0,9,,2.0,8/7/2016,Not impressed.  - Appetizer plate had huge smear of leftover food on it.  - There were 4 of us and we received settings and menu for 3. Had to ask twice for the other persons setting.  - 3/4 of my family is vegetarian. We ordered fried veggie app. Pretty good but toward the end of the dish my hubby bit into calamari. There were several pieces so we told a manager who was apologetic but we were still charged for it. We had to ask for them to take it off (had our daughter bit into calamari it would have been really ugly). The waiter and manager had to talk about it a while but took it off.  The salad I ordered was good (super antioxidant) but not worth the rest of the poor experience.  Customer service matters!!
Emily H.,"Austin, TX",118,197,175,3.0,9/23/2015,"I have to say that I did have one free lunch and one free dinner during their soft opening.  Considering it was free, everything was great! I tried the crab cakes....a giant 10-inch tall salad that looked like a beaver hut and tasted super yum.....the fresh yet conventional salmon dinner with fries....the enormous plate of nachos big enough to feed a pee wee football team....the chocolate cheesecake....and the strawberry cheesecake. Oh, and the hand-squeezed strawberry lemonade.* Service was phenomenal. There was even a crazy moment where a new person was being trained and the trainer would stand behind the trainee and write down on a little pad of paper what needed to be spoken aloud. I felt as if I were in a Vaclav Havel play for a moment there.  There is marble, marble everywhere, and even marbled cheesecake to eat.  I can't say I would go here for a date night, but if I were ever in the mall with friends or family, and got hungry, I would definitely choose this place over any other restaurant in the Barton Creek shopping compound, including CA Pizza Kitchen or Abuelos.  Whatever you do, be warned:  1) There are over 250 items on the menu 2) The portions are HUGE.  So, it probably is not good to bring your indecisive, dieting friend here for her/his birthday. Or maybe that's exactly who you should bring. Anyway, now you know.  *I've decided to boycott semicolons for the day and replace them with ellipses."
Austin C.,"Austin, TX",99,265,153,4.0,2/17/2016,"So here's the deal, I love Cheesecake Factory. I probably haven't sat down to eat at one in 5 or more years, but I frequent that cheesecake-to-go counter. I can't get away from the fact that all cheesecake factories have that ""we look like like a cruise ship to trick people into thinking we're fancy"" vibe to them. I've tried a solid half of the cakes here. They're all delicious. Yeah it's pricey, ~$9 per slice, but daaaaaamn. Just get yourself some cheesecake and move on. The food here is too pricey for what it is."
Sam V.,"Austin, TX",0,13,9,2.0,4/13/2016,"Food was alright, was kinda cold. Didn't taste like how I remembered the good food we normally get. The appetizers were good. Had a bird problem in the store, which revealed that all the high light fixtures and other areas were really dusty... Service was ok. Not a fan they sat two people at a 6 people booth, took away 4 sets of plates/silverware just to have us slide and get the sets at the very end ourselves. When being seated, still had old dishes piled on the seats. She took one set away and left the other set up til it was pointed out...  Probably won't return."
Denielle P.,"Austin, TX",3,16,11,3.0,2/11/2016,"The food is good, service was ok.  The margaritas are really good and the cheesecake is to die for.  But when I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go I found something in the middle of the piece.  Not sure what it was?"
