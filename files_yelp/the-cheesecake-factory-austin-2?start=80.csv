Ellen H.,"Hayward, CA",1,29,7,5.0,12/7/2015,Wonderful experience!   Started with Pineapple Moscow Mule - perfectly refreshing.   Appetizer of fried macaroni and cheese balls - crazy good!   So hard to decide the main dish with so many choices but made an excellent choice with  steak Diane. Wow!  All I can say is it was a very satisfying meal in all regards and I highly recommend you ask for Logan as your waiter if you are lucky enough to mesh timing.    He's the best!!
Cindy P.,"Austin, TX",376,80,55,2.0,9/7/2015,"This place looks really nice and I came in with no wait at around 11 AM. I immediately ordered when sat down to probably save time from waiting, but it's been almost an hour and I haven't gotten my food. The waiter was nice and had my order taken to go since there was nothing else she could do. Overall this place looks nice but perhaps putting silverware on the table instead of folded in a napkin is kind of unsanitary. Food takes A LONG TIME. A lady who sat behind me got her food and left already, but she was seated about 15 minutes after me..."
Maegan S.,"Austin, TX",1,14,,4.0,9/6/2015,"We got mall depression while shopping (""who are we, why are we spending money, why do malls even exist?"") and decided to cure ourselves by getting a slice of cheesecake to go. The cheesecake was delicious, well-prepared, and we wanted to die after we ate it. Cheesecake that rich should be illegal. The American public can't be trusted with such a thing. I'm not sure how we made the drive home while high on so much sugar. What if the police stopped us? But at least the guy at the to go counter was nice."
Tim M.,"Buda, TX",0,16,1,1.0,3/26/2016,"Extremely noisy. Sounds like the dish washer is breaking the plates in anger.  Way too much background noise for my taste  also, the coffee we ordered came out as cold as the ambient air."
Gary N.,"El Paso, TX",42,42,7,1.0,11/24/2015,"This is not my first time at the Cheesecake, usually for a chain restaurant food and service is good. Today the service is atrocious. It took almost an hour to get served. They actually ran out of hamburger buns and Over cooked my burger. And get this: we also ordered the veggie burger and they burnt the last one. Wow! Unbelievable. Manager apologized and gave some excuses comped two entrées and did not offer any free dessert. Obviously the management at this restaurant could use some more training because they rest of hi team really let us down. Will not be coming back to this one."
Jim O.,"Austin, TX",8,218,16,3.0,10/25/2015,Our waiter was a little stuffy and the menu WAY to big.  Food was okay.  Didn't have any cheesecake so I'll have to go back.
Wade W.,"Austin, TX",0,22,,5.0,2/17/2017,"The wife and I just had our third visit within the last month. Just about whatever one wants is on the menu.  Excellent food.  I had the shepherds pie last night and it could have fed two people. Fish tacos was last week and the salmon before that.  Just because this place is in a mall setting doesn't mean it's ""food court"" type fare.  Yes, it's a cheescake place but so much more.  Excellent wait staff and we are going back."
Steven R.,"Carrollton, TX",41,49,65,5.0,6/8/2016,I think management has see the poor reviews on here and stepped their game up. I came here last night with my girlfriend and we were accommodated quickly. Our waiter was Bryan and he was an absolute all star. He was extremely punctual and fast. He gave us time when we needed it. I wanted the chicken couscous plate with salmon instead and he made sure he checked with the cooks first before telling me 1) whether or not they could accommodate my request and 2) whether or not there would be an additional charge for substituting the salmon in. Bryan was really friendly and I really hope he gets picked to become a manager or team leader if an opening comes up. This was without a doubt one of the top 2 or 3 servers I've been waited by. The food was absolutely amazing as well. I will be certain to visit this location again!
Dennis G.,"Kyle, TX",101,64,69,4.0,9/2/2015,"TLDR: Day service from the kitchen is still a work-in-progress. Go for dinner or give them at least another couple of weeks before dropping by for lunch....Unless you have a couple of hours to play with. Food was excellent as usual from CCF.  Have Time: I kind of feel like my in-store comments to the manager fell on deaf ears so this is mostly a ""just in case"" review/shout out.  Thank you Zumar for the excellent service and attention!!  Day shift servers don't get enough appreciation! Basically since this is still a less than two-week old location, they have the ""green"" cooks working during the slower day shifts and the experienced guys putting out plates at night, this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is that it took about 30 minutes to put out a:  -Caesar Salad -Personal pizza -Pulled Pork Sandwich All of which tasted phenomenal BTW. These are all pretty easy lunch items. Zumar did everything he could to expedite the meal, he kept checking in the kitchen, he made sure our drinks and bread stayed fresh, he even comped a piece of cheesecake for the wait.  I'll give them another chance simply because of Zumar's service. I told Mr. Manager this but I didn't feel confident this would go anywhere, considering he went right back to his conversation, I didn't see him write anything down.  Drop in for dinner or give them another couple of weeks to get the day cooks together."
S. T.,"Austin, TX",0,53,82,1.0,8/9/2016,"Didn't know getting a salad was so difficult!! I asked for the salmon to be well done. It was undercooked. They ""corrected"" it. The new one barely any toppings in it. The manager agreed. I asked for additional  toppings and was brought out tiny portions in tiny cups. My salad had to be done twice. Both times were their fault. My only consolation was a fountain drink! Would have been better off (and cheaper) going to Wendy's. BAH HUMBUG!"
Samantha M.,"Corona, CA",3,148,34,1.0,5/13/2016,I'm from California and came here from the mall  anyway the orange chicken was gross no flavor. Took hour and a half ridiculous and rude none of us liked our food
Alycia M.,"Victoria, TX",1,18,1,5.0,6/8/2016,Love it. Every time I go in we get great food and great customer service. Little bit pricey but delicious. The salted caramel cheesecake is to die for.
Jessica S.,"Austin, TX",8,23,2,5.0,7/28/2016,"Came in on Tuesday for appetizers after shopping in the mall and was pleasantly suprised with the portion size of the sliders and cuban wonton rolls. My boyfriend and I were both full, and he can eat a ton."
Lameer Y.,"Austin, TX",39,112,162,5.0,8/31/2015,"First of all !!! Greaatttttttt service, thanks ZUMAR ... You was just Awesome, food : ordered crab cakes and avocado rolls, crab cakes was good but the rolls was burnt and too hard. Bacon bacon burger was awesome. First visit here and I will be back."
Bibiano L.,"Austin, TX",12,138,20,2.0,12/1/2015,"The dulce de leche cheesecake was too much whipped topping and not enough actual cheesecake.  It took 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order, by that point I had already made my way to the to go counter and ordered my cheesecake. I encountered my waiter at said counter and he offered to bring it to us. Too little too late. I marked off 2 stars for service and 1 star for food quality."
Philip B.,"Austin, TX",0,47,67,1.0,12/14/2015,"I like the food and the table service is really good... But every time I eat here (and the Arboretum) it's the same lousy experience at the host stand. There are 4 groups ahead of me today, the restaurant is half full ( open tables everywhere) and the host says ""it will be about 15 minutes"". Meanwhile 3 waiters and what looks like a manager wonder around aimlessly looking for something to do.... How about help the hostess seat the guests and quit waisting everyone's time.... For this transgression you get 1 star... Sorry cooks and waiters, y'all are great but the host system sets such a horrible first impression and that no doubt probably sets the tone for the rest of your guests experience."
Ninja C.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,2.0,2/3/2016,"i LOVE this place. ive been eating at this restaurant in general since i was a wee lady. The problem came with my orange chicken when getting it TO GO CURBSIDE last night. Man, these chefs must be blind because it was not only burnt but it had so little sauce i swear it was a disgrace. I have ordered this entree not kidding at least 100 times and these amateurs managed to do the unthinkable (ew). I will never order this from them again and they should be shunned from even thinking they know how to cook such a great entree. UNIMPRESSED CHEFS, you did your restaurant an injustice. *shakes head and throws cape over face*"
Tony S.,"Austin, TX",0,16,9,4.0,4/27/2016,Came here for lunch and ordered the chicken piccata one of my fav dishes to get here seem to be lunch is the best time to come not a lot of people so no wait time
Ray S.,"Nolanville, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/16/2017,"2.5 stars for this place but only because the portion size belies their claim on their menu that they serve generous portions.  Ordered pasta ($16.50), and the dinner portion was slightly bigger than what we feed our kids. Service was great, and everyone else in our family said their food was great. Come here for entertaining purposes only, not for value!"
Heather P.,"Austin, TX",1,74,89,1.0,6/4/2016,"Terrible. Just terrible. We sat at the bar to eat. Had to ask for the dirty place next to me to get bussed after sitting there for 15 mins. When our food was served I could not get anyone's attention so had to get up and get utensils from the wait station myself. Had to remind the bartender that we needed plates and had asked for bread. Ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and there was enough chicken for just two wraps. Asked for more chicken and 15 mins later the manager brought out 3 tiny, tiny pieces of chicken. We'll never go there again."
