Paul P.,"Round Rock, TX",47,29,67,5.0,12/17/2017,"A perennial favorite with my entire family. We have eaten there dozens of times over the past few years and this is one of those reviews that I constantly remind myself that I am going to write. My wife and I always know that we are going to order the Tamale Corncakes before we even look at the menu. The menu has so many items to offer, that it is sometimes difficult to decide. We have never been disappointed and will continue returning as long as they continue to serve excellent food."
Victoria T.,"Austin, TX",5,31,13,2.0,10/1/2017,"We came in Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm expressly to buy a quick appetizer to-go. The restaurant was slow, with few customers and the countergirl at the cheesecake display area said it would be 10 minutes' wait.  We sat and waited for over 45 minutes, asking twice before our Korean Cauliflower came in a bag. When we took it out to snack, the app was not hot nor crispy, as we had expected, and had fewer florets (only about 11 or so) compared to the dine-in version, mostly crammed with ranch sauce. Also, the breading on the cauliflower floret was not mixed smoothly/well, so there were chalky clumps of raw breading about half the size of a crouton, glommed on. It was so unprofessional, that if we were eating inside the restaurant we would have sent it back to the kitchen. I wish we would have had a full refund."
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,2.0,8/16/2017,"Chicken Madeira ..  I love this dish when it's made right. Quite frankly it just is never made right at this location. It came out spicy (this is NOT a spicy dish), burnt, tough, and cold. Obviously this is the only dish I order if I have this many times to speak for the bad cooking on this one dish. I have even to-go'ed this dish and it was burnt.  Moving onto service .. the hostess was simply rude, and the management didn't seem to care. We proceeded to inform the manager on duty at the time about our incident and he kind of shrugged and said ""I guess we'll have to have a talk later."" The server was busy talking to her friends and our food came out mediocre. My dish was cold and I had to ask multiple times for a refill on water.  It is sad to go from a 5 star review to a 2 star review but that's life I guess. Some businesses stay on it and some just don't. Too bad there isn't another location we could go to. Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite goto restaurants when I lived in Dallas. Oh well :("
Deborah L.,"Austin, TX",553,105,121,4.0,1/1/2018,"I've come here only with my in-laws, and surprisingly, everything I've ordered has impressed me. It still amazes me that so many people come and wait on tables here, even though the place is the size of a castle. You'll notice that the menu is massive, so give yourself time to look over it. The items are priced high, but note that you will get a portions big enough to share with someone, or last you 2 meals. The avocado toast and calamari are good apps to share. I LOVED the shrimp, chicken and sausage gumbo. It comes on a giant plate and tastes even better reheated for left overs the next day. I also tried the chicken Romano pasta- chicken was crispy and easy to eat with the tomato sauce. The steak is also really yummy!"
Jay N.,"Roosevelt, NY",48,324,1950,4.0,10/13/2017,"Place is great,came for the fried mac & cheese balls.the menu has a large selection the staff was professional and courteous,we had Fried Mac and cheese balls they were insanely delicious the entrées were the Pasta Napolitana and the Bang bang shrimp and brown rice both were excellently prepared and presented and were delicious large portions (doggy bag time) how waiter Jason was great but can you suggestions and was very attentive it was a great evening topped off with a shared piece of carrot cake cheesecake."
Ern M.,"Waller, TX",21,10,5,4.0,1/5/2018,Mmm mmm mmm. I always get the steak Diane and shrimp scampi! Love the wine sauce of the steak and the pop of tomato on the shrimp. I would finish it off with a caramel Royal macchiato and the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake!
C. A.,"South Beach, FL",9,112,48,5.0,11/14/2017,Awesome as the first time guest to the area. Service were great and food fresh and on time.
Gabriela B.,"Hutto, TX",8,3,,2.0,12/26/2017,"Went to this place tonight with my family, and the food was excellent, timing for the food to be made was alright, didn't mind the wait, but our service was horrible. After we placed our order for our cheesecakes, she handed us our check. At first I was pretty skeptical that she handed it to us before our desserts came. Now as I'm writing this review, it has been 25 minutes for our cheesecakes to arrive and no sign of our waitress. Unacceptable!"
Sara K.,"Dallas, TX",357,244,413,3.0,4/2/2017,"Last time I had Cheesecake Factory was a year ago, so I decided to come here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday. [Service] When we arrived at the restaurant, the wait was pretty long. There were so many high schoolers wearing tuxedos and dresses, so I'm guessing they planned to dine here for prom. And I guess that's why it took us a while to get seated.  The hostess was soft-spoken, so it was difficult to understand what she was saying especially when the restaurant was super loud.  After we got seated, it took at least five minutes for our waiter to show up at our table. He wasn't that welcoming as there was no smile on his face, and his voice sounded monotonous. It also took a while for the food to come out. [Ambience] Very noisy. I can hardly carry out a conversation with my boyfriend throughout our meal.  [Food] I remembered the portion of the dinner pasta is quite large. So my boyfriend and I decided to share a Four Cheese Pasta as we ate a late lunch that day.   The four cheese pasta was really cheesy as you can tell from the name. I liked it, but it wasn't super amazing. We also got the Ahi Tartare as an appetizer, and we absolutely loved it. Ahi Tartare is basically raw tuna mixed with avocado and soy-ginger sesame sauce that comes with chips. The avocado and the ginger flavor made a great combination.  [Parking] Parking is not an issue as the parking lot is very spacious. I was pretty disappointed with the customer service and the noisy atmosphere here. If I want to visit Cheesecake Factory next time, it will definitely not going to be this location."
Spencer S.,"Austin, TX",17,2,,5.0,12/27/2017,"Zachary was a great server. Table was kept clean and he was prompt on drink refills. It was my first time going to the cheesecake factory, and the number of negative reviews is surprising. The entire experience was positive, food was good, and drinks were good."
Christopher S.,"Pflugerville, TX",62,191,1293,4.0,2/10/2017,"Great menu selection, the kitchen and walk-ins must be huge. Good service, staff and food. App took a while to get out to use but the manager corrected without us even asking. Now that is how things are supposed to work. Great job. Various dishes all were good. Kids especially love the Avocado eggrolls.  They are purdy damn good. 4 entrees and 4 deserts later we have managed to inflate the bill close to 2 bills. A little on the high side but we don't do it often."
Sandra Y.,"Odessa, TX",61,15,53,5.0,5/31/2017,"We always have a great time when eating at the Cheesecake Factory. While in Austin, we of course had to stop because the fried Mac and cheese ball appetizer is so delicious!!! I order it every single time I go to any Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter was attentive, polite and very kind. He gave us time to look through the menu(which yes is very long and big book) and he made sure our drinks were filled and we have plenty of fresh bread and butter. I ordered the special pan seared salmon with a lemon caper sauce and mashed potatoes and broccoli. Was out of this world, not on the menu but if they ever have the special, GET IT, ITS DELICIOUS!! My sister is a vegetarian and she ordered the veggie burger which she loved so much.  The cheesecake is always scrumptious but watch those calories lol it's truly a once in awhile indulgence. This location was quiet environment, we had no problem parking. Everyone was friendly and I was extremely pleased with this location more than any other location I have been too."
Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",44,161,1262,4.0,12/23/2016,"Always a fan of The Cheesecake Factory!!!  Delicious food, great service - awesome selection of scrumptious Cheesecakes makes this gal very happy. I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls for my meal to save room for dessert.  They were absolutely fantastic.  Loved the peanut sauce.  They were fresh and delicious!   For dessert I ordered the long anitcipated Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake.  This sinful delight tasted like a Ferrero Rocher candy!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate, hazelnut and/or Nutello."
LaRon E.,"Austin, TX",80,144,209,3.0,4/18/2017,The waitress Jazz was cool and on point with everything the food was good as well..I would probably head back to the location at Barton Creek because of the ambiance and newer feel..
Samantha G.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",144,29,27,5.0,9/6/2017,"I love this place, I really do. After posting a review on here regarding a disappointing experience (which I hated doing by the way because I have always loved this place) they got in touch with me. They really care about their customers and that means a lot coming from a large company! They will do anything to make things right!"
Gabriel R.,"Dumas, TX",11,18,10,5.0,10/17/2017,Ok awhile back at the Cheesecake Factory I had a bad experience BUT I wasn't going to bash the whole company over this isolated event . So I came back to give them another try and as I had suspected it was an isolated event .the service we received today was great the staff was on point and the food was phenomenal we had Steak Diane and Caeser salad AND lemon cheesecake mmmm . So if you want awesome cheesecake and awesome steak bring the gang on down to The Cheesecake Factory.
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,101,157,3.0,4/14/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory but everything I got seemed a little bit off. I got here for Happy Hour on point. Got the Tex Mex egg rolls slight greasy overly greasy. I thought I was getting the spinach & artichoke dip nah ended up with the crab  & artichoke dip. Not bad but lots of oil in bottom of dish but the bread is good. Don't sit at the end of the bar around 5:15 the sun gets you in your eyes from the upper windows. I think the bar staff is super friendly and helpful. I think the most people are waiting is 15-20 minutes for a table.
Wendy S.,"Leander, TX",125,110,122,4.0,9/18/2016,"Just visited on Friday at 500pm with 10 of my gal pals--I love this place, but, everytime I go there, there is always some drama with the hostess stand, its one of those, that you know its going to happen-- Free, easy parking-- Food was great--even better if you also get a yummy dessert-- Service was great as well--we all had separate checks, some came late, and our waiter was still great and got everything right-- Why the one less star?  The hostesses--they dont take reservations, which I know--but when you have a large party and the gals up front, are not the nicest about it, and the place is not busy, jeez, be NICE, HELPFUL, and make sure the peeps that are there, WANTING a seat, with money in their pockets, get the service that I know you can give"
Charlie B.,"El Paso, TX",17,77,156,1.0,2/13/2017,"Never again! I had the worst chicken avocado sandwich ever! First, the bread was soggy due to the melted cheese and the tons of lettuce and big chunks of tomatoes. The grilled chicken had no flavor, no seasoning, and no salt! And it was two small pieces of chicken. Secondly, all that extra tomato was uncalled for and all that lettuce. So I took off the soggy toasted bread,  cut the chicken, and mixed it with the lettuce and avocado for a small salad, bacon slices included. Even the French Fries were bland and not cooked long enough! Everytime I order something from here, it's no good! OK so the soda and cocktails were delicious."
Dani S.,"Houston, TX",9,48,36,2.0,7/31/2017,"The waiter was terrible and had trouble taking our orders, we were constantly waiting on drink refills, and he skipped taking one person's order. My salad came out and was missing half the ingredients, which he had to bring me separately. By the time I was finally able to eat, everyone else was almost done with their food. The fries were cold and soggy. Luckily he did bring out a new batch that was better. Overall it was a bad experience."
Marcy V.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,6,1,1.0,11/20/2017,"This used to be my favorite place....but what is up.?? Monday at 345... It's not even crowded.. sat at the table over 20 minutes..no server, no waiter, no water no nothing... We got up to leave...nothing... No service what so ever.... But the hostess says..."" Thank you"" ...what is she thanking me for..."
Paula P.,"Austin, TX",143,30,59,1.0,10/9/2017,"Tragic experience every time.  Only reason I end up here is for office birthday or going away lunches where the honoree has a total disregard for everybody's time.  Whether a party of two or twelve, expect to have your food come out about two hours after ordering it, this includes salad.  Also forget about drink refills, they don't exist at Cheesecake Factory, you'll just have to wait for ice to melt and sip on that slowly because you're not getting any more ice either.  People joining us for a little bit had to request food items to go because not everyone can sit and take a three hour lunch.  I keep hoping each time it is better and it's just not.  Stay away or if you must come for cheesecake, just pick it up and take it to go."
Sara S.,"Austin, TX",2,28,10,1.0,12/18/2016,"Let's preface this with; there is a Five Guys in the same lot, I would recommend them over Cheesecake Factory any day. Upon walking in, you'll discover the decor is oddly fancy? There are Pharaoh heads painted above the hostess station, it's quite comical really. My initial thoughts: ""Wow, this is a bit cheesy and over the top."" Once we received the menu, it confirmed my over-the-top gut instinct. The menu is a ring bound book of way too many dishes.  So, we ended up trying lunch today, anyway. We ordered; the Avocado Egg Rolls, the ""lunch serving"" of Fettuccini Alfredo and a Chicken Parma sandwich. The avocado egg roll was greasy, no crunch at all. The sauce that came with it was grossly sweet. We had to send it back.  If you enjoy gummy fettuccine and super heavy Alfredo sauce, this is the place for you. I took a couple bites and was over it. The green peas I had added to it USUALLY breaks up a heavy dish like this, but even that couldn't save it. Also, the ""lunch serving"" of this dish is only about a dollar cheaper than the dinner serving. Wow, what a savings.  The Chicken Parm sandwich was more of a bread sandwich with a tiny piece of chicken. The breading on the chicken also slid off mid bite. Marinara was bland. My boyfriend had ordered a salad with this dish and they gave us his salad dressing about 15 minutes prior to receiving his meal (which was brought to us with French fries and no salad). In conclusion, this place should stick to what it's actually good at, and has made a name for itself with - Cheesecake."
S V.,"Bahama, NC",0,25,141,2.0,6/3/2017,"Unbelievable - shockingly rude customer service.  We ordered three items, the first arrives in 6 minutes, the second dish arrives after 25 minutes and the third dish never arrives. When asked, the waiter says he didn't realize we ordered 3 dishes - no apologies or offer to order again. I don't think the wait staff are trained well."
Diane S.,"Austin, TX",5,45,4,1.0,12/1/2017,16 minutes to place a drink order. 22 minutes to get a simple glass of Sauv Blanc. Ordered food with it and that st least came fast. 90 minutes later...:I am still waiting on my check after asking 10 minutes ago and not having been checked on since the food came up 35 or so minutes back.
Brian M.,"Austin, TX",99,15,1,2.0,10/14/2017,Sooo SLOW!!! Always a super long wait for carry out. Almost always some kind of an issue or problem.
Veronica R.,"Hutto, TX",2,6,,5.0,10/20/2017,"We visited CCF today and we had an amazing experience, starting with our server Paul and his stellar customer service,the food and desserts were great as well."
Vivy T.,"Cedar Park, TX",365,15,36,4.0,7/30/2017,"We were close enough to go get some cheesecake during national cheesecake day! Shrimp with angel hair- this was soo good. It was a good balance between shrimp and marinara sauce. Highly recommend.  Funfetti cheesecake - limited addition during national cheesecake day. If you ever get the chance to get it, GET IT.  Revolver blood and honey - draft beers. Highly recommend and hard to find!"
Jye T.,"Austin, TX",41,28,,2.0,9/23/2017,"The menu is too large. The food is sloppy and low quality, especially for what you pay. Decent experience if you are intoxicated and need sustinance but I would spend my money elsewhere in Austin. For the same prices, you can have food of much much higher quality."
Megan C.,"San Antonio, TX",151,200,378,4.0,8/19/2016,"First time ever eating at a cheesecake factory. Wasn't sure I would like it, because I don't usually choose to eat at chain restaurants. Snobby, I know. Surprisingly though, I really enjoyed myself. We ordered the Thai Chicken wraps to split. It was really good! There were three sauces and they all tasted great. I really liked the peanut one. I had fun making little lettuce tacos. I'd go to a Cheese Cake Factory again, and try something different."
Lamanda B.,"Cedar Park, TX",203,111,64,4.0,5/1/2017,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years, but this was worth the trip. Their menu selection was amazing! Any type of food you could think of was on this menu. I loved the bread that they bring out. Our first batch of bread was perfect. Nice and soft. The batch after that was burnt. The waiter tried to bring out more bread in hopes of it being better, but they were all burnt. haha. It was okay. I started off with the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I love Jamaican food, but I should have known better ordering it from anywhere other than a Jamaican spot. The presentation was perfect, but I was expecting my food to be spicy. It was so sweet and taste like pineapple. I decided to send it back and try something different. I probably should have got the gumbo, but I opted for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. This was good, don't get me wrong, but it would have tasted better with rice or a bowtie pasta. I love that it still came with a little heat behind it because I love spicy food. Our waiter, Jason, was fantastic. He was so pleasant and helpful as struggled deciding on what to eat. I'm looking forward to returning."
Felicia G.,"College Station, TX",0,28,5,3.0,5/31/2017,It is what to be expected. Not one of the best locations as far as appearance and staff helpfulness.
Omar Z.,"Sugar Land, TX",164,100,990,4.0,8/14/2016,"The atmosphere here was great but I had issues with our waiter.  I don't feel like he really wanted to serve us which again was just from his tone and body language.   He seemed really annoyed that we wanted to split the checks but we gave him a heads up from the get go so I don't see why it's a problem.   Even though he wasn't the best I still tipped him.    The atmosphere at this location was really cool and everyone was pretty chill.  Great place for large portions and I mean large.   Order a to go box or two.  Seriously I could not finish my food and it was taken to go and I just finished it up a day later after writing this review.   Chicken Parmesan sandwich was my main dish and I got a Caesar salad which was untouched because I just over ordered, but I tasted a stale crouton.    The sandwich was so big and so tasty on a French beget.   I enjoyed my Strawberry fruit smoothie and even got a brain freeze which proved to me how much I liked it.  I also ordered the chocolate mouse cheesecake and it is still chillin in my fridge and I'm about to go get it so I'm going to end this review now.  Go get you some cheesecake already."
Shay B.,"Austin, TX",25,9,8,5.0,9/21/2017,"Every time I come here I have a great time. I haven't ever had bad service here but tonight was definitely the best I've had in a while, here and in a restaurant in general. Rob had the best timing I've seen in a server. Consistently moving through his section, he caught us anytime we needed something as soon as we needed it. I finished my drink and set it down, content to wait for another, and he was there to pick it up and refill it. The chicken pot stickers came out as soon as we were done with the bread and butter, there was hardly any wait between app and entree (that was because we already knew what we wanted, though), and our leftovers and new cheesecake order were promptly packed up and delivered. Like I mentioned before I've never had bad service here but I hope I get to sit in his section again next time!"
Sarah M.,"New York, NY",238,227,1414,4.0,11/21/2015,"How to describe Cheesecake Factory... I always feel like I'm walking into Caesars palace in Vegas here. It's like an Olive Garden/Chili's/P.F. Chang's on steroids. But really good food, just a ridiculously massive menu with all types of food.   The first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory, I ate too much and didn't even have room for cheesecake. Major fail, I know.  I didn't make that mistake the 2nd time. Or maybe I did but I just forced myself to make room. You can't skip out on cheesecake! I've ordered the same thing all 3 times because I'm an unimaginative creature of habit. But hey at least I know what I like, right? I have tried different cheesecakes so hopefully I get a little credit there.  The last two times at the arboretum location we've had to ask for bread so if you're not in the know, ask for it bc the wheat is very tasty. I ate 6 pieces tonight. Whoops. I was hungry. And if you ask for extra you'll have extra to take home with your leftovers.  We got the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer tonight and they were very good. You should probably get them too.  I enjoy the Chicken Crusted Romano and I only get about a third in before I stop myself so I will have room cheesecake. I tried a friends luau salad and it's pretty good as well.  The quality is consistent here and there is something for everyone. Literally. Because they have one of everything."
Jose N.,"Austin, TX",216,91,738,4.0,6/11/2016,"I've gone to the Cheesecake Factory a few times and I always get the same thing. Either the Thai Lettuce Wrap or the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake. The appetizers are kind of big so,I get that as my meal. They have a big selection of what to eat and what to drink. But I like these two appetizers so I'll stick to these. If I were to pick one of these two, I'll go for the Lettuce Wrap. That will leave you some room for a delicious slice of Cheesecake."
Kexin L.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,2.0,8/16/2017,"When I almost finished half of my pasta I found a tiny rock/plastic in my pasta(using my teeth). And the serves said it is salt. It was me who bite that rock and I can definitely figure out whether it is a piece of salt or what. Although it's a tiny one, I'm afraid whether there're any more left in the pasta and going into my stomach(bc it is tiny). The manager removed that from our bill. ( appreciate it and it saves the stars). The serves of the server was awful, she didn't bring us bread and we asked other person to bring that for us at first."
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,5.0,12/29/2016,"As is to be expected at any Cheesecake Factory, the food here is phenomenal. Portions are huge and everything is super tasty. One thing I'd definitely suggest doing if possible is coming on some off time, in between the lunch and dinner rush or something. Otherwise, the wait to be seated will be pretty long. If you do come in between the rushes, you can likely just walk in and be seated immediately. Sweet. Service is great. The cheesecakes are great as always. I'm personally a fan of the 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's the perfect combo of chocolate and regular cheesecake so it's not too chocolatey. The other chocolate ones are simply too much in my opinion (though if you're a chocolate addict they'll be right up your alley), but this one is a combination of chocolate cake and plain cheesecake, so for me it's perfect. So good. The vanilla bean cheesecake is also phenomenal. If something like this can taste amazing where you don't have any chocolate to overpower your taste buds, then the cheesecake has to be awesome."
Terri J.,"Austin, TX",304,426,2277,3.0,9/19/2015,"Late evening dessert choice.  After bowling alley food, we were in the mood for dessert.  What is open at 10pm on a Friday night in north Austin for good dessert?  Cheesecake Factory! We sat in the bar & he asked for two waters (I was elsewhere at the time).  She brought one.  He thought that was weird.  It was.  We ordered another water.  Tick tock...tick tock...  Then we ordered an appetizer and requested water again.  I wasn't really hungry for food food, but I will always eat crab rangoons; especially good ones.  These were above average for sure.  We had to ask for napkins & utensils. I also ordered a margarita (no salt) & water...again.  She brought the margarita with salt.  I sent it back.  No biggie - this gets screwed up at most places.  Still...no water.  At this point, I had really forgotten about the water bc I had booze. After we decided on our cheesecake, he mentioned I still had not received my water & I said ""yeah, that's weird"".  I do like water, even more so if I'm having a cocktail. So, I asked for water again & a refill for him (bc his had been empty for quite a while) AFTER we received our cheesecake.  This time, we got it.   Cheesecake was good, of course.  It never disappoints.  The service was not so great.  Our server was super sweet & training a new server.  We were really just there for dessert, so we didn't care, but the service quality was lacking.  I think we would have been pissed if this had happened when we were there for dinner."
Samuel F.,"Dothan, AL",5,3,,5.0,8/25/2017,Excellent food and service. We came in a large party of adults and kids. We were able to be seated after a short wait. I would say this place is kid friendly. We chose the place for the deserts which are always very tasty. The main dishes were very good as well and did not disappoint. We will definitely be back.
