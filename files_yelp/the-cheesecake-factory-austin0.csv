Marisol M.,"Austin, TX",1,7,1,1.0,10/19/2015,"Long story but let's just say they forgot my food, forgot my cheesecake, and the waitress took forever to pick up our checks. Plus, they could have a better manager who knows how to interact with people and not respond with ""I know huh?"" I had just visited the Cheesecake Factory in Utah and did not have such an unpleasant experience. Never again will I go to this place!"
Tim Y.,"Washington, DC",1108,221,461,5.0,1/19/2014,"Let's just start by saying that I loathe The Cheesecake Factory.  It's where you go on really fancy date night in High School or in College because you don't know any better... and if you're choosing to go here over the plethora of unique and awesome restaurants in Austin, you bring great shame upon yourself and your entire family. I say that to say this:  I have to give it 5 stars based off of a singular experience I had there the other night.   I didn't choose to go... it was a friend's birthday and she wanted to go... In total, she suckered 8 people to go there on her birthday. The food was the usual oversized portions of junk, the cheesecake was cheesecake, the service is always spot on... But then THERE WAS A COCKROACH CRAWLING ON ONE OF OUR PARTY-GOER'S BACKS! She stood up and screamed... then half the table screamed... then her baby started crying.   We called the manager over who, after just 2-3 minutes of decent apology and no haggling... comped our entire meal... that's 8 people to the tune of about $200. She didn't have to do that, but she was extremely sympathetic and awesome.   So see, even though I only go to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm forced to be there, this experience says they know customer service. DISCLAIMER:  If you go and act like there's a bug on you to get free food after reading this, you're a loser. DOUBLE DISCLAIMER:  Again... shame on you if you go here for ""fancy dinner"" and neglect the amazing non-chain spots we have around town."
Arif M.,"Austin, TX",15,3,,5.0,9/4/2015,"I love ""Louisiana pasta"" at cheese cake factory. cheese cake factory is a safe bet for having good food in a place with nice ambiance."
Ryan B.,"Austin, TX",242,190,169,1.0,1/4/2014,"Shockingly bad customer service experience. Disappointing visit after visiting this location multiple times. The Cheesecake Factory has a great selection of cakes as you walk in. I've always ordered a slice or two on my way out. This night, however, featured some of the clumsiest and worst customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. It was a birthday dinner for a friend of ours. A cheesecake was purchased up front as we waited to be seated. The wait time was only a little over 30 minutes on a Friday for a large group. Not bad. That was the end of the good experience. The menu is overbearing, the servers have no idea what is available and what isn't available. You finally make a selection only to have the waiter come back ten minutes later and tell you there is no pizza dough. That is the most frustrating feeling when you are hungry. I tried to order a couple of margaritas while we waited. The waiter suggested I try some of the famous cocktails instead. He talked me into them, so we ordered two. Five minutes pass, no cocktails. Ten minutes... We ask him where the cocktails are? He looks up into the ceiling for a second as if he is in deep thought... Oh he forgot to key them into the system and they were never ordered. Wow what a disaster of a visit this is. Our food has already arrived, no drinks and a confused service attendant. We ended up declining to have the drinks ordered at this point. Why give them the money? We had mentioned at the beginning that it was someone's birthday at our table. The other tables around us got birthday songs and normal treatment. This waiter spaces, didn't say a word to our birthday patron and then managed to forget to bring out the cake twice. When he did finally bring out the cake, he kind of looked at us not saying a word.. then realized he had brought no plates or silverware for us to consume the cake with. As he reached over the cake to pickup our old plates, he almost made contact with the cake with his shirt several times. He then proceeded to bring out two boxes that didn't fit the cake. I've never seen someone so lost in space or on another planet in my life. Save yourself the trouble people. Order a dessert to go from the front and run run run away from here."
Ben S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,1.0,11/15/2015,"I called in our order for several Cheesecakes from this location today for a birthday celebration.  Everything seemed fine over the phone.  We get there to pick it up and they tell us they don't have our order.  My wife asks several times and they tell us we must have called it in to the wrong location.  I check my phone, compare numbers, start calling around to figure out what happened thinking maybe the number we had from their website was wrong.  We finally talk to a manager and figure out they had our order all along, they just couldn't find it.  The rude cashier even lied telling her boss we told her slices instead of cakes.  The manager was not sympathetic at all.  Acted like this is just normal for them.  I'll never do business with these unprofessional clowns again.  Your incompetence is not your customer's fault.  Food is good but not worth the hassle with bad service. Update:  It now appears that they double charged our card for the order on top of everything else.  After 3 more phone calls with them to 'figure out what happened', I've been told they're 'fixing' the charge mistake.  I should look for a credit to my account in 7-10 days.  Don't give these people your bank card unless you like fighting with their incompetent staff to get your money back."
Kenny S.,"Austin, TX",103,20,16,5.0,8/2/2015,I try a diff dish every time I come here and loved everyone one of them.  Avocado eggrolls are EVERYTHING!!
Phillip M.,"Georgetown, TX",21,76,28,3.0,7/17/2015,"Good service. Good burgers. It's been a while since we were there. It seems the usual favorites like the chicken Bellagio and fish Tacos have slipped in flavor and quality but over all, pretty good."
Jennifer N.,"Austin, TX",85,417,2629,4.0,10/23/2012,Menu is a novel in itself but there are gems within this book. The entrees are plentiful and you will always have some to take home. Sharing is a good option. The food rarely if ever fails. It's definitely a must go. Default place if you can't think of somewhere to go. There's always something for everyone. If not that person is super picky! The drinks are delicious as well as the appetizers. Dessert is out of this world. Oddly enough I'm not a cheesecake person. The strawberry shortcake is amazing! The speciality cheesecakes are also delicious. Rarely has a wait which is unheard of for the Austin area!
Lorraine W.,"Southern Pines, NC",83,185,370,5.0,6/29/2014,"How could you not love this place? The food selection is enormous and so are the portions. The only downside, if there is a wait, its usually 20-30 minutes, so come early on weekend brunch and early on dinner dates too."
David A.,"Austin, TX",0,108,47,4.0,8/9/2015,"Nice restaurant with great staff and some nice choices.  I like the atmosphere, cheesecake and the Grilled Chicken Avocado Club sandwich."
Jordan Z.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,5.0,10/25/2015,When my family and I first came to Austin we probably ate at Cheesecake 3 times a week. After 12 years of living here we don't go as often but it's still our go to for most family functions. The food and service are great! I would highly recommend it to anyone!
Emmy C.,"Gulf Shores, AL",243,5,,5.0,10/22/2015,"I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend. The restaurant is so grand and beautiful, but the food is reasonably priced. Our waitress was super patient and even though it took us forever to order, she didn't make us feel rushed. We had the calamari (YUM), orange chicken, and strawberry shortcake for dessert. She was sweet enough to put a candle on my dessert and write happy birthday in chocolate syrup! Great birthday dinner :) & will return for more date nights!"
Michael W.,"California, MD",0,25,10,2.0,7/8/2015,"Nice looking and clean place but the food and wait were subpar all the way around.  I had the Spicy Cashew Chicken and other than being overly salty there was no spicy flavoring at tall. In fact, it was actually pretty bland. Our wait time was excessive and when we asked about it the wait staff apologized for not putting the main course in thinking we would be taking longer to eat the appetizer. The cheesecake was also not so good. At least the manager came over and took the chicken if the bill."
Samantha S.,"Edinburg, TX",9,11,3,2.0,8/1/2015,"I'm not from Austin and I haven't been to the Cheese Cake Factory since I was little. The restaurant is beautiful. It was super busy. The hostesses were very nice. They told my friend and I it was going to be a 15 min wait. It took about 10 mins.. the hostess took us to a table that was already sat and apologized and took us to another table. Which was completely understandable. Ok. So our server. He meant well that's all I'm gonna say. He took our alcohol drinks without carding us. I'm 24. I pulled out my ID he said that was fine. My friend asked for an unsweet tea that she didn't get until after the meal was brought because we asked a Different server that brought out our meal if she'd get us one. She ordered an appetizer that we had to remind him we wanted and he obviously didn't ring it in until after the meal. I told him I had never been there and the menu all looked awesome. I ordered something that  but modified it. He got 1 of the modifications right. He never touched the table again. I had to wave him down for a box. Again, for our check. But what pissed me off the most was that he kept using the word ""f***"" with us like he was talking to his buddies and still charged for the appetizer. If I everrr go back there I would request NOT to have that server. The food was delicious. That's probably the only reason why I'd ever go back."
Vincent F.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2015,"I've eaten at several cheesecake factories, and the service has usually varied between excellent to adequate. Even when the service was so-so, once informed, the manager was willing to make it right. Not at this one. The food took over an hour, two of the plates were cold, and the drinks had to be frequently requested. These things happen, but once I told the manager that our experience was bad, she made vague assertions as to doing something and then did nothing. I won't be eating here again, and I don't recommend you do either. I'm sure there is another location that might value our patronage more."
Myranda Y.,"Austin, TX",23,23,4,4.0,3/15/2014,"Been to different Cheesecake Factories all over such as 2 San Diego locations, 2 Bay Area locations, Honolulu, and Seattle. None have seated me, got my drink, appetizer, or food to me so quickly on a Friday night.   So far the best all around Cheescake Factory in my opinion.  The only negative I would say is, if you get seated by the register screen.. it's gossip central for the workers."
Scott G.,"Austin, TX",563,215,242,3.0,1/7/2014,"Went here for a friend's birthday. I've only been here once before that, and I don't really remember it. I was just hoping to get a glimpse of Sheldon or Leonard or Penny, but I guess I need to go to the one in Pasadena for that. Bazinga. We were seated quickly. Hostess was nice. Server was lots of fun, we really enjoyed her. Drinks were kind of steep, but we were all taking it easy anyway. Leila R seemed to enjoy her fried macaroni cheeseburger, and my bbq pizza was fine, nothing to rave about, but certainly not bad. The best part was definitely the service. I wish I had taken down my server's name, since she was so great. Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I were in the Arboretum and needed some carbs, this would be my spot."
Aaryn P.,"Cedar Park, TX",296,722,190,2.0,1/7/2012,"This particular CcF is dramatically beautiful - inside and out. Unfortunately, the meals, (mainly) ho-hum service and  general experience did not match the grand decor of the place.  We came in for lunch today and were seated right away which was a plus. Our waiter came by a few minutes later and took our drink order. In true CcF fashion, it took us about 15-20 minutes to pour over the exhaustingly huge menu. Our waiter came back and took our order - we had: 2 Pizza/Salad Lunch Specials 1 Wild Mushroom Bread 1 Order of Sliders 1 Order TexMex Eggrolls Everything came out fairly quickly and the food was alright. So, what was my big problem here? For some reason, our waiter had memory problems, and unfortunately they were directed towards one particular person in our party. This person initially ordered coffee. When he was done with his coffee the waiter came over and asked him if he wanted a refill, and he said, ""No, but I think I'll switch to Coke."" We waited for that Coke... the waiter even came back and refilled everyone else's drinks without bringing that Coke or re-asking the person if they wanted anything else to drink. So, someone had an extra water, and they gave it to that person... but there was no straw. The same guy asks the waiter for a straw...and we wait for the straw...and wait. His girlfriend finally had to ask a second time for a straw. It was just a little wtf, that's all.  Anyways... I'd give this place 3 stars for A-Ok because..ehh it was anything special, but it was alright...but the service needs to improve before I add that third star. Meh, I've had better service."
Stephanie R.,"Austin, TX",79,202,134,3.0,12/19/2013,"Swept up in the decor, ambiance, and company, you can almost get through a meal without really noticing the food. Not here.  The nachos appetizer was really tasty, our meals were so good we l shared bites. The Chicken Bellagio is soooo good.  All in all a great time and great place for a night out."
Layla A.,"Georgetown, TX",0,6,3,2.0,2/12/2016,"The food was great but the drinks sucked. For a $9 margarita you would expect it to be good but mine was like drinking ice water. So not worth it, I'll stick to a coke next time."
