Rachel B.,"Round Rock, TX",24,53,379,2.0,2/20/2016,"My coworkers and I have stopped in multiple times for lunch and happy hour since we work next door (within walking distance). The food is good, the portions are large (keep that in mind when you look at prices) but the service is consistently terrible.  I can't tell if they've been understaffed (for two years?) or if people just aren't getting the proper training. Multiple times we've had to wait 15+ minutes to be greeted. Then, once we put in orders and the drinks are delivered, no one seems interested enough to stick around for us to order our food.  It's like pulling teeth. This past Friday was especially terrible. Once there were more tables seated outside it got better, but in the beginning it was like we were an inconvenience. After years of working in the restaurant industry I do understand the challenge of handling the single large party on the patio, but come on. You have a patio that people want to use, so figure out how to service the patio without making it so obvious that it's out of your way. Do you want our money or not? I don't like having to flag down other waiters to find out where our server is. Waiting 15 minutes to be greeted (when the servers are huddled up by the bar chatting, or looking out at our table like ""are you going to take it? I'm not."") and missing out on happy hour pricing because of if also isn't on my list of favorite things.  We all have a choice about where to have our next meal, where to celebrate the next birthday, where to take our next date. Not sure that Cheesecake Factory is the best choice."
John C.,"Clarksville, TN",104,48,364,4.0,4/5/2015,"It's got a strange lighting thing going on here, it's like a soft orange glow, almost not bright enough to read the menu.  This place is obviously open today (Easter).  The fish and chips was pretty good. The rest said the portions were nice and large.  Bring on the cheesecake dessert."
Kaui C.,"Copperas Cove, TX",80,123,583,5.0,3/31/2016,"Ate here on Easter. I expected it to be a long wait time. Waited for about 20 minutes (not bad). Our waiter was friendly and treated us kindly, even when he seemed really busy. Our food took long but we ordered a lot. It was a pig out for our Easter lunch. The food came out delicious! We enjoyed everything! Portions are huge! Well worth the price on the menu! I love Cheesecake Factory and this one didn't disappoint, even when it was a busy holiday."
Ahma H.,"Sugar Land, TX",20,183,1372,4.0,1/1/2015,"Burned out. Tired. Day one of a vacation and a long drive from H town.  Hello Austin. And glad for two Christmas Gift Cards from the Cheesecake Factory to enjoy w my spouse.  We found this Cheesecake location on Yelp. I was a little concerned w the prior Yelp reviews. Hmm. They only make reservations for parties of 7 or more. Boo. And up until 5:30 pm. Boo again. Parking crazy. Boo. But when we walked in, wow, it's like a whole new place. We were seated immediately.  What?  Yelp reviews said otherwise.  Hey and it's Christmas week and a lobby with people.  And we got sat right away?! Impressive.  The Food ordering no problem and everything ordered tasted great despite some reviews. And, the coffee was right on. Being from Jersey, it's the first thing I order. Some habits are hard to break. The awkward note about the visit was nothing to do with the restaurant but everything to do with unscripted joy of a small child. And For people with kids, this comes with the territory....In the ladies bathroom was a small young child happily singing randomly song after song - a serenade - of her own Christmas Concert and occasionally matching the Christmas Santa Clause Has Come to town Muzak songs emanating out of the loo's ceiling speakers. I left the loo singing myself. Santa had come to town. So let's give Santa and the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. And the kid 5 for making a joyful noise. May all your visits to Cheesecake Factory be as magical, happy and bright."
Craig P.,"Austin, TX",61,28,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Went to the factory again, we had decided not to frequent them based on poor food presentation over cooked sitting under the heat lamps poor wait staff attention etc. Well nothing improved. My wife loves the lemon ricotta pancakes but when they've been over cooked and sit until they turn flat who would enjoy them. My eggs sunny side up on the quevos ranchos came out hard not runny. Yuk! We walked after busting with the manager who couldn't understand how any of this could of happened. We waited an hour from the time that we down."
Martina M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,22,4,5.0,4/16/2016,"Saturday evening  5 people  5 minute wait  Super super sweet waiter !!!! He was awesome !!!! It's prom night and it was packed but so fun! Good was delish, cake amazing !!!!  Coming back for sure !!!"
Aline M.,"Lisbon, Portugal",38,45,116,5.0,6/1/2015,Take a slice of cheesecake to go is perfect!  I really recommend Orion Cheesecake. It's almost $9 but I take more than 3 days to eat that big slice!
Austin C.,"Austin, TX",99,265,153,4.0,2/17/2016,"So here's the deal, I love Cheesecake Factory. I probably haven't sat down to eat at one in 5 or more years, but I frequent that cheesecake-to-go counter. I work in the area. So it's easy to stop by on the way home and surprise bae with some dessert at least once a month. You know the week you should do it, fellas. I can't get away from the fact that all cheesecake factories have that ""we look like like a cruise ship to trick people into thinking we're fancy"" vibe to them. I've tried a solid half of the cakes here. They're all delicious. Yeah it's pricey, ~$9 per slice, but daaaaaamn. Just get yourself some cheesecake and move on. The food here is too pricey for what it is."
Phieu-Lo N.,"Austin, TX",31,44,67,2.0,12/19/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is slowly going downhill. Every time I'm here, I receive such horrible service. I didn't expect that from Cheesecake Factory since it's considered ""fancy"". I went here for a celebration for my friend's birthday and they didn't offer her a complimentary cheesecake like they used to. Now they offer you a mini Sundae which literally has nothing but whipped cream and chocolate.  THE FOOD it's in a good amount of portions, big size but it could be overly salty or just bland. But I got the luau salad and I enjoyed it! Overall food + service = 2/5"
Lyubov L.,"Round Rock, TX",46,60,355,4.0,4/9/2015,"It's really good place to eat. Food is excellent, but service is not the best. I've ordered a cheesecake and a tea. I've got my tea only after I ate a half of the cheesecake."
Tori S.,"Austin, TX",10,22,26,4.0,5/11/2015,"So pleased with today's dinner at Cheesecake Factory! I've been searching for my favorite menu item for a while and I really enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. The flavors were balanced well and it was on their yummy sourdough bread. I got it with the sweet potato fries (totally worth the up charge). The sweet potatoes were crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside. So good! Our server, Adrian, was attentive and friendly.  Of course dessert was excellent. Overall a really pleasant meal!"
Jeannie S.,"Austin, TX",0,45,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Searched long and hard for somewhere fun with good food to take our bday girl turning the big 13. She was so excited for her big day and the thing she looked forward to the most was not being handed a kids menu!! Had good memories of this place from Seattle. So... we get there and are immediately faced with a snarky rude cold hostess who didn't even look up and glance when I let her know we were celebrating our daughters 13th. Made my daughter feel really special... yep. In fact no one standing lifeless at the hostess counter even looked at us or cracked a smile. She then takes us to our table without a hint of a friendly gesture, throws 2 kids menus at our 13 and 10 year old (these are designed for 12 and under so ya- no clue here ; what a lame hostess)... literally tosses a heap of utensils right in the middle of the table and walks off. She walks back to bring a few napkins or something of the sort and I told her to remove the kids menu and bring our 13yo bday girl a GROWN UP MENU. She rolls her eyes and huffs off, obviously cursing under her breath and delivered said menu to our poor daughter. Had I the energy or the want to add additional stress to our special celebration I would have involved the manager.  However I decided to stay focused on our waitress who seemed interested in turning things around. (Meanwhile getting drive by evil eye by psycho hostess...) so, I pulled her to the side to kindly let her know about our bday girl and that I had brought #1 and #3 candles for her dessert. She happily asked to place them in her pocket until the reveal. I'm thinking things will turn around. Fast forward past an average overpriced dinner that didn't blow our socks off, here comes the long awaited lit cheesecake and cameras rolling as the bday song starts.... and we are totally let down as we noticed the #1 candle is a little stub completely broke off .. yes 1/4 of a #1 they had the nerve to stick into the cake sitting about an inch out of the cake looking totally stupid and the #3 fully intact which looked even more stupid. Then they act as if they don't notice!!  We are all staring at this stupid looking candle wondering what the heck happened! Ya think maybe someone could have had the decency or brains to bring this to my attention and just notify us that they could use other replacement candles (which yes I called ahead and made sure they do have basic candles for such events). So daughter leaves to the bathroom and I just had to ask the waitress what happened.   She looks embarrassed and puzzled in how to cover her tracks and proceeds to share with us about how it was in her pocket then got moved to a drawer than got moved to kitchen and something must've happened... ya just admit that someone broke it, apologize and let's get on with this lame horrible disaster of a night would ya??!!! OMG- NEVER GOING BACK. Just horrendous service.  Whoever you are managing this place and was there on the night of 7/26/17 at 5:45 PM, fire the hostess who would rather be smoking crack in the alley then graciously  serving customers and turning them into repeat customers. You know which one I'm talking about. Just another conglomerate impersonal restaurant chain that got too big for its britches and forgot about quality and service!!!!"
Tiffany O.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",15,28,12,1.0,8/6/2017,"I've had several poor experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but somehow always get amnesia and end up coming back. I'm finally writing this review, in part to remind myself not to make the mistake of returning again.   Extremely slow service (waiting over an hour for a simple order for 2 people), incorrect order fulfillments, and unresponsive corrections to the orders are all routine here.  In fact, I can only remember one time that I dined here uneventfully.  I am honestly not a picky person and rarely complain, so I can only imagine how more discriminating guests respond to their experiences which I doubt are any better than mine have been.  The take-out ordering has also been problematic nearly every time I've used it.  I'm not sure how a chain restaurant of this size can continue to operate with such poor performance.  I have to assume it's due to the proximity to a large hotel which must bring in unsuspecting visitors who don't realize the consistency of the terrible service, poor management, and overall poor experiences at this location.  I hate writing bad reviews, but since I've had plenty of bad experiences here, all of which cumulatively reflect a one-star rating, I feel obliged to share my opinion of this establishment to further the accuracy of Yelp."
Robert P.,"Austin, TX",692,28,2,5.0,7/21/2016,"Food was delicious and service excellent!  Alexander J. was our waiter and he was well put together and an excellent example of The Cheesecakr Factory ideal.  He was genuinely friendly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and my friend had the Steak Diane.  Both were great though I think next time I'll order the Steak Diane, it was that good.  We got there right before the dinner rush so it's always easy to give great service when it's not busy but even when Alexander's station filled up he didn't forget about us.  I appreciate that.  Food and service....WINNING!"
Pat W.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,35,,2.0,9/20/2016,"This review is only for the cheesecake, which, you would think is the whole point of the Cheesecake Factory! The food and service are great, however, the cheesecake has definitely changed for the worse.  It tastes like it has hardly any cream cheese in it and has an oily, cool whip kind of taste.  This has happened twice - first with Red Velvet (I couldn't eat it, and, I finish anything even while I am complaining!) and the second was the classic, thinking it would be the real thing - it wasn't.  Never ordering cheesecake at the factory again..."
Shanery T.,"Austin, TX",98,49,254,3.0,1/28/2016,Love how there's so many options to choose from! I've had the spaghetti and avocado egg rolls but my favorite would have to be the chicken bellagio. Love the tuxedo cheesecake too. Always a great place to take your family or friends or a date.
John F.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,2.0,9/30/2016,"I don't understand why I keep going here. Maybe for convenience or just ignorance. I've been to this particular location 3+ times and it seems the service and food just got worse and worse. I ordered the burger and fries. They were cold and the burger was underdone. I get the servers and chef are busy people (so I tipped well), but they should still uphold a certain standard."
Tom B.,"Austin, TX",69,28,10,5.0,10/10/2015,"What if you are what you eat I'm a New Yorker cheeze cake are you?  My wifes Tarrot cake. I first 8 at the cheese cake fact when I was in the wood lands Texas. I thought to myself this place looks TWO fancy for me but my wife had to. It was her company XMas.  Oh wait I meen """"Holliday"" don't want to get the fife fired.  I was suprised their was more than cheesecake but it was ok."
Neal M.,"Austin, TX",432,794,107,4.0,10/12/2016,"If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, prepare for option paralysis.  The menu is a novella.  That said, a lot of menu items are somewhat similar in the sense that many ingredients can be interchangeable. I've been here a few times over the years and as much as I don't like going to chain places, this can be an exception.  The portions are crazy huge.  Like, you'll have leftovers for at least 2 days huge.  My roommate and I have been roommates for 4-5 years now off and on and she's one of my oldest friends in Austin.  Our relationship was based on a food foundation.  We used to meet up daily and just go to places that were on our respective checklists.  We used to come here now and again and just last year around Christmas, I said ""Hey, we should go to dinner as a Christmas gift to you.  You pick.""  Her response was ""Cheesecake Factory!"".  It definitely holds nostalgia for us. Well, our Christmas dinner eventually turned into my birthday dinner this year.  So like the menu, this place is MASSIVE.  It's like a bigger, nicer, more upscale Chili's.  The food though, the food is always superb.  The cheesecakes are also massive, the selection is way huge and they're also delicious.  Having worked in the hotel industry for most of my adult life, the food always reminds me of really well done banquet food.  I can go on and on about this place and it'll always come back to this, the food is tasty, the portions are huge and more than likely whatever you eat is gonna be really bad for you.  Really bad for you but usually, delicious food is."
Erica G.,"Austin, TX",20,10,,1.0,6/11/2016,"The food is horrendous. No seasoning at all. I ordered the fish and chips and I bit into a fried ball of oil. Disgusting! They bring me another plate and it is equally as disgusting.  I didn't want to argue, but then  I get charged $20 for the ball of lard I just ate. I thought they prided themselves on their food but apparently not. Will never be back again."
