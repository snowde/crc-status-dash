Nicki D.,"Round Rock, TX",276,426,1167,4.0,7/15/2014,"I wish I was able to have sat down and had a bite or 4 to eat last night, but it was late and I was just craving good ol cheesecake. And that, I got! Two pieces actually, woop-woop.  The cute blonde girl with the cool nails (she noticed my flashy nails too) was very helpful, and that girl knew her damn cakes!! She could tell me everything about every one in the case and did just that, with a smile and no reservations. She was definitely the person a business wants greeting customers.  $16 and two pieces of cheese cake later, it was mission complete! I bought the Snickers cheese cake and the Oreo cheese cake. Both about 4 feet deep, and Im sure loaded with 7,000 calories, but FTS, who eats cheese cake with the intent to monitor consumption?! I can't wait to get home from work to go dig back into some leftovers!  I did browse the menu, and while they are a bit pricey, they have a delicious looking menu!! I will be back for some food."
Sanoj N.,"Dallas, TX",1,17,3,1.0,1/1/2016,"BEWARE! Service is horrible. Different people showed up every time to take order. Not gonna go over what I ordered because it wasn't great anyway. However, I did find a large plastic cover in my pasta and the manager responded as if it was pretty common in there."
Shannon S.,"Irving, TX",52,165,187,3.0,7/27/2015,The service here was absolutely awesome. My waiter made sure my drink was always filled and he paid special attention to my food order. Based upon his service I would give this place a 4 star. Unfortunately though my food wasn't as great. I ordered the app fried zucchini which was pretty tasty and I also orders the app nachos. The nacho chips were super burnt and you could tell they were microwaved. Needless to say I left more then 3/4 at the able and just drank sangrias.
Lino F.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/29/2017,"This one of my favorite restaurants in austin, and have been coming here for years. The one time my son asks to come here I have the worst experience. We were seated promptly, and that was the last of the service. We sat at our table for 10 min and had at least 3 servers walk around us at least 4 times. No one took the time to even say hi or ask for our drink order. Very disappointed, we walked out. The only reason they noticed us is because I took the time to tell them no one had served us."
Beverly C.,"Hutto, TX",1,8,3,1.0,1/28/2017,"Service is extremely slow. Overpriced for what is delivered. Took 1.5 hours to be seated, 30 minutes to get each drink, and 1 hour for food. Ordered patron shots and it cost more than ultimate margarita with 2 shots alcohol.  Asked waitress who claimed to asked manager And said yes, it is $12.50 a shot. Won't come back."
Kev M.,"Austin, TX",7,33,,3.0,6/21/2016,The food is good not amazing. Prices are reasonable only because their portions are super large. Splitting and entrée and a salad is filling enough. Skip apps. which seems to be their claim to fame. The server is always great and wait times are reasonable. I frankly only go because my family really likes this place.
T B.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/11/2017,Worst experience in my 49 years. I am a loyal Cheesecake Factory patron in the North Dallas area and was visiting Austin for a rugby tournament. Saw there was a restaurant nearby and had to go. My daughter and I sat down outside at 5:00 pm. No wait. It was busy but not packed. We waited 10/15 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge us. Brought sodas and bread. No plates or napkins so I take them from a table next to us. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and my daughter orders a kids alfredo. We waited a good 20 minutes. My food comes out but we had to wait another 10 minutes for my daughters. I don't know how someone can ruin spaghetti and meatballs but it was horrible. Very dry pasta and the meatballs were dry too. Not enough sauce. Horrible. The WORST I have ever had.  Avoid this location. A letter will be written to corporate.
Antoinette G.,"Austin, TX",427,244,2,2.0,8/14/2015,"Overpriced chain restaurant. We hadn't been here in years, and decided to give it a try. When we walked up to the hostess stand, the hostess was having a conversation with a server, and totally ignored us until I asked my husband, ""Has she not even greeted you?"" She heard me and apologized, and then gave us her attention. Once seated, our server was prompt but just did the minimum. It was all about turning tables. We got the BBQ Chicken salads which were plentiful but just okay--certainly not worth the $14.95 price. We were out of there in 45 minutes, and that's with taking our time eating. Not a leisurely evening at all."
Tiffany W.,"Austin, TX",8,19,7,5.0,1/24/2015,"How does this place not have a 5 star review?  I love coming here with a big group because they literally have EVERYTHING you could think of to eat! Everyone is going to be happy and will definitely find what they're craving.  The customer service is great, even better in the bar area. Maybe I'm more partial to the bar area though because you get seated faster and they don't stop by your table constantly. The drinks are something to get excited over too! Not too sure if they have a happy hour, but a few cocktails at full price won't hurt! :) My favorites are: avocado egg rolls, pretty much everything off their skinny menu (they have drinks on here too!), orange chicken, chicken critters, their southwest style egg rolls, and the chocolate chip cookie dough CHEESECAKE! Enjoy my friends!"
Amy A.,"Grapevine, TX",0,41,1,1.0,5/28/2016,"We ordered a second drink from the bar at the same time we ordered our dinner. The dinner came out first... By a lot. The place wasn't crowded, and we were told the bartender got behind. Hey, Management: Don't cut your bar staff so early if one bartender can't cut it. Our piece of Linda's Fudge Cake came out half the size it's been the hundred times (WISH I was exaggerating) we've ordered it before. Asked our server, he agreed, and took it back only to return with a smaller piece. He said: No, it's the correct size. Um, so the last hundred times we were over served??? We think not. We won't be returning to this location, and after being jipped on the cake and given an even smaller piece (who does that?!), we'll think about all other dining options first."
Lovelys P.,"Austin, TX",326,39,81,3.0,9/29/2015,"Although I don't regularly go to The Cheesecake Factory, its proximity to Barnes and Noble keeps it in my radar.   Two obvious observations of TCF, the portions are huge and the cost is more expensive than you would expect. TCF has an overwhelming variety of sandwiches, salads, entrees and desserts. Narrowing down your choices can be a task in and of itself so consider looking at the menu on-line ahead of time. As you order, remember my first observation and consider sharing with a companion or plan on eating the leftovers for lunch.  As far as taste goes, I'm assuming that because TCF tries to cater to every taste, many of the entrees labeled ""spicy"" are simply not spicy. I recommend sticking to simpler selections like sandwiches and save room for sharing a dessert."
Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",223,89,158,5.0,9/19/2015,What more can you say it's Cheesesteak Factory! It's located at The Arboretum. It was very crowded when we came tonight but was seated in a timely fashion with a party if 5. Our waitress was  very attentive. She made sure our glasses stayed filled. Our orders came out correct & hot. Staff was very professional & courteous. I would definitely eat here again.
Jackie J.,"Ben Wheeler, TX",1,36,47,4.0,7/5/2016,Kale salad and broccoli were excellent. Shrimp pasta was ok. Wait time was long-30 minutes waiting and it wasn't busy. Restaurant was pretty inside and waiter was friendly-Kevin.
Ven S.,"Austin, TX",2,24,32,1.0,2/7/2016,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory quite regularly. Between taking visiting family and friends there or just going for dinner, we were there once every 3 weeks at least. Most of our experiences thus far have been positive. Food and beverage is pretty tasty albeit quite mainstream to appeal to ""the masses."" The only complaint I ever had till tonight was the long wait on busy nights, and that is expected and never warrants a negative review. However, tonight was a different experience. We met two of our close friends for dinner there tonight, and took our 2 month old baby too. We got our apps, and beverages ordered with our server - Cassidy. I ordered a Pineapple Moscow Mule. The apps showed up and my drink came too. However, amidst being engrossed in conversation with our friends and sampling the appetizer, I didn't notice for a few sips that I had the wrong beverage. After more than half the drink was gone (not more than 3 sips with the amount of ice these drinks have), I noticed that my drink was extremely sweet and full of mint leaves, and did not taste of vodka at all. Tasted more like rum (mojito). I told our waitress that although my drink was delicious, it couldn't possibly be a mule (even with it being pineapple flavored) and if she could possibly check with the bartender about it. She returned saying that the bartender had made an error and made a pineapple mojito instead of the ordered pineapple Mule. She asked me if I would like to keep the same drink or have her make the correct drink. I requested for the correct beverage to be made. The correct drink arrived and it was admittedly quite delicious. We continued with our meal and got 4 entrees at our table as well. After hearty laughs and chatting, and boxing our left overs, we requested checks. When the check arrived, I noticed that our check had 2 Pineapple Moscow Mule's on it. (I just had the one). This is where it went down hill. I asked for the waitress and asked her if there was an error, since they had brought me the wrong beverage and I only had 1 of the Mule. She was being very nice and apologetic and told me she would have to call her manager since she was under 21 and couldn't tell the drink was incorrect when she served it (not sure that is a valid excuse either). Up walks the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. This gentleman shouldn't be even washing dishes or busing dirty tables, let alone be in charge of managing anything with patrons. He walked up to the table and almost rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I explained to him that my beverage had been prepared incorrectly and that the waitress and bartender agreed that they had made the wrong drink and replaced it with the correct one, and that I somehow had been billed twice. This is where it gets simply unbelievable. He says ""But did you drink the first drink?"" I explained that I had taken a few sips of it since I was preoccupied before realizing it was wrong. He said ""You drank too much of that drink for me to be able to comp it."" I informed him that both, his waitress and his bartender had agreed to the error of preparing the incorrect drink. To this he snapped back to me ""You drank the drink, didn't you?"" He then said he would fix the price of one of the Mule's to that of a Mojito and that it would reduce my bill by 50 cents or so. I could not believable what I was hearing. The funny part is that it isn't even that $9 that the beverage cost that I was unhappy about. It is the way this manager of a higher-end chain handled such a petty issue with rudeness and talking down to a patron that really rubbed me the wrong way. At this point I told him that I no longer required his help and paid off the bill as is. Needless to say, there was no tip left on this bill. My wife and I will never go to this or any other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe (same ownership). Our friends who accompanied us tonight also left with a bitter taste in their mouth and will no longer frequent this establishment either. Cheesecake factory had provided us with a reasonable and tasty dining option thus far, and hired what seemed like good staff from all our experience till today. However, like it is said too often ""All it takes is one."" This one rotten apple was the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. The waitress Cassidy was being extremely apologetic when I asked for her name and the manager's name. She said if it was up to her, she would have comped the drink since it was her error. She repeated that since she was newer and under 21, she didn't have the required authority to modify alcoholic beverage orders. We have returned home with a bitter taste in our mouths, and this review is what has resulted of it. Sorry Cheesecake Factory - you need to do a better job of training your managers in customer relationship management - at least this one!"
Frank A.,"Georgetown, TX",3,63,74,5.0,8/13/2015,"Daughter's burger didn't come out well done but it was fine. Enjoyed the spacious table we were given and the professional staff. Food was excellent, the best out of our meals was the orange chicken."
Xinjie H.,"Austin, TX",45,63,94,2.0,7/31/2015,"This use to my go to spot that I would rate 5 stars. I would come here at least 4 times a month with friends. However, it has been going downhill and I don't think I would be coming back here anymore. Maybe the new location but it has been so disappointing with this location.  Last month I came here, I ordered black peppered Jamaican shrimp. The rice was disgusting, it was so crunchy.... Obviously we all know rice isn't suppose to be dry and crunchy especially since this was one of my favorite entree. The shrimp was super small.... Not worth it. This month I came here for dinner and got my other favorite chipotle pasta. We didn't receive any bread from the start but that's fine. It's just bread. They forgot the chicken and realized that they gave me the wrong vegetarian dish instead of the normal dish. Which is okay. When I received the chipotle pasta, the size of it was smaller than lunch portion. It was like 10 bites max and 5 small pieces of chicken. The plate is big... Sure but not the dish itself. As a usual fan of chipotle pasta, I know what their size is suppose to be. I've been coming to this place for years now ordering the same entrees. And their quality, service, and quantity has gone done. The dishes that are small now and the food quality is not worth mentioning. The only that has increased is their price... Ha.ha.I'm sooooo disappointed."
Devin H.,"Austin, TX",49,69,4,2.0,11/10/2016,"I went in there today to pick up a company lunch on an order I called in yesterday and placed with Nayeli. When I arrived Nayeli told me that the kitchen staff ""lost the paper with my order"" but it would be ready in 10 minutes (yea right). I said a phone call would have been awesome. I arrived at 11a which was the promised pick up time and walked out at 11:40a causing my 11:30 meeting to be late. What I encountered when I was there was inefficient, untrained staff that need better skills. In addition one of the items on my receipt was left off so I had to get that added, then again when they charged me the wrong price for a lunch item which they rang up as a dinner item, then once again to get lemon wedges that they kept forgetting after asking numerous times (and forgot to put in my bag so I had to grab the container sitting in a separate area myself). Throw in the fact that she said ""do you need forks and napkins"" with my 10 meal order and it's almost comical. Through all of this I was offered a canned apology and not even any $ off my order- I won't do it again."
Shawn E.,"Hutto, TX",1,8,2,5.0,6/20/2016,Had a great father's day meal with my daughter and wife. Our server Aaron was awsome. Portions were huge and the deserts are incredible!
Alicja A.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,6,4,5.0,10/9/2015,I love The Cheese Cake Factory! This location was perfect! The food was delicious and yummy! Our waiter was amazing! It's expensive but so worth it! We will be back soon! I also had the tiramisu cheese cake so so good! Oh and the calamari delicious! I can go on and on haha!
Marcell H.,"Austin, TX",177,2,,1.0,4/3/2015,"I am one of the regulars here, but lately they always just been putting me on hold indefinitely when I want to order something to go or for a pickup. Please be professional.  This happened at least 5-6 times already and I love your food but if you going to keep treating customers like this there are better place for me to go where I actually get service."
