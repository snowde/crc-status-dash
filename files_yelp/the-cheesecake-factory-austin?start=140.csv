Ashley B.,"Austin, TX",403,136,381,4.0,5/21/2015,"We were seated in less than 10 minutes on a packed Sunday afternoon after church. First of all, the music they play overhead is awesome. Second, the staff is ridiculously friendly. Our server, Jamie, was beyond attentive and helpful. When we needed directions to the restroom, the manager was walking by and offered to walk us to them. How could anyone complain about service here?! It's hands down the best service we have had in the Austin area since we moved here. The avocado rolls were absolutely delicious. The guys loved the macaroni balls; they were not anything special for me. The fish tacos were okay. The batter is way to thick on the fish & a bit greasy. The carbonara was delicious. Our server was very accommodating & everything came out exactly as ordered. Pieces of dessert are HUGE! Outrageous cheesecake is a German chocolate cake lover's dream! Reese's peanut butter cup was great as well. Will definitely be back!"
Michael F.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,7,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in a while. I was totally surprised when I was turned away at the door, and was not welcome. I was a victim of discrimination, and I can tell you why. The the most law abiding Texans are License to Carry a handgun people. At the entrance, high and to the right, on a window at about seven to eight feet high (way above eye level, which I don't believe is legal anyway) I saw a TPC 30.06 and 30.07 sign, to keep LTC out. This of course only  tells criminals, that they have no one to fear, so if they want to, they can commit any violent crime they want. Since they break laws for a living, the sign is a joke to them. There was no armed security there either, which tells me Cheesecake management don't care about their employees, or customers and there families safety. This of course, leaves the Cheesecake Factory wide open for a lawsuit for not having adequate security and not allowing for customers or staff to protect themselves. Therefore I cannot recommend this restaurant, for it's dangerous and discriminatory practices. Take your business elsewhere."
Gary H.,"Harker Heights, TX",0,8,3,5.0,6/5/2016,Such a great atmosphere. This is the second time I've visited this location. The food is absolutely to die for. Service seems like it could be faster but this certainly isn't fast food so I digress. First visit I had the chicken piccata. It was amazing. This last visit I tried out the chicken Marsala and it was really good. The portion was so big I actually have enough for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely be bring my family back.
Lily W.,"San Diego, CA",190,222,112,4.0,2/14/2014,"Come here on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday because that's when our server Janelle works! She's awesome! Cheesecake Factory is one of those strangely elusive chain restaurants that holds a special place in my heart. I spent my teenage and college years in Michigan and surprisingly there is NO Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the state. Strange, because Troy, MI (my hometown) is like the king of all large chain restaurants. Regardless, because of this cruel twist of faith that withheld Cheesecake Factory from my taste buds, I was determined to try it one day. I ended up trying it on a trip to Chicago and well, I didn't know what to order and was instantly overwhelmed by the monstrous menu. I remember the meal being decent, but somehow it didn't live up to my hope and dreams. Fast forward to two years later when I moved to Houston. I mentioned to my boyfriend at the time that I wasn't sure if I liked Cheesecake Factory and he insisted we go that day. I believe I got the Shrimp Etouffee and actually liked it. He got the Chicken Madeira which blew my Etouffee out of the water. I was sold. Since then I've gone to a few Cheesecake factories in various cities around the US. This location happens to be the only location in Austin. I like that it's almost always open until 11PM which is great for late night desserts! Most of the servers are pretty good but some standout ones are Natasha (I believe she introduces herself as 'Tashi), Tanner, and of course, as mentioned in my tip, Janelle.  I still go for the Chicken Madeira, but I've tried a few other items on the menu and have to admit that the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce wraps are pretty good too. I like the Upside-Down Pineapple Cheesecake and upon another Yelper's recommendation tried the Banana Creme Pie Cheesecake and they're my current favorites. Like I've mentioned in previous reviews, I like chain restaurants when I'm in doubt and looking for a halfway decent meal. They have standards.... that's got to count for something right?"
Ryan D.,"Austin, TX",720,63,6,3.0,6/29/2015,"Good food, bar serves up a wonderful piña colada. Service was fast and friendly.  Couple things I hated.  Loud depressing music Tacky decor. Awful faux paint scheme mixed with ugly Sante Fe style. Flat uncomfortable booths  Someone kept changing the brightness of the lights from too bright to too dark.  All the servers except ours looked miserable.  *****Cheese cake was the bomb.*******"
Dana H.,"Pflugerville, TX",134,7,1,2.0,6/2/2016,"I went to cheesecake factory last night and my server was Sid. The food was really good and of course the cheesecake was amazing  but our server was VERY inappropriate. He asked us if we wanted and box for the scraps for cheesecake and when we looked at him confused he said ""well I wasn't sure. Sometimes when I come home ""messed up""( he used a different word) I just need a little bite of something. Plus we watched him walk passed us MULTIPLE TIMES without even checking on us when we needed to order cheesecake that he told us to look at and waited on our bill for a very long time."
Raiyan A.,"Houston, TX",65,29,8,4.0,6/25/2015,"Great burger, I got Kobe one and it was amazing and cooked to my liking,  lunch specials were okay"
S L.,"Austin, TX",3,216,4,3.0,3/1/2015,"Went on a Sunday evening to use my gift card. There was a huge wait time, but I was able to get a quick seat at the bar. Service was good. Crab cakes were a little burnt and small. Shepherd's pie was delicious. Took a coffee cheese cake to go, and it was awesome. Overall, it was very expensive. I would go back if someone else really wanted to go. You are not missing much if you never come here."
Kelly T.,"Austin, TX",617,17,12,3.0,3/19/2016,"We have gone to this particular Cheesecake Factory since it opened. Mostly for birthdays and other special events.  I have seen it decline through the years. I understand this was the second weekend of spring break so we expected a long wait especially with SXSW also going on but...when we arrived we were told it was it would be 40 minutes  but we actually waited for over an hour (64 min) to be exact.  The wait is not the restaurants fault. I get it but, if we were told it was an hour we would not have stayed.  And due to the cool snap, there was pretty much wall to wall people in the entrance. Standing...for 64 minutes.... We had a variety of entrees from a club sandwich to sesame ginger chicken, the chicken was spicier than expected. The rest of the food we ordered was fairly expensive and pretty ordinary.   The waitress and hostesses were working their tails off, the kitchen was backed up (understandably. With that many people).   I am giving it 3 stars because the avocado egg roles as an appetizer and of course the cheesecake was really good."
Raymond S.,"Killeen, TX",0,34,25,5.0,4/9/2016,"I have never been disappointed at this Cheesecake factory. The service is almost excellent and the food is fantastic! Today we tried the Crispy Cuban Rolls, they were awesome. I really have authentic Cuban sandwiches and they were really close to the real thing but in a roll. We ended the meal with the Salted Carmel Cheesecake and it was also very very good. Great meal and great service."
David S.,"Ashaway, RI",47,83,6,3.0,6/7/2015,"The wait times are a bit long if you want a table.  However since this is a family restaurant, the bar usually has open seats and if you eat there, they will spread cloth napkins. The free bread is average to below average.  Not fresh, not sure if it's made on the premises.  It is a filler. Not sure what the exact name of the appetizer is, it is 2 Salmon wraps that were deep fried then cut diagnally to make ""4"" pieces served on a HUGE bowl filled with diced red lettuce.  Garnishment I understand but not really understanding this presentation. Since I was at the bar, service was immediate and my beer glass was never empty.  The bar staff is very responsive and friendly.  The people delivering the food are courteous and friendly as well. I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp and overall it is okay.  Most of their dishes seem very original, some updated Asian fusion dishes. The cheesecake was the highlight of the meal, obviously.  The key lime cheesecake was great. Although they only have 2 $'s on the rating should be 3 $'s.  Total bill for 2 people with a share appetizer and 3 drinks each, seperate entrees, 2 orders of cheese cake came out to $115, not including tip. The appearance of the place reminds me of mediterranean architecture with a lot of curves, gold/gilded color bases.  It looks pleasant. This place looks very clean.  The staff cleans up well.  Room between seats/tables are about average.  You don't feel packed but due to the layout, conversations carry so if you're looking to having a serious conversation, you would have to sit next to each other. Overall good dining experience.  Would go there again for the service and cheesecake, not sure about the meal itself."
L. W.,"Austin, TX",2,136,,1.0,11/24/2014,The finishout in this restaurant is really very nice and gives you a good feeling just being there. They clearly spared no expense..... The service is very bad however. They took a long time to seat us. The food takes forever to come out of kitchen. After waiting 30 minutes two people in our party were told they needed to change their order or it would add another 20 minutes to the already too long wait. We ordered cheesecake afterwards and that took 25 minutes. I tried to follow up with the server and then a manager and they really seemed dismissive. I really don't think it is the serve staff that is a problem but rather the kitchen and a corporate environment that really does not care about customer service anymore because they are always just too busy.  I will not go back.
Summer P.,"Austin, TX",29,117,34,3.0,4/10/2015,"Food review: My third time trying Cheesecake Factory tonight and it's still just a ""meh"" 3. Definitely not BAD. Just not great either. Everything tastes pretty generic. There is a huge menu though so if you're with a group there's something for everyone.  Cheesecake review: I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake tonight and it was very good. I would recommend it."
Rachel C.,"Austin, TX",1,8,,1.0,1/19/2016,Service was horrendous. We went as a group of 10 for a birthday party and 2 people received their meal 20 minutes before the rest of the table. Then 7 others finally received their meal while mine was still another 5 minutes away. We were offered no compensation and no apology. Just some BS excuse that the French fries were pushing everything back. Problem was- no one ordered anything with French fries!
Amiga A.,"Austin, TX",3,63,95,1.0,3/28/2017,"This is our third time here. We had great waiters two times. The third time we basically left very dissatisfied. He did not offer or ask for refills. Bread came in late. We are vegetarians and we know how to order veggies by substituting stuff. Our waiter was just rude period. No water refills. Had to wait for bread for real long and literally look at him while he was happy assisting other customers with their orders.. smiled elsewhere but just not us.. rude! I wish he could have done a better job assisting us... we used to do cheesecake for all our birthdays and I have proofs - came in here thrice. They got our appetizer order wrong btw and brought in a different sandwich, didn't even apologize and guess what he ended up charging us for the wrong order. I have the receipt for the charge. He came in after 5 min after we started talking about the bill and got it fixed.. we all left very disappointed ..."
Dulce S.,"Irvine, CA",26,11,,1.0,9/21/2016,"This is not a review of a dine in experience, this is for pick up orders. I called to order food for pick up, someone picked up right away but didn't take my order. I was transferred to the cashier who will take my order. I waited 7 mins, no one picked up. I got tired of waiting I just ordered at another place. The next day I called again to order, this time I waited 12 minutes ! Nobody picked up! I will never order from this place ever!"
Riley L.,"Denton, TX",128,176,58,4.0,11/2/2014,"Look, this is a Cheesecake Factory. They have great cheesecake and pretty good food in a formless, shapeless decor theme with a lot of divorced people getting engaged for a second time. That being said, this location is nice and clean and I've had a good experience with the waitstaff and everyone else I came in contact with. I've even used this spot for takeout and it was really fast and easy! So if you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory, this is one of them."
Sara O.,"Austin, TX",64,219,141,1.0,10/17/2013,"I'm wondering if I'm an idiot for even trying this place.  It's a huge chain, which is normally not my thing so maybe I got what I deserve. For $67 I wanted to scream at this meal.   I got the endive salad to start.  Blegh. I took the waiter's suggestion and got the salmon special.  I don't normally order salmon, but I'm trying to eat more fish.  So away I go.  I get it and don't love it.  I chalk that up to, maybe I don't really love salmon.  As I take a few more bites I don't think that it's cooked all the way.  BUT, I don't cook salmon so what the hell do I know.  I become paranoid and quit eating it.  It also just had this bizarre taste, I can only liken it to plastic.  It also had some sort of coconut sauce that the rice was in and that was really sweet and just not good to me. BF got roasted chicken which came with some veggies and mashed potatoes.  I ate his carrots and enjoyed them.  The potatoes also just had this bizarre taste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it wasn't good. Still a little hungry, and thinking, well we are at the Cheesecake Factory, let's get cheesecake, we get two desserts to go (I'm ready to go home). We got the classic, cheesecake with strawberries, and a piece of Tiramisu.  The cheesecake was rather soft, and had more of a sour taste to it than I am accustomed to.  It was topped with fresh strawberries, but they were in some sort of gross jelly.  The Tiramisu was pretty good. The price is what killed me, for a meal that wasn't good we spent seventy bucks. This is just food, no drinks.  Honestly we could have just gone to Taco Cabana and I think I would have been happier."
Amy T.,"Round Rock, TX",259,747,539,4.0,6/5/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is the kind of place you have to KNOW what to order. What they make that is good, is great, everything else seems like filler to be honest. When you have a menu that is that HUGE, its hard to be great at everything. . .and u know half or more cannot be fresh.  I ordered the tuna tartare the last 2 times I've been. Next time instead of an entrée I'm ordering 2 as my meal.  This last visit I ordered a margarita flat bread ...it was eh. . the tomatoes were cut to thick so that's all you tasted, tomato, and it still tasted raw to me, or undercooked.    The bf ordered the Navajo. no thanks, he said he'd never order that again. he said it was too big and difficult to eat. Next time he said he'd order chicken stuffed tortillas (basically quesadillas).  We shared the red velvet cheesecake. never disappoints, never gets old. THIS is what they make great, and they know it. why waste calories on food and alcohol when this is about all I've enjoyed from CF. Not the drinks, not the pasta (every dish I've gotten just wasn't good), not the salads (I love cobb salad but theirs is just lettuce it felt like).  And so to sum up, either or the tuna tartare, a pizza (the girl next to me had a pepperoni pizza that looked great. . .) or the cheesecake.  Another thing that surprises me is the amount of people that order their own slice of cheesecake, way too much food for you to finish (which they never do) next time order just one and share. . you'll appreciate each bite even more. . :)"
Tanya H.,"Liberty Hill, TX",0,12,,1.0,8/29/2015,Worst experience ever here.this was our first and last time to come here! We waited for an hr to get seated ..ok no big deal...my choice....when they finally seated us they sat us at a table that had been empty the in tire time we where waiting...ok ...we sit and wait another 15 min to order our drinks....ordered our appetizer and our entries. ...appetizer came.. it was good.(calamari )..this was the best part of the whole night...salads came they were very gritty...the lettuce was not washed and full of dirt...didn't eat that. . the waitress then comes back says oh by the way we are out of both the plates you ordered ....so we had to look for something else....finely decided waited 20 more min. Til the waitress came back.... .waited 2hrs...yes 2 hrs  for the food to came out...one was burnt (kids pizza)....one was fine it was kids spaghetti. ..one $22.00 steak was over cooked the shrimp was not cleaned and had the digestive tract hanging out of it...the other $22.00 plate was over cooked also...told the manager at this point and she said oh I'll get you a new one...by this time I was done and wanted out of this place...we got to leave 3 1/2 hours after we were seated. And then was handed a bill for $60.00...they took one plate off... (nobody got to eat other then 1 kid) when I said something to the manager about it she said oh well I guess I came take something else off...a different manager came over with a $40.00 bill ..I didn't care at this point but I did let the manager know I would NEVER COME BACK and I would be yelping them. They didn't care.  Unfortunately we didn't even get to order any dessert. .cuz well we didn't even get to eat! The funny thing is I was looking at booking a catering job with them for work. I had heard it was the best place to eat.  Not even close! I'm so glad I tried this place before I booked a catering job for 450 people.
