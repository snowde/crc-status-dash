Eddie G.,"Austin, TX",1,130,110,4.0,2/14/2015,"Love this place...can't get enough!! Ill start with the bad: waitress kind of sucked...she seemed really stressed out and unsure of what was going on.  When sheds bring us stuff that we asked for she would sometimes just toss it on the table and then seemed agitated when we asked for something else or a refill on drinks.  Now the good stuff:  Everytime I  have been it has not disappointed me.   I usually try something new everytime I go and  so  far they all have pretty good.   Meal portions are usually big and will leave plenty full, just make sure to leave some room for their awesome cheesecakes!!  You can't go to a place called cheesecake factory without trying the cheesecake!!  The snickers cheesecake is one of the best but there are plenty more that will have you making a tough decision.  Enjoy!"
Lee H.,"Austin, TX",2,12,18,2.0,10/11/2014,"Hello Cheesecake Factory staff, The food is good, the cheesecake is awesome - BUT PLEASE WORK ON YOUR WAIT STAFF!!! The time it takes to get your order taken and moving from appetizer, thru main course onto dessert takes too DANG LONG!  This leads to the long wait time not to mention the noise in the restaurant is disturbing to the point you have to raise your voice at your table to have a conversation."
Isaac E.,"North York, Canada",153,293,4,3.0,12/27/2013,The Cheesecake factory seems to be the same wherever you go across the United States. The menu does vary from location to location so what I can only judge this place off is the service and difference in the menu from what I've had in the past. The service was kind of all over the place for when I ate here. Our server was knowledgeable of the menu and what the menu items contained and was able to help us choose what we wanted for our meal (By the way if the Tomales are on the menu....order them!). But then service got slow after our appetizers and there was some confusion on what we ordered as well which backed a lot up in the long run. Otherwise I'd say it was a successful trip out to the Cheesecake Factory. I'll never say no to going here....ever.
Beck W.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,4.0,3/20/2016,Best cheesecake ever. I love their burgers and the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great. It looks fancy but you don't have to wait until 1 in the morning to get in. No reservation needed (usually).
Sandy C.,"Weir, TX",0,6,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Ate here today and it was by far the WORST service we have ever experienced here. Waited over an hour for our food and when it came out the kids meal was cold. Instead of them bringing it out first they held it waiting on the rest of the food to come out. People at tables all around us were complaining of their service as well. The food is always excellent but the poor service and long wait for food with no explanation is ridiculous. We waited over 20 minutes just to get bread. I'm sorry to say that I will think twice before I go spend $100 plus on a meal if the service is going to be like this. If their is an issue in the kitchen, the manager needs to be explaining this to people instead of just leaving to wait forever on their food."
Kirsten H.,"Cedar Park, TX",2,52,5,5.0,2/8/2016,My best friend of over 20 years took me to lunch for my birthday - great salads and fantastic cheesecake for dessert!!
Sharon C.,"Austin, TX",10,68,1,1.0,11/4/2014,"Went for the first time last night and...it just wasn't good. At all. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip, which tasted like hot tuna salad. I don't know if the crab was off or it's just that awful a dish, but we each tried a couple spoonfuls of it and then ignored it in favor of the bread. My girlfriend got Evelyn's Pasta, which wasn't bad...in the middle. There was a huge ring of inedible pasta that had dried up from sitting under a heat lamp. I got the meatloaf. It was a different flavor than I was expecting, but okay. Then I noticed that the grilled onions in sauce (that was all over the meatloaf) had lots of inedible onion peel. So I decided to eat my sauteed spinach instead but it was so loaded down with pepper that I couldn't eat it. It wasn't ""spicy,"" it was as if the top had flown off a pepper shaker and accidentally dumped 5 tablespoons into it. We left and ended up at home eating PB&J two hours later. This was possibly the worst meal I've had in a long time."
Mr W.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2014,"The fish n' chips was discuting and super hiper expensive 20.00, I couldn't believe the fish was pretty nasty, cause I paid 20 dollars for shit 'n crap. My mom ordered the chicken sandwich which was flavorless and nasty, she also ordered a slice of pie and it wasn't good at all I felt pretty disappointed about that cause I really wanted to take my mom somewhere with a delicious food and a fancy place cause we were celebrating her birthday and she's now 90 years old.  My son ordered a slice of pie but it wasnt good and  milkshake that was just okay. Mi lil son ordered two pumpkin pie slices and they were delicious. The pumpkin pie was the only thing that was good.  I paid 89 dollars plus tip. This is probably the worst restaurant in the universe"
Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14,3.0,12/4/2014,"Eh... Now I remember why I don't go here....  I apparently ordered the wrong thing... I ordered fried shrimp but I should have known they'd be of the frozen variety.  $$$$ too, not worth it at all.  The cheesecake was great, so I'd come here just for that."
Brian M.,"Austin, TX",48,91,2,4.0,7/3/2013,"Ok, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain but I lean on it because it is consistent and I know I am not going to leave hungry. We had a great experience and service was both funny and attentive. She got my Martini spot on and even teased me because I wanted shredded Parmesan on my broccoli (don't judge me). The food was standard Cheesecake Factory fare but the service was great and I love how huge the restaurant is. Yes the desserts are pricey and I was thrown that my Martini cost as much as my entree but hey, life is short.  Too bad the patio has a gorgeous view of a concrete parking lot but thats life. We go for the Chocolate truffle cake with the mousse over the cheesecake which wins hands down anyday."
John R.,"Pocahontas, AR",316,319,596,2.0,7/19/2014,"I have a long and storied past with The Cheesecake Factory. I used to work right next door and ordered meals from them frequently. They gave me so much free bread. And the portions they offer? Legendary.  This particular visit was my first post-hospital-solid-foods-experiment. I kiiiiiiiiind of managed.  I ate two chicken strips and a few bites of succotash. A few things I noted: the bread came AFTER we ordered our meals, whereas it used to come pretty freely before. The noise isn't as loud anymore. I don't know if they've turned down the music or if I just came at the ""right time."" The service is more on point than I've ever seen it in terms of timeliness, but not in terms of consideration. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. What pulled pork they had was not up to par and the manager came out to apologize. She asked if there was something else he wanted and also brought out his side order of sweet potato fries. I may be obnoxious (okay, fine, whatever, call me obnoxious) but when his re-order came out without a side, I thought that was a little tacky. You've inconvenienced a customer and your consolation is something that they're having to pay for already and you're not replacing it with anything or comping the bill at all? Call me a product of modern society, but there's something called ""going the extra mile"" and they certainly did not in this situation.  My cajun chicken strips were mildly spiced. I get that you're operating for the masses, but just call them chicken strips. There's nothing cajun about them, even if they are still appetizing. I get that they're in a location that's on the decline, but if they're giving up to this degree? I don't need to return, and nor do you need to visit."
Kristi R.,"Round Rock, TX",116,102,28,4.0,9/4/2014,"I don't usually do reviews on chain restaurants bc they are typically the same but bc of the awesome service we received last night I felt the need to give credit where due.  We went early bc we were celebrating my birthday with our 4 young children. Our waitress, Kyla promptly acknowledges us and brings a plate of sliced bananas for our 2 yr old. She was so friendly to our kids, attentive and down right made the special event even more special. We don't usually do ""fancy"" restaurants with the kids but bc of the occasion we were all dressed up and excited for our night out. Meal was terrific just as always. Chicken Madeira, Chris' outrageous chocolate cake. Kids had sliders off the half priced appetizer menu. Thank you for making our special night  even more special, Kyla."
Blythe A.,"Austin, TX",46,46,40,1.0,10/5/2014,Went to purchase 3 slices of cheesecake took 24 mins with 3 people  in the line In front of me. it was 4-5 people behind the counter just running around. not a good look especially for $7.50 a slice. service was just poor.
Cristy R.,"Austin, TX",2,11,10,5.0,7/8/2016,"Love, love, love, love, love the honey oat bread they serve! In case you didn't know ... they actually sell the baguette for only $3.80! Yes I know amazing deal!!!"
Jane M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,30,,3.0,8/27/2016,"I like the food but every time I eat here I get sick. It's normally a stomach ache and ends with well out the other end. I don't know what they put in their dishes but it's probably the preservatives I'm assuming. If you've got a sensitive stomach, I'd avoid this place by all costs. Even the cheesecake makes me sick..."
Steff S.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/27/2016,Wow! The bartender is stuffing her face behind the bar!!! I guess she doesn't get a dinner break. We kinda lost our appetite ~
Lindsey B.,"Austin, TX",1,69,3,1.0,1/15/2016,"While I have had several good experiences at this location, my last visit was atrocious.  1) we were sat at the smallest booth in the history of mankind. (and we weren't asked whether we would like to wait longer for a larger booth). Those small tables are NOT big enough for 2 people. THEY ARE A ONE PERSON TABLE. But lets be honest this isn't even the beginning. 2) Ordered the sliders and they came with ketchup on them. I don't know ANY nice sit down restaurant that ever put ketchup on its burgers. In my opinion it's basically a Mcdonald burger at the point. While it did say that it came with Ketchup on the menu, I just assumed it would come on the side like EVERY other single sit down restaurant. Lol. But I assumed wrong. Well then when I noticed there was ketchup on my sliders, I tried to get the waiter. He had disappeared completely. Well then when I finally tracked him down, he didn't want to let us send them back and get something else. He then suggested we order a kids slider plate. So I did and then the burgers came out and the buns felt like they had just been pulled out of the microwave - you know like those white castle burgers you heat up in the microwave. That's what they tired to served me. So on the 3rd round my food was finally right.....We thought that would the end of the terrible dinner... But no... 3) We get our check and review it and the waiter goes to run it. It comes back with a bill for like $20-30 more. He had ran our card on a higher bill.... Not sure if it was mistake or not....  Needless to say, we will NOT be back."
Scott F.,"Round Rock, TX",1,12,5,2.0,2/19/2015,in need of major improvement :( We love this place typically and in most cities as well. Very disappointed. Wait staff was good but food was not
Shonel G.,"Austin, TX",192,236,2529,3.0,1/21/2013,The best thing on the menu is the cheesecake. Most of the other menu options are large but the one thing I think people over look is the great drink menu.
lea c.,"Austin, TX",110,330,405,2.0,8/3/2015,"Soooooooo my hubby had the bright idea to go to this spot for the day after national cheesecake day (the day after). Get there at 10pm, late I know. Lines are crazy long. we get in line just for cheesecake and put our name down for a table. which ever comes first. AWESOME, we get a table first. as we wait for our waiter we get hungry, so we are here for food and cheesecake now. ok, our waiter comes, cool guy does his utmost to accommodate us. we order drinks, mostly waters, I ask for lemon (they are out of lemons) so he brings limes. Cool. we ask for comp bread and butter (waiter says they are out of bread and butter). so I order nachos so we can snack on something before our cheesecake comes. (avg 20min wait time) I ask the waiter to comp out nachos, he comes back with bread but still out of butter. lol. SMH. waiter is tired I know and really apologetic. NICE GUY. we order cheesecake, he warns us they are out of 5 diff types. they were extra busy today I understand but out of butter? lemons? out of cheesecake and you are the cheesecake factory????????????? we get our cheesecake we order and I got the red velvet (deeeeeeeeeeeeeelish) the waiter apologizes again we tip and leave. not sure how I feel about the cheesecake factory right now. lol"
