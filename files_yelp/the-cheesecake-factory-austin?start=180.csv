Jerry E.,"Austin, TX",313,409,170,5.0,6/23/2013,"BOOM goes the Cheesecake!!  Went for the 1st time ever last night....ordered a Jameson on the rocks, the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip appetizer and headed Straight for the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake! B DAMN Son, talk about Tastebud Explosion! Everything was Delicious. The waitress Tashi was Excellent, she really knew her stuff and very friendly!  I can't wait to go back and try something new!"
David K.,"San Diego, CA",27,104,8,2.0,7/12/2014,"Why even bother reviewing the CF? You know the drill. Huge menu, massive incredibly caloric portions, usually good attentive staff and sometimes a huge wait to experience all the above. I always try to avoid chains but it's simply not possible while staying at the Arboretum area in Austin.  My beef with this place was not due to beef. No, it was around chicken. Specifically that I ordered a $7 pretzel chicken app. It never arrived and about 10 minutes later, an ashen-faced manager arrived, apologized, and told me the kitchen had ruined it and it was the last one they had. This, after telling me it's a ""scratch kitchen."" If that is the case, shouldn't they be able to re-create it using fresh ingredients? I chose another app, the crabcakes, which were middling at best and twice the price. So when the bill came and I'd been charged for the pricier app, out came the Yelp app. Two stars."
Joseph A.,"Austin, TX",0,5,3,5.0,12/24/2015,"I eat here on a regular basis. I had a friend of mine invite me there once, then I fell in love with it. It is the only place I can eat a low carb sugar free cheesecake and eat a salad too. With my diabetes, it is hard to find a good place to eat and receive good service too."
Moira R.,"New Orleans, LA",91,181,20,2.0,5/3/2014,"The pros: They have a giant menu that should have something for everyone The cons: I'm pretty sure they are just re-heating frozen food I was in Austin for a conference and the other people in our group wanted to come here for dinner.  I knew we had some picky eaters so I didn't say anything.  I then proceeded to look for something that I thought might be okay.  I had a steak and salmon with asparagus.  It was okay, nothing special. I know a lot of people like the cheesecake, but I prefer a cheese cake that is baked, not set in the refrigerator... so their cheesecake always disappoints. I ordered a bowl of strawberries for dessert and I said yes to the whipped cream.  I don't know what that was, but I know what whipped cream tastes like and that was not it."
Emilie I.,"Austin, TX",4,43,,5.0,12/19/2015,"Food was great! Last time here I paid with credit card; and the waiter, John, stole my credit card number; this time, with cash!"
Catalina M.,"Round Rock, TX",163,183,80,3.0,3/3/2013,"Went here last night to celebrate my 21st birthday. Food was good, I had the mini crab bites and the crab artichoke dip as my meal, they were so good. I also had a side salad,The Caesar dressing here is saltier than I like, but not terrible. We had an appetizer of calamari and it was Devine. As for drinks, I had the Georgia peach. Sooo delicious! And the blueberry mojito was so flavorful. I had the key lime cheesecake for dessert and it was a little slice of heaven.  The service was very slow. Our waiters kept forgetting to put in items we ordered, refills never came, and she didn't really come around often at all."
Quiya S.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,4.0,8/7/2016,I love their cheesecakes! The food is good and the prices aren't too high. They are one of my favorite restaurants.
Fizza S.,"Round Rock, TX",87,260,12,3.0,7/28/2014,I was really disappointed with this location. We were a big party and the service was very accommodating and friendly but the food was nothing great. We had a preset menu and I ordered the fettuccine alfredo- it was way too heavy and made me feel a little sick afterwards. I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake too. Most days I can swear by this flavor but this time around I didn't even like the cheesecake. I don't know if it was an odd day or just me but I was really disappointed. An extra star for the bread- it was amazing.
M S.,"Austin, TX",13,5,,1.0,7/23/2016,"Betty R was not a good server tonight. Besides seeming like she didn't want to help us, she spilled a beer on one of us and rarely checked on our table. Additionally our birthday girl had to send her meal back. Pretty sure the AC didn't work and we had to ask more than once for our drinks. 7/23/16"
Annie D.,"Austin, TX",3,18,,3.0,11/13/2014,"My husband really enjoys the cheesecake factory and he always drags me here. I've noticed a change lately, I thought I would post about. The first several times I went to this restaurant I was so impressed by their service that I told one of the servers, ""we never, ever get bad service when we come here."" He told us that the training for servers there was very stringent and they had extremely high standards for who they hired. I really thought it showed. But the last probably three or four times we've gone, we've had experiences that fall almost on the opposite end of the spectrum. It takes so long to get greeted by your server, get your drinks/bread, be asked for your order, etc. Then at the end of the meal, it's the norm to have your server ignore you, seemingly forget about you, and/or completely disappear. I can't stand going to restaurants where you have to wait forever for your check. It feels like they're holding me hostage long after I did what I came to do, which is eat food. Yes, I like sitting and visiting at a restaurant, but I would rather do it out of my own free will and not because the server forgot about me or doesn't care. It's really sad because it didn't used to be this way but something must have changed with their hiring process or training. Either that or they've gone the way of many other businesses and don't have enough people staffed at the right times. It bums me out too because I do think their food is almost always good and I really really really like cheesecake."
Ashley A.,"Austin, TX",245,6,5,1.0,7/20/2016,"Went here for a friends birthday, she had talked to a manager earlier in the day and he told her to show up early to get a table for a large party. They tried saying they wouldn't seat our party until the full party was there. It took 20 minutes just to receive our water we had requested and then another 10 minutes for our cocktails. We were there an hour before they took our food order and then another hour before our food came out. My boyfriends steak was well done when he ordered medium rare so everyone was finished eating by the time we got our food. Their solution was 6 free slices of cheesecake and taking off the steak. When the cheesecake came out, our table was still full of empty plates so I asked the waiter to please pre us the table and his response was 'I'll pre us when I have an empty hand' no clean plates or silverware or a clean table to eat our desert. Definitely won't be back, especially with a big group"
Rob L.,"Austin, TX",0,12,,1.0,7/16/2016,"30.06 alert. Well, i DID like the cheesecake factory, but no more. They do not respect my right to conceal carry and will not get my business. One star as I can't give zero."
Sateevia W.,"Austin, TX",0,33,,3.0,7/16/2016,"Expensive place. Honestly I've had better cheesecake and it was small and expensive. The food was okay, I was disappointed."
Amanda W.,"Austin, TX",133,315,297,3.0,8/13/2014,Cheese cake factory is always super duper packed. Im reluctant to go to cheesecake factory a lot because it's so fattening. But for reals! It should be called cheesecake fattery. The salads taste bad so don't even suggest that to me. I always order the angel hair spaghetti with meat sauce which is pretty good just lots of butter. The free bread is yummy and sweet and the inside of the place is beautiful. The minuses are that there's no reservations and sometimes it gets pretty pricey. But if youre looking to eat cheesecake try the tuxedo one. Sometimes i go  just to pick up a slice of tuxedo cake.
Robert T.,"Austin, TX",168,98,379,3.0,6/15/2014,"Oh Cheesecake Factory..  How I want to hate you.  From your Disney-inspired interior to your inept front counter help.  I want to hate you for apparently having your freezer three miles away and providing your staff a pogo stick on which to make the round trip journey.  But I can't hate you..  Your cheesecakes are too damn good!!  I love you Cheesecake Factory.  I love you, your white chocolate raspberry truffle, and your carrot cake cheesecake,!!"
Liza S.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,2.0,1/6/2016,"While the new location at Barton Creek Mall is nice and the staff is great. I was a bit disappointed that they were out of the 6"" cheesecake on Christmas Eve. You would think that is a high volume day to be geared up for but they only had the 7"" which was $12 more for not even a full slice more."
Misha S.,"Austin, TX",202,218,264,4.0,6/20/2012,"Is it bad that I really love the cheesecake factory? And by LOVE, i mean, I'll always, always go.  I Love their novel-of-a-menu, their amazing amount of choices, their perky waiters, and their somewhat silly/mish mash decor. I even love their mountain-sized servings!! This isn't a place where you get blown away by culinary creations (though you may be wowed by the amount of whipped cream they add to your cheesecakes!).  But its comfortable - I can bring all of my friends, we all find something we can like.  I guess the only thing keeping it away from 5 stars is that, individually looked at, the food isn't amazing. But its good, hearty, and consistent.  Also, Mmmm, cheesecake."
Michelle A.,"Austin, TX",60,91,666,5.0,7/22/2014,"went couple of years ago on national cheesecake day... saved my visit for any slice, half price. this year 2014, good for july 30th and 31st. dine in only, one slice per guest. enjoy!"
Krista M.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,12,,1.0,11/5/2015,Went for dinner with colleagues two of us had the chicken Madeira and got food poisoning.  We were in town for new hire training and had to miss two days. What a shame when our company had to pay for us fly  out hotel rooms and food. They did not really seem to care. Would not recommend this location

Now I k ow why the lighting is so dim, so you don't notice how trashy it really is.
