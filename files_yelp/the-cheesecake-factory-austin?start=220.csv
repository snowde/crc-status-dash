Mark P.,"College Station, TX",0,4,,2.0,5/14/2016,The service is great and the atmosphere is nice but the food quality and taste doesn't match the price.
Stephen S.,"Del Valle, TX",0,10,,1.0,9/11/2015,"Boy oh boy.. What can I say, umm the staff was slow and the food even slower! I took my girlfriend on a date and I figured what better place then the cheese cake factory but I was wrong! We waited about fifteen minutes to be seated which wasn't so bad but once we were seated it took about another ten minutes just to even be greeted by our waitress and then ten more minutes just to get drinks!   After we ordered we were expecting a wait but come on 45 minutes to bring two plates out is pretty ridiculous! There were people who ordered steak entrees that were seated next to us and still received their food faster then us and we had been there first!    I will never go back to this location ever! It is terrible."
Megan H.,"Austin, TX",134,228,125,5.0,4/6/2015,"I am going to give these guys 5 stars because I have never had a single issue and I have been coming here since we moved to Austin years ago. The food is always fantastic, we never have to wait too long (although you can always call ahead) and the service is always fantastic. My boyfriend and I usually split the crusted chicken Romano because it is plenty of food for two people and we always have left overs. I also highly recommend the fried mac-n-cheese, although I haven't gotten it in a long time because it is definitely an extra bunch of carbs I don't need ;) (but absolutely DELICIOUS carbs!) the Georgia peach is a great fruity drink, though a little pricey. To me it's worth it because I have not had another peach drink that I like as much as theirs, but to others $9+ might be a little much. I also LOVE the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, although many others look great I always stick to the same one because I know it will be good. All in all i can assure you you will have a great date night, we always do!"
tim b.,"Leander, TX",29,326,1,4.0,4/5/2015,"I enjoyed lunch with family visiting from out of town and the food was fresh, tasty and plentiful.  I like their lunch salads - which are still big enough for two.  My father ordered the marg pizza and then we shared half of each.  The pizza was a revelation.  My wifey ordered the Thai lettuce wraps.  I always like the flavored (but not sweetened) tea and the courtesy bread."
Rachel C.,"Austin, TX",31,19,,2.0,5/15/2015,Really mediocre.  When menus are that large that's usually a sign of mediocrity. Great service but with so many great choices in Austin with way better prices I find it strange that anyone should frequent a chain such as this. To each his own.
Thomas B.,"Austin, TX",1709,114,2051,3.0,8/22/2013,"I can't believe they took the ""Over the Top Meatloaf Sandwich"" off the menu.  It was one of the best and most unique sandwiches in town.  What did they replace it with?  ""The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich.""  'Nuff said."
John W.,"The Woodlands, TX",55,160,71,1.0,11/11/2013,"Very disappointed with the take out person this past weekend. I called in to get a blue cheese blt burger (the only thing that really sounded good to me - been craving it for a while), which they apparently no longer have on the menu. I attempted to ask if they could just get a bacon burger and add blue cheese (clearly they have bacon and blue cheese there) - I would have paid any up charge for this - but before I could suggest this, I was repeatedly told they don't have it. The person on the other line seemed rude and was less than interested in taking my order... So I promptly ended the phone call. Very disappointed. I realize this was a Saturday night, but it was about 9:30 pm (or a little after) and not during the rush. I guess I was expecting too much - I previously worked in a restaurant where the motto was ""the answer is yes - what is the question?"" Guess I shouldn't expect wonders from a chain, but I expected more from TCF. I won't be back to this location."
Mo S.,"Austin, TX",121,6,1,4.0,5/25/2015,Great service.  Can work on the steaks but man that avocado roll!! Can't go wrong w that one...
Mark R.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,1.0,7/25/2015,"Showed up at 11:00 when they opened on the beautiful part of a Saturday before the 100 degree heat was going to hit in the afternoon. They refused to seat us  on their outdoor patio stating it wasn't opened until some time later "" maybe noon"". Why have a patio and refuse to serve on it during the only practical part of the day ? I suspect this location has little or weak management.  We left and had a beautiful lunch in the Brio Patio. We won't be back to the Cheesecake Factory."
Tiffany W.,"San Francisco, CA",290,204,103,3.0,5/18/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is like the maintenance guy you hire to do your plumbing, rewire your house, fix the shingles on the roof, do some landscaping in the front yard, repair the A/C, and put in the tile. He's able to do a lot, but isn't especially good at repairing any one thing in particular. The ""menu"" at TCF is better deemed a novel as they offer everything under the sun, from asian to italian, and pizzas to tacos. On the upside: Bring on the large parties! They're bound to have something to please everyone in the group.  My favorites at TCF: - The (complimentary) pumpernickle and sourdough (??) bread with butter. This stuff is GOOD y'all. So good there is actually a facebook group dedicated to how delicious it is. I know the portions at TCF are ginormous and you want to save room for cheesecake too... but don't forget about the bread!  - Calimari: Crunchy, crispy, and chewy! Plus, they give you TWO dipping sauces -- cocktail sauce & a mayo-based garlic sauce  - Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp: A spicy Thai-inspired dish with curry, peanuts, and toasted coconut served with white rice chicken and shrimp.  - Red Velvet Cheesecake: A layer of cheesecake sandwiched between two layers of red velvet cake... need I say more??  NOM NOM NOM Service is always spectacular and the ambiance is great for dates and celebrations. My only complaint: the average/uninspired entrees due to the sheer quantity of items they offer. It's about QUALITY not quantity, TCF!"
Jeanette R.,"Bryan, TX",0,2,2,2.0,3/14/2016,Service was so slow! It shouldn't take over 2 hours for dinner. Our waitress Whitney T. was very slow and took forever bringing anything out and checking on us. She was disappeared frequently and we hardly saw her. We were so tired and ready to be out of the restaurant. Food was okay.
Johnson E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,19,2.0,3/13/2016,"I see why this marquee restaurant had received such bad reviews now. I was seated in the restaurant for six to ten minutes before the rudeness ensued. I hadn't received plates for my bread when it had been delivered (table not properly set), so I took it upon myself to retrieve done myself from a nearby table. I was promptly interrupted by the greeter/seater who told me in a most rude manner that this table was for her next party. I placed the plate back asking why our table was not properly set, and the young lady retrieves a different plate of of the table for me. The key here is she LEAVES the plate I already picked up on their table! Management comes to speak to us, and is very kind informing me that this young lady was sent home, but STILL LEAVES THE PLATE! Maybe I'm a germaphobe, but I don't think that I should have to all my server to correct a mistake the manager should have! Rude and germ prone. Shameful!"
Joanna F.,"Anderson Arbor, TX",15,32,1,1.0,10/27/2014,"Extremely poor service. I requested a table outside and was told I had a wait a bit, which wasn't a problem at all. Shortly after a hostess walked me outside to the table not asking which one I'd prefer (one was only occupied), she didn't introduce herself - just slapped the menu down the table and walked away...she didn't even make an eye contact!!! I'd expect better in fast food restaurant. On that note, I completely lost my appetite and went back inside to share my experience with the greeter guy. I will NEVER be back there.!!!!"
David A.,"Austin, TX",0,59,,5.0,7/20/2015,"First Experience here. Outstanding!  Ask for Christian!  He will take the BEST care of you! He was at Olive Garden for a year or so, and The Cheese Cake Factory was smart to hire him. The food and service here- THE BEST!"
Matthew H.,"Austin, TX",173,178,1,2.0,2/26/2013,"Who the hell is Cheesecake Factory's target demographic? Judging by the design of the interior and the size of the menu, indecisive, obese former Roman senate members who somehow traveled forward in time to eat bologna al fredo out of a dish that should be set out for a family of eight with silverware that feels like giant novelty versions of the real thing. If this were indeed a cheesecake factory, and judged only for cheesecake, then yes... they do pretty well. Although, calorie-wise, you'd do better eating three pounds of bacon and drinking the fat from frying it up afterwards to top it off. I'd give a better analysis of the food quality but I only made it to page 2,305 of the menu before blacking out and waking up with a congealing bowl of pasta the size of a small dog and breadsticks closer in relation to javelins than bread. ...No. Just No."
ProveIt T.,"Round Rock, TX",0,9,,5.0,4/19/2015,Love this place!  My review is over due.  Booked our office holiday luncheon here and it was great.  Service and food were A+.  Hoping the office would like a repeat for 2015!
Amy D.,"Hutto, TX",11,16,4,1.0,2/8/2013,"Friday, February 1 Around 9 p.m. my family and I went to The Cheesecake Factory located in the Arboretum in celebration of my sister's birthday. I was excited not only because it was my sister's birthday (party of 16) but also it was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. It is a very nice place but after about 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. The food was pretty good. We left the restaurant around midnight and noticed several cop cars out front. We get to our truck only to find out we've been a victim of ""ATTEMPTED AUTO THEFT."" The thieves broke the lock to our truck and also jammed and damaged/broke our ignition switch. Our truck couldn't even start!! My family was stranded! I was in shock because this has never happened to us, not to mention we couldn't believe this actually happened in a ""nice"" part of town.   So here is my question: Where was the mobile security patrol? Hmmm good question! We filed a police report and were told by officer M. Heyward that 4 trucks (in addition to ours) were also broken into ....WOW UNBELIEVABLE!!   Result: So here is my little family, stranded with no option other than my husband calling a tow truck company from the town we live, which by the way is about 45 minutes away from Austin. I was in complete shock all weekend until Monday. I called Cheesecake Factory early Monday and spoke with manager Sherston to let them know what happened in their parking lot and felt someone should be liable for their customer's damaged property. Unfortunately, Sherston was quite insensitive and quickly referred me to Simon Properties. I called Simon Property early Tuesday only to be instructed to call back after 1 p.m.   Conclusion: When customers visit an establishment, they should have a reasonable sense of security that their belongings will be safe. If something is damaged, there is such thing called insurance....but I find even getting to this point is almost impossible... so far. 2 stars because the cheese cake is excellent !"
Nitsia R.,"Kyle, TX",0,7,,4.0,6/1/2015,"My family and I love it here. We have never had a bad experience thus far and love coming back any chance we get. You will not be disappointed. I love the ambiance, whether it's a sports bar type atmosphere you are looking for, to an intimate or family dinner. Their set up in very cozy and you do not feel like you are dining with the entire restaurant. We have been known to eat dinner elsewhere and just come here for dessert an coffee. Their food is quite good as well."
Thu N.,"Austin, TX",48,25,16,3.0,7/31/2014,"There is a wide variety of food here.  So it's a great place to go with a group that has a a vast difference in preference.  The cheesecake of course is awesome!  Entrees are a hit or miss.  Some things are wonderful and full of flavor.  Others need a little help on that end.  Recommended items include the Asian chicken lettuce wrap, skinnylicious Asian chicken salad, Tuscan chicken and the grilled salmon.  Service is also a hit or miss.  11:30 lunch for 4 can take up to 1.5 hours on a week day.  Don't be too surprised to wait 5+ minutes even when there are plenty of empty tables available.  In short, come here for the cheesecake and that's about it."
Catalina L.,"Austin, TX",39,22,6,1.0,8/29/2015,"Worst place to have a dinner party of 15. Me and my friends called management 2 weeks before to ask details about big party's for dinner. They said it was fine that they would find a way, they advised we be there 2 hours before so we could be guaranteed a table by 7:30. So we did we arrived at 5:30 and had some appetizers at the bar. 7:30 came and we asked if our table was almost ready, staff said they were waiting for people to leave so they could clean the table for us. Long story short half the party left and we didn't get seated until 9:45 pm and bad service from there. Everyone ordered there food and I was the only one that had to wait 25 more min because the waiter forgot to tell the cook my order. Never going there again worst customer service ever, they treated us as if we had just walked in even though we had talked to them 2 weeks ago. Food is nothing special and it was very overpriced, it took 40 min to get dessert. We all drove from far away for this."
