Matt P.,"Austin, TX",35,88,46,2.0,4/17/2013,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory two times. The first, we had drinks and cheesecake to go. The second, we had drinks and apps. We sat at the bar both times. I had high expectations going both times due to all the hype Ive heard from friends and others. Both times we went, we had the same bartender, I believe Jackie is her name. She was attentive and fantastic both times we were there. Never a dry drink and quick with any requests we had. The cheesecake we had was ""Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple"". Dont get me wrong, it was rich and very good, but when your namesake is such I expected life changing cheesecake, and thats not what I got. Our second trip we I wanted to try as many things as possible from the novel of a menu CF offers. We ordered small plates and apps that included the made to order guacamole, Parmesan Polenta Fries, Crispy Crab Bites, Dynamite Tempura Shrimp and Vietnamese Tacos. The guac was good and fresh, but I had to salt it 4 times before I felt like it was right. Guac is very simple, salt being one of the key ingredients. I thought it perplexing that there was little or none in ours, and at $10.95 I dont feel like a little salt is a lot to ask for. The parm polenta fries struck me as straight out of a frozen bag into a deep frier, nothing special here. The crispy crab bites had big chunks of crab in them which was nice, but they were slightly undercooked, pretty greasy and served with a side of what Im assuming was supposed to be tartar sauce. It was more like mayo with 4 peices of relish in it. The dynamite shrimp was a big let down. There was nothing dynamite about it. There was no heat anywhere in the dish and the flavors were pedestrian at best. The worst thing we had was the Vietnamese tacos. I had made it 3/4 of the way through the first one when I got to the part of the bun that was stale and hard as a rock. I didnt even attempt to eat the other two and asked to have it taken off the bill, which Jackie handled without hesitation. We took our leftovers to go, which promptly ended up in the trash as soon as we got home because I was not interested in eating any of it ever again. My model has always been to give a place two chances because anyone can have a bad day. The Cheesecake got their 2 out of me, and they will get no more unless it includes drinks at the bar only"
John N.,"Austin, TX",123,12,4,5.0,3/29/2014,"I went to this location for the first time on 3/29 and my experience was fantastic. My three friends and I had a little wait (~30), but we were moved in and seated promptly. Our server for the night was Melyssa. If you happen to eat at this location and receive her as a server, consider yourself lucky. She was absolutely outstanding! Melyssa was extremely nice, cheerful, responsive, and attentive. Everything was prompt with her; additionally, her demeanor was very positive. The other staff at this location were also excellent and so courteous. The service Melyssa gave my friends I has been some of the best I have ever received. I ordered the SkinnyLicious Soft Tacos with shrimp. The meal is something I would definitely order again. The three tacos were perfectly filled with the right amount of shrimp and other toppings. Additionally, the vegetables that are served on the side are great. They had just the right amount of flavor I thought. Between the service and the food, this location has more than warranted give stars.  I also spoke on the phone to Charlie (I believe that's his name) who was a manager that night. The service and food was simply too outstanding to not thank someone in management. He was great on the phone and very friendly. Thank you to Melyssa, Charlie, and the entire staff for a splendid night!"
Ryan H.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,169,6,2.0,5/2/2013,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this place besides maybe the prices. Its just underwhelming. The prices are very high for what you are eating (typical appetizer in the $8-10 range and meals about $15 all the way up to $30 for a ribeye). The amount of stuff on the menu is overwhelming and leads me to believe they are mostly prepared from frozen food. Which leads to my other observation that many of the dishes are very salty. Obviously the cheesecake is great. It's what gets people in the door, and rightfully so. But beyond that, its a place that is expensive and specializes in nothing. Its probably good for a group of picky eaters because the menu is so large its hard to find something thats not on there.  Especially being in the Arboretum, there are many other places to choose from."
Anna S.,"Redwood City, CA",12,93,28,4.0,5/30/2013,"I'm a fan. Apparently some people here aren't. The service is great. As with all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the waiters/waitresses will wear white to show that they are hiding nothing. Any food stains can be easily seen I suppose, but here's the other catch. The lights are generally annoyingly dim, so even with a white uniform, I still wouldn't be able to see any food stains. Nevertheless, the servers are super friendly and make sure they get you what you want.  One of the complaints here is that the food is really expensive, but honestly I think it is a reasonable deal because Cheesecake Factory provides you with so much. If you can't afford it, then share the dish with one other person and split the check. If you're still hungry, you can munch on the complimentary bread and butter. And let's not forget to order dessert. The Cheesecake Factory makes so many different delicious, mouth-watering cheesecakes. I usually choose the fruity ones. Overall, I would completely recommend coming here, especially if you like cheesecake."
Jamie D.,"Austin, TX",1,6,,1.0,6/23/2014,"My office won a company contest and our prize was dinner, where ever we wanted to go. We chose this restaurant because of the variety it offered. Big mistake! There were seven of us, but it didn't take long to seat us, so that was nice. Of course, it was only 4:30 in the afternoon, so it wasn't packed. We were seated at our table and given menus and then waited...and waited. Finally, we see the waiter and he asked for our drink requests. Once he brought the drinks out, he left...and we waited some more. He finally came back and we were able to order appetizers. He didn't ask us if we were ready to order the rest of the meal, he just left and we waited some more. We saw him a lot, at a table across from us, just chatting it up with those diners, but we had to stop him to give us more bread and refills and then finally order our dinner. He also forgot to put my co-worker's drink order in. By this time, we were pretty irritated, so I asked the hostess to have the manager stop by our table. This is where it gets inexcusable. About five minutes later, the manager stops by our table and asks us how we were enjoying everything. We told him how bad our service was and expected an apology or something to let us know he cared. He said he was going to check on our food and sure enough, it came right out, but we never saw the manager again. He never came back to check on us, to apologize, to rectify the situation, nothing. We are an office that works in customer service and this is totally unacceptable.  I rarely go to chain restaurants because I prefer to give my money locally and local establishments seem to work harder for their customers. This experience reminded me why I should steer clear of the chains."
Veronica B.,"Austin, TX",0,61,7,5.0,5/6/2015,LOVE it here.  I like to go with a good book and sit outside while enjoying an appetizer and a piece of cheesecake.  The staff is super friendly and very accommodating!
Cam B.,"Austin, TX",11,21,4,5.0,1/22/2014,"They don't call this the Cheesecake Factory for nothing. The selection in cheesecake had me floored as far as every type of food on the menu you could possibly think of ranging from Mexican, to Italian to seafood etc...  I had the White Chicken Chili which was really delicious with a slight kick to it that didn't overpower the dish. For dessert we had the Kahlua coffee chocolate cheesecake which was chocolatey without chocolating you out. I found it to be a really nice balance.  The service was wonderful, the waitress was fun, and the meals were good portion sizes for what you pay."
Bebe G.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/21/2015,Some ok food mini sliders and Orange chicken with white rice without vegetables they always smell and taste burnt. Really poor waitstaff always with an attitude like no one wants to be at working and so are the bartenders and after my 4th visit i just had to talk to managment and him to had a problem and really didn't make me happy so we left and every time someone recommends cheesecake factory. I laugh and tell them about my 4time experiences its one thing to happen once but another to happen 4times i would not pay or recommend this restaurant at all the only good thing about this place is it stays open till 11:00pm still not worth it rather eat fast-food and thats sad cause i dnt do fast-food
James D.,"Austin, TX",5,27,1,3.0,1/21/2015,Ordered a curbside take out. Got the pot stickers and orange chicken. Both were okay. Guess I should've just gone to a Chinese restaurant. Orange chicken was kind of bland and I'm not going to finish the pot stickers. Yuck. Thank goodness I got cheese cake to get the taste of the other items out of my mouth. Gerald the server was great.
Catherine T.,"Austin, TX",539,410,1438,3.0,9/24/2010,EIGHT BUCKS for ONE slice of cheesecake??  Didn't it used to be SIX BUCKS per slice?  Even THAT'S too much! You suck!   BOOM!  Your fourth star totally supernovaed and disappeared.
Tiff S.,"Middle River, MD",5,34,,1.0,9/24/2012,"Once upon a time...I was hosting a friend from out of town and mid-day, we got a hankering for something sweet. What better to get than the best cheesecake in the world? Off we we traveled to the Cheesecake Factory. Upon being seated, we asked for two waters, parched from our quest. Of course, in the mysterious land of restaurants, this pisses a waiter off because it indicates a lousy tip may be coming. Our waiter became irritated and hasty despite having an almost empty restaurant.  I've worked in this mysterious land of restaurants where tips are your life force, and I told myself ""maybe he's having a bad day!"" We all have those. We ordered cheesecake only, which prompted our server to sigh loudly and appear VISIBLY annoyed. He did not visit our table again except to drop off the cheesecake and then drop off the check without having asked if we were ready or if we enjoyed the desert.  Being a princess through-and-through I made sure to leave him a $20 tip on a $18 bill to show that not every customer coming in for a quick desert is going to be a cheap-ass and tip poorly. I left a nice note on the back of the receipt saying that I hoped his day improved and not to judge his customers before getting to know them.  And I lived happily ever after. Fin."
Jordon C.,"Austin, TX",9,3,1,4.0,2/15/2014,Holy jumbalaya pasta and herb-crusted salmon!!! Onion rings are the most amazing things I've ever had. Even better than a hooker licking my.... Anyway I would give it 5 starts but I'm still waiting on my cheesecake that I ordered. It is the Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple. Hope it's as good as Helen Keller said it was in her diary.
Palmir W.,"Austin, TX",0,23,1,1.0,8/19/2016,"This place used to be a very nice place before. This time I went with my mom to celebrate her birthday. First of all, the glasses were very very dirty. When you touched the surface of the glass you could feel the dirt on the glass. I told them to change the glasses and bring cleaner one. Second, when they bring the glass of water, they don't put straw in it anymore!! The waiter asks IF I want straw which is so funny how can I drink a glass of water full of ice without straw?? Third problem is that, they no longer bring butter and bread before they bring your order. They used to bring bread and butter.  And I have gone there to celebrate other birthday parties before, they used to put some candles on the cake. I told them that this is my mom's birthday but they did not put any candle on the cake which shows they don't care about customers anymore. This WAS my favorite place before, but no more. I will not go there anymore..."
Luis A.,"Austin, TX",4,16,10,4.0,12/14/2014,"Love the food, wait time was bad, intervals of 15 min between first seating, drinks and ordering"

The menu overwhelms me--if you've never been, it's so large they have to run adds to keep it in print--so I stick to my favorites: the famous chicken madeira or the cobb salad, and a well-mannered dirty martini. Blue cheese olives, I die! I mean, sure, they're not the only place to have blue cheese olives, but they have EVERYTHING and it is all SO GOOD! I've always had good to great service, quick seating (although I go during weekday lunch), and I've yet to have a cheesecake that is anything less than fantastic.

Anna G.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,4.0,2/13/2016,"Great food, big portions, and good drinks.  A little pricey, but we always have leftovers."
Dori D.,"Austin, TX",11,83,50,3.0,11/6/2014,Been here several times. The cheesecake is incredible. The food is average at best. My husband loves the meatloaf so that's why we go.   The service has gotten better than it has been in the past so can't complain.
Vicki G.,"Austin, TX",375,265,1,2.0,11/29/2012,"So much has been written about the Cheesecake Factory that I hesitate... but Yelping  is my duty, and an honor and a privilege. So here I go. If you've been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know that it's overwhelming -- the faux fancy decor that reminds me of Vegas, the book-like menus (why are there ads in their menus? tacky!), the enormous portions. We just don't eat vast quantities of food, preferring quality to quantity. So, for lunch we split three ""small plates"": crab bites,  dynamite shrimp, kale salad.  Crab bites: surprisingly tasty, with real crab in evidence. Sauce: what was that, mayonnaise? Very little flavor and definitely did not enhance the crab cakes. Dynamite shrimp: tempura shrimp served with a ""dynamite"" sauce. Folks, what does ""dynamite"" indicate to you when you read it on a menu? Spicy, am I right? No spice here. Merely a different color of mayonnaise. Very little taste. Shrimp themselves were okay, but tempura batter absorbed a lot of grease (fried at too low a temperature?). Kale salad: disappointing. The apple had a floral overtone, and the creamy dressing overpowered the ingredients. Frankly, the kale salads at both Central Market and Whole Foods outshine this one by a long shot. He insisted on dessert, and ordered carrot cake. (I know -- it's the CHEESECAKE factory.) But the carrot cake was quite good. $7.50 a slice -- it should be good! It was large, but...  In conclusion, I would return, but really, it's just not the type of restaurant that works well for me.  Dessert may be their strong suit."
Matthew S.,"Hutto, TX",22,32,23,1.0,2/20/2016,Service was not fast waited for 5 mins for drinks and then it took the waiter another 10 mins to bring the bread he was not a friendly waiter at all he was not talkative/outgoing at all it basically was like what you want to eat and that was it he didn't even bring waters to my table and I could of really used that water after having a Mohito I was  the guy that brought us our plates was more outgoing than the waiter its was poor service here so I will take my Business to chedders or Olive Garden P.S. The food wasn't all the great this time  around my 4 cheese pasta had to many Onions in it and to top that off some of the onions were a bit hard like rubber like they were old
Danny O.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,159,2,1.0,8/7/2014,"Went back for my birthday lunch and was not happy. The waitress was a snooty stuck up little brat, my cuban sandwhich was tasteless, my cheesecake was weird tasting and just was not happy in general... don't think I'll come back."

We just don't eat vast quantities of food, preferring quality to quantity. So, for lunch we split three ""small plates"": crab bites,  dynamite shrimp, kale salad.  Crab bites: surprisingly tasty, with real crab in evidence. Sauce: what was that, mayonnaise? Very little flavor and definitely did not enhance the crab cakes. Dynamite shrimp: tempura shrimp served with a ""dynamite"" sauce. Folks, what does ""dynamite"" indicate to you when you read it on a menu? Spicy, am I right? No spice here. Merely a different color of mayonnaise. Very little taste. Shrimp themselves were okay, but tempura batter absorbed a lot of grease (fried at too low a temperature?). Kale salad: disappointing. The apple had a floral overtone, and the creamy dressing overpowered the ingredients. Frankly, the kale salads at both Central Market and Whole Foods outshine this one by a long shot. He insisted on dessert, and ordered carrot cake. (I know -- it's the CHEESECAKE factory.) But the carrot cake was quite good. $7.50 a slice -- it should be good! It was large, but...  In conclusion, I would return, but really, it's just not the type of restaurant that works well for me.  Dessert may be their strong suit."
