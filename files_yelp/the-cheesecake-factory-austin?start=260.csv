R H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,12,,1.0,8/16/2014,"Went there today for lunch.  Ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich.  Got it, it was raw.  Like frozen in the middle raw.  Server took it back, and was bringing me another one, which presumably took forever because the cook was paying attention to the time it takes to cook a frozen breaded chicken breast all the way through.  By the time I got my food, my husband was done with his lunch.  He ordered a piece of cheesecake.  The server left to get it.  Twenty minutes go by.  He finally brings it back.  They say they are sorry and comp my raw chicken sandwich.  On my way out a really angry young waitress is walking out of the hostess stand and smashes right into me in her haste.  She doesn't even apologize.  This place is horrible.  Save yourself a bunch of money and calories and eat at Zoe's Kitchen next door."
Evan S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Monday night 7:00pm, party of 10, told 45 min wait, LIARS, 1 1/2 hours currently and still haven't been seated. This is gonna be my last visit"
W F.,"Austin, TX",16,253,9,2.0,4/12/2013,"I have no idea why anyone would come here.  So many better places around here. Pros: Service was okay, no complaints Cons:  * Atmosphere: It's a beautiful place, but I'm giving NO points here:    - Lighting: When we arrived the table we selected was large and had good lighting.  For some unknown reason they turned the lights WAY down low even though I can't see a group of 7 people on a huge round table being anything like romantic.  I asked the waitress to turn up the lights.  She indicated that the manager would not let her.  I didn't want to put her through the trouble of tracking down this moron so I just dealt with it.    - Floors were slippery.  Seriously, what is that about? * Food: Had a veggie burger.  It was barely adequate. --- Won't be back."
Mary A.,"Round Rock, TX",0,3,2,4.0,3/15/2015,I love cheese cake factory... But the portions could serve a small tribe! I could do with a third
Leslie H.,"Pflugerville, TX",123,425,98,3.0,6/14/2012,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory multiple times over the past several years.  I've never been overly fond of their menu, a little because it's just too damn big (that's what she said), and mostly because despite said expansive menu, nothing jumps out at me and says ""eat me!"" (that's what... nevermind). On our most recent trip here, which was just for dessert, I ordered my usual cheesecake, the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, with brownie, Kahlua cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ganache.  I love it because I love chocolate and coffee, especially together.  It's dreamy. My husband ordered the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake off of their specialty dessert menu, described as ""our own shortcake topped with vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream.""  My husband's definition of ""shortcake"" is angel food cake or sponge cake or something similar.  This was a biscuit.  He kept saying ""this tastes like a biscuit"" after each bite.  Duh.  The ice cream was tasty and super cold, like below 10 degrees cold.  The strawberries were delicious, as was the whipped cream. So boo to the Cheesecake Factory for having a biscuit instead of cake in the strawberry shortcake!  But kudos for being open super late during the week (11pm) for when I have a raging sweet tooth."
Alexus T.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,2,3,1.0,11/7/2015,"I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but tonight I had the worst service. The server took forever to take our order and once he did he told us they didn't have the dish anymore, five minutes after we ordered it. This happened twice with our appetizer and main meal. We received our appetizer and it was cold. Then once we put in our order for the second time, since they ran out, he had to come back to our table to get what the other person had ordered because he had forgot. It took almost an hour from when we sat down to actually get our meal. On top of that the table that sat down after us received there food 20 min before us. This is not the service i'm used to and will not be eating here again anytime soon. The icing on the cake is when we asked to speak to a manager she never came to our table because she was never notified. We had to go up to the host stand and ask for her. Once we were talking to her our waiter came over and tried to be nosey and see what we were complaining about. I hope you have a better experience then I did tonight!"
Kelsey O.,"Palestine, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Went for desserts and drinks on a Saturday night.  We arrived 40 minutes before closing, which may be a bit later than preferred but not unreasonable.  Throughout the meal, the waitress kept reminding us of how they were about to close.  I ordered a brownie hot fudge sundae as my meal and a friend in my party ordered a regular hot fudge sundae.  When she brought my friend's out, she informed me that they had run out of chocolate so I couldn't have my sundae.  My friend's sundae came out with a GRAVY BOAT full of extra chocolate, so he offered me that chocolate and said I could just ask for the brownie and ice cream with no chocolate.  I did, and it caught the waitress off guard: ""Uhh, I can't serve any more ice cream.  Cheesecake only.""  It then became clear that she was lying, and that someone just didn't want to make my sundae.  I would have been more okay with it if she were honest and just said that the kitchen was shutting down, or something.  To top it all off, as we're checking out another member of our party asks for a to go glass of tea and the waitress says ""Umm I think we're out.""  You would think all of this occurred an hour or more after closing, but we walked out of the restaurant a mere 12 minutes after closing."
Torie M.,"Austin, TX",2,10,3,4.0,10/26/2014,Charlie the manager on duty was amazing. Our waitress was great too. They brought out food on time. Hot made fresh. We even had a misunderstanding on one of the entrees and they took it off the ticket. Just great service. Great food. Will be back!!
Jeanette H.,"Austin, TX",125,282,311,5.0,3/16/2011,I haven't decided if it is a blessing or a curse (or both) that I live so close to Cheesecake Factory. Even though I know the food is not healthy at all I still can't resist. I love the Adam's Peanut Butter (not sure the exact title) cheesecake. It has never disappointed me. It is heaven in the form of a slice of cheesecake.  I also have enjoy the cheese quesadillas. You can't go wrong with oodles of cheese oozing out from between two tortillas.  I will definitely return to this location whether it is for dine in or carry out.
Kellie Gann And Company ..,"Lufkin, TX",241,5,124,5.0,9/16/2014,"My boyfriend and I went to Austin for our Anniversary trip and decided on Cheesecake Factory for the dinner. We were BLOWN AWAY by the food, service, value and ambiance. It was a little noisy, but nothing unreasonable. Best dinner date ever. Worth every penny. We tried the Ahi tuna, steak Dianne, macaroni and cheese, grilled chicken tacos, and vanilla bean cheesecake and Chris's outrageous cheesecake. EVERYTHING was divine. The cheesecake and macaroni and cheese and the ahi were my favorite. But that doesn't mean the entrees were sub par. They were amazing. EVERYTHING was amazing. The staff was so nice and helpful. The restaurant was very clean, fancy and classy, designed a little like Caesars palace on the inside. Definitely my new favorite restaurant!"
None N.,"Austin, TX",13,14,2,1.0,11/9/2014,"Horrid service and cold food.  We had a group of 16 for my birthday celebration. My partner arrived an hour early to request the table because they said they did not take reservations on the weekend per the recommendation of one the hottest we spoke to on the phone.She had stated to come in and it should be fine. When he got there they told him he could not put his name on the list until the megority of the party was there. (What was the point of arriving an hour early) When we did get seated the server (mind you just 1 for a large party of 16) was slow and did not ask everyone if they had wanted an appetizer. Had I been ask I would have ordered. For the guest that did ordered one they came out cold. She didn't even check back to see if everything was OK. Second they had to auction off the food. For someone that has been a server this is not good. It gives the impression that the server does not care of how your personal expeirence is going. When it was time to wrap the food up, my partner said she could wrap up his and I wanted to do it myself. Big mistake, we ended you with someone else food and not the 18.00 plus entree he originally ordered. She didn't even ask if we wanted Cheesecake. HELLO It's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY! We ended up ordering it at the baker that took an additional 20 minutes to get.  If you have not been don't waste your time. This is not what a ""Cheesecake"" experience should be like. Wait until you can visit a different location."
tim v.,"Austin, TX",1,15,1,3.0,11/17/2012,"Today was my first time at Cheesecake Factory. I'd never been there before because I always thought the best thing they had was cheesecake. On to the review. Very expansive menu got me thinking ""well, what are you good at?"" So I just ordered a burger. It was good, albeit with special sauce, which I asked they not add - so that irritated me a bit. The reason for 3 stars is that I just didn't feel welcome. If I'm going to spend $13 for a burger and $20 for salmon I expect the hosts and wait staff to at least pretend to be happy and act like they want to do a good job. The workers just looked like robots, as if they were just going through the motions.  Our orders took forever and my burger was wrong, but in the end, its the customer service that sucked."
Trish C.,"Pflugerville, TX",109,9,1,5.0,9/24/2014,"This place never disappoints! Huge variety on the menu, nice atmosphere, quick friendly service, and fair prices. The kale salad is quirky and delightful. Variety of bread brought out to snack on. And more flavors of cheesecake than you could everimagine!"
Tom M.,"Austin, TX",37,217,37,2.0,5/31/2012,"I had not stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory since 2004 and I was reminded why.  Severely overrated.  The menu read like ""War and Peace"" and the decor was way too Vegas for me.  It looked like the interior of a Shriners' temple. You know, the guys that wear Fezzes and ride the mini bikes in the Fourth of July parade.   With a menu that large it is statistically impossible for all the items to be good and that is a problem.  The Turtle Cheesecake was OK,  but the service was good; friendly and appropriately chatty.  For $60 for two, no alcohol and OK food, I don't see a return visit anytime soon."
Karen H.,"Austin, TX",0,25,,4.0,11/24/2015,"What I like about this place is that there is huge selection of different types of food, whether it's appetizers, burgers or  dinners such as pasta, chicken, beef or fish.  The food is usually good but not great, however there is something for everyone. Of course their cheesecakes are very good and there are all different kinds like chocolate, vanilla bean and now pumpkin. It's a good place to go if you have a group with differing tastes.The service was efficient and the prices reasonable for what you get.  The ambience while not posh is a little bit nicer than average for a chain restaurant."
Chris M.,"Austin, TX",4976,535,2556,4.0,12/17/2009,"Went here the other night after some Xmas shopping in the Arboretum, and it's been a while since I've eaten here.  I had the Kobe Beef burger, which was pretty good.  I've had Kobe Beef before, was expecting a slightly bigger burger, but regardless it was pretty good.  The service was great, waiter was nice, prompt w/ the refills.  Took home their 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's layered w/ chocolate cake and has chocolate frosting too.  So very damn good.   They have such a large menu - - that's a good thing and a bad thing.  You get variety, but if you're fickle then you could be in trouble in trying to decide what to get.  I like the fact that they recycle in some new dishes - - this was the 1st time I have ever seen Kobe Beef on their menu.    Prices seemed to have gone up a bit, average dinner plates cost about $15.95.  I wanna say that's about a $2 difference from the last time I was there.  Still a great place to go and one of my favorite chains, good ambiance and atmosphere too."
T H.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,72,15,3.0,8/8/2015,"Not the greatest experience tonight and yes it's Saturday night. The server was defiantly not focused on his job which led to my dinner being incorrect. After a 1 hour wait for a table and 40 minutes for the entree, I was not waiting to have it remade. It's pretty obvious, that I wasn't thrilled with my dinner because 3/4 of it was sitting on my bread plate.  I'd only go back in the future for cheesecake to go."
Kristen V.,"Austin, TX",0,23,4,3.0,10/20/2015,"I've eaten here quite a few times.  I always liked the food and enjoyed my overall experience, but the last two times have been less than stellar.  The second to last time I ate here they showed me and my family to a table that was next to a small busy aisle.  Normally I wouldn't care, but we had a baby with us that had to sit in a high-chair so he was sitting in the high-chair in a small aisle with tons of people walking by him.  I was so paranoid his high-chair would get kicked or food would fall on him from all the servers walking by.  Would be nice to have been given a more spacious table in a less busy aisle knowing that we'll need a high-chair and I'm sure the servers would of liked that too since they had to dodge it every time they passed by.  Something to think about next time when showing people to tables.  Now the last time I went TCF I ordered to pick-up my usual Chicken Madeira and Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I was shocked to find most of the lettuce was old, the asparagus on the chicken was old, and half of the chicken madeira was burned making it too hard to eat.  Also, they hardly gave any potatoes with the chicken madeira.  It looked like they just gave me the old and burned food they had because I was picking up and wasn't eating there to actually send this back to the kitchen.  This food was definitely send back to the kitchen quality.  It was such a waste of money and time.  So now my review went from 4-stars to 3.  I will give TCF one more shot and hopefully they will have better quality food next time.  If they don't then sadly I guess I will be done with this place once and for all."
Chad S.,"Victoria, TX",45,14,10,5.0,8/1/2014,"The avocado egg rolls are to die for and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake is simply heavenly! The grilled chicken tostada salad is more than enough for two people and is pretty good. Service is excellent and the building and bathrooms are very clean. Only down side is the price, but I'd still highly recommend it for a nice date night spot."
Wendy K.,"Austin, TX",191,445,349,3.0,8/20/2012,"It was okay tonight. Prewarning.. Dont ever go before they close. The waiter was friendly but they messed up part of the order. The rasberry lemonade was too tart for me. I loved the flatbread that my hubby ordered but had my heart set on the crab dip I ordered. Instead, They give us crab balls. They were ok. I felt bad pointng out to the waiter but did not want to be charged for 2 items. The waiter was friendly though."

The rasberry lemonade was too tart for me. I loved the flatbread that my hubby ordered but had my heart set on the crab dip I ordered. Instead, They give us crab balls. They were ok. I felt bad pointng out to the waiter but did not want to be charged for 2 items. The waiter was friendly though."
