Caitlyn B.,"Austin, TX",180,26,5,5.0,3/10/2014,"I couldn't decide on a restaurant for my birthday. I needed a place that had lots of choices for all the palates in our large party. I settled on Cheesecake Factory, knowing there extremely large menu and building would satisfy both issues.  I became, at first, slightly concerned by the reviews that were all over the place for this location. Then I got annoyed. Most reviews were about decor (that you don't eat) and menu size (you have to be extremely difficult to complain about TOO many choices.) so I decided to give it a shot anyway, having had excellent experiences with other locations in San Diego and Vegas. Our meal was perfect. Our party of 10 and 2 infants was sat immediately despite the after church crows (which is quite busy here in the South.) Between food allergies and picky eaters, we were not an easy group and our server Alicia handled it with ease. She was extremely attentive, but not annoying. She was quick on drink refills and ensuring we had everything we needed. Everything came out perfectly as ordered. I had a delicious piece of chocolate truffle layer cake (since I am sadly dairy intolerant at a place that specializes in cheesecake?)  Overall, loved it, super happy, will be back and asking for Alicia."
Darren T.,"Austin, TX",0,48,4,3.0,9/9/2014,The cheesecake here is REALLY GOOD! The rest of the menu is not exciting. Go here for desert not a meal.
Bana W.,"San Diego, CA",35,122,3,5.0,5/23/2012,"I never used to be a fan (not because the food wasn't good, but because of all the calories), but when a friend told me about their skinnylicious menu I had to check it out. I am so glad I did, the skinnylicious menu is freaking AWESOME. Tons of choices, good prices, good portions, and delicious food that isn't going to be 4,000 calories for a meal. I've tried the lettuce tacos, the tuna tartare, the asian spicy chicken salad, the edamame, and a bunch of other things all the times I've gone with my friends. CCF has definitely become a place I like to go to. The best part is because of the skinnylicious menu I don't show a temporary 2-3 lbs gain (from water retention due to salt) on the scale the next day like I do when I go to other places :) I hope the skinnylicious menu stays :) I also love the sangria- and they have a skinny version of that too without the fruit :) And the staff, anytime I have gone, has always been great :)"
Bree J.,"Ridgefield, WA",10,13,,4.0,2/28/2014,"I love their cheesecake!  My dinner came with a bit of plastic in it....notified our waiter and before I knew it, the manager, Charlie, came over to check on us.  He got me a new entree and was very apologetic.  He handled the situation great.  Comped my meal."
Melise L.,"Austin, TX",27,47,7,2.0,7/6/2011,"It's Cheesecake Factory, whatcha gonna do.  I live close enough that when starting up the engine and driving here, it feels almost like I'm slapping Mother Nature in the face.  Half a Garth Brooks song and a couple turn signals later I've arrived.  B/c of the proximity I go here.   The portions are astronomically large, my chicken piccata came on a plate that can sleep a newborn.  STILL, it blows to charge $16.50 for a swirl of angel hair pasta, 4 thin cutlets, a drizzle of lemon butter sauce with some mushrooms and capers.  That's seriously about $3.23 worth of food.  It was tangier than usual and I lost interest pretty fast.   My server Sara is just the best.  B/c we come in contact with lots of service industry folk, it's easy sometimes to overlook them as part of the scenery which is a damn shame, but it happens.  For about an hour later I was still thinking about how nice she was.  It was the first time at CF where I was offered my tea to go after my meal, she engaged in conversation without seeming like a nosy mother-in-law.  She was so nice to me, I felt shy, like undeserving of such niceness.  I'd go back and sit in her section again if ever I'm having the worst day of my life and need some coddling.   But seriously, CF, stop raising your prices.  It's unbecoming on you."
Jon A.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/14/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to go on special occasions, so it was especially disappointing to get such a terrible ""chicken"" burrito. In all fairness, I may have ticked somebody off by sending my order back initially; I'd asked for no cilantro, and it came smothered in cilantro.  But no big deal; mistakes happen; I was not upset at all.  Then, the burrito I did get was a flour tortilla with onion and tomato sauce inside.  There were 3 very small pieces of chicken hidden in all the unseasoned tomato sauce.  There were lots of red onion pieces, so I nibbled on those. I presume that whoever is in the kitchen knows that a chicken burrito is more than unseasoned tomato sauce in a flour tortilla, so my only conclusion is that I made somebody mad by asking for my food without cilantro. I'm not going back there any time soon.  Like the other reviewer said, there are plenty of places just as reasonably priced with better food (and presumably less temperamental cooks)."
Julia D.,"Austin, TX",0,12,,5.0,8/23/2014,Really wish we had discovered this place a long time ago!  It was delicious.  I had the Chicken Di  Pana and it was very tasty and satisfying.  The portion was very large as well.  I love their breads and the service was excellent!  I didn't catch our gal's name but we came about 2 weeks ago around dinner time Sunday evening.   We will definitely be back to try the desserts!
Fonda W.,"Temple, TX",24,314,319,5.0,5/6/2012,"I can't sing enough praise about The Cheesecake Factory, their food is the BEST!! I have never had anything bad from this place, ALL THEIR FOOD IS AWESOME! I usually get their burgers, either the mini ones or a regular one because the meat is so tender & flavorful. I've also had the Thai lettuce wraps & the Chicken & biscuits, either one of these meals is a hit. Tasty, tasty & more tasty!!! Today on my adventure to try some more of their deliciousness I got the Fish & Chips. Again, TCF didn't let me down, the batter of the fish was perfect, the right amount of crisp & flavor. They have sooooo many cheesecakes & of the ones I've tried my all time favorite is the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake, Wow!! It's AMAZING! The Banana cream is pretty good as well. Either way, everything on the menu is good, you can't go wrong."
S J.,"Tyler, TX",5,121,148,4.0,4/30/2015,This Cheesecake Factory location is so nice. I've been in Austin for a week on business. My hotel is within walking distance so I've eaten here 3 times in a week. The staff is so welcoming from the moment you enter the door. The food is great. I have no complaints. The option to sit on the padio is good.
Ryan J.,"Houston, TX",39,351,76,3.0,12/20/2011,"Let's face it, this is a place you take the family to teach them restaurant manners and the kids love it.  It also happens to be my wife's favorite restaurant so we hit it up for her birthday this month. The service we had was great, the waiter took all the kids orders and got them going first and they came out very quickly.  My wife had some crazy salad topped with a bunch of white dried foo-foo type noodles that I as a man could never stick a fork into. My pasta meal was safe and decent but the chicken was overcooked.  My kids loved it and the pricing is decent for the portion sizes.   We went early and beat the rush which is a tip if you are coming here with kids.  My only gripe here is the ads in the menu, why are they there.  There was actually an ad in the menu to be able to go home and re-enjoy the ads online that were in the menu, really?"
Laurie S.,"Milwood, Austin, TX",47,76,77,2.0,3/30/2014,The service was good but the food was sub par. Very over priced for what we got. We won't be back.
Amanda G.,"Austin, TX",3,15,18,4.0,6/7/2014,"Like any Cheesecake Factory, it was good. This particular one did have a patio, however it was not covered but did have umbrellas. It was hot. And while the area has nice shopping, the view from the patio was a loading dock and parking lot full of cars. I had the lunch soup (baked potato), garden salad, and Asian chicken sand which. It was amazing, probably one of the best sandwiches I've had (still tasting it). The salad was just lettuce with tomatoes."
Cory T.,"Cedar Park, TX",60,25,10,1.0,8/19/2011,"I will never eat here again. Staff was fake, food was bad, and way over priced. Another story of a chain getting lame."
WonderWoman ..,"Austin, TX",0,7,1,5.0,7/13/2015,I have been here many times since I moved to Austin and it is always delicious. The service is good. Sometimes their is a wait of 30 min but the majority of the time we get seated right away. I've tried various dishes and cheesecakes and all have been delicious. The last cheesecake we tried was the chocolate mousse cheesecake it was on point. My favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Michael S.,"Austin, TX",10,5,,2.0,1/5/2016,"I have to preface this by saying I have been a frequent Cheesecake Factory customer.  After Starwars I and 3 other people were excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  We were seated quickly which was the best part of the meal experience.  It took a long time to receive our food and when it did arrive only two of us received our food.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs which I had on 2 prior visits.  The spaghetti was overcooked, had little sauce, and the meatballs were dry.  The other two parties received their food 30 minutes later and only the entree was brought out to one of the parties.  The sides were brought out 10 minutes later but the other entree was not brought out.  The waiter apologized and said he had to get the manager involved.  The manager came out and said that the other entree was not prepared up to par and that she was getting it prepared.  Another twenty minutes passed without the food and I asked for the check.  The waiter said we would not be charged for the entree we did not receive. The bill was right at $100.00 and I left the waiter a $20.00 tip after all it was not his fault. I was overcharged on the meal by having to pay for a higher food item.  I waited for a few days to calm down before going to see the manager Charlie Martindale.  I went to speak with Mr Martindale and gave him a letter of the events along with a copy of the bill.  He seemed concerned and said he would find out who the manager was and find out what had happened.  After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I contacted Mr Martindale.  He said he thought that by us talking that everything was satisfactory.  Everyone can have a bad night and all I really wanted was an email, a note, or a call saying something like ""I am sorry that we did not live up to our usual quality of service that you have received in the past"".  I did not receive such a small sign of customer service."
Summer D.,"Leander, TX",23,187,277,5.0,3/20/2012,In my top 3 favorite dining in Austin. I have never had a bad meal here !  Everything from Small plates to large ones to share.  Great salads and terrific desserts.
John I.,"Austin, TX",79,253,,3.0,4/8/2011,"Once again we had lunch there.  For starters we had the Southwestern Egg Rolls which were delicious and clearly had some spice to them.  My friend K. also got a Greek salad which looked tremendous.   Now on to the entrees.  There is a whole page on the menu devoted to burgers.  My friend K. was intent on his favorite ""Tons of Fun"" burger but sadly that is no longer as our wonderful waitress Sarah informed us.  K. got the Americana instead which has potato strings on the burger.  I opted for the Kobe burger which was dark, rich, but too salty.  I did love the sauteed mushrooms and onions though.  The fries were adequate at best.  Sarah was a rock star of a waitress as she gracefully tended to our every need while chatting it up with us.  The restaurant is beautiful and clean.  As far as chains go you could do a lot worse than this place."
Michael H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,15,2,5.0,5/15/2011,"I just wanted to post a follow-up review to my previous experience. The General Manager, Brandon, went out of his way to contact me after reading my negative review here from last week - before I was able to call him directly. He was eager to make things right and offered for me to bring in my family again, which I accepted. A week after our last visit, we came back in to Cheesecake Factory for lunch again today and had excellent service from our waitress Laurice who is not only good with kids, but also recommended some delicious dessert. And of course the food was great too (give the Avocado Egg Rolls a try), and Brandon even stopped by our table to check on us (taking a break from the kitchen - this guy seems pretty dedicated all the way around). I feel confident that last week was an isolated experience and that we can return again - unannounced even - and still get great service. I'm extremely happy that Brandon made such an effort to make amends."
TiNyLoBo B.,"Georgetown, TX",44,107,19,4.0,11/17/2011,"This is a fun place to take our youngest to when it's her day to be spoiled rotten.  The lunch portions are HUGE (the dinner portions are even more monstrous) and very flavorful, no matter what you choose. The beer, wine and bar selection is vast; I highly recommend the Bellini.  *drools* Final two words: Godiva Cheesecake."
N P.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/26/2015,Bad service. My friend and I waited more than 15 minutes for our waiter.  The hostess noticed our attempts to get service and intervened.  We finally got a waiter but he seemed stoned. He brought us no bread and took a very long to bring our food. He also made some inappropriate sexual comments to us.
