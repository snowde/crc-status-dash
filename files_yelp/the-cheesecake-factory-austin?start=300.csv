gary w.,"Austin, TX",3,56,1,3.0,3/15/2014,Decent food. Decent prices. Slow irregular service. There were people lined up to get in which I don't really get. It's a slight step up from Denny's
Miss M.,"Austin, TX",0,38,,5.0,6/20/2014,"I have only been here once, and it was a few years ago, but I was extremely impressed then! The Cheesecake Factory is gorgeous, our waitress was wonderful, and the food was delicious. I had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, loved it. For dessert I had Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheescake, no complaints with that either! I will definitely be going to The Cheesecake Factory again."
Rochelle M.,"Austin, TX",93,39,28,4.0,2/9/2014,"Living in Austin it seems almost inappropriate to go to chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is just one chain I will always love. The wait can sometimes be a good 45-60 minutes but this is a perfect time to hop over to the bar and grab a wonderful mojito and appetizer! Their menu is quite large, it can feel as though you are thumbing through the pages of a extreme food catalog. They have so many options! The Louisiana chicken pasta is the best thing on the menu by far. The servers are always attentive and helpful on making menu decisions. Of course you must always top the meal off with a wondrous piece of decadent cheesecake that will not leave you with any room to breath! I personally will continue my visits to this lovely chain that never seems to let me down!"
Mark G.,"Austin, TX",134,275,41,4.0,8/9/2011,"1. I'm reviewing The Cheesecake Factory. Wow... next I'll be reviewing the Olive Garden! 2. That Cuban sandwich kicked substantial amounts of ass. In case you don't know, the menu is epic - quite literally a book, and there's no way any eatery could make so many dishes equally spot-on good. Yet The Factory proves capable of being generally okay and serving up random surprises... Service was surprisingly good throughout the evening. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer was comfort food on steroids. Drinks were sound. When the entrees arrived, my meatloaf dish just passed comfort food muster, as did the chicken-and-biscuits. It was the girlfriend's Cuban sandwich that really stole the show: I hesitate to confess it, but it was the best Cuban sandwich I've ever tasted.  The cheesecake desserts were vast in selection and decent but not stellar, as expected. Oh, but that Cuban sandwich... Oh, but my..."
Austin T.,"Austin, TX",0,644,37,1.0,9/14/2011,The manager and many staff sat us in empty dining room (weekday 11am) and we waited and waited and waited then walked out. The manager came running after us and asked to give them another chance we suggested he continue his group huddle with the waitresses. The place smelled like dirty mops The menus were sticky dirty  Franchise or not the owner should know the staff doesn't care and it shows.
Matthew T.,"Austin, TX",5,19,,5.0,3/23/2014,How can you not like The Cheese? Wonderful food at incredibly reasonable prices. Love it!
Amber Q.,"Austin, TX",18,38,6,4.0,5/30/2012,"We rarely go anymore, but I still love it. It's always on a wait when we try to go now, which isn't a bad thing. I've tried out more places in the city now so maybe I have more favs than I thought.  Support Local Businesses!!  ...And go here too, if you can get a table ;)"
Darren B.,"Austin, TX",6,45,81,4.0,2/7/2015,I am a fan of the cheese cake factory is business concept. A very attractive atmosphere with affordable food. The booths offer a lot of privacy. The interior design is beyond extraordinary..... I feel like I'm in the lobby of the Hilton in Houston it's quite grand. In fact I'd say if you took a grand hotel restaurant and made it larger and had itself cheesecake you would get precisely the Cheesecake Factory if you like that that's great I do.  Place is very clean staff is very friendly and attractive. But they are a little bit disorganized. I called for a pick up order and it took 30 minutes and it was only a burger and I was on hold for about 8 minutes. It wasn't a busy time it was 11 o'clock in the morning. I was a little surprised. There's a lady named  Kasey. Observing her multicolored nails and Super friendly attitude I became convinced she is quite rare and noteworthy. People in the service industry sometimes have an incredible amount of charisma and lift spirits of customers who visit. It's inspiring to see such socially gifted people.
Marsha H.,"Austin, TX",2,56,2,4.0,6/5/2015,"Feeling blah, I decided to nerd out at The Cheesecake Factory. The price was worth it, although the low carb cheesecake with Splenda was partially frozen. The Skinny Drink Menu will keep me coming back, though."
Tricia N.,"Austin, TX",232,95,7,3.0,4/15/2011,"I LOVE the Cheesecake and cocktails. Holy crap- a favorite activity of one of my friends and I used to be to ""drink"" our soft, delicious peach bellini dinner. And girl, was it good. The cheesecake is out of this world.  What has begun to PISS me off is the menu- it's too long and it's too much (insert dirty joke here). They make so much and not all of it is good. I wish they'd stick to a few staples.  However, if you want to live decadently in a sugar and alcohol high, cruise on over. Ignore the tacky decorations though- and take your immodium before you GO!"
Liza K.,"Austin, TX",145,258,76,3.0,1/26/2011,"Cheesecake Factories always remind me of Vegas. With all the ornate grandiose decor and big American portions it's kinda hard not to. I confess: I never really feel good about myself after eating here. But I can't fault Cheesecake factory for that. Though if you're feeling the need...this is definitely a pig out place. Portions are generous, things are prepared right, service is excellent! The menu is ridiculously long. Prepare to read a novel. This is good and bad. Good, why? well they have great options and you'll be sure to find something for everyone here, and Bad you say? if your to the point of starving then the menu is your enemy. So best to have a plan of attack if you plan to eat here.  I'm not a fan of cheesecake but, I hear those who DO like cheesecake LOVE theirs. And if your not a cheesecake lover then there are other sweets to pick from. I am a fan of the lemonchello cake. This place is a great happy medium, but definitely not a place I can eat at every week."
Miss S.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,3.0,7/11/2011,"I would normally have a higher rating but what started out as good went to bad and then just darn right unacceptable. BOTH entree's came out wrong. I had 2 waiters and they still sucked.   I asked a waitress how much the well drinks were and she had NO IDEA what a well drink was. How do you work in the lounge and not know what your happy hour specials are or better yet not have a clue what a well drink is. Customer service was not up to par on this evening. Update July 11, 2011: Ok, last time eating here.  Hostesses are frigid and unbecoming.  Wanted me to sit every place I did not want to sit (maybe because I have a small child).  Don't shove me in a back corner please.  Ordered my child kids meal that comes with a drink.  Waitress says ""would you like another apple juice?"" and I said sure.  Next thing you know I have a $1.95 charge for apple juice.  If it doesn't come with it or there are not free refills then SAY SO.  Jambalaya Pasta is $16.95 which is steep considering its 5 quarter size shrimp that are in it."
Sarah K.,"Copperas Cove, TX",7,12,2,5.0,7/3/2011,"First I have to say, my boyfriend and I can NEVER agree on a place to eat. It takes longer to find a place than to actually sit down and eat the food. We came to Austin for a day out and debated for a while where to go until we settled on this place. I went here for prom several years ago and it wasn't good enough to remember. I wasn't expecting much. This restaurant is beautiful. We were immediatly seated and handed a HUGE menu that took me forever to look through. I decided on the Memphis burger, which is a hamburger with swiss cheese, pulled pork, coleslaw, and pickles. This was the best burger I've ever tried! My only problem was that I asked for medium well and was given medium rare. It was still good though. I think my boyfriend had Chicken Pascotta, he said it was good and ate everything but thats doesn't say much since he always does.  Last, we ordered the Rasberry Lemon Cheesecake. I'm not a fan of cheesecak but figured since we're at the Cheesecake Factory we should try it. The cheesecake is sooo good! Its huge too so enough to share and fairly priced. Atmosphere is nice and the waiters and really friendly. Overall this was a good experience and we'll be going back for my birthday in a few weeks."
Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",27,33,,3.0,2/14/2012,"This is where you want to go when you've got a big group, or don't know what those you're dining out with like--the menu is HUGE.  And while I wouldn't say that any of their dishes comes close to the ""best"" version of anything I've had, none have ever been bad either.  The portions are huge, plus they've added a new lower calorie section with nutritional info for those of us who just crossed our fingers and spent an extra hour at the gym before. And the cheesecake, which you MUST try, is pretty darn good.  Again, no rival to my favorite (Carnegie Deli), but they have a gazillion truly creative and delicious flavors--carrot cake, tiramisu and cookie dough are some of my faves."
Tammy S.,"Round Rock, TX",16,26,5,4.0,2/12/2012,"I love this place for their cheesecake. My favorite would have to the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Food wise, I love their appetizers, especially the fire roasted artichokes. I also like their salads, because it's HUGE!!! And it is filling.  I'm not particularly impress wiith their pastas, because it's not ""special.""  The burgers are pretty good. But I don't come here to eat a meal per se. Honestly, this place is for hanging out with great friends, having good drinks and you HAVE to order dessert(s)!!  You can't come here and not eat a cheesecake."
Kim P.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,1.0,5/8/2015,"This is by far the worst customer service I've experienced in awhile. The girl who runs the to-go desk needs a lesson on how to treat people. I stood at the counter for 5min straight without ANY acknowledgement from her. I kept tapping my finger and I know she saw me. She finally says ""I'll be with you in a minute."" Well, then another employee comes over to chat with her. Five more minutes go by and two more people stand in line with me. By this time, I could not hide my frustrations. A guy finally walks up and starts helping us. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip and will think twice before ordering another cheesecake from here!!"
Graciana R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/6/2016,"I give it a fair rating my reasons being is I came in on 3/6/15 at 4:05 pm. I ordered my normal salmon salad and my boyfriend ordered a po boy. We came in here also cause I had a gift card that i purchased a while back and a free offer for cheesecake. i thought why not have a lovely mid day lunch here.What I did not enjoy was our meal at the end of it all.The waiter took to long to attend us and bring us our waters,bread,order our food, cheesecake and check(note different waitress brought our food in the end). When we told him why everything was taking so long for our waters and bread, all he said was it was busy on a Sunday.He rubbed off the wrong way, the way he talked and expressed himself,almost as if he did not like attending us. After we waited about 20 minutes between the waters and bread , we were already thinking of leaving. I do not appreciate waiting that long for something so simple. He then took another 15-20 minutes to take our order. After we ate we waited yet another period of time waiting to take our plates and bring us a dessert menu. I mentioned the free cheesecake offer when we received our waters/bread. By this time I just wanted my cheesecake and be done. By the time we finished it no more than 10 minutes cause we took most of the cheesecake home. He had us sit there for another 15 minutes while he was passed by the hall not noticing that our plates were to the slide and we were waiting for the check. Ultimately I flagged him down for the check. He then said that my gift card and cheesecake took too long to process since they were tricky, what is so tricky about that?!  When we were ready to pay he brought the wrong check and took another 10 minutes to bring the right check out. By this time we were already ready to get out of there. We left at 6:02 after all that waiting. Crazy to think the waiters are not efficient since most people usually want to eat and get out."
Aaron H.,"Round Rock, TX",264,79,19,4.0,7/11/2013,"i actually came here two days in a row for lunch with my employees and had a great time.  in CA, CCF usually involves a long wait no matter when so i was happy to see there were no wait smack in the middle of lunch hour.   without a doubt my favorite dish is the jambalya....can't miss dish. our servers were very attentive and helpful.  i loved the fact they brought my second glass of arnold palmer when my first glass was barely half empty."
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,5.0,1/31/2011,I love the Cheesecake Factory and always have.  They have great happy hour specials.  Full portioned appetizers for $5.  The Miso Salmon is yummy as well as a lot of their salads.  The chopped salad might be my favorite salad of any restaurant.  I love the carrot cake and the Godiva cheesecake.  Be ready to feel super full.
Vanessa D.,"Pflugerville, TX",22,101,2,4.0,3/19/2011,"So we had a game night a few weeks ago and my ""friends"" brought cheesecake for dessert.   Did they bring a plain ordinary cheesecake?  Of course not!  They brought a ""variety"" cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory.  At this point I am not sure if I should love them or hate them...hence the ""friends.""   Up to this point I had skillfully avoided even tasting that evil, luscious dessert.  Now I am having dreams about cheesecake....but not just any cheesecake...no.   There were New York cheesecake slices, raspberry swril slices and the most evil....chocolate slices.  Fortunately I only got a small taste of the chocolate so I was spared the full effect.  I savored a slice of raspberry swirl instead.  Have I mentioned that respberries are my favorite fruit?   Pure ecstasy!!
