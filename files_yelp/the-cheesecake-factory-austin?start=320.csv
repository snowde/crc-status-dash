Andrew C.,"Round Rock, TX",303,107,18,4.0,6/14/2011,"It's been years since I've been to The Cheesecake Factory, but we went here for a going away party this past weekend. The place looked the same as the last time I came here, nice, clean, and could be romantic or kid friendly.  As for the food, the bread that came out was hot and fresh, and our waiter was very generous in providing refills to our large group. I got the herb-crusted salmon and mashed potatoes, which was cooked perfectly, but disappointingly, a bit on the bland side. The mashed potatoes were good and the asparagus was cooked just right, but again, a little bland on flavor, even with some salt. Service was excellent though, the waiter was very attentive and patient, and food came out quickly.  The Cheesecake Factory is not exactly the first thing restaurant that'll come to mind for a Fri/Sat night out, but I wouldn't mind coming back again as long as the service and food remains good!"
Savannah E.,"Austin, TX",29,4,,4.0,2/21/2012,"Went here for Valentine's Day. The wait was obviously long, but the staff was really friendly. The menu is definitely a little overwhelming. We had the avocado egg-rolls, the steak dianne &  herb crusted salmon, and the original cheesecake with strawberries. Everything was AMAZING!  I ordered a margarita, and I was a little disappointed in how tiny the glass was but it was still yummy. This is a great place for date night! I will return again."
Faye S.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,5.0,4/16/2014,"I've visit several times and loved it. Since I've moved accross town I make special trips. I bought a 6"" cake for my birthday 2 days ago....White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle...OMG!!! what a treat. Why is there only one Cheesecake Factory location in Austin?"
Aimee L.,"Austin, TX",5,35,8,1.0,11/29/2010,"I really do think about more than hot tea, but come on folks, sometimes a business should just be ashamed of itself... So I went to Cheesecake Factory on Friday afternoon with my 8-year old for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up afer the Children's Museum. She is ga-ga for cheesecake, so where else? I was prepared to watch her indulge while I soothed my fractured nerves with a nice pot of Earl Grey, and then the waitress informed me they were out of hot tea. ""What!"" I joked (really, I was smiing). ""How can you be out of hot tea?"" She replies, straight-faced and emotionless, ""We're out of hot tea bags. Would you like hot water with lemon?"" Uh no, actually, I wouldn't. We ordered forgettable food and it was delivered with decent service-with-a-smile, but the occasion was ruined.  Running out of tea isn't a crime, but great businesses develop fanatically-loyal devotees through creative problem solving. If they were out of ketchup, what would they do? Run to HEB. If they were out of, gasp, coffee, what would they do? Place a frantic call to Sysco. But when they're out of hot tea, it's acceptable to simply inform the customer that they can't have the one thing they came in for? I think not.  We'll be cheesecaking at Chez Zee next time... In a foodie town like Austin, there is simply no excuse for a less-than-stellar experience."
Chris R.,"Bellingham, WA",0,57,18,2.0,2/19/2014,"Compared to the other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have been to this one is old and not very appealing in terms of looks inside or out. A bunch of very young kids serving that have no idea what decent service is. Very disappointed by the wait for ordering and food. When the food came it was passable but not great - no reason to ever go back here. I know the Cheesecake Factory is a chain and ""it is what it is"" but I have been to 5 others that are quite good and this one is not good in any way."
Karina S.,"San Marcos, TX",0,5,1,3.0,2/19/2014,I used to love going to cheescake factory! The food is always good and up until my visit to this location in Austin so was the service. Went this past Monday for dinner with my boyfriend and our sever probably came to out table 3 times the whole time w were there. It was near closing time so we ordered out cheescake to go at the end of our meal and our sever didn't even care to come by the table to make sure we got out cheescake even tho we had already paid for it! I saw the hostess leave and the cooks leave and we were still there waiting for our cheescake ...we were the only table left in the restaurant ...not a good experience! Not sure if I'll go back anytime soon.
Aaron K.,"Fort Hood, TX",31,21,1,5.0,11/3/2013,"First time at this location wait wasn't bad at all food was really good.  My daughter had the club & loved it, my son had the kids pizza & liked it (but what kid doesn't like pizza), the wifey had the jambalaya pasta as it's her normal favorite, & I had the seared tuna tataki salad which was delicious (besides the tomatoes that had been sitting out too long & were sqishy & nasty hehe).  All in all great great food & great service"
Allen C.,"Austin, TX",12,12,,3.0,5/31/2011,"I love the atmosphere at Cheesecake Factory. The food is alright, but the price is ridiculous.  I always look forward to eating here, but then turn sad once I see the bill."
Jen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",810,97,2,4.0,12/10/2010,"Apparently this is a chain. Best chain restaurant I have EVER been to.  The service was incredible. The waiter was adorable, friendly, and gave us a great wine recommendation.  My best friend and I shared a few things. I got the margerita pizza... Its topped with fresh basil. We also had the avocado egg rolls. Delish. Also, the Greek salad for me and arugula for her.... and some artichoke dish.  Everything including the service was top notch."
nicole d.,"Bunnell, FL",27,42,47,3.0,8/28/2013,"This my second time to a Cheesecake Factory. The first was in Dallas 3 weeks ago and the food was awesome! This time, the server wasnt great, the food had to be sent back twice and the dinner bread was stale! We won't be visiting this one, but I am sure we will visit in the future to a different location."
Cherry D.,"Austin, TX",4,23,6,2.0,3/23/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, what happened to you?"
Mica M.,"Nashville, TN",54,83,10,4.0,10/3/2010,"Hi, my name is Mica, and I eat at chain restaurants. The first step is admitting you have a problem and I admit that about once every few weeks, I crave the Luau salad and a piece of schizophrenic cheesecake. My favorite is the Godiva cheesecake, but I only get it if there is a small army with me because it is RICH.  The Luau salad has mixed field greens dressed in a plum Asian-y dressing, wontons, macadamia nuts, green beans and mango. So good! Luau salad plus mango iced tea is the winning combo for me. The staff is always really friendly, and the decor is that hilarious faux-Egyptian look. Also, there seems to be a perpetual birthday party happening there. What more can you ask of a chain, really?"
Ann H.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,12,,1.0,3/16/2015,"My husband and I went for lunch on a Monday. We waited 10 minutes for our water to come out, another 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order, and then 30 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered the Chicken Avocado sandwich. My cheese wasn't melted and it was cold!!! I also needed a new fork because mine was dirty...it still had food left on it. It took us over 90 minutes for lunch. Doubt we will ever be back."
Elya S.,"Austin, TX",1,23,5,2.0,10/26/2013,"We had dinner there today and never again. It sure looks fancy, has lot's of traffic going through, good atmosphere, music, lighting. My husband took two bites (SMALL bites) off his pasta and said it was way too salty. Our waitress was not anywhere near, after we waited for 10 minutes, we asked another server if my husband could get something else instead, as the pasta was inedible. He was very understanding, said ""sure"", and was about to walk off with the plate. That's when our waitress appeared from nowhere, grabbed the plate from the other waiter's hands, and said ""I got it from here,"" and just walked off. She returned two minutes later saying ""I talked to the manager and he said that too much of the food was eaten from the plate, so we still have to charge you for it. Do you want us to box the rest up?""   Umm... What?! No, we are telling you the food is inedible and literally, two bites were eaten to determine it was no good. And why would we want that boxed up? So I asked the waitress what the manager's name was, because it didn't make any sense. She wouldn't give me a straight answer, and gave me three names of the managers on duty. So I asked again which manager told her that too much was eaten  from the plate. She said she will go try to talk to him again. (Kind of looked like she never talked to the manager in the first place). A few minutes later a manager came up, apologized, and took it off our bill.  I give two stars because my fresh kale salad was decent. But overall, it seems like the whole restaurant is surviving on its appearance (fancy doors, ""expensive"" atmosphere). The quality of food, however, is just not there."
Clifton G.,"Austin, TX",53,51,16,4.0,2/11/2011,"Have you ever been really hungry, but you cant decide what type of food you want? Maybe chinese, no wait, seafood, nah italian, or maybe a steak.. so many choices, where should I go? In situations like this, stop thinking about what restaurant to visit, get in your car, drive to cheesecake factory, and let your indecisive mind carry on that fight in front of their menu.  This place truly has something for everybody, and they have it in ridiculously huge portions. I have had great chicken dishes, seafood plates, asian cuisine, you name it... and I have not encountered a plate that I wouldn't order again. The only trouble with that is there are so many good choices, it is hard to resist trying something new each time I go. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be the crusted chicken romano. I've always been a sucker for anything that includes chicken, cheese, tomato sauce and pasta and this plate blends all of those items together in one gigantic plate. I always end up turning it into two meals and enjoy it every bit as much the next day as leftovers.  As for dessert options, I am fully aware that they have a superb cheesecake selection, but for my money, it is the lemoncello cake that is worth every extra calorie that I jam into my body when I eat here. I just can't pass it up!"
Stu R.,"Austin, TX",120,182,21,1.0,9/8/2010,"I have to admit, my first true love was at The Cheesecake Factory.  Before I ever went here, I looked at the menu online... I think they have nearly 200 items?  Well, one single item shown through the massive list, calling out to me.  It was my red ryder BB gun.  It was the Mile-High Meatloaf Sandwich. The Mile-High Meatloaf Sandwich is no ordinary sandwich.  Open faced, from bottom to top: thick piece of egg bread, multiple book sized pieces of grilled meatloaf, a mountain of mashed potatoes, piles upon piles of onion rings, and a bbq sauce/glaze covering the entire thing.  It's about a foot tall and one of the most epic things that has ever been served to me.  ""Excuse me waiter, can you please bring me more napkins?  I seem to be constantly ejaculating due to the magnificence of this dish.""   WAIT, hold on.  Sorry... was I using the present tense?  I should be using the past tense, because out of all the 200 crappy menu items they decided to get rid of the most amazing pile of delicious heaven I have ever encountered a chain restaurant.   Is there a supervillain on the loose?  Did someone resurrect Hitler?  I don't know, but I'm scared for the world.  Only the most evil force earth has ever known could lead to the removal of this item from the menu. From time to time I remember the glory of the Mile-High Meatloaf Sandwich and check the Cheesecake Factory's online menu to see if all my good deeds have led to its rebirth.  It's been over over 4 years since it existed... every time I drive by the Cheesecake Factory and see it's mosque-like towers, I can't help but think of them as a monument to disappointment  and the beautiful love that could have been."
Nancy P.,"Cedar Park, TX",110,400,631,4.0,9/20/2010,"This is my second time at CF but I can't really count the first time. I was ill the first time so I don't remember what I ate even though it was only three small bites. It was the flu and not food poisening. So BF and I get seated immediately in the bar. We were told we couldn't have a table as they are reserved for a party of Teachers. Okay, so we sit at one of the Hightop tables. Not my favorites as I can't stand having my feet dangle and not touch the floor. This is a short person phoebia.  The party next to us had two Hi-Tops together and kept ordering different Appys. BF and I looked at their Appys to see what looked good. Our waitress comes over and introduces herself. Her name is Melissa, and she pronounces it ME - lis-sa and not Mel-lisa. Okay, to each his own.  BF gets his normal margarita and I try the JW Pink Lemonaide (Thanks to Cat T.) I enjoyed my drink but they did put a lot of ice in it. It was tangy and the raspberry flavor was promanate. The appetitizers we ordered arrived. It filled our Hi-Top. The Fried calamari was front and center, the Chicken Pot stickers in the back and the Crispy Crab Wontons right in front of me. So, of course, I dive into the Crab wontons. Be careful, these bad boys are HOT, I mean temperature HOT. Burnt my damm mouth on the cheese. More cautiously, I take a second bit. Creamy, the crab can be tasted, dipping sauce was sweet and spicy. Not bad at all. Onward to the calamari, and was very pleasantly surprised. They tasted good. They must have seasoned the batter as you didn't really need the tartar or cocktail sauces. Finally the pot stickers, interesting. It was like a small chicken meatball inside of dough. The filling was seasoned ground chicken and it was full of flavor but I loved the soy and ginger sauce with it.  Of course we didn't finish so the To-Go containers are requested. BF said the calamari would be good as leftovers. He was only half right. They still tasted good but also became chewy.  Oh, I forgot to mention, they serve you a free bread basket with some french bread and a dark whole grain bread.  At this point we are stuffed but I remember Errol M. writing about a piece of Heaven on Earth. I talk BF into ordering a Chocolate Truffle cake to go. It was about an hour after we got home that I served this jewel. OMG, orgasmic. The moaning, the lip licking, the drooling, the come hither eyes, and the mouthful of creamy joy.  YES, YES, YES, oh, thank you Errol."
Jasmit K.,"Austin, TX",4,2,,1.0,11/10/2013,Awful food... Hair in the cheesecake.. way too expensive for the service levels... They wouldnt even get us bread until we placed our order while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive Not worth the visit at all
Aaron L.,"Oltorf/East Riverside, Austin, TX",1,3,,5.0,2/16/2014,"Great spot!! I just moved to an apartment nearby and decided to have a good dinner so I looked up spots and decided to try this place. It was perfect. To drink I had a mango melon crush cocktail by recommendation of a very nice bartender named Rachel, and to eat I decided to try the seared tuna tataki salad. I was very surprised on how delicious and filling this salad was, usually I don't order salads because I'm usually still hungry after I finish but this one definitely hit the spot! I recommend this place to anybody who wants to treat themselves to a good meal and a great atmosphere!"
Shanzilee M.,"Manor, TX",1,76,,4.0,10/15/2013,Our server was great & food was delicious. They are pricey...wish they were more affordable for dinner. Very nice atmosphere & choice of cheesecakes & dinner is awesome.

Jasmit K.,"Austin, United States",4,2,,1.0,10/11/2013,Awful food... Hair in the cheesecake.. way too expensive for the service levels... They wouldnt even get us bread until we placed our order while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive Not worth the visit at all
Aaron L.,"Oltorf/East Riverside, Austin, United States",1,3,,5.0,16/2/2014,"Great spot!! I just moved to an apartment nearby and decided to have a good dinner so I looked up spots and decided to try this place. It was perfect. To drink I had a mango melon crush cocktail by recommendation of a very nice bartender named Rachel, and to eat I decided to try the seared tuna tataki salad. I was very surprised on how delicious and filling this salad was, usually I don't order salads because I'm usually still hungry after I finish but this one definitely hit the spot! I recommend this place to anybody who wants to treat themselves to a good meal and a great atmosphere!"
