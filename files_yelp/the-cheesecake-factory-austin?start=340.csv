Stacey B.,"Roswell, GA",161,69,32,3.0,5/19/2013,"Went here last night after a long hiatus...I love The Ritz (my fav drink in the whole world). And that is kind of where it ends. We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls ( a safe bet, to say the least), Chicken Samosas (nothing like the authentic ones I've had, but it was fine overall), and the Cajun ... shrimp something or other, I can't recall. So the hubs didn't finish his entree, barely touched it as a matter of fact. We asked for it to be packed up and never saw our waiter again after that or the food, but still got charged for it...complete bull. Nothing was done to rectify the situation. I can't say I won't ever go back to The Cheesecake Factory, but it probably won't be this one."
Megan M.,"Austin, TX",190,216,14,3.0,11/16/2010,"Humongous Place, humongous menu, humongous portions- yet sometimes humongous doesn't always equal the best. What is somewhat spiffy about the Cheesecake Factory: -They're always very accomodating of large groups.  I typically head in here with groups of around 20 or so for birthdays, bachleorette parties, etc.  Rarely do I come in here with one other person or even just my family. -There's something on the menu for everyone- and I mean everyone.... UNLESS you're on a diet (even the salads have ridiculous amounts of cals in them). -The food isn't half bad and you'll definitely end up taking some home with you.  The appetizers are generous for your party and they also have complementary bread for your table. What isn't so spiffy: -The service is kind of iffy.  Some days you might get good service, others not so much.  For every 2 good servers I've encountered, I've had at least 1 bad one.  One time especially is etched in my brain where I went with just one other person one Sunday evening and we were put in an area all by ourselves and it almost seemed at times that our waiter completely forgot us since there were no other people around.  When he'd come over, it'd seem like a big deal to him that we kind of lost our appetite and just wanted to leave pronto.  I've also had instances in larger groups where the waiters kind of disappear for a while and we have to flag some other waiter down to bring more bread/get a refill/get a menu for a late party, whatever. -The wait time.  Unless you have some kind of reservation, you can expect to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour.  What's nice, though, is that if you're there solely for the cheesecake, you can grab a slice and head out at their little cheesecake case. -The menu can be absolutely daunting for the unprepared- and in a large group, there's always somebody who has no idea what they want.  At 200+ menu items, it just makes things that much harder for that person to figure out. -I guess it is just a personal peeve of mine, but I don't like that they box up your leftovers for you.  Maybe that's just a fancy thing and I'm crazy, but I'm just not a fan of having someone else box up my plate. So overall, the Cheesecake Factory seems much more about the experience itself than the quality of the food- which is all right.  If I had to recommend something, I'd say the calimari and the orange chicken are pretty good.  You'll pay a premium, but you will get a lot of food for the deal."
Lily S.,"Hopkinsville, KY",12,121,16,4.0,9/1/2013,"Cheesecake here is amazing!! I have had the other food as well, but let's face it-most people come here for the cheesecake. Yes, a slice a cheesecake here can seem rather pricey, so save up and come on down! It;s delicious!"
Jennifer T.,"Leander, TX",68,17,3,5.0,6/8/2013,"We had dinner here to celebrate my son's 16th birthday. I called ahead to make a reservation because we had a group of 15. We arrived a few minutes late, but our table was ready and we were seated promptly. Our food was very good. The portions were huge. It is pricey, but for a special occasion it was perfect!"
Tricia W.,"Austin, TX",2,9,,5.0,1/11/2015,"Cheesecake Factory knocked one out of the park today. We were big Cheesecake Factory fans in Bellevue, WA. The Austin store never quite measured up until today. Our waiter, Christopher, was outstanding. The food was top notch."
Sam L.,"Austin, TX",2,17,3,2.0,9/20/2010,Very poor in food sanitation. The waiters put their hands over all the straws and any place where you have your mouth   Pretty gross and very unsanitary.   We were sitting at the bar and just watched them put their dirty hands over everyones drink especially if you had a straw with it.   I wonder how they cook their food here.
Michael H.,"Pflugerville, TX",89,171,245,3.0,4/7/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is pretty fancy but it's more casual if anything. The service is pretty attentive and consistent most of the time. Food here is ok. I've been so many times I wouldn't know where to start with. My favorite dishes here are the ones with the salmon or pasta dishes that uses meat. The ones without meat are lacking in other flavors. Desserts though they're so yummy. Can't go wrong with the standard original cheesecake topped with strawberries. Peanut butter one is pretty good too. Turtle chocolate one is a bit too chocolaty but others may love it. Overall, it's pretty good to go every now and then."
James K.,"Coppell, TX",2,21,,2.0,5/20/2012,"If you're an upper middle-class female with lots of time and money on your hands for leisurely lady-lunches and liposuction, this is the place for you.  Once you get outside the salt, fat and sugar, there is really no flavor, just the sinking feeling that you just dropped $25 for a meal where, thanks to copious portions, there is plenty left over only you dont want to take it home.  It would be one star but I have to give them an extra for having the testicular fortitude to sell advertising on their 200-page menu (plastic surgeons take notice)"
cheryl e.,"Austin, TX",26,4,,2.0,9/25/2013,They no longer have the Thai Chicken Pasta. I don't order it with the chicken but it was the best! Not going back since it was the only reason I would go there.
Victor S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2014,"Don't go here for New Year's Eve. Ordered a simple quesadilla for an appetizer and literally 20 minutes later the manager informed us that the first quesadilla was not perfect and the Executive Chef was on it. We chuckled because it shouldn't be hard to put two tortillas together with some stuff in the middle. After about 10 minutes the manager dropped off the appetizer and it was cold. We then had to send it back and with an embarrassed look the manager had to apologize yet again. The waiter was slow and did not even ask if we needed anything, we had to waive him down to get what we needed. Sure taking care of some portion of the check is good business but on New Years Eve it sure made for a terrible trip there."
Nimra B.,"University of Texas, Austin, TX",3,7,1,2.0,11/25/2012,"Their cheesecakes are good but their service is down the drain. The wait staff is almost always tired and exasperated if you ask them anything about the cakes. I've only gone for the cheesecake and have never tried anything else. However, I've decided from my past visits to just go in, grab what you want, pay and walk out because that's what the employees want you to do. I'll add though, the cheesecake was delish"
Tim T.,"Houston, TX",13,60,,4.0,5/5/2010,"I love me some Cheesecake Factory, not a fan of cheesecake itself (only Dulce de Leche Cheesecake, I'd tear that up), but  fan of the factory. Went here for a friend's birthday and when you go to cheesecake you know whats going down, pastaaaaaaa. Carbs for today and tomorrow because I love their pastas, oh and also their bread. I do not know if anyone asks for more bread as much as I do. I LOVE BREAD, and their white bread is just delicious to me, I eat it like candy I have to stop myself or else I'll get too full. I had the Sun-dried tomato with chicken in fettucini alfredo sauce which I think is delicious! I've tried their sandwiches and seafood but I always go back to my pasta. Big portions of delicious creamy pasta make me full and satisfied and keep me coming back for more!"
Lionel F.,"Austin, TX",165,120,13,2.0,5/31/2010,"There is a good reason to go here, you have no concern whatsoever about caloric intake / you're about to enter a competitive eating contest / you want a salad that can feed a minor league baseball team.  This is higher-end tourist food. Better than TGIF but not by a huge margin. Their portions are colossal. Really, their ""lunch portion"" salads have to be tossed in 55 gallon drums. If the salad is 1800 calories, what do you think the pasta dish weighs in at??? It will take you 15 minutes, minimum, to wade through the tome of a menu and find something you think they cant possibly over-under cook / screw up.  They do make a mean cheesecake and a lot of different flavors. If you want a cool birthday cake for someone, get them something from here. Who doesn't love cheesecake? And while you have your cheesecake it's almost guaranteed you'll have screaming obese kids screaming / crying / whining in stereo at nearby tables.  If you're here, go elsewhere if you can. It's just not great food or great anything really. If you dont care what you're eating and are shooting for volume, hey, Cheesecake Factory FTW... Have fun getting an angioplasty in 10 years but don't dare say ""I have no idea why my arteries look like century old sewer pipes"""
Ilsun P.,"Austin, TX",43,83,22,2.0,2/11/2010,"Eating at the Cheesecake Factory is the epicurean equivalent of watching reruns of Full House- you leave feeling confused, unsatisfied, and vaguely ashamed of yourself. Seating is cramped, and the faux middle eastern decor reminds me of a Vegas casino- but not in a good way.  (By the way, what does the middle east have to do with cheesecake?)   The menu  is massive and not entirely well laid out.  I find it slightly amusing that they seem to sell ad space in their menu.  I wonder if another restaurant has ever bought an ad.  It took way too long to figure out what to get, and the overabundance of choice makes me think they have to be taking shortcuts in the kitchen. The food and drink are mediocre at best.  They mask this by serving gorilla sized portions of everything. They get two stars, because, like Full House, I cant truthfully say that I will never go back in a moment of desperation or weakness."
Bree S.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/5/2015,"No stars on customer service, but here you have to pick one in order to comment. My friends and I went here yesterday for Happy Hour. We arrived a little before 5. The bar area was full and not enough seats for us to sit together, so we asked if we could sit in another section. They said yes but we couldn't order off the happy hour menu. Happy Hour menu is only available in the bar area. What? People only get happy in the bar? Really. If it's Happy Hour why is in not available through out the entire place, especailly if the rest of the place was practically empty. And it's not like it's a completely separate area. So instead of accommodating paying customers and not allowing us to sit in another area and order from the Happy Hour menu, they lost our business and we went to another place that had HH throughout the restaurant until there Happy Hour was over. Good going, excellent business practice. NOT!!!!"
Angelica S.,"Austin, TX",47,471,2,4.0,8/2/2010,"My SIL, her roomie, and my MIL all went to the Cheesecake Factory for the 1/2 off special on National Cheesecake Day. (Which should be every day, btw) I opted for the pineapple upside down cheesecake.  HEAVEN.  I think this should be a major food group.  I paid about $9 for a glass of lemonade and a slice of cheesecake. I'll go back again next year for this wonderful event."
Kat P.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,,2.0,11/28/2014,"My friend and I just went to Cheesecake Factory for dessert, and our waitress Danielle Beller, was rude towards me yet nice to my friend, it was like I wasn't even there.  She smiled at her and told her enjoy your cheesecake ONLY to her and said nothing to me.  All customers should get equal service, and that wasn't the case at our table.  I was nice and courteous to Danielle, but she didn't acknowledge me at all, that's so rude, disrespectful, and really bad customer service.  When I ordered another slice of cheesecake to go, she placed the bag in front of me, but told my friend ""thank you"" with a smile, when I'm the one that order it!  I was able to get my tip back because she didn't deserve one penny of it.  It's not about the money, it's the principle.  This is NOT the way to treat customers."
Tara H.,"San Francisco, CA",577,910,19,3.0,12/26/2007,"I am giving them FIVE STARS for their cheesecake selection. I am giving them NEGATIVE FOUR STARS for their huge menu, made even larger by the advertisements on every other page. Holy crap, if I wanted to read Vogue (80% ads, 20% content), I would have just brought it with me. I am giving them ONE STAR for their mashed potatoes, southwest egg rolls and teriyaki chicken. I am giving them NEGATIVE FIVE STARS for the fact that their decor is somewhere between classy and trashy.  Further, they have made no attempt to dampen the roar of the crowd and, in fact, seem to base their design and architecture around the fact that they want it to be insanely loud. I am giving them TWO STARS for having portions large enough to share and NEGATIVE ONE STAR for charging you to share. I am giving them TEN STARS for making yummy delicious cheesecake that you can have wrapped up to go. This is especially good on Ladies Days.  These stars totally don't add up, but I have decided to give them three stars for their ability to rock the mediocre nature of their establishment."
Tom C.,"Round Rock, TX",38,45,,3.0,3/25/2011,"OMG! Slow. For those willing to take a hour and a half for lunch, the food is good and desserts are better. Clam chowder was nice. The wait staff was putting on a show (much like the ornate interior), but mis-delivered the drinks and served two people in the party - 5 minutes before the other three. (Do you wait, or do you eat?). We had to take our dessert ""to go"". Lots of time for leisurely, luxurious meal with dessert... then this is very nice. Or, just skip to the coffee and dessert menu and still expect $15 per person."
Carlos C.,"Austin, TX",68,73,4,2.0,2/11/2010,"The cheesecake factory isn't one of those places I go to because I really want to. Usually, it's the kind of place where a group I know is going, and I happen to be invited.  There's just something uneasy about seeing that gigantic menu that they have, ranging from Asian-inspired orange chicken, to UK's Shepherds Pie, to Filet Miñon, it's not possible for a restaurant to specializing on ALL those things. Also, who thinks it's a good idea to advertise designer men's jeans in a menu of fried, sugar-fueled, gigantic meals? It just feels way too disney. When I was in Highschool, I dug the ambience. Now I find it a bit gaudy. Why the cheesecake factory looks like an Egyptian palace I have no idea. But that, plus the size of the place, make it seem even more ridiculous.  The food is mediocre, they seem to go for the quantity over quality. My Shepherds Pie was Gigantic, but tasted light ground up hamburger with a mashed potato slop on top. It kind of missed that...flavor...that more authentic pies have. I'd assume that most of their dished are frozen in order to be able to prepare them in time, but I'm not sure. It's kind of expensive for the quality too. Prepare to Spending $15-$20 a person, which might not be that much, but there are better options out there. Go here with a group that makes it fun since everyone can eat whatever they want. I have no plans on returning, but I have a feeling I'll find myself there again someday..."

Now I find it a bit gaudy. Why the cheesecake factory looks like an Egyptian palace I have no idea. But that, plus the size of the place, make it seem even more ridiculous.  The food is mediocre, they seem to go for the quantity over quality. My Shepherds Pie was Gigantic, but tasted light ground up hamburger with a mashed potato slop on top. It kind of missed that...flavor...that more authentic pies have. I'd assume that most of their dished are frozen in order to be able to prepare them in time, but I'm not sure. It's kind of expensive for the quality too. Prepare to Spending $15-$20 a person, which might not be that much, but there are better options out there. Go here with a group that makes it fun since everyone can eat whatever they want. I have no plans on returning, but I have a feeling I'll find myself there again someday..."
