Anthony N.,"Round Rock, TX",121,46,381,5.0,1/22/2011,"This place is my most favorite place to eat.  The food is superb and the atmosphere great.  You really cant go wrong with any dish.  Yes, the prices are a bit on the higher side, but here you truly get what you pay for.  If you come during normal eating times, then expect a long wait.  I always try to go around 3pm.  It is the slow time and they can get you right in.  My favorite dishes are the Teriyaki Chicken and Chicken Bellagio."
Carolina A.,"Austin, TX",37,124,151,4.0,6/19/2010,"This place I have always loved... had not tried here in Austin and found by coincidence :) I was so happy. The food was great, the service nice, the place great, good music. I'm a fan, I love the Sante Fe salad, the desserts, my son had pizza it was out of this world. Will definitely be regulars there... CHEESECAKES mmm, keep that bread coming, what I don't like is the guilt trip afterwards :( I need to try the bar..."
Aissa S.,"Austin, TX",63,31,7,1.0,7/23/2014,"Worst waitress and restaurant ever. What a disappointment. The Cheesecake Factory was my favorite restaurant ever but I doubt I'll return to this location. I would rather drive an hour to San Antonio than return to the Austin location restaurant. First off, the hostesses let people cut in line to get our names on the waiting list. And Don't even acknowledge the mistake. We finally get called for our table and what do you know?, the table wasn't ready. Smh. We end up waiting in the middle of walking isle, in the way because the hostesses couldn't plan accordingly for tables that were or weren't clean. And of course more people that came in after us keep getting seated while we are still waiting. Now, our waitress....gosh, was she high?! We ordered a key lime cheesecake. She comes back repeats ""so you wanted the Godiva cheesecake?"" We told her no, the Key lime cheesecake. We think she's got it. She packs it, we pay and leave. Get home to find a coconut custard cheesecake. Epic fail. She needs to be retrained or given Hearing aids or ADD medication or a drug test. Ridiculous. This location has just lost a loyal customer."
Jim L.,"Austin, TX",272,514,83,2.0,2/6/2010,"Not my choice to eat at a chain for lunch. I have always like the concept of the Cheesecake factory from a visual perspective - great looking place. From a portion control perspective I was looking around, making sure Richard Simmons was not going to come queening out in his striped shorts yelling ""Potion Control! Portion Control!"" when the waiter dropped the food order. My friends split a very underwhelming pepperoni pizza - I was surprised and concerned that between the two of them they ate a quarter of the thing. One other friend ordered a club, but he could not get his mouth around it because it was so big. My turkey burger was good, but I ordered a side salad instead of fries due to the size of things around here.  Therefore, if you are concerned about calorie intake at each meal, ease up on the cheesecake factory by splitting plates or ordering salads without dressing (sugar!). Even better, try another restaurant that caters to your concern for your figure. If you are not concerned about your hourglass (or barrel, as it were), eat up!  I will say that low carb, low sugar Splenda cheesecake sounds like poo, but one of our guests did order it, and it was really no different than the regular in terms of flavor. It felt a bit lighter, and I would still split it, but I was surprised at how good it was. Nothing really offensive happened here for lunch, but it's just not my scene."
Sarah S.,"Austin, TX",44,54,,3.0,2/22/2013,I always really enjoy going here. The menu choices are various. Downside is generally a bit pricier and not always worth it. Amazing desserts though!
Stefanie S.,"Austin, TX",27,58,24,4.0,8/4/2012,"Maybe I'm a bit of a food simpleton, but I've never found any really appetizing entrees at The Cheesecake Factory.  Now the dessert?  Yeah, the place is well worth the trip for the dessert!  You can basically find almost any cheesecake imaginable.  So, my recommendation is eat dinner elsewhere, but stop by here afterwards."
Brandon B.,"Tokushima, Japan",38,131,36,1.0,2/28/2010,"The menu is outrageously thick...takes time just to wade through it all and find what you might want to eat. Once you decide and the food arrives, it's average at best and overpriced. Also, if the name of your joint is ""Cheesecake Factory"" you should actually have good cheesecake, right? Well, they have a lot of them and I've tried 3 different ones on 2 visits and they all were blah and left a chemically, waxy aftertaste in my mouth. Not good. You can get much better cheesecake (one of my favorite desserts BTW) down the street at Manny Hattan's where they have it shipped in from the NYC Carnegie Deli. I don't care if it's a chain or a local establishment, as long as it's good. I won't be going back to Cheesecake Factory for dinner or cheesecake. My money is better spent elsewhere."
Sarah M.,"Austin, TX",125,426,641,3.0,2/1/2007,"This particular version of the American favorite is housed in a high-ceilinged corner of the Arboretum in North Austin. Serving up their typical smorgasbord of over-sized omelettes and sugary slices, it's a sure bet for every type of eater. Cheesecake Factory is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of place, but our local version has a few perks. For one, it's always packed (bustling atmosphere) but there's ample seating (no suffering for bustling atmosphere). Two, the aforementioned diversity of cuisine. Three, a great place for a group outing when you have varying incomes. Four, the cheesecake is great. C'mon. Admit it. It's really good. Cheesecake Factory is comparable in price to a lot of homegrown Austin restaurants and it's pretty far north for many residents. Thus, it's easier to pick something else in lieu of a 20-minute drive, a crowd, and average food. But then again, it's hard to resist a chocolate-peanut butter cheesecake craving... Cheesecake Factory every once in a while."
Daniel M T.,"Lakeway, TX",0,32,8,3.0,7/30/2013,Food was good but the initial service was slow.  She made up for it throughout the meal.
Manoj I.,"Leander, TX",4,238,19,3.0,9/25/2012,"The ambiance is really nice, the food was just ok, nothing special. The tuxedo cheese cake was excellent! It is not overly sweet, just perfect. They have really good mixed drinks. I had the Kentucky tea, and it was perfect. Also liked their fruit daiquiri  with strawberry and banana. I think this will be my place to go chill outside and have a couple of mixed drinks and desert after I have dinner elsewhere ..."
Megan J.,"Oxnard, CA",35,9,57,2.0,2/26/2012,The food was really bland! I got the Chicken Di Pana and everything had no flavor. My husband got the Chicken Avocado Sandwich and the chicken also had no flavor. The only thing I liked was the bread they give you before the meal. Everything was extremely overpriced for mediocre food. Extremely disappointed!
Isabelle K.,"Austin, TX",186,572,452,2.0,10/12/2009,"I went back again with a group of mothers. I noticed they put rugs on the floor, so it's not that slippery.  Since it's Sunday, I ordered something from brunch menu, Crab hash. It's $13, but the plate is full of potatoes and I hardly found any crab meat. Never ever order crab hash!  I ordered coke, and it's $2.75 a glass! My girlfriend ordered raspberry tea and it's $2.95 a glass! And we didn't see that price on menu otherwise we won't order the expensive soda.  The waiter is very nice. We showed him the crab hash plate and he couldn't see the crab meat either. So he brought a small cup of real crab meat from the kitchen for us and apologized for several times."
Leo S.,"Dallas, TX",15,127,130,4.0,9/21/2012,Always a good place to eat.  Food portions are HUGE and the cheesecake is even larger! This is definately a place recommended by me. In moderation is the key at this place.
Amy C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,51,,4.0,1/16/2011,This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Everything I've had has been really good. The servings are huge so you can often take something home. This place almost deserves five stars just for the Godiva cheesecake.
Santiago R.,"Austin, TX",4,19,,2.0,8/12/2014,"I went there for my first time the other day for my wife's birthday. It was nice inside, and not too long of a wait (15 mins) @ 630pm. We were seated and waited forever for someone to wait on us. When our waitress came, we ordered drinks, waited about 10 mins. She left, came back another 10 mins to see if we were ready. We said we were still looking, and as soon we said that, she started to walk away and I had to shout out ""Ma'am!"", because I was expecting her to offer us an appetizer. I ordered the app, another waiter brought us our food, and refills on drinks. Our app took about 10 minutes, and after about 5-10 mins of eating our app, the waitress comes to our table and says, "" Let me get this app out your way"" and starts to walk away again. I shouted at her and said we were ready to order. Wow. She takes the order, the food comes out by yet another waiter, and we eat. At the end, she doesn't offer dessert, and so we asked for a dessert menu, because after all, this is cheesecake factory, and we had told the waitress it was a special day. We get some cheesecake to share and they bring us the plate with a candle. All in all, it was an okay dining experience, but come to find out, they were supposed to bring us bread (in the beginning), and the service really sucked! Not very impressionable for me, it being my first time; not very impressionable for my wife, it being her damn birthday. I feel let down, and after tipping a large amount, feel ripped off. Good thing there are a lot of other restaurants in Austin is all I have to say. And I won't have to drop damn near $100 to be treated with mediocre service."
Gary N.,"Austin, TX",53,54,5,2.0,4/3/2012,The food was horrible and cold and they ran out of mashed potatoes and I was never told just missing from my plate. The staff obviously does not care. The restraunt survives and their desert.
Sunny P.,"Pflugerville, TX",11,12,3,1.0,5/6/2012,Very disappointed with the food and wait time for food. Our server was nice but it took her forever to bring stuff back to the table for us and it was only a two top. The chicken Alfredo had no taste to it!! At 18. Bucks a plate I would think it would be top notch. Then the steak n shrimp plates u get like 3 shrimp and about 4 pieces of small cut up steak for 21. Bucks unbelievable the biggest portion on that plate was the mashed potatoes..I think I'll take my money else where now the water was about the only thing good n fresh here tonight. 50 bucks down the drain but a lesson learned!!!!
Stephan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,30,2,4.0,10/1/2012,"We have been to Cheesecake factory a few times now and I have to admit that we got very lucky after reading some of the reviews I can honestly say it all depends on the waiter you get. Luckily we had not had any bad experience as of yet, I do think their prices are a bit high, but the food is great. but paying 3$ for ice tea is a bit much...but in general its a good environment and their new french toast are absolutely AMAZING but dont look at the calories lol.... Im french Canadian and they use REAL maple syrup but their syrup tasted differently it was a lot sweeter.. so I ask our waitress; she was very friendly to us (her name was Noel) and she told us that they put butter in their maple syrup and I have to admit it was VERY VERY VERY good. again fatning as hell Im sure.. but once in a blue moon we need to spoil ourselves right :)"
James M.,"Austin, TX",1,43,,1.0,4/27/2013,"Lets see where to start.  Had a reservation at 7 for a large party.  Didnt get seated until 8:10 and didnt get food until well past 8:45. Went to bar to get drink while waiting.  Was hard to get the bartender to notice me.  Ordered a Margarita, was ok.  not great. Food was average, nothing special.  Cheapest entry was $11.95.  One in our party had a noodle dish and noodles were not done. Purchased cheesecake to go.  Strawberry Cheesecake was $7.96 per slice.   Tasted like the cheesecake mix you get at grocery store.   Needless to say, very disappointed in experience."
JAMES O.,"Round Rock, TX",0,33,,1.0,2/23/2014,"Might be the worst dining experience ever. My wife and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary with a night out with our two kids so we chose this place because the kids would really enjoy the dessert. We were seated at 4:30, ordered our food by 4:40 and we finally got up and left without eating at 5:25. In the time that we waiting we watch a number of tables be seated, order, be served and a couple finished their meals. We ordered a Cuban sandwich, 2 small pizzas for the kids and lettuce wraps. After waiting for 40 minutes I asked to see a Manager. 10 minutes later we decided to leave as the Manager never bothered to come see us. Please know that at this hour on a Sunday this place is maybe filled to half capacity."
