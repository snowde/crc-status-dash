D O.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,2.0,8/27/2015,"I usually come here every couple of months to meet up with a friend that works near by.  I'm not sure if today was an off day or service has just gone hill since the last time I was here. We ordered their ""new"" salads.  When I requested that I would like to add chicken to mine, I was immediately told that the salads could not be changed at all.  I asked why there were ""additions"" that could be added to the salads at the bottom of the menu then?  She had to look at it and then realized she was incorrect.  Instead of apologizing she seemed to be put out.  Fast forward to 45 minutes later and no food and no one checking on us...  Finally the manager came over to apologize and assured us our food would be out in about 30 seconds.  30 seconds turned into 5 more minutes.  I was finally able to get our waiters attention to ask about our food, to which she still seemed put out about this and said that the manager was handling it.  We finally received our food an hour later, which we had to request a take out container immediately since we had to leave.  The manager was very apologetic and accommodating as much as he could be, even comped our food, our waiter not so much.  Not sure I'll be back anytime soon."
Ryan A.,"Austin, TX",177,36,1,3.0,1/27/2010,"Last night, I went to The Cheesecake Factory and for the first time, I ate something besides cheesecake. A friend and I decided to do dinner here just to see what the food quality/variety was like and much to my surprise, it wasn't too bad! I had a Farfalle Chicken Pasta as per the waiter's recommendation and was pleased with it. The portion was so large that I couldn't even finish it and had to take the rest to go so I'd have room for dessert. Speaking of, we had the 30th anniversary cheesecake for dessert and it was awesome! I've never been disappointed with the desserts at this place! All in all, this is a good place to have a relaxed dinner. The good food, good (though not EXCELLENT) service, and quiet environment are all reasons that I wouldn't mind returning here in the future. Minus one star for the chainy/corporate feel."
Jennifer H.,"McAllen, TX",55,340,144,4.0,12/25/2011,"Review solely on their cheesecake. The 30th anniversary cheesecake is a step closer to diabetes and heart attack, so share the goodness! This delicious chocolate, over the top cake is one of the best in their selection. smothered with whipped cream and covered with crunchy chocolate flakes. Yum yum, stop by and pick up a slice to go!"
Patricia H.,"Austin, TX",94,121,6,3.0,7/11/2011,"boyfriend and i came here on our one year anniversary.  i love their complimentary whole wheat bread and the roasted artichoke appetizer.   we received less than stellar service on our special night because the hostess seated us at the ""half booth"" literally adjoining the waiter station.  there was no half wall separating us from the faces of the waiters .  we asked for a different  table, and the hostess made a big deal out of it.  the original waiter was very angry that we switched tables, and passive aggressively threw our bread at us. we felt bad for switching tables, but we honestly got the worst table in the restaurant, and you would think that a couple dressed to the nines are probable coming to the restaurant because it is a special occasion, so negative 3 stars for the inept hostess and the rude waiter. on the plus, our second waitress was actually a god-send. one of the best waitresses i have ever encountered.  her name was ""me-lissa"" and we were sure to get her name for our next visit. her service was 6 stars.  so after doing the math, this restaurant only gets 3 stars (boo for hiring rude dude, and yay for hiring me-lissa)"
Cameron K.,"Austin, TX",102,369,7,4.0,10/30/2009,"You get what you pay for and all that. Yeah, the place is a little expensive.  Yeah, the menu is thicker than some books.  So what?  If you get delicious food, in huge portions, is there a problem with that?   Chicken madiera is a lot of people's favorite dish, I like their pork chops and pork tenderloin.  The BEST thing on the menu though is the polenta cake appetizers.  Get them instead of the cheesecake, honestly."
David N.,"Riverside, CA",28,179,14,5.0,5/3/2012,"What tipped me over to five stars was the waiter. He was courteous and quite pleasant! The food was pretty good as well! I had a better experience here than the ones in San Diego, CA..."
Katie L.,"Cedar Park, TX",50,141,12,4.0,5/21/2012,I love the feel of this place and the food is not bad at all! They have a new skinnylicious menu that has food that has less calories and their margaritha flatbread is to die for! My new favorite thing to get their for sure!
Jennifer V.,"Austin, TX",0,9,1,1.0,7/20/2014,"It Took hours to be seated. Took an hour for the food to arrive, After waiting an hour only half of the people got their food, the cooks screwed up our order. Took 45 minutes to get desert. This place did not impress me at all it is way over priced and over rated. If you have at least 5 hours to go seat and eat some where than this is your place to go. I will never return to eat, I would rather eat at a hole in the wall where there is decent service and decent time for seating."
Deanna C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,19,,3.0,7/20/2015,"Hadn't been here in awhile...Had a waiter trainer and trainee. They were very efficient--it was lunchtime so that was good. Didn't take any time for chitchat and the one thing they missed was coming back to ask ""how was everything"" so I didn't get to tell them. I got a sandwich on brioche bread supposedly. It was thick, like Texas toast thick, and the crust was too hard to bite. The bacon was burnt on one end, undone on the other, and just right in the middle. There was supposed to be mayo on it, but the sandwich was really bland. I finally opened the bread and found some mayo on one end, but none in the middle, so I asked the waiter for some. They didn't ask why I needed it. So-So meal, except the last time I had brioche, it was in a tasty roll with holes in it it--like light and chewy--from Wal-Mart and much better than here. Didn't have a dessert, and the water was icy cold, so I gave them a 3 star."
David A.,"Austin, TX",363,165,2,4.0,12/1/2011,"Went there for lunch today and they have a new, separate SkinnyLicious Menu (their name, not mine) which had quite a few great menu options for my GF diet needs.  I had the Skinny tacos on corn tortillas today and they were fantastic.  The menu is very extensive and the portions were good size.  Very happy with the new options there!"
Avalon D.,"Round Rock, TX",0,61,6,5.0,8/6/2010,Reese's peanutbutter cheesecake...I'm just gonna leave it at that
Van D.,"Round Rock, TX",2,4,,3.0,10/3/2012,"It was okay. I would have expected the price to be a lot less for the taste of the food. On their defense, I did get the brown rice with my seafood dish. My mom's brown rice is so soft and good, any other place's brown rice taste harsh and tough in comparison. As I love all cheesecakes, I can't complain. But I probably won't pay $7 for a slice of cheese cake here again."
B N.,"Austin, TX",3,92,,3.0,9/13/2011,"I'd recommend that they cut down on their portion size coz it is actually disheartening to see that type of quantity put in front of you. Even though I'm a large eater, each plate you serve is for 4 servings!! So that part is why I put in 3 stars. Salads are fresh as are their apps, but guys you're serving 1 person not a family. Please address this as Americans get unhealthier and sicker!"
David D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,48,,4.0,8/1/2014,Another great lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.   BBQ Ranch Chicken salad is phenomenal and great wait staff
Natalie B.,"Leander, TX",0,18,,2.0,5/14/2014,"I hadn't been here in a while and my dining experience tonight reminded me why- the lack of a good experience. We arrived before the dinner rush yet had to wait 10 minutes for a table despite a very quiet restaurant. The hostess seemed a bit clueless, and the wait staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other. Our waiter was rude, and not helpful- examples: snarky when asked about $5 apps ( only in the bar) and exasperated when asked for guidance on the menu - actual comment "" It's 20 pages."" As I shared in my feedback to them, people go out to get a break and have fun. I had neither of those experiences. I won't be back."
Connor C.,"Austin, TX",0,23,1,5.0,6/19/2014,"I don't go to cheesecake factory very much,  but when I do, I can never complain.  It's awesome. They're cheesecake menu is like Pokémon.  Gotta catch 'em all! You absolutely can not come to the cheesecake factory without ordering one of their heavenly cakes. If you haven't came here before it's a must-visit. You will be amazed by their food. It's a little pricy for someone on a budget so that's one reason I don't visit much but you must go there. You will not be disappointed."
Charley S.,"Austin, TX",0,6,1,2.0,11/12/2011,"Overpriced and under-atmosphered, this chain needs a serious makeover. Like the cheesecake, but most everything else is just adequate.  Gi-nourmous portions are a plus, so you can split with a friend and hold the cost down, but what's up with $10 basic cocktails?"
Amber M.,"Leander, TX",157,11,,2.0,6/12/2012,"What a disaster! First we called ahead about our group of 20 celebrating a high school graduate and they would not take a reservation. They said they only take reservations between 3-5 pm!!? Who needs a reservation at that time of day?!?!?! So of course we had to wait a while to be seated...understood, 20 people. They seated us in 3 back to back booths, so we were all split up and could not see or talk to each other. I give it 2 stars only because the food was good. Since we had a party of 20, they could not handle splitting up the checks. It took 45 minutes for them to determine the bill after we ate. We kept asking about splitting the bill from the time we started ordering drinks and they said it would be no big deal at the end. We had kids crying to leave and we had to wait and wait and wait for each bill. When each bill came, they were all wrong.  Bottom line-good food, big parties-forget It!"
Abigail R.,"Harker Heights, TX",11,14,8,5.0,8/12/2010,"My friends and I eat here a lot... probably too much! The bread they bring to you before the meal is great.  There are a TON of different items on the menu.  There must be like 20 pages to the thing. And of course the cheesecakes are delicious!  Plus, they're always adding new ones."
Sarah C.,"Austin, TX",68,106,2,4.0,5/20/2009,"Nom Nom.  That's the best way I can describe this place.  I hate the fact that I enjoy this chain restaurant as much as I do. I should be ashamed of myself but I'm not. I love the food, the service AND the cheesecake. I am a bit overwhelmed looking at the menu because there's sooo much on there however I do know what I like and what I don't like. They categorize their menu so it's not like all of their selections are in alphabetical order. It's really hard to go wrong here. Unless you're the type who doesn't like choices. .  You must try the dulce de leche cheesecake because it's better than all of the rest. Trust me. You must also try their sangria. It's a really refreshing adult beverage which I think you will enjoy. I've tried duplicating them myself and going to other places to find them in my hood only to find that they are a one of a kind treat at The Cheesecake Factory."
