J O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/6/2017,I've tried to give this place multiple chances to improve but it's extremely bad.  They have very service and after waiting for over an hour for our food the order was wrong. Every time we have come here it's because we have amnesia on how bad it was before.  Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and never plan to come here again.
Errol M.,"Austin, TX",893,1005,2399,4.0,7/8/2015,"It's good to have a goal, and mine is to try every flavor of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. The usual stuff like living the dream & eternal sunshine kind of fall into that ""been there, done that"" category for me, and I've got to have something to wake up for. Incidentally, the journey can often be more rewarding than the destination.  But becoming Cheesecake Jesus requires some careful planning & patience on my part, or the carbs will blow me up like a cheap balloon. With one exception. When the delightful Ashley S texts with ""Let's do dessert,"" the proper response is ""Which two cheesecakes are we trying today?"" And we went with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle & the S'mores Galore. And once you realize what seems to be melting vanilla ice cream is actually toasted marshmallow, you'll think ""Cool!""  And then you'll think, ""Holy sugar rush, these two cheesecakes are really sweet."" I still think it's hard to beat the Chocolate Tuxedo with Mascarpone mousse here. Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, I guess I should complain about Cheesecake Factory being another corporate chain polluting the local restaurant landscape, but screw that - I like the place. I'm actually more interested in how the upcoming Cheesecake Factory inside Barton Creek Mall will affect this one, because the Arboretum CF has the coolest ceiling ever. You don't gaze at it every time you're here? C'mon, let me point out the highlights, while we contemplate which two cheesecakes are next."
Jim O.,"Austin, TX",8,218,16,2.0,6/6/2016,"It was just okay.  The salad was just okay, the cheesecake (Macadamian Nut) was just okay, the service was just okay.  Yeah it's a very extensive menu, but this is my second trip to a Cheesecake Factory and well I won't be going again."
Aj I.,"Austin, TX",1,13,1,1.0,1/15/2017,"Bad service and attitude experienced by our group on 1/7/17. We had a group of 7, no reservation around 10pm. We informed them only dessert where no main dishes would be ordered. From greeted by a busy/indifferent manager at the front desk, wait time, and wait staff attitude were noted, this was not a good experience.  40 min wait to be seated, another 20-30 minute for 3 slices of cheesecake, drink both alcoholic and non-alcoholic orders mistakes. I totally understand if we came at peak hours or if the place was in obvious high demand, we would bounce out of there and no worries, but this was not witnessed at the time of visit. The wait time experienced was not given an excuse ( making the cheesecakes, understaff...whatever the reason), overall bad vibe from staff was felt by our group, and when our little nephew was eyeing the displayed toys ( he figured no lock on door and pull one plush fish out) we paid for his prize at the to-go  area and alerted the front desk manager of their no-lock situation. I hope for their sake it was a bad night we encountered and not constant. What turned from a joyous birthday celebration day with intentions to end the night with some dessert, left the group with a sour taste."
Esther N.,"Austin, TX",0,14,18,2.0,11/25/2016,"I would like to give 2.5 stars but 3 or more definitely isn't deserved. I came here after I got married by judge with family that drove here from Houston. We were all hungry, and I wanted to choose a place that was relatively inexpensive and can meet most of the party's food needs/requirements. We chose Cheesecake Factory. What a bad decision.  We sat down within minutes of arriving, but our waiter took almost 20 minutes to greet us and ask us for drinks. Already I knew this visit wouldn't end well, and some members in my family would not like their experience at all.  Our waiter was nice: a young African American boy who seems to have started working there just a couple months prior. He was very friendly and tried to accommodate everyone's needs. He took our drink orders (which really was water and 3 sodas) and returned another 20 minutes later with our drinks. I don't recall him apologizing for the long wait just for drinks. So far, more than half an hour spent and we haven't even ordered our food.  We finally get menus and start browsing. 10 minutes later, every one is ready to order, but guess what? We still had to wait another 27 minutes for the waiter to return. Yes - Although this was a special day for me and my husband, I kept staring at my phone for the time, keeping track of it.  Finally every one gets to put in their order. My grandmother ordered their special and about 8 minutes later waiter came back and told her they were out of something from her selection and she had to choose something else. Why offer a special if you don't even have the products in stock??! Sigh! We get small appetizers 12 minutes later. Not too shabby, right? Then, we literally waited close to 40 minutes for everyone's food to arrive. And when it did, everyone's food did not arrive on time (I figured if they were taking that long maybe they were waiting to have them all ready to bring out at the same time) and some of us had to eat in front of others.  We literally had to walk around to look for a waiter (couldn't find one) and ended up at the front desk to ask for one. There was not one waiter in sight.  To make matters worse, this was on a Saturday, around 1-2pm. The place was not nearly full as I thought it would be. Yet they took so long. Some of my cousins did not like their appetizers and lost their appetite. You get where I'm going with this. They took long for everything when it was not busy AT ALL.  Most of the faulting was on the kitchen. And some on the waiter himself. This is why I hated Cheesecake Factory in the first place. Always experiencing excruciatingly annoying and bad service. So much for impressing my family in Austin. How embarrassing! Whelp."
Danielle H.,"Austin, TX",62,53,17,2.0,7/19/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite national chains. The menu is vast and the cheesecakes are scrumptious. Every time I visit this location, the service is mediocre. The bread usually comes out late and cold. It takes forever to get your entree."
Ronell B.,"Austin, TX",1,31,3,2.0,5/20/2017,This is one of those places you always end up at and always end up being disappointed.  I love the cheese cake but the food is AWFUL.  I just left and just like every other time the food was BLAND! Bland is an understatement I got the fish n chips with the hopes of playing it safe and it was so bland almost no flavor. My sisters shrimp and pineapple concoction was so bad she sent it back.  I would say I'll never be back but I'm sure someone will drag me back again and I will waste more money.
Iphone P.,"Austin, TX",0,4,1,4.0,2/8/2017,Great desserts!!!! Make the best appetizers and drinks. The happy hour food is great!  The hamburger is better than Reg menu.  Great firecracker rolls.
David T.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,131,102,1.0,2/11/2017,This place is a mess.  I'm absolutely confident that the management specifically the store manager do not care about service or quality of the food. Or they have no clue that there's a problem either way that definitely makes them incompetent of running the restaurant. Our service was really slow and the food took a long long  time to be ready.   They brought us the wrong food .  My wife's salad had bacon which wasn't supposed to and my sandwich was really disgusting.  Very disappointed and I know none of the managers care .
Priyanka J.,"Round Rock, TX",9,33,4,4.0,12/14/2016,"Great ambiance, good service and delicious food! There are many vegetarian options on the menu. My fav is sweet corn tamale cake. It is so flavorful, that I always order it.  The portion size are huge. Me and my husband ordered two appetizers to share and we couldn't finish it all for dinner! Their fresh bread is great. Overall a very good experience!"
Adrian S.,"Austin, TX",56,14,8,5.0,1/19/2017,"First time here and I was very pleased with our server Kyla! She really made our experience a memorable one. We were a little worried about the wait time because there were so many people when we arrived, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes and Kyla came right over introduced herself and asked what brought us ( celebrating husband and oldest daughters birthday). I felt that she really went out of her way to make sure they both had a amazing time and even brought over additional balloons to the ones we bought in for my daughter. When the sang happy birthday during dessert she SANG her heart out! The food was amazing and came out quickly. Definitely will ask for her next time we're here!"
Amy D.,"Austin, TX",56,228,144,2.0,3/14/2016,"The cheesecake is good, but that's about it.  I went there recently for one of my favorite things: artichoke appetizer. Much to my dismay, they no longer offer that item. I decided to try the spicy shrimp appetizer instead. That was a big mistake. I should've just walked away.  Along the lines of disappointment, the mojito I had that day was a huge disappointment. The mint and lime weren't really muddled into the drink. That made the drink basically a soda drink. What a downer.  I won't be back to eat at Cheesecake Factory again. If I ever have a craving for cheesecake, I'll get takeout."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,4.0,6/22/2015,We came in out of town since I had an appointment to go to in Austin.  Got there around 2pm and was sat down quickly. We ordered a couple appetizers and two lunch places.   I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu - steak medallions with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My hubby got the Chicken Bellagio - basil pasta topped with arugula salad.  He wanted to try something different from what he usually would order at a restaurant and i suggested that.  He loved his meal.    The fried calamari was delicious and my hubby loved the crab artichoke dip.   My steak medallions were cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. Our service was friendly and the food came out fast.
Bob H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,14,,5.0,12/26/2016,Went out with relatives on Christmas Eve and was reminded what an excellent place this is for special occasions. I had the Miso Salmon and it was delicious and the filet tender. Topped it off with a cherry cheesecake that hit the spot. This place is a bit pricey so here are a couple of tips. The lunch menu is served until 5 pm so come early and save money. The other tip is you'll have quite a wait if you show up at peak times so you now have a second reason to get there early.
Amanda S.,"Austin, TX",1069,644,5670,2.0,3/10/2015,"It was a friend's birthday and she wanted to have her birthday dinner at Cheesecake factory.  I knew I was in, but wasn't too excited.  I wasn't sure why.  I had been to Cheesecake Factory 2 other times - once in Hawaii with my family and once in Dallas with a large group of girls.  The only thing memorable from those 2 experiences was that I recall their portions being HUGE.  We had a party of 12 and had to wait about 30 minutes or so.  We went over to the bar and ordered drinks.  I ordered the Blueberry Mojito ... mistake on my part.  It was way, way too sweet.  It was really pretty though.  It was also an $11 drink ... a little pricey I think.  We finally got seated.  The service was pretty good from our server.  He never let anyone's water glass get empty, which I always appreciate.   Steve H and I decided to share the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  We knew that these would not be traditional Thai style but we were ok with that.  Steve H had done some research before hand and found that this is supposed to be one of the better dishes offered here.  Oh and by the way not only are the portions huge, but the menu is huge as well.  There are just so many options it is honestly a daunting task to look over the menu fully and make a decision on what to eat.  When our lettuce wraps got delivered they were on a huge plate.  My first thought was where is the chicken?  There was hardly any chicken on the plate for the plate to be so big.  I would have enjoyed my lettuce wraps a bit more if they had more protein in each wrap.  They were mostly veggie wraps with a bit a chicken.   Finally we got to the end of the meal and I was excited for my cheesecake - because who isn't at the cheesecake factory??  I went with the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.  It was definitely the highlight of my meal.   My friend next to me got the BBQ chicken salad she said it was ok, but the BBQ sauce was a little over powering.  I also tasted a Cuban egg roll or something and it was not good at all.   So overall my experience here was - meh.  Will I go back?  Probably not unless it is someone's birthday again."
Alyssa G.,"Cedar Park, TX",16,41,62,5.0,3/5/2016,"Came here Saturday night ! 20 minute wait for 2 people kind of long !  We were seated our waiter was Carlos he was friendly energetic he brought out our drinks promptly and checked on us regularly.  We started with the Peach Bellini always made amazingly  We ordered the buffalo blast per usual The chicken quesadilla, and fries no salt.  Everything came out hot and cooked perfectly!  Which is always the best part.  We were to full for any cheese cake but next time we will save room!  Great service, great food, great atmosphere,  Only con the wait for 2! Ask for Carlos when you go very well trained and friendly."
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,3.0,1/10/2016,"I guess I just need to get a new dish on their menu. Again the firecracker salmon rolls were out of sight, delicious. Other none cooked dishes were excellent. My blackened salmon was not warm and not blackened. My rice was again horrible, horrible, horrible. Their rice cooker is broken. The rice cooker does not work. Some of the grains of rice were hard. The rice cooker needs repair. I refuse to get salmon again. I refuse to get any dish with rice.  My meal was just ruined. This is a fixable problem. Get a new rice cooker."
Mallori B.,"Cameron, TX",28,60,19,4.0,5/1/2017,"Food was great as always. Service was a bit slow considering it wasn't super busy, but staff was friendly and smiled."
Bill J.,"Austin, TX",104,106,16,2.0,8/30/2016,"Food was really good, but the service is horrible. You would think with the amount of employees standing around the service would be a lot better. It should not take an hour to get your food order. Cocktails took about 25min. This was on a week night when they weren't very busy.  Food 4/5 Bar service 2/5 Table service 2/5"
A R.,"Bastrop County, TX",1,305,1137,2.0,1/31/2016,I haven't had a meal in years @  this place.  Sunday afternoon 12.20.15 I got back there with the Wife.  She and I were spending time in Austin and dropped in for a bite.   I dropped my Wife off at the door and searched for a space.  It took ten minutes and I found one. God I don't recall it being so crowded in the plaza.  It'd been 7 years since we last dined here.  I made it in and my Wife had our table.  She and I were seated on the backside of the restaurant in a dirty bench.  We sat across from a family that seemed to really enjoy their food.   We ordered the buffalo blast appetizers. I hadn't eaten them in years and they were good.  My Wife ordered the grilled pork chop and I the chicken bellagio. It was way more food than we needed on top of the apps. We waited at least twenty five minutes to get our food.   My Wife said the flavor of her dish wasn't to good.  I'm not sure she made it through a third of her dish.  I remember her mashed potatoes were quite lumpy. I enjoyed my salad on my dish.  The chicken patties were not seasoned well.  The basil pasta wasn't too bad just overkill.   Over priced e overrated and just plain over going to eat here again. Not looking to going back again.
