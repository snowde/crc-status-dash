Laurie S.,"Austin, TX",4,36,,4.0,7/30/2012,"MMMmmm,  Had the nicest lunch.  The pasta carbonara was so good, nice clean restaurant, staff was friendly and efficient.  my 3 daughters and I shared a slice of triple layer oreo for dessert and it was plenty for all.  we had a really good time."
Nathan S.,"Austin, TX",3,24,,2.0,10/13/2011,"I've heard about this place so many times, I finally decided to give it a go. No bueno, translation, not good. The steak was extremely tough, the jambalya had noodles......really.....noodles? Rice is the norm with Jambalya, just ask BJ's Brewery...haha. Friendly service, below average food though. AND....what's up with the wait staff wearing all white? Maybe I'm just not experienced in the ways of Cheesecake. You be the judge."
Chris A.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,3.0,6/28/2014,"Went here with a big group, wasn't a good idea. They were not prepared to handle a group of 25+. Service was very slow. Once we did get food it was good but not spectacular. The best part was the unlimited strawberry lemonades while waiting."
Too Cool For School G.,"Austin, TX",10,28,10,1.0,8/6/2011,"BULLET POINTS:  - Far too expensive considering their now only-okay food  - Snotty and frigid morons on staff, almost exclusively  - WONDERFUL tropical iced tea (if they still have it)  - Excellent (if vastly overpriced) cheesecake  - NOT WORTH THE COST OR THE WAIT Flashback to 2005.  I was newly transplanted to our first apartment in Austin, hubby's lifetime home minus his stint in the Air Force.  While looking for a nice place to celebrate our move, we came upon the Cheesecake Factory.  We went in with our two children, and proceeded to have the most expensive meal we had ever eaten in our married lives.  But it was worth every single PENNY!  The food was incredible, the tea was amazing, and the service was exceptional.  And that was then. Flash forward to 2007, the last time I set foot inside what I have come to refer to as the Asshole Factory.  I had just gotten off of work, and our tax refund had come in that afternoon.  Naturally, we were all very hungry and looking to enjoy a great meal as a family.  We met up with my sister in law there at 4:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and were greeted by a surprisingly large crowd of folks waiting to be seated.  We were told that the wait for a table would be about 30 minutes, which we deemed acceptable.  So we sat down.  And as we sat, the crowd around us dwindled slowly.  Then, folks started showing up who were arriving more than 20 minutes after us.  Guess who got seated right away without a reservation?  EVERYONE who arrived after we did!  Since our 30-minute wait had elapsed, we went back to question the frigid bitch of a hostess who had quoted us that wait time.  She said that it was getting to be peak time, and was probably going to be over 20 more minutes.  (In spite of the fact that the assholes who got there less than 5 minutes ago, with parties the same size as or larger than ours, were being seated ahead of us?  Yeah.)  We had waited for an hour when I finally got super pissed off and demanded to see the manager.  The manager said that we should have made a reservation when showing up at peak times.  When I informed him that peak times didn't include 4:30 in the afternoon, he got that snooty ""I think I would know"" look on his face and pretty much dismissed us entirely.  (At least, that was the vibe I got from his turning around and walking away before I was finished talking to his sorry ass.)  I turned to hubby and told him that we were leaving.  Made sure the hostess was watching as I smashed that stupid pager to shreds and tossed it in the garbage.  Went across the parking lot to Serrano's and had a much more palatable meal in less time than we had waited to be seated at the Asshole Factory.  Don't waste your time...they wouldn't know customer service if it kicked them in their holier-than-thou asses.  (And oh, how I wish it would!!!!)"
Sarah Z.,"Austin, TX",27,140,3,2.0,12/10/2011,ordered the pasta da vinci to go. Came out in a BIG but extremely shallow container. It was ok till I tasted something I can chew. It was a big chunk of onion skin. hehehe.... also there is no more than five pieces of chicken for the dish. portion is overall small.  and it costed $20!!!!
Mrs. M.,"Austin, TX",0,82,4,2.0,1/3/2014,"I have eaten here many times and it is nothing special for the cost of an arm and a leg.  The menu is, indeed, overwhelming and you can't get through it in one night, so you might do well to choose a ""favorite"" if you are thinking of returning.  The cheesecake, itself, is pretty good (the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is my personal top choice) but did you know you can buy a whole one at Costco or Sam's or wherever for, like, half the price?  Buy the plain and add your own toppings and save yourself the trip.  The wait is almost always long.  I have to use the light from my phone to see my food.  And they fail to mention that when your selection from the children's menu can include juice, the orange juice will cost you an additional $3 because it is ""fresh-squeezed.""  What that means is it is a $3 glass of pulp with seeds.  My daughter didn't even drink it, and thus we avoided a potentially hazardous situation.  Many better restaurants to choose from in this city, so take your pick."
Gus S.,"Round Rock, TX",37,22,29,4.0,2/3/2010,"The food was great, as usual and as expected. The service is what really set this meal apart. Near the end of the meal, my wife asked about ""the song"" and Alex told her - ""we don't have a song, but we DID write you a poem!"" He then proceeded to read a nifty little poem about teaching Amy, having fun and serving us. It totally capped the meal and service experience, and it did SO many other things. I wish I could get it and post it here. Alex, if you ever read this and still have it... Alex showed Amy that having fun with customers is ok, even acceptable. I've trained trainers for years and would hire him to train in one of my own organizations. He led by example, and also gently allowed Amy to do her job, albeit still only her first day in the ""real"" world. Amy shined as well, being very honest and personable, chatting with us about whatever we asked openly and candidly. They got the order right, gave us suggestions, and didn't make any strange judgments about us sharing - not always the case, by the way. Of course, I have no idea how a single human could eat that much food... but that is another posting."
Crystal A.,"Austin, TX",214,226,15,3.0,9/7/2009,"My boyfriend and I couldn't really decide on what we wanted for dinner, so we tried the Cheesecake Factory. I've heard good and bad things; mostly mediocre. We got there and the place is HUGE. LOUD. The menu went on for days, and all I could think was ""I am not going to order strawberry lemonade or popcorn shrimp."" Andre 3000 would have been proud. We both enjoyed the avocado eggrolls, that tasted like more than just avocado. Both of us were ""eh"" about our pasta entrees. For one thing, Are you serious about charging $13 for angel hair pasta, garlic, olive oil, maybe 1/4 of a tomato, 4 mushrooms and 2 sliced up pieces of asparagus? I understand charging $4 for 4 shrimp, but please be a little bit more liberal with your veggies. We boxed up half of our dinner (which I still have not eaten, 3 days later), and opted for dessert. It's the Cheesecake factory, right? My boyfriend's banana creme cheese cake was really great, but my Caramel Turtle Cheesecake was WAY TOO SWEET. It would have been MUCH better with a plain cheesecake between the brownie like crust, and the giant blob of fudge icing. If we go here again, it'll just be for dessert."
David H.,"Austin, TX",2,8,,5.0,7/3/2011,"Food, service and ambiance were great.  I know it is a chain, but it is just great every time."
Kimberly K.,"Austin, TX",498,277,51,4.0,8/16/2008,"Seven months pregnant and craving artichoke dip, my friend said the health of her child depended on her eating this specific dip within the hour. Pregnant women can be dramatically urgent for good reason. Heavy with impending child, she ate all but one bite of the large spinach artichoke dip and then wolfed down the Chicken Marsala.  The one bite of the dip that I was able to try was excellent - great proportions of creamy and salty.  Her chicken was tender with a hint of sweet wine. When I had first heard of this restaurant, I thought they only sold cheesecake. That is simply a serious head fake.  CHEESEFAKE. Follow the belly, not the head...with over 200 items on the menu, follow the belly, cuz it will soon be FULL...I am usually full long before the time dessert is ordered.  Their tag line is, ""Something for everyone."" Indeed.  And by ""everyone"" they mean all of humanity.  Many vegetarian items.  I nominate the Factory as the greatest place for a gathering with people who cannot agree where to go... people who do not demand fine dining and who enjoy leftovers. The Asian Steak Salad was my favorite meal but it seems that has been discontinued. On this particular day, I was the recipient of a healthy plate of comforting Meatloaf and mashed potatoes - three large slices of loafed meat that were prepared in a very traditional manner. Meatloaf by nature is kind of a dull meal... and this version did not disappoint. The mashed potatoes were white and buttery. My friend chose the right place for her craving.  She was eating for two.  Not long after this dinner, she prematurely gave birth to a beautiful girl. I still wonder if the meal helped to push the little one out early."
Pitman B.,"Austin, TX",0,16,,1.0,10/28/2013,My wife and I went there for dinner. She ordered meatloaf and I ordered fish and chips.  Meatloaf sucked and fish was greasy.  Will never go back.
Heather B.,"Hutto, TX",0,53,,4.0,2/16/2012,"This is the place to go for big groups! I came with a party of 20+ people the other day, Half of which were children. They seated us quickly and at a perfect spot to accommodate 5 high chairs. My kids loved the food and I'm a fan of their drinks. We all were able to hang out for 2 1/2 hours enjoying ourselves. Food portions are very large. The menu is large and I found it a bit overwhelming, but I'm just simple haha! I couldn't figure out what to order. My only REAL complaint is the calorie content of their foods. I can eat nearly 2 days worth of calories in 1 meal here! But who goes out to a place called The Cheesecake Factory if they are counting calories anyway?"
Mina C.,"Austin, TX",6,28,,2.0,6/6/2009,"I have visited this place on and off since it opened here, and this location has always given me horrible waitstaff. Another horrible moment was when I phoned in a to-go order and had someone go pick it up after fifteen minutes had passed, forty five minutes later and numerous phone calls from me trying to find out what happened to my disappearing food, I told him to just come home. We gave the place one last shot last month, the service was so horrible we went ahead and left before ordering our meals. Calls to management have seemingly fallen on deaf ears, they just didn't care about our business I guess. Several times I have been brought undercooked chicken, and once I had to return my bolognese pasta due to a sand-like crunchiness that was due to some error the management explained to me, although I've forgotten the reason. Funny thing was when I had mentioned the texture the response of my waiter and the staff was dubious and even patronizing until I made them taste it. Like I would complain for the fun of it. The carabonara pasta is too dry, the meatloaf doesn't taste like meatloaf per say, and while I love some lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, I don't feel it's worth $9 a slice. (the puree is extra)"
Christian H.,"Austin, TX",26,56,,3.0,1/6/2009,"Despite good company, this place was a bit underwhelming.  The menu appears like a Greek diner menu (pages and pages) till you realize half of it is advertisements. That said they have a huge menu, and I'm told some items are better than others.  The atmosphere is a bit odd. Low lighting the floods every corner of the room and high ceilings with weird faux architecture. The light is supposed to be intimate and romantic I suppose, but it just makes it hard to see in a weird dusky sort of way.  I had a spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. Very nice cuts of chicken and good lettuce, but beyond that the sandwich was just so so. The fries that came with it were laughable, but the waitress did warn me about that.  At my companions urging I tried the avocado egg rolls. I'm a fan of fusion but abhor fusion-for-fusion's-sake things, and this reeked of it. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised. The filling had great flavor and the wrappers were chewy and tasty. The tamarind/cumino sauce with them was quite nice too!  Lastly the cheese cake, for which the place takes it's name, was pretty mediocre. Nice presentation, but too stretchy. I prefer creamy to the cheesiness. It wasn't bad, but not revolutionary, and nothing to make me want to come back just for this, their ""specialty.""  One good note, the waitstaff was very nice and helpful (and opinionated, I like that!) so bonus points there.  This place isn't fantastic, I wouldn't go so far as to call it good. But it's definitely not bad.  I had a chicken"
Shawn H.,"Hutto, TX",8,43,,3.0,10/10/2010,"Took the wife and daughter in for a mid-week pick-me-up for the girls, and while that mission was successfully accomplished, I don't think we'll make this a regular thing. The food is quite tasty and there's a decent menu to choose from (and of of course, the cheesecake itself), but the prices are really too high for what you end up with. I could see doing this place as a date night or for those times where you just have to have gourmet cheesecake, but I'd much rather spend a slight bit more (not too much, actually, it's pretty close) and go to Melting Pot and really enjoy myself as opposed to eating a $17 plate of pasta and going ""Meh""."
John A.,"Austin, TX",0,120,53,4.0,12/8/2013,Overall great experience; would like some healthier menu options though. Most dishes are decadent and over-sized.
Sandra O.,"Austin, TX",0,24,,1.0,9/25/2013,We've been coming here for a few years now but this last time was a total disappointment. Drinks were good and service was okay. I asked our server if the cooks deveined the shrimp and he said yes. Well my shrimp was not deveined and to me that's totally gross. I come to find out the next day that my mother's and brother's salad had hair in it. They didn't complain b/c we were celebrating my birthday. One thing I will point out is if they are going to automatically add gratuity to the bill then their servers need to be trained on menu items and actually earn their gratuity and not to rely on others to do their dirty work...and come back with a bs smile with check at the end of the meal knowing they're getting a tip regardless!!!!
Rene T.,"Kyle, TX",3,14,,5.0,3/7/2014,"Went there for lunch at 1pm.  Food was great, service very helpful & responsive.  Despite yelp saying they are closed on Fridays, it was a great dinning experience and look forward to many more.  The Spicy Southwest Chilpote Chicken is devine. Yum!"
AJ E.,"Austin, TX",0,15,,4.0,1/14/2012,"I'm a huge fan of Cheescake Factories, and this one is a tad better than the rest.  It's got an immaculate interior (and exterior), the whole standard CF line-up is there, the quality is what you'd expect (especially at these prices).  I notice that presentation of your dinner varies with time and Cheescake Factories, and this one has not disappointed me yet with its subtle changes over time. One star down for the timeliness of service, which has consistently been a fault here, EVEN before/after peak hours.  We once went 15 minutes before getting our drinks in.  I'd chalk it up to bad luck, but I've been here nearly a dozen times in half a year so I wonder.  Nevertheless, the food portions, quality, and atmosphere generally make CF well worth the visit."
Jeanie D.,"Austin, TX",158,201,111,5.0,2/25/2010,"**disclaimer** i'm not writing about the service. i'm not writing about the prices. these are my staples, if/when i eat a meal here- although i usually hit them up just for dessert. i do always glance at the menu to give other/new items a chance, but there was never a chance. i love what i love. apps: -thai lettuce wraps. portions are so large, this alone can be your meal.  it seems healthy enough, although i think it's safe to assume nothing at a place called ""cheesecake factory"" can be healthy.  -chopped salad. seriously large even in appetizer size. seriously refreshing. apples, avocado, tomato, corn, chicken (hold the blue cheese and bacon, for me please) -sweet corn tamale cakes. delish! perfect variations of textures and flavors swimming around in here. entrees: -chicken marsala. (not for those who don't like mushrooms b/c they're plentiful in this dish) -thai lettuce wraps. (see above) -chopped salad. (see above) desserts: -stefanie's ultimate red velvet cheesecake. sometimes the cake layers are thinner than the cheesecake layers (boo) but still amazing and moist. -linda's fudge cake. the cake is oh so chocolate-y and moist. perfect with extra whip. the frosting is a bit much, but scrapes off easily. if only they'd replace the layers of frosting with whipped cream instead... -chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. my former flame, into my black book you go since you still cross my mind every now and then. **disclaimer** i have no idea who stefanie or linda are, but they're brilliant. i've traded in the one with the tuxedo and have found amazing replacements. it seems i have crossed over to the other side, and let me tell you, it's GOOD!!"

Shawn H.,"Hutto, United States",8,43,,3.0,10/10/2010,"Took the wife and daughter in for a mid-week pick-me-up for the girls, and while that mission was successfully accomplished, I don't think we'll make this a regular thing. The food is quite tasty and there's a decent menu to choose from (and of of course, the cheesecake itself), but the prices are really too high for what you end up with. I could see doing this place as a date night or for those times where you just have to have gourmet cheesecake, but I'd much rather spend a slight bit more (not too much, actually, it's pretty close) and go to Melting Pot and really enjoy myself as opposed to eating a $17 plate of pasta and going ""Meh""."
John A.,"Austin, United States",0,120,53,4.0,8/12/2013,Overall great experience; would like some healthier menu options though. Most dishes are decadent and over-sized.
Sandra O.,"Austin, United States",0,24,,1.0,25/9/2013,We've been coming here for a few years now but this last time was a total disappointment. Drinks were good and service was okay. I asked our server if the cooks deveined the shrimp and he said yes. Well my shrimp was not deveined and to me that's totally gross. I come to find out the next day that my mother's and brother's salad had hair in it. They didn't complain b/c we were celebrating my birthday. One thing I will point out is if they are going to automatically add gratuity to the bill then their servers need to be trained on menu items and actually earn their gratuity and not to rely on others to do their dirty work...and come back with a bs smile with check at the end of the meal knowing they're getting a tip regardless!!!!
Rene T.,"Kyle, United States",3,14,,5.0,7/3/2014,"Went there for lunch at 1pm.  Food was great, service very helpful & responsive.  Despite yelp saying they are closed on Fridays, it was a great dinning experience and look forward to many more.  The Spicy Southwest Chilpote Chicken is devine. Yum!"
AJ E.,"Austin, United States",0,15,,4.0,14/1/2012,"I'm a huge fan of Cheescake Factories, and this one is a tad better than the rest.  It's got an immaculate interior (and exterior), the whole standard CF line-up is there, the quality is what you'd expect (especially at these prices).  I notice that presentation of your dinner varies with time and Cheescake Factories, and this one has not disappointed me yet with its subtle changes over time. One star down for the timeliness of service, which has consistently been a fault here, EVEN before/after peak hours.  We once went 15 minutes before getting our drinks in.  I'd chalk it up to bad luck, but I've been here nearly a dozen times in half a year so I wonder.  Nevertheless, the food portions, quality, and atmosphere generally make CF well worth the visit."
Jeanie D.,"Austin, United States",158,201,111,5.0,25/2/2010,"**disclaimer** i'm not writing about the service. i'm not writing about the prices. these are my staples, if/when i eat a meal here- although i usually hit them up just for dessert. i do always glance at the menu to give other/new items a chance, but there was never a chance. i love what i love. apps: -thai lettuce wraps. portions are so large, this alone can be your meal.  it seems healthy enough, although i think it's safe to assume nothing at a place called ""cheesecake factory"" can be healthy.  -chopped salad. seriously large even in appetizer size. seriously refreshing. apples, avocado, tomato, corn, chicken (hold the blue cheese and bacon, for me please) -sweet corn tamale cakes. delish! perfect variations of textures and flavors swimming around in here. entrees: -chicken marsala. (not for those who don't like mushrooms b/c they're plentiful in this dish) -thai lettuce wraps. (see above) -chopped salad. (see above) desserts: -stefanie's ultimate red velvet cheesecake. sometimes the cake layers are thinner than the cheesecake layers (boo) but still amazing and moist. -linda's fudge cake. the cake is oh so chocolate-y and moist. perfect with extra whip. the frosting is a bit much, but scrapes off easily. if only they'd replace the layers of frosting with whipped cream instead... -chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. my former flame, into my black book you go since you still cross my mind every now and then. **disclaimer** i have no idea who stefanie or linda are, but they're brilliant. i've traded in the one with the tuxedo and have found amazing replacements. it seems i have crossed over to the other side, and let me tell you, it's GOOD!!"
