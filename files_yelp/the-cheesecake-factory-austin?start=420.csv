Shweta S.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,6,,1.0,11/10/2013,"This place was one of our favorites! Until today afternoon,where we got the most horrendous service. We had our dog along so I give them some points for letting us sit on the patio.We were waiting for our friends and were told that until we order the food they cannot get us the breads..REALLY! You loose 5 pts straight for hospitality there! Then one of the servers dropped some plates wit food on it and it splashed all over 3 of my friends clothes..mistakes do happen..so I ignored that..our waitress turns up wit our water and has disappeared for a good half an hour until she gets bk to us to get our drink orders. Food was OK. It was my Hubby's bday so I asked if they wud do a complimentary cheese cake as they had done it previously on my bday as well as for a friend. The waitress point blank told us they can't do it any longer as they can't afford it..then one of my friends cheesecake had a hair stuck in it!! So much for paying $4**! When I pay that kinda money I expect to be treated well!! Cheesecake ppl better train ur staff in hospitality management! Its sad that I'll think twice before going there again!"
Bobbyray D.,"Austin, TX",4,20,,5.0,12/6/2010,"I would  sell your whole family on the black market  just to eat here for a month... the food is intoxicating the dessert intensely soothing and decadent on your palete.... again i say."" Yes ! I would indeed i will... and watch your ass, cause i will gag you and sell you and the cash will go to an amazing meal at cheese cake factory"
Holmes S.,"TX, TX",0,94,9,4.0,3/22/2008,"Everyone is bashing this place..  One person complained of a huge family in front of them taking a long time to order a cheese cake.. this has nothing to do with the restaurant.  One person complained that they felt ill the next day because they ate so much... this is your own fault for being a greedy cow.  The rest are complaining that it is a chain. They are probably writing this on their Apple laptops in Starbucks. If chains bother you, don't eat in them! Big chains are surviving because people are eatting there!  Ok, now for my review! The portions are huge, the food takes pretty good. Yes there are Ads in the menu, which is a little weird. Taking one star off for that. I had shepherds pie which was good, but of course not near English standards. I enjoyed it."
Camron R.,"Austin, TX",398,295,19,2.0,12/9/2007,"You would like to think a place that charges more than $10 for a cheeseburger could afford to wipe up the grease off the floor. We waited around for nearly an hour to get a table. I ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. It was about the size of my head. Getting a hamburger that size is just ridiculous. You can't even open your mouth that wide. I would have much rather paid less and had a reasonable portion of food. You can't take home a half-eaten hamburger with soggy bread and heat it up later and eat it.  Everyone's food was in stupidly, gargantuan portions. Ruben Studdard would have gotten a doggy bag.  I might have liked this place when I was 15 and I could eat until I made myself sick and my dad was paying for it. Now, I think I'll stick to something more practical."
Lawrence L.,"Austin, TX",41,143,76,4.0,7/6/2010,"you know, i'd forgotten how much i liked the cheesecake factory.  it's an easy place to forget, with so many other fine establishments in austin.  also it's not a very *cool* type of place to go to.  for example, if in conversation you mention to a foodie of higher taste that you went to the cheesecake factory for dinner last night you would 8 times out of 10 receive in return a look of derision and pity.  just because it's a chain.   i say forget the h8rs.  the prices are fair, the portions are huge, and it's tasty! so it might be loaded with oil and fat.  don't go every night.  if you're me you order the iced tea, it's sooo good.  i like it because it's strong and not bitter.   this time i ordered something i'd never had before:  i don't remember the name, but it was basically two pieces of chicken piccata topped with prosciutto served over a linguini covered with alfredo sauce.  it was delicious.  the prosciutto wasn't mind-blowingly good (to be expected) but it wasn't terrible either.  it was a very satisfying meal to have with 8 other friends on a late sunday night (bonus points! open til 11pm on sunday!) because i could go at my pace since the dish was so large there was no way i was going to finish.  so i guess the answer to the question ""how can you go to the cheesecake factory and not order cheesecake"" can be answered with ""if the entree is really really large""."
Kelli E.,"Austin, TX",10,21,,1.0,10/10/2013,"So disappointing since this use to be one of my favorite restaurants. We came in May and it was fantastic. This time, my husband got a burnt burger and our appetizer was these chicken bites that were mostly bread and no chicken. I got the chicken Madeira (the usual) and it was ok but the potatoes had huge chunks in it and was not mashed very well. They ran out of 4 different types of cheesecakes, so apparently we got ripped off and got the tiniest piece ever. (I guess they were worried about running out of that particular flavor, not my problem but to give me a a size that I can eat in two bites...Your FAULT. It takes a lot for my husband not like a restaurant but this one did it for him. We won't give up on the Cheesecake factory but this location, were done. You pay a higher price to eat here so I expect better quality food. It's not like paying for Apple bee's although the food would of tasted better than this crap."
Nicole J.,"Seattle, WA",16,38,,5.0,5/19/2010,"The food is to die for. If you have never been the Cheesecake Factory literally has a menu the size of a book. They have something for every price range, everything is delicious, and everything is a really good size so you always get your moneys worth. The decor is beautiful with some of the highest ceilings I have ever seen and the staff is always so friendly. We went their on Mother's Day and our waiter was attentive, had great suggestions for food and when we mentioned coming there for our rehersal dinner he immediately went and spoke to the manager and got a card for us. I have always loved this place and for good reason. And no matter how full you are, get some cheesecake, even to go. You wont regret it. Even ""non cheesecake people"" love their cheesecake. AMAZING."
Naomi H.,"Soldotna, AK",11,80,10,2.0,12/4/2010,"What can I say? It's a Cheesecake Factory. The food is greasy, the cheesecake is awesome, and the service is crappy. I still go because I am in love with the banana cream cheesecake."
John B.,"Dripping Springs, TX",25,173,13,5.0,7/13/2007,"I'm probably alone in this but I don't care about decor or menu marketing.  I go to a restaurant to eat.  I don't go to be seen, site see, because it is trendy or what is hot.  I go to eat.  I want good food and I want what I pay for.  I hate french/european poser places with micro portions and astronomical prices.  I've eaten in those places and this is not one of them. If that is your thing then this is not for you.  If I go to a place more than once it is because I like the food and I get my money's worth.  As others have said here the portions are huge.  Yes the menu is full of advertisements.  I don't eat menus, I don't pay attention to the ads.  I have yet to find a restaurant that I could eat the decor, so guess what else I don't care about.  The service is great and I don't mind paying for it. The food here is superb.  I love the ""SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS"".   I recommend the ""PEAR AND ENDIVE SALAD"".   Give the ""MISO SALMON"" a try you will not be disappointed.   I like the ""SHEPHERD'S PIE"", but it is not done in a traditional style, but is tasty none the less.   I cannot over recommend the ""HIBACHI STEAK"" with the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes.  The Sunday brunch is a wonderful experience.  The cheesecakes are very good to excellent and how I first experienced The Cheesecake Factory through their mail order service."

Cody R.,"Austin, TX",51,417,12,3.0,3/12/2007,"This place is good, but I have a few complaints. First, the menu is too large, it has at least 10 pages of options which is too difficult to read through. Also, the portions are ridiculous.... then they expect you to order Cheese Cake? They might as well attatch defibrillators to the end of the tables. Also, since you are at a place titles ""Cheesecake Factory"" you HAVE to order Cheesecake..... by the time you are done your stuck with a pretty large tab. The place isn't that cheap.  But the foods good!"
Edward P.,"Tucson, AZ",26,18,9,4.0,3/17/2011,"Good salad, great soup and bread. Huge portions and the cheese came was a little overwhelming with choice.  Nice server."

I also think the menu is way too extensive for what any kitchen can practically handle. If they selected one genre of food and stuck to it, they'd have the potential to be good.

Ian A.,"Austin, TX",58,94,,3.0,9/27/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Arboretum is not a place you want to spend much time in - not only is it nearly always crowded and loud, but if you're here too often you may end up looking like one of the many sad, alone, and very overweight individuals who come here to dine in solitude.

You go and know that whatever you will order will come out a certain way. Call it blandness, generic, whatever. We all have a hankering for these restaurants now and again. The Cheesecake Factory is such a restaurant. It is a very well-known national chain of restaurants. Well, it's more well known for its huge portions (and some might say, their cheesecakes) than for groundbreaking, nouveau cuisine. Although their portions are usually enough to feed a small army, they don't come cheap. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in about a year, so I decided to go check out the only one in town, which unfortunately means trekking to the Arboretum area. I wasn't very hungry and wanted something light, so I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps appetizer. There was definitely more than enough! My dining companion ordered the spicy and crispy chicken sandwich. We were both really satisfied with our meals, and ended by sharing the tiramisu (the actual cake, not the cheesecake). It definitely was a ""pick me up"" of a dessert! We went on a Friday night, so predictably, there was a wait, although it was bearable. As far as restaurants go, I don't think you can go wrong, as the Cheesecake Factory offers so many options on their menu that you're bound to find something you like. Again, my only caveat is that this is not cheap dining by any means. I have dined at other locations (mostly in Boston where I used to live) and tried the bar menu. All the appetizers are priced (and portioned) less. It's a great way to try all their appetizers without spending too much. I've had dinners for under $10 just by taking advantage of their bar menu, which is usually from 4:00-6:00pm on weekdays."
Poopy P.,"Austin, TX",1,98,10,1.0,6/24/2013,"I'm not sure why you would dine here if you weren't there for some sort of event like a birthday party and just wanted to get cheap food.. the food is pretty greasy and disgusting, and I can feel myself getting fatter when I eat there."
Tri N.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,3.0,8/6/2007,"So Its been a few days since i've last written a review, No i didn't starve to death, its just hard to write a good bad review sometimes. On top of that i've been on a lean diet so i don't expect places to have the best steamed spinach or egg whites and asparagus.  Anywho, me and 19 others went to cheesecake factory to celebrate a bday. It was great that the manager was able to find us a table within 30 mins. The server was off the hook. But one thing that i really feel about the place is that the food is mediocre. Paying for good food isn't a problem, I mean it was edible but theres no ""wow"" factor. For a place that prizes themselves so much i would think they would at least have better food than cheddars but i guess i'll continue the disappointment until someone else decides to have a event here.  All in all, its hard to avoid Cheesecake factory because of its name, and great cheesecake, but don't set high expectations it'll ruin the night."

I've had dinners for under $10 just by taking advantage of their bar menu, which is usually from 4:00-6:00pm on weekdays."

Tri N.,"Austin, United States",0,18,,3.0,6/8/2007,"So Its been a few days since i've last written a review, No i didn't starve to death, its just hard to write a good bad review sometimes. On top of that i've been on a lean diet so i don't expect places to have the best steamed spinach or egg whites and asparagus.  Anywho, me and 19 others went to cheesecake factory to celebrate a bday. It was great that the manager was able to find us a table within 30 mins. The server was off the hook. But one thing that i really feel about the place is that the food is mediocre. Paying for good food isn't a problem, I mean it was edible but theres no ""wow"" factor. For a place that prizes themselves so much i would think they would at least have better food than cheddars but i guess i'll continue the disappointment until someone else decides to have a event here.  All in all, its hard to avoid Cheesecake factory because of its name, and great cheesecake, but don't set high expectations it'll ruin the night."
