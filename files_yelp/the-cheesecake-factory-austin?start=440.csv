Barron F.,"Cedar Park, TX",130,85,3,4.0,5/1/2006,"Consistently good food, large portions, and friendly staff. I have had the meatloaf sandwich for lunch, and it was fantastic! It was piled high with fried onions and mashed potatoes; definitely want to eat with a fork and knife. Before the meal, they serve really delicious bread and butter. I recommend the Tons-Of-Fun Burger which is one of the best burgers I have ever had. It cost's about $10, but it's worth it, at least once in a while! Overall, the price for a meal seems a little expensive, but when you consider that you will probably only eat half of it and take the rest home, it turns out to be a good deal. Oh, the cheesecake is great too. :)"
Shasha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,279,7,1.0,7/13/2007,"It's a chain, so you've probably been to one before.  So I don't have to tell you that the portions are gargantuan,and that you'll wait FAR too long in order to eat overpriced mediocre food. Some other things that really bother me are the ad placements in the menu, and well, the menu in general.  Especially the fact that the menu would be better classified as a short novel. I dislike anywhere that adamantly refuses to do half-portions.  What a rip."
Steve L.,"Round Rock, TX",2,18,1,3.0,1/25/2010,"Quick review: I'll probably update this again after future visits, but this is based on 4 of us stopping by for some appetizers in the mid-afternoon on Sunday.   First of all, the 3-star rating is based on what others had in our group.  Also, the excellent service helped bring up my rating decision.  As anybody who has visited can validate, the restaurant is clean, neat and comfortable.   So...what did I have that pulled the score down?  I had the ""Factory Nachos with Spicy Chicken""  Yeah, I know...""what were you thinking having nachos at a Cheesecake Factory?""  However, this was the listing on the menu that caught my eye and the recommendation by the waiter that these are not your ""average nachos"" with cheese sauce, etc.  Little did I know that, indeed, these were not average...they were well below average.  Chips were plentiful although moderately stale; toppings were meager...including the ""spicy chicken"" which added ~$1.50 to the cost.  Shortening the story: Don't order these...stick with other options. On positive side, one of our party ordered the ""Tex Mex Eggrolls"" and thoroughly enjoyed them. The other two split an order of Fish Tacos and also raved about them. Believe it or not...none of us had cheesecake.  We could have gone to Sorrento's across the parking lot and a) saved money and b) had the same or better Mexican appetizers. As noted above, I'll update this review after our next ""true"" visit to the CF."
T S.,"Austin, TX",22,34,,5.0,12/16/2012,Awesome food! Incredible atmosphere! Pretty reasonably priced for the portions! I love this place!
brook s.,"Austin, TX",19,83,,1.0,10/30/2009,"if i ever come to power, this chain will be the first to fall. cheesecake factory is unfortunate.   two of its locations ate two of my favorite places (arbor theater, and orange julius), and the times that i have eaten here were lackluster in the extreme. there is so much other food in austin, ever north-west austin, that there is no excuse for anyone eating here."
Laura D.,"Cedar Park, TX",5,17,,4.0,9/7/2010,"Good service , great food!  Couldn't have been happier with our meal and service."
John P.,"Austin, TX",1,100,2,3.0,7/9/2007,"We ended up at Cheesecake Factory because we wanted to goto Barnes and Nobles next door and I couldn't find my way out of the parking lot maze so we settled for Cheesecake Factory.  Not to say Cheesecake Factory is bad, just not what we intended on. So when we first sat down we got a very grumpy waitress.  She brought our water and then she disappeared.  5 minutes later we got a much cheerier waitress who took our order and got use some of that delicious table bread.  The bread we got was probably the best I've ever had at a Cheesecake factory.   So we ordered lunch salads and they eventually arrived.  My wife got the Market salad which she's had many times at other cheesecake factories.  Unfortunately when it arrived it looked like a used salad.  Most of the greens were wilted and it looked like most of the good bits had been picked over.  It was really a bit disgusting.  My chopped salad was very good however.   So we spoke to the manager and he gladly removed the salad from the bill and offered us free desert but we declined.  His very generous solution and willingness to fix thing is why they get 3 stars instead of 2, because the food alone would have gotten 2. You should never let a salad like the one my wife got leave the kitchen, it was just gross looking."
m l.,"Austin, TX",0,50,175,2.0,7/2/2008,"High prices, average food, below average cheesecake - that pretty much sums up this place.  In my view, a place that has cheesecake in its name damn better have the best cheesecake in town ; well this place certainly doesn't.  the cheesecake portions are SMALL,  the texture not firm enough and the prices are HIGH. As for menu items, all the things i have eaten have been average in quality and high in price. lots and lots and lots of better places to eat in austin than this chain."
Wendy C.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,2,,1.0,9/16/2012,"We came here to celebrate our friend's birthday here. It took them forever to serve the bread and when one of us asked for another basket of bread, it never came. They also messed up my order on top of the long wait. Since it was our friend's birthday, I asked one of the waiters if the restaurant does anything special for the occasion. They told me that they serve the birthday boy/girl a cheesecake with birthday decorations, BUT they did not say they were going to charge us for that cheesecake anyway. I thought that was shady move and just because we already have to pay a fixed amount of tip (since we had a large party) does not mean that the the service can be bad. Overall, I would never recommend this place to anyone, especially for a large party or for an important celebration such as someone's birthday. And I would never come here again."
Nickie G.,"Nashville, TN",743,1135,11,3.0,4/19/2009,"You already know two things when you walk into a Cheesecake Factory.  First, you will take a year to decide what you want because they have so many options.  Second, you will get so much food that you cannot possibly finish it all.  These are just givens.  So I was surprised and pleased to notice that they have a new menu separate from the usual menu (yeah, like you need ANOTHER two pages of choices right?!).  This menu is made up of smaller portioned appetizers, salads, and entrees.  The waitress told us for the salads the portions were somewhere between the regular portions and the lunch portions.  So still, a lot of food, but not just out of control.  I opted for a salad - the Luau.  It had grilled chicken, greens, cucumbers, red and yellow peppers, green beans, mangos, macadamia nuts and sesame seeds with a vinaigrette dressing.  The lunch portion is what I ordered and it was just right...I had a little left over, but not a lot.  Throw in a couple of pieces of their dark bread and it was a perfect light lunch.  Our waitress was friendly, she was quick with the diet coke, and she gave us some good information about the menu items and sizes of those items.  Overall it was an alright lunch, not bad.  I don't crave the Cheesecake Factory (maybe because I don't like cheesecake) but I won't bitch too much if you want me to go to lunch with you there sometime."
Sajang Y.,"Austin, TX",1,17,,2.0,11/16/2012,"This place serves horrible food. Once I ordered Angel hair with Shrimp, and the dish was cold and the sauce was not enough to mix with the pasta. The pasta became a big chunk and barely edible. I won't go again."
Deborah R.,"Ferndale, MI",580,385,51,4.0,1/21/2010,"Everything here was delicious. The food was so flavorful and the portions were more than adequate. I had the salmon with spinach and it was to die for. Not to mention the cheesecakes. Take your pick, theyre all great."
Leonard S.,"Austin, TX",15,93,3,2.0,9/22/2012,i couldn't believe it... i ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake to go... they gave me two little slices... really little... and they wanted $17!!!! ----- this is robbery!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sean M.,"Holland, MI",8,163,,3.0,8/14/2009,"You go here for the desert, but the food is good to.  I was a little disappointed in my Chicken in a Fry bread sandwich.  The bread was way to greasy and there wasn't allot of chicken!  The rest of my group enjoyed their meals.  You can get lunch portions ( Still big) and that way you don't go to sleep in the afternoon. I still think this is a great value since you get lots of food for the price.  Try to visit like we did in OFF hours or your wait could be very long."
Peggy G.,"Austin, TX",3,70,2,2.0,1/17/2009,"Prices too high for quality of food served. No kids menu. $10 burger tasted exactly the same as the $3 burger at Sonic. Fries are better at Sonic. Kids menu at Sonic. Best thing about it is the Cheesecake, but won't go just for that. Think I'll go have a sundae at Sonic."
Bo T.,"Austin, TX",34,18,,5.0,9/27/2010,"Please indulge me for a trip down memory lane. You see Cheesecake Factory and Bo have a long history. My first memories of the factory were sitting in the original building on my uncle's lap listening to stories of old days in the factory. Now you probably hear stories of old Austin. Well my uncle was real old Austin. Sometimes he called it Waterloo out of force of habit. He worked in the factory in its heyday. You see the Colorado river (Townlake/Ladybird Lake for the kids) has changed course significantly since before the dams were put in place. The river used to flow as the very site of the factory. The creamcheese was barreled in Philadelphia and floated down river to Austin where it was processed before going to port in Galveston for export to Europe. My uncle rarely got to eat his own cheesecake, it was too precious. The money for one cheesecake in Europe would feed the family for a couple months. Well times have changed. We don't rely on the river to bring the raw cheese. But the building is in the same location, though obviously has been updated quite a bit. I hear that some of the old form pans for turning the cheese into cakes for storage are still in use from the old days. The cakes are just a rich and just a precious but lucky Austinites now get to enjoy it, and enjoy it we do."
R. W.,"Austin, TX",17,11,,1.0,5/19/2012,"The food was so bland, even the ""signature"" dish was flavorless..... The prices were steep for the crappy flavor. Yeah you get huge portions for the price but when it sucks that's twice as much food I'll  have to force myself to eat. 10 mins after leaving with my leftovers the smell alone was making me nauseous I threw it in the trash outside Barnes and Noble.  Take a lesson from Robert Irvine- scale down the menu and make the remaining dishes delicious. This is the LAST time I eat there."
Tarana P.,"Austin, TX",6,26,,4.0,12/9/2008,"I always have a good time at this place, good reasonably priced food; I wouldn't recommend a pasta dish, not really a place to order that type of food. Salads, Pork chops or some avocado rolls are the way to go."
Autumn C.,"Austin, TX",96,154,13,4.0,1/20/2009,"My first visit to the Cheesecake Factory was back in August for my birthday and it was awesome. Then I had a little date there yesterday and I was reminded of why I liked it in the first place. We ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. AMAZING! The rolls were  light, crispy and full of flavor. The corn cakes were awesome and had the freshest avocado on them. Everything I've tried there has been pretty dang good. But I am sad to say that I am always too full to get cheesecake, which kills me because I love cheesecake! Maybe next time I'll just do dessert:)"
Pop L.,"Austin, TX",5,83,6,1.0,12/4/2008,"What happened to this place??? Cheesecake factory used to be great! I get the same entree every time, Bistro Shrimp pasta for 16.75. After leaving Moonshine grills dismal buffet on Sunday, my boyfriend and I went to Cheesecake factory. I ordered my same dish and it came out with bland creme sauce that was salted and peppered - NO GARLIC piece in site- no garlic powder even. Some arugula and that was it. The shrimp was crisp and large. They were almost salad shrimp that were just seasoned. I was appalled and deeply saddened as I drove a long way to get this great meal. I will go to the CCF in Dallas from now on."
