El b.,"Austin, TX",10,131,98,3.0,2/25/2009,"I was taken here for my birthday and it was okay.  For how much we paid, I guess I would have expected a little more.   What is really strange to me, is how all the servers wear white, but have really dirty shoes.  My pasta carbanora was yummy and my date had a kicking argula pasta. The best part of the night was the vanilla bean cheesecake, it was a winner in my book!"
Lydia D.,"Cedar Park, TX",1,3,2,4.0,1/6/2009,I just want to add a note about how amazing the KOBE BUGER is..yum...oh and the salads are HUGE! I always seem to forget to get the lunch portion. Its almost as big too! The place is huge and has tons of sitting and staff is always helpful. I don't know how they do it. But they handle big crowd so awesome. I love almost everything I have tried. The deserts are amazing. Wow... good food and tons of fun.
Vanessa B.,"Austin, TX",200,187,31,1.0,8/28/2008,"This place is the result of letting teenagers run amok as ""managers"". We came here one night when I had a hankering for cheesecake. We walked in and were aurally assaulted by Top 20 hits bellowing out from the sound system. If it's too loud you're to old? I'm too old. Music in a restaurant should be a backdrop, not the main event. We got a table and asked our server if they could turn the music down a little. Honestly, it was that loud, I'm not some crusty old lady; we had a hard time hearing each other across the table. It never happened, so we actually left, and my exact thought was, ""Eek! Methinks not."""
Amy V.,"Austin, TX",0,2,3,5.0,10/12/2011,"I really love going to this place.  Being diabetic, I never tire of the Skinnylicious grilled chicken (substituting spinach for the rice) and their incredible low carb, splenda cheesecake with strawberries.  It all tastes wonderful, the atmosphere is great, and it means I come out having forgotten my illness and feeling very satisfied."
Nancy C.,"San Francisco, CA",18,225,90,4.0,11/24/2008,"You know, as far as chains go, I actually do like Cheesecake Factory.  You get a lot of bang for your buck.  I like how thins one is in the middle of the Arboretum.  Service here is always friendly."
Angelina J.,"Daly City, CA",45,55,,1.0,8/28/2007,"I took one last jaunt to Texas for a possible job placement and ended up in Austin, starving and looking for a restaurant.  Unfortunately the Cheesecake Factory was it for me.  Terrible food that was overcooked and oversalted.  Whenever food is generally not fresh or poor quality, restaurants tend to over season which is what it seemed like here.  The service was fine but the meal iltself was terrible.  I thought it wasn't possible for every Cheesecake Factory to be bad.  I was beyond wrong."
S. P.,"Austin, TX",242,291,84,2.0,10/2/2007,"This is one of two places I've ever eaten that I got sick with a ""food hangover."" It should be called the Gluttony Factory. Of course, it didn't help I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience (in San Antonio) with my ex's family of gluttons. But I left feeling sick as hell. I've been  to this location twice--only because I was drug there for birthdays. The interior and ambiance are confusing--what are they going for? It just comes off kitschy and over-the-top. Neither of the two meals at this location were memorable, but it gets two stars because the lunch I had there was a saner portion and wasn't too bad. Pasta or something I think. I remember the service to be slow as hell that day though, which is fine when it means you're not at work, but the boss almost had a conniption."
Michelle C.,"Austin, TX",741,636,148,3.0,12/10/2006,"I like this place in theory, but I just never want to go.  The food is good, the cheesecake is amazing, but I'm just not into battling huge crowds and waiting for an hour or more for a table to spend a bunch of money on a meal at a chain restaurant when Austin has SO much to offer in terms of local restaurants that serve fabulous food at reasonable prices.  We do sometimes swing by there to pick up cheesecake to go for dessert at home with friends, but after eating at the restaurant a couple of times, I lost interest in that and haven't been back."
Matt S.,"Austin, TX",208,362,34,2.0,7/24/2007,Huge menu and giant portions for a high price. I had found one dish I really liked called the Chino Latino Steak (something like that).. it was really good so they took it off the menu.. For the price it just isn't good enough to keep coming back when there are so many other interesting and good restaurants in town..
Michelle L.,"Austin, TX",8,12,8,1.0,6/21/2011,"Poor table cleaning.  I saw an employee place a stack dirty dishes and glasses on a serving tray, pull a wash cloth from his pocket, he washed three tables, the chair seats, booth seats, and then immediately put clean plates and silver ware directly on the tables he had just wiped with the wash cloth.  He never washed his hands.  He never sprayed anything on the table to sanitize them.  I will pass on eating here again.  I saw an employee do this last year at this restaurant too.  I'm surprised they do not have better procedures on cleaning the tables.  They definitely shouldn't place the silverware directly on the tables."
Vasudha P.,"Austin, TX",14,119,,2.0,12/26/2007,This place sucks.. the food  practically does. the wait is long. The carrot cake is awesome but I can always buy it from HEB.. so not much motivation for me to return to this place..
Toby M.,"Round Rock, TX",11,40,,3.0,9/4/2007,"Mediocre food, atrocious waits, so-so service, and expensive drinks.  The only truly redeeming qualities are their Sunday brunch, the well decorated interior and what they're famous for.. cheesecake.  I go when I'm in the area, but even then I'd rather go to Whole Foods and eat my weight in sprouts than forage on the food here.  Get your cheesecake, get it to go, and you'll be far happier than if you stuck around."
John B.,"Harlingen, TX",0,21,,1.0,9/12/2012,"Four of us attended the Texas state high school basketball tournament in March 2012, and recalled having a nice dinner at CF two years before. What a disaster it was this time! We each ordered something different after having a drink. My wife and I decided to split a $7 small asian salad rather than the huge $14 salad served as an entree. The friendly but untrained waiter served us the expensive one. A few minutes later while serving the first two of the four entrees, the waiter nonchalantly said to one of our friends, ""I'm sorry. We're out of the sushi."" No kidding! That was our friend's entree choice ... not an appetizer. He had to wait another 20 minutes for his entree which was served as the other three were perusing the cheesecake menu. The icing on the cake was our cheesecake order ... which was why we went there in the first place. My wife and I selected two choices in case they were out of our first choice. ""Do you have these two?"" we asked the waiter. He seemed a bit insulted, ""Of course we do. We ALWAYS have every cheesecake on the menu."" He returned 10 minutes later and said sheepishly, ""Uh. We're out of your two choices. What's your next choice?"" What a joke! We did select another cheesecake, which was tasty but pricey. We have scratched the Austin Cheesecake Factory from our dinner list when we return to Austin in October 2012 and next March. If we return to the CF it will be for a drink and cheesecake only."
anne r.,"Austin, TX",25,43,36,1.0,9/30/2009,"You really can't have your cake and eat it too... Having not been here for a few years, I now remember why I don't care for the place. We went for a ""girls"" night and to celebrate my birthday. It was a Tuesday so it was fairly slow at 5:00 but still very loud and it didn't help that although the place was close to empty we were seated close enough to look into the kitchen and across from the servers station. The call-outs on the overhead in the kitchen were disturbing enough but the constant clatter next to us was the ""icing"" on the cheesecake. I ordered a pomegranate mojito which was OK - a little too sweet, but OK. My friends were just drinking wine and beer so no real challenges there. The next obstacle is the bound book that they call a menu. Finally after reaching a decision - comes to find out that I couldn't order it the way I wanted so I opted for the eggplant sandwich and Caesar salad. The plate came heaped with lettuce heavily coated in dressing. It was so over powering I couldn't eat more than 2 bites... The sandwich was cold. The bun was way too big for the tiny 3 pieces of eggplant that was on it. There was actually more grill red onion than eggplant on the roll. (which I had also asked to be left off - why get it if you don't want to eat it?). I proceeded to eat the cheese and lack of other veggies on this $12 plate. The waiter came to clear the table and commented that it looks like I didn't like my food - I didn't. I commented on the salad and he said - yeah, I know.... What? Really?... to add more insult to the day, my friends ""insisted"" I ordered cheesecake for my birthday - after all it is the Cheesecake Factory. SO I did - and of course the one I wanted - they were out of, but he didn't tell me that until he was delivering the other two to the table. By that point I had no interest in trying to find a replacement - so stick the candle in the mojito and call it a day. Of course when the bill came, the cheesecake was still on it and had to be removed.... needless to say - If I don't go back soon - it's okay!"
Georgia K.,"Austin, TX",1,12,,2.0,3/2/2010,"On a recent visit I was so terribly disappointed with the service, the food and the watered-down wine, I called the restaurant to let them know about my experience and give them an opportunity to explain themselves.  But after they promised a replacement meal and I never got it, I see they are all talk and no action.  Their menu offerings, their managers, all of it is a show.  The only good thing at this place is the cheesecake.  It is the only reason they still exist, and why they got the stars they did from me.  A zero for food & service, a 4 for dessert, that's a two-star rating in my book.  Save yourself the disappointment, choose a better place for your lunch or dinner meal, and just come here for the dessert."
LO L.,"Honolulu, HI",94,232,23,1.0,6/10/2007,"Went here with a friend for lunch one day because the place looks curious and it was by Game Stop and I guess we were feeling masochistic since we were in the Arboretum anyway.   The interior design is tacky late-80s luxe Reno casino with the faux finishing on the walls to make them look marbled and the fake 50 foot palms.  The perfect setting to show off your Z. Cavariccis to full effect.  The food was terrible, maybe just what I ordered (chicken and biscuits), but I really should have known better than to expect something fresh from this place.  The dish was gloopy and bland and tasted like baby food that had been frozen then reheated in a microwave.   Sit down service wasn't bad but the service at the front was severely lacking.  We ordered cheesecake to go afterwards from the walk up counter and it took 30 minutes to get a slice although there was one family in front of us and 10 utterly incompetent people behind the desert counter stepping on each other's toes and playing the ""Two more minutes,"" game.  I wouldn't go there again unless I was dying of want for a cheesecake and no other restaurants in Austin were open.  The one good thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that now we have a lame little laugh when one of us says, ""Whatcha want for dinner?"" and the other suggests, ""Cheesecake Factory""."
David Z.,"Wauwatosa, WI",9,464,,3.0,7/7/2007,"I love the place because it's so goofy. Faux Egyptian mixed with Art Deco. A real caravansery. I asked a waiter what kind of decor he thought it was and he said, ""Maybe Gothic."" Ah yes. The portions are huge, so it makes sense only if you are going to take half of it home or share it. If you're taking guests, it's awkward (especially if they're from out of town). Some of the entrees are fun. Maybe it's best just to go for a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee. The variety boggles the mind."
Ruth D.,"Round Rock, TX",13,114,2,1.0,4/3/2009,"I was craving cheesecake so I was excited to see that Austin had a Cheesecake Factory. It was about dinner time and my baby had just woken up in a bad mood 'cause she was hungry. We were told it would be a 30 min wait and well.. that is like thirty years in my baby's world so that didn't work. We went somewhere else to eat ,but we did come back to get a cheesecake to take home for Mama! Ok, so there's a cheesecake counter specifically for getting cheesecakes to go and it took freakin 20 minutes to get 2 cheesecakes! No what pissed me off was the portion. I paid $16 for 2 freakin cheesecake slices and it was so small and soggy. wtf! I know damn well the portions are twice as big than what I was sold. I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii all the time when I was preggers with my daughter! The Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii is bigger and busier and yet I got my cheesecake in less then 5 min."
Stacy S.,"Austin, TX",3,2,1,4.0,3/18/2008,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time last Friday during the day.  My friend had been there before.  We had the avocado egg rolls, they were out of this world!  The sauce was delicious.....I ordered the Shepherd's Pie...it was wonderful...I got the lunch portion and it was a big serving.  I took half of it home and enjoyed it the next day!  My friend had the corn tamales and liked them a lot.  It is a bit expensive so couldn't go there often but what a treat!"
