Christine M.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/1/2017,So sick of the 5 star reviews on this location I legit waited 20 mins for a WATER! Took forever to wave down the server couldn't get his attention so I had to legit yell at him to come over as he told me to hold on. Food was okay not the best. But then we ordered a cheesecake terribly bad idea waiting another 20 mins to get it!! And then when we asked for the cheesecake for here then handed us it in a to go bag thought that was so rude. Had to ask 2 different servers for our check. Overall super slow and poor service for a place that isn't no were near packed.
H M.,"Linwood, NJ",0,15,,5.0,5/6/2017,"Been here twice now and both times the service was great and the food was delicious. They have Better Greek salad then a Greek place! Their appetizers are amazing like the mac and cheese balls, nachos, quesadilla and stuffed mushrooms. Of course you can never go wrong with their cheesecake. The cookie dough is my favorite!"
Bennet M.,"Austin, TX",224,236,423,4.0,1/4/2016,"I'm a big fan of this chain food. I know I know but I just love it! My favorite dish is the chicken pasta davinci. Gosh thinking about it makes me want to order it. This place was busy since we came here on New Year 's Eve. There was a wait time for 30 minutes but we sat at the tall tables near the bar so we waited a whopping 10 minutes  Everything went well. The food was great, the portions are even greater, but of course my service stunk. She was nice just not very attentive. Yes, they were busy but we waited 15miunutes for a drink, 15 minutes for some pan, and then not too long for our food. She forgot about us and you can tell. I saw her pass me numerous times but rarely approached our table. I was going to order wine but that would've taken longer. Just because the service wasn't all that, that pasta will still have me coming to Cheesecake Factory."
John K.,"Austin, TX",7,74,1,2.0,8/30/2016,I completely agree with bill J.   Service is horrendous.  I think we have had 1 good server out of more than 10 visits.   We enjoy the sunday brunch pancakes but now we are starting to question whether the clueless service is worth it.
Molly E.,"Lubbock, TX",125,4,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Quite disappointed in my experience or lack thereof. I was sat almost immediately in the bar area but was never approached by a waiter. Not one of the 5 who passed by, including the 1 waiting on the table next to mine, or any of the ones standing by the bar talking amongst themselves. Nobody asked if I wanted to order a drink or food for 10 minutes so I got up and left. This is the food service industry, please learn to provide good customer service."
Jasmin B.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2017,The service honestly sucks here and they need a completely new staff of waiters! They don't check up on your table frequently and one waiter forgot my to go Cheesecake that I asked for I was livid. Each time I go the service gets worse and worse.
Sharee J.,"Killeen, TX",0,8,9,5.0,3/31/2017,"Went with my girlfriends for my birthday on a Saturday, it was super packed think we waited a hour to be seated but when we did sit the food was amazing, service was good and of course the cheesecake was bomb. Look forward to going again but I live in Killeen and don't feel like driving out there. But overall it was really nice."
Jamey F.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/6/2017,Great food and our waitress was awesome! I would definitely come back again. The service was amazing.
Charles Y.,"Round Rock, TX",193,230,2269,4.0,12/27/2015,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years.  I love the fact that it is one of the few restaurants that has a wide selection of menu items, but they do everything fairly well.  Usually when restaurants have that large of a menu the food is not very good.  I can't say I've ever ordered anything at Cheesecake and felt it was bad.  I would say the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I don't feel they serve anything that knocks my socks off where I crave going to Cheesecake for a certain dish.  Sometimes the service can also be a bit on the slow side and wait times can be long sometimes.  It is a great place for large parties due to the variety on the menu though."
Adrian B.,"Lenexa, KS",1,57,129,5.0,3/19/2017,"As always, very well attended and delicious food with great environment. A lot of tablets , cool waiters and you eat what you expect"
Trip A.,"Austin, TX",186,15,1,1.0,12/24/2015,"Merry Christmas The Cheesecake Factory! this is what your crappy $12 cheeseburger looks like when we aren't actually sitting at a table with a waitress relying on a tip. that's right, i said cheeseburger, but there is no cheese. and it looks like the lettuce was wiped up off the salad bar. the onion and tomato look like they've been in the walk-in since Thanksgiving. your line must be very proud of this burger. useless. #NeverGoing and #NeverGettingTakeOutAgain "
Taylor R.,"Cedar Park, TX",240,15,1,2.0,8/4/2017,"Came here for my husbands birthday with the family on Cheesecake Day. I called ahead to make a reservation and was informed they do not take reservations. We got there an hour early to put our names in then walked across the street for some drinks (the bar was packed here). We planned on being back in a little less than an hour but called them to see if they could call us when the table was close to ready to make our way back as sometimes the wait times aren't always accurate. The hostess seemed annoyed and said just come back in 20 min. We came back and 9 of us were squished into a round booth in a back corner. I looked up and noticed everyone was sweating. I asked the waiter if the AC could be turned down and he replied, ""the ac is broken, imagine how my days been"" and walked off. Our waiter came by and let us know that the cheesecake was taking about 30 min due to the high volume. Then the waiter just stood there and then asked what Cheesecake we wanted. I said ""oh I didn't realize we were ordering that right now"", and he said ""yeah that's why I told you it was taking 30 min"" even though this was before we even ordered our entrees. My cucumber mojito just tasted like soda water. The entrees were decent. The Cheesecake was so bland. It tasted like something I could defrost from a heb freezer. So disappointed, not to mention upset that just my husband and I's ticket was over $100!"
Haitia A.,"Houston, TX",1,2,,2.0,4/6/2017,"I had some delivered to my job via Door Dash. This review is not about my experience at the resturant, but the quality of food.  I always feel like the Cheesecake factory has satisfactory desserts (hence the name of the resturant)- but the dinner... eh, not so much. I ordered the Jamaican Black pepper chicken with fried plantains, black beans (tasted canned) and rice. and pineapples? There is way too much going on. it all looked questionable before I ate it. The flavers are way off.  I had a stomach ache that lasted a week. My food was extremely heavy and if I could do it all over again - i would have ordered lighter. Next time, I'll stick to cheesecake. Thanks, but no thanks."
Maria Sonia Z.,"Austin, TX",0,11,,1.0,4/5/2017,"That was the only place I ate that day from. I was horribly sick afterwards. I tried a new dish that day. I have never gotten sick eating at TCF, I hope this never happens again. I don't think I'll eat at this location again."
Andrea S.,"Austin, TX",1,13,7,3.0,1/1/2017,"We are currently waiting on our half and half cheesecake order we put in advance, it was supposed to be ready at 10 sharp it's now 10:20 ! They really need to stay on top of there to go orders cause they didn't have ours on file ! other than that AMAZING STAFF AND AMAZING FOOD AND AMAZING CHEESECAKEEEEEE!!"
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,11/8/2014,"I feel like I was just at the Cheesecake Factory, ah yes because I was when in California visiting family! But the hubs had a $25 gift certificate so it sounded like a good lunch option.  We started out with the sausage and ricotta flatbread from the skinny menu and the ahi tuna tartar which was all my husband as I don't care for tuna. The flatbread was outstanding though! I loved the abundance of fresh herbs on top.  For our entrees we each got the lettuce tacos off the skinny menu, except he got Mexican and I got Asian. I used to order those all the time and remembered today why I stopped. They are delicious but so messy! After one bite the entire taco falls apart and the dipping juices get everywhere. Eventually I gave up and went in with my fork and knife like the lady I am.  Of course you cannot go to the cheesecake factory without ordering a slice so we shared the pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake. Yes, you read that right. Half pumpkin cheesecake, half pecan pie. Put them together and you have a magical creation of yummy."
Anna R.,"Austin, TX",10,6,,4.0,1/25/2017,My friend and I ate dinner at this location yesterday. I want to praise a manager (Toby?) for his wonderful customer service in dealing with a bad situation. When my food arrived it was not cooked (raw chicken-big NO NO). I notified the waitress of the situation and I that I would like to order something different. She took the plate away and did not offer any type of apology which was a bit upsetting. But before I knew it the manager was at our table apologizing profusely. He took care of my entire meal and offered dessert as well. I can not compliment him enough on making the situation right. 4 stars for your service Toby (??)!
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",151,218,1542,4.0,6/30/2016,"We love this place! Always so busy but on this Sat we went at 5pm and got seated within 5 min even for a party of 10. Loved our waitress! Food always takes awhile to come out here but their yummy bread n butter keeps you hanging on for the feast ahead :) We love their fries here so its so hard to not order sandwiches or burgers so as to get their fries. And they have huge and yummy sandwiches too! The Navajo burger don't have anymore :(, American, bbq ranch and Mushroom are our favorites! The chicken avocado sandwich is always a hit n soo big! Their portions are large n priced just right for that! Surprised their pizza was pretty good too! And they finally got kid's meals :) and no surprise they are delish too! They loved their fries and chicken strips (the adult portion is really good too not to mention their calamari app) mini corn dogs were a huge hit! We will definitely come back esp for parties Bc they have yummy desserts (best cheesecakes ever)as well unless you want to walk across and get some Amy's ice cream :) Beautiful place!"
Cassee A.,"Lakeway, TX",2,86,79,4.0,1/2/2016,"The prices here have skyrocketed and some really good drinks and food have disappeared from the menu but there is bound to be some good eats on their extensive menu. I opted for the chicken/shrimp Jumbalaya, while spicy, very good.  The portion is smaller than the past but that seems to be the trend over the past few years in all chains.  I also paid eight dollars for a piece of cheesecake. Overall my experience was good, friendly staff, service was good.  Prices are just too high compared to other spots with comparable food."
Kiera S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,1,1.0,3/10/2017,"Went to the cheesecake factory today. And was highly disappointed with my family's take out order.  My mother ordered the baja chicken tacos and this is what she recieved. Who thought this was ok, me and my family will take our money to the domain next time."
