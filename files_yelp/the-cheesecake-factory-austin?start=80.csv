Sharon Y.,"Austin, TX",390,77,160,2.0,5/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is an appropriate place to go to for celebrations because the atmosphere is warm and it's easy to accommodate big parties.  As for the food, it's pretty much the same at any Cheesecake Factory you decide to go to. The plates are pretty large and the quality is average -- definitely not quality food, but it suffices. The pricing is consistent with your typical dinner Italian meal, so it's not bad especially since the portions here are generally quite large.  I don't usually go here when I'm craving Italian food, but Cheesecake Factory seems to be a trademark place for celebrations. I haven't set foot in one of the branches in a while, I was excited to visit this nostalgic restaurant. I usually consider Cheesecake Factory as a 3-star restaurant, but the location in Austin seems more disappointing because of their clumsy snd disorganized service. The wait time was said to be 15 minutes but we waited for over half an hour, our server forgot to bring bread out & shoved my burning hot entree plate into my hand when placing it on the table, and by the end of our meal, everyone's water cup in my party was empty because nobody came to refill it. The food took longer than usual to come out, and when our server came to hand us a slice of cheesecake, she moved too quickly and the whip cream fell off --to which she simply said ""oh well!"" and left.  Perhaps I came on an off day, but I didn't have high expectations when coming to this restaurant. So for every person in my party to constantly bring up how dissatisfied they felt during the dinner, I'm not too sure if I'm going to be coming back to this location."
Isabella L.,"Georgetown, TX",0,10,,2.0,7/22/2017,"Ordered the fettuccine alfredo for lunch, the sauce was very heavy and after a few bites my stomach could not tolerate more (took the rest home and tried to heat it up later that evening but the grease had separated from the sauce and pasts....disgusting and inedible). My boyfriend ordered spaghetti and really had no complaints. Finished off with the salted macadamia nut cheesecake only to be disappointed because half of the slice was caramel too sweet with a think layer of nuts (for $7.50)....should've stuck to the original flavor. Waitress was actually quite rude to us, although we did leave her a nice tip. For about the same price you could dine at a much nicer, upscale restaurant like Roaring Fork or Brio."
Gerry B.,"Paige, TX",17,99,40,1.0,5/21/2016,"We eat here on a regular basis and I would mormally give them a 5-star rating, but every once in a while they drop smething off thr menu. Today I find out the last of my favorites is gone.  Grilled artichoke has been removed from the menu. Why?  Really? Probably won't be back until they bring back at least one of my favorite items..."
Gerald G.,"Arboretum, Austin, TX",0,10,1,4.0,1/4/2017,Very busy so food order was a little slow. Server stopped by our table to let us know status so that was nice.  Food was served hot when it was served.  I would go back again for sure- beautiful restaurant with great atmosphere.
Kiki Z.,"Austin, TX",0,30,8,5.0,12/24/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to dine whatever location you go to. Our experience tonight at the Arboretum was the best we have ever had!!!  The lady at the front named Arielle was cheerful and seemed genuinely happy that we came to dine there. She walked us to our table and was happy the entire time we saw her throughout our meal. Our server Kayla was just as great! She was friendly and very efficient! They both made the evening even more enjoyable with their great personalities. And of course, the entrees and Cheesecake were simply delicious!!!!!!"
Alex Z.,"New York, NY",96,70,13,3.0,12/3/2016,"Service is super bad, the staff at the cheesecake counter can't even put up a smile. They set out the one I ordered on the counter for couple mins, finally someone had been looking around put it in the bag and gave it to me, and I had to ask for fork and tissues: I love the selections of the cheesecakes but just can't stand for their service. The three stars is what they deserve only for their food."
Jeffrey A.,"Austin, TX",34,66,111,5.0,11/3/2016,"This place is an institution when it comes to a place to celebrate a special occasion with friends and family. When you come you will be enthralled with the vast selection on the menu and everyone will find exactly what they want. They are known for the expansive selection of cheesecakes but don't be misled by the name, the food is outstanding. When you are here ask for Ted. He's simply the best server I've ever encountered. His personality will make you feel like you a guest at his house. Simply put, if he's available he's worth the wait. It not easy to get a glowing review out of me since I'm normally not easy to please but with the combination of the quality of the food, the awesome server and the best desert selection you will have to try to find fault with this location."
William B.,"Ypsilanti, MI",3,23,5,5.0,8/11/2015,"I have always liked cheesecake factory for their food, but you know, I could go bankrupt if I come here once a week with family. A family of 3 could easily break $100 for dinner (plus desserts) Recently I discovered their happy hour special..... hallelujah! Smaller menu,  great price!  Their appetizers are only $5.50 - and they are the same size appetizers that you order from dinner.  Mixed drinks are also only $5.50. So, if you are on a budget.... please exploit their happy hour.  I ordered 3 appetizers, 2 mixed alcoholic drinks, 1 soda for a family of 3 - and the bills came out for under $30. We are all full, happy and satisfied without ordering desserts..... (Please tips your server for their service fairly. ... give them at least $10) Our server, Brandon was also great. He is polite, friendly, fast, efficient and quite funny. He reminds me if Mitchell from the show Modern Family.  Another advantage of coming here during happy hour, you can actually have a conversation with your family without shouting at one another due to the noise level. Oh..another one. .. you don't have to wait for 30 minutes or more just to get seated! Quick,fast and efficient! 5 star for happy hour... 4 star for regular hour."
Rose V.,"Austin, TX",37,47,15,1.0,5/13/2017,"I'm going to give this place 1 Star for their crappy service. We had a really bad server. We ordered teas and water. She brings back our tea and one water (we were a party of 3) and she forgot the sweetener. We asked her for the other 2 waters and the sweetener and guess what ? She only brought us the water. So we had to ask another employee to bring us one. She comes back one time and we weren't even halfway done when she asks if we needed anything, so far we didn't . 20 mins passed and we needed refills in our tea, she didn't come by. 5 more mins passed and still nothing. By the time she came back we had already finished our meal and stacked the plates for them to come get them, when she FINALLY comes and asks if we needed anything. We told her no, and ordered a Godiva Cheesecake to go. Here we are sitting another20 mins waiting for it and to get checked out. I've been here before and the service has never been this bad. The food was great as usual but if the service keeps being this bad I wouldn't recommend going, it's not worth it."
Keith G.,"Austin, TX",1,25,4,4.0,6/8/2016,The wait was not as long as we had anticipated. The cocktails at the bar are very overpriced but the service was great.  It's a good spot if you literally have a taste for anything. I think there are 15 pages on the menu. Just too much to absorb.  Good food though.  Food 4/5 Bar service 5/5 Table service 3/5
Nicole M.,"Humble, TX",43,134,307,4.0,2/21/2016,Came here for dinner on a Friday night and it wasn't to packed and we were seated fairly quickly. For not being to busy the wait staff took a while to help us and the food seemed to take a while to come out. I must admit they accommodated all our requests and the food was really good just slow service.
Paul W.,"Marble Falls, TX",3,46,12,4.0,10/17/2016,"Great restaurant, but kind of pricey. I enjoy eating there, but only do so on special occasions because of the price."
Susan A.,"Georgetown, TX",21,49,84,1.0,8/27/2015,"My husband and I tried this Cheesecake Factory last night and were so  disappointed with the food quality. I'm not sure we will be back. We have ate at other Cheesecake Factory's and always loved eating there... Not the case with this one. We both ordered  the California Steak Sandwich with fries, both of our sandwiches were both very greasy and the meat was real grizzly.  When you pay $12 to $13 a sandwich it should be Awesome!! Sadly ours was not.  Highlight of our experience was a glass of Sangria and the dinner bread."
Robert F.,"Austin, TX",416,80,1132,4.0,1/26/2016,"Love this place! Everyone says they hate chain restaurants but always complain about how they wish there where two of their favorite hipster spot! Chain restaurants are definitely not all the same and I can see why some are frowned upon but this particular Cheesecake Factory location is pretty good all the waiters / waitresses are usually cheerful knowledgeable and bring out the food in a timely fashion. All the food on that note is usually on point and exactly as described in their ginormous menu . I've only had one just one plate ever come out less than satisfactory. I'd say if you have a big party of people you want to take out and no one can decide what to eat after going to every local Austin restaurant on Yelp, this is a great choice because everyone will find something they will like. Plus if you aren't overwhelmed with the food after your done because the portions are so big you can choose from like 40 difference cheese cakes dnt quote me I'm just guessing! Did I mention they have like three full pages of appetizers wtf who would hate that cmon people..."
William H.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,,2.0,12/6/2016,"Four of us went there on Sunday evening for my wife's birthday. After order my shrimp platter, waited about 20 minutes, then the waiter came and informed us they ran out of shrimp, so I had to order a substitute. My wife's fish taco came but the brown rice was not completely cooked (we know how brown rice should taste). So we got a spinach substitute. When we ate it at home, it was so salty that we had to rinse it with water. It was a very bad experience.        WH"
Angela W.,"Austin, TX",309,136,74,4.0,9/27/2016,"My experience has always been positive, maybe because I tend to walk in during weird hours.  With this location, the only tiny issue I repeatedly have was their pasta sauce...they skimp on it and I always have to ask for more. The wait staff I had were always more than happy to accommodate my needs, so no biggie there. The original cheesecake is as good as it's ever been, I love how they added sour cream on top to balance the sweetness. I will definitely come back to this location."
Cassandra T.,"Austin, TX",42,82,46,5.0,5/31/2016,Tiramasu is to die for. Not the cheese cake tiramasu but the actual tiramasu cake. Oh my gauuud. The actual food is pricey especially during dinner. Once went there with 3 other people and our bill was about 200$ for dinner but we'll worth every cent.(approx. 50$ each) Lunch is was better and that budget! Still AMAZING FOOD. Point. Blank. Period. I love This Place!
Angela M.,"Austin, TX",93,133,114,4.0,6/18/2015,"Great cheesecake selection. I had the banana creak cheesecake and it was heavenly. I started with the grilled chicken with capers, cherry tomatoes, and veggies which was really delicious.  Pros: great services, yummy desserts, and a huge selection on the lunch and dinner menu, healthy options Cons: bad acoustics so the music and other conversations are SUPER loud; you will have to yell for the person across the table to hear you, very obnoxious decor (it doesnt make sense, its cheesy, and its painful to look at) mixed beverage options are limited to syrupy/ sugary concoctions that are not savory"
Amanda M.,"London, United Kingdom",1010,790,4374,5.0,1/28/2014,"This place is amazing. It reminds me of a cruise because the servers are some of the most friendly and attentive I've met. Their food is fantastic. I was a loyal Chicken and Biscuits eater but have now changed to the Ahi Tuna Salad. Holy cow... It's amazing!!!! And healthy too. win Win WIN!!! Don't worry, their cheese cake will never be forgotten. My favorite is the banana cream!!!  I still make it a goal to come here every few months because I know it'll be great."
