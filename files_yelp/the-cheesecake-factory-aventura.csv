Boris M.,"North Miami Beach, FL",25,33,,4.0,12/16/2017,"People, its a Cheese cake factory. No idea what some people are expecting. It is big as their Corporation. When I come here I know what to expect and what type of food I am getting. I love it. For me the most important thing is SERVICE and they have very nice people working there. William who took us to our table was amazing. What a nice and handsome guy. He spoke Spanish to my grandmother who immediately fell in love with him. Good job.  We loved our food especially the Red Velvet cheesecake O M G ...it was extremely good.   I think our waiter's name was Juan.. very nice as well.  We are locals so we always come here. I hope I get to see Williams smile again. Nice employees means good managment. Bravo."
Nasha P.,"Miami Beach, FL",101,152,216,4.0,11/29/2017,"I hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years, and frankly it wasn't my first choice when my friend and I had to pick where to dine after a movie. But I was pleasantly surprised that they had many healthy options. Something I never thought went together with the name of the restaurant lol. I was happy with my vegan ""cobb"" salad and my friend was happy with her sliders, not vegan ;) I removed a star because of the service. Once they brought our food, the server never came by to see if we needed anything or if everything was ok. But if you are in Aventura mall and are leaving a late movie AND your vegan, don't be afraid to check this place out :)"

David G.,"Plano, TX",67,118,35,4.0,1/8/2018,"I typically shy away from eating at these chains when we travel, but it was a good experience. Service is really good, and have a great patio. 3 of us had the grilled salmon salad which was actually quite good as was the chicken parm dish my father in law had"
Goldie C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",283,113,539,4.0,8/24/2017,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? It's a solid four stars! Huge menu including a skinnydelicious  selection which is 590 calories or less. They have salads, sandwich, full dinners and a Sunday brunch you can always find something to eat here. Let's not forget their amazing cheesecakes and other desserts. We got there just at 12 noon so the wait was only 5 minutes and we ate outside. We ordered the Chinese chicken salad lunch portion which was plenty to eat. We also had a turkey burger from the skinny menu which came with a salad. Both were very good. As soon as we sat down our server brought us fresh brown bread with butter. The service was great and the prices are very fair."
Manuella P.,"São Paulo, Brazil",16,9,,5.0,1/10/2018,"I came here as often I came shop at Aventura Mall, some people may think that as being a fast restaurant food is not tasty and this is a major misunderstanding! I really appreciate eating here, there huge selection offers you a diversify that you could eat here all week and not repeat my choice. It's perfect for families with big/small kids, families reunions, big groups... It's a very casual place. I only tried to avoid vacation time and tourist season, it stays hardly full. For last the best! The original cheesecake for dessert, it's huge! Split it with you love on."
Rod S.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",0,6,32,4.0,1/3/2018,"Kids luv the cheesecake, and it's so not easy to get to eat inside. Anyway, the foods are yummy and the service is OK."
Simone S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",26,18,7,5.0,10/19/2017,"I come here all the time. I usually have chicken. The chicken Bellagio, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Marsala, Crusted Chicken Romano or the Crispy Chicken  Costoletta are all great. I usually choose from one of those dishes and when it's lunch time like now I get a grilled chicken sandwich on the wheat bread with mushrooms and onions. Always delicious and flavorful. Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant they have everything you can want and more!"
Yara M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,4,2,1.0,1/6/2018,"I attempted to order food over the phone because I had to take my lunch so I could not sit in, to only be put on hold for a total of 20 minutes. I hung up and called back again and patiently waited for about 10 minutes to speak to a manager or anyone. At this point I didn't care who I spoke to, I simply wanted to order food. I called about 3 times in total for absolutely no reason because I didn't even get to order because no one answered. Crappy service!"
Ryan M.,"Kilwinning, United Kingdom",19,77,518,4.0,10/12/2017,"Cheesecake factory. What can I say, its the same as any other. Consistent, great cheese cake, variety of types, with red velvet being my personal favorite. Service standards are pretty good. The wait time here was pretty long for a Thursday at 2 but its Miami and a pretty nice mall. Worth a visit but be prepared for a wait."
Sydney J.,"Vaughan, Canada",2,38,7,4.0,1/4/2018,"Where can i start, its your typical cheesecake factory with 100 options on the menu. The food and its flavour was good and just on par with any of the other cheesecake locations i have visited. However the service was exceptional. Maybe it was because we were eating at a rather slower time that the restaurant was less busy but our waiter was great. Food came out really fast and the waiter got along great with us and made a few jokes that really did enlighten our experience."
Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",87,285,302,4.0,7/6/2017,"I had a lovely experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Aventura, FL for my last couple of visits so I figured it was only right for me to complete a review.  This is a high volume restaurant; most likely because it is located at one of the largest (and best) malls in the area. Please note, you cannot make a reservation nor can you do call ahead seating.  There are certain times where I wouldn't dare step foot in this restaurant (peak times, weekends). However, my husband and I had a late dinner yesterday ~8:15pm and it wasn't too bad.  WATCH OUT when you walk in. On top of patrons trying to enter the restaurant, you will also be amongst the servers going in and out the door! There likely won't be a place for you to have a seat (waiting area is subpar) but you can get a buzzer and do a little shopping while you wait (I'm unsure how far the pager goes).  My experience... my husband and I asked for a table of two and had to wait approximately 5 minutes. We were seated next to the kitchen door which is normally extremely frustrating to me but the back of the booth has such a tall divider that I couldn't even notice.  Our waitress was most helpful. I ordered strawberry lemonade (which is honestly way too sweet but I had a sweet craving at the time). I always request to only have the wheat bread in our basket because... well, it's just that darn tasty! We ordered the chicken nachos as a starter (Mm mmm good!) and decided to share the  orange chicken entree. Honestly, all of their entrees are oversized... we try to make good decisions!  Service was great. Food was DELISH!"
Veronica A.,"Bowie, MD",84,110,145,5.0,9/18/2017,The gumbo is my favorite thing on the menu. Happy hour is also great too! Love Cheesecake factory.  When I arrived it was very busy sat in the bar area. Our server CJ was very kind and attentive. Listened well and didn't make us feel rush even though they were very busy.
Ivan H.,"Miami, FL",91,240,1921,4.0,5/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to end the night. The staff is always very friendly, and if the wait's too long, you can look for an open table in the bar area.  Food is usually on point being it's Cheesecake Factory and desserts are always a great plus. I usually order the Teriyaki Chicken, bone in and it's always good. I've also ordered a steak one time but it wasn't so great. I fault myself for that being that this isn't a steak place, and so I should save those cravings for another place I enjoy going to.  My favoite desserts are the Banana Cheesecake and the Tiramisu Dessert (not cheesecake)"
Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1600,475,1683,3.0,11/30/2016,"We were early so there was no wait for a table. Service was fairly fast also. Although the waiter seemed a bit snotty. I ordered off the ""skinny"" menu (under 590 calories section) and got a turkey sandwich with bacon, avocado, tomato on a roll. I asked for no mayo but it came with mayo so I deconstructed it. Sorry, no photo! There was also a side ""salad"" - a small dish of greens topped with some sort of dressing.  It tasted fine. My companion liked his regular chopped salad -- said he'd order it again. See photo. Interesting when your server gets more friendly the closer to the tip it is. Hmmmm.."
Brandon M.,"Weston, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,This is the slowest restaurant I've ever been to in my life. It took over 1 hour and 30 minuets to get our food and it took over 40 minuets to just get us seated. Don't get me started about how bad the service is it took the waiter 20 minuets to get our drinks. The food isn't  good for waiting over a hour and a half. It took almost an hour to get the receipt. I was about to leave without paying it took so long. I will never ever eat at one of these locations again.
Krystal A.,"Oldsmar, FL",169,501,1608,4.0,6/4/2017,The beauty of the Cheesecake Factory is that there is something for everyone. I mean their menu does not seem to end.  After a few hours of wandering the mall to find my mom a dress we ended up at the Cheesecake Factory and it was packed. Seriously packed. I have to give the staff kudos for efficiently handling the crowd and getting us seated in 15 minutes. Service did not suffer at all. I got stuffed mushrooms and a salad and enjoyed both. The complimentary bread was yummy too. Cheesecake Factory has never steered me wrong.
Wendy V.,"Opa-locka, FL",85,1,,3.0,1/7/2018,Let me start off with how much I enjoy coming to cheesecake factory for dinner and brunch. But this morning's experience made me think otherwise for this location. We waited about 20mins before we got our server to come by and take our drink orders. It's not busy at all so 20mins is a lot of time considering that she went to another table that sat down AFTER us first. I ordered their caramel macchiato. Walked away and didn't give me a straw. Of course I spilt it on myself for trying to drink it from the glass. Next the bread was definitely day old bread as it was hard as a rock. Only thing good about this meal was my omelette.
Kitten J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,32,54,1.0,12/14/2017,"Mehhhh.....what horrible food. I ordered the herb crusted salmon, received it with absolutely no lemon butter sauce.  How the heck does that happen?  My husband ordered he grilled salmon blackened, both overcooked. If you can't properly cook salmon or steak your shouldn't be in the kitchen. How dreadful........Both spinach sides were chewy and overcooked. I had large hard, uncooked lumps of potatoes in my garlic mash.  This location may be to ""busy"" for its own good, we won't be back."
Amanda B.,"Coral Springs, FL",15,30,11,1.0,12/22/2017,"This review is NOT about The Cheesecake Factory - it's about Door Dash the service on The Cheesecake Factory website for online orders.  Last night we hosted a holiday party for our law firm at our managing partners home.  We decided to order 18 appetizers from TCF as everyone loves them and they are the closest to her home.  We used Door Dash the day before to input the $200 + order and selected delivery between 4:15 p.m. -4:30 p.m.  Now, we ran into traffic heading to her home to set up so we already knew a 4:30 delivery would most likely be a few minutes late (maybe even 30 min).  Acceptable.  The mall traffic was crazy, 95 was a mess.  However at 5:30 p.m. there was still no food/ no delivery.  That meant our food was ready at 4pm waiting, sitting, getting cold. We reached out to Door Dash who confirmed that the driver was running late and was not yet at TCF.  Which we knew because we called TCF directly.  We ended up having to pick up our own food and serve 18 appetizers (which arrived cold and soggy at 6:30 p.m.) 2 hours after the delivery was to arrive we had to reheat EVERYTHING.  Completely and horribly embarrassing.  My recommendation is that Cheesecake Factory disassociate themselves from this horrendous delivery service and use someone else.  DO NOT USE THE ONLINE ORDERING FEATURE.  GET IT YOURSELF."
Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941,4.0,6/17/2016,"This is a review for the Cheesecake Factory Happy Hour offerings in the bar at their location inside Aventura Mall.  They reeled me in with a Mojito for $5.50. The best happy hour food were the fried chicken sliders. There were at least four reasonably sized sliders. They arrived very hot, freshly fried. Aventura's chicken sliders were more substantial than Dadeland Mall's chicken sliders I tried a few weeks later.  I wouldn't recommend the ""Vietnamese"" summer rolls. They must be made way in advance because the rice paper became very white and hard. Ideally the wrapper should be dipped and rolled just before serving, so that it's still soft and chewy when eaten. The pork eggrolls, artichoke dip, and ahi tuna tartare were okay. Overall, the portions of most of the Happy Hour foods at this location are bigger than Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory."
Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",2308,536,2059,3.0,12/3/2016,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factory many years and this location is one of the few sit down eating options at Aventura Mall. With that being said it is always packed and therefore they should plan for the crowds but they don't.  We put our name in party of 2 10 minutes believe me there is no science to this as they just give a time of 10 minutes so you won't leave. We said we will sit inside or out but either option is crowded and loud. So after 20 minutes we get called for a table for 2 inside one side bench seat the other side chair. The entire evening my husband would move his jackets that he just purchased so the 2 year old next to us could go back and forth to her seat all night.  The service was lousy as our waitress took our drink orders but came back saying it will be awhile as the bar is backed up. We order our food and various servers came to bring our appetizer and than our entrees. These are not timed but just randomly given out. Therefore you get your appetizer and once you start eating my entree comes and than by the time I am done my husband gets his entree. Also forget about getting another drink as that ain't happening.  So the Mojito I had was great but if I want another drink I guess I have to go somewhere else. The Tex mex rolls were good mini in size and the dips of salsa and avocado were great. The lettuce wraps too generous a portion so I got a to go box that was flinged at me quickly so I will get to eat later when I can get a drink to wash it down. After we already asked for the check and got it from our server she thought it would be a great time after the fact to ask if we want dessert. Crazy I know but I needed a drink and that wasn't being offered as I guess the bar is still backed up.  My photos below are from my last visit as well as the current visit, but I didn't write a review interesting before the southwestern egg rolls were 8 large ones now they are 8 mini for the same price. Also luckily last time I was able to actually eat cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  Bottom line great food consistently but always terrible service at this location."
Vanessa D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,4,,5.0,12/28/2017,"I love this place for its Bang Bang chicken & shrimp and the Carrot cake. I ordered a Bellini once, it was okay I had no idea it would be frozen I ended up keeping it just to save the waitress trouble. But overall, the food was good."
David M.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,37,2,3.0,6/21/2017,"So this is your typical Cheesecake Factory except they could care less if your meal comes out wrong, takes longer than usual, if they add items you didn't order to the bill, or not deliver your food at all.  Could just be that we had the worst waiter in America but I doubt it.  Save your money and go next door there's an awesome boutique Italian restaurant. 6/18/17. I did view the comment below from management and sent them further details at the 'contact us' area of their website on 6/21/17.  I will update review after hearing back from them.  As of today 7/2/17 no one from Cheesecake Factory replied so I guess they just post a comment about being concerned whenever they get a negative review but never actually address it.  Not going to this location again."
Lynette R.,"North Miami Beach, FL",134,18,2,4.0,12/26/2017,I love cheese cake factory ! Even when it's busy you don't wait to long to be seated .
Danny T.,"Miami, FL",144,43,218,5.0,1/25/2017,"Whether you're coming in for a full hearty meal or just a slice of cheesecake, it's hard to go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  One of my favorite dishes is the sweet corn tamales. Not many people know about this dish (and it is on the happy hour menu so you can try it for the cheap), and it'll change your life! It's such a perfect mix of the sweet corn outside with the lightly spicy goodness that they fill the tamale with.  My other go to dish is the hibachi steak. Such a big portion that I normally am able to share the dish with someone else and like Magic.... one meal becomes two. Their portions are huge! Cheesecake must: red velvet cheesecake or their anniversary one that's chocolate cake with cheesecake all in one. You're welcome!!"
Tara S.,"Manhattan, NY",62,22,33,5.0,11/8/2017,"I was on vacation with my dad in Florida and we decided to check out this restaurant being that all the shopping in the mall had us starving lol. It was kinda crowded inside and we waited about 15mins for a table. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was just lovely, reminded me of the Roman times. Ceiling artwork is fantastic! Our waitress was really awesome at explaining the menu and answering any questions we had. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE! Two people can easily share from one entree. Our dishes were so delicious and flavorful. The bistro shrimp pasta was to die for! Never had anything like it. My father got the lasagna and said it was really tasty. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was a little bit too sweet (didn't taste like it had any alcohol). For desert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake (with Nutella on top) and it was so creamy and fresh. I don't know if all the cheesecake factory's are the same but I'm praying when I go to the one in NY I have the same experience I did here."
Sharon W.,"Miami Beach, FL",320,614,194,3.0,12/11/2016,"I hate shopping, and I hate malls; however, we had an errand to run in the area, and Larry S. knows the only way to get me to submit to a retail experience is to liquor me up, so we stopped here for happy hour.  The happy hour deal is great; a wide variety of drinks for less than $6. Since we had recently eaten at Steak 'n Shake (ugh!), we didn't partake of the similarly priced HH bites, but they looked great. Larry had a Long Island Iced Tea (x2) and I had a pink lemonade and a mojito. The bartender was friendly and if I were not an honest person, we would have gotten 4 drinks for the price of 1 as she didn't tote up the bill correctly. I would stop off here first for happy hour next time I had to subject myself to the torture of mall shopping."
Cisco A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",20,124,14,4.0,6/12/2017,"The food is amazing. Decently priced, nothing out of the norm. A big menu and you will go home with leftovers most of the time. Unless you're like me that must eat everything in site"
Elise P.,"New York, NY",227,111,61,2.0,3/23/2017,"10 years ago this place was the biggest scene. If you didn't have your name in line.... were you even visiting Florida? Today, its okay, not much has changed off the menu, the service is mediocre and the food doesn't always live up to the description (hence my spicy chicken tacos were not spicy at all)  A little disappointed by the service. I got here at 1130. It was literally empty, yet my food and drinks took longer to come out than those who arrived and we seated 30 minutes after me.  I wish this place was still as great as it was 10 years ago, we used to wait hours for a table, now it's not even worth it... even if you're the only one here!"
Charelle B.,"Miami, FL",9,30,59,3.0,10/1/2017,"The wait staff was very friendly and warm untill we made had a request about a burger that wasn't cooked properly. We requested that the burger be remade because it wasn't cooked properly and the waiter told us that they won't remake a fresh one they'll simply scrap the cheese off and remove any toppings and try to FIX THE SAME PATTY. I found that to be quite gross and shocking. I ordered calamari and the eggroll sampler, while the the sampler was to die for the calamari tasted old and soggy I mean completely bland no salt or pepper or anything what happened chef? As my entree I ordered the fish and chips and again it was quite boring as far as taste. Finally DESSERT! OMG! Can you say perfect, I ordered the Warm Apple Crisp it was warm and cool at the same given it has vanilla ice with baked Apple slices and cinnamon streusel goodness everywhere. I had just enough to nearly put me to sleep. This visit was supposed to be my exciting birthday dinner party and all 10 of my guest had the same comments about food. Better luck next year."
Anna T.,"Hollywood, FL",15,40,6,1.0,9/24/2017,"Completely mind blown......so last night was my birthday and I agreed to have my birthday dinner at Cheesecake Factory because that's all I've been craving so I get to the location before my date and I was sat down the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink and some bread, I sat for 30 mins maybe more with no drink or bread nor a waitress coming to my table even asking me if I was ready to order. I never felt so invisible in my life, I literally told my date to not park the car because we I was going to leave, I got up from the table and walked away the host seen me leave and didn't even say anything, completely disappointed not sure I'll even come back to a cheese cake factory again you can even roll back the camera footage if there is any to see how long I was sitting there unattended"
Michael S.,"Miami, FL",433,341,1940,3.0,3/8/2016,"There is so much hype that surrounds this chain and the crowds are always vast. I wonder if it truly is the namesake, or the allure of the overdone dining hall, or just the options for days on the menu. Anyway you slice it, Cheesecake works for a lot and the food is more than adequate. This location in Aventura mall of course is always packed. I went this past weekend with my folks, so it was three of us, and the wait around 6PM was about 35 minutes. Not too bad after we surveyed the amount of people I must say. But with a huge outdoor area and vast dining room, that amount of people still needed a substantial wait. No big deal. Once we sat, we were promptly greeted by a nice server who gave us bread right away, always a plus, and brought our drinks quickly. After we ordered, the food came rather quick with all things considered. I am happy to report, and also have posted a photo for, the newly added ""Falafel Salad. I realized after I ordered that I had made it vegan, which works for me even though I am not. I just opted for no feta cheese nor dressing, and added some olive oil. This made for a wonderful salad filled with Kale, Romaine, Tomatoes, Cucumber and of course, Falafel. A great taste and would be a recommedndation from me for others. We of course concluded the meal wiht the perfect slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake and split three ways, none of us felt bad about the adition I am sure. Ha. All in all, it was a great experience, I give the place three stars as it is just another chain that you can enjoy in Miami or across the country; nothing special."
Agustina F.,"North Miami Beach, FL",40,6,,1.0,8/20/2017,Service sucks!! Floor is filthy always!! No matter what time. I've emailed before and today also it was a mess!! I had to ask for the floor to be swept!! Always the same crap! Food is delicious always but the fact that it's not clean no master what time is frustrating!!
Robert C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,117,2,1.0,11/25/2017,"If I could give it minus a star I would. Went on Black Friday and boy black is what the experience was. It was its usual zoo like atmosphere at the entrance. I had been used to that. We got seated pretty quickly all in all.  First I order the chicken picata. It comes with a cream sauce on top. Never seen that, and for a good reason, when I taste it's awful. Picata is in a WINE sauce. So I send it back then order the chicken parmagnan pizza, whatever that is supposed to be. I said let me give it a shot. Pasta on top. I was starving. Two bites of it and I knew things were going downhill fast. So I sent that back. By then 0 for 2, I figured I'd play it safe, and order NOTHING. Finally my family, who weren't satisfied either, ordered the cheesecake, which really, was just average. Nothing compared to Junior's in Brooklyn. 3 bites turned out to be my dinner. Actually, the bread rolls were terrific and the high point of the meal.  In short, I used to like this place but it's gone down faster than hooker's head. Unlike a hooker I wasn't charged for sending back my dishes, which was the best thing I could say for a place I once held in esteem, but now am never returning too."
Courtney R.,"Derry, NH",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Myself and my family will never come here again. Quoted a 30min wait, ended up waiting double that. When finally sat, the five of us were brought to a table that normally seats four. As being sat we saw a large booth clean and available. We asked the host to sit there, she checked with the desk and came back to say ""no, sorry this table is for parties of 6""... Less than five minutes later, a different party of five was sat at this table. Thus lied to for the first time. Shortly after receiving our drinks, another large booth opened up. I went to the front to ask if we could move to this table, explaining that three family members are visiting from Europe and leaving tomorrow and we would greatly appreciate a more private experience. The manager then said ""I'm sorry this is for a party of 6 or more""... About 10 minutes later ANOTHER PARTY OF 5 sat there. Thus lied to the second time.  It is obvious this establishment only cares about getting people in and out, and could give two f**** about actually making their customers happy. A simple move could have enhanced and changed my families last night together. Instead I was so frustrated I could not even enjoy my food.  The knives had nasty slim on them from not being polished. One appetizer came out 10 minutes before the second. Worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Never again will come back."
Sutanee K.,"Hollywood, FL",17,2,1,2.0,9/19/2017,Food was very good...their cheesecake is my favorite but their service is the worst...I ordered to go and stood at the counter for a while and 2 peoples was working in there till I asked them can I order then she said you have to wait for cashier and I waited like 10 mins...I understand if it's not your duty to take order but why would you say it at first place so I know what's going on!!!
Frank D.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,7,7,1.0,10/1/2017,NASTIEST SERVICE STARTING AT THE FRONT RECEPTION (Valentina was RUDE AND WOULD NOT GET A MANAGER AFTER I REQUESTED ONE.)  After waiting a little by time for the table for five our table was filthy.  I asked The manager Richard to please have it wiped down and he requested one of his staff to wipe our table down and replace our table ware.  The guy came over and wipe down two of our five and then never replaced our dirty table ware.  This place is disgusting and they couldn't care less about providing a pleasant experience.  I couldn't believe the manager Richard could not even make sure we were taken care of. They need to take a lesson from our wonderful waitress.  Polite and courteous!!! I never want to return here again.  Needless to say I'm not willing to eat the food if our table is this filthy and being wiped down with a rag that looks like it's been used for a week.
Irina K.,"Hollywood, FL",3,53,24,1.0,8/4/2016,"My husband took me here today for an early birthday movie and lunch celebration. I enjoy this place and their menu options. Today was the first day I really did not enjoy our experience. I ordered a app. Size Caesar salad with grilled salmon without croutons and my husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken breast with broccoli. The waitress asked if he wanted the lunch  portion and clearly he said no the full size as he could only eat the chicken and veggies no carbs. So our food arrived with his being the lunch portion , and my salad having croutons. The waitress didn't even say anything about my croutons so I just removed them .  I was eating the salmon and did not notice at first it was medium rare. First, I never knew I had to tell my waitress what I would like. The salmon looked fully cooked on the edges until I cut it in half. I asked the waitress and she told me I need to tell my waiter or waitress how I like it cooked. I looked at her like you are our waitress. I never knew that and told her I wish she would have mentioned that to me because each restaurant has a different way of making food. She said yeah and just ignored the whole response. She is lucky I am not pregnant because if I was I would lose it. You don't as me how i would like my salmon cooked and you pick for me medium -rare. Wow , just wow. Her name was Sarai. My husband meal took forever to correct that he just had it to go . She never once talked to the manager to notify him of the issues not apologize for the mistakes.  It is sad when a good company has certain people that make it look bad. I had some really amazing waiters and waitresses here that work there butt off and if there is an issue they try to resolve it. They know how to be efficient and provide great customer service . So she does not reflect her co workers that are actually good. I just won't want her to be my server ever again. Also, if it is true what she said about the Salmon the company needs to put that on the menu. Undercooked fish is dangerous and can make someone sick. If what she says is false I hope the manager will address this."
