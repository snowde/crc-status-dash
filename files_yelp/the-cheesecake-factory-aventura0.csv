Josie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",251,348,1294,3.0,10/31/2012,"had a 5 minute wait and was brought to our table shortly.  there was a mixup with our order and the waitress said that my friend had pointed to another dish (when he said he was pointing to the one below it). I didn't really think it was a big deal (i mean i would have just ate the wrong order but lightly let the waitress know) But I thought it would have been more professional to not abruptly accuse the customer by saying ""no you didn't""  when the customer said they ordered _____, regardless of the fact of who's at fault.    They should have rounded the corners and not make the atmosphere so heavy and awkward. My friend later requested to see the menu again and they both kind of realized how it was an honest mistake.  The manager later came to apologize for the mixup and got our orders in right.  I felt the meal kind of awkward the rest of the night though the waitress was really professional and did come back to see if we have everything we needed.  not big enough of a deal to not want to come back, but did change the mood."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,3.0,8/11/2010,"Wow, it has been so long since I have been to a Cheesecake Factory.  After a great movie we walked downstairs to grab some grub and chill. The place was packed since there was a horrible rainstorm. We got lucky and snagged a high top in the bar area. Our server Kyle greeted us quickly getting our drink order.  We decided to order some apps, wine and beer. Food came out quickly and hot. I ordered the chicken nachos and like everything here the portions are huge. The nachos had great flavored shredded chicken, melted Mexican cheese, sour cream, guacamole, tomato's and jalapenos. They really hit the spot and were delish.  My friend's buffalo chicken bites were huge and looked very good. I was to busy eating my nachos to try. Our other friend ordered the margarita pizza, which surprisingly was small and did not look like much.  This place has good food, reasonable prices and a great spot to chill with good friends and catch up. Service from Kyle was top notch. Really a 3.5 stars all the way. It made me want to come back and visit real soon.  Perfect ending for a great night!"
Jerry P.,"Miami, FL",53,29,1,2.0,11/20/2012,"We're creatures of habit so we usually stick to the same 'ol thing.  Humus here is great. Love the soft warm bread that comes with this appetizer.  For dinner we both opted for the Teriyaki Chicken. You have the choice of bone in or not; pick the bone in one since it seems much more moist.  And for desert, we always choose the Tirimisu desert, not the cheese cake.  So why the 2 stars? I believe Cheesecake Factory does many things well, but they only do cheese cakes exceptional. I ordered a steak one time here and it came overcooked despite me advising the sever that it has to be rare.  When the steak came that time, the plate was super hot telling me that the runner or server left it under the heating lamp too long and sure enough, it was medium. The server gladly took it back and the manager brought a new one to me. It was super rare which is fine and I enjoyed it. The meat was red but not a deep red color as when you would get beef from a butcher shop. This quality of meat was inferior and that's what I meant by their menu being large and serving it all.  Also, we ordered take out last week and were looking forward to enjoy our dinner while watching a move at the drive-in at Swap Shops. While we enjoyed our humus, when we finally got to the Teriyaki Chicken, there were no utensils. I called Scott the manager and he offered nothing but an apology. Now imagine you're in the middle of watching a movie, and about to eat your dinner, but now you're completely distracted because the moron handling the take out decides to not pay attention and leaves you no way to eat. So now instead of watching the movie, you're scratching your head on how you and your wife are supposed to eat dinner. Needless to say, management here needs much improvement. Or it needs to be replaced. Training is paramount and here it's lacking in the worst way."
Anjali R.,"Downtown, Miami, FL",315,228,297,5.0,11/13/2012,"Delicious food, great service! Everytime i dine here i order the tamales for an appetizer and the chicken madeira for the main course.  I can gladly say Ive never been disappointed. !"
Eric B.,"Ottawa, Canada",41,335,33,5.0,12/13/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is always a favourite when we come to Florida.  The Jumbalaya pastas are fantastic, as are the hamburgers, salads, etc.  Of course, the cheesecake selection is amazing, and you can't go wrong.  I wouldn't advise the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich - it was fairly boring.  Also, come early, as they are always busy.  Service ain't so hot anymore, but the food makes up for it!"
Marieflor M.,"Miami, FL",1,2,,1.0,8/15/2014,"Service has really gone down at this Cheesecake. Went their a few weeks ago, the hostess was really rude from the beginning. Asked to speak to the manager she promised to take care of us and seat us at a good seat. That was clearly a lie. When we asked to be seated at a booth they told us that we had to wait for another 15min, we asked to speak to the floor manager. Explained to him our situation, without even finishing our sentence he had the audacity to say that we'll give you a booth because that's what you want. He didn't even apologize or took the time to listen to us, he automatically took defense of his staff and dismissed us. The food was as lousy as the servicw. Never again will I go to this place."
Elizabeth P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",293,224,287,4.0,9/8/2012,"Love the location right inside the Aventura Mall, convenient after a long day of shopping.  It was really busy and crowded on a Saturday night but the service was still very good and fast.  The food is as good as it gets at a Cheesecake Factory.   Love their menu which provides a large variety of dishes.  And now they have the new Skinnylicious menu items which provides the low-cal dishes.  Despite my best efforts, I do have one weakness which is their bread basket ... which I honestly try very hard to ignore but  that yummy soft warm bread calls out my name till resistance becomes futile.  Then, to feel less guilty, I'll have their tuna tataki salad ... perhaps accompanied by a glass of wine.  Ok, then after that, my second weakness kicks in... a little bite (or 2 or 3) of one of their famous cheesecakes.  So much for ""Skinnylicious."""
Roald F.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,4.0,1/31/2015,"The food is great. Although I had to wait quite long for my sandwich and later for my cheesecake. I had the Italian sandwich,  which is one of the best I have ever had. The service is good. I know when it is busy you don't think about it, but some more smiling faces would be nice. Overall a good restaurant with good service."
Kiva W.,"Denver, CO",24,7,7,1.0,5/30/2014,"We went on a Thursday around 2 pm for a late lunch. We were seated quickly,  and then just waited. We sat for 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. Our server was an older man named Bob. He seemed put out and bothered by waiting on us. Once our food came he never came back to check on us. We had to flag him down to get drink refills, cheese for the pasta and malt vinegar for the fish and chips.  The food was subpar. Not great,  but we were hungry and it was edible. Bob did make sure to ask if we wanted dessert,  then never came back to take our order. We had to flag him down again. The restaurant wasn't super busy. Bob seemed to spend a lot of time on the computers which happened to be next to our table.  When I got his attention and asked for the bill he huffed and got it and slammed it on the table.  We go out to eat all the time and have never had such poor service. Totally wasn't worth the high ticket price."
Kristen K.,"Midtown, Miami, FL",941,22,1,3.0,5/25/2014,Sat at the bar and was practically ignored both bartenders food took 45 min. Seemed like they had to many bartenders on service. They all seemed busy just not taking care of people sitting at the bar. My food was great. And a curly haired girl @ the dessert area was really fun and had great suggestions about the white chocolate macadamia but cheesecake thnx girl it was amazing!
Maria R.,"Koreatown, Manhattan, NY",4,7,5,1.0,3/29/2014,"Omg what a terrible customer service experience. This is my first time in this location, in a saturday afternoon, and I don't recommend it at all. The food was OK, as in any other cheesecake factory. However, the place was extremely crowded, and after a 20+ min wait, I experienced one of the worst customer service experience of my entire life. First of all, we ordered a Strawberry margarita and we got a regular one. We also ordered a beer and they brought it to us when we were finishing our food, after we remind the different server more than three times (the last time I inquired about the beer I ordered the most disgusting red hair lady almost yell at me that ""your server will bring that to you"". Finally the beer came (not cold), and finally we had to wait about 15min for the check. I decided to ask another server if he could take care of it, and same response (evil eye, rude manners, and a ""your server will take care of that""). Not coming back ever! You just lost 4 clients."
Jessica B.,"Hollywood, FL",26,7,10,3.0,9/22/2014,The food was as good as every Cheesecake Factory. The service left something to be desired.
Artiom T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,5.0,1/6/2015,I was here twice and both times it was good. Don't be fooled by a long line -- it actually goes pretty fast and you always can get a table (for two) within 10--15 mins. Skinnylicous menu is worth trying!
Alex S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",24,24,9,4.0,1/21/2016,"Everything was great - service, decor, prices and most importantly food!!! Frankly the only thing that disappointed was cheesecake.  But will always go back there, my family loves it there!!!!!"
Preeseela R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,18,23,5.0,12/6/2014,"Delicious food, nice waiter, and I had a nice time. We ordered a lot of food and were satisfied. I had leftovers and it was still good the second time. My boyfriend had the fillet mignon and enjoyed it very much as well. The decor is very nice but the placement of our table was a bit close to a large column-like statue and had us cramped on one side of the table. Other than that- great place."
Gaby S.,"Miami, FL",756,328,153,4.0,7/23/2012,"Yes its a chain restarant but its so good everytime that i dont care! Ive only been to this location twice and hurried on over here this time to get the lunch special on a Sunday afternoon. There's always a wait here, ive gotten over it and you should too. The firecracker salmon rolls are my fav appetizer and the spinach dip is yummy too. If you're going for the lunch specials i suggest you get the crusted chicken romano (with white sauce) delisshhhh! Red velvet cheesecake is awesome too!"
Paulo Enrique G.,"Hollywood, FL",4,7,,5.0,8/31/2014,"I went for dinner with my family and we had a great time. The service was fast, the food delicious and their juices tasted like fresh and made from the fruit. We already have plans to go back and try other dishes. My only issue with the place is that is loud, very loud, but that's not the business fault."
Vanessa G.,"Miami Beach, FL",6,35,,4.0,2/12/2012,Well all cheesecake factories have the same look and food so if you've been to one you've been to all. My favorite appetizer is their avocado egg rolls they are the best! The red velvet cheescake is amazing!  As for our experience today the server was very nice but the bread took forever to bring out. I had to ask for it several times. Also they brought out our dinner plates at all different times. This was kind of annoying.
Dinelle M.,"Hollywood, FL",1,4,,4.0,11/14/2014,"I absolutely love the cheesecake here...so many varieties. Favorites are the red velvet and the oreo dream. But the white chocolate raspberry is excellent also. To my surprise the food menu is very good too. My favorite is a Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, the combination of flavors is perfect...from spicy to salty to sweet. Tres magnifique! The Fresh Grilled Salmon is very good also.               I haven't had a problem with parking and the longest I've had to wait was 20 minutes. Which they were prompted with, getting my group and I seated by that time or earlier.  This is a place I would definitely recommend and will be eating from again.               Bon appétit!!"
Samuel G.,"Miami, FL",0,3,2,1.0,10/26/2015,"After skipping our turn due to a ""beeper malfunction"" our order took 40 minutes to arrive, the soup was missing (we cancelled it) and 2 entrees were cold. We returned them to be warmed and after 40 more minutes decided to also cancel them. Manager came to the table and apologized but did absolutely nothing about it...we received a full check...obviously left no tip...I mean....really?"
