Kim D.,"Coral Gables, FL",222,4,1,2.0,9/1/2016,"Usually dine in the Pembroke Gardens location, but was convenient since I did some midday shopping. Was packed as usual, but don't mind waiting. Asked to be seated outside since it's a faster wait... I guess I didn't get the memo sitting outside = getting crappy service. 1) waiter took forever to greet 2) waited another 10 minutes for water and lemonade 3) another 15 for bread 4) another waiter said he's taking over from here on ""great, better service"" I though to myself ... NOT! 5) someone else brought us the food 6) didn't see my waiter for another 10 min after I was done with my lunch 7) had to ask ANOTHER  waiter for a to go box 8) asked ANOTHER waiter for the check and a to go cheesecake, he himself told me he couldn't find my waiter. 9) was on a timed lunch due to the fact my friend had to pick up her son. The whole lunch took us way over an hour.  Will NOT be returning back. BOTH servers were horrible."
Michelle O.,"West Palm Beach, FL",250,102,593,5.0,3/8/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time can't go wrong favorites!!! The food is delicious and the portions are extremely generous :D  My favorites here are: - their complimentary fresh bread assortments with butter  - the orange peel chicken  - the chicken Marsala  - crispy crab cake bites They offer a great variety in their menu and most places are conveniently located near shops, malls, and movies :P  And last but not least, they have the BEST cheesecakes and cheesecake variety ever!!!  Tip: if you are a tourist this place is an american staple you must try!! Definitely an experience you won't regret ;)"
Moraine S.,"Miami, FL",80,74,186,4.0,10/11/2016,As always I always have a good experience here with the food and the service. My fiancé order the Smokehouse burger and I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and it was my first time having the dish. It was so good.  I can honestly say that it was hot and fresh and the ingredients were well worth it.  The dish is kind of spicy but if you can handle the heat then definitely make it an option the next time you are there.  The only thing that I didn't too much care for was the Crispy Crab Wonton. When we ordered them they were hot and crispy but the filling with the crab was not too tasty for me. I can't really put my finger on it but I just didn't like it too much.  I've had Crab Wonton from other Asian restaurants and they were really good. But this one I did not like.  But overall besides that the service was great and the food. I will definetly be back here over and over again. Just an FYI the wait may be kind of long but not too bad.

Renzo A.,"Miami, FL",212,11,4,5.0,10/5/2016,"Awesome service! Ask for Josh Stevens, he's absolutely the most energetic, on top of things and detail oriented guy on the floor."
Andrea D.,"Miami, FL",184,28,48,5.0,12/31/2015,"We just have another great dinner here with the family , thanks to our waiter Cris ! Salmon and shrimp scampi are the best ! Of course the cheesecake too !"
Isabellaa C.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",162,2,,3.0,4/2/2017,"The wait wasn't long at all, maybe 5 min although it was very crowded there. We sat down, waited for our server. Took about 10 min for Jason G to greet us.. took another 10 min for our drinks... another 20 min for him to come and get our appetizer order... appetizer took another 20 minutes. Finally, he came again to order our food. I mentioned in the beginning it was a split check between me and my friend and she reminded him again before he took our food off the table and what do you know, he didn't split it. So i had to wait another 15-20 min for him to come back and to let him know it was suppose to be split. He took it back with an attitude (MIND YOU, HE HAD 4 tables. ONLY.) brought it back, we paid and he returned our cards another 15 min later. No ""have a great night"" just set it down on the table. Im sorry but if you want a great tip please give us good service. Speak to your table, be a nice human being. If you want good service, avoid Jason."
Lisa P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",355,5,,3.0,5/5/2017,"The food is always amazing here! The chefs do a great job and their are so many options. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app. The extra sauce was good with the bread too! I got the veggie burger with a salad, soooo gooood! And my boyfriend got a chicken dish with asparagus mushrooms and mashed potatoes. He loved it!  However my service was pretty horrible. Our server came up to the table and just looked like she was in the weeds. She took our drink and app order and quickly ran off to tend to other tables. She comes back with one drink. She forgot if I got a Pinot Grigio or Pinot noir. No biggy, it happens, but hey if your weeded you should probably write things down. The food runner that dropped off the app was very pleasant, she even refilled our waters. My wine got to the table mid app and we placed our food order. I asked for no tomato add avocado, and she seemed a little confused, she may have been new to the menu. Our server delivers the food and it's perfect but then she wasn't seen for a while. My boyfriend needed a water refill and wanted to look at the cheesecake list. When we were all done she stopped by and we asked for the check, she grabbed another water for my boyfriend and we decided to not get a cheesecake. We cash out and after the card was swiped I realize the check is wrong! She charged my boyfriend for an Irish coffee Manhattan (which was also delicious btw) and an Irish coffee.  A genuine smile, a sincere sorry, and a pen and paper would have gone a long way for this girl."
Leah L.,"Miami, FL",7,46,16,5.0,9/5/2016,"Update** 5 stars for John M. Guest Services Specialist.  Outstanding customer service, John followed up with me in regards to my horrible birthday experience at the Aventura Location. He apologized and assured he'll address the situation. I just received a letter in the mail from ,he kept his word."
Wendy Q.,"Miami Beach, FL",30,10,23,5.0,2/29/2016,Great bartender!! She is amazing!! She made us experience wonderful!! The soup was very good like always!!
Zechio D.,"Miami, FL",21,2,,3.0,8/27/2016,"My girlfriend and I chose to go there for a date night, they gave us our table and I was starting to get upset because it took almost 30 minutes for a server to come to serve us. But the food was good though and especially the fried mac and cheese one of my favorite  side dish there."
Brenda D.,"Mississauga, Canada",35,67,114,3.0,12/6/2014,"Background: My husband and I were looking for a place to eat a late lunch so we decided on Cheesecake Factory because it's familiar territory. I ordered the skinny licious soft chicken taco and husband ordered mushroom, spinach, bacon and cheese omelet that came with a side of potatoes and toast. Order came up to $40 for the two meals plus an iced mint green tea.  The Good: - The wait time for two people on a Saturday at around 3 was less than ten minutes  - We were seated in an area where we had plenty of room unlike some parts of the restaurant where you are practically touching your neighbor - Waiter came fairly quickly to take order  - The menu is in itself a book! Tons and tons of options.  - The bread provided was nice and warm  -  My husband commented that the omelet was flavourful.  The Bad: - The tables around us who came after got their food much quicker than we did. It wasn't too big of a deal but we were starving!!! - I asked for extra cilantro and crema on my tacos but it didn't come with it. The waiter did ask if the request was fulfilled but I was too shy to say no so I guess that was my fault.  - The tacos themselves were pretty bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour and it just didn't have too much flavour overall. I was very disappointed actually. I understand that it's supposed to be part of the skinny licious menu but a little more oomph wouldn't have hurt.  Summary: I think I would go back to another Cheesecake Factory but wouldn't order these tacos again. It's a great place for groups of people because there's tons of choices. As well, the cheesecakes are pretty good especially if you want to take one home to eat later."
Drew M.,"North Miami, FL",58,30,1,1.0,1/8/2017,"We just came for dessert having already had dinner earlier. Spent over $30 for 2 slices of cheesecake and 2 cups of coffee. The cheesecake might as well have been jello instant box cheesecake for all the flavor it had, and the coffee was so bitter I could barely drink it. The cheesecake was grainy and gritty, and didn't have much flavor. The waiter was attentive, but a little pushy, seemed annoyed to be waiting on us for just 2 slices of cheesecake and 2 coffees. Was really trying to push the dinner menu on us and talking over us. Once he realized we were just there for dessert he kept trying to pressure us into different choices than what we wanted. Clientele was mostly bourgeois yuppie housewives in ugg boots who seemed to think the food was just this side of heaven. Maybe it was, but the dessert was very pedestrian. The atmosphere was like a noisy cafeteria, tables packed in so tight you are practically in the laps of the people next to you. They were herding people in and out like cattle. Don't get me started on the men's room. No soap, and looked like the aftermath of a monkey house territory dispute SO MUCH HUMAN WASTE EVERYWHERE. You would think a place with a name like ""Cheesecake Factory"" would at least have good cheesecake right!? Nope. Not even clean bathrooms."
Ivy G.,"Miami, FL",174,49,130,5.0,11/12/2015,"Food is always delicious! I always stick to the chicken madeira. The chicken is soft and juicy, the sauce is incredibly flavorful. Love this place (:"
Eric C.,"Miami, FL",0,17,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Food is good no different than any other Cheesecake Factory you go to obviously. But they have a horrible sewer stench if you are sitting in the outside patio. It was not a one time thing it happens a lot, and it takes away your appetite. I recommend sitting inside."
E D.,"Hialeah, FL",8,70,67,1.0,6/16/2016,Sorry. Can't give it more than one star as we went here around 3 pm (not rush time) and it felt like we were in a zombie apocalypse. It took us just 20 minutes to speak to the hostess! By the time we reached her we took a good look around and decided to leave as the place was out of control packed.
Yannick G.,"Las Vegas, NV",127,40,129,4.0,6/9/2015,"Doing my monthly greedy cheese cake run w/ the wifey to get our (2) Lemoncello Torte Cakes and Trying a Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake, would have them five stars if they would've chopped up the fresh strawberries we always pay extra for hmm, might just stick to Sawgrass and Las Olas. Tsk-tsk!"
Jesse M.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,3,10,1.0,1/25/2016,Came in on Jan 25 2016 around 8pm the manager was very rough on us we were a party of 10 told us 3 hrs wait then we told him to spread us out he sedan no way . If this is service that I don't knew what to say
Paula V.,"Miami Beach, FL",447,111,52,2.0,4/3/2016,"Slow service my shrimp dish tasted very fishy, however after I told the server she sniffed the dish in front of me and walked away, still paid for it. Working in the industry what she did was wrong, still left her a good tip and walked away. Never coming back."
Christian F.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,8,20,5.0,12/24/2015,"Every time  I go to the aventura mall I stop by this place and get a peace of cake to go, I never stayed for eating but looks good, I'm not a cake fan but I'm starting to be so definitely recommended"
