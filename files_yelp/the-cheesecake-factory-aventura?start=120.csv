S S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,19,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Usually go to FTL (Las Olas Cheescake F) where service is terrible, but this location is even worse.  Don't ever go with children! I asked to reserve seating for 9 before our whole party arrived, they told me no problem, it was early (10:30am),.  When everyone arrived, they had done NOTHING and we still had to wait 20 minutes ""for them to put tables together."" Annoying service, lack of basic customer thoughtfulness, little sensitive to family with children, despite extensive KIDS menu.  Will never return to another CF!"
Joseph D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,1,5.0,12/23/2016,I loved this place is my first time on yelp doing a review but i think this place deserve it!! The classic cheese burger is amazing plus the mojito is a great combination!!
Neuthan R.,"Baltimore, MD",1,26,15,1.0,4/30/2016,Rude hostess..didn't eat here.  I can't stand poor customer service.  We went next door to Rosalia.  The food and service were superb.
Sanita M.,"Tampa, FL",125,383,2135,4.0,5/21/2012,"Great restaurant with delicious, big portions and pretty good prices. We had some little problems with our waitresses few times, not always they are friendly and nice. But the food is excellent. Love their salads, tamales, Shepherd's pie, fries, chicken. Only once we had some sort of Thai food and it was not good. Super yummy cakes.. tried many of them, love them all. My favorites are: White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cake, Pumpkin-Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. My husband loves Godiva and Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecakes."

Verdine L.,"Miami, FL",2,20,7,1.0,6/7/2016,"I usually enjoy eating at Cheesecake Factory, however, on this particular day the service was horrible. It was a Sunday and the wait for a table was 30 minutes plus. I didn't really mind waiting because it was understandably packed. When we were seated we sat for 15 minutes before a server approached us. That was only to say out waitress was working a ""double"". The guy took our order for drinks and we submitted an order for food because there was no telling when we would get our actual server. This girl showed up 30 minutes after we placed our order. She didn't even check on our table after the food came. Needless to say no tip was provided. Worse experience with a waitress thus far."
Nicolas P.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/7/2016,"Terrible service. Management seems to have change or something but the food's quality has gone down, manager doesn't even care about your complaint and if you sit outside be prepared to wait another 15 minutes for somebody to even show up. Sucks because CCF is one of my favorite restaurants but this one, for the past year has been a rip off 90% of the time!"
Fiorella B.,"Miami, FL",112,107,112,5.0,3/20/2016,Angel our sever was very nice and the food was great! Everything warm and came just in time to the table! We didn't have to wait long for service and overall even though is a chain restaurant I will always come back specially to this specific location
Danelia N.,"Hollywood, FL",16,89,210,5.0,5/26/2015,"By far the best location. The service is always great and the wait is usually very short even when it looks packed. If you are into pasta dishes, I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, it is a big portion so be ready to take some home for leftovers."
NB K.,"Oceanside, CA",2,175,1,2.0,5/16/2015,"The food is predictable and good.  The portions are large.  Our server was polite, sweet and knowledgeable.  The prices are reasonable.  But -- and this is not particular to this particular restaurant in the chain, it is endemic -- the noise level is atrocious!  Worse than the adults are the ill-behaved children, who are allowed to scream, yell and raise their voices without their guardians lifting an eye fro their telephones. In this restaurant, in particular, I noticed that our tabletop was in dire need of refinishing.  The shellac or topcoat was peeling and cracked.  I found it discomforting. I will probably return, for all the positive things I've said about Cheesecake Factory.  I know what I face when I enter the door."
Emma B.,"Doral, FL",71,148,130,5.0,9/27/2015,"The best thing that i like the cheesecake factory is desserts. A lot of nice cakes that we can order for a dessert. I like their chocolate cake with cream the best. It tastes not so sweet, a little sticky, so delicious. I always order a desert when i have dinners here"
Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623,3.0,1/19/2015,The restaurant was very crowded and noisy. The server was friendly and attentive. The decor is beautiful and clean. I enjoyed my Chicken Romano because I love the flavors however it was served cold today. My husband enjoyed his chicken Madiera
Dan G.,"Toronto, Canada",62,79,767,3.0,1/23/2014,"Great food, great cakes, however the waiting time to get a table sucks. We usually have to wait at least 20 min to 1 hour, and service might get very slow."
Grace S.,"Miami, FL",9,66,77,4.0,5/29/2015,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory in Aventura is always a hurdle because parking sucks. The establishment and food is always reliable. What's to love on the menu you say? Steak Diane, the wine drenched angus steak with mash potatoes and onions (my most recent fave), the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and the chicken enchiladas (with accompanying white rice and black beans). The avocado wraps make great appetizers (if you can squeeze that in with the main plate). The hefty portions are beyond generous. The Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and fresh strawberry cheesecake are both delicious but the main dish usually never leaves much room for dessert. This location as well as the ones in Dadeland Mall and Pembroke Pines Shops are suitable for a dinner with the family or a brunch with friends. I came here for birthdays (mines and family members) and graduations (high school and university)."
Lanise A.,"Miami, FL",7,85,98,4.0,5/11/2015,"Went here with my mom for Mother's Day brunch. I've visited this location a few times over the years and nothing has really changed. I think people were already waiting to come inside before 10am because when we got there at 10:15 they were already busy. I only had to wait about two minutes for a table. Instead of seating us at a booth, we were in the seating areas here it was two to a table. I would've rather had a booth because I and another patron felt a little clustered being so close to the tables. I had the four cheese lunch pasta and mom ordered the Brulee French Toast. Our bread was good too. We now know that the best time to come to this restaurant and do some shopping is around lunch or brunch time."
Jouberte M.,"Miami Beach, FL",81,3,2,1.0,11/10/2016,"Rudest manager experience I have ever had. I order a combo, salmon and steak, steak medium rare and it came out extremely rare. My very nice server came, took it to get cooked up for me. When it came back it was well done, so she  had them start my whole plate over. New person brought me a whole new plate but with chicken. As I do not eat chicken I gave it to my companion as my server didn't come back for a few minutes. The steak was again well done again and at this point I no longer feel like eating, but the server sends out the steak (hopefully cooked correctly) in a to go bag. When we ask for the check, my dish is still on it. Given that it was sent back as many times as it was I figured I at least given a discount, having not been able to eat my meal. So the manager comes out and very rudely says that we should be thankful because I got 3 plates for the price of one.... meaning the 3 plates that were messed up and were sent back. She then asked where the chicken on the 3rd plate went, and I said my friend took it since I don't eat chicken. She then said that she would have to charge my friend for it if she was going to take it, even though we never ordered it. Mind you, it's not just what she is saying, its the eye rolling and condescension. Rather than have them toss , since I already pushed it around with my fork, I gave it to my friend. It is their fault for giving me the wrong dish. She then made my friend take it out of her to go box and put it on a plate to throw away! At this point I'm beyond upset and tell her to take my packed side (the fourth attempt to get it right) and to just take it all off of the check. She was so nasty and condescending the whole time, and refused to tell me her name. I promptly asked for another manger who was much more understanding and apologized on the other woman's behalf. I know it's a casual restaurant but  I expect the management to at the very least be civilized. If you're going to work in the service industry I would hope the establishment that hires you would at least supplement your lack of decency and home training for customer service training."
Karen G.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",94,141,288,4.0,3/9/2014,The lemon ricotta pancakes (served only for Sunday brunch) are to die for. They are also huge so they're great for sharing.
Leonard G.,"Hialeah, FL",80,20,98,5.0,6/23/2015,Always have a great time and great food at a Cheesecake Factory. We had two excellent dishes and a bottle of Cliquot Champagne. Great food great times.
Tina V.,"City of Industry, CA",314,454,653,3.0,2/8/2014,"Cheesecake factory chain is like any chain, giant portions for family with ok food.  Of all the Cheesecake factory restaurant I been to in CA and FL, I liked this one better. They know how to make the Cajun Jambalayan pasta extra spicy without making it salty as hell like the other restaurants.  I still love me some Godiva cheesecake.  Overall 3/5 its aok in my book."
Anna G.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",43,5,2,1.0,3/20/2016,"the service was terrible, we were waiting for the server 15 minutes to order drinks, dirty plates remained on the table all the time for dinner. waiting for the check 25 minutes, then another 15 minutes for brink it back! after there was no pen! asked another waiter about pen, she did not have one and told us wait our server! Are you kidding me??? Food was good as always!"
