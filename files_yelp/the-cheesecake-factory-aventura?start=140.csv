Melissa N.,"North Miami Beach, FL",125,160,72,3.0,2/8/2015,This place has been my families go to while shopping since I can remember and to tell you the truth it does a great job to feed hungry shoppers! Huge plates that we always order to share so everyone gets a little bit of everything.  Our faves: - sweet corn tamale cakes - avocado egg rolls - chicken Thai wraps - sliders  - bistro shrimp pasta - banana cream cheesecake - clam chowder (soup of the day) We have tried a whole lot more and cannot complaint. You'll make a line to sit here for sure but it's service is fast and they take big groups.
Michael S.,"Surfside, FL",61,434,231,2.0,11/24/2014,"We came at dinner time. The service was lousy. The waitress was very inept whenever she was helping us which wasn't very often because she was never around. We were there for 2 hours due to her horrible service. We didn't mind the time though as we were having dinner with friends. The food was decent. I ordered the Old Fashioned Burger, which was cooked medium properly. It took at least 5 minutes to get mustard, which I had to get a different server to help me with that.  The prices are reasonable given the portions and they have a very diverse menu with selections to please almost everyone. The ambiance was very dark and loud. We had to use our cell phones to read the menus and we had to talk very loud to hear one another. I typically avoid chains and I will avoid this one in the future."
Aisha R.,"Miami, FL",16,43,231,5.0,8/8/2016,We went to cheesecake factory and we had for our appetizer a southern chicken sliders it was very good. My entree I had a chicken and biscuit it is not like the traditional southern chicken and biscuit. The chicken is not fried and breaded. The biscuit was deliciou. For my drink i had a atrawberry cream sicle it was  worth it. It remind me of a grown up strawberry milk shake with alcohol.  If you are looking for a southern type of chicken biscuit try something else on the menu. The gravy was divine it had carrots and onions. The mash potatoes had a rustic taste to it. My husband had the turkey burger off the 500 and below menu. If you order the turkey burgers on the regular menu it is huge. Order the one on the menu that is 500 calories menu. The dessert I had a tiramisu cheesecake which was very delicious and my husband had the Craig crazy carrot cheesecake it was very good. The waiter was very tentative and nice so he deserve his tip.
Natalie B.,"Waterford Township, MI",13,61,80,4.0,3/9/2016,It was very busy and slow service on a Sunday night when we went.  Overall It was good.  I had the Americana hamburger with special sauce and the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  The hamburger was so huge I only ate half of it so I could save some room for the cheesecake.  I liked the location in the Aventura Mall in Miami.
Maria P.,"North Miami Beach, FL",4,16,107,3.0,2/15/2015,The wait at this restaurant is very long also the waiting area needs some organization other than that the food is good.
Karoline G.,"Hvidovre, Denmark",0,5,,3.0,9/2/2016,"We ate at this location visiting Aventura mall, and USA for the first time. I had fish tacos and my boyfriend had a chicken dish. Food was ok, and service ok - nothing absolutely extraordinary but we were satisfied. We asked for our cheesecakes to go. When the time came to paying the bill, we left what was asked for, plus a few extra $$ for tips. After the server picked up the check and counted the money, he quickly returned asking for us to follow the tipping guidelines on the bottom of the check asking us to add between 18-35% of the meal! I guess this is the norm in the US, but since it's our first time in the states we didn't know and it made us feel pretty awkward. I think a 18% tip is very high - and yes I know, it's a way to keep the wages down for servers, but 12-15 usd for one paying customer (and he probably have 30-50 customers a day) 6-7 days a week is 11.500 usd a month! I have now learned the way to tip in USA, and when coming to a different culture you have to follow the norm, but I tell you.. It is a corruptive system, that you have to pay extra to get the service you are paying for through the price on the menu. Anywho.. It's just my opinion. I still would come again, and would also recommend the Cheesecake Factory to people I know."
Annie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",145,974,6899,4.0,12/3/2011,"The first time I went to Cheesecake factory was 10 years ago at San Franciso, CA.  I loved it and I went to Cheesecake factory whenever I went down to States.   Of coz, same this time at Miami, FL. The menu  and the food quality pretty much the same (above average). The portion was huge and I never can finish it.  The cheesecake was awesome!!  Never go wrong at Cheesecake Factory"
Nastya D.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2016,"It was our favorite place in Aventura mall. Tasty food, quickly service! Every time when we coming i feel dirty pages of menu...Buuuut!!!, last time we came day time and was shocked !! So dirty ! Both menus was with parts of food on  pages ...Disgusting to take it !! Knife dirty, table didn't clean well ! In darkness we didn't see it before! Now we will not coming again, because I can imagine condition of kitchen ... Disgusting  I know how should be clean in restoran .. And this is fall of managers and all staff !!!"
Lissette P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",101,76,88,3.0,1/17/2014,"On a date night with my husband visiting Aventura mall, we decided to have dinner here on a weeknight. We arrived around 5pm before the dinner rush so we were seated within 5 minutes.  We were seated in a cozy booth and our server soon approached to take our drink orders. She was pleasant and gave us extra time as we decided on what to order from their huge menu.... ***The only complaint I must add was dirty small plates when we were seated.  Seems like they don't take the time or measures to properly clean their plates... We just used our napkins to eat the bread that they provide at the table and didn't want to ask for any ""new"" plates.  We were in the mood for a burger (and didn't want Johnny rockets upstairs) so we decided on the Kobe style burger and the Americana burger. I must admit we were a little optimistic about THIS place for burgers-BUT they were surprisingly good.  I devoured the Americana burger which has a delicious ""secret sauce"" which is a combination of ketchup mayo and what i believe are chopped capers ? With a slice of American and cheddar cheese, you cannot go wrong.  My husband had the Kobe style burger which he said was good, but wasn't crazy about the sweet taste of the BBQ-like sauce mixed with the onions and mushrooms.   For dessert we decided on the Reese's PB chocolate cheesecake - amazing and delicious! Worth every bite and every calorie.  Service was good and our waitress was attentive to us with refills and extra napkins.  A good dinner, a good experience."
Shaun W.,"Miramar, FL",229,7,31,4.0,2/27/2015,"Had lunch here yesterday, the service was fast and the food was delicious. I had to go back to work afterwards so the lunch sized portion was perfect."
Bites Amore ..,"North Miami, FL",1,25,29,4.0,1/30/2016,Excellent customer service with little to no wait! Took my family out to eat to celebrate a birthday. Worth your while!
Maria Daniela A.,"Miami Beach, FL",26,5,1,2.0,3/3/2016,"Thursday night, restaurant was packed! I Understand why service was slow.. (Waiter was very nice). But we were waiting for the check, I saw 2 small cockroaches climbing the wall behind me. Didn't say anything because I work at a restaurant and I understand that wasn't the waiter's fault. But anyways, that shouldn't ve acceptable at a Cheesecake Factory. They're lucky I'm nice because I know there are people who would have put up a show in order to get a refund and I totally understand that because you shouldn't eat with cockroaches near you."
Stacy S.,"New York, NY",7,18,5,5.0,12/29/2014,"I've gone to Cheesecake Factory many times but the food here by far was the best. The cooks must be breaking the ""cooking"" rules. It's hard to accommodate old school hungry Jamaican women, they all enjoyed and approved! Micheal our waiter was great too. Teriyaki chicken, Jamaican black pepper shrimp (not Jamaica style but still good), shrimp scampi, salmon in miso sauce, Cuban sandwich, Orange chicken, Salmon Genoese and Chicken Madeira"
Marcus Z.,"Brickell, Miami, FL",85,66,77,4.0,7/25/2015,"Every time I am at Aventura mall, I eat here. The place is always busy, and the waiting time could be really ugly during eating hours, and the waiters / waitresses are all working really hard but still not be able to serve everyone in a timely manner since each is serving way too many tables. But those cakes!!! Also food here is decent for restaurants in a mall, and the selection is huge. But if you are in a big shopping mission, and you are running out of time, skip the place since it easily takes two hours away due to the lack in waiters/tresses. But again, those cakes!!! 75/100."
Donna B.,"San Francisco, CA",313,8,,2.0,11/8/2016,"I was going to give one star.. zero if possible. But the very nice staff at the cheesecake/ Togo area are on point and very professional. My negative experience has to do with the 3 very rude young ladies at the hostess stand on 11/8/16 at 6:22pm. One whole I think may be a manager holding a walkie talkie.... I frequently order Togo after working out. Anyways, had placed my order and was waiting and noticed my phone was about to die and I needed to call uber. I have a charger and only needed an outlet. I approached the ladies at the hostess stand and politely asked if there was an outlet. I received a snark comment and that their isn't an outlet in the entire restaurant and was given her back and a giggle as they then ignored me. I returned to the Togo area and the helpful staff pointed me to an outlet I could use while I waited for my dinner. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the rude entourage at the hostess stand. Being those are the first people to talk to upon arriving you would think they would have hired much more polite people with much better personality, not to mention the way they were dressed.. all in all. Thank you to the nice girls at the Togo area. Next time I'll avoid the hostess stand."
Sabrina D.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,5.0,3/23/2015,"Surprised that this restaurant doesn't have 5 star rating. It's my favorite place with my friend Geri, we go almost every Wednesday! I am a very picky eater since my new low carb diet and the waiters are extremely patient with all my questions, substitutions and nitpicks! Before the diet, my favorites were: 1. Avocado eggrolls 2. Chicken Samosas 3. Thai Lettuce Wraps 4. BACON BACON CHEESEBURGER (OH MANN!!!) (both off and on diet, lettuce wrapped, no bun!) Our waiting times are from either 2 minutes to 10 minutes tops! Busier on weekend nights though! Really no complaints.. Favorite Drink:  I think it's called the Strawberry Creamsicle with Chocolate? HEAVENLY! I'm obsessed with this place. And proud of it! -Sabrina"
Natalia M.,"Miami Beach, FL",6,12,,5.0,1/11/2016,"I love their avocado spring rolls and the wheat bread they serve fresh without charge. I also recommend the passion fruit iced tea and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, just delicious!!!"
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,5.0,2/23/2013,"Located in North Florida at the premier shopping Destination with is Aventura Mall! I was worried that the service may be slow but after visiting twice I found it great both times.  The quality of the food was top notch, I enjoyed the Southern Fried Chicken Slider and the fried Macaroni and cheese balls, both of my favorite menu items!  The bread they serve ahead of time is delicious as well!  Having to choose from 50 kinds of Cheesecake is daunting but the Ducle De Leche is my favorite and never disappoints, the best Cheesecake we have ever had!  I live the lemonade drink with the sugar coating around the rim, with our dessert we also enjoyed a delicious Peach Smoothie drink, I could go on and on about the great menu items!   We were here during the week, so I assume on weekends there would be a large wait! I would also recommend valet parking since you can never find a parking spot in this mall."
Dara B.,"Sunrise, FL",118,395,398,3.0,7/31/2014,"National Cheesecake Day, half price a slice of cheesecake = you get half a slice of cheesecake.  No joke!!!      I ordered a pizza off of the specialty menu.   It was supposed to have Italian meat on it (similar to prosciutto).   Where's the meat.....I only got 2 tiny pieces of meat, and didn't even taste the cheese.   I guess I am a home made pizza snob and happily so!!!     I will be skipping next years' National Cheesecake Day at the Cheesecake Factory."
Gabriela P.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,2.0,7/27/2016,"I never go out of my way to write a review unless the service was over the top or just terrible. After waiting half an hour for a table our server did not visit the table or take our drink order for over 20 minutes. We sat at the table waiting without bread or water. After finally taking our drink order he did not show up to the table for over an hour, no refills, dirty plates, etc. We ended up going out of our way to bother another server who i'm sure had his own tables to worry about, and although he seemed busy the gentleman cleaned our table, refilled our glasses, and brought us our food in minutes. We are a table of TEN so it was not easy. The server who saved our wait was named Gabriel. He was so attentive and proffesional that it deserved a review. Thank you Gabriel for taking care of me and my family."
