Rodrigo V.,"Núcleo Bandeirante, Brazil",17,65,116,1.0,6/28/2014,"The service is weak. I waited several minutes for the beginning of my service, even though I had already waited several minutes to sit at the table. The waitress was  in standard mode. I will give a discount because the restaurant was full and had insufficient staff. My spoon was dirty and was replaced without a single apology. The service worked in mode inertia until the end. One thing that made me uncomfortable was the absence of a towel or paper under the cutlery that we're put directly over a marble table, which is porous and therefore not very clean. The food was satisfactory but nothing extraordinary. The price is low, but also was the service and food taste. The highlight was the cheesecake, but when he was halfway of eating it, the waitress brought the bill and I felt invited to go. Never again."
Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, NY",1,61,,2.0,7/19/2014,"Parking:  Terrible at all times of the day.  I would recommend parking near the Macy's Women and walking through the mall. Dining In: Wait times are ridiculous! They tell you ""45 minutes"" and that turns into 2 hours because ""customers have their bills but they haven't paid yet! Sorry!"" Times to Avoid:  Regardless of the day, do not go between 6:30PM - 9:30PM. You have been warned!  Take Out: I wouldn't recommend take out.  Got home and my food was cold and the sauce had bursted all over it.  I was told it would take 20 min, but it took 50 min. Paid $20 for crap.   Complaining: Manager is hard to get a hold of! I was put on hold 5 separate times for 5 minutes or more each time.  It ended in him giving me a free meal.  That's the least you could do! I would go in person if you want to lodge a complaint.... :)"
Tina R.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",1,16,,1.0,12/29/2015,"I was just at the cheesecake factory and a ROACH that's  right a  dirty filthy ROACH walked across my table,and the server wanted to give me a piece of cheesecake to make up for the filth.I will never come to your dirty establishment again.The Aventura Cheesecake factory now has ROACHES walking across the tables."
LaTonya T.,"Miami, FL",149,24,117,4.0,3/11/2014,"Always a pleasure to dine here..... We arrived to a packed foyer, when checking in with the hostess we were told we would have a 30-35 minute wait. We took our buzzer and proceeded outside to wait.  To my surprise, our buzzer buzzed after about 15 minutes.  After being seated, we were greeted by our server Ashley, who I might add did an ""AWESOME"" job... She was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we wanted.  The food is alway great and the drinks even BETTER!!!!!"
Julia L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,9,,2.0,9/12/2015,"We usually have a great experience at the CF. Not their best effort tonight. 10 minute wait time, was quoted 20 was good. Food was good. The service was mediocre at best and the kitchen was S. L. O. W. Slow slow. Almost an hour to get our food. Wait person disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. It will be a while before we come back."
Monique P.,"Bowie, MD",25,38,18,2.0,9/6/2015,"Each time (4 visits) I have been here the service has been disappointing.  Service is always slow and the servers give stale apologies.  Some don't know the menu and the food comes out slow and is sometimes cold. I usually love the cheesecake factory because of there food and go back because of it but this is my least favorite location. I do not hope to be back to this location, they need to be better with their service."
Armando C.,"Miami, FL",466,104,461,2.0,2/18/2016,"I was in Aventura and I wanted to go grab lunch. I really wanted to go to the cheesecake factory and  have a red velvet cheesecake for desert. So I got to the mall and parking took around 10 min to find. When I walked in the host greeted me and I put my name down for a party of 2 and she said it would take around 10 min to be seated. We got called and then escorted to our table. When we got to our table I did not like the location of the table they were trying to give us. It was in a corner near the kitchen and a lot of movement went by there and I wanted to get a booth or a area not near the kitchen and where I would be able to sit next to my girlfriend. When I told the host that I didn't want to sit there and if he could accommodate us at another table.  He rudely said ""go back to the host desk and ask for a new table"". This tone and comment just gave me a really bad impression and I wasn't going to spend nearly $80 dollars for really bad service. So instead of going to the host stand and asking for a new table, I went to another restaurant to ask for a table."
RA V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,92,12,5.0,10/3/2015,Excellent food.  Stuffed chicken enchiladas are awesome.  Complimentary wheat and sour dough bread is great.  The cheesecakes are fantastic but the strawberry shortcake is awesome as well.
NyShell R.,"Kissimmee, FL",36,166,29,2.0,2/11/2015,"Three (3)stars for the Chain, one(1) star for this location.  I really, really, really dislike this location, for a number of reasons, with food quality and service being right up there at the top of my list.   The food chain on a whole: The service and food quality is just ok, the entree prices are fair, but the cheesecakes are very over priced, $8.00 per slice, nevertheless some of the cheesecakes are very tasty, though most are to rich and loaded with whip cream.  Some locations are way better than others, and some locations suck. This location: SUCKS, this one and the one down south at Dolphin Mall, just don't! Note: This particular location is always busy due to tourist so if your looking to come for an early lunch, or to be in and out, I suggest going to a different location.  I don't recommend this location, if possible go on the otherside to Grand Lux instead.  Next to Bloomingdales."
Julie A.,"Miami, FL",17,76,42,4.0,7/5/2014,"I've been a client of The Cheesecake Factory for over 20 years and fortunately I've never been let down.  The service is usually fast and to the point, don't expect the polish attention you might encounter in a upscale restaurant,  this one has to do volumes. So you are in and out..  Their portions are huge, one ends up with the ""doggy Bag"" on the way out.  Anyways,  the reason I always come here is for their salivating Tex Mex rolls and ahi tempura rolls.  Always so yummy and my next favorite is their salads, love them all.. And of course their assortments of cheesecakes, but I always stick to the original with strawberries on top.  Soft and creamy.   The uncomfortable wait standing against a wall with their beeper device in hand is worth it. Once one passes the preface the next won't disappoint."
Gabriela G.,"Hallandale, FL",1,3,,2.0,10/29/2015,20 /25minutes waiting for a table . 1 hour for our food...just burgers and a sandwich!! Not worth the wait. Take your cheesecake home...have lunch somewhere else!
Diego R.,"Miami Beach, FL",12,1,,1.0,10/24/2015,"I'm writing this review waiting for the check... If you want a terrible service from the beginning you should go to this restaurant.... Awful  awful really awful.. Ryan S. On aventura mall florida.. Give us a terrible service, forgot one of the plates come on and the shrimps where overcook... Conclusion don't go to this place, don't waste your time and money.  If I could give cero stars...."
Jeffrey F.,"Miami, FL",120,180,200,4.0,5/3/2014,"Consistently good food, and very good service. Assuming you don't get there at prime time when there is a huge rush the service is usually excellent and the food was good. We had the cob salad, meatloaf dinner, and two kids meals. The cob salad was very good and very fresh. The meatloaf was always money, and always a favorite. The kids got the slider hamburger appetizers and a quesadilla which were both right on the money as well. We skipped the cheesecake appetizer which I don't think it's worth it at $10 a slice but if that's your thing enjoy it is good I've had it before."
Emily S.,"Miami, FL",110,171,105,4.0,4/25/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory. The food is delicious, and the service is excellent."
Einav M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,8,1,1.0,3/5/2015,The worse service and food ever!!!!! Don't go there food is not fresh and cold and the manager don't even care when we waiting 2 hours for this horrible food !!!!
Paul W.,"Miami, FL",876,1200,548,4.0,10/13/2009,"Normally I'd never give 4 stars to a chain restaurant such as The Cheesecake Factory, but when I met some friends for dinner here a few nights ago, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.  One of the things I noted in a past review of another Cheesecake Factory location was that I felt they needed to reduce the huge size of their portions to something a bit more manageable, and at the same time reduce their pricing accordingly. I'd always felt like a stuffed pig after eating at one of these restaurants, and would leave nearly as much uneaten food on the plate as I'd consumed, as their portions were so large.  During this weekend's visit, it seemed they finally got it right. I ordered the chicken and cashew salad from their ""specialties"" menu. It was $12 which is reasonable, the portion size was manageable (though there were only 3 or 4 small strips of chicken in the salad - a bit on the stingy side) and for the first time ever at one of these restaurants, I felt I had enough room at the end of the meal to enjoy a slice of their namesake dessert - cheesecake.  I'll also say that, though parking was next to impossible on this night (I ended up parking about a city block away and hiking), our party of 4 was seated quickly, especially considering the place was full of patrons. Also, the service was excellent on this night, our waiter was attentive and stopped by several times to offer refills on water or drinks, the food was served relatively quickly and the staff was friendly."
Bianca B.,"Hollywood, FL",62,112,66,1.0,12/31/2014,"Me and my friends walked in and it was very busy. Kids were running a muck and knocking into adults that were all crammed at the reservation desk to get seats.  Where are the parents of the wild children running as if they're at disney world?  I don't know. Anyway we finally get to the receptionist and my friend asked ""excuse me, how long is the wait."" Waitress with the long red hair said nothing. That's okay, she probably didn't hear us. Again my friend asked another question to the lady. ""Excuse me?"" After she finally gave us her full attention, she answered with a ""Yes?"" OH lord this lady is trying it. My friend asked for a menu  again (mind you, we asked her twice.) Finally the lady gave us a take out menu... Now if I wanted a take out menu, I would've waited at the take out order line. The 4 of us were waiting to be seated or given a time for when the next table would be available.  *sighs* WE asked to know if we can get a better menu with everything on it. WE aslo asked when the next available table will be open. The red head receptionist said ""We don't have anymore menus!"" and went on to the next person as if we were at a cafeteria homeless line and not a well known eating establishment. Disgusted.. I left and went to nordstroms cafe which was way better when it came to customer service. I understand that they were busy, but a lot of people felt stranded and nothing was organized. Plus me and my friends got attitude for asking two simple questions after we waited in line to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. because I have a zero tolerance policy, me  and the rest of my friends left and went somewhere that had everything in order."
John P.,"Grayslake, IL",1,14,1,1.0,8/4/2015,Can you give zero stars.  The absolute worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.  Party of 9 and each dish came out one by one about 5-10 min apart from each other.  The last two never came out and one was a salad and other was pasta.  Not that freakin difficult to make.  Don't waste your time or money at this disaster of a ran place.  Then they came to say we screwed your salad up and we are making another one.  Then that one came out after everybody was already finished and it had zero dressing on it.  Can you say the worst service by far.
Silvia C.,"Hialeah, FL",2,57,35,4.0,7/26/2015,"Hugeee portions, great staff, great tasting food. Long wait & the parking situation isn't the best. But it is still a good restuarant. Everyone does a good job there, it is just always busy. You can go get a bite after shopping all day or anything else. Great location."
Leomaris M.,"Hollywood, FL",167,55,56,1.0,11/25/2014,"I am only wasting 2 minutes of my life to say It is sad to see a place like this dropping the ball the way they are. My dinner last night was a disaster from start to end. But they don't care anyway, it's not that is going to affect the sales... NOPE! Sorry Bella Luna for being so stupid last night and not going over to you, won't happen again!"
