Gus C.,"Hialeah, FL",0,7,,4.0,8/2/2015,We have been to this particular location several times. There is always a long wait but the food is worth it. The food and atmosphere was great as always. The service was very good and the staff was very tentative and friendly.
Pano P.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,6,4,1.0,12/2/2013,"Make sure you come here if you like to be treated like they are making you a favor. Terrible service in general, food waaaay overpriced for its quality and a feeling that you are never going to matter to them."
Greg M.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",16,82,11,4.0,11/13/2013,"First of all, I am lactose intolerant. That being said, I went here because whenever we are in Miami my dad loves to stop by.  Aside from not being able to have any cheesecake, I like it here! It's consistent and decent priced food, with giant portions. It does sometimes take forever to get a seat, and there are often giant groups of tourists (like myself) that are hungry and cranky. However, once you sit down it feels a bit more calm. I would recommend the cheesecake but I wouldn't know!"
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,5.0,10/17/2013,"I didn't think I'd ever rate them this high, but I have to give the coveted 5 star award to the Cheesecake Factory.  I've fallen in love with this restaurant all over again. It's no wonder they have been around for so long.  The offer consistently high quality food at reasonable prices.  Atmosphere is always lively and service was excellent too.  Portions are huge and the place is a great value.  And who can say no to cheesecake?  And during October they have Pumpkin and Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake?  Who doesn't love that??? If you can avoid the madness and long waits during peak times, you really can't go wrong here.   Good job, guys!"
Javier O.,"Hialeah, FL",24,1,,5.0,7/4/2015,This afternoon my wife and I had lunch here. Our server was very nice and helpful. He was very understanding to my wife and brought take out boxes when we asked for them. Let's not forget the cheesecakes we bought to take home.
Katie L.,"Wellington, FL",287,606,22,3.0,6/4/2013,"I've been going to Cheesecake Factory's for over 15 years now, and in all that time I would say they have been pretty consistent. It's not my first, second or third choice when dining out but when you want a reliable meal at a decent price, then this is not a bad option.  I usually go for a salad or sandwich. I also normally order Fried Calamari as an appetizer. Unfortunately at this location, the calamari wasn't as good as it usually is.  My least favorite part about this particular dining experience was that they sat us right next to a server station and 5 different servers were loud and complaining about all their tables. It made them look very unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable.  Besides that, it is what it is."
U L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,33,156,1.0,2/14/2015,"All of our dishes were mediocre. My two friends enjoyed their meals mostly because they were starving... Could've gotten better quality at a diner. I ordered the Renee's lunch special (half a turkey sandwich, mixed green salad, soup of the day which was a shitty loaded potato soup with bacon and green onions). Soup tasted like canned soup.Went with three other people and two of them ordered the mahi-mahi fish of the day, they asked for it blackened, and it wasn't even close to that. Presentation was similar to middle school cafeteria food. I used to love their firecracker salmon rolls. Today we were given a plate of 93% red cabbage and 4 measly rolls. For $11. Boyfriend and I's bill came out to $48 for garbage food.  Never again, ruined my day. Also, they brought me my Renee's special without the soup and that left me wondering how long it takes to ladle already made soup into a bowl. Told the waiter I was disappointed with my soup. He did nothing but half-heartedly apologize.  I left hungry. I want my money back."
Manny R.,"Hollywood, FL",18,36,25,1.0,9/7/2014,"Waited about ten minutes for a table to only be seated next to a family of screaming kids. To my left, a dirty wall splattered with condiments over time. Food was ok at best and the strawberry caipirinhas were the worst. If the presentation is this bad in customer facing areas, god knows what the kitchen looks like. At the end of it all, slightly disgusted."
Pamela Y.,"Canyonville, OR",7,112,65,4.0,3/15/2015,This was a good Cheesecake Factory.  They were so busy but very organized.  We had the Orange chicken and the sausage and ricotta flatbread pizza.  Both were fresh.  The had a large selection of specialty drinks but we did not have one.  The menu is like a book.  We also were to full to have the cheesecake but have had it before.  It is so yummy.  Enjoy
Edwin A.,"Orlando, FL",65,81,16,4.0,3/22/2013,"Im a huge fan of cheesecake factory for many reasons.   The only bad side is the wait in the beginning.  Although they have a good system give out pagers while you wait, no one likes waiting. OH, and I feel that when sitting in the mini tables its like were just too close to the next table.  Having a private conversation becomes a bit of a challenge. Besides that the food is amazing.  The waiter service is great regardless if its busy. The menu is overwhelming where some pages have aprox 30 different items with no visual. You do have an option to sit outdoors which is very nice. I always have a great experience dinning at this location."
Antita B.,"Miami Beach, FL",79,76,43,5.0,1/1/2014,"Everything is good here. Love spinach dip and my favorite is fried mac and cheese. Ive ate so many things on their menu, everything is so good!"
Angelo A.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,5.0,11/6/2014,I go into Cheesecake from time to time and sit at the bar just to grab a bite and enjoy a drink while I shop around the mall. I always receive great service from friendly staff and wanted to specifically point out a bartender named Jason who took excellent care of me with extensive knowledge of the food and drink menu.
Zonia Z.,"Madrid, Spain",49,228,157,4.0,12/22/2013,"I am so Happy the offer a menu which offers a variety of plates with lower calories. Great! I had the shrimp and angel pasta, which was great!"
Alon G.,"Toronto, Canada",16,117,,2.0,2/21/2016,"i feel like the cheesecake factory used to be better. the restaurant is at a nice location in the mall, but it's very crowded and busy. considering the hefty price, there's better food nearby."
Kensey R.,"Brandywine, MD",7,16,55,5.0,2/8/2015,Always enjoy the food served here.  Service is usually very good.  Sunday afternoon can be a bit crowded.
Kimberley N.,"Mississauga, Canada",111,364,110,2.0,7/20/2011,"Now I understand why America is the fattest country in the world! The portions at The Cheesecake Factory are ginormous!  The food here isn't the greatest yet they are always packed! It must be the experience and/or environment that people enjoy? We waited approximately 30 minutes to get a table. Our server was very pleasant and made sure that we ordered something that we would enjoy. Did I mention that the floor was dirty underneath our table? I felt really gross knowing that there was food and garbage under my flip flops. Me and my sister both ordered the angel hair pasta with jumbo shrimps. My mom got the original burger and my dad got the buffalo chicken wings as a dinner instead of an appetizer. The food took a longggg time to arrive because we finished the entire bread basket while waiting for our food. When we got our food, we were shocked by how huge the portions were. Me and my sister should've shared the pasta because we didn't finish it and had it for breakfast the next morning. Basically, no one finished their meals instead of my dad...actually he didn't really finish because he gave 3-4 of his wings to us. We never had a chance to try out their cheesecakes because we were always too stuffed. It must be awesome since it's called The Cheesecake Factory. Would I go here again? This is my 2nd time but I would probably go again since they don't have any restaurants in Canada yet. But this wouldn't be my first or second choice..."
Megan M.,"Hollywood, FL",459,522,920,4.0,4/18/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory bring back so many memories for me. I've had dates here, I had drinks here for my 21st birthday, and this location was a special spot for my girlie date nights with Tiffany T. back in high school and summers home from college.  I don't think I've ever had bad service here. Some experiences have been better than others, but never a bad time. I have a love/hate relationship with their menu because there are TOO many choices. I try to get something different every time, but I usually end up picking from just a few things I know I love. Their chicken salad sandwich and the Chicken Costoletta are both delicious and enough for 2-3 meals. I always get a side salad with the vinaigrette with the sandwich, and the Costoletta dish comes with potatoes and asparagus. Believe me when I say, they are HUGE. I also love their lettuce wraps, and I like that in recent years, they've expanded their menu to add small plates. I had the chicken croquettes and pork buns recently and both were really yummy, and it was inexpensive, especially for the portion. Their cheesecakes are amazing, of course. My favorite is the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. That just sounds decadent, doesn't it? It definitely is, but split it because it's way too rich to eat the whole thing.  I usually avoid chains, but Cheesecake Factory is one that I like, and although the food isn't even close to the quality of what you'd get at some of Miami's finer restaurants, it is tasty and a good value. My only complaint about this location is that there is always a wait. I usually wait in the bar area until they call for us because those tables are first come, first serve, so I'll snag a table if one becomes available before they call us."
Monica F.,"Miami, FL",10,24,26,5.0,1/17/2016,wait was long for a table but the food was delicious and prices are good too because the portions and diversity in menu items is great... so overall i will come back and i had a good time.
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/8/2014,I've been to this Aventura Cheesecake Factory a million times they always have great food and a friendly staff
Lisa M.,"Nyack, NY",24,48,,2.0,2/3/2015,I will make this short.   Walked in    Told 5 min.  Went to look at cheescake. Saw people being seated after us.   Asked why.  They misplaced our ticket.  They went to seat us. Table was dirty made us walk to front and apologized.   Meanwhile were seating other tables of 2 befor us.  Pissed me off. Sat at diff table.  Complained to manager.  Se said she would speak to staff and apologized.  We got nothing but heartburn.  Bad service bad business.  I think hire ups should speak to that female manager.
