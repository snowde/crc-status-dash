Izabella Z.,"Grand Rapids, MI",74,6,20,4.0,7/30/2014,"I absolutely love coming here! Super busy on the weekends; for a table for two its about a 20 min wait. During the week, the place is busy but getting a table is almost instanteous. Staff is friendly and quick. Food is good. The regular items on the menu are big portions so if you're not looking to throw away half of your meal than my advice would be to order off of the ""Skinny Menu"". Less variety but smaller portions and less calories (if you're calorie conscious). Cheesecakes are exquisitely delightful! I've tried many different kinds and can't always seem to finish them because they are very very rich and fill you up quick! Enjoyable place!"
Matt E.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,2,,4.0,10/18/2014,So much better than the Olive Garden just down the road. Maybe a couple dollars more but much very much worth it. They have a huge menu so bring the whole family.
Inas A.,"Davie, FL",0,12,20,1.0,7/23/2015,"Yesterday I was in the Aventura area and me and family decided to get something to eat. We walked in and gave our name. The wait was 30 minutes so we went to walk around. We got a text saying our table was ready. We were right outside so we went to the counter and said we got the text so they told us to wait towards the window so we did. They then proceeded to call several other tables while we waited for almost 20 minutes. We went up to the counter twice within the 20 minutes to tell them we were waiting. On the second time we went up to the counter the lady told us ""We called you, you didn't hear us"" Which after she said that I was appalled. Forgetting about that we were taken to our table by another lady. When we got to the table it was covered with bread crumbs and spilt drinks. We then had to stand for 5 minutes while the bus boys cleaned the table and set it for us. When she was placing the menus down we asked why we didn't get a booth (another party of four came a sat down right after us) she said ""Those are for parties of 6"" even though they were the same number party as us. Our waiter came right after we had sat down and asked for our orders and then took our drink orders. We waited for the food. We got our fire roasted artichokes and they were supposed to be served warm but were slightly warm on the inside and cold on the outside. We called the manager to ask if they were supposed to be served cold or hot because different restaurants serve them in different ways. It took an average amount of time to get the rest of the food. The food was okay we got three entrées and one appetizers. We started eating and it was all fine. Then as we were eating my brother found plastic in his shepards pie. We told the server and he called a manager. When the manager came he apologized and said he doesn't know where that could have come from. He said he would take care of it and took the plate. We asked for the check and some boxes to take the other entrées. We payed and left. Over all this was a horrible experience and something I would never expect from this location. Most likely not returning to the location. I would stick to the Sawgrass Mills Mall location. Grand Lux in Aventura Mall is a great option and the staff is much nicer."
Krisitna M.,"Miami, FL",15,26,1,3.0,9/17/2014,go during happy hour sit at the bar & try the peanut chicken for $5. so delicious but ask for the peanut sauce on the side so it stays crispy. YUUUUMMMM
Driss R.,"Miami Beach, FL",64,21,5,1.0,11/1/2014,Stay away from this place. It's a mad house. They will get your order wrong and restaurant managers don't care as they have people and tourists waiting in line. They took  45 minutes to serve me the worse burger in town. Stay away if you don't want to get aggravated and waste your money.
Jennifer S.,"London, United Kingdom",402,587,39,4.0,4/21/2010,"OMG! YUM! Can't say the food isn't spectacular! Everything on the menu is to dye for. All 1 million calories of it. The Blackened Chicken Sandwich is yum! The only reason they get 4 stars and not 5, is that if I ate here everday, i would way over 500 pounds. And I treat this lunch spot as a rarity. Shame! Cause when I come here, I enjoy stuffing my gob!"
Leslie S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,20,5,5.0,7/15/2015,One of my favorite places! I love their avocado egg rolls. A little pricey but the portions make up for it. I recommend sharing with a date or a friend!
Jeniffer L.,"North Miami Beach, FL",28,118,6,2.0,1/3/2014,I have never gone back ever since my last experience. After waiting for almost 2 hours my boyfriend and I were finally seated after about 30-45 minutes of just sitting and waiting no one came and we left. I tried to reach out to management but they couldn't care less they're worried about their money instead if service. Otherwise Cheesecake Factory is known for their desserts which is why I gave 2 stars. But I don't even go for that because of how crappy the service is
Gina H.,"Miami, FL",973,610,673,5.0,7/7/2009,"Ah sweet mother of the divine overload. I ate too much again.  And I only ate HALF of what was put in front of me.  My mother would have had a FIT...""with all the starving children in the world"".  Ah ma, these days we box it up and take it home. ROASTED VEGETABLES AND GOAT CHEESE PIZZA  Roasted Japanese Eggplant, Red and Yellow Peppers, Grilled Onion, Artichokes, Kalamata Olives, Tomato and Mozzarella.  HOT and super tasty and drizzled with virgin olive oil.   I had a ""Lunch"" size portion with a side salad.  Both of which were HUGE...I could only eat half of each.  Seriously, one is big enough for two people.. Bob had the Luau chicken, again lunch portion which was also HUGE.  I love that too.  I love the wonton wafer they put in between layers of the salad. We didn't have to wait at 1p.m. on a Tuesday and our server was a superstar...really really good. But then...terror struck... Bob: We can't come to Cheesecake Factory and not have Cheesecake. Me: I don't do dessert Bob: BUT ITS CHEESECAKE Me: I especially don't like dessert that is cheesecake Super Server: Do you want the dessert menu Bob/me: YES!/NO! Bob: OK - you choose...it's your day Me: OK Hmmm..Lemoncello cake.. Layers of Vanilla Cake and Lemon Mascarpone Cream Topped with Streusel and Served with Strawberries and Whipped Cream Best kept secret at Cheesecake Factory."
Michael R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/27/2015,"Nothing beats asking a simple question, then being told to ""stand off the side or in the corner, out of the way and wait,"" better than having your server yell at you after asking for your check, then asking for a manager, to have a manager lie to you then blatantly refuse to cover two sodas and a juice. The two managers on duty couldn't keep their stories straight and this was all stemmed from me asking, "" who do I check in with or how do you know I am here?"". If you want to be publically humiliated by a server and hostess, don't let this place pass you by."
Tobi G.,"Miami, FL",6,60,,4.0,8/6/2012,"O.K. So it is a Chain Restaurant, but it is a GOOD ONE.  It just never fails.  If there was not a line, I would worry, but the line does move fast and you can always try to sit in the bar, if there is a seat there is no waiting.  They also have an outside patio to eat in when the weather is nice. The food and service is good either place. It really is worth waiting for.  They are open for lunch and dinner and there is something for everyone.  I love the Lettuce Wrap and the Cobb Salad, the Hamburgers are delicious.  We never had a bad meal. Aventura is lucky to have this gem.  Hope you enjoy it also."
Luis S.,"Miami Beach, FL",33,20,,4.0,5/2/2013,"What's not to like about Cheesecake Factory?  Most of their dishes are large portions which gives you somewhat of a satisfaction, but of course, there are the desserts.  My favorite things here are the Hummus, Teriyaki Chicken, and Tiramisu Dessert (not the cheesecake) Anyone within the reading distance of my review should try these selections and lmk how happy you are afterwards. And if you're not, lmk where I can send you your money back!  jk. but you'll thank me for the recommendations."
Mikey V.,"Orlando, FL",203,88,,4.0,5/2/2011,"Alright, Cheesecake Factory. You're fatty, overcrowded- and you're service really isn't the best. Taking all of this into consideration, I want to let you know one thing: I love you. That shrimp bistro pasta thing is absolutely finger-licking good. I keep coming back for more. And the bread, oh... the bread with the butter... melting in my mouth. I want you. I want you IN ME and I want you NOW. I'll be seeing you soon, my darling Cheesecake Factory."
J. S.,"Miami, FL",107,382,111,5.0,3/9/2012,"Say whatever you want about Cheesecake -- too many 'non-locals' and foreigners, long waiting period, big portions, whatever... The haters' usually end up coming the most. If you're worried about waiting, then don't go to Cheesecake; for whatever time you spend bumping into rich foreigners, you'd have wasted a well considerable amount of time. It's a chain, folks, it's to be given. That being said, I did experience a long wait, and understanding the high-volume pace that a chain habitually brings, I had no problem waiting a few... a couple... alright, it was a long wait dammit', but I knew the food was going to be worth it. Me and a friend chose to sit outside, and we were immediately spotted by our server. The menu, which should include a dawm encyclopedia, is undoubtedly one of the longest menus' I've taken to read. If this is your first time at Cheesecake, make sure you're good at narrowing down brackets. My sever was extremely busy, yet she still had the skill to keep us contempt with bread and water refills. Furthermore, the food did come out in reasonable amount of time, and I really have to say our server was phenomenal, and this coming out of a chain. I ordered a Chicken Madeira, and it was very tasty and filling, all of which I look for in a restaurant.  The anorexic-NYU hipsters can keep Per Se, I'm happy with good ol' CF."
Rosaly C.,"Miami, FL",140,13,3,2.0,3/31/2014,"Went there yesterday and it was extremely crowded, I could hear the conversation of the servers and the couple next to us. The server was very dry didn't even tell us her name and didn't really get the order right.  Maybe weekends aren't a good day to come here. Very crowded and dark. Didn't really like this cheese cake factory. I would like to give it one star but I've only been to this one once so wouldn't be fair to rate it that after one experience."
Ed G.,"Miami, FL",37,17,6,5.0,9/29/2013,"Love this restaurant, the bread are freshly bake. The cheesecakes are really mouth watering. The menu's are exciting! Been here lot's of times, have to avoid peak hours because you'll wait even for 1 hour! If your going to eat lunch make sure 11am your already there and if it's dinner 6pm as early as possible so that you won't get upset by waiting. Otherwise this restaurant is really a must to see and dine in."
Dre B.,"Miami, FL",212,294,897,5.0,7/21/2013,"We all know Cheesecake Factory. Huge menu, big portions, lots of cheesecake. The Aventura location is as busy as it gets, with lots of mallgoers packing the host desk. But once you're seated the service is good, food is quality (for cheesecake factory) and that's that."
Evangelia K.,"New York, NY",57,274,1,2.0,2/8/2012,"I've been here a number of times and I find the food to be a bit heavy and greasy.  Also overpriced for fast food. Their cheesecake is good though, so I would stick to that!"
Mike U.,"Hollywood, FL",271,249,1257,4.0,12/3/2011,"This is one of my all time favorite place to casually dine in.  It has never failed me and it is always consistently good no matter what location I go to.  The service is very good here, very attentive staff.   This Cheesecake is located in a very busy mall, so therefore the wait can be quite long sometimes...But there is always the bar area for first come, first serve. You cannot go wrong at Cheesecake!  Whether it be brunch, lunch or dinner, even happy hour...The plates are always consistently delicious and portions are always generous."
David C.,"Miami, FL",1339,288,239,3.0,5/7/2011,"Seriously I don't get it... why is the place packed when the Grill on the Alley is not. I think it because the portion sizes are unnecessarily HUGE. I do like the restaurant, but only because it is consistent but certainly not exceptional.  THINGS TO TRY:  ...Any salad is good and can be shared for 2+ people O ...Lettuce wraps are solid and nicely prepared  ...Fried shrimp, it is good, but I don't believe they prepare them in the restaurant, they appear to be from a big old frozen bag  ...They make a good hamburger  ... Asparagus omelet  What i don't like is that they seem to use a lot of prepackaged foods that are defrosted and cooked on premise.  BONUS TIME: If you luck out and get a good bartender, they make a good martini.  BIG TIP 1: Look for seats at the bar first, it is first come first seated and will save you a 45 minute wait.  BIG TIP 2: They make lunch sizes of entrees, so you can save some coin and the portion is basically normal restaurant size.  BIG TIP 3: The best meal they served is breakfast, they make some kick ass omelettes"
