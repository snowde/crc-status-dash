Adriana A.,"Miami, FL",0,6,1,2.0,4/1/2014,I've been in many different locations because my kids love the food and it has so many choices but the location in the Aventura Mall has the worst service of all. If you go enjoy the food but bring lots of patience.
Ivy C.,"Aventura, FL",0,7,,4.0,5/10/2015,Food is great. I just have one complaint about the restaurant- the bathrooms. They are always absolutely gross. I'm specifically referring to the women's bathroom. You would think that a place that brings in as much money as cheesecake does would be able to hire someone to clean the bathrooms throughout the day.
Trakeya M.,"Miami, FL",10,8,,1.0,9/7/2011,"FAIL. MAJOR FAIL. the wait wasn't long so I'm thinking this will be a nice dinner out with the family...I was wrong! Besides feeling like I was walking on ice to get from the front door to the table they were out of the dark bread that is awesome and just had the hard as rocks white bread that sucks! they were out of fish which didn't matter to me because i wanted the meatloaf.. when the waitress came out my plate looked like the bottom of the pot. the gravy was dark the mashed potatoes were dark and lumpy the green-beans were OK. it tasted like the bottom of the pot. i ordered a pina colada and it tasted like coconut milk, no kick at all. then i come home and my stomach is a mess and so is my boyfriends!! what the heck??? anyway this location is FIRED!!!"
Salmyr A.,"Miami, FL",1,8,,5.0,5/7/2015,The team here is simply amazing.  We started off with the manager Monica who accomodated a party of 20 (which she seated us very quickly).  We were then introduced to Deziree who continue to amaze us with her superb service.  We had a big party and she very accomodating!  It was my pleasure to waited by her.  By the way the food was simply amazing!

Randy S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,13,6,3.0,3/6/2014,I'm eating here now. The place can be great again but they are way to busy for good. There are to any people here and the wait staff is simply overwhelmed. The good grade defiantly went down since it's opening but is still ok. Altogether I won't come back anytime soon.
Bryan R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,,1.0,4/27/2015,"Fail on customer service. Waited a really long time for a cashier to take my take out order. She never came so I went to the bar to see if I can place my order there. I waited another 3 to 5 minutes while the bartender had a conversation with other staff members including a manager that was faced towards me. Not even he noticed I was new at the bar and wasn't greeted... Or rather, he too ignored me. It is not the first time this happens. But I suppose they can get away with horrible reviews since they're in a great location with guaranteed traffic."
Maggie S.,"Hollywood, FL",35,11,,1.0,4/22/2015,"Can I give this place ZERO stars?  I would if I could!  We were at the Aventura location today for a late lunch.  We ordered a few things, and our bill came to $80.  The Fried Mac and Cheese were greasy and gross.  Also, the pizza was horribly salty!  When we asked the server about it, she said she would find out.  Time came and went and she didn't respond.  We asked again.  That's when she said she asked the kitchen and he said that they changed their cheese, and that's why it's salty.  Ok... is that our fault???  it was inedible. She didn't even take the bad food off our bill!!!  The cheese cake that we ordered was nauseating too!  Luckily we had some to go because when we got in the car, our 11 year old needed the bag so she could throw up everything she ""ate"".  It was a horrible experience.  Our server was Tari P.  Never again.  Ever."
Maria Y.,"Miami, FL",15,1,34,5.0,7/27/2012,"If you go with an amazing person your dinner cannot go wrong... But the service that was given by our server Jessica was out of this world! Even though she approach the table only a couple of times because she was really busy she made sure we were taken care of!! And even after, since we left and decided at the last minute to buy cheesecake (of course) even though they were already closed she did not hesitate and took our order! Will definitely return and ask for her service"
Aaron K.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",2,11,4,3.0,1/19/2014,I've been here many times. Its consistently good. But it looses a star because the mens rooms is disgusting. The floor around the urinals are always wet. Yeh whats that make you think?
Barbara B.,"Woodloch, TX",5,22,,1.0,4/9/2015,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory restaurant that l have ever visited.  I went there today for a late lunch and really regretted it as soon as we were seated.  It was very noisy, the food l ordered took a very long time and the pizza was dry and burnt around the edges.  The ladies restroom was nasty.  The toilets in several stalls were overflowing and it seems like it had not been cleaned in weeks.  Not at all impressed with this restaurant.  Management needs to take steps to improve the overall operation at this location."
Wendy B.,"Opa-locka, FL",216,50,25,2.0,9/29/2011,"To be fair, pretty much any dish I've had here has been good.  So why only 2 stars?  Well, for one, there are soooo many things on the menu that it takes me forever to even figure out what I want to eat.  I think if they designed their menu to be a little more user friendly it might make life easier.   My main complaint however is that they take FOREVER to seat you, take your order, bring your food, bring your bill, etc.  At first I thought that it was because they were so busy, but I've been there during times when they weren't so busy and they STILL take forever (and this is regardless of which location I've been at).  So, while their food tastes good, it just isn't worth the wait.  Best thing to do is just order a cheescake for pick up and take it with you....but even that could take a while."
Natalie P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",290,206,28,3.0,1/6/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you know what you're getting. Stopped in for a quick late night dinner with a girlfriend after seeing a movie. We were seated within 5 minutes, but as usual, the restaurant was super noisy and the air conditioning was turned down waaaaay too cold! Service was decent, nothing great or above average, but it was satisfactory. Our server was friendly but not outgoing, and did the minimum but didn't try to make a connection. My friend had a chicken salad and I had the avocado egg rolls. Her salad was full of goodies and she said it was good. My egg rolls were tasty (as usual) but they were a little soggy, I suspect they were sitting under the heating lamp for awhile. A big peeve of mine is that at this location they never give me enough dipping sauce! I know it's something small but come on, fill up the teeny tiny little saucer that it comes in! For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake which is ridiculous and to die for. I love (love love love love) red velvet, and combined with cheesecake you just can't go wrong! Overall, service is acceptable, but don't expect to be wooed. Food is good, just exactly what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory. I'd recommend showing up early (before 7) if you have a party over 2 as the waits get crazy at this location."
Rick G.,"Hollywood, FL",69,179,101,5.0,6/1/2013,Always a great meal here if you don't mind the wait. I have Elana's Favorite Pasta whenever I go here.
Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",998,396,11390,3.0,1/23/2013,"Cheesecake, cheesecake, cheesecake!  If you want great cheesecake in unfamiliar territory, this is the place to seek out, this location is no exception - everything else on the menu, you could probably find elsewhere, probably cheaper and better... I really, really hate the lines though!"
Hylton A.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/6/2016,Went to the restutant to have a family night and was seated inside after waiting for 30 minutes for table 27. Waiter ignored our table and went on taking someone else's order who was seated after we were. When he arrived to the table with no introduction only to ask what would we like to order. I addresed him staying that the table was wet and if there was something to clean it with. He said yes. Did not even apologised. Went to another table to check on his guest across from us and we waited almost a good 10 minutes before he came back only to find out the utensils were all dirty as well. Poorley washed and one knife seemed as if someone just cut into a slice of cake. So i started to help him clear the plates and utensils. He still didn't apologise so we left. Speaking with a manager we tried to have us stay. How can you eat in a restaurant that has filthy utensils and is not clean.  Manager should ask herself would she sit and eat after that? I would not even recommend my dog to eating there. Try another location. Maybe.... Just maybe it's better.
Juan K.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",123,87,5,4.0,8/15/2013,Come here all the time to eat desserts with mom and gf. Its a good thing they open until 11pm on weekdays after Aventura Mall has closed..There cheesecakes are always on point! Especially the Godiva Brownie Chocolate one! Very sweet but its too good! The bread they give its very delicious as well! We tried the Red Velvet Cake and it was also good. Best place to come and have your sweet tooth cravings satisfied.
Debbie M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/9/2015,Service was horrible.NEVER Got my meal on my anniversary and every meal that my family got was wrong. The manager wasn't even helpful. I recommend you save your money and Time and go somewhere else.
Veronica J.,"Marietta, GA",903,461,742,4.0,5/25/2011,"Great happy hour!!!  $5 long island ice teas, cosmos and mojitos and lots of great appetizers. Try their buffalo chicken snacks, they are amazing!!! They really have a great happy hour! From 4-6 pm only at the bar Monday- Friday! Parking is absurd there, worth the $5 to valet."
Shenika T.,"Hollywood, FL",114,325,71,3.0,12/9/2010,"This is my 2nd time here and I had the same experience. From the moment I walked in it was extremely loud with the employees walking around yelling for customers to let them know their table was ready. There's got to be a better system.  The wait to be seated wasn't long. My friend and I only went for drinks and appetizer. I tried their passion fruit mojito and although it was very delicious, I didn't taste the passion fruit component. I did not enjoy their fried crab wontons, it taste very fishy.  My friend enjoyed her drink and food, however she was missing a knife and our waitress never brought her one. So she had to use a fork to cut her food."
