JoAnna L.,"Miami, FL",65,193,183,4.0,11/18/2012,"The service is usually pretty good and fast even when they're packed. Huge menu, which kind of throws off my ADD...avocado egg rolls are delicious, as are their pastas, factory burrito (which is huge), thai lettuce wraps...YUM"
Matteo M.,"LaSalle, Canada",1,54,39,5.0,6/29/2013,Always a good meal when I come to this location. We sat outside. The only problem was where we were sitting. They placed us right next to the door where the waiters come out So there was a lot of traffic. Also you would feel the AC every time the door would open. I love AC but when u keep getting a draft it kinda suck. I will return to this location as I have never had a bad time or meal here. The food is alway good
Tasha H.,"Miami, FL",5,19,,4.0,10/18/2010,"First time dining at this chain.  I never could understand the hype.  KWIM?  Anywho, my family and I were prepared for the crush of people.  Pleasantly surprised that the wait time was only 20min on a busy Saturday afternoon!  Our waitress was top-notch.  Polite, friendly, helpful and fast.  Food was served promptly.  Good cafeteria type food.  No fine dining, but definitely not bland.   We were thrilled that the kids meals were meals and not toddler sized portions.  We've paid $6+  at many restaurants for a spoonful of the $1 box of Kraft mac n' cheese or a giant cracker masquerading as a pizza.   There was a big slick spot (improperly cleaned grease spill?) on the floor that was dangerous.  Also, the hot water in the ladies bathroom was scalding hot.  I filled out an online comment card and the manager called me THAT VERY SAME NIGHT!  I was so impressed!  We definitely will return to this location."
Aj G.,"Asbury Park, NJ",126,163,18,1.0,7/10/2013,i had a negative experience there and the manager at the time was horrible. i believe his name is Patrick. There are plenty of other restaurants with better customer service. The food is ok but there is better in Miami.
Chloé E.,"Miami, FL",105,244,209,5.0,10/9/2012,I love this place. It has tons of options and the bar is a nice place to sit if you don't want to wait 45 min for a table. David the bartender was himself and very helpful.
Iti K.,"Aventura, FL",0,1,,4.0,9/29/2013,Avocado Eggrolls is always a favorite  Ok pasta  The miso salmon was great its my fav Nice music  I really like this place  I can go there every day Excellent service
Patty G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",154,575,352,3.0,9/15/2010,"What can I say? If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to all of them. The food is consistent, some dishes are good, others are just OK, and some might even be [should I say it?] bad.  However, my favorite appetizer ever of theirs is the FRIED MAC-N-CHEESE balls. Really, this is a MUST try/have... they're delicious.  My favorite drink from here is the Peach Bellini.  The main dishes are pretty good overall, my favorites are the pastas.  The last time I was here, the service was pretty good."
Christy P.,"Miami, FL",201,296,86,4.0,6/25/2010,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory but lately I've been staying away from it, as I try the less-""chainy"" options in my neighborhood.  Early Sunday dinner before the movies - and this place hit the spot. I am now in LOVE with the fried mac and cheese balls.  I'm a mac-n-cheese whore, but fry them up in the shape of balls (yes, balls, hehe), and you've won me over.  I could've eaten them all as my ENTREE... and maybe next time I will. Shared the burrito with a friend because it was massive... but nothing to write home about there... I'll stick with mac-n-cheese balls next time.   Oh, and don't forget the peach bellinis.  It's like baby food heaven in a glass, with a kick.  Wow."
Natalia G.,"Sacramento, CA",153,125,1,2.0,1/4/2010,"I, too, had a problem with the kitchen at this Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered the chicken sliders and found a rubbery calamari ring in what was supposed to be my fried chicken patty.  It practically popped out of the breading and instantly disgusted me.   The manager came over and explained that they only use ONE fryer for all their fried foods - I mean, really?  Cuz that menu is gigantic and probably 25% of it is fried.  She then tried to convince me that I should ""take this into consideration whenever I order something fried"".  Sooo basically, if I ask for fried chicken, I shouldn't be surprised if I find anything other than chicken?  It shouldn't matter how many fryers you're working with back there - the fried ""calimachicken"" left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. Luckily for the Factory, i have a weakness for cheesecake, so I bumped this review up to two stars.... good thing it doesn't come fried."
Johnny R.,"Miami, FL",153,40,48,5.0,4/16/2013,"My Favorite restaurant! Cheesecake Factory has the best food in town, if you had never tried cheesecake, you are missing out in a great experience. Everybody in my family likes it, and we usually celebrate birthdays there. This is the place where I meet my wife for the first time. Even though The service could be a little bit better, food and drinks make up for it. It is worth every penny. You gotta try the pasta Da Vinci, its their best entree."
Dasha E.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,10,,1.0,7/29/2011,"I have visited this place many times and all those times everything was decent. Until last night. I pulled the longest hair out of my mouth after eating that evelyn's favorite pasta dish. I knew there were a lot of ingredients in this dish but...hair? Disgusting. But we dealt with that and Im not the type to get turned off by possible mistakes. HOWEVER, as we order dessert, we get our tea and our server brings the sugar packet holder. Then this other server (female employee that isn't our server) grabs the sugar packet holder and walks away. She didn't ask if we were done, she didn't make any eye contact, she just took it as she was walking. I watched her in disbelief. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she was going to refill it. But no, she walked to a table of hers and put it down for her customers.  When she passed by our table, I stopped her and told her she should ask if we are done with it before snatching it off. And this girl lies right in my face. Saying I don't know what you are talking about, she said she would be right back. You think she was back? Not at all. She used another route, avoiding my table. That fueled the anger and complaining to the manager did nothing. All he did was ask if we were done and said sorry. So basically they shooed us away. Are you serious? Horrible customer service has to have its repercussions. They seem to be ok with keeping liars and disgusting servers in their employment. I think I am done with this restaurant."
D P.,"Miami, FL",0,26,,3.0,10/19/2014,"Nice menu. Good options for vegetarians.  Service is spotty.  The last two times I went the server did not come back for long periods of time & we had to wait for drink refills, but he was right in our face to sell us a dessert! There is usually a wait to get in."
Nicole S.,"Miami, FL",54,33,1,3.0,6/27/2012,"I have to be honest, I'm having mixed feelings about this place. I have been here a total of 8 times in the last six months alone (yeah, I know - this girl loves her cheesecake!!) While I have not had any issues with meal portions or wait time (its usually less than 20 mins for me) The customer service here stinks!! For some apparent reason I always get the waitress or waiter who seems like they don't want to be there, if you ask for a refill on your drink - they will seem annoyed and wont return for another 15 mins. On out last visit I watched our waitress have a full conversation on her cell phone (we were seated near the kitchen entrance & we were waiting for our food for almost 30 mins) low and behold when she was off of her phone our food was ready! With saying that I will probably return to purchase dessert but not for the sit down service."
Donna M.,"Miami, FL",0,21,,1.0,10/10/2015,"I've been going to this location since it opened and it has only gotten worse with time.  We arrived at 10pm after a movie upstairs and it wasn't that busy.  We decided to wait for a bar table.  We sat there for 40 minutes watching the waitress flirt with a customer and ignore us - she even had the nerve to serve people at a table next to us who came in 15 minutes after us.  They had been served their drinks and were having their orders taken by her and she just totally ignored our attempts to get her attention. At some point I got up and went to the front to get menus so we could at least decide on what we wanted. We were very hungry. I went to speak to the manager and he did nothing - he had zero management skills.  Finally we started asking every staff person who walked by if anyone was going to serve us after 40 minutes.  Finally a waiter appeared and took our drink orders which took forever. He came back with the drinks and bread, but no plates or utensils.  We asked for the utensils and he said he would bring them right away.  He didn't, 10 more minutes passed and I had to get up and get plates and utensils from another table.  Finally he showed up 5 more minutes later, with the plates and utensils, apologizing. Then we ordered food.  My order was wrong, I asked for the chicken salad on brioche and I got a omelet and bacon sandwich.  Not sure how that mistake could be made by a waiter!  My dinner companion had finished eating by the time my correct order arrived.  All I can say is NEVER order the chicken salad on brioche sandwich.  It was the most wretched food item I have ever eaten.  A couple of spoonfuls of dry, tasteless chicken salad on dry, state toasted bread with a slice of tomato and piece of lettuce!!!!!  For $15?????  HORRIBLE!  I found myself wishing I had kept the omelet sandwich.  There weren't even that many people in the restaurant at the time, and there were a LOT of staff.  Terrible management, clearly they don't know what they are doing.  What a shame.  I doubt I will ever go back to this location."
Mark T.,"Miami, FL",0,20,,5.0,9/6/2014,"I've gone to this location many times and the service, venue, quality, and prices are consistently good for this level restaurant.  The service is not consistant but the other catagories make-up for the ""trainees.""  Another interesting feature that puts the Cheesecake Factory into the ""outstanding"" catagory with five stars is the wide selection with an overwhelmingly large menu.  Typically I stear away from restaurants with oversized menus...but with the incredible number of dishes served and typical lines to get seated...I have no justifyable cause to worry about the oversized menu.   The many times that I have frequented this restaurant I have yet to try but a small percentage of things offered.   And everything that I order is above average or great.  There is a great bar, inside & outside seating, family friendly, and conveniently located within the Aventura Mall for a fun filled outing.   And ofcourse the well deserved top rating on the cheesecake selections & portion sizes.   You can pay $11.00 for a piece of cheesecake at Morton's Steakhouse that would be about half the size for considerably less money than Cheesecake Factory....did I mention dozens of fun filled flavors to choose from...not just one...    Go without hesitation for great food & good value.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for everyone."
KC C.,"Hollywood, FL",12,98,94,4.0,6/13/2012,"For a chain restaurant, they do a great job of providing a vast menu with ever-changing options.  The desserts are rich, bold and full of flavor.  The normal food portions are actually too much for the average person, so don't be a fatty and stick with lunch portions. it is worth the wait here and the service is good.  Don't sit outside during the mid-afternoon hours in the summer; too hot, smokers hang out in the adjacent courtyard and the insect patrol is annoying."
Esteban Z.,"Miami, FL",1,64,,3.0,8/1/2010,Food is always good but the place is ridiculously crowded all the time. Service is hit or miss.
Enrique C.,"Miami, FL",6,138,383,1.0,7/11/2012,This restaurant is beautiful but the servers do not follow proper hygiene.  The servers and bartenders clean the booths and tables and then touch the fruit that goes into the drinks.  My wife and I looked at the bartenders while they were touching everything with their bare hands and then touch the fruit.  That is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!
Sabrina Anna C.,"Miami, FL",1442,662,970,4.0,6/3/2009,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, You have graced Aventura with your presence for almost a decade now and you have NEVER ever failed me.  Yes there is usually a wait at this location and yes, it can sometimes be really long, BUT, you are located within a rather large shopping mall with lots of hungry people.  A wait is to be expected. The service at this location is always on point and never lacking.  I can honestly say I've never had bad service here, a decade running. I was here on Sunday, after I attended a family baby shower, to have lunch with my love who had been playing Racket Ball nearby with friends.  There was a minor wait, and before we could even think about walking out and going somewhere else, the host was calling our name to be seated.  I always enjoy sitting outdoors here and was glad that our table was there. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable on all the menu items.  Since I had just eaten at Bimini Boatyard I was interested in one thing and one thing only...  CHEESECAKE!  Although, I did have some of the BF's stuffed mushrooms (TO DIE FOR!!!) and the calamari, which was ok, but nothing special.  I enjoyed a Pomegranate Mojito which was very tasty and followed it with a White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecake.   Our friends ordered the Orange Chicken and some kind of a taco/burrito/gordita looking chicken sandwich, whose name escapes me.  Both of the plates looked phenomenal and tasty.  Usually, I like to order either the Chicken Marsala or the Madeira, or their pastas which are ALL just ridiculously, lick-the-plate-clean GOOD! Thank you for being so reliable and delicious.  For years I have eaten here and I always know that if I am at the mall, I can count on you to stave off the hunger pangs in the most delightful way possible. Cheers!!! Sabrina*"
Nir R.,"Miami Beach, FL",4,62,1,5.0,3/25/2012,For a chain its actually pretty good They brought the baby little pieces of bread and banana right away which I thought was so nice and helpful as it occupied her for most of the time while we waited for our food. The burger I ordered actually came out med-rare like I ordered it. Which is surprisingly difficult for most restaurants. My wife ordered the tuna tartare and the lettuce wraps - she liked them both. Dinner for two without tip was under $30 and it was good so I can brave the wait and chaos at the front entrance.
