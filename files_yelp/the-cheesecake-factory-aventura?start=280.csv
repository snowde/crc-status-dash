Zoey J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,2,,4.0,5/19/2014,Came here for dinner and it was packed! The wait was a bit annoying but definitely worth it! The food was amazing and you can't leave without trying one of the cheesecakes. The chocolate ones are my favorite.
Larry C.,"Miami, FL",74,153,81,4.0,3/12/2012,"I've been going to CheeseCake Factory for years, even way before is was a cool place to hang out, basically when it was just starting to bloom. Well known for their incredible variety of cheese cakes, but I say this is the restaurant with the most items on a menu I've ever seen. The choices are endless, their food is pretty consistent. Love their bread always fresh and hot of the oven, and my favorite dish on the menu it has to be the ""Chicken Madeira"" can't get enough of it. As an appetizer I'm always ordering the Southwestern Rolls spicy and yummy. To Drink I always like to order the addicting Strawberry Lemonade and for alcohol choice either a Corona or they make a killer MudSlide yum yum. Great place to bring friends and have a good time."
R S.,"Saugerties, NY",2,4,12,4.0,12/23/2010,Huge menu. Great for kids. Service was pretty fast. Our waitress was super helpful and friendly.
edel n.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",136,187,8,2.0,6/1/2011,"I have to say I've been really disappointed in the Cheesecake factory on the few ocassions I've eaten there but none more than my last experience at the Aventura Mall.  When a menu states that poached eggs are available, you order them then the server serves fried eggs and passing them off as poached!!! That is not impressive.  When I pointed out the eggs were fried not poached i was told poached eggs are only available on Sundays!! Shoud have let me chose an alternative.  For that reason they only get 2 stars."
Stephanie G.,"Miami, FL",589,363,121,3.0,12/22/2009,"Eating at the Cheesecake Factory is probably similar to eating on an assembly line. But, I have to give it to these people as they serve SOOO many people in  a very quick and efficient manner. The food isn't half bad either. Sure, it's not gourmet but the dishes I've tried off of their menu have always been tasty. I don't normally eat at chains, but when you're stuck at Aventura Mall Christmas Shopping, your options are limited. Both my friend and I had salads which are conveniently served in ""lunch"" and ""entree"" sizes which makes sense when you lack the time & space in your stomach to eat a barrel full of lettuce. In any event, I'd say that this place doesn't disappointed as it does what it's supposed to do...get you in, fed and out with enough time to get over to Macy's and finish off your list."
Anna V.,"Aventura, FL",17,30,23,4.0,10/13/2011,The food is always awesome.  I gave four stars b/c it takes forever to wait to be seated and the atmosphere is always loud.
ciara c.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,3.0,6/13/2012,"When ever I am in Miami, which is like 2 times a year visiting friends, my stops always include the beach, hard rock hotel & casino for opium, and the cheesecake factory. I had been going to this same cheesecake factory since I was a college student in undergrad. The foods always good, portions are insane and the cheesecake...well...yeah...let's just say I spend 5 mins staring at the cheesecake counter deciding on which one to choose.  But this most recent visit (yesterday for lunch) it seamed to lose its fairy dust. Aside from the annoying tourist blocking the enterence with their purchases from the mall, and waiting 10 mins for an outdoor table when we saw 5 tables emply upon entry and everyone infront of us wanting an indoor table. There seemed to be an 'eh' additude from the hostest, and the server. There were flies everywhere and I spend more time shooing then chewing and the cultural diversity was lacking. I don't know, maybe it doesn't do it for me anymore. But the cheesecake's are amazing."
Byron C.,"Miami, FL",5,12,7,3.0,3/11/2009,"Went there last weekend. The service from our waiter was very good. He even brought our 2 yr old some extra bread and banana pieces without us asking for it which was very nice of him. And the bread as always was really god as always. We ordered the Chicken Marsala for the first time ever and it was just OK. It's truly not their specialty I guess. We should have stuck to our normal safe choice, but we veered... anyway... My real gripe and the reason for the 3 stars instead of more is because of the unnecessary long wait and the host staff acting like if they are the high priests of ""Cheescake Factory Gates of Heaven"". No matter how busy it is, I like to be received with a smile and I don't like to wait more than necessary. The girl there did not give my wife a pager when she put our names in because they were so full they ran out, but told her it would be 30 minutes anyway. Apparently the girl forgot we were waiting with no pager, never gave us a pager and it took over 45 minutes for us to get seated. Not acceptable. Management should be prepared to have that amount of crowds and pagers should never be short. Host staff needs attitude adjustment."
Carolina G.,"Miami, FL",0,254,,5.0,5/11/2014,"My all time favorite restaurant. The brown bread they give here is amazing! I recommend the chicken carbonara pasta, the salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, the orange chicken, the lettuce wraps, etc. everything is amazing. The portions are huge, you get what you pay here. I also deff recommend the s'mores cheesecake for dessert or the Godiva cheesecake with coffee. Staff is super friendly and faced paced. Weekends be prepared to wait an hour!"
Steven T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",376,37,13,5.0,12/3/2011,Woke up and decided to get an omelette for breakfast. The omelette was great and we sat out in the patio which was wonderful with Miami weather :)
Neha C.,"Hollywood, FL",4,14,4,5.0,3/19/2012,"Food is consistently good... But there's always long wait... Great service.... I love their warm brown bread. My favorite dish on the menu is their louisiana chicken pasta, it is so deliciously good. I have tried their tomato basil pizza, chicken nachos, blackened chicken sandwich and everything is really good."
Richard E.,"Hollywood, FL",39,28,3,3.0,10/30/2011,"Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory today.  Went to the one in Aventura and while the service was good, the food was overcooked and the mens room was a mess.  Ordered a Kobe burger med-rare and it came out well done.  Lemon Ricotta pancakes were too hot to eat.  Usually get much better food from this chain.  Maybe it was just an off day?"
Gregg S.,"Olathe, KS",13,16,,3.0,12/5/2011,Food was good.  Service so/so.  Too many different servers came to the table.  You would tell one to bring you a refill and then you either got 3 glasses at once or no one would show up.
Jenny Q. V.,"Hollywood, FL",30,168,19,5.0,8/3/2011,Big portions and the wait time can be really bad at times but it's great food!! You need to try the taquitos for appetizer they are really good!
Joe W.,"Justin, TX",132,525,300,4.0,7/15/2011,"Their food isn't nothing to be happy about, but their cheesecake was DYNAMITE!"
S. S.,"Miami, FL",0,13,,5.0,3/8/2014,"Love Love love this place! I come here all the time with my boyfriend and the hostess team is so nice! I usually try to sit in the bar during lunch or dinner rush though my favorites: Steak Ddiane, Evelyn's Favorite, Chicken Madeira, Lemon Chicken Picata, Chicken Katsu, Chicken Costoleta, Caesar salad, 30th Anniversary cheesecake, Snicker's cheesecake, hot fudge sundae, Dulce de leche, Godiva, Hershey's and White Rasberry. Not in that order of course. :)"
Indya R.,"Washington, DC",118,147,69,4.0,4/23/2011,There is always a wait because of the location. Food is always good. The best calamari ever! Their mojitos are to die for! I usually get the chicken Madeira or the rib eye. You will love it
Valerie H.,"Miami, FL",0,12,,4.0,2/14/2010,"I grew up eating here, and honestly ever since I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club with no bacon...I haven't been able to bring myself to order anything else since! It's been consistenly delicious every time! I don't know what they do to that sandwich but its absolutely scrumptious! And their french fries are always really good! I've always wanted to try the appetizers but the entree portions are SO big I can't even finish that...I don't know why they even bother having appetizers! But I definitely agree with Brittney W. with the insane amount of out-of-control children and their parents who don't give a shit. Take them to chuck e cheez or something! youre ruining my meal!"
Duana M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",151,158,37,4.0,2/27/2011,"This reviews is several YEARS overdue. My family lives in Aventura and on weekends, Id go and visit. For lunch/dinner I would stop here because the food is undeniably amazing. This has been my favorite location between Miami and Orlando :-). On three separate occasions I have visited this restaurant and  there would be some sort of issue. What I ordered had suddenly ran out, or something I ordered, just wouldn't be ready for me to eat at a reasonable time. This restaurant is always busy. But the lines and wait is always worth it. So anyhow, whenever there was a problem with my food, I always had the acquaintance of Chris. Hes professional and caring. A great manager. Always offers something to replace whatever I couldn't have on the house, and once I got desert. (Their cheesecake is to die for!) I have never had a sour time eating here, because I know that if I'm unable to get what I want I can at the very least leave with an apology, and I'll be taken care of. Keep up the good work Chris!"
Kesha S.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,20,20,5.0,4/16/2011,I have three words:  Red Velvet Cheesecake!  Enough said!
