Tough C.,"Miami, FL",3,227,6,1.0,2/23/2013,"I had an upsetting experience at this Cheesecake Factory (Aventura Mall). I ordered a  Caesar salad and a small pizza and found a large wooden skewer underneath the pizza. I called waiter to let her know what I had found and she apologized and called the manager. The manager came over and offered to bring me another pizza. I said I was turned off by the whole experience and I turned down her new pizza offer. She just gave me the stink eye and walked away. She did not apologize or anything. Ever since then, I have decided to never go back this OR ANY OTHER Cheesecake Factory."
Brent H.,"Denver, CO",1,5,,1.0,6/26/2010,"Very poor service and food quality.  I have visited this location many time left very disappointed.  Our server  was unfamiliar with the menu, most specifically how the Carmel Chicken was prepared.  We asked if the chicken was grilled and he replied that yes it was, when it came out it was fried in batter.  We also ordered an appetizer of  chicken pot-stickers which never arrived.  Once our food was delivered no checked on us to see how the food was, offer us more beverages.  We asked for the check and waited and waited and waited.  After presenting a credit card it was returned with no check slip to sign.  We tipped 13% but left feeling that was 10% to much for such poor service.  Overall just a very poor service experience"
Idania C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",29,15,,4.0,9/14/2013,"Excellent food, much better than the ccf at PEMBROKE lakes mall.  However the service is not a good."
Yelp H.,"Sanibel, FL",0,8,1,5.0,9/2/2013,"We like to have dinner at the cheesecake factory. The restaurant looks the same everywhere, the qualty of food is rather constant. The CF at Aventura Mall is the right place to finish a shopping day. We enjoy it always. Servers are very friendly. There is nothing to complain."
Brittney W.,"Lake Buena Vista, FL",104,192,116,5.0,5/23/2010,"big shout-out to Amber THE best waitress on earth! i hope she's reading this! (no homo but ...wanna hang out later?) from her warm smile to that awesome tie she was wearing, amber was a treat to have from beginning to end.  my friend is a burger fanatic but always wanted to try the Factory's fish tacos. being skeptical he asked amber for her opinion and with her confidence, he tried the fish tacos with the promise that she'd exchange it for something else if he didn't like it. she totally kept her word and took away the disgusting tacos and brought out a juicy, delicious bacon burger she recommended.  all the while she was serving us, we couldn't help but constantly thank her and remind her of her awesomeness."
Olivia L.,"Miami Lakes, FL",58,129,69,5.0,10/19/2010,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory but this one is particularly great. I went on a date night w my boyfriend and asked if they sold the lemon butter sauce from my favorite dish; the chicken piccata, just as they sell their salad dressings. The waitor asked and although the response was no, one of the chefs went out of his way to come over to our table and explain how to make it since they didn't sell it! I was very impressed. The food was of course amazing as usual!"
Kelly O.,"Miami, FL",32,350,70,4.0,2/16/2010,"Warm dark bread arrives at the table in seconds flat. Is this one of the reasons why I love Cheesecake Factory? Yes, it is. No matter what I order  here it is all good. Salads are generous and freaking amazing. Their blue cheese dressing is made in heaven I assure you. The appetizers are so good: mac and cheese balls (it's fried and mac and cheese, omg!), avocado egg rolls, the huge factory nachos, and lettuce wraps just to name a few. The entrees: chicken romano, chicken littles (a mountain of chicken with mashed potato), chicken picatta, the bbq chicken sandwich are all favorites. And desserts? godiva cheesecake and their enormous carrot cake are treats that I crave just about every day. Service is usually good and the place is worth the wait time."
Debora R.,"Hollywood, FL",57,14,3,1.0,12/13/2009,"I found a bug in my ceasar salad, the waiter call the manager and he only discount one salad, and we were eating 3 we left the place with a note saying """" clean the kitchen"""" my birthday lunch was a horrible, the bug was big."

Roberto N.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,4,,5.0,10/16/2012,"What can I say, I love this place! Huge variety, excellent food, honest prices and the best cheese cake in the world!"
Rob C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1616,4663,178,4.0,3/23/2009,"located in Aventura mall similar decor as Grand Lux, so don't get confused and park near the wrong one at night, because when the mall closes, it's a long walk to your car (or wait for a shuttle) this location is always crowded like any other cheesecake (peak wait times can be more than 45 min) there's something on the menu for everyone, and it's standardized good stuff with large portions which I guess keeps bringing everyone back, this place has done well, standing the test of time and earning their solid reputation personally, i usually get a burger or a sandwich like the grilled eggplant one advantage with the long wait i suppose, is that at least you can walk around the mall"
Melissa V.,"Hollywood, FL",225,206,135,4.0,3/12/2009,"I used to come here a lot with my mother when I was a teen, then it stopped because of the long wait.. Ralph and I picked this spot since we had to get our rings checked at the mall, plus I needed to buy something from M.A.C. make-up store that I ran out of at home. Oh, I am definitely into this restaurant for the cheesecakes, too. But, food is definitely great, too. Ralph called before getting there to make a reservation but it was impossible for some reason. So, I went straight to the Cheesecake Factory to the host to tell her I needed a table (and mentioned that it was to celebrate our 3rd yr anniversary, which was true.) Her face kind of lighted up and said it could be ready around 20 minutes. I was never given the vibrating pager, which I found out. Oh, well. I said that I could be back in 30 minutes instead and checked my watch at the same time and rushed in the mall with Ralph and did what we had to do. I got back inside maybe 5 minutes late. I waved at the same hostess and she said to wait a moment. Then, another 5 minutes passed by, some guy in white uniform called out my name really loud in front of me. lol.. I was right there.  The waitress was a cool girl, who had sense of humor and a great smile. We first went with the spicy chicken salad. We should have ordered the Luau one, but next time. We also shared an appetizer of avocado egg rolls, which was heavens to both of us. I decided to get a Passion Fruit Mojito. It was delicious. I really appreciate the fact that our waitress (sorry, I wish I remembered her name) warned us that we might not like the Pomegranate Mojito. She said that the pomegranate might not blend in well with the mint in the drink and many people didn't like it. That was nice of her to point out. :) Then, we went for the Splenda cheesecake with fresh strawberries and whip cream. I usually get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, however, I wanted to be nicer to myself by not gaining too much of the sugar since I've already been drinking two of the tall glasses of passion fruit mojitos. I was almost knocked out when I got home. Very nice way to mini celebrate out 3 years of being together before marriage. :) I love Ralph!"
Maria L.,"Miami, FL",52,23,,5.0,11/28/2008,"If you don't have to wait, then you are lucky! Love their endive/blue cheese salad, bang bang chicken and shrimp, their pasta dishes, and chicken/beef sliders! I never fail to come home without a jar of their house dressing/vinegrette."
Jules R.,"Westchester County, NY",3,60,,3.0,8/24/2011,"Went here on a Saturday night with family and the wait wasn't exactly my favorite part. We got there around 7:30 and were told our wait time was 45 minutes. Part of the reason why the wait was so long was because we opted for indoor seating since half the outdoor seating was unavailable due to wet seats from the rain. It ended up being closer to an hour but once you get seated and order, it doesn't take long for the negative of the wait to go away. Overcrowded both inside and out. Our waitress was at least nice. The floors are filthy looking and it's obvious that they don't take a broom every few hours and sweep the used napkins, forks and straw wrappers from under the table. I kind of just wanted to get out of here as fast as I could. I ordered the Tomato, Basil and Cheese pizza which was good. I got the red velvet cheesecake to take home and I was a happy camper when I ate it! If you're not picky and don't complain, you might actually enjoy it going here :)"
Angelica B.,"Miami, FL",1,1,,1.0,7/17/2012,"AVENTURA, FLORIDA CHEESECAKE FACTORY should be rated -10000 with managers like Jason running the show. I ordered 4 things. The only thing that was correct was the slice of cheesecake. I ordered mini crab bites which 2, had a bite taken out of them!!!!!!!!!!! A turkey blt no tomato. They gave me a baquette that was very hard, stale and had actual mold on it and there was 2 slices of turkey and and tomato seeds from the left behind tomato. no white toast, mayo, bacon?? The french fries were missing completely. The third item shrimp scampi no tomato extra sauce. Shrimp raw, no sauce on dish and a little sauce on side filled to the brim with tomatoes. Called JASON manager there(cant believe this is who is in charge) laughed and said he would not help, didnt even sound appauled. I asked for a higher up and refused to answer and hung up. This after waiting 35 minutes to speak with him. what a waste of time and 50 dollars. wasted 3 hours, starving and putting in frozen pizza as we speak. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!"
