Natalie L.,"Hialeah, FL",0,11,17,2.0,9/24/2017,"I had the new cheesecake flavor- birthday cake with all the blue,pink and sprinkles. Worst cheesecake I have tried ever at The Cheesecake Factory. The cake, frosting, and cheesecake sections all tasted horrible.THe chocolate and strawberry sections taste the same- looks like its just colored differently. It had an identity crisis. I also tried the avocado rolls- tasted good but very greasy."
Sabrina I.,"Miami, FL",8,2,,1.0,2/21/2017,Very bad customer service . Awful attitude. Manager very unprofessional . Cheese Cake decreased their service soooooo bad from years ago . It's a shame. I used to love to come here. Pembroke Gardens so far the best . Aventura Mall horrible.
Richard P.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,4,,1.0,2/17/2017,"Received the worst customer service I've received in a Cheesecake Factory on my first time trying this location.  My first server took 10 mins to greet me, never looked at our table again after taking our initial order (no water refill, nothing, all food and drink was brought by others). This was especially annoying because he asked the table next to us how they were. Then, when our main course was halfway done (brought out by a food runner) someone else asked if we were ok. I asked who she was and she said she's our server. I asked who the first server was and she said there was a mixup. Interesting. Maybe this is why we were ignored our entire meal? Took the manager aside and told her in detail my negative experience and she said sorry and that she will have to follow up with my server. She then asked if I will be paying in cash or credit. When I handed her my credit card, she charged me my full bill and didn't so much as offer me a cheesecake. I received awful customer service, was ignored, no refills, neither server introduced themselves with their name---but I was still expected to pay in full and without any sort of accommodation for the terrible service."
Melissa L.,"Miami, FL",56,29,,1.0,7/17/2017,"I have given this Cheesecake Factory many many chances, different days, different times, different company. I was hoping it could become a regular staple for me, as it is around the corner from where I live. However, after every Cheesecake Factory experience, I was underwhelmed and under satisfied, hoping for a more pleasant experience. I had been going to Cheesecake Factory since I was a little girl. As of late, the portions have gotten smaller, the quality has gone way down, and the service has become quite non existent. I leave hoping there could be a redeeming factor, luring me back, but I am sure I have reached my last visit. The server was rude and unaccommodating, the wait for the food was long, and the food was so blah. Blah=boring and tasteless."
Lisa A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",186,363,732,4.0,8/5/2016,"Ok, let's be honest....raise your hand if you're using the gift card your mother in law gave you 2 years ago..... ::raises hand:: I like Cheesecake Factory. All of the ones I have been to push out a quality meal with exceptional service. We went on a Sunday around 4pm and waited about 30 minutes for a table. Food came out pretty quick considering that the restaurant was at full capacity. The Cuban rolls are always a must! Try them if you haven't already! My one complaint is that the floors were EXTREMELY slippery! Seriously, it felt like there was butter everywhere. Even in my Nikes, I almost fell twice walking to the table. I really don't know how anyone else did not fall."
Skaidra K.,"Schaumburg, IL",30,51,10,1.0,1/11/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here to have a nice New Years Eve dinner and left so disappointed.... First of all I want to say that back in Chicago we went to Cheesecake Factory often, and always loved the food.  I ordered my usual dish...Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The dish was OK - not the same amount of flavor as always, and the eggplant was missing. On the other hand, the pine nuts made up for the missing flavor in the dish.  My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs...we had asked the waitress if they had spaghetti bolonese and she said that this was the same dish...WRONG...besides being the wrong dish, the noodles were stale and the dish was dry. We returned the dish.  In place, we ordered the peanut chicken...hoping this dish would be better...Sadly, everything was drowning in red salty sauce...like a soup. The waitress brought us a side of rice to make it taste better, but the whole thing was just a disaster. On top of all of this, we had to ask for bread/water after not receiving any. Plus, the other tables our waitress served also kept looking for her to get bread/water. By the way, the customers who were sitting behind us made a joke to the waitress about us being difficult and she rolled her eyes and said ""I KNOOOW"". Not OK.  We told the waitress about all of this and she didn't really seem to care and denied talking about us to the other guests. We wrote her a LONG note on our receipt so she would never serve/treat her future guests this way at Cheesecake.  This was a huge disappointment for us..will not be coming back to this location that is guaranteed.  Best part of the whole meal was the bread... Dissapointing..."
Jingyi W.,"Miami, FL",43,2,8,3.0,8/20/2017,"I ordered a salad and the menu mentioned that it has avocado inside, but when I see it has no avocado, server did not give us any explain."
Ahgg B.,"Cambridge, MA",16,4,2,1.0,7/6/2017,There was a hair on my American Burger. It shows the kitchen is not clear at all. When you give a order you should double check your plate.
Adriana P.,"Stamford, CT",2,16,4,4.0,3/15/2017,"It's not necessary to talk about the food, because all their menu is awesome!! And you have to save some room for a cheesecake!! My favorite is the Redvelvet, but I discovered the Banana...simply delicious!!!! The only problem I find in this location is that is always really crowded and you might freeze if you sit inside!!"
Camila B.,"North Miami Beach, FL",2,2,1,1.0,5/25/2017,"I always come to Cheesecake Factory for their awesome food, but the host is shitty, rude, doesn't know how to treat the costumers, and the manager doesn't notice this errors !"
Lissette C.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",1082,113,4186,5.0,4/21/2016,"What a great experience!! There are so many delicious options on their menu, take your time and get lost in the offering, many wonderful salads!! The bread is crusty and hot, tea is endless and refills prompt.  The stuffed Mushrooms as appetizer was a wonderful choice, I had to admit the Mushrooms was rich, warm, pleasant and tasting ! My second choice, avocado rolls super creamy and soft, I love avocados because is a great carrier of flavors, also are good source of vitamin E and vitamin C, I love this butter fruit!! Main course, the chicken and lemon couscous was light, fresh and very tasty! My favorite dessert chocolate tuxedo cream , I highly recommend! Our server, Matthew, was great, very attentive and helpful. Â I had a fantastic dinner! I love seeing so many families together enjoying of this huge place full of delicious sweets full of flavors!"
Jadhai C.,"Miami, FL",11,81,187,5.0,5/4/2016,"The wait time was less than 5 minutes, and it was a very very busy day. So many people at this mall and inside. So that was great. From the time we received our drinks to the time we ordered I might have blinked like 5 times at the most. It was amazing. Our drinks never got half way before they were already refilled and brought back to the table. So I never had to endure a watered down Coca Cola. Or lemonade.  The waitress made suggestions for my mom, and they ended up tasting deliciously. I ordered a southwest penne pasta and I couldn't be happier. It was different, had asparagus, peas, fried crunchy topping, spicy sauce. OMG it was to die for. All the food was brought at the same time, and our waitress definitely made it memorable. Will come back."
Nina N.,"Silver Spring, MD",22,19,50,3.0,1/26/2017,"I got the lunch special including pizza and Cesar salad. The pizza was nice and cheesy however, the salad looked old and was pretty bland. The lunch special serves till 5:00pm"
Slick P.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2017,"This isn't about the food at all, it's about the horrible state of their bathrooms. I have seen some bad bathrooms, but this literally takes the cake. Pungent urine smell, filthy and overall nasty. Do setting please."
Rolanda B.,"Miami Gardens, FL",220,48,79,5.0,12/30/2016,I always go to cheesecake and forget to write my review I guess that's because I'm always wrapped up in their huge menu. I give it 5 stars because they go above and beyond with food. The wait time is almost always the killer I hate going without making reservations or walking the mall until it's time to be seated. I'm thinking they should do call a heads but the food is so good you generally forget how long you've waited... TWO WORDS SHRIMP SCAMPI
Samar R.,"Miami Lakes, FL",108,113,316,5.0,5/16/2016,Just uhmazinggggg. The tex mex eggrolls (with lotsss of lime) are the bomb diggity. We tried the white chicken chili.... wow that was great too. It looked smaller than most entrees but was still full afterwards.
Ashley P.,"New Orleans, LA",44,33,,5.0,7/4/2017,Wait time was exactly what they projected. Server was prompt and kept drinks refilled. Refills are key after a long day in the Miami sun! Food was wonderful.
Ali R.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,3.0,4/9/2017,I love cheese factory but this one is always always every crowded. This is review isn't based off the food cause the food is great. Just the service is slow you have to wait doesn't matter what day of the week it is to get a table. This location is always loud too and I understand it's in a mall but it's overdone.
Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867,3.0,4/30/2015,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory numerous times through out the years and it hasn't really changed. Â In relation to where this restaurant is located it is a part of Aventura Mall at the southern east mall entrance between Sears and Bloomingdale's. Â  There is an entrance also from inside the mall beside Trattoria Rosalia's not far from the Apple Store and the 8 star pointed fountain. While the service at the Cheesecake Factory always seems to be good there are some things here that could use improvement. Â The outdoor seating for example, when it rains there are a lot of seats available but some seem to get slightly wet. Â If they could do a better job covering those tables perhaps they would be able to be used all the time. Â There are fans above the covered area so I'm guessing they don't want those to get wet considering they use electricity. Â Somehow, perhaps protect those tables from getting wet so they aren't left idle and more people can use them. Another issue is the inside waiting space. Â It's very small, the bar is also very small compared to other Cheesecake factories I've been to. Â Lots of people are willing to wait for tables to eat at this place. Â There really needs to be some more accommodation for them somehow so they aren't all cramped in that dim area. The bar being small is sort of closed off from the waiting area and other areas have glass partitions. Â This particular restaurant just seems more closed off than others we've been to. Â I get that you want privacy but this Cheesecake Factory just seems cramped. Â I don't necessarily get the same feeling from say the one at Cocowalk. The food is the same here as it is at the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to which means it's good food, big portions and large everything except for space on the table. One piece of advice, don't eat the bread. Â  You're going to most likely get full off just your main dish so apps are also a trap. Â Don't eat bread or apps if you want cheesecake for dessert but don't forget you can always take your food home with you too. One more thing, this place can get pretty stuffy inside at times. Â It's almost like the AC can't keep up with all the people generating heat in this place. Â I changed my table from first available to inside just because it was way too humid outside to enjoy dinner."
James C.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",0,3,,3.0,4/4/2017,Maybe I built myself up for it too much. After having been looking forward to trying out The Cheesecake Factory for a while I left unimpressed. The Aventura location is extremely busy. They seem to call multiple parties to their table at the same time which is a bit impersonal. You follow the host and other groups to their table or vice versa then on to another table like a restaurant version of the conga. Food was either overcooked or dry. I think we got them on a bad night.
