Valeriya L.,"Miami, FL",37,2,,1.0,9/29/2017,"I go to Cheesecake factory every time I'm at the mall! That's how much I like it, but this time I Had a terrible experience! My visit was on July 23d, 2017. I invited my friend that was visiting from another country to have lunch with me at this location. After being sat by the hostess we waited around 15min and nobody approached us. So I stopped the server that was talking to the table next to us and sure saw that I was looking around and just ignored the fact we are not being helped and told her that we've been waiting for a while. She didn't even smile or tried to be polite and just said it's not her section and she will tell our server. I work in restaurant bussiness and at my restaurant servers are tought what means team work! After waiting a few more minutes our waitress showed up chewing a gum and looking absolutely unprofessional! She approached me with an attitude and just asked ""Can I help you? "". Excuse me??? Am I at the doctors office??? I just kept looking at her because I was so shocked that didn't know how to react. No apologies that we were waiting, no smile, no greating, Nothing! I literally read in her eyes how she doesn't want to deal with us since we already complained about waiting and that we're probably one of those tables that don't tip. Wrong! I always tip good 20% and all you had to do is just apologize and then do your job. I immediately asked for a manager and explained the situation and asked to be served by another waiter. Manager looked too busy to really show he cared. We had lunch and the girl brought the check, and still no apologies, no manager coming back and making sure if everything was fine at the end. I still regret that I was too nice and didn't ask for a manager to come back to make a big deal out of it. I should have asked what was that server's name so I could mention it here. In my restaurant I always compliment guests with a discount or a free desert if they didn't like something and I can't believe I had such a bad experience at this popular chain restaurant!"
Mark S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",239,352,504,3.0,3/22/2015,"3.5:  you know how, when you order a pizza with more than 2 people, nobody can agree on the toppings? That's where a place like CF comes in: there's something for everyone, because the menu is huge (as are the portions).  It's funny that a place with a name focusing on dessert (cheesecake), serves food in such large sizes that you are nearly certain NOT to have room for dessert. Even if you share, it seems any cheesecake you order will be ""to go"".  Food snobs would not even stoop to review a chain restaurant, but I live in Aventura (basically), and I feel a civic duty to tourists to paint a full picture of my home turf. And CF is really not that bad. There is variety, value (items are not cheap, but big - lending easily to sharing or a second leftover meal), it's good for families, it's in a mall (you'll be there anyway, so if you want something a step up from food court...), and it's worth a try if you are a tourist from a place that doesn't have an outpost (I'm thinking here of my fellow Canadians).  I say 3.5 because I think it has more appeal than next door ""Grill on the Alley"" for the reasons in the previous paragraph. I also think it is a slight step up from sister restaurant ""Grand Luxe Cafe"" (same ownership, also with an outpost at Aventura Mall), which has a less interesting menu."
Farrynn L.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,3.0,12/6/2016,Table was dirty. We had to ask several times before someone came to clean it. Salad was served with stale/burnt garlic bread. Ordered a filet Mignon- medium rare- what I got was cooked medium. Won't be back
Alyssa W.,"Miami, FL",684,11,13,1.0,7/27/2017,"[Sub par service, way too much waiting] Went today for a quick lunch with my grandfather during my lunch break. When we got there, he noticed more than a handful of empty, clean tables outside so he sat down and I went inside to let them know. There was only one family in front of us, who were already being seated. Even though we already had a table, we still had to wait an extra 5 minutes before someone could walk us to the same table. I told them I was pressed for time and they said it was not a problem. When the waitress came, she took care of another table and didn't acknowledge us until we asked a bus boy to get her. About 10 minutes later, she finally took out order. It took about 15 additional minutes for us to even get bread or our drinks. After another 20 minutes of waiting (and no sign of our waitress) we asked another waiter to ask her to bring our food in to go boxes with the check. When it arrived another 5 mins later, it wasn't packed up so we had to package it ourselves and wait longer for to go bags. Overall the service was not great, the waiters and waitresses are hard to get ahold of and they weren't very polite considering it wasn't slam packed. She didn't even say thank you when she came to pick up the money. Needless to say, I will never go back there for my lunch break. On the bright side, the food tasted good while I ate it in the car on my drive back to work.. ‍"
Christine K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",2,18,113,4.0,6/4/2017,This place is always busy and long lines but so worth to wait. The food is delicious. No wonder it's one of my favorite places to eat. I will definitely come back when I'm in Miami!
Rafaell D.,"Miami, FL",8,7,,5.0,7/1/2017,"I'm here cause of the cake not no food, but I've tried some delicious cuisine, but the cheesecake. Once you bite into it your mouth and mind goes to their own different place but where ever they go, I just hope the cheese cake their will taste great forever, cause they did for me! But I've waited for 15min for the cake but if you got patients and you want the best cheesecake go to Cheesecake Factory"
R R.,"Miami, FL",0,9,15,4.0,5/11/2017,I went for lunch and had the fried calamari and fish tacos. Everything was ok. The fish needed salt but the fried calamari was PERFECT!! The best thing I had was the red velvet cheesecake!! Service was good also.
Johnny A.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,7,,2.0,7/30/2017,"I've written about Cheesecake Factory before and recently I've found nothing to give any praise.  We tried the Cheesecake Factory in Aventura Mall and it was Okay, but it was over crowded and the noise level was off the charts.  It made dinning similar to eating at a rock concert with just you and your partner eating at a table while everyone else around you was yelling and screaming.  I find that more and more the case as we eat out as it seems Americans in general have lost their sense of decency and eating out anymore is nothing short of herding cattle to a trough and throwing in the slop.  The next popular restaurant will have you sitting on a toilet so you can just go while you eat and a large bowl on the table with all your food slopped in together.  Bon Appetite!"
Alexander F.,"Miami, FL",22,90,155,3.0,9/10/2016,"Meh....I write ""meh"", but I eat here often. CF has its own special character, kinda fast food-sassy-salon eating. Yeah, my ""meh"" is for mehvolous!!!!"
Kristina A.,"Miami, FL",103,41,128,5.0,8/12/2016,"A frequent flyer here every time I visit aventura. The place is always bustling and packed. Surprisingly only had to wait 5-10min for a party of two around 5 on a Thursday.  They were out of the wonderful wheat bread which is surprisingly a first. Our waitress was very sweet but being here I kept getting the feeling that we're being rushed out of here So they can turn over tables. I ordered the ginger smash - a whiskey cocktail with ginger, simple syrup and Sprite, it was bright and refreshing.  The avocado egg rolls are the best, so simple but bright and the sweet sauce of mango and cilantro accompanying it makes the avocado, red onion wrapped in wonton. In addition split the pasta carbonara with the sigfig, it came out promptly after the egg rolls. It had more lemon than I'd prefer but it was still good. We got a healthy dose of parmesan atop the pasta and feasted.   This is certainly the place you go when you want consistently good food and can't decide what to get. The menu is huge along with the portions. Highly recommend splitting an entree so you can save room for the amazing cheesecakes for dessert. My favorites are the lemon raspberry, then the coconut, and Carrot cake cheesecake. Again, portions are massive so definitely recommend splitting them."
Carlton J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",14,2,,1.0,11/29/2016,"OMG!!  Went to The Cheesecake Factory Aventura Mall for dinner tonight. Decided to quickly use the restroom after placing my order.  I walked in, took one look and immediately turned around and left the restaurant. One thought.....If the restroom was allowed to go sooooooo unattended, what say the kitchen??!! I have been in some really bad public restrooms but this one took the cheesecake."
Marina A.,"Hollywood, FL",259,164,3425,4.0,12/16/2015,Soy glazed edamame with little pieces of caramelized ginger is a must try ! This place is always consistent and always good for lunch.
Johnny C.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",3,38,10,3.0,12/13/2015,"Had the vegetable salad and Kobe burger. Both very enjoyable.  Service was great, even though it was after 10pm.  Tried the Oreo cheesecake ... Great pallet cleanser to end the meal.  The waiter took 25 minutes to bring change to my bill."
Leo S.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,32,8,4.0,9/17/2017,Today in a long time I didn't enjoy my chicken ceasar salad. There wasn't too much chicken in it and there was a lot of dressing. Don't order it.
Justin R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",0,2,,4.0,8/14/2017,"Terrible Host, she was rude and didn't seem to not want to be at work at all. She had a lot of makeup on and puffy curly hair. Almost made me want to not eat here. Awesome server! He was patient and answered any questions our party of 4 needed. Food was great!"
Hadar C.,"New York, NY",2,26,,4.0,7/10/2016,"Wow - we loved this experience. Full menu, excellent service, waitstaff attentive, and delicious tastes here. Vegan Cobb salad a standout  at $10.95. Healthy, clean, delicious and XL portion for  ingredients.  Over 2lbs easy which would have been $25 at Wholefoods for sure.  We will be regulars! Thank you for wowing us."
Michelle A.,"Hollywood, FL",0,15,1,2.0,7/8/2017,Understaffed for a Saturday afternoon.  Inconsistency with their food from one visit to another.
Moran H.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/18/2016,"I have visited many other Cheesecake Factory branches and never had a terrible experience as I've had at this branch.  I went with my 18 month old daughter and they got me a very small and crowded table, I was very uncomfortable at this table sitting with a toddler and a high chair, so I requested to move to a different table. I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the other table, and when I finally sat down, the table and the floor was so dirty with leftover tuna and vegetables, that was totally disgusting. I had to wait another 10 minutes to address the issue until I saw a waitress, the waitress just told me ""I'll be right with you"" and disappeared for another 10 minutes.. okay, she came back and said I'll be right with you again and left!! 5 minutes later she came back and said they will clean shortly.  I ordered the sliders with NOTHING on it but grilled onion, I also mentioned I request a lot of grilled onions. My order came with all the the veggies and ketchup, everything was there but the grilled onions I requested!  NEVER AGAIN!!"
Damian S.,"Miami, FL",13,46,35,4.0,8/17/2016,Excellent place!  All the food is very good a big plates   The cheesecakes are the best! Must try the philly steak and the chicken Madeira  The only problem of this location is that always is so so crowded. So we ready to wait for your table  Definitely I will came back
Peter J.,"Miami, FL",0,27,,1.0,11/16/2017,"After traveling throughout the United States I officially found the worst cheesecake factory restaurant and the winner goes to:  The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant Inc.  In the city of Aventura at the Aventura Mall!  I actually found a manager named Devon Brady who has to have the worst attitude I have seen from a manager in the hospitality business.   A guest felt sick and threw up all over the lobby area of the restaurant.  No one thought to block the area off or put up a wet floor caution sign.  Instead one guy started to clean the floor with a broom and allowed me to walk through the disgusting throw up when I questioned the employee why wouldn't you tell me to watch where I am walking.  The manager named Devon Brady told me ""I have no control over guests that throw up all over the floor""  Although that might be true you do have control over telling your other guests to watch out for the throw up and try to guide your customers around it.  I guess that is too much to ask from the manager Devon Brady to actually use common sense!"
