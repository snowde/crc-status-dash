Monica F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",635,94,191,5.0,8/25/2015,"I had a great experience here. We were seated right away. We had a really awesome server who had a great understanding of the menu. She was super friendly and made conversation (but not too much lol). She helped me make my own concoction of my food.  I had been to another Cheesecake Factory previously and remembered having some kind of pasta with pink sauce. I described the dish to her, and she said that they don't really have an item on the menu that has ""pink sauce"". She recommended something that a lot of other people have ordered, which is a combination sauce made out of alfredo sauce and marinara sauce. This was a perfect mixture and fulfilled my craving for what I was wanting. She made sure that I was happy with the food that she helped me create. The lemon drop drink was very good. The bread was good as always. The mac and cheese balls appetizer is also always delicious."
Sandra A.,"Hollywood, FL",1,4,82,1.0,12/17/2015,"Disappointed...quality of the food and size of the dishes has suffered.  Gumbo, tiny rubbery shimps is a river of watery salty sauce around a tower of sticky smuchy and flavorless rice. The black bread was awesome :)"
Andrew H.,"Kansas City, MO",11,11,3,2.0,3/29/2017,The food is good ... when you finally get it and if your lucky you'll also get what you ordered. Though if they are remotely busy stay away! Took 20min for drinks to be delivered after waiting close to 10 to be able to order them. Refills were always slow and not timely in being noticed. Took 20min for 2 pieces of cheesecake. Got so tired of waiting for our CC to be picked up fished enough cash up to just be able to leave! Took over 2 hours for 4 people to eat!
Rob R.,"Miami, FL",0,10,5,3.0,8/7/2016,"I usually enjoy eating at restaurants of this franchise. This time was different... While staff was friendly as usual food wasn't very good.  I ventured in the Sunday brunch menu and found ""chilaquiles!"" - one of my favorite Mexican dishes.  The plate came in with a generous portion as it is typical of The Cheescake Factory, but it looked like a large bowl of Nachos with pieces of scrambled eggs and a few chunks of fried pork (carnitas). It didn't look  like chilaquiles.  Maybe the item was incorrectly named and should have been labeled as 'Breakfast Nachos' or it simply was a rendition created by someone who has never eaten Chilaquiles.  Either was it was just a bit disappointing. However the friendly staff and people around me helped had an overall good brunch experience."
Jonnell B.,"Verona, WI",27,3,,2.0,3/19/2017,Eggplant parmigiana was not cooked all the way through. Mashed potatoes were not mashed. Subpar quality food.
Bryony H.,"Savannah, GA",2,75,319,2.0,12/15/2015,"So far before we sat down the hostess was rude and did not look up from whatever she was doing to address us. The seating was relatively quick. The waitress was slow, totally ignored us, unless we literally had to look for her. She brought us what is us cold and hard bread which is usually hot and fresh. She began to walk away without taking our order  Smh. Plus we had to get another hostess to get someone else to take our order. When we finally ordered andreceived it she handed me the hot plate and ran off. Never again will we waste or time and money at this location. This is the first cheesecake factory we have ever had such horrible service. We always find one when we are out of town but not this one ever again.  The two stars are for the food only."
Solange D.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",46,2,2,1.0,9/11/2016,"I used to come all the time here, but this time was awful! The service was below average. Even though the server was very nice he never refilled our drinks something that is not acceptable. Then I order my usual dish: carbonara pasta. First they bring me an empty dish of pasta so I told them to bring the usual amount of pasta. Then when I tried it the taste was disgusting! Super mega salty, the bacon was not cooked well, the pasta undercooked. I had to return my dish and ordered chicken strips with French fries. I ended eating alone because the whole party was eating, even though the dishes weren't as they used to be. Furthermore the server never pick up the things empty from the table and the table was a total mess.  When I asked to speak with a manager the only thing she told me was ""I apologize"" and she left.  Now I understand why the place is almost empty now, without long queues as it used to have.  I won't come back."
Mig L.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",5,6,1,4.0,10/5/2015,"The strongest happy hour in the mall. Also the most bang for your buck.  Either come with friends and split several appetizers weighing in at $5.50 or crush their skinny cocktails that don't skip on the bite and cost the same. I prefer a little of both. Bartenders close to excellent on mixing their various combinations of moonstone and long islands.  I appreciate the bread regardless of solo dining or not. I've been here 30+ times now and can only remember two times when I've felt a little bothered by their service. Their items on the happy hour menu are still big for the costs and I find myself taking some home often. All in all you can get a little buzz and food in you for under $20 which is always good feeling. Regular hours are pretty good too, but this is strictly a Bar review in my eyes."
Alberto S.,"Miami, FL",20,6,,4.0,3/7/2017,"Dog friendly environment. Love the fresh bread at the beginning of the meal. The food is good. Portions are big, and the desserts are yummy. I gave only 4 stars, because I had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated."
Chelsea R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,4.0,3/20/2017,My server was so sweet to my friend and I. The food was definitely served promptly and was delish!
Cindy S.,"Miami, FL",28,48,72,5.0,7/1/2015,"Always enjoy the atmosphere and food! What's not to like about a place that has so many varieties of cheesecake. The brown oat bread is amazing! Also, you should definitely try the sliders! Very tasty bun with just the right amount of burger. Service at the bar is always fast and friendly!"

Hope P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1495,745,9030,4.0,4/19/2014,"Solid four stars. My fiancé was turned off from ordering a burger at Cheesecake many years ago, and I urged him to try this restaurant chain again. We found out at the busy hostess circle that we'd be seated in 10 mins it seemed shorter than that to me.  This Aventura Mall location seems busy every time Im here. You will also hear almost every language but English customers in the restaurant. We come before going to a movie at the AMC in the Mall. The service is always great. We had waters and they kept them filled.  I ordered the Caprese mozarella pizza it was thin crust, great cheese and flavor. I gave my man a bite and he said it reminded him of the pizza from Italy. I recommend the pizza. The Smokehouse BBQ burger made with onion rings, bacon and cheese.  The burger was well crafted and the side of fries come in a wax paper cone in a metal spiral holder, so not that many fries come with the burger -he didnt complain. It was a great burger. We came back and ordered dishes for dinner that were great. Got a Slice of the Linda's layered chocolate cake to go.. I must say as a chocolate lover I compare every piece of cake to it, and none make the cut.  Cheesecake Factory really makes outstanding desserts. The layers of chocolate icing and moist chocolate cake and topped off with chocolate chips up the side and served with whip cream. I really love this cake! Another fav is Godiva chocolate cheese cake as a chocolate lover I even had ordered one for my birthday one year! My man is a red velvet cake fan. Some places don't come close to red velvet, Cheesecake Factory knows what's up in desserts. Great place for good service and good food and atmosphere."
Enzo F.,"Montreal, Canada",0,27,1,5.0,7/31/2016,"I went to the restaurant to grab a piece of their cheesecakes after watching a movie at Aventura Mall. We arrived after 11pm and the waiter decided to serve us. He was extremely nice, one of the nicest waiters I've seen in a long time. We could see that he was happy to work there and very happy to serve us.  He suggested his favourite cheesecakes.They were all very good. The banana cheesecake was simply amazing - extremely creamy and light !  I strongly recommend this restaurant for a quick and delicious snack !"
Helen H.,"Palm Harbor, FL",12,6,,2.0,7/31/2016,"This is the first time I visited this location. Normally I would rate it 5 star, but the service was horrible and the food was lacking. First, the waiter took about 10 minutes to take our drink order. From there, it did get a little better, but not much. As for food, the chicken romano was the worst I had ever had. It looked like they cut a chicken breast into at least 3 layers, it was that thin. Half of it was just burnt breading with no meat visable. Besides from that, I think they only put maybe one tablespoon of marinara on the pasta. Luckily, I was on vacation and will not be visiting this location again."
Trish C.,"Miami, FL",53,23,14,2.0,12/23/2016,"Chicken and waffles benedict for brunch...took almost 45 minutes to get my food while I waited at the bar. The egg yolks weren't runny at all, the food was lukewarm. Waste of time and money."
Jil B.,"Bay Harbor Islands, FL",91,2,7,5.0,1/23/2017,"Their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic pasta is the best! I repeat, THE BEST! Two thumbs up for this wonderful dish!"
Oksana D.,"Orlando, FL",4,5,15,5.0,2/26/2016,Love this place ! The service is great. Food is very delicious. I love coming here! The Ahi Carpaccio is yuuumm and crabcakes are pretty good too for appetizer.
Mark T.,"Miami, FL",0,14,2,5.0,12/30/2016,"Simply Incredible! I met up here for dinner to catch up with my brother and we're greeted with drinks and fresh bread. We started off with the avocado egg rolls and the ahi carpaccio, two fantastic appetizers and then finished off sharing a pizza between us both. Daniel was our server today and was excellent at getting everything out in a timely manner. Between the great service and mouth-watering food I'll definitely be coming back here again :)"
