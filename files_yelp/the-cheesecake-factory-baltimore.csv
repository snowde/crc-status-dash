Meagan P.,"Middletown, MD",141,136,200,5.0,12/27/2017,"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in the Inner Harbor area. You definitely get the bang for your buck! At my most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which featured breaded chicken over spaghetti pasta in a buttery sauce with arugula salad on top. The dish was flavorful and honestly 2 meals in one. We also ordered the chicken samosas as an  appetizer (technically, it's considered a ""small plate"" instead of a full blown appetizer...perfect serving size for two people!) and they were wonderfully seasoned, slightly spicy, and fall apart in your mouth delicious!  For dessert of course, you HAVE to try their cheesecake. They serve at least 30 different kinds and they have plenty of gluten/sugar free options. I usually go for the classic original, but this time I was adventurous and tried the tuxedo (chocolate mousse, mascarpone cheese, chocolate fudge) and would highly recommend it for all chocolate lovers! Be wary that the cheesecake slices are huge and can easily be split between two people."
Owen R.,"Toronto, Canada",186,1262,1839,3.0,11/27/2017,"First time at cheesecake. This location appears older? Table dirty, cutlery not clean on the table. The Santa Fe salad was very good, Fettuccini also tasty. The actual cheesecake, excellent. Biggest challenge at this location; staff was yelling loudly to one another, dropping F bombs, very poor management allowing this.  Also an expensive meal, no drinks, 1 order of cheesecake; 60 bucks."
Stephanie W.,"Madison, WI",28,172,41,4.0,10/28/2017,"Always a go to place of mine when I am in a new town. This time in Baltimore, right across from the meeting place, this was a solution for a late dinner during my first night in town. I tend to get the same things every time i go. My classic favorites are their glamburgers, pasta or salmon with buttercrust. Make sure to leave room for dessert as their cakes are awesome. My all time favorite is the key lime cheesecake. I always try to get one for dessert or for take out."
Bryan R.,"Mt Sinai, NY",1,7,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"2 waitresses argued with my girlfriend and I that this was a medium burger. Manager apologized and took it off the bill but, at the end of the day, this is how people get sick. I wasn't born yesterday. The fact that someone had the audacity to even argue this blows my mind. There are way better options in the inner harbor."
Nikki W.,"Charlotte, NC",1765,605,4319,3.0,4/30/2017,"The location and patio right on the harbor. That's why you come here.  It's a Cheesecake Factory. You know what you're getting when you go to one of these. We needed a late dinner spot and opted for this because of the massive menu. It can be overwhelming. If you can't find something on this menu you like, well then you may be the problem. My sister got pasta, the nieces a veggie burger and crab cakes, and I went with the Renee's Special (Half sammie, soup, and salad). It was all fine and did the job. Maggie loved her veggie burger, which is a big deal because she is super picky.  Our server was really friendly. After a long travel day for our group, it was a nice relaxing dinner and just what we needed."
Joe D.,"Louisville, KY",89,201,195,3.0,10/6/2017,"What started out as a terrible experience got better. A poor greeting was corrected by a great Harbour view table and a very bad G&T was re-poured with fresh tonic. Lettuce wraps were quite good and rushed service was not bad. Overall, the Harbour made it perfect!"
Shauna P.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,298,123,2.0,11/7/2017,Smelly restaurant. I've never experienced that before! Bartender was not very responsive even though we were at the bar in front of her. Good was lukewarm not hot.
Deanna C.,"Cambridge, MD",75,18,24,3.0,8/28/2017,"We always look forward to eating here!  This time we weren't 100% satisfied! Although we were seated quickly, it took our server a long time to stop by! I asked for water without lemon, so they gave me a side dish! When I entertained the thought of using one, I noticed a small piece of hair on it! My turkey burger was delicious, although it was messy! I had to eat it with a knife and fork.  The lettuce in my salad seemed wilted! They sat us in the back by the door that the workers constantly went in and out of multiple times! It locked afterwards, so at times they would bang on the window. We must have been close to the work area because they were very loud and some of the conversations were unprofessional."
Kia W.,"Palm Bay, FL",35,102,66,4.0,5/5/2017,"I love cheesecake factory and have visited many locations in several states over the years. Since I currently don't live in close proximity to one, I don't frequent as often as I like. I was happy to see this location was within walking distance to my hotel. We stopped in for late night appetizers and drinks. Although service was a little slow, we were happy with our food and the drinks were nice and strong. The key lime cheesecake I ordered was divine."
Angelo A.,"Honolulu, HI",553,1156,1023,3.0,3/6/2017,"Stopped here for dinner after a long day: +  Not crowded.  We came on a Friday night.  We walked straight in and got a table right away.  In contrast, we had dinner at a neighboring restaurant the previous night and because of the convention, it was PACKED.  The wait time for a table there was 1 hour.  Also, at the Cheesecake factory at home (Waikiki, Hawaii), there's always a line and they don't take reservations.  This was a nice change. +  Decent prices.  We're used to inflated tourist prices at home and were expecting something similar here, but were surprised that the bill was pretty modest.  In fact, we were so surprised with the total we thought there was a mistake and actually double checked the menu. +  Service was pleasant and attentive. We knew the entree sizes are typically HUGE, so we decided to share appetizers (goat cheese and beet salad, mini crab cakes, buffalo blasts, fried mac and cheese, korean cauliflower).  Food was ok.  The beet salad was probably the tastiest.   All in all, a safe choice.  Not spectacular, but not horrible either."
Cynthia F.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",127,191,479,3.0,10/3/2016,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night and it was packed. We were quoted about 20 minutes for a table for 2 but decided to sit at a table at the bar because we could still get full food service and there was one available. My three stars is more based on the restaurant vs our server. Our server was doing the best she could but it seemed like she had too much on her plate. It was probably almost an hour between sitting down to actually getting our food. We sat down, ordered drinks about 10 minutes later, ordered food, didn't get bread for another 15, and finally eventually our food. The food we got was pretty good though. I got the chicken Marsala and BF got a shrimp pasta dish. My pasta probably could have fed a small army it was HUGE. I definitely had enough for dinner the next day. We also got some cheesecake to take home cause at that point we felt like we had been at the restaurant forever. I would still come back to Cheesecake Factory because I love their Cheesecake but this visit was just so-so."
Breana B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",70,184,189,3.0,3/5/2017,The food was amazing! The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was very tasteful and the portion was very large. I also ordered two Strawberry Martinis that were DELICIOUS.  My only concern was the the woman who we were led to so she can seat us. While we were standing there she was cursing to another coworker about an incident that happened. Extremely unprofessional! She could care less about the customers standing there.
Tradina D.,"Baltimore, MD",324,40,143,4.0,8/2/2017,"Monday July 31 was the last day for half price Cheesecake Factory.... National Cheese Cake was celebrated two days at The Cheesecake factory this year with half price on all cheesecake flavors. Hubby and I tried the birthday cake flavor and the snicker flavor, yep the snicker flavor is our favorite cheesecake ...The line was out the door when we left, we got there 11:30 am no line and they let you buy as many as you want and they even gave out a coupon for free cheesecake on another visit if you spend $30 that day  ...... The NEw Birthday cake was so good better and fluffier better than I expected and they cut the NEW birthday cake flavor slices extra big, I guess for promotional purposes."
Rick C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,112,64,2.0,1/30/2017,"OMG... The Cheesecake Factory is usually, if nothing else, consistent. It may not be great but it's normally reliable in serving decent food with pleasant service.  Not this location on the Baltimore Inner Harbor. I ordered the seafood gumbo and the 'chef' forgot to incorporate the cream in the base. Hence I was served a large bowl of seafood SOUP. I kid you not. It was literally nothing but a spicy broth.  Beyond this, despite repeated promises that some bread had 'just gone in the oven,'  the waitress made herself scarce and didn't return with the bread until I was halfway through my soup, er...gumbo.  Good grief... It was a Monday night so maybe they were training new cooks or the slow staff were working?  A marginal Cheesecake Factory."
Sophia M.,"Frederick, MD",0,13,2,5.0,12/4/2017,I really appreciate the quick service and great experience we had today at the Harbour Place.
M B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,2,,2.0,11/26/2017,"A recent trip included dirty silverware, filthy atmosphere, and unfortunately slow service to get water.... I could have boiled the harbor water faster than this location could turn on a tap."
Tang Jinkuan T.,"Newport, RI",2,2,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Service is really bad....  Wait for a long time but without even a napkin or folks.... Finally, all dishes come , however , no waiter at all. When waiter showed on, just ask"" do you need box? "" "" Do you need order extra things?"" when we just work it less than 30mins... Then, gave us bill and stood nearby waiting for writing tips.... WTF?! Never will come back again......"
Jacob F.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",3,11,18,1.0,1/11/2017,The herb crusted salmon is not cooked! Very bad! Seems like it was frozen before going on grill.  The avocado egg rolls was very oily and didn't taste good at all. They offered a replacement but we declined.
Lauren L.,"Dillsburg, PA",20,92,253,5.0,7/31/2017,"Our experience at the Cheesecake Factory today was wonderful as always! My mom and I split the chicken quesadilla (so cheese-y and delicious) and got the Smore's and Original cheesecakes for dessert. We took advantage of Half-Price Slice Day! Service was a little slow, but otherwise good."
Sammy L.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,,3.0,12/27/2017,A nice place near the harbor my seating area had a nice view of the water. I understand this place is busy there was a time I waited for some time Im giving this a 3 star as there was a child crying next to my table so it ruined my mood...
Rachael B.,"Baltimore, MD",3,28,41,1.0,6/6/2017,"BAD. THE WORST. SMELLY. GROSS. UNPROFESSIONAL. JUST WTF. I don't even know where to start with this one. Just...don't go here you guys. Go to the one in Towson or Columbia...just so much no.  *EDIT: I can't really say to much about the restaurant as a whole...this review it mostly for the bar area only* Let me just say how bad it smelled in here ok? It smelled BAD. Whoever mopped the floor the previous night must have used old water or something because the whole front room smelled like clothes left in the washer for 2 days.  I wanted to give them benefit of the doubt and blame it on the harbor but as I walked around different parts of the restaurant it was obvious the smell was coming from the counters and floors.  Arrived at 5:15 on a Friday and it wasn't quite busy. People we were just starting to show up for the Happy Hour rush. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. I'm guessing the bartender who was serving us was about to clock out or something because she kept rushing us through our orders and then giving us a check. (I'm assuming she wanted us to pay and tip before she left but we literally had just got there....) After she printed the 3rd check we had to tell her - ""Hey were gunna be here a while and probably order some more stuff so can you just keep the tab open???"" I mean really that should have been obvious from the start. But the real upset came when the next bartender showed up for her shift. She blew into the bar making a whole bunch of noise and then proceeded to CHANGE HER CLOTHES RIGHT AT THE BAR.  Shirt off. Bra out. Tummy out. JUST EVERYTHING OUT. WTF?? You guys don't have an employee lounge or locker room? A BATHROOM???? Like she really just changed her clothes in front of all us just sitting at the bar. AND THEN she decided she was just going to get to work taking orders and making drinks. Didn't wash her hands or anything. I get it. If your running late for work you want to jump right in and act like your working and do the damn thing. BUT AT LEAST WASH YOUR HANDS!!!!! She was sweaty and winded and it just overall wasn't a good look... Now hey- I know what you guys are thinking. She was probably having a rough one and I should cut her some slack. But even still- this was my first experience at this location and I'm sorry but it was a bad one and I have the right to express that! Half way through my time at the bar the manager had to come out with a toilet plunger and unclog some drain at the bar that was messed up.  ***Imaging sitting down at the bar trying to enjoy your meal when some guy comes right in front of you with a freaking plunger and starts thrusting it up and down right in front of your face*** No excuse me. No I apologize but... just WHAM. Out of nowhere he just pops in with a huge plunger and starts hacking away at a clogged drain.....wtf guys...what the....f*ck. One of the bartender girls was like, ""Haha did you get that from the bathroom?!"" He smirked and didn't answer... I REPEAT HE DID NOT ANSWER.  Everyone sitting at the bar just stared at the guy. Like....are you going to confirm to all of us t patrons that YES INDEED THAT TOILET PLUNGER WAS NOT ACTUALLY USED ON A FREAKING TOILET BEFORE YOU BROUGHT IT OUT HERE AND STARTED USING IT ON STUFF RIGHT NEXT TO OUR FOOD AND DRINKS???? Guys....just not. All the no.  0/10 would come again."
Henry E.,"Ann Arbor, MI",121,62,19,3.0,12/30/2016,"Only in the US of A does a chain called ""Cheesecake Factory"" attain such success. This one in particular was bustling non-stop from the second we walked in till we signed the check. If you're in the mood to stuff your face with tons of food, you've found your lunch spot. Falafel salad was good enough -- falafels themselves were actually delicious, but the salad was lacking in cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. -- and the avocado egg rolls could've used a bit more flavor. Overall happy with the food though. Service was a tad slow as they only had one hardworking waiter covering too many tables."
Anthony N.,"Lorton, VA",90,28,7,3.0,7/29/2017,"The food here was decent, I got the Chicken and Shrimp Jumbalaya and the portions were huge! As for taste, it was average. But that is just me, since I like my pasta with more thick sauce. Service was a little slow at first but then the waiter was very attentive with refilling drinks."
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,3.0,4/15/2016,"Early Dinner Date -_- My boyfriend and I came here on a very busy Sunday; I think there was a cheer leading competition or something. As soon as we walked in there was people everywhere waiting to be seated and we thought to ourselves oh boy! We went to the hostess stand and asked how long the wait would be and she said 30-40 minutes. Mind you we haven't ate all day and we were starving. We decided to wait the awful long 30 minutes. I manage to look around the bar area to see if there was seats for us. One couple finally got up and we took their place. We was excited and starving. Our waiter cleaned off our table and gave us some water to start off with. We had a while to look over the menu since it was super busy there. We decided on two small plates; stuffed mushrooms and chicken samosas. The chicken samosa was pretty good and the sauce that came with it was amazing; it gave it an extra zest to it. The stuffed mushrooms was okay, I was expecting a more explosion in my mouth; I love stuffed mushrooms but this one was okay :( We both ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which we normally don't do. We tend to ordered different items to try each other entrees however; it sounded delicious! The presentation was beautiful however; the taste was very bland. You will need to add a lot of salt to the noodles. The chicken and shrimp was okay; plus the tomatoes was good too. The fettuccine pasta had regular pasta and green pasta. If you get this meal don't expect to be WOW by it. We was highly dissapointed! I would not recommend this entree. We literally ate the shrimp and chicken and a little bit of pasta and was done. Now on to the desert; we are Oreo lovers so of course we ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I have to say the Oreo cheesecake was the best part of our entire meal and that's just sad. We didn't finish it all due to being over stuffed and it being extremely fating haha. Our overall experience was okay, the server was very attentive; I forgot her name but she was nice and pleasant. I would come here again when it's not busy. This was my boyfriend first time at this particular location and he wasn't  impressed. Out first date was at Cheesecake Factory in Arundle Mills :)"
Raymond A.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,9,10,5.0,8/7/2017,"Greetings, I was at your restaurant August 7, 2017 for my Birthday. The Food was Delicious and Exquisite. My Brunch was a Bacon, Jack, Spinach and Bell Peppers Omelette, Potatoes & Toasts!  Great hospitality from the staff, our Gracious waitress was Jarae, she exemplifies what a waitress suppose to be... She was Kind, Knowledgeable & Polite. I had a Great Afternoon!!!  I most definitely will recommend my Family & Friends to have Lunch or Dinner there... and I will be back very soon!!!!"
DL B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,39,5,2.0,9/30/2017,Hiring additional staff to support a clean and sanitary restaurant is strongly recommended!! Completely unacceptable conditions!!!
Charlene H.,"New Ringgold, PA",0,45,33,4.0,6/25/2017,"After a 20 min wait.....we were seated inside next to the inner harbor.    We ordered the mini crab cake appetizer which was good.    At our tables we ordered the quesadilla which was ok.   The bacon grilled cheese sandwich which was good.   An order of carrots which were glazed with pecans and they were yummy.    I had the Pit beef franchise dip sandwich with sweet potato fries add some Dijon mustard and it was very good.   We ordered too much food.   I wish we shared the meals.       The wAitress was vey pleasant and helpful.   She gave us some cups of ice water for the afternoon walk on around the harbor.     We needed to come back for slices of cheesecake to tAke home.   Thankfully we have a cooler in the car.   I plan on having a bite of the sinful cake each night this week.     Yes, try the cheesecake!  (About 10/slice.)."
Tiera K.,"Baltimore, MD",31,77,397,3.0,3/27/2017,"I don't know 1 person who haven't had a meal here. This location of course is the 1st one in The Maryland area which is awesome for the harbor. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants normally but I will say that this is a little better than some. Since parking is horrible in the harbor i prefer to go to the Columbia location. Today I went to Happy hour and I never ever had a problem with customer service here is always top notch to be a chain but today I'm guessing it was a manager or supervisor screaming to the bartender that just came on duty ""you are over pouring"" and of course he didn't hear him the 1st time and he comes and says it 2 times while me and other guests are sitting there which to me is so unprofessional he could have pulled him to the side. On top of the shift change along with the rush of guest coming in. Now do I want to hear the bartender is over posting drinks that wasn't mine? Nope! So yup I'm upset. Now to the nice happy hour menu everything was $5.95 you can't beat that! Now to the selection of cake, cheesecake and so on. I'm in love with everything here. My favorite is the red velvet and lemon meringue cheesecake. Meals: I love the shrimp scampi, 4 cheese pasta and the meatloaf. The serving sizes are always huge!! You most definitely get your money worth here which is not going to be much."
Petal M.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,9,,1.0,11/8/2017,Stopped by for coffee and a snack. Incredibly rude staff. No one greeted me. Asked for a latte. Rudely told me that machine was broken. Asked for a cappuccino. Rudely said that wasn't available even though it is made with espresso. Finally got an espresso and a carrot cake. Then they turned the register off by mistake. Waited for a while for it to turn on. Had to ask for cream and sugar. Actually mixed my drink myself at the cash register while waiting for the register to turn back on. Paid $14 for an espresso and a slice of cake! No utensils were given. Asked if I could sit in the bar area to eat. Was told that my order was to go even though I didn't order to go. I am sitting in the bar area writing this review. This place probably gets business because of it's location. I would not come back here. The service is abysmal to non existent. It is not even rush hour. Only reason for the one star is because the cake is actually good. Charm City my butt! Hmph!!
L W.,"Daly City, CA",55,6,5,1.0,9/18/2017,Came in for an appetizer and a piece of cheesecake. I waited 1 hr and 45 min to receive 1 out of the 2 items that I ordered. The server was unprofessional. I told her I will pay for my bill at the front counter and will pass on the cheesecake because I did not have a whole afternoon to waste. She shouted at me and demanded I pay her specifically because she was my server. I'm very disappointed that she did not apologize for anything and she made a scene. The manager also did not approach to resolve the issue. I'm a customer. I can spend my money anywhere and I chose to spend it here. From this experience I can tell that they do not appreciate their customers here. Completely unacceptable. An email is on its way to corporate. A blog post will also be shared on a food blog.
Camice J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"This review is for Paul Herbert-manager. Yesterday, I had the unfortunate experience visiting this establishment.  I work for a major humanitarian organization, and I value the treatment of such practices.  Upon arriving to establishment, I ordered a drink from the bar. The glass was filthy, however the bartender was amazing about it and swapped glasses quickly. We were seated by an amazing waitresses ( the epitome of what this place should model in terms of service) named Jayla B. I selected this place as I wanted something familiar to celebrate my boyfriends work accomplishments. Let me cut to the chase, after reviewing the menu, I selected an item that I thought were buffalo chicken blast-which I now know are discontinued thanks to Google.  However, I received something very different. After politely asking the woman (not my waitress) who set my order down what happened to the buffalo chicken blast, she rudely told me I had the wrong restaurant and did I want them or not? I I asked for my waitress, as I do not engage in someone's lack of knowledge about the history of discontinued items in the manner she presented herself. Jayla B took our order. The food arrived unpleasantly cooked and lacked taste ( we ordered Cajun pasta with a side of Alfredo as we did this before). The manager Paul Herbert came to ask us about the meal we returned. Now, my boyfriend is a ""go with the flow man"" and even he hated it.  After telling Paul my issue , and then repeating my cold appetizer and dirty glass experience, he rudely responded, ""The cajun sauce is a broth (yelp readers, please note that this menu item is listed as a Cajun cream based sauce and not a broth) and the reason the meal was bad is because you added Alfredo."" Shocked (as I also own a very popular catering company and work as the head chef in addition to my day job) I responded that the broth should have flavor to add decadence to the ingredients in the dish. Furthermore, me adding Alfredo (which looked like evaporated milk-guess the chef was heavy handed on the whipping cream in the sauce and forget to season the entire meal) should have complimented the dish, but such an addition was not the reason it lacked flavor and texture. I also mentioned that the sauce ""broth"" (whatever Paul mentioned) did not even hold the noodles and my dish was watery. Paul tries to convince me I was the reason I did not like it. I ask for my waitress Jayla. Jalya, whom was AMAZING, took another order for us (please note, I have been here for two full hours now.) This meal came back terrible as well. Disgruntled, we ordered what we came for-dessert.  I asked Jayla how the bill would be handed. She said she would bring her manager. Guess who comes back? Paul. I asked Paul how he would adjust the bill after explaining my experience with both meals, and his less than exemplary customer service and rudeness. I asked him what he should do to ensure I invite my colleagues back or how he wanted me to share my overall unsatisfactory experience at his restaurant. I added that the highlight of my evening was Jayla and how well she treated us knowing we were unhappy and did not eat a meal. Paul kneels beside me, seeing the second meal touched by one bite of dissatisfaction.  This man says, "" I took care of the appetizer but because you ordered a second meal. You are going to pay for it."" I repeated, I'd be more than happy to pay for what I consumed, however, I was not paying for what I did not eat- the second meal. After moments of back and forth banter, he told me I was paying and had ""police on deck"" to handle situations like this. I did not mind him calling the police because I was the one being robbed-being charged for 2 meals not eaten.    During this time, the dessert came (Paul went to get the bill). I had requested the dessert to be voided. Paul told Jayla to take the dessert away because I was not paying for it. Jayla looked confused, but followed the bosses orders- who lacks the competence and professionalism to have the position. When the bill came, Paul told me he was not leaving till I payed.  He stood up beside me, and hovered over my table for the duration of this experience.  Mind you, the ONLY reason I paid was because my boyfriend dislikes confrontation of this measure and we had a flight to catch. I paid for the second meals, although I told Paul it did not meet my expectations in our earlier conversation. He gave me his card and told me he would be okay if I shared this experience, so I am. After this, I will call the Better Business Bureau, write Corporate and share my experience on all social medias for this location. Furthermore, every single friend and colleague will not visit this establishment when in town for business.   I will not rest until Paul receives the necessary training, education, intelligence and empathy to be a manager of a food chain in which prides themselves​ in the customer service experience."
Sasha B.,"Baltimore, MD",16,1,,1.0,9/23/2017,The hostess at the stand was very rude. No sense of customer service. The waiter did not come to the table to help our party of 5 after we were seated for 20 minutes.
Rummy V.,"Columbia, MD",316,232,988,4.0,1/22/2017,"Initially we went here off plan. The wait was 20 minutes and was very busy. We were seated in 20-25minutes and got a booth! I'm addicted to the complimentary bread and butter! For appetizer my friend got wings and for course my friend had a burger and I ordered the jambalaya shrimp pasta (something different). I tried the pasta and it was horrible and dry! There was more seasoning on the side of the plate as decoration then the actual pasta. The waiter took the pasta back in hopes of it to come back with taste but it came back with oil and dry seasoning. It was so bad the manager even apologized and said that it wasn't cooked right, they gave me the option of trading the dish for something else so I choose to pack the crab wontons and the apple caramel cheesecake. They turned out great! The waiter Gene, was amazing! Very attentive and compassionate with great customer service!"
Dreyon W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,We came too Cheesecake Factory which we love and we sat down it took roughly 10 min for a waiter too finally greet us so I'm thinking during the wait he is getting bread or even water but brings nothing we ask for water and bread and wait another 15 minutes for that and than we make a order for appetizers and get those 20 min later and finally we decide to place a hour which took a surprisingly hour ! Food was Fresh bread was slightly warm
Robert O.,"Millville, NJ",53,577,284,1.0,7/5/2016,"I've been hearing about the Cheesecake Factory for some time.  My wife suggested we dine here on date night sometime. So there we were at the Inner Harbor, my daughter and I, looking for a place to dine.  we saw this and thought, ""Why not?"" Yuck! The menu is huge.  I had a Cuban sandwich, my daughter pasta.  She wouldn't finish her dish.  Mine was the blandest Cuban I have ever had.   Service was weak.  We were not a priority to the waitress.  We skipped dessert, hence the cheesecake.  Admittedly, they looked in the case.  I'll never know, however, as I'll never dine at this chain again.  There was nothing distinctive about the menu at all."
Armani Y.,"Washington, DC",122,144,462,2.0,2/19/2017,"This was probably one of the worst Cheesecake Factory locations I've been too. The service was great, but the food wasn't. I ordered my usual pasta and it didn't taste the same as it usually does. I'm not sure if it is the fact that they are a touristy location, but the food doesn't taste like Cheesecake Factory's food normally taste."
Bob M.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,80,23,2.0,5/21/2017,I was in Baltimore by the inner harbor so i decided to have dinner at my favorite restaurant. I ordered the filet mignon medium but instead got a hard cooked crispy steak on the outside and medium well on the inside. The veggies were tasteless and bland. Not much effort was put into their most expensive dish. What a shame. I guess not all Cheesecake Factory locations are the same.
Luke K.,"Rochester, NH",24,5,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"Terrible. I've been seated for about 45 minutes. Our food was served maybe fifteen ago. We still don't have napkins. They served me half my meal. I've finished it and I'm still waiting on my mashed potatoes. They've gotten my drink incorrect twice. Ordered grilled asparagus and we got fried. The hosts/hostesses were extremely unpleasant.  Overall they are liars, incompotent, and we still don't have napkins. EDIT: We were just told ""I don't know if the kitchen is going to make any more mashed potatoes.""  If I ran my life like this restaurant ran it's business then I'd be dead by now. SECOND EDIT: They offered desert and we still don't have napkins. To her credit, our server was very pleasant. THIRD EDIT: We all ordered slices of cheesecake to go and when I got to my hotel I saw that mine came in pieces, like a child's hobby model kit. This place preys on dopey tourists, because it is obvious that they don't get repeat business."
Jonathan F.,"Cape Coral, FL",92,254,1964,3.0,7/24/2016,Food was pretty good not outstanding but just pretty good. Server guy was a little strange but friendly. Atmosphere was very nice. Walls and floors and all around very creative art and decorative. Sat right across front the bar and tall tables with seat at the long long table. My Wife's family and I and a family friend. We all had fun and enjoyed eating out together at this location. After we ate we shopped around the mall. Which was cool.
