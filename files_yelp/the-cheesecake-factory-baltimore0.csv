Jasmine T.,"Washington, DC",512,100,118,2.0,11/25/2013,"This is a very unfortunate Cheesecake Factory location. I feel it has a lot of great potential, but need stronger management in terms of training staff on hospitality. I've only dined here once and it will be my last time.  We arrived around 3:00 pm on a Saturday to catch a late lunch. We only ended up there because the place I really wanted to go to had weekend happy hour (La Tasca), but it didn't start until 4pm. We didn't feel like waiting a whole hour, so we decided to brave the crowd at Cheesecake Factory.  Since there was a 45 minute wait for a table, we sat in the bar area - which we were told - was attended to by a waiter. We noticed when we sat down there was the folder that contains the check and 50 cents laying on our table. We were surprised someone would leave such a crappy ""tip""; however, we should have taken it as an omen. A sign sent from God to run far...far away from The Cheesecake Factory! We saw the waiter a couple of times, he visited several other tables but it took him 15 minutes to come to our table and take our drink orders. It took him another 15 minutes to make it back to the table. Bread...10 minutes...taking our food order another 10 minutes...we were trying to be patient. We know that we were sitting in the bar area, but we saw him talking to other parties. We were more confused than anything -- why would he talk to other patrons, but not to us? I blame my personal lack of confrontation on the sheer fact that I was terribly hungry. After finally coming back to our table to take our meal orders we noticed it took the server a while to actually put them into the computer. I finished my drink and wanted another, but he had not returned to the bar area. I approached the bartender and tried to order a cranberry juice. She was very rude and even hostile! The lady wouldn't even pour me a cranberry juice; mind you I'm hungry, thirsty and very tired of waiting at this point. I even tried to explain to her that we had been waiting a long time, but she cut me off and told me order it from my server. She summoned the same server to the bar area, told him that I wanted a cranberry juice and he brought it over...5 minutes later (eye roll.)  When I received my food it wasn't hot, meaning it probably had been sitting in the kitchen for quite a while. It tasted good, but it kind of doesn't make up for the fact that we received such poor service. I was too hungry to send it back, but we did let him know it was cold and that we felt we waited for a very long time. The only reason we didn't ask for a manager was because it was too busy. The restaurant side was crazy, and disorganized so we can only imagine the problems guests may have been experiencing. Next time, if I'm ever in Baltimore I'll stick to my gut and wait the additional hour for La Tasca to open up!"
Ingemann N.,"Manhattan, NY",13,129,13,4.0,12/18/2014,"Went there a Saturday afternoon after Thanksgiving and the place was packed. We avoided the waiting list by getting a table in the bar area (they had no problems with our kids there). The ambiance at the harbor is great and the bread was good, which was lucky because the service was slooooow. The tuna and the salads were fresh and seasoned just right, but our kids were not too happy about their dishes of the kids menu. The size of the portions (or maybe because we were still recovering from a Thanksgiving dinner) didn't leave room for their signature desserts this time, but they are big enough to share among the whole family"
Asia R.,"Baltimore, MD",49,57,23,2.0,6/13/2015,"This review is about the service and not the food particularly. I've been to Cheesecake Factory on plenty of occasions and it is one of my favorite chains so I figured this one would be no different. I was wrong. When we first walked in, a party of 3, we told the hostesses and they were so busy giggling and laughing amongst themselves that we were sitting there with blank stares wondering if they were really even helping us. When we did finally get seated, our waitress, who I wish I remembered her name, came over and took our drink requests. Neither of our drinks were alcoholic, all regular drinks. It took us 15 minutes to get those and that's when we knew this was going to be a long night.  To be a Friday night, they were not particularly crowded. We figured with as many empty tables there were, we would be able to catch a movie afterwards. We put in our food orders and waited another 30 mins for our food. When we got our food, my order was wrong. I ordered 'Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon' salmon, asparagus, mashed potatoes. I received a 'Herb Crusted Salmon Salad'. When they sent it back, the manager came out. Told me there were two similar things on the menu and she just got confused. The waitress never apologized for the mixup. Came over hundreds of times but never said sorry about that. Waited another 30 mins before I got my food. When my friend ordered cheesecake, she brought it out and then she decided she wanted it in a box. The waitress walked around to about 3 or 4 tables with the cake in hand, breathing over it and the customers breathing over it, before she finally went to the back with it.  The food was okay, not great, but not terrible either."
Tempie S.,"Stafford, VA",63,2,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Looking forward to lunch today at The Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately, when we walked in we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 mins waiting for someone to greet us.  A server walked out of the kitchen and asked how many in our party and then walked back in the kitchen to relay it to someone. Then two different ladies walked out arguing with each other. One of them walked to the hostess stand and proceeded to just look at us. She didn't greet us or ask us how many in our party.  She just stared at us like we were somehow bothering her. I told her we had a party of 3. She typed something in her screen, then threw her hands up and yelled with attitude ""All tables are full, 10 min wait, what's your name?"" She was the rudest hostess we've ever encountered, anywhere.  Obviously we walked into the middle of some sort of employee augment that had the ladies upset.  The result for us was a completely hostile, unprofessional and unpleasant atmosphere.   At that point we decided this may not be the best place to have lunch and left. Please have your hostess staff work on their customer service skills."
Nikki V.,"Frederick, MD",42,220,229,1.0,12/7/2014,"Well well well... I waited to post this because I thought I would have heard from Mr. Cheesecake Factory himself by now, after our horrible visit to this restaurant but no one ever contacted me. Soooo on to the first visit to this location and yes, the last. We stopped at the harbor on our way back from Delaware because we were dying for some cheesecake. I believe someone else wanted to taste some food or had been tasting some food as well. After our hour wait as you know it is always packed at this place. We frequent the factory but this is our first time at this location. Thank Goodness!! We went in with the family and during our dinner, auuuh while we were eating huhh. My youngest child spotted a critter crawling on the back of my daughters seat. He was trying to tell my daughter and he began waving his hand in the air. I figure he thought it was a fly. Well the dang thing never flew away. Once he finally caught her attention she almost knocked the whole table over and the food that was on it. She had her other brother almost on the floor trying to get out the seat. This is ridiculous. Yes, come to find out it was a ROACH!! Yes, roaches at the cheesecake. I NEVER... I waved down the manager and showed him our visitor. He said he would move us and our food. We were standing up waiting until they could clear off a table. Well it took about 5 minutes for that to happen it was not quick, let me just say that. We continued on trying to enjoy the evening but it was hard. The manager took my name, address and number and told me someone would be in contact after an issue like this because they would need to know what happened among other things. Well as I said, I waited before I put this post up as we visited this location November 15th and still no contact from Mr. Cheesecake. Come on now!! Definitely will not be back here unless I read about a insect tent going over this place because we know ROACHES don't live alone. If there is one... there are 2 more.....Mom and dad... yes!!"
Arlena S.,"Panama City, FL",62,15,5,1.0,10/4/2015,Horrible service... We waited in the bar area and for a half hour and we were ignored by our waiter. Then after we finally got seated it took a while for our waitress to come over to us. In the middle of us ordering the waitress walked away while we were talking to her. I'd skip this place. Not worth the time or money.
Jesse F.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,327,3,4.0,4/23/2014,"Three months ago I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Now I've been four times. And I'm obsessed with fried mac and cheese balls. Please note that I don't live in a city with a Cheesecake Factory. And I don't have a car. So it's kind of an extra impressive/extra chubby feat. Our wait was only about 20 minutes during prime dinner time on a Tuesday. The food was the same type that I've had in San Fran and Richmond, but my party had a really awesome waitress here. Jackee was attentive and nice and offered to split the bill seven ways without even an eye-roll."
Z M.,"Newark, DE",43,14,35,1.0,8/9/2015,"Horrible.... our main dish is out and the Mrs drink still hasn't come. The staff act as if they don't have a clue on what's going on. I asked for Medium well steak 26.00 and they bring out well done. I send it back and they leave the asparagus as if I am to eat cold asparagus with a newly fired steak. ******EDIT---- Second steak came, and was Well Done as well. ******* I sent it all back. I will never give them any business of mine ever. Don't waste your money! Sad to say you see who the staff caters towards. Never ever again. Thanks for the welcome to #BaltimoreInnerHarbour #StayWay #SaveYourMoney"
Risto K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Overpriced, not very sanitary outside. Food not bad but not worth the price... Waiting times are long. We took lemon raspberry cheesecake which was too heavy and not very tasty and too heavy..."
Eric G.,"Pottstown, PA",5,15,21,1.0,7/3/2015,Just awful.  Awful service.  Awful attitudes from the staff.  Takes forever to get waited on and served.  Never ever again.
Joe S.,"Trenton, MI",0,18,,4.0,7/1/2015,"Glad I stopped here for a meal while in Baltimore. Nicely maintained restaurant with good service and view. Mix drinks weren't watered down. Appetizer was a salmon spread and was delicious. Had jambalaya for dinner, which was fantastic and good portion size. No room for cheesecake!"
Jessica V.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,6,,5.0,9/21/2015,"Our server was Diamond and she was very nice! Food was really good, the steak was a little overcooked but tasted so good that I didn't even care. Overall really good."
James G.,"Saint Paul, MN",89,27,2,2.0,7/26/2015,Foods good. Service is crap. Like every plate that was brought came with no utensils and had to ask five times. Eventually we just got up and got our own plastic utensils. The hosts look and act annoyed. Our waitress messed up one order and forgot to bring the cheese cakes we ordered.
Kristen B.,"Clifton Heights, PA",29,4,,4.0,9/12/2015,The wait was long but the dinner was delicious!!! Definitely worth the wait. We had an amazing waitress. The place was packed and I know she has tons of tables but our cups were never empty and she checked on us constantly.
Christina L.,"Alexandria, VA",0,15,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Ordered To Go at the restaurant around 1:45 p.m. on a Friday. No organization in ordering at the cheesecake counter. There were too many people waiting around and no one asking who was doing what. Food quality was severely subpar compared to The Cheesecake Factories I eat at at Tysons Galleria and Arlington. The chicken in my chicken parmesan sandwich was dry, crusty, and overcooked. Presentation was sloppy.  Also saw the woman preparing the cheesecake put fresh strawberries on an eat-in's cheesecake dish WITH HER BARE HANDS. Will not be back."
Joseph M.,"Washington, DC",19,7,1,3.0,6/5/2015,"Long waiting lines, but very good food and cheesecake sampler love the cheesecake. Know what you get every time you go there and it's always the same tasting good food."
Mike B.,"Pikesville, MD",0,35,4,1.0,11/11/2014,"Disappointing service during a not-so-busy (Monday) lunch. Hostess rudely greeted us - ""stand over there and we'll seat you"" pointing 3 feet away on the other side of her hostess station, barely making eye contact. Food was OK, we got burgers. Mine did not come with the lettuce and tomato listed on the menu and which I specifically requested. The waitress, Erin, who we had been very polite to, threw a stack of bar napkins on our table (which we didn't request - is that CFs idea of service?) and asked ""how is everything?"" but literally walked away, mid-sentence, before our reply. When I drop $50 on a lunch for two people, I'd like the experience to be better than you'd be treated at a fast food place - it's definitely not, here, and there are too many nearby competing restaurants, with great service. I won't make this mistake, again."
Shelly E.,"Rochester, MN",18,34,3,3.0,8/18/2015,The food was excellent and so much we had enough for another meal BUT the service was soooooooo slow! Took us forever.
Ryan C.,"Lafayette, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/12/2014,"My associate and I stopped in because we were staying at the Hotel Renaissance. I am from California and have been to many CF's. I even worked at the one in Sherman Oaks. Typically they have a very high standard for cleanliness. However, after our meal we looked over and saw not 1, not 2, BUT 3 RATS!! This restaurant is absolutely DISGUSTING!!"
Alex K.,"Richmond, VA",1,69,1,2.0,4/19/2015,"If I was just rating the desserts, I would have given a 5. The pies were excellent! However, service and ambiance left a lot to be desired. I don't expect much but I do expect that my drinks are refilled when empty. We had to call another waiter several times to get refills because our waiter didn't return to the table, except when he brought the bill at the end. And though the building is nice and they have a great view, we were stuck in the back in what seemed like overflow seating with vinyl windows and no AC on a hot day."
