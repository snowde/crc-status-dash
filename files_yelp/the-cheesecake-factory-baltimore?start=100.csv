Erika F.,"Baltimore, MD",657,246,2024,4.0,12/27/2014,Service is good and the location is clean. Waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive when time is alloted for them. Food came out at a normal pace. I was just slightly dissatisfied with the size of my crispy crab bites and that the sauce lacked flavor and tasted like mostly mayonnaise but I could be wrong and realized that it is offered on the skinny menu. Maybe it's me or my taste buds but it seems at this location I need extra salt for every plate. I'll still patronize this one though. Good quality and huge servings. Beautiful view of the inner harbor at downtown Baltimore.
Vikki P.,"Port Arthur, TX",186,42,19,4.0,10/23/2016,"We originally planned to eat at Phillips, a nearby seafood restaurant. Sadly, it was closing by the time we arrived, so we made a quick change of plans and headed over to The Cheesecake Factory. Was elated this location stays open later than the nearby dining establishments. We were seated immediately and served without hesitation. Our server went out of her way to please us, especially my very picky 14 year old and nobody was disappointed with their meal. Sadly, we passed on the 3000 calorie dessert."
Josh G.,"Washington, DC",23,240,255,3.0,12/21/2015,"The cheesecake doesn't disappoint, but the food is more often than not hit or miss, which isn't made any more tolerable by the absurd wait times. Still, the menu has choices for everyone and I have a few go to dishes that tend to be reliably good. Maybe if there weren't so many options there would be more consistent food quality across the board."
K. Q.,"Randallstown, MD",0,8,67,3.0,9/29/2015,"This was my first time coming here, so I didn't know what to expect. We got a beeper and an estimated wait of 20 mins which turned out to be 10, so it wasnt too bad. The ambience is very low lit and formal. Perfect for a dinner date. (There's no dress code BTW) and there's a good mix of booth and table seating. My utensils were dirty, but they were quickly replaced, so no problems there. We didn't get any bread, but I didn't want any so that was fine too. Our server was nice. We ordered chicken potstickers as an appetizer. They were half boiled, and pan fried on one side so the texture was weird, but they tasted okay Nothing too amazing. I got a raspberry lemonade (really sour) but the sugar on the rim of the glass helped out. And my boyfriend got a simple sprite since the only tea they had was unsweetened. The menu is about a thick book long and its filled with sidebar ads which distracted my from ordering. I ended up getting the chicken bellagio which sounded better than it tasted. The chicken breading was soggy, the arugala was bitter, the prosciutto was slimy and the pasta was a little on the aldente side. In fact the best part about my meal was the side order of Mac and cheese - An Ooey Gooey Overdose of Cheesie heaven served in a small cast iron dish. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger that had thick cut slabs of bacon (putting down my weak prosciutto) and he recommends it. I had a bite. It was delicious! The waitress took forever to come back with the doggie bags and check. And when she did, i ordered the salted caramel cheesecake to go The meal was around $78 (gratuity tip not included) Overall, the experience was pretty good. I guess simple is better when it comes to a place like this."
Spandana M.,"Baltimore, MD",9,39,128,4.0,5/29/2015,"I went during lunch on a sunny day and the place was packed, but service was still great. I recommend getting something light to eat for your main meal if you are planning on getting cheesecake for dessert (and why wouldn't you?). The food tasted great! I ordered a margherita flatbread which was perfect because it was not too heavy. I had the Godiva cheesecake which was rich, creamy, and delicious."
Olga M.,"New Haven, CT",6,32,,4.0,11/14/2016,"Cheesecake factory is one of my go to places. View of Inner Harbor was fantastic. Great food, lovely ambiance, friendly staff."
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,5.0,9/2/2016,"I had yet another great dining experience here. Once again the food and service was pretty good. My only complaint is that while the service was very kind, they were also very slow. We asked for outdoor seating because we saw several empty tables, but we were rod that we would have a long wait. We did, but once were seated our server was relatively quick."
David S.,"Forest Hill, MD",11,8,,3.0,10/19/2016,Went to go eat here over the weekend with couple of friends. The waiter was very nice but our order was all messed up.  The food was not as good as it should be. The nachos were burnt and we did not get all of the food ordered(couple of sides missing) The back section of the restaurant was warm and seemed like the ac wasn't working. Also there was a weird funky smell that we had to ask to be moved to a different table. The waiter was nice and tried to make up for it. Overall it was a ok experience.
Lili R.,"Nassau County, NY",252,201,1259,3.0,8/31/2015,"I came here with my co-workers during our lunch break. We were immediately seated and the server came after a few minutes to take our drink order. He quickly returned to take our food order. In the meantime, he brought over bread and butter. I had the lunch special chicken chinese salad which comes with a plum sauce. it was very tasty but they were cheap with the chicken and it comes with mountain high fried rice noodles on top. I had to ask for a plate to throw that part away - wasteful, I know. My favorite part was that the server provided us each with our own receipt- score! It is not common for a restaurant to split a bill for a party of 6 - we didn't even ask, but when he suggested, we were thrilled! It merits 3 stars because the food is ordinary, nothing to brag about - thats typical in big chain restaurants."
William B.,"Cary, NC",12,31,5,1.0,8/27/2016,"Terrible service. Everyone in our area of the bar looked disgusted with the lack of effort. It took 15 minutes to get the menus. 10 minutes for a beer and wine. Food arrived 20 minutes later. Now we have two apps and two empty glasses. No water. No waiter. He is folding silverware while chatting up the bartender. The restaurant is easily 75% full. I wave him over, ask for more drinks and he goes away for 10 minutes before returning. I had to ask for the bill once we cleaned the plates and stacked them neatly with my wallet on the table. The bill was 51 bucks. Wasn't worth 25. Avoid like the plague. I've never seen such a large group of careless employees."
Keith O.,"Arlington, VA",92,19,2,2.0,9/10/2016,Worst host and hostess I've met. Went in on Sep 10 @ 9.30 pm.  Brought us to an occupied table and blamed it on customers.  Did not hide bad attitude. Manager was apologetic hence the 2 stars. Food took close to 30 min to deliver.  Flatbread crust too crunchy and oily.  Most of other orders were good.  Waiter was decent. Cheesecakes quite good.  Restaurant not recommended for dinner. Manager seems like he's trying hard and has good attitude. But replace the inept host/reception staff.
Nena M.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,6,1,1.0,11/19/2015,Not a good experience. Our waiter was kind ride. She brought the napkins and just put on the table and did not bother to fix it properly. Then shee brought the flatware and placed  them on the top of the napkinds and she left. Very unprofessional or she was not taught how to fix a table. So sad I just wanted to enjoy a cheesecake with my mother and this waitress ruined for me by taking long time to bring our items and the place was empty so no excuse of rush.
Warfare S.,"Washington, DC",19,80,1108,4.0,8/26/2014,This is a great place and had a open sitting looking the inner harbor..especially with OTAKON Convention that weekend. You get full after just one meal but still order dessert to go. haha
Jen P.,"Summerville, SC",118,505,267,4.0,7/1/2016,"Believe it or not, this was my first time ever at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu was OVERWHELMING. There was so much going on that it took me a good 30 minutes to decide what I wanted, and then I changed my mind 10 times. I know that people like choices, but this menu has way too many choices. I simply loved the stuffed mushrooms. I ordered the shrimp tacos and loved the contents of the taco but hated the taco shell. It fell apart and I was not able to eat my taco in the traditional fashion with my hands. The waiter also dropped one of my shrimp in the water glass of the person sitting next to me, and he would have dumped the contents of my plate in my lap if I hadn't been quick to grab my plate. I ended my meal with a to-go slice of Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. I nibbled on that slice of cheesecake each day for three days. It was rich, decadent, and so freaking good. If I hadn't had the experience of almost wearing my dinner and my tacos falling apart, CF would have received a five star rating."
Adyan U.,"Fair Lakes, Fairfax, VA",293,4,,2.0,8/7/2016,"The food was really salty, and unevenly cooked, the service is mediocre in all 2 stars nothing more."
Theresa M.,"Annville, PA",102,176,571,5.0,10/18/2013,"The cheese cake takes the cake! Lol I have tried about 10 different ones and no matter which you pick, they are all pleasing to the tongue!  Chocolate Tuxedo, red Velvet, Carrot Cake and Dutch Apple Carmel Streusel are some of my favorites."
Vidisha V.,"Tysons, VA",47,53,46,1.0,7/9/2016,Worst service and the manager was the most unethical and unprofessional lady I have ever Met. They made us wait for more than an hour and still were least interested to let us know what could be the additional wait time.
Courtney S.,"Delta, PA",1,5,,2.0,8/6/2016,"Excellent food, HORRIBLE service. The hostesses are VERY rude. I'm sitting here still waiting for our waitress to come back so we can ask for boxes and dessert, but we are not even sure we want dessert based on how long it takes to even get a drink!"
Cristina S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,36,68,4.0,8/21/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! It's not fine dining, but so what. The food is delicious. The Inner Harbor location is in the middle of all the action. The place was crowded, so we grabbed a seat by the bar which turned out great. Service was super fast and food was on point as usual. My steak Diane was cooked just right. The strawberry lemonade is my favorite non-alcoholic drink. Sweet and tangy at the same damn time. Definitely eat here if your in Downtown B'more."
Rafael B.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,68,9,1.0,7/31/2016,"Terrible atmosphere, unless you like to listen to the employees having passive aggressive arguments whilst slamming dishes around. The rudeness between them definitely makes the dining experience awkward. It also results in the slow service s well. Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to in 4 states."
