Kayla D.,"Missoula, MT",1,68,10,4.0,3/9/2016,"This was my first time being at the Cheesecake Factory. I have always heard good things. I really liked that they have a skinny menu! I ordered the pear and bleu cheese flatbread and was quite satisfied! The drink prices seemed a little expensive, but then again I'm from Montana (we have cheap booze). After dinner we took a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely couldn't eat more than a few bites but it was very good.  Also our server, gene I think? Was really nice and accommodating. We squeezed 7 people into a booth and he was very patient with us!"
Kaylee H.,"Baltimore, MD",31,199,26,4.0,10/27/2014,"This is like all the other cheesecake factories as far as food. The menu, the giant slices of cake, etc. So this review will not comment on the food.  In other news.... The view out of the restaurant is of the harbor, and when you go during the convention weekends, it's really fun to sit there and watch all the dressed up people walk around the harbor. I accidentally went one weekend during otakon, and got to see people dressed up in all sorts of costumes."
EmaLes F.,"Carolina, Puerto Rico",4,59,85,2.0,12/21/2015,"Went here for Sunday Brunch. To be honest, I have been in much better cheesecake factory than this one. Service was lacking. My milk had a fly in it. Pancakes were not good. The orange juice was good though.  Like any other cheesecake factory, prices are not that bad. But I wouldn't definitely go back."
Devon R.,"Columbia, MD",13,4,4,1.0,7/10/2016,"This had to be the worst place, I decided to go spend my hard earn money on a Sunday afternoon.  We sat ourselves at the high chairs which was  not a issue since the place was extremely busy. So we sat down waited for 15 minutes, the waiter came expressed about the soup of the day. We listen to that and asked whats good on the menu. Waiter told us about the few items which was blah, so we went with our choices. Which anyone can relate to. 1. We ordered the shrimp rolls which was very greasy to the point which our hands were super oily. We bearly could of eaten them because they were dripping of oil. 2. The dynamite shrimp tasted like imitation shrimp, and breaded to the point where we had to strip the bread off to try it. That was uneatable as well.  3. The so called - potato tots was verrrrry nasty and super oily. If you want to get a clogged artery, and have high cholesterol go this place. 4. We got there at 4pm, waiter brought our drinks at 4:35. Got bread at 5:15pm. Then took our order for 3 basic appetizer. I could of went to PF Chang's and enjoyed the service and food but wanted to try the hype behind this place. It was a very nasty, poor customer service, and horrible place to enjoy food. The crazy part is that I didn't want to write a review but the service & food was so disgusting that I felt compelled too."
Anthony P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,6,1,3.0,9/4/2016,"Restaurant was extremely busy on Labor Day weekend, about an hour+ wait. After being seated in a booth, I noticed a sour smell througout the booth areas. The place could use a good scrub down though the restaurant was visibly clean. Jade was our server and was very professional and patient/helpful while we selected our orders."
Lauren M.,"Saint Leonard, MD",0,3,,3.0,7/15/2016,"After being told the wait was about 30-40 minutes, we decided to stick it out. 50 minutes later, we were finally seated. After that the service was decent. Our food came out fairly fast. We did have to wait almost 10 minutes to get refills of our water though. The food was great and so was the cheesecake.  This place is great if you don't mind waiting a very long time to be seated. The food will not disappoint."
Iris V.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Being a Cheesecake Factory fan ...i was extremely disappointed in this location. We had someone in our party who was celebrating a birthday.  We asked to be seated outside and we were.  Every now and then the breeze blew by and it smelled funky. We ordered an app to share and then our food which included salad and miso salmon with white rice.  The app arrived and we were told the bread was coming. The food came and was dropped off.  No salad no bread.  The salmon had brown rice.  The waiter Erin never came by to see if the food was ok.  I had to flag another waiter down to ask if he could ask Erin to come to our table.  Everyone else had finished their meals before Erin arrived. The white rice was delivered ...we were done with our meals when the bread and salad arrived.   One plate which still had some tomatoes and sauce was pucked up and taken away by Erin without asking if the customer was done ...which she was not.  She had been dipping bread (now that we finally received it) in the sauce.  She went so fast and didnt even look us ...so we were not able to stop her. This is unacceptable and we got nothing more than im trying to get it out to you when we asked about the bread.   No heartfelt apology ...no visit from the manager no comps even though they knew we were there celebrating a birthday.  Not that a birthday customer should have a better experience ...but it was a special occassion. We were so over it and ready to leave that we left the credit card behind.  When picking it up the following day ...a manager said he had it and would pull it out of the safe and would be RIGHT with us.  Fifteen minutes later ...we see the manager behind the cheesecake counter doing all sorts of things ...looking right at me on one occassion and not even acknowledging my existence.  He was on his way to the other side of the room when we grabbed him and his excuse was ""i got pulled in a different direction"".  This from a manager?  Again ...missing out on that heartfelt apology. Dont go there!  There are many other wonderful restaurants in the area that will want your business.  I wish I had looked at the reviews before going.  Didnt think I could go wrong with this chain ...I was wrong."
Trish M.,"Baltimore, MD",3,5,,2.0,8/25/2016,"While the food was good, service was terrible.  There were a few waiters hustling but ours was not one of them.  Lots of employees standing around while others worked.  Would not go back. Better management needed."
B E.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,1,1.0,8/27/2015,"The hostess at this facility was not the most friendly hostess that I have ever dealt with. She was not rude, she just was not nice.  The server was prompt & had great suggestions but the food was terrible once it arrived an hour after we ordered.  With that said, we sat outside & it smelled like a dirty rotten trash pile.  I probably would not recommend this to anyone much less eat here again."
Emily J.,"Estherville, IA",49,22,12,5.0,8/25/2015,"Honestly I don't know why all the bad reviews? Went their for lunch with my 6 month old son. We were seated at a table right away. The waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered a mojito, bang bang chicken and shrimp, and of course a slice of turtle cheesecake. (Who doesn't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?) all the food was delicious and large portions that I could not finish!"
Mia M.,"Seaside Heights, NJ",44,158,75,4.0,6/5/2015,I thought when you find a hair in your nachos you get the nachos made again but for free. Nope I still had to pay. Anyways. It was a great outdoor seating by the harbor. I ordered the spicy guacamole nachos but after the hair they redid it but forgot to make it spicy. The pasta with shrimp was good! Key lime cheesecake.... Well I just tried it but a Lil too tart for me. Will be back next year when I go to Maryland!!  Luckily I still enjoyed my visit so I only took one star off for the Hair.
Angela S.,"Reedsville, PA",0,7,,1.0,8/9/2016,"If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would. My husband, grandson, and I walked in here at 1:30 in the afternoon. It wasn't very busy. We requested to sit outside and were seated right away.  Our waitress (can't give a name because she did not have a name badge on, but she had blue hair) took our drink order, which was a Sprite an 2 Arnold Palmers. The Sprite came about 10 minutes later, but no Arnold Palmers. Have you ever been in a restaurant that all the drinks were not brought out at the same time? Then we were told that the bar was making them. What the what? As I watched our waitress walking in and the door and still no drinks, I started to get a little peeved. Now, we are at 20 minutes, and still no drinks. I told my husband I was ready to go. If this was any indication of how long our food was going to take, I was no longer game.  The waitress came to our table (still no drinks) and said something about not having something. Ummm...our drinks maybe???I informed her at this point that we were paying for the drink we did get and were leaving.  No apology. Nothing. Charged us $3.00 for the soda and said nothing. Never will I ever come to this restaurant at this location again. According to other reviews, we weren't the only ones that experienced this poor service. Only if I'd have read YELP before even going here."
Ronnie B.,"Tampa, FL",3,9,,1.0,8/2/2015,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  Just went for a bottle of wine and 2 slices of cheesecake.  Asked for the pecan cheesecake and didn't know til 25 mins later that they were out of it.  Ok no big deal, I just ordered something else.  My gf went to the restroom and comes back and tells me it's absolutely disgusting.  I go to restroom and the single stall is absolutely disgusting as well and everything is empty.... Napkins, toilet paper, etc.  I go to the front and ask for a manager to let them know about the bathrooms and sit there for 10 minutes (not exaggerating) and then just leave.  Anyways we got our check and I left my credit card in it for 20 minutes (not exaggerating) and our waiter was nowhere to be found.  My gf just left cash for the waiter and he lost a little on the tip but we couldn't wait around any longer. They rely heavily on their location and great cheesecake and put zero effort (from what I saw) into any service.  They should be embarrassed honestly."
Coralie B.,"Halethorpe, MD",69,1,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Stopped by after Pokehunting a few weeks ago and it was a terrible experience.  We were seated at a dirty table missing an appropriate amount of cutlery (1 knife, 3 forks of different sizes, etc.) When our server came by he cut one of us off midsentence so he couldnt get his drink order in. Later when our food arrived, my friend that was cut off earlier got his food later than everyone else. My food was not great. The only mod i asked for did not happen (no tomatoes) and my fries were cold. My burger tasted very bland and was not all it was hyped up to be. The waiter rushed us towards the end and never came back with my change after i paid. I don't plan on revisiting."
Kim J.,"Leesburg, VA",10,32,1,3.0,7/8/2016,"Called ahead to see if they were showing the Euro soccer semifinal at their bar. Whoever answered didn't know and I had to suggest that she perhaps ask someone or just look. Turns out on their one small screen they were showing the game so I walked over from the Springfield Suites on Redmond. Ordered a margarita which was good. Ordered Vietnamese spring rolls that came out without any dipping sauces. After I asked, they brought out the sauces that were supposed to be on the plate. They were good! The waitress was pleasant and efficient."
Kevin B.,"Riverdale Park, MD",28,9,7,4.0,5/15/2014,"This was the 4th Cheesecake Factory location I've dined at and it was a pretty satisfying experience even compared to the others. Being right in the heart of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, it was fairly busy. Luckily we decided to go when the weather was nice and the sky was clear. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and sat inside but by the open windows so there was a nice breeze coming in. The food was what you'd expect from The Cheesecake Factory franchise. This time around I got the Bang Bang Chicken amd Shrimp entree. Wasn't that big of a fan of it though. The sauce with the rice was flavorful but the chicken and shrimp itself were pretty bland and a little tough. I also had a Pina Colada which I enjoued even though I don't like alcohol all that much. My friends ordered Filet Mignon, Buffalo Wings, and the Lemon Garlic Shrimp from the Skinnylicious menu. We also ordered the Pot Stickers appetizer which was REALLY flavorful. On the downside, our waitress was a little forgetful and we didn't get great service. We had to remind her to bring out the bread for us after we were seated. Overall we all had a pretty good experience. Personally I feel that the weather greatly influences how great, or horrible, your experience can be at this location. Luckily we caught it on a good day."
Yan Z.,"Middle River, MD",1,34,4,5.0,11/26/2016,"I've eaten at a lot of Cheesecake Factories and have been to this location several times. No other place can compare to it! The food quality, service, and environment can't be beat and always a positive. my son has severe dairy and egg allergies. Because I am nursing him, I haven't had dairy and eggs for 7 months!!  I've tried to go out to other food places. Most of them suggest that I get salad (um, thank you for that.) of course, you would think I am insane for going to Cheesecake Factory when I can't have egg or dairy! After all cheese is in the name. Oh you would have missed out. This guy, Paul (manager? If he's not, he should be) was absolutely amazing! He went above and beyond to take care of us. He even brought out a chef to customize our order! Because of Paul, I was able to have my favorite dish in forever! My son had great time exploring that doesn't send him to the emergency room. Wasn't because I haven't eaten like this in 7 months, even my husband loved the dish. The experience was so wonderful! I can't wait to go back!"
Jadia L.,"Williamstown, NJ",2,37,,3.0,8/3/2016,"Overall good service, polite staff. I like the option to be seated outside even though we didn't (it was too humid) Delicious food, great menu and selection of drinks and desserts."
Jill W.,"Baltimore, MD",37,112,36,2.0,6/12/2015,"The location is amazing. On the water, prime downtown Baltimore real-estate. Has a lot of potential. I'll be a pessimist and list the CONs first: - The bathroom was dirty.  -The host was seating someone for probably 4 minutes when we got there and so many employees walked by us, none of them acknowledging us with eye contact or a 'someone will be right here.' It was kind of frustrating.   When she returned she said ""Two?"" (as in ""Do you need a table for two?"") I said ""Outside, please"" and she said, ""We don't do outside service. Only to-go.""  I was kind of confused. I  guess it was because it was nighttime. But why would I order a nice, fairly pricey dinner to-go then un-package it 20 feet away?  I'd rather sit down and enjoy my meal with service. and be able to have a drink.  So we opted to sit down... -Our table was REALLY close to our neighbors table (maybe 1.5 feet away) and we were trying to have a nice quiet dinner out.  -The drinks are strong and tasty but REALLY expensive - $11 and $12, which once you add 20% tip equals $27 for two drinks. Ouch! -This may be a PRO to some but was a CON to me - the menu is beyond huge. It's an entire book. My boyfriend and I spent a very, very long time debating what we wanted to order. Chicken A VS. Chicken Pretty Similar to Chicken A, appetizer w/ seared tuna and avocado VS appetizer w/ seared tuna and soy sauce with dipping sauce... you get the idea.   This was overwhelming and I would prefer less options. PROs: -Amazing waterfront location. Found metered street parking fairly easily. -The Cheesecake is AMAZING!  We went simple and got the blueberry. So heavenly and presented well. -Food arrived quickly. I recommend getting your app then ordering your entree so they dont come out too close because the servers do not pace properly. -Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp was so excellent! My boyfriend and I shared it -the portions were huge. -Strong drinks. Service was decent, no problems and I was indifferent to our waitress. This place gets pricey if you add on drinks to your meal though.  I can imagine sitting on the waterfront has to be really nice!"
Emily K.,"Washington, DC",88,428,364,3.0,7/22/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is hit or miss for me. They have a HUGE menu with literally about 100 dishes in it.  The food is just okay to me. However, I have friends and family who have loved their food so maybe I just ordered the wrong things! The cheesecakes are absolutely delicious!! Sinfully delicious.....it's worth going just for them. I might need to go again soon...."
