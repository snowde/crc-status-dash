Kandis R.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,60,17,1.0,10/25/2016,"I came here with a friend for brunch on Sunday, October 23, 2016. We didn't have to wait at all, which was nice. We were greeted and seated right away. My friend ordered a mimosa and I had water. As we were sitting there conversing waiting on our food, a bus boy came by to clear the table next to us. He proceeded to take a rag and wipe all the food crumbs on the table right onto the floor, put two place settings on the table and walked away! It was at that point that we looked down and noticed that the floor under our feet was FILLED with food crumbs! I...can't understand why the food crumbs weren't brushed from the table into a bus tray or something. To have crumbs all over the floor under your feet while you're eating is disgusting! I can only IMAGINE what the kitchen looks like! As we sat and talked and waited for our food, we waited...and waited...and waited... We waited more than 30 minutes, almost 40 minutes for two brunch combos! We both ordered the same thing. The brunch combo consists of two pancakes, two eggs (prepared as you wish) and two pieces of bacon. I can't comprehend why it took that long to make essentially four pancakes, four eggs scrambled and four slices of bacon. Our server, while polite, never apologized for, nor addressed the wait. When we got the food...I mean...it was alright, nothing I couldn't have gotten from IHOP or even McDonald's for that matter. At least we would've spent less money and gotten faster service. Needless to say, I have no intention of EVER patronizing this restaurant again."
Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35,4.0,5/11/2014,"We didn't have the greatest waiter in the world-clearly he was having a cranky day.  That being said, I love this franchise and the food. I like almost anything on their insanely large menu. We went for lunch-then to the aquarium-then grabbed cheesecake to go. We went on a weekday and got a table for 2 with no wait-which was nice.  The location is obviously fabulous-right on the inner harbor, and if it's a nice day-ask to be seated outside. The location is relatively small but a good amount of tables are outside. I don't live anywhere near this location but would go again-and will go to the Cheesecake factory near me when I get the craving :D"
Tiggy P.,"Henderson, NV",2,32,72,3.0,9/9/2015,"Quick review: I was accompanied by a group of eight, who passed dishes around to sample.  Gumbo, crab cakes, crusted chicken, ribeye, fish and chips, and chicken and shrimp.  My favorite dish was the medium ribeye  was cooked and seasoned superbly.  My least favorite  was the crab cakes.  The crab cakes were mostly filler and very little crab.  More of a corn filling flavor.  On a positive note the waiter was attentive and she was informative."
Hashani S.,"Ventura, CA",492,523,766,3.0,7/8/2014,"3.5 stars We came here on a Sunday after visiting the National Aquarium since it was a short walk over and we were in dire need of a drink. I've never seen a Cheesecake Factory so crowded before! Luckily we landed seats front and center of the bar, I was not going to wait that long.  Our bartender was very attentive and friendly, always refilling our water and asking if wee needed anything more. We had originally come for drinks but, they didn't offer happy hour on weekends and a Long Island was $10. We just stuck to an appetizer, the avocado rolls. The rolls were too heavy on the avocado and just too small, would have been better with some more bell peppers or an added texture. The sauce put a sweet twist on the otherwise bland rolls (docked half a star). They were not worth the $11 we paid though (docked a star). All in all, our bartender was wonderful and the appetizer was ok. I would only come here to order half priced drinks and apps during a happy hour or split a large entree for lunch or dinner if I was in dire need of good food. The view is nice, its right on the harbor."
Randy M.,"Frederick, MD",1,41,29,2.0,6/22/2015,"We met some friends at this location to celebrate father's day.  It was crowded It but we expected that.  However I didn't expect the poor service and impolite staff.  At the hostess station, I witness the hostess being disrespectful to a customer.  Throughout our luncheon we noticed the unprofessional demeanor of many other staff members.  The lack of professionalism was unsettling.  Our waiter told my wife that her meal had a lunch portion, but charged her for a full portion.  When asked about it when we saw the bill, he said he didn't say that.  Overall it was a poor experience."
Nubian P.,"North Bethesda, MD",3,8,3,5.0,4/17/2016,Very good place to eat anytime of the day. Went here with my boyfriend & loved everything. The strawberry lemonade was on point.
Eric M.,"Savoonga, AK",9,844,434,4.0,4/16/2016,"Remember that regardless of the location or increase in price for popularity, this chain has huge portions. Our waiter, unfortunately, was just out of training and our appetizers showed up after our meals. Management was great about canceling those items. The dinner was great and our waiter did his best."
Ej Y.,"Laurel, MD",0,13,49,1.0,8/31/2015,Not even one star!! Service was so bad... Our group was sitting outside and the busboy was too loud to throw all the dishes and the waiter was not listening.  No more!!
Yong K.,"Manhattan, NY",564,444,114,3.0,5/11/2014,"I've been here twice and the location is great! view of the inner harbor and on a sunny day, you can even sit outside to eat. but the food has it's ups and downs. the cheesecake obviously is pretty good. -pasta da vinci - pretty good! a unique sweet and savory sauce with penne and chicken, but about halfway through, the sweetness is too overpowering and makes you get sick of it -louisiana chicken pasta - this was pretty good. chicken was well made and the pasta was flavorful - calamari (the breading wasn't good), porkbuns, burger were all just average...meh some of the other pastas my friends got looked good though, i hope to try that if i ever go again.. but i probably would want to go to little italy if i wanted good pasta.  so yeah, i recommend trying the pastas if you come here and ask for an outside seat if it's good weather!"
Janice F.,"Homewood, IL",0,13,4,2.0,8/7/2015,Went to pickup 2 pieces of carrot cake. After ordering and waiting for order we witnessed some really unhygienic things. An employee was preparing 3 strawberry cheesecakes. She came from the back of house with gloves on her hands. She talked to some co-workers (rubbing her gloved hands all over the counter top as she talked) then began sorting strawberries at the counter with same gloves. She then got her purse out from behind counter and went through it then went back to picking through the strawberries with the same gloved hands.  My friend and I were in disbelief at how nasty this was.
Janjan J.,"Kansas City, KS",2,15,90,3.0,6/29/2014,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and always ordered the same thing (Chicken and Shrimp Bangbang). Tonight I decided to try something different and got the Hibachi Steak entree. I ordered it well-done because I'm pregnant. It came to me a little close to burnt. Kind of a sad face there. For dessert, husband and I shared a slice of Toasted Marshmallow Smores Galore and it was AWESOME!!! It was my first cheesecake order in this chain and I loved it (I always skip dessert when eating out). It was crowded as usual and we were told the wait would be 40 mins., but we didn't wait that long. Our server was just doing her job, nothing extra in her efforts (meaning just took/gave us our orders and walked away sort of thing). My lemonade was sour, but I drank it anyway. I think just the best part tonight was my date and the awesome cheesecake."
Carly M.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",58,5,7,4.0,10/11/2015,There for business. The bartender was great and the food was up to par. Very small inside but service was great and cheese cake was packed to go
Raymond S.,"Reno, NV",4,52,18,5.0,3/30/2016,Cody the bartender was phenomenal with his work ethic and his drive for customer service.   He made certain that satisfied with my experience.  The crab and artichoke dip is the best I have had for this trip and appears to be a special for Baltimore.
Jenny H.,"Baltimore, MD",508,817,673,3.0,3/11/2012,"I came here once a week for the past month because of various friends in town, and I've gotten their farfalle (my favorite dish there) but it defiintely has not been as good as I remember.  The first time, there was tons of sauce but not enough farfalle.  The next time, we ordered extra farfalle, but they poured so much salt into the dish, it was SO salty I just tasted salt, nothing else. I also got the Carlton salad which I thought given its ingredients could have been a lot better, but it didn't taste very good."
Ashley O.,"Baltimore, MD",264,120,138,1.0,10/20/2014,"Ohh Cheesecake Factory! Lol okay, where do I even begin. I went here to dinner for the first time with a girlfriend of mine. We are both CF fans but, have never been to this location. We arrived around 9 and had almost an hour wait. While waiting we saw very interesting things. Those things were. BALTIMORE CITY RATS! These were large RATS eating in the corner of the restaurant where you wait. We screamed loudly because we had never seen that before in an eating establishment. Yes, I know and am sure mice are around but, really? In the actually restaurant area smh lol.  Anyway, once seated we began to order the tex mex egg rolls but, were told that they were all out so we said okay no biggy. We will order our entrees then. The waiter then informed up that they are out of all meats expect salmon. So if we ordered pasta it would come meatless. I wasn't really upset but, wanted to know would it cost less than since there was no meat? My question was never answered. The restaurant was very busy and filled with high school kids who were very loud. The restaurant was also understaffed bc after our waiter took our order when never saw her again. Not even to bring the check lol.  We waited a very long time for our meal. Once we finished up we wanted our fav dessert. Come to find out ohh of course the apple crisp was all out! Sigh Welp that ended dinner. We left right before close bc we were waiting for so long.  Note: I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone ! Poor service, dirty location and bad food."
J. Chris H.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,22,14,1.0,1/29/2014,"Don't ever book a large group. Our was 25+.  The room was dark and cold. The gave is 1 server. Mark the managers excuse was sorry that the way we are set up. He didn't even join in to help.  I say Mark is an excuse of a manager. He just walked away. Finally 4 servers came out and helped. Good news. My dinner came out finally, but cold."
Genevieve B.,"Baltimore, MD",153,11,30,1.0,2/25/2016,Uuhhh...food looks and taste horrible. ..a roach was at our table. ..drinks was sorry! Nothing like the other two locations!
Ludivine S.,"Baltimore, MD",7,4,,4.0,4/3/2015,"Waiters are friendly and attentive. We ate at a high table in the bar section to not have to wait for a table in the main room and enjoyed a relaxed ambiance, despite the noise from the other room.  We got a few starters instead of regular meals and we didn't expect to get so much food. The food was amazing.  Cocktails are fine but way overpriced for what it is. I wish the restaurant was less noisy."
Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",353,707,388,4.0,10/1/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Hands down my favorite. The only issue is the extensiveness of the menu. It's overwhelming! Geez Louise. I would love to try the brunch though. Word to the wise, don't sit outside on a nice day unless you want pigeon feathers in your ish!"
Thelma P.,"Baltimore, MD",115,2,,1.0,4/3/2016,The service here is horrible. The food ain't all that as the waiters here are not great. I won't be leaving a tip nor returning.
