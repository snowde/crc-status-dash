KyoungWhan K.,"Germantown, MD",0,9,,4.0,3/26/2016,"I went here three times for meal and once for cheese cake. Foods as well as cheese cakes are definitely awesome, but have ups and downs a little bit. The employees are friendly and provide good service. One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you need to be patient at peak time."
Mel W.,"Bowie, MD",1,6,2,1.0,8/10/2016,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory in the DMV, I usually go to the one in Chevy Chase MD and Annapolis MD. This one had bad service and food. My nieces ordered Mac and cheese from the kids menu and it looked and tasted like it was thrown together in a last minute attempt, it has a milky soup like flavorless sauce which was lacking cheese. My nieces couldn't believe it, they are 10 and 6. They reordered chicken stripes with fries, strips were just ok, the fries were all cold and dry. I ordered a specialty salad it appeared to be a week old, veggies had brown spots and it was wilted. I reordered the grilled salmon with white rice and sautéed spinich. How difficult is it to prepare this, the salmon was cold, the rice was cold and hard, the spinich was half raw and it was all flavorless. We were there for almost 2 hours mostly waiting. My recommendation, don't do it, such a disappointment."
Philip G.,"Tamaqua, PA",11,49,2,2.0,2/24/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great choice for groups because of the diversity of the menu, but as a chain it has lost a measurable amount of food quality over the last decade and this location is going down faster than most. The wait is longer than they quote when you check in, the service is generally slow and usually includes at least one mistake, the food quality at best is average and when we left Sunday night, a rat ran out of the building along with us. Lots of choices in Baltimore, skip this one."
Renee S.,"San Francisco, CA",34,24,50,2.0,7/23/2014,"If you are out late and looking for something to put your belly it's okay. If you looking to satisfy your taste buds, keep on walking.  My family and I came here because it was open till late. It was convenient but after this experience, I think there may be better options. Our waitress was playing a weird game of hide and seek with us. And we ended up flagging down different people whenever we wanted to order something. I guess she was hiding from the kitchen staff too because when she finally appeared with the bread it was stone cold. Same goes for our entrées. We got our steak then sides of fries and asparagus followed 20 minutes later.  As for quality, my Cajun chicken pastas was bland and came out black in color. Even the cheese cake was just meh. Maybe we will come back for the Fourth of July to watch the fireworks here but I don't think will be ordering more than drinks and appetizers."
Benee D.,"Glenn Dale, MD",49,5,1,1.0,9/14/2016,"My family and I went for brunch August 28th. The service was incredibly slow so I nicely asked if our waiter could receive some additional help since it was 13 people.  The manager approached me and stated the reasoning for slow service was my party didn't arrive at the same time. I went on to explain we had all been there for 45 minutes and hadn't received anything to drink.  He made the exact same statement and walked away. After an additional 20 minutes our order was taken. A full hour passed after our order was taken and still no drinks. Finally a waitress walked out with food and our waiter (who was serving drinks and food to another party that arrived well after us) told her not to serve the food. I was confused and surprised.  I then requested a  replacement waiter for my party because it was rude to stop food from being served after the long wait. The manager came to speak to me and refuse to give me anyone else. He kept saying the food would take a while and that it was our fault. So I attempted to redirect him by pointing out drinks had not been received after over an hour. The manager then admitted he checked the arrival time vs when our food was put in and confirmed it was over an hour. My husband asked the manager if he thought that was an acceptable level of service. The manager said no but still surprisingly blamed us for not arriving together. He became very upset place his hands in my face in a sort of back off me motion. I could not rationalize the reasoning for his tone and attitude, we were upset but never aggressive. So I took a step back anyway and suggested he go if he wasn't going to be of any service or resolve to the problem. The manager then yelled ""No you Go!""  which we did. I am still unsure as to how this escalated or why he took this tone to what is a very common service problem at a restaurant. I would suggest some additional training in customer service. I wish I had taken a picture of us leaving almost 2 hrs later with no drinks on the table. That would have been priceless."
Corinne H.,"Jericho, NY",0,6,,1.0,6/1/2016,We went as a group after college graduation in May.  While eating a mouse ran over the top of the rafters near us and we had to leave our dinner. It was a shock to see.
Alex M.,"College Park, MD",213,11,4,4.0,2/13/2016,"This spot has surprising amount of personality for a place so cookie-cutter. The best part of our experience was the bartender's stylish hair and the virgin daiquiri he made. The breadbasket was amazing. Reservations recommended, but they don't do them, so you're screwed! J/K just avoid peak hours."
Jimmy W.,"Halethorpe, MD",3,56,11,2.0,1/14/2016,"Hugely popular chain, but why? I never choose to go here. I'm always going along with friends. I don't know what the appeal is. It's always busy, and crowded. The food is never bad, but never that special either. Service for my big group is never tops. This location can have better service in the busy summer months. My last visit was the more typical slow winter service. One in our group had to go get a server."
Juan A.,"El Paso, TX",48,1,,5.0,3/9/2016,"The food was amazing, and the service was almost as good. Our waitress was well engaged and checked up on us decently often. The food is well worth the price. I recommend the crab cakes, they are a little pricey but VERY much worth the money. Best thing we ate by far."
Andy K.,"Baltimore, MD",3,34,3,3.0,12/23/2015,"Average food, no idea why there is always a wait.  Not like there aren't dozens of better restaurants in a one mile radius.  Server was VERY good, food was okay, used a gift card so no skin off my back.  Wouldn't go back and spend my own money."
Gary C.,"Vicksburg, MS",0,2,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"Save your time and your money! This is the worst Cheesecake Factory ever. It smells of puke and has flies all over the place. The back of the restaurant is aligned with the dumpsters and with a door being right there...the smell is absolutely horrible! My wife and my son went in there to eat, after waiting 21 minutes they sat us. The silverware had left over food on it! The table was not clean! It smelled like vomit! There were flies everywhere! DO NOT EAT HERE!!"
Elizabeth R.,"Monrovia, MD",13,24,1,5.0,1/2/2016,"My girlfriends and I went here.  We had an amazing server.  We sat in the bar.  Zach was very attentive and checked in on us many times.  He checked to make sure we had enough drinks, if we needed more appetizers.  It is refreshing to have great service when having an afternoon out with my friends!  The food was also delicious!  Get the avocado egg rolls they are worth it!"
Matthew D.,"Newark, NJ",55,160,29,3.0,12/5/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory lol . Big portions , decent food . Decent service . Overpriced cheesecake . With that being said , it's fine . Nothing special but when your hungry and there's one that doesn't have a 2 hour wait nearby, go for it ."
Sharia W.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,49,272,2.0,11/12/2015,"This particular location of the Cheesecake Factory empire is quite disgusting. Menus were sticky, utensils were slightly dirty, chairs were also dirty. Won't be coming back to this location in Maryland. Save your money and go somewhere else."
Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3758,414,2038,3.0,7/23/2012,"I'm generally a harsh critic when it comes to chains.  There's a lack of consistency with the food, ridiculous wait times, inflated prices and poor service.  Generally speaking, Cheesecake Factory can fit that description at different points.  Once in a while though, they can get things right.  This was one of those times! This Cheesecake Factory location is at the Inner Harbor section of Baltimore, overlooking the water.  From a physical standpoint, the restaurant is not a stand alone location but actually is in a small mall of sorts that's in the middle of the Harbor scene.  The mall itself is basically a tourist trap with a couple of restaurants and stores that sells refreshments as well as memorabilia.   Came to this location after the speedboat disaster.  My date emerged from the boat looking fairly presentable....minus a few hairpins and one set of eye lashes.  Nothing that dim lighting can't fix! We entered the restaurant and were given a wait time of 15-20 minutes.  As you would expect, there were several tourists packing the place.  So what do you do when you're stuck in a packed lobby with a date who has more detachable parts than a Mrs. Potato Head toy?  Start looking at the cheesecake display cases!!  So many flavors looking oh so good! We were finally seated and started putting in our orders.  Since we had lunch not too long ago, drinks and desserts were on the agenda.  It was also the safe choice because let's face it, cheesecake is the only thing this chain does consistently well.  Our waitress was friendly and fairly prompt as she took our orders and served us during our stay. I ordered the raspberry lemonade, which was amazing.  Very tart with a hint of sweetness from the sugary rim of the glass.  I think I had 4-5 glasses.  I don't know if I was being drugged but that stuff was like liquid crack.  The waitress did quip about putting me on restriction after my 3rd cup but one look at my dilated pupils and she made like a good dealer and kept the ""stuff"" coming.   We ordered the hershey and red velvet cheesecakes.  Very generous portions means happy days in my world!!  The red velvet was nice to look at and tasted good.  I'm not the biggest red velvet fan because it's more savory than sweet but that's just a preference.  The Hersey on the other hand is likely to be banned by the American Diabetes Association.  Chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate.  It was really good but honestly, it might have been too much chocolate....gasp....if there is such a thing.   Like any other tourist trap, it felt like the prices were a little inflated but either way, it's not a bad option in a high volume sight seeing location where many of the other choices specialize in highway robbery!"
Crystal H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,7,,2.0,1/7/2016,I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants  and this one was not to my likings I ordered a shot of Hennessy and the waitress didn't even remember until I mentioned it to her by then I had cancelled the shot only because I waited to long for her to bring it to me. The plate that I ordered was not the best either I don't think I will order it again. My overall experience was ok not as good as I thought it was going to be I don't know that I would eat there again.
Nathan S.,"Fairborn, OH",0,10,4,5.0,7/14/2014,"My favorite place for dinner on the Harbor! I've been 3-4 times for dinner over the past week as it is very close to where I'm staying. The prices are fair for the area, but the 3 things that really set this place apart are... 1) the Service - you may have a short wait during busy times, but it's definitely worth it!  All 3 servers I've had were friendly, professional, and responsive. Even had a manager walking by offer to refill my drink. 2) the Food - all 3 dinner dishes have been served hot, fresh, and delicious! I've found the entrees to be very flavorful.  3) the Desserts - it deserves it's own recognition. They sport a very impressive assortment of desserts to crown the evening out, especially if one is a fan of cheesecake!  Enjoy!"
Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,525,595,5.0,7/20/2010,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in B'more.  I especially like this location because when there is a wait you can walk around in the harbor. The pagers work pretty far. The portions are large enough to share. The food is always good and hot and there's something for everyone.  Some of my favorite appetizers are the Roadside Sliders, Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and the Firecracker Salmon.  My favorite specialties are the Ranch House Burger, Steak Diane and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club.  My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!   My favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango. They finally offer a kid's menu. They also offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread."
Cathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,16,4,4.0,1/3/2016,"Came here on 12/30/16 on a rainy evening, there was about a 25 minute wait which was understandable because of the holidays and the weather. After being seated, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio as an appetizer. Best decision ever, especially if you like raw fish/sushi. Best thing on the menu so far, honestly. We also ordered Smokehouse BBQ Burger and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. Please come here on an empty/growling stomach because the portion sizes are MASSIVE. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish could easily feed a family of four. We also ordered carrot cake-- which, as a carrot cake lover, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of cream between the layers, it was mostly just nut and very little cinnamon/spice taste. The Lemoncello Cream Torte was fresh and tasty! Our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes and we ended up boxing the rest of our food to go. The total of all of this was ~75 dollars, not including tips. We took a Fresh Strawberry 6-inch cheesecake to go (waited for it to thaw, of course) ... the best cheesecake ever. So creamy and delicious!"
Rolanda M.,"Portsmouth, VA",64,4,,3.0,4/10/2016,"I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory and have never truly has a bad experience until yesterday. I don't think people realize that bad service will ruin a meal. I have never been to a restaurant where I finished my appetizer long before my actual entree comes. It may seem extra bit when everyone around you (most of them came after you) have finished their entrees and are paying the bill and your food hasn't shown up then that's an issue. Not to mention the server barely coming to check on you or advise you of any delays. The food was good, the drinks were good (minus the suspect water) but the service pretty much will be the reason I won't return."
