S M.,"Collegeville, PA",0,12,3,1.0,7/2/2016,"Really bad restaurant experience in a long time. Food was bland and flavorless. One dish was undercooked and one over cooked. Plus, not all good came together. Very disappointed, it ruined our weekend dinner experience."
Pius D.,"Millersville, MD",36,1,,1.0,6/30/2016,"Horrible Service.  Waited 40 minutes and my wife spoke with the manager.  Waitstaff just passed us all by not even once saying ""Ill be right with you"" or even asking us if we could get started with drinks.   A waitress came out after the manager told her to, only to tell us we werent her priority.  We got up and left.  That was real nice to hear.   Never going to this Cheesecake Factory again.  And I dont recommend it to anyone unless you maybe go to the bar if you arent with family and kids."
Janell J.,"Randallstown, MD",55,95,565,3.0,8/30/2014,The crab balls was great the dynamic shrimps wasn't all that booo.The atmosphere was cool near the harbor site.
Andrew C.,"Downingtown, PA",28,66,168,4.0,9/3/2014,"I find it hard to go wrong when going to The Cheesecake Factory, especially for appetizers, drinks and dessert. This was the sole purpose of our trip to this location, and like all of my previous CF dining experiences this one did not disappoint. The wife and I kept it very simple with a Long Island Iced Tea for her and a Margarita for me. For eats, we had the Fried Mozzarella to satisfy the salty and the Red Velvet Cheesecake to satisfy the sweet. Perfection!  For the modest price we paid, we left very satisfied and we were happy with the service. This place like all other CF's gets super busy, so first come seating at the bar or high top tables makes for a quicker in-and-out dining experience. Overall, another great experience. Will definitely be back to this location and any others when the cravings hit!"
Chas R.,"Easton, PA",51,6,2,5.0,11/23/2014,Every year we come to Baltimore it's our tradition to have our last meal at the Cheesecake Factory. They have 1001 things to choose from and they always get it right. The food tastes great and the price is definitely reasonable for the amount of food you get. The customer service is second to none and Michelle made it that much better. SHOUT OUT TO MICHELLE!!
Paul S.,"Celebration, FL",499,261,286,4.0,7/5/2014,"Like all Cheesecake Factories, they are consistent in what they bring out to the table. You will get a nice experience and if you sit outside by the water, even better. The best meal service is brunch on sundays."
Renee T.,"Baltimore, MD",39,74,30,5.0,7/16/2015,"First  time to the Cheesecake Factory in the Inner Harbor.  The restaurant was clean and it looked in good shape.   I was kind of expecting a worn look considering the amount of tourists that walk through their doors.   The wait staff was friendly, prompt and professional.    We ate from the lunch selection.   It was delicious and an ample amount of food.   Overall, a great experience."
Ron B.,"San Diego, CA",137,125,27,5.0,8/20/2015,"Wouldn't normally come to a chain like this when visiting a new city but it was really late when we got back, and they were open.  We tried the guacamole egg rolls, factory nachos, and a couple pizzas with the works.  Altogether it was all very good!  The service was great too!  We ended up with wayyyy too much food and the leftovers lasted a few more meals on our road trip."
Joanna R.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",65,28,3,3.0,9/6/2015,If you get the crab hash on the brunch menu don't expect to get any crab. The outside seating is very nice with a view of the inner harbor.
Craig S.,"Purcellville, VA",4,11,4,1.0,9/27/2015,"First in the door on a Sunday morning, 50 minutes later and being told another 18 minutes until our basic breakfast arrives.  Order canceled, horrible service.  Two flies in wife's water.  If zero stars was an option it would have been selected."
Henry K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,4,,1.0,7/2/2016,After walking past an employee in uniform vomiting in a flower bed and a cook on break wearing a filthy smock I turned around and headed elsewhere. This place is disgusting.
Full C.,"Enola, PA",25,293,1,1.0,4/15/2014,"MANAGEMENT: take notice of this review. Food: excellent Staff: excellent Décor: excellent Price: moderate Staffing policy: ILLEGAL and Immoral.  If your waitperson serves you for 45 minutes, then there is a shift change, the replacement (who may only serve you the bill) gets the tip. UNFAIR. Dear CCF CEO, do all the work, then let me come in and sign a few papers...and give me your salary. TADA!"
Ashley P.,"Warwick, RI",407,540,1280,4.0,6/22/2010,"Cheesecake Factory remains in my top list of chain restaurants to partake in.  Their excellent quality appears to remain the same across the board.  Whether it be on vacation in Baltimore, MD or back home in Lil' Rhody, you're sure to encounter exceptional service and mouthwatering meals.  This is a reassuring this to have, especially when you aren't sure where you can grab a tasty meal wherever you happen to be.   The menu is ridiculously extensive, leaving you with a top 3 - 4 things you'd like to order.  They overestimated our wait by about 30 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise.  We were seated outdoors, under a canopy, with a beautiful view of the inner harbor.  Fans created a gentle breeze creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere in this crowded restaurant.   It was here the bf and I decided to partake in this locale's famed crab cakes. . . and tasty they were.  The chicken teriaki entree is packed with flavor, though I could have done without the grilled fruits adorning the edges of the plate.  While I would have loved to over-indulge in a plating of cheesecake, I was filled to the brim with my main meal.  There is no way anyone could eat all the food they serve in one sitting.  Had we been planning on setting back to the hotel, I would have certainly wrapped it up for a second visit.   I recommend this place to both locals and tourists who find themselves in the area.  And props to the poor waiter who had to deal with the awfully picky party seated behind us. . . ."
Brianna X.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,6,,4.0,6/27/2016,"This is me and my boyfriend's go-to restaurant whenever we go to Inner Harbor and we have been here many times. The food is good and has been consistent in quality. I think your experience really depends on who you get as a waiter/waitress, but you will generally always get someone who is friendly and hospitable."
I'Yann H.,"Baltimore, MD",0,4,13,5.0,4/19/2014,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this Cheesecake Factory! But above all was the food! Amazing and indeed delicious! The service was good, where I was seated was a little cold but other than that it was simply amazing! Go try if you've never been especially if you're not from Baltimore city the view of the harbor is beautiful at night!"
Sarah J.,"Baltimore, MD",427,95,62,3.0,3/24/2014,"The Cheesecake factory chain is pretty much the same anywhere you go. I've gone to quite a few, and it's always a safe option, with generous portions and good food if you pick the right choices.  Unfortunately, this one in inner harbor is no exception to some of the Cheesecake downsides, including not accepting reservations for small groups and the long waits for a table and for dinner to come out. It's in a good location if you're coming from public transportation, but a little hard to find parking. (Of course, this is inner harbor.) You get a bread basket with butter as you're waiting for your food. The dark bread is always gone in a second.  The menu itself is very overwhelming if you're a first timer. My go-to's are usually the pastas, specifically:  -Louisiana Chicken Pasta -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta -Pasta Da Vinci (-Cajun Jambalaya) Otherwise, specialties and burgers are good. Salads are nice, but I find that the prices are a little too high for what you get.  Cheesecake recs  (note: I always go for those that are not super heavy, as the red velvet and 30th anniversary chocolate are): -Godiva is always a winner for rich, dark chocolatey goodness -Banana Cream  -The Original/Strawberry -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake for something interesting (slightly heavy)"
Michael F.,"Baltimore, MD",41,172,146,4.0,4/18/2012,"I'll admit it. I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory even though I hate cheesecake. I was treated to diner here with a friend on a beautiful afternoon Sunday. We got there around 6ish and was told there would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around for a while and was seated almost exactly 45 minutes later. I started with the Roadside Sliders (8.95) yum, about 4 or 5 palm sized tasty sliders cooked to my requested medium rare, very tasty. My friend had the Crab cake app,(12.95) it looked great. For my entree I did the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (16.95) a great dish of spicy chicken,shrimp and diced ham served over a bed of brown or white rice. I like. My friend did the Cajun Jambalaya,(16.95) quite good as there was little talking while we feasted.   The iced tea here is some of the best tea I've had in a restaurant. the bread is delish too.  For dessert I tried the Lemoncello Creme Torte,(6.95) wow. I loved it. My dining companion took some cheesecake home. The check was about 100 bucks. Our server Jenell, (hope that's spelled right) was the quintessential experienced waitress. She had a bunch of tables but but we never felt neglected or wanted for anything.She handled being extremely busy with grace and balance. I wish more servers could do the same. Great view, Great food, and amazing service.. Two big thumbs up for the Cheesecake Factory!"
Bugrad A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,39,1,1.0,6/29/2015,"Do not eat here. Save your time and money for something better. They have no concept of quality food or good customer service. I wish I could give negative stars. They have messed up my order twice. Last time I got the Louisiana Pasta which I have ordered several times from other Locations (not in Maryland). It came out looking like an alien, burnt chicken weird colors and no flavor. I said I would never go back but today I had three hours to kill and came in for appetizer I ordered Asian Chive Lettuce wrap. The Lettuce was SPOILED AKA ROTTEN. Brown and Black spots and edges. I think I'll be reporting them to health dept... I'm so tired of wasting my time, energy and money here."
Patience M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",47,80,18,4.0,7/26/2015,"Made the mistake of going there during Otakon weekend, and they were super-busy. We arrived at 10:30pm, waited 20mins for an outdoor table, and once seated the food took about 20mins to be ready. Good thing we had their warm, delicious bread to nimble while we waited. We ordered small plates and appetizers, which true to Cheesecake Factory style were generous portions. The food was decent, and kudos to our friendly server who despite being overwhelmed was attentive and kept us informed on the status of our order while we waited."
Katie W.,"Damascus, MD",2,19,,4.0,4/6/2014,"This is the third Cheesecake Factory restaurant my husband and I have visited. We were told to expect a 50 minute wait but were seated in about a half hour. The food was excellent, as is always the case at the Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was friendly enough, but was a bit on the slow side. I would suggest investing in a few more waitstaff since it is clear they are understaffed during the busiest hours.  My biggest complaint is smoke from the outdoor seating area coming inside. Now I know it is legal for patrons to smoke outside, but I do think the restaurant should re-think the layout of the outdoor seating, so that the indoor diners are not as affected. We could smell the smoke every time the door was opened, and it was pretty bothersome."
