Marie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,22,6,1.0,4/9/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but Not this one!  The food was mediocre at best,  could have eaten the same food someplace for half the price.  Server was not great at all.  This restaurant needs an overhaul with its food and service"
The Bottomless Pi T.,"San Francisco, CA",104,413,696,3.0,1/15/2014,"We arrived with a large group, and were told the wait was 30 minutes.  Half an hour later, we were seated.  Different types of bread appeared at our table, they worked as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo.  The andouille sausage pieces were rather small, the shrimp was good, but the whole dish was a little spicier than I would have liked.  Although I would have liked a little more rice, the overall portion size was huge--there was no way I was going to finish all that food. Our server was wonderful, he was very attentive.  I had no room for dessert."
AL-amri Hamdan H.,"Luray, VA",4,3,2,1.0,9/7/2014,"My friends and i went to to cheeseckake factory in baltimore, the waitress at the door asked me about my name to find me a table i told her my name is Hamdan she said what and laughed and then she repeated the question and i said Hamdan and she laughed again, then i asked her anything funny she didnt reply, also she didnt reply when I asked how long should we wait, I requested to see the manager who did not react to my complaint, he just said i will solve it and that it. I contacted my laywer who directed me to contact you first to how will you response to the incedent."
Joanne F.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,5.0,6/14/2015,"On our last day visiting Baltimore we went down to the harbor and chose this place because it had a lovely view on the water. Despite the heat on this day, our server Mardy was delightful. He gave us such excellent service. The food was excellent. We had avacado eggrolls to start. These things are heavenly. The french toast was tasty and the bacon was nice and crispy as requested. I would definitely come back just for the friendly service. And the eggrolls!"
Rosa O.,"West Hempstead, NY",0,11,4,5.0,3/27/2016,"We only order cheese cake to go, eating at that place it's suicidal super busy but very professional when I order the lady was so busy but very  efficient she was outstanding the way she was taking care  the customers very friendly and polite."
Trevor K.,"Frankfort, ME",5,15,7,5.0,1/8/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is the bomb! This is as good as it gets for a diner style experience. I would compare their menu length to the bible, hence there is no trouble finding something on the menu for everyone.  I ordered The Classic Burger. It was a gigantic chop house hamburger. Served with a slice of grilled red onion, lettuce, tomato and french fries. It was by far the best burger I have ever had. Cooked to my perfection, very tender and juicy. And the fries were also amazing. We ordered red velvet cheesecake for dessert, which was huge and split among three people. Which was also very delicious. On top of the awesome food was the awesome service. I asked our waitress early on if they had onion rings and ranch dressing, in which she told me, ""We don't have onion rings, but those do sound delicious with ranch."" Later on as I was enjoying my meal, the waitress came back with a cup of ranch dressing for me to dip my fries in. They were absolutely divine dipped in ranch dressing. And the best part was, I felt like the waitress actually cared about me because she remembered me talking about ranch dressing earlier for onion rings. And on top of the awesome food and services, was the awesome price. Considerably less expensive compared to other restaurants in the inner harbor area. The restaurant is located right on the inner harbor, so the view is fantastic. And the atmosphere of the restaurant is also awesome. 5/5. Very Delicious. Great Service. Awesome Price. Fantastic Experience."
Sudhir M.,"Rahway, NJ",44,52,223,5.0,12/16/2013,"Had the same dish as my last visit to Cheesecake Factory - The Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. Have been many times to this chain of restaurants and find this one of the best dishes on the menu. It comprises Shrimp, Chicken, Andouille Sausage, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions and Garlic Simmered in a Spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. Topped with Steamed White Rice. And not to forget the basket of bread and butter and the desserts after meal."
Rachka P.,"Baltimore, MD",0,10,5,2.0,4/6/2015,"I went there just one time and I didn't like any of my plates,flavorless!The fried shrimps were super extra fried,I didn't even noticed which meat it was."
Caroline L.,"Philadelphia, PA",119,148,,3.0,11/19/2013,"A New Yorker recommended we go here. She was quite excited and told us it would be worth it. On our way there, she kept raving about the place and saying that we should believe her because she's from NYC. It was a funny interchange, but I'm glad she convinced us. She mentioned that the portion sizes are large. No kidding! Wow. But my friend was right in that the food was exceptional and that you could live for days on the leftovers. Seriously. That was quite handy because my hotel room had a mini fridge, but no room service. When I ate the leftovers in the middle of the night, I was quite grateful. I'm not a huge dessert fan, but the decadence of the chocolate cake was worth it."
Haichen Z.,"Charles Village, Baltimore, MD",6,6,11,5.0,2/7/2015,"Want to try lettuce wrap, steak Diane, Cajun chicken this time! Used to eat key lime cheesecake, want to change into new ones such as chocolate or mango taste. I do love the soup and salad here."
Brian M.,"El Paso, TX",1155,1121,7050,4.0,2/20/2011,Their Tiramisu Cheesecake is the best. My mom who usually don't eat desserts and sweet things couldn't resist and got addicted to them immediately after her first bite and we had to go buy extra after we had them in our hotel room hehe Service can be both a hit or miss
Sandara H.,"Orlando, FL",8,14,4,5.0,1/21/2015,Jamar made wonderful suggestions on deserts. ..love the bar! ! Would return again on a future visit to Baltimore
LaToya E.,"Baltimore, MD",451,580,816,3.0,1/6/2013,Its the Cheesecake Factory so you cant really blow me out of the water with a chain.. the service was decent and it was fairly quiet.. so its Meh.. i'll always return because its always the same..
Kalene W.,"Camp Hill, PA",69,110,26,3.0,6/27/2013,"We eat at the Cheesecake factory for some of our Baltimore trips. Always busy, always rather average. The lunch menu is very reasonable with huge portions and we usually try to sit so that we can see the harbor. The service here is average as well and it is simply a convenient place to eat while walking the harbor prior to baseball games."
Lauren S.,"Baltimore, MD",263,628,89,3.0,8/23/2013,"Every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory I always question why I even bother. My burger was simply ok. My daiquiri was good, but nothing was worth writing home about. I skipped on the cheesecake. I'm generally not a fan of it.  I didn't feel terribly good after I ate here, either. Maybe my food wasn't prepared right, but it is worth mentioning that I got sick. Maybe it's best to avoid this place."
Deanna M.,"Detroit, MI",0,65,36,2.0,12/16/2014,Franchise restaurant  so food will taste same anywhere you go but the service was not up to par. It is a very hot day and the temperature in here is probably hotter than outside. Bathrooms weren't that clean either. If your craving cheese cake not a bad place otherwise I would skip it. If your looking for a nice view in the inner harbor on a cool-er day I would suggest it perhaps in the evening ....
James R.,"Baltimore, MD",3,48,1,2.0,3/15/2013,"It could happen anywhere, but I had a bad experience with a roach ending up in my caesar salad. It scared the 6 other women at the table more than it did me. The waiter was apologetic and offered to make it right by getting me something else on the house...which I thought was a classy move. When the check came, they had not comp'd the meal as promised, so I asked about it. A manager came over and was implying that he would not credit the meal, only my appetizer. Eventually he relented because the ladies at my table began to make a stink about it on my behalf. I didn't ask for a free meal, but it was offered, so they should have honored what they promised. It's a case where a bad customer experience turned worse due to not doing the right thing to correct an unfortunate mistake. In general though, there is ALWAYS a 30-60 minute wait for seating at this location. There is also a very long wait for service and food once seated. There is not enough waitstaff for the amount of tables when it's filled to capacity, IMO. If you don't mind waiting, it's fine, but this is the main reason I don't frequent this location. It's in the middle of tourist central so it's no surprise. Dinner here is generally a 2-3 hour experience, so don't dine here if you're in hurry to go elsewhere after."
Emily R.,"Baltimore, MD",56,244,144,4.0,4/11/2011,"I mean, I'd give any cheesecake factory 5 stars if it was just, y'know, based on the cheesecake.  Alas, there are things like service and interior that come into play. I don't mind waiting at this one as much because it's at the harbor, lots to see, do, people watch, etc, while waiting. Sitting outside is pleasant on a perfectly pleasant day, otherwise it's too windy, too smelly, too humid, etc. Inside of this CF seems a little small, not enough booths which is what we all undoubtedly desire.  My food here has always been good. Nothing eye-opening to my taste buds but still very satisfying and more than enough bang for your buck. I am happy that a CF exists in Bmore's inner harbor. To sum up: cheesecake #winning."
Koral S.,"Silver Spring, MD",8,150,37,3.0,6/28/2013,This place is great for groups and those who are looking for different things.  The menu is extensive and food portions are huge.  Most things are well made - some lacking taste and distinct flavor but knowing that it is a chain - that is understandable. The cheesecakes are AWESOME - My all time favorite is the pineapple upside down coffeecake.  I have tried many but this is the one i keep coming back to ... when I do come here. Koral
Antoine G.,"Parkville, MD",405,2,,1.0,2/15/2016,"The CCF has tried my patience for the last time. Every time I come here the food is 'meh', at best. I just went yesterday on VDAY, and I was served a dry ass burger with no ketchup and with very little flavor. Then to top it all off, I had to call out of with the next day because I was throwing up the whole next morning (it's the only thing I ate that day so it clearly was caused by that burger). The waiter was nice but I'll NEVER go to a CCF again."
