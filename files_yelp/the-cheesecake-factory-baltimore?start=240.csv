Vicky C.,"Leesburg, VA",186,277,10,3.0,11/30/2013,"I am having trouble between choosing 2 stars or 3 here.  Mine was a 3, ""A-OK""... reasonably good and very friendly service, comfortable atmosphere, and yummy food.  Good, ""A-OK"" = 3 stars But the rest of my family was less impressed.  Hubby wasnt impressed with his food.  Daughter wasn't impressed with hers either.  They are both BIG eaters and will eat, I swear, nearly anything.  Son wouldn't eat his mac & cheese (he's 7).  Kids mac & cheese should be made with American, or Cheddar or Velveeta.  I tasted gouda cheese amonst the multiple cheeses in the dish.  Not popular with kids.  Shouldn't be on the kids menu. While the service was very friendly, the waiter did not ask ""how is everything"" after getting our food, so it wasn't until he brought the check back that I had the opportuinty to point out the boy didn't like his.  The waiter did not offer to get him something else or take it off the bill.  After having some time to think about that, I will say that impacted the tip.  I normally tip in the 18-20% range for this type of restaurant, and this waiter ended up with about 13-14%.  Still a decent tip, but I didn't think he'd earned the extra. Honestly, every time I go to Cheesecake Factory (maybe once a year or so), I am disappointed.  Too much hype.  Not enough substance."
Mars B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",11,77,19,1.0,11/15/2013,"""Look at the Mouse!!!!!!!!""  says my 5 year old freaking for real! really bad hostess rude!!!!!

Love CF but this place is a mess"
Michelle G.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,3,1,4.0,3/11/2015,Yes. Yes. Yes. Cheese cake heaven. I will have a slice of each please. Beautiful day in Baltimore Harbor Place. Pretty good service. My first visit here. Just had a salad with chicken and cranberries. For dessert a huge hunk of chocolate cheese cake. I will be back. Loving this weather.
Eric H.,"Bel Air, MD",2,12,10,1.0,11/15/2014,Average food.  Server sucked.  Manager really was no help.   Would not recommend Cheesecake Factory at the inner harbor.   Does not deserve 1 star.
Myles B.,"Nokomis, FL",20,33,29,5.0,10/13/2014,Went in at 11 pm for Saturday night cheesecake and coffee.  The server was charming and funny and kept our drinks filled.  She genuinely cared about the quality of service and our experience.  Being s tourist area we were skeptical about what to expect but the food and experience was amazing!
Nicole P.,"Richmond, VA",1,25,5,2.0,6/29/2014,"This place needs to do better. Came Saturday midday and for the amount of people waiting in line and out the hallway, the wait was only 20 min. Pretty good. However, I had to ask for different utensils once seated b/c ours looked dirty, and my meal had rubbery shrimp. I love seafood and I could only manage to eat one shrimp in my fettuccine Alfredo dish."
Brittany R.,"Ashburn, VA",38,5,,2.0,8/27/2013,The service was slow and there was a shirt tag on my sandwich.  I was not impressed for a restaurant on the harbor OR for a Cheesecake Factory restaurant.
Dawn R.,"Arnold, MD",149,592,109,4.0,3/21/2013,"I don't typically review chains, but since I did a check-in here, I guess I'll do this one.  I had actually just stopped in with a date for a late night drink and a shared piece of cheesecake.  It was around 9:30 when we got there on a Saturday night, and the place was packed.  We took a seat in the bar area right by the windows overlooking the harbor and were served pretty quickly.  Since I didn't order any ""real"" food, and since the cheesecake is always amazing, I'm giving them 4 stars.  I'm sure if I had ordered a meal it would be different, as I've been to several Cheeesecake Factory locations and the food is mediocre at best."
Doug W.,"Glen Burnie, MD",135,25,16,1.0,5/3/2014,Not impressed. This Is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Service was horrible. If you want Cheesecake Factory go to a different location.
Paul S.,"North Brunswick, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2/13/2015,"Service...ok.....food.....slow to come out and worst burger and fries I have ever had.  Not an exaggeration...I just joined yelp with the express purpose of warning others about this place. My wife and I both had the mushroom burger medium rare....wife's came out medium well and mine was crunchy...literally crunchy it was so over cooked.  About the size of a Burger King burger.  Fries were cold, stale and had a very acrid taste.  We were starving from being at Hopkins all day, so I ate half.  Server asked how the meal was and I just showed her the burger and said medium rare.  She offered to refire the order but I didn't want to wait , so she did offer a piece of cheesecake.   2 burger and fries and two iced teas...$34...I left a nice tip because the waitress did the right thing, but I had no faith in the cooks to pull it off."
Linda T.,"Seattle, WA",58,35,560,3.0,9/11/2012,"To begin with I am a fan of cheesecake factory due to their excellent food varieties and service! However, I am rating this restaurant just based off my brunch experience the time I visited here in Baltimore! I had the brunch couple times and it was only ok....the servers here weren't as attentive as compared to those in the west coast and/or maybe this is located in the busy Inner Harbor area due to a lot of tourists as well :( As for my food, I have ordered the traditional continental breakfast with ham and egg with hashbrown and toast. The egg was not made as per my order and the ham seemed a little overcooked :( Anyway, I will still remain a fan of  this joint but I guess not so much in the east coast lol."
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,1.0,6/4/2012,"What a disappointment. I'd initially dropped by to see if they sold tomato-bacon jam in jars as they do with some dressings and sauces, and thought I might grab some food too. The girl at the counter was so incredibly rude and condescending. Rather than clarifying and maybe asking what menu item it's served with or something, she acted like I was making the item up and instead of checking if they sold it or something, I was just told no and that was it. Her rudeness put me off so much I decided I wasn't about to buy anything there anyway, especially not food. I was surprised because I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and have never had bad service or had someone be rude, but I guess there's a first time for everything."
Kevin S.,"Ashburn, VA",120,703,414,3.0,11/26/2010,"In the past, I have not normally written reviews for chain restaurants unless they truly distinguished themselves as highly above (or below) average.  Then I saw how my rating statistics look skewed on Yelp, and I realized I need to file more of these ""average"" reviews so that you can tell when I give a 4 or 5 star rating, I mean it. In this case, The Cheesecake Factory was an enjoyable dinner and just about what we have come to expect from every Cheesecake Factory location across the country:  Nicely decorated, very busy, very noisy restaurant with excellent food.  It was a good meal and nice and convenient across the street from our hotel."
Paul B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,11,,3.0,1/15/2016,First called for a takeout order was told 20 minutes walked across the street to get it 25 minutes later . They have no order for me young lady at the bakery where I was told to pickup my order was very nice and apologetic but had to put my order in again meaning I had to wait another 20 min . The food was outstanding and I was grateful they had gluten free options but how do you lose an order  . Overall food and service were great but wasn't happy about having to wait again after loosing order .
Patricia J.,"Washington, DC",4,42,33,1.0,6/8/2014,"I am done with this location. Mice were running around, during 7 pm dinner seating, full restaurant. The manager came over and wanted to know if there was a problem,. Yes, half of my dinner party feet were on chairs and screaming, and nervous laughing, this is not normal for a eating establishment. It should be closed under they get that problem under freak in control!"
Ryel E.,"Arlington, VA",0,3,,2.0,1/3/2016,We went here last night and got seat around 30 min as she said but the thing is no one care about us after we seat and new couple came beside us directly served with water and bread. So pissed that my fiancé have to call a waiter for us. Will remember this and will never go there anymore.
Nikila D.,"Baltimore, MD",634,183,405,3.0,8/1/2012,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory on Otakon weekend, so all of us went in with our full cartoon/superhero/pop-culture costumes. Fortunately, half the restaurant was filled with Otakon-goers/tourists, so props to the staff for being accepting and accomodating about that! Our large group of around 12 came without a reservation and had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, which was expected of the weekend and of the chain. However, when we were seated, we realized that the air conditioning seemed to be broken. Keep in mind this is a Baltimore summer evening, with the temperature being around 95 degrees, and all of us are in full body costumes... not pleasant. There were no other restaurants that were less packed in the area though, so we just had to deal with it. Our waiter seemed very flustered by the whole situation, and it took a while for him to get all of our orders down while separating the checks. It also took quite some time for the water to come to our table, which, complemented with the lack of A/C, was not the best impression. However, the food slightly made up for our uncomfortable situation. I ordered the The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich, which is two fluffy buns encasing eggplant, peppers, onion, and cheese, with fries on the side. It was on point. And HUMONGOUS. I actually had trouble figuring out how to eat it initially. I could taste all of the vegetables' flavors distinctly, and the garlic aioli brought out all the strong flavors even more. All of my friends were really pleased with their courses as well. For dessert, my friend and I split a Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake, which was decent. I wasn't raving about it like my friends were about their cheesecakes, but it was a solid cake. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory location has great dinner dishes, good cheesecake, and mediocre service."
Latise B.,"Ellicott City, MD",43,80,20,3.0,8/4/2012,"I don't usually review chains, because you know what you are getting when you go to one, that's the whole point. Cheesecake factory is in general a 4 out of 5 chain for me. The food is pricey, but the portions are large. The desserts are tasty, and that is basically why anyone with a clue would go there. This location gets only a 3 because the service left a bit to be desired. We waited a long time to get drinks, a long time to order, and a long time for things we asked for once our food came. It was a typically crowded Sunday evening, so maybe that had something to do with it. No big deal, but worth noting nonetheless. If you like cheesecake factory, go to this one. It tastes like, um, food from the Cheesecake Factory. Just sayin. If you like buffalo chicken dip, try the Buffalo Zinger thingies. It is buffalo chicken dip that is Battered and deep fried. How can you even say no?!"
Stefan F.,"Berlin, Germany",1,88,59,5.0,6/15/2013,The Cheesecake Factory as you know it. You'll get it all but here you can enjoy a wonderful view across the famous and historic Baltimore Inner Harbor by the way. And of course they delight your day with creamy and rich cheesecakes.. Awesome!
Aly M.,"Issaquah, WA",28,295,320,4.0,1/9/2011,"Apparently this was not my first time here, but it was the first one I remembered.  We went not very hungry on New Year's Eve because we had a gift card to spend and we thought there would be a long wait.  Oops.  The wait was only 40 minutes (which matched the hostess' prediction exactly) which didn't help us get much hungrier. I didn't bother with the bread because it didn't look special.  We ordered some avocado eggroll appetizers that were recommended by our waitress, as well as the shrimp franchese and a BBQ salmon.  Of course we saved room for dessert--a dulce de leche cheesecake slice and the tuxedo cream one. Overall, I was impressed by the food (I was not expecting much since it was a chain).  The price is not too bad considering you get large portions.  The shrimp in my dish was cooked perfectly, even better than some supposedly nicer places.  The cheesecake tasted even better as leftovers because I was a little hungrier to enjoy it more. : ) Everyone was friendly and that made the evening even better."
