Lisa D.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,144,,3.0,12/11/2014,I never had a bad thing to say about this place.  C'mon it's the Cheesecake factory! So good! I ordered the lemon chicken picatta. So good! !! For a drink I got a martini first then I got a new drink which was a mojito. Both drinks were great. We were seated wothin 10 min.
Jessy G.,"Silver Spring, MD",62,9,15,2.0,1/8/2016,"The only reason Im giving it 2 stars its the food. Cajun Jambalaya and the cheesecakes are superb. I've been to the Cheesecake at The Groove in LA and to the one in Friendship Heights in DC many times and I know that there is always a wait. But my last experience at the Baltimore location was ridiculous. We waited 3 hours and 10 minutes. We didnt mind the first two hours because we walked around the harbor but 3 hours and 10 minutes is crazy. My friend was pregnant and we spoke to the manager 2 1/2 hours into the wait to see if  he could help because we didnt want her to wait any longer. He said he would try but nothing happened. We were finally seated 40 minutes after speaking to the manager and the waiter brought the utensils and bread. We then waited another 30 minutes for him to return to take our order. We got up and left, mad at myself for waiting that long. Definitely not going back."
Tiffani C.,"Fort Washington, MD",44,53,24,4.0,1/28/2013,"We were seated pretty fast for a Saturday afternoon.  Everyone in my party was very happy. The seafood gumbo, outstanding. The shrimp and bacon club. WONDERFUL, and the orange chicken was good (not great but good).   The cheesecakes ordered after did not disappoint once we were home.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and VERY attentive."
Pri P.,"Baltimore, MD",123,145,250,5.0,8/9/2012,I LOVE the chicken and seafood jambalaya. U can never go wrong with it!
Fang H.,"Grafton, MA",1,7,,2.0,8/23/2013,"After waiting twenty minutes for an outdoor table, we expected more than we actually got. Not worth the wait! The service made us rather uncomfortable. Our waiter pretended to be all kind and nice, but you could tell he didn't a crap about us. It got REALLY annoying.  The appetizers were alright, not the worst but certainly not the best. The entrees were extremely bland! The worst was the chicken marsala, which tasted like nothing. Each dish had large portions of plain rice or pasta with barely any gravy or sauce.  At the end of our meal, the waiter didn't even offer us a dessert. Remember, people, it's the CHEESECAKE (hint hint wink wink) Factory! It's either clumsy service or he wanted us out of there."
Mike S.,"King George, VA",1,9,9,1.0,8/2/2015,If you like the Cheesecake Factory don't go to this one because it's nothing like the others. The service and food were both horrible. We're pretty easy going but when my salad comes out with no salad dressing then I have to sit and look at it for 30 mins before a waitress finally brings it (no lie - i asked 4 different waitresses for dressing and each one told me they would be right back). My favorite part when we ordered 2 fried cheeses but after 15 minutes they let us know they were all sold out so we decided to do a small cheese pizza. After we almost finish our pizza .....HERE COMES THE TWO FRIED CHEESES! I said 'oh the other waitress said you all were sold out?' She then said 'we just had a delivery of new cheese.' It was 9:30 at night. We decided to take them even though we were pretty full but get what THERE WAS NO CHEESE INSIDE  I really hate to leave such a nasty review but after seeing everyone around us was having trouble it's definitely needed.
Aida M.,"Baltimore, MD",145,25,19,5.0,2/8/2014,"Another fabulous visit!! Dined during the dinner rush and was seated moments after arriving, not the projected 20 minute wait time. Every booth and table were occupied. I was promptly greeted by a familiar female server which was comforting. I was no longer parched as she immediately brought me water. She knew the menu and today's specials. The kitchen was very quick with dinner service. I was given hot bread and ample butter while I awaited my appetizer. My water glass was always topped off. She even bagged my training food when I was finished eating. I definitely will continue visiting this establishment!!!!"
Dorrie B.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",0,12,,2.0,10/5/2015,"Upon our arrival we called ahead to check if it was crowded they young lady stated it wasnt so we got there like five mins later and i know how it works ten people could walk in within the five mins so the hostess who was eating and had her mouth full of food (LOL) told us there is a 20 min wait which we were fine with she told us we could sit at the high top tables and wait and possibly be served there while we wait. So we sit at the table the server a young guy completly ignors up for a good 20 mins, he constantly walked by us and served other guest around us until finally, a person in my party of 3 calls him over and asks him for menus then he tries to be pleasant and ask us for our order at this time we are angry because of the long wait luckily our buzzer goes off and we are able to sit in the dinning area, i def was not happy with him being so careless about getting to us after 20 mins of waiting so we took a table. The server comes a young lady and asks for our drink order we all order the last person orders and as she is still talking the server walks away mid conversation! (rude much)? All i have to say is the customer service sucks here and i will never return im so disappointed"
Jeff L.,"Columbia, SC",0,16,1,5.0,10/3/2014,Ate here for lunch twice during my stay in July 2014. We waited only 10 mins on a Sunday and only a couple mins on Monday. No issues with service. The seating was a little too close to other guest but not a reason to stay away. I tried the orange chicken and rice and also a hamburger.  Both meals were excellent.
Chris A.,"Baldwinsville, NY",1,7,,2.0,7/29/2015,"Below average service. Food was as expected. We had a usual long wait, followed by a long wait for drinks, an unprofessional server that forgot our bread, screwed up my daughters order and never asked us if we needed another drink. Spent $100 for 4. Overpriced for a low level below average chain with poor service. Not to mention the location has a homeless population that panhandles openly to diners sitting outside. Nice touch!"
Taryn C.,"New York, NY",261,704,16,2.0,11/15/2011,"OVER-RAY-TED! Clap! Clap! CLAPCLAPCLAP! Don't get me wrong...I LOVE the cheesecakes at Cheesecake Factory. But that's just the point...the food there is just overrated, overpriced and overdone.  Overdone meaning - they only serve ""human"" sizes at lunch time??  You can barely walk with one of those meals. Anyway, I like this place because it's a nice little ""hey let's pick up dessert on way back to the hotel room"" kind of places...but I made the mistake of eating lunch here because I was disappointed that Phillip's wasn't open.  NEVER. AGAIN.  Strictly cheesecake to go after that one."
jon l.,"Baltimore, MD",8,146,48,5.0,11/29/2011,"I really love this restaurant because of their very extensive menu. They have breakfast all day and gourmet dishes that include something for everyone! Every item I have tried was delicious to the extreme. It is surely worth any wait.  The only problem could be the parking which is on the street or in the paid lot. If you are in Northern Baltimore, the Towson restaurant is an option too. The Cheesecake Factory is way more than just desert."
Leah G.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,15,1,1.0,10/27/2013,We normally love cheesecake but this location was horrible from the cleanliness to the food. We had to switch tables because of a certain smell. Then we get to the next table which has a dirty clean dish. The food was not an improvement. The same dishes we normally order at other locations were subpar here. The service was the only positive point even though they never refilled our drinks. Cheesecake corporate should embarrassed by this location. They are negatively affecting your brand.
Chris T.,"Missouri City, TX",16,119,30,2.0,10/16/2013,"My disclaimer: I absolutely LOVE The Chessecake factory & visit in every city! However, this location was just....okay. Our waitress was really nice but the rest of the staff ..not so much. Food was not up to par here either. Tasted overcooked. My friends thought their food was worse at this location as well. I guess being in the inner harbor they dont have to try as hard...Cheesecake was great tho :)"
Quentin C.,"Rocklin, CA",25,1,18,1.0,10/1/2013,"Inattentive staff from the concierge to the wait staff. Should have just left. Ordered the   Cajun Jambalaya. OMG, the noodles must have been cooked 30 minutes. The vegetables were mushy and the chicken and shrimp were boiled tasteless. I did not recognize this dish. Worst I have ever had. Never again. Don't ever order this here. Stick to Cheesecake after eating your main course somewhere elsewhere!"
Mike M.,"Chicago, IL",1,4,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Terrible service. Put in my kids order before ours without asking so we waited an additional 30 minutes for our meal. Servers and greeters seemed unhappy, even though the restaurant was not very busy. The food was acceptable. I will not be returning to this restaurant with so many other options in the area for dining."
Amanda L.,"Belcamp, MD",2,26,2,5.0,5/29/2014,"Everything was amazing! I love their Oreo dream cheesecake and their 4 cheese pasta! The wait wasn't bad either, which was pretty impressive in itself. The only thing I'd say could've been improved is the friendliness of the waitress, but other than that I loved it!"
Doug A.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,5,1,1.0,8/16/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this restaurant was very unpleasant.  Half the tables are empty and dirty, and there are more people waiting for a table than there are sitting down.  Service is slow and comes with an attitude.  There was clearly no respect for the customer.  Try your hand upstairs at the tapas place."
Gina L.,"Aurora, CO",101,32,13,3.0,3/22/2014,"I've usually found the Cheesecake Factory to be a fairly consistent and safe choice when traveling. Brought my parents here for lunch on a Friday. We stood at the hostess stand for at least 20 minutes. The hostess was just walking around, didn't even acknowledge us. All the other waiters avoided eye contact while we were there. Several other parties behind us were also being ignored.  After we FINALLY got our seats and were acknowledged, it took another twenty minutes to even get starter bread. The food was good, as usual, but all of the waiting on top of the dirty silverware (we're talking food crumbs still stuck in the fork) made it less than a safe choice."
Natalia K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,11,,2.0,8/14/2015,Not like used to be years ago! Food is garbage!! Service is awful! Poor management!! Always mess up our receipts!
