John S.,"Washington Square West, Philadelphia, PA",1,3,,5.0,8/13/2014,"Mardy brought an energy level that was unseen in the Baltimore harbor. Being a late night table that kept him later than usual did nothing to stunt his enthusiasm in hosting us on a late night desert. The cheesecake was excellent, and we had fresh hot coffee. But Mardy's excellent service was the highlight of our experience."
Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,435,3,4.0,2/24/2014,"To be honest, I didn't have very high expectations for dinner tonight, but I was actually pretty impressed! I ordered the everything pizza, which was delicious. It was really cheesy and had everything on it - pepperoni, sausage, onion, mushroom, peppers, and tomato sauce. The crust had the perfect amount of crisp. Also, the pizza was huge so I got to take home half of it! I had the regular tiramisu for dessert, which was tasty although it was very dense. I wonder if that might have been the cheesecake version that they accidentally brought out instead of the regular tiramisu. I tried a bite of the new Smores cheesecake, and I wasn't a huge fan. The marshmallow part was too solid. I tried a bite of the fried cheese (basically a mozzarella stick) appetizer, and it was amazing! The outside was perfectly fried and slightly crunchy. Our server was very nice and took great care of us!"
Frances L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1425,1184,462,2.0,7/26/2011,"I've never been fond of Cheesecake Factory. I avoid it, like most major chains, like the plague. However, when out and about with the boy's family, we got out-voted in the great local vs. ""trustworthy"" chain debate and we ended up here after a trip to the aquarium.  Children can be real picky eaters so we needed to go to a place with a childrens' menu. Luckily, their vast menu accommodated to our entire group. The kids were happy, the cocktails were pretty tasty, and everyone got to order what they were in the mood for. Service was good even though the place was packed on a Saturday evening, but ultimately the food was not very good.  While I can recommend their luxurious cheesecakes (I like the tiramisu cheesecake most), their food is severely lacking. My chicken picatta was oily, lacked flavor, and the chicken was dry. The boy's burger was pretty lackluster. After a long day of walking around however, their spiked raspberry lemonade did hit the spot."
Joe B.,"Freehold, NJ",361,564,28,3.0,10/3/2011,"Sometimes I like this place and other times I don't. This time i did, so I'm giving them 3 stars. Huge menu with pretty much every type of food covered. Portions are decent.  Maybe it's just the way people overhype this place that makes me dislike it sometimes. I will say it is NOT worth the 2 hour wait you can sometimes experience, but then again.....no place is!!"
A. C.,"Orlando, FL",135,1162,8681,4.0,10/22/2011,"An acquaintance used to say the Cheesecake Factory's portions offended him.  They do serve you a huge amount of food, and from a very extensive menu; ranges from diner to comfort to Asian-accented.  Our usual go-tos are the Avocado Eggrolls (deep fried and stuffed full with avocado chunks, sundried tomato, red onion, cilantro, with a great spicy, sweet-tangy tamarind-cashew dipping sauce) and the Thai Lettuce Wraps (chicken, bean sprouts, variety of dipping sauces, veg garnishes; crisp and fresh).  One could make a meal of just an app.      Really, though, can't come to a place called the CHEESECAKE Factory and not have the cheesecake.   Fave fun flavors:  Banana, Oreo, Chocolate Mousse, Key Lime, Pumpkin, could go on and on.  Have found the fruit flavors to be like fruit (not artificial) and the chocolate ones very decadent. Haven't tried a bad one yet (but then again, it is cheesecake, can't really go wrong).    The Inner Harbor location is mostly tourists/out-of-towners wandering in from nearby hotels and the Harbor.  The wait can be extremely long (as in, several hours), hostesses are just barely civil, and sometimes not even that.  Lighting is bright, when the sun is out, terrace-like rooms by the deck are nice."
Camille A.,"Baltimore, MD",66,250,14,3.0,9/27/2013,"its okay. the cheescake is wonderful, the staff eh not so much"
Hannah H.,"Boonsboro, MD",0,1,,2.0,7/30/2015,"Very unsatisfied with my last visit to Cheesecake Factory. My whole family had just arrived to Baltimore after a 6 hour car ride. It was a Friday night and it was very busy but we were happy to be seated within 20 minutes. While we were waiting the hostess asked if we needed a high chair for my cousins son, who is only 5 months and unable to sit up on his own. We declined and said we would take the stroller since he can't sit up yet. After being seated we placed the stroller beside our table. After the hostess saw the stroller she told us we needed to move it because it was in the way. We tried to explain that he couldn't sit by himself but she demanded we move it. My cousin got upset and left to go back to the hotel without eating at all. Very disappointed in the way things were handled and how rude the hostess was about the situation, despite telling her in advance we'd need the stroller. We would have gladly waited longer for a table where we could have had the baby by our table comfortably. Instead my family ate supper without 2 members joining us. Our service and food was great other than that, but it's hard to forget a bad experience given to you by the first person you see when you walk through the door."
Geoff A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",9,288,13,2.0,4/27/2012,"Not as good as I would have expected. Service: ABout the only reason this didn't get a lower rating. Friendly and helpful. Food: Odd tasting bread paired with overly rich and seasoned main course. Some of the appetizers looked okay, and that paired with a slice of the cheesecake might be a reason to go back but it wouldn't be my first choice. Price: Reasonable."
Jay T.,"Portland, OR",0,15,,5.0,7/20/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory has THE BEST pizza I have ever had. It was absolutely amazing. I have ordered the same pizza at different Cheesecake Factories and it's never near as good as the one I had here. If you are as huge a pizza lover as me, this is your dream pizza."
Brittany B.,"Gloucester City, NJ",0,3,,5.0,7/18/2015,"The best restaurant and service I've ever been to. I was in Baltimore on vacation and had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before and it was GREAT. I had a waiter named, ""Travell"" I hope I spelled his name correctly, and he was the best server I've ever had, very friendly and helpful. He went out of his way for us. The atmosphere being on the inner harbor was amazing and beautiful. Truly felt like a vacation. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good quality food and service and a view. When I come back to Baltimore, this will be where I am eating dinner. Love it!"
John W.,"Beaver, PA",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2015,"Absolutely the rudest staff I have ever encountered.  The only positive is that the place was open.  Sorry for trying to eat at your place of employment hostess, waitress and busser.  Consistently rude across the board."
Tom C.,"Woodbine, MD",0,4,,1.0,7/13/2014,"Normally decent, but last night was awful. Waited 40 min to get our food, both the chicken tacos and steak was cold and way over cooked. The bread came out 2 min before our dinner, waited for 10 min between drinks. The table next to us got their food and had to wait for the server to bring silverware 5 min later, and were served drinks in plastic cups. The table behind us got their bread but didnt have plates or silverware. After dinner we waited 15 min for cheesecake and 10 min to finally get the check. Just awful service will not likely go back to that location."
Peter C.,"Parkville, MD",1,17,,1.0,7/2/2014,"Wont give us the seats we want even though it wasn't reserved and also there was plenty of space for us to sit. Appetizer took forever, meals were eh, and no AC."
Bob H.,"Denver, CO",0,10,,1.0,6/13/2014,"Unfortunately after the interactions with the Cheesecake team at the Baltimore harbor Cheesecake Factory we left without eating.  15 to 20 minute wait promised, OK I understand that's an estimate but when you seat two groups of 4 & 6 who came in after our group of 4 I have a problem. Especially when I go up to ask what's going on and conveniently our table is next. The greeters had an attitude and were severely disorganized which we found out pretty soon was a product of John the manager who was rude enough to call us rude for asking for a particular table. After that response it was time to leave. Never had this issue at a Cheesecake anywhere in the US!"
Sonya N.,"Columbia, MD",0,5,,3.0,8/6/2013,"As always, delicious food, but mediocre service. Had to send food back because it was not cooked correctly (steak was well done when asked for med rare). They were not very gracious about it. Probably won't return."
Matthew S.,"Palmyra, NJ",25,1,,1.0,4/13/2015,Place is dirty. There was food stuck to the menus. And the bathroom was a disaster zone. Service was horrible. Treated like we were a nuisance by the hostess. The waitress disappeared from helping us for the longest time. We should have left as soon as we walked in. I dont recommend this Cheesecake Factory!  I wish i could give a half a star.
Samantha D.,"Staten Island, NY",5,12,2,5.0,3/7/2014,"Came from out of town but stuck to something I knew and I'm extremely pleased with my choice. All of the staff I encountered were pleasing and sweet. And most importantly, the food was as great as I expected. If I'm ever in town again, I'd definitely eat here"
Tania R.,"New York, NY",132,72,9,4.0,8/19/2011,"Visited here a few months ago, and liked the fact that they accommodated us graciously even though we came in the restaurant so late. Great food and good service, although they could have been less obvious with the staring [we were dressed in indian clothes after coming from an event at johns hopkins]. of course, we faced racism all over maryland, especially in the bethesda area, but i digress. Red velvet cheesecake was out of this world! The view from this restaurant is extremely beautiful as well, right by the water, and its quite a sight when its raining. Also pretty amusing  when we left- the restaurant was closing, and since it sort of part of a mall thing, we ended up locked inside and had to take practically a maze path to get out."
Kamilah B.,"Philadelphia, PA",51,192,109,5.0,1/27/2012,This place could never do wrong in my eyes! Love love love that CF.  The servers we have are always so nice (although I wish they wouldn't wear white).   I had the crabcake sandwhich w/ sweet potato fries.  It was very good.  My husband had the salmon and my sis had pasta.  They both enjoyed it. We stop here just about everytime we are in town!
I S.,"Aurora, Canada",3,36,,4.0,3/4/2013,Great place for a treat! I had their low carb cheesecake and coffee. It was DE-licious. We were seated at a wonderful table in their sunroom. It was very relaxing and enjoyable.
