Phillip W.,"Rockville, MD",1,8,6,2.0,7/14/2013,"The initial wait to get a table was not too bad, but then they seated us outside, where the tables are slippery plastic on a slope.  Logically, all the utensils tend to slip off the table.  My guess if they sacrificed  service(a lot) for more decent seating capacity. After getting seated, it was 45 minutes of waiting for our food, which we gave up and went to a local Chipotle instead, where we got our food right then and there. Bottom line is, this is not your typical Cheesecake Factory.  Expect poor service from this restaurant."
D S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,3,1,2.0,5/18/2015,I've been here a million times. I really only get two things. Miso salmon or crabcakes because I find that the other items just don't do it for me. I don't appreciate when chefs get lazy at the end of the night and send out cold food or do not serve what they are supposed to because they don't fill like making it. The last meal of the day should be just as good as the first meal of the day.
Arthur C.,"Rye, NY",3,26,,4.0,5/27/2011,"After sitting completed starved on an Amtrak train from NY, I finally arrived in Baltimore and needed food ASAP.  It was around 9:30pm when I arrived, and my bro recommended going here since they're open relatively late We were immediately seated and placed an order for Fried Calamari and Hummus.  Both came out quick and were great.  The Calamari was cook perfectly and came with a creamy dipping sauce and cocktail sauce (would have preferred marinara sauce).  The hummus was very good as well and came with warm pita slices.  Both generous portions Although the appetizers came out quick, the entrees were another story.  For some reason, they look FOREVER to come out.   My bro ordered the Chicken Parm Wedge which looked really great and he said tasted good.  It was huge, stacked with chicken cutlet.   I ordered a regular cheeseburger, cooked well done.  What a mistake.  I know it was supposed to be well done, but you really couldn't have cooked it more.  I don't think I've ever had a burger drier than that Overall, the food was pretty good.  I just think I ordered the wrong thing"
Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",316,296,76,4.0,3/10/2011,"Now I will start this by saying I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory pretty much all over the country as it's well received everywhere.  The Menu is consistent (which in my opinion is disappointing being that fresh in Miami isn't fresh in Baltimore and so on) so if you are away from home and not feeling adventurous, you can count on the Cheesecake Factory to deliver! I have been to the one in the Inner Harbor so many times I can't count but the place is always busy.  Which is a testament to the level of management and the quality of the head chef to keep the food consistent (there's that word again... ugh!) I'm a huge fan of the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll and the Miso Salmon myself but everyone has a go to dish at this joint. If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory before, go watch the latest GEICO commercial referencing the rock and 15% youl know the cliche..."
Lucy X.,"Washington, DC",56,226,302,4.0,2/18/2011,"You can't go wrong with an indulgence on any special occasion at Cheesecake. But be sure to come extra hungry, or you'll pretty much be sure that you'll end up walking out with leftovers. This particular one has outside seating with a lovely view of the harbor. So on a nice day, definitely recommend to sit outside. The portions are known to be HUGE. And it's not even an exaggeration. And as for the food, basically anything is good. Lotsa butter and lotsa taste, can't go wrong. My favorite entree by far would have to be the pasta jambalaya (popular dish) and the bang bang chicken is also very good (Asian, Thai taste). And as for appetizers, go for the avocado, or the sushi tempura. And finally for the cheesecake, definitely the red velvet! oh and for drinks, try the mango, it's delicious :) There goes your whole dinner, enjoy!"
David B.,"Parkville, Hartford, CT",0,10,1,4.0,3/1/2014,"I ate here at the cheese cake factory. The wait was over an hour but it was well worth it! Service with a smile, very efficient, and the food was delicious! I love drinks and I have to say the red raspberry martini is a must try!"
Kaleb A.,"College Park, MD",0,60,7,3.0,11/18/2013,"The food wasn't bad; however, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here (unless you're a cheesecake freak)."
Sidney L.,"Laurel, MD",17,4,8,4.0,3/10/2012,"This is the best cheesecake factory I've been to.  The food was great and the service was just as excellent, 20 min wait on a Saturday night. Crispy crab wontons were excellent. I had the feta Alfredo and chicken which was comparable to my favorite Italian restaurant. Our server Candice was awesome and made the experience great.  Only loses a star because we had to walk and it was cold and the music selection was not very good and was too loud but other than that, it was a great experience and I'll be back and looking for Candice to serve me and my family."
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, CA",631,1335,908,3.0,5/27/2011,We decided to have lunch at Cheesecake Factory and check out the harbor at the same time. We put our names down (party of 8) and were quoted 45 mins for a table. We left and walked around. After 15 mins we got a call back and the table was ready. Sweet. We were seated in the back patio and were taken care of quite nicely. I got the lunch size pasta dish and it was massive. Everyone' else's entrée was ginormous as well. I didn't fancy my pasta and took a few bites before I decided to throw in the towel. Best part of the meal was the cheesecake which I took togo. Red Velvet Cheesecake. Yum. Friendly and hospitable service. Quick to be seated. Bread and water filled. Portions were massive. Food quality was meh. I didn't expect 5 star quality food but I expected it to be edible and tasty.
N W.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",28,14,3,2.0,3/8/2015,"I have never written a review before, but I had to write this one. The food was absolutely awful. I hosted a dinner party for a group of 9 people plus my 4 year old son last night to celebrate my daughter's college graduation. The noodles on the jambalaya were clumped together in one heap, the orange chicken tasted like chicken dipped in syrup, everything was awful. We should have sent all 9 dishes back. THey charged an 18% gratuity because I ordered a chocolate milk for my son and they considered him the 10th person requiring a mandatory 18%. He didn't eat anything, nor did I order him a meal. I don't mind tipping if I get great service but the service was mediocre. We got three pieces of bread for 9 people and had to request more. My water glass was never refilled. I didn't realize everyone else hated their food or I would have complained and sent it all back. I told the waiter the food was awful and he said ""I'll tell the Chef"". I didn't want to make a scene so I was quiet. We spent about $300 on frozen tv dinners. I will call today to complain. I usually enjoy the food, they give large portions and I have never been disappointed. The restaurant wasn't very full because it was a Thursday evening. I must have got the cook on a very bad night. They gave me a partial refund."
Evan F.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,84,17,5.0,5/28/2013,"I was really pleased with this Cheesecake Factory located right on the water of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. I've been to this chain many times, always leaving satisfied, and this time was another for the books! Our server was pleasant and attended to us frequently. The dinners and desert were just as great! I had the Skinnylicious Factory Chopped Salad and my friend had the Skinnylicious Grilled Turkey Burger. We were both really happy with our orders. For desert, we tried the Oreo cheesecake (and couldn't finish it as much as we tried). Definitely check this place out for both the food and service! Oh, and insist on being seated on the patio overlooking the Harbor if it's nice out!"
Gene L.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",53,144,31,3.0,4/30/2013,"Typical cheesecake factory with mediocre food and long waits. Many tourists go here, as it is right at the inner harbor. Good to go to with large groups who all have different food preferences. Heard their happy hour was pretty decent, but you have to be at the bar to get those deals; and the bar area is very tiny and always crowded."
Julia F.,"Slatington, PA",1,32,2,2.0,6/29/2014,"ok well I can say this place was packed. this was the first time ive ever been here, having heard good things. service was ok. my friend ordered sliders, loaded tater tots, and I ordered the tex mex egg rolls. when they brought the food they brought the wrong appetizer, instead of the tots we got some kind of ahi dish, which we sent back, and didn't get our tots until we were almost finished. the food was pretty good. I liked my egg rolls, it was filling, nice presentation. all fine and good at this point. but then the check came.. and on it was the ahi dish. so we told the server, who took it off. so our bill went from 38 to 30 and change. friend hands over a $40 gift card. it comes back as only having an extra 3+ bucks as a balance, which was weird but hey, maybe there was some kind of gift card fee. so we leave her the rest of the card as the tip, and I put an extra 2 bucks on the table. she goes home and checks, and somehow someone has authorized 36 and change to be put on the card.. which is why it was showing a 3+ dollar balance. not 30, not 38.. but an extra 6 bucks, and cleaned out the rest of the card with the tip. and got cash too. fortunately it was a gift card, and only a matter of 5-10 bucks.. buuuuuuut if this happens often, nightly, maybe with bigger checks and other credit cards.. thats a problem. there is a survey on the receipt, and she gets $10 for filling it out, so she gets her money back there. theres also a line up top that says ""separate checks"", making us wonder if she rang up a separate one to clear the card. I don't know. ive never been ripped off at a restaurant, so this is a first for me. **update.. friend did the online survey to talk about this issue, and get her $10 egift card.. they sent her an email back saying thank you for participating in the survey, your gift is enclosed. that's it. no attachment to get to the $10, no link, no nothing. good job guys. thanks for the memorable first time experience here, I don't think ill ever return to any in this chain. **2nd update.. customer service has gotten in touch, maybe they can work on the problem now. **3rd update.. my friends card was charged the correct amount about 2 weeks later."
Craig C.,"Jersey City, NJ",130,310,97,5.0,3/14/2011,"My girlfriend and I ate here our first night of our 4 day visit to Baltimore. The food was great, and the server was very nice and real and actually conversed with us a little bit instead of the normal server talk. The food was great. I got the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and my girlfriend got the Pulled Pork Sandwich and we both loved our meals. We couldn't conquer one of their massive desserts this time, but we will definitely go back."
Rebecca G.,"Syracuse, NY",19,79,98,4.0,2/27/2013,"I went in on a quiet, rainy, weeknight and got seated right away. My server was attentive. This was my first visit (I will definitely go back). They have a huge menu (of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts). I tried two delicious appetizers - avocado egg roll and fried macaroni and cheese. Both very tasty and a generous portion to be able to share with a friend or two. The fried macaroni and cheese is a heart attack on a plate, but worth trying once as it was yummy.  Next time I will try an entree and a piece of cheesecake."
Sarah R.,"Redford, MI",60,201,87,4.0,3/18/2011,"I don't know why people blame McDonald's for making America fat when they should blame The Cheesecake Factory.  Seriousy,the portions are ginormous - WAY too much for one person, usually.  In fact, I've never had cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory because I'm usually too stuffed to muscle one down. I love the Buffalo Blasts - chicken with cheese and buffalo sauce deep fried in a wonton wrapper - hello!  I've even made them at home since there's no CF in Michigan.  Most recently I had the Asian chicken salad.  It was nice and light and had decent flavor.  Our water at the Baltimore location was great.  There were six of us and he didn't write any orders down, yet got them all right.  Now that's a good waiter!"
Robbyn Z.,"Havre de Grace, MD",26,19,,5.0,8/19/2012,"First time at The Cheesecake Factory. They said there was a 40 minute wait, but it was more like 20. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the food was plentiful and delicious. I could' t finish the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. There is so much to choose from, and saving room for dessert is difficult, because it all tastes great."
Glenn S.,"Baltimore, MD",9,168,,4.0,4/19/2013,Ate here for lunch the other day with a group of about 15. We were seated quickly and drinks were taken promptly after sitting. Our waitress was very friendly and was quick with everything. I ordered the fish and chips lunch size with calamari to split with my co worker. The calamari was perfect as were the fish and chips. The slaw and fries that came with it were really good too. I didn't have time to get cheesecake this time around but I will definitely be back.
Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3263,2340,17973,4.0,5/8/2008,"This was the first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory. Right by the harbor, this location was packed full of tourists (myself included), so we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. (Reservations weren't, and still aren't, accepted.) All of our entrees were huge, and we took home bulging doggy bags. Their rendition of pad thai (which many of us ordered) was the bees knees, and not even spicy! Good stuff. I tried their Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, which was flavorful. Pleasing decor, stellar service (better than any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to), and delicious fare. Not the cheapest, and they're a chain, but worth a visit if you've never been."
ed e.,"Nassau, NY",0,87,1,2.0,8/12/2014,"Typical Cheesecake Factory food at this location, but by far the dirtiest and worst service of the ones I have experienced. ""Over touristed"" so the staff seem to reflect no desire to overachieve. This place was dirty and had a nasty musty odor in certain areas. The floor was so greasy it was dangerous. Add a rainy wet day to the equation and you can slide on the floor to you table. Real gross. Real smelly. Real dirty"
