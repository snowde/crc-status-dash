Dera S.,"PALMER, AK",0,19,,1.0,5/7/2012,"We just ate at the Cheesecake Factory at the Baltimore Inner Harbor.  It was a very depressing, disappointing experience.  The cleanliness of this restaurant would make Gordon Ramsey lose his lunch repeatedly.  Nearly every dish and piece of silverware had some sort of disgusting food caked on it.  My water glass had something big and green stuck to the side (not resembling lettuce... more like a boogie...needless to say I didn't drink any water).  Each fork and knife was crusty with some sort of nastiness.  Very unappetizing.   The food was mediocre at best.  I ordered the crap and artichoke dip, and it had imitation crab in it!  No real crab!  Pathetic for a restaurant on the Baltimore Inner Harbor.  I can't imagine we will ever return to any Cheesecake Factory, but there's no way in hell will we ever return to this particular one."
Np ..,"Temple Hills, MD",4,32,2,2.0,4/13/2013,"Beautiful View, Great Location, Nice Size, I ordered steak (med rare) w/ fries. The steak was absolutely terrible. They probably mixed it up with one of those Baltimore Rats lmaooo. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. The fries were the only thing that saved the meal. I was so turned off, will not be back."
Donald P.,"Washington, DC",273,1298,1430,5.0,9/10/2010,"If the weather is nice, EAT OUTSIDE. Beautiful view of the harbor is worth every penny of your meal. Otherwise it's your typical Cheescake Factory food. I admit too many people/tourist can detract from the experience, but that goes for just about anything. 5 stars for the location, good food, and good waitstaff."
Jessica T.,"Occoquan, VA",47,20,2,2.0,3/23/2011,We went during one of the first warm weekends of the year and the wait was unexceptionally long. For 6 people we waited 1 hour and then were sat in a booth that only allowed for 1 highchair when we clearly asked for 2 when booking the table.  After our extremely busy server took our order we waited an additional 2 hours for our food. Mind you she brought us complimentary salads and offered other things to us. The kitchen was completely backed up and since we were sitting close enough we could hear every one (expediter mostly) yelling about every order. Plates were breaking left and right and other groups of people were getting food and desserts in the time it took us to get a first course.  The food was not up to Cheesecake Factory par maybe due to the influx of customers but I wasn't impressed with any of my food HOWEVER my sister got the Petit Filet and it was fantastic. I am sure after trying that nothing seemed up to par.  The overall experience wasn't what I expected to have while treating my sister to a fun time in Baltimore.
Thomas S.,"Linwood, NJ",0,14,,3.0,6/11/2012,"A+ for Avocado spring rolls. They were slammin'. One of the best appetizers I have ever had. We were here for lunch after walking around the harbor and shopping. We wanted to sit outside so that is what we did. One thing I could not understand is why they only had about 8 umbrellas for 20 tables. It was hot and sunny and we had to wait for another table to get up in order to have an umbrella. Just something I thought was off. We had ok service, but the food was great and the location couldnt be beat. I would go back."
Elaine T.,"Mt Airy, MD",9,104,,3.0,1/30/2012,"This place is a study in excess.  The menu is something like 25 pages, no lie, and the first 4-6 pages are JUST drinks and appetizers.   I don't know... that just seems a bit too much to me.  haha.  Anyhoo, that said, Southwest taco eggrolls (us) & fried mozz (kids) were pretty good apps.  My fish taco entree was huge but extremely bland, and the tostada wraps were too greasy to eat - can't recommend this dish at all.  His shrimp/steak combo was delicious, I was envious!   Best thing about the meal was our server, Jennifer (""J"") -- she was so nice and had the knack of being quick & efficient without ever making us feel rushed even though, of course, the place was mobbed.   We got 2 slices of cheesecake to-go, Hersheys and tiramisu, which we divvied up at home -- super indulgent and more than enough to go around."
Tanya C.,"Abingdon, MD",376,813,13,2.0,8/10/2010,"This was my first time to the cheesecake factory and I don't know what the fuss is all about. I had a steak (steak diane, i think) and my bf had a steak which came with fries and 2 onion rings. Mine was not well seasoned and the potatoes were bland. My bf liked his steak but he said that it tasted like a salt block. The place is crowded, the portions are huge, but the food is eh. Its location is nice, so I might give it another shot."
Jeffrey S.,"Brenham, TX",17,368,77,5.0,10/9/2012,Tuna Tartar and Vietnamese tacos are all I need. Perfection.
Jesty Ken G.,"Arlington, VA",12,9,14,4.0,4/18/2011,"It was a long day spending vacation time with the family here in B-more. I enjoyed myself, but after 5 hours of walking in malls and the aquarium across the street, my stomach roared some hunger messages. So we decided to go here for dinner. Oy, the family didn't realize that getting a table on a Friday night is going to take forever, especially if there are 8 of us with a baby on board. So we waited for 2 and a half hours for a table, which was on par with what the hostesses up front quoted us for. So that was impressive. We got to our table, nice scenic area viewing the harbor. But it was chilly... I definitely felt the draft coming from the windows. They might need to patch that up. That was my only problem tonight, else it would be a fiver review. Had a Passion Fruit Mojito since I wanted something sweet that night. And it was presented nicely: not too sweet, which is awesome and had a nice garnish that complimented the drink. Made my night. Had their special shrimp app that our server told us about. It was alright, didn't really wow me, but had my cousin's avocado rolls and it was great! Sauce that came with the rolls was so tasty! Highlight of the night was the Ahi Tuna plate with rice cooked medium rare. For 22 bucks, it was totally worth it! It was such a portion, if I wasn't so hungry I would have saved some for home. But every bite of that fish, mixed with the white rice and sauce was too delicious. I recommend this plate, no doubt. Too full to endure any more, I decided to take the dessert home. It was the red velvet cake double layered between a modest layer of cheesecake with whip. It was just as amazing as it sounds. The place had the usual yet nice ambience with their other restaurants and it's nice. Our server (believe it was Alexandre?) was attentive and kept the table refilled and bussed. The fam was happy and so was I. Great experience!"
Syreeta B.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",134,182,204,5.0,3/17/2012,"Who doesn't  love TCCF! If the desserts alone don't win you over there menu for all walks of life will. They have something for everybody. There menu looks like a lamented magazine, with advertisements and all. Service is always great no matter which ""factory"" I go to. Good food,good service,great prices"
Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,4.0,10/22/2011,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner last weekend while visiting Inner Harbor.  We knew there would be a wait for a table, as it's always crowded, so we arrived around 5:30, and were given a beeper and told there would be around a half hour wait.  The beeper worked throughout the whole pavilion, which was nice, so we could browse in the stores while waiting.  We wound up waiting about 35 minutes and were seated in a small booth.  Our waiter was attentive, and brought over huge drinks and bread right away.  I love their bread selection.  My boyfriend decided on the Teriyaki Chicken and he really enjoyed it.  I loved my Tomato, Basil and Cheese Pizza, and it was definitely enough for two meals.  The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants and this one did not disappoint."
Gordon T.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,105,,4.0,5/12/2013,"So much yes! Its very good and the waiter was perfect. However the wait was pretty long, went on a Saturday (so probably my fault). It was worth the wait, and the desert was just beyond amazing...I got a regular cheesecake....I died a little on the inside it was so good. :D"
Lemon C.,"Washington, DC",101,678,157,4.0,11/27/2009,"I know in Baltimore you should eat in Little Italy, but I searched the top restaurants here on Yelp, then went to the restaurants websites (why do so many have music on them?) and saw their menus were nothing special, they were all basically the pick your pasta/pick your sauce kind of places. Nothing inventive about the dishes. So at 2:30 went to Cheesecake factory, and even though there were a ton of people waiting outside for Unos, no line for Cheesecake Factory. On top of their regular menu, they gave us a special menu.  Also at lunch time there are lunch size portions that cost less. Those portions are still huge. We were seated near the outdoor patio that now had a plastic covering which means it was quite cold inside! Here's what we had: Avocado Eggrolls - I know everyone raves about them so we tried it. The eggroll was so deep fried it was crunchy and tasted like pork, must have shared the same oil as something else. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - best thing ever! Thai Chicken Pasta - it was good, think Thai peanut noodles, however this was served with so much liquid it was almost a soup then topped with Fresh Bean Sprouts. I love bean sprouts but they should be cooked, not raw!  Also if I order the Thai Chicken Pasta without chicken, why did the waiter bring my plate and say ""Thai Chicken Pasta without the chicken""? Shouldn't it just be Thai pasta?"
Tracy O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,6,,1.0,8/27/2015,"In town for a family friends surgery and after a long day at the hospital we figured we'd go with a tried and true spot for dinner. This was after these same friends had a horrible dining experience 2 nights before. Of course with the consistency of the service, food and atmosphere throughout the US, we took it as a one off bad experience. We should have stopped when we were ahead. This was THE worst dining experience the 3 of us have ever encountered. From no plates or silverware when the app came, to waiting forever for food to only be cold, overcooked and drowning in sauces or water. The manager was less than apologetic but perhaps he's numb to the complaints by now. Another issue was that the homeless folks and folks walking by just stroll in to use the restrooms and it was so filthy I wouldn't have let my dog walk in without a hazmat suit on. I suggest this location either close up shop or Corporate turn this place around stat. They probably give away more cheesecake than they sell just for ""make good"" on the lousy food and service. It's a shame."
Josh G.,"Los Angeles, CA",612,589,1,1.0,10/5/2009,Tasteless components. Broken-down assembly line. Factory from hell.
Ron S.,"Scranton, PA",21,45,28,1.0,8/16/2012,"Really disappointed.  Although, what did I really expect.  Food was overcooked.  Drinks were weak.  Service left something to be desired and the table was not clean.  After sitting at the table for a little bit, we noticed pigeon poop on the table (we had to sit outside because they were so crowded).  But the cheesecake was good!  We will definitely not be returning to The Cheesecake Factory.  With so many other great restaurants in the Inner Harbor (or within a few blocks), why would you go to a chain anyway?  I would suggest finding somewhere else to eat."
Chris A.,"Hanover, MD",61,4,,2.0,8/13/2014,"Very disappointed!  I recommended this place to visiting family members.  Unfortunately, they had a bad experience with the staff.  It took more than 40 minutes to get seated.  Several others were seated who arrived after my family members.  When asked, the hostess stated that she buzzed them and they didn't respond.  My family members explained that were seated in the waiting area the whole time and were never buzzed or called upon.  Instead of trying to make it right, the three ladies at the front desk gave attitudes.  I understand that you might not care if you lose one customer, but you should still try to treat people with common courtesy."
Abe L.,"Baltimore, MD",93,176,63,4.0,4/6/2012,"This place has a great location with a view of the Inner Harbor and outdoor seating.  Lines get long - but the bar area has plenty of tables for parties of up to (4) with self-seating and a full menu.  As with every CF, the menu has great variety and tons of options.  Favorites include Fish tacos (tempura battered), Chicken Madeira, Pad Thai, Salmon Firecracker Rolls, Fried Mac & Cheese,  and the Popcorn shrimp.  Service is usually attentive and friendly.  Just be aware there is almost ALWAYS a wait, regardless of what day or time you go."
Jim B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",87,40,2,5.0,8/12/2012,"Great service and phenomenal food. We had 6 different cheesecakes. Favorite was the Kahlua Coffee. Also has Oreo, Hershey's, Coconut, Carmel Turtle, and Reese's. All were to die for. As far as dinner, had the Carmel chicken which was a hit at our table."
Mike F.,"New Haven, CT",25,75,89,3.0,4/1/2012,First time at the Baltimore harbor location. Busy but not overwhelming for a Friday night. Our server was fantastic.... Some of the other staff could take example instead of giving each other massages on the dinner floor.  Great drinks at the bar.  Dessert as advertised!!!
