B T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,59,1,5.0,11/26/2012,"Two words, CORN TAMALE! That's all. The corn tamale is so so good, I couldn't put my fork down, it's like I couldn't stop eating. I had all these exciting tastes going on in my mouth...so so delicious. I don't normally take a doggy bag home but if I had left any of the Corn Tamale on my plate I would have them box it up and brought it home with me. It was so unexpectedly good. I thought because it had so much going on that the flavors would not work, I couldn't be more wrong. To my surprise it was very very very tasty and became my favorite dish from this restaurant."
Nick F.,"Camp Hill, PA",118,4,,1.0,6/10/2014,"My tip is to not enter this establishment. I was disgusted with the service, food, and supervision. This particular Cheesecake Factory location is an egregious misrepresentation of the Cheesecake Factory name. I have dined at many other Cheesecake Factory locations and have been more than satisfied. My server lacked any personality or interest in making it an enjoyable dining experience. In fact, she was so disinterested, almost every item we ordered was incorrect. Another few things I was less than impressed with aside from the service were the plastic cups our water was served in, and the red lipstick smeared all around my wine glass. I believe I ordered Pinot noir, not Pinot noir with a side of rouge lipstick. I understand mistakes happen in the restaurant industry, but it comes to a point where it is unacceptable. The manager was far less than understanding and sympathetic. In fact, he defended the server and said he would not allow another server to take our inadequate server's duty to our table. After speaking with the manager it is clear to me why the servers have no pride in their work, there is no example to follow and no accountability."
Shelby N.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,55,,3.0,7/30/2011,"OK so the main reason the cheesecake factory doesn't get a 4 or 5 stars from me, is simply because I prefer consistency when it comes to my food. I deem a establishment my favorite place why? because it gets it right time after time. The cheesecake factory sadly doesn't get it right for me consistently enough. First off no matter what time of day you, there will almost always be a wait. And that said wait can go anywhere from 5 minutes to a hour and a half and sadly they don't take reservations over the phone, so there is no calling in advance to hold a seat or to even put your name on the waiting list in advance. The ambiance is always warm and welcoming but there are two things that i don't quite like: 1) In the summertime, its basically a green house and unless you have a seat at the high tables by the bar, than you will be using your menus as a fan throughout your entire meal. 2) If you go in the winter than you will be wearing your jackets the entire time because you will be freezing. But I digress. oh yea that's right the food: Ok so to me the menu isn't anything special. Their ""Glam Burgers are meh- But their bread and butter is really good and I find myself not even ordering appetizers because the bread is soo tasty. Their pasta is pretty good. I normally get the shrimp fettuccine which is awesome and if your lucky enough to have one of their HOT male waiters than you'll even get the pleasure of having them personally hand grade the Parmesan onto your plate for you. And this doesn't really add or subtract from their overall rating to me, Buuuutt....I kinda have this thing where I like to have my food look presentable when it arrives. it kinda gives my food character. And there are a few dishes that they have that are presented in a beautiful way. But sadly a lot of the dishes come out looking like some slop that the angry lady from the high school lunch line through on your plate. I mean I don't think maybe adding a small garnish on the side of my Chicken Di Pana is asking to much. Especially considering I paid like 15 bucks for it!!! The alcohol is a hit or miss depending on who made your drink. overall, this place is nice to meet up with friends and have a good dinner and some drinks, every now and than, but I personally would recommend venturing over across the street to the P.F Chang's restaurant (their calamari is out of this world)."
Amanda E.,"Alexandria, VA",99,282,137,3.0,1/5/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is - gigantic menu, gigantic portions. Good for groups with disparate tastes and cravings.  This review is mainly for the service. On a mild Saturday afternoon where the restaurant was teeming with tourists, our server was on point. She gets four stars all by her lonesome. If you have at least six people and can't decide on an app, your only option should be the Factory Appetizer Favorites (creative name, I know). Don't believe the ""Four"" in the serves four or more suggestion. If it's for four, that's your meal.  Three servers came out with four separate plates piled with yummy goodness that is made of Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls (shrimp), Quesadilla (just cheese), Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts and Calamari.  The three year old at our table ordered fried mac and cheese. The adults ate most of it. Not because we're mean, but because it rocked. They were huge balls of ziti in a white cheddar cheese (not elbows and yellow cheese like I expected) fried and placed in a tomato (slightly creamy) sauce. Wow they're good.  If you're here, you're likely on vacation. Anywhere you go will be a substantial wait on a nice day. So grab a slice of cheesecake from the takeout bar and wait patiently."
David B.,"Bowie, MD",14,30,8,4.0,6/26/2011,Bucket list.....order everything off the memo before I die....lol
Keon D.,"Alexandria, VA",456,318,84,3.0,2/6/2009,"Food is fine Cheesecake is great Really is overrated You ever have someone tell you something and you know it's true.. but yet for some reason you just can't take their advice and believe them? You know, you just HAVE to see again for yourself. Even though you know they are right.... Well that's the cheesecake factory. I totally knew this place was overrated but somehow because the line and the wait is always so ridiculously long I thought hmm.. it must be good since so many people are out here waiting. For once the wait wasnt in the hours.. and it was in the half hour- fifty minute range so i decided I was finally going to actually be able to eat here. The food I got was good, but definitely not blow me away good. I cant complain cause the food is pretty cheap actually. It's just after that I ate here I couldnt understand why people wait so long for this.. The cheesecake is amazing though. I will have to admit that. It rocks! I'd consider tacking on another star except I was seated in the dark (the lights above me blew out) and next to the window where it was actually quite freaking cold. I dont know if the part I was in was originally part of the building I just know it was dark and cold.. and I was kinda like wtf? At least the server was friendly."
Clarice K.,"Wailuku, HI",7,91,2,5.0,9/18/2011,Our first night in town we decide to come here. We started with onion rings which was the best I ever had. I had steak diane which was excellent.  Our sever was really great. So happy that we came here!
Jackie B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,32,4,5.0,3/9/2012,"We came during happy hour & ate their chicken lettuce wrap tacos, one of the healthier choices on the menu.  The Asian-style wrap was AMAZING.  You get 3 decent sized tacos for only $6, and the presentation looks like a $30 plate.  Their menu is incredibly vast & can satisfy any palate.  Our server Matthew was very nice and made sure we always had what we needed even though it was pretty busy at this location.    It was the best service we have had in a while. Gorgeous view, great food, good job CF!"
Jim B.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,4,,4.0,6/11/2012,"Went here for a lunch on a busy day when the Philadelphia Phillies fans were in town. Requested a seat outside, and was told the wait was 50 minutes. Not a problem, the bar had some seats available to pass the time. My only complaint for this establishment occured then - their draft beer selection is very minimal. After a few rounds of beers, our buzzer started vibrating and we were then escorted to our table, a perfect seat overlooking the water. Just like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the food on this day was very good and consistent with everything else I've eaten at this chain restaurant. Our server, Dominic, was perfectly attentive and had a great combination of professionalism and humor. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the harbor who's looking for a bite to eat."
John P.,"Fairfax, VA",1,81,,1.0,8/1/2012,"The waiter was extremely rude.  It seemed like she didn't fell like working that day.  I needed a refill and it took the waiter about half an hour to get a refill.  She only had the white bread while the others waiters in the  restaurant had the other kind too. The food was good but, I just hope she isn't here the next time I come here."
Matthew L.,"Baltimore, MD",990,726,161,2.0,4/15/2009,"Again I rate the chains against other branches and restaurants in general.  The inner harbour Cheesecake is probably the worst I've been too.  It's over crowded (because of the harbour), smaller than most and dirtier.  The bar, or lack there of it makes it impossible to wait in peace.  You always feel rushed here like there is another customer waiting.  If you go in the summer in the afternoon and sit outside it's a bit better.  They do make some great salads here, but the sandwiches always are small and rushed."
Falan E.,"Rocky Mt, NC",10,18,6,2.0,8/7/2011,"I enjoyed the food at this Cheesecake location, but the waiter did not do a good job serving our table. She was delayed in taking our orders, filling our glasses and serving our food. After finishing we waited 10-15 minutes to order desert. We took our desert out in takeout trays which took another 15 minutes to receive.  I'm not sure if she was new or still in training. I do know that it was very pack on this day..... Either way that does not justify how my guest and I were treated. I visited this restaurant mid Feb 2011. I would go again just because the food was great, but if I am served by another waiter like this one I will let the manager know. We all know that the wait times to eat at The Cheesecake Factory is always 1 hour plus unless you're eating at the bar. Our wait time was approximately 1 hour and a half. After the long wait you would think the service would've been better."
Nathan W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,9,,4.0,2/16/2013,"Very nice setting, roomy, view of the harbor. We were seated promptly by friendly staff. You can see the kitchens and people working in them (always nice). The food was surprisingly good and the menu much larger than I remember, this restaurant has come a long ways since I last visited it 5 years ago. As always, the cheesecake was amazing, my wife loves the red velvet. While not a local restaurant, its still our favorite place to eat in the Harbor."
Jenny S.,"London, KY",40,37,2,4.0,8/21/2011,"Come for the cheesecake that's all I can say LOL.  The cheesecake did not disappoint!  Got the Godiva styled one, very tasty coming back from a long walk back to my hotel room.  The menu is pricey, but it is off the harbor.  Expect a long wait on weekends."
Nathan J.,"Brooklyn, MD",5,4,,1.0,10/18/2012,Food was awesome but service was extremely inattentive which ruined the whole experience.
E M.,"Richardson, TX",0,153,93,4.0,10/5/2013,I like the location and food quality has been consistent as one expects from a chain restaurant.
John M.,"Baltimore, MD",1,1,,4.0,1/4/2014,Cheesecake Factory has always been a safe choice for me when I want a good meal in a nice restaurant setting. The prices are reasonable and the dishes are of good portion. This particular restaurant has a great location looking over the Baltimore harbor. My Fiance and I both ordered the Factory Burrito Grande which has always been a good choice for me. It's a good price for a lot of food. I usually don't finish it and save it for left overs. Two meals for the price of one. Not bad. The waitress we had wasn't intrusive and made sure we were taken care of. For desert we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It was very good but very rich as to be expected. The portion was big enough for the two of us to share. Overall it was a good meal in a nice location. I would definitely recommend it 4/5.
Mimi C.,"New York, NY",59,142,4,3.0,2/13/2009,"Our party of six arrived a little before noon and were seated immediately in a booth. The natural light from the windows was really nice. The bread basket was warm and fresh.  From reading Dana B.'s review, I tried the herb encrusted salmon. I enjoyed it but I'd probably explore something else on their extensive menu. My salmon came with a few asparagus and buttery mashed potatoes. The visual was interesting and Cheesecake Factory huge. Eating half of my meal was enough and I didn't even look at the dessert menu which is a bit sad when going to a place with cheesecake in its name.  Service seems spotty. Our waitress was fine but I thought her appearances were rare. The restaurant seemed busy, but not completely full that she couldn't check up more frequently. Some friends ate lunch there the same day and received vouchers for get a free slice of cheesecake with $30 meal which I'm guessing our waitress forgot."
Danielle B.,"Middle River, MD",0,2,,4.0,12/26/2013,I ate here with my family of 14 it was a decent wait time the restaurant made the proper adjustments for a large party. The snicker cheesecake is to die for and the meal portions are an excellent size. Great environment for families with young children my kids loved the chicken tenders and the crab dip. The service was nice but the waitress took a long time to come back with drinks but I will definitely eat here again.
Frank O.,"Woodbridge, VA",480,204,19,4.0,8/1/2010,"We came back here again last night since we were up in Baltimore for the soccer game over at M&T Bank Stadium.  It's a good Cheesecake Factory... the service is prompt and the dishes are what you expect from the chain.  Unfortunately you do have that hour long wait as you do at many of the CF restaurants in this greater area... but you just come to expect that.  No complaints...it is what it is, and it's a decent place as far as chain restaurants go."
