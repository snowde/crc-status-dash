Emma W.,"Selbyville, DE",0,10,,5.0,12/7/2013,Beautiful view of of Inner Harbor! Food is great! Only problem is you need to get there early if you don't want a long wait for a table! Overall I love this place!!
Dana B.,"Philadelphia, PA",324,852,,5.0,12/27/2008,"This particular location was the very first Cheesecake Factory at which I had ever eaten.  Towards the end of my sophomore year of high school, the entire sophomore class took a day trip to Washington D.C. and the bus dropped us off at the Baltimore  Inner Harbor for dinner on the way back to school.  I had heard wonderful things about the Cheesecake Factory, so I was looking forward to eating there on the way back from this trip.  A few friends and I grabbed a table, and from what I remember, the wait was not long at all even though the Cheesecake Factory, no matter what part of the states you're in, has a reputation for being very crowded, especially on weekends, with at  least an hour-long wait. That being said, it was completely and totally worth it.  I got the herb encrusted  salmon, which came with mashed potatoes and some green vegetable (either asparagus or broccoli, not sure) and from that point on, every time I eat at  a Cheesecake Factory, that's what I order, and I highly recommend it to anyone who tells me they are  going to the Cheesecake Factory.  The BEST part, however, is  the cheesecake...obviously!  There are so many different kinds of cheesecake it's crazy, and I don't remember which kinds I've had from there, but I guarantee there is at least one on the menu that will tickle your tastebuds."
Adrienne D.,"Baltimore, MD",32,68,,4.0,7/15/2011,Only restaurant open for brunch on Sunday! Everything I've ever had from here has been amazing. What's not to love? Great hummus and mexican egg rolls!
Sandi J.,"Washington, DC",4,52,2,2.0,8/16/2010,"Of all the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this was my least favorite experience.  Service is extremely slow.  I was seated outside with a friend and there were all kinds of food bits on the ground from guests feeding the pigeons and the grounds not being swept.  So guess what stalked our table our entire lunch?  Pigeons.  Then to make matters worse, there was a toddler seated beside me who was terrified of the pigeons and screamed bloody murder whenever one came near.  A portion of my order was left off when my main dish arrived.  It was just unpleasant."
Art S.,"New Haven, CT",104,463,19,3.0,1/7/2008,"What is there to say, really? It's the freaking Cheesecake Factory. You know it, you love it, you loathe it. Their menu is way too big, their food ranges from pretty good to blech, and the service is existent only in the sense that someone brings you your food and drink and you don't have to physically walk into the kitchen to get it yourself. Of course, their cheesecakes are mad crazy good. However, in no way whatsoever is it worth an hour wait to eat here."
Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",298,363,1,4.0,4/24/2007,"Now that I live back in NYC, I pretty much avoid chain restaurants like the plague.  But back when I was in college in Towson, The Cheesecake Factory was the hot spot for us!  Who cares if we had to wait 30 minutes to an hour?  We needed to get our cheesecake fix!  Besides, it was a good excuse to come into Baltimore and hang out at the Inner Harbor.  I even had my 21st birthday dinner here.  No, we couldn't make reservations and we had to wait awhile to get a table for 12, but it was well worth it.  As an inexperienced drinker, I was excited to finally try some of their enticing mixed drinks and I wasn't disappointed.  Don't remember what I ordered exactly, but I do know it was tasty and 100% legal for me to order! So during our college reunion in Towson/Baltimore this past weekend, my friends and I decided that we *needed* to hit up The Cheesecake Factory for old time's sake.  We figured we'd avoid the dinner time rush and go later, so we got there around 10:30.  We still had a half hour wait!  This place really is a tourist trap, and a damn successful one at that!  They're open until 1am on weekends, which is probably a good indicator of just how busy they expect to always be. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs that night.  Their menu is really extensive and pretty reasonably priced.  We ended up ordering three appetizers to share amongst the three of us - chicken potstickers, their version of crab rangoon, and spinach & artichoke dip.  The waitress left and we immediately reconsidered our decision not to order the New England Clam Chowder, a special.  So when she came back, we asked for 2 cups of clam chowder.  Okay, I don't know what dictionary they're using, but that clam chowder was in a BOWL.  Three of us could have easily split what was in there - and it was indeed a hearty chowder.  I sacrificed the last few spoonfuls of mine so I'd have room for the appetizers to come. The chicken potstickers were surprisingly flavorful.  I'm always wary of ordering Asian food in non-Asian establishments, especially when they're chain restaurants, but these potstickers were downright tasty.  The crab rangoon wasn't as good, but I'm happy to be eating any kind of crab whenever I'm in Maryland, and crab rangoon is hard to come by in NYC.  The dip was also pretty good, but we couldn't even finish it.  So yes, I concur that the portions are pretty big and very shareable. Our guts were literally stuffed, almost to the point of discomfort.  So we ordered a strawberry cheesecake to go and ate it in the hotel room that night.  As chain restaurants go, I think Cheesecake Factory is pretty good.  I think they do spend a lot of time honing their menu so it's not just a big selection of bland stuff.  And I think the cheesecake is pretty good, although not as good as Junior's in New York (I like mine to be a little more lip-smackingly thick).  So yeah, I'll admit it.  Whenever I'm in Baltimore (or at least the Inner Harbor), The Cheesecake Factory is still the hot spot."
A.v. N.,"Santa Clara, CA",323,121,38,3.0,1/11/2007,"Great place in the Harbor if you're willing to wait.  Generous portions, but the wait is long enough for your appetite to build. Not for folks who dilly-dally around deciding where they feel like eating.  Get to the Harbor, put in your name, walk around, then come back.   I know, they're a chain restaurant, but this was actually the first Cheesecake Factory I ate at when I lived in Baltimore.  They didn't have one in the Bay Area yet."
Kay S.,"Columbia, MD",605,362,,1.0,1/23/2008,"To quote a fellow Yelper about CF: ""...you love it, you loathe it."" Going to have to put myself in the ""loathe"" camp.  And for the record, this Noo Yawkah would like to point out that REAL cheesecake is thin and not particularly sweet. And it does not come in 75 Skittles-esque flavors."
Wai Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,84,,4.0,8/19/2007,"This was the first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to. I went here twice when I was in town for 2 weeks. Being I was in a ""foreign"" city, I asked people ""what's good around here?""  Someone suggested Cheesecake Factory. It gets very busy and you could be waiting for a while to be seated. It was definitely worth the wait. The waitress that I had was attentive and friendly, but overall the staff are friendly. It was also conveniently located near the Renaissance Hotel that I stayed at and its location reminded me of being near South Street Seaport (in NYC). The variety of cheesecake they offered was ""extensive"". Yummy, it took me a while to decide what I wanted for dessert. I was very pleased with the service and the food here. I would give this Cheesecake Factory a rating of 4.5 stars."
Shawn F.,"Washington, DC",5,65,12,2.0,8/25/2007,"This is really one of the poorer Cheesecake Factories I've experienced. It gets one star for the nice ambiance and another star for the generous portions. However, I'm taking off two stars for the subpar food and one more star for serving large portions of subpar food. Okay, so you already know that CF does not allow reservations, so we won't go into that. But after waiting so long for your table, you'd expect some good food, right? Not so, at least not at this Cheesecake Factory. Every time that I've been here, the food has been underwhelming. I don't know what it is, but the flavors are just...off.  There are so many good restaurants around the Harbor that you shouldn't have to subject yourself to Cheesecake Factory."
Jessica L.,"Baltimore, MD",89,135,111,4.0,11/25/2007,"Ok I am not one to review chain restaurants unless something went way wrong or I was blown away.  I ventured here with my husband last weekend and was pretty satisfied with the food and service. I had the EVELYN'S FAVORITE PASTA - Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Basil, Garlic, Pine Nuts and Parmesan Cheese ( I suggest they had a bit more olives and artichokes).  Overall, it was very good and the serving was huge ( couldn't even finish it at home in one more seating). My Husband had the FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC -Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Carmelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce (this one was also VERyY good and huge). The bread they served to munch on before hand was warm and yummy.  We tried to figure out what he darker bread was but had no luck (anybody know?). For dessert we ordered 2 slices of FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE -Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas.  We ate one there and took the other one home and ate it the following day (still very yummy then also).  For the price for a slice you get a large serving.  If you aren't  a big whip cream fan tell the waiter because they put a lot on the plate. Our waiter was VERY busy but was also very attentive which I was very pleased with.  Next time I head back I will try a sandwich- they sounded GREAT!"
Lindsey M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,24,,3.0,5/21/2013,"Everything is incredibly delicious, but even if you get a salad they are not particularly on the healthy side. I had the luau salad, and the chicken seemed like fake lunch meat chicken, and there were two huge fried wonton shells in it. The avocado egg rolls are absolutely amazing though, but the best thing there is definitely the cheesecake. The Baltimore location of this restaurant is extremely loud!! And the staff is sloppy. I'm sure any cheesecake you get, you will not be disappointed."
Sabree S.,"Cockeysville, MD",24,7,,4.0,12/23/2008,"I first went down here with a friend after the chain opened up a location in Towson and I'd never been to the inner harbor one. Now, I wished I'd gone sooner. The location is lovely, the food was great and we had amazingly good service. (Just don't go on the weekends. You'll be waiting at least an hour just for a table for two)."
Brian M.,"Port Charlotte, FL",24,37,,2.0,4/4/2010,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and most likely my last. I was dining solo so I decided to eat at the bar. The menu looks like the restaurant equivelent of War and Peace way too many options! Whats up with all the styles of cuisine Chinese, Italian, American, Japanese, Cajun and many more. Sometimes I have a identity crisis but this is menu is insane.   Service was efficently unfriendly, they provided me with my food and drink with a no frills attitude. I ordered a chopped salad for a starter. It was decent but not stellar, portions were very large which seems like the standard here. For my main I fiqured I would be safe with something they call their speciality a Cajun Shrimp Pasta. There was nothing special about this entree, The sauce tasted like a sweet spicy geletinous goo. It was another large portion of which I threw out 3/4th. I was so disappointed with the food I could not bring myself to ordering the cheesecake for dessert."
Jackie G.,"Huntersville, NC",0,45,1,1.0,6/3/2012,"Wow this place has really gone down hill.  After spending the morning at the aquarium, my family decided to visit the cheesecake factory for lunch.  Wow has this place gone down hill since I moved away from Baltimore 4 years ago.  The service was absolutely horrendous!  Our server had absolutely no personality, looked pissed off to be working, and was completely unhelpful the entire meal.  Our food took forever and she asked me, no lie, 3 times what I ordered!!  When she came back to our table for the third time and asked again what I had ordered, I should have just left and gone to ANY other place!  Our food finally came out and was good...no issues.  We asked for the bill and it took almost 30 minutes to get it!  Again, no ""thanks for stopping in, have a great day"" or anything like that.  The server just kind of stood there.  Ridiculous.  We were going to order some cheesecake for dessert, but decided to get some ""to go"" since lunch had already taken far too long and we didn't want to deal with our server any longer.  We ordered 4 slices of cheesecake at the counter.  When we got home, 3 of the 4 slices were the wrong kind!  The workers must have switched our bag with another customers... or maybe they were really just completely incompetent.  Completely disappointment in this place.  Seems to me like their staff needs some training, or a new manager!  Skip this place or request a server who enjoys his/her job."
Donald C.,"Parkville, MD",0,10,2,5.0,12/26/2012,Erin B was a great waitress. Food was delicious. We love to come here whenever we are at the Harbor.
Andy M.,"Barrington, IL",3,17,3,1.0,12/16/2010,Slowest. Service. Ever. The food here is below average at the best of times so if you think I'm going to wait this long for sub standard food you have got to be kidding. The harbor area can get very crowded but trust me.....keep searching for an open table elsewhere!
Prentice S.,"Ithaca, NY",0,20,,3.0,1/5/2011,"The food was good, but not great. Menu is kinda big. The cheese cake is as good as juniors in NYC. Well its better then good!!!"
Alec M.,"Darien, CT",1,2,,2.0,9/28/2012,"The service was very slow and the air conditioning was set to a temperature too cold to be comfortable. However, the food itself was good and we were seated quickly."
Santiago C.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",38,77,57,3.0,4/18/2010,"Not so special or out of this world , great variety of dishes but theres something missing, theres just nothing special! The best part was the exit sign !"
