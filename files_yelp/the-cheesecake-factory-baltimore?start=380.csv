Michael A.,"Washington, DC",0,77,,1.0,4/4/2010,"Four-cheese pizza was more like 100-cheese pizza.  Just really bad for you and gave me a stomachache that lasted into the next day. Good for families and not too expensive, but heck, an hour wait for this?  Nah."
Mike C.,"Howard, MD",0,164,,3.0,12/5/2009,"On a rainy/snowy December afternoon, there was no wait.  We were seated in an indoor patio.  Unfortunately, it was cold there (half of the customers had their coats on),  and there was an on-going drip from the ceiling.  But worst of all, it was very noisy.  I usually don't notice the noise, even when others complain of noisy restaurants, but here, I had a hard time hearing the waiter (who was very good) and felt that I was getting tired just conversing with my family. Everyone liked their meals.  My wife filled up on a white pizza and says that she would get it again.  My kids really liked their bowtie pasta in alfredo sauce. My appetizer fresh vegetable salad was entree sized.  While the individual elements were good, I'm not sure the combination worked.  Apples with green beans?  With tomatoes?  I had the garlic rolls from the small plates menu, and they were really good - filled with cheese with a side of tomato sauce.  My quick decision to order the sweet corn fritters had a great outcome - they rocketed onto my list of favorite restaurant foods.  Leave it to Cheesecake Factory to make corn fritters into what is probably a 1000 calorie side dish - but they were excellent. I might hesitate going to this location because of the noise (and the cold), not to mention the crowds that might amass during good weather.  Rather, I'll order some of these good things at another location."
Josiah L.,"New York, NY",71,155,35,4.0,8/28/2006,"My first impression: the entrees are HUGE!!! Everytime I went there with my friends, the girls always have to share, and sometimes we guys needed boxes for the leftovers. I fell in love with their shrimp scampi (dont know if they still make that well nowadays) and ceasar salad, and they got a pretty good brunch menu on the weekends. Make sure you have some free time for waiting if you go during the weekends, and when I say free time, I mean 1-3 hours and I'm not exaggerating. It gets mad busy on weekends."
Aud A.,"Sydney, Australia",63,223,44,3.0,11/21/2007,"Same ol same ol.  If you've been to one, you've been to them all.   Their portion sizes are out of control.  The drinks are surprisingly good, though the quality of the staff varies.  There are certainly far more special places to eat in and around the harbor."
Kim C.,"Columbus, GA",146,524,20,3.0,9/2/2009,"3.5 stars. the wait is long, but luckily we got tables at the bar. our server was awesome and refilled our drinks without us even asking! food was pretty good too. as usual, because portions are big, i was too full to get to the cheesecakes."
Jonathan P.,"Nashville, TN",1,31,,4.0,11/1/2012,"Okay this place is good on Cheese and cake. We went here hours before hurricane sandy came to the area, because I knew we would be in a hotel room forever when it was over us. The food is decent, my daughter totally destroyed some pasta with marinara sauce on it. Oh yeah! They love their garlic on that thing. I at a sandwich, because I was feeling run of the mill. The restaurant is nice, situated on the inner harbor with nice views of the harbor, sort of because you will most likely see a building. Service is okay, they pack you in there. They do basic excellently and the fam had a decent time. I think the people who cook for cheese cake factory should quit and start little restaurants all throughout Baltimore, because it is in need of basic clean food. Then the Cheesecake factory could like, train more of them. Then maybe baltimore could be known as the cheese cake capital of the world.....then.... Wait wait, cheese and seafood don't really go well together. They already have lots of crab, but in favor of good food I'd ditch the crab thing in an instant. Happy eating."
Jim A.,"Los Angeles, CA",418,127,91,5.0,4/29/2007,"Oh, its so hard to give anything less than 5 stars when it comes to the Menu here. You can't really complain too much about the wait, because you know going in that it's popular. I have been to different Cheesecake factories for years, and being a native Californian, I have been to my share of them. Maybe seven or eight altogether. That being said, I was very impressed with the Baltimore restaurant because of its location. I can't remember where the hell I parked, but that area is congested anyway. People do have to understand that the long wait is common for C.F. anywhere, so this is a great location to have to wait, since killing time in the harbor is better than a waiting bench. As for the menu, the Chinese Chicken Salad is the best in the business, and my favorite dish is Cajun Pasta Jambalaya (I hope I got that right) and  another amazing dish is the Four Cheese Pasta. I mean, you really need to try that. I don't know how they get that flavor."
