John H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,17,,4.0,3/9/2017,Went for dinner due to location in proximity to hotel -  I give it a solid 4-4.5 stars for maintaining the quality of the franchise.  Food was good/ service was good and over all atmosphere was busy but not overwhelming. You will wait FO a table during peek times but that is true of any decent restaurant in the area. I would NOT recommend M &S next door.
Jeannie M.,"Baltimore, MD",4,1,,4.0,9/1/2017,My only issue is the utensils are laid out on the table and I witnessed a server wipe the seat with the same cloth he used to wipe the table.  That disgusting to me.  Needless to say my group requested disposable utensils.  The food was good.
Carol B.,"Gastonia, NC",53,830,2359,3.0,7/3/2016,Super good location  You can't beat the menu  The outdoor patio is right over the harbor  Nice Sunday brunch selections Fills up fast
Lindsay A.,"McConnellsburg, PA",81,2,3,5.0,5/29/2017,"I don't typically choose to go to chain restaurants very often, but a girlfriend and I went in for a drink while we waited for friends to meet us in the inner harbor. We sat outside on the patio where we listened to nearby music and looked at the water. Our server suggested a sauvignon blanc that I enjoyed very much, and I also ordered an impressively tasty iced coffee. my friend ordered a smoothie that she is still talking about.  Upon looking at the extensive menu, we decided perhaps an appetizer was in order. I chose the Ahi Tuna Tartare. I've never seen such beautiful food presentation at a chain restaurant and I would definitely order it again. Our friends joined us and after looking at the menu ordered a Georgia peach , chicken Picatta, and I believe a Turtle cheese cake. All were delicious.   The food was so good I strongly suggested to my husband (who had an event at the convention center that day) that we go back, he agreed and I returned with him, and I talked it up so much a group of his friends from the convention center joined us. I ordered the same wine, he ordered an iced coffee, and his friends ordered smoothies(with the same reaction as my friend had the day before). We ordered Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls (the Peanut sauce was amazing). We ordered Thai coconut lime chicken, bacon-bacon cheeseburger, Louisiana chicken pasta, pasta Napoletana, and four cheese pasta-each of which we all tasted and loved. The food was very flavorful and unique and the food presentation was beautiful. For dessert we had a lemoncello torte, lemon raspberry cheesecake, salted caramel cheesecake, black tie cheesecake, and Chris's outrageous cheesecake. All were to die for and I don't think I could even pick a ""favorite"". I can't believe I would ever say this about a chain, but The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. We will definitely return."
Travis G.,"Morrisville, NC",1,64,55,3.0,2/2/2017,Average at best. Looks nice inside and the food is ok.  They have trimmed down the menu but its still a 22 page monstrosity.  They do have some decent lunch specials and a new healthy menu section.  The main reason to go here is cheesecake which is fantastic.
Steven L.,"Cary, NC",0,3,13,3.0,8/25/2017,"Cheese is always my favorite, so I went into when I caught sight of the name. Honestly, they offer much cheesecakes more than my expectation, and the Ultimate Red and Velvet tastes good. One thing makes me less comfortable. When I sit down by the table, one waitress didn't permit because "" that is for those who order"". It's ridiculous. Did I order no food, or did I order while I didn't sit? Damn it."
Richard C.,"Dayton, OH",34,130,17,3.0,11/11/2015,"The family and I came here after our trip to the Aquarium for lunch. It was a rainy day and it wasnt very busy so we were sat right away. Overall good with a few complaints. The Good: Food was excellent. We had the fried Mac and Cheese for an appetizer and my wife raved about it. She had the chicken fettucine which was really good. My son had the spaghetti with meatballs that he picked at but was good. I went with the usual there, the meatloaf. Again, food was excellent!  The Bad: Im not sure who designed the bathrooms but they make no sense and make it really awkward. Ill post a pic  The Ugly: There was a fly in my wifes drink. I saw it right away thankfully, and the waitress saw me pointing it out. She said ""Is there something in there??? I thought I saw something!"" REALLY? She actually said that. How about checking 1st before serving the extra unwanted protein."
Sierra D.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,1,4.0,2/13/2017,We just left this location and it definitely was not a bad experience. The staff were all very nice and checked in on us appropriately etc. The food was very good. Nothing wrong with anything except the bread which is free so... whatever lol. The bread was on the harder side but I still ate and enjoyed it. My only critique i suppose is that I thought the place's silverware and tables could've been kept cleaner. Otherwise it seems this place is trying hard to make their customers satisfied and happy customers. So I'm okay with this place.
Tamara B.,"Owings Mills, MD",13,1,,3.0,8/12/2017,The server was extremely slow and kept forgetting to refills our drinks..then would come back without item and ask us did we need them again
Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",270,136,607,4.0,7/5/2015,"You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. It's consistent across the U.S. I know because I've worked there for over 4 years and I have eaten at many different locations. We checked in around 5:45pm for a patio table on July 4th. We requested a table by the water, so we can watch the firework at 9:30pm. We knew it would be a longer than usual wait but we timed it correctly, so we can enjoy dessert and fireworks at the same time. Our server was really sweet. She didn't rush us at all. I'm sure she knows everyone on the patio are just sitting there waiting for the fireworks.  My favorites are the frozen iced mango smoothie, avocado egg roll, shrimp scampi and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. You won't be disappointed."
Michael S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Let me paint a picture for you: We've waited an hour to get into the restaurant, another half an hour for drinks, and finally at 2 hours into our excursion we get some mildly warm bread to whet our appetites. Unfortunately we have no utensils, no napkins, no anything. And the image I remember of my brother messily rubbing butter onto his bread with his bare hands is what best represents this...establishment.    Aside from the manager's ability to calmly handle the situation, this place was a complete mess. The extremely long waiting times definitely wore down our spirits by the time the waitress even showed up. I haven't the faintest idea why they sat us down when they didn't even have UTENSILS! And in between every different problem there was a 15 minute wait for the waitress to return! Our appetizers were a whole different story too! After an hour and a half of waiting we find out that there was some problem with them and we'd have them available WITH our main course, 15 minutes from now. We told her to just cancel it, and 10 minutes later a cook comes out with it anyways. I have no earthly idea what happened there but clearly there was an absence of basic communication. Finally our food arrives, and everyone can agree it was mediocre, room temperature, and overall, certainly not worth the completely ridiculous prices. And on top of all this, our waitress noticed we were a tad disappointed, and she continued the night with the worst attitude one could imagine, causing trouble for us at any turn possible.     Overall, this was a gigantic mess on everyone's part. Completely overpriced, completely mediocre, and a complete waste of our time- a long 3 hours down the drain. I can't even imagine what was happening behind the scenes, but we most certainly should not have been even SEATED if they don't have enough forks, knives, or even napkins. And for a final meal on our family vacation, this was the biggest disappointment of our week. I've never been happier to leave without dessert at a dessert restaurant."
April T.,"Mertztown, PA",0,21,2,1.0,7/31/2017,Busy time of day or not this place is definitely not worth going to. Omg sigh poor table service and guess what- if you are short handed- keep the drinks coming!
JJ N.,"Pasadena, CA",2,57,86,1.0,6/28/2017,"This is a very disappointing dinner at The Cheesecake Factory for me, and the worst.  I was here for dinner with my colleagues. We were here around 6:30pm. After waiting for 30 mins, we were seated. It took almost an hour for us to get our food!!! Most of us ordered pasta, and two had salad. The pasta came out cold, the plate was hot. I had Chicken Marsala, which hardly had any sauce and the mushrooms were partially burnt. Yes, the whole plate looked and tasted like some overcooked microwave meal. Pasta hardly had any sauce on, it tasted bland. I had to ask twice for extra sauce, and that took good 20 mins for the waitress to bring that over. By the time I got the sauce, I almost finished the second piece of chicken. Not to mention the extra sauce was cold. Overall, the Chicken Marsala was horrible, had no flavor.  The chopped salad didn't look appetizing at all. Thr lettauce was brown!!! The whole plate looked brown, not freshly green.  I had Chicken Marsala and chopped salad in other Cheesecake Factory locations. This one is the worst, not to mention, service wasn't that good either.  For $20 a plate, I expected food was hot and flavorful.  Don't waste your money here!!"
Shiu Lei W.,"New York, NY",11,190,1108,3.0,5/5/2016,Came here on a Saturday night and this restaurant for take out cheesecake was jam packed. I waited on line with girl cousin for half an hour to order a slice of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I ordered the original cheesecake and cousin ordered 2 other cheesecake. The slices of cheesecake were good size and comes with whipped cream on the side. I took it to go to eat at the hotel. The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake was good. Just this location was too packed with people. They need more cashiers if they want the line to move faster.
Wycliff J.,"Camp Hill, PA",2,64,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Were here with a group of us this week. This was lunchtime. It took over an hour for us to be served, and then we had to gulp it down so we were back to work in time. In short, this is a f--ing tourist trap. If you have 3-4 hours to spend on a lovely summer's day, go for it. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. Mediocre, boring, chain restaurant food. The long menu does nothing to improve on the fact that their food just SUCKS. The Sysco truck that parked there should have been my first clue..."
Ed C.,"Fairport, NY",0,4,,1.0,7/7/2017,Absolute horrible service . I wish I read some of the reviews before coming here!!! Spot on regarding the smell and the basic entree like chicken parm was awful!!!
Akhilesh B.,"Houston, TX",70,43,18,1.0,3/28/2016,"This place took took almost 20 minutes to acknowledge my order over the phone today. I was told there was a long wait. When I walked in though after just 2 or 3 mins there was no one waiting and the waitresses were singing songs, giggling and having a good time amongst each other.  Previous time I came here with my colleagues there were flying roaches on and around our food.  All they do to fix these situations is offer a free cheesecake. Do not recommend this place to anyone. Find somewhere else to feed yourself.  Added snapshot of the call history for proof. Check it out in photos."
Becky D.,"Reading, PA",131,244,370,5.0,5/6/2017,I will say we received some of the best service here while in Baltimore. I walked in to grab a buzzer and the hostesses were so nice. They said it would be about 25 minutes. After standing outside for about 15 a manager came over to assure us we would be sat soon. He quickly sat us a few minutes later outside which gave us a greet view of the inner harbor. Our server was super nice and very attentive to our needs. He made sure the kids for their drinks and food quickly. My husband and I each got a small salad and the grilled medallions (skinny menu). The grilled medallions with veggies was delicious. So full of flavor and just enough for us. The staff made this experience!
Thomas H.,"Baltimore, MD",68,6,,1.0,6/9/2017,Plus: Great view of the harbour; street musician playing out front. Minus: long wait for food and meal had no flavor. How do you make a cajan dish with no flavor?
Lisa L.,"Baltimore, MD",30,27,25,4.0,9/1/2016,"I sat at the bar Rachel the bartender greeted me right away gave me a menu told me about happy hr. She let me know her shift was ending then introduced me to Marco who would be taking care of me he made my cosmopolitan perfect. I asked him what food he liked on the Happy hour Menu, he suggested the Tex Mex Rolls and it was delicious. I will definitely be returning to this location. But anyway Great Customer service at the bar anyway not sure about at a table."
