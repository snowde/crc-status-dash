Geoff L.,"Holland, MI",19,20,5,2.0,6/24/2017,Excellent food. Very large portions. Expect to wait. Avoid sitting by the food prep area. Really loud and it sounded as if we were eating in the kitchen. When mentioned to the manager it didn't get better.
Nathaniel R.,"Hesperia, CA",0,112,120,3.0,4/30/2017,"Great food. Great location, portions match prices and the best desserts around. The only down fall of this place is the loud inconsiderate clientele. Management seems to ignore people who play music from their phones at the tables and those that complain loudly in the bar. They should be immediately confronted and asked to be considerate or leave. TIP - do not sit in the bar area if it can be helped. There are great servers there but terrible customers."
Mia L.,"Glen Burnie, MD",51,172,196,1.0,7/30/2016,"I only came to grab a slice of cheesecake and run. After waiting on line for 20 minutes, I left. Apparently, they were having issues with the computer at the register and couldn't process transactions. I understand that technical difficulties happen but why wasn't another solution offered? I'm sure that's not the only register in the entire restaurant."
Paula J.,"Smithtown, NY",111,145,43,5.0,2/26/2016,"Excellent waitress who was very patient with me and my moody and under-the-weather children.  Only thing I wish is that my hubby was there to enjoy such a pleasant, delicious and well deserved late lunch/early dinner on the harbor.   We had a great booth seat by the window/adjacent to their patio-like seating.  Even though it was extremely, nose running cold outside we were not freezing in our seats so close to the plasticy/window-ish see through material.  The booths were private and high enough that I didn't worry too much that the patrons adjacent to us on either side would be bothered by my boys fussing. The menu is so overwhelming with pages and pages of delicious options that I almost chose something different about 3 or 4 times before settling on the filet mignon cooked medium rare and I must say it was probably the most perfectly cooked filet mignon I've ever had and I've frequented my share of high-end steak restaurants.  I experienced several bites that literally melted in my mouth.  I regard a steak highly that does not require any steak sauce and this one fit the bill. The waitress was patient with me as I tried to pick a dish that would satisfy my picky youngest who wanted to try shrimp like his big brother and suggested a dish and recommended modifications to fit his picky palate.  I was set at ease to see he gobbled every last piece of shrimp and even went to his brother's side to try to scavenge from his plate as well! We ended the meal with a slice of their beyond compare Key Lime Cheesecake --which is a MUST for any visit to the Cheesecake Factory!  My oldest got a slice of the chocolate cake --which looked decadent and mouth-watering. I even ordered about 4 pieces of cheesecake to take To Go --including the Mango Key Lime one which I will probably not order ever again, but that's OK.  I just wanted to try it out.  The coconut flake infused crust did not meet my expectations, but if you LOVE coconut you may take to it better. Overall, I would say this was one of the best overall experiences out with the boys at a restaurant and we will DEFINITELY be BACK!!!"
Diane Y.,"Washington, DC",5,41,24,4.0,3/18/2017,"Stopped through the Inner Harbor en route back home. The Cheesecake Factory is the devil's den filled with culinary delights that totally wrecked my meal plan for the week. Who can go there and eat rabbit food.  I totally indulged and will have to scale back during the week and add more cardio on the elliptical.  Oh well-  the Avocado Egg Rolls,  Chicken Madeira and lemon meringue cheesecake was soooooooo good. Oh and the server was quite attentive."
Cecilia J.,"Washington, DC",100,52,15,1.0,7/22/2017,Yesterday my two grandkids and my friend from San Diego went here for a late lunch. It was 230pm. It took 30 minutes to get some bread after we asked 3 times. It was moving in slow motion. No silverware when our food came! Kept asking for silverware drink refills multiple times before they actually came. The group in back of us ordered a veggie burger. They apologized that it was delivered to the wrong table but assured him they would get him one out asap. A few minutes later they told him they had run out of veggie burgers! I paid our $125 check left a minimal tip and asked for the manager. 15 minutes no one comes( I guess I shouldn't have paid until he came).  I went to find a manager Lufonte Brooks who had the nastiest short man complex ever. Didn't say oh sorry for that! Just that he just got here so basically it wasn't his problem! Told me he would check to see what happened. I said and then what? He said there's nothing I can do you paid already and we are busy. I also tried to talk to Paul Herbert another manager who said there was nothing they could do. I called home office! If you have a problem there call home office: 8188713000
Lisa T.,"Ocean City, MD",42,3,,1.0,11/21/2016,"Went on a Monday evening.  The hostess barely acknowledged we were there.  The person who seated us did not even look at us or speak.  The waitress was Very friendly but told us the pipes were leaking from the restaurant above and they couldn't cook burgers.  When we asked what they could cook, we were given a long list of things they could not make.  It would have been nice to have been told when we arrived."
Ziqing M.,"Berkeley, CA",5,30,59,5.0,10/21/2016,"Strongly recommend their main course combo, salmon or shrimp and beef! We like them so much, and they really taste good and deserve the price. We went there in the afternoon, so there were few people at that time. But we still waited for a little bit long time. Other food and the services are all great, just the environment is not good enough, or not clean enough. We planned to try their cheesecake for dessert but a combo is totally enough for me. I'm sure we will be there again quite soon."
Stephanie N.,"Allentown, PA",11,15,,3.0,4/24/2017,I'm torn with my review. The wait was tolerable at 30 minutes. Our server was prompt to greet us. There were 4 of us- 2 adults and 2 teenagers. Our drinks were brought promptly. Our appetizer and salads were poorly timed as they came out a mere 5 minutes before our meals. The food was really good though. A manager came out to alert my friend that her tortillas were an issue in the kitchen and would be right out. He did apologize. Our server told us that there was an issue as well. 30 minutes later came her meal. We got no further apologies and no offer to comp her meal or free dessert or anything. As often as my family eats out there is generally a gesture of apology for our inconvenience. I'm bothered by the lack of care and empathy. Our total bill was $130.
Nancy H.,"Hanover, PA",37,219,398,4.0,1/18/2016,"Nice and fancy place love it. Could be pricing or just fair for this area. Good costumer service, nice and clean.  My cheesecake delicious and cappuccino was fine.  I didn't like (at the To Go side) the way the labels are posted for the cheesecake selection, make confusion at the time to choose which label belong to each cheesecake."
Brittany W.,"Baltimore, MD",205,130,130,4.0,11/8/2015,"Been to this location a couple of times, mainly to order a slice of cheesecake to go.  The lady that works the togo register is always so nice, plasent and joy to work with.  I wish I knew her name so I could give her a shout out!  I have seen her have a long line, moving customers along with such poise and never loosing her cool.  She has never gotten an order wrong for me and is still personable even when she is busy.   I have also been seated a couple of times here, nothing to spectacular about the service.  Since it is a chain, I know I will get the same meal each time I return.  I do enjoy their food as well as the ocassional treat of their cheesecake here and there."
Nicole L.,"Laurel, MD",12,28,,2.0,6/18/2016,"Meh. My boyfriend and I went to the harbor tonight to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and ended up at cheesecake. Note: the two stars are for the waitress who was very nice and the fact that the outdoor table we requested was ready in 40 minutes even though the original eta was one hour.  We were seated around 8pm. When it came time to order our meal, the waitress promptly informed is they were out of bacon and French fries. Being vegetarian we could give a shit about the bacon but the bf had actually been in the mood for French fries. Eventually we realized we never received the complementary bread which arrives hot and fresh almost instantly at the Columbia location. I encourage you to take a guess as to why. Yea...you guessed it; they were out of bread too. Seriously guys?! You're running out of menu staples on a Saturday in the summer before the sun has even set? Most peculiar of all was later in the meal when the waitress said something along the lines of ""blah blah blah we have French fries now"". Huh? How'd that happen?  For dinner we ordered artichoke spinach dip, avocado spring rolls and vegan Cobb salad. The dip was watered down to the point where I wonder if they were running out of that too so decided to add water and flour which would also explain the lack of flavor. Cobb salad left something to be decided by my boyfriend enjoyed it alright.  Overall feeling:"
Christine C.,"Woodbine, MD",34,11,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Let me save you the trouble: go somewhere else. Sorry if this is a bit long winded, but here is a snapshot of our visit.  The restaurant is dirty, dirty floors, smudged glass, overflowing garbage in ladies room, wet gross sink area and the lights have layers of dust.  The service was awful. When we were sat down it took a while for our server to even acknowledge us and even longer to get us drinks and take our order. Thankfully my daughters mac and cheese came out fast and it was actually delicious!  We ordered the chicken taquitos for an appetizer, they came out on a hot plate and were comically bad. They were squishy and the filling was very bland. It was also smothered in tomatoes and sitting in some sort of sauce that I'm sure destroyed the integrity of the taquito, but I wasn't even interested in picking it up to investigate.  When our food came out my husbands shrimp scampi was lukewarm at best. The pasta was stuck together and had the shrimp actually been warm would have probably been very good. The plate was screaming hot so it obviously sat under the warmer lights for a while.  I got the Thai lettuce wraps as my entree. I've had them before at other locations and love them hence me ordering it again. The components looked fine, but the chicken had big chunks of burnt pieces (probably the sugar in the seasoning, but it was black... eww).  When we let the waitress know the taquitos were not good she said 'oh, they were nasty?' Umm... yeah that's why we didn't eat them, so then she took them and disappeared. We sat for a few minutes just wanting our check so we could leave. After a while my husband went and tracked down a manager who was very nice and apologetic, but it was almost too little too late.  As a consolation prize he brought us two pieces of strawberry cheesecake. My husband is allergic to strawberries, go figure..."
Albert C.,"Seattle, WA",58,51,30,2.0,7/14/2016,"This location right in the middle of Inner Harbor often has a long wait line. The menu here is quite large and it consists of your standard American fare. Like every other cheesecake factory, the portions here are large and will easily fill you up. The food itself is okay, but the service here can be hit or miss. I have ordered pasta and burgers here, which are decent, but sometimes the service can take a long time to take our order or refill the water.  If there is no wait, then I'd consider this place, but if there's a line, I'm going upstairs to UNO's for some Chicago style pizza."
Lauren S.,"Baltimore, MD",34,176,51,2.0,6/30/2016,"First, I will say that my waitress(J)  was wonderful and I would give her 5 stars. I give the rating I do because of the quality of food and flexibility to accommodate customers with special dietary needs. First, they did not devein the shrimp on my shrimp sandwich ($13.95)---that's a pet peeve of mine and quite frankly, it's disgusting. Also, I got a side salad instead of fries and it was just lettuce...no veggies!  Secondly, my partner is a vegetarian and wanted to get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp minus the meat and substitute in veggies(broccoli, spinach, and avocado). The waitress checked in with either the chef or manager(not sure who) and told us they could make it, but that it would be an extra dollar for avocado. The dish was already $18.95 for chicken and shrimp and they're telling us that it will be $19.95 to have veggies instead of meat!!! What?!?!?! That doesn't even make sense; we were both livid. It was definitely not worth the money.  The sangria was weak and at $11.00 a glass; I expected better.  The avocado spring rolls came with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce; both were delicious and a definite highlight of the experience.  Thankfully, the waitress and service was on point.  I've gone to Cheesecake Factories in different states and this was by far the worst.  Find another place if you're in the harbor and want a good meal. I won't be back."
Ryan W.,"Finksburg, MD",8,98,,1.0,2/17/2017,The food was pretty good. The table was a bit sticky and not thoroughly cleaned.  I guess what made this a 1 star review was the hint of raw sewage wafting through the place. Other guest mentioned it. Not sure what was going on.
Alania A.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",125,53,24,4.0,1/7/2017,"I love the cheesecake factory. The food was good. The only problem I have was that the utensils was dirty. I had steak, mash potatoes and spinach. It was great no complaints. The waiter was great. I dont really remember her name. I had a big chocolate cake that I was surprised with because of course it was my birthday. I had a wonderful time. I will go back. Maybe not in MD because I was on a vacation, but in NY if its not crowded."
Owen B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",115,225,768,4.0,11/3/2015,"Ordered takeout and got the Cobb salad with chicken off the power-menu.  Nice mix of veggies, seeds, beats, quinoa and beans. Just get a different dressing, the one that comes with it is doesn't really go"
Jaime B.,"Salisbury, MD",28,2,,5.0,8/12/2017,"James was an excellent server and attentive to the table. Even with a large party we were well taken care of. The food was great, as always!"
Meme M.,"Tampa, FL",2,18,20,1.0,9/3/2016,"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been too. The service was awful. Utensils were dirty. Waitresses were loud and obnoxious. Everyone had an attitude. Even the hostess was rude. Told us 10min wait, turned to almost an hour. Text and talking on the phone. I can tell it's nothing but poor management . Disgusting."
