Zaneta B.,"Pumphrey, MD",11,13,4,3.0,1/2/2016,"Placed a phone order it was rang up in correctly waited 20 mins for my steak to be remade with the wrong sides still here waiting for the asparagus if your ordering ahead just go to capital grille they are much faster the lady at the register kept calling me ""baby"" im at least 15 years older than you it's disrespectful. Will not be ordering or coming to this location again - changing review manager Paul reached out to me and resolved the issues quickly thanks for caring about your customers"
Vic G.,"Quincy, MA",975,416,471,3.0,6/9/2015,"Quite a mixed set of feelings about this Cheesecake Factory. I do like this chain. They are very consistent and clearly - they know their niche - the cheesecakes.  This location is in the Inner Harbor mall. A prime location with tourists and locals making it a very busy hot spot. There is quite a bit of seating outside when the weather is nice. And if going here during usual peak hours or weekends - expect a wait - as is the case at most other locations. Here's why the place gets 3 stars in a nutshell.  - Decor / design: The place is over crowded with more tables than it ideally should have. Especially the outdoor seating, was simply put - chaotic. We got a table for 6 outside and although the view of the harbor was pretty, our table was right next to 2 other tables and it was quite a mall cafeteria kind of experience. Then there was this whole umbrella issue. The attendants outside could not have the tables covered with enough umbrellas given it was s scorcher of a day. Again - very chaotic.  At one point, we considered moving indoors. But after taking a quick look inside, it wasn't a great idea to switch tables. It was a massive wait for a table inside. So we stuck to what we got.  Food: I don't think I have ever had a reason to dislike their food. If there is one thing I can describe the food as - it would be consistently the same across the board. No matter which location you go to, you know you are at Cheesecake Factory. Given the hot summer day - I got a salad. Sheila chicken with avocados. Very light and fresh through and through. Others next to me got fish and chips and Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Everyone was happy with their meals including myself. Service: This was a very mixed experience. First the positive. Our waitress was very kind and always around to check on us. Our meals arrived on time. We were quite happy. Now The negative. The staff outside wasn't very accommodating with the arrangements. Primarily the umbrella situation that I mentioned above. This is probably a point that should be noted by the management of this branch. They should either reduce the table count outside or figure out a way to make the patrons comfortable outside when it is hot and humid outside.  For food alone, I would rate this location 4 stars. For the overall experience - the 3 stars."
Jason M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,10,,3.0,1/18/2017,"Went here while in town, the server was friendly but the service was slow.  The restaurant was clean and had a nice casual atmosphere, very child friendly to my three year old.  The food was okay, I ordered a mushroom burger and it was good, no complaints.  My wife got the spicy cashew chicken, she said it was bland and not very spicy.  We got a chicken tender with fries for my son, it was good but came 20 mins before our food. My hometown Cheesecake Factory is better than this one in the Inner Harbor, but not bad overall."
Michael F.,"Camp Hill, PA",1,1,,4.0,2/12/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday evening for an early Valentine's Day celebration with my girlfriend.  The place was nice and crowded on a beautiful February Saturday.  We had a 30-40 wait at 3:30 but that was no big deal as we've been here before and it's worth it.  Our drinks were great, appetizer was good was main meals were amazing.  The prices seem to be a little on the high side, but it is a tourist area in Baltimore.  We'll definitely be back."
Charlene M.,"Lancaster, PA",0,3,2,5.0,2/11/2017,I took 3 of my friends for a birthday celebration.  This is a fantastic place for special occasions.  We had 2 different appitizers appitizers each a different entree. Great for sharing bites. Of course we topped it off with cheesecake. I have never been dissapointed. Love this location also.
Shari W.,"Los Angeles, CA",338,68,141,5.0,5/31/2016,"I had a pleasant experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. I ordered the Black Pepper Shrimp dish that came with shrimp, black beans, rice, plantains and mango. And booooooyyyy was it delicious! My date looked at my plate saying it looked good. Deep down inside I snickered a bit because my plate definitely looked better than his pasta dish. Either way we were both very satisfied. Our waitress was very friendly. We sat at the bar area since it was such a long wait for the seated area. We also ordered the egg and avocado rolls for an appetizer. Those were just okay. Felt like they were missing something and also tasted store bought. For dessert we got the red velvet cheesecake. Delish! I just wish that the presentation of the waiters and waitresses were improved on. I worked in retail before. It doesn't hurt to reflect a better standard."
Adam M.,"Washington, DC",47,34,14,3.0,8/12/2016,"Quoted an hour wait time for party of 6... Waited an hour and 45min... The staff acknowledged we had waited way longer then quoted but did not apologize or even so much as offer waters for the long wait... The noise level in the restaurant was so loud that you can't hear anyone at the table talking... Our party of 6 said ""what"" more then anything else... Overall made for a pretty miserable experience.  The server however brought it back around from what would have been a 2 star to a 3. His name was Daniel S and he did an amazing job. He got the order put in and brought out the food as it was ready so we could get some food in considering the long wait. I tend to drink 5-6 glasses of water at dinner and I never had an empty glass.  Overall I would say the restaurant atmosphere was horrible... Noise level was significantly louder then your average Cheesecake Factory and cleanliness was subpar. The bathroom was pretty horrible as well. Very dirty with wet paper towels and TP all over the floor."
Talya G.,"Overland Park, KS",0,25,,1.0,3/13/2016,"I am appalled by the situation going on here.  I love Cheesecake Factory, and I travel for work; so whenever there is a location in the city that I'm in, I go enjoy one of my fave menus. This Baltimore location is an embarrassment to the chain. I went to eat with my friend. After waiting over 20 minutes for guacamole as as appetizer, it then took 40 minutes for our food to arrive, the table side service was few and far between (only refilling my water one time, etc.) we ended up having to have our food boxed because of time. I was very disappointed, but have the benefit of the doubt.  My mistake.  4 days later I ordered guacamole for pick-up 15 min before leaving work. I figured it was an easy enough request. When I got there to pay and retrieve, I had a To-go box of what what very clearly just mushed up avocado. I respectfully asked that it be sent back to have GUACAMOLE ingredients added. Trying to maintain patience as I stood waiting, my view of the kitchen shocked and startled me. NO GLOVES...people directly preparing and boxing food with bare hands. Employees eating food that they were boxing up for paying customers. Mind you, this is in plain view of all guests. I will never return to this location and made my concerns known. The manager was decent, and refunded me for the guac...but honestly seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. I am so sad to have to write a review like this :("
Robin P.,"Baltimore, MD",66,169,202,2.0,8/20/2015,"Giving only two stars pains me - it really does. But that's about all I can muster after our visit this past Friday evening. My kids were in from Milwaukee for the weekend and coming to a nationwide staple seemed like the right thing to do given our experiences in Wisconsin, Arizona, and California. This experience in Maryland, however, was not a stellar one. Granted, it was busy when we sat down...but isn't this place usually always busy unless the doors just opened for the day? At least that's been my experience over the years. We ordered an appetizer (Parmesan-garlic cheese bread) that didn't arrive until after our entrees. Ooops. It was swiftly removed from our bill, thankfully. Our entrees were mediocre at best. My son's fettuccine alfredo with shrimp was sorely lacking in the shrimp department - come on! We're on the water, for heaven's sake! I don't think there is a shortage of shrimp in the area. His girlfriend's rib eye steak was a bit overdone and was, sadly, fatty - lots of waste to be had. She ordered it because of her iron deficiency anemia and felt that ""some steak would do my body good."" Suffice to say, we needed to make up for it and find other natural sources of iron over the course of the weekend. My veggie burger was the highlight of the three orders - it was very good. Perfectly cooked and with sweet potato fries on the side? I was a happy girl. My kids? Not so much. Being lactose intolerant, I passed on the cheesecake but my kids happily indulged in slices of strawberry and chocolate - their eyes spoke volumes and dessert was clearly the highlight of their experience. I guess the place lived up to their ""cheesecake"" name...that's about all, though, this time around. Will try this location again in the future - just not for a while."
Andrea M.,"Glendale, CA",0,19,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"Tourists do NOT go to this location! I was visiting the area as a tourist and decided to grab a bite at a familiar chain restaurant. I literally stepped in, had a look around, and immediately stepped out. This location has to be one of the filthiest and most unkept Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have ever witnessed. In front of the kitchen area there were bags of trash laying around and each time I would pass by the location (I was in the downtown area for 5 days) I would see kitchen workers hanging directly outside the restaurant smoking. During my very abrupt visit, I also noticed a bum causing commotion as staff were trying to get rid of him. From what I saw, it was being handled sincerely and professionally. But, the super unkept and dirty interior of the restaurant immediately made me lose my appetite. After witnessing what I did, I really do not want to know what goes on inside the kitchen."
Brian G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,32,,5.0,1/15/2017,"alright, here goes - this place is THE BEST! The menu is literally the size of a new york city phonebook.  There are so many different options, that if you ate here every day, it would take 6 years to try everything they have to offer.  Picky eater in the family?  Bring him because there is literally something for everyone here!  Birthday? Celebrate it with the CCF! The wait staff comes out to your table and sings to you.  We went on my birthday and I was given a complementary slice of cheesecake that tasted as if it were baked in heaven by God.  I look forward to my next trip :)"
Lauren G.,"Bowie, MD",6,20,,2.0,11/6/2016,"I came to the Cheesecake Factory as a party of 1 so although it was packed I was seated immediately. I was greeted by a server in the first few mins and asked what I wanted to drink. My experience went downhill from there. My server didn't return to take my order for 15 mins. It took another 10 mins for bread, and after being in the restaurant for nearly an hour with three tables around me full of people who had yet to be served I left. Grant it, it is Sunday and very busy but the service (and my server) were moving at a pond waters pace. I will not return."
Mike N.,"Clarksville, TN",65,376,517,4.0,4/6/2016,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory, but this is at Inner Harbor, Baltimore. Food was very good, and our server was exceptionally nice. It was a very lovely lunch while we spent our rainy day in Inner Harbor. Close proximity to all the activities this place offers."
George V.,"Baltimore, MD",12,4,,2.0,1/4/2017,"Used to be alright, service has been tanking lately.  Drinks aren't mixed well but some of the time the food comes out well, the cheesecake's the sole reason to visit.  (Edit for the business comment: we did talk to the manager about it but he seemed uninterested)"
Heidi F.,"Catonsville, MD",249,420,589,3.0,6/16/2015,"I stopped in for something sweet after a concert at pier 6 and this place was packed! No one greeted me so I went over to the bar and grabbed a stool. The bar was small but no wait so I didn't mind. The bar tender asked if I was eating or drinking, that was kinda strange.  I order a brownie sundae and it was insanely sweet and was served with a cold brownie (warm would have been better) additionally and ice cream to brownie ratio was way way off! The presentation was pretty. Over it was so-so, the service was ok but I felt like I was annoying the waiter by only get a sundae but that's all I wanted!"
Jarrod F.,"Westminster, MD",116,273,168,3.0,6/14/2015,"Unfortunately this cheesecake is slightly below par compared to other locations. I think it's because of the fact that the locations is constantly busy and because the people who work there don't really do a great job keeping dishes consistent. I've been to this location several times. It's mostly filled with tourist and people who are here for the baseball games. But there's always just a little bit of a malfunction whenever I come here.  Like I said for a Cheesecake Factory at least you always know the food is decent. The cheesecake is always phenomenal. The ""skinny"" menu is very convenient for the weight watchers conscious customer. And there's enough variety to keep you coming back to try something new. Wish they had valet parking."
Jen C.,"York, PA",1,34,5,5.0,5/13/2016,"We came in for lunch at the break of a dental conference at the convention center. We were promptly seated, had a wonderful server who was efficient and friendly, and had food and drinks delivered as ordered. The thing that made it EXCEPTIONAL was the waitress, unsure of my food allergy issues, had the GM stop by the table and help with gluten and vegan concerns. Takeaway = GREAT FOOD, excellent service, comfortable seating and a great choice for all of us (6). I look forward to my next opportunity to eat here!"
Gary R.,"Florence, NJ",0,6,1,2.0,6/20/2017,"We were promptly seated outside at 200 pm for lunch from there It progressively went down hill. Drinks arrived with meal, appetizer never did. Food when it did arrive did not come to everyone at the same time nor did all the side dishes arrive until the main meal was almost finished. We were never asked how things we're going. Talk to management and they did adjust bill. First time in my 66 years of life I did not leave a gratitude. Disappointed experience for our sons anniversary .p.s. Good that we did receive was tasteful."
José G.,"Carolina, Puerto Rico",0,11,,3.0,12/14/2016,"I like their food and environment.  The service was good.  If you like the cheesecakes, you'll have several options to try."
