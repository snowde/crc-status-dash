Donald J.,"Copiague, NY",101,166,1258,3.0,10/20/2017,"It was my granddaughter's birthday and I asked her where she wanted to go to eat and she said let's try the Cheesecake Factory good choice.      We were seated right away when we got there and the waitress came over and took off appetizer order,we got the deep fried calamari that was cooked perfectly nice and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.            I got the meatloaf special and that was very good very flavorful and moist and the mashed potatoes with gravy was also very good            Wifey got the mushroom burger that she said was very tasty and my granddaughter got the crispy chicken tender sandwich that was so huge she couldn't finish it but she said that it was slamming crunchy on the outside moist and flavorful on the inside.      The meal was so filling and that all of us had to skip dessert .             The only reason I didn't give them 4stars was because the waitress was very inattentive she was more interested in conversating with the other waitresses then seeing whether we needed anything else we had to ask the bus boy to get her a couple of times.  But otherwise I would go back because the food was very good"
Claudia M.,"Bronx, NY",102,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,"This was our favorite restaurant in so many other locations. Love the lettuce wraps, salads and so many entrees! Today we decided to have appetizers for dinner especially the avocado rolls! We arrived, short wait time -perfect!  Sat at a booth which is ideal with kids and a party of four. We knew exactly what we wanted, avocado rolls, kids cheese pizza, taters and chicken nachos..... placed this exact order.... then the waiter came back to let us know that they were out of avocado rolls...  how?! So he provided a menu once again, because my daughter and I were craving avocado we ordered the burrito which comes with guacamole but because I can't have chicken I asked for it on the side, the waiter said he would put it in and come back with whatever was ready from our order... he returned to let us know that they couldn't have the chicken on the side because of the new way they are making the burrito! So once again... we look at the menu, order fish tacos... then the waiter comes back again to say that they had already made the burrito...  We patiently waited, our food came our son was very happy with his cheese pizza, my daughter loved the taters, the nachos had chicken on 5 pieces of nachos out of the entire plate.... the burrito was filled with rice... barely any veggies. There were some bites that were only rice and wrap!  It was all so disappointing, we should have gone elsewhere as soon as they said they were out of avocado rolls."
Chris R.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Dirty restaurant, burnt food that was either dried out from heat lamps, or just overcooked and inedible. Horrible experience.  My wife and I didn't eat any of our entrée and the waitress didn't even ask why?  This place gives the cheesecake factory a bad name.  Messy bathrooms, that smell like urine. Greasy floors leading from the messy kitchen.  Managers laughing and talking by the bar while the place is going to hell.  I actually opened an account specifically to call out this mess.   They have another location in Huntington that is amazing go there.  I will never go back to this place and if they keep going in the direction they are I'm sure they won't last long!"
Lava G.,"Coram, NY",152,13,13,3.0,1/2/2018,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but the food just wasn't up to par. Maybe it's just this location, not sure. We were seated right away even though it was busy for New Year's Day. The tables for 2 were WAYY too close to each other. No privacy, I could hear every word of the conversations sitting next to me on either side, bery distracting. We got the nachos as an appetizer and they were AMAZINGGG. Unfortunately our entrees were less desirable. I got the pasta carbonara and so did the two couples sitting next to us and we all agreed it was WAYYY too salty. My boyfriend got the chipotle pasta and it had a weird sweetness to it and it just wasn't that great. Desert was great as always. The service was amazing. The meal was just disappointing, reason I'm giving it 3 stars. So I'll probably come back & maybe just stay away from the pasta lol"
John M.,"Northport, NY",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2018,"This was our first time going to a Cheesecake Factory although the menu was a little overwhelming we had a wonderful experience. We went yesterday a Tuesday at around 6pm and we got seated right away and our waiter was very polite. As an appetizer we were recommended the avocado egg rolls which were great then for our entrees, I had the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp and my wife had a Jamaican shrimp they were both Delicious. Both the plates looked and tasted amazing the table besides us ordered an eggplant pasta dish that looked scrumptious, defiantly trying that next time. Overall had a wonderful experience and definitely coming again."
Alicia S.,"Deer Park, NY",1,6,,1.0,1/10/2018,This location is the worst. The food is not appetizing and the staff is rude and nasty even the managers are nasty to there customers. I have tried this location a few times and every time its been a waste of money cause the food came out over done or the wrong order. They don't seem to listen or maybe the chef doesn't read and can't understand when someone is allergic to certain foods. All the other locations are great the best one is in huntington. I wished they would have fixed there issues but I guess they don't care about the customers. Oh well I guess they just lost another customer and yes I travel to the other locations so I don't have these issues again!!
Joanne P.,"North Babylon, NY",65,108,261,3.0,12/22/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Their menu is so extensive it's impossible not to find something you'd like! And I especially love their skinny menu that includes skinny drinks! I got a skinny cosmo and I actually liked it better than a regular cosmo-you can tell there's less sugar but def not less flavor. My bf got some kind of fruity drink that was def sugar overload but still good-not sure what it was though. We split the Korean fried cauliflower and potstickers for appetizers. Surprisingly decent portion size since the cauliflower was on the small plates menu. They were not oily or salty at all, both were seasoned to perfection. For entree, I got the Mexican tortilla salad off the skinny menu and my bf steered away from his usual-chicken Marsala- and went with a special-chicken reisling. To this moment he regrets that! The dish was supposed to be chicken in a reisling wine sauce with pasta, mushrooms and bacon. First of all for a place known for its portion sizes, this dish was something off a kids menu...about a quarter of the size of a normal dish there especially in comparison to the volcano sized salad I got. The dish came with literally 4 slices of mushroom, not even a full mushroom and absolutely no bacon. When this was brought to the managers attention, he was dismissive and didn't seem to care at all, poor customer service. The waitress cared more than he did...he ended up sending out a side dish of mushrooms and bacon but since the portion was so small, my bf finished his dish before the side even arrived. I sampled it as well and thought it was bland anyway. My salad was excellent though & so big I brought half home for lunch. Our waitress Brittany was extremely friendly and attentive. Prices are decent and the restaurant is always clean, just disappointed in that one dish so we wouldn't try that again-stick to the basics next time!"
James L.,"Babylon, NY",1,6,,1.0,1/8/2018,This used to be our favorite place. Food is excellent and plentiful. Service is also excellent and I will never go there again. I was having an anniversary dinner when a gang of young adults were beating up on someone right outside the window. They were attacking some poor guy and I wondered if someone was to draw a gun or not. I never saw anything like this and am worried this might be a trend going forward. I called the manager just to vent and she was very professional but unable to help me and I clearly understand. I'll eat at the Huntington location in the future.
Sharon J.,"Copiague, NY",9,106,317,4.0,10/22/2017,"I love cheesecake there are so many varieties here it is so hard to choose. My favorites are the lemon meringue & white chocolate macadamia, but let's not forget the plain. I had the mushroom burger with fotinina cheese & fries, hubby had meatloaf and mashed red potatoes with gravy my granddaughter had chicken breast with chipotle sauce. We all enjoyed our meals. The menu choices are plentiful making it hard to choose. You must try them for yourself."
Amanda F.,"Patchogue, NY",56,137,844,3.0,6/23/2017,"Cheesecake is always really good.  They have basically everything on their menu.  Cheesecake is delicious.  Portions are huge. Drinks are good.  Just pricey as we all know. That's why i only come here once in a blue moon.  I happen to like this location over smith haven.  The specialty i usually always get is the chicken madeira. it's so good, love the mashed potatoes.  Favorite cheesecake is Chris' outrageous, coconut cheesecake with brownie crust and pecan frosting.  YUMMMM."
Chris H.,"Dix Hills, NY",341,183,247,3.0,6/4/2017,"I applaud Cheesecake Factory for having a low- cal 'skinny' menu, however every time I get something from the healthy menu, the portion size is small. For example, the skinny chicken soft tacos were good, but I could have  eaten 10 of them. Skinny menu seems to be a euphemism for less food at the same price as the regular  menu items. So let's exploit the people who want to eat a light meal."
Jessica R.,"Bayport, NY",144,159,105,1.0,7/10/2017,"Where do I begin? Worst dining experience I've had in a very long time. Hostess' were so rude and catty. The host stand is the first and lasting impression of a business and having the girls myself and my family dealt with work the counter isn't a good idea. 1st girl: straight dirty blonde hair, about 5""4, makeup 2nd girl: plain Jane looking, dark brown hair, a little wavy in low pony tail My family (6) went out to celebrate my younger brothers birthday. It was a 25 min wait. Completely fine, its a Friday evening. We sat outside patiently with our buzzer device and enjoyed the weather. *Side note, the entire outside seating area wasn't active. All dusty and dirty couch cushions were over the outside seats.* The buzzer went off and we handed it in to one of the girls.  She couldn't even look up to take the device. I know it's not a big deal but eye contact shows consideration and respect, a quality every human being should possess, especially working in the service industry, food or retail.   The whole host stand had this aura that they were above their jobs and couldn't be bothered. I hate to be the bearer of bad news; however, you are working this job. If you don't like it, change it.  We stood around for about 7 minutes after handing in our buzzer device. Parties were being sat left and right, most parties whom handed in their devices after us.  I went up to the hostess stand and asked how much longer, to which I got a reply that I needed to hand in my buzzer. We already did, you idiot. We've only been a been a party of 6 standing right next to you. Hope you're never in danger because your spatial skills are just as bad as your superiority complex.  The three hostess' all looked at each other like they were about to shit their pants because clearly they messed up and gave our table away. A table we just waited for, for 25 minutes. They have their backs turned and are whispering to each other, while a waiter comes up and looks at me with like a grin on his face, as if he was bored and was looking for entertainment. They didn't feel bad, they didn't care.  Another worker comes up, asks if we are being helped, to which I said, ""yes, but I believe they gave our table away.""  You would have thought I just told one of the girls that she has 4 days to live. She whips her head around so fast, swinging her nothingness of a pony tail, practically cracking her neck better than a chiropractor on crack could do. She snaps, ""we did not give your table away! I'm trying to figure it out, so relax!""  Whoa. Girl. You are having a bad day, you are tense, and you need some milk.  I immediately said, that's fine but if you could update us on what's going on that's what I would appreciate. Then I asked for a manager.  A male came up and scurries us away. I tell him what happened to which he replies with nods and mhmms. No solutions, no apologies. Nice guy, not manager material. Asian male for whoever at this establishment reads this and wants to understand what happened. I asked the manager for the names of the girls and he told me he'd find out. Never did.  He sits us at a table that's barely cleaned off and completely not set. Doesn't apologize.  Male manager *fades out*  He never comes back. No follow up.  We don't have a waitress come up to us for 10 minutes. No plates, no water, no napkins, no silverware.  We are the rejects of the Cheesecake Factory.  A waitress passes, my mom yells excuse me very loud and asks her if she is our waitress. She says yes and she'll be right back. She should've done that already, passing our table at least 2 times since we sat.  Now we have a bad taste in our mouth to the entire dining experience.  The waitress comes up, Spanish descent, petite in height. She asks if she can get us something to drink and I interrupt her asking for the missing pieces to our puzzle, i.e plates, napkins, silverware. She comes back over 5 minutes later and puts everything in the middle of the table. Doesn't pass a single thing out. Takes our drink orders. Her responses were short and brash. Keeps saying, ""what does he want?"" about my brother at the end of the table with the same disdain in her voice.  I didn't want the sit down dining experience to ruin my brothers birthday dinner because the whole conversation amongst my family was about how horrible everything was. The waitress came over and I tapped her arm and said, ""Listen, I'm sorry about my attitude to you, but we had a horrible experience with being seated and it's not your fault."" She said it was okay and that she heard what happened. Although she said that she wants us to leave happy her attitude in the beginning certainly suggested otherwise. And I can't help but think that if I didn't break the ice, take the high road, and apologize that we would've had an all around horrible experience.  Won't be back to this location. Lack of responsibility from entire staff and catty, childish behavior."
Irina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,15,,1.0,11/18/2017,"The experience was very bad. I found a hair in my cheesecake and then they replaced it,  in the other one there was a hair as well, and for the third tried finally they brought a cheesecake without a hair on it. Most good restaurant out of curtesy would've given it for no charge however this one didn't do shit about it."
Sara B.,"Bay Shore, NY",46,93,21,2.0,8/7/2017,"Went the other day because I really wanted to try the limited edition Celebration cheesecake and to give it another shot after a terrible experience I had the last time I went. I will NEVER go to this location again. *Only reason I am bring my 1 star review to a 2 star is because our waiter was very good and very attentive*  My friend and I ended up sitting outside because it was a nice day. We ordered our drinks and an app. Drinks came out pretty quick but we waited over 20 minutes for the app. The waiter knew we were waiting a while and did apologize multiple times. He ended up holding on putting our dinner orders in because it was taking so long and he didn't want us to rush with our app. Probably not the best idea because we waited another 20 minutes for our dinner. My friend's dinner came out first and mine came out another 5 minutes later. All I ordered was the lettuces tacos, so I am not sure why this took so long. I had also ordered a meal to go for my boyfriend which took a while as well. It almost came to the point where we were going to cancel our meal orders because we got so filled up on the bread and app, but I felt bad because the waiter was very nice. In all we were there for almost two hours, most of the time just waiting for the food to come out Food was good, the usual Cheesecake Factory quality. The Pineapple Moscow Mule was amazing! Celebration Cheesecake, not worth it *whomp whomp* . Oh, and my chicken lettuce tacos came with one little piece of chicken in each taco -__- this has never happened at any other CF.  Bottom Line: I love Cheesecake Factory, but WILL NOT go back to this one."
Marea P.,"Bay Shore, NY",3,11,22,5.0,6/16/2017,"Not sure why so many people bitch about this location. I've been many times, dine in, take out and curbside and have no complaints. I am super needy as a customer in general and my husband says I am  off the charts terrible, because I will always ask for 900 things changed and brought to me. That said, I also worked in food service and waitressed for years during college. I know what I expect.  This location does get busy AF Friday and Sat evenings. I can't attest to the rest of the week because I don't love the mall it's attached to (no inside mall entrance) so I don't come here constantly. There will be massive waits of 1 hour or more on those days for dinner, starting at about 4-4:30. After I had my son, I used to phone in and have food brought out to me (they have several designated spaces in which curbside is to park) and my order has never been wrong (I check before I leave because I know the drill). My husband has picked up for me and he sucks at checking, and still everything was correct. Food is always consistent and fresh. They have a massive menu and a skinny menu with delicious options, though smaller portions or somewhat tweaked for calories/fat, and a nice kids menu selection (salmon, pasta, sliders, plus usual kid selections). We went today, just left. I chose a non busy time, because I have a 2 year old and a pissy hungry husband. The hostess who greeted us was friendly, I asked for a booth and a highchair and she seated us at a massive 6 person booth, which I always love, and chatted w us.  Our server Vanessa was amazing. Super friendly, uniform impeccable, not a hair out of place, fast and efficient and brought me the usual infinity of extras I require (more bread, more butter, extra sauces, more ketchup, etc). Our server greeted us almost immediately and brought soft, warm bread and real butter. I was surprised to get the bread as we arrived at about 3 pm, so that's not something I expect so early, but was very nice to have and enjoy. It comes w one white and one wheat w oat. We kept it simple and ordered cokes and a milk w a lid. Glasses are enormous and soda was super fizzy just like I like. We asked to order the kids meal first while we looked at the menu, which was no problem. The kids pasta came out quickly and was cooked al dente (not that my kid would care, but I do), I requested it plain w the real butter packets on the side so I could control the amount added, which Vanessa remembered and brought right along w the pasta. She was very friendly w my child and laughed and cooed at him.  I ordered the Thai chicken wraps (regular app portion which is big enough for a meal. There is a skinny version of this plate also.) I asked for extra of every sauce. My husband got a turkey burger, extra cheese and fries ""no veggies don't even let a pickle touch my plate"". My husband's came out just as he ordered it. Mine came with its usual beautiful presentation and Vanessa immediately said ""I will be right back w all of your sauces"" and my husband indicated he would need much more ketchup. She brought everything quickly.  No dessert this time, but I always, always enjoy their key lime cheesecake and the pineapple upside down as well."
Francisco C.,"Morris Heights, Bronx, NY",39,28,35,2.0,8/11/2017,I have been here plenty of times but today I have had the worse experience. They took over 40mins to serve our food which was mostly pasta and everything came out wrong. They didn't put enough Alfredo sauce then they served me the wrong noodles and my wife didn't ask for mash potatoes she told them and all they did was scrape it off. Worst dinner here next time I'll just go to the Olive Garden across the parking lot Well now 2months later and they still can't bring out what I ordered that's it I'll stick to olive garden across the parking lot from now on smh
Yellow R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,50,66,5.0,5/30/2017,"Checked the reviews, and don't get it. I think this Cheesecake Factory is great. It was a 1:00 date on a weekday. We were greeted and immediately seated in a big, comfortable booth for six...even though we were only two. The waitress was charming, and did not rush us to order. We were out to catch up, and enjoy a pleasant lunch. Delicious breads that were warm came immediately. Our waitress was a true professional, and took our order at a good time. I ordered a diet entree, which the menu listed at 370 calories. This meat, veggies, and mashed potato dish was sooo good. I almost licked the plate clean. My friend ordered a Thai dish that was served on lettuce leaves, and she knew the peanut sauce was the best. Forget the other choices. Had to resist the desserts. They were so delicious looking. The parking is great outside the mall, and the restaurant is right there on the south side."
Juhi G.,"West Babylon, NY",121,123,278,3.0,1/22/2017,The food is good and it's never too loud here during lunch. The waitress was whatever. She only came to take our order and never came back again. I'm also giving them three starts because we didn't get bread in the beginning smh
Christina J.,"West Babylon, NY",330,332,2136,3.0,6/12/2016,"Brunch date with son & 3 of his Co-Workers. Company was great as usual but my food fell short today.  Although Crispy Cuban Rolls were on point, the Kobe burger which I ordered medium rare was well done & dry. We had already waited 30 min for our order to come out so I didn't ask for a replacement. My dog Phoenix will eat good tonight. The salad was soggy & wilted. No Good.  No dessert today.  6-12-2016 Wanted a late night snack & CCF has many delicious options to choose from. This night I chose an appetizer, salad & a piece of cheesecake.  Started with the Egg Roll Sampler. A mix of Avocado, Tex-Mex, & Cuban Rolls. My favorite being the Cuban rolls which tasted like mini Cuban sandwiches & came with a mustard dipping sauce. The avocado rolls would definitely make a good vegetarian option.   Next was my Greek Salad....not so good. Watery, lacked flavor & Cheese barely there.  The star of the night was the Dulche De Leche Cheesecake. Creamy sweet caramel goodness.  All of this was done through curbside service. Easy & convenient. Overall a good choice for good chain food.  1-30-2016"
Monique W.,"Bay Shore, NY",210,120,430,2.0,12/20/2016,"This was my second time coming back to cheesecake factory. I ordered the carrot cake and the strawberry cheesecake. Carrot cake tasted stale. The cheesecake tasted OK but the strawberries was not good. I'm not sure if I will order dessert again. I thought for the 20 dollars I spent on two pieces of their dessert it would be worth it, but it really wasnt . totally disappointed."
kallie s.,"Patchogue, NY",592,43,33,2.0,7/27/2017,It is what it is the food is OK but it's like any other chain restaurant. The cheesecake is good though. Menu is giant and the place tends to get  super crowded and the service definitely lacks due to that factor. I hate sitting in a restaurant with an empty glass while I'm eating. The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner. I have gotten cakes out of there a few times to go and some of their flavor combinations are very delicious. I personally think this location is the worst of all of them.
Melyssa E.,"Rockville Centre, NY",170,118,73,3.0,2/17/2017,"3rd or 4th time here so updating my review. Same amount of stars for friendly service and atmosphere. Well this visit I ordered a glamburger with cheese I'm plain and simple. I also ordered sweet potato fries as my side. Well I'll include a photo of what they gave me but in short they were shriveled and hard.  :( no worries though, my burger was amazing and our waitress came back with fresh sweet potato fries that came out looking just as they should. Took a little long to come out but still tasty once done right."
Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",71,90,157,5.0,6/19/2017,Avacado egg rolls - incredible. This particular cheesecake factory is great and the service is impeccable. I personally like the Chipotle Chicken Pasta and these guys always put love in this meal when it's prepared. Best service to date.
Ross H.,"Kaneohe, HI",79,23,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Oh man hold on to your hats, this is gonna be a good one.  Birthday week for mom, so decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for the 3rd dinner of the week. Stoked. Wife loves cheesecake!   Got there, was told it would be a 15 minute wait for 7 adults, 3 kids. No problem. Waited about that long and got sat. This is at about 7:30-745pm (10/28/17 Wednesday) so the place is not super busy. Server comes and takes our drink order and then brings our appetizers, drinks, and bread. Forgets a couple kids drinks and water. No big deal. Ask for it when our server comes back, but then is MIA for a good 10+ minutes.  Finally comes back with water and bread and takes our food order. MIA again for another chunk o' time.  Food comes out, one order has fries instead of salad, no problem. Beer order takes a bit longer than usual. Even worse, mom had to wait for 5-10 minutes for an extra plate we requested twice since she was just sharing. Asked once from the server when we ordered and another time from the runner.  Listen, I was a server at multiple spots and know how ""wonderful"" the job can be. So, I pull our food runner, yes we have lost track of our server again, and ask him if our server is new. He responds with, ""she has 3 sections of tables so she's in the weeds now"". Ok that sucks. Now I'm mad at the managers because not once did I see them throughout dinner. Yeah she could have said she was slammed and apologized, but instead chose the ""out of sight"" strategy.  As we finished up (food was actually really tasty!) now our server comes back, gives us boxes and bags, clears the table, brings our check, and takes the check to run it. All of a sudden I'm seeing our server every time I turn my head. How convenient.  Oh, I almost forgot. My mom got a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday. Not cheesecake. From the Cheesecake Factory. One, because they're apparently very cheap. Two, we couldn't be bothered to order one since we didn't have a server. Could've ordered more drinks too, but then again, would have needed a server with a normal amount of tables. Oh, we did get a, ""no cheesecake?"" question, but by then it was too late.  The kicker for this entire story? What? There's more? Yes. Yes there is.  My friend eating with us asked to speak to a manager, she was told they were in the kitchen and went there to find them swiping through photos on their phone. Got a lot of ""we're sorry"" and even better, ""where were you sitting?"" A half empty restaurant with managers not even walking through seeing how their servers, and more importantly, how their customers were doing is pretty ridiculous.  What was supposed to be a fun birthday dinner turned into a frustrating experience for all.  Never again. Super disappointed to say the least."
D S.,"Mississauga, Canada",4,139,79,3.0,7/5/2017,"Came here around when they first opened during lunch hours. Food was what I would expect from a CF, service was good too.  I would come back again when in the area."
Amanda N.,"Bay Shore, NY",61,2,,1.0,9/20/2017,Extremely long wait time. Poor service. I would recommend going to another location instead of this one.
Marilyn C.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",1,4,3,5.0,7/20/2017,"Went on a Wednesday at 8:50pm was seated quickly, wonderful waitress... very helpful and fast service. Ordered the crab wontons and shrimp Alfredo. Crab wontons honestly taste like hot tuna salad in a wonton lol but I was hungry so I enjoyed it  my main dish was shrimp Alfredo, I had better but it satisfied my craving. I gave this restaurant 5 stars mainly for the service... the food was 3 stars"
Dale J.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,3,3,2.0,10/10/2017,"Never available outside sitting- weather is nice- why not??? Lazy? Food- salad not fresh,like it dyed 3 days ago, other food- so greasy, unhealthy- U don't wonna eat it!!!"
Eugene D.,"East Islip, NY",0,4,2,1.0,11/12/2017,"Good Cheesecake.....THEY REST SUCKS..... Bad service, cold food and takes forever to get served... forever for cold food.... SMH....."
Kim P.,"West Sayville, NY",4,26,2,2.0,4/23/2017,"I woke up today and wanted pancakes. So did my boyfriend. We went to IHOP but it was crazy busy and this was in the same mall so I saw there was brunch and we went to cheesecake factory instead. This was my first time ever at this franchise. I saw pancakes and got them. My boyfriend also got the pancakes and eggs with bacon.  These were absolutely the worst pancakes I have ever had. How do you mess up pancakes? They were so greasy my stomach could not tolerate it. Also they were crispy... Crispy pancakes? Also the third one was on the burnt side (don't think I didn't notice that it was burnt just because it was hidden).  I just couldn't get over how greasy they were and how disappointed I was. My boyfriend said the same thing and also his eggs were ""ehh"". He wishes he made his own eggs.  I did bring a piece of cheesecake home and it was yummy so I added a star for that. Chris's outrageous cheesecake I think it was called.  Won't be back for breakfast (not that I really wanted to go there for breakfast).  Still confused about those pancakes.... Seems like they were fried in butter So gross!"
Natalie G.,"Central Islip, NY",25,92,52,1.0,6/23/2017,"Worst experience at Cheesecake Factory I've had yet. What a miserable time. We spent over an hour waiting for our food, we got here at 11 when it wasn't even busy. My husband's steak came out really dry, our food kind of cold, the whole time our waiter was awful, ignoring us, forgetting about us, downright not caring as he proceeded to walk around and joke with a large table and do nothing AFTER my husband asked why we had waited so long and he hadn't even checked on us. He took my husband's food back, left us waiting even longer. It got so bad we asked for the manager to pay for our drinks and leave. I couldn't even eat, and our date night was ruined. The manager wouldn't even hurry out to talk to us. They left us waiting so long we ended up walking out. No one cared. It was ridiculous."
Jackie B.,"Baldwin, NY",1,12,4,3.0,4/23/2017,The food is excellent but everything else is SO SLOW ughhhh. The food took forever.... waited 45 mins for our food. 10 mins for waitress to come back to tell her we needed silverware. Everything tasted excellent but 3 stars for the slow service  .
Natalia A.,"Copiague, NY",14,3,5,3.0,2/15/2017,"straight to the point.. it is a franchise restaurant but more fancy and PRICEY.. this was my first time and it was on valentine's day but I have heard that it is always packed so get prepared to wait for at least half an hour. Their specialty are pasta and i didnt know this until now, i wish I knew this because I got steak and even tho it wasnt that bad, it was not the best either, so next time I'll try some pasta to see. oh btw their fresh strawberry is to die for, definitely have to try it. im giving them 3 stars just because it was not the best service but I guess you cannot ask for too much on a day like valentines"
John H.,"Smithtown, NY",5,9,,1.0,7/14/2017,"This is three times that I have come to this location to take out food and three times I have stood by waiting to order my food and it has taken more than 5 minutes for them to acknowledge and service.  ALL three times I have walked out,  this place is unprofessional with terrible service, I do not recommend anyone to this location."
John S.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Extremely disappointed in my take out experience tonight. Called in an order for pickup in which the girl took my order repeated it back and said 25 minutes. We take the drive down to grab the food. My wife runs out gets the food and brings it to the car, in which she realizes they forgot an entree that apparently was never added to the check. She goes back in to get alert the person behind the counter who casually says ""oh it wasn't on the order"" We then proceed to wait and additional 20 minutes while they prepare the missing food all the while the rest of the order (1 entree, 1 appetizer) sit in the car getting cold. I'm in the business for about 17 years and I understand mistakes happen all the time, I am however extremely disappointed in the lack of urgency by the staff to correct this issue. Wasn't fishing for a discount (didn't receive one either) just wanted some urgency. So seeing that this ordeal took over an hour to solve I came home and had to reheat my meal and our appetizers. As a chef takeout sometimes provides a break from the kitchen I wasn't happy that I had to come home and cook my 60.00 meal over again. Please review customer service with your staff is all I ask in return. I'll be back but will be very hesitant to order takeout from this location."
Rob H.,"Coram, NY",39,3,,1.0,8/5/2017,"It was my first and last time to this location. We came to celebrate my sons birthday. The service was absolutely horrendous. I'm well aware that this is not a fine dining restaurant, but this was bad. We weren't checked for drink refills, the meals at the table were presented separately (5 minute gap from first to last). Waited over 10 minutes to have the table cleared. On top of that the food was sub par. This spot won't last with poor service like this."
Casey J.,"Copiague, NY",112,6,74,2.0,7/7/2017,Couldn't follow simple orders about our food and when we got the bill the pen they gave us to sign for our credit card bill with was from a PEST CONTROL company.
Khorena B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,10,5.0,6/12/2016,"I really love this Cheesecake Factory. My fiancé and I went last night for a nice dinner. The service was great and quick and our food was delicious, minus one small quirk. We ordered the Eggroll Sampler as our appetizer, and as much as I heard great reviews about these eggrolls, my fiancé and I didn't like the avocado tacos. My personal favorite was the Salmon Eggroll and the Cuban Eggroll. They were so delicious! The avocado and the other that I can't remember I didn't prefer.  For our meals he had the four cheese pasta with chicken and he loved it. I had the Farfelle Pasta (can't remember the rest of the name) but it was delicious. Everything was well season and tasted freshly made. We've been here tons of times and won't stop soon."
Kayla O.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,5,,5.0,7/8/2017,Love this place! Always friendly staff that are usually quick. Food always tastes great.
Katrina I.,"Lindenhurst, NY",84,58,70,4.0,3/3/2016,"Me and my best friend went on a girl date Sunday afternoon and wanted to have some lunch and do a little shopping. Usually we'd have to drive out to Lake Grove (far for us) to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. Fortunately, they opened this location.  My past experiences with this chain have not been the best. It could have been because I ordered the wrong things like spaghetti and Mexican food and the wait is always forever.. This time around I got smart and ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. At first i thought I'd go with buffalo, instead I chose to be a bit adventurous and get the Korean style served with a spicy Korean slaw and a side of sauce that I forget the name of. Doesn't matter what it was called, it was all delicious!! As far as authenticity it could have been more of a Korean American fusion dish since I'm not sure Korean culture makes fried chicken sandwiches (or do they?).  For dessert my bestie and I split a red velvet cheesecake. Yumm!! We ate so much food that afternoon that we skipped dinner. The only bad thing I have to say is that the service is really slow and the table next to us had a child who was acting up and it was annoying (he was a cutie though). This type of place so cranky toddlers are expected. Good experience."
