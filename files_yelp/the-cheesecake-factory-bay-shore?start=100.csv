Cw P.,"Central Islip, NY",0,9,1,4.0,7/30/2016,"I love The CheeseCake Factory, service and all, the only downside of it is that I can't go on a normal one hour lunch brake and expect to get back to work on time. It's not the service, most of the waiters are very attentive and friendly, get your drinks very quick along with the bread, but I have had issues a couple of times with the amount of time they take to prep your food. Anytime you plan to go, my personal suggestion would be to show up knowing that you will be there for AT LEAST one hour."
Danielle B.,"Babylon, NY",0,23,,3.0,11/1/2015,The menu is too long to take in. The fried zucchini sticks are great... as is the beet salad. Tiramisu is yellow cake! Dirty trick.
C.j A.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,18,3,5.0,8/1/2015,"Great food. Great service. Jessica, my bartender/server was friendly, knowledgeable and quick. Next time you're hungry  for a true omelette, a really good one... don't waste you time at a diner (blah)... go to Cheesecake Factory."
Ethel M.,"Levittown, NY",1,32,,2.0,9/7/2015,"The third time wasn't the charm. Our waitress got my drink order wrong, and didn't bring bread. When we finally managed to get her attention it was halfway through our meal, and after we asked for it, we waited quite a long time before she finally brought it. The pasta with shrimp, chicken and sausage was great the first two times I was there, blah the third time, and also had long stringy onions in the tomato sauce. Weird. Obviously a different chef."
Maria S.,"West Babylon, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Tonight we went to Cheesecake Factory in Bayshore to celebrate my son's birthday.  We had a very short wait before being seated at a table.  It was clear that the waitress was untrained and new.  Dinner took over 2 hours to be served.  We ordered an appetizer which we were told they didn't have quite some time after we ordered it.  Almost an hour after ordering our dinners I was told they didn't have the pasta dish I ordered.  We ordered dessert only to be told that the brownies were frozen so they couldn't be served but we could take them home if we wanted.  We asked for water that we never got.  We had to ask for bread a few times, sugar a few times and for spoons for our dessert.  Very odd that a chain restaurant could not serve three different items that we ordered.  Thankfully, the food we were served was tasty, but some of the portions were small for the price.  We will definitely hesitate to visit this location again.  The manager never came by to see how our meal was."
Yaojia Q.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",1,9,4,5.0,9/7/2015,"The food is really good, especially the avocado eggroll and chicken bellagio. The best chicken ever! The service is really good. Also the best tiramisu cheesecake!!"

Jennifer M.,"Brentwood, NY",53,59,44,3.0,3/11/2015,Three stars was given not for the food or service but the wait.  We got there at 6:15 asked for a table they said 30-50 minutes. I said great I can walk in the mall for awhile and go shopping.  We were in the mall for almost 1:45 minutes never got a text when I asked the hostess they gave me some bs that they over shot wait times. Needles to say we sat down at 8:30 with two children. We waited so long we went to Olive Garden and put our names in a wait list also but the cheesecake factory say us down first.  Food.  Was awesome.  We had cuban egg rolls Delish and fried fontina cheese. Delish as well.  My son had pasta and he ate it all. I had Mac and cheese burger and it was delish      Dessert was spectacular. Everyone got a different cake.  I got reeses cheesecake my son got red velvet cheesecake and my oldest got chocolate cake cheese cake my husband who's not a dessert  eater ate all his cake.  Price was very good.  The only thing j round change is the wait time other than that it's worth the visit.
Michael B.,"Sea Cliff, NY",0,5,,2.0,8/17/2015,"I must begin as other reviews stating that I love the Cheesecake Factory in the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington. I came here when it first opened and it was a little maniacal, but to be expected due to new everything. I am writing this at my table deciding if I will ever return.     Decided to sit outside and was seated at a table with my family with no utensils or plates. Waiter took my order while I was still missing utensils. Bread was dropped at the table, still no utensils. Finally broke down to ask for utensils. Got small plates and was a napkin short. This was after my appetizer was sitting on the table for five minutes.     I then explained to the waiter that we should start over, much to my wife's embarrassment. I had only ordered the crab cake appetizer and a salad. My salad came with no dressing whatsoever. I don't really blame it on this poor waiter. I think a lot of it has to do with bad management.     Anyone looking for that CF experience they are accustomed to then steer clear of the Bayshore branch. Next time I'll just take the ride to Huntington."
Cassie Z.,"Great River, NY",0,1,,2.0,5/3/2015,"I am not someone who will go out of their way to write a review, unless I really have a horrible experience. Let me start off saying, they have great food that is without a doubt, but their car-side to-go service is absolutely horrendous. It takes FOREVER for them to come out with the food, whether you call them once, or three times because you've been waiting for a half hour for your order. If I wanted to wait that long, I would've went inside to eat.  Again, I love their food, but that pick-up process needs to be fixed."
Frank D.,"Suffolk, NY",35,297,19,3.0,1/12/2015,"Buffalo Bites.  They are great.  Had the lemon meringue cheesecake, delicious.  Other than that, I haven't really been to cheesecake factory, so those are the only 2 things i can tell you about.  Those are delicious though."
Gary F.,"Freeport, NY",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"No Reservations... What?!? I was told to wait 'at least one hour' for a table because 'we do not take reservations. My party consisted of some elderly parents whom I will not subject to this kind of treatment... Period. Clearly, there are enough people who will stand for mistreatment and bad service that the Factory can afford to maintain their misguided policies. I will dine only at establishments that value their clientele. Not some 'Factory' that thinks of them as cattle. What a flawed way to run a restaurant! Sayonara Cheesecake Factory."
Nicholas P.,"Bay Shore, NY",25,5,,4.0,1/18/2015,Good food as always for thus chain...slow service with lots of waiters standing around...like a dozen.
Nicole K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,,1.0,1/4/2015,"I'd like to start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of cheesecake factory, having been to over ten different locations and receiving nothing but amazing food and service. My experience pertains to this Bay Shore location only and I would highly recommend any other location as one of my favorite restaurants.  I went out for a dinner with my friend last night and waited almost two hours, which of course was our choice. Upon getting seated, we waited quite a long time for someone to come over. Our server who wasn't particularly friendly took our order and never brought the usual bread. Our food came suspiciously quickly. (before the bread so we had to ask for it to eat with the meal out of order)....like 5 minutes quickly and made me feel like it was sitting under a food lamp or something weird. Boy was I right. After my friend had eaten half of her food, she pulls out a GIANT CLOTHING TAG that says ""Made In China"" that was mashed in with the potatoes! Seeing as this is one of the worst things that could happen at a restaurant short of a bug in your food, we thought the management would be taking it seriously. Our server blamed the kitchen, apologized and then we waited an unbelievable 30 minutes for a replacement. You would have thought this would be a priority to fix but no one cared. A manager came over and gave us a ""Guys I'm so sorry"" then never followed up once we got our replacement! You would think he would personally bring it out and that this would be customer service 101.... We then made friends with the table next to us who waited almost an hour for their food and then was brought the wrong dish 3 times in a row. She asked a manager for some cheese and then he never came back with it. We both thought it was a joke that night because everyone around us had everything possible going wrong. When we ordered dessert, no forks so we had to ask and wait again. Then our server came over and actually asked us if the manager said he would comp just the meal or the meal and the dessert! Um wouldn't you ask him directly? I absolutely couldn't believe that she asked us that and then had the nerve not to take the dessert off when we said he never mentioned anything about the bill.  I probably wouldn't have written this review if they had recovered properly with good customer service, follow up and compensation but that just was not the case. Now i""m left wondering what happens in that kitchen that allows clothing tags to fall into food. Their back of house operations are not on their feet and I would never come back here, though I feel if they get proper guidance and training, in a few months they may be able to work out the kinks.  Tip: Dig through your food for foreign objects before eating."
Felicia F.,"Massapequa Park, NY",4,1,,5.0,9/7/2015,"I'm a regular cheesecake goer. I usually go to the one out in smith town but I wanted to try this new location. At first i was greeted by the girls in the front who looked so confused. I told them we were a party of 5, they continued to stare at the computer but finally a blonde girl spoke up staying the wait is only 10 minutes handed me a pager and a menu and told me to have a seat and they let us know when the table is ready. When our pager went off at exactly 10 minutes, I went right up to the blond girl and handed her my pager she told me that a host will be right with me. The other girls continued to stand there giggling about something. I was very impressed by this blond she took control telling the others to stop. Cheesecake should make sure all the hires are like her.  When we finally sat outside, we were waiting for our waitress for a while. I wanted to sit outside because the furniture is so comfortable but I was getting annoyed with the lack of service. I sent my child in to ask the blonde where our waitress was. She said she would send someone over. Within a minute the manager came over. A very young red head, she greatly apologized for our missing waitress and said she'd be happy to take our drink order and get us some bread. When she came back with drinks and bread I told she we're ready to order but still haven't seen our waitress. She apologized again and told us that she was going to take care of us. As we say waiting for our food we noticed the other waitresses looked a little lost. They would just stand at the end of the patio. I don't blame the manager she tried so hard to keep us and everyone happy but the staff didn't seem to care.  Our food was amazing and I would come back in a heart beat if the manager come help us again. She was a great lady and they are lucky to have her.  My only suggestion to the management me corporate is hire new staff they just our bringing you down!"
Kevene B.,"West Babylon, NY",0,5,3,1.0,3/20/2015,"This was by far the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. I came here with my fiancé hoping to have a nice night out and in return I left very disappointed. We ate at the bar and started off with an order of calamari. It took 24 mins exact to receive our starter. After we finished our appetizer we then asked the manager for some bread because our entrees were taking a long time and he told us he would get it right away. After 10 minutes, I asked the bartender if she could get us bread and she apologized and came back with cold, hard bread. Meanwhile, the customers next to us were complaining about a fly floating in their beverage. We proceeded to telling her after waiting for our food another 30 minutes, which never came; that we would like to speak to the manager. I explained to the manager our service issues and not once did he apologize or offer a solution, instead he explained he never brought the bread out because it was cold, so I told him I would just like the check and the food would no longer be necessary. The restaurant was absolutely not busy, so there was no excuse for the lengthy time wait for the food. This was by far unacceptable. We will NEVER return to this location."
Velvet P.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,11,,2.0,8/20/2015,"So not worth it! Waiting for a larger group. Brought food out one or 2 plates at a time, food would be cold by the time our entire group got plates."
Stephanie J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2015,"BLACK PEOPLE BEWARE!!!! Walked in on Monday around 4:30 pm with my friend. We had to wait 5mins to be seated because the hostess was having a full blown conversation at the bar. Waiter gives us menus we order nonalcoholic drinks. New waitress (Christin) comes with no explanation about what happened to the pervious one, we placed our orders with her. Then the manager (Eric)comes and informs us we couldn't order what we placed while he made some recommendations he kept reiterating an extra charge would be made for some things we wanted. We placed our new order with him. 2 mins later the waitress walks over and asked for us to place our orders again with her. A Caucasian family is seated right next to us and was served bread onced their orders were placed. We look around and see everyone has bread on their table besides us. After placing our orders twice with the manager and waitress, my meal comes out first while my friend had to wait an additional 10mins. At this point we where beyond frustrated and deeply saddened by the type of service we experienced at a well established business. We sent the food back and asked for the manager who didn't even give us her name until we asked for it. She tried to make it better by offering us free meals but we weren't looking for handouts. I paid for my side order since I started eating it and she insisted we at least take dessert because it was my friend's birthday. Just simply appalled and disgusted by the service that I wouldn't want another African American individual or family to experience."
Stacys M.,"Massapequa Park, NY",1,8,1,4.0,1/12/2015,"its pretty good, Love there bloody mary and chicken and waffles, waiter was very friendly."
