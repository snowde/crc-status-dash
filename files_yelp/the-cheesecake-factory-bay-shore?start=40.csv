Mary Lou C.,"West Islip, NY",73,11,1,1.0,5/29/2017,"We waited 25 minutes for a table & they were not crowded.  When we finally did sit it was another 30 minutes before we saw a waitress. Gave our orders, 40 minutes later we were served cold food. Bonus, the order was wrong. This location needs better management. Will not be going there again."
Cindy T.,"Clinton, CT",239,174,421,4.0,9/25/2016,"My boyfriend & I went there for dinner on Friday evening September23rd,2016. We got there probably around 9:30pm & the place was extremely busy. They have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in many many years. They have a very large extensive menu. You can get breakfast items all day long which is wonderful! They serve bread as soon as you arrive. He had been their for his 1st time the weekend before w/ his kids for one of daughters birthday... so he decided to order the same thing The Smokehouse BBQ Burger. Course it took me quite a while to decide what I wanted I went back & forth debating between many things. I ended up on a cheeseburger and instead of getting french fries you can get a side salad at no extra charge. You can tell that the cheeseburgers are made fresh they're not frozen. They offered to bring you more bread if you want it we declined. We didn't wait too too long but it was probably 15 minutes since everything is made fresh. The burgers were absolutely delicious! They were humongous as well and I had asked to have the tomato & lettuce on the side which they did do & the burgers were cooked to the way they were ordered. Of course I can only eat 1/2 of mine & took the other half to go. And ordered cheesecake to go I ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I had an unsweetened iced tea & he had 2 Heinekens. The bill came to about $52.00 Our waitress was very nice but a bit flighty. Overall very good experience. Another good thing is they have smaller portion menu people who may be on a diet for don't want such a large portion when ordering the Lord's dinners for specialty meals. He couldn't believe the size of some of the meals I saw were coming out. Since you're not sitting in a booth the tables for 2 are very close to each other. The restaurant people I say they probably have at least 15 waitstaff on & 2-3 people greet & seat people. Saw several busybody plus they have people who work behind the take-out area for people coming in just to purchase cheesecake. They also have tables outside for eating. But when we came in at that time they were closing down that area. Average price of what is $6.95 -$7.95....HUGE PIECES enough to share"
Scott W.,"Ashland, KY",0,88,92,4.0,5/15/2017,Ordered their special bacon bacon burger & fries. It was delicious. Had the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake ... 5 stars. Had 9 guest at our table & the service was great.
Karla R.,"Brentwood, NY",227,51,24,2.0,9/19/2015,"I like to think of The Cheesecake Factory as a premium chain, as the options are more upscale and varied than most other chains that are available in my area. I have usually enjoyed my experience here, but upon my visit with some coworkers recently I was let down. I'll give it two stars because the chicken lettuce wraps were light and delicious. One of the people in my party was served a dirty glass. Another person in my party asked for Splenda and a knife immediately when we got there, only to ask twice more and the Splenda and knife to finally arrive when we were already having appetizers. We were the only party in the entire restaurant. I had the Steak Diane and Herb-Crusted Salmon combination. It was a nice portion and the dish was okay. The salted caramel cheesecake dessert wasn't that good either.  It's not a bad place to have dinner, but at those prices I'd pay a little more and go somewhere with better service and food."
Brienna P.,"Holbrook, NY",43,2,,1.0,4/5/2017,"We just had the worst experience here, first we didn't get any bread, which is minor I'm willing to look past that. However the waitress disappeared for about 30 minutes, my drink was empty and we waited patiently for her to come back so we could ask for the check. Meanwhile I'm parched and ready to leave. She finally appears, we pay and we are out. Now I have to go to a 7-11 to get a drink before I become dehydrated."
R J.,"Smithtown, NY",1,6,,3.0,12/11/2016,"My BFF and I went the Cheesecake factory to get desert. I got the key lime cheesecake it wasn't creamy it was thick and gooey I was disappointed. Also got the carrot cake it looked so good, looks aren't everything both could've been a lot better!! Especially for the money they are charging..."
Vincent B.,"Harrison, NJ",0,2,,1.0,12/12/2016,"horrible experience for my Mothers Bday12/10/16 ! daughter asked for coke which took 20 mins, and server forgot her appetizer (mac&cheese balls) . Mother asked for med/rare steak, and it was well done. Daughter ordered fettuccini alfredo and it tasted like garlic sauce, horrible. ordered 2-cappucinos which were lukewarm at best, and server forgot take-out piece of cheesecake until reminded. Server and manager at the time were advised of all these problems and all that was done was fettuccini entrée which was returned was taken off the bill. Being a former manager in the restaurant industry ( Bertucci's), this was a total embarrassment at a cost of $250.00, and to not even be offered some kind of guest comp was further salt in the wound."
C. P.,"North Babylon, NY",2,17,5,1.0,6/17/2017,"I really love the Cheesecake Factory. I feel that everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong coming here! But after last night, oh wow. I have never been to this location before but I had shopping to do, and The Cheesecake Factory was convenient right next to the mall. For a Friday at 7pm I was seated within 10mins and we were quickly greeted by our waiter. I love the Cheesecake Factorys bread that they give, it is different and yummy, well after sitting for some time we see everyone with bread baskets. Especially our waiter bringing them to his other tables. Drinks and appetizers came out. Right before our entrees came out I asked for bread and he looked at me with a confused look as if he had forgotten it... he came back with a bread basket and said he was sorry that he was waiting to give us ""fresh"" bread. While putting the bread on the table all the butter packets that he had on a saucer fell into my food.. oye. All I can say it I will take the extra time and drive to the one in Melville!"
Grace W.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,9,1,1.0,10/16/2016,"The service is absolutely terrible!  I've tried both dine in and take out. A colleague and I came in for lunch and we waited forty-five minutes for beverage orders to be taken, we ended up ordering the food to go as we didn't know how long it would take to come out.  On another occasion, my fiancé had ordered a steak medium rare and it came out well done and over cooked.  The waitress' response was they don't cook steak medium rare, it's up to the cook.  For ordering take out, the staff says it'll be twenty minutes - on four separate occasions I've waited in excess of an hour for two Items.  When calling to place the order, one typically ends up on hold for ten minutes. The pricing of the items is not worth the quality of the food.  The staff is antisocial and not friendly.  They make customers feel unwelcome.   I will not be coming back, I kept thinking it would et better after they'd worked out the kinks.  This hasn't happened."
Jim G.,"Lindenhurst, NY",45,8,,2.0,9/30/2016,Appetizers were great Grilled Artichoke Ahi Tuna appetizer were very good. The Ahi Tuna Salad plate on the entrée was another can of fish. It was probably made earlier in the day and stuck in the fridge. Tasteless and there was nothing on the plate. Asked for Wasabi and I might as well had been asking for some alien condiment. She had no idea what I was talking about. Forget dressing on the salad as well. Manager was nice enough to take off the entrée.. but... Never going back....
Stephanie L.,"North Babylon, NY",92,204,94,2.0,6/16/2015,"HELLO - Management staff! - Get your stuff together!!!  What should have been a quick and painless dinner on a Friday night for a couple turned into a complete disaster! Explain to me exactly how long it takes to make 2 pasta dishes?? - Should it take over 45 minutes after appetizers are served?? I'm talking PASTA here... not kill the cow and hand cut me a steak!! Cooking 2 pasta dishes shouldn't take the entire length the WHOLE dining experience should have taken! - PATHETIC!  Add to this that a 4 top table was open next to us for over 25 minutes, meanwhile there was OVER an HOUR long wait to get a table when we were exiting at close to 9pm on a Friday night!! I had to fight a mob scene just to leave this disaster!!  Word to the wise - just come here and pick up cheesecake and eat it at home. If you're at all daring, you may want to consider having an Asian Pear Martini (which is why this is 2 stars and not just 1...) and then getting your cheesecake to go, but as far as returning and having another meal here, I THINK NOT!  FOS - get your act together!"
Elijah L.,"Bay Shore, NY",144,6,,1.0,1/15/2017,This location is very u professional and very unorganized  you don't want to work here trust me! They can't even handle phone calls or giving the right pasta to the right dish
Carol D.,"Henderson, NV",71,15,2,1.0,7/3/2017,"Salad came out without chicken, complained and they didn't believe me. Dug through my salad twice looking for it in front of me. Eventually went to get me some from the kitchen, came out half an hour later and I had already picked through most of my salad. When I complained about how long it took to the manager ""Omar"" he said ""would you rather I have served you raw chicken so you can get sick"" and literally YELLED at me for complaining. I argued right back and eventually he agreed to remove the salad from the check but I've never experienced worse customer service than this. Horrible."
Katherine S.,"Brentwood, NY",29,36,102,4.0,11/1/2016,"Basic Cheescake Factory, they are all pretty much the same. Stay away at lunch time on the weekend dinner time if you don't want to wait. Food and service meets the standard. Best thing is always the variety of cheesecake..."
Jude R.,"Bay Shore, NY",17,191,32,3.0,9/29/2015,"I struggled a bit with the rating, but ultimately settled on a 3 overall.  Here's why: Restaurant:  2 Stars:  Location is new and looks well maintained.  Unfortunately both place settings were dirty with food particles stuck to silverware and greasy flatware.  I find this disgusting and almost left at this point.  This is just sloppy customer service. Server: Brianna - 5 Stars:   Service was prompt, efficient and courteous while not rushed.  Brianna also offered honest suggestions with a sense of humor. Food:  3.5 Stars: The food was well prepared and served hot.  My wife really enjoyed the burger and the gluten free bun.  It was cooked well done but not DEAD!  The coffee was hot but very bland and the first cup was clearly stale (at 12:00pm).  I had the Cuban, and while it was fresh and very well made, the taste was overwhelmed but a far too heavy hand with the yellow mustard.  This took away from what could have been a great sandwich. So overall, just over 3 stars, but not good enough (or clean enough) to warrant 4.  I will try it again."
Matthew A.,"Brightwaters, NY",78,44,33,2.0,4/30/2015,"The cheesecake factory is difficult for me to put a finger on. It's overtly commercialized - they are everywhere,  and they have ADS on their MENU for crying out loud. It's expensive for a chain restaurant, but the menu is large and it's almost always quite good.   My original thought was that it's a place that hires cooks (I wouldn't venture to say chefs) that give a crap about what goes on the plate and pay attention to detail.   That all went to hell when I came to this location. I'll spare the description of decor or ambiance - almost everyone knows it. If you don't,  picture a hotel bar mixed with a casino buffet. This place is huge,  it has to easily sit 100 at a glance,  and the kitchen looks tremendous. Staff is running about everywhere and everyone was reasonably nice.  Here's the thing though,  keeping in mind what I said before about good food and consistently prepared by people who care.  We ordered nachos with spicy chicken,  normally quite good but this time temperature inconsistent in a strange way. As if it was baked in an unevenly heated oven. Some chips burned some cold,  some cheese melted some congealed.  I ordered chicken teriyaki which came as a split chicken breast -  which is fine although not described as such -  it also came with pineapple slices brown rice and what seemed like grilled bananas - which was a nice surprise and all welcome additions. The chicken however? If I had to hazard a guess based on my own experience that thing hit 190 degrees before it was pulled out. In other words,  very,  very overdone and tough.  Steak Diane at the table ordered medium was well done to the point of being difficult to cut. Jamaican shrimp was the only thing cooked decently but it was haphazardly doused in an overwhelming large amount of sauce that while good,  made us wish we had a water bath for the shrimp because it was so overpowering.  The cheesecake was of course,  delicious,  although at $8 a slice it better be.  Service was OK. Nothing to write home about,  didn't always have drinks,  didn't check up on us,  but the timing worked so it didn't bother us too much.  So,  at least here the cooks don't know what's going on. Maybe you can chalk it up to growing pains but it absolutely irks me to no end when people get simple things like properly cooking or dressing your dish. That's the EASY part. Ladle less sauce,  use a meat thermometer if you're unsure. It's not rocket science. It reeks of laziness.  If if I go to Applebee's, Fridays or some other forgettable restaurant and I'm paying $20 for an app and two entrées then I'll be more forgiving with preparation. But when I'm paying $20 for a chicken breast or $25 for cubed steak at least have the decency to cook it correctly.  I expect more from cheesecake factory. I wince at writing this and giving them two stars,  because I've had considerably better experiences at other locations,  and consistently so, but at every turn I was not happy here so I have to tell it like it is.  I'd avoid this particular location for a season or two until they get their quality control in order and their cooks learn how to do what they were hired to do."
Eileen O.,"Bay Shore, NY",72,43,24,1.0,9/16/2016,"Had appetizers, but didn't stay to order dinner after seeing the 400 or so flies behind the glass separating the booths and the kitchen (the flies were on the kitchen side of the restaurant).  Flies of all varieties and sizes were all over the top of the glass and on the soffit. We won't be back until they get their sh*t together!"
Matt C.,"New York, NY",0,10,,1.0,7/10/2017,"Walked in and was greeted by the hostess.  She sat my girlfriend and I at a table.  We sat there for 20 minutes, watching a group of 5 servers or so standing in the middle of the restaurant talking.  No one came up to us.  We got up and walked out to leave.  As we passed the same hostess who just sat us 20 minutes prior...she looked at us and smiled and said ""have a nice day, thank you.""   Clueless."
Beatrice S.,"Lindenhurst, NY",4,29,,1.0,8/11/2016,"Horrifc experience!!! The waitress was not attentive and spilled food all over the table, didn't even clean it, JUST LEFT!! Are you serious ??? Asks us eating to hand her the menus, leaving her hand out as if we have to help her!!??? WHAT???And her name was BRENDA as well so beware!!! Extremely rude and disgusting food too. The food was leafy and strange.... Bad salads ! Tortilla hidden under the salad!!!! BURNT CHICKEN TOO. GROSS!!! Never again will I go here!"
Nicole M.,"Holbrook, NY",13,15,,3.0,6/6/2017,"Came here last Sunday. We were a party of 9 which included 3 kids in high chairs. My mom called before we got there to ask how long the wait was because we know it's tricky with the high chairs. Two weeks before we went and we're told by the hostess that we ""shouldn't even bother waiting because it would be over 2 hours"" this time when calling She specifically told them about the high chairs. They told her that it would be a 15 minute wait. We got there 10 minutes later and the hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us. She then asked the manager who rolled his eyes and told her It's going to be an hour. This was in the middle Of the afternoon at 2:30! They made no attempt to keep tables open so that us as a large party could be accommodated faster. We watched as people came and went. Finally we were the only ones waiting. Finally over an hour and 15 later we were seated. Our food came out over cooked and almost inedible. This restaurant does not seem to care to accommodate kids which is unfortunate because we enjoy going to CF"
