Jeff L.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,3,,2.0,6/22/2017,Slow service.  Second time and severely dissapointed with the service staff.  Almost three hours and saw our server 3 times...
Elizabeth T.,"Levittown, NY",0,23,3,2.0,5/8/2017,"After standing at the front door for 10 minutes and the woman at the bar avoiding eye contact with us we finally asked if anyone would be able to seat us. So with an eye roll she sits us with no word.  We sit with no sign of a waiter when he finally comes it takes him another 20 minutes to get us water, utensils and bread. The food was good this review is solely for management. The service was slow and it was 4pm on a Monday, no lunch no dinner rush how is it that slow?! Why isn't anyone walking around to help out your understaffed waiters? Now for the reason why I'm writing this review....THE BATHROOM. I have never taken photos and posted them on Yelp but corporate and management need to see how disgusting their restroom is where staff and customers come to wash hands etc. Very disappointing when you go to use the restroom at a restaurant and it looks like it hasn't been cleaned the entire day. We will not be going back to this Cheesecake Factory, the whole experience was not pleasant!"
Anthony O.,"Long Island, NY",793,86,761,4.0,1/7/2015,"I decided to give this new one a shot for Sunday brunch. First thing I loved, the doors were actually unlocked when they are supposed to be! I have been to the other 3 locations on the island and they NEVER open on time. I always have to call them, and yes they are on speed dial! This one has a nice modern twist on the typical cheesecake factory design. We were seated promptly and our waitress Gianna followed shortly. She was very friendly.  We ordered the sausage ricotta flat bread & Chicken Maderia. The flat bread came out hot & fresh. It was delish. For the Chicken Maderia me and my cohort got the same. We always get it with carrots instead of mashed potatoes. Gotta save some calories for the desserts LoL! The dishes came out great, and unlike the other 3 locations, a cook in the kitchen didn't dump a 5lb container on the carrots!  So for dessert we split the banana cream cheesecake and that was delish as well. I can say this is my new favorite cheesecake factory for Sunday brunch!"
Sara M.,"Bay Shore, NY",161,21,12,3.0,4/19/2016,"I enjoy Cheesecake Factory, they have an extensive menu and an attentive staff. Every time I've went I've had good service and the food has always came out at a decent time. They have great nachos and I also love their desserts and pasta dishes. Most nights there is a wait, but it goes pretty fast"
Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",388,384,1085,3.0,11/29/2015,"Today was a weird day at the Cheesecake Factory.  We arrived around 2pm and it wasn't busy but we were required to wait about 15 minutes. It wasn't a big deal, but when we were seated and half the dining room was empty we found the wait completely unnecessary. Our waiter was very friendly. He checked on us semi regularly and didn't push us to order quickly. He did forget to bring bread after he asked us twice if we wanted it and a table of a party larger than us had their order taken and their appetizers well before we got ours.  For appetizers we got the Buffalo chicken blasts, the loaded potato tots, and the portobello-zucchini-avocado fries. All of the appetizers were delicious. Portions were very large for the price. And they were all piping hot when they arrived. The dipping sauces for the fries were excellent and their blue cheese dressing was superb.  Now here is where things get a little dicey. It took me about 15 minutes to finally decide what to order for my entree. You're probably thinking it's because there's a million things on the menu and that's only half true. The other reason is because I am making a commitment to be eating this meal at least 3 times due to the massive (and much appreciated) portion size. So I landed on the chicken and biscuits. A few moments later our waiter came by to break the news that they were all out of chicken biscuits. I was shocked because that's never happened to me before at a Cheesecake Factory. But I picked the farfalle pasta without tomatoes as my entree instead.  Our appetizers were still on our table when our food arrived. There was no room to move. There were also all our dirty dishes and cutlery that needed to be removed before eating our entrees. That was pretty annoying to be honest. I feel like our waiter spent more time with other tables and paid no attention to ours.  When my entree hit the table I immediately noticed there were tomatoes. I asked for the waiter to bring the menu over again as he told me he'd have the kitchen ""pick out the tomatoes"" for me. I didn't want anyone handling my food that way. If it wasn't a big deal to me I would have eaten around it but the way he said it was so off-putting.  The manager then came over to check in on me. I didn't complain. I just started that I wanted to pick a different meal since they didn't have the entree I first chose. He immediately gave me a look of concern and asked which meal I had initially ordered. He went to the kitchen and had them prepare me the meal I wanted and was so nice in the process.  Finally after most of my table was finished with their meal mine arrive. I was very pleased with my food but I hated having to eat while everyone was already finished.  We ordered 2 cheesecakes to go and I wrapped up my food. We paid and left. The whole process of this meal took about 2 hours. It was far too long and unnecessarily complicated. But I do love the Cheesecake Factory and I'd come to this location again because the management was so thoughtful."
Greg M.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,2,,3.0,10/23/2016,"I order my food and after it being served to me cold it was taken back and then the manager comp the plate and was very nice they make you feel at home .the only complaint I have Is the music is so loud that you can't hear the person your with speak,but orther wise the place is great.."
Keith G.,"Woodbury, NY",0,1,,2.0,1/20/2017,Food is always good here but service is something that needs serious help. As a chain restaurant and the amount of training that they provide management really needs to step up there game.  Bartender takes a drink that was not finished and apologized but never offers to replace. Was almost down right rude and said oh I seen two glasses I assumed it was done.  Yeah second glass was water.  Apparently customer service is not there focus.
Nick S.,"Lake Peekskill, NY",0,1,,5.0,9/29/2016,"Food and wine was outstanding as usual but the service was even better! My girlfriend and I had Steve as our waiter twice and was extremely friendly, on top of our table and recommended the Nutella cheesecake which was delicious. I have never had a better waiter than Steve in my life. Highly recommend it here!"
Duane S.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,220,1276,4.0,1/17/2015,"""Timing is everything"" should've the second half of the Cheesecake Factory name.. In the past, We'd just walk by the locations due to the huge amounts of people waiting. finally tho, gave in and made a real attempts to go. First attempt, 80 mins wait..  BYE! Second attempt, 15 mins, which was reasonable, so here we go..  Huge menu, very diner-esque with unique & interesting dishes sprinkled throughout. The food was excellent, especially considering this is a franchise chain. Will definitely be back! The dessert menu is just as huge - 35 types of cheesecakes, PLUS a few other goodies. Our excellent server Britany advised us to choose by type of cheesecake we liked - creamy, or more like a drier, firm consistency.. We're creamy lovers, The Snickers Bar Cheesecake was outrageous!!  Would be solid five star if the wait times were more reasonable.. When leaving mid afternoon, crowd thinned out considerably, so 3-4 pm on weekdays may be just my next visit!"
Sara S.,"Massapequa Park, NY",4,97,5,3.0,9/29/2015,"I LOVE the Cheescake Factory but this location disappoints. The service is on the slow side and the portions seem smaller than at other branches. Many people complain about CF's huge portion sizes but I love leftovers! On LI, Westbury location is the best followed by Huntington. Still, they get a 3 star rating because I'm a sucker for the Thai lettuce wraps, Santa Fe salad and chicken madiera. They do have a nice outdoor ""living room"" seating area."
Tony K.,"Hicksville, NY",10,29,7,2.0,5/30/2016,"Normally, I would expect a high franchise such as Cheesecake Factory to use fresh ingredients. This started when my date & I came after 8pm for dinner. We ordered the hamburger with portobello mushroom.  At first bite, we knew this was not fresh. If you don't get distracted by the esthetic and lights, this is a small square footage restaurant. It's not worth your time and money."
Michele L.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",120,119,164,5.0,7/7/2015,"Well well well...a cheesecake factory with cellphone reception possible within! That is a good thing.  I came for lunch with my daughter my aunt and my sister. Parking is much better here than the smithaven mall location for sure. The place is new and clean and we were seated right away. The decor is similar to other locations but slightly different. I have to say our waitress Victoria was just so sweet and had really great knowledge of what was good. Dealing with my aunt who can be very indecisive (yet adorable and cute) when it comes to ordering, can be a challenge on the patience of a busy waitress. Her handling of my aunt and her million questions followed by a story was perfect, and we were able to get an order in record time  (for this pack of ladies) One of the suggestions she made was to try the sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo which the sound of made me like ughh..but she said ..""no trust me try it I ate them for dinner last night in fact I eat them every chance I get thats how good they are""   I found this very funny and I did what she said. Man they were so good I had a mouth gasm. Really though...I would never pick that for myself. Everything else came out in a very timely fashion and was all cooked perfectly. My lunch entree was herb crusted salmon (13.95) and it was great. My aunt said her grilled salmon was the best salmon she has ever eaten. I have to say that of all the chain restaurants this place is definitely winning the race. The prices are all competitive to the other places in its category and the food is so good so for what it is at this particular location, it deserves 5 stars."
Marie C.,"Queens, NY",280,134,139,3.0,9/11/2015,"Came for an early dinner on a Sunday. Super extensive menu, there were just so many options. I ended up getting chicken in a lemon butter sauce with mash potatoes and broccoli. It was edible, but I could have made it better at home. No one at the table loved their food, it was all just OK. Mama always said the smaller menu, the better the food. The hubby's food took about an hour to come out and the waitress was apologetic, but apologies don't go very far when you're starving and the rest of the table is eating. I ended up sharing my food with him. I've only been to cheesecake factory once before and had a great experience, so I won't write them off totally but I'll never go to this location again."
Kelly B.,"New York, NY",2,57,147,3.0,4/8/2016,"Came for a quick lunch and ordered a few of the small plates and everything came out pretty good. The Cubano rolls & Tuna Tartar were my favorite , the fried macaroni & cheese was ok but a  bit to much breading for me."
Vivek M.,"San Diego, CA",6,26,15,3.0,7/16/2016,"Had been here on my way back home from the Robert Moses park and beach with my friends. We got the veggie burger, eggplant Parmesan and the red velvet cheesecake. The food was good with decent portions. The decor of this place is good too. However, the service was just ok. We were kept waiting for a while (around 15-20mins) between the appetizers and the entrée. Similarly, we had to wait a while after the desserts for the payment process. I would give a 4 for the food/decor and a 2.5 for the service."
Amanda M.,"Sayville, NY",0,13,,2.0,1/15/2017,"While I am normally a HUGE fan of the Cheesecake Factory I have had several disappointing meals at this particular location. On one occasion I ordered the grilled artichoke and it was ice cold in the middle, on another occasion I waited over 15 minutes to place a drink order and there were only about 6-7 tables seated (it was 3pm) that same occasion I was brought the wrong meal. Another trip there resulted in my order which was ordered gluten free arriving to me with flour on it. The staff typically seems very friendly but they need to be educated on the dangers of food allergies and the kitchen staff needs to be more mindful of what they are putting out to the tables. I will not go back here."
Felipe F.,"Bay Shore, NY",47,2,1,1.0,7/15/2016,"Very very disappointed! I always had amazing experience every time that I went to a Cheesecake factory! This time was a disaster! Very very poor service! I had to stand and walk around looking for someone twice to get someone to help us. When the food finally came my salad was missing and it took more five minutes to someone show up with my salad. Bill and box to go I had to ask for the hostess! Water, I don't even know if they remember that give water to a costumer is the minimum. The worst part? The restaurant was EMPTY! Never coming back to this branch! Shame for this big company!"
Maynor M.,"Long Beach, NY",0,3,,4.0,6/8/2016,"Me and my family went last Sunday for brunch  and we have only good things to say.  Great and friendly  service from our waitress  , good food and the place looks superb! We'll be back and ask for our favorite  server Loraine .Thank you!"
Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",205,177,349,3.0,8/15/2015,"Am I the only one who feels like it's really dark in here? Like, really, really dark. I could barely see my brother and he was right across from me. BUT I've never had an issue what the food here and the prices are decent, sometimes a little overpriced depending on what you get. What I like about this location is that they text you when your table is ready (not sure if the Smith Haven mall location does it, haven't been there since this one opened) so that you can walk around the mall until your table is ready. My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese but I really love macaroni and cheese so it's hard for me to not like it. Two things I wasn't crazy about were the cajun jambalaya pasta and Chris' outrageous cheesecake which is like brownie, chocolate cake, and coconut-pecan but it was just too much and I felt like the flavors didn't mesh well together. I'm looking forward to trying their Sunday brunch one of these weekends though."
Kasey L.,"Long Beach, NY",0,22,1,3.0,9/15/2016,I've been a few times and while the food is fine I've had weird servers my last two visits. One night the server sat at our table with us and acted like he knew us which I think is weird and uncomfortable. I know that the Cheesecake Factory does want you to be overly friendly as a server but I really hate it. My last visit I saw a server pouring alcohol from the bottle into his mouth behind the glass window thing where the server stations are. Drinking at work is whatever when you're a server but don't let customers see you drinking liquor from a bottle that you then bring back to the bar. Really really unprofessional.
