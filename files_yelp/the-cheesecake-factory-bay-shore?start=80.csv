Crystal V.,"Brentwood, NY",0,4,,1.0,8/22/2016,"My husband and I went in to have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Bay Shore. It took the host a minute or two to get us seated. Once we sat, we waited over fifteen minutes and were never greeted. A table who got sat 10 minutes after us was greeted first. My husband and I walked out and went elsewhere. I definitely won't be returning to that location. The manager at that location needs to be advised that their servers aren't delivering quality hospitality to their guests."
Walter M.,"Bay Shore, NY",34,207,5,4.0,1/1/2015,"Whoever designed the new Cheesecake Factory at the Westfield Mall in Bay Shore should be given a large bonus. Unmistakably CF it is at the same time modernized and new. Absolutely a beautiful restaurant and a terrific use of space. The menu and food is standardized - but at a high level. Everything eaten was prepared properly, looked good, and tasted better. Prices are moderate and I always feel that I am getting good value. The servers are still learning, but everyone we dealt with was cheery and trying to please. Our meal was not without a problem or two, but this is to be expected when a restaurant has only been open for two weeks.  Bottom line - a great addition to the Bay Shore restaurant scene."
Denise M.,"West Islip, NY",0,30,1,4.0,4/18/2015,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory at this location 5 times now. One time during the week for dinner, and 4 times for lunch. We tried one time to get in for dinner and were given a 3 hour wait. We ended up going elsewhere and were home watching tv when we got texted that our table was ready, lol.  The decor in this restaurant is very nice. Although I am not fond of how close some of the tables are next to each other. Sometimes there's not enough room to stretch out, and you feel like you are invading your neighbor's conversation if you look their way, since the seating is so close. The waiter are pretty attentive. The ones that I've had were pretty knowledgeable about the menu, and if they didn't know they went quickly to find out. The server also commented on choices or things that would go well together. Since I like to order some small plates, that was helpful for me. The food was delicious every time I had visited. Its fun seeing how its presented, and the flavors just pop in your mouth. Save room for cheesecake. I usually don't have any room, but sometimes I take a few slices home to share with the hubby and kids. We get a few different ones and enjoy them all.  I am so happy with this new location. However, I would really like to be able to have dinner here without the long wait. At the time I tried they had no reservations because they were too new. That was the reason for one star off. A place like this needs to take reservations."
Amanda C.,"Bay Shore, NY",148,13,,5.0,12/6/2015,"My boyfriend and I just love this place! We have both ordered out several times and have dined in. Some of the other reviews about lack of healthy portions baffle me. It's always more than enough and we can't finish our meal. Everyone is super friendly and the food is always delicious. Our server tonight , Travis went above and beyond and was constantly at our table attending to us even though the place was packed."
Beth L.,"Bellmore, NY",278,556,475,4.0,1/9/2015,"If you think this place is expensive you're an idiot. Its CCF they all open on time and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake is on point. Sara is the best server by far there. Hope it doesn't go downhill like the Westbury location did. Wear your kevlar to that one,,,scary."
Toniann B.,"Lindenhurst, NY",13,17,19,5.0,5/27/2015,The avocado egg rolls are AMAZING!!! A must for an appetizer! Food is always great here and the service is also!
Joann F.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,25,,5.0,10/25/2016,One of my favorite places to eat! Love their trimosui cheese cake they have.  Their grilled chicken cesar salad and American bbq burger is great there.  Never had an unpleasant experience at this location.  Waits are to be expected during weekends.
Tomeka R.,"Bay Shore, NY",11,7,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Let me start this review by saying, I have been to several Cheesecake Factories and Grand Lux Cafes for brunch and have never been disappointed until today. The service here is awful!!  We were seated for over 20 min before we were even offered water. The table next to me waited even longer. There were a bunch of waiters just roaming around talking to each other and not paying attention to the customers at all.  When we were finally waited on, the waitress had no real knowledge of the brunch drink options. It took several tries before we could get a drink. However, the food was very good.  Not saying I would never come back to this location, but certainly isn't at the top of my list."
Miss Y.,"East Islip, NY",15,86,15,4.0,1/8/2015,"Normally I don't go for chain restaurants, seriously they are just over priced and everything comes in pre mixed - no bueno.  However, the Cheesecake factory is fantastic, I am obsessed with the large menu and I try to have something new every time.   The staff at this location is great - love the bartenders Matt was a sweetheart and I wish I remembered the girl that was there right before him same shift because she was also awesome.  As were both of them with drink making.   Buffalo bites are a MUST try if you like spicy food, there are many of them so if you're not sharing they better be your meal.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is very good, as is the Chicken Costaletta (probably spelling it wrong) burgers, and pretty much everything I have tasted there lol.  If you have not been, you should go.  I don't really like sweets so Cheesecake isn't my thing but the caramel macchiato is on point."
Mary Y.,"Reston, VA",49,36,75,4.0,6/13/2015,"Darn right I'm a fan! A friend of mine had never been to Cheesecake factory before so I made the choice that she must go and had to have the avocado eggrolls. Well mark down one more fan. lol  We basically had drinks, appys and cheesecake. I left feeling so stuffed that I wasn't sure if I'd fit behind my steering wheel. (I did) We were hoping to sit outside but there was a wait and we got seated right away inside. The waitress was lovely and very friendly. It was very enjoyable all around, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I ordered a burger to go for my dad and it took forever to get. We will be back."
Twoangel's A.,"New York, NY",0,22,68,5.0,2/15/2015,"Beautiful Place, great wait staff & excellent Food !!!!!   My husband & I will Definately be going back."
Jonny B.,"Old Westbury, NY",1,23,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Beyond pissed Went here for a birthday party and the service was non existant. The waitress came to take our parties order and she was pilled out and dizzy. She then disapeared for 25 minutes. While waiting 25 minutes for our drinks alone we were unable to not leave the silver ware unnoticed that still had food from the previous customers meals still attatched to the forks and knives. It was undeniable how disgusting and filthy this resteraunt was. Had the board of health came in this place would be condemned and closed up til they could get up to code. The food came out and was cold like it had been setting under heat lamps. Needless to say everyone was sick, even the persons birthday. So much for a special day. They get one star cuz well after all they refunded our money but our special day was ruined."
Ruby W.,"Massapequa, NY",1,39,,1.0,6/23/2016,"I'd give this location zero stars if possible. After being seated 10 mins had to ask manager for a waitress. Had to ask busboy for napkins, they never arrived. Waited 15 more mins for bread. Brought the order and it was wrong. Never came back with the right food. Waitress never came back to check on us. My husband ate his dinner and I left starving after an hour waiting for a salad that never arrived.  Manager offered food to go. Not eating a salad while in the car. Dont bother. Really awful experience."
Dacia B.,"Queens, NY",291,215,1170,5.0,1/29/2015,"I had the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp with white rice(you have a choice of white or brown) & beans(which wasn't good). This also came with little chunks of mango,parsley & onions! For my appetizer I had baked macaroni and cheese(lovely). For my drink I had a smoothie(I forgot the name) but it had orange,lime & other things inside of it. It also had a strawberry, slice or lemon & lime on the side ! Everyone enjoyed their meal"
Bill M.,"West Sayville, NY",0,2,,3.0,9/11/2016,"Overall dinner was good. I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp. Tasted great. The only issue was the cleanliness of the shrimp. Of about six shrimp, three of them were improperly deveined.  They tried but they obviously missed. The manager apologized and had some more shrimp cooked but I have the feeling he did not go back and actually tell his staff of the problem."
Lisa H.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,10,,1.0,6/29/2016,"METAL STAPLES IN MY CHEESECAKE!! We ordered Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake...I took a bite, realized something wasn't right, and pulled 3 metal staples out of my mouth! Frank, the manager, didn't even take care of our mere $50 bill. Was told corporate would contact me first thing today...they never called. They obviously don't care about their customers at all!!!"
Linnie L.,"Williston Park, NY",7,10,,1.0,9/5/2015,"So here we are at the CCF and just like the last time we were here, the service stinks. I figured we'd give it another chance but nope, the same crap as last time. We saw our waitress twice. The table had no knives, no ketchup for the fries. 2 pats of butter. Had to wait too long for our dinner.  Still waiting for the check .... Yawn....  Forget about a second cup of coffee.... Omg our experience was awful... NEVER AGAIN! Now I HAVE to click a star Uugh"
Sonia R.,"Copiague, NY",98,1,,1.0,11/13/2015,"Horrible!!! What me and my boyfriend thought was gonna be a quick nice dinner turned out to be such a horrible experience. Wait was too long, portions were so small on  huge plates, wait staff sucks, and took forever with even getting dessert. Will never come back again"
Toni B.,"Islip, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/11/2015,Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory and usually dine at the one by the smith haven mall. So I was ecstatic when one came to Bay shore.  This review is strictly pertaining to bay shore location.   We got take out and I ordered the chicken and biscuits which I usually love (even though it's packed with calories lol)  I was super disappointed that when i open it there was NO BISCUIT. Hello it's chicken and biscuits!!???  Then my carrots were pretty much raw and the worst offense was I took a bite of what seemed to be microwaved mashed potatoes because they were stiff and gross and I had to pull a 3 inch piece of Saran Wrap (plastic) out of my mouth. Are you kidding me!!!!!!????  How can one dish get any worse?!  I called management and all he seemed to apologize for was the fact that I didn't get a biscuit!  How's about almost choking on plastic wrap! Ugh  or having to pull that out of my mouth !  I was so disgusted.  He refunded the meal and the two pieces of cheesecake but I don't feel that was sufficient anyway. He did offer to make me a new one and I could pick it up but no thanks. I don't want any food from the same chefs that made that meal.  Don't they care at all??? 3 offenses on one plate.  Unacceptable  Worth mentioning was one time me and my bf dined in and he pulled a long hair out of his pasta. Not even kidding.  They offered him a new dish but he lost his appetite and didn't even want cheesecake after that.  They did refund the dish    We go here because we like ccf usually and want to eat the food. Not get refunds for dishes that are inedible.   Will not be retuning to this bay shore location.
Candi A.,"West Islip, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,"This location is my least favorite, always a disappointment.  The aggravation starts upon entry...the staff quotes a time that is far from correct.  On my most recent visit I was quoted an hour wait time.  I asked if this was accurate and was told yes.  After an hour, they just keep telling you 10 minutes until 1 hour 40 minutes passes.  The wait doesn't end here...my daughter waited another 20 minutes to get a glass of cranberry juice because we were told it has to come from the bar.  The juice actually had to be returned because it had a terrible taste, but was still on our bill at the end of the meal.  The aggravation continued as we waited for our favorite zucchini sticks only to be told after waiting for them for a while that they are out of zucchini today.  Bread was finally brought out after about 30 minutes.  My advice...stay home!  If you must go, eat before you leave home and have an open mind in case your favorite foods are out of stock!"
