Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,10/18/2017,"Some nights I like to be adventurous and try an new restaurant. But a lot of the time (especially when I'm with my hubby) we just want something stress free that never fails to satisfy us completely. So we come here to Cheesecake Factory! This location gave us a particularly awesome server. I wish I'd gotten his name because he was one of the most over-the-top professional and sweet servers I've ever had. He was a young gentleman, quite tall....I hope you get him when you visit. He's great at checking in to make sure everything is to your liking. We were so impressed by him that we mentioned him to the manager on the way out. We're definitely going back to this location! Our go-to appetizer is the ""Spicy"" Chicken Loaded Nachos. It's big enough to share and tastes absolutely perfect. I love that it has both cheese sauce and melted shredded cheese. Also, the seasoning on the chicken is so good! But we have many other favorite options - any other the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls or even the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  If you want something on the healthy side, they have some pretty epic salads. Try the Greek or the Cobb.  For dessert we always order two to share. A recent combo I particularly enjoyed was Oreo and S'mores. But we're also pretty obsessed with Reese's. The Dulche De Leche, Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut and Salted Caramel are all amazing as well! And if you don't want Cheesecake, go with the Godiva Brownie Sundae - it's huge!!!"
Chanda H.,"Dayton, OH",31,11,4,3.0,9/9/2017,"This used to be my favourite place but not anymore  They have severe hygiene issues with tables , chairs ,plates and cutlery , we were taken back on the booth which ready to be seated but not wiped off with crumbs all over and some greasy stuff on it and when I asked to clean she just dusted off some and asked me to sit and I had to ask her to wipe it off with water  Another time I was sitting in the booth when a chewing gum got stuck to my pants from under the table  It might not be their fault that some one put it there but checking cleanliness us their job  These things just loose the apetite"
Marshall L.,"Saint Marys, OH",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,Ashley the waiter is one of the worst I ever seen. After she brought our drinks and appetizer we never seen her again. Then we got a 2nd waiter and it didn get much better after that. Orders the BBQ bacon burger only to find my onion rings had a monstrous black hair tangled threw out them . Would give this place 0 stars if that was a option.
Marc M.,"Maineville, OH",0,11,15,1.0,5/15/2017,"This restaurant is located at the Greene in Beavercreek, and being part of a larger shopping center needs to be attentive to people's time as many if it's patrons are on lunch break from the many stores. That being said I waited at the reception desk for 6 minutes while the girl behind the counter was on the phone. No worries, she has to answer the phone, but then have someone come support her. I was seated, and then low and behold, another 6 minutes to get the server to come greet me. 12 of 60 minutes gone so far and haven't placed my order yet. Order came out 17 minutes later, so that was fine. I ordered a mushroom burger without grilled onions and unsalted fries. Burger came out with onions and of course salt on the fries.  Shanequa was my server and she was very sweet and attentive, she just didn't have a chance to truly done being let down as she was by the rest of the experience. Food was hot and tasty, just not as ordered.  Overall I would avoid and won't be back."
Liana N.,"Honolulu, HI",121,116,797,4.0,8/16/2016,"I am huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and have visited numerous times. It is a chain restaurant and is located throughout the U.S. This one is located at the Greene and is on the corner right when you enter on Indian Ripple.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is their consistency with their food, presentation, quality, and service. There are often deals on free slices of cheesecake during the holidays when you purchase a $25 gift card.  I have tried many items on the menu and my go to choices are typically Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, Chicken Madeira, any of their huge salads, hamburgers, or Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. All of their portions are huge and you will definitely have left overs. This is a place to share with your friends and family. Don't forget to save some room for their iconic cheesecake as well!  For this visit, I had Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. I love ordering this one because it comes with a little bit of everything. It includes the chicken salad sandwich, spring salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and their soup of the day. Their soup of the day was cream of mushroom.  If you are not feeling like soup, you can always substitute it for something else for no extra charge. I have substituted my soup for french fries or mashed potatoes before.   Have I mentioned that I'm a big fan of this restaurant yet? I have almost tried all of their cheesecakes already and my favorites are Tuxedo, Kahlua, and Godiva. Although I have a sweet tooth, I do try to have some self-control and share with my hubby. :)    And yes, every time I enter Cheesecake Factory, my eyes dart directly to the cheesecakes in the display case and can feel like I have gained 10 pounds before my meal. I definitely recommend coming here if you are visiting the Greene.  If you visit during the weekends during the dinner rush, expect to wait for an hour or possibly more. There is also brunch on Sunday as well."
Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373,3.0,11/14/2016,"It's no secret that Cheesecake Factory has some pretty tasty (and super fatty) meals and appetizers to choose from within their HUGE menu, so I'm not going to go into too much detail regarding the food...just know that it's pretty good. Large portions, tons of options, decent prices, beautiful restaurant interior. 'Nuff said! Their famous desserts, however, are the real reason I keep revisiting to try some new things. This time I ordered a Hot Chocolate beverage and the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Pie Cheesecake and my husband had the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. I must say, I wasn't blown away with any of these choices. The hot chocolate was pretty but had NO FLAVOR at all. Tasted like hot water. No sweetness, no chocolate explosion that I was desperately hoping for. Very disappointing. The pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake was good but not amazing. The pumpkin pie part didn't have a ton of pumpkin flavor, but the pecan pie base was gooey and tasty at least. The white chocolate raspberry was incredibly subtle, which my husband enjoyed but I personally like a distinct pop of flavor on my tongue and I just didn't get it with any of these desserts this visit. My previous visit I ordered Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which sounds similar to German chocolate cake. This has been the biggest disappointment so far. It was served to me in the restaurant ice cold, so I could barely get my fork through it, and it tasted way too much like super fake coconut. Huge bummer since I absolutely adore the chocolate, coconut & nut mixture of most German chocolate items, but this tasted like a rock dipped in coconut tanning lotion. Not good at all. I will say that my most favorite dessert I've had at Cheesecake Factory so far is the Salted Caramel Cheesecake (Heaven on a plate!!!!) so maybe I'll just stick to that from now on."
Krystle C.,"Dayton, OH",4,19,29,5.0,8/26/2017,Love the Cheesecake Factory. Today I brunched with a friend (though Brunch is only on Sunday). I ordered the avocado toast and a mimosa which was about $20 all together. It was my first time having avocado toast and it was delightful. I wish I could have ate it all but I had breakfast before coming :). Service is always good. No complaints.
Kaleigh M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,50,62,4.0,8/11/2017,"I bought the vegan cobb salad & it was delicious! Very large portion, with wonderful variety of colors & flavors. I ordered a mojito, but it was too strong so exchanged it for a different beverage, which turned out to be just ok. Great customer service."
Jennifer H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,16,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Decided to stop in tonight for some dessert. Got seated on the patio immediately and waited for a waiter. Then we waited some more. After 10 minutes we asked for a waiter or waitress. Waited some more. Finally someone showed up. We asked for 2 waters and ordered dessert. After another 15 of waiting and getting neither water nor our order, we left. We told the hostess, but were afraid if we asked for a manager it would take too long! I would recommend trying ANY of the other restaurants at the Greene before stopping here."
Cheryl L.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,,1.0,2/15/2017,"Well I am quite disappointed.   My daughter decided to have her birthday dinner here this evening.  It was the WORST experience.   We waited 30 minutes after we arrived at 8pm to be seated at the furthest table in the back next to a door with very little light, the street light outside provided the most light for our table (BTW... Plenty of far more desirable tables open and set for service on our journey to the depths of the earth).  Next we ordered and I ordered the carbonara as I always do when we dine here.. NEVER AGAIN.   They should be embarrassed  by the dish they sent out to me.  I immediately took a bite even though it didn't look right(but like I said I could hardly see) the pasta was a dried out mess with oil on it.   Its like they had cooked the pasta an hour before and it sat out to dry.   HORRIBLE!!   I sent it back and our server Alyssa B. said she would talk to the kitchen manager.   Clearly she didn't or maybe she did and the kitchen manager was cool with sending out a second bowl of crap (I even asked her if the kitchen manager thought the second dish was acceptable... I got the impression that she never alerted the kitchen mgr) .   I returned that too and asked to speak to a manager.   I sat waiting for a manager while my family finished their meals.   NO MANAGER EVER CAME!!   CAN YOU BELIEVE?!?!   I asked for the bill and called off the MANAGER  since they didn't care enough about their guest to even make an appearance. Our server Alyssa B.  laughed through out her entire apology but guess what she still got her 20% because that's what people in the business do.   Yep,  I have been in the restaurant business my entire life and I can't even fathom being a manager that would let a guest out the door without even a care as to what went horribly wrong in their restaurant.   UNBELIEVABLE."
JoshNtab B.,"Glassboro, NJ",29,12,8,1.0,2/18/2017,"My grandparents received raw green beans with their meal, and my husband and I had raw pancetta in our pasta. We asked our waitress to take them. Ack to cook more and by the time she brought them out our food was cold and we were done. Although the manager took care of one of our meals they didn't go above and beyond."
David R.,"Dayton, OH",0,85,18,4.0,3/19/2017,"Fun, big, busy! Not gourmet but tasty. Menu is so large it could not be cooked one meal just for you without using pre packed portions. Great place for a lively evening. Nice bar, great place to eat if you are on your own."
Kathy H.,"Surprise, AZ",12,18,2,1.0,1/24/2017,Never have I got more disappointed with the restaurant in my entire life is this one tonight. Our server was horrible the food was horrible They lost my husbands credit card. I will never ever come back to this location again and if I were you I wouldn't go either.
Taylor M.,"Anna, OH",3,42,24,4.0,3/5/2017,"The decor was very nice. We came at 4:30 and there was already a huge wait so we walked around the Greene as we waited. There are many vegan and vegetarian options and many dishes can be modified for vegan or vegetarian consumption. I got Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, the pasta was okay but dry and didn't seem to be cooked all the way. The house side salad was extremely good and the balsamic vinaigrette was extremely amazing to. My family ordered many great drinks and the tropical smoothie was amazing too. Our waiter was extremely funny and just an all around great nice guy. The lights were really dim but other than that the place was great and the food was okay, no one else had complaints about their food or their pasta so I assumed mine was just a fluke and next time I'll try something else. Great visit."
Libby V.,"New Orleans, LA",137,265,1228,2.0,10/12/2016,Service is minimal and food is expensive. Last time we went while we were waiting to be seated they told the people behind us there was no heating element and all they could serve was cold food. Were we invisible??? As much as I like their Lemoncello cake I needed food first. So we left. I think I'm over them.
Rachel I.,"Georgetown, KY",12,28,32,4.0,5/1/2016,"I have been to this location a few times now. Food is consistent, service is efficient. Will be back! P.S. Tried banana cheesecake: my favorite so far!"
Matthew A.,"Springboro, OH",21,6,1,2.0,5/1/2016,"We ordered 4 slices of cheesecake from their Curbside Pick-up. We were very surprised when they brought out slices smaller than a piece of cake eaten by Victoria Beckham. The cheesecake was pricey-$30, but the slices used to be able to be shared. Now, my size 10 aunt can eat the whole piece, which leaves me with no cheesecake. Look out Victoria, I'm coming for ya!"
J W.,"Dayton, OH",158,146,223,4.0,8/3/2014,"I've never had a meal here I didn't like. The wide variety of entree options means everyone can find something they like, even picky eaters. Some of my go-to favorites are Shepard's Pie, Mac 'n cheeseburger, and Jambalaya. The real stars of this restaurant are of course the cheesecakes. I'll go out of my way to get a slice to go a few times a week.  There are a few reasons I won't give this place a 5 star review: 1) even though you get large portions I still find almost everything on the menu to be very overpriced. 2) they do not take reservations and I've been told several times that they won't seat you until everyone in your party arrives"
Cathy S.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,,1.0,3/25/2017,"Would give zero stars if I could.  I placed a carry out order, and arrived at the appointed time.  After waiting another 40 minutes without food, I left.  Feel bad that the kitchen staff worked hard to prepare food that did not result in a sale because the service to the customer was non existent.  Will not be ordering from here again."
Michelle R.,"Dayton, OH",10,11,,3.0,1/14/2017,"Had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory last night. We don't go here often because of the cost, but we were invited by another couple. The food was yummy as always. I enjoyed my chipotle chicken pasta dish. It was prepared well and was a good portion size. My husband, however, ordered a bowl of the white chicken chili and the bowl wasn't even full. When you order a $12 bowl of soup you expect it to be full. The meal total came to $120 for the 4 of us. This was with one alcoholic drink and 3 cheesecakes to go. I enjoyed my food but I walked out thinking it wasn't worth the money we spent. It will probably be another 5 years before I come again."
J F.,"Dayton, OH",0,14,1,3.0,5/10/2017,Burger came out 30 minutes after order with the NHL logo on it.  Many menu items are great.  Burger not so much.  Service.....is........slow.
Emily W.,"Dayton, OH",152,105,87,4.0,1/30/2015,"I got the lemon garlic shrimp dish and it tasted just, ""all right."" There was fresh basil in it which was nice, but other than that no flavor really popped out to me at all. It was kind of bland. And the shrimp that cane with it had nice flavor but was cooked in the Shell and it was very difficult to get all the shell bits of, so for me it wags a a bit unappetizing. It came with asparagus which was cooked perfectly. I was just expecting a little more quality (peeled shrimp) and goodness (a little more flavor) from my dish seeing as how it was $18 Our server was excellent and paid close attention to our every need. The manager on duty was very attentive and friendly and stopped by our table many time to check in and visit with my one and a half year old niece who was waving to him everytime he walked by. He noticed her getting a little antsy and two minutes later he showed up with a small bowl of ice cream and sprinkles which she devoured! That was a very thoughtful unexpected treat for my niece and it was very much appreciated.  The cheesecakes, as usual, we're awesome! Our table got three slices, the mango keylime, the dulce de leche and caramel (my favorite), and the turtle cheesecake. All very hard not to eat in one sitting!"
Noell C.,"Blue Springs, MO",9,76,96,4.0,4/8/2015,"Came today for lunch. Server was ok not much personality. Chef manager, Kris Allen, is great though!  Started with Mac and Cheese bites. Absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend. Daughter got the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. She said the sauce wasn't to her liking.  I had to miso salmon it was great! Sauce was good salmon cooked to perfection. Friend had the Carolina pork sandwich. Tender, bacon cooked perfectly."
Tasha A.,"Burlingame, CA",4,40,2,4.0,7/1/2016,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory, nothing really strikes me as more outstanding or worse than any other, in my opinion most CFs are pretty comparable. I went recently on a business trip with a large party and did not encounter the inflexibility that other yelpers mentioned. In fact the staff was very accommodating when we stayed late and made a mess. It's a good location for business lunches and dinners. I would not hesitate to eat here again."
Milo O.,"Dayton, OH",18,25,21,5.0,7/25/2016,"If you visit The Cheesecake Factory you have to try the Crusted Chicken Romano. Delicious! You can very easily split the meal because it's that much food. The chicken is so wonderful to the palate. The noodles and its base are sensational! Have it with a glass of St Chateau Michelle Riesling and if there is room remaining, you can not go wrong with the banana cream cheesecake cake."
Ivet V.,"Newport, KY",87,118,760,4.0,10/25/2015,"I have never bad reviews about this place. We went during lunch time and got the lunch portions. I got the chipotle chicken pasta which was amazing. it was prepared properly and tasted delicious.  After eating our delicious lunch we had to order a cheesecake, a pumpkin cheesecake to be exact which was absolutely delicious!"
Blake H.,"San Diego, CA",21,3,,1.0,8/28/2016,Worst customer service front counter does not know how to do there job. Sat there for 40 minutes while everyone kept being called before us and the hostess ends up telling me she never got our names.
Pauline W.,"Dayton, OH",37,3,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY,  however our server has ALREADY been so rude that if it weren't for the fact that it's my husband's birthday, WE WOULD LEAVE.  We sat down and were greeted with what we assumed was complimentary chips and salsa.  A few minutes later our server came and abruptly took it from us saying that it wasn't for us and she would have to charge us for it.  We were speechless! Even the people beside us looked puzzled. So the long and the short of it is that I told her that it's not a problem but her delivery was bad.  She actually made us feel as if we did something wrong.  I can't even remember her name and am far too upset to ask her, but we are seated in the far end of the restaurant facing Walnut Street."
Lisa L.,"Loveland, OH",121,246,196,3.0,5/9/2016,My experience there was it's was ok. The food is expensive and mediocre. Now the cheesecake is the bomb!!! I would go again just for that!!!!
Juan T.,"Cincinnati, OH",17,49,23,4.0,8/7/2015,"Always consistently good food.  Service was excellent.  Avoid weekends as it can get quite busy.  If in a rush, try seating at the bar as you don't have to wait for a table"
Pablo B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,8,1,3.0,5/29/2016,"Unfortunately, not a family restaurant. Groups of 2 to 4 fly through. Instead of combining tables to form a larger one for groups larger than 4, they make you wait for the designated larger tables for parties of 6 or 8...the system works so great it eliminates improv (err...or risk I assume). Perhaps the servers would benefit from critical thinking rather than focusing on what the software or monitor tells them. Pay attention owners and managers."
Jenny D.,"Dayton, OH",7,135,123,5.0,7/17/2015,The food is good. Lighting and atmosphere are pleasant. Salads are big and come with lots of lettuce. But the cheesecake is where it's at. The first cheesecake I tried was the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. It even comes with a piece of chocolate as a topping. The entire slice is the size of a small cake. It's deliciously sweet.
stephanie r.,"Washington, DC",7,2,,3.0,5/29/2016,"Came here for their salad selection and skinny cocktail menu. Falafel salad was good, but is mostly kale... Like 99% kale. There was barely any romaine lettuce, and only like five small grape tomatoes along with the pita chips & falafel balls."
Sherry L.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,13,4.0,7/3/2017,"This seems to be the place we always end up when we have out of town visitors (even when we suggest other places)The prices are steep for even some of their basic dishes but the food always ranges from 'pretty good' to 'omg try this' so I guess it evens out. The cheesecake is pricey but always phenomenal. The seating at this particular location can be hella wonky if you have more than 4 people in your party. Example: we were a party of 7 with 2 members of said party being 6'2 230 lbs and 6'4 260lbs. They actually tried to seat us in a 4-6 person booth. Yeah. Then the hostess got major attitude because we dared to suggest that it wasn't going to work. Then we were led around the entire crowded restaurant like the march of shame and left standing there before they seated us at an appropriate sized table that was empty when we first got there. There were other ugh seating moments but that was the worst. Also, be prepared for Pasta Problems. On one visit their pasta maker was down, so no pasta dishes. Today we waited over 40 minutes because the guy who makes the pasta quit mid-shift lol On a more positive note, our servers have always been very nice and professional. To sum up, great place to go if you're a party of 1-4, would avoid if your party is 4+"
Jason T.,"Dayton, OH",129,1,,1.0,7/19/2016,When did a spinach dip appetizer take 40 mins on Tuesday followed by an entree Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp that was very bland. #trainingyourcookswould help
S S.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,1,1.0,12/24/2016,Probably won't be a good day to dine at the Beavercreek restaurant when they've only been open a little over an hour and 1 employee couldn't be bothered to answer a simple question and the person she handed the phone to was rude AF.
David B.,"Lima, OH",0,26,9,5.0,11/7/2016,"Food was fantastic, and I don't use that word unless it truly is warranted.   Service was as good as the food.  We drive just over an hour to dine here abs will continue to do so."
Glenn A.,"Warrenville, IL",0,4,,3.0,10/14/2016,"I've enjoyed the luau salad for years, but yesterday it was overloaded with a mayo and dressing mix. In the past I've enjoyed the light, healthy salad, but yesterday with all the dressing and fried pieces it was pretty gross and filled with calories and a ton of fat.  My daughter ordered the Cajun jambalayan pasta, she said it was ok, but was disappointed.  Thankfully, the cheesecake is still wonderful!"
Alexa M.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,30,44,1.0,3/20/2016,Customer service was terrible and unprofessional. The orange chicken I got was extremely dry in both sauce and texture itself. My boyfriends food was especially fishy and unpleasant.
Jed M.,"D'Iberville, MS",131,442,2017,3.0,4/24/2015,"Huge portions but always very average, luck-luster food.  This location does have a nice ambiance and lighting."
