Paul W.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,,5.0,3/1/2015,"I have ate there numerous times, never have been dissatisfied, they have a very large menu, they have an affordable lunch menu, great salads, burgers , pizza, great International Dishes. I always have received good service, they are very busy on weekends, you need to get there early and of course there cheesecake is wonderful."
Lindsey M.,"Harrisburg, PA",24,1,,4.0,7/19/2013,I just wanted to note that the description says it accepts reservations.  I called today and they said they do not accept reservations.
Scott M.,"Fort Washington, MD",4,93,4,3.0,8/2/2014,"Not going to go through what the Cheesecake Factory is, this place is no different than the rest.  I found it to be very busy on a Friday at about 6:30.  If you go there right before then, you could sit down right away.  The staff was very quick and as usual, a great selection of cheesecake."
Albert G.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2013,would like to go here.  Tried to make a reservation for a party of 10.  they said they do not take reservations so will go someplace that is more accommodating.
White G.,"Dayton, OH",0,31,1,4.0,6/10/2013,Just a good place....breakfast is great.....dinner is great...sometimes hard to get a seat...a little pricey..
Kristie S.,"Downtown, Cincinnati, OH",6,19,5,2.0,8/1/2012,"Let me preface this review by saying, we were going out with a large group (16 people).  Sometimes you have to go where the group wants to go. We got there at 7 and had a 7 o'clock reservation.  The hostess said she could not seat us until half of our group arrived.  Luckily they walked in the door right after us because we have a 2 month old and we needed a place to sit to feed him.  Once we had half the group the hostess told us that they only had room for 14 of our 16.  We could wait until there was room for the other two or we could sit down and when the other table finished their desert we'd have room for all 16.  We opted to go ahead and sit, but I never noticed any issues with the number of seats at the table. The restaurant is loud, but that's a good thing when you have several kids under 10 in your group. I ordered the eggplant sandwich and subbed in sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  The eggplant sandwich was not good.  Eggplant can be iffy and this eggplant was tough.  It was more of a fork and knife eggplant than a sandwich eggplant. I took a couple bites of the cheesecake.  That was good, three of us tackled a single slice.   Our server did a great job of managing our large group.  Refills were timely and our orders all came out right even though we seemed to be playing musical chairs."
Bea H.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,4.0,7/13/2014,"We have never had a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory.  Portions are huge.  And the service has never been bad.  We also try to go when it's not really packed, we get better service that way.  Cheesecake is the best around.  Usually we don't have room for it, but it's a great treat when we do.  I think having it at the Greene is a good addition to the Beavercreek dining options."
Ginger D.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,,4.0,1/20/2014,The food is fairly consistent at cheesecake factory. There always seems to be a big wait there as it is a novelty restaurant. The food serving sizes are huge and usually enough for the next meals lunch. I think the restaurant a bit pricey.
Michael M.,"Taunton, MA",298,366,92,2.0,4/13/2011,"This place is nothing special. Shame on me as I have gone to a Cheesecake Factory a few times and every time I leave I say how overpriced they are. Food is mediocre, and well overpriced. The cheesecake is one of the very few highlights of this place. Unless I'm forced I won't go here again!"
Leslie L.,"Dayton, OH",25,173,,4.0,3/27/2011,Great place! My boyfriend and I tend to eat here alot because the kitchen stays open a little later than most restaurants (11:00pm). The food is always wonderful. The price is right for the huge portions. The menu is large so eating there alot is never a problem. Yum.
Mike G.,"Denver, CO",22,108,7,1.0,6/28/2008,"I have ben to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times now... 2 out of 3 have been pretty poor experiences, and my most recent trip was bad enough to A) talk to the manager about it, and B) Decide never to go there again... We had 5 of us in our group, and were coming from the bar already with drinks.  Our waitress was prompt in coming over and chatting with us, but took 10 minutes to get water out to us.. Not a huge deal, but it was a sign of things to come.. Apps came out quick and were pretty decent (calimari and some king of spring roll things).  Then the wait began.  About 30-40 minutes after ordering, 2 entrees came out.  About 10-12 minutes after that, 2 more came out.  This led to 4 of us having food in front of us getting cold, and 1 unlucky diner in our group not having anything.  I should mention now that our waitress has stopped by 4 or 5 times without clearing the appetizer plates (empty) or asking to get us another round of drinks.   We ask for more drinks, 3 beers that are on tap, and we wait.  We wait for our last entree to come out.. We wait for beers... The beers took over 10 minutes.  We could have walked to the bar to get them in shorter time, hell, we could have walked across the street to the pub and got them shorter.   Finally, well over an hour since sitting down, our last entree arrives.. This is a solid 20 minutes after the first persons food came out.   The food wasn't to thrilling. I think some of it could have been better if it had not been sitting for 20 minutes (while politely waiting for everyones food to arrive).. But some of it was just flat-out bland.  Nothing anyone said was great, and the hibachi steak (the one we waited on) was bad enough only to have a few bites and call it quits. I asked to speak to the manager, which I rarely do.. He came over and we explained what had happened.  He checked the ticket times of the food and bar and told us nothing took more than 4 minutes to come out from the bar, and that our server forgot to put in someones entree, thus it had to be remade.  I suggested that no ones food should have come out early or late, creating the 30 minute parade of entree-at-a-time.  He tended to agree with all our issues, and made some excuses about being new there and some staff changes.  He offered us free dessert (which we declined, we'd already been in the place 2.5hrs), and then took about 15 minutes to get the checks to us. 2 out of 3 times at this Cheesecake Factory = never again... I would probably give it another try if the manager was more understanding and did not make excuses.  But, he didn't. So he sucks."
William D.,"Dayton, OH",41,50,13,3.0,6/9/2012,"If you come here on the weekend during peak hours like we did, you need to have your head examined. A constant stream of people coming and going. We felt like cattle. After a 50 minute wait, luckily we were a party of two or it would've been much longer, we were rounded into our tiny booth. We enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread (no silverware so we had to dip our bread into the butter packets like heathens.) After looking through their 79 page menu I decided on their herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi. The salmon was very tiny and no way crusted in herbs. Tasty but small. The shrimp scampi was also pretty good but only consisted of 3 shrimp. My girlfriend got an Asian chicken salad or something to that effect and the Asian plum dressing was the best thing on our table. Pretty solid. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that their mashed potatoes that came with my meal was a 5lb mass of sheer density. Could've been used as spackle. As I sit here belching and farting from tonight's meal I promise I'll never step foot inside this place again. I don't get the appeal. Food was ok but it's not worth the headache, not by a long shot."
Mary M.,"Springboro, OH",0,14,,4.0,8/22/2011,"We had no wait for a table on Sunday at about noon but, by the time we left, there were people waiting. I really like the atmosphere, with the high ceilings, natural light, and ornate architectural detail. This is not the place for an intimate dinner, by any means. The menu is, indeed, daunting. I loved the ""skinny menu"" which was an insert in the regular menu. The ""healthy food"" choices were interesting and pretty numerous. Two of us ordered off of that menu, and we enjoyed our entrees.  All of our food was fresh, well prepared, and tasted good.  The service was not speedy, but not ridiculously slow, either. This is a good place for a leisurely Sunday brunch. We were offered refills on iced tea, but never on coffee (?). Our server was pleasant and reasonably efficient. My first impression was a good one but, this is such a large restaurant, I can see how short-staffing could cause problems. Prices are in the moderate range, but you might need to take out a loan if you want to take home an entire cheesecake, depending on your selection."
Gerry W.,"South Charleston, OH",0,43,,3.0,1/2/2010,"Sadly, The Cheesecake Factory USE to be one of my favorite restaurants. We ate there today and it was just okay.  Our table, 4ppl shared the lettuce wraps.  There were 5 tiny strips of chicken for a large platter of lettuce leaves and fix-ins. It tasted good but skimpy on the chicken. We also ordered the Artichoke crisps...they were edible, very greasy though and ailoi was not very flavorful.  My husband ordered the Thai Chicken pasta and it had hardly any sauce. My father got the pasta with meat sauce and my Mom got the burrito. They enjoyed their food.   My meal (the most expensive at $19.99) was the worst. I ordered the shrimp scampi/Steak Diane combo.  Most of the plate was filled with mashed potato's....I am talking more than 4 servings worth although tasty. It came with 3 medium shrimp and the scampi cream sauce was good. BUT, the steak Diane was awful.  The wine sauce tasted like water sauce. I complained to the waiter who brought out MORE sauce which was a little more wine tasting but had a large layer of oil sitting on top.  On the plus side, we were seated nearly immediately.....we use to have to wait up to 1-2 hours......maybe that should have been a warning.  Oh, my Peach Bellini was very good and I would order it again.  Next time I go, I will just get a couple of Peach Bellini's and cheesecake.  ~review by Mrs. Gary~"
Jeff D.,"Centerville, OH",0,8,,4.0,6/15/2011,"Great portions.  Can never finish, so I have no room for dessert. Prices are fair, but the wait is typically very long."
Harry N.,"Kansas City, MO",1,125,7,4.0,7/31/2012,"THis chain may not be the best restaurant in the world but it is consistently good and provides a variety of options.  This location is at the Greene, you cant beat it. I will continue to eat here."
Tim B.,"Dayton, OH",4,29,29,4.0,5/14/2007,"Wonderful vibe, great food, attentive staff, superb location at The Greene overlooking the green itself. Only snag...they put too much cream on top of the cheesecake. It's not necessary.... ;-)"
Brian C.,"Dayton, OH",83,282,26,4.0,2/16/2011,"It's really hard not to like the Cheesecake Factory and honestly I really tried to find things here I didn't like, but they truly have a pretty good thing going. I typically go for the smaller, locally owned, hole in the wall, hidden treasure type places, not a chain like Cheesecake Factory, but everything here is pretty good. Of course the atmosphere is really nice, huge 30ft ceilings, roman looking columns, nice lighting, everything is in order. The service really good, my only nit pick is that our server seemed like he was reciting his lines from a script, loosen up man! The food was excellent, from the Ahi tartare to the buffalo blasts, to the cheesecake and coffee, it was all very good! Great place for a date, business luncheon, etc. You could come here in jeans and a t-shirt or a suit and feel comfortable and that's a good thing! Good job for the broad apeal, great food, and excellent customer service! I'm sure we'll visit again, good thing the gym is right around the corner to work off all of the cheesecake!"
Cynthia D.,"Dayton, OH",0,8,,3.0,2/17/2010,"I'm not big on chain restaurants so that may affect my review a bit. I had lunch here today for the first time with my boss, who is a regular. Walking in, the place has a great atmosphere, and there wasn't a wait. The service was very attentive (probably because the server and bartender knew my boss on a first name basis). The menu almost had too many choices. I didn't have time to look at half of it before I ordered, even after asking for more time. I ordered the fish tacos which were good (not great), but I couldn't believe how big the plate was for a lunch. Perhaps they should cut down on portion sizes to cut the price a bit?"
Jennifer K.,"Dayton, OH",3,32,,4.0,5/7/2008,"I've dined at this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times prior to my most recent trip. This time, my party consisted of my husband and two other couples. We waited about an hour for a table, which was to be expected at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday. Once seated, it took no time at all to place our orders and receive our food. I observed that everyone's hubcap-sized plates were filled with food, mine included (gigantic grilled cheese sandwich with fries). Food was good, service was great...I asked for a birthday sundae (which was tiny!) for my brother, and they asked if I would like a serenade or just the sundae. Kudos for giving me the option! Overall, it was a good experience and I will likely dine there again."
