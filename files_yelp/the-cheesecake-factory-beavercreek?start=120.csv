John M.,"Dayton, OH",23,273,35,3.0,1/12/2008,"I guess I'll be the dissenter and write that the Cheesecake Factory is only OK, and it certainly wouldn't make my ""top 20 things to eat if I'm going to die"" category. Went last night at around 9:30, still an impressive wait, but not too bad.  It's part of an outdoor mall so such is live I guess.  A very large place with high ceilings and modern decor, it's a little loud for me, definitely not the spot for a romantic dinner (plus we were practically sitting on top of the folks next to us). Wine list is so-so, and the food was not memorable.  The mixed green salad was ok, the roasted beets were a nice touch though.  The pasta was forgettable - I ordered the garlic pasta and there wasn't anything especially garlic about it.  It is essentially the same dish as the Bistro Shrimp less the swimmers and with a different mushroom. Service was fine, although it took a while to get two glasses of wine. Overall, meh.  I would eat there again if I had to. 2.5 stars."
Elliot R.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,10/23/2011,"I'm typically a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I'll be reconsidering any return trips. I'm not opposed to waiting to be seated. However, it tends to test my patience, when you quote me one hour and seat me at the 2 1/2 hour point. Why is it, that after waiting patiently for an hour, that my repeated inquiries were uniformly answered with the same canned, ""you are the next table to be seated"" response? You start to wonder when your party of seven is seated after the party of ten, who has waited half the time. You'd think that after the manager intervenes you'd get more than a condescending, ""you should have said something sooner"" and a chair thrown onto the end of a six person table. I provided the benefit of doubt due to their large crowd, but when management deflects blame onto the customer, I tend to be offended. No amount of wonderfully delicious and decedent strawberry cheesecake makes up for poor table management and customer service. RIP Cheesecake factory, you are dead to me."
Pravin M.,"Chicago, IL",17,103,7,4.0,11/24/2007,"How could the Cheesecake Factory get anything but 4 stars.  I have always loved you, my dear friend.  It is odd to me that the factory (that's what friends call it) has reached suburban Ohio. I had the Cajun chicken pasta sans chicken.  I know this is dramatic, but I would get my last meal from here, except that it would last me for 3 meals.  This is not the place for the guy who says ""what the hell- let me just undo my belt a little""- No that guy should not go here. That guy should go and find a nice support group."
