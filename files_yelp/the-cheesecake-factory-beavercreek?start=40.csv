Alexander C.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,2,2.0,10/18/2016,"I didn't think my experience at this Cheesecake Factory could be worse. I was here about a month ago and I had a similar problem. The servers cannot handle a 5 table section which is standard at most restaurants. I was in on Saturday for the Ohio state game and sat at the hightops near the bar. The problems started stacking o top of each other. First I try to order a pizza and our server insist on not getting anything out the oven because the cook at that station apparently "" sucks "". Very unprofessional from an employee to say things like that to a customer. Anyways, I decide to order the chicken pizza anyways because I've been craving it since the last time I had it. Normally the pizza is fantastic, but this time I swear the whole thing was so undercooked that every single price was unable to tear from the pizza. The crust would just pull off! After not seeing my server for fifteen minutes , my friend who also got a pizza ( which was perfectly fine) was finished with his meal and my server finally comes to the table. I tell her about the pizza and she apologizes and walks around with the pizza in her hand for 20 more minutes before taking my order again. Finally I order my chipotle chicken pasta which is another one of my favorites.. the pasta was literally swimming in sauce. Pasta is not supposed to be drowned guys! My fork was also an issue. I couldn't believe how many things went wrong. My fork was literally bent at the tips and in the dark light it could hurt someone's mouth! And after another ten minutes goes by I see my server , tell her about the problem and she huffs and puffs about it. In the end I ate a cold pasta. My pizza was messed up. And my server had no idea on what serving a table meant. There's not even a manager on sight to complain. Food here is very inconsistent. Sad because I love the factory :("
A G.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,,1.0,3/24/2016,Called earlier to let them know we have a party of eight.  We are now here and with empty tables available we have wait for 30 minutes   Not good. A lot of people standing around out front not trying to seat people.  It's 30 minutes a nothing yet.  Hope the service isn't this slow Food was good. A little slow with the bread and drinks.  The calculated tip percentages includes the sales tax. This is one of my biggest beefs when eating out. No tip should include the tax.
Andy K.,"Englewood, OH",69,163,4,1.0,11/13/2014,"Jules and I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but when a friend's birthday popped up, we were eager to celebrate with them.  As such, just yesterday, we braved the November cold to head into The Greene and grab some dinner. Now, this review must come with a fairly large caveat.  We had a large group in our party--9 of us, in all, which includes one late attendee.  However, you'd figure that a place as a big as the Cheesecake Factory would be able to accommodate this well?  Well...in truth?  Not so much. The service at this Cheesecake Factory was absent-minded and barely competent.  Numerous errors occurred throughout our meal:  we were brought incorrect appetizers twice, special requests (no salt on a margarita for the birthday boy's father, who's on heart medication) were ignored.  My wife's Garlic Noodles with Shrimp were sent back twice, because there were no shrimp on the plate!  Our bills were similarly messy, with Jules' and my bill being the only one totally correct.   In each case, the waitress did, in fact, do her best to rectify the situation, but the sheer number of mess-ups made the meal a frustrating experience. That said, the food was pretty tasty.  The Crispy Cuban Rolls were a neat take on the classic Cuban sandwich, with a delightfully zingy mustard and a flavorful pork filling.  My four-cheese pasta was competently done, with plenty of cheese and chicken.  A friend's ""Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp"" smelled pretty fantastic, with a delectably scented curry surrounding a massive mound of sticky rice.  Our cherry cheesecake--taken to go!--was creamy with good flavor and a solid amount of cherry preserves. Under normal circumstances, when I review a restaurant, good food + lousy service tends to result in a 2 or 3-star review.  In this case, as you can see above...no. You see, I woke up this morning feeling a little under the weather.  I stepped out of the shower this morning and almost immediately started heaving over the toilet.  Out came my dinner, the cheesecake, and everything else I'd eaten yesterday.   No amount of good flavor forgives food poisoning.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
NoneofYelpsBusiness R.,"Dayton, OH",0,10,,1.0,12/19/2015,"Loud, crowded, overpriced, meh food and horrible cheesecake.  My biggest complaint is the cheesecake.  If you are a cheesecake casual, you may think this garbage is good.  If you are a cheesecake connoisseur like myself, prepare to be disappointed in their horrible gelatinous ""cheesecake"".  One a scale of 1 to 10 it is one point above jello cheesecake from a box and one point below just plain philadelphia cream cheese from the foil. Yuck."
Carolyn O.,"Hamilton, OH",47,20,29,3.0,1/29/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory. For a chain restaurant, their food is always good. Never tastes like its been frozen for weeks or processed. I had Vietnamese Spring rolls. Very good. Our server was fantastic. We had a party of 11 with several kids. She was very patient. ***on a side note the hostess was incredibly rude. Also, having a policy of not seating a party until 70% of party shows up is ridiculous. I understand if restaurant is busy or on a wait. We had 50% of party there and other half in the process of parking. The restaurant was almost empty. No reason to make us stand there unnecessarily and wait."
Moni D.,"Lakenheath, United Kingdom",25,15,2,5.0,7/31/2016,"Lovely Sunday brunch outside. The service was great, prompt but never rushed. Food is always great. Can't go wrong at a Cheesecake Factory."
Alexis V.,"Springfield, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2016,If you're under 25 forget it. They're extremely rude and will talk about you to their manager right in front of you. They won't bring your drink and will mess up your food. They're extraordinary rude and won't serve you until the place is dead.
Bethany B.,"Dayton, OH",63,44,81,5.0,11/2/2014,"I love desserts ! What better place to have a slice of a great piece of dessert than ""The Cheesecake Factory"" ! Beautiful decor , great food, and exceptional cheesecake that only a real sweet tooth could possibly eat an entire slice in one sitting ... Get a to go box! I like sitting at the bar .. Having a drink (most times water) my piece of cake and eating it too ;) ! Fall is here .. So if you've never had it ... Get the Pumpkin Pecan Pie cheesecake ...OMG !!!"
Stephanie G.,"New Vienna, OH",0,15,,5.0,9/22/2016,We love it here! Top notch food and live the bread they give you while you wait. We got a pasta dish And an appetizer and split them both between us and we were still stuffed. The food was great and when we asked for extra sauce they were very accommodating. They made sure to check on us and give us refills while we there. The wait to get a seat was worth it.
Liam H.,"Champaign, IL",0,8,6,2.0,1/31/2015,"I am giving this such a low review for the horrible service.  I know they get the job done, but really when it comes down to spending $30 a head on a meal of like to have some enthusiasm.  A sloth has more emotion than most of the servers here.  I love the food immensely at every CCF I've been to but the service here makes for an unpleasant experience."
Jenny C.,"Dayton, OH",82,227,258,3.0,8/25/2014,"Getting to and from the Greene is incredibly simple. It's conveniently located off the highway (not sure what it is- I'm not from the area!) and luckily for me- literally 4 miles from my parents' home in Beavercreek. There is ample parking in the lots as we'll as metered parking along the sides of the businesses. Because it is the most moderately priced ""nice"" restaurant in the area, I've been told the wait time at Cheesecake Factory can be anywhere between 15-30 min. Lucky for me, the longest I've waited at this establishment was only ever ~10 min. Moving on, service at the Cheesecake Factory at The Greene has always been above average. My servers never go above and beyond (servers in Connecticut offer wine/alcoholic choices with my meals), but they've never slighted or ignored my table... It's really whatever. The same can be said about the food. It tastes like every other Cheesecake Factory in the country (CA, OH, MA, NY, etc). Mind you, I find that to be a good thing- I always like to try new things on the menu, but am glad to have sure-fire dishes to fall back to. On a random note, this might possibly be the smallest Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Either way, shopping at The Greene can be exhausting. Can't hurt to scarf down a $10 cheesecake greet you at the end of a long evening."
V J.,"Hollywood, FL",0,12,,1.0,8/8/2016,Waited over a hour for us (two people) salads...no explanation and watched how others who were seated after us received their food and check.
Mike B.,"Dayton, OH",3,60,5,3.0,10/8/2014,Had never got here but was taking a friend out for dinner who is a picky eater. Had the chicken and dumplings. The dish was good. My friend ended up with a salad the was huge. There was lots of choices on the menu.  Needless to say the desert was excellent.
Rande G.,"Dayton, OH",1,3,,2.0,11/26/2015,"Our large group was served well and all but two of us enjoyed the food. My "" Chicken & Bisquets"" were inedible. They were dry and incredibly over salted. I've had dishes there I have enjoyed but some that were just terrible. Beware when you order. You may end up with something not worth eating. I suppose a menu that vast would make that a possibility."
T H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,18,,5.0,1/17/2016,"Great food, great drinks, great service, and great dessert.  This place is all around one of the best places to eat in the area and one of the best cheesecake factories I've been to as well."
Beverly A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,2.0,5/14/2015,"Food was good for a chain restaurant but the service was horrible. As we walked up, more than half the tables outside were empty. We were told it was a 15 minute wait outside. We got a beer at the bar while we waited for a table to open up. Once seated outside, we sat at a dirty table for another 20 minutes. Finally someone asked us had we been waited on. The excuse of taking so long was because we already had a beer. Numerous times we were brought other people's food. And when we finished, we didn't see our waitress for over 15 minutes....we had to go inside and ask about paying our tab because there were not any servers outside. Lastly, the manager was very disengage. He stood behind the hostess stand the entire time just looking around. I will not return to this establishment."
Jon C.,"Dayton, OH",0,10,,4.0,1/13/2016,"Had a great time at Cheesecake Factory. All the food was well done! The service we received was beyond expected. Desserts were better than the server said they would be. The only down fall was the wait for a table, but when the food and service is this excellent the wait is ok."
Alexandra P.,"Beavercreek, OH",0,32,3,3.0,11/1/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a good choice for drinks and dessert; or if your group has a wide variety of tastes and preferences . The menu is incredibly long and includes American staples like a burger and fries , as well as the Cheesecake Factory's take on Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  Every time I've eaten here, the food has been satisfactory . With so many items on the menu, it's no surprise most menu items are average or below average in taste and presentation . I do enjoy the complimentary bread brought to the table before each meal . The dark colored bread is incredibly addicting ! Don't forget to grab a dessert on your way out the door .  Ironically in not a big cheesecake fan , but their cheesecake really is good . I tried the smore's cheesecake . I am not one to leave a dessert unfinished but this cheesecake was so rich I was forced to save some for later ."
Katherine M.,"West Lafayette, IN",19,73,6,4.0,8/16/2015,"I love this place! The outdoor seating is perfect for lunch after sitting in a cold office all day! They have a ton of options and lots of healthy salads that are creative, HUGE and really good! Not to mention - amazing cheesecake, obviously!"
Aaron C.,"Chandler, AZ",1,4,,2.0,10/28/2015,Normally enjoy the food and service however this location was below what I come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Service was slow and sometimes none existent. I have served before... Pre-busing and drink refills are just common practice. For a place that was over half empty with plenty of wait staff I found our wait to be too long.
