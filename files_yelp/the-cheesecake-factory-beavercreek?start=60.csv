Anthony J.,"Grant Park, Atlanta, GA",38,12,3,4.0,10/28/2015,Really wonderful atmosphere. Food is ok but the cheesecake is phenomenal as well as the drinks. Try the frozen Georgia peach!
Theresa A.,"Dayton, OH",94,4,7,5.0,11/25/2014,Absolutely love Cheesecake Factory. They have an extensive menu and everything is prepared very well! Very clean and welcoming atmosphere.
Kali H.,"Dayton, OH",2,58,,3.0,1/19/2014,"Whatever I order seems to come out correct so I have zero room for complaints.  The staff however is another story.  First of all Cheesecake Factory how dare you take away the Chocolate Coconut cheesecake! Shame on you! When my waiter informed me it wasn't available I was very sad. It was a terrible day and all a girl wanted was to stuff her face with some high calorie cheesecake. (Don't worry I had a salad for dinner!) My waiter suggested the Raspberry and White Chocolate instead and it was lovely.  I shared with my friends because we sample each others food like there's no tomorrow. Well when my waiter comes back he says ""Well looks like someone liked it you ate the entire thing...wow!"" and walks away.  First of all it's plain rude to say something like that jackwagon! Mind your manners! Anyway aside from some jerks you should have a nice time."
K M.,"Troy, MI",2,23,,4.0,6/4/2015,"The food is usually pretty good, and one entree is always enough for two meals for me. I've always ordered my food to go from them and they seem to forget my bread every time. Trying their cheesecake should be mandatory, but be prepared to eat salads for a week to offset the caloric intake from a visit."
Olive R.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,14,1,4.0,2/9/2015,"I stopped in on a Monday afternoon, so there was no wait and it was relatively dead. That said, I walked in through the side door and was greeted and seated immediately. My waitress was excellent. Very prompt and attentive service. I ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes which were delicious. I got the tempura fish tacos as an entrée. These were very good as well. The portions were huge. I ate one of three corn cakes and one of four of the tacos and took the rest to go. I also got a piece of the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake to go. It was extremely rich but very good. I would definitely return if in the area!"
Matt H.,"Logan, OH",0,1,,3.0,4/5/2016,"Roadside sliders were great, deep fried mac n cheese balls were burnt and dry. For the price it was very disappointing. But, waitress was friendly and peanut butter cheesecake saved the day in the end."
Todd P.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",2,38,6,1.0,12/3/2015,"What is it with this place?  The glitz the glam I almost feel like I'm in a casino.  Too bad I'm not, because the food would taste better at a casino.  This restaurant used to hold itself to a higher standard.  First of all their soda products taste ""watered-down"" and they use an insane amount of ice, to give the illusion of your glass being full!  The servers are programmed monkeys who adhere to corporate protocol, I.e. The wife, kids, and I went here just last night.  The kids ordered pizzas and me and my wife split an old-fashioned hamburger (medium).  Easy enough right?  When our food came out, the pepperonis were burnt on the edges (this seems pretty regular occurrence) and the serving of fries were cold (did I mention they are equivalent in size to a happy meal fry) and when my wife cut our burger in half--I swear it wiggled!  The meat was damn near raw.  We pointed this out to our waitress, and she seemed ok with taking it back.  After she took the burger, we both had an epiphany (we both looked at each other and said, ""I'll bet they cook that same piece of meat--keep in mind it was cut in half!). Our waitress brought out the burger, and we asked her if it was the same burger, and she replied yes, ""they don't like to make you wait!""  Are you kidding me?  They have the audacity to charge $13.00 for a crappy tasteless hamburger, but don't have the decency to offer-up a ""fresh"" burger?  We as a family are so ""over"" this place.  This restaurant is overrated and too expensive for mediocre food at best.  And no, even cheesecake can't save this place."
John G.,"Dayton, OH",12,3,,1.0,5/4/2016,"called ahead for a table for 6. wait staff was so faint of voice and establishment was so noisy we never heard them call us. when we asked how much longer it would be we were told that we had already been seated. really? when we were finally seated the wait staff called us ""guys"". clearly most of us are female and I suspect the waiter was of normal vision. really? guys? the food was mostly dreadful and was reminiscent of my Jr High cafeteria. very ho hum to flat awful. our waitress was so busy she was constantly in a big rush. this place is awful and I will never be back."
Michael M.,"Fairborn, OH",4,1,,5.0,8/22/2015,This was our first time here.  Outstanding food and service.  The appetizer and main course came out hot and very tasty. The salted caramel cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake were to die for.  Highly recommended.
Peter B.,"Dayton, OH",0,4,,5.0,8/20/2015,First time here the food is incredible got the kobe beef burger a mojito and the reeces cheesecake it was heaven and our server shanequa was a delight she was kind accommodating and make excellent recommendations i will most definitely be back :)
Amy N.,"Dayton, OH",281,50,459,3.0,7/11/2013,"Long wait times on weekends + No reservations + hunger = Why I don't frequent the factory often. The menu is pretty overwhelming. I think I've read novels shorter than it. On the upside, if you have a lot of picky eaters in your group everyone is bound to find something to eat!  I'm not the biggest advocate of chain restaurants but The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better options. Rather than ordering a single entree, I decided to make the most of their myriad of options and order three small plates: The Vietnamese sandwiches, crab cake bites, and tuna tartare (See photos). Crab cake bites were the most popular at our table. Light and fluffy texture but still creamy on the inside. Could use a little more crab meat, but those are ""crab"" cakes for you. The Vietnamese sandwiches are banh mi inspired. The dish comes as three small bao sandwiches but are pretty filling. The tuna was well prepared but they could have gone slightly lighter on the soy sauce. Overall this is a good choice for parties of several people as long as you don't mind having to wait for a table."
Debbe T.,"Dayton, OH",55,139,20,5.0,2/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that stays consistent so you are never really disappointed but I have never considered it extraordinary either.  However, this last time I decided to try their Skinny menu.  Honestly,I was expecting something that would be lacking in taste, but I was so surprised.  I started with the Skinny Cosmo, and it tasted better than most regular Cosmos I have had elsewhere, and they did not scrimp on the alcohol either.  I chose the Skinny chicken enchiladas.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and the sauce had just enough spiciness and amazing flavor.  It was served with a side of cold vegetables, cauliflower, carrots and some other things I don't recall.   My husband had the soup and salad combo.  The soup was cream of potato and the the salad had a Greek flair with feta cheese.   He was pleased with his selections. We topped the meal off with of course a slice of cheesecake that we shared.  We had the dolce de leche.  It was very light and delicious.  I could have almost finished the whole thing by myself.  We also had a cup of coffee.  This is one of the few places that serves something other than a mild/medium brew.  It tasted like it was French Roast.  So if you are not a fan of dark roast coffee you might want to skip the coffee.  But for me, I was delighted.  The darker and stronger the better. For some reason, the place was really crowded and it took a little longer than usual to get our food.  I'm attributing this to the weather.  This was one of the first days over a weekend where the temps were Spring-like.  After the winter we have been having I am guess everyone was suffering from cabin fever and needed to get out."
Dakota C.,"Fairborn, OH",47,8,,3.0,5/13/2014,"This place is like any other Cheesecake factory out there. Overpriced but decent food. Nothing really gourmet though. An appetizer with two dinners and deserts will add up very very quickly so be mindful of that. I have never been disappointed with the food and the wait staff always seems to do an ok job.  This is a nice place for a different dinner when you have some extra money to spend. The cheesecake is the only real reason I come here though. Also,  their menu is way to large. They really need to cut it down to ensure quality stays high. I also felt the advertising in the menu was a cheap move that completely took away from the high end look they were going for."
Zach M.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,,4.0,7/9/2015,The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is life alteringly good. The entrees though seem a bit overpriced and the portions are out of control.
Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,4.0,4/4/2011,"The wife and I usually go to The Cheese Factory every couple months and always enjoy it.  We would go more, but we are trying to watch our girlish figures, save cash and whatever excuse we can think of not to go :)   A group of 6 of us went here on a Friday night to have a few drinks and a nice dinner.  As with any Friday night, the wait was long, about 75 minutes.  We knew this going in, so we put in our name and went across to The Pub for a few drinks to wait (more on that later).   Once we got sat, we had a good waiter who took care of us the entire night (Collin?).  The service was good and we managed to go through a few of the baskets of bread and received our food in a manageable time.  We had a little of everything, meatloaf, shepards pie, salads, fried mac and cheese, and BBQ pizza.  My bbq pizza was a generous size (wouldn't expect anything less) and was tasty... Everyone enjoyed the food and was able to take enough home to have for the next day.. We managed to get out pretty cheap, for under $200 for the 6 of each, each drinking more than enough..  We will be back.. eventually."
Denise D.,"Dayton, OH",15,71,199,2.0,10/23/2014,"I didn't want to cook tonight, so we decided to grab something at Cheesecake Factory.  It's very busy as usual, but only 10 minutes wait at 6:00 which is pretty cool.  My son had the Louisiana chicken pasta, and I had a few bites from it - it is pretty awesome!  It's got a little kick from the cayenne pepper and as you keep eating it, it will get even more spicy!!!  Really good!!  My mom had lemon garlic shrimp with angel pasta.  That was OKAY!!  Not enough sauce to give some flavor to the pasta but the shrimp taste great but not many shrimps in that plate.  I had the Miso Salmon.  Ummmm..... I didn't taste any miso!!!  Not sure why the salmon taste more sugar on it than the saltiness of miso.... I didn't taste any miso what-so-ever!  One HUGE disappointment for sure.  I know I shouldn't be so picky with the chain restaurant like this, but if I'm spending average $17-$20 a plate for dinner, I expect a bit more than what we had tonight.  So only one out of three dishes are good, that's why I decided to just give it 2 stars this time.  If I ever make it back there, we'll see if it gets better!"
Lorraine J.,"Dayton, OH",11,13,4,1.0,3/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory always seems like a  tasty idea (great name, right?) but whenever we dine there, our meals feel heavy, salty, and fatty.   Normally, we leave feeling too full, unsatisfied and in need of an undesired nap. Perhaps one reason we feel so exhausted when we leave Cheesecake Factory is that the ambiance almost seems frantic, hurried.  It's almost impossible to have a decent convervsation during dinner because of the noise and general over-business."
Joshua G.,"Indianapolis, IN",67,158,204,4.0,7/10/2013,"I'm a big fan of cheesecake factory I don't care what you say. I love the variety and I love the cheesecake. And boy do they really have both. The menu is almost a magazine and the cheesecake list tops probably 30 varieties. Most of the food is average, but there are definitely some gems. I highly recommend the pork chops, the lettuce wraps, and the salmon. All are great and very filling. Now for cheesecake I'll leave that up to you. All that I've tried are superb.  Bottom line you'll be stuffed after dinner still have room for dessert, and pay more than what you were hoping for, but still be happy and fat."
Sidney S.,"Dayton, OH",66,101,45,2.0,4/1/2013,"I've been hesitant to review but after a 3rd time: I'm firm on this rating.  While the waitress (Erica) was awesome and knowledgeable, she couldn't make up for the obnoxious 20 page menu full of advertisements and 30 min wait on a Friday at 1 pm. My partner and I ordered the salmon carpaccio, Vietnamese Tacos, and Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll, Spicy shrimp and our friend ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Salmon carpaccio was  served  with dinner plate sized sliver of salmon,  red onion, avocado and spicy mayo. Tasty but too many mushy elements together.  The appetizer of 3 Vietnamese Tacos was supposed to be a sticky bun with pulled pork (akin to bahn mi). The bread (DRY) was similar to white bread, also the pork was dry. I could keep going on... The menu tries to cajole one into thinking it is worldly and experienced yet is is really just an ""Americanized"" version of most things."
Neko C.,"Washington, DC",137,312,216,4.0,4/13/2013,"My husband and I came in for just a bit of dessert...and ended up getting dinner too hehe. My husband got the warm crab and artichoke dip and it was okay.  It wasn't as good as the description made it sounded. It was very oily on the top- kinda gross. My Vietnamese tacos were great though! They were like mini Vietnamese sandwiches, which I love!  Soft buns, succulent pork, and crunch veggies- yum!  The best part was dessert though- it's the whole reason we came in! We got the chocolate raspberry truffle and it was Delicious!!! I love love Love chocolate raspberry mousse desserts and this was prefect! Rich chocolate mousse + tart raspberry = taste bud heaven! Next time, I'm getting a whole cake to-go!!!"
