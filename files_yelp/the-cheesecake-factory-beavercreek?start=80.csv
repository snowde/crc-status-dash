Aaron H.,"Lebanon, OH",4,76,8,2.0,1/10/2016,"I'm not opposed to paying for a top quality meal; however, I've been disappointed in every Cheesecake Factory visit to date. I will admit, the Beavercreek location was quite a bit better than the other three visits to Kenwood. This time, the service was fantastic, the meal was average, and the price tag was exorbitant. My wife was pleased with her Pasta Carbonara. It was served piping hot, and the waitress provided fresh shredded Parmesan with no prompting. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and the plate it was served on was warmer than the pasta itself. I sent it back, and the manager brought the refire, correctly apologizing, and asking if it was satisfactory (which it was). My wife and I ordered coffee and cheesecake afterwards, and were pleased with our selections. A shame really, because the front of the house is very clean, very upscale, and the servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and spot on. The kitchen may have just mis-timed my meal, and the manager did make it right, but with so many restaurants to choose from, I think I'll spend my money elsewhere. If someone in my party wants to go, I'll not put up a fuss, but it's certainly not going to be at my suggesting."
Patrick A.,"Schaumburg, IL",6,5,2,5.0,3/11/2015,I wouldn't listen to any reviews less than five stars. Every time I've been here there's at least twenty people waiting to be seated. The food is good and portions are large.
Alex S.,"Xenia, OH",71,29,64,2.0,8/24/2012,"I've never been here without a reasonably sized group. With that said, the few times I've been here we've seemed like an inconvenience to the staff....how dare we go into this restaurant...order food...and offer to pay for it!...Shame on us!  Another peeve of mine is the menu....the bible is a quicker read...showcase your best dishes and alternate with supporting items seasonally...we don't need a 30-page novel. The cheesecake is mediocre at best..."
Keelin C.,"Biloxi, MS",182,226,129,3.0,8/4/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is like any other you might find in the U.S. Good food and yummy cheesecake. It isn't anything super special, and I would tend to agree with others that the customer service is a little hit or miss. If you go on a busy night expect to wait, and expect the hostess station to be a little confused. The wait staff is good sometimes and I have also had some very poor service (usually when it is busy).  I will continue to eat here, because it seems like my friends always choose it, but it isn't my first choice at the Greene."
Shannon V.,"Lebanon, OH",0,4,,4.0,12/17/2015,"Just had a Christmas lunch through work and it was a GREAT experience, the server was awesome and the food was great!"
Keith S.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,2.0,12/7/2014,"Poor bar service. Ordered a drink and the bottle had maybe a half of a shot in it and the bartender was too lazy to get a stool and  pick up the unopened bottle and poor the right amount.   When I mentioned there was very little alcohol in the drink, she got a manger to get the bottle down and charged me for an additional shot.  Not what I would normally expect."
David L.,"Tipp City, OH",13,23,4,3.0,8/13/2015,"the food was quite tasty and the server was excellent. Unfortunately, one major mistake. My wife ordered gluten free pasta (kudos for having it on the menu), but she found spaghetti mixed in. The manager said it was probably left over from the last batch of pasta cooked in the water. What? Yes, they cooked the GF pasta in the regular pasta water. Definitely contaminated. They comp'd the meal, which was nice, but GF should be GF. Some folks could get seriously ill. As it was, she couldn't eat her dinner - I took it home for leftovers."
Hassan A.,"Blacksburg, VA",3,4,,2.0,6/12/2014,It was noisy and crowded. I couldn't even hear my friend he had to repeat a lot. I had to wait 50 mins for table. The food was ok except for deserts which i liked the most.
Tricia M.,"Loveland, OH",1,26,86,1.0,2/16/2014,"Gluten free menu had a shrimp fusilli dish that came out with the pasta so under cooked that it made al dente seem soft. Didn't have time to cook it again so we elected to just eat it. Manager didn't even comp it but thought he was being gracious to give me the $7.95 cheesecake I ordered free vs the $17.50 meal free. Not impressed with that choice but I needed to eat and go. Customer service opportunity could have been amazing but epic fail, in my opinion. Too bad cuz I usually LOVE this place."
Russell S.,"Beavercreek, OH",52,112,18,5.0,4/30/2014,"Not sure who would vote this down but this restaurant is hands down one of my favorite chains and this location does not disappoint. The menu offers almost any type of food from Asian to Italian to traditional American! And then to top it off, pick from a wide variety of cheesecake for dessert. The meals are a bit pricey if you're on a budget but you get large portions and get what you pay for!"
Marie A.,"Cleveland, OH",82,26,15,1.0,4/17/2014,"I ordered their chopped salad minus the bacon.  Needless to say I returned to my hotel room to find raw chicken. Yes RAW bloody chicken on my salad, no avocado and no plasticware as requested. Gross!!!!"
Larry H.,"Bloomington, IN",0,1,,4.0,8/16/2015,"Excellent food, great selection, huge portions and awesome service.  Wait time was longer than expected."
Tommy M.,"Clearwater, FL",2,37,61,1.0,6/6/2015,Being a executive chef I hate giving low reviews like this but on this occasion its warranted. To many bad things to name but I'll give you a few I got there they were busy and said I would be on a wait for ten minutes that turned into 40 then the server came and took our drink order and came back 29 minutes later to take food order I had to point out to her I still had no drink then my apps came out but there was no silverware in the store rolled so that took a additional ten minutes. I ordered food to go as well to be brought out later for my grandmother at home her food came out in a box before our food came out then my dates food came out 15 minutes before mine and they burnt my filet mignon young black manager came out apologized I didn't eat I just left on the bright side manager was nice and it could have been worse he could have still charged me full price. I'm going to give another chance one day
Sarah S.,"Springfield, OH",6,38,9,4.0,7/10/2014,"My husband and I come here often! Its wonderful for brunch, lunch is incredible, and dinner is hit or miss. We normally don't go for dinner because its normally so busy they always pack us at a table that only seats 2 right next to everyone else in the area and your suddenly sharing date night with 40 strangers! Food is out of this world though! Servers normally aren't the friendliest, they are kinda just looking to feed you and get you out!"
Renee T.,"Waynesville, OH",1,4,,2.0,6/1/2014,"I love the building, the cheesecake and the location however the service leaves much to be desired. We were seated 15 minutes before we even got our drinks. When the waitress brought out our bread, we had no napkins, silverware or plates. Took another ten minutes for her to check back at our table and only because I had to flag her down. It was a total hour before our food had arrived. Will not be back."
Erica F.,"Belleville, IL",24,34,5,4.0,9/21/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory brought up my expectations from the low standards I saw at the St. Louis one... I thank them for this because I love cheesecake and was crushed when this chain disappointed. But never fear, this place rescued my feelings for Cheesecake Factory restaurants... Despite a 50 min wait in the early evening on a Saturday, the service was efficient/average waiting for the food order, the waitress was funny, nice, and attentive. The thai lettuce wraps were amazing, appealing visually and healthy in the best way possible... the pineapple upside down cheesecake was so creamy, tangy and perfect."
Tyler D.,"Springboro, OH",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Manager did not care about the customers. Waited over an hour and a half for our meals . Then the manager didn't compensate this time to wait . He said he would give two pieces of cheesecake to compensate this ... And didn't ,he gave one piece of cheesecake and made us pay for cold dry food . Simply just dissappointing and disrespectful. Never will return again . Management simply did not care."
Cincinnati B.,"Cincinnati, OH",21,36,22,2.0,2/27/2011,"I wouldn't say I completely dislike Cheesecake Factory, but it is definitely an over-hyped and over-priced chain. The current (no doubt fleeting) public fascination with the place reminds me of how popular Chi-Chi's was in the 80's (I do have fond childhood memories of those nachos...) Cheesecake Factory's menu is so bloated that it comes spiral-bound. What does it say about a restaurant whose menu is as large as a bible? ""Yes, I would like to order the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Psalm 22, Verse 26, please."" The food is generally hit or miss, undeserving of the higher price point and excessively long waits. And what of the cheesecake? It tastes like any other good cheesecake you've ever had, nothing more, nothing less. The Beavercreek location also has a poorly conceived bathroom location, right near the cramped front reception area.  So during peak times, one must meander through the hordes of people standing around waiting for their group's name to be called.  My girlfriend said the women's restrooms were packed and the commodes weren't flushing at the time of our visit."
Darryl S.,"Miamisburg, OH",9,7,,4.0,10/4/2013,"Just outstanding. The service was great, the food was great and the cheesecake was out of this world. It was a busy Saturday (homecoming) and the wait time was better than expected. About a half hour. Love this place!!!"
Angela M.,"Cross Lanes, WV",21,28,54,3.0,6/1/2013,"The food was good.  However, the wait was crazy.  We were prepared to wait 45 min for indoor seating.  But we were not prepared for people that decided to skip the wait and sit outside.... when the rain started, they started moving those people inside ... in front of the people that had been waiting.  Further, someone came in, wasn't given a ""buzzer"" but got preferred seating.  The wait under those conditions were not pleasant.  On a positive note, our server was excellent and the food was good."
