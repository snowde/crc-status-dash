LaShawna S.,"Sterling, VA",46,82,248,4.0,12/9/2017,"I couldn't decide if i would them 3 stars or 4 stars but i went with 4. This was my first time at this location and my office had our holiday lunch here! I made the reservation for 12:45. Well first let me say, when i called to make the reservation i asked if they took reservations and the guy said No! Then i said 'even for large parties' and he said, well for large parties then YES. He should have said that bc if I hadn't asked further we wouldn't have made reservations.  Fast forward to the date, several folks arrived early and they told them the reservation had been changed to a different time. I was confused bc they called the day before to confirm so who would have changed the time? I called them on my route but they said i called them at noon to change the time which i hadn't!!! At first i thought maybe my boss had called bc we have similar names but she said she hadn't either?? Either way, they were able to seat us outside on their ""outside patio"" which is in the hall of the mall. But It worked out bc we could hear each other opposed to being inside the restaurant where it was very noisy! Bottom line everyone enjoyed themselves at our lunch! The food was good and of course the dessert was yummy so i will visit this location again! **smiles"
Kay S.,"Frederick, MD",4,39,52,1.0,10/30/2017,"I ordered 4 slices of Cheesecake to-go. The server, Saul, started by saying ""gimme a second alright"", with a rather curt attitude. But, I give a pass for that because it WAS very busy and I'm sure he was overwhelmed. I can understand that. THEN he took my order by saying  ""what do you want""....ummmm not exactly the friendly Nature i'm used to getting from the day staff at other locations. I ordered and paid. Then I politely pointed out that the next available slice of pumpkin pecan was missing the pecan portion in the center, and I didn't want to get served that piece. Saul snapped at me....and said ""what"". Then said ""ya ill take a look at it"".  He pulled the tray out and muttered ""not a big deal"", but clearly a huge chunk was missing like from a previous serving spatula grabbing it. He grabbed a tissue and plucked the piece off the tray and plated it and put it in the cooler! Some other poor sap was going to get ripped off!   Then he proceeded to grab the next slice and throw it in a container....literally, dropped it from about 8"" above the counter.  I consider myself a CCF connoisseur, so i KNOW that he shouldn't have even been packing the cheesecake. There are dessert staff behind the counter that tray and top the slices and the server usually packs them in the to go bag. I got annoyed and started texting my husband .....HUGE mistake to take my eyes off my food. A few minutes later, saul slides my bag across the counter. He used a brown paper bag, which cant hold 4 slices well, i shouldve known that, but it didnt dawn on me. I saw no silverware and asked ""can i get some silverware"". Saul replied.... ""whatcha want?""  Then grabbed forks without me responding and said ""forks good"" and threw them on top of the bag.  At that point, I just left. What a terrible experience.  BUT THIS IS THE INFURIATING PART: i live 55 minutes away. I got home and pulled the slices out of the bag.  THE CONTAINERS WERE TOSSED IN THE BAG LOPSIDED!!!! Three of the slices were smashed against the side and broken in middle. I had to scrape the sides of the containers to get the cheesecake and frosting out. Complete sham.  Needless to Say I will never NEVER go back to that CCF. I will eat cheap, thin, stale cheesecake from a gas station before spending another penny at that CCF!! Not to mention it ruined my whole celebration."
Dee R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",38,22,,5.0,10/29/2017,Our server Chase was amazing! 10 STARS FOR CHASE!  We took our buddy out for her birthday and he really made it a great and special occasion. We didn't want or need anything. He was right there ready to help at any time. We will definitely be back to see you Chase! Thank you thank you thank you!
Susana M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,12,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"OMG This waitress ruined our lunch time. She smells so bad, her armpits stink so much. Really uncomfortable situation."
Lina T.,"Chevy Chase, MD",295,235,828,3.0,6/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is conveniently located inside of Montgomery Mall.  I came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm with my fiance and his family. We waited about 15 minutes and then we were walked to our seat.... then the waitress had us walk all the way back to the waiting area because the table was not cleaned up yet -_- We then waited another 5 minutes and then we were finally seated. I was craving their Tuna Salad, but they were completely out.... how disappointing -_- I was surprised that they were out of the tuna at 7pm, but I ended up ordering Skinnylicious Soft Tacos with Shrimp (480 calories). I love how their menu includes the calories for each menu item, it is great for those who want to be conscious of their caloric intake... especially since Cheesecake Factory is known for their hugeeee, often unhealthy, portions. I enjoyed the tacos, nothing amazing, but still good. At $15 it was pricey in my opinion. It comes with avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and shrimp served on soft corn tortilla shells. The avocados were fresh and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. The entree also comes with a Escabeche Salad, pretty much pickled veggies. The salad was average, kind of too sour for my taste, but I did like that it was different from your typical salad.  The waitress was nice and our food came out in a timely manner. The only hiccup of the night was the seating situation... not the end of the world, just a nuisance. There are multiple parking lots, parking should not be an issue. My biggest recommendation would be to either make reservations or anticipate waiting because this place is always busy, no matter what time of day or day of the week that I have been here :P"
Yumi M.,"Chevy Chase, MD",42,107,102,2.0,10/26/2017,"My husband and I were extremely disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory last night. We have been coming to this location ever since it moved from the White Flint Mall location.  Last night, we came here around 9:30pm, the restaurant was not busy and seemed like they had ample servers still working. We were seated immediately, and our server took our drink order. However, he did not ask us if we wanted any bread, and never brought out any of the bread. After waiting for 20 minutes (he had already taken our orders at this point), I asked him to bring us out some bread, and he finally did but the bread was cold! Bread here has always been warm, at least luke warm, but last night, the bread was just cold. Our order also took around 20-25 minutes to arrive even though the restaurant was NOT busy. Not sure what the deal was there, but we have never had to wait that long even during busy hours. Then, we order a slice of cake and we definitely noticed a decrease in size. I am not sure if this is something that the corporate has changed recently but we were incredibly surprised. It seemed that they were trying to fill the plate with whipped cream instead.  I have been a cheesecake factory regular probably since 2012, but last night was definitely one of the least pleasant dining experience. Not sure if this was a one time thing, but next time I hope that the service will be how it was before."
Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1908,1022,9453,4.0,5/8/2017,"Before running our mall errands, we had lunch at  Cheesecake Factory. Our server Zeny was hospitable.  For appetizers, we shared the Avocado Eggrolls, which consisted of three egg rolls stuffed with avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro deep fried in a crispy wonton wrapper, served over crispy vermicelli with a sweet tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Instead of getting his usual, my dad ordered the  Chicken Riesling, which consisted of tender chicken breast sautéed with mushrooms, bacon, onions, and garlic in a slightly creamy white wine riesling sauce. I believe that the pasta tasted better with the same sauce as opposed to the butter parmesan sauce. My mom ordered Skinnylicious Chinese Chicken Salad, which consisted grilled chicken, romaine, carrots, bean sprouts, green onions, cilantro, rice noodles, wontons, almonds, and Sesame seeds tossed in a sesame-soy dressing. Her only compliant was it was a bit soggy. I ordered my usual - Miso Salmon, which consisted of salmon marinated with a sweet miso sake glaze served over white rice and snow peas in a savory  white miso sauce. By the end of the way, all of us were too full to consume cheesecake. My favorites are the Raspberry White Chocolate Swirl and New York Style Cheesecake."
Hibah S.,"Germantown, MD",124,160,125,4.0,5/14/2017,"My party of four came here on a Saturday afternoon with no reservation. It was my graduation lunch, so we didn't make a reservation, thinking the ceremony might go longer than anticipated. Anyway, we had to wait 30 minutes, which was kind of a blower because I was in four-inch heels, needed a seat, and the one seat in the small waiting area was occupied. But the time went by faster than expected, especially considering the place was PACKED. (It's much smaller than I expected, too.) I found the hosts to be less than friendly. They were stale-faced and did not apologize when they messed up our table ticket. But our server, Nick, was fantastic. He was fast, polite, genuine, and got all of our orders right without even writing them down! That is a skill only seasoned servers can master.  The bread was not ready for about 15 minutes and when it came out, it wasn't that good. I've definitely had better bread. The entrees came out in record time. I was baffled. I ordered the Shrimp Bistro Pasta and it was phenomenal. Naturally, it was drowning in butter. But the flavors were on point and done tastefully. The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were breaded. I feel that is unnecessary. The breading on my shrimp was unevenly cooked (partly burnt, partly soggy, not yummy), but if I removed the breading altogether, the bare shrimp were cooked well and tasted better with the pasta. As a side note, if you're watching your weight, just don't come here. They have a ''skinny'' menu, but why? You're surrounded by cheesecake! You will be tempted. Plus, there's no way I would pay $18 for a salad. For dessert, we were very naughty and ordered a slice of cheesecake EACH. We didn't expect the slices to be that big or that amazing, but they were. The Fresh Strawberry is their most popular flavor and I loved it. It's basic cheesecake with a strawberry topping and it's done right. The Salted Caramel tasted just like you would expect true salted caramel to taste like. The Godiva one had big chunks of real Godiva chocolate - holy smokes. The best one by far was the Oreo. Everyone was blown away.  We took half of everything home in boxes because that's how big the portions are. The menu seems to be expensive, but the huge portions make up for it. We also ordered an extra entree and cheesecake to go and our bill was under $150. Not bad for four, essentially five people.  I will definitely be back here. My first visit was a 10/10. Thanks for making my graduation lunch so great!"
Joy B.,"Rockville, MD",170,338,3373,4.0,2/19/2017,"Light, creamy, rich, and dreamy; that is the way I like my cheesecake. No one does it better than the Cheesecake Factory. My latest trip to the restaurant included trying a lighter and healthier Cheesecake ( hahaha).  No really, the base was made out of ladyfingers and it had a raspberry drizzle, with hints of lemon in the cake. The dessert was light and refreshing. It was 700 calories and I split it with a friend, so only a mere 350 calories. That could have been a bagel in the morning or a breakfast muffin, but soooo much more satisfying.    I also have to mention the portabella,avocado,and zucchini fries. They were insanely good. Fried to a crisp, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, each bite was a happy dance in my mouth. It is my new must have dish at Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it is that good!!    The service is always spectacular!  I love the warm brown bread and butter that starts every meal. My go to main dish is the Asian lettuce wrap. The grilled chicken and fresh veggies topped with my favorite peanut sauce is phenomenal!    So whether you are in the mood for a delicious dessert or just want some great food, head on over to Cheesecake Factory and be prepared to be delighted!"
Dan F.,"Potomac, MD",0,2,,1.0,1/9/2018,This restaurant is disorganized and incompetent.  I picked up 2 salads to go and when I get home I realized that 1 of them was missing the chicken. So I called to ask for a refund for one of the salads. I was told only a manager could process a refund and put on hold for 10 minutes. A manager never came to pick up so the woman at the desk promised me that she would take care of it. Not surprisingly  I checked my credit card online and I was never refunded the money. So I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes to talk to a manager. This manager told me that since the incident happened several days ago she was unable to process the refund for me.  Needless to say I would not advise carrying out from this location.
Maximus A.,"Bethesda, MD",1,21,1,4.0,12/28/2017,"A pretty good service for a change!  Place was packed on a Thursday evening at around 6:30pm.  Waited around half an hour to get seated.  Our server was alright, not great.  She seemed to be busy, so she wasn't as attentive as she could have been.  Our food orders and drinks were fine, tasty for the most part and on time.  Not many complaints to celebrate a friend's birthday!!!"
Vince W.,"Chambersburg, PA",11,3,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Wow. Expected the most elite service and food when arriving at his fancy restaurant. To my surprise, the service was almost garbage quality. Our glasses of water never got refilled once but the table right beside us got refilled three times the duration we stayed. The salad had rotting pieces of vegetables on it. Could have made us sick. The parts that weren't rotten looked like they weren't even washed. Salmon was okay. Steak was actually very delicious. All in all, it was okay I guess."
Kiana S.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,11,2.0,12/22/2017,"Do not recommend coming here. Service was terrible. I'm vegan and asked to have avocado instead of chicken in my salad but was given chicken. Part of my meal was forgotten, and there was no apology for it. I was also charged for soda water. When I was given bread I was given no butter, and had to ask for it. Just overall bad service. Don't go here there's a California pizza kitchen really close, just right up stairs of the mall"
Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",528,337,1552,2.0,11/27/2016,"Jeez, what's with the service here? It took over 40 minutes for us to get our check for a mediocre meal. I have a soft spot for Cheesecake Factory because I love the interior and some of their drinks, cake, and apps, but c'mon!! The times I've been to this location have been ridiculous that I wonder why I come back more often than it makes sense. We've tried several things here, apps including -  Avocado Egg Rolls - one of our favorite apps here. A nice crunch, plenty of dipping sauce, filled with avocado goodness.  Firecracker Salmon - totally not worth over the $12. The plating was horrible. It seems that it would have been pretty plating, but by the time it came to our table, it was all on one side that I tried to rearrange it for a picture. The salmon was overly dry, and the stuff was just falling apart.  Wings - nothing special. Some had good amount of meat in them, but overall was dry.  Samosas - again, dry. Dry, dry, dry. We've gotten these lunch items and main entree items -  Sandwich/soup combo - sandwich was alright, regardless of which one you choose - half a turkey sandwich or chicken-almond salad sandwich, with a soup. The sandwiches were pretty good, but the soup was SOOO SALTY!!! I couldn't taste anything else, but the salt. Yuck. The pot of soup is premade, so tough luck there.  Lunch salads - these are alright. Can't go totally wrong with some greens, dressing, toppings, meat. If I were more of a salad person, I'd get these more often.  Fish n Chips - sometimes these are good, but other times they aren't. Sometimes the fish comes out sooooo good, but other times the breading comes falling off, or it's mostly breading and not mostly fish, and the fries come bland.  Burgers - good burgers, but not rememberable burgers.  Kids items -  Chicken - my kids love chicken tenders, but these were just the worst. Chewy, dry, no flavor.  We didn't any refills on our beverages - coffee, water, etc. :(  On the plus side, nothing we ordered was raw or undercooked, ha."
Jessica U.,"Houston, TX",209,70,54,5.0,8/11/2017,"Hands down my favorite place to go for a great salmon. I always get the miso salmon and the mashed potatoes. It is amazing.  The service at this particular location was great. I had Antonia as my server As for bread stick to the brown bread, it's amazing  For appetizer we got the mozzarella sticks.  All in all a great meal"
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,4.0,7/21/2017,"I have been to this C.F. many times. Decided to write a review. I am a fan of the restaurant and I find when I have guest in town, they can always find something on the menu. You can never go wrong with C.F.. Bon Apetit."
Alex W.,"McLean, VA",67,25,,5.0,12/15/2017,"I've been to a few cheesecake factories and eh. But this one was phenomenal. The service and food were outstanding and timely. The GM, Mina, was extremely pleasant and great to communicate with. I look forward to coming here again along with friends and coworkers thanks to Mina."
Mack K.,"Chevy Chase, MD",65,4,,2.0,9/29/2017,"Outrageously expensive, considering the poor in-store takeout service and the quality of food.  A $78 meal for two via carryout last night = no plasticware or napkins (when asked by phone, we said yes) + 10+ minutes waiting for the $8 Oreo milkshake (after paying and receiving the food, which turned cold).  That aside, the food quality was below average at best and cold when I got home due to the 10-minute wait for the milkshake. I live 2 miles from the store. (Perhaps the long wait on the milkshake was due to the server guy getting lost on his way to the bar???).  Until Cheesecake makes up for this, I absolutely cannot and will not recommend this location to anyone. Save your money."
Cam C.,"Washington, DC",68,74,275,4.0,5/21/2017,"I usually visit this location to get a to-go order, usually after I shop in the mall or after going to the movie theater that's upstairs.  For the most part, the service at the front counter is alright. CF is often a busy place, and there have been a couple times the staff has been forgetful.  They forgot my fries one time, but luckily I checked inside my bag before I left.  They quickly brought them out when I brought it to their attention, but the staff did not even apologize or act like they cared about neglecting an entire side item in my order.  Another time they almost forgot an entire order of nachos.  They've also forgotten to include bread and butter when I asked for it (more of a minor issue than a missing appetizer or side order, but still a sign they need to slow down).  I will continue to order to-go food, but I suggest you take a peek in your bag before running out of the restaurant. I recently experienced CF's happy hour for the first time.  I must say I am very pleased!  HH is M-F from 4p-6p.  I was shocked at how large the portions were for HH, and the selection of food and drink items is abundant.  Pretty much all of the food was $5.95.  My friend and I shared a couple of the appetizers (Spinach Dip and Tex-Mex Egg Rolls) and we ordered some drinks (Wine and a Long Island Iced Tea).  I will be back for happy hour without a doubt. I can certainly say this location has good integrity.  My friend forgot her debit card at the restaurant one day.  My friend called the restaurant and a staff member informed her that it was locked in a safe.  She picked up her debit card later that week with no issues. Overall, this is a decent place.  I will be taking advantage of their HH more often for sure!"
Kenny W.,"Silver Spring, MD",111,166,580,2.0,4/12/2017,"Came back for a 2 PM lunch on Wednesday- the server did not refill our water and strawberry lemonade. Too much dressing on side salad that came with our veggie burger.  The chicken in the pasta de vinci was overcooked and dry. Wasn't given big chunks of breast but rather like chick fil a nugget-size and the cream sauce was much saltier than before. Seems like they took a piece leftover chicken and cut into weird little pieces. Also, too much parsley in the sauce. Worst pasta de vinci i ever had and have been ordering this pasta dish for the past 10 years at least.  This is already my second bad experience at this location. Will have to think twice about coming back or will have to drive to the Arundel Mills location."
Claudia E.,"North Bethesda, MD",7,52,117,5.0,4/30/2017,Love Cheesecake Factory. One of our go to spots. Menu is extensive and portions are huge. Can't go wrong with this place.
Jasmine C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",30,120,309,4.0,5/13/2017,"5/5 stars for service || 4/5 stars for food quality  Our server was great!! I cannot say enough good things about him-he seemed experienced and was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The food was pretty good, although I felt that the salmon was a tad on the dry side. The mashed potatoes that came with the salmon were wonderfully flavored. Overall, the entree (I had a lunch special) was generously portioned. My mom loved the lemon garlic shrimp she ordered and my dad really enjoyed his medium rare filet mignon (although a part of it was tendon-y).  The service was great and I'd definitely come back to try other items on the menu!"
Crystal M.,"Bethesda, MD",202,77,532,3.0,8/19/2017,"Good service, good or food. I wanted to update my review since they first opened. The drinks are always good and the staff is attentive."
Mo M.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,24,6,1.0,12/27/2017,"Horrible, waited at our table for 45 minutes for food, shrimp was over cooked, pasta under done, chicken pretty raw. What happened to this place? Coastal flats is my new go to!"
Keith T.,"Bethesda, MD",96,2,,4.0,12/31/2017,"My friend and I went here for lunch yesterday and despite the restaurant being busy, we were sat shortly after arrival. Our server was friendly and greeted us quickly. I had a Margherita pizza and my friend ordered the chicken pot stickers and Korean fried cauliflower. The pizza was good, what you would expect Margherita pizza from Cheesecake to be. However, my friend's pot stickers and cauliflower were amazing and I would definitely order those next time. Always a good spot to come for lunch while visiting in the mall."
Perle N.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",168,63,95,3.0,2/26/2017,"I use to come to this location a lot because my best friend worked here and she was my serve each and every time that I never paid attention to anything else. I took my boyfriend on a date here, it was a slow night but the waiter still managed to forget about the things we were requesting. The food is the same, quantities big as always but I wish the service was a little better."
Brian N.,"Los Angeles, CA",208,331,196,3.0,7/22/2017,"As with all Cheesecake Factories, the selection of cakes is vast but this time I opted for a regular cake - the extreme chocolate fudge cake - which pretty much met all expectations but as with all Cheesecake factory desserts is just too much. The good part about this place is that it is the only one eatery that is open late around the NIH. Stays open later than 5 Guys across the street."
L L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,50,40,3.0,7/26/2017,"The food was good but they did not being all the food out at the same time. The manager apologized for the inconvenience. Also they didn't have the ,crispy crab wontons. I was disappointed about that I had to order crab cakes....."
Max I.,"Silver Spring, MD",313,2,6,1.0,10/21/2017,"I sat at a high-top table in the bar area around 10pm. It was not too busy, and waited about 15 minutes before deciding to leave. The server in the bar area kept walking past me and never brought water after asking for it, so I decided to leave."
Pallabi G.,"Fairfax, VA",264,351,344,3.0,10/13/2016,"As always, the cheesecake here is top notch. I don't think we have ever gone wrong with a cheesecake slice from here. What's even better is their Tiramisu. No, not the Tiramisu cheesecake, but the actual tiramisu. It's really fantastic. My friend and I had a list going of all the tiramisu we had tried from mom and pop Italian restaurants to frozen ones from grocery stores and surprisingly, Cheesecake Factory topped that list. Lucky us! However, I wish the food was as good as the cheesecake. My friends raved about the bread basket but I just thought it was meh. I was really disappointed with the ""spicy"" Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. Not only was any black pepper flavor missing from the dish, but it was soooo sweet. Like corn syrup poured on 1 min before serving sweet. If you want to serve that, fine! BUT don't label it ""spicy"" on your menu.  Will be back for cheesecake, but not the food."
Jackie W.,"Germantown, MD",43,67,41,5.0,2/18/2017,I am watching my weight so I'm always looking for restaurants with calorie conscious menus.  The Skinny-licous menu at Cheesecake Factory is great.  I had the filet beef tips with mashed potatoes and asparagus with a luscious sauce for under 500 calories.  It was so good that my husband got it too the next time we went back even though he doesn't need to watch his weight.  I've also had the salmon and several of the appetizer.  Everything has been great.
Rozu M.,"Rockville, MD",0,18,5,5.0,7/8/2017,"This is our second time coming back after three consecutive bad services and complaining twice online.  The last two services we had were great.  Today, our server is Tony, she is attentive and quick with getting our food out to us.  Our food came out hot. She refilled our water promptly. We never had to look for her because she always came around enough to check up on us.  Food was great and on point!!!"
Cindy E.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",410,2,,5.0,10/19/2017,I absolutely love their food! It's amazing and everyone is respectful towards one another. My favorite dish so far is the Bang Bang and Americano Burger. The deserts are incredible. My favorite one so far is the Red Velvet cheesecake. I would def recommend this one because of its location in the mall. Enjoy!
Lynda N.,"Silver Spring, MD",290,142,410,5.0,5/30/2016,"Came here with a group and both food and service were 5 stars! I hate their dim lighting, it's terrible for my food pictures haha.  But in all seriousness, my experience here was awesome. They have LOTS of options, and it takes awhile to sift through their menu. Our waiter gave us enough time to do just that without forgetting about us. He came in and checked in on us to refill water and bread whenever we needed and was charismatic too.  Now, let's talk food. I like lists so I'll tell you what we got (in the order of my fav to least fav): - Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo w/ white rice - fanfreakintastic! I will be ordering this for myself next time I'm here - Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta - good but could use less oil and the addition of sausage - Chicken and Bacon Carbonara (had lots of peas) - Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta (I believe that's what it's called) - needed more sauce I tried a bit of everything (and a bit more of that gumbo). I was looking at that gumbo the way someone looks at their crush. No lie, it's real good.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that the portions are large enough for you to have enough leftovers for another meal. Something to keep in mind when you see the prices. It's like you're paying for dinner and a late night snack (I like to call it dinner pt 2)."
Samson A.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,2,4,5.0,7/22/2017,Delicious burger. Becon becon burger. First time I had it. Amazing test. Recommended for becon lovers. Best customer service. Loved the place.
Wesley Y.,"Rockville, MD",720,325,623,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is a long overdue review from 3 months ago. I came in @ lunch time with 2 of my friends and we all ordered off the lunch menu. (pointed @ the lunch selection items) We came at about 2:30pm which to me is just a late lunch. Apparently to our server its dinner time. She put in the dinner size portion for us. I didn't realize this while we were eating the entree because the portions are huge @ cheesecake factory. I tried to order 3 cheesecakes and use our coupons that we had to redeem free cheesecakes (I purchased $200 in giftcards and got some free  silces of cheesecakes). We waited about 10-15 minutes for the cheesecake. We told the server to pack the cheesecake togo because it was taking too long and my friend had an Uber  waiting outside the restaurant going to the airport.  When the server brought the check and the 3 cheesecakes I saw the check and realized that we were charged for dinner portions. I asked to speak with a Manager and she told me we have to Specifically tell the server we want lunch portions when we come in for lunch. This should definitely be a server's immediate response if they have customers ordering lunch items maybe they should ask do you want the lunch or dinner portion. Just plain ridiculous. After arguing with the  manager over the bill my friend had to leave and couldnt wait anymore. She comes back and tells me that we can only redeem 2 cheesecakes because we have 2 people. After lots of explaining the server didn't even try to help explain to the manager we were a party of 3.  Worst experience I've had @ cheesecake ever. This location is just going down the drain. Loved the restaurant more when it was @ white flint. The new servers, manager and entire staff i feel just don't care anymore."
Sam T.,"North Bethesda, MD",130,448,1793,5.0,10/15/2016,I am normally not a fan of CCF except for cheesecake but the wife and I needed to eat at the mall to make our movie on time. I suggested the CCF and it was a great choice for a quick Friday date night dinner. We were seated within 5 minutes and our food was absolute delicious. I had the Bacon Bacon burger and as much as I love a good burger this burger was top notch. We came back after the movie and got cheesecake to go!
Edson H.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,9,7,2.0,10/1/2017,Cheesecake is our go to spot but it has recently become a hit or miss with the customer service. Last night we decided go and it was definitely a miss. We ordered our favorite avocado egg rolls and ended up waiting 40min to get them. The waiter also got our drink orders wrong and took long to bring the correct ones back. Even when the manager asked how were doing and we explained what was going on nothing changed and we still got charged for our appetizer after we asked to cancel them because it was taking too long. We love this place but we have been really disappointed in the customer service recently.

The French fries were served cold and tasted like cardboard, with no salt at all. We also ordered our all time favorite Avocado Rolls, usually they are crisp and warm, they were served cold and soggy. It appeared like they were sitting out too long before they were served. The only saving grace was Zucchini fries.  We asked our sever for small bowls of ice cream and she came with large 3 scoops bowls, little attention to detail and what the customer wants. Disappointed, will think before I visit again."
Sharon W.,"Silver Spring, MD",86,367,,3.0,9/7/2016,"Previously, I rated The Cheesecake Factory based on the D.C. and White Flint locations and only gave it one star. Recently I met friends for lunch in Bethesda at The Cheesecake Factory now located in Montgomery Mall (my friends' choice). The restaurant is easy to locate and has plenty of parking within easy walking distance. There is also valet parking for a nominal fee, and they'll stamp your ticket in the restaurant. The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out. It's still noisy, but 5 of use had no trouble conversing. One of the best parts of the visit was our server, Scott. I can't imagine what he thought when he saw our table of five 50 years+ women. He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.  Since Montgomery Mall is a convenient place to meet friends in the Bethesda area, and we had a pleasant experience at this location, I'd actually suggest it myself as a nice place for lunch."
