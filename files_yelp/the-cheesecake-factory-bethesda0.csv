Kris C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",20,12,1,3.0,12/23/2013,"The restaurant just moved from White Flint Mall to Montgomery Mall, so they are still settling in. They ran out of the mahi mahi and the teriyaki chicken when we dined there. I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and enjoyed their chicken salad sandwich and was still unable to finish the entire dish. Definitely make room for their signature cheesecakes.  The valet parking was complimentary for diners.  So take advantage of this.  Just make sure you ask your server to validate your ticket before you leave the restaurant."
Joyce W.,"Silver Spring, MD",3,7,,3.0,12/30/2013,"I actually went the first day they opened at the new location. Parking is difficult because, duh, you're at Montgomery Mall. Parking over here is always difficult, so I wasn't surprised. At least you can roam the larger mall (than compared to White Flint), when waiting. The service was okay. I felt like our waiter was rushing us a bit even though it wasn't that busy. Food was so-so, but comparable to when they used to be at White Flint. Don't know if I'll be back soon because parking is a pain."
Ms. Toni D.,"Washington, DC",0,21,22,4.0,3/8/2015,I brought my mom to this location for a birthday lunch and everything was delicious.  My mom had the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was wonderfully spicy and I chose the grilled salmon so as to have room for dessert.  We shared Craig's Outrageous cheesecake and it was to die for!!!
Angel S.,"Lorton, VA",63,19,61,5.0,3/7/2015,"Great place, the servers are super nice, and the food is always hot and fresh, no complaints, two thumbs way up!"
Katie W.,"Damascus, MD",2,19,,5.0,3/12/2014,"Yum yum yum yum! My husband and I visited on a Saturday night at peak time. We were given a buzzer and told there was a wait, which we were expecting. So we went to the bar and enjoyed some drinks, which we finished just before the buzzer went off. We were brought to our table and our friendly waitress brought out bread and drinks quickly. She was obviously very busy but provided good service overall. We ordered buffalo blasts as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken Marsala and my husband chose the smokehouse BBQ burger. Food was delicious, on a scale of one to ten I'd give it about a twelve. As is the case with the Cheesecake Factory, there was a ton of food and our waitress was happy to box up the leftovers, as well as two pieces of cheesecake (Oreo and s'mores), which we enjoyed the following day. I've noticed a few recurring themes in negative reviews. One is that there is a long wait. Of course there will be a wait, since it's a very popular restaurant! But you will get seated eventually, like I said we came at a very busy time and were seated in about a half hour. The other complaint I see a lot is the price. But considering the portion sizes it's not that bad, you will almost certainly have enough for leftovers so you're really getting two meals out of it, of superb food! We can't wait to return, a truly great restaurant! Yum yum yum yum!"
Jenny A.,"Damascus, MD",0,12,,3.0,2/19/2013,"I would give this 5 stars for the quality of the food, but that is only 1 aspect of the dining experience.  A lot of people complain about the prices, but that doesn't bother me too much, since, I know the quality is good and consistent. As for the wait staff, it really depends on a lot of factors: are you getting a waiter on a bad day? A stressed environment (which it always is...) I can't fault the waiters, and I really can't stand it when diners get mad at the waiter for their food not being cooked properly or brought out on time. The waiter is not the cook, so give them so slack. As for the long lines and noisy atmosphere, I guess it's worth, as I will keep coming back, but only 3 total stars for having to deal with long lines, and a noisy restaurant."
Michael C.,"Potomac, MD",1,29,1,5.0,7/13/2014,I come here quite often since it's really close to my house. The staff is very professional and helpful. They always try to be as speedy and efficient as possible without sacrificing quality and friendliness. The food always comes out fast and well made. It's nice that they relocated to Montgomery Mall since they are getting a lot of well deserved business now. They even have valet parking for those that prefer it.
Andrea R.,"Smithfield, RI",9,54,15,3.0,10/11/2014,"Check in is a nightmare.  Excellent. Waiter.   Food was good, except mashed potatoes that were not mashed."
John N.,"Rockville, MD",166,170,22,4.0,1/16/2013,"Complain all you want, but this place rocks.  As one of the previous reviewers pointed out.....It is a Chain.  So lets break this down for a better understanding of why its awesome. 1st -  As the name suggests its a Factory!! What other place do you know of that has 654561681 different menu items that they can reproduce within 15 minutes of ordering and have it taste the same every time.  Not only do they pump out food they do so in ginormous portions.  Im always good for at least 2 full meals when I go because the leftovers will be plenty filling. 2nd - Since it is a chain, no matter what Cheesecake factory you go to, whether its here or in bum fuck Kansas......and I mean really, who ever visits Kansas?  Anyways, you know that you are going to get the same quality in food.  Sorry Mom and Pop shops, your food does me no good when I am half way across the country and you are in Maryland. 3rd - Where else do you know that serves 33 different flavors of Cheesecake?  And if you don't like cheesecake.....well then you sir, have got mental issues!! Dont come here expecting something different than what it is For me its all about the Cajun Jambalaya over rice with just Shrimp.  And I always get an extra side of the sauce.  That way if you are asian like me.....you can go home cook more rice dump that Saucy goodness into the rice and enjoy a second serving. Cheesecake wise, Im a fan of the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake."
Donald B.,"Rockville, MD",2,6,,2.0,10/17/2015,"Waited 30 minutes for a table. Not to bad for a Saturday night. But after ordering our meals, we waited 30 minutes for them to tell us that they ran out of GF pasta, which was for my 10 year old, and they had to make a new batch. After another 30 minutes they tell us that they are now boiling the pasta. The manager came out to apologize, but that was it. We finally got our food after an hour and twenty minutes. They never even computer the kids meal or offered her a free dessert. Not exactly the service I expected from a place with their reputation."
Alexey G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2015,"Came for the National Cheesecake Day to buy a half-price slice of cheesecake at the counter. I was told that I can order it now but the wait to complete the order would be one hour and a half! Lots of very frustrated people were standing around, waiting for their slice, complaining... If one decides to offer something at half-price, shouldn't one be prepared that many people will show up? So it's like half-price but only for those people who are willing to waste 90 minutes to save $5 :)"
Krista A.,"Montgomery Village, MD",11,5,2,1.0,5/11/2014,"Advertising and communication of staff was terrible. And it ruined our Mother's Day celebration. We called the night before Mother's Day to see if they would take reservations. They said between 9-10am on Mother's Day they would be accepting reservations. We called at 9:10am and were told they are no longer taking reservations. When asked, if they had filled up the staff person in the phone just laughed and did not give am answer. We decided to head over to this location in the evening so we called ahead to see what the wait time would be. We were told that we would have to come to the location to find out and that they do not quote wait times over the phone. So we take the 25 min drive and arrive to find out the wait time is 2hrs! Meanwhile we see signs plastered to the doors advertising that they world take reservations between 9-9:45am."
Desiree D.,"Fairfax, VA",17,210,19,1.0,4/27/2014,"I am rarely this disappointed with a restaurant experience. We ordered to-go at the office and I decided on the same dish I normally get when dining in here (orange chicken). The chicken was very overcooked and extremely dry with a serious lack of sauce. The vegetables were burnt so badly that they were inedible. In fact, my entire dish tasted like charred food. The only thing cooked properly was the rice, however with such a lack of sauce and no soy sauce, it only added to the dryness. I will be making a formal complaint about this lunch experience. It was that bad!"
Roy S.,"Takoma Park, MD",91,468,3,4.0,7/24/2011,Get the Vietnamese tacos!!! You will be glad you did... Otherwise everything else is not to bad but pricey.
Elias V.,"Kensington, MD",13,117,1,4.0,8/26/2013,"I need to start off by saying this, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta!! This was a party of flavor. Ok now that I got that out the way let me continue to say Marina was so so nice and friendly. This was on Saturday, August 24th about 10pm, now I will say we did have an order mishap. Not to alarm anyone, within about 5minutes we had the correct dish out. I felt bad because if you guys met our server she was beyond nice, when we made her aware of the onions on the food she looked like she wanted to cry. She took care of it beyond an expedited manner and we all ate our food on time. Food was great, Service well I have already applauded that and environment was like all other Cheesecake Factory's. I did take off one star, I'll explain what happened. We obviously wanted a dish with no onions and our server took care of that. We had no issues or complaints until the Manager came along. She did the usual blah blah blah and what bothered me was that she said that the order was not incorrect that it was the guacamole that had onions. Um, cool but there are still onions elsewhere else, cool story. Instead of making a situation right she tried to justify the order being correct. Look, you apologized and did your part leave it alone. Let's not fumble the situation and add a story that makes you look bad. I would have taken another star off but our server was too good to not give credit too. She not only took care of the situation herself but make us feel invited and happy. That is all,"
Alex Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",7,29,4,5.0,9/10/2014,"I really want to hate this place. I really really do but godanngit they just never disappoint. I have been to this location about 3 times now and everytime I go the service and food is on point. I don't think there is enough insulin in the world to stop me from going into a diabetic coma after a visit here. 11/10,would go again to have 2000 calorie cheesecake slice."
John A.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,5,,4.0,1/30/2015,"I love this Cheesecake Factory!! Great location, great waiters, timely service even during the holidays!! I love the calamari and the Miso Salmon dish is a must try. I have been to many chain restaurants and this is one of my favorite!!"
C X.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,8,,2.0,7/18/2014,"The two stars are because I had good meals here in the past, but one star for my meal here recently, as it was unacceptably bad.  I ordered fish and it came out cold and tasteless and with a weird rubbery texture. I also order beef kabobs, however what I got was not really kabobs. It was blobs of ground beef shaped into kabob shapes which tastes bland and a little undercooked, and dry. Seriously, they were like bad hamburgers, not kabobs. The wraps for the kabobs did taste good though.  My waiter was courteous and professional, and I appreciate that very much."
Lana L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,35,,1.0,2/24/2015,"Never will I eat here again!!!!!!!!!!! Customer service is awful and the food is not as good as other Cheesecake Factory locations. I took my office here for lunch to celebrate a birthday, thinking it would be a good experience since they have many different choices available. I regret it because the food was awful and the service was just as bad. With the cost of the food, one would think they would do a better job than they do. It's also so busy here that you really don't get the customer service you deserve because the servers are focusing on getting as many tips as possible by waiting a lot of tables as opposed to refilling your drink or making sure your food is cold, for example. On the other hand, I haven't been in one Cheesecake Factory that isn't busy, but the food and service is much better than this one! To add insult to injury, it's noisy as hell in this one!  I did have the decency to call the General Manager, Liz, and spoke to her about how embarrassing it was for me to suggest this place and then I and my coworkers weren't happy with the quality of the food or the service. She did apologize and offered (in January) to send a gift certificate for just the cost of my meal ($30) and told me it would be in the mail and at my address in a week, but after 6 weeks went by I hadn't received it.  I called to follow up and despite the fact that the hostess told me that she was there, Liz refused to take my call. I even left a message about what happened with my name and number, and she never called me back--that was over 2 weeks ago. WOW! I've been to really great Cheesecake Factory locations (like the one on Wisconsin and the one at Columbia Mall) and this is definitely not the experience I've had, so I'm thinking it's just this location. I think they are riding on the laurels and good reputation of a lot of really fantastic Cheesecake Factories that actually value customer service."
Aaien T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,168,16,1.0,6/11/2015,"I have been to dozens of cheesecake factorys all around the country and this one is very below par of their brand and standard. I went on a Tuesday night and the hostesses were a hot mess, they just buckled under the pressure. TheY first sat me at a booth right next to the bar and the knook of a busy smelly bus boy station. It STUNK like pukey trash and bar stench- there was no way we could eat a meal sitting there. We told our waiter and she was extremely unhelpful which was just. Once we finally got new seating many minutes later our waiter forgot our bread, brought out our dinner and didnt clear the appetizers so we almost got food and drinks knocked over. She took SO LONG to do everything, the service is extremely poor, the waiters and hosts dont have customer service in mind."
