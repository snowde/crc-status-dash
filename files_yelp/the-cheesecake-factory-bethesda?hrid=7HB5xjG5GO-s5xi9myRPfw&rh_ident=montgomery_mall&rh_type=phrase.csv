Michael C.,"Potomac, United States",1,29,1,5.0,13/7/2014,I come here quite often since it's really close to my house. The staff is very professional and helpful. They always try to be as speedy and efficient as possible without sacrificing quality and friendliness. The food always comes out fast and well made. It's nice that they relocated to   since they are getting a lot of well deserved business now. They even have valet parking for those that prefer it.
Sharon W.,"Silver Spring, United States",86,367,,3.0,7/9/2016,"Previously, I rated The Cheesecake Factory based on the D.C. and White Flint locations and only gave it one star. Recently I met friends for lunch in Bethesda at The Cheesecake Factory now located in   (my friends' choice). The restaurant is easy to locate and has plenty of parking within easy walking distance. There is also valet parking for a nominal fee, and they'll stamp your ticket in the restaurant. The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out. It's still noisy, but 5 of use had no trouble conversing. One of the best parts of the visit was our server, Scott. I can't imagine what he thought when he saw our table of five 50 years+ women. He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.  Since   is a convenient place to meet friends in the Bethesda area, and we had a pleasant experience at this location, I'd actually suggest it myself as a nice place for lunch."
Nomin D.,"Springfield, United States",131,740,806,5.0,2/2/2015,This is an awesome addition at  .  Restaurant itself is spacious and staff is usually friendly. Food options are as expected and comes out food.  I've been here several times and had good experience with all of them!
William F.,"Bethany Beach, United States",0,169,,3.0,2/11/2016,"Went here while waiting for our car to be serviced.  It was a few minutes before 4 o'clock (Happy Hour) and the waitress who seated us felt the need to tell us several times that it was not 4 o'clock yet. We told her we would wait five minutes before ordering, which we did.  After that, she was friendlier; and my wife and I were both quite happy with the food and drinks, as well as with the Happy Hour prices. The decor in this new location at   is also very nice. This is not, however, the place to come to lose weight. The calorie counts on the menu are scary."
beth s.,"Silver Spring, United States",0,14,3,1.0,25/3/2016,"This is a critique of the management staff Cheesecake Factory. I ate at the restaurant at   in Bethesda, MD last night with a girlfriend. We each ordered a salad and I got a glass of sangria. When the bill came my drink vas very nearly as much as our salads - $11.50! Knowing I would not have ordered the drink if I knew it was going to be that much, I asked to see the menu to check the price. What do you know --- there were no prices next to the drinks! I did not fault the waitress but expressed my shock and asked to speak to the manager. I knew well this was a policy decision. A very youthful and inexperienced Jennifer came over and inquired. I explained my frustration. She just gazed at me. Then I was interrogated about when I realized drink prices were not listed on the menu. Really? So much for listening to the customer's concerns. She informed me that ""many restaurants are doing this now"" as if this was news. That doesn't make it ok in my opinion. I can go elsewhere. Then Manager Jennifer asked if I wanted her to take our check to the register. I said NO!  I explained that I felt not listing drink prices was misleading and rude, like I had been tricked. They could list the calories, but not the prices? More gazing by Jennifer. She finally asked what I wanted her to do. I said she could either remove the drink form my bill (if there are no prices maybe the drinks should be free?) or at least give me a discount of half for my frustration and to make me a happy customer again. She took the bill and disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back she handed me the bill with all of a $2 DISCOUNT! REALLY??? What an insult  and snub and I told her so. I said I would never be back. Do not eat at the Cheesecake Factory unless you're okay with deception. In my Opinion its a place where there is a Culture of rudeness and unprofessionalism."
Julie H.,"Gaithersburg, United States",31,144,349,4.0,19/2/2015,"So glad that Cheesecake Factory relocated to  , its more convenient to go to and always a good place to stop in after some shopping. I find that this restaurant is a lot smaller than the one at White Flint, but there's also an ""outside"" area that allows you to sit out in the mall area. The service here is pretty quick, and the staff are friendly. I've waited some time to write a review even though I went here on opening week and it was awful (but I returned and its back to the same Cheesecake Factory that I know). The first week that I came here, three of us ordered a pasta dish and red velvet cheesecake. Each and every one of your pasta dishes was extremely extremely salty. It was awful. We got it as carry out, so we couldn't really say anything. It was unbearable to eat. The cheesecake was excellent. After a few additional times visiting Cheesecake Factory, and reordering their pasta - its back to normal and not the salty dish that we first got when we went there. My favorite pasta at Cheesecake Factory is their Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I also enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The portion is large enough to make me full and is really sauce and great with their brown bread. Their mac & cheese burger is also yummy, however the burger is overcooked even if its preferred as medium. I enjoy order the claim as an appetizer, it comes with two sauces to dip with. Even if Im not hungry, I still stop by to get a slice of red velvet cheesecake."
Kris C.,"Gaithersburg, United States",20,12,1,3.0,23/12/2013,"The restaurant just moved from White Flint Mall to  , so they are still settling in. They ran out of the mahi mahi and the teriyaki chicken when we dined there. I ordered from the skinnylicious menu and enjoyed their chicken salad sandwich and was still unable to finish the entire dish. Definitely make room for their signature cheesecakes.  The valet parking was complimentary for diners.  So take advantage of this.  Just make sure you ask your server to validate your ticket before you leave the restaurant."
Joyce W.,"Silver Spring, United States",3,7,,3.0,30/12/2013,"I actually went the first day they opened at the new location. Parking is difficult because, duh, you're at  . Parking over here is always difficult, so I wasn't surprised. At least you can roam the larger mall (than compared to White Flint), when waiting. The service was okay. I felt like our waiter was rushing us a bit even though it wasn't that busy. Food was so-so, but comparable to when they used to be at White Flint. Don't know if I'll be back soon because parking is a pain."
Kimberly L.,"Olney, United States",0,7,,4.0,10/6/2014,"I like having the Cheesecake Factory in  . It's closer to my office and a good place to dine for lunch. Their SkinnyLicious menu offers a variety of options at a cheaper price.  Their portions sizes are smaller, but great for the lunch hour.  I did not realize they do accept reservations during the lunch hour, but the majority of the party has to be present in order to be seated.  As long as you tell people to be on time, you should have no problems being seated and greeted with great service.  I have not had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have always been satisfied with the food for dine-in and take-out."
