Andy P.,"Rockville, MD",3,25,2,4.0,5/17/2016,"There are special days when you just want to eat food from different cuisines. The experience begins with a bread basket, followed by appetizer, entree and ends with the awesome cheese cake. The menu is vast and each item is more tempting than the previous one. We went to the Cheesecake Factory during lunch, and experienced a long wait due to how busy the place was. Afterwards, when we were escorted in a very friendly manner to the table where we were to dine at, we received a bread basket. The bread was sweet, buttery, and oh-so-sweet, with a crunchy exterior and soft, melts inside, as bread should be. We started with Beets and Goat cheese salad, Crispy mini Crab cakes and Bail, Tomato flatbread. This is part of the healthy menu. We had the yummy spicy bang bang shrimp, Filet Mignon and steak Diane. unfortunately we couldn't experience the cheese cake as we were full."
Anna N.,"Alexandria, VA",120,271,364,2.0,12/6/2015,"Every time I've been here there's been a problem- either food or service. Doesn't seem to happen nearly as much at other cheesecake factory's. On this visit tonight the front desk was helping someone with an issue. We waited 4 minutes then I asked if they had a flight. She said ""I'm helping someone else."" I said yea I know I just wondered if there was a wait so we would no. She could have just said yes/no. Instead she again in an even ruder voice said ""I'm helping someone else"". So we left. I called and talked to the manager, and after waiting 20 minutes on hold, talked to Shania, and her only offer was that if we wanted to drive back we could and she would seat us."
Kathryn L.,"North Bethesda, MD",598,725,5211,4.0,1/10/2015,Thank you Beewau for your quick & great customer service. That's a plus even with takeout & on a busy Saturday night.
Sariah T.,"Hyattsville, MD",8,3,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"If I could give zero stars, I would. My husband and I came here on our anniversary with our heart set on steak. We both ordered the filet mignon to only have the waitress come back a few minutes later to tell us they were all out. She said they only had ribeye and New York strip left. So we both ordered the ribeye only to have her come back a few minutes later to say they were all out of ribeye and New York strip. So I kindly asked for the manager. When she arrived, she apologized for being out but said there was nothing that she could do. I told her that it was our anniversary and she didn't even offer to compensate us with at least a piece of cheesecake for our troubles. I asked her if there was anything she could do so we could at least come back tomorrow. She again said she could not offer us anything and left as fast as she came. Can you say anniversary dinner ruined! Definitely WILL NOT be coming back to this location!"
Racha H.,"Germantown, MD",0,25,3,4.0,4/23/2016,"As always, Cheesecake Factory didn't disappoint.  The food was good and there was a nice selection. Something for everyone. The finale to the meal was White Chocolate Raspbery cheesecake. Always soooo good."
Kenneth K.,"Silver Spring, MD",2396,82,109,4.0,8/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of the better quality chains.  This is the first location I have been to in the east coast, as I've been to others near St. Louis, Chicago, and Phoenix.   The food was about what I would have expected.   I unfortunately ordered the avocado egg rolls and fish tacos at the same time and only ate about half the fish tacos.   In terms of service it was pretty good, but seems they could have been refilling our drinks a bit more.   I will give credit to the waitstaff here as our wait was shorter here on a Saturday night than the one in Chesterfield, MO and we often wait longer than the usual 30-45 minute wait there.  Here it was only about 15 minutes and the hostess saw us and apologized for it being a bit longer and said it would only be a few more minutes."
Robyn S.,"Keysville, VA",16,25,9,4.0,4/26/2016,"I ate here with my friend from Bethesda roughly a week ago and I was so excited because I rarely ever get to eat at The Cheesecake Factory - I'm from out of state and the closest one to me is over 60 miles away. We were told it'd be a 20 minute wait and we asked to be seated in the 'fake outside' - the part of the restaurant outside of the main restaurant room, but still inside of the mall. We were told they were short handed and couldn't seat is out there, but we noticed other people were seated out at the tables and my friend talked to the wait staff until they agreed to put us out there when our time came to be seated. I don't know about the rest of you, but I can't hear myself think straight in that main room where it sounds like everyone is shouting at each other. We ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and found it to be a little bland, but I added salt and found that it was improved greatly with just that. I gobbled up what I hoped was half of the dish while my friend was displeased and sort of gave up on it. I drank a red sangria with my food and found it to be rather delightful. When it was time to pick a piece of cheesecake, I felt very torn. I adore cheesecake and can never remember which ones I've tried during the few experiences I've had with TCF. I ended up choosing the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake and it was DIVINE. I couldn't finish it and would have taken it with me, but I was leaving in the morning for a road trip and wasn't sure if remember it was in my friend's refrigerator. I think I'll order the same kind whenever I manage to return to a TCF, though!"
Simón S.,"North Bethesda, MD",70,17,1,5.0,5/9/2016,"Looking for a classy, accessible and delicious dinner? This is it. Honest to god, I love coming here. I know I can be treated like a king, served food like a king but pay like what I really am, a working class student who wants to impress his date. It's also a great family place. It's usually my family's choice of restaurant to go in any kind of occasion. We do obviously try new things,  but whenever we don't feel like thinking about when and where too much, we pick here. It usually has a waiting time of 30-50 minutes so it's better to go from 3:30-6pm when it's not that full and you'll get a more calmer experience. And of course, the cheesecake is brilliant.  I'd definitely recommend the Smoke House Burger with secret sauce with home made fries. It's basically my favorite plate."
Tupper W.,"Lagraulière, France",2,54,,3.0,12/23/2015,"Godiva chocolate cheesecake gets them an extra star! Quick summary: bar lost our drink order, burger not cooked correctly. Small portion of salmon and mediocre food in general ( i could do better at home). Had to keep asking for extra plates and utensils. Not enough napkins. Too busy with not enough staff."
Winnie L.,"Irvine, CA",103,101,136,4.0,2/29/2016,"Everything was delicious as usual. Staff needs a little more training, she wasn't bad by any measure but seemed really nervous, not with it and not as attentive as I expect from a Cheesecake Factory. 3.5 stars because of the waitress."
Effie A.,"Silver Spring, MD",86,75,44,1.0,6/29/2016,"I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant, the way Cheesecake Factory disrespected my family. On June 23rd, I brought my family here to celebrate my dad and youngest brothers birthday. When our server (Brandon J) came by to ask what we wanted to drink, we told him without hesitation. 3 of us ordered Shirley Temples, my mom ordered mango juice (which was pink but we're not going to talk about that) and my dad ordered pineapple juice. When the drinks came out my dad noticed that his pineapple juice was basically ALL ICE. So he called the server back to let him know that he doesn't like ice and would just like a glass of pineapple juice. The server comes back with a shot of pineapple juice in the same glass. (Now bear with me.. because I don't have a picture, I'm going to use numbers to help you get a better idea of this). The glass was about 5-5.5 inches tall, they poured just an inch of pineapple juice in the glass and gave it to my dad who came there to celebrate his birthday. That's literally 2, maybe 2.5 sips from the straw and it's finished.  When my dad called the server out on it, the server said ""you didn't want ice so we strained it"". WHAT?! We were shocked! We couldn't believe he wanted us to pay full price for a shot of pineapple juice. So the server then gets his manager (Amos), who said the same exact thing the server said ""we strained the pineapple juice because you didn't want ice"". We felt so insulted. Common sense is clearly not so common at that restaurant. After letting him know that it was absolutely disrespectful, the manager told my dad he would get him a full glass of pineapple juice. Which was what should have happened in the first place. When our check came, they had charged us for 2 glasses of pineapple juice instead of 1. So we had to call them out on that too. We left feeling like they were playing a prank on us. I'm not sure I'll be back there again. I'm definitely not spending my hard earned money on them."
Emily H.,"Escondido, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/23/2016,"My boyfriend, Andrew, and I went to Cheesecake factory this past weekend thinking it would be a positive experience, like every other time we had gone. Andrew is the manager of a sales team, and as a team dinner we decided to all head over to the restaurant. We had a party of about 15. Everything about dinner was great, the food and the service were wonderful, or so we thought. When the check came around, it was about $77 for the whole meal. Including a $14 tip for the waitress, the total came out to about $91. We put $70 in cash into the check holder along with a debit card to cover the remaining balance of about $21.  I thought that this was common knowledge, seeing as how I have worked in my fair share of restaurants, that when both cash and a card are put into the check holder it means to use the cash first and then put the remaining balance onto the card- but if the waitress had any questions about this we would certainly be more than happy to clarify that for her. She had no questions and brought us back the receipt. Andrew did not realize that she had charged him the ENTIRE $91 onto his card AND also taken the cash. That is the problem.  If she would have charged the card for the whole thing and given our cash back, things would be just peachy but she did not.  Andrew did not notice that he was charged for the whole thing until yesterday (Wednesday 6/22). He called the store and the general manager, Liz, told us that he signed a legal binding document agreeing to be charged $91. That is fine. But give us back our cash. To this she responded, ""Well we have no way of proving that there was any cash taken by the server. We will call and ask her and its basically her word against yours"". That is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, we should have been paying a bit more attention at the time and noticed then, but the nature of the  response we have received and lack of any customer service what so ever is appalling to me. I do not see how it is difficult to check the logs which, I would assume must be kept when each drawer is counted out each night and see if that particular drawer was over $70. She has not even given us the courtesy of checking back to that day and seeing if there was any mysterious extra cash anywhere in the restaurant. And if that drawer was not over at all, maybe you have the bigger issue of a waitress that is stealing from the customers. Liz has basically told us ""sorry, but your stupidity lost you $70 to us"". She claims that she called the waitress that rang up our bill, but the waitress has not called back. I'm sorry but that is not my problem. We brought at least $500 in service that night with our entire sales team, and after that experience and how the general manager and the staff of this Cheesecake Factory have been handling this, I will never bring my business back there again."
Karen G.,"Charles Town, WV",8,13,5,4.0,10/22/2016,Food and service is always great no matter what day of the week or what time of the day we come in here the ladies room is disgusting disgusting disgusting and an hour after I tell somebody about it female management the bathrooms are still disgusting disgusting disgusting. So sad
Brenda R.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,5,1,4.0,10/17/2016,"This cheesecake factory is great! Although I was put off by the fact that it was in a mall, there is always parking within a good range and they even have a valet. The food is good, although a tad bit over priced. As always the cheesecake is to die for and I really liked that they pack your food for you. Our waiter was good at tending our table without being really annoying. Overall, I had a great date night and wouldn't mind coming to this location again (:"
Adam J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1194,250,291,2.0,9/15/2014,"It was a typical Cheesecake Factory, for the most part. We ordered the buffalo blasts as an appetizer and they were inconsistent. Some were cooked right but half were way overcooked and pretty much inedible. The crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce was pretty good but the fries that were served with it were warm as if they've been sitting out for a while. Tried the girlfriend's jambalaya pasta and it was flavorless.  The portions of everything were huge and the service was great but they really need to improve the quality of their food otherwise I don't see them sticking around for very long."
Marc P.,"Apex, NC",99,9,5,2.0,3/25/2017,"It's been a year since I last ate here... Dragged in by my gf. A year ago it would be a one star but they got that skinnylicious menu now and definitely bumps them up to 2 stars. Got the basic skinny burger which was edible. Everything on the menu is sweet. Bread, salads, appetizers, it like the made cheesecakes and the left over sugar they didn't know what to do so they poured it on everything else... Never have I seen a menu where salads were at 2000 calories. It's 2000 calories worth of sugary dressings."
Diaz M.,"Silver Spring, MD",107,126,103,4.0,5/22/2016,Better service today. Food was great. Staff was friendly. Restaurant was clean. Tight running ship for a busy Sunday.

Robyn K.,"District Heights, MD",182,58,60,1.0,8/16/2015,"Same old Cheesecake Factory. But I give this one a low rating because I ordered an Irish coffee. I got a cocktail glass with coffee and whipped cream (they forgot to put alcohol in it but didn't forget to charge me for it.) and I order the lemon MERINGUE cheesecake. The meringue was melted, the outside was hot and the inside was frozen. I won't be back."
Les M.,"Washington, DC",0,11,16,1.0,9/3/2016,"Food is consistent but service is routinely bad. It's not busy in here at all, which is strange for a Saturday. My party of two easily found a seat at the bar. No bread was offered. No napkins put down for our meal. Extremely slow on drink refills. Food was not hot---likely a result of sitting. And my special request for a drink was met with a shrug and I was never asked if it was ok. Bar was out of big straws, which made drink extremely hard to enjoy because of thickness. I come here allllll the time because I love a few things. Just over all disappointed tonight, especially after I convinced my friend to come here over several other places in the area. next time I want my drink, I'm driving to Annapolis!"

My party of two easily found a seat at the bar. No bread was offered. No napkins put down for our meal. Extremely slow on drink refills. Food was not hot---likely a result of sitting. And my special request for a drink was met with a shrug and I was never asked if it was ok. Bar was out of big straws, which made drink extremely hard to enjoy because of thickness. I come here allllll the time because I love a few things. Just over all disappointed tonight, especially after I convinced my friend to come here over several other places in the area. next time I want my drink, I'm driving to Annapolis!"
