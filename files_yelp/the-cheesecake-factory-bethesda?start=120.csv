Sana H.,"Germantown, MD",105,39,17,2.0,5/4/2016,"As much as I love the food , today I had a some what rude/awkward experience.  I ordered a beet salad to go- When I asked for an extra salad dressing the lady gave me an excuse maybe she was being lazy- she said it was a large dressing- I ALWAYS get extra dressing with my salads and I offered to pay if that was the issue.  Then she asked me if I wanted bread & I said sure.  When she handed the bag to me there was no bread ... I asked the lady who placed my order for the bread and she rolled her eyes at me.  15 minute wait time was quoted but I waited longer for my food... which wasn't too bad  I drive all the way back to work & open my salad and find 3-4 pieces of bacon in it.  I didn't order any meat and there shouldn't have been any mix up or traces of other food mixed into my salad.  Also, the salad was not so big- it was packed into a large dinner size container with a large bag....wasn't necessary.  1 star for the host who greated me & 1 star for the 3 extra things of butter she threw into my over sized bag, along with the salad being 80% lettuce -------this is why I need extra dressing !"
Erin W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",89,204,27,3.0,8/3/2015,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before. Quick, starch and salt filled food, expensive drinks, and slices of cheesecake which contain more calories than an average adult needs in a week. There is nothing about this location that is any different than any other location except for that it's at Montgomery Mall rather than Anymall USA.  Decent place for a girls night out if you feel like treating yourself to martinis and cheesecake. Okay place if you're in high school and want to go on a ""fancy"" date. Expect a lot of noise, people with massive amounts of shopping bags and to leave feeling full, bloated, and probably a little worse about yourself after consuming a 5000 calorie meal.  Service is usually on point, and despite the lines you can usually get a table in 20 minutes or so."
Bob M.,"Kensington, MD",0,7,,4.0,7/4/2016,As always.....very good salads....huge.....  prices is about right... But...1 star deduction (should be more...but I always have good to great service).   Waiter was stoned.   Saw him chowing down on candy ....order took forever....gave wrong change (in my favor...I had them correct it)..   Did a survey to get a $5 off next visit and was quite harsh....  No response from ....kinda expected some follow up...Oh well
Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",259,730,78,4.0,7/21/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory was recently implanted at Montgomery Mall near Old Navy after moving from its old home, White Flint Mall (RIP). I wasn't completely thrilled to come here after having a mediocre experience at a CF in Jersey, but was willing to give this a try.  To my surprise, this place was PACKED for a Monday night and there was a 15 minute wait for 3 people. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and I really appreciated that the seats were far enough apart to not feel cramped. The ambience is really nice and what I like to call ""classy casual"".  It took longer than usual for the waiter to get around with bread and water, but he was super friendly which made up for it. He got our drink orders in quickly and we didn't have to wait long before our orders arrived at the table. I ordered something off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu because I was shocked that most of the entrees on the regular menu were close to 2000 calories - usually my entire daily intake. My girlfriend was ambitious and opted for the carbonara pasta (2500 cals!!) while our other guy friend got the chicken with biscuits. His looked really good and HUGE... the plate was loaded with a heaping serving of mashed potatoes, a large homestyle biscuit, and chicken with some veggies scattered about.  My entree was the chicken pasta - gremelli (skinny spirals - I had to Google this at the table) with marinara sauce, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The portion size was perfect and I felt very comfortably full at the end of my meal, with room to spare for dessert. The chicken was seasoned well though slightly dry for my taste. The pasta itself could've been cooked a little more, but I prefer more tender pasta to ""al dente"" so I probably should have specified. All in all, it tasted healthy and was exactly what I wanted - plus it was only 500 calories!  We also ordered the Oreo cheesecake to split... though I ended up having to take 2 bites and pack the rest because my friends were stuffed. It is very rich and chocolatey but extremely delicious... honestly all of the cheesecakes I've had here have been divine, so it's good to know the chain is living up to its namesake.  I don't recommend the sangria, however, because it was extremely watered down and tasted too citrusy. The beer and wine are better values.  Our waiter was very attentive and prompt throughout the entire night, checking on us periodically and making sure we were happy with our meal. He was also really patient when we needed a long time to decide on our dessert. This location is a great addition to Montgomery Mall and I would be more than happy to come back!"
Jessica P.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,7,,1.0,2/17/2017,"Hours online say this place closes at 11pm during the week. Staff closed up at 8pm! We drove an hour and a half to get here, only to be turned away for dinner!"
J L.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,3,,5.0,2/27/2017,Way to go Cheesecake factory.  You perfected our dining experience tonight.  You told us our wait time was 30 minutes and it was.  Food was delicious and served promptly and our waitress was amazing and did an excellent job.
Katie S.,"Baltimore, MD",65,19,30,2.0,5/8/2016,"The pork chop was dry and tasteless. The staff was not accommodating at all. The shrimp pasta was too buttery for anyone's appetite. Why is there so many people working for valet when it's at a mall with free parking? The steak diane had too much pepper as well. I couldn't taste much else. I usually get the combo of the steak diane with the salmon at a different cheesecake factory, but this restaurant's steak wasn't so great"
Rose P.,"Beaver Creek, CO",0,2,,4.0,2/17/2017,"Great food for family and kids, service was a little slow but overall was a good time"
Brandi P.,"Baltimore, MD",567,601,115,4.0,3/31/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory for 2 things: Their large menu that appeases all appetites, and the CHEESECAKE. I am a huge cheesecake aficionado, and this is the best chain cheesecake I have ever consumed. The cheesecake is so good, that I am planning on to use CF for my wedding cake. Not a chain person, but I do enjoy CF."
Kim A.,"Silver Spring, MD",146,393,26,3.0,10/19/2014,3 star because they brought out just the portion of my.meal But I still ate it because I'm not picky ... It was delicious .. Would of rated this restaurant 5 star if they brought my meal out right love how they bring bread though before the meal I was hungry .... CheesecKe eh nothing special about it  Waiting line is ridiculous ...
Lironbitton B.,"Rockville, MD",0,13,,4.0,1/8/2017,"My family and I went here for my birthday. Service was good and fast. Our waiter was nice. The only problems were that they were out of my favorite appetizer. I had the salmon, and it was really good. I had to wait a while and it was a little pricy but I New that coming to this place. I was very satisfied, with the exception of them not having the ingredients for the appetizer."
Elizabeth H.,"Rockville, MD",16,19,,2.0,2/8/2016,Huge tables and booths in the dining area available -- not crowded at all.  In fact almost no one was there when we went but we got sat in the bar.  Party of 8 people but we were asked to wait while our table was being set .... for six.   Not the biggest deal but...first round of glasses so dirty you could feel them.  My iced tea glass was flocked with the last drink in that glass. Service was okay.  The kids were fine with their food.  Had a veggie burger that was gummy.
Liza A.,"Rockville, MD",18,193,155,1.0,4/16/2015,"Aaaahhhhh, I always leave unhappy and come back to give it a try and leave again..unhappy. What happened this time...? Well it wasn't that packed, but our server dissapeared....we ordered our kids food thank God and it came fast...they finish their food and we hadn't even ordered ours yet...we had to give our order to the food runner girl cus she said our server was too busy to come back for our order. Wow...the food came fast after but it was just a problems to get drinks after that or to even get water ... Service service...food here is not like wowwww I know what I come for...and gladly is very consistent but service has always been and downfall."
Alan M.,"North Potomac, MD",0,7,3,5.0,7/3/2016,"Just had our managers meeting here at Cheesecake Factory, great drinks and food but the Salted caramel cheesecake........Amazing! Our server (I think her name was Raven) did a great job"
Starr C.,"McLean, VA",128,294,427,5.0,6/3/2012,"I was here a few months ago catching up with some old friends. (Basically, ever since the beginning of my relationship, I was told that the entire ""crew"" would eat at Cheesecake one day. This was that day.) We had a phenomenal server who was just super awesome. I regret forgetting his name and not writing it down, but he was fantastic. A lot of fun but very professional. He made sure we had a great time. The boy and I are huge eaters, so we ordered the roadslide sliders to start. We wolfed them down like animals because we were hungry, but they weren't quite slider-sized. They were actually almost exactly the size of a McDonald's plain hamburger, but a bit tastier. Nothing particularly outstanding, but they did the job they were supposed to do, which was help stave off hunger while making the other couples who didn't order appetizers hungrier. =P I ordered one of the specials that day, the barbecued salmon. It was VERY good, and I'm glad it was one of the specials because I was going to otherwise order the regular grilled salmon. The sweetness of the barbecue sauce was delicious on the salmon. Accompanied by a giant mountain of yummy-in-my-tummy mashed potatoes (seriously, that thing was the size of a softball), crispy thin onion rings (more like onion strings but ring-shaped), on a bed of corn succotash, I believe? Very tasty. And of course, our table totally demolished the bread offered with as much decorum as we could muster. The boy had the chipotle pasta which he didn't seem to love. It was also an overwhelming portion. Some friends ordered the hibachi steak and they seemed to LOVE it. Most of us were way too stuffed for dessert, but the people who ordered cheesecake got it quite fast. I definitely had a fantastic time here. I like that the portions are quite filling, considering the higher price tags on the items here.  Good good good good good food. So good. (Photos coming soon, I'm having a hard time with uploading.)"
Lea K.,"Clarksburg, MD",12,7,4,2.0,3/11/2015,"I'm writing this review a month late because I wanted to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  I loved the Cheesecake Factory when it was located in White Flint.  I used to be one of those crazy people that would wait 2-3 hours for a table.  I used to also order to go when I couldn't wait in those lines.   Now for my recent experience.  On New Year's Eve, I ordered to go.  I drove 30 minutes to Montgomery Mall to pick up my food.  When I got there, the individual that brought my food out told me that my cheesecake was not quite ready since they had to put strawberries on it.  I waited an additional 10 minutes and even tipped the server  extra for bringing my food out to my car.  Because it took so long for my cheesecake to come out, I did not check it.  When I got home, I opened the box only to find a frozen cheesecake without any of the toppings they were supposedly putting on it while I wait an extra 10 minutes.  I called the restaurant and the manager was kind enough to give us a cheesecake for my husband to pick up on his way home without making us bring back the other.   Fast forward to February 14th, my husband picked up food for Valentine's Day so we can have a nice dinner in with our kids.  Again, Cheesecake made a mistake with our order.  They charged us for a dessert item but did not include it in the bag.  I called the manager and she took down my address and name and told me she would be sending us a gift card in place of the dessert.  I thanked her and waited for the gift card. It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers."
Charlie R.,"Potomac, MD",23,51,,1.0,11/20/2016,It amazes me how poorly run this restaurant is compared to their old White Flint location. Horrible line staff checking orders! Ordered enchilada with sour cream and got mayo. Globs of mayo. Complained and they just scraped some of it off and put mayo on top. Yesterday I ordered Chicken Madeira and came with none of the sides. They apologized and said they be right out. 30 min and 3 requests later an idiot shows up when the meal was done. Wife asked 3 times for salad dressing and finally got it in 20 min.. pitiful!!!!!!!!
DJ H.,"Silver Spring, MD",204,57,171,4.0,12/29/2014,"Stepped in here the other night for dinner. Had the dynamite shrimp which was delicious. Tempura shrimp was light, crispy and flaky. Dipping sauce was a nice compliment. Not too spicy but with a little kick.  I ordered the southwest burger. Damn, that was a good burger.  Medium well, juicy, with bacon, aged cheddar, crispy onion straws and bbq sauce. **Money** Found some room for dessert and ordered the lemon meringue pie cheescake. Nuff said. This would have,been a 5 star rating but my server/waitress was very lack luster and we'll just not good.  Overall, food wise, great dinner. Will be back."
Connie M.,"Rockville, MD",290,203,507,4.0,12/12/2013,"What can i say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Giant portions and the most delicious cheesecake!!! Now that they print their calorie count (which has to hurt since the portions are ginormous), I am guessing that is why they came up with their ""Skinnylicious menu"". Yay!! We started off with their skinny summer rolls ($7). I'm not sure if you could make summer rolls any skinnier, but they did. Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce as well as a chili, soy one. YUM!! It was a busy Saturday night with a 40 minute wait so we scoped out the bar and managed to find a table in 10 mins. Natascha was our server and I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she was not on point. She smiled when I smiled at her and she refilled my drink without asking but my two sisters felt neglected as she did not refill their EMPTY glasses. Granted, they were packed like usual but as I used to be a server, the bar is set pretty high (sorry guys!!) I had the Factory burrito grande ($14). I had seen facebook pictures of it and wanted to try what looked like the biggest burrito in the world!! It was packed with chicken, rice, peppers, onions, cheese and cilantro and smothered with sauce and more cheese. There was a side of black beans, guacamole and sour cream....and it was very delicious!!! But it was not as big as it was in the past...but I am glad I tried it...next time will stick with my favorites though. (I packed 1/2 of it to go so I could save room for cheesecake!!) My sister got the shepherd's pie. This NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious brown Sauce  Covered with a Mashed Potato-Parmesan Cheese Crust ($15). I swear this is the best shepherd's pie I have ever eaten!!!  Even though the portion is just a tad smaller (yep, I can tell!!), it is still worth every penny. Luckily she couldn't eat it all and the baby sister and I got to help her.....nom nom nom Baby sister ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad ($18). Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared Rare with Avocado, Wasabi Pesto, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Shallot Vinaigrette. She didn't speak much while inhaling one of the smallest salads on the menu (have you seen the others? piled high to the sky in giant bowls!!!). No one asked for a bite as we weren't sure it would fill her up (it didn't) but when she came up for air, she mumbled something about how delicious and perfectly cooked the tuna was and that the dressing was perfect.  In case you didn't know it, Cheesecake factory can actually split any dessert in half so you each get your own plate (and extra whipped cream!!!). We asked them to split the Peppermint Bark slice ($8) with half packed to take home and enjoy later. This has to be the best flavor ever invented...it reminds me of my childhood when I would eat peppermint ice cream....yum!! I almost dropped a star because Natascha brought me the check before they brought us our cheesecake, but she did bring us bread...after we asked for it and she did refill their drinks...after we asked for it. She wasn't rude. It just seemed like she was preoccupied....hope her week improves!!"
Gen C.,"Cleveland, OH",1,33,9,2.0,12/17/2015,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a place like the Cheesecake Factory (places like this you kind of know what to expect) but our experience was so poor that I feel like I need to warn people about this specific location, because from the looks of other reviews this is kind of the norm. A friend and I came for dinner on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm - wanting to catch up somewhere that reminded us of high school, so where else than the Cheesecake Factory, where we like every other American teenager used to go when we wanted a ""classy"" dining experience. I'm not trying to harp on the CF; it's a good place to go for some American chain restaurant dining, even if you're going there ""ironically"" like my friend and I were. Anyway, our experience: Walked in the and the hostess said hi and just stared at us, I'm not kidding. After a few awkward seconds, I asked for a table for two and she led us. Weird, but whatever. Our server, whose name we never got, didn't even bring us drinks (when we just wanted water) until after he had brought us our bread basket. The sweet brown bread was delicious, but the white bread was rather stale. He then took our orders, and our food was brought out within reasonable time by a different server who set it down and left. My friend ordered macaroni and cheese and was brought the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer. I ordered the Skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp and asked for a side of vegetables instead of the pasta, but was instead brought a bowl of lettuce. As a former server I completely understand mix ups happen, but it was frustrating because if our server himself had brought us the food (instead of shmoozing with the table of girls next to us, which he was doing all night), he could have attended to it right away. When he saw us with our food he came over and right away pointed to my bowl of lettuce and said ""That's not a side of vegetables"" and picked it up to take it back. My friend is very shy and I knew wasn't going to say anything so I went ahead for her and let him know that she wanted mac and cheese, not the fried MC app. His response was ""Well, that's not what you were pointing to on the menu"", which kind of took me back - not how a server should respond. We both just kind of looked at him and he said ""Well, I can put in mac and cheese, but that's going to take a while"", and my friend said the app was fine, but I was pretty put off by that. He brought me back a side of vegetables: a plate of steamed snow peas, carrots, and something else drenched in this asian sauce. Not very good.  The MC balls were good but we were very unhappy with how he handled the whole thing. Also, if you go to CF, don't order off the Skinnylicious menu. I paid 17 dollars for six tiny pieces of shrimp and asparagus. It's not worth it - make CF your cheat meal, don't try to be healthy there. Lesson learned. Dessert was delicious, obviously: my friend and I shared the Cookie Dough Cheesecake and the Godiva Brownie Ice Cream Sundae. Our server brought out both with no utensils (after taking our dirty ones away), so we had to wait.  I would not go to this CF again. It seems like a lot of other people have had poor service here."

Most of us were way too stuffed for dessert, but the people who ordered cheesecake got it quite fast. I definitely had a fantastic time here. I like that the portions are quite filling, considering the higher price tags on the items here.  Good good good good good food. So good.

Lea K.,"Clarksburg, United States",12,7,4,2.0,11/3/2015,"I'm writing this review a month late because I wanted to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  I loved the Cheesecake Factory when it was located in White Flint.  I used to be one of those crazy people that would wait 2-3 hours for a table.  I used to also order to go when I couldn't wait in those lines.   Now for my recent experience.  On New Year's Eve, I ordered to go.  I drove 30 minutes to Montgomery Mall to pick up my food.  When I got there, the individual that brought my food out told me that my cheesecake was not quite ready since they had to put strawberries on it.  I waited an additional 10 minutes and even tipped the server  extra for bringing my food out to my car.  Because it took so long for my cheesecake to come out, I did not check it.  When I got home, I opened the box only to find a frozen cheesecake without any of the toppings they were supposedly putting on it while I wait an extra 10 minutes.  I called the restaurant and the manager was kind enough to give us a cheesecake for my husband to pick up on his way home without making us bring back the other.   Fast forward to February 14th, my husband picked up food for Valentine's Day so we can have a nice dinner in with our kids.  Again, Cheesecake made a mistake with our order.  They charged us for a dessert item but did not include it in the bag.  I called the manager and she took down my address and name and told me she would be sending us a gift card in place of the dessert.  I thanked her and waited for the gift card. It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers."
Charlie R.,"Potomac, United States",23,51,,1.0,20/11/2016,It amazes me how poorly run this restaurant is compared to their old White Flint location. Horrible line staff checking orders! Ordered enchilada with sour cream and got mayo. Globs of mayo. Complained and they just scraped some of it off and put mayo on top. Yesterday I ordered Chicken Madeira and came with none of the sides. They apologized and said they be right out. 30 min and 3 requests later an idiot shows up when the meal was done. Wife asked 3 times for salad dressing and finally got it in 20 min.. pitiful!!!!!!!!
DJ H.,"Silver Spring, United States",204,57,171,4.0,29/12/2014,"Stepped in here the other night for dinner. Had the dynamite shrimp which was delicious. Tempura shrimp was light, crispy and flaky. Dipping sauce was a nice compliment. Not too spicy but with a little kick.  I ordered the southwest burger. Damn, that was a good burger.  Medium well, juicy, with bacon, aged cheddar, crispy onion straws and bbq sauce. **Money** Found some room for dessert and ordered the lemon meringue pie cheescake. Nuff said. This would have,been a 5 star rating but my server/waitress was very lack luster and we'll just not good.  Overall, food wise, great dinner. Will be back."
Connie M.,"Rockville, United States",290,203,507,4.0,12/12/2013,"What can i say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Giant portions and the most delicious cheesecake!!! Now that they print their calorie count (which has to hurt since the portions are ginormous), I am guessing that is why they came up with their ""Skinnylicious menu"". Yay!! We started off with their skinny summer rolls ($7). I'm not sure if you could make summer rolls any skinnier, but they did. Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce as well as a chili, soy one. YUM!! It was a busy Saturday night with a 40 minute wait so we scoped out the bar and managed to find a table in 10 mins. Natascha was our server and I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she was not on point. She smiled when I smiled at her and she refilled my drink without asking but my two sisters felt neglected as she did not refill their EMPTY glasses. Granted, they were packed like usual but as I used to be a server, the bar is set pretty high (sorry guys!!) I had the Factory burrito grande ($14). I had seen facebook pictures of it and wanted to try what looked like the biggest burrito in the world!! It was packed with chicken, rice, peppers, onions, cheese and cilantro and smothered with sauce and more cheese. There was a side of black beans, guacamole and sour cream....and it was very delicious!!! But it was not as big as it was in the past...but I am glad I tried it...next time will stick with my favorites though. (I packed 1/2 of it to go so I could save room for cheesecake!!) My sister got the shepherd's pie. This NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious brown Sauce  Covered with a Mashed Potato-Parmesan Cheese Crust ($15). I swear this is the best shepherd's pie I have ever eaten!!!  Even though the portion is just a tad smaller (yep, I can tell!!), it is still worth every penny. Luckily she couldn't eat it all and the baby sister and I got to help her.....nom nom nom Baby sister ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad ($18). Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared Rare with Avocado, Wasabi Pesto, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Shallot Vinaigrette. She didn't speak much while inhaling one of the smallest salads on the menu (have you seen the others? piled high to the sky in giant bowls!!!). No one asked for a bite as we weren't sure it would fill her up (it didn't) but when she came up for air, she mumbled something about how delicious and perfectly cooked the tuna was and that the dressing was perfect.  In case you didn't know it, Cheesecake factory can actually split any dessert in half so you each get your own plate (and extra whipped cream!!!). We asked them to split the Peppermint Bark slice ($8) with half packed to take home and enjoy later. This has to be the best flavor ever invented...it reminds me of my childhood when I would eat peppermint ice cream....yum!! I almost dropped a star because Natascha brought me the check before they brought us our cheesecake, but she did bring us bread...after we asked for it and she did refill their drinks...after we asked for it. She wasn't rude. It just seemed like she was preoccupied....hope her week improves!!"
Gen C.,"Cleveland, United States",1,33,9,2.0,17/12/2015,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a place like the Cheesecake Factory (places like this you kind of know what to expect) but our experience was so poor that I feel like I need to warn people about this specific location, because from the looks of other reviews this is kind of the norm. A friend and I came for dinner on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm - wanting to catch up somewhere that reminded us of high school, so where else than the Cheesecake Factory, where we like every other American teenager used to go when we wanted a ""classy"" dining experience. I'm not trying to harp on the CF; it's a good place to go for some American chain restaurant dining, even if you're going there ""ironically"" like my friend and I were. Anyway, our experience: Walked in the and the hostess said hi and just stared at us, I'm not kidding. After a few awkward seconds, I asked for a table for two and she led us. Weird, but whatever. Our server, whose name we never got, didn't even bring us drinks (when we just wanted water) until after he had brought us our bread basket. The sweet brown bread was delicious, but the white bread was rather stale. He then took our orders, and our food was brought out within reasonable time by a different server who set it down and left. My friend ordered macaroni and cheese and was brought the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer. I ordered the Skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp and asked for a side of vegetables instead of the pasta, but was instead brought a bowl of lettuce. As a former server I completely understand mix ups happen, but it was frustrating because if our server himself had brought us the food (instead of shmoozing with the table of girls next to us, which he was doing all night), he could have attended to it right away. When he saw us with our food he came over and right away pointed to my bowl of lettuce and said ""That's not a side of vegetables"" and picked it up to take it back. My friend is very shy and I knew wasn't going to say anything so I went ahead for her and let him know that she wanted mac and cheese, not the fried MC app. His response was ""Well, that's not what you were pointing to on the menu"", which kind of took me back - not how a server should respond. We both just kind of looked at him and he said ""Well, I can put in mac and cheese, but that's going to take a while"", and my friend said the app was fine, but I was pretty put off by that. He brought me back a side of vegetables: a plate of steamed snow peas, carrots, and something else drenched in this asian sauce. Not very good.  The MC balls were good but we were very unhappy with how he handled the whole thing. Also, if you go to CF, don't order off the Skinnylicious menu. I paid 17 dollars for six tiny pieces of shrimp and asparagus. It's not worth it - make CF your cheat meal, don't try to be healthy there. Lesson learned. Dessert was delicious, obviously: my friend and I shared the Cookie Dough Cheesecake and the Godiva Brownie Ice Cream Sundae. Our server brought out both with no utensils (after taking our dirty ones away), so we had to wait.  I would not go to this CF again. It seems like a lot of other people have had poor service here."
