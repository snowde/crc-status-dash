LN G.,"Potomac, MD",3,39,5,2.0,2/22/2015,"The food is what you would expect at any Cheesecake Factory- consistently the same, eatable, but nothing amazing. My experience with the service at this restaurant has been frustrating.  We ordered a cheesecake to go using their curbside pickup service.  I gave them my cellphone number when I placed the order and I called them as soon as I parked in the curbside spot.  I was told that they would be out with my cheesecake shortly, but 20 minutes later we were still waiting in the car.  I called them and was told that someone was on their way...and another 20 minutes went by with no one showing up.  Finally, I went inside to get my cheesecake and was told that someone went out to look for us but they did not see our car so they gave us....what?!?!?  There are only a handful of curbside pickup spots and we were clearly parked in one of them.  And you know what, if you do not see us, the you CALL US.  Don't just give up and leave us hanging. The manager (who just happened to be ringing up my order- I did not ask to speak with her) did not apologize or offer us any compensation for our troubles....not that we needed compensation but at least an apology would have been nice."
Top S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,14,,2.0,8/27/2016,Visited this location yesterday with a large party of 15. We had a 1 pm reservation but weren't seated until 2. The hostess could not have been less helpful. I honestly think we would have waited longer had we not continued to inquire. She initially tried to seat us in the bar. When we finally did get seated another employee was literally sitting at the table setting it. We started out with two servers for drink orders but that quickly decreased to one. Disappointing for such a large group. Thankfully the young lady we were left with was pleasant and competent. Unfortunately the group was too large for one server. All of the orders came out at different times and the one vegetarian meal never did get put in. So that person was still eating lunch when everyone else was enjoying desert. This was pretty bad for a Friday afternoon. My advice? Avoid this location it's not worth the traffic or parking hassle. I'm only giving two stars since the food was great.
William F.,"Bethany Beach, DE",0,169,,3.0,11/2/2016,"Went here while waiting for our car to be serviced.  It was a few minutes before 4 o'clock (Happy Hour) and the waitress who seated us felt the need to tell us several times that it was not 4 o'clock yet. We told her we would wait five minutes before ordering, which we did.  After that, she was friendlier; and my wife and I were both quite happy with the food and drinks, as well as with the Happy Hour prices. The decor in this new location at Montgomery Mall is also very nice. This is not, however, the place to come to lose weight. The calorie counts on the menu are scary."
Fernando B.,"Aspen Hill, MD",0,18,12,5.0,4/21/2016,I am a regular  customer at this location. My kids love this place.  Today we met the nicest  server  ever. His name was Alexander   he will check on you every 2 minutes even though he had  many tables at the same  time.  He deserves a promotion to become  a Manager or something. I have been at some many nice restaurants around the U.S and  never found   such a nice server  at all.  I do not mind leaving a good tip with such great service. Even though this is not a steakhouse  the  Filet Mignon  i wonderful along with the   mashed potatoes and green beans.  You gotta try the avocado eggrolls or  crabcakes as apettizers. I am a happy customer
Ava A.,"Gaithersburg, MD",107,16,4,5.0,11/23/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. This location in particular has pretty nice and attentive staff. I was pleasantly surprised by the healthier menu choices. Many of them don't taste like ""diet"" foods. It leaves room for the cheesecake! Lol."
Rishi V.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,6,,1.0,8/24/2016,"I ordered the avocado toast and oh my god there was a hair in the avocado! I have black hair and this one was blondish, I'm so happy I caught it otherwise that would have been gross! When the waitress took our plates, she spilled the rice noodles all over the table and us... The manager apologized about the hair but didn't do much to compensate for this horrific experience. Would definitely recommend driving a little further to the one in Friendship Heights, they seem to have it a little bit more together over there!"
Rahul P.,"Greensboro, NC",1,5,,4.0,4/27/2016,We were looking for some good vegetarian options and we were not sure if we could find something good here late at night....however our server pleasantly surprised us by giving us a range of customisation we can do to suit our vegetarian preferences.... The food was OK with the exception of Chipotle style Pasta....it was awesome!!! The service was a little slow but our server made up for it by being very helpful and polite....
Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",814,1667,23046,4.0,7/9/2011,"Yummy Cheesecakes Big Portions  Friendly Service  Their menu is more like a mini book. With so many options, there is something for everyone at the Cheesecake Factory. At the start of your meal they offer a complimentary bread basket. I am a fan of their small plates (ie. Chicken Samosas, Crispy Crab Bites, etc.). The Chicken Samosas were delicious. If you like Indian Samosas, try the ones from here. They may not be as authentic, but still taste great.  We decided to share our entrees so that we could try a bit of everything. All of the dishes were satisfying. The Roasted Vegetables and Goat Cheese Pizza was my favorite. The veggies were fresh and big chunks of goat cheese covered the entire pizza.  If you like Godiva, a must try is their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. It's every chocoholics dream come true."
Peter L.,"Germantown, MD",1,44,3,5.0,8/20/2016,"Always a great experience, food is delicious, staff works hard to take great care of you. Had a small issue and Zach Ross, Restaurant Manager called and resolved it, now thats great service!"
Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,4.0,5/15/2015,"The wife and I visit this CF location roughly every 3 months or so as a special treat, because the food is so amazing. If you visit on a weekday you will always get seated right away, but on weekends, especially Friday and Saturday night, you can wait as long as an hour. But the wait is worth it! We often get the Buffalo Blasts appetizer, a wonton wrapper filled with cheesy buffalo chicken and deep fried - they are the perfect appetizer. I got my vanilla milkshake too, the best milkshake I have ever had. The factory combo my wife got of Chicken Madeira and Shrimp Scampi was a little pricy at $21 for the amount of food she got, but she still enjoys it. The service could also be a little more attentive on this occassion, so that coupled with the factory combo price means I have to knock a star off. But still this place is awesome and I advise everyone reading this review to go there asap!"
Tuyen L.,"Silver Spring, MD",91,41,50,5.0,11/17/2015,"I had great customer service and a friendly waitress.  Everything was quick and efficient. I always come here on special occasions and today happened to be my birthday, so when everything runs smoothly, the evening was thoroughly enjoyable."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  We followed this Cheesecake from its White Flint location. They have more square footage at Montgomery Mall and nice ""indoor outdoor"" seating. The service is strong although sometimes a little slow.  The reason a 3.5-4 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Ana P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",23,502,1794,4.0,4/18/2012,"Pretty good experience at the Cheesecake Factory! BP and I went once for lunch and I remember we ordered the calamari for the appetizer. It was really good, rivaling the best Calamari I've ever had.  Marinara sauce was awesome, as always! I think BP ordered a burger and I have no idea what I had (sorry, totally my fault...).  I do remember I really wanted dessert, but I didn't have any room for one... Huge portions and delicious food! I really like it here."
Stephanie D.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Waste of time and money. We didn't even see our waitress until we'd been there 15 min. Food was nothing I'd want to eat again and it took 40 min to come out. No apology or explanation. Table across from us was seated after we ordered and they got their food before us. My tacos were cold and completely soggy on the bottom from where they had been sitting. Waitress was very insistent that I was wrong and food was not allowed to sit, but had no way to explain why the food was cold and soggy. My dish was taken off the bill. I felt the issue was as resolved as it was going to get, but she sent the manager over anyway. Manager looked at me like I was an idiot when I explained (again) the long wait time for the food and how it arrived cold and soggy. Still no explanation.  Two different people tried to hand me menus and get me to order dessert after I had already said no and had asked for the check. Considering all the other options this mall and area have to offer I don't see any reason to ever go here again."
Anto G.,"Derwood, MD",86,30,,5.0,11/24/2015,"Food was great, service was great and everything is amazing here everytime i come. I get the bbq ranch chicken salad and it is always great. The waiter was really nice and gave us everything we needed in a timely manner and everyone looked like they were working hard. The dulce de lech caramel cheesecake was perfect. Always a great place to come for family events."
Mike B.,"Bethesda, MD",2400,624,3152,3.0,3/31/2013,"Oh, they did it.  They really did it now.  Cheesecake Factory has been forced to put the calorie count on their menu.  I don't think any restaurant has probably been hurt more than this chain that is infamous for oversized portions and calorie laden food.  So, I'm looking at the menu and finding that a lot of my favorite treats are a day's worth of calories.  And, I'm a glutton...but not that much of a glutton.   The shrimp and bacon BLT can range up to 2000 calories!  My lord and Aunt Jemima that is a lot!  So being semi conscious of my health, I decided to order the salad with seared rare tuna;  A favorite of mine at other restaurants.  The salad came out with a measly 4 slivers of seared rare tuna.  For 17.50 cheesecake can do MUCH better than that.  I'm sorry.  There was a pile of greens, the tuna, and for some reason, sliced rounds of beefsteak tomatoes.  If I was supposed to make this into a sandwich... I didn't get the memo.   We did have the sweet corn tamales appetizer which is one of my favorite things- hence the 3 star rating.   I guess , I'm just not that impressed anymore.  Sorry Cheesecake"
Minna S.,"Seattle, WA",74,72,141,5.0,3/15/2014,"Happy hour is 4-6, and everything is such a good deal! All starters are $5. We ordered the tamales and mini sliders and they were delicious and the portion size was great! This place is fairly new in the mall and I'm so glad they finally opened a Cheesecake Factory here! I'll be coming here more often!"
Bill S.,"Rockville, MD",11,115,22,3.0,2/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is predictable and consistent. The food is OK, the portions large and the prices fair. Its a good place to eat at the Mall."
Tara B.,"Columbia, SC",38,245,148,4.0,1/19/2015,I come here often for the infamous strawberry cheesecake. Customer service is always on point. Happy hour is not too bad. Would highly recommend. Less hectic than the Friendship Heights location.
Kyle F.,"Germantown, MD",3,164,28,3.0,10/1/2014,"If you've been to a chain restaurant, you've been to them all.  The party I was with had to return an entree because the person had requested certain items be removed.  If this order had been during peak hours I could understand but when the place first opens up for lunch on a Saturday and there's barely anyone in the restaurant (all of 4 parties); there's no excuse. The waiter was polite and excellent; the people preparing the meals are questionable."
