Priscilla Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",341,559,2558,5.0,7/8/2013,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory! Decent price for huge portions.  Of course with that huge portion, comes the huge amount of calories, which you are quickly reminded of when looking at the menu. :(  This is one of those places where you don't even bother thinking about calories.   The last time I was here, I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was good, just as you would imagine what cajun jambalaya would taste like.  It had a good amount of shrimp and chicken.  I also had some of my friend's fried zucchini. For an appetizer, this really fills you up, but it wasn't bad. A little too much breading though.   Do make sure to get the Flying Gorilla at some point! It's a spiked banana chocolate milkshake! Delicious!  And if you are here, you have to get a slice of cheesecake! They're all good! One negative for CF is their huge menu selection. I'm a foodie and it's difficult to decide what to get! Some of their items do seem repetitive though, like the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, New Orleans Shrimp, Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. All pretty much taste the same to me. On the plus side, they now have a skinnilicious menu with items 500 calories or less. I have yet to try it out."
Marie AK C.,"Orange County, CA",1160,344,1863,2.0,10/6/2014,"Everyone who knows me knows how much I love The Cheesecake Factory. I've celebrated my birthday at least a dozen times at various locations throughout the U.S. Sadly I hate giving only 1-star review, but the service here is awful. Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place wasn't too crowded, plenty of open tables. The host was friendly and seated us right away. The waiter, on the other hand, was operating in slow-motion. He took forever to take our order. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. The appetizer came out before our water! We specifically requested lemons with our water and of course, the waiter forgot the lemons so we had to re-request them. A different person delivered our food (not the waiter) and he was fantastic. Even the bus boy was attentive and extremely diligent. We ordered a kale salad without cheese and the dressing on the side. The waiter heard the dressing on the side part but when I asked if the white grated stuff on top was cheese, he was like, ""I have no idea."" Uh, ok buddy. He sure as heck knew it was cheese! GUILTY. And I wasn't about to  let him take it back to the kitchen. We asked for more bread and I swear it took him half an hour. I was so irritated that I didn't even want to order dessert. I ALWAYS order a slice of cheesecake. Ugh. I asked for the check. It took him another half hour to bring that out. If you want good food and don't care about annoying service (hopefully you don't get the waiter we had), then check this place out."
Tahirah W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",23,157,,1.0,8/23/2015,"This place is consistent with one thing and one thing alone-it's level of inconsistency. How do you not have some of your signature desserts on a weekend? Whatever, what's even worse than that is the service here. SUPER SLOW. Geez!!! How long does it take to get a dessert when there's nothing going on while I stand there and wait? Goodness gracious."
Abegail A.,"Rockville, MD",886,573,2858,4.0,12/6/2010,"Could my worst nightmare come true?!  It's 5:55pm and happy hour ends at 6pm.  Ahhhh!  6:02pm and no one has taken our order yet, despite the fact that there are tons of waiters walking around. 6:03pm, our waitress arrives!  She tells us that if we hurry and order we could order off the HH menu (4-6pm, M-F, bar only)!  Hooray!!! =) We ordered the avocado eggrolls and two long island iced teas (all $5 each).  Cheesecake offers a lot of their appeteasers for $5 during HH (full size!), but since we were in a time crunch, all I saw was avocado eggrolls (avocado, sun-dried tomato, onions and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper).  The eggrolls weren't bad, not sure if I would order them again though.  After eating one (there's about 6 pieces), I was over it.  The long islands were pretty strong, definitely worth the $5.   After munching on our appeteaser and grabbing a drink, we headed to the main dinning area to eat dinner.  I had the Cobb Salad (chicken breast, avocado, blue cheese, bacon, tomato, egg and mixed Greens) with the vinaigrette on the side.  This salad is GIGANTIC and only $12.99.  Man what a deal...you could definitely make two meals out of this one.  Everything tasted great together, and the dressing was pretty tasty.  I also washed my meal down with a strawberry martini ($9.99),.   Not as great as a remembered it to be, but still good overall.  The BF had the chargrilled coulotte steak (prime sirloin topped with butter) with a side of fries and onion rings for $19.99.  The steak was cooked to perfection...it was juicy and melted in your mouth!  Delicious!!! Our waitress was very informative and checked back on how we were doing several times.  She was great! Cheesecake Factory serves good food (and lots of it) and tasty drinks at reasonable prices.  I'd definitely come back here again for HH...you should too!"
Antoinette A.,"Washington, DC",0,21,14,2.0,6/28/2015,"My server was not great at all. Service was slow and we had to ask for bread, and refills which we never received. I have been here previously and the service was good so I'm hoping this was just an anomaly. The food was good though. In my opinion though I think restaurants like these sometimes have more guests than they can handle so service suffers. I'd go back again but at a time when less people are there."
Moe F.,"Arlington, VA",2,43,18,2.0,5/19/2014,"We have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations.  It is a chain and expectations are what they are.  However, this location was a significant disappoint.  A few points: 1. Make sure you get your party there at the same time - they have a strict ""80% of your party needs to be there before getting seated policy"". You can't order appetizers, drinks, sit at the bar...nothing. Make sure your party is there or you will be standing around getting hungry. 2. Slow service\Bad service -  * On a Sunday afternoon service was abysmally slow.  I can't imagine a Friday night. * Several meals were cooked poorly - over cooked and under spiced * Wrong orders - one person got the wrong meal delivered twice and didn't get a chance to eat with us.  3. Handicap access - Call ahead for handicap access.  There are only stairs in the restaurant. There are several other Cheesecake Factories in the surrounding DC metro.  If you want CF one of the other locations would be recommended."
Rosa O.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,23,,1.0,7/19/2015,I've never been extremely fond of Cheesecake Factory but this one is super ratchet and the service is terrible.
beth s.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,14,3,1.0,3/25/2016,"This is a critique of the management staff Cheesecake Factory. I ate at the restaurant at Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, MD last night with a girlfriend. We each ordered a salad and I got a glass of sangria. When the bill came my drink vas very nearly as much as our salads - $11.50! Knowing I would not have ordered the drink if I knew it was going to be that much, I asked to see the menu to check the price. What do you know --- there were no prices next to the drinks! I did not fault the waitress but expressed my shock and asked to speak to the manager. I knew well this was a policy decision. A very youthful and inexperienced Jennifer came over and inquired. I explained my frustration. She just gazed at me. Then I was interrogated about when I realized drink prices were not listed on the menu. Really? So much for listening to the customer's concerns. She informed me that ""many restaurants are doing this now"" as if this was news. That doesn't make it ok in my opinion. I can go elsewhere. Then Manager Jennifer asked if I wanted her to take our check to the register. I said NO!  I explained that I felt not listing drink prices was misleading and rude, like I had been tricked. They could list the calories, but not the prices? More gazing by Jennifer. She finally asked what I wanted her to do. I said she could either remove the drink form my bill (if there are no prices maybe the drinks should be free?) or at least give me a discount of half for my frustration and to make me a happy customer again. She took the bill and disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back she handed me the bill with all of a $2 DISCOUNT! REALLY??? What an insult  and snub and I told her so. I said I would never be back. Do not eat at the Cheesecake Factory unless you're okay with deception. In my Opinion its a place where there is a Culture of rudeness and unprofessionalism."
Phi N.,"Glenmont, MD",104,867,3259,3.0,6/16/2011,"My cousin brought me home a crabcake sandwich and red velvet cake. The crabcake was good, nothing spectacular. The cake was really good. I don't know what it is about cheesecake, I am never super impressed, but the food is good enough to go back. So I came back here a month later. I have not had time to write the review until now. My friend and I split some kind of Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls and a crabcake appetizer. My main course was the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi. The vietnamese rolls are not recommended. Crabcakes were small but at least it wasn't a bunch of filler; good amount of crabmeat. As for the main dish, the salmon wasn't spectacular and the shrimp were super heavy. The mashed potatoes was by far the best thing on the plate. I would come back just to get mashed potatoes, hahah. Service was really good, as expected."
Caroline N.,"Columbia, MD",7,126,181,4.0,10/10/2014,"Surprisingly packed on a Friday at 1:15pm. My party of 2 had a 15 minutes wait for a table (no biggy), as we preferred to wait to eat here versus other restaurants inside the mall. We wanted to actually sit in the little fake ""patio"" seating which is pretty much viewing out to the mall's pathway... but the lighting was better... and we were told that this area was ""not open"" (meh =( hehe...) Typical Cheesecake, same food... so no problem there! I get the same things off the menu every single time I go, and it's always consistent.  The food was quick, and our server Landon was awesome!  The only downside it that the noise level is a little bit higher than other Cheesecake Factory's I've been too? It's probably just really packed, that's why. Didn't find anything wrong with our visit~!"
Chas T.,"Gaithersburg, MD",140,51,28,5.0,10/21/2015,"I love this place, pretty much my favorite restaurant.... There bread is good, along with there bang bang chicken & shrimp!!!!"
Sharon K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",340,63,360,5.0,6/14/2014,"My brother and I walked in and got sat immediately. Our server was friendly, prompt, knowledgeable, and definitely experienced. My brother ordered the chicken chipotle pasta and I got the Cajun jambalaya with brown rice instead of linguini pasta. My brother enjoyed his pasta and my Cajun dish was remarkable! Perfect amount of spice, bursting with flavor and the plate was decorated nicely too. The shrimp and chicken were well seasoned/cooked and juicy. Our server refilled our drinks a number of times and got us our check and to-go boxes quickly. Food was great and it was one of the best services I've experienced in a while. Thanks, Elvis! (Name of our server.)"
Mary L.,"Kensington, MD",0,1,,1.0,5/30/2015,"Ordered the margarita pizza for dinner and it was probably one of the worst things I've eaten in a long time. It looked and tasted like your most generic frozen pizza with a few ""fresh"" mozzarella balls melted on top.  I didn't have high expectations to begin with, I was looking for something a little more than just edible to eat for dinner. I probably would have been better off stopping by Trader Joe's and getting their margarita pizza. I guess with a 15 page menu it's impossible to actually cook fresh food in the kitchen. I wouldn't recommend eating here if my life depended on it."
Irene F.,"Tampa, FL",553,473,2248,4.0,2/28/2010,"Even though I am not a fan in general of chain restaurants, its my mom's favorite place to eat, so I have found several personal favs that I go to and enjoy. I frequently get the Thai Lettuce Wraps as my meal- I don't like to share this dish- hands off! If I'm not feeling healthy, I do the sliders- they remind me of Krystal Burgers in GA. I also love their meatloaf and their shepherd's pie. As for cheesecake- my go to is the lemon raspberry cheesecake or the carrot cheesecake.  If you have a toddler, ask for the kiddie plate, its free and has sliced up bananas and bread on it in bite sized chunks and its free!"
Josh L.,"Boyds, MD",0,18,,1.0,5/16/2015,"We go to cheesecake factory about two times a month, glad to see this location but,  1. Waitress forgot our order 2. Forgot to bring us water, drinks.  They came out after the meal 3. We received the order from next table.  I forgot her name but we didnt even get sorry from her or manager.  Very rude and poor customer service.  I will go to diff location from now on!"
Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC",3,56,,5.0,6/13/2016,"We went last night for an early dinner and were seated right away (got there at 5:45). It was picking up as we were being seated though, so try to get a reservation if you can. Our waiter was beyond amazing (Maverick). He was attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. The food was good, especially the burger. The beet salad appetizer was fresh and tasty as well. The manager stopped by the table, which was nice. Overall, the evening was great."
Secret C.,"Washington, DC",1,69,23,4.0,9/27/2015,"Some of our favorite dishes had been removed from their menu so we took a hiatus. Our visit this time was better than our last encounter. Our server, Ciara, was very pleasant even when she told me the restaurant ran out of the item I ordered. It was around noon and there was no chicken salad in the kitchen. The manager, Liz, was very accommodating and advised us that the kitchen was making a fresh batch of chicken salad, she packaged a to-go box for the trip home. I appreciate the extra service provided when a menu item was not readily available."
Cynthia L.,"Washington, DC",230,727,432,4.0,2/19/2013,"I don't know anyone who stops themselves from gorging on their fresh-hot bread and butter here; thank goodness they wait until after you have ordered. I always have a soft spot for Cheesecake Factory, even though the majority of their menu is double the caloric intake (in one meal!).   Must tries:  Thai Lettuce Wraps (as an appetizer but it is big enough for a meal!), Farfalle Chicken & Pasta; Herb Crusted Salmon, brunch menu...and of course, their cheesecake.  If you are watching you're weight (who's not these days), they have a low-cal cheesecake (albeit 500 cal, but still better than 1200 cal)."
V P.,"Washington, DC",3,48,9,1.0,2/25/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner with my family.  The service was so exceptionally slow--I couldn't understand it.  The restaurant was mostly empty at 6pm. Thank goodness for the bread basket; I would have chewed off my arm otherwise.   The food was regrettably mediocre.  I ordered the California Omelet.  The egg part of the omelet was an odd and stiff texture, almost plastic-like.  I'm no genius in the kitchen, but how do you mess up an omelet??  Sadly, this particular branch of the popular restaurant has very few redeeming qualities.  Definitely not coming back."
Vicki C.,"Clarksburg, MD",119,181,9,1.0,12/23/2013,"Be prepared to wait for the whole night.... I've always seem to favor the Cheesecake Factory but until this past experience, I will not visit this restaurant again especially this new location in Montgomery Mall. Our party of seven arrived at 7:50pm and was told a 40 minute wait. We didn't mind as much since the mall was open and we roamed around. After our 40 minute wait was up, we checked with the hostess twice in between to see how much longer the wait would be. The response wasn't very clear but we thought we would wait it our just a bit longer until we threw in the towel. It wasn't until 9pm we were finally called for our table.  Our seven guests were escorted to a table for six. Our seventh guest asked the host if we could pull a chair from an empty table right next to us instead of standing awkwardly while everyone else was seated. The host replies with ""that's going to an issue because we will need that chair for that table."" UHH what type of response is that? Mind you nobody sat at the empty table next to use the whole night!!  Starved and now parched we were excited to order drinks and appetizers. The waitress we had was friendly but as for service... not so great. Our appetizers came before our drinks, which in my book is a big no no. We were all digging into the bread, chips, and dip but dying of thirst for water. We had to wait until half way through until she brought our drinks.  We put our entree orders in and waited a long while before it came as well. A manager came over and informed us it was just going to be another minute before the food came out. By then it was 9:40pm until our entrees arrived. The gang ordered mostly appetizers as an entree which was a huge portion for an entree alone. I had clearly ordered a chopped salad with no chicken and when my salad came... surprise, there was chicken! I informed the waitress and she quickly took it back and I waited about five minutes while watching my friends dig in until my chicken-less salad came back. The funny comment the waitress said was ""I took the bacon out too and saved the day!"" One of our friends mumbled you would have saved the day if you didn't bring the chicken out in the first place. No apology whatsoever.  The food was average and overpriced. The tex mex eggrolls and sweet corm tamale cakes apparently are a hit with a few friends. The buffalo blast which is Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing, is NOT a winner. It's shredded chicken and then overly battered and fried, which was one hot mess and artery clogger. After two, the guys felt their chest hurting a little from all the grease. My chopped salad could have had more flavor but I wouldn't have paid $11.50 for it.  After our entrees were cleared we ordered coffee and of course cheesecake. Most of us shared with one another but it took more than15 minutes for them to make the cheesecakes from scratch I mean, grab it from the fridge. Splitting the bill was very difficult. Meals were all over the place on different bills. The waitress clearly acknowledged she had put some things on the wrong check. Good thing, our group of friends were understanding and most of us just paid each other back instead of having the waitress fix it... which by the way she didn't even offer.  In conclusion  Cons: -Service is SLOW -Waitress was not tentative -Food is greasy, flavorless, and overpriced Pros: -The cheesecake is still awesome By the time we paid and left it was 11pm... between one hour of waiting and two hours of service or lack of service.. I will NOT return to the Cheesecake Factory."

I probably would have been better off stopping by Trader Joe's and getting their margarita pizza. I guess with a 15 page menu it's impossible to actually cook fresh food in the kitchen. I wouldn't recommend eating here if my life depended on it."
Irene F.,"Tampa, United States",553,473,2248,4.0,28/2/2010,"Even though I am not a fan in general of chain restaurants, its my mom's favorite place to eat, so I have found several personal favs that I go to and enjoy. I frequently get the Thai Lettuce Wraps as my meal- I don't like to share this dish- hands off! If I'm not feeling healthy, I do the sliders- they remind me of Krystal Burgers in GA. I also love their meatloaf and their shepherd's pie. As for cheesecake- my go to is the lemon raspberry cheesecake or the carrot cheesecake.  If you have a toddler, ask for the kiddie plate, its free and has sliced up bananas and bread on it in bite sized chunks and its free!"
Josh L.,"Boyds, United States",0,18,,1.0,16/5/2015,"We go to cheesecake factory about two times a month, glad to see this location but,  1. Waitress forgot our order 2. Forgot to bring us water, drinks.  They came out after the meal 3. We received the order from next table.  I forgot her name but we didnt even get sorry from her or manager.  Very rude and poor customer service.  I will go to diff location from now on!"
Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC, United States",3,56,,5.0,13/6/2016,"We went last night for an early dinner and were seated right away (got there at 5:45). It was picking up as we were being seated though, so try to get a reservation if you can. Our waiter was beyond amazing (Maverick). He was attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. The food was good, especially the burger. The beet salad appetizer was fresh and tasty as well. The manager stopped by the table, which was nice. Overall, the evening was great."
Secret C.,"Washington, DC, United States",1,69,23,4.0,27/9/2015,"Some of our favorite dishes had been removed from their menu so we took a hiatus. Our visit this time was better than our last encounter. Our server, Ciara, was very pleasant even when she told me the restaurant ran out of the item I ordered. It was around noon and there was no chicken salad in the kitchen. The manager, Liz, was very accommodating and advised us that the kitchen was making a fresh batch of chicken salad, she packaged a to-go box for the trip home. I appreciate the extra service provided when a menu item was not readily available."
Cynthia L.,"Washington, DC, United States",230,727,432,4.0,19/2/2013,"I don't know anyone who stops themselves from gorging on their fresh-hot bread and butter here; thank goodness they wait until after you have ordered. I always have a soft spot for Cheesecake Factory, even though the majority of their menu is double the caloric intake (in one meal!).   Must tries:  Thai Lettuce Wraps (as an appetizer but it is big enough for a meal!), Farfalle Chicken & Pasta; Herb Crusted Salmon, brunch menu...and of course, their cheesecake.  If you are watching you're weight (who's not these days), they have a low-cal cheesecake (albeit 500 cal, but still better than 1200 cal)."
V P.,"Washington, DC, United States",3,48,9,1.0,25/2/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner with my family.  The service was so exceptionally slow--I couldn't understand it.  The restaurant was mostly empty at 6pm. Thank goodness for the bread basket; I would have chewed off my arm otherwise.   The food was regrettably mediocre.  I ordered the California Omelet.  The egg part of the omelet was an odd and stiff texture, almost plastic-like.  I'm no genius in the kitchen, but how do you mess up an omelet??  Sadly, this particular branch of the popular restaurant has very few redeeming qualities.  Definitely not coming back."
Vicki C.,"Clarksburg, United States",119,181,9,1.0,23/12/2013,"Be prepared to wait for the whole night.... I've always seem to favor the Cheesecake Factory but until this past experience, I will not visit this restaurant again especially this new location in Montgomery Mall. Our party of seven arrived at 7:50pm and was told a 40 minute wait. We didn't mind as much since the mall was open and we roamed around. After our 40 minute wait was up, we checked with the hostess twice in between to see how much longer the wait would be. The response wasn't very clear but we thought we would wait it our just a bit longer until we threw in the towel. It wasn't until 9pm we were finally called for our table.  Our seven guests were escorted to a table for six. Our seventh guest asked the host if we could pull a chair from an empty table right next to us instead of standing awkwardly while everyone else was seated. The host replies with ""that's going to an issue because we will need that chair for that table."" UHH what type of response is that? Mind you nobody sat at the empty table next to use the whole night!!  Starved and now parched we were excited to order drinks and appetizers. The waitress we had was friendly but as for service... not so great. Our appetizers came before our drinks, which in my book is a big no no. We were all digging into the bread, chips, and dip but dying of thirst for water. We had to wait until half way through until she brought our drinks.  We put our entree orders in and waited a long while before it came as well. A manager came over and informed us it was just going to be another minute before the food came out. By then it was 9:40pm until our entrees arrived. The gang ordered mostly appetizers as an entree which was a huge portion for an entree alone. I had clearly ordered a chopped salad with no chicken and when my salad came... surprise, there was chicken! I informed the waitress and she quickly took it back and I waited about five minutes while watching my friends dig in until my chicken-less salad came back. The funny comment the waitress said was ""I took the bacon out too and saved the day!"" One of our friends mumbled you would have saved the day if you didn't bring the chicken out in the first place. No apology whatsoever.  The food was average and overpriced. The tex mex eggrolls and sweet corm tamale cakes apparently are a hit with a few friends. The buffalo blast which is Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing, is NOT a winner. It's shredded chicken and then overly battered and fried, which was one hot mess and artery clogger. After two, the guys felt their chest hurting a little from all the grease. My chopped salad could have had more flavor but I wouldn't have paid $11.50 for it.  After our entrees were cleared we ordered coffee and of course cheesecake. Most of us shared with one another but it took more than15 minutes for them to make the cheesecakes from scratch I mean, grab it from the fridge. Splitting the bill was very difficult. Meals were all over the place on different bills. The waitress clearly acknowledged she had put some things on the wrong check. Good thing, our group of friends were understanding and most of us just paid each other back instead of having the waitress fix it... which by the way she didn't even offer.  In conclusion  Cons: -Service is SLOW -Waitress was not tentative -Food is greasy, flavorless, and overpriced Pros: -The cheesecake is still awesome By the time we paid and left it was 11pm... between one hour of waiting and two hours of service or lack of service.. I will NOT return to the Cheesecake Factory."
