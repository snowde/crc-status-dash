Georgio S.,"Silver Spring, MD",3,79,2,2.0,4/6/2015,"Food is really good and consistent but the service sucks! I just don't understand why such a nice restaurant doesn't hire or train better servers. The staff seems unorganized and not prepared. I waited 20 min for my server so she can take my order. When I asked the food runner if she could get my server for me she left and returned telling me the server was busy. So I ask, should I come back to eat when the server is less busy? What kind of answer is that? I guess shouldn't come to the restaurant at busy times."
Julia A.,"North Salt Lake, UT",1,8,1,2.0,6/20/2015,I was really excited to go here because the Salt Lake one is really good. My husband and I ordered the same round we dis there and it was gross and dry.
Julie H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",31,144,349,4.0,2/19/2015,"So glad that Cheesecake Factory relocated to Montgomery Mall, its more convenient to go to and always a good place to stop in after some shopping. I find that this restaurant is a lot smaller than the one at White Flint, but there's also an ""outside"" area that allows you to sit out in the mall area. The service here is pretty quick, and the staff are friendly. I've waited some time to write a review even though I went here on opening week and it was awful (but I returned and its back to the same Cheesecake Factory that I know). The first week that I came here, three of us ordered a pasta dish and red velvet cheesecake. Each and every one of your pasta dishes was extremely extremely salty. It was awful. We got it as carry out, so we couldn't really say anything. It was unbearable to eat. The cheesecake was excellent. After a few additional times visiting Cheesecake Factory, and reordering their pasta - its back to normal and not the salty dish that we first got when we went there. My favorite pasta at Cheesecake Factory is their Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I also enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The portion is large enough to make me full and is really sauce and great with their brown bread. Their mac & cheese burger is also yummy, however the burger is overcooked even if its preferred as medium. I enjoy order the claim as an appetizer, it comes with two sauces to dip with. Even if Im not hungry, I still stop by to get a slice of red velvet cheesecake."
Lawrence H.,"Fairfax, VA",0,37,10,3.0,5/4/2015,"It's your typical Cheesecake Factory.  Big portions, okay quality.  Normally I don't mind this place but this particular one had a waiter who, to put it plainly, sucked.  We ordered our food and he brought out the wrong food.  Telling him this seemed to piss him off.  He brought back the right food but must have dumped the salt shaker on it.  It's was the saltiest dish ever, and it's a dish I usually order (garlic noodles with shrimp).  Told him that this tastes very salty and not like it normally does since we normally order this dish.  We get a nice, big sigh from the guy.  No apology, no nothing.  And we were being nice about it.  Maybe he was having a bad day.  I don't know.  But, no need to take it out on the other customers.  Seriously."
Chris P.,"Silver Spring, MD",13,75,1,3.0,1/5/2014,"WTH...NO FLAVOR?!?! OK, for what it's worth the new location is just fine--over at White Flint it was guaranteed I'd have to wait 30 minutes or more for a table. Now, not a problem...and I wonder why people are complaining about parking. Really? Maybe around Christmas time you would. Not now. So....what about the food? That should count more, right? Yes indeed, and I'm disappointed. I had Moroccan Chicken with couscous and onion rings. The chicken had no flavor, the couscous had no flavor and the onion rings...Holy shiiiiite! No flavor. Is this on purpose? Real grilled chicken would have some kind of flavor, which makes me think it's some microwaved crap purchased from Target. (Then again, frozen chicken from Target, Giant, etc., usually HAS some flavor!)...and even I know how to add something to couscous. But the onion rings---THAT is unforgivable. Perhaps their chefs should learn from the ones at the Rockville Ale House, because THEY know how to make 'em. $5 for onion rings = BETTER HAVE THE FLAVOR. *sigh* The cappuccinos and the vanilla bean cheesecake were fantastic. And like I said the new location is a few steps up from the old one at White Flint. So, my feeling is this: Go here for coffee, booze and dessert but go elsewhere for food."
J T.,"Montgomery Village, MD",6,162,1,1.0,1/17/2015,"I'm sorry but this place is completely overrated. First, if you have six or seven hours to kill this is your restaurant. What's up with a HORRIBLE grueling wait for a place that's a step up from Applebee's? Is it because the portions are so large that you could make three meals out of one? Anyway, once your buzzer goes off...you think ""Oh now I can sit down!"" WRONG! That's the first part of your wait. You then get herded off to another area for the second part of your wait. You look around and wonder why this is the case. This is especially true since there seemed to be many empty tables in the place. We ended up getting seated out in the hallway of the mall at 9:30 p.m. All in all I won't be back, it's a complete joke. The food is just not worth it and either is the wait."
Anthony C.,"Bethesda, MD",18,330,51,3.0,4/15/2014,"The wire bound menu of just about anything ever cooked. CorprAte eating at its best.  I want to say that CF is awful, assembly line food served in mammoth proportions for the mall-bound masses to gorge on after shopping at The Gap and Victorias Secret. Because its true. But my salad was good and even though the place was jam-packed with shoppers it was a pleasant enough meal.  CF is one of those places that is hard to avoid--you end up there in a variety of circumstances. And my objection is not based on some foodie-centric view of the world where everything is locally grown and the mixed greens are, basically, weeds. No, when you succumb to the chain-sit down service restaurants you deprive  yourself of the chance to eat something more interesting. So, here we were, eating and drinking and I have no real complaints. It was OK.  If you are going, I'd say, keep it simple, and next time try something new."
Laura P.,"New York, NY",847,391,238,5.0,2/19/2012,"Always amazing. This particular Cheesecake Factory is great. I was there on Valentine's Day and we had a two-hour wait, which is totally normal and acceptable for the romantic night. Our waitress was incredible - we had a  group of six and she memorized all of our intricate orders and made no mistakes. She was extremely friendly and despite the intense crowds, our food was served very timely.  I always recommend two things when I go to the Cheesecake Factory: raspberry lemonade (complete with sugar around the rim) and the fried macaroni and cheese balls. Always incredible choices. Amazing experience at this Cheesecake Factory on Valentine's Day!"
Nishat K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",85,49,125,4.0,10/20/2013,"I need to start off by saying, the night started out horrible at the Cheesecake Factory. The saving grace was the wonderful server and the food.  We came in and put our names down for a table for two and were told there was a 40 minute wait. So the a friend and I were waiting and waiting and almost an hour passed, and I started to notice people that came after us were being called. Uh. My friend walked up to the hostesses and asked what was going on, and the one who took the name down said they had the name down wrong (it's Sean, not Shaw -_-) and that we missed our table and they'd called us again. Alright that's their mistake but whatever, so about five minutes later the hostesses (three of them) started screaming ""SHAW! SHAW! Your table is ready!"" So he sighed and just walked up and the hostess he talked to looked like she had never seen him before. And then he goes ""I was just here like five minutes ago, you had my name wrong"" and they all go ""OHHHH no wonder you didn't come forward for your table!"" Okay, I was pissed to the max. Even after someone corrects you you still get it wrong? Someone needs to fix that, or them. I almost walked out. As we're being seated, I notice there's still a bill on the table from the previous diners. Annoying. The server was so sweet and nice I started feeling better and then we actually enjoyed the night. I ordered the Steak Diane and he got Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic and both were delicious! The Steak Diane has this amazing sauce with mushrooms and it's *definitely* drool worthy!! We finished off dinner with a tiramisu and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which were a perfect night cap. Everything was pretty big in portions too, I ate about half my tiramisu before I gave up because my tummy was just packed haha.  Besides the hostess situation, the night was great and the food was just as good. As long as there's no idiotic hostess next time, I'll probably come back"
Seema G.,"Arlington, VA",87,212,9,2.0,1/24/2015,"This location is a nice addition but man they are slow!  Came at 5 and was told an hour and half wait.  Crazy that the wait is this long at 5pm.  It's now been almost 2 hours and we're still not even close to being seated.   Bottom line, this place is smaller and service seems sloooooow."
Jason C.,"Rockville, MD",6,148,66,4.0,3/17/2014,"Service was fantastic. Was seated immediately. Our waiter was well spoken, smart and knowledgable - very professional. Ordered the fried Mac and cheese to start= YUM!  They also have good bread and butter to start. Food came out quick and was exactly how we ordered it. I got the Kobe burger which was ok. Not the best burger in town and I wasn't over impressed with the fries. My girl got the smokehouse BBQ burger which she said was very good. I would come back but I won't get a burger or fries personally."
Michael G.,"Chevy Chase, MD",0,38,7,2.0,7/21/2016,"I don't know why this place is so popular. The food is overpriced and mediocre. I ordered the fish tacos and asked for grilled fish and not batter fried. What do they end up bringing me, batter fried fish tacos. I looked at everyone else in my party and they distinctly heard me ask for the fish to be grilled. Then when it came to pay the bill, we told the waiter to put two different amounts on two different credit cards. Well, they screwed that up and we had to have them redo the charges. Well, they screwed it up a second time making the exact same mistake. Finally, someone from our party had to get up and go to the cashier so they wouldn't F' it up a third time. I got home and was sick to my stomach and was nauseous all night long. I could have made better food at home for about a third of what they charged and it would have been way better. I get my cheesecake elsewhere because I find their cheesecake subpar. Honestly, what does it take to have a decent restaurant in Bethesda! I won't be back. I can get a better meal at Balducci's for half the price and sit down in their quiet eating area where I don't have to yell to hold a conversation."
Luis M.,"Sykesville, MD",0,1,,3.0,1/3/2015,"3 star .  Excellent FOOD love it .  But services horrible , wait to long for waitress bring drinks and food. She wasn't courteous.."
Nick S.,"Silver Spring, MD",104,7,,5.0,6/16/2015,"I visit this Cheesecake Factory often for lunch, I've very much enjoyed their service and food."
Kamran N.,"North Bethesda, MD",7,5,,1.0,7/5/2014,"First of all let me tell you guys that I was in love with cheesecake Factory for a while and specially their Tex mix rolls and buffalo wings BUT ...... these are the worst experiences for that past 4 weeks and so many visits 1st visit , sorry we ran out of fries (its hard to buy potatoes). 2nd visit couple days later, sorry again unfortunately our fries ran out again, its embarrassing but im sry, can i get you sth else like mash potato !!! so Mash potato is equal to fries!!! 3rd visit, tex mix rolls are not suppose to cut, they come in a tube form so only one person can have them!!! 4th visit, buffalo wings without sauce on top because i asked them specifically to put sauce on them. 5th visit, i just gave up you know, how many times do you have to ask for the sauce on top of wings??!! its not that hard..... and also at this visit i got this number at the bottom of the receipt for 10 complementary gift card .... 6th visit, call ahead to order, someone picks up and puts me on hold for 30 min and leaves me there, i hang up and recall immediately picks up and takes order. i go to pick up, cashier looks at me standing there for 15 min but he is busy giving waiters tips one by one since they are priority, finally i give him the egift card and he says balance is zero, short story manager comes says the same thing then he says you used it..... im like whatever dude i just printed it!!!  Anyway, service was great in the beginning when they reopened but I guess it didn't last long!!!"
Amazing S.,"College Park, MD",0,29,,4.0,4/17/2016,"The one thing I will say is just because it's on the menu doesn't mean you should order it. They execute certain dishes really well and other dishes are blah, like am i even in the same restaurant. But once you know what to order you will be addicted."
Stacey K.,"Bethesda, MD",0,7,1,4.0,8/18/2015,Went here last time with my co-worker and the server we got was amazing!  The bread is what I always kinda anticipate for lol.  The wheat bread is the best.  One thing I would say that you would have to try is the Georgia peach it is fantastic.  This CF has the best alcoholic drinks. The only reason why I put 4 stars is because the most recent I've been here I got seated outside and none of the servers came to assist us and was just rude.
Larry J.,"Burtonsville, MD",64,170,336,5.0,1/16/2014,"Five Stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up for the Cheesecake factory ! I went here for lunch and came away impressed! First...I knew it was my kinda place when I saw the liquor from the bar on the outside window as I approached. My kinda stuff too. Going in the decor has a nice feel to it. Kinda Retro. Like a stylized version of a place from the 20's or 30's with low lighting, wood panels, and cool, jazzy music. Mosaic tiles hung on the walls and created a sleek , contemporary feel to the space. The servers also wear crisp white shirts. It makes for a great look. On this trip, I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich and a cold apple cider. The sandwich was on the small side and the cidar wasn't ""ice cold"" as advertised but I was OK with that for the most part. The bar is too small but small tables behind it give one more space to sit. The bar does have frosted bar taps for the beer. HUGE ! LOVE THAT !!! It was awesome to see. There's plenty to choose from on the menu and overall the place is big enough to come to casually on your own or as part of a group. I will def. be back !"
Eric J.,"North Bethesda, MD",167,774,3996,1.0,11/21/2013,"I have a stomach ache from eating here, and I haven't had anything else today.

Lisbeth R.,"Germantown, MD",14,5,2,2.0,5/31/2015,Food is great but when having large party's is not accommodating maybe they should work on that if they want to keep business
