Massiel G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",130,156,255,4.0,7/19/2013,Came here to celebrate my friend bday!!! Amazingly it wasn't that pack but it was a Thursday. Our waiter was so nice!!! He was a really good waiter.  We had ordered mini crab cakes and crab dip which was soooo good. I got the shrimp scampi it was good it was a mild spicy but ok. And everyone love there plate we could wait for desert. I ordered the 30th anniversary cake and it was good cant complain this is a good place has a lot options on food and drinks.
Abigail L.,"Bethesda, MD",0,5,2,2.0,5/27/2015,I come here all the time. The fryer has been broken for the last three times I've been here. Ridiculous!!!!! Whole list of food you can't order.
Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1153,103,60,4.0,9/4/2014,"Service: This is the only reason I take off a star, and even this is not applicable to all guests. My parents are vegetarians who love Mexican food.  Naturally, the giant ""Burrito Supreme"" called out to them. Only problem was that it had chicken in it. We asked the waitress who was assigned to us the first time we went there whether or not it could be made without chicken. She told us that the chicken inside the burrito could be removed, but the sauce was marinated in a chicken broth. Over the last seven times we have been there as a family, we have received a different answer to the same question every time. Some hosts say that there is no broth used, while others say that we can replace the sauce entirely. For that reason alone, I remove a star. Our most recent waiter, and its a shame that I forgot his name, was absolutely amazing. He was of Asian-american descent and was extremely friendly/ready to help. Food: I personally love every dish I have ordered here. Its nice to see that there is at least one restaurant left that doesn't skimp on quantity. Portions are huge and I highly recommend the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. I also love how there is now a calorie count for each dish. Most of my friends who count calories gawk at the four digit numbers next to many of the dishes. I just sit there like ""I ain't even mad."" All of the cheesecakes are delicious, however I have run into a few instances where they are not available as slices, especially towards the ened of the day.  Environment: It is a dimly lit restaurant with tons of artwork all around...even the ceiling is painted intricately. The restaurant is loud. Bottom line...it always is packed and the great thing is, regardless of how packed it is, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated. This may not apply come holiday season, labor day, etc. but still very impressive in my honest opinion.  I would be more than happy to give the restaurant five stars, if someone could just answer once and for all, can the burrito be ordered without any meat whatsoever? But until then, I will enjoy my favorite chicken, seafood, and other meat dishes."
John H.,"Boyds, MD",55,85,20,3.0,12/8/2012,Food-Pretty darn good stuff...I LOVE the culotte steak...always cooked perfectly. Their fried seafood platter is also great. cheesecake makes the name of the place obviously.  Service- The difference between lunch and dinner service is night and day. God forbid you go there on a holiday because it goes from restaurant to DMV once the crowds hit. They make lots of money for bertucci's and PF Chang across the way.
Jim F.,"Brookeville, MD",2,18,1,4.0,12/2/2012,"Great environment, better Service. The food was very good but I was blown away by our servers. I wish I got their names but both of my servers were attentive and on top of their game."
Samuel R.,"Bethesda, MD",0,5,,2.0,1/4/2016,"The food was enjoyable, as usual.  The service, however, we very substandard, and with all the other wonderful restaurants locally that very much want customers, this experience may be my final patronage of this restaurant for quite a while."
Mike M.,"Arlington, VA",9,9,,2.0,12/23/2013,"Keeping the scale to Cheescake Factories in general, this one missed the mark for me. I'm not a huge fan of giant menus with a specialty in ""everything"", but still we went with some basic dishes. Some salmon, some pasta. The salmon was a bit dry and the pasta a bit mushy. They were both probably sitting in the window too long. The waitress was nice and did a good job. The food wasn't bad enough to complain about to get a refund so we just... digested... the results."
Sasha W.,"Alexandria, VA",2,29,,5.0,6/28/2013,"I'm surprised that many yelpers are detracting a star for super high calorie foods, in my mind, I'm just super glad they are telling me the calories so I can better plan my meals! The food taste great enough at this place that it is worth the calorie splurge once in a while :) Since I live near, this is probably the restaurant that I dine out at the most. Reservations always helps because the wait can usualy be 10-15 minutes. The food never disappoints, huge portion, but if you order from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu you can curb your calorie in take by a lot! The bread basket is wonderful (esp the brown bread), and of course there are so many choices of delicious cheesecake that you can't go wrong. The only this is that because the place is so popular, it can get pretty noisy."
Lakeshia B.,"Silver Spring, MD",365,128,13,4.0,7/4/2012,"I have been going to various Cheesecake Factory restaurants for as long as I can remember, but this one in particular is a staple for myself, family, and friends. I love coming here because my food is usually done right, taste great and my service is nine times out of ten on point. Today my mother and I went to have lunch. We got there just as soon as it was opening and were seated promptly. The staff is friendly and always professional when I have dealt with them. My first order was one of my favorites the strawberry lemonade, but when it was brought to me it tasted terrible. At first I told the waitress and told her not to bother as to not seem rude. But she promptly fixed it and brought me a fresh glass made from a different bottle. I decided to forgo getting more strawberry lemonade and went for the decadent Dulce de Leche milkshake (not for the weight concious) I proceeded to order the Dynamite Shrimp with dipping sauce which I love. My mother ordered another one of our favorites which are the crab bites. I also recommend the buffalo blasts, popcorn shrimp, buffalo wings, dumplings, and my utmost favorite the calamari. We both ordered the shrimp scampi (mine with no tomato extra garlic) and that came out piping hot and with a little kick. This time the kitchen added some hot pepper making it even more tasty. My other favorite meals are the Thai Chicken, Chicken Picatta, Beef ribs (which was removed from the menu), and the Orange chicken. We decided to forgo dessert we were so full by then. I loved the atmosphere it can be a little loud but you can carry on a comfortable conversation if need be. The ambience is always soothing. I love the recessed lighting, comfortable seating, and the luxurious feel with marble trim I recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to enjoy good food, good service, and a comfortable atmosphere"
Puja L.,"Rockville, MD",45,352,73,4.0,3/18/2010,"Although I'd like to denounce chain restaurants, I really have enjoyed every meal I've had at Cheesecake.  It's always been a reliable fallback for a gathering that will please everyone.  Their menu is huge, so you've got a big variety to choose from (but who orders chinese food at cheesecake factory?)  My absolute favorite here: AVOCADO SPRING ROLLS.  Mmmm...but I love avocados (I went through a period where I was going through 3 a week...just eating them with a bit of salt and black pepper).  Anyhoo, I do enjoy these things.  I also really like the barbecue chicken salad, but I've begun to make that at home instead of paying $10+ for barely $2 of ingredients.  Their cheesecakes are obviously yummy...I think my favorite for over a decade has been the tiramisu. I'm not absolutely certain, but I don't think they use real cream for their whipped cream - because I tried to put some in my coffee and it didn't dissolve.  Not a fan of not using real ingredients.  Whipped oil is not good eats.  I really wish the place would take reservations though...there have been many times where we can't wait 3 hours for dinner - so we just hop over to the (always empty) Bertucci's across the hall."
Shannon B.,"Derwood, MD",0,1,,4.0,10/18/2012,"ORDER THE OREO EXTREME CHEESECAKE!!! it's only been on the menu for about 2 months, and I've already had it about 3 times, and that's only because I've been trying to resist. I don't even really eat cheesecake and I hate oreos. I even looked for a similar recipe to make at home. That's how good it is"
Lisa I.,"Bedford, VA",26,106,86,3.0,1/27/2011,"Blah blah blah chain restaurant blah blah blah. This is a great place to go when you are with a group and everyone feels like different things. Sure, everything is more ""inspired by"" rather than actual authentic ethnic cuisine, but that's enough to keep most people happy. Steaks, salads, pasta, pizza, Chinese, Hungarian, Mexican, Thai, hamburgers, sandwiches, etc. etc. etc. Their menu is like, what, 80 pages long? Most people should be able to find something they like here. So even though it may be good for indecisive groups, it's actually kind of hard to go here with a group larger than 4 and be seated in any reasonable time frame. This place is always a zoo. My husband and I went here today at 3:00pm (not lunch, not dinner--lunner), and we still had to wait 10 minutes. They really pack people in here, and the tables are very close together, so it gets very loud. We've had so many things on the menu and have pretty much enjoyed everything. Actually the Shepherd's Pie was something that should be avoided. Portions are huge, so the prices aren't bad if you consider it a left-over lunch too! Cheesecake is always solid. Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake A++++++ Would buy again!!!"
La B.,"Bronx, NY",12,117,,4.0,5/7/2013,"This location is spacious and accessible. It can get very crowded with minimal seating as you wait on certain evenings such as Friday and Saturday. The bathrooms are small with only a few stalls but they are wheelchair accessible.  The menu is vast. Some of the items our party enjoyed included the free bread, the hamburger with mac and cheese on top, tacos, fried chicken salad, and spring rolls. We also enjoyed the margarita on the rocks and Caribbean cooler (a frozen mixed drink) and for dessert the Tiramisu cake and the warm apple crisp which were both delightful. The staff are attentive and greet you when you enter and are pleasant when ordering. There are free refills on soda, the booth and chairs are both spacious and it is a space families usually come to visit."
Eunice K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",168,425,2060,4.0,1/9/2013,"LOVE THE BROWN BREAD (def honey wheat or something) my fav!!! had the mahi mahi (not on the menu) its a lil spicy.. mashed potatoes on the bottom then mahi mahi and then its topped with some tomato thing.. kinda seems like pico de gallo but like salsa-y with capers.. pretty good but i dont think i'd get it again friend got salmon miso ive tried it before and it is always good.. :) my other friend got steak diane and shrimp or something..? i would prob just get the steak cus im not a huge fan of seafood steak was juicy and the mushroom sauce was good!!! we were too full to get dessert but i do love the strawberry shortcake biscuit, ice cream and fresh strawberries! YUM.. also comes with whipped cream and if you're looking for a not so strong cocktail try to the peach bellini! yummmy! it's a frozen drink :)"
Edwin C.,"Orange, CA",290,241,187,4.0,1/11/2013,"I wavered between 3 and 4 stars, b/c honestly.... IT'S A CHAIN!!!  So why'd I make it 4 instead of 3?  My end all of all tie-breakers.... SERVICE!!! This Cheesecake location could easily have been lower b/c the wait can be a bit ridic..... if you see my White Flint Mall review, you'll know why.  Cheesecake is just about all that's happening here.  So because of that, the wait is long. Food is typical Cheesecake fare.  The mango ice drink is quite delish.  Had the Chinese chicken salad, always a winner.  A friend had the meatloaf sandwich which I am DEFINITELY hittin' up next time. But back to the reason for the extra star..... I kept asking for their brown/wheat bread and waitress was RIGHT ON IT!!!  Plus, our party was quite large (like 14 w/ a couple kids) and they got us an AWESOME table.  Kudos!"
Heidi F.,"Gaithersburg, MD",54,57,35,5.0,8/3/2014,"Service was great, food was perfect. Waitress was attentive to us and accommodating. Atmosphere was pleasant but a little loud. But they can't really help that since the place is so popular an busy. Little pricey though."
Aaron G.,"Rockville, MD",1,22,36,4.0,10/13/2014,"Cheesecake is one of the few corporate chains that always has their act together.  -Brown bread is always soft and delicious.  -the small plate samosas are a favorite of mine. The filling is nicely seasoned and the creamy sauce is a nice complement.  -bang bang chicken and shrimp, orange chicken, and the gumbo always compete for my attention for dinner.  -almost impossible to choose from all the cheesecake flavors. Fortunately they sometimes make it easy by saying one of the flavors includes a donation to a charity. So I feel a little better about the calories.  It is a high energy and high volume place so be prepared to wait and for it to be hard to hear."
Theresa N.,"Bethesda, MD",0,14,,1.0,2/14/2015,Their curbside pick up service is a disaster. I called around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon to avoid the dinner rush. I was pleasantly surprised to be told it would be 20 minutes until my food was ready. I showed up 25 minutes later and no one answered the curbside pick up line. I called the main line and told them I had a curbside pick up order and she asked if I would wait on hold. I waited for five minutes before she came back and took my name. She said it would be a few minutes before my food was out which actually turned into 20.  Then the best part - the person who brought my food to my car told me that my dessert was still being boxed and he would be right back with it. TEN minutes later I had my dessert. I only live five minutes away but as I sit down to eat now my dinner is definitely cold. I will not be ordering takeout from them again.
Lenny S.,"Rockville, MD",1,42,,4.0,6/27/2012,"Great food, Great atmosphere and not insanely expensive. While this is a chain restaurant the food is great, service if nice and dessert is amazing. I have not had a bad meal here nor have any of my friends and we have tried most of the menu. I would suggest the burger with the fried macaroni and cheese on top, it is delicious.   The only reason I did not give it is 5 is that nothing blew me away.  It was all very good food, service and atmosphere but nothing spectacular."
Liz C.,"Clarksburg, MD",20,15,8,5.0,8/1/2015,service was great unlike the reviews said. we had a waitress that stopped by every 7 min or so to check on us which was great! food was amazing esp bc it was half off cheesecakes. i got the smores one & alfredo fettucini and both were so good!! i will definitely stop by again. the servings are also huuuge!
