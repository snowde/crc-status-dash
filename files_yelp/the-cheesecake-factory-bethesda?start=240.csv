Patrick W.,"Silver Spring, MD",161,103,47,3.0,2/12/2014,"The food is standard fare for this chain prepared in an acceptable manner. Nothing is going to win a Michelin star here. I will say I rate their curbside service as a negative 50 stars, can I do that? I have tried the curbside 4 times. They are 0 for 4. Better dine in if at all."
Reza S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,2,1,1.0,8/26/2015,"Horrible service. All the foods that we ordered were salty and everybody complained. Also, for a party of 15 they told us the waiting time will be 45 min at the time we arrived but we wait for 2 hours to get a table. Poor management and rude servers. Never go there."
Mark N.,"McLean, VA",10,33,4,5.0,6/19/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for some really damn good food served in portions large enough so you can eat leftovers for 3 days. The Cheesecake Factory here in North Bethesda keeps that reputation strong. I've been to quite a few different locations and am always happy that they seem to be so consistently good no matter which one you go to. I've been to this location several times and have always been completely satisfied. All the dishes are amazing, the servers are some of the best, and come on.. the cheesecake is phenomenal! This is my son's and my favorite place to go. The only negative thing I can ever say about TCF is noise, they all seem to be so loud inside. That doesn't take away from this being a 5 stars experience!"
Rob J.,"Columbia, PA",75,14,7,5.0,3/28/2012,"First ever visit! It was DELICIOUS! I had a ridiculous sloppy sloppy burger...I don't remember what it was called...but it had pulled pork and coleslaw and BBQ sauce and OMG DELICIOUS! I know it was like 1,000 calories because they have the nutritional value of every delicious type of food listed next to the item on the menu...which is horrible...because by the end of the meal you are ready to go into the bathroom and purge. 4,000 calories for dinner? Yeah...it's easy at this place. Basically...the food is an A+...the fact that they jam the calories of each item into your face is a con. Especially if you normally eat well and just wanna be bad one night...and if you do...may I suggest the Red Velvet Cheesecake...coming in at a whopping 1,570 calories...yeah...thats per slice. DELICIOUS!!!!"
Bruce H.,"Potomac, MD",0,7,,5.0,3/11/2015,"Food is good, service is excellent, and prices are reasonable.  I'm not really sure what else you want in a restaurant.  If you visit other restaurants in the area, you can see how well-run TCF is.  They know what they're doing."
Martica C.,"Silver Spring, MD",31,20,47,4.0,11/14/2013,"Love the variety of food here, I've gone several times over the years and have yet to try something and not enjoy it. It must be said, their portions are huge, so count on leaving with leftovers unless you order from their small plates menu which is also fun if you want to try a bit of several things. Today I learned that they serve some wonderful crab cakes-and I usually don't even like crab cakes."
Fran B.,"West Granby, CT",0,13,,4.0,6/27/2015,Enjoyable experience.  Prompt and flawless service.  Tasty food for appetizers and entries and yummy cheesecake to finish it off.
Kenneatta J.,"Clarksburg, MD",8,14,1,2.0,7/12/2013,"The food was ok, wasn't the best. Tried the Hot Cheese and Spinach appetizer, I've had better. The chips taste stale and the Spinach dip wasn't hot enough. I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, the shrimp were over cooked and the chicken were dry. The Tiramisu Cheesecake was the best thing I got from the restaurant, but it wasn't the best cheesecake I ever had. Probably won't comeback."
Cristi A.,"Bethesda, MD",1,2,4,4.0,5/4/2014,"we had a couple of burgers and they were both delicious. Our waiter dissapeared a couple of times and the place is very noisy at this hour (5pm) but apart from that, it was great :)"
Rigo R.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,52,,1.0,4/20/2015,We went there for lunch we had some tacos glass of wine I must said the service was so awesome Alex lamarre was so amazing  best customer service  waiter ever he please if you wanting experience the best service ever ask for him
Tom C.,"Gainesville, VA",110,60,,2.0,8/13/2014,"The meal and the service were fine.  I didn't have any real problems until the check came.  I paid with a gift card and tipped in cash.  I dine with gift cards all the time.  It shouldn't have been a big deal.  I was embarrassed that the waitress flagged down the group as we were leaving to tell us that we forgot the tip.  Very loudly she said  ""The gift card doesn't cover gratuity!""  We know that!  That's why we left cash!  We left over 20% on this occasion and I'm pissed that you called us out like that.  We were completely mortified.  If I didn't have my kids with me, I would've made a scene.  Such a terrible way to end Sunday brunch with my family.  I'm never coming back."
Mike K.,"Rockville, MD",25,119,2,3.0,3/1/2012,"$5 for a bottle of Miller Lite, geez. Good appetizers.   Had flat bread pizza with blue cheese and pears, liked it"
Sujit B.,"Silver Spring, MD",124,139,82,4.0,12/23/2013,"The new location is pretty but parking is a bit difficult. Thw wait time is normal but the ""bar area"" is weird because they have the bar walk in seating next to the reserved/table seating. People come in and just sit but we werent allowed   so.  The food is always delicious. The portions are too big and sometimes too pricey. The spinach dip was too big for 2 people to share and about 11 bucks. The side mac and cheese is so oooey gooey and delicious! Over all really good. So many options to pick from."
Wes M.,"Montgomery Village, MD",14,16,33,5.0,1/18/2014,"Awesome food, great shakes, they always give you to much to eat.  The staff was happy to be there and on top of everything you need.  Great place if you're really hunger the portions a big and price is nice."
Eric B.,"Bethesda, MD",123,399,81,1.0,3/21/2011,"Place stinks. First of all, why not gimme the ""S"" Britannica (for stinks) instead of the menu?  I mean, at least gimme a table near a fire with a reading chair so I can get through this thing.  Really. So do yourself a favor and get a slice of cheesecake to go.  It's 3 star cheesecake at least, and you get a ton of options.  That's great, unless you're like me and the only cheesecake you like is a plain piece of NY style cheesecake the size of your head (go to Sarge's, Junior's is horrible!). 3 and 4 stars? are you people serious? or did you find the one thing on the biblical scale menu that's dece? nuff sed."
Angel S.,"Rockville, MD",49,48,41,4.0,1/10/2012,"Been going here for years. My wife used to work there and its where I first saw her so it has a special place in out hearts...and our stomachs.  The Avocado Egg Rolls...MONEY!  Tempura Tuna Rolls, wow! Meatloaf...surprisingly memorable.  Fried Chicken sliders...the go to order! Look, this place is for a group of friends, lots of sharing and loud atmosphere. It's noting overly special. Just the perfect place when you want large prtions and fast service with LOTS OF OPTIONS!!!"
Colin M.,"Rockville, MD",2,26,2,2.0,8/15/2010,"Cheesecake Factory was the perfect place for me when  1) I needed a nice meal,  2) had enough time to account for the possible long wait, and  3) I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat. More so than other locations in the metro area, this specific one always offered consistently tasty Jambalaya Pasta (over rice is my choice) and Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Last Sunday, I visited the restaurant with two family members for an early dinner - 6:00PM.  We didn't even have to wait to be seated.  Excellent!   However, it was all down hill from there.  Our server left us unattended for the first 10 minutes.  Our appetizer came out in 30 minutes.  Our entrees followed almost 30 minutes after we finished our appetizer.  Our entire meal took us over two hours, and we left the restaurant at 8:15. Now, the more important stuff....FOOD... My Louisiana Chicken Pasta was way too dry, and chicken, overcooked/fried.  My brother-in-law ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, and that was undercooked with vivid redness near the bones.  My sister ordered the Jambalaya Pasta - Over Rice, and the server brought us Jambalaya Pasta - Over Pasta. The last mistake actually happens pretty often.  It has happened to me a handful of times, and while it's super annoying, I didn't deduct any stars for the mistake alone. When I complained to the manager about the long wait after ordering, the manager said that the kitchen was swamped and currently running on 60 minute pace for all entress.  However, the two different groups that were seated after us, ordered after us, all received their entrees much earlier than we did.   Very uncool of the manager to try to resolve my complaint with a classic BS."
Jasti S.,"Bethesda, MD",89,113,5,2.0,3/13/2011,"The waitstaff here is really nice. But the manager is kinda thoughtless and rude. The bar brought me a VERY watered down mojito TWICE. I rejected both. The manager came over in the middle of our meal and told me they were made correctly. I mentioned that in Friendship Heights, they're a lot better.  He argued me down about it and said that he knows he's ""anal"" and that his waitstaff doesn't like him, but he doesn't care because he produces top numbers, etc. Well, I could care less because I won't be back anytime soon. I'll keep going to Friendship Heights, thank you very much."
Chanel T.,"Hyattsville, MD",11,8,,5.0,11/6/2011,"So much more than cheesecake, how can I even begin? For a place that specializes in desserts, The Cheesecake Factory really takes the cake (pun intended?) when it comes to entrees and appetizers. Food is high quality, service is efficient and the portions are HUGE.  Everything tastes fresh and is presented well. The steaks are amazing, perfectly cooked and swimming in toppings and sauce. Be prepared to ask for a doggy bag... the portions are enormous. Only after you see the portion size will you realize that this place is actually cheap, you are literally buying yourself two meals for the price of one.  And of course.... the cheesecake. Absolutely amazing... but ask for it to-go because there is no chance you are finishing it after devouring bread and an appetizer and making a tiny dent in your entree."
Scott M.,"Alexandria, VA",170,44,34,3.0,9/23/2012,"Their food is overrated. Instead of an appetizer, get cheesecake. Instead of an entree, get cheesecake. Instead of dessert, get nothing, because you already ate 2 different kinds of cheesecake."
