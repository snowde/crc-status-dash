Mina A.,"Pasadena, CA",1,181,4,3.0,10/18/2011,"Really friendly service and big portions. A lot of their dishes come in smaller portions during lunch time, which is nice.  Cheesecake Factory is great for big groups and there is something on the menu for everyone. This time of year (Oct - Nov) they have a pumpkin cheesecake that is really delicious."
Adil B.,"Seattle, WA",10,42,5,4.0,9/11/2011,"Huge portions and delicious, huge slices of cheesecake. Whenever I visit The Cheesecake Factory, I end up getting a takeout box because the portions are so large (but great). I personally like the burgers the most.  You have to get a slice of cheesecake, of course - why else would you come here? :)"
Ani P.,"Los Angeles, CA",590,779,2,4.0,6/8/2010,"I visited The Cheesecake Factory recently with my nanny. I was late coming home from work, 3 days in a row, and I ""owed her"" big time. I suggested dinner before I drove her home (I'm cool like that, plus she did miss the bus on my account) and asked the nanny what she'd like to eat for dinner (insisted really). Her response was, ""I'd like vegetables."" My kinda girl. I don't exactly know how we ended up at The Cheesecake Factory, but she was excited, and a happy nanny equals a happy mommy. Family Friendly. They made room for my ri-dunk-ulous double stroller with a smile. The waiter brought the babies a complimentary baby plate -- sliced bananas and few pieces of bread. Awesome.  The menu is huge. So the plus side is that there's something for everyone. The salads can be uber healthy if you go light on the cheese and dressing on the side. The prices are affordable.   The portions are ginormous. I've literally never had a bad server experience.  Everyone seems to on their meds.  We were in and out in less than an hour. I have babies and I'm giving a chain restaurant 4 stars. Yeah, FML."
Martin D.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",1,18,2,5.0,11/13/2013,"They were on today. Been here before and didn't enjoy the experience as much. Went between lunch and dinner on a weekday, no wait, super quick and attentive service. The food was spot on, buffalo blasts and a burger, the wife had shrimp scampi and everything tasted great. Fudge cake dessert was awesome. Overall, a seamless delicious lunch and our waiter was very nice and quick. I must have caught them on a great day, because this was the best lunch I've had dining out in years. Been here before, but today they were on their A game."
Steph F.,"Modesto, CA",21,44,41,3.0,5/1/2013,"I would give it 3.5 stars. Went there last night about 5:03pm as the lunch cut off was 5pm :(  Nice restaurant, as most CF's are. Quiet, and the waiter was friendly and attentive but a bit of kinda a rusher. Came back to our table like 2 minutes after we sat us down and gave us the menu! Then kept checking on us excessively during the meal. It's like okay, I know you want a good tip, but some people like to be left alone a little!  Menu is very pricey during dinner just to forwarn you. Chicken fettucine alfredo I had was $18.......   Great serving size and it was good, but a little too on the garlic-y side for my taste. But it was very saucy and a huge portion so I took home like 3/4 of it, had a litte later in the night.......... AND POW!  in the middle of the night I was puking. I don't know if it was the cranberry and vodka I made myself when I got home, or the overload of pasta....but my tummy wan'ts feelin too good. So... I can't say esactly what made me sick, but my date was okay, he didn't get sick... He got the Jambalaya pasta which was tasty also, the chicken and shrimp in it were on point.   We got the Turtle cheesecake, with chocolate, pecans, and caramel, which was really good, but really rich, and one slice is $8, and plenty for 2 people, maybe 3!  After all that pasta and cheesecake, I was really starting to believe I was turning into a cheesecake myself."
Mary H.,"Derwood, MD",8,5,,4.0,1/24/2015,"My family loves Cheesecake Factory and we eat there about three times a year. Tonight the Pasta Da Vinci and fish and chips met high expectations as usual, but the background music was too loud for conversation, the bread arrived late, the waiter forgot to place my drink order and it didn't arrive until after our dinner came (I had to remind our waiter about it) and the chicken Caesar salad could have used more dressing.  We will try again in hopes that this was just an off night."
Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",280,192,83,4.0,6/1/2011,"I went to Happy Hour early evening on a Friday (about 4pm) and sat in the bar area. We ended up there after getting seated and the waitress told us that the amazing Happy Hour specials were only available in the bar area. Which kind of sucks (-1/2 star). So we relocated.  The bar was pretty packed already and was filling up pretty quickly. This meant a very busy server.  He worked as efficiently as he could because there were so many people to tend to. But there wasnt much time for any personal attention. But I guess its hard to have amazing service at such a popular restaurant.  The Highlights: $5 Long Islands and Mojitos. I am a bartender and that long island was easily one of the best ones I've ever tasted. My bf had their electric pink lemonade or whatever its called and it was excellent. You couldnt taste an ounce of liquor. And we were both quite a bit past tipsy after only 2 drinks there! Half off appetizers. We had the Calamari. No complaints there. STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE FOR DESSERT! Cant leave here without it. The wait staff was even nice enough to hold it in the refrigerator for us while we shopped. The entrees: I had Pecan Crusted Salmon, absolutely delicious, with some type of shrimp scampi. It was a combination platter. And the shrimp I couldve actually done without (I didnt expect it to be fried -1/2 star). I only ate about 1/3 of my food after getting pretty full off drinks, appetizers, and bread. My bf got the Chicken Madeira and he damn near ate it all. I think that the wonderful thought of having leftovers later that night kept him from finishing it. In conclusion, I'd be quite content swimming in a pool of anything that bartender made. And I think this may be my new Happy Hour spot!"
Jen F.,"Washington, DC",428,666,129,3.0,7/28/2010,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory.  I think every Cheesecake Factory has the same frustrations- long wait, crap service but delicious overpriced food.   This location almost always has a wait.  Seriously, come here on a Tuesday night and you will still have a 45 minute wait.  Saturday morning brunch?  Wait.  It will also take you roughly 10 minutes to get bread and water (and you may need to ask for bread).  The food takes another lifetime.  The mall attached has some okay stores to browse while waiting.  The pagers I've gotten work throughout the mall sometimes... I've had to sprint over from Lord and Taylor before.  Not guaranteeing it, but it's happened a few times."
Tricia K.,"Laurel, MD",18,33,,3.0,7/19/2011,"Really great food, don't get me wrong at all.  I have been here multiple times.  They have quite the extensive menu and every single time, I have been more than please with it.  And, of course, the cheesecake.  OH THE CHEESECAKE.  However, since this is quite the popular place, the service is more than deemed to be desired. Yes, the servers are generally very friendly.  However, timeliness of things is a bit . . . well, off.  Each time I've been here, I've had to spent AT LEAST an hour and a half.  During lunch hour, when the place isn't even packed, it shouldn't take this long.  Whenever you ask for something, they do it with a smile on their faces, but it seems their concept of how long you may have been sitting at the table waiting for them to come and take your order, drop off your check, or refill your water glass seems to be a bit askew.   I recommend going here, but only if you have the TIME.  That's the major thing.  And don't get frustrated when it takes longer than you'd expect--I forewarned you. Also, the acoustics in the place is less than desirable.  It seems no matter where you sit, the level of sound travels far and wide, making it extremely difficult sometimes to hear your company.  In other words, don't take a lunch interviewee here like I did.  Big mistake."
Matthew S.,"London, United Kingdom",22,22,5,3.0,12/29/2009,"Not my number 1 choice for lunch and I'm a definitely a critic of their massive, irrresponsible portion sizes. But my grandmother likes it so of course I will go.The Cheesecake Factory attracts lots of families, little kids, and older people. Nothing wrong with doing well with specific demographic groups.   The Cheesecake Factory staff was nice every step of the way. From the hostess not questioning my excuse for why the rest of my group was late (I said they were parking, which in a sense was true because everyone is in the state of parking until they arrive)...to the waitress being very patient and good humored with my family.  Honestly, beyond my problems with the Factory contributing to nationwide obesity, the food is usually pretty good. Ridiculously long menu, but at least there are choices. I settled on the seared tuna salad, which was good but not great. The very popular lettuce wraps were fine as the table seemed to like them. It would be helpful to note on the menu that peanuts are sprinkled over the chicken just in case anyone is allergic (Ahem). We split two slices of cheesecake for the table. The chocolate coconut was a bit too sweet, but the red velvet white chocolate was unamimously praised. The texture of the white chocolate went nicely with the creamy soft cheesecake and decent red velvet layers. Everyone liked their meal, a feat not to be taken lightly considering the tough crowd.  Lunch for 4 can be expensive so be advised. Go with your family or someone that will pay for you."
Dee B.,"Bethesda, MD",152,1117,79,2.0,2/15/2010,"*2.5 stars* The American people are rather clearly divided into two camps where most things are concerned: conservative or liberal, Coke or Pepsi, Redskins or Cowboys, passport holder or not.  And thus it seems to also be with the Cheesecake Factory.  Lots of people think it's good or great, many others think it's not all that.   I fall into the camp of individuals who don't understand what all the fuss is about.  My visit to the White Flint Cheesecake Factory was only my second visit to a CF.  The DC area only has hundreds of interesting and good restaurants to pick from - why choose a place that serves ridiculously large and unhealthy portions of food that's not all that good? Anyway, a few observations: --Am I the only one who thinks that ""factory"" is just not an appetizing name for an eating establishment? --With a menu this big, I would not expect anything to be that fabulous. --Service was, overall, good.  My three dining compatriots had plenty of requests, and most of them the servers had no problem filling.  --I was, however, chagrined to see our waitress chomping on gum.  Not exactly professional. --The salmon lunch special was a good deal -- more than one person can/should eat (salmon plus 2 sides) for only $12.95. --The salmon was overdone, and too salty.  As other people have mentioned, everything here seems to be oversalted....I was thirsty the rest of the afternoon. --If one lived in a place with few dining options, I could understand the appeal of CF.  But when you're on Rockville Pike, and a short drive from  Bethesda, I just don't get it.  That - however - is not surprising, as there are plenty of things in this life I just don't understand!"
Cesar P.,"Rockville, MD",30,201,5,3.0,2/27/2011,"Been there a few times with the family, mostly for Sunday brunch.  Food's decent, but the portions are sometimes a little ridiculous.  It makes it a bit difficult to get dessert if you overfeed on your entree.  In fact, I don't think I've ever had a slice of cheesecake there.  They do make a great omelet, and their burgers have always been a hit with me.  And they do carry Newcastle Brown Ale, which is a big plus for me. The wait though is a bit much.  Once, we waited over an hour for dinner on a weekday night, while several other parties who came after us were seated (we were a party of 6, but still).  Thankfully the manager comped us appetizers after we complained, since they kept telling us that it'd just be another 15 minutes...  3 times in a row.  You do have to make an effort to get there early or at off times in order to avoid a long wait, which I'm willing to do if the food is stellar at a place...  But it's not here.  It's not bad, but it's not the late lamented Colorado Kitchen or Yuraku. Fun fact:  My Uncle-in-law helped build the interior of that particular location."
Dustin V.,"Rockville, MD",12,4,1,4.0,11/4/2013,"I come here because they never disappoint me, they always are good, sometime new stuff, always good service, regular chain restaurant, but I like their food though."
Paola G.,"Silver Spring, MD",335,299,34,5.0,11/25/2009,"Seriously, Who doesn't love the Cheesecake factory?  For those of you who are complaining and leaving mediocre reviews, it say's a lot about your food judgement.  Cheesecake is a chain restaurant, but it's one of the best chain restaurants in the country. From its huge portions... (who complains about big plates? take it to work the next day) to its big menu which contains food from every direction in the sense that you can be in the mood for any type of food and it will be on that menu. The service is always A+, the waiting list is always long but that has a lot to say about a restaurant that doesnt take reservations and is always, always packed.. I love this place because everyone can agree that they will find something on the menu. Everytime I order something new, it is an adventure. I have never had anything that I did not like. I am the type of person who likes to stick to the same plates because I don't like to walk out unsatisfied but that has never happened at Cheesecake and I hope I dont jinx it because I am trying something new tonight :) The cheesecakes are better than any I have ever tasted, offcourse their specialties are cheesecakes and they do a hell of a good job on them. There are soo many varieties of cheesecakes its euphoric. My favorite plates: Avocado egg rolls with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. Fried mac and Cheese with Marinara sauce, Thai lettuce wraps, Sweet corn tamales, Cajun jambalaya pasta,Santa Fe salad,Cobb salad,Miso salmon,Bang bang chicken and shrimp (Thai) Fish and Chips, ALL their steaks and chops and  the most amazing Hibachi steak..  PS: I love sauces and they are amazing here.."
Sara H.,"Washington, DC",4,41,,1.0,7/30/2012,"Service was horrible! It was over an hour between when we sat down and when we first saw food. Not one, but two, families that came after us were in and out of there by the time we were finally served. The waiter stopped by once to get our order, gave us our drinks, and just never came back. After 45 minutes we said something, and it was about an additional 15-20 before we saw food. They said ""well this just now came out"", someone in the family that came in after us ordered the exact same thing as me and it was out in 15 minutes tops. They clearly just forgot about us. The food was luke warm and the salmon tasted dry, but at that point, we were so hungry we didn't care and just told them it was fine because we didn't want to wait any longer.  This was the first time we had been there in about a year, I think I'll just stick to Bertucci's across the hall or PF Changs from now on."
Kat L.,"Great Neck, NY",270,711,238,4.0,11/19/2009,"This particular cheesecake seemed really small.  They are super anal about having your entire party ready to go before youre seated.  Heaven forbid someone use the potty before they sit down.   Our waiter was a bit off, and I think the table was too large for him (there were 5 of us).  But he did bring my basil for my strawberry martini.  Don't knock it until you try it. I don't eat cheesecake, but the consensus at the table was that the slices were the smallest they'd ever seen.  I got a whopping slice of chocolate cake and kept my mouth shut lol. Good ol' cheesecake.  Consistent, and never disappointing.  Although this location is super super dark. OH BTW new small plates menu.  Fantastic choices less than $6 a pop in normal portions for normal people."
Philip T.,"Washington, DC",70,179,112,3.0,12/5/2010,"If you're familiar with the Cheesecake Factory then you won't find anything surprising or out of the ordinary here. Compared to some newer restaurants, this Cheesecake Factory feels much more intimate, with lower ceilings and cozier booths. The food is also standard fare, good selection of food from a variety of different cuisines though none of the ethnic dishes come even close to being authentic.  During the lunch time when I came, it wasn't too busy so there was no wait. The server was very quick to bring water and bread and was very nice and energetic, though after checking in on us so many times the sheer amount of energy became slightly much.  Nevertheless, the food is good and the service was fast on the day I came. I got the Saigon Grilled Chicken Sandwich which is their version of a Banh Mi which came on a very chewy, thick crusted baguette which was a workout to chew though the flavours were good as was the peanut dipping sauce that came with it. The vegetable pasta my mom got was also good but a little bland. Overall this Cheesecake Factory is your run-of-the-mill CF, no surprises, It is located in White Flint Mall which is convenient, there is also no shortage of parking outside up front or in the garages as part of the mall."
Trevor M.,"Rockville, MD",131,187,487,3.0,8/31/2010,"All the cake without the cheese.  Let me just come out of the closet with this. I love cheesecake. It's my form of dairy laden crack...but, do i get it there? no. However, do I go there for the food and the bar....YES!!! Atmosphere: It's a chain restaurant and it's Cheesecake factory. So, their standards are medium high. It's all the local folks in your neighborhood. Now, let me state this...depending on where you sit, stand, or eat...the acoustics suck. You can't hear your loved one, you can't hear the person you're dumping...you can't hear when you're being dumped...turn down the music or fix the acoustics. Oy vey!! Food: Can we talk about a restaurant that is willing to serve just about any style of food, any ethnic style, and do it moderately well. Now, if you're a food afficiando? If you really know how to cook well...you don't come here to really critic it unless it just...well, sucks. You come here because...it's a watering hole that actually tries to please the heck out of everyone and try to do it with some panache. Hey...no flair...that's panache alone. But, what I like about their food...they are willing to amend it to your unique tastes...you don't like onions...gone. you like your chicken grilled without sauce...done.  Bar/Drinks: Nice basic martinis, good selection of alcohol...but, here's what I like...they have regulars like any other bar in Rockville/N. Bethesda...but, these barflys are local and really nice folks who appreciate the bartenders here and it shows in their interaction.  Service: Hey...it's Cheesecake factory...they're like the Disney of restaurants...all white clothing...which on some folks...not the best idea, but I get the point.  Price: Ya, know what...good, average prices for a good amount of food. There's value in dare done hills. No one is going to get that joke...huh.  Return rate: Oh, yeah...i'm there.  Bottom line.....there's a lot of cheesecake factories in Maryland/VA/DC area. I've been to a lot of them...If I don't go to the Columbia location...i'm here. But why not 4 stars? Hey, they still have to get better and get competitive with the other restaurants in the area or they will become Cheesecake Factory Diner....Hmmmm, now that's an idea...not. So...do you want to know where I get cheesecake from? Read some of my other reviews to find out. Yeah...i'm a tease."
Leslie W.,"Frederick, MD",2,9,,2.0,12/30/2013,"I was embarrassed to have subjected my family to this restaurant.  Food was just okay, service and attention to detail below par. I have eaten several times at the White Flint location with good service and tasty entrees. My family had never been to a CKF and thought that while they were visiting would be a nice treat for lunch. Waiter was friendly/polite but took too long an everything and got the order wrong, so my hub ended up with a poblano pepper instead of the poblano hamburger meal! The other items were okay, nothing to write home about.  The wrong order caused huge delay in getting served.  To make matters worse the bill arrived with the additional cost of the poblano pepper. I would have expected the waiter to have inspected the bill, especially in light of the mistake. For some reason the magnetic strip on our credit card didnt work in their machine (no problem in the Apple store in same mall ) so the waiter had to key in by hand; no problem but this took 45 minutes (ended lunch 1:04p walked out 1:47p). After my hub signed the bill the waiter stated that he needed the card again so an imprint could be made...this all sounds very unusual??? I will be keeping my receipt and monitoring my CC activity.  Did I mention they were not that busy.  So what should have taken an hour to get a simple meal, took almost two hours!!! Hope this was a fluke, but I am not likely to go back for a second try :("
Edidiong A.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,1,,2.0,8/5/2014,"I went to this CF location with some girlfriends looking forward to having lunch and just relaxing with friends. When we walked in we were greeted by a young woman who was also a waitress, she sat us down and never came back to us again. It was really awkward though because we were seated by the cash register which is also close to the kitchen. The waiters were all standing looking like they needed something to do. In the mean time we had no bread or water. When a waitress finally came over about 20-30 mins had already passed. She looked like she was already busy taking care of other people. There was A family that came in after us and got waited on before us. Smh. When the waitress finally came over with water she took our drink orders which took forever before we got that. I flagged down a waiter And asked him to get his manager, he asked what he could do for us and we told him to just cancel our order. He seemed a bit worried and promised to try his best to make our experience better. But we were already fed up. We got up to leave when a manager came and asked us if everything was Ok? We said no, told her what happened and she couldn't think of anyway to salvage the situation, she just walked away. Needless to say, I am never going back there again."

Matthew S.,"London, United Kingdom",22,22,5,3.0,29/12/2009,"Not my number 1 choice for lunch and I'm a definitely a critic of their massive, irrresponsible portion sizes. But my grandmother likes it so of course I will go.The Cheesecake Factory attracts lots of families, little kids, and older people. Nothing wrong with doing well with specific demographic groups.   The Cheesecake Factory staff was nice every step of the way. From the hostess not questioning my excuse for why the rest of my group was late (I said they were parking, which in a sense was true because everyone is in the state of parking until they arrive)...to the waitress being very patient and good humored with my family.  Honestly, beyond my problems with the Factory contributing to nationwide obesity, the food is usually pretty good. Ridiculously long menu, but at least there are choices. I settled on the seared tuna salad, which was good but not great. The very popular lettuce wraps were fine as the table seemed to like them. It would be helpful to note on the menu that peanuts are sprinkled over the chicken just in case anyone is allergic (Ahem). We split two slices of cheesecake for the table. The chocolate coconut was a bit too sweet, but the red velvet white chocolate was unamimously praised. The texture of the white chocolate went nicely with the creamy soft cheesecake and decent red velvet layers. Everyone liked their meal, a feat not to be taken lightly considering the tough crowd.  Lunch for 4 can be expensive so be advised. Go with your family or someone that will pay for you."
Dee B.,"Bethesda, United States",152,1117,79,2.0,15/2/2010,"*2.5 stars* The American people are rather clearly divided into two camps where most things are concerned: conservative or liberal, Coke or Pepsi, Redskins or Cowboys, passport holder or not.  And thus it seems to also be with the Cheesecake Factory.  Lots of people think it's good or great, many others think it's not all that.   I fall into the camp of individuals who don't understand what all the fuss is about.  My visit to the White Flint Cheesecake Factory was only my second visit to a CF.  The DC area only has hundreds of interesting and good restaurants to pick from - why choose a place that serves ridiculously large and unhealthy portions of food that's not all that good? Anyway, a few observations: --Am I the only one who thinks that ""factory"" is just not an appetizing name for an eating establishment? --With a menu this big, I would not expect anything to be that fabulous. --Service was, overall, good.  My three dining compatriots had plenty of requests, and most of them the servers had no problem filling.  --I was, however, chagrined to see our waitress chomping on gum.  Not exactly professional. --The salmon lunch special was a good deal -- more than one person can/should eat (salmon plus 2 sides) for only $12.95. --The salmon was overdone, and too salty.  As other people have mentioned, everything here seems to be oversalted....I was thirsty the rest of the afternoon. --If one lived in a place with few dining options, I could understand the appeal of CF.  But when you're on Rockville Pike, and a short drive from  Bethesda, I just don't get it.  That - however - is not surprising, as there are plenty of things in this life I just don't understand!"
Cesar P.,"Rockville, United States",30,201,5,3.0,27/2/2011,"Been there a few times with the family, mostly for Sunday brunch.  Food's decent, but the portions are sometimes a little ridiculous.  It makes it a bit difficult to get dessert if you overfeed on your entree.  In fact, I don't think I've ever had a slice of cheesecake there.  They do make a great omelet, and their burgers have always been a hit with me.  And they do carry Newcastle Brown Ale, which is a big plus for me. The wait though is a bit much.  Once, we waited over an hour for dinner on a weekday night, while several other parties who came after us were seated (we were a party of 6, but still).  Thankfully the manager comped us appetizers after we complained, since they kept telling us that it'd just be another 15 minutes...  3 times in a row.  You do have to make an effort to get there early or at off times in order to avoid a long wait, which I'm willing to do if the food is stellar at a place...  But it's not here.  It's not bad, but it's not the late lamented Colorado Kitchen or Yuraku. Fun fact:  My Uncle-in-law helped build the interior of that particular location."
Dustin V.,"Rockville, United States",12,4,1,4.0,4/11/2013,"I come here because they never disappoint me, they always are good, sometime new stuff, always good service, regular chain restaurant, but I like their food though."
Paola G.,"Silver Spring, United States",335,299,34,5.0,25/11/2009,"Seriously, Who doesn't love the Cheesecake factory?  For those of you who are complaining and leaving mediocre reviews, it say's a lot about your food judgement.  Cheesecake is a chain restaurant, but it's one of the best chain restaurants in the country. From its huge portions... (who complains about big plates? take it to work the next day) to its big menu which contains food from every direction in the sense that you can be in the mood for any type of food and it will be on that menu. The service is always A+, the waiting list is always long but that has a lot to say about a restaurant that doesnt take reservations and is always, always packed.. I love this place because everyone can agree that they will find something on the menu. Everytime I order something new, it is an adventure. I have never had anything that I did not like. I am the type of person who likes to stick to the same plates because I don't like to walk out unsatisfied but that has never happened at Cheesecake and I hope I dont jinx it because I am trying something new tonight :) The cheesecakes are better than any I have ever tasted, offcourse their specialties are cheesecakes and they do a hell of a good job on them. There are soo many varieties of cheesecakes its euphoric. My favorite plates: Avocado egg rolls with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. Fried mac and Cheese with Marinara sauce, Thai lettuce wraps, Sweet corn tamales, Cajun jambalaya pasta,Santa Fe salad,Cobb salad,Miso salmon,Bang bang chicken and shrimp (Thai) Fish and Chips, ALL their steaks and chops and  the most amazing Hibachi steak..  PS: I love sauces and they are amazing here.."
Sara H.,"Washington, DC, United States",4,41,,1.0,30/7/2012,"Service was horrible! It was over an hour between when we sat down and when we first saw food. Not one, but two, families that came after us were in and out of there by the time we were finally served. The waiter stopped by once to get our order, gave us our drinks, and just never came back. After 45 minutes we said something, and it was about an additional 15-20 before we saw food. They said ""well this just now came out"", someone in the family that came in after us ordered the exact same thing as me and it was out in 15 minutes tops. They clearly just forgot about us. The food was luke warm and the salmon tasted dry, but at that point, we were so hungry we didn't care and just told them it was fine because we didn't want to wait any longer.  This was the first time we had been there in about a year, I think I'll just stick to Bertucci's across the hall or PF Changs from now on."
Kat L.,"Great Neck, United States",270,711,238,4.0,19/11/2009,"This particular cheesecake seemed really small.  They are super anal about having your entire party ready to go before youre seated.  Heaven forbid someone use the potty before they sit down.   Our waiter was a bit off, and I think the table was too large for him (there were 5 of us).  But he did bring my basil for my strawberry martini.  Don't knock it until you try it. I don't eat cheesecake, but the consensus at the table was that the slices were the smallest they'd ever seen.  I got a whopping slice of chocolate cake and kept my mouth shut lol. Good ol' cheesecake.  Consistent, and never disappointing.  Although this location is super super dark. OH BTW new small plates menu.  Fantastic choices less than $6 a pop in normal portions for normal people."
Philip T.,"Washington, DC, United States",70,179,112,3.0,5/12/2010,"If you're familiar with the Cheesecake Factory then you won't find anything surprising or out of the ordinary here. Compared to some newer restaurants, this Cheesecake Factory feels much more intimate, with lower ceilings and cozier booths. The food is also standard fare, good selection of food from a variety of different cuisines though none of the ethnic dishes come even close to being authentic.  During the lunch time when I came, it wasn't too busy so there was no wait. The server was very quick to bring water and bread and was very nice and energetic, though after checking in on us so many times the sheer amount of energy became slightly much.  Nevertheless, the food is good and the service was fast on the day I came. I got the Saigon Grilled Chicken Sandwich which is their version of a Banh Mi which came on a very chewy, thick crusted baguette which was a workout to chew though the flavours were good as was the peanut dipping sauce that came with it. The vegetable pasta my mom got was also good but a little bland. Overall this Cheesecake Factory is your run-of-the-mill CF, no surprises, It is located in White Flint Mall which is convenient, there is also no shortage of parking outside up front or in the garages as part of the mall."
Trevor M.,"Rockville, United States",131,187,487,3.0,31/8/2010,"All the cake without the cheese.  Let me just come out of the closet with this. I love cheesecake. It's my form of dairy laden crack...but, do i get it there? no. However, do I go there for the food and the bar....YES!!! Atmosphere: It's a chain restaurant and it's Cheesecake factory. So, their standards are medium high. It's all the local folks in your neighborhood. Now, let me state this...depending on where you sit, stand, or eat...the acoustics suck. You can't hear your loved one, you can't hear the person you're dumping...you can't hear when you're being dumped...turn down the music or fix the acoustics. Oy vey!! Food: Can we talk about a restaurant that is willing to serve just about any style of food, any ethnic style, and do it moderately well. Now, if you're a food afficiando? If you really know how to cook well...you don't come here to really critic it unless it just...well, sucks. You come here because...it's a watering hole that actually tries to please the heck out of everyone and try to do it with some panache. Hey...no flair...that's panache alone. But, what I like about their food...they are willing to amend it to your unique tastes...you don't like onions...gone. you like your chicken grilled without sauce...done.  Bar/Drinks: Nice basic martinis, good selection of alcohol...but, here's what I like...they have regulars like any other bar in Rockville/N. Bethesda...but, these barflys are local and really nice folks who appreciate the bartenders here and it shows in their interaction.  Service: Hey...it's Cheesecake factory...they're like the Disney of restaurants...all white clothing...which on some folks...not the best idea, but I get the point.  Price: Ya, know what...good, average prices for a good amount of food. There's value in dare done hills. No one is going to get that joke...huh.  Return rate: Oh, yeah...i'm there.  Bottom line.....there's a lot of cheesecake factories in Maryland/VA/DC area. I've been to a lot of them...If I don't go to the Columbia location...i'm here. But why not 4 stars? Hey, they still have to get better and get competitive with the other restaurants in the area or they will become Cheesecake Factory Diner....Hmmmm, now that's an idea...not. So...do you want to know where I get cheesecake from? Read some of my other reviews to find out. Yeah...i'm a tease."
Leslie W.,"Frederick, United States",2,9,,2.0,30/12/2013,"I was embarrassed to have subjected my family to this restaurant.  Food was just okay, service and attention to detail below par. I have eaten several times at the White Flint location with good service and tasty entrees. My family had never been to a CKF and thought that while they were visiting would be a nice treat for lunch. Waiter was friendly/polite but took too long an everything and got the order wrong, so my hub ended up with a poblano pepper instead of the poblano hamburger meal! The other items were okay, nothing to write home about.  The wrong order caused huge delay in getting served.  To make matters worse the bill arrived with the additional cost of the poblano pepper. I would have expected the waiter to have inspected the bill, especially in light of the mistake. For some reason the magnetic strip on our credit card didnt work in their machine (no problem in the Apple store in same mall ) so the waiter had to key in by hand; no problem but this took 45 minutes (ended lunch 1:04p walked out 1:47p). After my hub signed the bill the waiter stated that he needed the card again so an imprint could be made...this all sounds very unusual??? I will be keeping my receipt and monitoring my CC activity.  Did I mention they were not that busy.  So what should have taken an hour to get a simple meal, took almost two hours!!! Hope this was a fluke, but I am not likely to go back for a second try :("
Edidiong A.,"Hyattsville, United States",2,1,,2.0,5/8/2014,"I went to this CF location with some girlfriends looking forward to having lunch and just relaxing with friends. When we walked in we were greeted by a young woman who was also a waitress, she sat us down and never came back to us again. It was really awkward though because we were seated by the cash register which is also close to the kitchen. The waiters were all standing looking like they needed something to do. In the mean time we had no bread or water. When a waitress finally came over about 20-30 mins had already passed. She looked like she was already busy taking care of other people. There was A family that came in after us and got waited on before us. Smh. When the waitress finally came over with water she took our drink orders which took forever before we got that. I flagged down a waiter And asked him to get his manager, he asked what he could do for us and we told him to just cancel our order. He seemed a bit worried and promised to try his best to make our experience better. But we were already fed up. We got up to leave when a manager came and asked us if everything was Ok? We said no, told her what happened and she couldn't think of anyway to salvage the situation, she just walked away. Needless to say, I am never going back there again."
