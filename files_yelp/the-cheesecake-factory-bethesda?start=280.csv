Miss T.,"Germantown, MD",6,49,,1.0,7/22/2011,"This place has really gone downhill. I came here with a group and it took 15 minutes to get a table. They tried to crowd our entire group into a medium sized circular booth.  The food took forever. Our waitress, Kimberly J, was rude and lazy and has a bad attitude.  She is a disgrace to this restaurant. We will not be returning and will keep our friends and family away."
Douglas D.,"Gaithersburg, MD",197,9,1,4.0,5/3/2012,Love this place. I frequent it a lot and it's always packed but the servers are friendly and are normally pretty good.
Kenya J.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,44,2,4.0,3/31/2014,"So, I was hungry as hell since I knew I was going to be eating here with a dear friend after work. (S'up Rollo!) I had been eating fruit all day & my stomach was growling by 5. So when the waitress showed us to our table, I growled really loud: ""I want a strawberry lemonade please!"" My boy. laughing his ass off at me, had to calm me down & tell me that she wasnt the person who would be taking our food order. So, when our server did come, I already knew what I wanted because my greedy ass had looked the menu up online before I left work, lolo!! I ordered: crab wontons for appetizers, main course: barbeque salmon, steamed broccoli, smashed potatoes & onion strings. My boy ordered a kobe beef hamburger & fries. Forgot what his appetizer was. But here's the thing, he & I were so engrossed in our conversation, that I hadnt noticed that my food was taking extra long to come. Turns out, as the manager came over to tell me, that they had overcooked my salmon. And, for my wait, I could get a free dessert! I choose carrot cake. I didnt know it would be 3 layers! But it was good! The entire meal was good! I'll be going back there again because you get good food & the portion sizes will last you 2 days tops! :-)"
liz s.,"Washington, DC",16,153,6,3.0,3/15/2012,"The menu is massive which means (1) you will have a hard time choosing something, don't try to reconcile all of the options, just go with your gut (literally) and (2) whatever you pick you will be fine with. The menu lists the calorie content. Dinner entrees are huge, so consider sharing an app although you will be fine if you skip the app. I always get a slice o' cheesecake to go. Hard to have a bad meal here, but don't expect innovation or exceptional flavors."
Tiffane C.,"Silver Spring, MD",75,172,12,4.0,11/27/2009,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory since I first dined at one seven years ago. Given its well known name, I normally wouldn't bother to write a review, but one of their menu items has given me cause to Yelp. The almighty Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is by far one of the best desserts I have ever experienced. Layers of Red Velvet cake between layers of cheesecake? Can life be any more decadent? I usually come here just to get a slice to go and whenever I bring it home, my family descends upon it in wonder as if it's a holy relic. One of the most fabulous desserts EVER and a great reward or comfort after a hard day. That aside, I've enjoyed all Cheesecake Factory restaurants and this one is no exception. As one Yelper mentioned, the lighting is extremely dim here, but it also depends on where you sit. I had a window table and I was perfectly fine. My ace in the hole entree is the BBQ Chicken Salad. It's wonderful and fills me up just as good as a ribeye would. I can't wait to go back. Great service, great variety, great food and drinks, great cheesecake, great all around!"
O. D.,"Washington, DC",0,20,,5.0,2/5/2013,"Of all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants in the DC metro area, this is by far my favorite.  I've never ordered anything from here that wasn't absolutely incredible.  Being a regular here, many of the staff know me and my family, so the service is always very hospitable and patient.  The menu is outrageous, even before you get to ordering the cheesecake.  Great service, and incredible food, always make for a great experience."
Scott C.,"Alexandria, VA",17,60,12,4.0,8/18/2012,"Can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  Had no idea they were also a fully staffed restaurant as well, with fairly reasonable prices.  Next time we go to the White Flint Mall to play at Dave & Buster's we'll probably eat here first.  Have so many flavors of cheesecake to choose from it's mind-boggling."
Susan L.,"New York, NY",163,1879,,4.0,12/1/2009,"As with all of the Cheesecake Factory locations we've been to (actually it's just a handful), this one is large and very noisy.  However, we really enjoyed our meal there (three nights ago).  Two of us had the herb-crusted salmon and one person had the combination herb-crusted salmon with shrimp scampi.  It was all delicious - including the two types of warm bread - and of course we couldn't leave without buying a (small) key lime cheesecake (pure heaven!).  Our server was terrific; attentive and extremely pleasant."
Mitchell S.,"New York, NY",37,35,35,5.0,10/21/2009,"I went for brunch here last Sunday and was tempted to leave a review. The food is amazing, of course. Always made fresh. There was a short 5-10 minute wait for a seat, but the staff members were very attentive and polite. The place was crowded with the usual Sunday crowd- couples, church-goers and a few families. I must admit, I was on a hot date so I may be a bit generous on my review as I was already having a blast anyway, CF or no CF. Anyway, our server was very attentive and immediately gave us the complete spiel on the daily specials and soups. My mind was already set though- I wanted the cajun seafood pasta- my favorite. And it was amazing; huge portions and great breadsticks too. I topped it off with cranberry juice and original cheesecake while my date had the most delicious pumpkin cheesecake I've ever tasted in my life. Yes!!!!! Please try the pumpkin cheesecake- you will NOT be disappointed. Best part is that its connected to the mall and I got to release my shopping demon and hit Bloomies and H&M in the same trip."
Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,435,3,4.0,6/5/2012,"I had the appetizer crab cakes that were really really good and the Kahlua coffee cheesecake, which was the best cheesecake I've ever had! We had a really sweet waiter, and overall had a really fun time."
Chad R.,"Silver Spring, MD",60,9,27,5.0,9/10/2012,"Excellent service, excellent food!  Without a doubt it's a wonderful place to eat with a great atmosphere.  Although the place was extremely busy when we went, the server was very attentive and earned a well-deserved 20% tip on top of our bill."
Arthur K.,"Potomac, MD",98,219,10,2.0,3/5/2009,"You know when you get seated, and just on the location of your table, you know you'll be getting horrible service for your meal? We were seated in the furthest of corners at Cheesecake last night. Way in the back. It was quite the hike to get back to the bathroom near the front doors (I exaggerate but you get the picture). Took a while for anything to get to the table. My beer took about 30 minutes to arrive. That's after a manager finally spotted us. Likewise, our meals, extra bread, refills, all took a while. As noted earlier I had a bit to drink. Which prompted me to blurt out ""dude you suck"" as our waiter walked away when he finally checked up on us. I swear he didn't hear, but my companions insist that he probably did. Service was much better after that. Food was decent. The expansive menu always takes a lot longer to browse through. The Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich (Buffalo style) was not as good as I though it would be. The Thai Lettuce wraps were good. My BBQ burger was ok.  The 30-year Anniversary cheesecake was ok, but very sweet. I very much liked the crunchy chocolate that coats the outside of the cheesecake. The new Banana Cream cheesecake was enjoyable. Not as sweet as the other cheesecakes, which was a good thing. It was considerably softer in texture and served with fresh bananas."
Sergio K.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,2.0,12/27/2012,"Wait, wait, wait.... if you like that, this is the place for you!  We hadn't been here in over a year.One reason we don't come more often is the long lines. I guess we chose the wrong day to come back: the day after Christmas. It was pretty late, 9:30 pm after movies, we figured it should be OK. We were partly right. We were seated right away, but then  the real waiting started...  We ordered nothing fancy, salad, pasta and side dish. An hour later, my pasta finally arrived.Judging by its sad aspect, it had been seating on the counter for at least half hour. The pasta was dry, the chicken overcooked. The side dish never came, but by then I was so fed up I did not want to wait a minute longer. I complained to the store manager and to his credit he offered us free dessert to make amends. Nice gesture, but I would rather have fresh food timely served than free dessert.  One intriguing fact of the Cheesecake Factory menu. The menu does not show the price for cocktails and beers. My guess is that this is a strategy to maximize profits from sales of alcohol. I asked the waiter who gave me a lame excuse (""we operate in many states which have different taxes on alcohol, so we need to print a single menu without prices....""). Really does not stand up to reason: food and wine are also taxed differently in every state but every bottle of wine and every food item in the menu has a price. What do you think? Why do restaurants hide the price of cocktails and beers?"
Gina M.,"Rockville, MD",6,9,,2.0,10/11/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner (on the weekend) which is not recommended. We had a party of 10 which soon became a party of 6 and we waited 2 hours!! I learned that they do not do reservations on the weekends, which I guess I can understand because then everyone and their mom would have one. I wanted to leave after the 1st hour, but since people started arriving, it was too late and they decided to sit at the bar and drinks are not cheap. The food was just okay, I ordered a turkey burger and it came with a salad and not much of salad at that. Just leaves in olive oil. I didn't even order the cheesecake, which is what I came for because quite frankly, I was tired of waiting and already spend $70 on drinks and food just for myself and pitching in something for the birthday girl. While this might be a nice place for a couple, I've always had at least a 40 minute wait, even with 2 or 3 people. The only thing really okay with the dinner was the server, he was the most upbeat and friendly server I've seen in a while. I don't think there will be a next time at this point though."
Thomas G.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,11,,3.0,11/15/2012,"The food is fresh, I cant complain about the food here, but its nothing spectacular either. I don't like coming to this particular cheesecake factory because service is a bit slow. Its always full of big parties and waiting is crazy. The herb Salmon is very well prepared and is usually what I order."
Kimberly L.,"Olney, MD",0,7,,4.0,6/10/2014,"I like having the Cheesecake Factory in Montgomery Mall. It's closer to my office and a good place to dine for lunch. Their SkinnyLicious menu offers a variety of options at a cheaper price.  Their portions sizes are smaller, but great for the lunch hour.  I did not realize they do accept reservations during the lunch hour, but the majority of the party has to be present in order to be seated.  As long as you tell people to be on time, you should have no problems being seated and greeted with great service.  I have not had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have always been satisfied with the food for dine-in and take-out."
Christine L.,"Silver Spring, MD",65,43,17,4.0,5/28/2011,Why are people hating on Cheesecake Factory? The American in me loves the huge portions you get at this place. I haven't gone wrong with any of the appetizers yet and this place serves some of the best pasta around. There is always a bit of a wait for this place.
Robert R.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",0,10,,3.0,5/22/2014,This is one of the few places that my wife and I can actually agree upon for lunch.  The pasta dishes are very flavorful and plentiful.  The wait to get a table can be a PITA though.  We usually share a desert to top off the meal.  We have never had a bad meal here.  Good food!
David T.,"New York, NY",50,25,1,4.0,2/29/2012,Good portion size. Environment conducive for conversation! Pretty consistent.
Kathleen C.,"Potomac, MD",5,47,8,4.0,2/25/2014,"Food is always okay to good at this restaurant chain. Service is always decent too, so if you like relatively large portions of whatever entree you order of nicely prepared food, then The Cheesecake Factory is for you! I always love the salads, but there are too many choices to review on this book- like menu and the portions may keep you from the cheesecake decision list, but if you have a hankering for a desert you can't go wrong with the cheesecake here or for that matter the strawberry shortcake. The strawberry shortcake is a very large biscuit filled with vanilla ice cream and then piled high with strawberries and topped with whipped cream. The shortcake can serve 3 or 4 people if they have eaten their own entrees or even shared them with others. Drink prices are fairly high and not posted on the menu so you better ask for the cost or you may be shocked. The new skinnylicious menu is very tasty and the calorie count may even allow you to have a bite of dessert."
