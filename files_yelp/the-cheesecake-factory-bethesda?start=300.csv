Alexandra M.,"Charlotte, NC",41,266,11,3.0,3/28/2009,"if you read cate's review, you will read that my 10-year old looking waitress didnt put a lemon in my water. a huge pet peeve of mine, and i definitely expect it if i am paying almost $8 for a cheesecake.  cate's water looked as though someone took a huge first sip out of it.  after looking at the cheesecake menu i picked the dulce de leche. why? because every time my boyfriend and i come he is never in the ""mood"" for the dulce de leche cheesecake. but you know what? today was MY day because it was my birthday. so i got what i wanted.  it came out with a little candle and a big plate that said happy birthday on it with chocolate. nice touch.  i really enjoyed my cheesecake. i liked this CF bar area, but have experienced bigger ones. they have great bar food."
Melissa P.,"New York, NY",20,83,10,3.0,1/25/2010,I have a love hate relationship with this place. I think I am the only person I know who doesn't go bananas over this place! I think the food is entirely too rich (read drenched in butter) and entirely too salty. I really love their sweet corn tamales though! those things are amazing. That really should be the only thing I order when I go but with a menu upwards of 15 pages i always try for an entree hoping to not be disappointed and like a good for nothing boyfriend I am constantly let down :( This really should be a 2-star rating but have you tried those sweet corn tamales! Yum!
Janis W.,"Bethesda, MD",0,58,,1.0,11/28/2012,can never get the take out order correct.....even supposedly when the manager takes and packs the order.  It's not rocket science!
Gidget T.,"Honolulu, HI",179,96,194,4.0,3/7/2009,"My husband and I had our first date here, so I have very fond memories of this place, and they have never let me down. My favorite dish is the Angel Hair Pasta or the Cesar Salad.  The salad is so generous that I can never finish it in one sitting.  An average meal without alcohol is around $20.  It can get noisy there if you go during the dinner or lunch rush.  And you might find yourself waiting around 20 - 45 minutes.  However, there is enough shops at White Flint to keep me occupied, so I don't mind. The service is great.  I always find the serves to be knowledgeable and helpful when ordering.  If you don't mind a wait and some noise, it's a delicious place to grab dinner.  Minus one star for noise and long lines, but four stars for amazing cheesecake and menu selections."
elizabeth O.,"Washington, DC",112,7,1,5.0,1/16/2012,Dinner is always better when u don't have to pay... I had the filet mignon and Patrick was my server... awesome services ... Lots of food fair prices..
Hero L.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/7/2013,"I visit Maryland for a week, I took kids to eat, I ate chick sharp bone in chicken salad, waiter took the bone and show to manager, then manager came out, and check if I am alright, and asked me where the bone, I think they are not trust what I said. End up I paid full bill, not even credit the salad I found the bone, I won't go that place again. Service is bad."
C W.,"Washington, DC",2,231,52,1.0,4/8/2014,"I removed my first review since it was for the old White Flint location.  Now that I've gone to the Montgomery Mall location for HH, lunch, and carryout, I can write an accurate review for this location.  Cheesecake Factory at Montgomery Mall is definitely not the same as White Flint.  The space is small, food tastes terrible, service sucks.  We recently went here for a work luncheon.  I normally order the Steak Diane which is always cooked perfect (medium-rare) in a flavorful sauce in combination with the mashed potato and mushrooms (to die for!)  But on my most recent visit, it tasted like it was basked with salt water...the sauce needed to be diluted in water or something.  The steak was well-done...like burnt well-done.   The cheesecake itself is still good, but the carryout line/system--TERRIBLE.  With one cashier, 4 people behind the counter prepping and it still took forever for them to box my to-go slice.  When they finished and placed a box on the counter without a word, I had to interrupt the cashier's conversation to ask ""is this mine?"""
Laura W.,"Carrboro, NC",94,223,5,3.0,10/24/2008,"Meh. I don't get what all the fuss is about. A coworker of mine raved about it and said it was so good she wanted to have her wedding reception here, but I wasn't all that enamored. Sure, it's a big plate of food that you can take home for leftovers, but I've had better at other restaurants. Also, it concerns me that they offer no nutritional information on their website. Having to list it on the menu would be business suicide, but not even listing it on the site? Shady.  I have heard that people like to go here because it's a place you can ""take a group of people, and everyone's happy."" I found that that translates to an amalgam of food options that merely hints at a more exciting fare but stays mostly in a safe, bland zone. Honestly, I prefer restaurants who do one kind of cuisine and do it really well. I would probably only come here a 2nd time if it were with another pre-determined group outing  or for the happy hour specials. I would say that at least this place is better than the Macaroni Grill (where there is no macaroni), in that the Cheesecake Factory does actually sell cheesecake. This particular location is in the mall, which has kind of a weird parking lot and entrance. The service was OK but nothing special."
Renato S.,"Frederick, MD",8,341,69,4.0,8/27/2009,"All the cheesecake factories seem the same to me.  I've never eaten at this location on a friday or saturday night so I've never had an issue with bad service or it being too busy.   I only order the jambalaya pasta, boneless wings, and dolce du leche cheesecake and always been happy with the food."
Matthew L.,"Baltimore, MD",990,726,161,3.0,4/15/2009,"As far as rating the Cheese Cake factory, I have to rate it against the other versions in the chain and against other restaurants.  This one is in the middle.  The menu is always overwhelming, but we managed to get through.  This is the first place I tried the buffalo bites.   I don't recommend it.  The avacado spring roles were overly rich.  They did have terrific service and the dessert was wonderful as usual."
Delmar H.,"Austin, TX",3,8,2,3.0,8/10/2011,"Nothing unique to mention since the Cheesecake Factory is a chain. I just wanted to comment on the excellent service we had at this location. Our drinks stayed full, and the delivery of the food was prompt. Servers were talkative and friendly."
Kathleen R.,"Manhattan, NY",285,215,152,3.0,2/19/2008,"When I was ten years old and came here for the first time, I thought that the Cheesecake Factory was the best restaurant in the world :-)  Checking my general ""chain disdain"" for a moment, there are ups and downs to consider here. Some annoying factors to acknowledge: 1. Freakily friendly servers.   I'm upbeat by nature, but I've been almost frightened by the level of enthusiasm from CF's waiters -- on issues like whether I know how their tea is sweetened.  It's as if they were trained by Brian at Chotchkie's in ""Office Space""  -- minus the mandatory flare.  Of course I'd prefer over-enthusiasm to the alternative, but really, these people must get hit on their heads with happy sticks before their shifts begin. 2. The portions are also obnoxiously large.  Who am I kidding -- this doesn't bother me.  I can just choose to pig out, share or doggy-bag it. 3. The unbelievably long wait times, and corresponding buzzers.  Again, I thought these were cool as a kid -- until I realized that you have to be about two steps away from the door in order to stay in range.  As others have mentioned, during peak times, just stalk seats near the bar.  If you score one, you can order anything off the menu and avoid the wait. All in all, there's something annoyingly appealing that earns this place its three stars and keeps me coming back every once and awhile.  I mean, I've always liked the food from CF, and compared to NYC restaurants, you definitely get bang for your buck.   Final tip:  Who needs restraint?  For a full American hedonistic experience, save room for some freakin' cheesecake.  You can do it!"
Bill R.,"Silver Spring, MD",3,52,1,2.0,9/14/2012,"Extremely loud and busy (even on weeknights). Good wait service, but food service is a little on the slow side. Portion sizes are enormous, even for ""skinny"" items. I ordered a salad, which was the size of a small country, and was incredibly disappointed that the ingredients were neither quality nor fresh. The pears tasted like they were from a can. The cheesecake is full of low-quality ingredients and fatty fillers. They don't call it a ""factory"" for nothing. For the life of me, I don't understand why so many people like this place, unless their taste buds are dead or they just want to gorge on mediocre food. I think two stars here is generous, as I will never go back to any restaurant in this chain."
sergio m.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,9,3,2.0,10/25/2010,"I agree with many other reviewers, this place is overhyped and its past its prime. The Cheesecake Factory used to be a hip place to eat out in the early 90's... but now it seems its just generic and dated like a cheap Las Vegas hotel buffet. The decor in this particular Cheesecake is campy and very early 90's (think Luxor Hotel in Vegas). Its no longer cool. Now to the food, their chicken salad sandwich on toasted brie was gross. It had too much mayonaise & too much garlic. The chicken itself must have been boiled because it tasted like nothing. Because of this, the overwhelming taste of the garlic buttered brie bread was overbearing almost to the point of it being inedible. It was a HUGE sandwich but quantity did not make up for quality.  Their pepperoni pizza was average, the tex mex wraps were BLAH and lacked flavor although it was filled with black beans, avocado, rice onions and tomatoes. The carlton salad was OK but the ""vinaigrette"" dressing didn't seem to have any vinegar at all, it was rather sweet and oily much like sesame seed oil. The chicken mixed in their carlton salad also seemed to be boiled as it was also flavorless. They might as well have used tofu !  The one thing that I liked was the buffalo wings that were crispy, spicy and juicy. Overall, I'd go back if I was starving but I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes to get in."
Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,245,144,2.0,8/10/2010,"I used to like the food here a few years ago, but either its gone downhill or my taste buds have matured.  Before I review the actual food, I should say that of course the cheesecake is unbelievably fantastic, not a bad one in the bunch, and worth every penny of the almost $7 per slice.  That being said, keep in mind that you can come in and order a slice to go from the counter.  So there really is no need to eat here, and I would recommend doing just that (ordering a slice to go). I ate here last night after about a year-long hiatus (from the menu, not the cheesecake).  I was disappointed to see the salad I wanted, the Endive & Blue cheese, is no longer on the menu.  That was all I wanted, an appetizer salad and some cheesecake.  I looked at the other app salad options and remember trying 2 others and not liking either one: the Country French and Fresh Vegetable.  When I had the Country French a few years ago, I sent it back because there were PICKLED BEETS on it.  The menu says fresh beets, which to me are crunchy and raw.  About a year ago I had the Fresh Vegetable and swore I'd never have it again: it was like someone dumped a bag of frozen mixed vegetables on a salad (in fact, the green beans may have still been frozen).  Shouldn't have mattered considering I ordered the salad for the white cheaddar (as stated in the menu), only they didn't have white cheddar, so they put some other cheese on there that had no taste.   So I ended up getting Evelyn's favorite pasta, which I used to really enjoy.  Last time I had it (about a year ago), I found it to be really oily and left my lips slippery...just an unpleasant sensation overall.  But looking over the rest of the menu and remembering other mediocre meals from the past, I decided to stick with the Evelyn's pasta.  Bad choice.  I don't know what happened this time, but it tasted like feet.  Really salty feet.  I haven't had such horrible tasting food in I don't know how long.  I could barely bring myself to eat more than a couple of bites.   I am officially done with this place.  Take-out cheesecake will be the only thing I'll order ever again."
Johnny M.,"Rockville, MD",0,52,14,3.0,8/28/2011,Overpriced for average food with good presentation.  Food looks much prettier than it tastes.  Great drink selection but again overpriced.  Spent over $250 for a party of four.  For that money could have gotten much better food elsewhere.  Not saying I'd never go back but definitely not going back soon.  On the upside service was spot on.
Jay S.,"Bethesda, MD",1,8,,4.0,6/2/2013,"Great food, lots of variety, though I usually get the Louisiana chicken pasta. A little high on the fattening side, but still very good!"
Melissa Y.,"Toronto, Canada",93,524,52,3.0,5/4/2008,"The whole time I was eating here, I couldn't help but think about my Parisian coworkers and what they might say if they saw the ""portion so large only an American could love it"" sized salad that the waiter placed in front of me.  That said, if I lived my entire life dictated by Parisians I'd probably smoke a whole lot more cigarettes and drink a lot more wine.  Our family was hungry, tired and generally wiped out and looking for a place where five of us could all get something we like.  Despite concerns about trying to hit up a Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night with a party of five and no reservation, we held our breath and went for it.  Shocker, the wait was only 35 minutes and we were ultimately seated in one of the quieter and more private booths in the joint.   I'm usually overwhelmed by anti-chain sensibility, but the food here is always consistent, always tasty and generally a good dining experience.  Even if it is a little bit lowest common denominator..."
DH H.,"New York, NY",91,895,2,3.0,1/6/2008,"Secret tip (because I doubt I will ever go here again so I don't mind sharing): Annoyingly hover around the tables in the bar area.  They serve the same food as the main restaurant area, and the bar tables are no less comfortable either.  Rather than waiting hours in line, just be a vulture, and jump ahead of all the people who are hanging out like jackasses in the hallway. Frankly, this place isn't good enough to wait for.  Yeah the portions are huge and it's not that pricey, but come on.. Also, WORST PARKING LOT EVER -- must valet."
