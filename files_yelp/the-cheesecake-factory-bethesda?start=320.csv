Rosa H.,"Rockville, MD",0,9,,5.0,3/15/2013,"This place is awesome. I often drop by the Cheesecake Factory for a piece of cheesecake desert and even though the place is usually packed with people (especially on Fridays and weekends), the service is pretty prompt on the cheesecake section. If you plan to dine-in, your waiting time could be pretty long though."
John W.,"East Elmhurst, NY",157,376,,4.0,8/21/2006,"Mixed Cuisine I still love coming to this Cheesecake Factory.  I know it's a national franchise, but this was the first one I ever went to and I enjoyed the food alot here.  What to order?  There is plenty to order here!  Alot of different types of cuisines to fit your tastes.  The first time I came here, I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, which was enough for 2 meals (I took the leftovers home).  The next time I came here, I ordered the Chicken Marsala, it was soo good, I couldn't just leave the leftovers, I just ate it all in one sitting. Yes, everyone says what makes the Cheesecake Factory the best is their cheesecake dessert.  But for me coming from NYC, we have Junior's cheesecake, and I still think that is the best."
Rachel G.,"Montgomery, MD",2,29,,4.0,4/4/2010,"I've been here many times in the past. I am a huge fan of the Chinese Chicken Salad. Moreover, the menu is so large that everyone can find something they are in the mood for. I think most of their food is decent. It's not fine dining - if you are looking for that, go somewhere else. It is good, consistent (and sometimes salty) chain dining.   We have had a few great experiences with servers being just fabulous with our small daughter. They have found little cups to entertain her while we waited for food, brought her cutup bananas and bread, and just generally dote on her.  The waits can be long, but it's worth it."
Corey A.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,17,,4.0,2/11/2011,"You always know what you are going to get with this place. The food isn't anything outrageously good, but it is decent. The portions are HUGE! The cheesecakes are also very good. Serves are all polite and friendly. Overall a pretty quality place to go...."
Stephanie G.,"Washington, DC",0,9,,1.0,2/20/2012,"I've always loved cheesecake factory and really wanted to eat here for my birthday.  Called in the morning to see if I could do call ahead seating or a reservation, which they don't, I told the hostess on the phone that I was going to have about twenty people and I had told them all to meet there and that we wanted to eat around 7 or 8 and wanted to know what time i should come in since we were probably going to be put on a wait list. She told me to get there around 6pm. At 6pm, when we said a party of 20, they said it would be four hours. I've worked in the food industry my whole life and I've never in my life told someone they would have to wait four hours for a table, that's essentially telling someone to get the hell out and find somewhere else to go (which is fine, because we did).  All I can say is that if you have a large party or are planning a special event, I wouldn't suggest coming here, I felt like my business wasn't wanted."
Michael C.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,249,17,1.0,8/9/2009,"Avoid like plague.  Server was atrocious, kind of an air-head.  Had to listen to birthday song, absolutely obnoxious.  Carbonara was not in a creamy sauce as stated on menu and was too salty.  Although I mentioned this to server, she just muttered something and never addresed the issue.  Came back with the dessert menu like nothing happened.  Manager made up some stuff about prosciutto being salty, even though it is not even an ingredient listed on menu.  Oh, and to top it off, there was a couple making out and going at it for awhile; get a room!  Love the cheesecake factories back in California though."
Louis P.,"Washington, DC",5,76,18,4.0,4/4/2010,"Good place to eat and the menu is quite extensive so there's just about something for everyone. Only issues are that, with a menu so vast, certain dishes here tend to be ho-hum and nothing too special. And since this place is almost always packed, especially at nighttime, the decibel level in here can get loud."
Ina C.,"Westwood, MA",380,697,93,4.0,1/11/2008,"Good: Most dishes on the menu are fool-proof. If it sounds good, it's probably gonna be good. Bad: OMG, THE WAIT! I guess anyone who knows anything about Cheesecake knows about the wait. God created the Bertucci's next door to accommodate Cheesecake's overflow-- Good: But at least the second choice isn't bad. And Cheesecake is open until 11pm, I believe, so if you go before or after peak hours, you'll be seated right away. Bad: It's pretty loud at times. During peak hours, expect to hear the birthday song at least 5 times. Good: If you're a light eater like me, order one entree and you have your dinner for that night, breakfast AND lunch for the following day. What a deal! (The portions ARE that huge) *Tip: No need to park in the main parking lot in front of the restaurant or do valet. Try the garage in front of Lord and Taylor (on your left side if you're facing the restaurant). It's around the same distance."
Vannie N.,"Silver Spring, MD",30,113,17,3.0,2/20/2009,"When I use to go here back when I was a freshmen in college it was really good, but over the years the Cheesecake Factory has started to just slip down in my ratings. Their pasta dishes are the best pasta I have tasted so far. And the cheesecake is amazing and the variety of cheesecake they have on the menu is good too. But I wish they would take reservations!! The place have the longest wait. After getting seated, they put you in those booths were your table is 4 inches away from the  an annoying group that is so loud that you can't even enjoy your meal. What can I say the food is good but the ambiance is terrible."
Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,2.0,5/19/2008,"For the life of me, I can't understand why there is always a wait here. For one, I've never seen too many shoppers in White Flint Mall at any given time so it's not like the clientle are shoppers looking to grab a bite b/c the food court sucks, which it does. Second, you can literally rub elbows with Rockville's elite (and not so elite). The tables are so closely spaced, you'd think you asked for a table for 30. Some of you may argue that, ""Hey! They have booths you know!"" Fair enough. But you generally have to wait even longer for a booth and the booths are made in such a manner that you can definitely feel the nervous diner behind you tapping their feet as their date takes a turn for the worse. Third, the wait is ridiculous. I'll wait for many things but not 30-50 minutes for $15 pasta and $10 burgers. And if White Flint were a mall you could actually do some shopping in, the buzzers would help. Most times, I find that people receive a buzzer and either go to Border's, but not too far into it in fear of the buzzer going out of range, or just wait in the lobby of the mall or Cheesecake. One reviewer stated they take reservations, but every time I've called they told me that they do not. Seeing how busy it is, I doubt a reservation system would be in their best interest. Food - All gripes aside, the Thai Lettuce Wraps are fantastic, the Cajun Jambalaya is overrated, and if your namesake is a factory of an item, said item better be dang good, and it is! My favorite is the black-raspberry truffle. Mmmmmm!!! The brown bread with the oats on it is sweet and soft while the sourdough is a wee bit too sour for me. Service - How do them mugs manage to work in a restaurant and keep their all-white uniforms completely free of stains? Either they use some stainguard that can cause numerous forms of cancer and should not be used if you are pregnant, expecting to become pregnant, or nursing, or they've become experts at navigating the really tight confines of the Rockville Cheesecake. Location - It's in White Flint Mall. Apparently, people only go here for Cheesecake or Bertucci's if they'd rather wait 15 minutes rather than 50. If you've got 3 hours to kill before whatever it is you were planning on doing in Rockville, if that plan didn't include an hour visit to Border's, I definitely recommend this place for the good food. The food seems to be better here but the wait times seem to be MUCH better at the Columbia Cheesecake."
Andrew S.,"Rockville, MD",0,43,,2.0,10/22/2008,"First of all, I have to say that our waiter was very polite and helpful.  Nothing else good can be said about this trip to the cheesecake factory.  The restaurant was essentially empty yet it took 30 minutes to seat us. Once we were seated the hostess was borderline rude when we asked for different table.  I felt this was a very legitimate request consider one of our party was 8 months pregnant and wanted to sit in a booth and not a chair.  The hostess however, did not. I ordered Fettucini Alfredo, with a few changes, whichthe waiter was helpful with, however I was then informed that they were out of fettucini noodles, which I found slightly odd. The single worst part of the dining experience had to be when the appetizers arrived.  About three waiters arrived, one woman was so rude that it was ridiculous.  She had apparently not thought to pick up the plate of Nachos with a napking and said that it was hot.  We were at a tiny table and were trying to make room for her when she got exasperated, started moving our food around and then threw the plate on the table and walked away. I picked up the plate and held it for about a minute just to prove it wasn't even that hot.  That was the rudest waitress I've ever seen in a restaurant. All in all it was a very bad experience and even though the food was pretty good it just can't eclipse the rudeness of the staff and the overall bad atmosphere of the restaurant."
Thugnificent M.,"Washington, DC",51,290,20,3.0,6/5/2007,"Nice restaurant, generic food.  Everything they have here looks like something I could probably get in the frozen foods aisle from Giant.  Very bland and not much taste.  Usually there's a bit of a wait.  I guess people around here don't have taste for flavor.  The cheesecake is their main draw.  I don't eat the stuff myself, but everyone I know that does says it's pretty decent here.  I have a friend that works here, but he never hooks it up so no point in going.  Between this place and TGI Friday down the street, I'd rather go Fridays."
Melody S.,"Bethesda, MD",2,6,,3.0,8/8/2007,"Nice atmosphere for a semi-casual dinner, but MAKE A RESERVATION! This place is always packed during the night and you're guaranteed a wait of at least 30 minutes (or in my case, 1 whole hour). Stemming from its name, they're pretty known for their cheesecake. And yes, the cheesecake is absolutely scrumptious, but as for their lunch/dinner menus? Nothing special.  Their portion sizes are enormous but as far as quality goes, not worth my money. I'd suggest coming here just for the dessert and even at that, do it to-go. They have excellent seasonal cheesecake so definitely look into that!  Otherwise, just your typical American restaurant."
Andrew W.,"Bethesda, MD",51,106,,1.0,10/15/2008,"fuck you cheesecake factory. you are an insult to food. you are the kind of vomit that suburbaned mommified moomoo wearers clap for in between reruns of general hospital, oprah,  jerry springer, and trying to eat their own fingers rather than move. i would give you negative one stars if i could. actually, since your location puts you at the confluence of  two of the worst things mankind has created (a mall and the rockville pike), i'd probably give you negative three, but i can't.  why the fuck am i reviewing you at all?! public awareness campaign. i work in bethesda. yes. it's sad. i know. what's even sadder is that people i work with actually go here for lunch. in fact, despite my protests, they're doing it right fucking now. there's hundreds of independent restaurants in bethesda, or even the godforsaken stripmalls of the pike for fuck's sake, and yet, they come here. to order overpriced, ludicrously sized entrees piled into fake-butter splashed mountains with seasoning akin to spit, off of a hodge-podge screw-loose menu with the culinary logic and texture of gerber gone wrong. then wash it all down with a diet coke and top it of with some contrived, solidified sugar-fat masquerading as ""cheesecake"". i apologize to myself for having tried this place out, but am partially forgiven in that i never paid. a while back i had hurt my leg badly, was on crutches, and couldn't walk for months. this makes cooking interesting. so a considerate friend got me certificates to a few restaurants with curb-side pick-up. you know what kind of restaurants those were. but the outbacks and chilis of the world are like michelin starred cherrubs compared to this backwash. i ordered two things here, tried to eat them, failed, trashed them, and gave the rest of the certificate away. i'd rather have crawled over hot pavement in the dc summer to the golden arches or some shit than call on this place again.  as if the ninth circle of foodhell wasn't bad enough, they've gone and made a tenth. and they've called it cheesecake factory. thou shalt burn for this. get the fuck off my planet."
Ingi Z.,"Potomac, MD",155,18,,4.0,5/29/2011,"all i can say is yum! and I love their mojito's!! love their snack's and their cheesecakes are delicious, I love going there just to grab a quick bite and a drink w/ friends! their meals are a little too hefty for my liking so i tend to stay away"
Ryan N.,"Aldie, VA",1,136,,2.0,9/25/2009,"Been here 3 or 4 times and only had good service once. Food is all decent, but the menu is so broad, it can take forever to decide and its just a roll of the dice if its going to be good or not. The best thing I have had here is a greasy burger which you can really just get anywhere, so its not worth the wait in my opinion."
Den F.,"Baltimore, MD",113,251,279,3.0,2/22/2009,"it seems like there is always a wait. when you do get seated, the tablets are really close to each other and its packed. of course the portions are huge, and taste pretty good. there is nothing WOW about this place, but its i feel like its a classic."
Jay K.,"Washington, DC",1,78,,5.0,7/3/2008,"This is my first and favorite Cheesecake Factory from the ones that I have been to.  The wait to get a table is almost always long, but it is worth it.  The calamari is delicious and almost all the plates I have tried are really good.  Some recommendations I have are the Cajun Jambalaya, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Pasta Da Vinci.  I always go back to this restaurant and it is one of my favorites."
