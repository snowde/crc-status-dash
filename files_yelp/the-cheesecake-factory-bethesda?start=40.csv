Shawna M.,"Derwood, MD",35,142,275,1.0,7/15/2016,"Disclaimer-- this review is based only on the service. Typically, I go to Cheesecake Factory for their huge menu that has something for everyone. The food is typically pretty tasty and they have a vast ""skinnylicious"" menu. Always consistent and the honey wheat bread is great.  Today I visited for a lunch around 1:05. Our party of 4 was promptly seated. Javina was our waitress and was pleasant. She took our drink orders shortly after we sat down and then did not bring those drinks for at least 10-15 mins. She then took our order and proceeded to take drinks and the order of another table before inputting our order into the computer. Usually our food comes out quickly and to the proper temperature. Today was no different, but that was after she finally inputted the order. The food arrived to the table at approximately 1:45. So 40 mins for 2 salads and 2 sandwiches. It wasn't the speed in the kitchen, but the speed of the server. The food runner was pleasant and retrieved the bread I requested. After we were served, I asked the waitress for a refill assuming it would take a while to get and I was right. I could see our waitress leisurely talking to staff near the kitchen while I waited for my refill. I honestly would not have minded if she was prompt otherwise. I was so annoyed with the service today I almost asked for another service. So will I return? I will because I'm assuming this is a fluke, but if I get this waitress I would ask to be sat in a different section."
Rhonda W.,"Germantown, MD",13,138,396,5.0,3/25/2017,"This place has a surplus of choices. The menu reads just like a mini book! Anything you have a taste for you will indeed find it. Portions include enough for the very next meal. How can you eat that much food? Portion sizes are just too big but leftovers mean I don't have to cook later.... works for me! I have never had a dish that I didn't enjoy. I have had every meal (brunch, lunch and dinner) and never disappointed. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cheesecake. It simply incorporates my two favorite desserts. Red velvet and Cheesecake. Just like heaven on a plate. It's so decadent! I never eat the whole thing, and I mean slice, in one sitting... I need to spread out the experience. The restaurant also has valet parking in case you can't find parking. It is a busy mall so after you eat walk off those calories :)"
Norman W.,"Los Angeles, CA",413,35,6,2.0,3/5/2017,"Great food, terrible service. Bartender completely forgot my order, and waited for there while he took new costumers.  He didn't even feel bad about it. He was actually rude about me re ordering.. never coming to this location again. I recommend no one to come here for the bar, especially if the bald dude with the tattoo on his ring finger is working.. he was not the nicest person in the world.. very disappointed"
Long N.,"Germantown, MD",56,38,,1.0,11/12/2017,"My final check came out to be $52.37. I asked the waiter Donald V to pay with my $50 gift card and the remainder on my other CC. Donald came back with a final check difference of $10.70. I was a little confused and asked him if the tip was already added to the final bill and he showed me a gc check for $41.67 and the remainder for 10.70. I thought ok, the gift card may be short so I went ahead and paid with the additional tip. When I came home to check the balance on the gift card, there was a charge of $50.00 from the cheesecake. Something is not right with this transaction."
Brian L.,"Rockville, MD",15,66,37,3.0,11/19/2017,"It had been years since I went to the cheese cake factory. Only things I remembered before going last night were that there is a huge menu, it's a very popular restaurant, and they have great cheesecake. Not much has changed but I was enlightened on the quality of the food and the service. First I went on a Friday night with a party of and no reservation. I was surprised and impressed there was no wait. May have been because we dined at 10:00 pm. The restaurant didn't seem very busy but our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with our party. Slow off the bat and slow at keep drinks refilled. What was frustrating was that there always seemed to be 4 employees standing around not doing anything. At one point there were about 10 empty plates on our table that needed to be removed and a group of employees was literally standing next to our table. Several of them looked at the table and clean up. Later when a food runner dropped off some of main courses I politely asked him to take some of the plates and he had an attitude, he scoffed but he took them. Regarding the food, the crab dip was good. The egg rolls were wack. The bread to start was decent. Rock hard butter but decent bread. My main course was a bacon cheese burger. I think it was called the bacon bacon burger. Asked for it medium rare, it came medium well and was not very good. Five guys is about 10 times better than that burger. Fries were good but not hot. The highlight of the evening was the macadamia nut cheese cake. If it weren't for the cheesecake I would never return. Next time I would literally only order the cheesecake. In conclusion the menu is huge and eclectic but the only thing they've mastered is the cheese cake."
R L H.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,15,36,3.0,2/2/2017,"My friends and I came here for an appetizer, dessert and a few drinks we arrived close to closing time and so the restaurant was not busy. The  waitress was courteous and smiled; that part was great but on the other hand she stayed gone from the table so long that we had to get other staff to try to locate her. Then  when we ordered dessert she was standing at the CC counter chatting it up with a coworker with our Cheesecakes in her hand. We were in there sooo long b/c of this. Even when she brought the check, we could have literally walked out  and been long gone before she returned. The food was great and restroom was pretty clean."
Heather B.,"Wailuku, HI",339,265,1844,4.0,5/21/2016,It's the cheesecake factory what's not to like? I haven't been into this mall in years. I had no idea they had moved it over from white flint. I must say I should probably come back and see what else they've done to this mall. We had a lovely experience. We requested to sit outside on thier patio looking area so that my friend could keep an eye on her nail shop. Even though the section wasn't open and had no server assigned to it they accommodated us. Our server was so nice and kept coming to check on us. The food was great just like all thier locations. We had a very pleasant experience overall. No complaints about anything.
Kizi N.,"Washington, DC",68,75,246,4.0,7/26/2016,Perfectly located and ideal for any occasion. My family and I visited for Fathers Day and we had an amazing time. Party of 17. Service and food were great!
Dragonlover F.,"Bethesda, MD",0,35,2,4.0,3/6/2017,"Pretty good.  I got some of the pasta. It comes with chunks of chicken, regular tomato sauce and this green sauce that tasted pretty good. Unfortunately I did not order any cheesecake :( Their pink lemonade is great too, but it's WAY too sweet. (There was even sugar on the rim!) Service was fast and good (it was lunchtime on a Sunday) I knocked off one star because their portions are pretty big. If you're watching your weight, I suggest you not go here unless you order from their low calorie menu. I will return someday."
Al S.,"Sterling, VA",81,12,,1.0,3/24/2017,Don't go there to eat. They have a nice location but customer service is disaster.   Spend your money somewhere else.
Gwoping Y.,"Bethesda, MD",145,93,231,4.0,7/23/2016,"This cheesecake factory is my favorite one to go to as a, parent with a baby. It has a unique seating area that I'd good for families with strollers. Those is not typical.  The menus here also gave calorie information! Not all cheesecake factory locations have this. The food is consistent with what you expect from them. Decent quality with huge portions."
Samantha N.,"Rockville, MD",48,25,5,1.0,10/1/2016,"I'm so confused right now... sat down for a nice lunch, and an hour and a half later, I'm still waiting to receive food because the first dish (orange chicken) tasted like fried soap. The manager, whose name I don't know because he did not introduce himself when he weirdly came to our table, stared at us, and simply said ""I'm sorry,"" and walked away. What kind of manager is this? Huh? Who are you? Do you care about our experience? Do you want to make it better?  We won't be returning. Your service is absolutely horrid. Review updated: I just asked for the manager's name. His name is Amos and he needs to return to management training, ASAP. Your waitress (Sabrina)however was really nice, prompt, and attentive. Maybe she should be a manager? Your General Manager Liz, is absolutely wonderful and a breath of fresh air. She literally changed my mind about giving this place another try. Thanks for coming over and talking with us. On our way out, Amos looked at us and kept walking like nothing ever happened. Wow."
Angela W.,"Baltimore, MD",21,63,41,5.0,8/8/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory in general. From the portions size to the cool decor to the crazy amount of options, this place is my go-to for a casual lunch with a friend (especially, in this location, if I'm shopping).  I *highly* recommend the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" - it's so delicious and the sauce they use is unique from the usual alfredo and marinara sauces you usually find with pastas. It's made with a delicious wine reduction that makes my taste buds dance.  The crabcake sandwich is pretty delicious as well, though I'm not sure how much of it is actually crab meat and not filling - but I'm a lover of all crab cakes! The service can be pretty slow during the dinner rush, but my lunch experience today was excellent. The place opens for lunch at 11:30am and we got there at 12:15am - immediately seated and experienced decently prompt service. They are very accommodating of certain things you want modified with your meal, such as extra sauce or more thoroughly cooked pasta.  Overall, I love this place. I feel a bit guilty about how many calories I just ate when I'm leaving but hey, I always pack leftovers!  Tip: Make sure you ask for more bread to pack as well. I like the brown bread a lot more because it's sweeter, whereas the white bread tends to be dry."
Diamond L.,"Chesapeake Beach, MD",0,28,2,2.0,10/17/2017,Just left this location all I wanted was some pumpkin cheesecake. When I arrived it was a lady waiting in front of me then once the waiter was finished with this customer she asked a man standing to the right of me did he need anything he said he was waiting for take out she then proceeded to clean/fix the whipped cream machine that was not working. Finally after waiting another lady walked up and after she gave the customers their carryout items she helped me. after I paid she told me the cheesecake was frozen but would thaw out after about 20 minutes. If I would have known I was purchasing a frozen cheesecake I would not have brought it. 35 minutes later I am home and my cheese cake is icy in the middle. Guess I have to learn to make my own cheesecake now! SMFH... Never again all I came in for was the cheesecake.
Amanda I.,"Cabin John, MD",21,87,120,4.0,2/20/2016,"Recently I have just been getting desserts here! The service depends on the server, I come pretty late at night so they sometimes rush me. Some servers are really friendly, I had one that was more on the rude side.. My friend always gets coffee and it is always hot, which is obviously good.  I have gotten Linda's fudge cake, this is super moist and served with three dollops of whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate ganache frosting on top and layered in between, I do wish there was more between though. There is a thin layer of the ganache on the backside of the cake too and this part is covered in chocolate chips, which add a nice crunch. I would definitely recommend this cake to someone looking for chocolate cake here. My personal favorite dessert here so far is the Godiva fudge brownie sundae. This comes with 3 triangles of rich fudge like brownie, 2 scoops of ice cream with dollops of whipped cream on top, some fudge sauce and 2 chocolate squares. I love how big this dessert is! I do eat the whole thing by myself (I have a very big sweet tooth!) but it could definitely be shared with 2 or 3 people... probably more but I wouldn't share with more than one lol. I love that the brownie is so dense and fudgy and the vanilla ice cream goes so well with it, I am drooling now.... I got the pumpkin cheesecake. The texture was good and the crust was nice and crisp. There was a big dollop of whipped cream on top and on the plate that went well with the smooth cheesecake. My problem with this was the size, compared to the brownie sundae it is significantly smaller and I didn't feel satisfied after. But this is coming from a sweetaholic. The apple crumble is big topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping. The chicken when I got the salad was dry, so that was disappointing. There was a small amount of tomato, corn and beans in the salad (which I never thought I would use small describing a cheesecake factory dish!) And then on top of everything were these thin cut fried onions, there were a lot of the onions and they were really good, but I wish everything else had more too.  The Chinese chicken salad is pretty good. The dressing is delicious and I like the addition of the mandarin oranges and slivered almonds for some crunch. The salad has way too many of the crisp rice noodles that taste like Styrofoam. Other than the noodles I would say this is one of the better salads here. The tossed greens salad is actually good for being so simple. It is just lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sliced zucchini and sliced beets. You get to choose your dressing and we usually get the skinnylicious balsamic, which has a lot of flavor for being a skinny dressing. I like this simple salad as an accompaniment to an entrée.  The cheese pizza is one star- it tastes like one of those fake cheese pizzas from my childhood. The cheese is cheap tasting. The marinara is ok (we sometimes get charged $2 for an extra small side of marinara and sometimes don't). I would not recommend the cheese pizza here. However, the bbq chicken pizza is on point! This pizza has the right amount of bbq as the sauce and a good amount of cheese and chicken. While it is probably the same cheese they use on the original cheese pizza it must go better with the tangy bbq and chicken. I have gotten this a few times and would get it again! The crust is ok nothing special but it's decent."
Randy S.,"Bethesda, MD",0,6,2,1.0,10/13/2017,A complete disaster!!!  Went out to celebrate my parents visiting from Canada and got told it would be a 20 minute wait.  45 minutes later and after being skipped over numerous times on the seating chart.  We complained 4 times and finally got seated.  When I asked to speak to a manager she proceeded to tell me I was wrong and it cannot happen.  I just watched happen!!!!  Have been there many times but will not go back after this experience. No Custer service at all.
Rachel J.,"Germantown, MD",0,3,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Visited Cheesecake Factory numerous times, at numerous locations, however this was by far the worst.  We visited tonight and Javina was our sever. We were a party of 4. Our whole dining experience took 3 hours. Way too long.  She was very uninterested and super slow. Took our order then disappeared for a long time. Had to track her down for drink refills. Finally received our food an hour after ordering, with no apology from her or anyone. Our order was not correct.  We ordered cheesecake for dessert. She forgot to bring it. Another server delivered it to our table in a to-go container, although we asked for it to be for here.  Completely disappointed in the service here. Will not be visiting again. Wish we didn't waste 3 hours in this place."
Jennifer S.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,5,,3.0,6/18/2017,the food was alright it wasn't the usual craze as everyone had suggested but I think it was okay. The food was not that heavy but the portions were good. The food decor was pretty but you could see the oil that accumulated at the bottom of the dishes.
Edward R.,"Silver Spring, MD",9,5,4,1.0,3/26/2017,I wished I could of seen the Yelp reviews before I came to eat here service is the slowest I have ever seen I waited for a refill for 20mins waiter did come to check my table often is sad i decided to come here for my anniversary. Never again!
Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,219,49,5.0,9/15/2016,"Finally, CCF is hiring people with common courtesy and manners. Individuals who know what it means to be a waiter/waitress.  We were lucky enough to get Scott for our waiter and he was absolutely professional and attentive.  Our food, basil pasta and factory combo (chicken and steak) came out to my special requests and everything else was great.  I do hope that CCF keeps up with service."

The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping. The chicken when I got the salad was dry, so that was disappointing. There was a small amount of tomato, corn and beans in the salad (which I never thought I would use small describing a cheesecake factory dish!) And then on top of everything were these thin cut fried onions, there were a lot of the onions and they were really good, but I wish everything else had more too.  The Chinese chicken salad is pretty good. The dressing is delicious and I like the addition of the mandarin oranges and slivered almonds for some crunch. The salad has way too many of the crisp rice noodles that taste like Styrofoam. Other than the noodles I would say this is one of the better salads here. The tossed greens salad is actually good for being so simple. It is just lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sliced zucchini and sliced beets. You get to choose your dressing and we usually get the skinnylicious balsamic, which has a lot of flavor for being a skinny dressing. I like this simple salad as an accompaniment to an entrée.  The cheese pizza is one star- it tastes like one of those fake cheese pizzas from my childhood. The cheese is cheap tasting. The marinara is ok (we sometimes get charged $2 for an extra small side of marinara and sometimes don't). I would not recommend the cheese pizza here. However, the bbq chicken pizza is on point! This pizza has the right amount of bbq as the sauce and a good amount of cheese and chicken. While it is probably the same cheese they use on the original cheese pizza it must go better with the tangy bbq and chicken. I have gotten this a few times and would get it again! The crust is ok nothing special but it's decent."
Randy S.,"Bethesda, United States",0,6,2,1.0,13/10/2017,A complete disaster!!!  Went out to celebrate my parents visiting from Canada and got told it would be a 20 minute wait.  45 minutes later and after being skipped over numerous times on the seating chart.  We complained 4 times and finally got seated.  When I asked to speak to a manager she proceeded to tell me I was wrong and it cannot happen.  I just watched happen!!!!  Have been there many times but will not go back after this experience. No Custer service at all.
Rachel J.,"Germantown, United States",0,3,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Visited Cheesecake Factory numerous times, at numerous locations, however this was by far the worst.  We visited tonight and Javina was our sever. We were a party of 4. Our whole dining experience took 3 hours. Way too long.  She was very uninterested and super slow. Took our order then disappeared for a long time. Had to track her down for drink refills. Finally received our food an hour after ordering, with no apology from her or anyone. Our order was not correct.  We ordered cheesecake for dessert. She forgot to bring it. Another server delivered it to our table in a to-go container, although we asked for it to be for here.  Completely disappointed in the service here. Will not be visiting again. Wish we didn't waste 3 hours in this place."
Jennifer S.,"Silver Spring, United States",1,5,,3.0,18/6/2017,the food was alright it wasn't the usual craze as everyone had suggested but I think it was okay. The food was not that heavy but the portions were good. The food decor was pretty but you could see the oil that accumulated at the bottom of the dishes.
Edward R.,"Silver Spring, United States",9,5,4,1.0,26/3/2017,I wished I could of seen the Yelp reviews before I came to eat here service is the slowest I have ever seen I waited for a refill for 20mins waiter did come to check my table often is sad i decided to come here for my anniversary.

Karen S.,"Elk Grove, United States",0,219,49,5.0,15/9/2016,"Finally, CCF is hiring people with common courtesy and manners. Individuals who know what it means to be a waiter/waitress.  We were lucky enough to get Scott for our waiter and he was absolutely professional and attentive.  Our food, basil pasta and factory combo (chicken and steak) came out to my special requests and everything else was great.  I do hope that CCF keeps up with service."
