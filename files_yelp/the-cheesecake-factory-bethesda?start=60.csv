Marie B.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,3.0,9/23/2017,"Disappointed that they do not have the roasted artichoke appetizer available right now, I have had it in the past at the Tyson's location and they have never not had it in September, and it was one of the main reasons for choosing to get dinner here.  Anyways, we ordered carry out, and requested bread but did not receive any.  Didn't realize till we got home unfortunately.  In place of the artichoke I ordered guacamole and asked if I could have it made without cilantro and was told yes.  Ended up with PLAIN mashed avocado with tomatoes.  I wish I had been told everything else would be left out ...it wasn't worth the amount I paid for it.  Entrees were good as per usual, chicken piccata and bang bang chicken and shrimp are 2 of our go to entrees for Cheesecake Factory."
Bob B.,"Rockville, MD",14,77,3,1.0,3/24/2017,Worst service ever.  Shame on you CF for losing focus on customer service.  So many other places to eat here I wouldn't waste my time or money.  Last time I'm ever visiting this establishment.
Wing C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",217,1185,7515,4.0,11/25/2014,"One of the items my dad always buy from Costco is the boxed Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. He eats it fresh out of the box, straight from the freezer (yep frozen cheesecake), and sometimes even with his bare hand. He's one of the biggest cheesecake fanatics I know! Little did he know that it is branded after an actual restaurant. For one of our father/daughter dinner date, I knew I had to show him there's more to the world than plain cheesecake!  Before we dived right into desserts, we did have a proper, ginormous dinner -  mac and cheese burger and pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. For a chain restaurant, I'm very impressed by Cheesecake Factory! The burger/sandwich were well made (plus on quantity, plus on the quality too). The burger patty was juicy, the layer of fried mac and cheese was gooey and crunchy -  I wasn't surprised that my dad devoured the entire burger in one seating. My pulled pork sandwich - perfectly toasted bun, saucy delicious meat on top of meat, topped with their creamy Cole Slaw - forget trying to save room for dessert! And did I mention their sweet potato fries were fried perfectly? One of the best sweet potato fries I've had - straight from the fryer and yet not one bit greasy!  We wrapped our dinner date by sharing the perfect treat - Godiva chocolate cheesecake - 3 combined layers of perfection: brownie cake, chocolate mousse, and Godiva cheesecake. We polished the plate clean! With so many cheesecake options to choose from, my dad is now convinced to make a weekly outing to Cheesecake Factory to have one of each!"
Alexandra H.,"Washington, DC",6,13,,4.0,5/22/2017,The super antioxidant salad is just about the best experience I have had with kale. They have well priced lunch specials as well. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service was slow even though the restaurant was not very busy.
Gar T.,"Arlington, VA",294,147,183,3.0,12/23/2015,"I miss the white flint location. Although this is a chain restaurant, the restaurant is not as clean and the staff are not great. I love this chain -one of my favorites, but the service was disappointing. Our waiter kept disregarding us and seemed as if he wasn't interested in our table. The salads we ordered - the Greek, Caesar and chopped were delicious! I also had the rib eye and salmon which were decent. The mashed potatoes were good- nice and whipped. We also ordered tiramisu and regular cheesecake which of course never disappoints.  I've come here for happy hour and it is excellent. Appetizers and some drinks for just $5. My favorite appetizer is the sweet corn tamale cakes.  The burgers and fries are also tasty. The pasta never disappoints and the salads again are Fab! I wouldn't come here if I was craving a good steak though. They also offer pumpernickel and white bread with butter at the beginning of your meal."
Justine K.,"Rockville, MD",127,143,855,4.0,1/12/2015,"I agree with others that the space seems smaller. it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night even though it was already after 9:30pm. Although, i was told the wait was 15 minutes for two, we opted to sit at the high top tables in the bar area. I was reminded of my college days when Cheesecake was at White Flint. Back then the wait was over an hour and we would stalk the bar tables as well. Service was great. I forgot to take pictures but I really enjoyed the Mojito which came in a tall glass with just the right amount of sweetness. The Tex Mex egg rolls were much thinner than I remembered but still just as good."
Katharine S.,"Bethesda, MD",0,33,,1.0,2/15/2017,"This is the worst cheesecake restaurant of the many. The service was slow (two hours for lunch), the food too salty to eat, and the birthday desert (a cup of whip-cream) insulting. Lousy everything!!!"
Lorie B.,"Durham, NC",8,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I oredered through a delivery service.  With the delivery charge the order of a salmon kale salad and low carb cheesecake came to over $34.  The salad was substandard, with a small piece of salmon and a bunch of kale with two slices of radish, a couple of small pieces of avocado and two dried cranberries. If I had been in the restaurant I would have sent it back and complained to the manager.  As it was a delivery, I didn't get the chance.  I definitely will not be ordering from them again."
Sely-Ann H.,"Germantown, MD",0,4,2,2.0,3/29/2017,Had miso Salmon and Spicy chicken pasta. Both were ok. Our waiter was in a rush and not very friendly. They also ran out of the bread I wanted ...  We got the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake
Ronalyn D.,"Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands",0,20,9,3.0,3/28/2017,"Tuna Tataki was good and quite filling, I ordered it because of the small calorie count. Since I don't like peppery foods I requested no wasabi. The ginger garnish was quite good, they didn't have a mocha cappuccino so I got the mocha latte, it was okay. Tried the appetizer salmon fire sticks it was great, I enjoyed them. I was to full for dessert so I didn't have any."
Steve P.,"Germantown, MD",0,55,70,3.0,3/25/2017,"Food (appetizers and entree) were nothing of significance to note. Anticipated a higher quality atmosphere like other Cheesecake Factories; however, perhaps the location of this one plus the time in which we are (lunch time) may have caused me some discourse...we were not frequently visited by our waitress(es). The prize display of all the cheesecakes looked like a picked through consignment shop with several of the cakes having one piece left that were rough looking. Nonetheless the two pieces of cake I did take home were extremely delicious keeping with the tradition of good cheesecakes. I'd revisit this Cheesecake Factory if I find myself in the area again."
Joe O.,"Silver Spring, MD",69,7,,1.0,1/17/2017,I had come to the Cheesecake Factory for my friends birthday but weren't able to be seated at all. The host had told us it would be a 30 min wait so we waited and we seen that everyone else was getting seated but us. I had checked with the host again and asked how much longer and again she said another 20 soooo we were at 50 min waiting to be seated and still we weren't helped. This place has the worst service ever. We ended up going to the California pizza kitchen and they took us in fast and even let us stay longer after they closed .
Robin G.,"Bethesda, MD",88,434,218,5.0,6/4/2016,"Pretty much they always have good food!! They give you generous portions for the price. The service is ok considering you usually have a fairly large crowd. The cheesecake is and always has been amazing. Yes it's like 2000 calories a spoonful but hey, ya gotta treat yourself sometimes, right?"
Nomin D.,"Springfield, VA",131,740,806,5.0,2/2/2015,This is an awesome addition at montgomery mall.  Restaurant itself is spacious and staff is usually friendly. Food options are as expected and comes out food.  I've been here several times and had good experience with all of them!
Jinki Y.,"Frederick, MD",4,73,54,5.0,10/10/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory! What's not to like about this place?? You'd be crazy not to love this restaurant.... Took my husband here for the very first time since he LOVES cheesecake. He absolutely was not disappointed! The portions were great, the menu had plenty to choose from such as different sea foods, pastas, steaks, burgers and salads. The kids menu was also had a wide variety.. The atmosphere was beautiful (the dimmed lights brough a warm feeling to it!). The customer service was excellent and fast, and the cheesecake... Well... Probably the best there is!  My husband and I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake after our meal and shared it with my son. They have other fresh cheesecakes that you get to buy, by slice or by full.  All in all, we need a Cheesecake Factory here in Frederick hands down!!! Totally worth the cheat meal day! ;)"
Eddie K.,"Rockville, MD",171,420,1978,4.0,7/11/2014,"Happy it relocated to Montgomery Mall from White Flint.  The space is a lot smaller here, but they tried to compensate by adding a lot of ""outside"" tables - just looking at the Old Navy really.   Been here many times already and the food and service has been pretty good.   Glad they have their calories listed in the menu.  On the days I want to eat healthy, I order from the Skinnylicious menu.  The soft tacos are very good and filling and under 600 calories.     On the regular menu, can't go wrong with the garlic pasta with chicken.  I also like their club sandwich, cobb salad and shepard's pie.   During lunch they have smaller portions along with lower prices compared to the full meals. Don't miss out on their happy hour specials and of course their cheesecakes!"
Aakash S.,"Rockville, MD",16,215,94,1.0,7/9/2016,"Decided to come here for dinner with my parents and my brother. Arrived at 5:40 and were seated immediately. Our server came by around 5:45 and I told her we were ready to order.. She asked us what we wanted to drink and she walked away and came back with our water. Then she immediately took off and was nowhere to be found for 15 minutes. At 6pm, we flagged down a manager who took our order. I told him it had already been 15-20 minutes and I didn't feel like waiting forever for my food due to the wait. After all.. I came prepared.  The food came out at 6:12 and that's when our server reappeared out of thin air. We asked her for more brown bread and she said ok. We waited till about 6:23 and then reminded her we asked for more bread. Also asked for ketchup and butter this time because who knows if it'll arrive. I know things move fast when we engage the manager as I explained earlier. She looked at us like this was the first time she heard it even though she clearly acknowledged it at 6:12pm and said ""oh sure, I can bring more bread"" with a blank stare. Bread came out around 6:35 with the butter and ketchup.. 23 minutes after our initial request.  Looking around baffled at the service we were getting from her, compared to the 2 tables around us where she was treating them like gods... We were very disappointed. One could consider this discrimination as we were the only non-Caucasian table she was servicing (from what I could see).  Anyways, it was hard to tip when we paid the check. Sadly we gave up 11% because her tip obviously gets split among others. If she was the only one to get a tip, 0% would be a very high tip in my opinion... There's a Cheesecake Factory in Chevy chase that treats their customers right. Don't come here, take a 10 minute drive easy."
David B.,"Bethesda, MD",32,1,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Now, we expected a long wait it being a Saturday, and we were told it would be around forty-five minutes. We waited for nearly two hours only to receive the information we had waited only waited for a half hour. Absolutely incredible. No, we waited outside of the restaurant for about a half hour. Not only that lie, but we also received the information that there were three groups ahead of us at the time we arrived at the restaurant. As time went on somehow groups accumulated in front of us. After we had been waiting for an hour there were now five groups in front of us. We had the beeper to tell us when it was time. How do u mess that up. Incredible."
Rachel R.,"Washington, DC",0,14,,1.0,12/29/2016,"Avoid this place.  Recently went to CF with some friends on a weeknight.  Hostess said it was a 30 minute wait.  By the time we got to our tables, 55 minutes elapsed.  Parties that arrived later, larger and smaller than ours, were seated before us.  Total chaos.  Service was bad.  Restaurant wasn't that crowded, yet we had to wait double the quoted time to eat; and from sit to check, it was then nearly two more hours!  Most of which was spent waiting: to order; for our food; or for our check.   Drink menu didn't have printed prices?  That's shady.  I've never seen that anywhere.  Server only gave me a range of drink prices, ""$11-13"".  Ok?  Not exactly helpful.  Drinks themselves were super sugary, and really low on alcohol.  For $12.50, I expected more.  Appetizer nachos were mediocre.  Cheese tasted strange (more on that later), and the guac was barley enough for 5 nacho chips.  Our entrees weren't timed properly, and while they were huge (typical of CF), they just tasted bad.  By the time we got our check, we didn't even bother with the cheesecake.   All members of our party, within hours of leaving CF experienced similar intestinal distress (i.e., we got sick).  Sure every once in a while someone eats something that doesn't agree with their stomachs, but 100% of the group getting sick.  Not worth it When CF was at White Flint, it was OK, but there are enough options in and around the area, it should be easy to avoid CF."
