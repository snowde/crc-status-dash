Karen Y.,"Silver Spring, MD",12,74,29,3.0,1/5/2016,"Be wary when you make reservations here; they may or not have it. And also you can't get seated until 80% of your party comes if you have a reservation. Which is understandable but kind of awkward standing around lmao since people are usually late. Our waitress was really nice and provided excellent service; no idea why Yelp has so many negative reviews on the service when I thought it was fine. The food was large-portioned and tasted fine. It's not like super super amazing, but it's pretty good albeit the price tag that comes along with it.  Also, bring flashlights because that place is dark. (just kidding, please don't actually do this) When we sat down the lighting was fine but literally 10 minutes later it got significantly darker. Anyways it was a normal experience."
Maya R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,5,,2.0,4/9/2016,"Food is always great, but one person in the front booth would not talk to people and had a bit of an attitude. The other woman in the booth was lively and talked to everyone. The woman who dealt with us told us there was a 15-minute wait, but we waited closer to 30. When our buzzer went off and we gave it to her, she said, ""Can you give me a minute?"" and made us wait extra time just because she didn't feel like dealing with us. When we were seated, our waiter did not get our drink orders for a long time. He was nice and apologized about it, but the wait was outrageous. When we got our drinks, the glasses had lipstick on them. The waiter brought food for every table except ours for a very long time.  Overall, good food but the service could be much better."
John N.,"Germantown, MD",0,5,2,3.0,2/4/2017,Date night foiled by my ribeye coming out cold. My wife had to eat without me. At least there was beer and Johnny black. Our bartender Michelle is awesome and doing all to make it a great date night. Thank you Michelle.
Mackenzie K.,"Alexandria, VA",456,282,583,3.0,8/27/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and everything it offers. Great drinks, huge amounts of food and lively atmosphere. Yes, I would consider it ""fast food"" it's a CHAIN people. For the money you receive a pleasant amount of food, yes the cheesecake is over priced- but of course it is! It's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY"
Jamie M.,"Montgomery Village, MD",5,41,8,1.0,7/3/2017,"We used to love going to this Cheesecake factory, but not anymore after this. My family and I went here before going to a movie. We were surprised since there was no wait around lunch time, this should have been a warning sign. We were seated quickly and left with menus. After about 10 minutes a waiter showed up and took our drink orders. We then waited another 10 minutes for our drink orders, and when they were delivered we told the waiter we were ready to order. He told us he would be right back. After giving our orders, he tells us that the bread isn't ready yet, and he will bring some out when it comes out. After about 20 minutes we see other servers carrying bread to tables. We look for our waiter but he seems to have disappeared. We finally see him bringing food to the table behind us whom arrived after us. We flag him down, and he tells us about how they ordered salads and that takes less time. I told him I thought 40 minutes was a long time to wait for a cheeseburgers and salmon. He then brings out the bread and our food. My salmon was overcooked and cold. My husband's burger was also overcooked. My daughter's salmon was perfect. My mother-in-law's burger was not right. Instead of flagging down the waiter, who had shown us he didn't care, we ate what we could, paid and went to our movie."
Kelechi N.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",5,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory, but this location has to be the WORST. I ordered a Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and a Chicken Chipotle Pasta to go. I made sure I informed the cashier that I have an onion allergy, hence why I ordered the pasta without onions and peppers. The cashier said my order would take 15min. It actually took 30min. When I did get my food, I could see almost immediately that there was an onion in my pasta. I took the food out of the bag and showed the cashier. The cashier called the manager and the manager said no that's not onion, it's cilantro. Then I said no, it's an onion (pointing to the obvious onion in the dish). Manager then proceeds to say no, that's asparagus. I then take the plastic fork from the Cheesecake bag and pick up the onion. The manager asks if I wanted another one. I say no because there is a clear case of cross contamination at this location. If someone says that they are allergic to something, every effort in the kitchen should be made to make sure the food is free from said allergen. The manager gave me my money back stating that the entire purchase would be refunded to my card. The manager leaves and then the cashier hands me another receipt for $8 and some change. I asked what this was for. She says it's for the Cheesecake. I said no, your boss said my ENTIRE purchase would be refunded. Why should there now be a balance that clearly exceeds the original tab of $22.23? They wanted me to pay for the Cheesecake but give my the entire refund? The hell?? Makes no sense. Manager came back and credited me again for the mishap. I will NEVER ago to this location again. I have had wayyy too many problems every time I visit. NO THANKS BETHESDA CHEESECAKE!!!"
Robyn C.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",4,2,,1.0,5/29/2017,"The service was terrible. The waitress brought the entire meal( appetizer, soup, and main course) at the same time. When we complained she argued with us and the manager supported her. Our meal was ruined and we will never go back."
Jessica L.,"Rockville, MD",168,209,841,3.0,4/18/2015,"Portions are always huge here and I love the lunch specials but why do I always get the ""new"" server and why are they always out of bread when I'm there and why oh why do they always force me to sit in the bar area when there are plenty of seats open in the dining room? Once a week my husband and I have date day. He usually wants to go here. The food is great but it would be nice just once to not be forced to sit in the bar.  We've asked to sit in the dining room. We get there right when they open. But it seems they have a server rotation they will NOT budge from.  He works 6 days a week. It's our one day to have a nice lunch and every time we are sat in the bar.  That being said, the salmon lunch special is great. Juicy salmon cooked to perfection. Hubby likes it with mashed potatoes and carrots.  The meatloaf is a HUGE portion even on the lunch size and is better than my mom makes (sorry momma).  Lately I've been getting the Cobb salad no bacon and cannot finish the lunch size. Last week when I was almost finished I bit into a big chunk of pork (bacon). I cannot eat pig for religious reasons and was very upset that it seemed they caught their mistake and picked most of the bacon out. But not all.  Also ordered a Caesar salad no cheese no chicken to go for my vegetarian daughter yet when I got it home it had chicken and cheese. My fault. I should have checked before I left.  Love their signature tea.  Love the portion sizes and lunch specials but for the love of G-d , just once could we sit in the dining room and have some yummy sour dough bread when we come in at opening? Please and thank you.  Ps the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is divine. The Reese's cheesecake is waaaaaay tooooo sweet. But get some of you may love it.  Next time I come please don't force me to dine in the bar and maybe not be out of bread by 11:30 am."
Niloo N.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,2,,1.0,7/25/2017,"The most rude and obnoxious staff at this location. Including the manager!  I went there with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. They gave us the pager and said we should be seated within 10 minutes. Once the pager went off we walked up to the hostess who seemed frazzled. They proceeded to seat 3 or 4 groups while we were standing there waiting to be acknowledged. None of those groups were there when we first arrived. We asked couple times if they were going to seat us and the very rude hostess kept saying I'll take you to your table shortly then proceeded to seat other parties!  The manager came by and I asked what seems to be the problem. He said your table was given to someone else by mistake. I said well that's all they had to say in the first place instead of rudely dismissing us!  At some point after that we just walked out. I see that this location has 3 stars, but that is way too generous!  I will never set foot in this place again!  As a matter of fact I'm going to call Cheesecake Factory's district office and let them know that they need to review the staff's performance and teach them some customer service skills."
Ebie B.,"Chevy Chase, MD",170,86,2,2.0,2/16/2016,"Cheesecake Factory- where everyone is confused, all the time, always. I honestly think they use the shock value of huge portions to distract you from mediocre food punctuated by the mostly wtf service. But a huge plate of greasy fish is still greasy fish. Most recently I went here to pick up a to-go order on Sunday. Yes it was Valentines Day, but I have never experienced a more chaotic mixture of overwhelmed staff, poor planning and horrible time management, even on New Years Eve. There were many tables open that the staff seemed unaware of and I heard a lot of complaining from patrons about the wait.  So I go to pick up my order. There is a huge line. It is slowly merging with another line. No one seems to know where either of these lines lead. I didn't know if I was waiting in a line to pick up food or get a table. Neither did the people in front of me. Finally a staff member assured me I was in the correct line and that although the line was long, they had 2 registers open so it should be moving quickly. Lies. They DID have both open but only 1 was in use. The other served as a prop for one of the employees to stand in front of, doing nothing. In the entire 17 decades I was in line for, I saw her pick up 1 paper bag, put it in the fridge and then continue to stand there. The same line is for people placing an order as it is for picking one up, which makes no sense. I finally get my food. It ranged from lukewarm and greasy to just plain cold. Some of the fish was almost inedible. $20 wasted. Thanks guys.  The restaurant itself looks very nice. It's kind of small and very cramped inside. Outside there is a nice little roped off area inside the mall with stellar views of the Foot Reflexology place. They have made the best use possible of the space outside, and it really looks quite nice. However I'm not inclined to go back anytime soon. A hugely frustrating experience capped off by cold food and ineffective staff does not scream ""quality dining""."
Scott L.,"Buffalo, NY",56,190,291,4.0,6/7/2016,"My friend pick the place, it is located in the mall, and they have the valet parking in the front.  I have been to Cheesecake Factory many times in Chicago and Buffalo, this store is no different than others. Food is good, cheese cake is great. I had ribeye, and tiramisu as my dessert, which get me all filled up.  Service is adequate. They do have a seating area next to the hallway, which could be nice as inside sometimes could be noisy."

Arthita G.,"Hyattsville, MD",199,161,365,4.0,6/27/2014,"The portions are huge! Literally HUGE! We went there as a big group of nearly 20 people and they could accommodate us all comfortably.  I ordered mexican tortilla salad from the skinnylicious menu, frozen iced mango smoothie and godiva chocolate cheesecake. The salad was quite nice. Smoothie - not bad although I couldn't finish it. The cheesecake was good but it tasted too much of chocolate and very little of cheese. My suggestion is to order tiramisu cheesecake instead. It tastes better. The place was nicely decorated and I had a good experience with the service too."
Kevin D.,"Rockville, MD",9,116,231,4.0,5/22/2015,"I visited (4/28/15) ordered Southern Catfish Dinner w/mashed potatoes, corn & string beans. Meal arrived @table piping hot! The catfish fresh flavor, fish costing is crispy lightly seasoned. The corn & beans crisp fresh taste, chunky style mashed potatoes. Delicious meal. Great service."
William P.,"Bethesda, MD",40,15,,2.0,6/4/2017,"I normally like Cheesecake Factory. My usual order is the Ribeye which has been pretty good. This time around I decided to try the California Cheesesteak. This was a HUGE mistake.  It may as well have been called a Cheesefat since there was more fat than steak in the sandwich. It was just bread, fat, cheese and veggies. Perhaps it's bc it was Uber eats and they figured the quality could be crap since I couldn't call the manager over.  So I decided to add this yelp review instead. If you ever have the urge to order the Cheesesteak, think again and relook at the menu."
Patrick M.,"Potomac, MD",0,10,,5.0,6/28/2017,I just went there for my birthday my server was very kind gave her a 20% tip for doing a god job and if you are shopping at old navy witch is right down the hall from it if your shopping for close and want to get something easy go there
Ronald P.,"Silver Spring, MD",84,4,5,2.0,11/27/2016,"Not the best experience... food took almost 40 minutes to arrive , server didn't even ask if everything was fine or if we needed anything else after food was served , food it was okay , the chicken teriyaki was very plain , chicken and shrimp Cajun it was ehh barely had like 3-4 shrimps .. not my first choice next time I want to go out to eat ..."
Kristene S.,"Washington, DC",34,4,,1.0,7/22/2016,This location needs to be closed. Most people go to cheesecake factory for the huge portions as well as selection. This location gives bland food and kid sized portions. I used to be able to eat my left overs for 3 separate meals. I don't know what's going on. Cheesecake used to be my favorite restaurant but I will never go here again.
Sarah C.,"Bethesda, MD",163,385,2172,3.0,1/12/2014,"5 stars for our server I liked her a lot (mimicking Lloyd Christmas) And if you know who he is, you're cool~ Right amount of personability and sense of humor (hi) Westfield Montgomery Mall is Cheesecake's new home Offering their customary valet parking Sunday brunch with the better half Before the playoffs - didn't want to stray too far He wanted something sweet yet still breakfasty/brunchy   Goodness.....Elvis style Belgian waffles??? 4realz? K. He's jogging later so no harm no foul  Everything you can imagine the King would eat in one sitting Displays before you on a plate Even our server agreed this was plenty Apparently some returned the dish due to the overmuch He enjoyed it and left about 2 slices The boy has a fondness for peanut butter My Eggs Benedict had the usual Canadian bacon with H sauce Plus with the option of spinach and tomatoes Yes I said to those But the poor potatoes - they're still learning I guess Baby it's cold outside so their hot tea was necessary The Art of Tea Noa blend (black tea) paired well  It's a habit not to add anything in my hot tea Especially when coupling with a meal This new address will be bustling when the weather improves"

He's jogging later so no harm no foul  Everything you can imagine the King would eat in one sitting Displays before you on a plate Even our server agreed this was plenty Apparently some returned the dish due to the overmuch He enjoyed it and left about 2 slices The boy has a fondness for peanut butter My Eggs Benedict had the usual Canadian bacon with H sauce Plus with the option of spinach and tomatoes Yes I said to those But the poor potatoes - they're still learning I guess Baby it's cold outside so their hot tea was necessary The Art of Tea Noa blend (black tea) paired well  It's a habit not to add anything in my hot tea Especially when coupling with a meal This new address will be bustling when the weather improves"
