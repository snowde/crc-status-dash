Jeni H.,"Calabasas, CA",816,322,532,5.0,12/1/2017,"We had great customer service here, and we were surprised that it wasn't that loud, even in the ""family dining"" area.  I always appreciate the expanded Cheesecake factory menu and the staff are so well trained.  We had a very pleasant and efficient server who was great with our 3 year old.  Our neighboring table had a very aggressive and rude father, and our waiter handled himself like a champ, so we were impressed.  I love the patio here too.  Fun for people watching and surprisingly comfortable.  Parking can be a pain but that is to be expected in this area of Beverly hills, and the wait for seating... was outrageous.  Again though, to be expected.  If you want easy parking and no-line-seating, go to Calabasas!  :)"
Fifi P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,1.0,12/31/2017,"We came for the Romano crusted chicken breast, left for the bizarrely incompetent hosting staff. Instead of directing my family to wait outside, our hostess conducted a plaintive discussion with her coworkers about how it made her look bad that we were standing inside. I had no idea we'd done the wrong thing, and a simple ""Sorry, we need to keep this area clear, please wait on the sidewalk"" would have sufficed. We weren't there to spite her; we had a five minute wait and thought we were supposed to stay close. I get it; hostessing is hard (it is, I've done it). Maybe she has hungry, grouchy jerks coming in all day long (we weren't those people). Maybe working at a chain restaurant in Beverly Hills makes her feel small, and she wanted to make someone else feel small, too (mission accomplished). Maybe she thought we were dumb tourists, or that we lacked a thorough grasp of loudly broadcasted, passive-aggressive English. Maybe she was just bad at her job. I don't know, and we didn't stick around to find out. At the conclusion of their bitch sesh, another hostess led us to a table in the middle of a room with empty booths and we waited a polite two minutes before leaving. Sorry, Server - you can thank Friday's 5pm shift for that one. Stay classy Beverly Hills Cheesecake Factory hostesses."
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,1.0,11/13/2017,"Be warned! It's like they picked up this Cheesecake Factory from the dump and dropped it in the heart of Beverly Hills. People should be upset and rioting in the streets over this!!! It does not belong in the 90210. First off, it's a very small location, terrible parking in the area, and gross inside. It was about a 15-20 minute wait, normal for any of their locations. I tried ordering the Eggplant Parm, and was told they were out. I've NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory and been told they're out of the eggplant. WTF! Then I ordered a pasta dish and was completely disappointed with it. Our food took super long to arrive. We ordered our dinner at the same time as the table next to us, but got our food about 20-30 minutes after! I won't hold the server responsible for this because, it's not his fault. Has to be the management.  I had just spent 4 days in the field, with very little rest and proper food. Super annoying when you go to a chain restaurant and expect consistency, but it's nowhere to be found. The slippery floors near their kitchen should be addressed immediately. It's very slippery to walk on, and you'll find your chair sliding around when seated. No joke....it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. I was in such a bad mood, I couldn't wait to get out of there."
Flora H.,"West Hollywood, CA",3711,1174,1760,3.0,11/9/2017,"*** 3.5 Stars *** You get exactly what you expect at The Cheesecake Factory, and this is true for all locations including this one: The menu is huge - they don't do anything particularly well, but do everything decently well, so there is something for everyone and no one will be disappointed. It's not exactly cheap, but the portions are large, so it's a fair value. The cheesecake IS great, and there are more flavors than you can imagine, all of which are good. NOTE: They now have a skinny menu, with items less than 500/600 calories for the entire serving, and cocktails that are less than 150 calories, something I appreciate since I always feel gluttonous when I eat at a Cheesecake Factory. Not something to go out of your way for as there is nothing ""special"" about it, but a decent choice for a casual meet up with a group."
TJ W.,"Venice, CA",30,261,112,5.0,10/15/2017,Eric is a great bartender! Created a sparkling good day for us one recent happy hour. I wish they had a ear corn chowder though. ... Great food and great prices. Appreciate the miltary discount! Have a great day!!!! Kevin was an awesome bartender! He has skills! He's been here a while and we appreciate him.
Tanishia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,186,917,3.0,11/1/2017,Ok after all the walking at the Car Show Time to eat. They have outside and inside seating. We were seated and had to ask for bread. A large family came and were all over us so we asked to be moved. Now that we had our own space everything worked out well. Food was ok bf didn't like his as much.
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,4.0,7/7/2017,"Came in for a late lunch with sister, I think this is probably the smallest Cheesecake Factory location we have ever seen, the table for two was so tiny that it was barely enough for two tiny Asian women. The tourist dining people next to me almost put his backpack on me, but it's Beverly Hills that space is very precious and expensive so I understand why the super cramped seatings.  It was a very warm day so we decided to do something refreshing and light. Bourbon and Honey cocktail for me, strawberry lemonade for sister, we shared crab cake bites and Greek salad as apps, Tuscan chicken from skinnylicious and chicken & shrimp in Thai curry with white rice for entrees. As usual, food portions were huge and the flavors were rich that we enjoyed all the dishes. We finished our meal with toasted marshmallow S'mores cheesecake, cappuccino and Grey Goose espresso martini, they were very tasty.  Our server was very attentive and friendly considering how busy it was, we have always liked The Cheesecake Factory, this location didn't disappoint either. Keep in mind that this is a very affordable place to grab a bite when you are in this neighborhood. Ps. Street meter parkings or public parking structures across the street, first two hours free."
Arman J.,"San Francisco, CA",599,90,347,4.0,6/2/2017,"It's the cheesecake factory! I don't understand why people give it a low scores or expect it to be a out of this world. I was in LA for a conference and I met my parents here for dinner.  We got seated right away, and the staff were super nice.  As always, waters were brought out right away followed by the delicious, straight out of the oven loafs of bread with some butter (it's the break and butter of their business and my favorite lol) FOOD: Appetizers - do yourselves the favor and hook yourselves up with the Thai lettuce wraps. It's enough for 3-4 people to nibble on prior to dinner and the variation of the sauces, lettuce, and cabbage leaves in addition to the perfectly grilled chicken is wonderful. I am a huge fan of their skinnylicious menu. It is my dream to be skinny, so I try to eat skinny, but then sometimes I order a cheesecake afterwards and.... Tomorrow is a new day. lol.  Love their Tacos from that menu, and the asian chicken salad is also awesome. I don't know how it's 590 calories, but man it fills you up. Cheesecake Don't do it, you don't need the calories. Go for a run instead."
Nina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,181,306,2.0,9/10/2017,"The food was excellent!! Came in with a few friends and ordered a bunch of food. From the beginning to the end our waiter Kevin, A was in the WORST MOOD. He was annoyed"
Emily P.,"Lafayette, CO",92,106,323,4.0,6/17/2017,"First of all - we sat at the bar and the bartender could not have been any awesome-r.  He charged my cell phone, replaced my Diet Coke right as I was slurping down the last drop of the previous glass (hot day of traveling = 4 diet cokes), made recommendations for our protein burgers, and did all this with a fairly busy bar. I requested a glass of ice for my Chardonnay and our drinks were in front of us in less than a minute. (I know ice in wine is gauche but I like my wine super chilled). So the food was ""the Cheesecake Factory"" and we went there because we already knew the menu and knew they'd be fairly fast. The food was exactly what we wanted - the bartender should be a trainer for customer service in the food service industry. I hope the Cheesecake Factory recognized they have a stellar employee! Thank you!"
Michael T.,"Studio City, CA",1,16,4,1.0,12/27/2017,"The worst customer service EVER for delivery drivers. I came to this place probably 45 times in the past 3 months i have never been satidfied with their customer srvice. They have a bad attitide for delivery drivers. I eill never come back to this place. You all are rude. Shame on you! It took her 35 minutes just to ralk to me. No politeness, extremely rude and she looks angry. Bte bye."
Christina C.,"Glendale, CA",214,191,662,3.0,8/21/2017,Well I'm not big fan of Cheesecake Factory but this place looks really tiny and tables so close to each other. I took Burger which comes with home salad that was bitter and sour same time. Service is ok there but takes time....
Jamie B.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,1,3.0,12/30/2017,This place stays open late. If u order to go beware.  Your order is guaranteed to be missing something.  Dining in is just ok.  Guaranteed good service.  They are always out of the artichoke during dinner.   Good selection of food.  The menu is huge
Ser B.,"Burbank, CA",21,19,42,4.0,12/10/2017,"I have been here several times before, and it took me a while to get familiar with the menu as a Vegan. My first time, I had the Cobb salad which is raw amazing food that everyone can enjoy but, I feel like it's more of a huge appetizer or a finger food that everyone can eat. As I got more comfortable, I decided to get something hot and big plate category; Evelyn's Favorite Pasta(hold the Parmesan and ask to be tossed in olive oil instead of butter). This pasta is amazing! I would never ever ever compare it to a real pasta ""ITALIAN"" but, it comes a little close to desired Italian pasta. The waiters are always kind and informative... though I have to say, the wait time to be served is a little bit on the longer side than usual. Overall, I like how you can go to Cheesecake Factory and welcome yourself with their menu. They offer so many options like, Soy-Glazed Edamame, Vegan Cobb Salad, Veggie Burger(Ask for sourdough or wheat bread and replace cheese and mayo with avocado), Kale and Quinoa Salad(hold the Parmesan), Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and Falafel Salad(Skip the feta and choose vinaigrettes: lemon-blueberry, pomegranate, or shallot that are vegan) Overall, the experience here is good and I could see myself being a regular here."
Linda C.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,59,159,1.0,12/18/2016,"Gave it a second chance but things just got worse. I dined in couple days ago for a quick lunch and once again, the plate on my table was dirty. AGAIN!? Obviously they didnt fire the dishwasher yet.  After many dirty dish incidents at this location, i wanted to just togo my order. I came in and ordered a salad for togo. The girl said it will take about 10mins. Waited 10, still nothing. I was standing in the middle of the restaurant waiting for my togo order while the servers were passing by. I felt like i was in the way of everyone and felt really uncomfortable. Why isnt there a waiting area for togo orders? So i went down the street to get a coffee from starbucks. After 20min, stilllll nothing. I was so annoyed how slow the service was. It was just a salad! How long does it take to make a salad!? I got my salad about 30min later after the girl constantly bothered the kitchen. I was rushed to get back to work and barely had any time to eat my lunch due to the delay. I wanted to take couple bites for 5mins, when i opened the bag, i was greeted by messy salad dressing. It was really bizarre to find a piece of cooked noodle strand inside my salad dressing. It was almost like it was used before, or the chef dropped a soup on top of it as an accident. After this incident, i think its safe to say this location is by far the worst cheesecake factory ive ever been to."
Matt H.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,272,15,1.0,6/16/2017,"I like Cheesecake Factory. Just not this one (anymore).  The entry is a choke point straight out of an insurgent terrorist's wet dream. There's no sensible way in our out without hip-checking people into walls. Hard. And today I watched someone piloting a double-wide stroller run over a dog's foot. Twice. (Bonus puzzle: Why was there a dog inside?) We got seated at an outdoor table, which was perfect at 6:30pm. The food, as it always is, was good. But it was so hard to get it!  I ordered the Vietnamese fresh rolls (the rice-paper-wrapped things with veggies and shrimp in them), which couldn't come without onions because they're already pre-made. Same with the avocado spring rolls. I get it; that's okay. The standardization in their menu is honestly part of what makes CF so reliably good.  We didn't get bread when we sat down, so we asked for it. It took a little while to get our drink orders taken, and when the drinks arrived, we asked for bread again. After five more minutes, we flagged someone down and asked for bread again. When the waiter came to take our order, he mentioned that bread was on the way. He took our order and bread arrived a minute later. In the time it took to bring our basket to the table, they ran out of brown bread; the table behind us couldn't have any until they brought them a basket...with dessert.  After our food had taken about 20 minutes to come out, I asked our waiter for an update. He said he'd check. Five minutes later, he brought all the food but the fresh rolls. I asked how a pre-made item could be delayed, and he said it was because too many people had ordered...salads? They came out about five minutes later and were delicious of course--but what the heck is going on at this location? I had to ask twice for a water refill. Then my glass sat empty for the second half of our meal.  We were sitting with empty plates for so long that I had to get up to go ask our waiter for the check. He brought it and I just handed him a large bill so that we wouldn't have to wait an hour for him to come back to get the money and then another hour for him to give us change.  Because it was basically a game at this point, I actually timed how long it took him to come back with change. I tried to hold out for 15 minutes, but after 13, I went inside AGAIN to get my change. I saw him counting bills at the register so I came back out to our table.  Two minutes later--we made 15 after all!--he arrived with the change. At least it was counted correctly.  Whatever management was running either that shift (6/15/17, dinner) or this entire location needs immediate remedial training from CF corporate. I can't see myself coming back to this location, and I'm pretty soured on CF more generally. What a bummer."
Tea P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,2.0,8/28/2017,"Truly, truly disappointed!!! Me and my husband go to the CCF at least 3 times a month. We made a mistake and came to the one in Beverly Hills (near our home) and we normally go to the one at the Grove.  I figured for a week night dinner it would be cool... BUT... We ordered the roasted artichoke (fav appetizer) DO NOT ORDER  they totally changed the recipe to NO SEASONING!!!  My husband ordered the rib eye and it was small and flat... but he seasoning was on point!  I ordered the shrimp scampi: apparently they have a completely different recipe for that too!  The waiter was nice, didn't get his name because I don't think he told us.  We always have high expectations for CCF. You would think going to Beverly Hills you would have an exquisite experience but not this time...  We probably won't go back to this particular location...  And I could understand if this was a sat or a pepper shaker..."
Mariana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,10,5.0,12/17/2017,"Living in LA for almost 7 years now I have gone to almost all Cheesecake factories, but surprisingly not this one, the closest to my house. The ladies that sat us were really nice, we asked to chance tables and they were awesome about it. I had a chicken Bellagio today, it is one of my favorite specialty pasta. Too bad I just remembered the picture after I have already ate half of my plate. So I decided not taking it, next time I go I take it. Love how the  Cheesecake Factory plates taste the same in all restaurants.  Summing up, good service and awesome food."
Alla P.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",28,2,,1.0,9/2/2017,3 days ago i came for lunch to this place. Waited for the Ceasar salad for 30 min and then got it with raw chicken.  Really raw! red with blood and the one you cannot chew.  I even tried to eat it a little bit.. and paid with a stomachache for that. Definitely don't recommend getting chicken there.
Bryan D.,"Northside, Houston, TX",20,2,,1.0,8/26/2017,"The cheesecake is always pretty good (as in, if you don't like it, it's a result of personal preference and not quality) but the food was absolutely terrible. In my experience, CF food is only upper end of mediocre anyway, but this was my worst experience. I got the fillet and it tasted like it was marinated in water and rinsed before cooking. The green beans tasted just as bad. Imagine taking a bite of a big, thick, steak and just tasting water. I took 3 bites out of a huge steak, ate 2 green beans, and 1 bite of mashed potatoes and put the plate on the corner of the table and shared my gf's plate - which was much more the ""upper end of mediocre"" described earlier. CF is becoming the Olive Garden of... well, they don't really have a specific style, but it's not good.  Our server was very nice and helpful but it kinda bothers me she saw an entire plate almost untouched on the corner of the table and didn't bother asking if anything was wrong when she saw it and we declined boxes."
Crystal L.,"West Hollywood, CA",2800,1070,1407,3.0,9/18/2016,"Who goes shopping in Beverly Hills and then has lunch at a Cheesecake Factory?!  This gal apparently.  Honestly, my SO has never been to one and there wasn't a line for a late afternoon lunch so we took the plunge.   This isn't the giant sized typical CF location.  Our little table for two was tiny and so tightly packed that my chair was constantly being knocked by servers passing by (we were also near the kitchen exit).  Knowing how much food a CF meal usually involves, I wondered how they were going to get all of that on our tiny table.  They managed.  But we weren't exactly comfy and neighboring tables are extremely close.   My SO wasn't adequately prepared for the sheer volume of options at a Cheesecake Factory.  It really is overwhelming.  She settled on the Veggie Melt with sweet potato fries.  It looked very cheesy and she did like it.  I went with the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Buffalo sauce.  It was better than I anticipated with lots of creamy blue cheese sauce.   Although we were both having sandwiches, our server still brought bread to the table.  So gluttonous.  And glutenous I suppose.  Anyway their bread is still pretty good, so no complaints.   Service was fast and very friendly.  The experience was probably 3.5 stars with the better than average food and good service, but the cramped quarters make it hard to enjoy what is a pretty reliably decent meal."
Sugar L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,34,20,2.0,3/27/2017,Avoid this location. Service was extremely bad. Slow. Slow Slow.  Negatives: Waited 20 minutes for a waiter to give us the check.  Food was not the best.  Salad was old and dull. Steak pieces were good. All of our bloody Mary's had No alcohol. How was that possible? Didn't taste an ounce of vodka. Very disappointing. Black label was ok. Spent close to $150 on 4 people and it was just not worth it.
Althea M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",2,14,48,5.0,10/6/2017,One of my favorite restaurants in Beverly Hills! I enjoyed dining with the miso salmon - always tender and delicious. Good customer service and Clean environment. I enjoyed the patio near the street when the sun sets. It's so beautiful. U recommend this original Cheesecake Factory.
William H.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",3,48,13,4.0,8/2/2017,I'm a huge fan if the Chinese Chicken Salad. We had tiramisu cheesecake! Love it! Not so sweet but great texture!
Manoosh A.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",131,2,,5.0,12/3/2017,"Came here on a Sunday night and it was an amazing time. The waitress, Nicole, was very nice and friendly. She got to me in a timely manner for everything from the greeting all the way to when I was finished. The food of course was a amazing as well. Fresh, well cooked and delicious. For a Sunday night, there was a good amount of traffic so the environment was very upbeat and fun. Highly recommend this place!!"
Megan M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",68,22,24,5.0,11/23/2017,Always sure of quality -- this restaurant was especially nice. Our waiter was attentive but not over-bearing. Great meal!
Jennifer P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,11,5.0,9/8/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurant's. The food is,really good with good proportions   Enough to take home for a snack later!   Ally! The hostesss is beautiful,professional and always makes everyone feel comfortable and want to stay a while! Erick at the bar, was very helpful in explaining drinks,and giving great suggestions on entrees from the menu.  Very nice and Very Handsome young man] their service was truly appreciated   Save room for dessert the cheesecake is amazing, I would say they have 100 different flavors!  So Good. YOU GOTTA TRY IT!!!   ENJOY!!!"
John E.,"Valencia, CA",171,272,1474,2.0,7/12/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat - usually. I appreciate the generous portions, menu variety and of course the cheesecakes!! However this particular visit to this location left me feeling highly underwhelmed and let down. While usually solid in the entrée quality department, tonight was far from solid. First up we had the Buffalo Blasts - ok they came thru pretty well except we did notice the spice wasn't as noticeable as we have had on other occasions at other CFs. We had literally dunk the blasts in the buffalo sauce cup to get the full kick of flavor - not typical.  We also ordered up the Fried Shrimp. First time with this entrée and boy it was a miss. The mentioned that the shrimp are butterflied but that actually was part of the problem. Butterflying the shrimp led to the shrimp tasting extremely dry and chewy. The breading wasn't any help either. A batter dip would have been better. The coleslaw that came with it was tasteless as well. Oh but not to worry about the fries - there's plenty of those.   Next up was the Chicken Enchiladas. Upon ordering, this sounded great - I hadn't tried these here yet, so I was looking forward to it. Ugh what a mistake. The presentation was very attractive but the taste again was a real let down. Zero flavor and spice to this dish. Yeap - bland Mexican dish. Impossible right? Good amounts of cheese but the sauce and chicken was really below run of the mill. I was pretty surprised. Rice was like sticky white rice with some pesto sauce brushed on it. If I scooped in the rice was actually white in clumps. Uhh not Mexican rice at all. Beans were... well black beans - actually the best part of the meal. No to-go box needed for this plate of leftovers.  Ok one dish that came thru was the Spicy Cashew Chicken on rice. This was a specialty dish. Good amounts of chicken cooked well. The sauce was nice with a good kick of spice. Plenty of rice - this was a winner. Enough to share.  Another bright spot was my Pineapple Mojito. It came with a bunch of ice but was made pretty strong, as was the dirty martini we had. Bartender was serving well tonight.  Of course the cheesecakes did not disappoint. Smores cheesecake was huge with marshmallows and graham crackers on top. The other cheesecake ordered was the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake - excellent. Creamy and not to sweet.  So along the lines of food taste we had two huge strikeouts. I mean I didn't think The Cheesecake Factory could let me down, but tonight it definitely did. Another blow to the dining experience was the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. We were seated next to the kitchen swinging door and the floor was always a mess. I mean if you got up to leave your table you would be ice skating on the grease on the slippery floor. Later I would see busboys dragging bags or cloth bags of trash across the floor - no doubt smearing the slimy filth across customer's walking paths. Gross and actually dangerous. I saw several other patron doing the arms out balance dance.  I was really shocked by the overall experience - especially while dining in the 90210 Beverly Hills restaurant. I have never had such a poor experience at a Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was fine and had a personality but the dining and food was severely inadequate. Cheesecake was the only reason this was lifted from one star to two."
Nina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,160,185,4.0,2/28/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places where you either hate it or love it.   I have a soft spot for this chain.  There are so many options to choose from and I haven't had a dish I haven't liked.  They have a 'skinny' menu in case you don't want a big, rich dish.  In the non-skinny menu, the portions can be too big; I can never finish my dish but there are always leftovers.  I always look forward to getting their avocado rolls and eating their sourdough bread.  I have never eaten their cheesecake since the calorie count scares me!!   I like this location since it's low key and chill and the wait isn't that long. You can also spot a celebrity if you're lucky!"
Sara N.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",3,22,5,3.0,11/13/2017,"My boyfriend and I were around the area so we decided to eat at Cheesecake Factory on Beverly. It was a Sunday night, 20 minute wait. We were hungry but the wait wasn't so bad. After being seated, we weren't approached for about 10 minutes. We ignored it since it seemed busy. As soon as our waiter came in, we ordered all our drinks and food because at that point, we were starving.  The two glasses of wine came out first and the glass was disgusting. There were what looked like pieces of food from someone else's mouth that had drank out of the wine glass prior to being given to us... but we ignored it since our waiter was nowhere to be found anyways. Our waiter was nice, but not very attentive. I guess there was really no need since we had everything we needed, but no follow up on how we were doing. Regardless, the service was just okay. The reason for the three stars is because it's Beverly Hills... I don't care if it is a freakin' Islands, this place should be an upgrade from any other of its franchises given its location alone. Maybe don't dim the lights as much so you can see what is dirty and what isn't? Also, my seat had the view of the servers drink station and it was very unappealing watching servers comb through their hair with their hands and then touch the tip of the straw where customers put their mouths. Just saying. Most likely will not be back to this location."
Charmagne N.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,129,278,1.0,11/28/2016,"Honestly, pretty meh.  We came here for a late lunch around 1:30pm on Sunday. I did expect a wait, after all, this is Cheesecake Factory. And if I'm not mistaken, this Beverly Hills location is the original.   The woman at the front was bustling and trying to take names, and continuously keep track of which tables were available. She told us it'd be a 15 minute wait, but it was more like 30. Not her fault, she was very diligent, but I wish she gave us a more accurate time estimate.  When we were seated, our server came by and asked what we'd like to drink. He brought us our water, and fortunately told us bread was on the way. I was absolutely famished and relieved at the sight of sourdough and honey wheat bread with butter on the side.  Lukewarm, but still very good. We ordered and waited a while for our food.  As we waited I looked around the restaurant. It was cozy, and much smaller than other Cheesecake Factories that I've been. The design of the place seemed simpler too. The walls were still shades of brown, yellow, & orange tones that are familiar to Cheesecake Factory, but there weren't as many intricate and elaborate designs on the walls or of the decor. Just compare this to the Cheesecake Factory, at say, the Grove and you'll see what I mean. It's not a bad thing, just something I noticed.  I noticed we got our food fairly quick at this location, so that is a plus. However, the food was disappointing. I got the Texan rolls which were basically oily fried eggrolls in a weird green sauce that had a bit of hot sauce in it. The way the hot sauce was added to the green sauce made it look like it had been dropped in there by accident which turned me off a little. Kinda gross. The sauce had a pretty weak flavor overall.  A pretty lackluster experience which was made worse by an annoying bratty little boy who obnoxiously laughed and yelled and took pictures of everyone in the restaurant. Call me a bit heartless, but one can only take so much of a little boy going up to one's table and taking pictures of the people there, very up close. It gets annoying after it's gone on for an hour and a half. Not the restaurant's fault, the waiters seemed annoyed with him too, but it really ruined the experience for me even further. Definitely not coming back.  So factors of the long wait, annoying brat, lackluster food, and blah experience contributed to why I didn't think the food was worth the price (standard pricing for all cheesecake factories, but I usually don't have a bad time) and why I gave a bad review. Sorry! Won't be back!"
Cheryl T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,7,5.0,12/20/2017,"I am writing this review to acknowledge our server as she went above and beyond expectations.Yasmeen was either told by the customers sitting next to us or she may have overheard our conversation. At the end of our meal she showed up with a few other servers and surprised my parents with an ice cream sundae and said ""I heard it is your 59th wedding anniversary and you are an inspiration to all of us. We wanted you to have this."" My parents and I were so touched by this act of kindness. I had not requested anything from the restaurant as we did celebrate their anniversary last week; however, today is my parent's actual anniversary, so this was so special and very much appreciated."
Jim S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,38,,3.0,12/22/2017,I guess I would rate it ok.  Most of the food coming out to tables looked good.  I was there for happy hour and ordered medium burger with fries.  The burger arrived well done not medium like I ordered and the fries arrived once I almost finished the burger.  So they need to work on timing and making sure that you get your meal the way you order it.  Might be worth going back one more time before making a final judgement. If they want a 20% tip in addition to salary then they better get the order right and delivered on time.
Mayte T.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,3,1.0,4/18/2017,"I'm writing this review for my boss. He usually orders from here and gets take out, however on April 11th he had glass on his first bite of the Cobb salad. After calling the restaurant, they just said they will toss out all the lettuce. Not sure how that will solve the glass in the salad problem.."
Jill G.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,113,29,3.0,5/24/2017,"I've ordered to go many times from this Location and every time it's been disappointing I order the kale and quinoa salad which in house is AWESOME crunchy and yummy and warm. When you get to go here I feel like they hate when you order to go because they are so busy and it's an inconvenience. They have forgetten avocado once and the time before that gave me so little dressing it Barely covered my salad. I've never actually sat down at this location, but I am disappointed with my to go orders for sure. The fact I had to toss out my salad the last time is saddening as I used to really love CKF for fast yummy food with a great variety!"

Heather W.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,137,292,4.0,9/7/2016,"If you are already there checking the reviews for what to order---it is ALL good..the Thai salmon is so good it is worth going back for that alone!  I only took a star off for the crowding of the tables.  Very small place crowded with too much furniture. We were seated in the front window area so maybe next time I will see if we can get a booth.  We Ubered over so we did not have to deal with parking issues in Beverly Hills. They don't take reservations but there was no line when we arrived (6pm) and we were seated right away!  The tables are so close together that you could hear the conversations of the tables next to you.  There was no private conversation.  People at the next table would chime into our conversation....or ask what we were eating.  We tried the recommended Long Island Tea and it was so good, I had a 2nd.  One was enough.  Very potent and tasty drink.  My guest also tried their signature martini.  The food -- my guest had shrimp pasta and I had the Thai (sweet) salmon.  All top quality with beautiful presentation.  OMG the best salmon I have had!  We indulged in cheesecake but shared one  as they are so big and full of bad calories/fat.  Portions were generous. Although the food was outstanding, it was a bit pricey and I don't think I will return here because of the crowded seating.  You really felt you were sitting at a long table with a bunch of strangers, closer than comfort. If I am going to pay that high a price, I want a better atmosphere with more than six inches between tables!"
Farnoosh A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,7,1.0,10/8/2017,"Um... whats wrong with this location? Lets start out with the usually soft and warm bread, it was rock hard and definitely not warm. Then we asked for avocado egg rolls, which they were all out of.  We got the spinach dip instead... we should've skipped appetizers over all.  We had to ask our sever for plates 3 times and nothing.  I ordered the shrimp platter for my main.. it was just meh.  My friends ordered a pasta and a chicken sandwich both were horrible. We spend 120 dollars. Definitely not worth our money."
Ty A.,"Sacramento, CA",3,4,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Super super SLOW. EVERYTIME I order to go,it takes AT LEAST 25 mins to get my food. I tried to order to go  a couple days ago and stayed on hold 10 mins before they could find someone to take my order. Finally ordered and she asked if I wanted the lunch or dinner portion of whatever I was ordering. I said well what's the difference besides portions? She said she didn't know...go figure. Anyway...I  brought in a family from a CELEBRITY client I have and everyone HATED the food. It was so embarrassing and they asked why I brought them there. Smh. No seasoning on none of the food."
James A.,"Manhattan, NY",9,456,213,1.0,11/25/2017,"The last time I ate here was about a year or maybe two ago....  There were cockoraches in our booth, in the day time, which represents a large infestation.   It was completely disgusting.  The restaurant knew about the issue and tried to blame the connected commercial spaces.  Regardless, they had cockoraches and all the money they are making, they should only have the absolute best cleaning start and absolute best pest control service, but apparently they do not.   The manager moved us to the opposite side of the restaurant and didn't charge us for our dinner, because they were embarrassed.   As much as I love cheesecake factory and how they tried to make us forget about dining with cockroaches, in good conscience, I cannot go back to this location, knowing that their level of sanitation is inadequate or else they wouldn't have cockroaches."
