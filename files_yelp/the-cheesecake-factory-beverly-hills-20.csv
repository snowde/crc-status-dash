Terrence T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/18/2014,1. Just saw the manager take food out of a to go box and put them on a plate with his bare hands. To the manager: we can see you. 2. They ran out of lemon herb chicken and didn't tell me until my wife's food came out. The manager did take care of the bill so I can get pass #2. Definitely cannot get pass number 1. My waiter was a really cool guy though so 2 stars instead of 1.
Mahnaz B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",846,110,37,5.0,12/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place for birthdays. I went there for my sons birthday. He loved the food along with the rest of my family. There spicy chicken pasta was outstanding. I loved the service they gave us too, they constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing. The desert is definitely what tops it all off. They have the best cheesecake in the world. Which is pretty self-explanatory due to its name. Overall this place is great and I will definitely go there again."
Ian M.,"Anaheim, CA",69,95,34,3.0,12/24/2015,Came here around 10 PM on a week night because I was craving a piece of cheesecake.  I was in the mood for something classic/traditional but I was reluctant to order the plain cheesecake because I was not convinced that the quality would be up to my standard.  Instead I ordered the strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was pretty good but nothing to brag about. The strawberries did not seem fresh at all. They had little flavor. The cheesecake crust was soft instead of having a slightly crunchy/hard graham cracker crust. The cheesecake could have been a lot colder. Not that impressed since I came here solely for cheesecake and cheesecake is included in the name of the restaurant.
Bethany K.,"Orange County, CA",102,597,106,4.0,3/16/2013,"I had no idea that this was the very first Cheesecake Factory location! Who woulda thought it started here in LA... If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory, you already know what you're getting--they're SUPER consistent, from my experience. If you haven't already been to a CF before, prepare for a HUGE menu, very very big portions, and helpful, friendly service. We came on a Thursday evening (a little on the late side) and got seated INSTANTLY. This has never happened in my CF experience... ever! Service was very, very attentive and they had some kind of secret system set up where 3-4 different people helped us through the night in tandem... interesting, no? It also felt a little smaller than I've experienced before, but we only saw the very front area (where we were seated). We had our usuals -- avocado egg rolls, kale salad, and the husband's Chicken Bellagio... with lots of brown bread :) Everything was solid, as expected. PARKING was okay actually--the meters end at 8 (or 9pm...) and we found a spot right across the street, though that's probably not the case during a normal time of day. They do have valet, so I guess they're on par with the Marina Del Rey location in that sense. Boo for no better parking alternatives."
Dani Z.,"Culver City, CA",127,278,657,5.0,9/12/2011,"Hi marks for the service and an added mark for the waitress who thanked and wished us a good evening as we were leaving - she was not our waitress! If you are a 'shroom fan (not the halucagen type) you must try the stuffed mushrooms from the small plate menu. These were the BEST stuffed mushrooms I've ever had, and I think it is in part to not using seafood and drenching the suckers in a garlic and possibly parm sauce. YUMM YUMM!!!! I enjoyed the bowtie pasta with chicken, mushrooms and peas. Very tasty and no skimp on the chicken. And of course, dessert....you don't go to the Cheesecake Factory and leave without dessert! My favorite is the Tiramisu Cheesecake, but since it is my favorite, I wanted to try another. Lemon Rasberry won the vote....and did so very well. This delight was drenched in a tart rasberry sauce and plated with CF's famous whipped cream.  Great service, tasty food, and sinful cheesecake....and for a chain, this was a nice location, too!"
Rashmi Arimilli ..,"Pittsburgh, PA",26,16,,4.0,9/27/2015,"Just adding one more to their positive reviews . It's a great place for a good and cozy dinner . Tonight, I have been to this place with a friend for a dinner . They have a sweeping menu . Mostly, I  tend to order their pina colada for d drink so did I today . The food here is always saporous . Their chicken samosa and bang bang chicken have been on the top of my list to order in there . For the deserts part , all of them are good but I find their tiramasu and chocolate tower truffle cake extremely delightful . The service is decent ."
Carlos A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/25/2016,"Freaking awesome place, and the service... Fantastic! I guess since it is located in Beverly Hills they are supposed to treat you like kings in here, nice place and great food i trully recommend it"
Nae S.,"San Francisco, CA",124,72,35,2.0,6/27/2015,"SMALL AF. Anxiety just standing in this claustrophobic waiting area. Small bar, tables like an inch from each other. Never again. I need air!"
Lula L.,"Pasadena, CA",5,106,3,5.0,8/30/2013,Great food. Good service. Appealing atmosphere. Prices within reason. I love the Luau Salad and the Dynamite Chicken. Highly consistent quality across locations.  Good to Know: This location had valet parking for $7 and a dog friendly patio in front. Memory Lane: This is the original Cheesecake Factory location and my parents used to drive us out to BH for the treat of eating here. Love the cheesecake - original style!
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,5/12/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory holds a place near and dear to my heart. I remember meeting up with family here over 10 years ago and back again last week was a real flashback. Just as I remembered, given the location, a ton of Hollywood wannabees, many ""important"" phone calls, overdressed for where they are and a ton of tourists visiting Beverly Hills wanting to have a cheap and filling meal. The waits like at any Cheesecake Factory are long. The menu even longer. Seriously, the selection is just too  big. Somehow they manage to make most dishes really taste ok. You can eat anything from American to Mexican cuisine here, really anything you could be in the mood for, I am sure they will have. I usually go with one of the huge salads, good but enough sodium and fat for the entire day. Their happy hour at the bar is pretty good, i liked most of the food, the portions aren't as insane and with $5 a plate you can't really go wrong. Service is always rushed and way too busy but the orders come out at a descent time. On my dime or if dinner is my choice, I would never come here, but for a chain it is A-Ok compared to most others."
Tiffany S.,"West Hollywood, CA",82,35,56,5.0,4/2/2016,"The best Cheesecake Factory Ever!!!  The real reason Andrew... A tall, lovely man with caring, green -blue eyes and the kindest heart ever!  His magnetic way of being and effervescent service is of the highest caliber.  We have visited over 30 different Cheesecake Factory's over a decade or more.  Never has there been a more fastidious server or a more professional employee!! This man is an asset to this company and deserves a raise!  Albeit, we have let the company know, our family elected to go on Yelp to let you good folks know about this diamond!!!! Andrew is bar none, the most benevolent and considerate person, in this industry !!! Going to Cheesecake Factory and eating with him as your server is like spending time with friends and family.  FYI, the manager Cher is amazing and undoubtedly the bread and butter.  Esteban is hands on, very professional and efficient!  Please let the team know Heavenly sent you and you may get a sweet treat in the end!!!  Honorable mention, Kevin is the best host in the universe...."
Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,3,4,5.0,2/7/2016,Supper friendly staff and absolutely recommending this place to everyone thanks Cheesecake Factory
Ani B.,"Glendale, CA",2,10,2,5.0,4/17/2016,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to by far! Best service by our waiter Dave. I'm vegan; and I'm not the easiest person to serve, but he was so patient and prompt. He refilled our cups without us even noticing! He surprised my friend and I after our horrible experience with the Santa Monica cheesecake. We will be definitely coming back, thanks to Dave! Thank you from Lucine and Myself."
Loreann T.,"Sacramento, CA",321,120,24,1.0,4/16/2014,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! When I go to a chain restaurant with mediocre food, then service is EVERYTHING, and this place has servers who don't really know what their job is. Several times we had to call over our waitress to take our order or get us a drink! And she barely cracked a smile. I wanted to treat my uncle and aunt, who were visiting from out of the country, to a typical American chain, and I was soooo ashamed at the kind of treatment we got.  If you must go to Cheesecake Factory, don't go to this one."
Priscilla Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,832,1893,3.0,12/12/2010,"Have been longing for this cheesecake for a long time. One piece is really big, $6.95.  They have so many types, and I cannot make a decision.  The waiter recommended the red velvet and the chocolate fudge. I think I prefer the original taste of cheese cake. It is thick.  But actually, I'm not a big fan of cheesecake. I can never finish one piece by myself. And I think they just look pretty."
Farwah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,324,40,3.0,5/8/2015,"service and lighting at this location has always been meh. wait staff is transitory, bus boys are rude. however, the employees behind the to-go counter are really friendly.  I don't know why its always so dark in the restaurant, but this location needs a re-do in this dept.  other than that, food is as good as it was the last time you were here. what i love is that CF is comfort food for the flavors you grew up loving. Its really hard to not like what you order since its is a ""factory""."
Jessica L.,"Freehold Township, NJ",0,44,3,5.0,10/28/2014,Very pleased with the service here! Amazing service plus excellent food served very quickly! I recommend ordering the edamame  and garlic bread. The caesar salad is also yummy!  Love having the option to sit indoors or outside to people watch. Great location with easy parking. Will be back again when traveling in beverly hills!
Richard H.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,12,5,5.0,7/23/2016,Everything was excellent from the beginning. Everyone served with a smile and Philip gave the best service we've had here!! 5 stars!
Amanda P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",152,363,331,5.0,3/17/2013,"This place never disappoints. Good looking waiters, extensive menu, and amazing red velvet cheesecake! My usual order is either the chicken marsala or the spicy chicken chipotle pasta"
Angela A.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,417,66,4.0,7/14/2015,"Located in the heart of Beverly Hills, this spot is nearly busy all of the time. Good service, decent salad and delicious cheesecake. This time we tried a bit of the Lemon Merengue and Tuxedo. The Lemon was amazing and the Tux was good as well, more on the rich side."
