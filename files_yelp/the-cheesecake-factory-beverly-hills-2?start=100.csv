Milla L.,"Luodong Township, Taiwan",0,3,2,4.0,8/15/2016,Everything was good. But the cheese cake actually was a bit too sweet for Asian people I guess.
Nicole V.,"Los Angeles, CA",702,547,1570,5.0,7/3/2015,"This location is really small, and gets really busy, but it is worth it for the service. I applaud the staff for being very patient and accommodating with their customers. The manager Adie is really nice and excels in customer service. Kathy working in the bakery is extremely nice,  and always ensures that my to go order is currently made.  I've eaten here on a number of occasions and the serving staff including Colette and Danielle have been really nice providing great customer service. I tend to try new cocktails all the time there, and Danielle provided me with some great recommendations that did not disappoint.   Of course, a cheesecake factory visit is not complete without dessert,  and even if I'm too full I make sure to take it home to go. A few not of my favorites area the oreo cheesecake, the chocolate godiva, the s'mores one (have to eat it fresh though), the original, and the original with strawberries."
Jimmy S.,"Columbia, MD",13,94,35,1.0,2/8/2017,"Horrible service, host and management. We went there for lunch and the staff is super rude and unprofessional. We exited without placing an order. After filing our complain with the management they refused to handle it but instead emailed a gift card. I did not file a complain for free meal fix your shit or shut it down."
Nicole K.,"Los Angeles, CA",433,8,,3.0,2/27/2017,"Reduced menu from regular Cheesecake Factories.  Last time we were there, service was poor; I do think part of this might be the tight design of the space.  It's the same food as other CFs but I wouldn't go if you need attention at your table."
Chhaya N.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,291,1038,3.0,9/24/2015,"Food: Ordered the lunch special (soup and salad). Thursdays the soup is Mexican Chicken. Soup isn't bad, however it is a little spicy, fair warning to anyone, they don't mention that.  The strawberry-lemonade I ordered was waaaay too sweet. I have a sweet tooth, so me saying that means something. This is the second time I couldn't drink my refill because it was soooo syrupy.  My salad came pre-dressed which normally I'm not a fan of, but this time there wasn't excessive dressing. Atmosphere: Place is clean and music is fine. They do however seat people very close to you despite amble room in the place.  Service: My waitress seemed extremely stressed and I came right at the opening. I only ordered soup and salad and it took 30 minutes to come out. Took a little long for something so small. Also she was not friendly at all and seemed annoyed at all of her customers. When I asked what the specials were of the day, she said ""I don't know, I don't work Thursdays"". Although she did ask, she seemed annoyed at having to do so. Service would have dragged this to a 2 star. This is the first time I've had service like this. Overall: I'll come again. Just in off periods to enjoy my time"
Nafiseh P.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/1/2017,It is totally different between this restaurant and the other branch in Redondo Beach. It doesn't have good service and the taste of foods not good. I had very good experience in other branch so I choose this restaurant but it is not good.
David Y.,"Beverly Hills, CA",67,103,65,2.0,5/10/2015,"This place is BY FAR the most unprofessional Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, and Cheesecake usually one of my favorite restaurants. I have came here numerous times and have held back writing a bad review just because I like the food at Cheesecake so much, but today was the last straw.  I came here for Mother's Day with my family and the hostess would not seat my brother and I who were waiting for the rest of my family who was still finding parking outside even though more than half the restaurant was empty. Then when my family finally came inside we asked to be seated on the outside patio and she said it was full, my father literally walked her outside and showed her an Open table after arguing back and forth and she finally sat us. The manager came out and apologized but 15 minutes of our time was wasted, and at the end gave us 30% off the bill, but money is not an issue here, while the manager was nice and didnt charge us full price i would have much rathered pay extra and have a better experience. I have had numerous bad experiences here from the waiter spilling a drink all over my clothes, to being charged extra on the bill.  It is such a shame because the food is truly amazing and most of the staff is very nice but the ones who don't know what they are doing truly ruin it for the restaurant. I think cheesecake needs to take some sort of training initiative to train their employees better so that they can deal with the business of the restaurant. The area is great located on north Beverly drive In The heart of Beverly Hills. There is a 2 hour parking list across the street and meters close by."
AJ G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/2/2017,"The biggest credit goes to our server ALINE. She needs to be promoted. Super friendly, professional and just goes above and beyond with her job. Thank you. And to be fair, the place, food and other staff are also wonderful."
Jacklyn S.,"Santa Monica, CA",33,155,232,4.0,10/3/2015,"Yummy Great service Always recommended their shrimp angel hair dinner, will run you more than $20 but worth it Enjoy their different types of lemonades!! :)"
Alan M.,"Sayville, NY",0,9,2,1.0,10/15/2016,I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory before and it has been very good. This location served me a steak that was like shoe leather. My French fries were cold and our server was MIA. Worst meal and service I ever had.  Find somewhere else to eat.
Stacy S.,"Chatsworth, CA",102,45,6,1.0,3/31/2017,"HORRIBLE and I mean HORRIBLE experience. First we waiting in line for togo orders that we called in for over 15 minutes. (okay fine they are busy I get that) WE get out food and everything was so rushed and the 4 people behind the counter were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We get the food back to our office and I was absolutely mortified and what we saw. First and foremost all of the cheesecakes there thrown into small black boxes smashed in there and looked horrible. The pot stickers were cold and had some type of mystery meat in the box that clearly wasn't part of the order, the Avocado rolls was soggy and smashed. We ordered Chicken Sliders and they gave us beef! So we called the manager and spoke to Brian and he agreed and said that he knew the food sat and didn't look good for apologized.. WE said why didn't  you send it back and asked us to wait for proper food. He didn't have an answer. He just said he would give us the money back. at this point it doesn't matter about the money it matters the time we wasted on our lunch to go there and drive back to work! He said that he sent the pot stickers back and they were right away. and the meat was from something else he couldn't answer.. For this to be our go to lunch spot NOT anymore. Their Food, Service and presentation and gone down!! Lost loyal Customer's."
Nelson F.,"Culver City, CA",410,616,1098,4.0,8/9/2014,"Sat at the bar for their happy hour, which is pretty good though somewhat reminds me of Chillis/TGIF/Applebee's Happy Hour.  So pretty corporate and the food is filling.  The portions are really big which is surprising for happy hours so you really do get your money's worth. Plus, the variety of happy hour menu items is pretty impressive.  The prices are worth coming in for, besides the cheesecake, which are half price appetizers from 2-6 M-F. Beer is $3-$5 and they also have discount wine and well drinks, around $5 too.  Cheesecake is full price though, but is worth treating yourself for saving money on the food.  We got $3 beer (Bud, Bud light, Coors, Miller) southwest egg rolls, and nachos.  I think they had 3 types of nachos offered.  Then we split the vanilla bean cheesecake which is pure decadence. Get there early or you'll have to wait.  The bar area is small and fills up quickly.  The rest of the restaurant isn't particularly large either.  Parking? Valet or Beverly Hills public parking. Definitely worth stopping by, wish they offered smaller sized cheesecake because it's so unbelievably rich!"
Silvia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,,1.0,9/27/2016,"Generally their food is good and I often get my lunch there; however, I cannot recommend the Fish & Chips. Whole lot of batter and barely any fish. Disappointing."
David K.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,86,46,5.0,3/4/2016,It was my first time at the location. Overall I'm happy with the service and the food. The price is reasonable and the employees are very friendly.  The only problem I had was the floors were dirty and slippery. It felt like I was going to fall everytime I was walking.
Rusty H.,"Pasadena, CA",325,148,354,4.0,3/12/2016,"This Beverly Hills location is the first Cheesecake Factory, ever. The layout seems a bit strange, and from what we were told it's because the restaurant was half the size and they took over the space next door. The food is consistently good from location to location. One person from our party had to wait expecially long for her food, our waiter made sure to keep her updated on the status and offered her a salad which we thought was great. Friendly staff. Parking across the street for  $5 or valet out front (didn't see the price)."
Brian K.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,53,,4.0,7/7/2016,"Cheese Cake Factory... One of the popular American(?) fusion restaurants in SoCal. You probably have visited this franchise restaurant at least once in your life I believe. The Beverly Hills location is not a far different than other locations. Modern design interior with dark atmosphere. Romantic and casual place to hang and enjoy your meals. Most food entries are decent and prices are reasonable as well. I gave 4 stars because its noisiness and loudness of the interior space. Sometimes so loud that you cannot hear your companies unless you sit right next to them. But with decent crowd, it is a perfect place."
J T.,"Fullerton, CA",11,501,49,3.0,4/26/2016,"Bad: My shrimp garlic noodle was decent. My fiance decided to try to steak. Big mistake! The meat was so tender and soggy that it was inedible. The meat had no flavor. We thought it would taste better the next day. When we open the carton, the meat had already spoiled.  Good: Our waiter was great. Very attentive. He must have came to our table at least 10 times during dinner"
Kat A.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,25,1,3.0,12/1/2016,Good but every time I've gone we get the same waiter and he always forgets somthing which is annoying
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,2.0,1/20/2015,"If my history serves me correctly, I believe that this Cheesecake Factory Restaurant in Beverly Hills was the very first restaurant in this great chain!!  I fell in love with The Cheesecake Factory 25 years ago because of this specific branch!  I remember dining at this branch several times with my parents and sister when we came down to L.A. It pains me to write this review.  The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite Chain Restaurant.  I became a Cheesecake Factory fanatic after eating here 25 years ago!  Found ourselves in Beverly Hills recently, so I was excited to take my wife and other family members here!  I have to say that this is not the same Cheesecake Factory I remembered.  It was a very disappointing and disheartening experience!!! Took me a little while to locate the restaurant because their name is covered by trees.  Finally found them and walked in.  Greeted by the hostess and only waited a few minutes before being seated.  First thing I noticed when we were inside was that this place is small!  Never noticed that before.  They are much smaller than any other location that I have been to even with their being some tables outside.  The restrooms?  Do not recommend using them.  They were dirty!  There is one restroom that is shared by both men and women.  If you go through another door (which most of the employees go through), then you will find a separate men's room and women's room.  Both were also not very clean.  ( 2 stars for the ambiance). Service was below average.  Our waiter was attentive, but it really felt like he was rushing us to finish and leave.  He never cracked a smile or even introduce himself.  Not what I'm used to when I go to Cheesecake Factory locations.  ( 2 stars for service). The food was disappointing as well.  I ordered the Kobe Burger.  I ordered it medium, but it came out well done.  I should have asked for another one, but I did not feel like waiting another 30 minutes because I was already starving.  It was the worst burger that I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory.  ( 2 stars ) My brother in law was also not happy with his burger.  He had the Classic Burger.  He said that his burger from Black Bear Diner was much better than the one made here.  ( 2 stars ) There was some good news, though.  My brother in law's wife loved the Miso Salmon.  ( 5 stars ) My wife ordered her favorite which is the Chicken Katsu.  It did not disappoint her.  She said it was as good as the other locations, if not better.  ( 5 stars ) This is the first time ever that I have not ordered a slice of Cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory.  I was just so disappointed with everything that happened!!!  Did not want to stay in the restaurant any longer. I will always be thankful for discovering The Cheesecake Factory here In Beverly Hills 25 years ago.  I just do not know if I would ever come back here after this disappointing experience.  At least I never had this bad experience the first time I went here."
Critic C.,"South Gate, CA",49,33,4,1.0,12/27/2016,"Love the jambalaya not to mention the carrot cake. Unfortunately what I saw disgusted me so much I will not be coming here. I saw the cooks spanking each other with the bread that's served to the customers, SMH."
