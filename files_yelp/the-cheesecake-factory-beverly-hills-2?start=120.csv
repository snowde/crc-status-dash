Arthur S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,11,4.0,6/15/2017,"Thank you, to the hostess - Aileen, who makes my visit to this restaurant location extra special. Always an attentive and polite service from her."
Hooman H.,"Calgary, Canada",12,72,13,5.0,3/27/2016,Very good food and more than anything I loved the location on the roof. I would highly recommend this restaurant because I also enjoyed the area which it is located. Easily can spend the whole day in this area. Service was also phenomenal.
Jason H.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",96,342,938,2.0,4/26/2015,"I normally like Cheesecake Factory. When I lived back east, it was a Saturday regular ritual in suburbia.  For what it is, I enjoy it - but not this location. A bit cramped. You could barely move without feeling the need to excuse yourself with the tables next to you. And while the french country salad and the chicken samoosas were just as usual - delicious - the fish n chips were so oiley I failed to finish half of a lunch portion. It was literally drenched in oil and barely edible. The lettuce wraps weren't up to par either. Chicken, dry and overcooked and also - not finished, but for the first time it wasn't because of the ridiculous portions. So while it was probably my first bad meal at a Cheesecake, it was certainly my last meal at this one."
Hyeunjun S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,34,54,2.0,4/9/2017,Not friendly as usual CKF. Not clean. Wait a long time for your food. Floor is slippery. Hard to park parking spaces.
Watty W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",456,10,6,5.0,10/30/2016,"‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍­Andrew is most professional, efficient, kind server and the quintessential representative  the Beverly Hills Cheesecake Factory store!  We only come to this  location because he is the server!  He knows all the family orders by  heart! He is bar none the most honest and humane person!  When Andrew takes care of our family the kids laugh more, smile more are happier and feel like they are being seen,  heard and taken care of authentically! The staff is very efficient and courteous, however, the standout is undoubtedly Andrew!  He makes our neighborhood a home  by including all our family in the new dishes and special, delicious appetizers!  We love  trying all the new add on's and he calls us all by name and remembers all the details!  Thank you  for hiring a real  angel!  We think  you are the smartest company out there!  We know so... because you only hire the best!  Please give this gentleman a raise!  Or we will have to start tipping him 200% to insure he stays with u and us!  We love  your company but most of all we adore Andrew M!"
Khaleesi T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,52,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"Don't let the beverly hills location fool you one bit! !!!!   This is basically a cheesecake factory with Hometown buffet service. NOT A SINGLE server, waiter, or cashier smiles.When paying for food at the To-go counter by the desserts, not a single cashier says, ""hello"" or ""how are you"" . Every employee looks  and acts as though they are working there against their will. Maybe its because their break-room lunch table is 5 feet from the toxic smelling dumpster out back . If you think im exaggerating the truth, then go to this location and see for yourself the downtrodden landscape that they call customer service. The food is okay, and decent enough if your hungry.  This review is based in 8 visits, and after spending enough money with this place and being treated like the non-appointment line at DMV, enough is enough. TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES TO PRETEND THAT THEY ENJOY LIFE!!!!"
Linette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,603,2111,3.0,4/16/2015,"Always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, just not of the service. I have yet to find one with awesome service. Sherman oaks, Topanga, the Grove and even here are missing one thing-service! I'm not sure if it's because this place always gets packed, or service isn't priority here but I honestly get better service as Fridays than any Cheesecake Factory I've been to. I always feel like it takes forever to get the check. Refills on drinks are not a priority here. If you ask for a second refill on the bread basket, you get looked at like OMG. Yes sorry not so sorry, I love this place and the bread! I'm sure we all love it. :)"
Alexander H.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/26/2016,"Food was great, but the service was mediocre. Our server had a great personality and was nice throughout the whole process, but lacked the ability to attend us when needed. All in all, I would come back if I'm ever around again and like I said the food was delicious."
Marina S.,"Santa Barbara Downtown, Santa Barbara, CA",101,222,1601,3.0,8/22/2013,"Came here with my mom - We got sated in such an awkward table in the middle of a room. There are no bag hooks and not much room to put any of my purses down except on the floor ( which is not a good idea for Hermes ). I ordered just two appetizers - The Spicy Ahi Tuna roll : It was really filling but oily.                                           - Fried Calamari : It's unquestionably the best I've tasted in Beverly Hills so far.  I also ordered a shake, which if you cannot finish it you can take it home, but the container that we had to take it home in was super dirty eeek!"
Scott B.,"Avalon, CA",12,7,7,4.0,8/2/2016,The menu is extensive. Food and service is friendly. Only drawback is the crowds and parking. But every place in Beverly Hills has that problem.
Ashley W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,3,5.0,10/4/2016,I love the cheesecake factory. Took my Boyfriend here for the first time and he loved the spaghetti. They have something for everyone here.
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,2.0,12/7/2014,"Not up to standard with other locations. Nope, nope, nope. We ate here because we planned poorly during our shopping trip, and because all the other restaurants had long waits, CF was a good option because we could sit right down. First thought was, ""WOW. This place is TINY."" It should seriously be re-billed as Cheesecake Factory Express. It simply is not as spacious and accommodating as other branches, and one restroom for the whole place? Really? The food was standard, even though the prices were extra hiked to account for the location. We also had one of those lame servers who treats everyone like a tourist and himself like he's special. Do you know what I mean? We aren't here to see you, guy. Here's hoping you get your call-back to whatever game show you're auditioning for this week. Sheesh. So yeah, not terrible by any means, but yes, we have had better."
Resturant Critic i.,"Burbank, CA",0,12,1,5.0,2/7/2017,"Let me tell you a story... I was at the CKF in Beverly Hills for the First Time Ever on Saturday the 4th. Sitting across from me was the biggest, rudest Jack#$$, I have ever seen. Not only was this guy rude to the server, but to everyone eating around him and I think his mom.Not only did the server and the manager apologized repeatedly to this Sub Human. But also offered to pick up the tab for the entire meal only have a hand in his face. I Think the Manager's name was Brian. A very nice and professional person. Enough about the jerk. I found service and the food to be extremely good. The Chicken was fantastic. The parking is a little difficult. But what wouldn't be on a Saturday. The Dark Chocolate Cheese Cake is to die for...... Cheers"
Ashley C.,"West Covina, CA",50,136,166,3.0,12/2/2015,I mean I don't know what to say except there was no wait and I have such a terrible waiter that it was hilarious. I had to laugh at the service. Also I might add they forgot to devein my shrimp for the second time. Do better - SMH (I ordered the lemon garlic shrimp off the skinny mini menu - which I must mention is amazing)  Side note the JW lemonade is delicious
Lizette Z.,"Montebello, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/16/2017,Worst server ever . Kyle was inattentive not giving me water not acknowledge us  don't go here I'm really patient when it came to these things but this is ridiculous
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,2.0,9/6/2014,"I haven't been here in a long time.  This Cheesecake Factory is in the heart of Beverly Hills.  I came here for lunch with a bank branch manager on a Thursday afternoon. I ordered the Skinny chopped salad.  My lunch partner ordered the Skinny soft tacos.  The food took a very long time, especially for lunch.  The food was over priced and average at best."
Pratir D.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,2,,5.0,1/15/2016,"To all potential Cheesecake Factory people who want to come here. The water here is so amazing. Like I can't even with this water. Maybe it is because California is in a drought but this water with the ice is so phenomenal. 5 stars just for the water. I can't believe it. Our friend said that it tastes like the water from her home refrigerator, which means it is A grade. Dat Kenmore doe. Come for the water, leave with happiness.  P.S.The potatoes are too crispy but the water makes up for it."
Mark A.,"Studio City, CA",0,8,2,1.0,9/15/2015,"Came here with my mom last Sunday 9/13/2015. We were seated in the back. Our waiter, never mentioned his named, tall skinny curly haired guy had no personality whatsoever. It seemed like he wasn't supposed to work that day. Never greeted us, never checked on us. When we got our food which was a pasta carbonara there was hardly any sauce on it. It was really dry. I was calling the waiter but he kept ignoring us, finally he got to our table and I asked him why there was hardly any sauce. No response, he just turned his head and left, not even a ""sorry"". He did come back 10 mins later with a cup of sauce but just put it on the table.  1 star for being in Beverly Hills. The food was dry and bland, the waiter just put icing on the cake with the horrible and poor service. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory Beverly Hills. Very disappointing."
Flyinlow ..,"Beverly Hills, CA",79,858,668,2.0,9/6/2015,"Really thought the order was coming from the Beverly Drive location...yes we were all feeling lazy was a late night waiting at the airport. Onion Rings, S'mores cheesecake & Buffalo Wings. The onion rings were soggy and cold Buffalo wings hard to explain they had this odd taste to them none of us enjoyed We did polish off the cheesecake as it was remotely the only thing edible"
Claire C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,193,394,4.0,2/1/2016,The first to try this. We have ordered the orange chicken and Chocolate chip cheesecake. The orange is fine and the cake is tasty.
