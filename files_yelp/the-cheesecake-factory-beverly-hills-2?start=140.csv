Viola H.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,8,12,3.0,3/22/2015,"Meal was fine, the Strawberry Cheesecake tho  Better than everything else in the world."
Christine Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,16,36,1.0,8/29/2015,"This is horrible experience. The one in the Grove is much much better! Don't go to the Beverly Hills. The service is just like none.  The waitress didn't ask about and check us at all like we didn't exist. The couple next to us said the same. We all have to raise the hands forever to get a glance.  The shrimp with angel hair was served not fully cooked. The noodle was all sticky together like very tough. They recooked for me but still got some tough noodles in it.  The shrimp was not too bad. Finally they tried to charge twice for the pasta that they recooked....OMG! She didn't even apologize for this error, she said our manager were too busy... I'm a fan of Cheesecake factory but I will never ever come back to this place. The service is just a joke."
Donald S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/25/2015,I would only give 1 star but I feel the waiter did a good job. He was wierd and didn't make eye contact. I had the chicken and biscuits which is like a pot pie without the pie. It had 2 hairs in it. They said it was corn husk fibers but there is no corn in the chicken and biscuits. I don't think there any corn with husks on the menu at all. They replaced my dish very quickly almost suspiciously so.  In closing I can not recommend this place unless you like your chicken and biscuits with a side of pubes. I hope this review has been helpful.u
H S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,55,19,4.0,8/28/2016,Pretty good food! The chicken sandwich was amazing and my husbands burger was huge! He loved it! Service was a little slow and not on point but altogether its more about the food for me!
Ohhee J.,"Century City, Los Angeles, CA",273,340,618,4.0,1/9/2016,"I like cheesecake for the huge variety in their menu. I also like that their portions are huge so you can easily share an entree and order a small salad and have a reasonable priced menu. Not to mention that you will most likely still have leftovers. So there's definitely value in eating at these restaurant chains.  Located in the heart of Beverly Hills, my husband and I walked here so we didn't have to worry about parking. They have metered street parking that's usually super packed on weekend evenings. They also have plentiful parking garages that offers free two hour parking before 5 or all day $5 parking.  Service is really good. I usually order the jambalaya pasta that's always consistently good. Not your typical jambalaya plate with rice and gumbo. It's mostly a cajuny pasta dish that's jammed packed with flavor.  I also ordered the chicken tostada salad. It's HUGE! The salad was the size of two human heads on the plate. Very delicious also."
Becky N.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,9,4.0,7/28/2016,"It's smaller than most, but food was great for me.  We went last week on a weekday, & it was packed-presumably because it's summer.  I wanted to write a review to say that the Maitre D was amazing.  The restaurant was clearly very busy & she kept a calm, coll, collected demeanor.  She was cordial with all patrons, even professional with kids.  Essentially, she was the calm amongst the chaos.  We had our baby with us, so our stroller was a bit in the way, in the very small entry hallway, & she never made us feel intrusive or a pest, she would call out to the other patrons behind us, in a professional manner.  When we left, she also thanked us for coming-genuinely.  Very appreciated, since I know it's not necessary.  I didn't catch her name, but was was tall, slender, African American, with short hair & shimmer/glitter on her arms-which I loved! So stylish!  I hope if she can't get a raise, she at least get's some credit & gets to see/hear the review.  From someone who works hospitality- You are amazing! (only 4 stars instead of 5 because the place could clearly be staffed much better)."
Angel F.,"San Diego, CA",0,72,17,5.0,8/7/2016,"Good food, good ambience, and good service by our waiter. I usually eat at the San Diego Fashion Valley location which is really big and busy. I appreciated the smaller cozier vibe at the Beverly Hills location plus you get to see exotic cars driving by as if spending half a million on a car is normal. We had macaroni and cheese fries balls and they were Delish. We also had the avocado egg rolls which is one of our favorites at the cheesecake factory. We took an Original Cheescake slice to go back to the hotel and I am so glad we went with the original cheesecake slice instead of their other 50 options. The Original Cheesecake is the BEST..."
Ambar C.,"Los Angeles, CA",414,380,2264,3.0,1/21/2013,"We had a gift certificate for $30 that also came with a free cheesecake, so that was great.   The food was decent.  The portions are huge.  We were starving, and there were plenty of options for us.  We went with the ""skinny"" chicken samosas as an appetizer.  I was surprised at how good they were.  The ground chicken was nicely spiced, and the samosas were crispy (a little too greasy, though).  The cilantro-avocado sauce that came with the samosas was refreshing.  I opted for the combo plate of chicken madeira and steak diane.  Both meats came with some kind of mushroom sauce, and the chicken was covered with cheese.  I didn't really dig the cheese covering on the chicken, but the mushroom and wine sauce was good.  I asked for my steak medium-rare, but it came out more like medium well.  Either way, the steak needed salt.   I also ordered the ""firefly"" drink.  I'm not sure if it was really powerful or if it hit me harder because I was tired, but it was strong.  It had tequila, blood orange, pomegranate, and prosecco - really interesting and tasty flavors.  We finished the meal with the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  Surprisingly, there wasn't much of an extreme oreo flavor to it.  There was a gigantic oreo on top of some really thick chocolate frosting.  There were bits of oreo in the middle of the cheesecake.  There were also oreo crumbs on the plate.  I honestly think the regular oreo cheesecake is better.  Don't get me wrong - this one was good, but it wasn't what I was expecting. The service was mediocre.  Our hostess was visibly overwhelmed, and she kept telling us how busy the restaurant was.  We noticed.  It took awhile for us to be seated.  It took a very long time for me to get my drink.  It took a long time for our food to come out, as well.  She wasn't apologetic about it, either.   Parking is fine.  We ended up parking in a garage on Canon.  It was a $5 flat fee, which wasn't too bad.  There were several garages in the area."
Jay J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",142,56,75,4.0,8/5/2015,"Normally not a big fan of this place but I give credit where credit is due. Today the service was good, and I finally found something on the menu that I like. I suggest that everyone try the shrimp w/ angel hair pasta and make sure to get extra sauce. Combine with the house red wine that I had, I was very satisfied. :-)  As everyone knows you can never go wrong with the cheesecake for dessert."
Jnine N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",9,137,,5.0,1/12/2017,"The service is very good.  This is a great spot when the sun is shining.  Love the broiled artichoke appetizer, lemon herb chicken entree, and a nice slice of NY style cheese cake with fresh strawberries.  The good is delicious and the service is pretty good."
Josh W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",15,12,1,3.0,1/13/2016,Got seated right away. Excellent service by Kyle. He was attentive and got everything right the first time. The food was good for the most part. They did somehow royally mess up on one of the two burgers we ordered. Kyle and the manager rectified the problem right away.  I bumped them down to 3 stars because the gentleman that brought the burgers didn't ask who ordered medium and who ordered the well done. The result was someone had half a burger and someone had a burger and a half.
Tyler S.,"Buena Park, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/17/2017,Seated very quickly. Waiter took our drink order right away and offered bread. It was crowded and they were very busy. Appetizers came out fast and we're good! Main items took a little while but nothing out of the ordinary. I got the pizza and it was cooked a little to long. Crust was super hard. My girl got the veggie burger and she said it was great. Will come back for another visit soon to try the steak or burgers.
Lana N.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,114,6,4.0,6/5/2016,"I really like this Cheesecake Factory. There's never a wait and the food is always good! Some of my favorites are: Tex Mex Eggrolls, BBQ chicken salad, chicken piccata, Chinese chicken salad.  Bonus: they allow dogs on the patio!"
Meir H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/20/2017,"This location is smaller compare to their other locations, which makes it nicer. They always seat you very quickly and the service is fast and professional. My favorite item in the menue is their steaks.  If you want something different, try their key lime cheesecake."
Ashley Anastasia F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",62,17,2,1.0,3/17/2016,It's obvious this place is for tourists- evidently they are used to poor service and bad food ! A manager delivered my entree - first off the biscuits were obviously BURNT BLACK - and she still set it down in front of me- my reaction prompted her then to get fresh biscuits - I tried to give the dish a try regardless of the beginning - FIRST BITE OF CHICKEN SO OVERCOOKED IT CRUNCHED IN MY MOUTH!  This restaurant is obviously the root of bad food spread across our country!  Throw in the towel Chessecake Factory - you've ran your course !
Cellie K.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/14/2016,"I've been to a couple Cheesecake Factory locations and this, by far, has to be the worst!  From the moment we were seated in a back corner that felt like there was no running AC, to the 15 minutes we had to wait to have our drink order taken, we should have high tailed it out of there.  Our server was too busy chatting with the table next to us to even bother checking with us after our order was taken.  Our drinks were wrong but we could not flag him down to get things fixed. Our food was even worse and not once did he stop to ask if we needed anything or if our food was ok, which it was not.  I'm so dissapointed because we've never had such horrible service at other locations. Thanks for a horrible afternoon, Cheesecake Factory."
Taylor M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/21/2017,"This was quite possibly the worst service i've ever received. I work at a restaurant so I understand bad days and what not but this was crazy. When we walked in you could tell the host was not excited to seat us, then we had a server, Graham. We ordered our drinks then 15 minutes later (still no drinks) He came to take our order?? (still no drinks) then took our order and 20 mins pass (still no drinks) My bf had to get up and ask another server for our few waters and a couple cokes. We FINALLY got our drinks but still had some missing for another 15 mins, my mom desperately needed a water and didn't receive it until after she got her food. Not to mention that this guy had a horrible attitude and was super disrespectful (slamming things down, etc) And also little things with our food that we made clear to him came out wrong as well. The manager came out without us even asking and she didn't seem to care about what was going on. If he was sweet and apologetic I wouldn't be writing this because again I understand people have bad days but he was just flat out rude and did not have any concern towards our visit. I won't be coming back to this location"
Kate K.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,218,260,2.0,4/20/2014,"I've never thought of Cheesecake Factory as a ""great"" place to begin with, but at least each location is consistently mediocre and reliable - except this one.  We came here because were beyond starving after spending what felt like 5 hours at Z Gallerie a few doors down. There was no wait, and we were seated at a table awkwardly placed in the middle of the tiny front room. Our server, Andrew, who was sweating profusely, greeted us pretty quickly and we ordered an iced tea and a chocolate milkshake while we decided what to eat.  He came back with one water, and explained that the milkshake would be a few minutes since they were making it from scratch - whatever that means. Not a problem, until he came back 5 minutes later with no iced tea in hand and told us again that the milkshake was being made from scratch. When he brought the milkshake out, he apologized that it took so long due to the whole made by scratch getup. We didn't even mind the wait until he kept bringing it up with his weird excuse. We ordered at that point, and received our food a quick 10 minutes later.  Andrew and his runner practically threw our plates onto the table which alarmed us and the other 6 people sitting on top of us before they quickly ran out of the room. The boyfriend's chicken was fine, but my salad was completely soggy. Considering they didn't even ask if everything looked ok, I decided sending it back would be a waste of my time.  Throughout the meal, our server kept grabbing small plates, ramekins and silverware off the table which was so unnecessary and rude considering they weren't very busy, which also made me wonder why he was sweating so much... Nothing could have saved this overpriced experience, as the service, food and atmosphere all seemed doomed from the moment we walked through the door."
Content O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",7,97,,2.0,8/4/2015,"This is by far the WORSE Cheesecake Factory I've been to and it sucks, because it's one of my favorite American Restaurants for: complimentary freshly baked bread, a wide selection of food, good service and lively ambiance.  Why was it so bad? 1.You must pay for parking to eat there. 2.It is too small and crowded. No waiting place. 3.The bathroom is upstairs & a safety hazard.  4. Imagine tripping down the steep flight of stairs!!!! 5.The bathroom flooring is uneven & dangerous. 6. A swinging door can injure someone. 7. My server Lauren was rude and inattentive towards me. 8. Never got the paper napkins & cheese I asked for. 9. I wanted to order 2 more things, but was ignored. 10. I switched to Nicole instead. 11. She's a much better & diligent worker. 12. Nicole was much friendlier, too... :) 13. Nicole gives accurate & fast service... :) Ordered 3 things from the ""Skinnylicious"" Menu: 1. Greek salad: 4 stars 2. Edamame: 3 stars 3. Chicken & Mushroom Wraps: 3.5 stars"
Audrey A.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,235,137,4.0,5/17/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory location is probably the least busiest Cheesecake Factory I have ever encountered! I walked right on in on a Friday night, no wait!   Granted that it is located in Beverly Hills and most people would go to nicer restaurants, I believe Cheesecake Factory is one of the more family friendly options in the vicinity. Parking - Cheesecake Factory valets for $7 which is ridiculous! If you are coming after 8pm, look for free metered street parking or you can find free lots a block or two down. As for the food, it's the typical Cheesecake Factory food.  I am fan of their Chicken Marsala dish.  I'm not a big cheesecake person, but their Mango Key Lime Cheescake is pretty good! Tip: At the end of your receipt, look for a survey, I got a $10 ecard for filling it out!  The cliente is pretty mixed - date nights, families and kids. If I am ever in the mood for the Cheesecake Factory, I am definitely coming to this location!"
