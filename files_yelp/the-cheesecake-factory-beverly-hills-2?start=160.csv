Fransiska A.,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",1,18,67,4.0,5/18/2015,Oreo cheesecake is awesome! Even looking at it makes my mouth watery... In a good drooling kind of way. Their bacon bacon cheeseburger is so good and juicy; I'm a self confessed bacon lover. Spaghetti carbonara was okay; a bit bland so wouldn't recommend it. Tropical ice tea was thirst quenching!
Ed E.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,111,6,3.0,6/6/2016,"I used to love this place and could eat there every day, but lately it just isn't the same as it was.  I realize this is a very complex restaurant to manage.  The menu is so large and the service so demanding it's amazing they do what they do. But this location seems to be neglected by management.   The service was so very slow I waked out after 40 minutes and went to a restaurant across the street.  I know the CEO of the company and know how much pride he takes in his restaurants, but just maybe the smallest and oldest one of his collection has fallen off his radar.  David, you might want to check it out every once in a while.  I know three stars to you is unacceptable, but there is a need for improvement."
Ally S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",112,134,86,4.0,4/9/2015,Food was typical franchise. But the staff was GREAT!!! Especially the bartender!!! Soo busy and im amazed they dont add an extra bartender to assist back there. He was very kind and attentive. Red velvet cheese cake of course is the best ending  12pm
JIll S.,"Santa Monica, CA",19,11,1,1.0,12/14/2016,"The food was good as usual. We ordered our food and drinks and then never saw our server again, ever. I had to ask another server to give our check so we can leave. I asked him what happened and he replies our server had to step outside. Andrew was our server, don't know what happened but hope you're okay. It was a very strange experience, we never got refills as we asked."
Stuart B.,"New York, NY",1164,572,39,3.0,5/11/2014,I learned that this was the first cheesecake factory.  I went here in the 70's as a kid and remembered ordering pumpkin cheesecake which I found way too rich. Today we went in at around 2:00 PM and had no wait (which I always find rare in most cheesecake factories)  We had a nice big table.  Service was very good.  I was happy to see they have a lower cal menu because I saw all those horror stories about their dished being a billion calories.  I had a skinny burger and salad.  My gf had a turkey burger with salad.  We split a slice strawberry cheesecake which was not too rich.
Alex B.,"Aurora, CO",18,6,,5.0,5/28/2016,Food was great and service too! I had the happy hour burger which came out delicious also the hostess took care of me along with the waiter. They ensured that I had a pleasant experience for my visit. Will be coming back if I'm in the area.
Anthony G.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,42,24,1.0,8/11/2015,They weren't kidding when they said this was the worst.  Waiter was impatient taking orders and left the table Waiter didn't write down my request for added sun dried tomatoes My Alfredo pasta was stuck together In laws pasta was al dente  The kid's burger was requested well done yet it was somehow half rare and half medium (wtf). The waiter Kurt saw the bright red meat but didn't take the time to address it. The waiter also bumped me at least three times and didn't say a thing. Upon leaving the bus boy opened the door for me yet let it close in my in laws face. I also don't think they like middle eastern people there. When we came in a middle eastern table was waiting and waiting for their change. They just ended up leaving after maybe twenty minutes. The smaller couple of two that sat next to us was also treated poorly. The man apparently tried to use a translator with the waiter and was told he was going to have to speak. The place is also cramped and the main restrooms are upstairs.
Kat N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",628,64,9,4.0,5/13/2016,"Like any normal cheesecake factory, they always good about getting to you and giving you time to figure out their big menu. Our waiter was very nice and was always check back on us. I got the Cesar salad and it was delicious! Cheesecake factory is always really good and never disappoints!"
Misha K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,33,30,1.0,3/19/2016,"Disappointing! Came here because everyone told me it's a must-go, but it was so disappointing to me. I had the mango key limes cheesecake, because I thought it might taste fresh and I don't like whipped cream. But they brought it with whipped cream all over the cake and even under the cream it was just a heavy, artificial and over sweetened wannabe cheesecake. My friend had the one with macadamia nuts and white chocolate. We both weren't able to finish it and we didn't even want to because it's not nice at all. It's also way too expensive for that kind of quality."
Tiffany T.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,261,111,2.0,2/15/2014,"Not impressed. I came here for dinner, thank goodness it wasn't for a majorly planned Valentine's dinner. I would have been disappointed. I am shocked that this location would be so ghetto. It was smaller than most Cheesecake Factory restaurants that I have been to, half the employees looked sloppy, were too loud, and not very clean cut, and the environment just felt very stuffy.  The food was good but the atmosphere was very disappointing. It kind of reminded of being in an unfamiliar city or state at a restaurant that was trying to be nice but isn't really that nice.  You would think with this being the Beverly Hills location that it would be at the top of the charts. The service was fake. Not genuine at all. Very dry energy. There was one point when he came to the table on his way to the kitchen and said ""Everything ok here? Ok good"". He never stopped at the table. He just said it as he walked by. If you can stand the wait, I'd say go to the location at the Grove. There are plenty of shops and sights to see while you wait for your table to be ready. I hope this review helps you decide on where to go for dinner! :)"
Robert S.,"Santa Monica, CA",39,110,107,1.0,2/28/2015,Is it legal to serve alcohol with children when they are sitting at a bar the Bartender is serving  alcohol check out the pic's
Matthew E.,"Beverly Hills, CA",369,8,,5.0,7/10/2016,"My favorite Go-to spot for amazing meals! Delicious, A+ service, affordable prices, and awesome ambiance. Cheesecake NEVER disappoints. Highly Recommended.  Only warning: Most meals are very calorie rich, so take a look at the calorie menu if you are concerned."
Ness S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,156,386,4.0,6/16/2014,"My love brought me here for my birthday June 15 and it was really nice very busy due to it being father's day so the wait was about 35 min to be seated, I really like the decor,ambiance,with the murals above really nice restaurant. Food was delicious I had the Jamaican peppered shrimp,rice,black beans with the side of mango salsa that sets it off yum. At the end they sang happy birthday which caught me off guard (bf used the using the restroom to inform them) lol it was all good though I would love to eat here again. Note:Atl has them beat on ambiance and decor more well lit."
Jane F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,44,,2.0,6/15/2016,"Ordered for pick up over $200 worth of food.  Chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  And when we ordered two days later and mentioned it, they said we need to bring the food back to verify for credit.   We eat there three times a week for lunch and they dealt with us the wrong way.  They know who we are and they didn't take care of us.  I wonder if their food is all frozen and they microwave everything because it has a taste that just isn't fresh and some items are raw in the center.  BTW, what are their eggs made of, really?"
K R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,32,,3.0,5/24/2016,"I love cheesecake factory, but this location needs to be remodeled. Bathroom is smelly and the area around it. I think they keep the lighting low and dark so you don't see how shabby the place has become. I would really appreciated if they close for a month or two and remodel and clean up the place. :(  As many other cheesecake factories, there is long waiting time. I wish they would update their system and text you when ur table is ready.  Parking is bad, so we end up not going there bc of wait and parking."
Nina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,407,1100,4.0,3/9/2015,"They basically will be downgraded to 4 stars because every time  I have been there I almost fell, I'm assuming that it's because their kitchen is open to the walk way, their floors are always SUPER slippery, they all wear tennis shoes and maybe don't realize it, but I guess until someone falls and seriously hurts themselves, that's when they will actually do something about it"
Michelle C.,"Tarzana, CA",84,19,8,3.0,4/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory usually doesn't disappoint but this particular location wasn't the best experience. I want to give tremendous credit to our server, however, as he was patient and smiling through all my ""concerns"" ;). The food, as usual, was very good: Fried Mac n Cheese with the marinara sauce and a lovely salmon salad! What I'm reviewing is the overall ambiance and vibe. It was very very cold and exceptionally dark where they sat us. And we moved from our first spot where the table was right in the middle if mainstream traffic. Service, though nice, was slow. For Beverly Hills, it seems they would be a bit more environment conscious and service oriented ;)"
Peter Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/30/2015,"My server Vito gave us the most amazing customer service! I love the cheesecake Factory and I've gone to all the ones in LA, The thing that stood out in the one in Beverly Hills was my server Vito's customer service. My girl and I enjoyed our food as usual but our server was extremely nice and anticipated everything we wanted. His attention to detail and pleasant demeanor made our dinning experience a memorable one. I think this will be our go to spot for the Cheesecake Factory. I would totally recommend this place and I hope Vito is your server when you go cause having a server anticipate before you ask is the best!"
Briggite B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/29/2016,"Ive been to severl locations and this one was the worst. I came in a couple years back for valetines day and I had the worst service because I had an amercian woman waitress and she judged us by our clothes and our ethnicity.  She was so nice and helpful to the white couple eating next to us and would just walk passed us without asking if we needed anything else or a refill. She was horrible. She even offered to box the food to go for the couple next to us and then when I asked for a box to go she left the box on the corner of the table and walked away. didn't even offer. Worst service experience I ever had in Beverly hills or los angeles. The hosts were very kind and wait time was not too long, but since that experience I have never gone back to that location! I didn't even leave her a tip because she was so terrible. and im a server myself in fine dining catering. I always tip25%. she got 0% and caused us to never go back for that reason. The food is okay there. Not worth putting up with servers with that mentality to judge a book by its cover."
Kara K.,"San Diego, CA",574,414,127,5.0,5/3/2014,"Jason was fantastic! He was so patient, so personal and just seems like a kind person.  Our food was great, as usual at Cheesecake; very consistent.  The valet parking was very nice.   I just can't get over how awesome Jason was.... I hope there is only one Jason, but just in case we sat across from the bar next to where the servers pass through to the other side around 9-10pm!  (There was 3 of us).  He helped personalize out meals perfectly!  Great service always gets 5 stars!"
