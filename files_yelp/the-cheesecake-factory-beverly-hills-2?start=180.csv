Heather F.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,129,386,2.0,6/17/2014,"The food here is very unspecial. Came here recently for a friend's birthday and ordered a cobb salad. Was one of the worst cobbs I've had in recent memory - probably cause they used a dressing other than ranch which (imo) goes so perfectly with cobb. Happened to eat a cobb two days earlier from Specialty's and that salad was far superior in quality of ingredients and it's not even a dine-in restaurant! Their saving grace is the cheesecake of course. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I tried the banana creme and the white chocolate raspberry and both were really delicious. Basically, just go here for cheesecake. Eat real food elsewhere."
Joseph M.,"West Hollywood, CA",296,8,39,5.0,4/22/2016,"This Beverly Hills location is the original and first Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  Service is great, it's a smaller space than the typical Cheesecake Factory, but it's clean and intimate.  Valet parking is available and the neighborhood has great shops that you can walk to after dinner or dessert.  The Chicken Bellagio is my favorite dish here...a must try!"
Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2279,807,1539,3.0,8/12/2013,"I was not a fan of everything  on my most recent visit here. Food and drinks were good (love the tex-mex eggroll appetizers) however service was lacking. The waiter was hurried and disinterested and coming to the table a few times and going ""need another cocktail?"" does not equal good service. Cheesecake was bomb!"
Bey M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",11,11,,5.0,11/26/2015,"Where can I start? I order way more than I can eat in this place because I can't decide out of the huge menu. Avocado egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls, veggie burger with the side of fries, the Oreo cheesecake are my current favorites. I used to have the little crispy chicken sandwich before I stopped eating meat. I think it's the best dish on the menu.I take a bite from everything and take all the leftovers home:) The portions are huge. And everything tastes good. The service is great."
Elaine V.,"Temecula, CA",14,51,105,5.0,4/16/2015,"Since the time I walked into Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills service was amazing!  I sat at the bar, still on the phone my server Kevin M gave me the respect to wait to ask me what I'd like to drink until I was finished. I got the buffalo blasts! They were amazing as well! I had a request for a personal pasta which normally people don't do so I was very impressed with this level of service. I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory but now I LOVE it and will be back!"
Superhot T.,"Inglewood, CA",200,24,21,2.0,4/9/2015,"PLEASE READ Oh my God I cannot believe the service that I received here the other day! This is a location that I normally visit but the waitress was so unpleasant this day. We ordered stuff mushrooms and they were horrible, the waitress did not apologize nor did a manager ever come over to say anything about the mushrooms that were so unpleasant. My colleague and I ordered shrimp scampi to go. However when I got home and ate my shrimp scampi..the shrimp a bit rancid. I stop eating the shrimp and proceeded to call a manager (Blake) at that location, letting him know that our service was not that pleasant from the waitress (Kelly), And ""the shrimp scampi that I ordered to go... the shrimp were a bit rancid, or maybe not being that fresh"". He asked me ""how did you pay for the meal""! I calmly let him know ""I was on lunch and one of my colleagues treated"".  He said that he would inform his kitchen and talk to the waiter. He never apologize for the horrible customer service, or for the fact of the scampi being unpleasant to my palate. He asked me ""can I help you with anything else"". I said yes ""I'd appreciate a compensation, or I can bring the meal back if you want"" he later told me ""you did not pay for the meal I don't see what's the problem""!  I sat on the phone with my mouth wide-open for seconds.... I COOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SPEAKING THAT WAY TO A CUSTOMER!!!!!!  I called the next day to speak to another manager which was quite more pleasant, and very forgiving for my horrible service. He was so taken back and offered to send a gift card out for his apologies.  THANKS RICARDO  DR. S. WALKER M.D I gave two stars because I appreciate the managers efforts to send out the gift-card.  The drink was great, my Greek salad was great, and the chicken samosas were good as well."
Luis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,18,121,3.0,6/4/2014,"I've been here quite a few times but I must really say that this time I was impressed with the service. It had been a while since I'd gone into the Cheesecake Factory so the mrs suggested we try it again. It was a little past two and there seem to be a line. However, as we approached the hostess she asked us if we were with the much larger group, she peeked into one if the rooms and went on to show us to our table.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by Chris who provided us with the daily special. He asked us for drinks and was very prompt on bringing it to us. He even have us two orders of bread without asking After we received our order which I must say took a while we checked on from time to time. A definite overall good experience. Thank u Chris."
Tanya D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",179,118,237,4.0,11/26/2014,"Food was just like any other Cheesecake Factory. We went during lunch time and were seated immediately. Our drink order was quickly placed, so we were glad about that, especially since we did a lot of walking. Now, here is where it gets a little tough, we had to request bread a few times before the waiter brought it out, and the waiter  seemed a bit preoccupied or something. It didn't really bother us at the time, however in completing my review, I like to be honest and that could be the drawback to why I did not give 5 stars. We also had to request our check a couple of times, and this is huge when you paid for metered parking and the time is close to end, and you are parked far. Food wise, we always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory food, so no complaints there. The location is good. I wish they had more patio seating in the front, its designed not for a family or group, but for 2 people or 3 not as endowed people. Oh well, just a thought.  Honestly, if service was just a bit better, it would have been 5 stars. We still had an overall good experience!"
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,4.0,5/12/2011,"Don't care what others say -- I like this place.  I especially like it now because you can figure out something vegan to eat. I got the Luau Salad.  It was an enormous pile of lettuce, with chopped nuts, shredded carrots, green onions, chopped peppers, beans and bits of other things.  It's served with chicken so I got that wrapped up and took it home to Joey.  I used a little of their balsamic dressing, which was very nice and not oily. Benji had her usual crab cakes, which are always good but a little too breaded, it looks like.  Lee had the weightwatcher salad with chicken, with asparagus and a light dressing. Then of course they had to get a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake to take home.  And did we open it to take a bit?  Yes indeedy.  Oooo.... the absolutely epitome of a smooth, velvety delicious piece of very un-cheesecake-like cheesecake -- it really just tasted like mousse.  Yum. Parked next to the Crate and Barrel."
Jack Y.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,70,,5.0,11/15/2014,"The sign of GREAT service is highlighted when a manager on duty recognizes a mess up and fixes it with graciousness and professionalism. We arrived for a b-day celebration with a prearranged reservation for a party of 8. Host declares that he does not see a reservation on his screen but he would try to get us a table when one becomes available. Not satisfies with his run of the mill generic answer we ask for a manager.  Blake arrived with a positive and caring can-do attitude. Had us seated within 15 minutes with a some on-the house appies quickly delivered.  Class act. Food is the standard fair at CCF. Fresh, huge portions that are pretty good. 5 stars mainly for the great service and attitude."
Sylvanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,52,23,3.0,1/25/2014,"For a venue located in the heart of Beverly Hills, or better yet Los Angeles, I applaud it's use of space.  There's not much space in the surrounding area and this little restaurant chain is located in a busy street, but it still feels spacious inside.  Service is fast, food is what you expect of the cheesecake factory, and it's the only Cheesecake Factory I know around West LA so yeah... I'm a fan.  5 stars would be parking that wasn't such a pain."
Bruce H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,69,,2.0,12/10/2015,"What's happened to The Cheesecake Factory? Food still delicious but have they cut their portions in half. We ordered food to go and I got chicken madeira one of my favorites. The portion was probably half the size of what it use to be. Also, got my son chicken strips kid portion---and either this was a mistake or they just stopped giving decent sized portions.  Once was a great place to go for great food and huge portions but the portion size is no longer what it use to be."
Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411,4.0,5/5/2013,"Whenever I venture across the border, a visit to a Cheesecake Factory is always part of the plan, mainly because we don't have them in Canada and secondly the food has always been good. You know you're going to get a great meal, reasonably priced, huge portion size, combined with the largest assortment of cheesecakes on the planet. This location bills itself as the original location of a franchise that now has restaurants in most major US cities. It's location...in Beverly Hills, one block from Rodeo Drive, is ideal. We found parking on the street ($2/hr), but noticed several parking lots in the area with decent rates. We were seated immediately (in Buffalo the wait can be upwards of an hour) and then the real challenge begins...what to order from their HUGE menu. We opted for the Orange Chicken (lightly battered white chicken pieces, smothered in an orange sauce, with veggies and brown rice) and  Cashew Chicken (lightly battered chicken pieces in a spicy asian sauce with brown rice)....both were $16.99 each. The portion size is gigantic.....the chicken must have been two full breasts cut into pieces....rich in flavour with a great balance of orange flavour. Our server, Lauren R was great. She was attentive, friendly and very efficient. The table next to us were a real pain and she kept her cool through every interaction she had with them. Kudos to her. If you're fortunate enough to have room left over after dinner, a piece of cheesecake is in order. I've tried approx. 6 or 7 different kinds, with my favourite being the Key Lime Cheesecake (or what I prefer to call a slice of heaven here on earth). I usually take my dessert to go as I'm always full from dinner. I really have only two minor complaints about this location: 1) the tables are very close together...so private conversations are not possible (and as a side note to the two dudes seated next to us)..it is a courtesy, when eating out, that you chew your food with your mouth closed, not talk with your mouth full, use utensils, etc, etc. 2) my biggest complaint......please open a restaurant in Toronto.....we need a Cheesecake Factory there. Great value for great food."
Darrell S.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,149,248,4.0,1/14/2015,"Go sit at the bar with Michael, he's usually there, good happy hour and outdoor seating with free parking for 2 hours right across the street"
Michele N.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,4,,5.0,10/1/2016,"Came here on accident because I couldn't find Sunset bl. But there was no wait, drinks were out in under 5mins.  When our food came there was a little mix up. The parade of people who came to apologize was amazing!!! Starting with our server Salina who was explaining what happen. My mom was so not bothered just hungry (lol) then came Victor with more apologizes lol I would just like to thank them for making my mom feel special. She is so use to taking care of everyone else I think she got nervous with all the attention. And the extra taco made it all worth it!!!"
Gonzalo C.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",1,35,8,5.0,11/19/2015,Our experience here was a great one! From the start our server Nicole W. made us feel welcome! She delivered an outstanding customer service and was awesome! I hope every server in every restaurant could be like her!
Marcelo F.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,11,,4.0,10/16/2014,"I love this location. Only thing that sucks is the parking, but hey its Beverly Hills, right? Last time i ate here was to have a little celebration with a good friend. The host said we would have to wait about 20 minutes but ten minutes later our table was ready! I had the fried shrimp platter and chicken pasta. The shrimp was delicious and not too greasy. The pasta was yummy, a touch of lemon, not too salty. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a full five stars is the service. Our waiter took a while to get to our table and then he kept disappearing whenever we needed him. Good thing another guy kept checking on us and even offered me cheese without me asking. Yes ill be back."
Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",528,337,1552,2.0,2/14/2013,"What happened to this location??? I remember enjoying it about 5 years ago, but after dish after dish of disappointment and bad service (and possibly bad luck), I've decided to write a review for this Cheesecake Factory location.  I used to looooooove cheesecake factory. The environment looked very nice, and they have great variety, as well as amazing cheesecakes. Service used to be better, but my recent experiences were just the opposite.  This is from my most recent experience: We got in and waited, but no one was there to greet and seat us. Once someone came by, we got seated quickly, which was good. The waitress said that she can take our baby's stroller away and bring us a high chair. The bf collapsed the stroller to save room, but it took nearly ten minutes for the high chair to come.  Our orders were taken, and she said that she will bring us our bread and butter. That never showed up. Other tables got bread and butter, but we did not. We also were not offered refills of water.  It took a long time for our appetizer to come out. We got the buffalo wings that day because I wanted something spicy, and we can feed chicken to our little one. Once we were done with the wings, we waited nearly half an hour for our entrees to show up. Ahhh.. that means we had to pay for parking in that 2 hour free lot, since we waited so much already!  Anyways, the buffalo wings were just decent. Not worth the money. The sauce tasted great, but the meat itself was just super dry. I've had better from Domino's. Quite depressing, huh?  So our entrees finally came. We ordered the grilled chicken kids meal for the little one, the burrito for the bf, and the chinese chicken salad for myself. The kids meal was a total rip off. Our little one refused to eat any of it! She normally loves chicken, but she kept spitting it out. UGH!! Oh, it was just super dry. Gross.  My salad looked smaller than the other times I've ordered it. Maybe I should have stuck with a sandwich or a burger. The salad was drenched and all disgusting, as if it was just sitting out there for at least half an hour. There was only a few small pieces of chicken inside. TOTAL RIPOFF! It used to be great, but that salad to price ratio was the worst ever. Other chains, such as cpk, now offers better chinese chicken salads. Sorry, cheesecake factory... what happened to yours?? I would have ordered the tuna tataki salad, but I'm pregnant again, soooo that was out of the question for uber safety issues.  At least the bf's burrito was decent. The presentation was one long burrito on an oval plate with sauce and tomatoes on top of it. It was the most worthwhile thing we got that day. It came with a side of guacamole, sour cream, and black beans.  Sooooo.... overall, Cheesecake Factory has declined a lot. Portions used to be bigger, service used to be better, and I've always got my free bread and butter, but that experience... nope. Horrible. Just horrible. I was lucky that I paid mostly in giftcards because if I were to use my own hard earned cash at this place, I'd be super pissed. Sad that the San Vincente location in west LA closed.. *SIGH*  In the past, I've tried the following:  tons of fun burger (decent), chicken enchiladas (yum), veggie burger (decent), mushroom burger (way too greasy), chicken teriyaki (too many fat chunks), chicken picatta (second grossest thing I've had here), pulled pork sandwich (lacking the meats quite a bit), fish tacos (okay), tuna takaki salad (probably my favorite entree, but such a small portion), the navajo (good sandwich), chicken sandwich (okay), fish and chips (use extra sauce and ketchup in case of dryness), lettuce wraps (used to be better as well), chicken pot stickers (so small!), avocado eggrolls (meh), and more.  I've also tried most their cheesecake menu, and those at least were always par or better. My faves are the vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and tiramisu. I will be trying their mango keylime tonight, since I got it to go. When I'm not pregnant anymore, I'll probably just return for drinks (MOJITO!!!!) and cheesecake."
Kris N.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,19,2.0,3/22/2015,"First time dining-in and we sat in the patio area. The table appeared as though it was not cleaned thoroughly. The appetizer plates were dirty and one of the plates had a piece of lettuce leaf on the outer rim. When the water cups arrived there were white particles floating around. Needless to say, we asked the waitress for replacements. The second round of water arrived only to experience the same issue, unknown substance in the water. This time there was a large piece of what appears to be a napkin floating in one of the cups. We finally asked for a manager to address the issue about the cleanliness of their water. He apologized, brought us new cups of water but again the same issue. Our meal was fine but it could of had a more pleasant beginning."
Gregory P.,"Bakersfield, CA",19,17,5,4.0,4/2/2015,"I got the Mac and cheese burger and it was fantastic. Everyone got their food in a timely manner and the proportions were solid. The burger was delicious, well seasoned and cooked to order. It did feel like it needed a little something extra on it, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. The only bad part of this Cheesecake Factory is the men's bathroom was tiny. It felt like an airplane bathroom and the floor felt slippery."
