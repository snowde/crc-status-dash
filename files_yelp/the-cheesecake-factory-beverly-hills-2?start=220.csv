Eric K.,"Indio, CA",2,20,3,5.0,10/3/2015,Best service I've ever experienced and great food!! Avocado egg rolls are a must try.
Lana B.,"New York, NY",7,59,14,1.0,4/21/2015,"So my best friend and I are waiting for my take out right next to the kitchen and there's a burger and fries and a separate order of onion rings waiting for the waiter to come and take it to the table. It's 2:36pm on Tuesday April 21 and the manager keeps walking back and forth and picking up this customers onion rings and eating them. Two onion rings were attached to each other and she separated them and put one back on the plate, ate it, then licked her fingers and ate someone else's French fries. Omg I'm disgusted this place eats half your food before you eat it! Come to find out she is a manager (Natasha - had to ask)... EW!!"
Ann S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6,88,178,1.0,2/12/2016,"Half of a cockroach came out of my Shrimp and Arugula pasta 1.5 years ago. I have been too traumatized to post anything about it till now. How could I be so selfish and not alert other Yelpers? Well, cause I chewed it before I realized it was not the same texture of my pasta. What did I do? I ran to the restroom and threw up for a good 15 minutes. Then I cried. Then I threw up again. Then I started doing this weird shaking thing while crying. While I was doing this pitiful and dreadful routine, my mother was alerting management. What did the manager do? She waited for me to come back, apologized profusely and then offered me a free cheesecake. I did not want the possibly cockroach contaminated cheesecake. I just sat there with snot coming down my nose and swollen red eyes baffled at the whole situation. Then my brain went into autopilot mode and I just quietly walked out of the restaurant while the manager kept apologizing and saying our meal was covered. I don't blame the manager, which is why my mother and I did not go off on her. How could she have known? Either way, it was a traumatic experience. I laugh about it now with only a slight urge to throw up now. Thank you for the experience, Cheesecake Factory. I have not ate at this branch or any of the Cheesecake branches since then."
Carolin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,50,45,5.0,8/18/2015,"I am nearly there everyday for lunch. This place has become my second home. There service is great, the staff that work there are awesome . For people who have never eat here, you must try it out once, they have varieties of different food  selections, and of course there chessecake are to die for."
Kam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,12,,1.0,3/23/2015,"This was my childhood FAVORITE restaurant which I always found to be consistently good, but unfortunately my experience last night DESTROYED all of my preconceived happy notions of the place.  First off, our waiter, who designated himself as an esteemed ""trainer"" who travels to all the new Cheesecake factories to train staff took 10 minutes just to come over and take our drink order.  Then, after his pompous speech about how great he is, he reluctantly came back another 10 minutes later to take our order.  ANOTHER 30 minutes passed, and I complained about not having even gotten our appetizers.   ""Shockingly"" our esteemed and self-identified expert Cheesecake factory waiter FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN!!!! 15 minutes pass, a very inexperienced manager came over to DEFEND himself rather than apologize, and sent us a completely wrong appetizer order! and again, instead of apologizing, the manager once again comes over to defend himself saying he didn't bother to look at our ticket order and just ran the food out.  As icing on the cake, the appetizer nachos were even dry, overcooked and COLD! Because my friend had just gotten off a 13 hour shift and hadn't eaten, we took the manager on his word that our entrees would come out right away as we ordered.  A few minutes later (an hour into waiting for food so far) the food comes out, and again the completely wrong order and ICE COLD!!! Once again, in the same manner as before, both the general manager and the waiter just stood by idly and had NO APOLOGIES WHATSOEVER for their horrible service.   I am shocked and appalled by their disgusting behavior and lack of managerial and serving skills, particularly due to the fact that instead of apologizing they threw needless defenses at us, and I will definitely think THREE times before anyone mentions again there again. Shame on them for ruining my night and happy thoughts of this place."
Anne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,2.0,8/12/2015,"Food tends to be fairly consistently good. I find that the server makes a very big difference in your overall experience here.  When we've had seasoned servers who make sure your meal is served correctly, asks if you have everything you need, refills beverages, is attentive, etc.  However, last week our party of 3, had a server with a very blasé attitude from start to finish. Constantly had to flag her down,as the busboy would pass the table and pretend he didn't hear us politely asking for more water.  The times I've had experienced servers that were truly interested that everyone was enjoying their meals, made all the difference in the dining experience and satisfaction.   Management needs to send in some ""secret diners"" and refine the training or replace the staff that truly don't want to be there."
Kat R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,17,3,2.0,11/9/2015,"DIRTY DISHES THE FOOD IS SERVED ON! From the tea, utensils to the plates, every single piece was dirty. Requested new clean dishes and no correction has been made. I want to throw up!"
Susan H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,2,4.0,9/27/2015,Inviting and warm service. The omelet with mushroom and bacon is a must-try! Their tropical smoothie helps release all the summer heat.
Mark L.,"Canterbury, New Zealand",7,23,44,2.0,1/29/2014,"Great locations and decor and friendly enough staff, but for me the service was too rushed - meals were brought over while some on our table were still working their way through the starters - and the meals themselves were just far too large. The sliders I had for my starter were four almost standard size burgers. Then the main meal came and I barely made a dent in it.  Perhaps wouldn't be too bad if you knew in advance they were that large and then you just bought one to share between two, but that feels a bit pointless. Also, the menu was huge. Possibly the largest I've ever seen. So large that it stopped for an ad break from time to time. Point for awesome looking desserts (that I never got to trying as the starter had filled me up already) and another point for amazing value. But cheap meals and oversized portions aren't for me. Could have charged the same price for meals half the size, and shortened the menu by a good 5 pages, and it would be fantastic."
Richard L.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/31/2014,"We went to Cheesecake Factory Beverly Hills with a fair degree of anticipation, the first night we were told a 40 minute wait, have a couple of drinks in the bar, yeah right, if I'm hungry I want my dinner, now. We went elsewhere that night, but returned the next night.  The service was rushed and in-attentive, the entree of crumbed Calamari was definitely the worst I have EVER had, dry, stringy, floury, a major disappointment.  The main of herb salmon was OK, too much mashed potato, however I gave it my best effort. The reason to go there was desserts, but after a terrible entree, and an average but too large main, it was all over for me, get me out of this place !!"
John T.,"Rosemead, CA",185,92,139,4.0,3/13/2014,"I do pickup orders for lunch for my company at least once a month. I really like the different kinds of items the menu offers. There are literally a trillion things on this menu! I don't know how the chefs do it! I have worked in Beverly Hills for about 6 years and I always try something different every time. But one thing that always strikes me is their cheesecake. I love their cheesecake, hence their name. They have so much variety and you seriously can't go wrong with choosing any of them from the menu, unless you don't like cheesecake!  The employees at the pickup area are always extra nice. The orders are always ready in a timely matter. The orders are easy to place over the phone, I just wished they open a little earlier given that someone of us at our company take early lunches. One thing I really dislike about the place is the parking, there are only 1-2 parking spaces that indicate ""Pick-up Only"" and they're always filled! Then I would have to find metered parking and pay for about 10 minutes. One star is dinged for parking I will keep coming here monthly!"
J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,32,,3.0,7/17/2014,"Came here for a date at 9:30 at night. Left at 11:45, and when we left there were still plenty of people here albeit dwindling down. Great atmosphere. Great food. But pricey. We got two mixed drinks (Tennessee Tea, Mojito and a dish of fries. 26 bucks.   Everything was delicious and fun, and warm (for sitting outside) but still, 26 bucks? Whatever. Its one of the few places open past 10pm in Beverly Hills and we had a great time."
Cheri L.,"Pomona, CA",5,25,18,2.0,2/13/2015,"Beware, of a Jack Black look alike guy with a tie that works in the frontline. He might secretly pick at your food and discreetly eat it. I caught him twice! It was interesting to watch but also very gross. EEEUUUUUWWW!!!"
Nannette P.,"Marietta, GA",44,54,9,3.0,6/18/2015,I love their lettuce wrap.   The best I've ever had.   Parking is a bit of a problem.   Service is good.
Trish C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,90,47,4.0,5/19/2014,"Contrary to some of the reviews on here, we received excellent service. Came in for lunch and ordered off their skinnylicious menu, which has a lot of great options - including a refreshing skinnylicious mojito and margarita! The burger was good, I like the bun - comes with side salad.  For tourists: this is the 1st/original cheesecake factory restaurant."
Bill B.,"Winter Park, FL",21,244,18,3.0,5/23/2015,"Came for dinner. Sat at the bar. Good choice.  Being alone I could watch TV and get as much to drink as desired. (Only drink soda water with lime).  Bar tender is attentive, meal comes out quickly, food is great.  In fact I was unsure of which steak to order.  Bartender recommend hanger steak.  Good choice!"
Mark H.,"San Diego, CA",77,193,70,3.0,2/14/2014,"Had the spicy cashew chicken for an early dinner.  I thought the coating/batter on the outside of the chicken was just a bit too soft. At the Cheesecake Factory in fashion valley (San Diego) it's more crispy and fresh. Still, the one in BH is passable. The Caesar salad was flavorful but the lettuce was too wilted for my taste. Could have been much better. I've been to this location on several occasions and I always make sure that I sit out front near the sidewalk. The people watching is outstanding.  Our server, Kurt/Curt, was new and you could tell. He was nervous. And he made sure that he told us that he was new. He handled our orders just fine but he struggled mightily with our neighbor (a 20-year veteran of the BH location). The woman asked for X and he brought Y. Customer pointed out that Y was not X. Tried again but this time the server brought A instead of X. The customer was clearly growing tired and impatient with the new server. The server eventually got it right, though. Anyhow, felt sorry for the guy. Hopefully he's given a chance to improve and excel. All and all, very middle of the road experience.  I'll give them another chance in the near future."
Homan F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/11/2015,Omg I can't believe these people. First let's start that my wife and friend got food poisoning from here. After years for my daughter's b day we decided to try it here. Came early told the useless person in front that we will be 10 people and he said the table would be ready soon. After 30 min when I asked for the table he said that he made a mistake and had gave the table to other people. No sorry no nothing if anything he kept giving me attitude and had a smile of haha.
Jan D.,"Buena Park, CA",844,843,16,4.0,10/7/2011,"I am always a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.. Yes, it is a major chain, but it is goood.. :) I recommend the deep fried macaroni and cheese balls or the mac and cheese burger. It is delish and heavy, so come with an empty stomach and sched. a cardio the next day. hehe. I like this Cheesecake Factory the best, but I believe it is all in all good."
Z P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/13/2016,Highly recommended. The best quality hamburgers around (mashroom burger) and in general a lot of variety of huge and delicious plates.  Worthy every cents
