Vicky C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",1,60,86,5.0,6/28/2015,Stopped by for a little appetizer. We ordered the Asian chicken tacos that were great. We also ordered the walnut and pear flat bread. Service was great.
Esther P.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",358,96,2,4.0,4/15/2015,"The service here fluctuates, but the food is always on par. The wait here can be long on weekends but it isn't too bad. Good place to take someone on a date since the food is affordable yet you are still in the heart of the glitz and glam of Beverly Hills so you still feel fabu~"
Kai H.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,99,2,4.0,4/15/2015,"The menu is huge.  I generally have a good meal here but i always have to wait.  Nice to take it to go. This place is kinda pricey, so keep that in mind.  There is so much variety here it always takes me a while to decide what i want.  I am not a fan of cheese cakes, so this is not really a place for me, but my wife loves it."
Jen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,770,58,1.0,11/22/2015,"This location was horrible. Normally I wont review chain restaurants but this place can be my exception. We were in west hollywood and wanted to grab some dinner so we came here. First of all, the area is a little upscale so I felt a little out of place from the start. We were seated right away, but the wait staff was a little slow. They were too busy attending the table next to us which from the start gave me really bad vibes. There was an older gentleman there who had a lot of complaints and even called over the manager and gave him a very very very specific order for just a cheeseburger. Anyways, it took a while to get some service and once we did we were ready to order. We got out food, but never got any water refills until later when we had already asked. Out waitress was nowhere to be found for the remaining of our dinner. I was disappointed and just urked by the environment and the entire restaurant. We are all paying customers and should all be treated fairly. Anyways, if you're thinking of going for a bite to eat, don't come here."
Anonymous S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",9,12,,1.0,12/30/2014,Horrible customer service. We had the worst waiter ever. She was so rude. Over charged me. First and last time at cheesecake factory.
Deryck R.,"Los Angeles, CA",556,165,16,5.0,2/19/2014,"I do pickup orders from here all the time for lunch. The pickup employees are always extra nice. The orders are always ready in a timely matter. The orders are easy to place over the phone. I really like the different kinds of items the menu offers, too. I got the salmon rolls today, and they were so delicious. I also like that you get bread with your meal. It's just a nice little gesture to add it to the order. Definitely going to go here more often for lunch."
IMshaari A.,"Santa Cruz, CA",20,12,9,1.0,5/10/2014,The service is awful!! This is my second visit to this location and the service hasn't improved!! WTF ?!  long time to get your order!! Almost half hour to get a cheesecake !!!! The only reason to give it a star is the service otherwise the quality of the food as usual ! I hope the person in charge would see this review to make any improvement !  I'm fan of cheesecake and it's disappointed to experience this kind of service in Cheesecake Factory !! My suggestion is to find any nearby branch of Cheesecake Factory other than this one !
Christina P.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,3,3.0,6/29/2015,This is not the first time I'm sitting in this restaurant every time I come for the food and wonderful service. I do not know why but today the food was delicious but the service was bad. The waitress was not very nice and courteous. Hope next time a corrective experience
DeezNuts S.,"Irvine, CA",1,27,2,3.0,8/2/2015,One of the better Cheesecake Factory locations.  The food was good and somehow better prepared than most of the others I've been to.  Brunch is reasonably priced.  The service was good.  I saw the manager out on the floor; running things smoothly.  The staff overall was professional and polite.  A good experience; our party of 6 left happy.
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,799,7321,4.0,3/24/2012,"(Dined 3/18/12 SU): The name says it all, but it is so much more than that! I would start adding the word ""Burger"" to the name. A friend and I had a free Sunday after we cancelled a wine tasting event due to possible inclimate weather (this never materialized), so we had an open day of psuedo-spontaneity which took us from the Valley, to the Eastside, Mid-Wilshire, and ultimately to the Westside at The Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills. Neither of us have been to this location, and I was driven by the $25.00 gift card that needed to be used. Although my phone's GPS guided us here, we initially missed it because of a tall leafy tree covering up the store's neon sign out front. It was around 8pm when we finally walked in, and the place was packed...but not packed enough to seat us immediately. I can honestly say this was the first time I've never had to wait to be seated. Karma was on our side this even, and in fact, the entire day. At this point, we were both starving, so it took us some time to figure out what to eat because everything we saw around us and what we read on the menu was appealing to us. After getting glasses of water and at least decided on a blended mango margarita for me ($10.95), and a ""skinny-style"" red raspberry martini ($8.95) for my friend. I eventually decided on the Macaroni & Cheese Burger ($11.95) and substituted for sweet potato fries ($1.00 extra), and the Fish Tacos ($13.95) for my friend. To finish off the meal, we had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake ($7.95). While we carried on our insightful conversation and exhorted about our day's adventures, we enjoyed our drinks and the table bread and butter. I can't speak about her martini but I do love their margaritas, and this instance was no different. Our food soon came out and man did it smell amazing! Again, I can't speak about her fish tacos, but my glamburger was about to take over the world...like Kim Kardashian's ass! I literally had to size this bad boy up. Two encounters with humongous burgers in recent weeks, I don't think my heart can take it anymore! The best plan of action was to stack everything together and smash it all down, so at least it's manageable for me to wrap my pie-hole around it. I truly do love their assortment of glamburgers, and I've never tried this one before. No words can do justice how much I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of throwing a dollop of fried mac & cheese on top of my burger patty - ingenious! In order to have room for dessert, I had to have half of this and my always tasty sweet potato fries packed-up for a later meal. Now, I've had the Reese's cheesecake which happens to be one of my favorites, and my friend loves peanut butter, so we were both on a peanut butter high. We amazingly polished off the cheesecake, probably to our detriment.    One other thing (mentioned the waiting earlier) I've always had an issue with them was their service. This time, I couldn't praise the service more. Our attractive waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and accommodating. Our water glasses were always filled (very important to me), and she was able to include some marinara sauce on my burger (I guess it normally doesn't) as it does when you only order the mac & cheese. I should have asked for her number (I was with a more familial female friend so it would have been fine)!  Parking is everywhere, from the street, valet, and parking structures. We parked in the structure across the street with a flat $5.00 fee. Overall, I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants (I do list Elephant Bar, Outback Steakhouse, Claim Jumpers, and Red Robin as some of my favorite chains), but if I keep having experiences like this with the Cheesecake Factory, I might have to add them to the list. Maybe I just have to come to this location! Their cheesecakes are undeniable, and I now always go for their glamburgers. These two menu items for me have singled them out among the crowd. There is value based on the portion sizes and as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $54.00 before gift card and tip). The atmosphere is casual and family-oriented, but this particular location had the lighting set to more romantic mood, which is fine by me. Because of the dim lighting, I honestly don't know how the décor is. Where we sat (close to the front window), it did feel a bit tight, but we made the most of it. And they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!"
Patrik J.,"Sollentuna, Sweden",0,3,1,5.0,7/29/2014,"Fantastic food. The Herb Crusted Salomon i recommend if you are looking for fish or some fresh meal. For meat, the Hitachi Stake is very tasty! One of the best in La!"
Signature I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,3.0,7/27/2015,Love the cheesecake factory but sends like this location has gone down hill in service and food quality in general. The staff is not very knowledgeable and the managers are not too friendly. Wish they get their act together because this was our family's favorite place to go.
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,5.0,11/21/2014,It's no secret I love Cheesecake Factory. I have not had a meal here that I have not liked and I have high standards. The food quality is great tasty and large portions so you can share if needed. I got the Kale salad: this is my favorite salad without fail. I love it. I also had the Chipotle Pasta AMAZING. This is my favorite pasta. If you get a chance order the salad and the pasta you will not be disappointed
Susan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,27,38,4.0,8/21/2013,I absolutely love the avocado egg rolls!
Pez P.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,84,54,2.0,6/3/2015,I love Cheesecake Factory but this isn't a good location. The service is really bad. Out waiter was like asleep. He had no energy or enthusiasm. Food came out in a timely manner and tasted good. We also talked to the manager about a recently expired coupon and she was very very rude. I understand if you can't use the coupon but you can be nice about it.
Ken P.,"Twinsburg, OH",0,71,5,1.0,4/7/2015,"Have the day to kill. Was going to drive up from Santa Anna and get lunch in Beverly Hills. Saw Cheese Cake factory on yelp, but all the reviews on how dirty the place is. Wish the manager would correct-going to have to pass."
Joseph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,61,6,4.0,3/6/2015,Come here from time to time with my family. The service is always great and food comes out in a timely manner. My favorite dishes are chicken madeira and baja chicken tacos. They have so many choices and it's hard to go wrong with anything. The atmosphere is cool and it's hard for me to be disappointed when I come here. Only thing that bugs me is that I came on my birthday and their complimentary dessert was lame. A mini cheesecake would be cool!
Alice K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,,3.0,5/14/2015,I gotta say I'm disappointed with the quality of the food. It used to be better. The service is good but I could hardly understand what my waiter was saying.  Dear Cheesecake Factory if anyone in manage my reads these please do something about your floors. They are VERY slippery!! I've slipped and almost slipped many times. How your staff functions I have no idea
Gerald C.,"Oakland, CA",118,598,27,4.0,11/9/2014,"The menu is just too darn long. But we love the bread. My xbb's new favorite is the jambalaya, substituting rice for pasta. I enjoyed the sauteed shrimp with angel hair pasta. Our server was also very friendly, patiently helping us find the right dish."
Sara N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,116,57,3.0,1/31/2015,"The food is always great at the Cheesecake Factory but the service here can me mediocre, the wait time is extremely high and the servers take way too long to help you or even check up on you."
