Karen L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",312,677,87,4.0,6/20/2013,"I have eaten at this   Factory numerous times but this time there was no wait so that is a star right there. Service was wonderful and very attentive, so there is another one. For a chain, I have to say the Beverly Hills location did a great job! I had the BLT burger. Generous beef patty smothered in blue cheese and bacon, mayo, lettuce and tomatoes erred with crispy double fried fries was perfect and just the right amount. I left feeling very satisfied. My husband had the Alfredo pasta and chicken. The sauce was surprisingly light with a lemony tang. Bread is always good. A very nice inexpensive lunch...bang for your buck in BH."
Jackie T.,"New York, NY",70,155,556,4.0,1/18/2012,"I love this place for its happy hour prices (food), tasty menu choices, restaurant decor, and service.  I usually visit this Cheesecake Factory as a party for two and we share the following happy hour dishes: Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken or Beef Sliders, and Calamari.  We also share a slice of cheese cake. The slices are huge, so it's definitely fit for two people, especially after feasting on the happy hour menu.  Every time I visit, I like to try a cheese cake that I haven't tried before. My favorite so far is the Ultimate Red Velvet cheese cake. Our bill usually totals to about $30-35, which is quite a deal for Beverly Hills. Never did I think I would be able to eat in such an upscale area, and a nice restaurant for this cheap!  Its a great place for a fancy date-night, without going broke :) Great food, service, location and price. No complaints here!"
Deji S.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",5,19,5,1.0,3/25/2015,"The ambiance is nice and the location is pretty niche! I mean, it's Beverly. The one thing I didn't like about this location the service and awkward vibes. My experience was appealing and the waiter Andrew M was socially inept. I made a complaint about the service but even those hosting didn't seem to care because they didn't ask any details regarding who the waiter was or about our experience.  The waiter probably said a total of 10 or less words the entire time. It made my friend and I not want to order here. Even though I've had quite the cheesecake experience in the past. I know the the ceo and he will be hearing from me.  Just a tip for help."
Correy O.,"San Diego, CA",20,161,16,4.0,12/23/2013,"I came in with a major sweet tooth looking fo a gluten-free cheesecake. Surprise! They had something for me. They claimed that their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake was gluten-free.  I only ended up eating a few bites - it was very good, just a huge slice! - but all seems okay with my health. So I assume it's gluten free! :)"
Sarah R.,"San Diego, CA",21,6,3,1.0,6/29/2015,"Usually we come for all the Cheesecakes Factory restaurants and we are happy with our choice. Today we waited a long time at the line, the food was nice, but nothing more than that and the service was not good, the waiter was lethargic and unfriendly. Even the cup of tea was dirty. Hope that next time will be better."
J M H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,53,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Ok, the food is the same as any Cheesecake Factory.  No surprises.  Exactly the same. The management is terrible.  I say this because the wait staff are nice and seem to move fast, but the service is terrible so it must be the management that will not staff the place correctly.   I had not been there in ages, but went twice in one month. Both times we sat outside at the street side tables. We were seated by the host both times so they knew we were there.  First time was with my mother.  We waited about 20 minutes.  I took our order, went in and gave it to the host.  Voila, food!  Second time was last night with a friend.  We were seated outside.  Someone did come and take our drink order. Mine came, hers did not.  No one came to take food orders for a long time.  Finally I had to wave like crazy and got a waiter who got some woman who seemed to possibly be a manager.  I ordered a salad and a burger.  My friend ordered some chicken entree, no starter.  After a while her plate arrived, but no salad for me or burger.  She started on her food.  About 10 minutes later I had to flag down someone again and then suddenly the burger and salad arrived with another slightly different plate for my friend.  Different vegetable.  I then waited MINUTES for catsup or mustard. Minutes! And I had to ask several times.  MINUTES.  Then someone, manager type woman again, and a waiter came out and we thought she said she would take care of the bill.  THEN it turned out she only took off my burger, which is fine, I don't complain for freebies I complain because the experience was TERRIBLE.  Waiter apologized.  He was confused as well.   Really, management should have staff on the outdoor seating at all times.  Letting customers spend such an unpleasant and frustrating experience twice means it is Management fault not the servers.   Plenty of other places to eat on the same block.  Terrible. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the floors inside are weird, slope unexpectedly and tiled with slippery tile.  Carpet on stairs to the bathroom was really dirty.  Floors in the bathroom dipped and sloped.    All in all, go somewhere else.  Not worth the frustration for generic Cheesecake factory food."
Josh F.,"New York, NY",236,19,24,5.0,2/16/2015,"Great place for lunch. I sit at the bar cause it's quick and perfect place for lunch. Salad, pizza, orange chicken are my favs!"
Jennifer N.,"Long Beach, CA",444,1095,12255,3.0,1/12/2011,"For Cheesecake factory, it's sometimes a hit and miss, depending who's your chef and who serves you?  Surprisingly they don't do better to satisfy their customers because I was a mystery shopper for their corporate numerous of times. Corporate FREQUENTLY give out Mystery jobs out at all their locations.  When I go to Cheesecake Factory, I always ordered the Thai Pasta. And its always a hit and missed item depending on the chef!  I like it the way it's supposed to be. Noodles chewy not soggy and sauces stick on the noodles not runny that makes the tastes like watered down peanut butter soup. (sorry yes that's how it tastes like, if they don't cook it right.)  Unfortunately that day at this location, it was pretty soggy.. :-(  The waiter, Ashley asked if I wanted to change my entree... I agreed and decided to go with the Bistro shrimp pasta which was delicious!!  Our waiter was so polite and well mannered. Through our entire visit he was smiling, always checking with us if we were alright.... Until shift change! We were introduce by a waitress named Kelly. She was NOT polite. We asked her for an extra plate to share our cheesecake, she almost seemed she was rushed with anger to serve us. Almost throwing the plate on our table. Not a smile, never came to refill our drinks, and we had to searched all over for her to get a check and another minutes to get a to go box.  ** NOTE ABOUT TIPPING WHEN YOU are in A MIDDLE OF A SHIFT CHANGE****  As we left, we walked to the front of the counter, I politely asked if I can speak to the manager about seeing how do they split the tips in regarding shift changes. I had already left a 15% tip, just in case our first waiter was getting some of the tips. The manager confirmed to me that the tips went to the server that picks up the shift. .. FYI!  Wanted to take back every penny of my tip, but didn't! grrrrrr."
Daniel H.,"San Francisco, CA",87,300,205,3.0,8/1/2014,"This place has its ups and its downs, but is pretty much an all around average chain restaurant located in Beverly Hills. I've been coming to this location for many years because it has always been a consistent and pretty convenient place to come to grab a bite to eat. Sometimes you just feel like munching away on one of their many popular menu items.  The portions here are pretty big, and most of the time I have to take what I am eating to go with me. Most of what I've tried here is pretty good, but I have a few favorites that I always return to. I really like the salads that they have here, and the portions are generous...I think my favorite would be the BBQ chicken salad but take a look at some of the other creative salads that they have to offer. Pasta dishes are another favorite of mine, and I like the Chicken Bellagio, the Cajun Jambalaya, and the Garlic Noodles with chicken. You can start of a meal with one of their many appetizers too, and my favorite is the Tex Mex Egg rolls. Like I said, since the portions are big, I never really have room for dessert here. Overall, I have found their food to be pretty consistent, which is good for any chain restaurant. I think the one thing that is inconsistent here is the service. On some days everyone is excellent from the hostess that greats you in the front to the waiter that takes care of you throughout your meal. However, in some cases, they are kind of lacking in customer service and really need training to learn to be more consistent to their customers. On my latest visit here, my sister went to the hostess, but they didn't acknowledge her immediately because they were too involved with a personal conversation. When they seated us, our table was clearly missing a chair that we needed, and when I said something about this she had already run off, so I had to pull one for myself from another unoccupied table. Moments like this just take simple thought, and I'm surprised that something as easy as this went unacknowledged by the person who sat us at the table...totally unprofessional! The waiter that day was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive give that there were not too many other guests dining at that time. Other times, the waiter service has been excellent here though. I'll probably come back to this location again, but I really hope that the service improves and doesn't continue to decline over time. Compared to other restaurants in the area, they do remain more affordable in terms of their pricing. As a word of caution, they do get very busy around meal times, especially during the weekends. There is also not much waiting room to stand near the hostess desk so it can get pretty cramped with people and servers walking in and our of the main doorway...so just keep that in mind if you choose to dine here."
Beth B.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/5/2015,This place is the greatest place ever it's so cool they have good foodthey they have small toiletsI like their little toilets your floor is slipperythey have nice plates and food they have a good managerthey have nice people that work here they're so good
Adam D.,"Studio City, CA",144,16,3,2.0,2/28/2013,"This is the flagship Cheesecake Factory (first one) and they are alright enough.  Honestly, they are pretty meh. If you've eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, you know the drill. Same menu - trillion things on it. You have to decide what you are going to eat out of their phone book and then, once it is delivered, prepare to eat all 14000 calories. Their servings are enough for a small family, so prepare yourself. You will waddle out and try to remember why you went here again, since you've been through this and knew it was just masochistic to go back. Visit at your own risk.  One little note, every dish seems like the cook dropped about 12 cloves of garlic in. You will taste your meal the rest of the day.  Oh, and get ready for this: They have a 7 layer chocolate cake which -- NOT JOKING -- has about 3700 calories PER SLICE."
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,4.0,1/22/2011,"I've been to several Cheesecake factory locations throughout Los Angeles (Beverly Hills, Marina Del Rey, Encino, Pasadena) and even in D.C. a few years ago.  My favorite location is still the Beverly Hills location.  The service has always been excellent at Cheesecake factory, though the wait may be a little long if they're especially busy.   The food is great -- I always take a long time deciding what to order because there are so many choices!  My favorite food here is their pastas.  I really like their Cajun Jambalaya pasta and their Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes.  I'm generally a big fan of sundried tomatoes, and the ones at Cheesecake Factory do not disappoint.   I also really like their clam chowder soup. Oh, and they have a great selection of cheesecakes (obviously) but my favorite is the classic strawberry cheesecake. Note, however, that the portions are HUMONGOUS!  So be prepared to share or take half of your food home.  However, a word of caution to you health-conscious people: the food here is very high in calories.  A bowl of pasta here can run upwards of 2000 calories!  A piece of cheesecake could be 800 calories.  That is a lot... But everyone should splurge once in a while.   This is a great place to go to for family meals, dates, a dinner with friends, birthday dinners, or large banquet dinners. They're nice about accommodating large parties."
Monica R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/9/2015,"Nice customer service, good quality food but short staffed. Parking was an issue but other than that I had a good time enjoying food."
Sayed A.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/23/2015,All of the food was reheated .. Disgusting cold mashed potato. They crazy fast .. In and out in 20 minutes thats what the 2 stars are for but the food nit really
Laura Z.,"Arleta, CA",502,277,718,3.0,3/18/2013,So I was in the area and decided to bring my mom to lunch here.  She loved the chicken club sandwich and her fries.  I tried the Chicken Madeira. It was delicious. Cooked to perfection and worth all the calories.  The servings are so big that i only had room for half my plate. I took the rest home.  We also shared a dulce de leche cheesecake which was amazing.
Beverly K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,18,,5.0,12/17/2014,Always love this place... I highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms (hard to find on their menu) and stuffed avocado egg rolls. Have been going here since I was a child and just it always is quality food. I wish they would get a bigger space because its a little too crowded at times but thats because its great. ALSO they have calorie count on everything!!!!!!!!!!! love it! I know how much im eating! Last night had the fish and chips... didn't look at calorie count though and it was enough for 3-4 meals!
Margaret S.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,16,,5.0,4/11/2014,I really love cheese.cake specially the chocolate mousse !!!!!! It melt in you mouth it so good I a chocolate fan and this.desert make go there pretty often to buy one
Kimberly P.,"San Francisco, CA",121,282,119,4.0,6/18/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory!!! No matter what location I go to I am never disappointed!! (I hope I can always say that LOL) The lemon drop martini is ALWAYS on point, hands down!! My friend and I went in after 10pm and got some good seats at the bar. We just ordered appetizers since it was kind of late. We had the Buffalo Blasts (my mouth is watering as I type this) and the Crab dip I think. They both were delicious!!"
Lupe R.,"Long Beach, CA",229,11,1,2.0,9/2/2014,"I love going to CF, usually go once or twice a month. Was in the area and this was the coldest one and decided to try it out. The service was slow, and food was mediocre. I'd recommend going to the one at the Grove of you can, or by Disneyland. Wouldn't expect an exceptional meal here. Won't be coming back. Better CF are closer to my home."
Todd N.,"Boston, MA",0,18,,4.0,3/21/2014,"Pretty good food, usually packed...don't really expect to celebrities :) It's a Cheesecake Factory...usually always pretty good."
