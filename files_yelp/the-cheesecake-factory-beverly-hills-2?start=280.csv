Cydni S.,"Cypress, TX",31,10,27,1.0,7/30/2014,"Food was okay, but the service was very slow. Our waiter had too many tables and I didn't get the drinks I ordered until my food came, after calling her over to my table twice to remind her! The receptionists were very unfriendly and rude. I swear I saw a family of cockroaches under the table next to me.  Lesson learned..don't come to this Cheesecake Factory"
Mike C.,"West Hollywood, CA",49,555,106,2.0,8/8/2014,"The only benefit to this place is it has a big menu, so there's something for everyone. That being said everything on the menu is mediocre to terrible.  When you walk in it's a narrow walkway and you always bump into people. hard to get in and out. the floors are slippery, and the hostesses are rude. service is average to okay, they're just doing the bare minimum to meet their job description. they NEVER get the meat temperature right here. since when is medium rare always well done? for steaks and burgers. i always end up getting burnt crisps of meat here. disgusting.  everything tastes the same here, nothing will be horrible but nothing will be flavorful. crowd is incredibly touristy. I preferred the cheesecake factory in brentwood which actually gave a shit."
Bo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,177,250,4.0,2/14/2011,"Outstanding service - great food - alcohol served quickly and correctly. Ain't life grand. Seriously - Cheesecake Factory stocks are taking a beating in the market, but the Beverly Hills location can't be the problem, this location is exactly as good as one could ever hope a Cheesecake Factory would be. Quite honestly, its refreshing to be able to have lunch for two with multiple drinks in BH for less than $100 - We had the BBQ chicken salad - lunch size serving and the artichoke, simply delicious and for this place in the seriously healthy bracket, (don't' finish the onion rings if you want to pretend to be that healthy though - but they are soooo awesome) I will be back for sure.!"
Rose S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",3,16,2,3.0,3/29/2014,Terrible service and pathetic attitude of this jackass waiter made me put an effort to sign up on yelp and write a negative review.. So Ive been going to this place for years and never had a bad experience except last night when i was trying to explain how i want my shrimp done this stupid waiter gave me the worst attitude which made me almost leave. I even discussed the situation with manager but it seemed like she did not really care except she only asked if i wanted another waiter and off course i said yes. Anyways i had the worst worst experience ever and was extremely disappointed.
Jack R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,1,3.0,5/27/2015,"fine.  a little cramped and shotty service, but food is just as good as any other cheesecake factory"
Desiree H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,3.0,1/16/2016,"We are regulars at this place, but lately the waiters don't seem happy. This makes me not enjoy my meal. Not sure what's going on, but for a family type resturant it's making me not want to go there anymore."
David P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,5.0,12/18/2012,"Erasmo, the GM, at this branch is a true professional.  We had a terrible experience at the Beverly location with a junior Manager. named Reggie. Erasmo took it upon himself to turn the experience 360 and ensure we remained loyal customers. I'll definitely return to this location and would recommend Erasmo for any senior management position the food/services business.  Excellent business acumen and a truly long term business man."
Jessica C.,"Oceano, CA",0,3,10,4.0,1/5/2014,"On Thursday 1/2/2014 my family and I took a trip to LA area to re home one of our dogs. Normally we like to go to Beverly hills and eat some authentic Persian Food at Aram Restaurant just down the street from the cheesecake factory. On this day, we went to Beverly hills and after many years our famous Persian spot closed. Instead we decided to go the cheesecake factory.  First, we were on a one way street and we had to turn around. We decided to turn into a parking structure, but this car was backing out of the structure and almost hit us. We ended up just u turning it and going around the corner, were a cop turned on his lights behind us. We told him what happened and he ended up letting us go with out a ticket to ring in the new year.  Thank god for that! We parked and went to the restaurant. They were really busy, When I went up to the hostess, I thought she would say the wait would be at least 30 min. Luckly, we got sat right away. I orded the vegi burger with coleslaw. I have to say this was one of my faviorts. Of all the vegi burgers I have ate, I give this an A Plus. We also got the small plate lettuce wraps. They were good, but it was hard to roll them up in the romaine lettuce they give you. My kids got the kids burger sliders, and my husband ended up getting fish tacos. The fish tacos were plain, and the should have been served with some cabbage.  Our server was a very tall, I think he said he was 6 Ft 6. I was not ready to order because of the largeness of the menu. He came and checked back several times. When we were ready to order, I noticed he took our order with out writing it down, and then he went and took 3 more tables orders. When we got our food I ended up waiting for another 10 min for my vegi burger because he forgot to put it in. It was so good though, that I really did not care.  For dessert, we ended up getting two cheesecakes to go. Pinapple upside down cake cheesecake was really good!!! Then we got a raspberry cheesecake with a chocolate crust which I did not care for. 2 pieces of cheesecake cost me almost 17 dollars.  Above all the food was great and so was the atmosphere. My server was great two, he just needs to smile a little more, and when he goes to a new table, he needs to present himself by saying his name or letting me no what the specials are ext.. Other then that he did a great job, and I was impressed with his memory."
Mark D.,"Fullerton, CA",4,224,,2.0,10/20/2012,"Couldn't really decide whether to give two or three stars. Two and a half stars would probably be most accurate. Have eaten here many, many times in the past. The atmosphere is quite pleasant. It is, after all, Beverly Hills......I have tried numerous entrees from their menu over the years, and have mostly concluded that their food is just okay. Nothing to rave or to write home about. Today I ordered the teriyaki chicken. The food was delivered on a huge oversized plate. However, the amount of actual chicken given was probably in the range of only 4 - 6 oz. The food, itself, was served hot and was thoroughly delicious!...... My recommendation to others (who would consider ordering this) would be to allow yourself to indulge in a couple of extra slices of bread served before the meal. Otherwise, you may need a slice of cheesecake to finally get full..... As for their coffee, if you desire hair on the soles of your feet, by all means order a cup!!! Otherwise, AVOID!!! Their blend is extremely bitter and way, way too strong!! In closing, I am mostly not a fan of this restaurant. Truth be told, I would not come here on my own. However, this is my Aunt's favorite restaurant in the area. And, when I visit, I am along for the ride to keep her company......And since my uncle routinely picks up the tab, I go with the flow."
Tom M.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,17,1,2.0,10/19/2015,Bad experience here last night. Came in late. Sat at table for 15 mins no one came over. Finally had to ask for a server. Server was odd. Not sure if rude or pissed off about something unrelated. Food bad. Salad drenched with dressing. Tuna tartare had a minuscule amount of tuna and a big chunk of avocado. Floors so greasy throughout the entire place I had to walk carefully in dress shoes so as not to slip. I'm a big fan of CF but won't go to this one again.
Justin L.,"West Hollywood, CA",16,7,,5.0,1/22/2015,"Although parking space is hard to come by at times the dining experience was superb.The service was very good and the food was delicious but the dessert was the star of the meal.Well,what can i say,the cheese cake factory is the place to be."
Seti D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",80,40,1,1.0,4/19/2015,This review is for a waiter named Joan. She brought me food and it didn't taste good. She mistakenly charged me for a drink. She didn't have a good attitude which i wanted to tell her but my friend told me to let it go.
Karen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,124,34,2.0,4/20/2014,Good selection but quality and service has decreased over time. My orders come late and too many times we get the wrong thing. I only go there because it is convenient and the bread is good. CPK is much better if you ask me.
Jimmy L.,"Monterey Park, CA",63,4,,1.0,2/13/2014,"This review will mainly be about the service, particularly the bartender. We wanted to stop by for a quick bite before heading back home. Four of us went in during happy hour and had to sit at the bar since there were no tables available. The bartender sets up the place settings for the four of us and asks us what we wanted to drink. I said 4 waters and he confirms the order with the nastiest attitude. Next up we order a couple of apps to share between the us and with the same attitude, turns around and mumbles under his breathe ""only two things."" Not exactly sure why he was being a dick, maybe he was under the impression that each of us were required to order a drink or dish.  5 stars for the food but the bartender gets the 1 star."
Kian A.,"Encino, CA",87,19,1,3.0,2/1/2013,"I love eating at the most Cheesecake Factory's, but not this one. Went here on a Sunday after an awesome orchestral performance at Royce. Salad was incredible (Caesar salad with blue cheese dressing), bread always great, although it took a while before that came and I had to ask for it. Ordered a $27 ribeye which should be decent-right? Well, it was not and the waitress could give a crap. She started out with that ""I'm in a hurry, so quickly give me your order"" which I can't stand!  So overall...eh If you want the Factory experience, go to another one-like Sherman Oaks or Redondo."
Joni R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/26/2015,This is our second time in a row we had a crappy experience here where our food took way too long and and came out cold.  Lots of apologies but just excuses. And our server did a disappearing act to boot.  Horrible.  Never coming back.
Kristian H.,"Melbourne, Australia",20,52,8,5.0,6/8/2012,"The menu is huge and varied, but the only reason I was there was to try the cheesecake. An old American friend told me how,  once you've been to the Cheesecake Factory, everyone else's cheesecake just doesn't cut the...cheesecake, anymore. Needless to say, he was correct.  It was magnificent. Service was great too - friendly and sincere.  NOT a restaurant for every day eating, mind you - the food is a touch too rich, and the portions a bit too large.  This is a restaurant for a special occasion. We tried the peanut butter cheesecake, and highly recommend it.  A taste sensation!  This was a great way to finish off being touristy around Rodeo Drive."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,5.0,3/31/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Beverly Hills.  The staff are professional and friendly.  The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory.  From the drinks to the meals to the deserts, they are all excellent! It's a great place for dates and families.  You can eat here then go to window shop at the high end boutiques. Highly recommend it!"
Cyndi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",742,363,318,4.0,12/6/2012,"Always good food!  It doesn't matter what location, the food is always consistent.  I always order a lunch portion because they give you SO MUCH FOOD!  The Raspberry White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake ROCKS!  They also have a decent wine list!"
Farnaz S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",182,57,18,5.0,6/22/2014,I would probably give this place 3 stars because the food was ok and place was too tight but the waitress won the stars. She was very attentive. She listened and acted on details we asked for.
