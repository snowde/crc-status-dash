Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,5.0,7/26/2012,"Even though I now have a Cheesecake Factory down the street from me, a decade ago they weren't yet in my state and I had my first CF experience at the Beverly Hills location....it was amazing. Great outdoor seating, extensive menu, great service, and very good food - with huge servings and lots of leftovers. The menu literally has something for EVERYONE, the cheesecake is to die for, and you simply cannot go wrong here. Not to mention this location.....it just doesn't get any better."
Rekha V.,"El Segundo, CA",82,34,1,1.0,2/7/2013,"I had a gift card from Christmas so one night when we were in the neighborhood we decided to use it..   We were greeted and seated promptly.  It was too bad that the table that they decided to seat us at was half taken by the guests at the table next to us...  The hostess didn't even acknowledge that a woman in the next table was sitting into our section of the booth with all of her diaper bags and shopping bags...  So, then we just told her we would sit at the bar. We went to the bar and ordered our drinks.  I had just moved to L.A. so I had my cancelled TX licence WITH my CA temporary license and the bartender refused to serve me...  Homeboy didn't even offer to speak to a manager about the issue, said my ID was invalid....  Funny, because I am a commercial driver and can drive vehicles carrying up to 50 passengers and that is what is says on the temp license I got from the CA DMV... We left and may sell the giftcard online...  It was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen..."
Don T.,"Glendora, CA",77,620,340,3.0,3/8/2014,"My wife and I drove into the city to have dinner with our daughter, so we chose The Cheesecake Factory.  We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived as it was a short 15 minute wait on a Friday night.  This is one of the original locations and is much smaller than other CFs, but it was full tonight and the service was fast and friendly for my pricey very average burger.  At least visiting our daughter was extra special."
Paul S.,"Long Beach, CA",28,606,20,4.0,6/23/2012,"I don't care which Cheesecake Factory you go to, it's always the same thing; tons of food.  We had a post graduation party here.  As we began the night, we inquired from the waitress as to the calorie count on the items.  They ranged from 1000 to 1700 calories.  She then explained that there is a method to the Cheesecake Factory madness.  Supposedly, they do not advertise.  Rather, their signature doggie bags are their advertisement. The message to consumers... you're going to get more food than you can devour in one sitting.  In fact, most items are meant so that you will have two (let me repeat 2) servings.  With that in mind, you should always share at Cheesecake Factory (unless of course you want to eat a second helping of what you ordered later in the day). On another note, Cheesecake Factory has a lite menu.  Everything on it is under 500 calories. That sounds grand for the person that wants to actually eat and finish a meal here.  With a big party, I only ordered a 400 calorie Greek Salad (quite nice and rather small) only to partake of the meals of everyone else that ordered a regular meal (serving for 2).  Long story short, Cheesecake Factory is one of the better restaurants to have a family style meal.  With 4 or more people, just order half the number of meals (plus one if you're really hungry) and share.  That's the true value of the Cheesecake Factory.  And I'm a fan of that... sharing is caring!!"
Connie H.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",15,2,,1.0,2/14/2015,"This restaurant has serious racial discrimination. All the Asian should boycott it.This is the worst experience I've had since I've been to USA. When we were ready to order and ask the waiters to come over my table, all the waiter just kept us waiting for more than 20 mins. Even the people who came after us already got their meal, they still asked us to wait. When we were ordering, the waiter displayed a awful attitude, without any greeting and smile. During the ordering process,  he only said only a word ""ok"" in the end, like we shouldn't have bothered him. what's more, when the waiter sent our meal, also didn't say anything or tell us which dish it is. We ordered main course and some cheese cakes as the after-meal desserts, but he sent the cheese cake first instead. isn't it a common sense to send the dessert later?? By the way, we are the only table which can't get napkins. we asked for some napkins many time, but they never gave us, like we should have begged for them as Patsey begged for a soap."
Craig R.,"San Diego, CA",1854,650,141,3.0,10/11/2011,"Yes, yes, yes, it's a chain restaurant - but a solid chain and there's just so much to choose from!  Our friendly waiter started us off with bread.  I love their bread!  I seem to always get myself so full but bread is my best friend. My daughter decided to go with the chicken pasta.  As usual this was quite a generous portion.  The chicken had a nice crunchy skin.  It was a very filling meal. I decided to get the Clubhouse Sandwich.  Each piece was stuffed with turkey, tomato, lettuce and bacon.  The bread was nicely toasted.  Although the turkey was a bit dry, it was still tasty.  Generous amount of fries but they were generic. For dessert, my daughter chose the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Very tasty!  It was not dense nor too rich.  The cheesecake flavor did not overpower the rest of the cake.  We thoroughly enjoyed the cake. This is my favorite low-key Cheesecake Factory. For a more festive atmosphere I prefer The Grove or Redondo Beach locations."
Brian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,1,,5.0,12/31/2012,"New Years Eve is not an easy night to find a table, which makes it a very difficult birthday to celebrate. My family and I were ever so lucky to find parking immediately and were even seated immediately. For a party of 5 on New Years Eve, that's a true blessing. Addie Estrella was able to find us a large enough  table for 5 in no less than 2 minutes. Addie went above and beyond to make my birthday/ New Years dinner an seamless and hassle-free experience Great Service"
Sea B.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,57,4,3.0,3/30/2013,"It looked extremely good on the menu and the plates but none of us thought it was spectacular. We had the lunch offer and it was a lot of food and not over-priced. We had one chicken salad, one taco plate, one pasta da vinci and one shrimp pasta. All ok but not overly excited. We got full. A lot to choose from, good service and nice interior. A lot of people so we had to wait 10 min for a table. 30 min if we wanted to sit outside. A popular place. The desserts and cakes looked great but we didn't try them. I'll go there again if I don't find anything else."
Kimberley C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",263,424,27,2.0,6/8/2012,"Never, ever would I choose a restaurant like this. HUGE, overflowing portions of food.  Contributing to the obesity problem we have in america. Middle class eats. Do I need to say anything more?"
Albert G.,"Glendale, CA",3,125,603,4.0,5/18/2014,"Went here for a late lunch today and got a table for four with almost no wait.   Service was great and food good was good as usual.  Ordered from the lunch special menu and was impressed with the value.  Had a Reene's special which comes with sandwich, soup and salad all for $12 bucks!!   If you want something even more robust go for crusted chicken Romano."
William T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/29/2015,"Alli is simply the best. Her professionalism in he orderly, efficient way she manages the restaurant, her wonderfully welcoming way about herself, and fantastic smile are what make this Cheesecake Factory the premier one of them all."
Anaher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,148,,3.0,5/24/2014,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory! We had a great waiter, honest, polite, and caring! I wish I knew his name so I could put it here.When we came in there were two people about to literally get it on, and that made me a bit uncomfortable seeing as people come to restaurants to eat and chat maybe hand holding and slight kiss here and there but not ready to go at it. That was some of the atmosphere.  In any case I ordered the steak medallion. The only downfall was I ordered medium well and I felt like my steak was a little too rare.., the other was my food was not hot, it was even a little cold. Hope this location steps it up in terms of food quality because they have great service otherwise."
Gina W.,"Richmond, VA",155,237,131,4.0,5/27/2010,I came here with my Dad for an early dinner. Thankfully it was easy to find parking in the structure across the street and you can't beat the free 2 hour parking.  Since we got here early there was no wait. My dad got the salmon pasta. He said it was OK. The mango iced smoothie he enjoyed thoroughly. Plus I enjoyed a sip or two of it as well.  I first ordered the bang bang chicken. However when it came out I could smell the cream. Due to my milk allergy they replaced my meal with the cashew chicken. The cashew chicken was salty but I believe it was because they did not factor in a substitute fort he cream that normally comes in the dish. Plus I don't think I can get used to breaded cashew chicken.  Docked one star for that. However our service was on point and the waiter went out of his way to make sure we were accommodated. Well done to the wait staff at Cheesecake Factory.
Jason P.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,34,2,1.0,9/18/2014,I went there with a large group of friends and the service was almost nonexistent. They would rarely come and check in on our table and when we asked for more bread for they table they would scoff. I hope this was just a bad night to go or something because I really love their food.
Patrick M.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",3,2,,2.0,6/26/2014,"The meal would have been awesome if the service was good this time around, had lunch outside today... Our server never came to check on us, we needed items, but couldn't get her attention to save our lives. I had to walk inside to ask for a check. This employee has been working there for some years, but I've always seen her BEHIND the counter. And we weren't the only table to feel this way..."
Linda L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/27/2015,Service was good... No waiting... Food was ok... The only thing I don't care about this place is glasses and utensils aren't clean... Everything is greasy... Hope they come up with cleaner environment.
James A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/26/2015,Ordered my food for pickup and was told it would be ready in 20 min. I should up 5 min early and my food was ready to go. I forgot my order didn't automatically didn't come with fries but William got me an order immediately. It's nice to get great customer service!
Liz C.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,173,52,4.0,1/16/2012,"I have a love-hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory... I love, love, love to indulge on tasty pastas, burgers, sandwiches, and salads here. I really love that they have huge portions so that I can save half my meal for another meal later. I also truly love their extensive menu (although I think a few items need the boot) that is updated with new items to try quite often. I hate that I cannot resist from stuffing myself with their warm bread and more of my dinner-size pasta and steaks -- after I'm already feeling somewhat full from the bread. I also hate that I want to try every new item they bring to the menu because the descriptions and ingredients seem so delectable! It really doesn't help that most of their foods are quite heavy and portions are incredible. Needless to say, I'm stuck in the middle. But, I always leave with a happy stomach and leftovers for later, so 4 stars!"
Elizabeth P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",9,9,,1.0,4/27/2015,"ATTENTION POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS: ROACH ALERT!!! Oh Cheesecake Factory how you disappoint me..What a considerably shocking development out of the Beverly Hills location. Wait time was short. We ordered a drink from the bar each. Mine was quite ""light"" on the alcohol, maybe that's what I get for ordering a mixed drink (mojito)..We Ordered the avacado egg rolls, very pleased. My friend got a chicken quesadilla (will elaborate on that fine dish later), my husband got the four cheese pasta with chicken, and I ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. My wraps were good, generous portion. Hubby's pasta was VERY SALTY. And my friend's quesadilla was initially good till she called me about getting FOOD POISONING. Check came, bus boy offered to box up my food. That's when my friend noticed coming out of the shadows... A ROACH scattering across the mirror behind us. My husband flagged down the busboy, who immediately sprung into action and leaped and crushed the bug with a cloth napkin. Props to him for his quick and courageous actions! The manager came over and apologized. He had explained how they had just come to spray... GROSS haha sounds like an ongoing problem. Comped our meal and took our address maybe to send us something? Who knows. Still haven't received anything. Anyways you have been warned.."
Mark R.,"Lewisville, TX",337,14,9,5.0,6/29/2014,"Here on vacation we decided to stop in for lunch. We were seated immediately and the service was awesome, the food came out fast, drinks were never empty. Though we only ordered two entrees, the young lady who helped us earned a $20 tip."
