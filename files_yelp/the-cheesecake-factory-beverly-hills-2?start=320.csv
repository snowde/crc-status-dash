Virginia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,41,65,4.0,4/23/2012,"Great place for casual lunch or dinner, perfect for family gathering, kid friendly restaurant; they have a huge menu with diversified food: pasta, salads, appetizers, soups, mexican food, chinese food, chicken, steaks.  Everything I tried was pretty good; reasonable prices and professional and friendly staff."
Robert W.,"Chicago, IL",2,399,,5.0,6/27/2013,"Yes it is a chain restaurant. People know that. It's also not a good reason to give this place a lower score. The food is undeniably amazing with almost unbelievable variety. They have this down to a science which is why even in Beverly Hills, this place has a wait on a Tuesday night. Don't over think it. It may not be the most unique or interesting place to eat or impress your hipster friends, but it is delicious. People who give it below 4 stars are name snobs or had an erratic bad experience."
Lauren R.,"Belmont, CA",51,209,1,4.0,1/17/2012,"Who isn't a fan of Cheesecake Factory?  Even though chains can be less than exciting, they can be just what you need when you're away from home (like it was for me during this visit).   The service was prompt and the location is convenient if you're doing some retail therapy in Beverly Hills.   If you get a table outside or by the window you may catch a celeb or two.  That's probably one thing that this location can offer you that others cannot."
Nette T.,"San Francisco, CA",338,648,264,2.0,1/31/2009,"Went here with a friend for lunch after some retail therapy. She's not much of a foodie and suggested Cheesecake Factory.  Well, her shoes were killing her and it was the closest restaurant we could find! Cheesecake Factory is pretty much as I remembered (in places like SF and Palo Alto) - huge portions, friendly staff and of course gigantic slices of cheesecake.  I ordered a salad and we shared a slice of cheesecake. Nothing stood out in terms of the food but the service was efficient. I thought the restaurant had a convoluted layout. I went to the restroom and was suprised how far it was....you have to pass by the kitchen where servers were picking up orders and go up the stairs to the restroom. I had to be careful not to slip and fall because the floor was slick with grease from the kitchen. (!!!) Next time I go shopping with my friend I'm going to bring band-aids so she can hobble to a different restaurant!"
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,274,,4.0,3/25/2014,"I am a fan. The breakfasts are good. Order any omelet with a huge side of potatoes and it comes with bread and toast, which is more than enough. The dinner portions are huge, the menu has a lot of items to choose from, and it is fresh. I always have good service. The cheesecake I take for carryout must have been $8-9 for one tiny slice, might as well just spend the extra $40-50 and get an entire cheesecake, but I guess that is expected. Would recommend!"
Umarin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,31,27,3.0,3/5/2012,"Parking after 6pm is flat rate for $5 at the public parking. Normally it's 2 hours free. This place is way too loud. I cannot even hear what is the person across the table said. Don't have long queue, but the waiter always busy and cannot come to take care when you need something. And the walkway between tables are so narrow that you can hit your butts on someone's face. :)"
Maysah F.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,140,14,1.0,8/4/2013,"Came here to buy a whole cheesecake and the valet rudely told me to move my car or park in valet and pay 7 dollars. I don't want to do that because I know I'm only picking up and don't want to wait for him to get my car from a distant lot where they park all their valet vehicles. I wasn't parked in his ""valet spot,"" I was parking at a meter. Later I parked about a block away which was so inconvenient and came back walking and BOTH my spot and the valet spot were EMPTY. Is he kidding me? What disgusting service I will never come here again"
Bao T.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,9,5,3.0,3/11/2014,"This is a review for a Sunday night.  We got free parking on Santa Monica and Beverly Dr. It was free after 6pm. Yay! We walked to the restaurant. Even though there didn't seem to be that many people we waited for 25 minutes. Hmm not very efficient staff I'm assuming. There were obviously empty tables. I loveeeeee their honey dark bread and usually would eat two or three baskets before the actual meal arrives but I wasn't feeling up to it that night.  We ordered the following  -Fried calamari (3.5/5), I gotta ask for extra lemon wedges.  -I had the luau salad (3.5/5). I usually either get this salad or the chipotle pasta and both are yummy but tonight it wasn't as good for some reason. They overdid with the oil.  -my friend had a shrimp scampi, he said it was decent. Nothing special he said. (3/5) -for desert, I had the tiramisu (4.5/5) yummer!!!!! -my friend had the sundae with vanilla ice cream and extra fudge. He said it was epic so I am assuming its a 5/5 The service was slow even though it was not crowded at all. (3/5) The food was decent. I have to say The Cheesecake Factory is consistent with its food, huge portion but as any chain restaurant there is nothing exceptionally delicious here. (4/5). The honey dark bread especially when served hot is sooo good.  I prefer the Marina Del Rey and the Grove location over this one. There used to be on near my place in Brentwood but they closed it down.  Overall experience is a 3.5/5."
Sean B.,"Irvine, CA",7,114,2,3.0,7/13/2013,"Familiar food which was okay predictable, But service? What's with the chip on the shoulder  servers in LA, do they think it's below them to serve? are they all striving actors, lawyers, doctors who resent the customer and having to serve them while they are waiting to achieve their career goals?"
Md M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,11,,4.0,5/17/2014,"Good menu,  good food, good service.  If you don't know where to go,  this is a good choice as a fail safe plan."
Juan David D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,9,,4.0,5/15/2014,This is really a good place to take guests and to treat them to a first class meal at a reasonable price in the heart of Beverly Hills.  The hosts there already know which booth I always get when I go there. And the service is excellent. Don't forget to get cheesecake after your meal. The best!
Alex S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",608,147,4,3.0,2/2/2012,"This place is a staple in BH...or any city USA.   The service is great, it may take a while to get a table but once seated you will enjoy your time. The portions are HUGE...a little to big as I never seem to save room for the cheesecake. Some of their gre"
Izzy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,33,4,4.0,9/25/2011,"Well, on the one downside there are tons of calories in pretty much every entree and, of course, dessert.  However, they just added a light menu, which is awesome.  Great food and low on the calories. If you really don't care about calories, this place is great!  Very tasty food.  I have yet to order something I don't like.  They truly deserve to be called the 'Cheesecake Factory' because they do an excellent job with all of the cheesecakes.   In terms of customer service, the two times we have been at this location have been very inviting and have caused us to want to visit often.  Our first time we were served by Ari who was amazing!  Our second time we were served by Josh who did a fantastic job.  Overall, this is an excellent place to have a great meal in a good atmosphere with friendly service.  Then, afterward, you can hit the gym.  :)"
Vladimir E.,"Tarzana, CA",84,61,21,5.0,11/19/2013,"For over 20 years i have been working in Beverly Hills, and this location ia very near and dear ro my heart... People love the cheesecakes here but some have mixes feelings about the food.. But i believe that it is al about what you order and HOW you order it. If you so not butcher the menu items too much they would be very much ok with adjusting an item or two to your liking. I personally would highly reccomend their Chipotle Pasta... Just the right blend of spices, chicken, peas, and a dash of crispy tortilla strips. Their blackened chicken sandwitch is fantastic... And if you would like to customize somethig, go for a lunch portion quesadilla and add blackened chicken, mushrooms and bacon... It comes with avocado, sour cream and salsa.... A pretty epic creation!"
Arthur F.,"Paris, France",3,235,,1.0,12/27/2012,"As a result of my YELP complaint I received an e-mail to call the manager of the Beverly Hills location. He, Erasmo was totally worthless. Did not know I had complained on YELP. Kept saying silly things like we want our clients to be happy. Talked about the temperature of the meat, told me the meat had eggs in it, etc. etc. etc.. Told me they follow through to improve an d lots of other pure BS. This place has no idea what service or truth means."
Walt N.,"Roseville, CA",26,231,143,4.0,8/7/2011,"I believe this is the original location that started the Cheesecake Factory chain of restaurants. I know I have been coming to this location for nearly 30 years, so if not the first, it's close. A smaller, more intimate setting than the newer CF's, with sidewalk seating on Beverly Drive.  My favorite dishes have always been the Chicken Marsala and Chicken Madeira. The extensive, multi-page menu has something for everyone. A few years ago the menu started to include a few healthy but tasty options and that trend continues. The desserts are unbelievably good. Obviously, cheesecake is the star of the show and the variety available is unbelievable. CF uses natural ingredients as much as possible. My last cheesecake was pumpkin and it tasted better than the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. There is probably ten different chocolate cheesecakes to choose from, too. The bakery can't be beat. If you are into a huge dish of quality comfort food or a smaller plate of healthy options, it's available here. Prices are reasonable for the quality delivered.  Street parking on Beverly, being in the center of the Beverly Hills - Rodeo Drive tourist area is tough at best. Nearby is a multilevel city parking structure that is free and convenient.  I have had to wait at times, usually not more than 15 minutes, and while once several years ago my name somehow fell off the reservation list, the service has always been great and the servers proficient and polite.  If you want to sample a Cheesecake Factory on a grand scale, huge in comparison to the Beverly Hills location, travel a few miles south to Redondo Beach and have dinner overlooking the harbor in one of the best locations that CF offers. Same menu, same prices."
Jordan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,72,,1.0,7/21/2011,"I'm writing this review as someone who really enjoys The Cheesecake Factory in general. I've eaten at The Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine and Brea locations countless times and have always enjoyed the experience. Having only gotten takeout from the Beverly Dr. location, I decided to go in today for lunch and could not have had a worse time. We were quickly seated at a two-top in the dining room near the kitchen. For the next 20 minutes, I sat with my girlfriend waiting to be greeted, waiting for water, waiting for that delicious bread, waiting for anything really! Having my order ready prior to arriving, I sat with menus in hand, turned towards the kitchen waiting to make eye contact with anyone wanting to actually work. After 20 minutes I left and took my business to Il Fornaio (delicious and comparable in price). I don't think I'll be rushing to eat at The Cheesecake Factory anytime soon..."
A J.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",10,56,39,5.0,10/4/2013,Lovely staff.  Friendly front desk girl.  Easy going bartender.  And great friendly service from Jason R. Pumpkin cheesecake is a must this time of year.
Steve V.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,35,17,5.0,10/20/2012,"Least impressive location, in terms of its decor and lack of parking, but most impressive in terms of the public, staff, and serenity (noise level). 2 of their waiters, Andrew and James Brown (Yes, that's really his name!) are both 6 stars out of 5, if that was possible."
Linda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",234,43,6,3.0,2/22/2011,"Let's see.. Being the fact that this Cheesecake Factory is located in Beverly Hills, you would think the service and quality overall would be better. WRONG!  I went there one evening with my 4 year old daughter on a rainy day. Got there and they told me that it was going to be a 30 minute wait.. Since I didn't want to wait, I chose the outdoor heated patio seating. That was clearly a mistake, had to wait 10 minutes to get the menu and another 10 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes to get our bread. Let me add that my daughter and I just got done shopping so we  were starving. Long story short...  I ordered a cream of chicken soup for myself and a grilled cheese for my daughter. We were both excited to eat until the food came out tasting like it's been out for awhile. Both dishes were cold, which was such a disappointment especially since like I metioned earlier... A. It was a RAINY DAY  and B. We were STRAVING! What made up for it was the red velvet cheesecake I ordered after our not so satisfying meal. I adored every bite of it! :]"
