Nathan A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/13/2014,"Pasta Da Vinci=To die for. Everything is perfect, including the service and good, and my favorite part was the food. The desserts, what they're famous for were amazing. Now l know why they're famous for their desserts."
Min S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/22/2015,"After another disaster at this cheesecake factory, we will never go to another cheesecake factory again.  It didn't appear much of the seafood was very fresh! 1.  Fried calamari appetizer was mushy.  2.  So was the Fish w/ fish & chips.   3. Also, the Herb-crusted Filet of Salmon was obviously NOT FRESH.  The 6'6"" waiter was terrific and so were the help, but the food was very subpar for such a restaurant! To top it off, the Valet parking was a big problem.  We paid $7.00 to the person at the front and then he took off and when our car arrived, the I gave the person who retrieved our car a $1.00 tip.  He quickly came back and said that I did NOT pay the $7.00 and accused me of lying and asked another person if we paid the $7.00 and the ""new"" person at the counter said that we didn't!  The said that we didn't pay and when I protested that I did and that the person to whom we gave the $7.00 had gone to park a car, he then tried calling that person with his cell phone. We were delayed from leaving the restaurant for over 15 minutes, until the guy came back.  We realize that the Valet parking is not directly connected with the restaurant, but it added to our distaste of this particular Cheesecake Factory and we would never go back there again and we will definitely tell all our friends to not go to a Cheesecake Factory since the food is now very subpar and the food that they prepare is very old and not FRESH! We eat out a lot and we used to frequent Cheesecake Factories which we felt had outstanding food, but the last two times we went to the Cheescake Factory (one was at  the Sherman Oaks Galleria), we were extremely disappointed.  At the S.O. Galleria, we waited a long time after ordering out food and when it finally came it wasn't cold and the pasta was NOT COOKED (still hard and when we called the manager, he sent the pasta dishes back and it took them over a half hour to bring back the ""cooked"" pasta dishes and it was very cold (obviously sitting on the counter for a long time after the cook finished it)l  The portions on ALL OF THE DISHES were appallingly small.  We don't know whether this was a new cook or not, but whoever prepared our food was obviously did not belong with the Cheesecake Factoryl After our last two experiences, we can understand closing down Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  We used to go to the one in Woodland Hills (on  Canoga Ave.) and on this particular night, we tried finding the C.F. at 121 LaCienaga in all the traffic around the Beverly Center.  It took us over 1 1/2 hours trying to find this particular CF, & had to call someone to find out the closest CF to the one that WAS at the Beverly Ctr. which was the one on Beverly Dr., BH.  When we asked the waiter in the BH restaurant, he didn't know of any CF on LaCienaga. Why does Cheesecake  still act like they have all of these restaurants when they have CLOSED??!!  Especially, on Friday evenings, this is a BIG PHONEY DEAL!!!"
George H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",14,38,,4.0,6/18/2014,"Been going here for years and years. Everything I've gotten has been great, especially the avocado egg rolls. The problem is that the food is so great and portions are so big that I never have room for dessert and I absolutely love the cheesecake here."
S. F.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",7,29,3,4.0,8/5/2013,"The service is great, people are friendly, the food is yummy and affordable. If you want a spot close to shopping on Rodeo but without the rodeo price tag this is the spot. It has been pretty packed each time I went to this location which is always a good sign if you ask me."
Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1013,373,297,5.0,6/1/2010,"How can you possibly be upset at a place with such a wonderful cobb salad and chicken quesidilla?  Exactly, you can't :) I love their portions, although this place is ridiculously chock full of calories lol. If you're in Beverly Hills it's a great place to eat and then go shopping.  Nice little date spot too :) *As a side note, this is one of the only chain restaurants that float pretty  consistently in my book around the 4 to 5 star level.  I also highly recommend the one in Sherman Oaks on Ventura and Sepulveda :) 5/5 stars"
Andy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,70,33,3.0,7/19/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, especially the White chocolate Raspberry truffle cheesecake!!! They also have a great variety of foods to choose from. Sorry i had to get that out.  Having said that, the main draw of the Beverly hills location is sitting outside in the sidewalk patio and people watching and being watched. The layout is cramped inside and there is always a wait (all locations) but here there is no room to wait in. The wife and i had picked a location in the middle to meet for lunch so after waiting 30 min we were seated even though i had called ahead and put our name on the list. I had the Shrimp Po'boy sandwich, the kids had mac n cheese, chicken fingers and pizza, the wife had the salmon. The food was good and came out fairly quickly. But alas because it took so long i couldn't get my desert ;-("
Thomas G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/5/2015,This location has much easier access than the Grove location.  The two beautiful hostesses and the seating staff were prompt and courteous despite a bustling weekend wait.  The Chicken Bellagio was amazing!
Vette H.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,83,67,3.0,4/7/2013,Yummy so Far...The Service Was Great And The Food Well Cooked.
Myke E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/14/2011,"If you could live off of the cheesecake the world would be a better place.  I like every type I try, but red velvet is elite.  but of  the food items I usually choose between the buffalo chicken sandwich and the southwestern bbq ranch salad (its comes with corn, onion straws, tomoato, avacodo, chicken, beans...etc)   Obviously portions are my favorite part.....you get to chow down here. It's how it should be."
Dave I.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,16,2,4.0,4/26/2013,Great Happy Hour specials. Didn't realize how big the portions were going to be so I ordered nachos and the chicken sliders thinking they would be served on small plates. All I gotta say is SHARING IS CARING! Bring someone for sure.
Jasmine R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",18,53,42,2.0,3/9/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory ! Wherever I go, i have to to go cheesecake. But this one, I was very disappointed. I got calamari and asked for them to be extra crispy, he brought barely even fried. My dad got the crispy chicken costeleta. Instead of it being zesty, (since it's a lemon sauce) it was very bland and honestly didn't even have a taste. & it wasn't even crispy ! It was as if it was microwaved. Disgusting. & my Alfredo was okay. I asked for him to go easy on the salt,and it came saltier than ever. Whatever I asked for I got the exact opposite. Would not be coming back again."
Grace C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,68,2,1.0,2/14/2011,Don't eat here.  I witnessed the bus boy letting a homeless guy (very dirty and smelly) drink an empty wine glass outside. I don't care if you clean all those glasses - I was disgusted.
Bahvee V.,"El Cerrito, CA",441,306,255,5.0,1/13/2011,"We have a CF in San Francisco and although a buddy of waits there, I have NEVER been!  I have in fact tried their fabulous red velvet and carrot cupcakes at a wedding. However, I had never eaten there. While I was in Beverly Hills, I did get a chance to eat here and all I can say is WOW!  We had a group of over 25 and I was shocked at how fast the food was served. I had the Jambalaya Shrimp Pasta dinner and an iced tea, I had plenty for next day leftovers and YUM YUM YUM!  The staff was well informed of their over 250 items on the menu, and they were prompt, courteous and well deserving of a PHAT tip! Another plus is that they allowed us to put all of our meals separately on cards from ONE bill, something that is totally OUT of the question in San Francisco! When in Beverly Hills, and before dashing off to Rodeo Drive, just two blocks away, do like we did, have a meal here and enjoy some quality time with your friends and/or loved ones.  I will come back here again no problem!"
Laila H.,"Sun Valley, CA",4,22,66,1.0,5/25/2011,The worst waiter ever the service was so bad that I wont recommend that place to anyone Though the  strawberry cheese cake is a yum delicious
Jason Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,213,8,4.0,11/13/2010,"Although Cheesecake Factory isn't the cheapest place to eat, they still have lunch specials that are slightly cheaper, and their portions are larger than most places, so you can almost always have leftovers.  They have a pretty diverse food and drink menu, and most of it is good.  This particular location was a little smaller than most other ones, but that's because of its location.  Service was good and parking is free. Try their thai lettuce wraps."
Oren G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",8,122,39,5.0,11/7/2014,"We know that the every cheesecake factory is the same, as far as the consistent menu and The way each store looks. Since this is the original cheesecake factory store, it has a special touch ! Since my office is around the corner I go there almost every day, and I do not get sick of it. Ali is The hostess with the mostest ! She is amazing along with all the rest of the employees. I will continue to go there because it's definitely the best cheesecake location in my opinion"
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,3.0,11/5/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is really about three things: (1) anything you can imagine on the menu, (2) enormous portions (though they are actually not as big as they used to be) and (3) many, many different types of cheesecake. The menu is all over the place--pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pastas, Mexican food, Chinese food, steaks, seafood, and so on.  I've found that once you get a dish here you like, you need to stick with it because there are some good dishes, some mediocre dishes and some bad ones.  A lot of it will depend on your personal taste/preferences. I went with one that I've had before--Crusted Chicken Romano.  The chicken breast was flattened and covered in a tasty and crispy cheese crust.  Sometimes, the chicken is dry, but this was okay (moist).  The chicken was served with spaghetti and a tomato sauce (pretty good; not watery, which often happens with tomato sauces).  This dish has similarities to chicken parmigiana. I passed on dessert.  Partly because I was too full (huge portion sizes), but I am also a little tired of their cheesecakes.  They are fine.  It's just that I've had so many in my life, I'm kinda never in the mood for it.  I feel the same about mint chocolate chip ice cream (it was the only ice cream my mom ever bought us...as far as I knew, mint chocolate chip was the only flavor out there). I've gone with their hot fudge sundae before as an alternative.  It is big but nothing special.  From my experience, their best cheesecake is the tiramisu cheesecake.  The wait staff often pushes the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, but it is a little too chocolately for my taste (and I love chocolate). This location in Beverly Hills near Rodeo Drive (actually the first Cheesecake Factory I ever visited) is a little smaller than the ones in Redondo Beach and Marina Del Rey.  In terms of which one is best, I think they are all pretty similar (I may like this one most).  A friend recently told me that the Redondo Beach one is a lot better than the Marina Del Rey.  I can see that because I've had a few not-so-great experiences at the Marina Del Rey location. The Cheesecake Factory prices are a little more expensive than other chains, but you really never have to order appetizers here because you are going to get more than enough food with your entree.  The Cheesecake Factory is a decent chain.  I actually like California Pizza Kitchen a little better.  The Cheesecake Factory probably has better food than CPK, but CPK is cheaper, more casual and with the right portion sizes.  I do not like to leave a restaurant too full (which is often the case at Cheesecake Factory). For this Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills, parking is available in the many nearby parking structures."
Cassidy W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",24,76,2,3.0,12/3/2012,The wait takes forever so you basically stand for a good 45 minutes doing nothing. But I love their food and it's delicious. Worth the wait
Sassoun H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",302,156,200,4.0,12/1/2011,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory.  There is one right near my house that I've been to numerous times, the one in Woodland Hills numerous times and even the one in MDR numerous times.  This one is the best.  I don't know; maybe its because its in Beverly Hills and the quality is better or the standards are higher or the kitchen staff is more qualified.  But the same food I order here that i order at the other locations just tasted and looks better.  Some of my recent favorites are the Factory Cheeseburger.  Awesome!  Big, juicy, and beefy, with fresh toppings. The bun is an actual burger bun with sesame seeds.  Not this pretentious brioche roll nonsense that every other fancy-schmancy burger joint is all gung-ho about.  The fries, i have to admit, can be better.  Frozen i think.  Not bad, but can be much better.  I tried the orange chicken a few weeks back.  Now i don't want to offend any die hard panda express fans by saying this, but this is the best orange chicken I've ever had.  Big pieces, all white meat, not all crust either.  great texture.  a lot of orange flavor.  I loved it. i can go on and on.  They have such an extensive menu that all i can say is , the Beverly Hills Cheesecake Factory is the best!  I love it, i go there often, i look forward to going and i think I'll go today, so there! By the way, great staff too.  I've never had a problem with the service or wait time!"
Russell J.,"Marietta, GA",1,10,,3.0,1/28/2012,"Very broad menu, with something for everyone, including several good vegetarian options. The veggie burger was  very good. The people-watching is as good as the cheesecake selections, and just as cheesy."
