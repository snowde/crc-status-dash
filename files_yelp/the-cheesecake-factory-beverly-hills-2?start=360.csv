Brandon C.,"Pleasanton, CA",57,473,16,4.0,7/18/2008,"I am an fan of Cheesecake Factory and the BH location is no exception. It is in a great location, parking is easy in the nearby garage and I have never had to wait here. We usually eat there around 8. The variety of food is great and down to earth. Very nice when I had been dining at a lot fancier dining restaurants this past week which were more formal. Service is decent and the dessert is always good. It's a comfortable hang out whenever I'm in town."
Vin G.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,53,29,3.0,11/30/2012,The food was great but the staff was tired and the waiter not in the mood so you don't really feel comfortable asking for simple water refill. I can't say I won't go back because the food is good but if my next waiter is tired and not in the mood to take my orders ill just eat somewhere else.
Gary F.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",121,49,3,4.0,1/14/2013,"When traveling I usually hit up a Cheesecake Factory once. They have a huge selection of food and I can get a cheesecake to go for the hotel room to last me the rest of the trip. I like the club sandwich. It's big. All in all I'd say, this place doesn't suck."
Kathlin C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",235,35,14,3.0,1/31/2013,"For years, since my childhood I saw The Cheesecake Factory as an ultimate destination for luxuries dining. And it yet to fulfill my expectation. One might disagree with me, but I really like their atmosphere, decor, staff, etc.  I went there many times and the food has never been that great unfortunately."
Joel A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/29/2013,"Ordered a filet steak 20 minutes before closing last week at the Cheesecake Factory Beverly Hills since everywhere else was closed. Unbelievable! The steak was perfect, service the usual friendly Cheesecake service and a bowl of fresh strawberries were the perfect desert."
Phoenix A.,"Seattle, WA",921,737,37,4.0,5/4/2008,"Here I am in a city crawling with decent eateries and I end up at Cheesecake Factory.  I think I was still in a daze from my massage at Skin Haven, so it's their fault. But I am surprised to say that I had a pretty good time there.  Maybe the massage was the key???  There wasn't a wait at the 1 o'clock hour on a Sunday and everyone working there was seemingly happy (I think of the movie ""Waiting"" when I'm in a restaurant like this). But Kelli, my server, was on fire with personality and service and the upsell, my overall bitterness with the Cheesecake Factory had nothing to do with her.  She brought me cheese broccoli soup, I ate it.  My fresh spring rolll were very very delicious, I might even venture so say close to those one I might find at a Vietnamese restaurant?  Probably pushing it, but I'll risk the yes.  And finally, Kelli brought me the main reason why I hate Cheesecake Factory, a whole iceberg lettuce head BLT salad the size of the friggin moon!!!!  It was good, covered in tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, and bacon.  I ate a crater.  Then Kelli tried to tempt me with some orgasmic chocolate explosion and I had to make her stop.  Enough, Kelli.  But she put my salad in a giant bag, I tipped her phat and I was on my way. These 4 stars...they are all just for you, Kelli."
Sebastian L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",57,221,26,4.0,6/16/2010,"The pros: consistency, consistency, consistency. You know what you're getting when you go to any Cheesecake Factory, and it's no different at this location. And the prices aren't too bad (though I'm usually that cheapo guy who orders water with my meals...I'm not okay with paying $4 for a lemonade or soda). My personal fave is the Renee's Special: Turkey Sandwich, a salad AND a bowl of soup...for $11?! Can you beat that? Or if you get there before 5, they've got the pizza/salad combo for $10 which is a steal. Kudos to the bartender James and the server David. Both are stellar. The cons: parking can be a little touch-and-go on N. Bev at times and I hate that Cheesecake is usually packed and you have to wait around."
Joshua L.,"Irvine, CA",0,11,,3.0,10/25/2012,"Was solid, about what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  Good food, alright service, worth visiting."
Justin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,71,,4.0,4/18/2010,"I have never been a fan of chain restaurants, in fact, I usually hate them. The Cheesecake Factory, however, is a exception. I have always liked the restaurant because of the amount of options on the menu, from salads, pasta, burgers, sandwiches and breakfast. Plus The Cheesecake Factory has some of the best desserts on the planet.  I have a couple of favorites at the Cheesecake Factory. I love the Avocado and Chicken Club. It is very large but it is a sandwich that I can finish but when I do, it does not feel like I ate to much, I do not feel sick after eating it all. I usually get it with a salad and not fries and I like the fact that a salad is not extra than fries. I also like the Turkey Burger, the Sun-dried Tomato Fettuccine Pasta and pretty much all the salads. I also like that they have a fully-stocked bar where you can order anything off the menu.  I also love the fact that The Cheesecake Factory now has a bar menu, or a small bite menu as they call it. One thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that the portions are huge, it is no wonder why Americans are so fat.  I am a chocolate addict and I believe The Cheesecake Factory has two of the best chocolate desserts I have ever had. My favorite is the Godiva Cheesecake, which is basically Godiva in a cheesecake, need I say more? The other is a chocolate mousse cheesecake, the name says it all.  Pretty much all The Cheesecake Factories are the same, however, the Beverly Hills location has always been a little better. I have always thought the service was always pleasant, the bartenders are always nice and frankly they are funny. Parking anywhere in Beverly Hills is a problem, however, the Cheesecake Factory has plenty of options. If you are lucky enough to grab a spot on Beverly Dr. or on a street located close to the resturauant, do it. There are also parking lots that are not far from the restaurant or you can valet at the restaurant but it costs around $10.  One thing about the Cheesecake Factory that drives me insane is that they do not take reservations, at any location unless it is a weekend and you are in a large party. Sometimes people can wait two hours, something I would never do, but I think if you have customers routinely waiting that long, you need to accept reservations. I honestly believe the reason The Cheesecake Factory does not accept reservations is so people will buy drinks while waiting hours for a table."
Farrah R.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,5.0,3/23/2014,"Stopped in for a quick bite this afternoon at the bar. Everything was so good! James, the bartender makes the best Long Island iced teas ever! And Andrew, the server was so knowledgable and sweet! I always look forward to coming here- everything is always great"
Dominique M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1969,373,2503,3.0,11/14/2009,"Oh my goodness, I've died and gone to fat ass land! I've never been able to come to cheesecake factory with getting a slice of cheesecake. I think that would just be wrong. I had never been to the Beverly Hills location before however really liked this location. I came on a date and we both had seafood plates, he had the ahi tuna with a nice looking salad and I had the herb crusted salmon with mash potato's and asparagus. I forgot how much I liked asparagus. I think my plate was the five star winner! The ahi tuna was good also just didn't appear to look at that filling... The fresh bread this visit didn't seem all that fresh or warm and fluffy... I had a fruit cocktail with a pineapple, orange,and lime slice in it, it was far to sweet which tasted like a over syrupy Italian soda... We ended up sharing a cheesecake slice we picked the pumpkin cheesecake and pecan... and both order a cup of tea on the side. Now...  Imagine a slice of pumpkin cheesecake and a slice of pecan pie put on top of each other... AMAZING! The service was slow at this location."
Ed U.,"Beverly Hills, CA",92,19,10,1.0,12/12/2010,"I've had drinks and dinner here more than 5000 times, I kid you not. The manager Mark, just kicked me out of the restaurant because they made my order wrong TWICE. I didn't leave and he walked away. This is a sad situation for me, who arguably has dined here more times than anyone, including big-top management---"
Brinda J.,"San Diego, CA",433,1068,111,3.0,10/21/2009,"I've been here twice, once with the man and the other with the gf. Their non-lunch salad portion I expected to be bigger, their bread fresh and soft and their tea to be better. Salad was small, bread was hard and stale and salad not too big, not enough tuna for the tuna tartar, service not that spectacular, tea was ok just not enough to brew. But it's a great people watching place, all those so-called super fabulous Beverly Hills people milling about."
Steven P.,"Danville, CA",17,260,22,4.0,12/23/2008,"Not too fancy or expensive. You can actually relax there. But make sure you are HUNGRY!  The servings are HUGE! The ice tea is the best I have ever had! This is the original one and they have some stuff on the menu you can't get anywhere else. It's clean, nice staff, good food, and not expensive.  Great for lunch or dinner.  (kind of a small inside compared to other CCF, but usually not too busy.)"
Elise H.,"Long Beach, CA",122,48,38,4.0,4/14/2011,"You really can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! I have been going for years, and for years they have been consistenly good. My favorite appetizer is the avocado eggrolls and if you love avocado like I do please do not skip ordering some up! Depending on what you're in the mood to eat you have a long list of entrees to choose from and trust me they have something for everybody! My beverage of choice is the Well-Mannered Dirty Martini, consists of Ketel One vodka with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Nobody does this drink like Cheesecake Factory!!! This place is great for date night or chilling with friends/family. They have outdoor seating as well and the ocean view (at the Redondo Beach location) is kinda cool. I very seldomlyget to the actual ""cheesecake"" experience but when I do I almost alway get the Reese Peanutbutter Cup and it is really good!"
Eri H.,"West Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,7/1/2012,"Sometimes I really want to eat  ""Original cheese cake""  and My favorite menu is Chicken Madeira"" yumm yumm mozzarella))"
Nicole T.,"West Hollywood, CA",218,51,30,4.0,8/10/2011,"Well, it's pretty much like any other Cheesecake Factory except parking is worse.  Service is good.  Menu is about 17 pages long and riddled with advertisements.  Food is delicious and not the least bit healthy.  Although they do have certain ""healthy"" items and I appreciate that.  But the regular items might just give you a heart attack if you eat the whole portion.  My boyfriend always orders the Da Vinci Pasta which I find a bit unexciting but still good.  My current favorite item is the Chopped Salad.  I hate going to restaurants and ordering the chopped salad and when it comes out you find all kinds of huge pieces.  Not a problem here.  It's CHOPPED-chopped.   Basically, a very consistent restaurant.  There's something for everyone on the gargantuan menu.  Don't forget to save room for cheesecake!  (I usually have to take my slice to go and eat it as a midnight snack, after I've digested dinner.) PS: They're open til 11 which is great if you're a latenight diner like me!"
Jaeloween F.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,44,,4.0,10/6/2011,"Franchises are not my first choice... But this place is consistent, friendly and serve the best Chinese Chicken Salad. I LOVE IT and can never seem to deviate from that one item. It's a must if you like salad's."
Jennisha M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/30/2012,"My family, boyfriend, and I came here for my birthday and had THE worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory EVER. I go to different franchises of this restaurant, but I thought the service would be spectacular since it is in Beverly Hills-I thought wrong. We were seated with no issue, but the hostess ended up taking both our drink orders and entree orders because our waitress, Kelly, did not acknowledge us. Actually, she never introduced herself and I had to ask another employee for her name. The service was terrible, I felt rushed and the employees did not seem happy at all. Another thing, the open kitchen in this particular restaurant is something I have never seen at a Cheesecake Factory. However, all the employees were snacking on food and soda the whole time! They were just socializing amongst themselves and it was very unprofessional the way they were acting. I would have given this restaurant one star, but the food was good overall."
Ellie G.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,4,2.0,10/20/2013,"We went there with our kids. Didnt like it at all...it was super busy on a Sunday night. They don't have wifi. They didnt have any paper/crayons for kids. We asked for paper and pen and they said they don't have! The food was ok, but nothing special or super tasty. And again very very busy and NOT child friendly!"
