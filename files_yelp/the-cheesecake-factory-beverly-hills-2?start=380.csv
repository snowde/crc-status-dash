M. S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,27,30,4.0,4/28/2009,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! They serve you a large portion of food for a reasonable price. Plus the staff is very friendly.   Here are a couple of my favorite dishes:  Calamari, Spinach dip with chips, Frozen Iced Mango, Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Littles and more.  Oh and i love those fresh baked brown bread that they give you while you're waiting for your food.  Yum!"
Striker R.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,107,3,2.0,8/30/2011,"Very disappointing experience today. Our server was very curt and seemed annoyed. We ordered a Spinach Dip appetizer and 3 entress; Chicken Fettucine, Factory Chopped Salad and a Quesadilla. After waiting 15 min we flagged down our server to ask where the appetizer was. She snapped back something like, I'll bring it out when it's ready. We reiterated that we wanted the app BEFORE the entrees. Next thing you know, here come the entrees before the appetizer. We send the food back. Next comes the Manager apologizing for the mix up in the back, the server forgot to place the app order, and would we please take our entrees back since they were hot. Huh? The Manager comp'd the Spinach Dip and said he'd be back to check on us. Never saw him, never saw our server again except when she checked on the table next to us and completely ignored us. Not impressed with the customer service this time."
ramin s.,"Beverly Hills, CA",30,71,,4.0,8/13/2011,"This place never changes. I have been here about 50 times in my life. My friend brought me for my birthday a few months ago. The service was fine. I had the crusted salmon salad and iced tea. she had chicken with mashed potatoes. she had to excuse herself but I knew she was walking up to the waiter to mention that it was my birthday. along with a birthday song arrived a godiva chocolate cheesecake. it was UNBELIEVABLE. we shared it even though I wanted to eat the whole thing, well it was my birthday."
Tony Y. Jr. Y.,"Glendale, CA",63,490,1443,4.0,3/25/2009,"After eating here, the waiter suggested I go the website on the receipt and complete the survey to get a gift card.  I completed the survey and received two $10 gift cards!  I received one for the Grand Luxe and another for The Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
douglas c.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,173,1,1.0,7/30/2011,"Whoa you would think in Beverly Hills, no less. This is my fourth and final trip to the Beverly Hills Cheesecake Factory on Beverly Boulevard in the past 3 months. Each and every time I had either diry dishes or dirty cutlery, eccch!! The two last times we also had extremely poor service, with the hot dishes being served at best at room temperature. the couple at the table beside us just gave up[ and left, the manager Ian did as well as our waiter who was a bad as they come. No more chances for these guys. Maybe a call from the health department would make them wake up!"
Katrina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,69,,4.0,5/11/2011,"I have visited this Cheesecake Factory 3x's since this experience and have never had the same problems.  Each and every time we have had wonderful service, wonderful food, great portions!  Also, we have sat at the bar and had a wonderful time there also!"
Christine Faith B.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,19,1,3.0,6/9/2011,"I've gone to Cheesecake Factory (both at the Grove, the Americana, and Pasadena) enough to say that at first, its amazing, but when you come back, you wonder why you loved it in the first place. It's like an old crush, you wonder why you liked him/her in the first place. Overpriced, too long of a wait, alright service, and it's TOO DARK in there! The food is not bad and the cheesecakes are good, but I wouldn't wait 2 hours to eat here. On a quiet lunch maybe."
Z P.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,86,4,5.0,6/6/2008,"Having ""grown up"" by way of being employed in this particular Cheesecake Factory from early 1979-1996 it BREAKS MY HEART DEEPLY to read such poor reviews!  I was part of an opening team when the restaurant was a measly 1500 square feet and helped to grow it into the empire it is today.  My name has been associated with this joint for most of my adult life.  It's even still hard not to drive by, see a light burnt out at top and not want to call the manager and tell them to ask Martin to replace it RIGHT NOW just like D.O.did on many an occasion.   We prided ourselves on reinventing superlative service and consistent quality food.  It was a really fun place to work, too.  R.G and I OWNED that front room and nobody could turn a table much less an entire restaurant like L.C.  I single handedly learned more from her about the public and how to deal with them, particularly on Beverly Drive than anybody!  D.O used to cashier in my day and play the drums at company parties in the ""garage"".   Those were the days, my friend.  If anyone remembers those days, I'd love to hear from ya. The Cheescake Factory will alway get FIVE stars from me.  It was super instrumental to my success today!  Give it another shot and tell Spooky, Martin and Jose Agudo I sent you. Ciao!"
Paul G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,47,8,4.0,7/18/2011,"It's good for what it is.  They have everything you can imagine. Asian, Italian, American, Mexican.  Service is good and friendly and fast.  Enormous portions (and fat customers).  It's good and consistent.  Very touristy."
Joy B.,"Irvine, CA",70,234,32,4.0,4/4/2011,"Let me just say, that I've never been unhappy with my food at Cheesecake Factory. I've settled into a 4 cheese pasta groove and I'm perfectly happy staying there. That said, from an outdoor patio diner the service at this location is pretty bad. I like to bring my dog when I come so I always opt for the patio and they always seem to forget I exist..... During my last visit on a slow Sunday afternoon the hostess said she was sending someone out to clean our table and seat us and 15 min later I had to go back in and find her because she apparently forgot.... Whoever cleared our table didn't come back to wipe it down or put place settings but we were sick of waiting and just sat down. We received our bread but still no place settings- asked for some but they never came so we just made do with our butter packets. Waved down a busboy for some place settings right before our food came and I guess he thought we were just having bread for lunch since all we got were knives...  Yes, we finally got some place settings and had a delicious lunch.  Yes, the cheesecake rocked. Yes, I'll be back.  But come on Cheesecake Factory, you are in the heart of Beverly Hills just one street over from Rodeo Drive, step up your game."
J K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/8/2014,"A few weeks back went for lunch. We used to go here a lot but quality has apparently declined dramatically. We ordered a plain omelette with bagel and a cheeseburger. When it arrived and service was quite slow, the cheeseburger actually had green mold on the cheese that was very visible!The omelette was an oily mess that looked more like a greasy soup than an egg. The bagel was stale. They did offer to make new meals and they comped our entire meal but it was so disgusting that I lost my appetite and would never go back. One star is one star too many!"
Bigjohn S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,11,,5.0,11/7/2010,"Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch or Dinner, get down and Jam with the Jammers. Always fantastic, and they get me in and out.  Drinks? Try a Flying Gorilla. Here is a big secret try the the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  You will lose your mind.  If you do not have a great experience here your just a hater. For Serious Pallets only."
Aimee K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,3.0,12/23/2011,This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory.  I live near Grove but always go to this to buy cheesecake.
J. V.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,10,2,3.0,8/27/2011,"I have enjoyed several Cheesecake Factory locations - this location was a bit lack luster.  While it featured everything of a typical Cheesecake Factory, the service was slow and not pleasant.  The space itself it smaller, but the food was as good as ever."
Jordan H.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",3,33,5,4.0,9/12/2008,"I live in BH and this is a common place we go to eat.  For the most part the place is good.  As long as you don't get the server from hell; Anita.  She is just god awful.  The couple sitting next to us had an accent and she had the nerve to yell at gentalmen, ""I can't take your order cause I don't know what you are saying"" and he was a early 70s man with a typical Eastern European accent.  I could understand him just fine.  She ended up making the busser take our order on a piece of paper cause we were ""too difficult to please"" when asking for a refill on my lemonade for the FIRST TIME!  If you don't get her it's a decent time.  Portions are huge so the larger folks will be satisfied too!  Bartenders are usually great and offer up nice conversation and never let your drinks go empty! I recommend it just make sure you ask to NOT be seated in Anita's section."
Maxine V.,"Lompoc, CA",144,27,7,1.0,4/12/2013,"I went to this specific location maybe a few weeks ago and was so disappointed with not only the food but horrible service. Some friends of mine and my husbands had never been to the cheesecake factory since we all live on Vandenberg Airforce base the closest location is at least an hour away and when we planned a trip to LA I thought this would be the perfect chance to show them a real treat. I live in WA previously and loved the cheescake factory in Seattle but this was nothing like it. We waited about 15 mins to be sat witch was understandable because we needed a highchair, but when we sat down the restaurant was pretty empty and we sat down to a disgustingly dirty booth there was food still stuck to the table and lots of crumbs and noodles still on the seats the highchair was even dirty! and when i notified the host she walked over with an attitude and hastily tried to sweep. We sat down and waited and waited then randomly a cook or bus boy dropped of bread and reached into the middle of the table without saying a word. Awkward, few minutes later our waiter came by and we were all ready to order, she didn't introduce herself or make us feel welcome. We almost felt like we were being looked down upon. To wrap this bad experience up all our food arrived separately and took much to long. I was upset and disappointed by this experience we planned our whole day around this dinner. I did speak to the manager after dinner and she gave me a half fake sorry . I also wrote and email to corporate, recently and have gotten a response but will not be likely to visit this particular location again"
Cate T.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,334,665,4.0,8/7/2008,"A friend and I had a subscription to three Paley events in Beverly Hills, and afterwards, we would go to this Cheesecake Factory for dinner since it was close and one of the few places still open in the area.  I don't know why, but we always got REALLY good service here.  The one nearest me at home is the one in Old Town Pasadena, and their service is crap! I always love the wait staff at the Beverly Hills one. We've just gotten some really good ones! Oddly, enough, we always get seated around the same front section near the bar, too."
Gregor G.,"San Francisco, CA",400,560,108,3.0,7/8/2007,"This is the first Cheesecake Factory location I ever visited, so it's getting my review. No matter how much people bag on this theme chain, they have really nice comfort food offerings (yes, I'm talking about meatloaf), plus more than earned their moniker by proving themselves as grand masters o' dessert."
solange s.,"Beverly Hills, CA",8,131,23,3.0,6/30/2013,"We ate here again just this evening.  I asked our waiter just for funzies and seriously wanting to hear what he would say, if their food contains GMO's either directly or indirectly through the food chain.  He said he didn't know, something I find a bit odd in this time of raised food consciousness.  He said he would go and ask the chef and left.  When he came back, he told me, ""No,"" their food did not contain GMO's.  I was surprised and more confident about what I was about to put into my body.  Then, after a little while of thinking about it, I asked my son if he thought that was true.  He also said, ""No, probably not.""  When we got home, I Googled Cheesecake Factory and GMO's and, sure enough, the information came up that indeed their food is full of them on every level.  So, I sent them a message telling them what I just told  you and asking them to clarify it.  In my last review, you can see I did this once and got no reply, something suspicious in my book.  OK, so we'll see what they say.  I also let them know that now it is a matter of trust.  The food is good.,  The service is also good.  I just do not want to put toxins into my body if at all possible."
Martha M.,"New York, NY",70,374,3,4.0,11/22/2008,"Kinda small, but hey, it's the original building. Fast service and nice waitstaff.  MUCH better than the CF at The Grove. Get the artichoke dip!  Try the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  Oh, and ask for extra brown bread; much better than the baguette."
