Jennifer D.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,32,4,5.0,5/31/2017,"This one & MDR are the best locations over the last 20 years.  Sit at the bar if you dont want to wait for a table.  Portions classically large. Sharable.  Apps are dinners in themselves.  Lots of Classic CCF dishes we love, but some recent menu changes have proven worrisome. :/ Note: Cheesecake serving slices have definitely gotten smaller over the years."
Amritha P.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,10,8,5.0,9/25/2017,"Excellent food- stuffed mushroom and pastas, good ambiance. Huge fan of the Red velvet cheesecake .."
Larry S.,"Seattle, WA",3,117,34,3.0,2/1/2017,"Went to have lunch and what a disappointing experience,  There were 4 of us and we were went to eat lunch before doing errands.   We were seated, and we got our Menus.  It was some time to get the waiter to come take the order, then 20 minutes to get our food which by that time the food was barley warm.   Had i know this was going to be a 2 hour lunch i would have skipped the stop at Williams and Sanoma before lunch.  There was only 2 hours Free at the parking structure."
Dustin G.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",52,5,,1.0,2/4/2017,"Don't go here. Its not worth getting worked up. Poorest of the poorest service.  Manager Brian Larsen is about he most unprofessional manager I have ever dealt with. Even while mistreating his customers and providing extremely poor service, he gives extreme attitude when confronted with the shortcomings of his staff and operation. I frequent this store, but will no longer visit any Cheesecake Factory for the way Ive been treated here.  Brian Larsen was willing to engage a shouting match across his restaurant floor to argue with an unsatisfied customer. I'd like to contacted by corporate if at all possible.  Don't go here. Its not worth getting worked up."
Yvon Meow J S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",705,268,1633,3.0,12/31/2015,"Haven't been to this location for dine-in forever so we decided to give this place one more shot.  However the food was ok but the restaurant was chaotic to say the least during dinner time. Food wise, just about everything is par and the portions are huge.  We ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the grilled chicken tostada salad.  The Thai wrap was a great choice and healthy.  I highly recommend it.  We wanted the grilled chicken tostada's pico de gallo sauce to be on the side instead of tossed, but it didn't come as we wanted ( though ok. We didn't mind).  The chicken was rubbery and chewy.  We could have had the tostada salad without the chicken.  It would have probably tasted better. This is the first Cheesecake Factory that I came to as a kid, and it used to be busy as well all the time but well managed and organized.  It's kinda sad to revisit and see this place a chaos with a crowd hovering around the check in table and bumping into each other while the waiters and waitresses can hardly do their jobs right.   I am sure the cheesecakes are delish.  We didn't have any desserts because I pretty much lost my appetite sitting in this restaurant watching chaos flashing right in front of my face between the customers impatiently waiting to get their tables versus waiters & waitresses bring out the wrong charges to the wrong tables....yikes. What a mess!! I recommend this place for ordering take outs only.  The dine in experience just ruins the good food that this place has to offer.  Sorry, still 3 stars."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,,4.0,9/16/2017,"Great menu for affordable prices in Beverly Hills. However, decoration is terrible and depressive. It needs to be renovated."
Ellen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/20/2017,"Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills has been going dowhill for years but today was the worst. Service was sooo slow probably because they had customers ( it was a holiday) & they're not used to having a lot of customers anymore.  I ordered almond crusted salmon salad for $15.50. What a joke! The piece of salmon was as big as 1 finger. The salad itself was teeny tiny and I had to wait at least a half an hour for it! Apparently they've either really cheaped out or they ran out of food. ( BTW that's happened before.) My friend ordered the salmon lunch plate. She was even luckier than me. Her salmon was totally raw inside so she got to wait an extra 10+ minutes while they cooked another piece for her. In other words, we ate in shifts. Not the way to ""have lunch together."" The  manager did her best to fix things but the whole experience was so bad that we couldn't wait to get out."
Bat M.,"Playa del Rey, CA",173,25,,5.0,7/21/2017,"Great Food, Great Servers, nice place....oh and the cheese cake rocks....negative...kinda small I like others better!"
Bobbi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,11/26/2017,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but last night was yuk.  Five of us were there celebrating my granddaughters birthday, and was very disappointed with the food.  The waiter George M was great. I don't like to send food back, because I fear repercussions from the chefs.  I called the manager and explained what happened, she just made excuses. I'm done with this place. I'll have my celebrations some place else. This was special to me, she was visiting from out of state."
Wok C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,25,33,1.0,7/12/2017,"'this location suckssssss, big time.' I don't know who the 'to go' section think they are but every time i pick up whoever is on duty SUCK!!! Excuse my French of that I am part of but I cannot refrain my anger with this place tonight, Mon.10th July 2017. Customers take note what I've seen while awaiting a pick up order. I have seen staff swipe spilt fries back onto plates with their bare hands. I have seen food plates returned to kitchen counter for whatever reason get swiped onto another order e.g broccoli, potatoes, and don't get me started on how the bread is grabbed and just dumped into baskets. I have seen food orders reheated. e.g a plate of shrimp scampi was returned, apparently cold and it was thrown into a pan to reheat and use for another order. I have seen cooks drop stuff on the floor behind kitchen counter and pick up and use without cleaning. I saw a server sneeze/cough over food. I have seen a cheesecake decorator lick her fingers. But what got to me tonight is being lied to and then lying to. I clearly asked a woman in the pick up corner for a order. She clearly said, it isn't quite ready yet.  I txt the person who ordered and she's upset cos she was told her order was ready 30mins ago. I hand the phone over to the lady who I spoke to and she tells the person the order has been ready.  So, here we go ... We get into it and the woman at Cheesecake Factory pushes the order to me and that was it. The nerve of this woman, at 'to go' section to lie to me and the person who ordered didn't surprise me cos ive heard workers in this section make up lies to customers picking up or ordering. And this was the last time for me.  I've waited at sugarfish locations up to 1hr to 1hr15mins but at least the staff keeps it real with you on wait time. The only reason this location has customers is bcos it's the least expensive place in Beverly Hills with big portions and a semi ok menu for a average price range when your trying to eat out with a family but not spend $500. Check your utensils, plates and cups people. I'd question the sterilization of everything at this location.  The cooks can't keep up with the pace of orders and customers need to be told the truth of wait time that is 45mins from time of order when place is busy and not lied to that the crappy food has been ready.  Ridiculous. HIGHLIGHT: The host section and the bar section is the only organized and friendly staff you come across. SO, if anything eat at the bar, you'll always be pleased with the bartenders on duty. By the way, I have the name of the lady from Monday night.  I'll be courteous enough to not call you out woman but mark my words, one day a customer will go off at you on site. Your too much of a liar and idiot for my time to waste. This location needs a health inspector to walk in random to review. And that's where my complaint on Yelp is going. Tourists/visitors/locals go to another location or pay a lil more to eat clean well prepped and made food.  Better than the rubbish served at this CFactory. I will never go to this location ever again.  And from the low star rating by many on Yelp I'm not the only one.  Ive only ever stopped by because it's the closest location to my location.  It use to be a cool handy spot so that one could enjoy site seeing after eating.  Now it's CRAP! Please note: guest services do not attempt to reach out on my review cos I've seen that's all you do but no changes are made.   #can'tstopwon'tstop"
Steve G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/2/2017,"Well, all honeymoon's end. We are neighbors and patrons for over fifteen years. This was essentially our kitchen for the last few years. Generally, while inconsistent the past couple of years, there has been no major complaint. Tonight, well, was down the tubes and our swan song.   My wife's turkey avocado sandwich came with no bacon, a skimpy bit of turkey, no avocado and ice cold. When sent back, it took ""forever"" for it to return (we all finished our meals before it returned). The ""manager"" A.E. came over to try and say it was correct, but after a small ""discussion"", apologized and acknowledged the order was wrong (the server never did). A.E. offered to do it again or comp it, along with a hot fudge sundae (appropriate). No hot fudge sundae ever arrived. When my wife asked A.E.about the lost sundae her response was ""I didn't say I'd comp that.""  Huh? We heard it. It's one thing to make an offer - another to dodge the issue. We're done. Patrons who stand in line may not take notice here, but management should put some more effort in their training.  Plenty of other places to eat in BH for residents."
Tatyaja S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,74,4,4.0,9/16/2017,Came here after a wedding. Delicious!! And we tried the new coconut vhicken. Yum! Our waiter Kevin was very friendly and very gregarious. I will be back!! The drinks were nice and strong too. Yum!!!!!
Jamie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,103,123,3.0,1/14/2017,"3 star for the desserts only.  Never enjoyed the service here. Food is tasty and often comes with huge portions, but also along with the calories. On the other hand if you go with healthier options like skinnylicious menu, everything is pretty bland. That makes you wonder they don't know how to cook good food without making it wildly unhealthy.  There's oftentimes wait here during peak times."
Jason S.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/12/2017,"I've only ordered take out from this location but their service is superb! I always order for our group at work which is not easy as we all like to substitute things on our dishes. They have always accommodated the additions or substitutions on the dishes. AND they've yet to get the orders wrong. Kudos to their take out people AND the kitchen staff. My favorite dish is the louisiana chicken pasta, minus the veggies. Who needs vegetables to ruin a pasta dish lol i recently tried their anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake and my goodness it is delightful. It seemed to be a bigger slice than the regular cheesecakes sold too. I could be wrong though but it did look bigger."
David Y.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",79,203,6,3.0,8/11/2017,Such amazing food Cheesecake Factory has but wow does it give you bathroom issues ! Eating at Cheesecake Factory will throw you on the toilet for hours and hours if not days ! My parents can't stand the smell of the toilet from all the food I ate here ! If you want your toilet to smell up an entire block come here !
Erin B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,28,2,1.0,9/1/2017,"Absolutely horrible.  We ordered this on Postmates and the food arrived dried out and cold.  Tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for 3 hours then was removed and got cold and stale.  Not only that, but the cheesecake had what I believe is a piece of parchment paper baked between the layers.  Imagine biting into cheesecake and getting a mouth full of nasty paper.  I will never eat there again.  Absolutely horrible."
Rosie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,22,53,4.0,3/24/2017,"Although this place is been around forever, it still maintains the professionalism, good service and quality food items that you're familiar with. You should ask for the skinny licious menu so you don't have to eat 1,000,000 calories! It's just as good just a more healthy version.  We tried the chop salad and veggie salad and the turkey avocado sandwich all delicious. Kids menu has a very generous spaghetti and meatballs is also served with a nice drink. Sitting on the patio on Beverly Drive is always fun for people watching. Thanks to Philip for a great attentive service! (Support staff like the busboys seem a little bit slower and don't respond directly to customer requests."
Helen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,29,29,4.0,7/31/2017,Like this place. The hostess is sassy and nice and the servers also. The food is good too but the calamari we ordered was not cooked all the way. The batter was still flaky and white. It was all bunched up and the inside was not fully cooked. Other than that rest of the food was good!
Zina I.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,48,1.0,8/11/2017,"I would expect this with any Resturant except Cheesecake Factory when we ordered lunch to office I got ""Luisiana chicken"" I was shocked and disgust me all the day long as a pregnant when I saw a BUNCH of Hair not ONE in my plate!"
