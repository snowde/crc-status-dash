Kim B.,"Pasadena, CA",39,127,8,3.0,3/19/2007,"I think there's a Cheesecake Factory in the parking lot of every major mall in every suburb in America now.  This particular location is responsible for that phenomenon, seeing as how it's the first location. I shared a Kobe Burger and fries with the boyfriend since we knew the food is always brought to the table on a ginormous turkey platter.  It was good, juicy and cooked just the way we requested.  Lots of grilled onions and mushrooms added to the yumminess.  French fries tasted freshly fried, always nice.   I took 2 stars off because of the shotty service.  We were there at 3:30 on a weekday, not exactly the busiest time ....yet we still had to constantly flag down a server to refill our drinks.  The check took FOREVER...ok maybe not literally but it took too long, 15 minutes I think.  The staff was polite and friendly but did make us feel a bit like we were interrupting their busy group discussions about auditions and gigs.  Blech."
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,4.0,8/28/2008,"I love the Cheesecake Factory chain.  Most of the ones I've been to I love.  I had to subtract a star from this one because it lacked atmosphere.   Well, I guess the lack of atmosphere is an atmosphere but not one conducive to a great time.     The food was great, the service was great but it was definitely lacking something to make it great."
Sandy L.,"Wellington, New Zealand",0,12,,3.0,8/21/2013,"Food at the Cheesecake Factory, like always, was good.  However I find the service at this location to be very slow.  My server was very friendly and cheerful but I waited through the entire meal to get our drinks refilled.  I finally had to flag down our waitress and ask for our refills, but even that took a while. Also, another waiter (not our own) came by and swiped out sugar packets for another table.  Straight from our table!"
LA to PDX ..,"Portland, OR",6,105,3,1.0,12/15/2006,"I hesitated to write a review for a chain restaurant but I felt especially motivated to do so after an especially unpleasant experience last visit. I, along with a friend, were seated relatively promptly but after placing our orders, over an hour passed with no sign of our food.  The folks next to us indicated some sort of similar displeasure and it turned out that their food was given to the table on the other side of theirs.  So one table got the wrong food, another had their food given to this other table and we had none whatsoever.  Our server came by and when I inquired he came back with the answer, oh, we didn't put your order in.   He promised that the manager would come by to speak with us, but he never did, but we were offered a free dessert for our trouble.  Well, well, well... that should almost cover the parking garage fees I had to pay for the extra time spent waiting for the food (which was not very good, my friend couldn't even eat his fish tacos, which tasted like dry chicken instead of the tuna that was promised).   Again, I don't expect much from a place like Cheesecake Factory but I expect a hell of a lot more than this particular location can manage.  Do yourself a favor, go to the one in Old Town Pasadena if you're hungry for what they've got, make a nice drive out of it and you will probably still end up eating at the same time as if you chose the BH location. I wish Yelp had a negative star rating.  I basically want to spare other people the complete disappointment I felt here."
Nathan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,71,,1.0,6/26/2007,"I wouldn't hate this place so much if people didn't rave about it and think it is WORTH IT to wait 45 MINUTES or more to eat here.  I really struggle when someone drags me to this place - and I do have to be dragged (or drug? - how 'bout ""drugged"" - you have to drug me to get me into this place). WHY?  I just don't understand.  The food is okay.  The cheesecake is okay.  But, I can find ninety hundred other places with a much shorter wait, and equal or better food and dessert for equal or less the price. It all goes to show how we're like lemmings.  ""go to cheesecake factory, it is SO good"".  oh, okay, let me get onto the waiting list.  maybe one day people will wake up and think, ""hey, that place isn't really that good.  in fact, it's actually pretty lame."" I just can't help but think this is the place where people go who can't come up with a better idea."
Oliver E.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/14/2012,"The only reason i gave this place one star is because the food is good. The reason i gave this place one star and not 5 is because of the service. Drew, the manager, is the most unprofessional, unaccomodating, helpless employee at the restaurant. I was a patron of this establishment for over 8 years and because of the manager DREW i will never eat from there again. I really hope that this review helps. If you are looking for a good place to eat with possibly the worlds worst service weather its dine in or take out i would advise you eat there. If you want to enjoy your meal and have amazing service i highly advise that you don't visit this establishment. I can't believe management would choose someone as unprofessional drew to be the manager of a restaurant. i had a truly terrible experience thanks to DREW."
JayChan H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",471,433,773,3.0,12/18/2005,"Nice decor and lots of food for the money but I'd rather spend more and get something I will enjoy eating. I give it three stars because.....(in one breath)..... they have a beautiful wait staff that treats everyone as if they are amazingly important and have good taste even though they are sitting in their restaurant instead of  one of the other nicer places on the same block. *deep breath*  Having said that, if you like Cheesecake Factory, this location will not disappoint."
Mike G.,"Tulsa, OK",4,48,4,3.0,11/8/2010,"Amazingly - it tastes like the Factory in Chicago, Tampa and Plano.  Good lunch - great salmon.  Sticking with a 3 because it's a plain-jane chain.  Staff and food was good though."
Lisa L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,27,1,4.0,3/28/2011,"I took some friends from the UK here on Sunday.  I went in to the meal annoyed because I wanted to go to a famous Beverly Hills joint, but my husband didn't have it in him....so Cheesecak Factory here we go.  Looking through our overseas visitors eyes gave me a whole new appreciation for this place.  They were wowed by the menu, the food was solid and the service was great.  Our friend said, ""we're impressed with the service in the states.  you don't get this level of service at home.""  They were right!  It was a really good experience.  We even took some cheesecake  home for later."
Rebekah H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,4,5,2.0,12/12/2010,"I think I am a glutton for punishment...I keep coming back even when they get it wrong! What can I say? I really love the place. It's just that sometimes it takes a few times to get it right, but the service is great! How can you forget BBQ sauce on the BBQ ranch chicken salad...oh well...they know I will come back..."
Kenny J.,"Torrance, CA",29,47,1,4.0,8/22/2012,"I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory and with their new skinnylicious menu, it's easier to find something that's not over 1,500 calories. They have a huge menu and their cheesecakes are delicious. What more could you want?"
Cathrine G.,"Culver City, CA",154,28,2,4.0,11/20/2010,Our favorite late night stop! The tuna tempura roll is a great appetizer and the shrimp scampi never disappoints! And the pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal) is my favorite. Or the classic white chocolate rasberry...can't go wrong!
Valerie H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/5/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a wonderful restaurant that never disappoints.  We ate there yesterday, and we ordered from the skinnylicious menu.  Everything we ordered was delicious without any guilt about what we were eating. The service is always perfect, and the staff very friendly.  We go there quite often as we are never disappointed.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy a good meal."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,3.0,6/26/2007,"Sure there are lots of other places to eat, and I've been to lots of them, but what's wrong with chain restaurants?  I hate that I have to beg people to go to the one closest to me because ""you live in S.F. home to some of the best dining experiences...yada yada..."" Say what you say but give me that food any day!  It's like a little slice of home for me.  I always know what I'm going to get, and I'll always know it will be good. This location is good because the wait is never that long."
Jin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,55,5,4.0,7/6/2007,"I have no clue why I went here.. but it was with a group of friends.. 1 married couple, 1 about-to-be married couple, and me and my date. If I would of known the waiting time, I would of probably told everyone to meet me at the Groove cheesecake Factory... I mean yes there is waiting time at the Groove location, but not for an hour or two.   It was just so ridiculus... and since we had 6 people, it was even worse to get a table set up.   I'm going to have to vote NO on ""Good for groups"" category.. I mean 6  people, we had to wait for hour and a half to get our table ready...  Oh... and if can't find a parking on the streets.. you either have to park on the payed parking lots or hopefully there is a free parking lot open near by.  Other than that, this is just an another standard Cheesecake Factory."
Dalia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,90,,1.0,11/20/2007,"Update: I went back (I give second chances, what can I say) and after biting into my goat cheese, realized something was just not as soft and creamy as I had wished. I pulled it out of my mouth to find a wrapper to the goat cheese mixed in. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww ************** I had really missed Cheesecake factory and was so stoked to be coming here for my friend's birthday - but UGH. Not the same. Just not the same :( Ok - so the goods: we went on a Monday night, so no line. Remarkable! Also, I love the avocado eggrolls and lettuce wraps for appetizers...can never go wrong with those. Oh yeah, and the cheesecake - can never go wrong. This time we tried the unconventional banana creme cheesecake - light and creamy, not as heavy and rich as the chocolatey ones. But the bads! Oh the bads! First off, they did not have the thai beef salad on their menu!!! The horror! I knew exactly what I was going to order before opening their menu, but they got rid of it! Why I will never know.  And the service left so much to be desired. The server came 30 seconds after we were seated to ask for our drink/appetizer orders. Um hello! We just sat down! Please come back in a minute or two. TEN MINUTES LATER....no water, no bread, no server. Hello! Everything just took forever to get to us. Which shouldn't happen, especially cause it wasn't too busy of a night.  And we're in Beverly Hills...like come on...just the zip code entitles us to better service."
Sean M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/30/2008,"It's always so easy to be hard on a chain.  But I really like the Cheesecake factory, I really do.  Their martinis are awesome, their avocado eggrolls are glory, their cheesecake is A-okay with me!  Cheesecake Factory on a whole is great!  This location, however, is not quite up to par.    The wait is ridiculous, the service sucks (He must have been 14), it's cold enough to snow inside, the bathrooms are dirty (like, really dirty), and it's more expensive than other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Boo."
J.L. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,263,9,4.0,1/31/2008,"There was no wait for dinner tonight. I guess everyone was home watching ""Lost"". Anyhow, the first round of bread was a bit stale but we had the best server ever!  I ordered a small salad w/beets and asparagus and goat cheese that was quite tasty.  The appetizer of 4 hamburger sliders was good also and a great deal for $7.50 A cozy atmosphere."
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,564,13,4.0,2/22/2010,I love the Cheese Cake Factory. This location is smaller that most but the food is still excellent.  The shepards Pie was wonderful.  They have excellent warm bread to snack on while waiting for your meal. I have never had a bad meal here.  The servers go out of their way to make the most of your dinning experience.
Joe R.,"Chino Hills, CA",39,137,1,5.0,3/22/2012,"Nice good loco... smaller than your typical ccf, beware of street parking, they do check and you will get a ticket!  I know I did!"
