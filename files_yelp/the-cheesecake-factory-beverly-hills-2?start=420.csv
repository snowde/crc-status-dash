Shannon D.,"New York, NY",91,833,,4.0,8/21/2011,"This place is surprisingly good and I'm speaking for the whole chain. Had really good food here and I thought with a name ""Cheesecake Factory"" I wouldn't like it but I definitely recommend it. Pretty loud and def. kid friendly"
David W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,22,,5.0,8/6/2012,"Went here with some overseas relatives - Excellent service - hostess, waitress, bus  boys - everyone - Much more than one might expect in a tourist area - a very pleasant surprise and much appreciated - will be back - much kudos!!"
C. S.,"Studio City, CA",0,26,,4.0,6/30/2012,"The service is truly what I favor in this location. A ***** would have been issued had they still served the tasty and delectable Corn Fritters, which are definitely a must and still offered at the Sherman Oaks, CA location. Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are just that, Factory in the sense of consistency and preface by Cheesecake, you can never go wrong, always right. Their Red Velvet Cheesecake could satisfy your hunger for days, it is so rich and satisfying. The attentiveness of the staff is what keeps me returning. Thank you!"
RoamOnline C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,20,9,4.0,2/5/2010,Have gone there more than a few times .... always busy & to find parking is hard. The food is good ... nice bread & drinks are not bad either. The portions are filling too. I find it too noisy & the tables are too close to each other. I still go there all the time. I guess it's the menu - get cravings for it all the time.
Kyong F.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,20,,1.0,4/4/2013,"My coworkers and I went to Cheesecake Factory for happy hour and ordered the Buffalo Blasts, among other things.  Don't get me wrong, they were very delicious, but one of my coworkers found a piece of METAL in her chicken!!  It looked like a large, thick staple.  The manager was called over & she apologized and said that part of the metal from the frying basket must have fallen off & gotten cooked into the chicken.  She said this as if this was NORMAL.  Then she told us she'd take the charge of the $5 dish off of our check.  THAT'S ALL THEY OFFERED US after they put METAL in our chicken!!  Seriously??  None of us are the type to create a scene, but they should have comped our entire meal.  It was happy hour so our bill was only like $20 more.. they could have at LEAST done that.  But nope!  This chain rakes in millions daily & they couldn't comp our $20 meal after we found metal in our food?  Never coming back again.  I'm traumatized."
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,8/17/2009,"MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT...just not this location. I never have a complaint about the food. This CCF is small Seating really sucks. Our server Fabian...cutie pie. My girl said he would make a good vampire on True Blood. You know all the guys look like aspiring actors.  The girls not so much. The hostess looked like a bad version of the heavy Kardashian sister. She had a bit of a sarcastic attitude which my lady did not appreciate but I just let it ride. The queen wanted pasta but wanted it her way so the first time it came out she did not like it cuz the sauce was not what she expected. With no fuss no worry they made it again and took the first one off the bill. AWESOME ...Kudos to the Manager...on the floor and on his job!!! I ordered something different it was the Crispy Chicken Something or other...delish!!! Chicken was plentiful and prepared well. Potatoes and Asparagus wonderful. We shared the Brownie Cheesecake Sundae...collectively our favorite one...its cheesecake on top of a brownie with hot fudge,roasted nuts and whip cream....absolutly sinful... they forgot our cherry on top but I did not deduct for that. Then the funniest thing when we are leaving effing Jack Sparrow rolls in the spot!!! Not Johnny Depp but a drunk/homeless looking guy dressed like a pirate from the carribean...flippin hilarious. My lady was in shock, I almost pissed my pants. We don't know if he was soliciting or an actual patron....lol 4 stars I know when I am on that side of town I will be back. At the Grove you have to pay for parking and it tends to be a little more crowded but its still CCF so I will be there again as well. *Redondo Beach still my favorite Location*"
Dena H.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,4.0,2/3/2012,"I love cheesecake factory.  The service at this one is great, always very fast and cordial.  The bread is amazing, the food is always yummy, and they have the best desserts!"
Robert L.,"Long Beach, CA",1,24,,4.0,4/10/2010,"Our waitress was Renee.  Not sure if I spelled it the right way.  She was a very friendly and patience lady.  Great service and I was very please with her positive attitude when the place was so busy.  Was really working hard for her customers.  The food was pretty good.  I had pizza for the first time at Cheesecake Facotry. Clam chowder was good as well as the salad.  Evelyn's Favorite Pasat and Fettichini with Chickn and Sundried Tomato was also very delicious, chosen my girlfriend and her friend.   The only thing that kept it from a 5 star was the gentleman who brought the food to our table.  Kept pushing the plate with other plates to make room.  Could understand the plates were hot but why didn't he set the table first before he place it on our table?"
Brian M.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/21/2014,"On 1/20 I had lunch around 1:30 by myself. I don't know if I caught everyone on a bad day but the hostess was very rude, didn't look at me when she talked and ignored my question about where the restroom was. The server was even worse. She sat me in a crowded section of the restaurant when there were so many other available tables. She asked me to sit in the booth section of the table because I would be"" in the way "" of other guests. I ordered the chicken picata with extra sauce on the side, which she failed to bring me until I reminded her. She brought it to me at least 15 mins after the request and it was cold thus due to the wait my entire meal became cold. She didn't ask  once if I needed a drink refill. When I got the check I asked for change and she brought me all large bills in return instead of singles. She failed to come back so after another 15mins of waiting I flagged down another server and got the adequate change for me to leave. Very disappointing that the inaugural Cheesecake Factory in California would have this service."
Dan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,,4.0,10/30/2011,I have been to at least a dozen different Cheesecake factory locations and this is my favorite cheesecake factory. It is a little more classy and upscale. A very good date spot.
Sophie S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,66,,4.0,1/16/2012,I am really happy with the service that I received. This location is a bit smaller and more busy but I would rather be here than the one in Brentwood.
Peter J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,20,,4.0,8/26/2011,"Sure, it's not that exciting of a place, but they always have great food.  I've only been here for lunch, but they never disappoint.  As an added bonus, there are a few free places to park only a couple blocks away."
Jon F.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,284,,3.0,5/21/2011,it's the cheesecake factory. my guess is you don't need to be on yelp to learn whether or not you want to eat at the cheesecake factory
Michael K.,"Venice, CA",10,30,,1.0,3/28/2007,"I am writing this review because my prior reviews have been so universally glowing I thought it only fair to write something absolutely scathing -- gotta maintain some credibility right?  That said, the Cheesecake factory suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkksssssssssssss­ssss!!!!! is there anything on the menu that is even edible?  Were you aware, dear reader, that for a time, in the Zagats Guide to our nations capital -- the Washington DC area and environs, the Cheesecake Factory was on the list of top ten restaurants?  yes, Zagats and its popular ratings system is deeply deeply flawed.  And yes, Washington DC is lame in many ways including food.  But digging deeper I would hazard to say the Cheesecake Factory and its scary popularity gets at the seemy dark side of the American Psyche.  The gargantuan obese portions.  The profound mediocrity.  The overwhelming crappiness of the food.  And yet... people love it.  Loooove it.  Like they love their President -- I think he's at 34 percent.  And they love their guns.  And their televisions.  And their bibles which they believe to be literally true -- yes, something like 60 percent of people believe the literal story of Noah's ark with exactly forty days and nights of rain and every fucking animal getting on a boat in pairs.   But I digress.  In sum, down with the Cheesecake Factory!  Down with Corporate Food!  Long live stinky runny cheese and fine wine!"
Avital C.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,118,8,5.0,11/10/2011,"no waiting to be seated for dinner time which was great, i hate waiting especially in bev hills...... service was great, got this nice attentive young male, of course i had to indulge in my fav Ritz Martini , i had 2 of them, and we had the avocado roll for appetizer , was pretty good! and my friend got the factory burrito, wow was that the biggest burrito i seen lol...it looked good, and i got the steak diane, which was pleasant  and better than what i expected from a non steak house.. the meat was very tender and delicious with the mushrooms and onions that went well with it...and there was a big chunk of mashed potatoes lol..and but for my taste buds i would of preferred to have the steak without the glaze on it. regardless i was hungry and it was way better than their rubber rib eye i tried a while back lol."
Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,3.0,10/14/2010,"what's with the 'calorie counter' menu?? now i can't eat a damned thing here cuz i already kno i won't exactly be eating healthy eating at the cheesecake factory, but i don't need no 'calorie counter' menu to tell me how 'badly' i'll be eating. i mean, k'mon- i'm usually there to have cheesecake, which is probably a kazillion calories, &this is after i usually have my meal.... oy!"
Carlos M.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/9/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is very uninteresting. Their food is amazing, and I haven't gone wrong with anything I've ordered so far;  but I'd recommend the marina del Rey location for their outside patio/marina view or The Grove. I've eaten at most of their California locations  and had birthdays, new years and various celebrations at their restaurants, but the BH location is the least interesting to me."
James R.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,23,,5.0,1/17/2011,"was there with me GF last night ! great food great service ! not cheap but expensive on the other hand as well ! the portions are fairly large with is great (hate those ""gourmet "" restaurants that give you tiny portions..) , any way loved it, will go back in the future for sure."
Andrew W.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,561,8,3.0,1/10/2006,"This is definitely the smallest Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. It also happened to be the one with the worst service and maybe the worst food. I know, its a franchise but poorly run franchises fall below the corporate standard. I guess, who ever runs this thought that having expensive casual food in Beverly Hills would sell itself... but I don't think this can hold up forever."
