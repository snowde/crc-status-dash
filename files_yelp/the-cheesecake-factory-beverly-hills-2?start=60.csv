Dwight H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,5.0,7/3/2017,It's Cheesecake Factory. Why are you yelping Cheesecake Factory? You come here when you want to hate yourself and eat portions that make any American proud. 10/10 would hate myself here
J K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",51,21,29,2.0,11/5/2017,"The service was the problem but read on: The food was good. I got the truffle bacon grilled cheese and the chicken taquitos. The bacon was crisp and the truffle oil was definitely present. Yum! The taquitos were crispy and the meat was tender. The worst part of our experience was the service. Ronnie was our waiter at first. He was really nice. Then he left because he was at the end of his shift and turned us over to Brandon G. Our bill came to $51.36. We paid $60 in cash and Brandon brought back $8.50 in cash. When my friend said where's the rest of the change Brandon didn't get it. Even when we explained the numbers didn't add up all he got was agitated. He took 2 quarters from his own pocket and slammed them down on the table! He said here ya go and walked off! How disrespectful, inappropriate and unprofessional! My friends and I will never visit this location again. Just because it's Beverly Hills doesn't mean you can be rude to your customers!"
Pink B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,38,19,1.0,12/6/2016,"I came in for lunch on 12/5 Monday around 2pm. The restaurant was quite dead. I waited at the host podium for a good 15 minutes alone. No one acknowledging I was even there and waiters walking by me not saying a word.  Once our host sat us down, we asked him for a booster seat which he never brought to us. Once we sat down our waitress came to greet us. Overall experience was mediocre. We had to ask for refills of drinks and wave the waitress down as she was not coming to check on us.  Food was mediocre as well.  Also the bread they bring at the beginning was hard and felt old. I usually love that bread!  We were very bummed with the whole experience as we love to go to the cheese cake factory and wanted to try out the one in Beverly Hills during our vacation."
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,1/25/2017,Thank you Cheesecake Factory for regaining my support we had lunch at the original restaurant in Beverly Hills the service was outstanding Sean and we actually tried a new salad and it was delicious and fresh and the avocado egg rolls were to die for it just goes to show you that one bad experience shouldn't change your whole outlook
Emily H.,"Atlanta, GA",82,5,2,2.0,6/3/2017,"I normally love the Cheesecake Factory and visit the one near my home frequently. However, the Beverly Hills location was a disappointment. The avocado egg rolls were ok, but my fried chicken sandwich was over cooked and as a result the chicken was extremely dry... I didn't even eat half of it. The worst part was our waiter... he seemed completely uninterested in being there and we had to search for him every time we needed something. It was almost as though he just woke up and was still half asleep. We will not be returning to this location."
Courtney G.,"Winston-Salem, NC",238,18,,5.0,6/17/2017,This rating is solely for Trevor. I just called to place a pick up order and he was so enthusiastic and kind. Just a small phone interaction put a smile on my face!
Desmond S.,"Allen, TX",303,252,346,3.0,7/3/2015,"It was a late night drive through Hollywood and we found ourselves on Rodeo Drive.  The kids were hungry and we needed food fast before we took on our drive back to our hotel by Disney.  The plan was to stuff the kids with food so they could pass out on the hour drive back.  This is The Cheesecake Factory, so reviewing the food may be a little moot.  The food is always good at every location I've been to. When waiting at the front, what I don't like about the location is the very slim hallway you walk through to enter.  It was crowded and there was no other place to wait but here.  We blocked the hallway and had to keep moving around so the waiters could deliver food to their customers.  The wait was long, but this was not The Cheesecake Factories fault.  The front desk guy seemed a little snooty, but it was late and he could have just been tired.  I was a bit grumpy after waiting 15 minutes. Finally the front desk guy asks would we be willing to sit inside.  Turns out my wife asked for outside dining (great job babe, we could have been seated a long time ago).  Once we agreed that outside or inside would work, we were seated in minutes.  Once seated, the waitress came to our table quick.  She was very attentive and paid equal attention to my kids.  This won me over FAST. I ordered 4 cheese pasta and it was super yummy.  I always order 4 cheese pasta; it's always super yummy at every location.  My kids ordered spaghetti, they loved it.  My wife had a salad and it was so big she couldn't finish it. There was nothing that was outstanding beyond your normal Cheesecake Factory experience, it is what it is.  I like this place just as much as any location and if I find myself in the area late night, I would eat here again."
Kaii B.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,89,83,2.0,4/9/2016,"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the food was good and the hostess was nice. Honestly the service sucks. If I wanted Cheesecake Factory again I'd go to a different location. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad. We sat down, and it took our waiter around 7 minutes to come to our table to get our drink order. He didn't even introduce himself like I have no idea what his name is. He also didn't check on us that much. We had to ask other waiters when we needed something. He would pass our table and not even ask if we were doing okay. I even saw him standing around instead of checking on his customers.  I also asked him could we switch to another table because our table was awkwardly placed in between two groups. He told me to go to the front and ask. Out of all the restaurants I've been to I've never been told to go ask the front after I've been seated. I also asked him for bread, and he said the bus boy was bringing it. I'd been waiting for about 15 minutes for bread at that point. Why couldn't he just bring it to me? I got my appetizer before I got my bread.  It wasn't even just us thinking the service sucked. One of the people next to us literally had to get up and give him the check because he wouldn't come by. You could tell they were getting annoyed. The people on the other side of us were also getting frustrated because he wouldn't come by when they needed stuff.  At least the food was good. I had the factory burger. I wish the waiter would have told me that it doesn't come on a circular bun because it seemed like I got less meat, but it was tasty. My girlfriend got the bacon cheese burger, and she liked it. We also split the calamari and that was delicious. I loved the sauce that came with it."
Todd G.,"Perth, Australia",1,25,36,5.0,1/16/2017,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory? Even when the service is a little fickle, the food is still FANTASTIC! Well, this Cheesecake Factory is no exception.  We sat at the bar on this occasion as I love to watch the amazing US bar staff in action.  The barman was amazing (so good I have him a 30% cash tip).  I had the spicy cashew chicken and it was awesome washed down with one of my favourite beers Blue Moon.  The service was fast, polite and efficient. The service from the kitchen to us was so fast the plate was still sizzling.  For great food and service stop on in."
Henri V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,170,287,4.0,11/24/2016,"One of my favorites Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills and have been a regular for over 20 years. After shopping at William Sonoma and L'Occtaine, I was running on empty.  Was across the restaurant and it was close to 2pm and noticed there wasn't a waiting crowd so I crossed the street and popped in. The hostess, a tall slender elegant Nubian is always very cordial and genuinely nice. I come here infrequently, but she always remembers me and takes a moment to warmly greet, she is the best.  This restaurant is on north Beverly Drive and gets high foot traffic, full of shoppers. The restaurant is always clean and has high turnover so food is relatively fresh. The waiter and servers were all very professional and nice as well. Because of the lovely hostess, waiter and server's professionalism, attentiveness and friendliness, I've increased rating from 2 to 4 star. It's the day before thanksgiving so I'm keeping food intake light and ordered the cup or mushroom soup and the lunch portion of the skinnylicious Cesar salad with grilled chicken sans crotons. The mushroom soup was surprisingly good. Perhaps the skinnylicious option was not a good choice because despite the ample shredded cheese and added fresh black pepper, the entire salad was bland and tasteless. Will NOT order this skinnylicious option ever. The grilled chicken was freshly grilled and was nonetheless edible and should hold me till tomorrow's Thanksgiving feast and subsequent comma..."
Kate P.,"Hancock Park, Los Angeles, CA",3,51,17,4.0,11/30/2016,Exactly as you'd expect. Good food in good portions. Tables are a touch too close so go off peak.
Namuun B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,2,1.0,4/20/2017,"I can't believe this crappy fancy wanna be restaurant still exists in LA. I hate this place with all of my heart. I have been to better places. They have bad, horrible, rude and slowest service in the area. Come on!!!! Save your time and money go to somewhere with decent food and service! Everything is falling apart in this restaurant. Even if i order to go they will confuse and take 2 hours to make your food. Cashiers are super rude i hate to go in here! This place is soo overrated and sooo thousand sixteen. It's for elderly people who wants to eat fast food in bit better atmosphere. All they have is crappy burgers, shitty salads and old meats which smell like old deli supermarket."
kat s.,"North Hollywood, CA",317,22,40,1.0,4/10/2017,"Very disappointed with My order today, after waiting 20 minutes for my plate the manager came to me and said part of order won't be ready for another hour, so I changed my meal, after waiting another 20 minutes, (at this point i had to ask my server to pack it to go bc i need to get back to work) as I'm getting ready to eat my meal at my desk,  I notice the lettuce for my Thai lettuce cups are dirty!! Sooo disappointing!"
Karina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,147,194,1.0,2/23/2016,"I really hate to give one star for the restaurant but this place is an exception. I came here yesterday around 2-3. hostess was nice btw but our server was just unenthusiastic. Maybe he had a tough day. Well, idk We ordered food and I ordeted sparkling water in addition. However, he literally put glasses and bottle of pellegrino throwly. He never came back to check us literally he did nothing. Only thing he did was pack my to go. Idk if he was just rude to us but I'm sure he was rude for everyone. He says like ""absolutely"" all the time but his attitude was just like got annoyed.  Food was also just ""meh"". Garlic noodle tasted bad at this place. And my friend ordered pitch smoothie but waiter brought us strawberry smoothie. I dont wanted to bother him so we didn't complain about it.  Do not expect any tip with that services. Never coming back here. I'd rather go to grove mall."
Keith E.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2017,"I called the Beverly Hills location to place a simple take out order.  I had to call four times because the three previous times, I was placed on a 15 min hold then hung up on.  I called back the fourth time and asked the hostess if I'd be allowed to place an order this time, or will they be hanging up on me again.  Their excuse is because they were busy so they started to hang up on people.  Great customer service ethic right there.  Make me wait a total of 30 min on the phone only to hang up on me three times with no explanation.  This location should shut down and rethink their work ethics before tarnishing Cheese Factory's reputation.  Then MAYBE they should reopen.  A 1 star is being generous!"
Doreen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",834,1303,17617,3.0,2/22/2016,"I should have got the salmon.  When I was a lot younger, I really liked coming here and thought the food was good.  Yes, the cheesecakes and desserts are yum.  However, the pasta/shrimp is just okay.  I got the same dish I always get, shrimp scampi, and it's probably been about 5 years since I got that dish.  I should always get the salmon when I'm here.  This restaurant is also one of the smaller ones."
Santa M.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,115,7,5.0,2/14/2017,"Had a really great dinner here at the OG Cheesecake Factory. Great service. We were a large party and each person's food was done just right, from steak to pasta to salads! Really was a pleasant surprise. I remember when this place opened in the '70s, and now they are everywhere."
Wade R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,2,,5.0,12/27/2016,"Had a great lunch with my friend on a Tuesday afternoon!  Went on a Tuesday afternoon around 1pm. No wait, we were seated right away.  Bread basket came out fresh and hot. Everyone loves Cheesecake Factory bread!  Drinks came out cold and quick! Beer and mixed drink were both the perfect temperature! Nice and cold.  I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich! It was so good!!! Bacon was nice, thick and crispy! Turkey was flavorful. Avocado and tomato were fresh and delicious.  Our server was amazing. Very attentive, and made small talk with us. Kept coming back to our table to make sure we had everything we needed. Such a sweetheart!"
Angel S.,"Calabasas, CA",12,8,,1.0,3/25/2017,This place is not clean. They set the table with dirty utensils. The server look like he hated his job. The bread was hard and the service was crappy. This is the worst cheesecake I have ever been too! Do your self a favor and don't come. They need to get a hold of this place.
Justin N.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,By far the worst cheese cake i've been to. Not only was the survive horrible but the food was also trash. After this experience I will never go back to any cheese cake ever again.
