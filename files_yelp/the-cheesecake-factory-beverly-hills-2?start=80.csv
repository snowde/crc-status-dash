Karen F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,23,,3.0,12/8/2016,"Great fish and chips, but  really less than two ounces of wine in a glass.   Other times I've been there food is just above average.  The portions are huge Salads  are hard to screw up so they are fairly good. I had the Steak Diane and it was a tough cut of steak.  But the  cheesecake and other desserts are very good."
Eleaor K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/1/2017,This is such a great Cheesecake Factory. The staff are amazing and made sure all of our needs were taken care of from appetizer to dessert. I would recommend to anyone who wants a cost effective meal that tastes amazing.
Mary F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/20/2017,Very great food.  Waiters were very polite and on top of things. The cheesecake is to die for.  Also very clean environment.
Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211,3.0,3/19/2016,"This location is one block off of Rodeo drive near the fancy shopping.  A good place for a reasonably priced lunch if you are there just taking in the sights.  If you have the money to really shop on Rodeo Drive, though--there are probably better places!  ;) There is a close-by parking structure with the first two hours free.  Good enough for lunch and some quick sightseeing in the area. The staff was friendly at the Cheesecake Factory and the food was good -- especially the salted caramel cheesecake.  Yum."
Tiffany D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/24/2017,Worst service of my life !!! The waiter treated us like shit and complained and rolled her eyes anytime I would ask s question or help ! They also did the same to the person sitting next to me !! They ignored us half the Time and gave us very bad attitude !! I am appalled and never coming again !
Alvaro P.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",186,4,,5.0,4/11/2017,"Best place to eat in Beverly Hills. It does not have valet or even parking but, there is 3 hours free city parking across the street.  Cheaper than a trip to The Santee Alley in down town LA if you ask me."
Mike R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/22/2017,Really liked the avocado rolls. A little over priced for a chain restaurant but still good price for the area.
Judy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,203,925,4.0,1/1/2016,"This is my second time here. I usually order the chicken and shrimp pasta jambalaya but I wanted to try something different by ordering the chipotle chicken pasta. It was alright. I should have just ordered the jambalaya next time. There is metered street parking in front of Cheesecake Factory so it is convenient. The waiter was attentive, we asked for alot of complimentary bread. Delicious."
Romane A.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,7,,1.0,12/16/2016,"It was such an HORRIBLE lunch. We arrived at the restaurant at 1:30, we waited more than 40min to get the food. We asked the girl if the food would be here soon, and she was so cold and so mean in the way she was talking to us. She didn't care aboutShe came and she was like ""the food will be here soon"" and we were like ""okay"" and then she meanly said ""DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID"" We ended up leaving the restaurant. I love cheesecake factory, but it was such an bad experience. This girl ruined our day."
Jackie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",736,430,1233,5.0,10/8/2015,"I really enjoy the Cheese Cake Factory food.  Avacado egg rolls here are amazing, fabulous dipping sauce for them. For lunch the Cobb Salad is really good. Love bacon and blue cheese crumbles.   The BBQ chicken salad is delicious too! The crispy fried onions on top are the best! For dinner my favorite selection would be Factory Meatloaf! Large portion definitely enough to share. White chocolate raseberry cheesecake and the carrot cake are always amazing!"

Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",355,482,337,2.0,1/18/2016,"Can't believe I'm reviewing this place. I came here with friends, only because the cool jazz bar that we wanted to try down the street, Spaghettini & Dave Koz Lounge, was closed for a private event. Super bummer. We walked by Caffe Roma, which my friend had recommended, but it was SO LOUD and felt like a night in WeHo, when we were friends wanting to catch up and talk to each other. So we came to Cheesecake Factory, which I guess was fine for one of my picky eater friends! Saturday night, around 9:45pm, we waited 10-15 mins to be seated. Not crazy like 1-2 hr wait, but come on, on a saturday night so late?! The restaurant was packed.  Kurt was our waiter, and he was kind of snooty. He kept trying to up-sell things to us, which we hated, like adding on chicken to your salad, adding this or that, etc. And it was in a way where he had that tone of, ""Are you SURE you DON'T want to add chicken to your salad? It's really small."" I really hate when people try to do it to me, especially if they aren't nice. He always seemed like he was in a rush to do this and that, and it wasn't for our table either, it was to get back to the kitchen. When he came to the table and gave everyone's drink except mine, he said Georgia Peach was on the way. When he walked away, my friend said, didn't you get the Bellini? At this point, Kurt was halfway to the kitchen, and shouted back to us (we weren't sure if he heard us) - ""I MEANT YOUR PEACH BELLINI!!!"" It was like he heard us. Very strange.  On the other hand, we had a super nice bus boy who was very sweet. You could tell that he was very genuine and treated his customers (including us) well. Crazy story - my friend was wearing one of those skirts that zips from top to bottom in the back, and for some crazy reason, it unzipped where you could see her butt. She was leaving for the night, then felt it and sat down embarrassingly, then bus boy came over trying to make it better by saying it was alright, and offering her a napkin. It was so funny, because although he was super sweet, it just made the embarrassing situation even more noticeable. LOL. There was no moral to this story, I just wanted to share it because I thought it was hilarious, and it just shows how nice the bus boy was.  Anyway, I ordered two drinks:  Peach Blended Bellini, and the Asian Pear Martini. Both were fantastic, except there was probably no reason to card me since it tasted like there was no alcohol in them. They were $9 and $12 respectively, which came out to 21 before tax and tip, which added up to pretty expensive for just drinks, that barely gave me a buzz. I guess, what does one really expect from the Cheesecake Factory though?  I'm frustrated that I came here, but I were forced to come back because of picky eater friends, I'd probably insist at sitting at the bar, and getting my Blended Peach Bellini. That was pretty good, which is why I give it a 2 stars instead of 1!"
Hideo T.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,16,49,5.0,1/8/2017,"This is specifically for our server Nicole. She's been there for almost 9 years (I think that's what she said). She is a very good server. Friendly, professional, and has a good sense of humor. We all felt she was the best server we have encountered. Keep up the good work. People like Nicole make going out to dinner enjoyable. Thanks!"
Dan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is terrible. Service is extremely slow and the food is awful. My experience is from 2 months ago. I don't think they've improved, based on the reviews I see. Avoid!"
Laura C.,"Seattle, WA",464,205,303,1.0,7/30/2015,"I'm a very disappointed in The Cheesecake Factory this year around. I have been a loyal customer to this chain for the past 10 years, most of my visits being to the one in Chicago. Either way, I've had almost everything listed in that menu book and a majority of the cheesecake flavors as well. I always attend half off cheesecake day, stocking up on a few great flavors/slices. I clearly remember in the past being able to go to the takeout counter and order multiple slices. This time around, 1 hour before closing on the last half off day, I was told I can only order one slice per person. But first, I waited in line for about 20/25 minutes picking out cheesecakes / asking my friends over the phone which slices they wanted. It's finals week at school, some people just don't have time to make it out here to get their own slice. So being the nice friend, I took orders to bring it back to them. By the time I reached the counter, I am told only one slice per person. Now, I have 7 orders currently waiting to be fulfilled. I asked him why I couldn't get more than one slice and he kept saying 'only one'. I then go talk to the host about this issue and then a manager. After asking them why they didn't want my service / money for these seven cheesecake orders, I still got the 'one per person' speech. HOWEVER - My friend went 3 hours before me to get cheesecake to go as well. She was able to bring home multiple slices; the man at the front even asked her if she wanted any more slices to go. Walking into the restaurant, I see a man coming up with two large to-go bags filled with only cheesecake to go boxes. One man... about 10 cheesecake boxes. Things just don't add up and I am very disappointed and angry at The Cheesecake Factory. Right now, I'm not sure if I will ever be a returning customer here - as well as my family and 6 friends who wanted those slices."
Joel H.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/5/2017,I have a severe dairy allergy and I made sure I asked to not include cheese on my burger. Waited 20 mins to get food and it came with cheese and it took almost half an hour to get it replaced and it came as the wrong sandwich... again.  The service was slow and the kitchen needs to pay more attention to allergies.
Niall P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,5.0,3/24/2017,"Lads, this place is exactly as you would expect. Good food, staff, premises. If you're looking for fine dining don't go, if you're looking for good food, beautiful coffee and amazing cheesecake you should go!!"
Ievgenii P.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,52,43,5.0,8/17/2016,So I'm totally recommend this restaurant because food here is really awesome! Cheesecake it's another part of story! You have to visit The Cheesecake Factory
Sarah G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/4/2017,The food was great but our waitress completely ignored us while constantly checking on the other tables in her section. I think we only saw her when she took our order then delivered the check. She literally never checked on us and I had an empty glass for 45 minutes. I just wanted a refill...the host was very nice and welcoming and food was good as usual. But awful service.
S W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,Very slow service here. The worst I've ever seen! Go elsewhere if you want to have a good meal
