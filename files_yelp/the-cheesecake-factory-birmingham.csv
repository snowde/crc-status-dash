Lathon C.,"Atlanta, GA",58,64,169,4.0,10/5/2017,"So who new that The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) had an happy hour??  Don't answer because I'll be upset that you didn't share the information, so I'll spill the beans. There's a long list of happy hour items that are offered at a tremendous savings from their regular menu. Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 6pm; regular hours Monday-Thursday 11am to 11pm; Friday 11am to 12:30am; Saturday 10am to 12:30am; Sunday 10am to 11pm; Saturday and Sunday brunch served from 10am to 2pm.  Other than the happy hour, TCF has great regular menu items to choose from. The food is simply delicious. My favorites are The Teriyaki Chicken with broccoli and brown rice, Spicy Cashew Chicken with brown rice, Chicken Riesling, Cobb Salad (sub chicken with salmon), tired yet...? I could go on and on about the food items here. Brunch is also a great option at TCF. Btw, I sat at the bar..."
Tessa H.,"Charlotte, NC",229,6,,1.0,11/19/2017,This place is ridiculous. I have to wait 15 mins every time I call in to place a to go order. Then when I pull up and tell them I'm already here they expect me to call back and wait another 20 mins to call and remind them I'm here. I get it being the weekends but even on week days it's like this. The food is amazing of course. But geez. I really bothers me when curb side is offered and they make you walk in to get your food. I like Cheesecake Factory bc I don't have to walk in. Either this place is under staffed or just lazy  ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!
Rhea P.,"Orlando, FL",2497,2036,2171,3.0,9/16/2017,"I fail to understand what the big fuss is about. Yes, they have a diverse menu, but the food, for me has just been ok. I ordered the avocado toast and requested egg on top--it was ok. Avocado egg rolls I thought a little soggy. I came for my birthday, and unfortunately they were out of the dessert I wanted. I opted instead for strawberry shortcake instead, which was ok, but the shortcake itself was rather disappointing and tough in texture. I will say they decorated the dessert really nice for my birthday--that was sweet. Would probably not return."
Shaquita Y.,"Birmingham, AL",345,225,179,5.0,4/13/2017,"Visited during the snowstorm of 2017. Had a super friendly waitress who provided great service and a few laughs. I always seem to order the same thing, chicken and shrimp jambalaya with an extra side of sauce. This jambalaya differs because they use pasta instead of  traditional rice but it's delicious either way. The entree is about $20, bit pricey but a very large portion that always leaves me with leftovers.  -----4/13/17 Visited for a quick slice of cheesecake. Nearly $9 for one slice of cheesecake. Although it is very tasty that the cost of an entree at other places. Pleasant staff and large variety! A bit busy after 6pm during the week"
Jate J.,"San Diego, CA",310,180,664,4.0,2/10/2017,"I know..I know...it's JUST The Cheesecake Factory. Don't judge me. This review is solely on the exceptional service my friends & I always experience during happy hour. As fellow Yelpers have stated this is definitely a great place for happy hour. Great value on food. Decent cocktails & beer. Wine selection could for sure offer more options... But I won't bore you with unnecessary details. The reason we always seem to find ourselves at this chain restaurant is due to two wonderful bartenders. Cici & James.  Very attentive & usually can anticipate what you may need before you say it. They ensure that our orders are correct & definitely know how to fix a decent drink. So, I'll continue to be loyal...as long as they're around :) They deserve all of my business!"
Davida B.,"Hoover, AL",35,34,42,4.0,11/30/2017,"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots. The tex-mex egg rolls are bomb! The facility is nice, the wait staff is always kind and attentive.  Their brunch is really good. Hands down the best French toast ever. My husband likes the pot pie dish.. can't reall the name. The kale salad is really good."
Garrett I.,"Hoover, AL",196,222,510,4.0,7/11/2017,"I don't get the low scores on here.  There is a reason there is like an hour or more wait every time I come here.  I have always gotten great service and superior treatment by all of the staff on every visit I have had.  I don't come here often so I get the same thing every time I eat here.  I love the fried mac and cheese. I have had it at several other places and only one place has even come close. Every component of this dish is well done and they come together exactly as I would want it.  For my entree I get the Louisiana chicken pasta with extra sauce. Love it every time and left overs heat up to my liking too. I love dipping up that creamy sauce with bread.   My wife and I usually split a slice of cheesecake.  She likes it plain and I like it funky.  So, how do we split one?  Vanilla bean cheesecake with extra whip cream and a side of raspberry sauce. Those additions are just enough to make it dressed up for me while the simple straight up vanilla bean is just what my wife likes.  I always have a good experience here and I know I will return."
Chris W.,"Helena, AL",601,402,1608,3.0,6/21/2017,"This place has the largest most diverse menu of any restaurant I've visited. It's wildly popular and despite its immense size there is almost always a wait. The menu storage area must occupy a significant portion of their square footage. I've enjoyed most everything I've had, though nothing has been particularly special or had me racing back. This place reminds me of a better version of an Appleby's or TGI Friday's at 2x the price. Tonight my wife's sister and her family took my wife to dinner. My wife is a fan of this place, I think for the selection alone. My wife brought me fish and chips. This dinner portion is huge! The fish was thick and flaky with a tempura style beer batter. The Tatar sauce was good with a hint of lemon. The chips were soggy bag variety fries.  She subbed the slaw  for crisp sautéed green beans. They were ok.... I personally prefer my green beans cooked for a day with pork fat. The fish and tarter sauce now stand out; however,  what really stands out the most is the nutritional information for this menu item. Ever exceeded all of your caloric intake in a day with one meal?  The Cheesecake Factory's Beer Battered Fish and Chips: 2,260 calories as well as 68 grams of saturated fat and 2,870 milligrams of sodium.  That's what 125% of your daily recommended sodium intake?? In the future I will google  nutritional information prior to ordering. Upon further further inspection a number of the menu items at this restaurant are widely recognized for their poor nutritional value.  Order carefully."
Anna N.,"Rainsville, AL",0,35,53,5.0,11/16/2017,"Amazing meal. Fried zucchini is the best appiterzer ever.  I could make a meal off that.  The brown bread they bring out is wonderful. I just went with a sandwich and it was good, but the mahi mahi is my favorite. Got to have cheesecake if you go, not a fan of cheesecake, but i love it."
Angelia B.,"Birmingham, AL",7,19,146,4.0,6/10/2017,"Had a late dinner with my husband tonight. Our waiter Paul was the best waiter that I have ever had there. Austin thinks that he is the best waiter here but he can't hold a candle to Paul. I had the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane Sautéed Shrimp with Whole Cloves of Garlic, White Wine, Fresh Basil and Tomato and Medallions of Certified Angus Beef Steak Covered with Black Peppercorns and a Rich Mushroom Wine Sauce served with Mashed Potatoes (a little cold).  My shrimp was not cook properly, therefore, Paul informed the manager and she got it taken care.  My husband had the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken which is a Half Chicken Served with Mashed Potatoes, Carrots and Watercress. Topped with a Light Lemon Garlic-Herb Sauce.  Upon the next visit we will request to be seated wherever Paul is serving. He checked on us often and was very pleasant. He reminded me of how the servants were in Downton Abbey he was some how always there but, never in the way. When we received our bill we were surprised that the manager gave a complimentary strawberry cheesecake."
Simon M.,"Birmingham, AL",34,201,115,4.0,5/3/2017,My finance and I came to indulge in some desert after a lovely dinner at a nearby establishment. We arrived quite late but the cheese cake factory was still popping. We took a seat at the bar and were immediately greeted and provided a menu as request for some desert. Holey moley there are a lot of delicious options to choose from. My weakness for Carmel won and we ended up with a Carmel deluxe number. It was delicious just don't look at the calorie count and enjoy the gluttony.  The only disappointing thing was the lack of alcoholic desert drinks. The only option was add liquor to coffee which was alright but I would have thought there was something more.  Overall great place to satisfy that sweet tooth.  Till next time
Charnetta M.,"Huntsville, AL",189,177,1326,4.0,10/10/2016,"Met my mother here for dinner today.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We started off with the Eggroll Sampler for our appetizer. The sampler comes with halves of Cuban egg roll (my favorite), Tex Mex egg roll, Avocado egg roll and Firecracker Salmon egg roll. Each roll is served with an accompanying sauce.   My mom ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and I ordered the Tuscan Chicken (located in the Skinnylicious menu). I tried to lessen the caloric damage between the fried eggrolls and the highly anticipated cheesecake. Lol. The gumbo was amazing! I like that you can choose between white and brown rice. The dish had a great taste to it and the pieces of sausage gave it the perfect kick.  The Tuscan Chicken has a variety of flavors. Very light tasting and easy on the calories. The chicken was a tad bit tough. My only major gripe about this dish is the balsamic vinaigrette is very pungent and overpowers the dish. I only tasted the balsamic in the tomatoes, which came in abundance, so I don't know if they are marinated in the vinaigrette prior or what but I'm pretty sure my mouth puckered with every bite. Other than that the dish served its Mediterranean purpose (fresh basil, capers, farro, artichokes and etc) and it is definitely a fulfilling meal considering it's less than 600 calories.  Overall, we had a nice, pleasant dining experience. Our server's name was John and he was awesome!"
Whitney D.,"Emerald Ridge Apartments, AL",116,110,328,4.0,9/10/2016,Four stars. Our waitress was great but the pasta was a little al dente for my taste. I ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken. We also had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (really good!) with chicken as well. My favorite app is the Buffalo Blast! It's fried Buffalo chicken dip . It's like it can straight from heaven and wham you are hooked!  They have a huuuuggggeee menu! The great thing about this place is they have food for everyone.  Cheesecake....  cheesecake... all the cheesecake.. glorious and you can just skip the food and head straight for dessert. My favorite is the peanut butter or the red velvet.  They also have divine chocolate cheesecake options. Just go ahead and order a coffee with some baileys and relax in cheesecake heaven
Ashlea N.,"Charlotte, NC",91,3,12,1.0,3/16/2017,I had never been to the cheesecake factory before. The restrooms were DISGUSTING! My coworker and I went for dinner at 5:30 . We didn't leave until 8:30 because the service was so slow. Our server didn't even greet us for a solid 10 mins after being sat. He forgot silverware multiple times. When I ordered a steak he didn't bring a knife and they dropped my food off and it took another 5 mins to bring my coworkers chicken mediera. When he got it was cold and had been sitting... just sad service! The only good thing was the cheesecake...
Frank R.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,16,42,5.0,4/16/2017,"Every time I come to Birmingham, I always get tot he Cheesecake Factory.  The service and food are always on point. I've never had to wait long and even this weekend with a huge softball tournament going on they are seating people quickly.  Dinner or dessert only it's always a great place and fantastic food.  You gotta try it if you haven't !"
Frank H.,"Alabaster, AL",54,99,252,4.0,7/31/2016,I decided to take my family out for dinner and this is where they wanted to go. Our wait wasn't long. We arrived around 2pm and enjoyed the outside sitting area. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to all 9 of us at the table. We started with the chicken dumplings and they were crispy on the outside and tender and full of flavor on the inside. The Asian sauce that paired with them put them over the top. We had a lot of different entres but the chicken madeira was the choice of half of our table. I tasted it and it was delicious. I ordered the shrimp scampi and added a little alfredo sauce and it was the best dish on the table. It paired very well with the wine sauce.  Of course we all had various pieces of cheesecake for the finishing dish. We were all pleased and will be back.
Rikesha F.,"Birmingham, AL",175,216,1354,4.0,7/9/2016,"The ambience alone will keep me coming back. Its always quite a treat to eat here, even if it's just for drinks or dessert. Depending on what you order here, you can rack up quite a bill, so plan accordingly. I've tried quite a few dishes here over the years. From the Romano crusted chicken, to the Four Cheese Pasta , to an appetizer called Buffalo Blasts, I've never had a bad meal. Not spectacular either, but always good. Portion sizes often lead to to-go boxes. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and are ready to recommend a dish, appetizer or dessert at your request. The bar staff really know how to mix a great drink, especially for a not-so-frequent drinker like myself.  If you've never been here, you should go. Treat yourself every once in awhile. You deserve it!"
Tonya G.,"Wiggins, MS",3,80,108,4.0,3/17/2017,"Food was good, but the wait time was ridiculously long.  It even took forever to get refills on water while we waited on our food.  Manager did come over and apologize.   The cheesecake was the best part of the trip....worth the wait."
Brandice P.,"Birmingham, AL",206,24,46,5.0,8/14/2017,"This is my go to place when I'm indecisive about what to eat, but still want good food and/or dessert. Very diverse and delicious menu with even better dessert! Very nice staff and wonderful atmosphere. LOVE!!!!"
Corey J.,"Scottsboro, AL",310,3,,5.0,9/1/2017,"My boyfriend and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday dinner. Our waitress was Jimmiesha. She was a very helpful waitress and gave us some really good recommendations. The only setbacks during our experience there was that there was our waitress got busy at one point and had forgotten to put in our order for the entrées. She came to our table to apologize and offered us complementary soups while we waited for food. I thought that was really nice of her. Later on, Jimmiesha was kind enough to get us some to-go bowls for our leftovers and, I assume either because of the late order because it was my birthday and she was aware, she only charged us for the drinks and the appetizers. I guess it was her birthday present to me, or a present to make up for the wait.  We ended up tipping $30 on a $12 order that should have been around $50. Jimmiesha was extremely nice and I will happily go back to the Cheesecake Factory if I'm seated at one of her tables."
Christopher M.,"North Avondale, Birmingham, AL",71,14,48,4.0,7/30/2017,"Since they don't always take reservations, you may have to prepare for a wait that could last up to an hour. The food is flavorful, savory, and most importantly- delicious! I honestly felt that the quality (and quantity) of food lived up to the price paid. On the down side, they're tremendously busy, so you may be there waiting for awhile. So far, all the entrees Ive had lived up to the expectations I have set for this establishment. The cheesecake is absolutely phenomenal! Wish I snapped a picture... The environment is also very relaxing and sets a warm ambiance. They'll definitely be seeing more of me, even if it's just to pick up a slice of cheesecake!"
Clyde B.,"Birmingham, AL",0,17,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"Flies, Bugs, and Insects! They left dirty tables sitting around our table for 30-45 minutes.  There were flies and insects everywhere, evidently attracted to the food on the empty tables.  We spoke with Jennifer, who told us a manager would come by and hear our concerns, but no one ever came by.   Their health dept rating notes problems with failing to ""maintain potentially hazardous food at 41 F or below."""
Ashley R.,"Little Rock, AR",12,26,31,5.0,7/19/2017,"My husband I came here for our anniversary lunch yesterday. Our state doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory anywhere so we always go when we are on vacation somewhere. I usually order the same thing since we don't get to go often (can never go wrong with Oreo cheesecake). As always, the food was great and our server was fantastic as well. Will definitely be back at some point."
Brad C.,"Saint Charles, MO",9,35,22,5.0,7/28/2017,Our church staff was in town for a conference and we wanted to go somewhere nice for our last meal before heading home. A couple of people suggested the cheesecake factory and that sounded good. I had not been to the cheesecake factory in several years so I had really forgotten about the extensive menu. When I called it was going to be an hour and a half wait for our group of eight so we split into two groups of four and was seated within 15 to 20 minutes. The restaurant was packed but still looked very clean. Everyone that we dealt with was very nice and extremely polite. Our waitress was Anna and she was really amazing. On the way to our table a waiter was walking by with two or three dishes that he was about to serve. One of those dishes caught my eye and I said that looks great I wonder what it is? He took the time to turn around and tell me the name of the dish and that's exactly what I ordered. It was Chicken Parmesan Romano with pasta and a light sauce and it was delicious. It was a great evening with some wonderful friends and the restaurant did an excellent job.
Courtney O.,"Birmingham, AL",112,40,17,5.0,8/1/2017,"Visited on a very busy Sunday,  even with the long wait it was totally worth it.  The food was good as always and very filling. The desert was even better. I had the calamari for appetizer, as it never seems to disappoint,  the four cheese pasta with Chicken, a sweet tea that was sweet, but not so filled with sugar that I would end up with diabetes.....I topped it all off with the new Celebration Cheesecake and it was ever so delious and appealing to my ever changing taste buds. The visit was very much a success with good food and even better service. No complaints here,  5 stars!"
Mariah C.,"Birmingham, AL",91,114,88,3.0,8/12/2016,"On the day before school starts, I always take my daughters out to lunch and to an afternoon movie.  Yesterday, no one could agree where to eat and I chose the Cheesecake Factory because there was something for everyone.  I had avocado toast (from the ""Superfood"" menu) and the Samosas from the ""Small Plate"" menu.  The trick, I think, with avocados is to be generous with seasonings, as they have such a mild flavor.  Sadly, CF didn't really focus on seasoning, or texture.  The plate looked beautiful, with cherry tomatoes cut in half over the green mashed avocado, and artfully-placed radishes sprinkled over the concoction.  The toast underneath, however, was too thick and tough for an easy bite and the load of avocado mash on top tumbled off with each bite.  The Samosas were pretty nondescript - small and quite oily, with a strong curry powder flavor. Two of my daughters got burgers which were delicious - and fries that were the best.  We took home one entire burger.  My other daughter got the cup of homemade mushroom soup and the da Vinci pasta, both of which were good, if perhaps a bit over-salted. The tab came to almost $75, and with tip was $90.  Quite an expensive for a very average experience."
Carolyn B.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,6,3,1.0,9/4/2017,"I was so looking forward to a nice lunch. Unfortunately, that never came to fruition. (I reluctantly agreed to eat here because last spring they turned our party of 8 away at 3:30 on a weekday. The restaurant was empty. ???)  Good things: server was nice and the fried mac and cheese was just how our daughter likes it.  Not-so-good: fries were undercooked; they sent more that were a bit better, but they still had that raw potato flavor. The strawberry lemonade was thick; like it came from the bottom of the container. At least they took it off our bill.  Total grossness: We killed 4 flies while we were there. In addition, gnats swarmed our food the entire meal. We brought it to the attention of the person who brought our food and his response was, ""Well, it's summertime."" After our meal we asked to speak to the manager. Jennifer came to our table and was of the same opinion. ""We have so many doors and it's hard to keep them out."" We pointed out that it may be a bit easier if tables were bussed and cleaned in a timely manner. 4 tables sat dirty for at least 20 minutes after the customers left. Her response was that they had a large party in another part of the restaurant. She also said she would send over the general manager, but that never happened.  We hoped for a nice meal. Instead we had sub-par food, flies/gnats, and an atmosphere of dirty tables. I expect more when paying $70 for lunch for 3 people. It's a shame. TCF used to be one of our favorite places."
Kimberly F.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,11,36,4.0,6/26/2017,Dinner at my favorite restaurant with my mom  and husband was great.we chose to sit on the patio because the weather was in my opinion perfect.the atmosphere on the patio was very nice and as always the food was sooooo delicious! I can't wait till my next visit.
Susie L.,"Alexandria, VA",88,160,550,4.0,1/16/2016,"I think this is the smallest Cheesecake Factory that I've been to.  Such being the case, this place is packed to the brim (at least on Saturdays), so beware and plan accordingly.  No reservations.  Happy hour is M-F 4-6. $5 for a good variety of favorite appetizers (they're the full size), and $5 for draft? And a good price for specific mixed drinks too.  Bathrooms are clean!  Food comes out quickly.  They offer complimentary valet for patrons, so you don't go driving in that huge lots for 20 mins!"
Benjamin Y.,"Birmingham, AL",60,85,159,3.0,1/6/2017,"I love cheesecake factory but this isn't the best one. The services are so slow every time I visit here.  I get that hosts can be annoyed by so many people coming up to them, but please don't be rude to people who are being polite. I used to go to the one in DC all the time and loved it every time. I took my friends who are visiting me here and they told me that not all southerners practice southern hospitality after coming here.  The portions are huge so we all took half the food back home. The breads are good as well. Lastly, I don't eat dairy so every time their servers give me a weird look for not ordering a slice of cheesecake, it is painful."
Jennifer M.,"Millbrook, AL",1,1,,5.0,7/30/2017,One of our favorite places to eat. There is such variety in food choices and dessert is ALWAYS on point! We even came to eat here after getting engaged! Special place for us!
Candace C.,"Birmingham, AL",0,4,2,5.0,4/23/2017,"Went for a late lunch on a Saturday. It was pretty busy but we were seated within five minutes. Our server Luis was amazing. Our food came fairly quickly, and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious! We were stuffed after dinner so everyone got a slice of cheesecake to go, which was very tasty later that night. My first trip to the Cheesecake Factory and I will definitely be back!"
Katie T.,"Longwood, FL",113,216,268,4.0,12/5/2016,"I went to Cheesecake Factory a couple weeks ago and it was a very good experience overall!  We waited a long time to get in, but it was Friday night and we had a large party, so that was to be expected.  Our waitress was phenomenal; I'm pretty sure she had a photographic memory and she didn't write down any of our party of 10's orders, which made us a bit skeptical because some of us had specifications, but she didn't miss anything.  I got the California Guacamole Salad, which had avocado, corn, black beans, radishes, and avocado dressing.  It was a huge salad and was very good, I'd go back to get it in a heartbeat.  The Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake was absolutely to die for, it was so decadent for a non-chocolate containing dessert.  Overall, the whole experience was wonderful!"
Vickie B.,"Birmingham, AL",17,6,2,3.0,10/30/2017,The food is really lacking in flavor... I get the same thing every time.. I will stick with cheese cake only..
Tamiko L.,"Gardendale, AL",29,47,124,3.0,1/28/2017,"Although I am not a major fan of their food, the drinks and desserts are phenomenal.  There is such a huge selection of cheesecake that you can go into overload but it's SOOO worth it!"
Hannah C.,"Birmingham, AL",103,1,,2.0,8/13/2017,"It was alright. I've been here a few times and the service is okay, but never outstanding. I went earlier today and we were seated by a window, which wasn't a problem. The problem was the amount of flies that were in the restaurant by our table (we were inside, not on the patio). I had to kill 4 flies, only to find another 6 before we even received our check. I understand that we were seated by a window, but 10 flies... That's unusual. We asked our waitress, Ashley, if she could just casually mention to the manager that there was a fly problem. Idk if she ever did, but I hope that management sees this so they could maybe do something about that. I felt like I was having to make sure that no flies got in my food the entire time that I was there."
Mia B.,"Montgomery, AL",120,7,,2.0,6/10/2017,"I was very excited to grab some pasta with my boyfriend on a Friday afternoon. Unfortunately the food was not appetizing at all. I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and my boyfriend had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken. Both dishes lacked seasoning and flavor, and the chicken tasted boiled. I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I will not be eating their pasta anymore."
S R.,"Dublin, OH",0,14,21,5.0,5/22/2017,The pasta carbonara is always a good choice. Love the fried calamari appetizer. This location is crazy busy during the weekend but the staff si friendly and things move pretty fast. Really nice outdoor seating available.
Jen D.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,,1.0,9/27/2017,Ordered take out pasta and they somehow forgot to put the sauce on my pasta. It wasn't edible. Complete was of money.
Larry C.,"Demopolis, AL",39,33,50,5.0,10/30/2016,Great lunch celebration for daughter's birthday. Loved the Brunch. Mexican eggs with all the fixing. Good cheesecake.
