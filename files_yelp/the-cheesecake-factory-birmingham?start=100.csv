Aubrey A.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,29,10,4.0,4/12/2015,The food is great and the cheesecake is amazing. The place is always crowded but that's how you know it's the real deal!
Leanne B.,"Irvine, CA",167,73,125,2.0,11/11/2013,"Service and quality are really what makes a difference when you eat at a chain restaurant. I've been to several cheesecake factory locations in california as well as in Texas. This place however was the first ive ever run into that was DIRTY!  Went to lunch there today. There was no wait for the patio so coworker and I decided to sit outside. It was nice out today! Sat down, got some bread (which weren't warm as they usually are, the sourdough usually looses its warmth quick but neither roll was warm) opened the napkin roll to get a knife, only to find out my napkin had been used and the silverware was rolled with crumbs. Odd?! Now my coworkers napkin was clean but it had crumbs in it as well... Oh well Maybxe it fell in the basket of bread along with some shrimp tail and sauce on my napkin....gross! While waiting for our food i saw that the table next to us was being prepped the guy was arranging the little plates...then i noticed (through the window and glare! might i add) that one of the plates was obviously dirty...they guy ignored it and placed the napkin over it logistically so you wont notice any of that gunk!. I wasnt tripping that SHHHT WAS DIRTY. Like i just had a salad with some tomatoes and green onions dirty! It wasn't just a speck. I cant believe he just ignored it like it wasnt there, like no one would notice. Seriously?! You're that lazy? To add they forgot the onion strings on my salad :( why? it's like the best part. Crunchy unhealthy fried onions mmmmm :) so the expediter wasnt any help which their case.  I asked for the manager and told him about the nasty napkin and the nasty plate that was on the booth inside next to us...By then a lovely family had sat down on that booth but the lady wasnt having any bread lol so she hasn't seen the NASTY plate. The manager swiftly went to the table and grabbed all the plates from that table. Good job! Other than that i really dont know if he talked to his employee... He told me that the prep their utensils outside of their kitchen area. I told him maybe they should pick a more sanitary place to work and roll those napkins. Oh and if you wanted to know the manager did comp our food, not that we cared for him to do that. We were on a company lunch and i really just wanted him to tell his lazy employee to pick up his act and not make their team look bad."
Sean M.,"PT WASHINGTON, FL",1,15,2,2.0,7/16/2013,"You've heard the phrase ""eat local."" This is the opposite. I think people dine here because they are impressed by the decor. The interior is spacious, even lavish.  It should be great, right? Service is attentive & pleasant. No issues there. There's only one problem: the food pretty much sucks. I daresay that if you served this food in a 'hole in the wall' type of location, it would be out of business in a month. Most of this stuff seems to have originated in a can, mix, or freezer. It can either be bland, too sweet, or too spicy. The 'green salad' consists of a bowl of lettuce doused in lousy bland dressing. The 'chicken mushroom lettuce wraps' are grossly overseasoned. It's not cheap, either. I don't mind paying for good food.  This is not good food. Cheesecake Factory was probably good when it started, many years ago. Then it became more of a ""factory"" (hey, at least they are honest). It's an example of a chain restaurant that has embraced mediocrity and style over substance. There may be some desirable items on the menu, but I've had no luck finding them. I really don't understand dining here when there are so many better options in Birmingham. Heck, there are at least a half dozen better options within a mile. Waiting any length of time to dine here is just plain sad. I am being generous in giving this place two stars."
Randy B.,"Chelsea, AL",1,39,3,1.0,5/1/2016,"Arrived at this location last evening at 5:00 with a party of 10 to celebrate 2 birthdays. We were given a beeper and told it would be 6 hours! 6 hours!!! Instead of being courteous enough to at least tell us that they were too full to serve us, we were given this ridiculous wait time! Very very poor customer relations!!!! We won't be back!! The food isn't good enough to wait an hour and certainly not 6 hours!"
Tad N.,"Hoover, AL",94,405,242,2.0,1/30/2016,"I have held off writing this review for a long time.  I have eaten here on several occasions and I can't figure out why.  The service is OK.  The people seem friendly but over worked.  Long time to get refills and such.  The atmosphere is super cool.  Pretty dark but enough light to get it done.  The menu is monstrous.  Maybe that's the problem.  They make so many things they don't have time to get great at anything.  I've had club sandwiches, steak burgers, fish and it is all just so so.  When the bill comes I honestly ask myself every time why do we keep coming back.  It isn't terrible but for the price I should be blown away.  Also it is extremely loud inside.  Always.  If this place lowered the prices it would be worth more stars but at what they charge it isn't worth it.  We only go to they take out line to order cheesecake to go now and that is just fine.  The cheesecake is amazing."
Piper P.,"Nashville, TN",29,50,8,4.0,1/25/2015,We went at an odd time and were seated rather quickly.  Our waiter was preoccupied with something because he simply took forever. The food was good. Had chopped salad and of course cheesecake.  Very yummy.  Waiter ... less than desirable.  I am sure we will go back but wasn't the best of times.
Yael S.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,145,43,3.0,2/14/2015,"I came here with a party of 6 on a weekend, and we had to wait eons. I guess everyone in Birmingham loves Cheesecake Factory (everyone with a pulse loves Cheesecake Factory) but we were so long in waiting to be seated I was sure I'd starve. maybe that's just the nature of a small city like Birmingham--having crowds like in like that. wouldn't know. I'm a New Yorker."
Erica L.,"Birmingham, AL",106,6,,5.0,6/21/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurants! No matter what you're in the mood for, they are bound to have it! The portion size means at least three meals for me and the cheesecake is to die for!"
Max F.,"Birmingham, AL",40,319,230,4.0,10/28/2013,"First time ever. I always wondered how it was inside these dark-ish huge buildings supposed to sell huge cheesecakes. They serve also regular food and not only cheesecakes?? O wow! Greatly surprised by the quality of the service even in pick chaotic hours. I actually got a cheesecake and I really liked it. I mean, it wasn't as the last cheesecake I had in NYC, but it was definitively not too sugary and well made. Cocktails actually had some alcohol in the present ingredients!  Nice deal. Good place, I'll go back for further investigaitons"
Don K.,"Luxemburg, WI",11,6,,4.0,5/3/2015,"Beautiful place, but I knew I knew as soon as I saw the 26 page menu book, that this was a place that didn't specialize in anything and would be lucky to be mediocre at some things. Wow, was I wrong. I was there with 6 people, we had appetizers, entrees, drinks, and desserts, and shared. Everything was excellent. Foods that I do not like were good here. I had the Bang Bang Thai chicken and shrimp. It was awesome!"
Jana W.,"Charlotte, NC",78,9,7,1.0,7/31/2015,"As much as I wanted to love my $20 plate of pasta, this was one of the worst meals.  I placed my to go order (I always order this dish to go so I know what it is supposed to taste like even when made to go) and waited for over 45 minutes during what was a slow time for a restaurant (2:30pm).  When I got my food, I luckily opened it up to see that my Cajun pasta was all Cajun but no pasta.  I reluctantly went back in and asked for some extra pasta (after all, I did pay $20 for it and that's a splurge for me).  I wish I had eaten it there so I could have sent it back all together.  The chicken was very soggy and not cooked well and the usual shrimp that used to come with the pasta had been replaced with small popcorn shrimp that tasted as if it had been frozen.  Over all, I don't think I will be eating here again.  Or if I do decide to give them another chance, I'll sample my food BEFORE I leave to make sure it's edible."
Zachnashleigh C.,"Birmingham, AL",6,3,,5.0,5/30/2015,"Every time I carry my wife here the service, food,and experience is amazing awesome food great price for the quality and portion size and the lemon raspberry cheesecake is amazing so is the turtle and the godiva . But my favorite is the red velvet cheesecake and bourbon glazed chicken"
Anthony W.,"Augusta, GA",0,16,14,3.0,4/6/2015,I had the chicken sandwich and my wife had the cheese steak.. Both were bland but well cooked. If you have never experienced eating here it's worth the trip. Now the cheesecake is 5 stars hands down so to us this would be a great place for coffee and cake.
Melody H.,"Birmingham, AL",21,131,9,4.0,3/27/2013,"A coworker and I tried again during lunch on a weekday.  We both had the pasta - I had the spicy chipotle chicken and she had the Louisiana chicken pasta.  Both of us REALLY enjoyed it.  I don't really care for the bread that they serve.  I don't like the brown bread and the white bread is usually tasteless. The service was fast and pretty good.  No complaints there. It is pricey though, even at lunch.  Just the pasta with water was $12 - and that's not including the tip. My experience with lunch was a lot better than with dinner.  Note that we did get there before noon, so that might be part of the reason why the service was quick.  I'm not sure how it is during the real rush."
Reviewer P.,"Birmingham, AL",38,114,1,4.0,10/13/2015,"This place has great Cheesecake, but the food was average. Service was great, the waitress went above and beyond in customer service. The Fettuccine Alfredo was average, nothing spectacular about it, and the veggie burger did not taste the best. This is in regards to the price that we paid for the food, but it was still good food. I had the Chocolate cheesecake, and it was excellent."
Leeann W.,"Birmingham, AL",0,14,2,5.0,3/6/2016,"We've always had good service and if there is a problem with the order, it is handled quickly and efficiently. Wait times can be long, but are better than other locations."
Jeremy B.,"Atlanta, GA",151,334,1179,3.0,12/21/2013,"I've enjoyed the cheesecake factory since I first discovered them in San Antonio! The food is good, but nothing signature! Typical American food, but the cheesecakes are to die for! I love so many of the selections they offer. The slices are humongous & I only go for the cheesecake!"
Meredith D.,"Birmingham, AL",14,61,,4.0,9/23/2013,"I enjoy a gluttonous 10,000 calorie meal as much as the next person, and even though the food is good, I'm not sure I ""get"" this place. With a menu that rivals an encyclopedia, you can essentially have whatever your heart desires at Cheesecake. Mexican? Sure. Italian? Ok. So with a menu this large and no real ""specialty"", guarantee a good, but not stellar, dish. I've gotten pasta from this location a handful of times and its good, but its nothing special. Their cheesecake, however, is divine. I reccommend the Godiva. So yeah, the food is good. Never had an issue with service. I just can't understand why it is so ridiculously busy. On any given night you can expect a wait, especially weekends. Why?! What is offered here that is so outstanding that makes men women and children want to sit outside for 2 hours to get served some pasta that was made in the microwave (Let's be real about how these sorts of chains operate)? With an array of local dining in Birmingham that I am discovering, I can't understand the long waits at Cheesecake. It's not worth 2 hours, sorry."
Jacob W.,"Birmingham, AL",50,187,193,4.0,11/3/2013,"Great selection, I've had everything from Vietnamese Tacos to a Kobe burger, and have always enjoyed everything I ordered.  Long lines and waits, so it's best to come before or after the dinner rush. I especially love the low calorie menu options, for they're unique and actually worth eating, unlike most low calorie items at other restaurants. I come here often, and have never had a bad experience."
Michael P.,"Birmingham, AL",42,22,102,4.0,12/22/2013,"Love the Banana Creme Cheesecake, but my favorite is the Red Velvet. Always wondered why some slices are smaller than others???"
