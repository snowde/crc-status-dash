Jennifer P.,"Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, GA",20,74,36,5.0,12/5/2015,"Me and my bestie came here yesterday for dinner. It was so packed!! We opted for any seat in the house because we were starving. We didn't care whether it be inside or outside in the heated patio. The wait was only 15 mins and we ended up with the ""heated patios"". Let me tell ya it was like 48 degrees and not enough fire torches. I was freezing my fingers off. Bestie had a sangria and not even that could keep her warm. Other than that. The service was kind of slow. There was a lot of lag time from us getting the menu to getting the orders in. But our server did do a good job serving us though. He kept my sweet tea cup always full. I had Evelyn's pasta. My fav always. The olives weren't cut to bits here. That's a good thing. I just flicked them to the side more easily. However I don't like that big fat pasta cylinders. The flavor just doesn't incorporate well with the light sauce drizzle. That's just my opinion. I miss the old squiggly pasta they had. Overall dinner here was great. 'Twas a great night in Birmingham!"
J B.,"Owings Mills, MD",8,95,22,3.0,8/24/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a big company so it's hard for them to focus on the quality of that vast Atlas Shrugged sized menu, however some of their new stuff is BOMB! The small plates menu is my favorite, I really enjoy the goat cheese and beat salad and the ahi tartar. It has become obvious to me that when it comes to eating there, if you want cheesecake then it's probably best to stick to a few of the tapa's and get the dessert."
Wendy C.,"Knoxville, TN",25,89,44,4.0,9/7/2013,Good food.  Great staff.  Great service.  The patio is nice on a cool afternoon.
Meg T.,"Elkmont, AL",1,4,3,5.0,1/13/2015,"No complaints! Excellent service. Excellent food. Best of all the cheesecake!  Many meal choices and amazing cheesecake choices. The only complaint that I could have is the odd seating in some areas, but the food erases that issue. Yummy! Definitely a good choice."
Michael B.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",1,19,,5.0,8/9/2015,"We love the Cheesecake factory. Sure, it's a chain, but the food is great and the restaurant operation is very well organized. You don't have to wait long for the food, even when the place is packed."
Tonja F.,"Marietta, GA",61,233,335,4.0,7/6/2013,"Saturday night and wait was short, food was great (ordered jambalaya chicken pasta, steak Diane w shrimp scampi and the tuna rapacious for an appetizer). Waitress lacked a bit in attending to our needs (waiting for silverware, got my pasta choice wrong, didn't check on us much) but was otherwise very friendly.  They give you so much food two could probably share one entree. Always loved the Cheesecake Factory ad this location didn't disappoint. Great way to end our time in the Birmingham area."
Danielle S.,"Birmingham, AL",57,38,169,3.0,6/24/2013,"The size of this menu is ridiculous.  I felt like I was handed a book to read.  I can't imagine much is freshly prepared when a kitchen has to be prepared to quickly send out any one of the hundreds of choices they offer.   We ordered the calamari to share and it was very good.  It was lightly battered and not chewy.  It's served with a spicy cocktail and a mayonnaisey tartar sauce. I got the greek salad and turkey avocado sandwich.  The salad was ok.  A little bit of arugula topped with a lot of tomatoes and thick cut cucumbers, kalamata olives and some feta cheese.  The sandwich was loaded with turkey meat, but it was incredibly dry and tasteless.  The bacon that was on it was old and rubbery. The dessert menu is as extensive as the dinner menu.  We went with the simple cheesecake with strawberries.  It was delicious.  The slices are huge, so we shared this as well. Overall, the place is clean and our server was very attentive.  Since I wasn't anticipating much from such a huge chain restaurant, I guess you can say that they met my expectations."
Ashley M.,"Birmingham, AL",114,367,563,2.0,4/21/2012,"We ate here for Valentine's day one year. The food was just ok and way overpriced which is why they only get two stars in my book. My husband got the steak Diane, and because of how much he disliked it anytime he sees that on a menu or on T.V. he replies with ""ugghh"". Now the cheesecake, this coming from a person who has never really liked cheesecake, was really good! The slices are huge and they have great flavor choices. I remember the Snickers being my favorite."
Rachael W.,"Leeds, AL",0,3,,1.0,11/11/2013,"Ate here the other night with a group of 12,  waited 30 mins to get drinks, (i ordered sweet tea), then  45 mins after we order, food partly came, with confusion at the table, (due to another server bringing out the food and us starving to death) a plate went to the wrong person, leaving one person with no food... no attempt to fix the error no apologizes from the server no apologizes from the manger, who even said it was our fault  my friend was offered free cheesecake for the trouble, but when the server asked the rest of the table if they wanted dessert, whom all said no, did not get his cheesecake and the food is not worth the price"
Sarah C.,"Vestavia Hills, AL",0,2,,4.0,6/4/2014,"At first the menu and idea of it being a chain restaurant was overwhelming but since I found my favorite dish, the Chicken Bellagio, I haven't looked back.  Make sure to ask for a to go box cause you won't be able to finish it!"
Kiersten A.,"Spring Hill, TN",2,14,6,3.0,8/9/2014,"Got here for lunch at 11 am. If you come much later, you usually have To wait a long time. There were two of us and we were sat in the middle and the table next to us was so close I could smell the perfume on the lady next to me and hear everything they said. It was disappointing they crammed so many two top tables so close. It Made for an uncomfortable lunch. You can get a high top table at the bar and it's more private. I think those are first come, first serve. The food was mediocre. The menu extensive and a bit  overkill. Not good for those indecisive minds like myself. They do have a skinny menu for those watching calories."
Will B.,"Birmingham, AL",57,61,127,4.0,8/8/2012,"Was on my way back from the Leeds outlet and remember Birmingham does have a Cheesecake Factory. Stopped in and went right to the bar. I always get great service whether alone or with someone sitting there. Bartender was very accommodating and helped with drink menu and some bread. Always love the flavored tea at CF and the Mango was excellent. Decided to get the clubhouse salad, and was surprised how big and good it was. Lots of toppings and the right amount of dressing, not tooo much. :) The thing was big, lots of food, but I managed to eat the whole thing. LOL.  I could not come to the CF without getting a piece of cheesecake, took me longer to decide which kind cheesecake than my dinner salad. LOL. Decided on the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and boy was it good. I had pretty much a food coma after. But it was worth it!"
T S.,"Leeds, AL",3,3,,5.0,8/17/2014,I had my first dinner at Cheesecake Factory the other night. It was the best meal I have had in a long time!  Will definitely be back!
Phadra B.,"Birmingham, AL",0,4,,4.0,9/22/2014,Had dinner here this evening...Cheesecake Factory may not be five star but they deserve at least 4..I ordered the chicken and biscuits which I was skeptical about but it was delicious..server was great..birthday song was sweet! They gave a mini ice cream sundae. Great experience
J M.,"Birmingham, AL",13,114,4,4.0,5/19/2014,"As good as any other Cheesecake Factory. Good food, service, and prices aren't too crazy."
Matt D.,"Marshall, MI",137,6,34,3.0,4/4/2014,"Got take out to bring back to hotel. Had horrendous, rude, patronizing service from woman at dessert/take out bar.  I'll spare the details, suffice it to say, I would never recommend or go to this location again.  Food was good however.  Excellent salads and dressings. Had Boston salad and wife the Chopped Salad.  Shrimp Scampi good.  Banana Cream Cheesecake was outstanding."
D'Andra V.,"Birmingham, AL",61,2,2,2.0,11/10/2012,The Potato soup needs to come with cheese and bacon on-top. The soup also needs to be hot and more chunkier. The potatoes need to be bigger.
Betty B.,"Oakland, CA",23,103,43,2.0,9/11/2011,"Service...... 2 stars. Food.....3 stars. Controlling your restaurant.......ZERO stars. As a paying customer, the staff should attempt to make everyone's visit worth the money and wait. Last night two friends and I visited the CF for dinner around 9pm. We were seated on the patio due to nice summer to fall breeze. Unfortunately, we had no idea that the volume control was under no constraints on the patio area. The table sitting next to us was so loud and rude the entire dinner. Needless to say, I will not be going back for awhile. The manager came over to ask us if we wanted to be moved, at the end of dinner. Give me a break!!!"
Bryan H.,"Franklin, TN",83,367,28,2.0,12/12/2011,"When it comes to food, this place is always awesome.  The service the last two times I have been there was awful.  We are a family of 5 which means we have to wait on the larger tables or tables put together.  They told us 30 minutes, it took about 50-55.  I saw a whole room empty of everyone except us then new people come in and get seated quickly.  Once seated, the waitress took awhile and hit her other tables before finally getting to us.  Food prep time was normal for TCF.  The experience was about 2 hours total....and we were traveling through.  If it was to hang out with friends, maybe it would have been okay, but with a family of 3 kids that were hungry, it was not a good experience at all to WAIT forever."
Monika S.,"New York, NY",1,35,,2.0,3/7/2013,"The popularity of this place is mystifying. Expect 45-60 minute waits on Friday or Saturday nights. The food tastes like what you would expect from a chain. It's edible but everything is cookie cutter. The sald dressings and sauces taste like they are from mixes, nothing tastes authentic. Obviously I'm in the minority in my opinion, but when I go out I want meals that I can't make better at home. And I'm not a fan of oversized portions, which are de rigeur here. If you want to add to the obseity epidemic, this is a great place to start."
