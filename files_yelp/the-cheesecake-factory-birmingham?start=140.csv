Kelley J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",20,9,16,5.0,9/9/2013,"My husband and stopped in this Cheesecake Factory as we were heading to Chattanooga to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated immediately by a smiling hostess and our waiter was also pleasant and attentive to our needs, without hovering. I ordered the Chicken Stuffed Tortillas that came with Black Beans and Corn Cakes. The waiter was very apologetic when he notified me that they had run out of black beans but he was quick to offer any side dish of my choosing as a substitute. My meal was prepared and presented very well! I enjoyed consuming my meal while debating which flavor of cheesecake I was going to get...I settled on the Turtle Cheesecake and was completely in Heaven while enjoying it!!"
Susan G.,"Decatur, AL",4,8,,2.0,11/9/2013,"Cannot rate the food as we sat on the outside patio for 15 minutes with our menus and never got a glance from any of the waiters.So we left, very disappointed as I have heard lots of good reviews on the cheesecake."
Pennie N.,"Attalla, AL",2,60,32,5.0,10/28/2013,"We went this weekend and the staff catered to us the whole time by making changes to our order to make our meal better & satisfy our pickiness. LOL. The atmosphere was great and we had a nice time. EXCEPT for the table next to us who let their kid do flips on his chair tossing his feet an inch from my face....and they sat there and watched without saying a word to the boy. People.... leave your kids at home if you can't make them act right in public....and if you're gonna just let them be rude anyway, just stay home yourself!"
Cole R.,"Tupelo, MS",17,4,7,3.0,3/10/2013,"It's a little over priced and I always get questionable service here, but I always enjoy my food. The food is really good for a chain restaurant, but the service drags it down a bit. This trip my wife's tuna was entirely too spicy for either of us to eat, but other than that the food was good.  The cheesecake is always solid."
Nyree P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,2.0,3/9/2015,"My two girlfriends and I decided to end our evening at The Cheesecake Factory for drinks. I ordered the Pineapple margarita  and my girlfriend ordered two cocktails. We were all shocked after receiving our bill. One drink cost $15, with tip $17. My girlfriend ended up paying $32 for two drinks. We'll definitely be going elsewhere for the next girls night out."
Lillie P.,"Fredericksburg, VA",96,79,21,5.0,9/4/2011,"The Pina Colada Cheesecake earns 5+ stars. Heavenly. I won't wait an hour to eat a meal there on any given weekend but I will walk to the dessert carryout register and get a slice for an extra special treat to take home. More than enough for 2 to share.  On second thought, maybe you shouldn't try it because it is addictive and I'm sure very bad for you :P"
Nevada M.,"Birmingham, AL",0,1,1,5.0,10/20/2013,"Amazing service, amazing food selection and taste, and our waiter, Jacob, was nice and very polite. Place is absolutely amazing!"
G C.,"Anniston, AL",0,25,19,4.0,12/20/2014,"Very good meal. Usual Cheesecake Factory fare. Very busy, but it is the Holidays.  Great waiter named Tyler."
Ashley K.,"Calera, AL",4,42,6,4.0,9/18/2013,"Great food. Sometimes the employees make you want to pull your hair out, but the cheesecake can be worth it.  I love the huge portions you get for your money."
Christopher W.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,91,4,3.0,1/1/2013,"Cheesecake factory is always a great spot to turn to when you either have limited options or just want a good dessert.  A friend and I had lunch here today, and while the quality of food is always good, to me it's somewhat subpar at times.  For instance, I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich with a side salad.  The sandwich was completely overloaded with avocado and salsa that the unique taste of the sandwich was lost within.  The jalapeno peppers I requested never arrived... and my side salad came out with the wrong dressing.  Once I removed the chicken from the bread to eat it by itself it tasted just like you would expect from a cooked chargrilled chicken patty that has been frozen and then reheated for serving. My friend ordered the meatloaf sandwich... and I will just say that the butter from the bread was so overpowering that it really was difficult to eat.  And the side of mashed potatoes he ordered was sent back twice because they were so cold.  The gravy that accompanied was even colder. The two slices of cheesecake we each had was, of course, absolutely phenomenal!  If I were rating the dessert alone it would be 5-stars - no question about it!"
Patty F.,"Gulfport, MS",4,3,2,5.0,9/9/2013,"Me and my Mom enjoyed our lunch very much -We shared an entree salad with fried chicken and fresh greens - we both agreed it was the best salad we ever had - also split a slice of cheesecake which was excellent -  Only next time we will ask for our dessert to be brought first so it has time to warm up, it was cold and cheesecake is better at room temp. - Our waiter was so good and helpful that we left him an $11 tip on a $28 check - Food, atmosphere and service were some of the best we have had while traveling - will defineately go again on trips to Birmingham"
Elizabeth C.,"Madison, AL",83,11,,5.0,9/4/2011,"We were seated quickly, had superb service and the food was all amazing.   There are so many choices on their menu that we had a hard time deciding.   I had the Steak Diane which was very tender, husband had the cobb salad and he loved it and our daughter had the Americana Cheeseburger.  My husband of course had to sample her burger and said it was one of the best he's had.   LOVED the fried macaroni and cheese.  Great service, great food.  We'll go back on our next trip to Birmingham!"
Jeff W.,"San Carlos, CA",92,296,4,4.0,4/11/2011,"Like any other cheesecake factory, the menu is HUGE and the food all tastes good.  I was pleased with how quickly tables were turned around even with a 45 minute wait, we only waited 25 or so minutes.   Service was attentive, and friendly. You made us race car drivers very happy that evening....."
Kisente F.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,111,61,4.0,4/15/2013,"This place is huge. The decor is amazing. They have sculpture, full bar, lots tables (still busy enough to have a long line). The menu is as thick as a book. It will take a while to eat through their menu just as long as trying their incredible different types of cheesecakes. Their food is good, but I mainly come here to try their cheesecakes."
Tiffany L.,"Chicago, IL",6,9,2,4.0,6/2/2014,"Cheesecake factory is wonderful! The salmon is my favorite dish! Their endless choices of cheesecake are wonderful!! The only downside is how crowded it always is, so call ahead to avoid the stress :)"
Justin W.,"Birmingham, AL",101,319,801,5.0,8/16/2012,"Delicious! Another one of my favorite restaurant chains. The funny thing is, I would come here anytime for the dessert alone. Not to mention the food here is delicious, too. The portions are massive! Try to order as small a portions as you can so that you might save room for dessert. There is a mountain of options to choose from for food and dessert, and each one arrives as a mountain on your table. If you're a leftover kind of person, you will always have the opportunity for lots of great leftovers from here. Have fun! Did I ever mention that I love desserts?"
Jim O.,"Auburn, AL",0,45,,3.0,11/5/2011,"I am not a fan of the seating. They pile you in so close to each other and you feel like you are at a company picnic. They do have booths but if you dont have a bunch of people in your party, you are seated on top of someone else. Food, Fish tacos totally fell apart. They need to use two corn shells instead of one skinny flour tortilla. Taste was good but it was so unpleasant to eat, I didnt really enjoy it. Cheesecake was very good, drinks were totally overpriced. Paid 11.50 for a martini and 9.00 for a very small margarita. No prices on drink menu, so that was my fault."
Erin H.,"Coker, AL",1,42,6,5.0,11/24/2012,"My boyfriend took me here for the first time and I loved it! We got some type of Cajun chicken pasta, and it was amazing! For our cheesecake, we got the caramel apple cheesecake, which was absolutely incredible! Cannot wait to go back and really wanna try the peppermint bark cheesecake!"
Holli D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",112,205,39,4.0,3/10/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factor! I crave the Thai Lettuce Wraps that are listed as an appetizer, but I make a meal. We went for happy hour and sat at the bar. The bar tender, Nick, was friendly, accommodating & had great suggestions. We were given a bread basket...yummy!! We order the $5 hot spinach dip that was more than enough for 2 & delicious!! My honey ordered the lunch portion Shepherd's pie which was HUGE!!! I had the Thai lettuce wraps. Stella draft beer was $3 and I had a glass of pinot for $4. We also had a piece of Turtle Pecan Cheesecake. Total bill $51. We felt that was great for 3 drinks, appetizer, 2 meals and cheesecake! The place was clean. Lines form quickly so pick your time to go!"
Rick C.,"Birmingham, AL",5,3,4,5.0,2/19/2012,"What can I say. The Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite restaurant in Birmingham. Mainly because I love cheesecake in general but the full menu is impressive. The only downside is that the CF in the summit is usually packed, especially on the weekend but that is just another testament of the food quality right? All in all if you get a chance stop by the CF and have a bite."
