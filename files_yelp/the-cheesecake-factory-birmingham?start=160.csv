Keith C.,"Birmingham, AL",97,161,664,5.0,9/4/2009,"When The Cheesecake Factory opened in Birmingham, I remember being a part of the Hype Brigade, sitting in line with a 2+-hour long wait to get a table.  It was very much worth it, and for the next couple of months, my wife and I probably visited several times again.  Then it happened - we got burned out and didn't go back for over a year's time until this week.  And I'm happy to say that the food is as good now as we remembered.  Everything we tasted, from the appetizer (Tex Mex Eggrolls are SO fantastic) to the main entree, was phenomenal.  The wait staff, hostess, and even the workers behind the dessert area were exceptionally welcoming, even for a restaurant that's been in business for quite a while here, and is notably popular from just word-of-mouth alone.  (Sometimes a good reputation becomes a crutch for good restaurants, leading them to stray from the things that made them good in the first place...) I seriously doubt that with the HUGE variety of foods, cordial employees, and mellowed atmosphere, you will have a disappointing time at The Cheesecake Factory."
Nicole B.,"Birmingham, AL",1,10,,2.0,1/2/2012,Hubby and I picked up carry out yesterday. I had the Sweet Corn Cakes. They have gotten Really lazy. Starting to see their crappy chain side showing through. And they are way overpriced.
Taii W.,"Birmingham, AL",6,20,2,5.0,2/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory was great as always. Vanilla Bean is the best. It was really packed however, had to wait 40 minutes to get in. But it was worth it."
Jessica P.,"Overton, AL",2,2,1,5.0,5/14/2014,Our server Drake was outstanding. Very informative and paced our meal well. The food (shepherds pie) was also just plain yummy. The chicken bellagio has become an all time favorite as well.
Arefeen S.,"Atlanta, GA",12,80,14,3.0,2/27/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is the Jack-in-the-Box of upper-mid-scale restaurants - it has a variety of unrelated things on the menu (20 or so pages worth of items, in fact) but nothing is particularly outstanding. Well, the cheesecake and other desserts are nice, but should one be paying $7 for factory-made delivered-frozen cheesecake?"
Kipp G.,"McCalla, AL",1,14,,5.0,7/27/2010,"I love this place! With that said, it is a little too pricey for me and the misses to go there on a regular basis---probably because we get an appetizer, main course, cheesecake for each, etc. But, the portions of food are very large and there is plenty to take home for delicious, delicious leftovers. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant."
Melissa B.,"Gallatin, TN",27,32,,5.0,7/25/2011,"We walked in and were instantly greeted by polite hostesses. There was no wait time, and we were immediately seated. Our server introduced himself, and took our order for drinks. The menu is extensive, and nothing like I've ever seen. It was really hard to make a decision. We ordered an appetizer of Mexican corn-cakes. They were delicious, and presented nicely. It didn't take forever to get our food, and when it arrived at our table, was nice and hot. We were all happy with the quality and quantity of food we received. I ended up taking most of mine home. Overall, we had a great experience at this restaurant. We were all too full for dessert and hope to enjoy some actual cheesecake next time!"
Jim B.,"Vestavia, AL",0,9,,1.0,7/11/2013,"One of the great mysteries in life is how Cheesecake Factory can continue to schlep out oversalted, mediocre food, at ridiculously high prices, and people still clamor to sit at one of their tables and scarf it down."
Clarence L W.,"Jackson, MS",10,7,,3.0,5/1/2011,"I enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was ok; wasn't as good as I expected, but was not unenjoyable. I would like to try the experience again."
Doug R.,"Birmingham, AL",24,12,,2.0,10/8/2010,"Went back for brunch and they actually let us sit down before our entire group was there.  My breakfast burrito was a real disappointment.  It was extremely salty and smothered in an odd sauce that competed with the other flavors of the supposedly mexican cuisine-inspired dish.  Service lacked the smiley polish, but as a side bonus we didn't get the upsell."
Ali L.,"Wakefield, MA",75,25,,4.0,7/13/2011,Went here late at night for an after plane ride meal - it was great. The food was out almost as fast as the drinks (I ordered together). My waitor Adam was very attentive.
