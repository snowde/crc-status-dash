Paul H.,"Wetumpka, AL",2,11,,5.0,9/16/2017,This is my first visit to The Cheesecake Factory and I am suitably impressed. The decor is very nice. The staff is very good. The food is excellent. We had the parmesan bread and the spinach dip. Both were perfect. I had the Cuban and it was very good. The tira misu cheesecake was an excellent finish to an excellent meal. For the quality and quantity it is certainly worth the price.
Brittany O.,"Birmingham, AL",17,18,11,4.0,2/18/2017,"I've had countless birthday dinners here. It is my trusty go to for finicky friends because the menu is so large they always have something some picky eater will enjoy. My go to is always the chicken piccata, although it's super heavy on calories, it tastes light and flavorful. Pro-tip- add Cajun shrimp for a game changer. It pairs really well with the lemony wine sauce."
Kübra U.,"Birmingham, AL",56,13,3,3.0,3/13/2017,"This place always has great food, but for some reason they never have the cheesecake I want to order and if you sit outside their service can be slower than normal. Make sure to call and make a reservation before you go if you visit after 6 and are a bigger group than 5 or you'll be waiting an hour to be seated."
Herb L.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",3,95,12,3.0,6/19/2016,"It amazes me how busy this place is.  I know it's nothing more than big corporate chain restaurant. But they are dialed in machine. It's predictable what you are going to get in terms of service and food. You find that one dish in the massive menu and time to time you crave that dish and deal with the massive crowd and wait to eat there.  Yes I am brainwashed by the pre made cheesecake also.  But honestly, if it wasn't a chain restaurant and my bias for them wasn't there, I would give this place a 4 star."
Miranda R.,"Birmingham, AL",107,156,37,4.0,9/9/2015,"I try to avoid the Summit and Summit restaurants like the plague, but I was spending time with my Mother and we were there, and hungry, so Cheesecake Factory it was this past Saturday. No line, no waiting, and out on the covered patio we went. It did seem like our food and drinks took a hot minute to be delivered. I guess they were bumpin' inside. It was fine though. She had a pina colada and I a strawberry daiquiri (what is this, the beach?) and both were tasty. HOWEVER, prices are not marked and thus we paid $11 per drink. $11 at a chain restaurant?  For ice and rum? Who are you kidding TCF? This ain't Collins Bar or Bottega or something. This is rinkydink Cheesecake Factory.  I had the Farfelle Garlic Chicken Mushroom Something Something Pasta dish and it was really good. And SUCH a large portion I had enough for lunch again the next day, split with another person. Mom enjoyed her food too. It was a pleasant surprise for a chain place. Great food. Our waitress was sweet as pie and it was a good experience. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if I were there shopping, then yes. Hit it up!"
Vonkeysha G.,"Aliceville, AL",0,5,3,1.0,2/26/2017,Horrible EXPERIENCE....We waited 2 1/2 hours to be seated...Once inside we waited another 2 HOURS to receive our meal...Food wasnt great but cheeseburger didn't disappoint.....Our server was inexperienced and needed more training...I would NEVER visit again....I did notify the manager of the issues and NOTHING was corrected.....The manager seem like she had other issues to worry about than entertain mine....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! FYI CHEESECAKE LINE WAS A MILE LONG
Jenny T.,"Tuscumbia, AL",32,53,,4.0,2/4/2017,"My go to restaurant when one is available, because the food is always delicious and there are a lot of options to choose from.  I like the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer and mix up my entree from one visit to the next.  the small Greek salad with grilled chicken is enough for a meal for myself,  especially if I'm having cheesecake (which I would never skip)! this location is small.  we arrived 15 minutes prior to the restaurant opening, and there was already a crowd gathered.   We were seated immediately,  but by the time we were finished eating there were several families waiting.  Service was quick and friendly.  Hope to be back soon!"
Whitney B.,"Birmingham, AL",131,68,133,3.0,3/23/2016,"Well...I've been here a couple of times and let me start by saying, if you have visited this location in another state, this probably won't hold up to the standard. We waited about 2 hours to be seated and then once we sat we waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to notice us. The food is alright, I usually only go for the calamari and strawberry lemonade which we had to mee flagging down our waiter to refill. He was pretty awkward with a serious attitude. They had the heaters on outside but kept moving them to accommodate different guest that were hot which left every one else freezing from the wind. I probably won't be back here for awhile."
Donna B.,"Springfield, MO",0,53,27,3.0,10/28/2016,We always enjoy our trip to the Cheesecake Factory but I gave it three stars as the stuffed chicken tortillas could not be cut with a fork. I had to use a knife! Still tasted good.
Cindy R.,"Navarre, FL",62,12,3,1.0,3/28/2016,"Worst cheesecake factory I have ever been to and I have been to quite a few all over the country. We went on Easter Sunday. The long wait for table didn't bother us much but there was no seating and very crowded in the entry area. Once seated our server was not very attentive at all. But due to the large crows understandable. The worst part was the food!!! Ordered steak Diane and it lacked everything. No salt or pepper. No flavor...then I ordered medium rare and got it well done... husband ordered scampi shrimp combo and also hated the lack of flavor from the meal. We are really big fans of the cheesecake factory but after this visit, but after this visit we might have to find a new spot. Definitely won't be back to this location."
Michael S.,"Boulder, CO",8,186,11,5.0,5/21/2015,"I normally don't eat at Cheesecake Factories because the food is chain food, but these guys really helped me out when I called just before their closing time as I was traveling through town, and they made the food and then handed it to me 45 minutes after they closed. I very much appreciated that and it made my night as I had been busy with work all day and did not have time to eat, and wanted to get to my next hotel in Tuscaloosa.  The food may not be what I would normally eat, but these guys made up for anything by helping me out."
Debjani C.,"Montgomery, AL",10,3,,5.0,7/15/2016,One of my favorite places to eat is the Cheesecake factory. The staff is very friendly and they recommend the substitutions and specials.

GG D.,"Prattville, AL",0,35,6,1.0,5/7/2016,We drove an hout to find A five hour wait for LUNCH on a Saturday for a party of 6...  no fucking way...  this place doesn't have good that good...  I won't ever even try to come back..
Jett S.,"Boaz, AL",14,25,2,1.0,3/6/2016,"HORRIBLE service. Getting one slice of cheesecake carside should not be a thirty minute ordeal.  What's the point of having and advertising carside service if you don't actually provide it?  Even then, we had to go inside, which was not much better. A fifteen minute wait for something ready made that was preodered? That's unacceptable, especially at this price point."
Kimyatta W.,"Birmingham, AL",15,1,,1.0,12/31/2016,"I followed the instructions provided and submitted my information, but have not heard from anyone."
Ashley H.,"Browns Mills, NJ",25,13,,5.0,7/2/2017,Haven't been to a cheesecake in years and this place definitely lives up to it's name everywhere. The chinese chicken salad was amazing and so was the spicy chipotle pasta. Our waiter was super nice and friendly made sure we had everything. Even put up with 3 crazy kids.
Madison M.,"Montevallo, AL",42,5,,5.0,12/28/2016,Went tonight and as usual had a great experience. There was about a 30 minute wait which was a surprise being that it was a Wednesday. Our server was kind and quick. I ordered the factory burrito grande like I always do and was as usual satisfied. My only complaint is that the restaurant was too cold so it made me want to leave quickly.
Melissa H.,"Helena, AL",0,3,,5.0,6/24/2017,"A family favorite. Love that there is something for everyone on the menu and it is always delicious. Of course the cheesecake is divine.  Cannot say enough about how much we love the atmosphere, service and food."
James R.,"Harrah, OK",0,5,,2.0,6/20/2017,"Man. The ""food off truck"" model has proven itself to be what it is. The service was disappointing. The food was way off. Can't come back. Just won't do it to the fam again."
Heather S.,"Calera, AL",21,5,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"Where to even begin?? We went on a Sunday evening at 7pm, the hostess never looked up from the computer screen and was very short, we even heard her yell at a waiter. We were seated and ordered drinks which were fabulous, we placed Our order for food and then the wait began. An hour later we get our food (Miso salmon and Evelyn's pasta). The salmon had a very fishy taste and not in a good way, the pasta was hard and rubbery in texture and the dish lacked the olives, eggplant and artichokes that were stated on the description on the menu. We asked for a manager and explained the issue, she took our plates and took the charges off (we paid for our drinks) which was great, but she didn't really fix the problem. We left hungry and pissed. Will never go back."
