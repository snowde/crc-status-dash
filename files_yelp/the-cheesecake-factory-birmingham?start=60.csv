Donna A.,"Birmingham, AL",225,60,49,2.0,1/5/2016,"I know you're hungry, and I know the idea of over 100 choices on a menu sounds like a great idea. But just don't do it. This place is highly over priced for extremely mediocre food. I ordered pizza, I mean, how do you manage to ruin that? Well it was completely soggy except for the crust. Inedible. I am pretty sure everything is frozen then cooked. The only saving grace was their salad. I would have tried their cheesecakes which admittedly looked rather amazing, but I was too grossed out by the pizza and the state of my friends fried fish tacos.  On another note their service was pretty on top of their game, and continuously refilled our drinks. They seemed pretty organized even though it was fairly busy. I would be tempted to go back and try the cheesecake. But honestly other than that, I know it is convenient, but just go to a non chain in town."
Kristy S.,"Plano, TX",0,38,4,5.0,7/26/2016,Sat at the bar - bartenders could not have been more prompt or friendly! Service and food were great.  No complaints!
Jane B.,"Birmingham, AL",38,45,61,3.0,7/8/2016,"You know what you're getting coming in, so grumbling about canned smiles and homogenized food is senseless.  We've been here several times and have always enjoyed the food, even if my stomach doesn't, but that's just because I'm not a regular consumer of butter.  Almost everything here is very rich, but you're prepared for that already because you've probably already picked out your cheesecake before getting here.    I know I do, but I can only eat half a slice before wanting to die.   We usually ask for a booth and have always been accommodated.  This time we were too hungry and they were too busy (because we foolishly showed up in the middle of a holiday weekend), so the first place they put us was the long strip of tiny tables in the middle of the floor where your elbows bump with your neighbor's the whole time.  Here you get dinner AND a show.  A man sitting three inches from me asked as many questions as he could about the menu to the flustered waitress, but the odd thing was that 90% of these questions were about chicken fingers on the kid's menu (there were no kids with him).  He studied the menu like it was Proust, meticulously going through everything, running his finger up and down it and umming and ahhing over everything.  After a long time of this the pressure got to him and he ordered a burger and fries.  Meanwhile, at my other elbow, a sour, silent couple emitted bitter energy into the atmosphere as she glared at the kitchen door with impatience for the entire time it took him to down two beers and order a third.   Keep your expectations realistic.  You're in for really good cheesecake and a safe, predictable and slightly over-priced meal of buttery pasta or fries or ceasar salads or any  of that usual stuff people get at these places."
Raye B.,"Birmingham, AL",100,189,352,4.0,10/25/2015,"Who knew happy hour could be this happy! We were clearly distracted as our sole purpose for even going to the factory was to share a slice of cheesecake in the midst of our celebration. We however, got lured in and found our way to a high top table in the bar area. The happy hour menu danced in our faces with TONS of reasonably priced/shareable options. We were pleased to see low cocktail prices and ordered a few (cosmo and iced tea). My, oh my, compliments to the bartender- his concoctions were made promptly and tasty. While we were waiting, though we knew we only wanted cheesecake, we went ahead and ordered the buffalo blast appetizer. WHY- we only wanted cheesecake, but still managed to be led by our sense of instant hunger. Needless to say, they were good and gone in 45 minutes between the two of us. We agree the blasts might as well be a full meal versus an appetizer- they are so filing and CF definitely doesn't skimp on quantity. I would recommend an order of these and maybe a side item or side salad as your meal. Though full, we finally ordered our white chocolate raspberry cheesecake......to go! Overall, I would say that Cheesecake Factory has one of the best happy hours in town with lots of app/snack/meal options as well as a special bar menu. The restaurant crowd was not obnoxious by far, but rather quiet. If you can make it down 280 between 4-6pm M-F, you're sure to leave happy, stuffed or worse; both. My only advice, don't do what we did, stick to your plan and only go for what you planned to go for...cheesecake."
Erik P.,"Belleville, IL",0,3,,5.0,5/10/2017,Our server Amanda made the night!  So fun and so helpful. Everyone should ask for her to wait on them!
Vicki C.,"Birmingham, AL",2,26,,5.0,7/22/2016,"Did take out this time. Took awhile to answer the phone but when they did, it was very quick and professional. The super antioxidant salad was very good, the Shepards pie is always a hit and the meatloaf was spot on as usual."
Autumn B.,"Pensacola, FL",229,53,30,4.0,9/4/2016,My husband and I aren't typically a fan of chains but the food at the cheesecake factory was fresh and delicious. We sat at the bar and our bartender was awesome knowledgeable of the menu and fast! Of course the cheesecake was to die for with the Dulce de Leche and the traditional with strawberries. The tie wrap appetizer was phenomenal and big enough for a meal. The waitstaff  worked together flawlessly to make our  experience awesome. Would definitely go back.
Keaira T.,"Birmingham, AL",210,6,,5.0,5/3/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has easily become my favorite restaurant. From the customer service from the staff to the food, it is a total experience you will not forget. I recommend if you love cheesecake to try the red velvet cheesecake there. The only down fall of the restaurant is the wait. Easily, the restaurant fills up quickly and the wait turns into 2 to 2 1/2 hour wait for a party of 2. Other than that, the food is great and the service is great as well."
Bright C.,"Birmingham, AL",13,16,227,4.0,1/30/2016,"I really enjoy the food here but sometimes, the waiting time to get seated is extremely long. This time, the wait time was 1 hour and 30 minutes to get seated and maybe another 20 minutes to receive the food. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, one of my favorite salads at Cheesecake Factory. I also ordered the Vanilla Bean cheesecake as a desert. Another part I dislike is that the food, especially the cheesecake, is very expensive compared to the cost of production. Yet, I definitely recommend people visit this restaurant."
Brad M.,"Birmingham, AL",0,4,,1.0,9/11/2016,By far the WORST eggs Benedict I've ever had!  Eggs were hard boiled. Yuck!  Fruit looked like it was 5 days old. The blue berries tasted like bananas. The omelette was like a rubber yellow basketball. Cut back on your 20 page menu. Service was like a dead fish. Y'all need to get your act together.
Gregory S.,"Birmingham, AL",104,307,1120,5.0,9/27/2015,"When you want a large selection of items on the menu (Salads, Appetizers, Italian, Burgers, Cajun, Asian Fusion, Steaks, Comfort, Desert, etc.) go here. If I want consistency in drinks and food, I'm never dissapointed. If its crowded and you don't mind a slightly busy atmosphere, first come first serve in the bar area! If you're too full for dessert, some meals are dinosaur portions, take the cheesecake home for layer. It keeps very well. Anyways, I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers... certainly consistent in quality!"
Joshua S.,"Trussville, AL",62,106,614,4.0,6/30/2014,"Consistent. ALWAYS consistently great! The cheese cake factory started out selling cheesecake. They expanded the business with meals and kept the cheesecake. The reality is that most people go for the entrees and the cheesecake is just a bonus. I rarely even eat cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  I mentioned the Cheesecake Factory is consistent. My other favorite attribute is the expansive menu. Most restaurant cut down on menu items to help a kitchen produce more smoothly and efficiently. At the Cheesecake Factory you pay a bit more but you got a ton of menu options . The expansive menu is great for groups because there is something for everyone.  The food is generally very good. I find that the cheese cake factory is better than other more specialized restaurants. For example, the Cheesecake Factory can make better Cajun inspired cuisine than a Cajun restaurant. (Such as Cajun steamer) The interior is nicely decorated; the lightly is casual and comfortable. They have outdoor seating which is nice during the evening when the sub sets. A few things enter my mind when considering flaws. First, the menu is full of advertisements. Second, it's a bit more expensive for comparable dishes at other restaurants . Finally , it gets very crowded and the wait can get pretty long on the weekends.  In conclusion, the cheesecake is a great ""go-to"" spot for friends and family. They have something to satisfy everyone, and they do so consistently. It's a franchise and it's not really anything spectacular, but it is among the best in the area."
Rodney C.,"Wilsonville, AL",1,7,,5.0,8/20/2016,Great place to eat. The staff and service was excellent. We ate lunch and the food was delicious. The turkey sandwich with bacon and avocado with a green salad was out of world.
LM F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",65,60,145,4.0,5/24/2014,"Someone asked me what the Cheesecake Factory was. After a little chortle, I said it's an expensive bite of yumminess. As you walk in, you might be greeted by a half-smile from the hostess who is doing her best to accommodate having to find seats for paying customers, when I suspect she really wants to just pull out her phone and take another selfie. We wait a few minutes, not long, and led to our table. Our waiter takes our drink orders. He's friendly and courteous. We have kids with us, so being nice to them will earn you bonus points (ahem, bigger tip). We peruse through the Cheesecake Factory Encyclopedia or better known as ""Menu."" You name it. Italian, Asian, American...it's a United Nations of culinary delight. I settled on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, a little Thai craving. It was a peanut-infused, coconut, curry sensation. It wasn't overpowering, but it also wasn't bland. The only critique I have is too much pepper on the shrimp. I almost did a little chair dance.  Others in my party ordered the Buffalo Blasters, and those blasted his socks off. I think he actually did a little chair dance, or his butt was asleep. Who knows. He loved it. Another one in my party ordered the Salmon Wraps. She said they sucked. To be fair, they were on the skinny menu. For this fluffy chick, most things on the skinny menu are inedible. I guess that's why skinny chicks stay skinny. So she ordered the Salmon BBQ, which she loved. I guess that's what she mumbled while nom-nom-nom. The kids ordered everything from sliders to Fettuccine Alfredo. For them, if it comes with ketchup, they're happy. Then came dessert and where this overrated place earned four stars. My fat cells definitely did the Macarena when I had some of the Dulce de Leche. It was rich yet light with hints of caramel, vanilla, and freakin' awesomeness. The others ordered the Oreo Cheesecake, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, and Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. They scarfed them down while singing about unicorns and rainbows."
Lacy W.,"Birmingham, AL",34,95,114,5.0,6/27/2014,"We go here on a regular basis. Long wait Friday & Saturday nights, but that's to be expected. So many things to choose from on the menu. One thing I really love about CF is that they are very accommodating to people with small children. When my 3 year old was younger, they would bring him a plate of bread & cut up bananas for free! This is brilliant in so many ways. Treat the kids right & the parents will keep coming back. My husband & I have a few things a piece that we really like to order, but sometimes try new things. We are rarely disappointed. Service can range from great to ok, but never very poor. And then there's the cheesecake.... Need I say more?"
Jessica M.,"Birmingham, AL",25,44,166,5.0,7/27/2015,"If you're smart don't go to the cheesecake factory during dinner hours unless you wish to wait at the minimum 45 minutes. I went during lunch and was seated right away. They have a little lunch menu which is very handy given that their regular menu is so extensive . I went with the Mexican lettuce wraps which came in the shape of tacos making it easier to eat. Also, I had a white sangria. The sangria had mostly oranges in it for the fruit and was good. But what made me the happiest was the gluten-free Godiva chocolate cheesecake. With good service and good food I can't complain."
Jennifer N.,"Birmingham, AL",142,134,137,3.0,1/30/2016,"The wait at this location is very long. Doesn't matter if it's lunch or dinner, weeknight or weekend. It really doesn't seem to matter if it's even crowded, it just seems to take forever to get a table. OBVIOUSLY, if you are only going to get a slice for dessert, as we have, it's much quicker, and that is a different review. The cheesecake is good. Very good. The rest of the food is the bigger issue.I have yet to have an entrée that blew me away, The prices are higher than average,and I think you must pay for the name or the novelty, because I don't think the quality of food is worth it. We will go there solely for dessert from now on."
Tamiko N.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/23/2016,Service is horrible and management doesn't care.  Had bad service two days in a row; I won't be bothered a third time as my lesson has been learned.  The staff is rude or just flat out ignores you and management doesn't care.   Avoid and just go to Pappadeaux's.
Mykel W.,"Birmingham, AL",0,1,2,5.0,9/10/2015,"Just stopped in for some cheesecake and a drink, great service! Great atmosphere, great drinks and amazing cheesecake! Will come again for sure!"
Emily S.,"Dolomite, AL",118,19,,2.0,1/9/2016,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory but I cannot rate higher than 2 stars for my latest experience. First, let me clarify that I work in the restraunt industry and I am also an avid cook. I know food prep and I know when its bad. We called ahead and were quoted a 45-1 hour wait but when we got there, we were quoted 20-30 which was excellent. However, we were seated at an incredibly small table where one wall was booths and the other were chairs. Besides the 2 of us, there were 3 other people on the booth seating and it was cramped to say the least. I understand you want to seat as many tables as possible, but breaking up a 4 top for a 2 top is not a solution when they have no elbow room. Bread and butter were meager, disappointing as they used to have harty portions. We placed our orders after much debate--he got catfish, I got some pasta (can't recall the name, it was a penne pasta with mushrooms and wine sauce.) I asked to substitute noodles for angel hair and our server was happy to do so. Sadly, my pasta was AWFUL. The noodles were so overcooked, it was hard to chew them they were so sticky and crunchy all at one. The sauce was also improperly reduced and still had a bitter, acrid aftertaste that told me they had not cooked out the alcohol. After lots of debate, I finally sent it back and ordered a burger instead. The burger was good, but I asked for it to be cooked medium well and it was well done to say the least. My fiance's catfish was good but he found multiple ""corn hairs"" in his vegetables (which tells me they did not shuck the corn properly) and his fish's breading fell away when he touched a piece. Really disappointing, considering our bill was about $70 with the tip. The only reason this isn't 1 Star is because our server was superb. I believe her name was Charlie---long blond hair, very sweet. She was very apologetic and speedy and kept our drinks full. Such a shame their staff seems to be amazing on the floor but sub-par at best in the kitchen."
