Brian H.,"San Francisco, CA",54,130,24,1.0,10/16/2014,"Do you like eating sugar in the dark?  Come here! But seriously, if I have to pull out my phone to read the menu, YOUR LIGHTS ARE TOO LOW. Cheesecake factory does cheesecake pretty well, and they should... it's their name.  However, everything else this franchise does, it fails at. Even stopping in for dessert and coffee, I find myself completely let down.  This last time, I ordered a Carmel Macchiato and it came to the table with not only caramel as expected, but sugar added as well?  It should be plenty sweet with just the caramel, but even if the person making it felt like it should be sweeter, give me the OPTION to add the sweetener.  I nearly gagged trying to finish the lukewarm drink. I just don't have anything good to say about this place.  The cheesecake almost redeems it, but there are plenty of cheesecake factory franchises that deserve business more than this one."
Anthony M.,"Birmingham, AL",1,15,8,4.0,4/24/2016,"Lunch at the Cheese Cake Factory after Mass, large crowd but wait for seating was short. I enjoyed the Fish & Chips and I think the fish was Cod. If you are hungry get the dinner portion, and yes it cost more but you get more than you will if you select lunch portion.  Their cold slaw is always delicious, their Passion tea I give a zero, its not sweeten and I guess I am comparing their tea to Starbucks Passion tea that is really good and you can get it already sweeten. I guess they did not listen to their mama when she said its hard to sweeten cold tea. Overall my eating experience at this place is a 9. I was too full to get my cheesecake this visit."

Mike S.,"Chicago, IL",137,169,140,3.0,11/2/2014,"Not my favorite cheesecake factory location, if only because it's unnecessarily crowded... or maybe the waitstaff is actually just overtaxed.   Either way, it leaves for a fairly mediocre experience on a given weekend. I'll suggest a revamp of some of the appetizer options as well; it should be hard to mess up crab wontons (aka rangoons) and everybody knows guac--especially the fresh variety--needs a little salt to make it spark.  The Jamaican black pepper shrimp and miso salmon are still good, though I kinda miss the old school skirt steak that used to be in place of the shrimp.   All in all, better cheesecake locations in Atlanta, Nashville and uh, even the one in Denver... But there are a ton more interesting places to eat in either of those places too."
Kyle R.,"Monroe, LA",0,12,1,5.0,4/4/2016,"This place is awesome. One might have to wait 15-30min to be seated, but that's because so many people want to eat here. We just had a beer at the bar while we waited any ways. Expect to pay a bit more than most places, but the food is better and comes in huge proportions. My wife and I usually just split something and we are both full. And the cake was huge."
Dianne S.,"Phenix City, AL",39,14,29,2.0,6/12/2016,"Let me share a little history related to the Cheesecake Factory at the Summit in Birmingham. For approximately the last 7 years a large group of us have traveled to Birmingham for an annual event. On Sunday morning as we are leaving town we always stop at this restaurant. Because we are a large group we call on Saturday night to let them know to expect us. I wouldn't say we have reservations but they extend the courtesy to serve us. Until this trip.,,,, Saturday night when we called the manager, Nick I think was rude and even called the caller a liar when he explained our history. We are sitting here now after an hour and I'd like to take our considerable business elsewhere. The manager did not make himself available until we had been there about 45 minutes and the receptionist asked one of our party to step away from the counter. I'll submit a review of the food later. (I need to correct one thing, we called early this morning, not last night). Next year we'll take our $500 check and tips elsewhere.  I"
Matt G.,"Summerville, SC",5,17,21,4.0,4/4/2014,"Good experience overall.  Service: My waitress Courtney was the best. She was very attentive and had a great attitude.  Food: Started things off with the endive salad which was good but had a little too much blue cheese. For the main course I had the Bistro shrimp pasta which looked appetizing and was very delicious. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and melded great with the mushrooms. For desert I had the strawberry short cake. My advice, stick with the cheesecake. The shortcake itself was dense and tasted as though it was fried. I was looking forward to something light and refreshing and it was the opposite. Very disappointed.  Ambiance:  always extremely busy on a Friday night. Wait wasn't too long though."
Matt W.,"Prattville, AL",5,20,5,2.0,8/23/2014,"I visited this location on a Saturday.  After barely surviving Dante's parking lot with my sanity intact, the wait was shorter than it looked. The hostess seated us - with an attitude and expression usually reserved for certain biblical plagues - at a tiny table  practically jammed flush with two other tables. I was almost touching the people next to me on either side. It was awkward, uncomfortable and I felt showed a contempt for the customer.  The food was average and overpriced. I've had better hamburgers at burger king, and almost all of what I saw on their phonebook sized menu read like the Stouffer's section at your local grocery.  If you're in an indecisive party of shopping-fueled masochists, this place has a little bit of every cuisine known to humanity. If you're looking for a comfortable place to enjoy some good food and a relatively private conversation, look elsewhere."
Sasha V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4,56,111,1.0,9/30/2015,"No! Skip it, nothing but slow service, slow food, and rude management. If you want corporate, crap food, then sure go here."
Cat A.,"Birmingham, AL",0,99,10,2.0,12/12/2015,"Everyone knows the factory had a huge menu. After much debate I decided to try the seared turns steak. Big mistake. The tuna was cooked all the way through (usually served seared and very rare), and was dry and fishy tasting. The rest of the dishes were ok but not worth the hype this chain receives. I was very disappointed and haven't been back. There are so many other better restaurants in the area in the same price range id rather spend the money on."
Wanda T.,"Fremont, CA",0,37,2,5.0,3/11/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice choice for me.  The food is delicious, portions are generous, & the prices are reasonable.  Thanks to the 'water lady' & the server Cameron for their professional, friendly, & kind service."
Janeka M.,"Birmingham, AL",9,22,69,5.0,8/18/2014,"Yesterday I tried something different from The Cheesecake Factory..... YeS!!! Bang Bang Chicken &Shrimp!!!! I always have a great experience here. The staff is very professional, not a long wait, and the food is always hot. Something I really love about this place is how the food is presented. It's a work of ART! :)"
Tom W.,"Birmingham, AL",4,8,,3.0,7/25/2015,"Don't ever attempt to call a to go order in on a weekend. You'll get put on hold and sent to a phone that no one ever answers. I was on hold tonight twice for 15 minutes each time and I only waited that long the second time because it was almost comical at that point. This isn't the first time this has happened, either. I'll give them three stars because the food is decent and the cheesecake is good but it always seems like they are understaffed and the service suffers."
Kyler R.,"Portland, OR",1,52,3,4.0,7/24/2015,I had an awful experiment with my to go meal but they manager assured me he would take care of everything he offered to remake the food (which I declined) and gave me a refund he even through in a free slice of cheesecake for all my trouble.
Sneha P.,"Dallas, TX",59,180,250,4.0,10/22/2012,"Great cheesecake, average food. Salads are great.  Prefer just for dessert"
Corey W.,"Honolulu, HI",71,225,41,3.0,9/24/2013,"It is a big chain and for some reason they think they need an even bigger menu to match. This become a blessing and a curse. If you were to try to read all the items in the menu without already have some familiarity with it, you would spend about 30min before you would order anything. It is literally as long as a magazine and it even has advertisement pages in it. REALLY? in a menu that is already god awfully long? The blessing comes from the fact that if you can read the the entire monstrosity you are bound to find something that fits your food preference. I actually am a big fan of their skinnylicous menu as a semi healthy route to go in a place that normally gives you a 3,000 calorie meal. First, could they come up with a slightly less feminine name? A 5'11"" 200 pound, dude feels weird choosing something attached to the adjective skinnylicous. It makes me need to order a beer to compensate, which defeats the purpose of order off that menu section in the first place. Second, it adds 2+ pages to a menu that already exceeds 12 pages. I feel like I am back in college studying for a final ever time I try to tackle this menu."
Linda M.,"Noblesville, IN",15,373,239,3.0,3/30/2013,"The food was okay but the service could have been much better.  So I am giving it a ""ok"" rating. The waiter was managing three tables of different parties at the same time.  No joke.  I have never had a waiter who was telling us ALL that the bread would be coming soon.   Also, the waiter told us the specials.  I asked about the salmon special.  Then he showed me the salmon listings.  I asked about the special pricing.  There was none.  So I said, there is really not a special on the salmon, just the everyday fresh salmon that they normally have.   The complementary bread was good.  My sister ordered the fried cheese appetizer; it was cut into triangles - how unique -- it tasted fine. I ordered the firecracker salmon wrap for $1 more than the low-calorie salmon wrap. The low-calorie salmon wrap was noted as using butter or cream.  I was confused as to how this low-calorie wrap could be healthier than the other wrap.  I asked the waiter what is the difference between the two.  He said the firecracker wrap was bigger.  I did not feel like he had a good answer.  My dishes was loaded with lettuce garnish. The caramel pecan turtle cheesecake was to go as I cannot eat it all in one setting.  I little bit can go a long way.  It was fine.  I could not tell there is pecan.  The chocolate flower and whipped cream stole the show.  I can live without it."
Christi F.,"Hazel Green, AL",0,10,,3.0,8/20/2015,"We stopped in for lunch. This is the second experience I've had at the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a Burger, I was ok, definitely not the best and I wouldn't order it again. The cheesecake was fantastic, we got the Mocha and the 30th Anniversary.....both were FANTASTIC!"
Tim G.,"Birmingham, AL",0,3,,1.0,6/4/2016,"Horrible service every time we have come here. The kids like the food, but holy cow is it over-priced for what you get... and the service is consistently horrible - from waiters who stare you down if you ask them to, you know, serve you to mercurial space cadet servers. In fact, I am writing this review as I sit here at the Cheesecake Factory (hopefully for the last time) waiting for our server to bring out the complimentary bread after the 5th request!"
Rod L.,"Birmingham, AL",22,24,42,3.0,3/1/2015,"I used to say ""I've never had a bad meal"" here, but just had my second. Maybe a Cuban is not the best selection, but at $12.95 it should be a solId offering.  It was served warm, but the bread was over cooked and black in parts, which means it should never have been served. Inside it was just ok and fairly bland... It was missing some spark of favor or life to it. When you wait 40-45 minutes for a table shouldn't you expect more? And to top it off... And perhaps the worst part... They ran out of ORIGINAL CHEESECAKE!!! How does this happen at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Extraordinarily poor planning... They had some but it was frozen solid, meaning they just forgot to put some in the right cooler in time. It was a disappointing dinner for four, and at $82+ tip, there are plenty of other choices around town."
