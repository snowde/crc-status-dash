Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,301,594,4.0,11/27/2017,"Most of you know what the deal is with Cheesecake Factory. My visit to this particular location was an enjoyable experience. Waiter was friendly, brought over water and bread rather quickly.  I ordered Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. Not sure who Sheila is, but nevertheless, it was a good salad. Avocado was fresh, and there was plenty of chicken. They put the right amount of dressing on. Not too much, and not too little. Also tried a Vietnamese shrimp summer roll.It went well with the peanut sauce. Although I enjoy checking out local establishments, Cheesecake Factory is good once in awhile. There is something for everyone."
Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",66,57,22,2.0,12/23/2017,"I was disappointed with my last experience at this restaurant. I came in a group of 8 and was excited for my usual order of spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It was a huge portion and was piping hot. I love it! Other people ordered the shepherd's pie, the spicy crispy chicken burger, pizza and the chicken mango and avocado salad. All of them were quite satisfied with our meals.  We had one big problem with one of the meals and with the manager, Wyatt. My aunt ordered a burger and when it came out, it was cold and she found it to be very small. When she asked the waiter, he acknowledged that it was abnormally small. The manager came over and was very condescending but eventually said they would make her another burger that would come right away. 40 minutes later, we were all done our meals and the burger was nowhere to be found. Finally, when it did come, it was completely raw. The manager again took no responsibility and corrected my aunt when she asked why it took 40 minutes by saying ""actually it's been 33"". Eventually, they did end up offering her a free meal to go. It was just unfortunate that she couldn't enjoy her meal with everyone.  Overall, I think the restaurant is a good option for families and it offers a variety of different options, all of which are quite good. Our waiter was friendly and the cheesecake is delish! If it weren't for the negative experience with the management, I would probably give a 4 star review. Value: 4/5 Service: 1/5 Food: 3/5"
SW B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,15,6,2.0,12/12/2017,"Let's see.. the entrées were good, but here's where they could use some improvement: We were given filthy silverware (dried food on quite a few utensils) and water glasses. The waiter said not a word about it; he just grabbed the dirty ones and replaced them, as if he was saying, ""Don't look at me. Direct your complaints to the dishwasher!"" You'll need to wear a sweater or jacket, because most nights, it's freezing, and people at neighboring tables start conversations with one another about how cold it is. Everyone complained, but it was still cold when I left. I ordered a cold drink when I sat down, but after a few minutes, I realized I would have been better off asking for a blanket and some hot cocoa.  Don't waste your money on the crab dip appetizer, unless you enjoy eating it with bread that's been toasted to a black crisp.  Our waiter didn't care much about our concerns.. it's a busy chain restaurant, what's one customer lost to him?"
Zoe S.,"Wellington, FL",23,163,229,5.0,1/3/2018,"Delicious! Everything here is amazing. Chicken lettuce wraps are one of my favorites. We have been sharing chicken sliders app along with the BEST LEMON DROP MARTINI ever! My daughter got the corn dog kids meal and she was happy with it- comes with choices one of which is fruit and she loves fruit. Service is always pretty on point. Food came out fast too. Place is pretty clean for all the traction it gets. Cheesecake options are superb. We love the Pumpkin Cheesecake this time of year. We have had the Peanut Butter cheesecake, raspberry, lemon, Oreo - all are amazing. Highly recommend."
Layton M.,"Delray Beach, FL",150,78,219,3.0,10/19/2017,Cheesecake Factory what can I say.  Never really have a bad experience here just never really have a great experience unless I'm willing to eat the current date in calories and sodium.  Super large menu and variety and the food is always decent.  A little pricey for the product though. I definitely feel if swaying in the direction of olive garden and becoming less of a nice place to go out to eat.  I usually get the meatloaf but all of the more popular items on the menu are pretty good albeit a little salty.  Cheesecake has always been my highlight here though and can say with confidence that the banana cream is outstanding!   Service is always great here and food always comes out quick.  Not a bad place to eat but the area you're in vs price you're gonna pay there's definitely a couple better options out there for you.
Kelsey B.,"Boca Raton, FL",75,32,99,4.0,10/17/2017,"My boyfriend and i have been here a bunch of times and always leave full and happy. Last night was no different. our waiter was great, food came out quickly, and the cheesecake was delicious as usual. When we entered the restaurant we waited at the host stand for a few minutes, i think that there was only 1 hostess working. we walked over to look at the cheesecakes while we waited for her to return. when she finally got back she seemed too preoccupied flirting with a coworker to realize that we had walked up to the host stand. she made eye contact with me a couple times before breaking conversation with him to ask me how many we were going to be. we finally sat and were promptly greeted by our server. we were hungry so we put in for appetizers right away and he brought back over a basket of bread within 1 minute. he answered all of our questions and made really great suggestions. unfortunately they took the beef dip sandwich that my boyfriend LOVES off of the menu, but our server was quick to offer other suggestions and seemed very knowledgeable about each menu item. The food was full of flavor as usual. we started with the chicken taquitos which are served with a salsa verde sauce. we also had the fried macaroni and cheese, which are 4 balls of mac and cheese served over some type of red sauce. both appetizers were delicious! for our meals, i got the shrimp and sausage pasta and my boyfriend had the meatloaf. both meals were very filling and tasted great. my rigatoni seemed very slightly undercooked but it was still very delicious and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. the meatloaf was served with mashed potatoes with gravy and succotash which my boyfriend said was all really great together. we finished up our meal with the banana cream cheesecake, it was served with mounds of whip cream and fresh banana! it was a great final touch.  overall we love the food here  and the service is almost always above par. although it is a chain corporate restaurant, we sometimes choose to eat here over some other local stops."
Mel H.,"Tampa, FL",0,20,201,1.0,1/4/2018,When you're sat next to a party of 7 and the seat is on the end. You cannot even sit down they had to move the table out for you to sit down that's a fire hazard. If you have 7 people they should be at a space for 8 people. A child couldn't even get through this space let alone an adult. By far the worse experience ever. Just what I wanted to have a nice dinner with someone's hair being flipped back and forth and her backside next to our table.
Betsy S.,"Delray Beach, FL",814,248,1405,2.0,11/6/2017,"I've been there several times (don't really love it) and went there for dinner. It was a terrible meal for the 6 of us. We had to wait 15 minutes to get our waters. Over 24 for me to get decaf coffee (they said it takes 6 minutes to brew a new pot...hmmm). I was very  unhappy . It took 40 minutes for all of our food to arrive. And my food when it arrived was cold. I ordered Hibachi steak (i usually get it medium) but Audrey (waitress) said medium is pink here. So she suggested medium well, to only have a little pink. Well, it basically was inedible. But by the time it arrived, I was starving (they did give me a salad on them but it was just unacceptable). Two other people at the table ordered pasta napoletana and did not like it at all. The crispy pineapple chicken was ok and the kids pasta was fine (I mean what can you do to kids pasta...). Not sure I'll be returning."
MJ H.,"Delray Beach, FL",49,45,302,4.0,11/22/2017,Sunday brunch is the best! Had the monte cristo - came with a side of breakfast potatoes that were cut up small and crispy! My son had the kids pancakes with bacon and fruit - huge portion!!! And they added whipped cream for him! The only bad thing is that brunch is only on Sunday's!  Today's brunch not so great... Had the waffle with strawberries and cream (see picture) maybe 2 strawberries on it and no cream to speak of...
Dale F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",200,155,505,5.0,10/2/2017,"Been to this restaurant many times and rarely leave disappointed. They have a very large menu with so many different choices. This time I went for lunch and I started with a bowl of their New England clam chowder it was delicious and full of clams. For my entree I had the grilled steak medallions cooked medium rare and season perfectly and tender, it came with shitake mushrooms, fresh asparagus, sauteed cherry tomatoes ,crusted croutons, mashed potatoes and covered with Madeira wine sauce. The waitress was very attentive. Also the restaurant and the restrooms were very clean. The cheesecakes are to die for with so many different varieties you're sure to find one you like. If you go for lunch or dinner try to get there before the rush hours because this place is always busy but worth the wait."
Melissa R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,9,2,2.0,1/7/2018,Food was good but took over an hour and then came luke warm. People came in after us and left before us... currently waiting over 20 minutes for him to return our check. I will definitely not be returning. Wasted my Sunday afternoon here
Bianca D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1282,20,268,5.0,12/31/2017,"We've eaten at several places in Florida visiting from Vegas and the service has been terrible however we came to cheesecake factory on a whim had a server Named Jay. Jay was incredible, really on top of things the best server we've had in Florida!!!! The food was ok but the pleasantness of jay made the overall experience definitely worth it!!!"
Alana E.,"Boynton Beach, FL",109,110,35,5.0,11/22/2017,High five! Much better than gardens. The Mexican tortilla salad is so good! And the service and cleanliness top-notch. Had a great time celebrating my birthday here! Thank you cheesecake factory!!!
Marisol F.,"Boca Raton, FL",227,224,118,3.0,11/17/2017,"Everyone knows Cheesecake Factory and i think everyone knows the menu is really really big.  I remember the first time we came here and I was so mixed up.  How can you pick just one dish when the menu is more like a book but then again it is so easy to bring a big group since you can be sure they have something for everyone.   Of course they have cheesecake and a lot of flavors to choose from, but I don't really like cheesecake. As far as the food goes I have tried many dishes over the years but I think my favorite thing to get here is still just trying out all their salads.  All the dinners are huge portions so I feel icky when I get one and finish eating so at least if i get a salad I can overeat and not feel like a pig since it's just a salad. And the salads are always really good. We also used to get take out from here about 2 or 3 times every week but then the serving sizes got smaller. So we stopped but that was a long time ago."
Nicole Marie C.,"Coconut Creek, FL",2,26,30,5.0,9/24/2017,Had the lasagna verde out their new try out menu and its really good! Have been twice to eat it already. The cheesecakes of course are amazing but all the ones that have lemon are my favorite. I have a list of everything i love: - chicken romano - mozz bread sticks - factory nachos - frozen mango drink - tamale cakes  - mac n cheese balls - pizza - flatbread -lemoncello cake - oreo shake And manyyy moreee!!!
Justin I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",330,110,129,5.0,1/4/2017,"Had a great meal here the other day! Service was prompt and amazing! Not often do you get a server who's so friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. You can tell she enjoys her job! The Egg roll sampler was delicious! Each roll (Salmon, Southwest, Cuban and Avocado) paired well with their respective dipping sauces. As for entrees, the Chicken Madeira, Miso Salmon and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta were all tasty and were large portions. They advertise the Jambalaya to be very very spicy however this version wasn't too spicy. Finished the meal with Strawberry, Godiva Chocolate and Vanilla Bean Cheesecakes. I've never not had an amazing slice at the Cheesecake Factory. When it comes to cheesecake they are the standard bearer in my book! Will be back! ** During the winter season the place gets packed every evening but once the snowbirds go back North it dies down. Had we come later and had to endure the long wait I may have dropped a star. And just an FYI, the place is pretty chilly inside so maybe bring a sweater."
Taja S.,"Tampa, FL",72,59,247,3.0,8/10/2017,"I came here for a post-graduation celebration lunch, and while I'm typically a big Cheesecake Factory fan, I wasn't impressed with my experience at this location unfortunately. The food was ok but more mediocre than I've had at other Cheesecake Factories. I ordered two apps, the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks, and the tuna tartare. The grilled cheese sticks sounded better and more exotic than they actually tasted, and by the time they got out to me, they were lukewarm and all that melty cheese had started solidifying (which I don't like, texturally speaking), so I didn't enjoy that very much. The tuna tartare tasted amazing, with a soy ginger sauce, avocado, picked ginger, and sesame seeds - but what I didn't care for was that the tuna was like minced or something, almost like ground meat. It tasted good, but the texture was weird eating it like that - I'm used to ahi tuna being served sliced, so I just thought that was a weird culinary choice. I also ordered their new coffee and cream cheesecake - again, sounded amazing on the menu but just tasted very average and not all it was hyped up to be. It's cheesecake, so of course it was still good to me - just nothing special. Besides the just-ok food, the service was what was really lackluster. Granted, the nearby FAU graduation ceremonies had just finished, so I know they were pretty packed and busy. But they were also aware that this event was happening (based on me calling the night before for a reservation and the hostess mentioning it!), and imo should have staffed themselves properly to accommodate that volume. Because what resulted was us having a waiter who seemed like they could barely be bothered with our table - on the rare occasions we were able to get his attention to help us, his demeanor and communications with us felt extremely rushed and borderline annoyed. It was uncomfortable to say the least, and upsetting to be more accurate! Given the average food and the awkward service experience, I still consider myself a Cheesecake Factory fan - but I wouldn't come back to this location, personally!"
Lloyd B.,"Boca Raton, FL",32,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"I never had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory until now. Me and my wife came in to have a nice dinner and to have what we always order, but our frozen drinks that we ordered came out Fresh didn't taste like what we always get. We told the waiter and he's telling us that's how it comes. We tell him No that's not the taste that we are use to. After that our food came out and my Orange Chicken and Tuna meal came out warm and I still didn't get my drink. So I cancel my drink order and took a food to go. Plz do better next time Mr Waiter. Joshua B"
Cindy N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",54,103,342,2.0,5/5/2017,"Two stars for the food purely not the service! I have never been to a restaurant where I couldn't find one thing to eat until I came here. There are a lot of things on the menu, but when you look at the price next to the calories (1000-3000 cal), things start to look less appealing. We started off with the soup of the day which was clam chowder. The chowder was decent to eat. Not the best one, but not the worst either. I choose the  chicken pot pie and it was a puff pastry sitting on top of a stew like creamy soup. Some parts of the bowl was lukewarm and some parts here boiling hot which makes me think of microwaved food. When I tasted the soup, it was bland. I've had better chicken pot pie from sweet tomato . Luckily we had a gift card (only reason we even went) . The cheese cake is very delicious and that I will give them. Just overall a waste of money if it was my own"
Rosa A.,"Miami, FL",43,2,,3.0,12/17/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory and the good was pretty good today but the bathrooms are disgusting. I know that cleaning bathrooms is not everyone's favorite cup of tea but if I were a restaurant manager, i would make sure that the bathrooms are clean.  There was paper overflowing every where."
Carrie I.,"Jacksonville, FL",37,1,,1.0,10/26/2017,The most horrible experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory Arrived at 7 pm didn't receive food until 9 pm. Drinks had no ice. The waitress never once apologized for the long wait never refilled the drinks and seemed super overwhelmed. I work in customer service so rarely do I complain
Jim P.,"Boynton Beach, FL",20,56,,5.0,9/24/2017,"It doesn't get any better. I had the chicken marsala, it was the best I ever had. The chicken was tender and the bow tie noodles were the way I like them. The sauce was to die for. My wife had the chicken parm. It came in the form of a pizza. She loved it. My buddy had a huge cob salad. We all took a doggie bag home. People might think it's expensive, but you get two meals out of it. Well worth it. We shall return."
Sam M.,"Boca Raton, FL",480,271,2416,4.0,2/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one the few restaurants that you apparently find in every major mall across the country yet surprisingly I have not gotten around to reviewing it till today. This particular location is a stone's throw distance from the Grand lux in Boca which is there sister restaurant. The food at cheesecake is pretty good but the cheesecake slices of different varieties is what sets this chain apart. They have 2 full menu pages of different kinds of Cheesecakes which I am still working my way through. If you are a chocoholic I would recommend going to Cheesecake on a regular basis because they have all kinds of Chocolate flavored cheesecakes. Getting back to the food, Cheesecake has a menu the size of a story book so you can pretty much imagine a dish and chances are they will have it on the menu. And every entree is usually to much to begin with so if you want to keep a spot for desserts I would recommend getting one of the small plates. My personal favorite at cheesecake is the four cheese pasta but the fish tacos are equally good. The service is usually pretty good but they are very busy at peak lunch and dinner hours so I would recommend getting here a little bit early so that you can enjoy your meal and if you don't have space I would take the cheesecake to go!!!!!!"
Vivi T.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,67,196,3.0,3/13/2017,"It's your typical Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge. There's something for everyone here. I ordered the Cajun Pasta and was a little disappointed. It came out dry. I asked the waiter for extra pasta sauce and by the time it came out, hubby was already done with his food and my pasta was cold. So I just packed everything up and ate it at home.  Hubby was happy with his food. We also got a slice of cheesecake to celebrate my birthday. Cheesecake is always good there. The service was okay. It was a slow night and the waiter was kinda slow and not very polite. Not terrible, but not the best. Anyways, we come to Cheesecake like once a year. It is what it is."
Toni Kalispera K.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,58,138,4.0,9/15/2017,"I have been coming to this location for over a decade now, and I have always had a wonderful meal.  They are always packed. The menu is huge.  So many choices and healthy vegan options. Being a pescatarian for a couple of years now, the waitstaff is always accommodating to my needs. Love their warm whole wheat/ honey bread. Potions are incredibly large. I often take my meal home. The servers, Carlos, Princess, Christina, Samuel and a few others, I have forgotten, have always been friendly and knowledgeable.  Leave room for dessert, endless choices! Coffee is certified organic, fair-trade. Plenty of parking."
Usavadee G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",42,45,766,3.0,8/22/2017,I used to love Cheesecake Factory.  I been to the one on las olas and this one.   I used to love service. Food and all dessert.   I love strawberry short cake. They used to use fresh fruit .  I stop to go Cheesecake Factory awhile because I so busy.  Today I stop by and order food and dessert that I used to love so very much but I so disappointed.  Food is so sweet by the way I order spicy noodles and strawberry short cake.less quality and quantity. Sure I won't be back  service still great
Cristina S.,"Miami, FL",4,50,67,5.0,8/12/2017,"Every Cheesecake Factory I go, it is insanely busy;  I immediately get stressed and what you would call HANGRY! BUT, cheesecake on Glades Rd was a dream. We immediately had a table, and were pleasantly greeted. It was not too loud and our server was wonderful with quick service and helping me choose from the enormous menu. Everything from this restaurant is delicious, from starters to dessert, no wonder I have trouble picking what to eat! Whatever you may choose, you will definitely have leftovers for the following day."
Kaitlin M.,"Lantana, FL",56,4,,5.0,11/17/2017,"Thank you Jason for taking care of our party last night! Our food was so good best eggplant parm I have had in a long time! If anyone has not tried the avacado egg rolls your life is not complete! We were very impressed, great experience!"
Jason C.,"Lake Worth, FL",626,9,4,3.0,10/27/2017,"Really tailspinning. Needs a revamping. Special note; if you order a burger, just order the classic with addons, it is twice the size of the 'specialty' burgers."
Todd R.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,5,2,1.0,5/21/2017,"50 minutes to get food with no appetizers brought food out 1 dish at a time for 5 people. A dish would arrive and 7 minutes later another dish would come no one wanted to eat till all dish's arrived, any way every dish is now cold. Management made no attempt to correct anything, What an embarrassment the cheesecake factory made me feel as I suggested this restaurant over others and dragged my family there assuring them that this would never happen. They use to have real mangers working here and properly trained staff. WILL NOT BE RETURNING"
Sara T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,4,2,5.0,2/18/2017,Yum yum. Just had the avocado toast! Way more delish than I expected :) Nancy was our server and lovely.  (Martinis are on the weaker side)
Karesha M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,,1.0,6/17/2017,Wayne was our server horrible service.   1 . never introduced himself to use  2. never checked once to see how the food was how we were doing  3. never offered extra napkins utensils (16) people dining.  4. Threw change down on the table behind us along with our card at the end of service  5. was short when providing additional utensils  6. rude . worse service ever at a cheesecake factory.  I wish I could go back and take my tip. I will definitely not be back. wish I could give this place zero stars
Danielle J.,"Aventura, FL",186,65,42,2.0,4/30/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I go here very often but this time I had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. i went to cheesecake and accompanied by two co workers. Our waiter was ""Cody S.""  First, the waiter took around 20 minutes to come take our order. When bringing water, he put the dirty try on the table and yelled over to the bus boy to get us some bread.   When the food arrived, he tried filling up our water cups and spilt water all over the table. At the end, he came with our checks, mine being $17.07 and my co workers being the same price. I gave him a $50 and my coworker gave him a $20. The waiter asked ""how much change do you want?"" When my coworker said ""all of it?"" The waiter asked,""you want the rest of the change?"" When he came back with the change he was short $10, luckily I counted.   This experience was horrible. When I brought it up to one of the managers, Fariq? He was understanding and apologized. But, you would think he would offer some Reconciliation for the bad experience. This has caused us a delay and an awkward experience due to Cheesecakes poor  customer service.  I hope to hear from customer service and have a follow up, hoping i would have a positive attitude after."
Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914,5.0,3/2/2016,"Like it is at all other locations, Cheesecake Factory is one of the best chains out there, and this one is no different. I have literally never been to this location of Cheesecake Factory and not had to wait. Lunch, dinner, late night, in-season, out of season; it doesn't matter, it's permanently packed here. Come expecting to hang out for a little bit before you get seated, because it can take a long time. Atmosphere here is on par with the other locations, which is to say it's very nice. I find the booths a bit small for four people. The floor layout is huge, and they do everything they can to cram as many people as possible in. Everything here is big, including the parking lot outside. While this place is often crowded, they have a massive parking lot; and even though it's right next to mall, their is plenty of spots. I've never really gotten anything here I don't enjoy here, all the food is great. Portion size is quite big, and plenty usually to take home for later. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta is totally fantastic, and must try. Chicken Picatta is also a favorite of mine. The cheesecakes are also a must, despite their price. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake is my favorite for what it's worth. The only real pitfall to Cheesecake Factory are the prices, which are very high, nothing here is cheap. On the other hand, you're getting quality, so can you really complain? Food (A-), Pricing (C+), Atmosphere (B+), Service (B)"
Beaumont J.,"Spartanburg, SC",0,63,,3.0,10/15/2017,Not sure why but they sat us two feet from another table and the restaurant was 20% occupied. Guess they thought we were communal people. Ordered French toast and green chilequenos pork w egg dish. French toast was good - the green chili dish was dry and bland. Ordered baked potato tots and they were excellent. Food to table time was very slow - almost 40 minutes.
Raissa S.,"Boca Raton, FL",489,41,112,4.0,5/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory- it's been around for quite a while now. I remember being in school and everyone would be having their birthday dinners there. This location has been around for a while and growing up I've heard good things and bad things. I've heard ""cockroach in my food"" once and I've heard the ""love the food, hate the service""   The food is definitely where it's at with this place in my opinion. They have a HUGE menu with a variety of things! It's almost too hard to choose! I've also never seen such a huge dessert menu too! All different crazy kinds of cheesecakes. I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory about 2 or 3 times. This last Wednesday was my best experience. Our server was super cool and he was attentive for the most part. They must have a lot of side work, or more work to do or something because every time I come to the Cheesecake Factory there's always a holdup. Whether its the server not being attentive or the order being wrong, there's always something. This time it was the kids menu, they took forever to give us a kids menu. It wasn't super busy but definitely steady. We had to ask about 3 times before actually getting a kids menu so everyone could put their orders in. The place has stepped up. It's a lot cleaner and the food got better. The service still needs a little work, until then the food is worth the slow service.  So far, my favorite dish has been the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The Godiva triple chocolate cheesecake is amazing!!  I want to go back just for the cheesecake! I have a big sweet tooth and my love for chocolate and delicious desserts is never ending. So I'll be returning to try more cheesecakes!"
Alexandra M.,"New York, NY",163,24,29,4.0,10/14/2017,I looooovvvveee the Cheesecake Factory. I always get the jambalaya but this time I got the Cajun chicken pasta. It was def not as good as the jambalaya and kinda lacked some seasoning. But otherwise it was a great atmosphere for dinner with friends. The service was great!
Cassy J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,49,120,4.0,3/4/2017,"Came here last Thursday after work got their before 8 and itwas really busy but we were able to be seated in about 10 mins service was prompt and attentive I got the cuban eggrolls they were pretty good,but for my entree I got the pineapple chicken & shrimp and it was so very good, flavorful and a hefty portion will definetly be returning."
Tara J.,"Boca Raton, FL",42,39,21,4.0,10/11/2016,"Decent food, great for brunch/lunch! They have really big portions ( at least for me ) so if you have a small appetite I suggest sharing with friends."
Tetiana G.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,15,11,3.0,5/26/2017,"Me and my friend came to have a few appetizers and desserts. Food was great. Can't complain about that. However can't tell the same about customer service.  Server won't refill water even he was refilling the table right next to us.  And it's all because we didn't order much?  I'm sorry but it's ridiculous, because no matter how big my order is I would still leave a great tip for a good customer service.  So please take a good care of customers no matter how big is their order and their age.  I've been in a customer service for years and the most important thing is to treat people the same way you would want to be treated."
