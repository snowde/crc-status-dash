Ashley H.,"Tampa, FL",338,317,307,3.0,7/8/2012,"I've only been there once, and I will probably come back again. Just felt like I was a bit overwhelmed with the atmosphere of this place which I could literally NOT stop looking around the murals and mosaic on the walls and everything else! The food was amazing and we didn't get dessert.... even though we were in a CHEESECAKE heaven. But next time, I will!  Since this is in Boca and right next to the Town Center Mall... I kind of feel underdressed coming out to this side of town cause a lot of the people, especially women, seem to be brash with their own thing. But whatever, if you have a bunch of great people with you- it won't matter."
Lauran C.,"Miami, FL",18,17,3,3.0,7/18/2012,"I would have liked to include a photo here but the website of this chain doesn't avail you of many - except for cheesecakes. I'm into food, not desserts, and I definitely haven't been to that place for dessert - so here goes. I was freaked out by the Cheesecake Factory in Houston many years ago and didn't return. For some reason I ventured into their Boca Raton location some time ago. (The reason for the freak out? The Houston locataion was playing opera music, which I TOTALLY detest. And they were quite unapologetic/accomodating about it. So I steered clear for many years.) Moving on - the Boca Raton location has been a wonderful find for me. Not only do I like their food but the decor is magical. See their website for more details - but basically, art deco, wonderful. Their Boca location is also huge, and most often very full! Quite a feat to pull off. Last Sunday I visited and got my usual - a massive Cobb Salad that really would be big enough for two meals, but it's so delicious I always finish it (and don't eat dinner). Accompanied by a Blue Moon and warm brown bread - delicious. This time around I noticed a lot of things on the menu I'd definitely like to try, like three types of cooked salmon in one dish! In fact the menu is so eclectic I thought it might be a good place to take a date to, despite the fact that because of it's vastness I'd more considered the Cheesecake Factory of more a cafe type place. But that kind of menu can inspire some serious eating. I should have asked if they have a wine list. I guess so. Lastly they played very muted jazz music - wonderful! Definitely a place I like returning to."
Kayla W.,"Boca Raton, FL",71,55,81,4.0,2/28/2014,"Hmmm where do I start?!?!? They have a huge variety of food choices to choose from like 15-16 pages! They have an amazing fried zucchini with ranch dressing..... Which if I might say so is heavenly... Lol!!!! Tonight I ordered off the""skinny menu"" trying to watch my calories of course and i got the beef tips with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus, and mushrooms. Can you say delicious? Lol you wouldn't know it was a healthier choice since it tasted so good I finished my entire plate. They have yummy alcoholic drinks I had a tropical martini that'l was so good. Now I'm not a huge cheese cake lover (I know who goes to the Cheesecake Factory if u don't like cheesecake?!?!) well I've tried a few, but my favorite is the Godiva chocolate  cheesecake.... Can I just say that it is heavenly? My other favorite one is their pumpkin cheesecake but you can only get that in the fall :( so sad!!!! I've tried many foods here and have enjoyed each and every single one.... This is a place for the pickiest eater since they have so many choices to eat from! Pricing is decent can be high but the amount of food you get it is totally worth it!"
Briana E.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,11,,4.0,11/18/2015,Food is always great! The only problem was the service sucked! And the wait time is ridiculous.
Justin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,635,351,3.0,2/18/2011,Huge plates !!!   The Factory makes everybody happy.  My go to meal here is Chicken and Biscuits add Biscuit / have them grill chicken. This is also combined with a Mai Tai and followed up with the Best Godiva Cheesecake in town ! Enjoy.
Jocelyn M.,"Tampa, FL",1,10,2,2.0,5/18/2014,I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 out of the goodness of my heart. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but this location is awful. Worst I've ever been too. Service is horribly slow and I've found foreign objects In my food on 2 separate occasions.
Rob Y.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",663,17,1,3.0,4/17/2014,It's ok. I've always liked CF just not the wait.
Cee G.,"Weston, FL",0,63,12,2.0,2/25/2015,"This location sucks. The one in Pembroke Pines, Sunrise, & out of state locations that I've been to are MUCH better. I've been to this location multiple times and every single time our waiter is missing in action, nowhere to be found, never good service, have had our food delivered to the wrong table after waiting an hour TWICE. What restaurant does that twice in a row? This one does. The only thing good is the cheesecake, but it's not worth everything else you'll have to endure. I wouldn't recommend the Boca location. One manager is nice, the other is rude. But it's Boca, did I really expect someone in Boca to be nice? not really. Next."
Rachel S.,"East Meadow, NY",743,832,2223,3.0,9/11/2011,Standard food. Poor service. Server placed appetizer dish on top of the butter plate knocking the butter packets all onto the table and just walked away. They forgot my dressing on the side and served my dates salad with tomatoes even though be specifically requested none. They didn't offer fresh ground pepper to me after grinding some for him.  I still gave it 3 stars because the food arrived quickly.
T W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,18,,2.0,8/23/2014,"Why do decent restaurants always seem to go downhill after a spell?!? Food was Okay.... quality definitely not match price. Entree of $19.95 of $8.95 quality. I ordered the 'premium' margarita and it was served in a tall thin glass with waaay too much ice. Could not taste any tequila. Stupidly, I asked for a second (with tequila, this time!) and it was the same as the first. When we received the bill each margarita was $14 !!! That is $28 for some syrup and ice.... not much tequila, if any. So for two people it ran $100, which I don't mind if the value is there. It wasn't! I will not be returning. (The two star rating is taking into account their desserts and decor. 0 stars for food and value.)"
Pete A.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,,1.0,8/1/2015,Took forever for them to bring food. Waited for more than an hour. Asked for mustard which arrived after the food was almost over. Bland food.
Lene K.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,38,,2.0,8/16/2012,"No standardization here.  We both ordered the Cobb Salad with dressing on the side.  The two salads looked different when placed infront of us.  My friend's portion was larger and encircled by crumbled bits of cheese.  The smaller salad placed infront of me did not appear to have cheese and looked wet.   I assumed the cheese was underneath and the wetness was probably the dressing which I had requested be on the side.  Wrong on both counts.  There was no cheese and there was no dressing on the salad or on the side.  The wetness was wilted salad.  I gaged trying to eat it.  I kept thinking they took someone's leftover salad and served it to me. I'm grossed out  just thinking about it.  I normally get the Carlton salad, so at the time I didn't realize my Cobb salad was also missing the chicken.   I'll need time to forget that salad before I can go back."
Natalie E.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1,25,16,2.0,1/19/2014,"It all started with the hostess, my grandmother left her number with her. Hostess said the table will be ready in 20 mins. 25 mins later we walk in asking about our table and the host says they tried calling us two times. We never got a call. At that time is was my brother and grandmother an the host sat my grandmother as my grandma sat. When the rest of us came from right out side the host just smiled and the host that was seating my grandma was down the hall holding hands with somebody else. Needless to say we found our own way to the table with grandma flagging us down. But this isn't the worst part.  Food was as usual, great, as all the cheesecake factories. Food was not the issue; the waitress was, terrible service! We sat down after a 30 min wait and got bombarded with what drink we wanted. (As if she was a drill Sargent, ok you! Now you! Next) we asked her if she was in a hurry and she stated that she has to bring one table drinks and cater another. (Not that big of a deal if you ask me, 3 tables) same with meals, drill Sargent when asking. When we asked for bread for the third time we decided to ask another waitress for bread which took less than 2 mins to to receive. Thank god my brother asked to speak to the manager to inform him of his horrendous worker and he brought us a new waitress.  Our new waitress had a much better attitude, but was seen very seldom. Took 15 mins for her to come back after she gave us the check"
Greshka P.,"Boca Raton, FL",1307,858,3633,4.0,5/15/2009,"This is one of those places that you become ""obsessed"" with when you move to Florida.  At least that was the case with me, and my family and friends, maybe because we didn't have Cheesecake Factory where we lived before. This is the place you take everyone who's visiting you, for lunch or dinner and then they go back home and tell all their friends they've been to the Cheesecake Factory.  I guess the fact that they have so many types of cheesecakes is a big deal, plus they have a very extensive menu, something for everyone, so you know even the pickiest eater in your party will find something here. After living in FL for almost 11 years, the novelty has passed - actually it passed years ago - and I hadn't eaten from here in a long time.  But today, for a business meeting, we ordered from here and I started remembering what I started saying here. This is still a great restaurant.  I love their Cobb Salad, it's always fresh and a very generous portion. Haven't had their cheesecake in years but still remember how yummy they are, my favorite is the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  Will have to skip dinner one day and go straight for that  :p"
Brandon F.,"Gainesville, FL",355,114,375,4.0,3/27/2011,"TIRAMISU TIRAMISU TIRAMISU!!! Their cheese cake is probably the best thing I have tasted in South Florida! I've tried the Teriyaki steak and it's pretty good, I got it Med Rare and w/ mashed potatoes.  They gave me a large portion of potatoes and I was full before I even ordered desert! They used to have really good ribs that had meat fall off the bone, but they took that  off the menu! :( Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because they took my ribs off the menu!"
Betsi K.,"Boca Raton, FL",19,93,45,4.0,1/25/2012,"You know what to expect and it always lives up to expectations... Good food and lots of it - a bit noisy but, hey - that's why you're there!"
Matt S.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,8,,5.0,10/25/2013,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory for an early lunch/brunch on Sunday. I've never in my life had better pancakes than what we had at the Cheesecake Factory. I was extremely impressed as I was not expecting an excellent breakfast dish. But it is after all the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to be great! Very impressed with the breakfast/brunch on Sundays."
Adam S.,"Coral Springs, FL",28,121,3,3.0,3/31/2013,Went here the other day with my wife and her family. The place was clean and considering we were a party of 8 we only waited about 5 min for a table. The place seemed clean and the waitress was ok but could of been better. I ordered the factory burrito which is very huge but very good. My wife and I split the red velvet cheesecake which was also good. You really can't go here and not get cheesecake to me it would be a crime not to do so lol. My wife and I were treated to the dinner so I can't say if the prices are good or not
Craig S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,3,,4.0,11/26/2014,"The hostess was pretty rude. Didn't turn around cause she was clearly in love with one of the servers that. He had to greet and sit us. Food and service was just fine, as usual. Still one of my favorite places."
H S.,"New York, NY",8,208,3,1.0,5/4/2013,Wow this place was a filthy mess last night.  Floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.   Our table looked like it gets wiped down regularly with a dirty rag ..the filth was so thick.  A busboy dropped a plate behind us and never came back to clean up the broken glass that was all over the floor.  Food was still good but if the restaurant is so dirty I worry about the kitchen.
