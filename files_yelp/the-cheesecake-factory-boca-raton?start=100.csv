Frederique P.,"Westmount, Canada",30,4,54,3.0,3/25/2016,"Awesome lettuce asian tacos!! And very cheap! Delicious cheesecakes, of course! The ambiance was ughhh."
Jason S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",388,316,93,4.0,12/17/2015,"All CFs are great. This one was even better than most...at 6pm on a Wednesday, it was very busy and a 15 min wait! Extremely large and diverse menu of everything: Appetizers, entrees, sandwiches, burgers, desserts (of course cheesecake :) ... American, Asian, Italian, French and other cuisine influences in all. If you like CF, definitely try this one. If you've never been to one, you're missing out!"
Angela M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",169,166,2770,3.0,10/20/2013,"My mom and i had lunch here after a nice day if shopping at the boca mall. We each ordered a lunch-sized portion of their salads- a bbq ranch chicken and the asian chicken. The veggies were fresh, dressing was pretty good as always.  The service is just OK, nothing to special (or horrible) to remember/write about. The wait for two salads was a little over 20 minutes, which was annoying considering that not too many table were occupied.  We didn't go there for the salads or service, however. They have a seasonal cheesecake flavor my mom and i LOVE! Pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake- it's amazing. A must-get while they're still around this season!"
Night Ryder I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,190,603,4.0,3/12/2016,"Trying to eat healthy,  so I went with the Cobb Salad - ginormous portion.  Was very bland though,  added honey mustard dressing to make it through half.  The macadamia nut caramel cheesecake didn't disappoint. Oh so good!"
John S.,"Boca Raton, FL",2,21,1,4.0,10/26/2016,"Great food and great service. The only complaint that I can make is that they don't have a good kids menu. Their kids pizza is pretty terrible, for example. Therfore my children don't really like going there, but when we go they still manage and share with us (pretty much any entree that we will order will be tasty and they can eat too). Beware, the portions are big and meant to be shared.  Even the calories per entree are pretty excessive so share, the portions are plentiful. The cake selection is marvelous."
Alissa F.,"Lake Worth, FL",137,3,1,1.0,3/27/2017,"Worst experience ever! We arrived to the restaurant around 6 p.m. on a Monday evening. There were not many guests there as we arrived, but as we sat, more guests filled the room. Our server didn't even tell us her name, but she was an older lady with a long blonde pony tail and glasses. She seemed to grow more and more overwhelmed. We were very patient and not in any hurry since this was our once a week date night. We got our drinks and appetizers in a timely fashion. She took a few minutes to return to take our main course order as she helped several other tables. We decided to start with a few appetizers. Before the appetizers arrived she finally took our order. We loved our appetizers but we didn't finish all of them since we were anticipating our NY strip steak and orange peel chicken entrees. She politely boxed up our appetizers and went about her business. About thirty minutes goes by before she returns to the table to explain the kitchen dropped our meals and then they had to recook the items. She did offer soup or salad while we waited, but once again we wanted to save room for our main course, declining. Another 15-20 minutes goes by before our food finally arrived to the table. Meanwhile, all the tables and guests around us had eaten their dinners, paid their bill, and left. The chicken arrived first and then the steak. The steak was ordered medium and came out almost well done. While my significant other grew very frustrated and had to leave the table, I tasted my orange peel chicken, which I always order. I love my orange peel chicken. It is always moist and juicy, but not today. It was warm at best and the rice was over cooked. As we explained to the server our food was not what we ordered, she claimed that she would go speak to the manager. When the manager arrived, I explained our situation. His response was offering a piece of cheesecake for dessert. We didn't eat our entrees, so dessert wasn't an option. As we requested our bill to leave, he explained he would take care of everything, in exception to the one margarita. We just wanted to pay for our one drink and go home. We left behind our boxed appetizers that had been sitting at the table for almost an hour. Needless to say, we left the Cheesecake Factory very hungry and disappointed. We will never return here for date night ever again."
LA C.,"Orange Park, FL",0,1,,2.0,3/25/2017,"Horrible service today.  No communication, slow service, VERY LATE FOOD...no apology,no attempt to remedy.  Server was Michael G., no hospitality whatsoever! ? Food costs too much to receive such poor service. Two stars because we have always loved food from this chain. Will avoid this location."
Susanne H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",327,345,467,4.0,8/27/2014,"For a Tuesday night it was pretty busy.  We should have asked for a booth because we were seated at a table that wasn't even a foot away from the next table.  I felt like we were having dinner with them too. The server was at our table right away and took our drink order.  She returned quickly with drinks and bread.  I ordered the avocado chicken sandwich, so good, but so messy! Our server was on the ball throughout our meal.  Good service, good meal, like most other Cheesecake Factories. Just make sure you ask for a booth on the upper level so you can enjoy your meal with just the people you came with, not the people at the next table too."
Angela Q.,"Boca Raton, FL",69,65,28,4.0,12/8/2014,This is my go to for shrimp scampi. So bad for you but so freaking good.
Rachel L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4,7,15,5.0,8/14/2016,"Whenever I'm in town I have come here! Best place for chicken, salads, pasta, and desert! Great customer service and amazing cheesecake. Love the chicken di pana and the chicken piccata! The oreo cheesecake is my favorite."
Debra M.,"Lake Worth, FL",18,1,,3.0,9/7/2016,On Tuesday me and 2 friends went to boca raton location.   I have been there so many times.  My favorite restaurant.  For my 2 friends it was there 1st time.  We ordered we all loved the food and when we got up to leave our pants where all full of  this white little pieces of lint all over our pants.  We told the waiter what is this. He laughed and said o ya we been having trouble with our napkins. He said he was going to bring something to get it off.  He never did my friends did not want to make a big deal.  Needless to say it was so bad that we had to go home to change our pants before proceeding with the rest of the day.  Please warn customers or dont use them as a precaution. I was so embarrassed. I don't know if i would recommend your restaurant again.
Jennifer R.,"Rochester, NY",8,69,19,2.0,12/7/2015,Yuck.  Not sure why people rave about this place but do NOT get the shrimp scampi.  It's disgusting .  Mine was buried in white sauce loaded with huge pieces of basil.   It was cold.  Shrimp was breaded.  It was not a typical scampi at all.  My husband got the Louisiana pasta.  Again...not good...and our waitress was coo coo birds!!   Pot stickers were good I will give them that.
Bill C.,"Batavia, OH",6,1,,1.0,1/29/2017,Went in on Saturday 1/29/17 at 2 pm for lunch with the family. Was told a twenty minute wait. After 45 minute tea asked what was the delay and was told a mistake was made and would we be getting a table right away. I can understand a mistake. Just please correct it. 15 minutes later And still no table I asked to speak to a manager. The girl walks away and doesn't return. Absolutely terrible customer service. Will never speak well of this establishment.
Manuela F.,"Boca Raton, FL",11,30,3,1.0,6/8/2016,I was forced to go here for a birthday and as a vegan the menu is beyond disappointing. I went with the veggie burger Bc I thought it was a safe choice. WRONG. Their burger is just rice or a barely looking grain mushed together. It was bland and boring and fell apart the second I picked up the burger. I waited 10 minutes to get my side of bbq sauce and fries which I ordered at the same time. Don't bother. This place is garbage like every other chain.
Marissa J.,"Hollywood, FL",33,471,1430,4.0,7/15/2016,"I order the pasta with shrimp sausage and strawberry smoothie $25.44, my friend order burger, crab cake as appetizer and chocolate cake. Service can take 20 minutes or more but our server Kristian was very professional and friendly."
Christina M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",17,16,4,5.0,8/12/2015,"Good spot for whatever the occasion. Brunch it's great on Sunday, grab a quick lunch at the bar, go there for a nice dinner, even great for parties too. The omelettes and pancakes are definitely fulfilling. The miso salmon is great for lunch, or a chicken ceaser if you're in the mood for something lighter. Chicken Madera, castellatta are great for dinner"
K L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,6,1,3.0,11/9/2016,My experience at the bar was great. Friendly bartender and my food was served quickly and exactly as I expected. I was disappointed to witness one of the servers walk by the area where food has been prepared and is waiting for the servers to deliver it and take fries off of one of the plates with his bare hands and ate them. just nasty. If you decide to eat here definitely sit where you can see the kitchen.
Nirmal P.,"London, United Kingdom",84,67,41,4.0,11/8/2015,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Great food & Cheesecakes with massive portions.   Highlights:  Amazing Cheesecake plus food is cooked right and tastes great, Huge menu selection with now great healthy options, Massive portions for the price, Fast service, Short wait, Clean with Ample parking.   Can improve:  Take reservations.   Benchmark:  They set the standard for Cheesecakes in my book and I have tried all the popular spots in New York City to compare.  Their food is good as well and extremely reasonable for the portions they provide. Dined in Aug 2015 and will return.  Def. try the chocolate mousse cheesecake."
Jim C.,"Herndon, VA",0,24,16,5.0,12/27/2014,"We had a party of 9 last night and had a great experience.  My experience has been that during the busy season it is never easy to go out with a large group of people. Too many times I've been disappointed at other restaurants and how they have handled a large group.  When we got to the restaurant we put our name on the list and we were told it would be 55 to 70 minutes. 60 minutes later they had a table. The server Carlo was knowledgeable, efficient, and accommodating.  Variety of menu items offered, drink selection, and quality were all great. From our great experience it was easy to see why they are so often on a wait when many other places around are not busy at all.  Keep up the great work, people keep coming back and you will be busy!"
C D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,20,3,1.0,5/15/2016,I'm done with the Cheesecake Factory! I ordered A beef dip it was disgusting! Don't know if it was maybe the cheese. I brought half home since I would eat for dinner. NOT! The dog got it  filled with grizzle ! Then they charged me $3 for seltzer! If I knew that I would have had water!!!  This was called a 2 cents plain & cost  2 cents what a rip off ! And please clean that discusting woman's bathroom I'll never know cuz I'm never coming back!
