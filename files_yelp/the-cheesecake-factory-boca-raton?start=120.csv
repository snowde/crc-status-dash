Joseph R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,19,1,3.0,1/18/2017,"No reservations taken, even for lrg birthday event. Very nice server but service was slow. The food runner knocked over my glass of wine n shattered on the table. No manager visible at all. Would be nice to be checked on. Forgot how big the portions are. Appetizers are not needed."
Clyde L.,"Boca Raton, FL",972,418,3790,4.0,5/22/2015,Cheesecake factory has a great happy hour with discounted drinks and appetizers. We were a little late but they let us have the cheaper price. The food and beer was delicious. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting which beer was lighter and which appetizers were the largest helpings. We had a great time.
Jorge V.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Food was terrible, overcooked and not worth the money. The bill came to over $70 for 2 people and no alcoholic drinks. The cheesecake was also bad."
Diane C.,"Boca Raton, FL",41,4,2,5.0,1/17/2016,Came in with my daughter for lunch.  Great casual environment  and turkey club sandwich was amazing.  We'll be back for Sunday brunch.
Thelma H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",40,49,106,4.0,5/19/2015,"We went in around 4:45pm & got seated immediately, the service was great and the food even better. As in any other cheese cake factory the later you go the longer you'll have to wait because by the time we left which was about 6:30 there was a line waiting to be seated.... But I'm sure it's worth the wait if you go after 5pm :)"
Kirsten Z.,"Phoenix, AZ",109,145,68,4.0,3/20/2014,"Decent Cheesecake Factory. I tried the tortilla soup that was alright, nothing special. They have recently added an extensive gluten free menu which was perfect for my celiac friend! It had pages which is super unique. The service was amazing here, they also gave my party free cheesecakes which really made my day. The food is regular Cheesecake Factory quality and has something for everyone. It always looks super busy but the wait is rarely more than 40 minutes each time I've been there."
MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,4.0,4/21/2014,"For being a chain restaurant The Cheesecake Factory rarely disappoints. The menu is huge, but we've discovered that their chicken dishes are the best.  Today we tried the meatloaf which was a bust and the Chicken Di Panna which was delicious. We shared a soup which I cannot recall the name and we could not find room for dessert. The service was friendly and the prices are decent.    There is one thing that I will never understand, why do restaurants serve warm bread with frozen butter? How can something so basic be overlooked by many restaurants not just the Cheesecake Factory. Anyhow I must say I really love their strawberry lemonade and the raspberry lemonade isn't bad either. Overall it's a safe place to eat if you don't want to be disappointed."
Courtney M.,"Tucker, GA",0,6,2,5.0,6/8/2016,Salad was so yummy. Fresh crisp veggies. The taco lettuce wraps were excellent as well. Hubby had the Mac and cheese burger and I didn't hear a word from him until it was gone so safe to say he loved it. We ordered the white chocolate cheesecake truffle for dessert and it was amazing! Definitely recommend.
Yasser A.,"Orlando, FL",186,145,194,3.0,2/8/2015,Went with a buddy late night dinner. Ordered mediera chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. Went traditional. Been to this location few times. The service is lacking severely. The food was good.  We had to wait half hour to order. disappointed in the service.
Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1210,879,2797,4.0,12/26/2013,"Food is pretty good and portion sizes are generally obscene.   There's typically a wait. Service; however, is HIT or MISS.  The desserts are to die for, their brown bread is also amazeballs.  I love their skinnylicious menu all items under 550 calories, but they only report calories...even on their website...so you can't see fat grams or sodium.  Kind of annoying, wish they would report everything in totality."
Rosa L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",283,108,722,5.0,6/2/2014,"This was a great place to take family from out of town. My daughter always enjoys their food from the kids menu. I love the Greek salad and the ahi tuna. My uncle had the meatloaf my aunt had chicken Wings we had strawberry cheesecake. My mother had the grilled salmon she was so happy. The waitress did her job well. She came to the table and asked if we need anything she kept coming by to check on us. We had an awesome time and service here and the food was great. The sauce, the ingredients, how the food was cooked was well done I would like to say ""thank you"" to the kitchen manager Oliver."
Paul D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,19,,1.0,12/18/2016,You can see from my review history a restaurant or other biz really needs to fail bad to motivate me to write negatively (see City Mattress and Boca Ale House).  Our server Tyler is exonerated because he did a great job and the issues are not his fault.  The two major complaints are how far the food has gone down hill and the seating with tables and chairs  basically on top of each other.  First the bad chow- the grande burrito is not so grande anymore as only 2/3 of the burrito wrap had filling and both ends were empty.  There was maybe a spec of chicken and the cilantro rice wasn't cooked so it was teeth breaking hard.  The shrunken portion/poorly cooked theme held true for the whole table with a couple other low lights being brown guacamole and bone dry chicken tenders.  I didn't expect much from the Cheesecake Factory in the first place but they really went out of their way to under impress.  As far as the communal seating I am not into invasion of personal space and was creeped out the whole meal by the strangers within inches of my family.   Just like the Ale House it used to be great and then the corners get cut...a shame.
Sara K.,"Boca Raton, FL",5,19,1,4.0,3/30/2016,I've been coming here for a while and it's a pretty good restaurant. I've heard a lot of bad reviews about this establishment but I've always left as a satisfied customer. The entrees are great and the cheesecake is even better.
Cole S.,"Traverse City, MI",7,42,,5.0,8/23/2015,"I was visiting Boca Raton on vacation and while I was there, I ate at the Cheesecake Factory. I had pasta witch grilled chicken, it was delicious. The server was nice and funny. He greeted us and helped us decide what we should get. The service all in all was fantastic and our food came out pretty quick. The portions are extremely large and even though it is a little pricey the Cheesecake Factory is a perfect restaurant for a special occasion.  Of course we had to get cheesecake for dessert! It tasted great and was huge! I couldn't have been happier with my experience at this location and will definitely go back the next time I'm in Boca Raton. I would highly recommend it and make sure you are ready to eat when you go there"
Daniel M.,"Gilbert, AZ",169,188,88,2.0,11/7/2014,"The staff here are perhaps the most unfriendly people I have ever met in my entire life. Unsure if there is a full moon but ownership and management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing their employees to treat their customers the way they do. We called ahead at around 9 am the morning of and asked to place a reservation for four. They told me they do not do reservations unless it's a party of six or more. Well, I asked if we will have any issues getting a table and was told we would not. So, we arrived at 6:30 and for a party for a four, needed to wait a half hour for a table. I had then walked up to the front desk and asked for a booth because of a handy cap in our party. The only reason why this place did not receive a one star review (or even none, if that was possible) was because of our server. He was very attentive, friendly and conversed with us. He was very good at his job and that is why he had saved this restaurant from what would have been a bomb of a review. Will I be back here? No. Simple as that."
Scott R.,"Boca Raton, FL",10,29,4,4.0,2/20/2015,"I love the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes! My brother had introduced me to them and they're always a great appetizer.  This is a great place to go when your hungry with big portions to everything. The service is good, and sometimes you have to wait a while at this particular location."
Jessi M.,"Boca Raton, FL",350,223,620,2.0,11/14/2014,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory several times and it's a little too ""commercial"" for my taste. I prefer to dine a restaurants that are local, fresh, homemade, and all all that is in between. I find that the food at cheesecake is made in bulk to serve the large audience and it just doesn't come out great. I ordered the salmon salad and it wasn't even cooked all the way. Not only are all of the dishes here ridiculously unhealthy (even the ones on the low cal menu, check it out), they just aren't made with ""love"". I feel like they are just slopped together with a high price tag and called gourmet. Especially after this trip, I'm not a fan."
Mike C.,"Boca Raton, FL",72,4,,5.0,4/8/2016,The Cheesecake Factory by far has the best Roadside Sliders.  Another delicious dish to get is the factory nachos. By far the best nacho's out there.  Great service. Definitely great for the whole family.
Cammy B.,"St. Augustine, FL",19,27,46,5.0,4/18/2015,I've been to Cheesecake Factory before in other states but have not visited this location since we moved here 6  months ago. We had Jeremy G as a waiter and he made our Friday night experience dining out perfect. The food and portions were great. Actually I had to take 1\2 my meal home. He was very conscientious and knew just the right time to come by and see us.  The
Dan A.,"Austin, TX",73,467,,4.0,2/23/2015,"The tough part about eating here is trying to eat a small enough portion of dinner to leave room for dessert. From salmon to burgers (and even the occasional salad), the entrees good across the board. The happy hour apps in the bar also make a desirable meal. Topped off with a few bites of dessert and then a giant piece of cake to take home. Consistently good."
