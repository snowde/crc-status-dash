Sarah S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",260,143,147,4.0,6/8/2013,"Always a good time! Luckily, we waited not even 5 minutes for a booth, and our server came to us immediately despite the fact that the restaurant was PACKED We started with the Vietnamese Tacos, and they were awesome! The presentation was fantastic, and they were packed with flavor. The pork was super tender, and it had just the right amount of spice. Oh, and the ""buns"" it was served on were so unique.... fluffy and soft. They reminded me a little bit of Manapua. I ordered the Chile Roja Beef, and it was BY FAR the best dish I've had in a while. The meat was SO tender and was perfectly flavored and topped with peppers and onions that were delicious. The beans were the perfect consistency, and the cilantro rice was a great addition. This dish was served with little corn tortilla bites too, and I really enjoyed making mini ""tacos"" with them. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken (as he ALWAYS does), and it was amazing. Perfectly crispy and had just the right amount of orange, tanginess to it. The rice was steamed and the veggies were awesome. Again, very nice presentation. Of course, being the CHEESECAKE factory, we couldn't leave without cheesecake; however, there was SO much food that we didn't even finish our meals (super rare for us). So, we took it home along with a piece of the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple and finished it off around midnight. The food was still fantastic, and the cheesecake was like a piece of heaven. So creamy and rich and sweet.... anddddd a PERFECT ending to the night. We will, of course, go back!"
Diane D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,13,,4.0,3/29/2016,While it's always full and nose level high the food is consistently good. Dollar for dollar the best buy in Boca. They have a very large diverse menu but sad to say they no longer have roast artichokes which I will miss.
Rich G.,"Boynton Beach, FL",187,113,,3.0,1/22/2016,"I normally love the cheesecake factory. The food is always fantastic and service is usually pretty good. However, I was very disappointed about the cheesecake. I have been to multiple cheesecake factory locations and my favorite cheesecake is the banana cream. By far the best in my opinion and usually my favorite part of actually going to the cheesecake factory. Me and my girlfriend wanted to split a piece and she had never had this one before and told her she had to try it and raved about it. However, the piece they gave me was not fresh at all. The bananas were brown and could tell this has been sitting a while maybe a couple days. Definitely didnt taste how it normally does. The waiter (forget his name) asked how everything was and told him that this cheesecake was awful and told him it wasnt fresh. He says ""sorry we didnt have any fresh pieces of banana cream. That's all we had left. I apologize."" Then he walks away?!?! He didnt even offer to give me a different piece of cheesecake. Are you kidding me?! Was very upset. Now if we go again I may not even order a piece of cheesecake which is the main reason why I love to go. What a shame....."
Shauna B.,"Meriden, CT",0,5,16,4.0,10/28/2015,First time at a cheesecake factory the appetizer the Buffalo blasts were amazing a must have!! Great food!!!
Jordan B.,"Delray Beach, FL",3,35,,2.0,1/14/2015,"Don't get me wrong, I am a die hard fan of the Cheesecake Factory and would lay my life down for just a bite of their decadent cakes, but this particular one has left me jaded and skeptical of ever going back.  It was a night like any other, I had just left the movies and had placed an order for pickup. After a tub of bland popcorn, I relished the idea of tearing into the sumptuous bounty that is chicken alfredo and sun dried tomatoes. I finally get home and am about to eat my dinner, when much to my chagrin, the unthinkable happened.  Instead of the creamy, rich meal I had expected, I was given plain noodles with no sauce, only olive oil, and a spoonful of cold, bland, tomatoes. My life flashed before my eyes as I forced myself to take a bite, and let me just say - the only thing seasoning this dish was the salt provided by my woeful tears."
Bobby R.,"Coconut Creek, FL",215,284,161,4.0,1/19/2016,"Came here for some quick dessert! Sat at the bar with no problem!  Bartenders were quick and easy to talk to even with a big crowd.  I suggest trying or ordering the Banana Cream cheese cake! Nice, light, and refreshing!"
Dan M.,"Boca Raton, FL",142,52,12,4.0,11/4/2014,Great meal. Chicken Madeira is unreal.  Cheesecake was the best part that's kind of a given.  Our waitress Barbara was very pleasant.
Lisa-Joanne P.,United Kingdom,0,9,,5.0,3/3/2016,"Such a yummy meal! I was visiting from the UK - I started with the fried mozzarella sticks, then for mains I had spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered a white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake. I also ordered a pina colada. The cocktail was lovely, it was so refreshing! The fried cheese was so tasty and moreish, the spaghetti and meatballs was so tasty, I actually had some leftover so I brought it back to my hotel, the cheesecake was so good!!! I enjoyed it a lot! I cannot wait to return, after a busy day at the Town Center Mall is was so nice to have such a great meal, and to unwind and relax. Cannot wait to return!"
Lynnie B.,"Boca Raton, FL",25,5,,1.0,9/2/2016,"If I could give no stars....tasteless chicken, reheated mash potatoes and wilted asparagus.  It was supposed to come with a lemon sauce...no taste..white liquid.   Cheesecake has gone majorly downhill.  We won't be back."
Reggie A.,"Boca Raton, FL",6,9,2,3.0,4/19/2015,"Waited for a fair amount of time, but not too long considering that it was a saturday night. Our server tried hard, but just couldnt keep up. Seemed like we never had drinks and we were always still needing some side or something missing. Food was good overall."
Eddie F.,"Miami Beach, FL",46,116,206,5.0,1/22/2015,"We had a great time here as always.  We sat at the bar.  The bartender did great job and the food was good too. We had Vietnamese  shrimp summer rolls, everything pizza and tuna carpaccio. We were too full to have cheese cake.  Although there was an employee who talked very loud which bothered our time a bit but yet we still give them 5 stars cause we like their food and service at the bar."
Maggie H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,28,4,3.0,3/19/2016,"Very slow ..we waited 25m for the bread and another 25m for our food, servers are nice the host at the front not so nice..she was in a rash to answer her phone call and didn't notice we are 4 and not 3!"
Mary Beth I.,"Boca Raton, FL",21,10,3,1.0,7/16/2015,Well let me say it was an un pleasant expierence. I ordered Factory Meatloaf it came to the table burnt. It was horrible. My cousin ordered a side Cesar salad the dressing has no taste and was watery. The wait staff had no personality. Very disappointing.
Jennifer R.,"Newnan, GA",1,22,7,3.0,10/12/2015,"The food is amazing as usual at any Cheesecake Factory but the service was horrible. We were sat around 6:30 on a Monday night and it took our server, Christian almost 20 minutes to even stop at our table. I ordered for myself and my son and he started walking away before taking my husbands order - then, surprise, surprise our appetizer never came. The place is more than half empty so there really is no reason for a server to be so overwhelmed. We will defiantly be back to a Cheesecake Factory in the future - we love it - but probably not this location."
Roman M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",9,20,,2.0,2/23/2016,"After having dinner there many times I thought it was just okay, I had a chicken dish which was overcooked and the broccoli was very hard, much to al la dente.  Will only go back to the Grand Lux .  No comparison.  Much more upscale  Worth the extra dollar"
Emily R.,"Canal Point, FL",16,13,1,2.0,8/26/2015,Made a reservation for a party of 12 over the weekend. They squeezed us in to a table for 8 people. Didn't have enough servers. Took us over hours by the time the food came. Should have went somewhere else when we saw how small the table was. They shouldn't take reservations for a big group if they can't handle it. My order was wrong too. Totally disappointed
Rachel M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",727,683,293,4.0,1/31/2011,Me and my old roommates came here for a birthday dinner and it was quite enjoyable.  The serving sizes are noteworthy... the appetizers were big enough to share. I had the buffalo blasts and they were delicious.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu options and etc.  The piece d'resistance is the cheesecake... sooo many options... each one tastier and more tempting than the next.  Recommend this place for a nice sit down dinner or even to grab a slice of cheesecake after a long hard day...  Parking is a bit difficult at peak hours... Valet is an option as well..
Christina P.,"Boca Raton, FL",10,58,30,2.0,7/26/2015,"Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT come here on a Sunday between 11 and 3. Service is lacking and your food will take FOREVER. My waiter got my order wrong this afternoon then decided to give me attitude and confront me when I complained to the manager about it. There went your tip, buddy."
John L.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,16,,1.0,7/4/2016,"Very disappointed. We arrived for a reservation and waited fifteen minutes, which was not too bad. We were seated and half the drinks were brought ten minutes later. The waiter showed up about 20 minutes later let us know he had 5 tables sit all at once. We gave an appetizer order right away with  that news.The rest of the drinks arrived about 15 minutes later. We then placed our orders knowing we probably wouldn't see much of him.30 minutes after that our apps showed up. Within 1-2 minutes our dinners then showed up. Out of 6 of us only 1 person enjoyed the meal. We probably should have the manager come over and see our un eaten plates, but we were celebrating a birthday and didn't want to spoil our time together.  I must say this is the 2nd time Recently I have experienced a long wait for below average service and poorly prepared food. I don't think I'll be going back based on the last 2 visits."
Michael S.,"Jupiter, FL",7,66,4,4.0,5/21/2015,"It's the cheesecake factory, you know what you're getting. The most fattening food selections that are huge portions and are delicious. Their wheat bread is awesome, I ask for a basket of just that without the sourdough. Salads are huge and taste very fresh, really love the sante fe salad or bbq chicken ranch salad. Can't really go wrong with any dish here and of course they have some of the best cheesecakes for dessert."
