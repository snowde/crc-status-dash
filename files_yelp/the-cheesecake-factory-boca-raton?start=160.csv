Cody J.,"Gainesville, FL",6,16,1,4.0,8/19/2015,"The food here is always reliably good. The humongous menu ensures that everybody can find something they like. I appreciate that even when there are a ton of people dining here, the service is quick and attentive. Best things to order: chicken Madeira, steak Diane, and the peanut butter cheesecake. The whiskey smash is a great drink with Bulleit bourbon."
Stephanie B.,"Boca Raton, FL",18,25,4,5.0,7/21/2015,"This is probably the best managed Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Despite an incredibly busy Friday evening, once we sat down we were served promptly. The waiters provided exceptional and timely service. The food at the Boca Cheesecake location was also prepared more quickly and was much tastier than most of the Cheesecake's I've been to. Highly recommend."
Alissa W.,"Miami, FL",1931,940,91,2.0,2/18/2014,"Sorry but to me Cheesecake Factory has gone way down hill. There is nothing like a good salad, but when Cheesecake factory uses prewashed mixed salad that is all dried out and low quality all I can say is I hate chain restaurants. Seems everything is premade,precut, and prewashed. There is no taste like they extracted all the nutrients out of the food. The Santa Fe salad is half the price and Chipotle across the street, with better quality ingredients."
Allison K.,"Boca Raton, FL",8,7,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Curb side delivery took 55 minutes, I ordered at 3:45 when the restaurant was extremely slow, showed up 20 minutes after I placed the order and was told someone would be out in a minute. Called back after waiting 20 minutes. 5 minutes later a woman came out and took my credit card then another 10 minutes for her to return with my food and receipt. When I received my food it was cold. I would have walked in to complain but I have a leg injury, that's why I did curb side delivery."
Elaine C.,"Boca Raton, FL",224,177,709,1.0,11/24/2013,Raw pancake batter. Sent pancakes back. Second order was worse. See photo. Fried eggs soaked in butter. Manager comped my meal. This is the second time Cheesecake Factory ruined my meal...last time was a few months ago on Las Olas. This poor quality is why I frequent local eateries as opposed to chains.
Samy D.,"Boca Raton, FL",381,34,8,3.0,3/15/2014,"Came to get take out. People on the phone were so unfriendly, really disappointing. They couldn't have been clearer that they didn't care for the client.  Food is still good"
Lauren I.,"Boca Raton, FL",30,104,42,5.0,4/19/2015,Expensive but very good and always a pleasant experience. Cocktails are awesome. Almost as sinful as the cheesecake!!
Elyssa S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",142,173,17,4.0,4/12/2015,Cheesecake Factory is consistent and good. I love the Mac and cheese balls and chicken littles!  Passion fruit iced tea is amazing. I'm usually too full for dessert but I've had the chocolate cake which is awesome. I know I know no cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory.... Give the chocolate cake a chance it doesn't disappoint!
Frank B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2116,256,1057,2.0,2/28/2014,"Good old ""Cheesecake Factory"".  Tried this location and not much to say because you know you can get just about anything you want here, and you'll get enough to feed a small army. My recommendation is that if you want consistent (warm) food, services that is just okay, and a ""wait"" to get a table or your food then this is your place ... but on the positive side, they do have ""great"" Cheesecake at a $$$. (duh) Cheers!"
Jason G.,"Boca Raton, FL",320,446,148,3.0,9/23/2013,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. It almost brings a tear to my eyes to admit this but Cheesecake is not at all what it used to be. Still good for their staple apps like chicken pot stickers and Tex Mex egg rolls, plus their always tasty and always free multi-gran and sourdough bread is great. But the portions changed. Many no longer on the menu, those that are, bland as hell. Their baja chicken tacos did a 180% and landed on the wrong side of good. Their jambalaya, which used to be my favorite dish is now average at best. Their staff, the clientele, the Chili's-like vibe I get from both the menu, service and food, it is a sad day in chain restaurant world when this happens. Never in a million years would I said I would have preferred Grand Lux to this place, but based on the current trends it's a no brainier. For now on I'm coming here fore apps and cheesecake."
Cami W.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,43,,4.0,9/9/2015,Some locations are better than others and this is one of the better ones!  Service is pretty good and the beef with wasabe mashed potatoes is great.  One time tried the godiva chocolate brownie ice cream sundae - the brownie was so chocolatey it didn't even taste like a brownie but like pure chocolate or a fudge.  Since I was craving an actual brownie that part was kind of disappointing.  But to be honest I would have been happy with just a bowl full of the whipped cream and hot fudge!
David M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,18,26,5.0,7/19/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, of course it's good!   The menu is ridiculous for both food and drinks. The Apple Martini and JW Pink lemonade are what we usually have besides beer for drinks and are both delicious with just enough alcohol so you know it's there without the drink losing its unique flavour.  The Salmon Fire Cracker rolls, the chicken or beef sliders, and the fire roasted artichoke (da bomb) are our go to appetizers, and never disappoint.  The staff are friendly and attentive, and regardless of how many people are in our party we always have a great time.  This place is great for people of all ages, though if you have more than 4 people in your party, you can expect to wait for a table during peak meal times."
Ashley C.,"Margate, FL",0,1,,2.0,3/16/2015,"Was out to dinner with my boyfriend, my food was great; HOWEVER hubby had to send his plate back TWICE. First the brown rice was hard so it was sent back for white rice in exchange THEN the whole plate was cold thus sent back for a second time! They made a new dish the third time and it was still subpar. Manager was horrible, I had to eat my dinner without my boyfriend and then he had to eat without me. Least to say, I highly doubt we'll be eating here again."
Anthony K.,"Boca Raton, FL",11,10,1,4.0,6/6/2015,"It's been many years since I dined at The Cheesecake Factory. This location is convenient to my residence; therefore, I decided to try it out. Not bad for leaner eaters since their menu varieties are accommodating. My choice for a Kale & Quinoa salad was an excellent one but it was in a heap-full serving. It's loaded with red bell peppers to punctuate the green to give a colorful mix. The chopped kale was crispy & texturing not bitter with quinoa sticking on the greens, thanks to their light vinaigrette. The halved grapes makes it subtly sweet with lots of shredded cheese to the mountain top. You will love it! I'm a home cook and do lots of authentic American and exotic meals, but this visit got me wanting to go back. Great staff and beautiful ambience. You may wanna check it out if you haven't done so."
Meagan M.,"Central Fort Lauderdale, FL",175,119,452,2.0,2/10/2015,We had a really crappy experience. Ate here on a Sunday morning around noon. The meal took us (only two of us) over two hours. I ate a southwest salad which was fine and my fiance had a burger which he enjoyed. Will not be back due to the terrible service and  extremely slow kitchen.
Gawayne K.,"Hollywood, FL",5,29,1,4.0,4/1/2014,"I'd like to first say that Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. It was my first time at this particular location and as usual, I loved the food decor and the service was exceptional. The main issue I had was the restroom had a horrible odor. I know that some of you might be saying that, it should be expected that it would have an odor but in all my visits to numerous Cheesecake Factories this is the first time this has happened to me. I think this was just an isolated incident and overall I would definitely go back again and I would encourage my friends and family to go also."
Gisy V.,"Miami, FL",20,85,,2.0,6/6/2015,I was not impressed with this Cheesecake Factory.  The place was extremely packed and crowded.  The food was at best mediocre and the bread was hard and cold.  First time that I do not really like a Cheesecake Factory location.
Chris B.,"Washington, DC",6,81,1,2.0,6/1/2015,"The Factory usually has great service. However this location disappointed today. After being seated, it took 5-10 minutes to get water. I mean that's a little excessive, even for a busy restaurant. We're talking water here. Then appetizers and entrees were ordered at the same time, which I thought was a little rushed since we literally just got water. But whatever, we let it slide. What stunk was that I got my salad appetizer after my entree was served. Originally only my side of dressing was delivered and I had to ask what happened to my salad. I do not plan on returning again."
Keyan H.,"Boca Raton, FL",2,15,5,4.0,12/13/2015,"Came here with my girlfriend last night. Everything was perfect, the food, the dessert, and service. Can't complain about one thing. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the waitress poured my glass of wine first when she opened the bottle, instead of filling up the lady's glass first. Other then that...it was an all around great time."
Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234,4.0,4/15/2012,"I avoided Cheesecake Factory's when I lived in California because I thought all they served was cheesecake...and I was really confused why people always flocked there for dinner.   I eventually went to one in Huntington Beach (I should probably write a review) and fell in love with it.  It was the first time I'd ever had a sweet potato fry.  I didn't even know there was such a thing. But I've been to this one about four times now and it's always been a good time.  Granted, it's Boca and I'm not a huge fan of the people in west Boca because I have yet to see someone smile or wave and that's why I enjoy restaurants in Boca, because they HAVE TO wave and be nice!  It's like you see a whole new side of this city...the friendly side :) The nachos are the best.  The are regular old nachos like I used to make in junior high when I would get home from school and watch Duck Tales.  Big chips, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa.  Pretty basic but good.   I can't recall the name of it but I get the cheeseburger piled high with onion straws and barbecue sauce.  It's always to die for.  Never had a complaint here.  The best part of the meal is the ultimate margarita.  I think that's what they call it here.  It's the premium one with good tequila.  I always feel that when they say ultimate it will be like Chevy's where you can enjoy it for more than three straw-pulls but they just mean good tequila.  Either way, it's good.  If they enlarged the glass it went in it would be even better.   Definitely check this Cheesecake Factory out when in Boca, if for nothing else, do it to see entitled people SMILE!"
