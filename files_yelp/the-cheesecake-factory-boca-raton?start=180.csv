Diane N.,"Boca Raton, FL",768,550,1725,4.0,6/8/2013,"My husband and I enjoy going here for Happy Hour.  On Mondays through Fridays, in the bar, they have discounted drinks and appetizers.  The bar has comfortable booths and hi-top tables and chairs. We get a cocktail and order a few different  appetizers to share.  Their appetizers are delicious. Their regular menu has so many choices.  There's something for everybody.  I love their pasta dishes."
John M.,"Delray Beach, FL",26,18,33,2.0,9/26/2014,"It appears that food quality is no longer priority number one at Cheesecake Factory.  Twice in a row my meal has been downright pathetic.  It's a shame, as we've considered them for many years to be at the high end of the chain restaurants, above a TGI Friday's or a Chili's. In the restaurant's defense, let me say that the cleanliness and ambiance were everything they always have been, and on both occasions my wife thought her meal was almost up to par with CF's usual standards. The first time, I had the Mac & Cheese Burger.  The mac & cheese was dried out and flavorless.  The burger was cooked to my liking, but must have sat waiting way too long to be picked up by the server, as it was only room temperature by the time it reached our table.  The meat was also dry.  To top it all off,  the bun was stale.  It was the first time ever at CF that I couldn't finish the whole meal, because it was just no good. The second time, last night, I ordered Fish Tacos.  Our server asked if I would like the fish broiled or crispy.  I asked if the crispy fish was deep fried.  He said no, it just has a light tempura batter that makes it crispy.  So crispy is how I ordered it.  When it showed up, it had clearly been deep fried, which I pointed out to the server, and he said ""yes, of course,"" like we had never had the first conversation at all.  It was also immediately obvious that $14 for four very tiny fish tacos is an unbelievable rip off.  Taco Bell sells better looking food!  As soon as I picked up the first one of these tiny little tacos, the flour tortilla broke into four or five pieces because it was so dried out.  The diced over-ripe tomatoes had obviously come from a container that had a lot of water in it, and that made the texture of the dried out tortilla seem very runny, cheap, and utterly disgusting.  They need to take this item off the menu, and never bring it back. Tonight we ate at Pollo Tropical, and I must say the quality of the food was far superior to the crap I had last night at Cheesecake Factory!"
K D.,"Miami, FL",1,11,,2.0,5/13/2015,"A half hour after placing our food order, we were told that they were out of batter and that my brother was going to have to pick a new food item.  When I asked how long before his food was ready would the rest of ours come out the waiter quickly said that ours was ready now, but that it would sit and wait to come out with my brother's new meal.  We were told it would be another 7 minutes, but it really took about 15-20.  My mom ordered the California omelet which came out missing the avocado.  She was almost finished by the time they brought out a few slices.  The manager did come around finally to ask us about the missing avocado, but had no idea about my brother's food or that we had to wait forever.  After all that they didn't comp anything or provide any sort of discount or anything.  The food was bland on top of all of that."
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,4.0,4/15/2011,"What an enjoyable birthday dinner we had here last night for one of my in-laws.  Not only did we get seated promptly with the mad crowd during prime dinner hour, but the service was great.  We weren't in a rush and our server was very knowledgeable with the menu.  I settled for the chicken romano, which is baked chicken with a parmesan cheese crust and lot of angel hair pasta with tomato sause.  The plate was enough to fill up three people and I could only fill up so much up on it until I had to stop for a piece of red velvet cheesecake.  Remember to save room for a piece of cheesecake.  You won't be sorry!"
Rudy Y.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,7,,1.0,5/10/2015,Cheesecake Factory ruins Mother's Day. They have open tables. Yet refused to combine an empty table at the end of our table to accommodate our large party. The waitress embarrassed me in front of my family and made us cram together. SO GREEDY! Factory is the correct name. Cram the guests in to make money!  Just totally ruined my time with my family. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for nothing.
Guil M.,"Boston, MA",274,166,614,4.0,1/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice when you need to go out to dinner with a large group of people that you don't know well-- as others have pointed out, the menu is very extensive and has something for everyone. The avocado eggrolls appetizer is my favorite! Sometimes I just order that as my main dinner! The sauce that comes with it is delicious! If you're a fan of avocado, you'll love this, really. It's one of my favorite things on the entire menu. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta is my favorite chicken dish! Fried, breaded chicken with lemon-butter sauce with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. So good! So many calories! Definitely worth it. The buffalo chicken strips are really good, too. It's weird to order chicken strips from such a large menu, but they're probably one of the best I've had. Moist and delicious! The bistro shrimp pasta is my definite recommendation if you're in the mood for shrimp and pasta!! In terms of food quality, they never disappoint; everything is very well-made and service is great. Overall, it's an American chain, so don't expect any sort of culinary elation while dining here. However, it's a safe choice for a decent dinner for a large group or a quick lunch between classes. Just beware that their dishes usually land on those ""most caloric"" lists nationwide!! (They claim their portions are meant to be eaten as 2 separate meals...right!)"
Kristina R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",3,10,38,4.0,2/1/2014,Wait was a longer than they said but food is delicious as always! Especially the new s'mores cheesecake! Delicious!!!!
Chief H.,"Miami, FL",0,21,,2.0,4/11/2015,"First off this is not a dig against Cheesecake Factory, we eat at every location we can find and we leave satisfied.  However, there's always an exception to the rule and the CF on 5530 Glades in Boca Raton is the exception.   I ordered the shepherds pie and my wife got the beef colette.  My shepherds pie was scalding hot so I waited for it to cool while my wife sawed her way through her steak.  I say sawed because it was a very tough steak and lacked flavor.   Once I got into my SP I was unimpressed with the preparation, it looked like a minute steak which was sliced and doused with gravy and topped with the unremarkable mashed potato's and a smattering of vegetables.  It was like eating the equivalent of onion soup, just thicker.  The next day I had a stomach ache and a brief bout of diarrhea. The restaurant like all CF's is outrageously noisy, the service was poor, rushed and unfriendly. We aren't going back, we'll look for another location."
Alissa B.,"Lake Worth, FL",15,73,9,2.0,1/11/2015,"Went here for lunch today and it is a mad house.  It took over 20 minutes to get drinks and forget the food, I was beginning to doubt that it would ever come.  They were not apologetic at about the wait and other tables they sat after us had food way before we did.  The food was ok nothing remarkable."
Bill S.,"Delray Beach, FL",488,808,638,4.0,8/2/2011,"How can anyone NOT love this place. Seriously, the menu is like a book, the food is awesome and comes in HUGE portions and the cheesecakes are the best. Bring the entire family as this place has everything. A secret time to visit is Sunday for Brunch (before noon) and the food is way better than other breakfast places and the price is the same."
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/2/2014,This Cheesecake Factory is really small and food is always great I love the staff and bakery employees.
Shawna P.,"Boca Raton, FL",13,41,7,4.0,8/16/2014,"I love the miso salmon dish! I order it almost every time I come here because it never fails. My girlfriend ordered the pizza for the first time. She has been wanting to try it for a long time and was glad she finally did. The portions are large, cheesecakes are delicious, and the service is great."
Steve S.,"Delray Beach, FL",7,24,22,2.0,11/28/2014,"Mixed review tonight. Salmon -excellent. Bang Bang chicken & shrimp - not so good, (3 tiny shrimp, overcooked pasty rice) Spicy Cashew Chicken- not so good, (same pasty rice, overcooked chicken, tasted reheated), Big chicken salad - good. We've come for years but this is now the second time that consistancy was poor, it will be a long while before we try again."
Madeline H.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,8/2/2016,"On August 1, 2016 we had dinner with another couple at the Boca Raton, FL, Cheesecak Factory. We ate on the top floor of the ramp. Did you know that the air conditioner wasn't working up there? We live in Florida and the outside air temperature was 95 degrees....along with humidity it feels like 105 degrees. Halfway through dinner my husband had to leave the table because he couldn't breathe. He sat on a bench downstairs by the cheesecake cooler and waited for us to finish. We finished quickly. We were very uncomfortable and did not have an enjoyable dinner. My husband, Al, spoke to a female manager who did not seem to care. Your General Manger, Don Cortese, was not there or my husband was told he was not there. This was our friends first time at Cheesecake. Guess they won't be back either. The bottom floor was cool..........why weren't we moved down there. No one should be sitting where there is no air conditioning."
Amanda B.,"Boca Raton, FL",34,88,34,5.0,7/23/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has set the 5-star rating standards for every restaurant, everywhere; and their consistency is key! 1. free warm bread- multigrain or sourdough 2. appetizers- buffalo blasts, mex eggrolls, calamari just to name a few 3. entrees- salads, pizzas, award winning mushroom burger, chicken madeira, steak diane, shrimp scampi everything is yummy!!  4. deserts- chocolate cake, godiva cheesecake, every kind of cheesecake imaginable! All deserts, not just cheesecakes are awesome!!! 5. service/ambiance- beautiful! Clean! Attentive Sunday brunch is served till 2pm and features the greatest sandwich ever invented...the Monte Cristo! Ham, egg, bacon, and cheese squeezed between french toast topped with powdered sugar and a side of strawberry preserves and hash browns! Perfection on a dish! The pancakes and waffles are pretty good too but only served on Sunday.  Martini's are hand-crafted and muddled to order. I LOVE the strawberry martini and the lemon drop. One drink, all vodka, will give you the buzz you are looking for when you order a martini. Steer away from Sangria, it was too juicy and pre-made. This place is always packed but well worth the wait. Coming here is always a treat!"
Tony P.,"Hialeah, FL",189,60,228,4.0,11/14/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is just like any other. It is a great place to come with either family or friends. The food is great, the portions are enormous. The prices are good for what you get. One of my personal favorite dishes is the caramel chicken. It is always good at any time of year. But i always keep a place near my heard for the miso salmon. From the sweet butter sauce to the tenderness of the salmon. It is amazing. To think such a succulent dish could come out of this place. There are plenty of choices for everyone. I swear the menu seems to contain four hundred pages of meal choices. There is something for everyone here. I would give it five stars but the drinks aren't that great. I ordered a mojito and they seemed to have understood lemonade with crushed mint. This is not the first time this happened. Still i wont get deterred from coming back for more... Oh and make sure you try the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer so good!!! Also do not come here if you're on any kind of diet. Big mistake."
Tom S.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,17,11,1.0,2/6/2015,The service has turned horrific  the man waiters are only interested in flirting with the female waitresses also customers they play this game  over and over and laugh about it the staff is a bunch of teenagers the food can be good but make sure you get a server who was mature by the way my daughters spaghetti and meatballs had one meatball
Elizabeth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,96,34,4.0,1/9/2015,"I didn't get to each cheesecake because I was full from all the food. The food was great, the service was fast. We were a group of 6 and had three waiters bring out our food at the same time. The thai lettuce wraps were phenomenal, the soup of the day (Mexican soup) was very hearty. I would come here again."
S G.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,26,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Sooooo disappointing!  Our group of six stopped in for late night coffee and cake, but left very sorry we did.  First the table was set with some noticeably unclean dishes and the banquette had salad tucked between the cushion and the wall.  UGH!!!   Then the iced and regular decafs were made with undrinkable overly strong, burnt coffee.  Even the replacement cappuccinos and soda were tasteless and worthless.  Two pieces of cheesecake proved to be tasty, but the apple crisp had almost no ""crisp"", only baked apple slices and ice cream in a syrup.   Our coffee and cake outing turned into a mediocre dessert and water evening.  It took discussion with two managers to get any relief on the bill.  We should not have had to ask - it should have been automatic for a manager to simply delete the check when so much has gone wrong and six people are visibly upset about their experience in your restaurant.   This place may be a big chain, but that doesn't give them the right to take advantage and abuse customers - even ones who'll never go back again."
Tracy A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,364,231,3.0,3/10/2013,You know what you're getting at the Cheesecake Factory. Like any chain if you have been to one then you know what to expect. HOWEVER they have removed the portbello burger from the menu and this was one of my faves. Luckily you have plenty of other menu items to choose from but....I will miss the portobello.
