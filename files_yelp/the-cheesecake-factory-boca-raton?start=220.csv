Brian M.,"Boca Raton, FL",27,19,,5.0,4/12/2014,One of our family's favorite restaurant. We love the food and the great selection. Price is a bit high but you get what you paid for.
Nick A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",107,335,187,5.0,5/12/2011,"Old Faithful A place that consistently gives great bread, appetizers, dinner and desert should get 5 stars..service is quality also..salad, chicken madeira, lindas, godiva cheesecake, reeses cake, great sunday brunch food too (monte cristo sandwich!), best chain restaurant out."
Carmen M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,42,,5.0,12/14/2014,Favorite place to splurge for an evening out to eat. Elegant atmosphere and the food is wonderful. A bit expensive but there are a few lower price menu items.
Roger S.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",16,14,,4.0,7/25/2012,"i'm not sure that anyone can go wrong with Cheesecake, other than authentic international food it pretty much has everything.  the portions are huge, they are actually meant to be shared by 2 people.  The appetizers are excellent (we constantly get the avocado eggrolls or the tex-mex eggrolls), the entrees are well varied and very tasty, and the desserts... well if you like cheesecakes you'll be in good hands.  I personally am not a huge fan of cheesecakes, too heavy in my opinion, but nonetheless their cakes are very good.  The service is good and the seats are comfortable.  Good atmosphere for eating, but beware that their portions are big so don't pig out because you'll regret it afterwards :)"
Jamie C.,"Boynton Beach, FL",581,733,6615,4.0,11/8/2010,Thai lettuce wraps!!  I can eat this everyday.  So many different cheesecakes!  The ahi carpaccio is delicious and the Sweet mint green tea is very refreshing. The place is always packed with long lines.  Bit pricey for a chain restaurant.
Gustavo Q.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,77,51,4.0,9/8/2013,"Packed! And no wifi, or good cell signal to kill the time while you wait. But large food portions, so thats good."
Richard S.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,16,,5.0,5/27/2010,"Hamburgers.  This is the only thing that I order here.  The Classic Burger is my ideal of a great American classic.  Why waste time and calories with the inferior versions offered by everyone else?  Real char-broil taste, hefty size... the first bite, a little bit of heaven.  Order the fries super crispy and enjoy. Ok, my wife orders other things and they're pretty good too.  Nice fresh tasting versions of popular Oriental and Mexican dishes.  And we love the wait.  High energy people who love to eat.  It's good to be around folks who take their eating seriously.  Pickers and nibblers need not apply."
Denny J.,"Rockford, IL",0,10,,5.0,2/14/2013,"excellent menu choices.   great wait staff.  Food is top notch.   atmosphere one of the best Cheesecake Factories.    Wonderful salads, salmon, sliders or casual selections."
Satu S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",19,8,,4.0,9/5/2009,"For Foodies, it is popular to hate on Cheesecake, but I love the place. Broad fare, consistent quality, large portions, and reasonable pricing render them a no-miss for almost every outing. The cheesecakes are delicious, quite rich, and not at all dessicated like the impostors you get at Barnes & Noble coffee shops. My favorite dish is the Grilled Portobello on a Bun, with mashed potatoes, and topped off with any of their myriad cheesecakes."
Shane H.,"Edgewater, FL",6,27,15,4.0,12/21/2012,"This is the way a chain should be run. The food, no matter what is always good. The consistency is there from location to location.  Always happy to eat here."
Michael C.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,5,,3.0,4/3/2014,75% of the time the food and service is great. It's the other 25 where the server doesn't give a crap and you end up with terrible service. Food is good if you choose their go to great classics. Their newer stuff is not that great.
Brooke G.,"Delray Beach, FL",29,36,2,4.0,2/20/2012,"Cheesecake is pretty good when you need somewhere to go and you just don't know what you want.  The food is okay, service is typically so/so.   Skip on drinks to save yourself $3 on a soda."
Isabel R.,"Orlando, FL",1,6,2,1.0,8/22/2010,"One of my favorite Restaurant is ""The Cheesecake Factory"" at the Saw Grass Mall in Sunrise,FL. On August 6th 2010, my husband and I were in Boca Raton, and we decided to try the Cheese Cake Factory on Glades Road. From the point that we sat down, the service was terrible. We were seated at the Bar section, and the waitress, a young girl,  acted as if our table was completely empty. We were waiting for her service for more than10 min without being greeted or even looked at. I asked the manager how much longer we would have to wait for somebody to take our drink order, he said ""Oh sure What Do you want?"". I said Can you please  at least  bring us the Menus to decide what we want to order...in 5 seconds, like a MIRACLE the waitress appeared with the menu, and the bread. She took the order and we waited another  40 minutes. This is the worst part , the food was terrible!!! So we basically waited long for nothing.   We will still go to the Saw Grass Mall Cheesecake, the service and the food is always great there but I would NEVER go back to this location."
Ralph N.,"Los Angeles, CA",976,106,,3.0,7/19/2010,What can I say? It's Cheesecake Factory. It's pretty standard. I'm giving it three stars because of the super long wait times!
Jesse W.,"Delray Beach, FL",93,56,3,3.0,2/16/2013,as an ex employee service was a little lacking from the standards I remember.
zendick h.,"Miami, FL",3,218,,3.0,1/20/2010,"Had big office lunch here, I don't know how they were able to deal with 20+ of us but they did and did it well.  food is the same old same old one more same old too large of portions bland hoping you will forget after you eat desert food."
Tom S.,"Delray Beach, FL",8,232,40,4.0,11/18/2010,"Tonight was three cheese pasta and chicken salad sandwich. Saving room for cheesecake.  The menu items are all over the place, from burgers and sandwiches to pasta, etc.  Overall, the food has been good each time we have eaten there and the Chessecake is always great!"
Dustin K.,"Queens, NY",28,252,3,3.0,3/1/2010,"One of my proudest accomplishments in life was never going to CF... however, when in Rome, errr... South Florida... do as the wife's grandparents do (especially if they are paying). I still can't figure out why so many people want to go to this place. Is it really worth waiting an hour for a table for four? I was definitely surprised with the quality of food, but still not worth the wait. I assume its just a crowd-pleaser because the menu is so diverse that everyone in your party can find something. Here is the breakdown: - Portion Size: Plentiful (on the verge of overkill) - Price: Good bang for your buck - Atmosphere: If you like crowded elevators and Bingo, this is your speed - Service: Spotty... they are probably stretched too thin for the big crowds they cater too... definitely very friendly and knowledgeable though - Food:   - Calamari: nothing special, what you would expect from any average restaurant   - Pour: heavy hand on the whiskey --- no complaints   - Fish Tacos: not sure why they even come standard with albacore, who really wants that type of fish at a restaurant? Saved by the mahi, mahi option. Pretty tasty, nothing special.   - Bread on table: really freakin' good, probably loaded with crack and last but not least...   - Dessert: I think our dessert was called something like Adam's Fudge Nipple, but you probably would be better ""served"" asking for the Reese's Pieces tasting cheesecake... it is very rich and chocolately... recommended! All in all I can't say this was a bad experience. The food was better than I thought it would be, but I probably would not go back (especially if there is a wait). I might consider stopping in for a piece of that cheesecake though."
J N.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2012,"Awful service!  I arrived 45 minutes after placing my take out order.  Waited another 30 minutes in my car until the take out waitress came over to my car.  While I waited in my car, I watched while she provided take out orders to cars that arrived after me.  When I finally did receive my order, it was all wrong.  Will not be returning."
sam m.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,8,,4.0,3/22/2011,"Been there a few times.  1. Portions. 2. Quality. 3. Get the heck out of here, the Rene Special is unbelievable.  Can't go wrong there.  9.99 ? So much food.  Some interesting bread selections also."
