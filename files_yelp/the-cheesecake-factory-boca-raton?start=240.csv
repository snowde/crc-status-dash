Carissa S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,7,,4.0,6/26/2012,"Cheesecake factory at this location, I'm sure like at most locations, is very busy almost every night but.... you get good service, the food is delicious and the cheesecake is to die for. I always get the choc chip cookie dough! Amazing, amazing, amazing!!"
Nastassia D.,"Coral Springs, FL",11,33,7,2.0,6/23/2009,"The food is really mediocre. Chef Ramsay would piss on the food if he ever ate there. Very crowded, loud, and service is a hit or miss. The portions are WAY too big for one person. The best thing to have there is the Jamaican shrimp. They don't taste Jamaican at all, but its decent."
matthew M.,"Boca Raton, FL",4,25,,4.0,6/13/2010,The Boca location is always busy and the food and service are always good.  Gigantic menu.  It is hard to find something that doesn't taste good.
Dorian G.,"Boston, MA",39,332,1,3.0,8/14/2007,3 points for the short wait of only 30 minutes. -2 points for shoving our party of 7 into a tiny corner table in such a way that i had to get up every time someone at the table next to us wanted to get up. at least the food is consistent from location to location. that always amazes me. you can't even find that kind of consistency at mcdonalds.
j g.,"Delray Beach, FL",12,36,,5.0,1/17/2010,"I have lived in Boca for over 30 yrs. and I have to say ever since this restaurant moved in I have VERY HAPPILY eaten there with friends, family, and guests! Everyone is always impressed with the variety of fresh dishes-which are also incidentally large portions(for 2)! My favorite being the RIB EYE steak and mashed potatoes! Med. rare-the BEST- better than Morton's in Boca even!!  ITs always tender, well-seasoned, and right off the grill! There are even onion rigs on top! As for salads- the french country salad with balsamic dressing is my fave!! For desserts Everything is  marvelous- the chocolate cake with the mini morsels on the side- the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!! yum! To die for ganache! And the dutch apple caramel cheescake -almost like an apple pie!! Even the hot fudge ice cream sundae (that they make!) is just as fabulous! For drinks- Georgia peach and flying gorilla are fun! non- alcoholic beverages such as the peach smoothie or iced mango is great too!"
