Jasmine N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",89,53,53,5.0,2/24/2017,"My favorite restaurant hands down. I've come here for my birthday, my fathers birthday, and date night. Everything I've had so far from their menu has been delicious. The service is good. Sometimes you have to wait for your food a little bit longer than usual but that's okay because it's good quality and it's always hot. It has a very beautiful scenery and a good location. Strongly recommend"
Brionna H.,"Delray Beach, FL",486,102,502,4.0,6/13/2017,You really can't go wrong with a menu that offered literally anything your mind can imagine. I always try something different when I go regardless how much I might love something and I end up finding out so much more about the place. A bit pricey but for a reason. The portion you get with one meal is always enough for two. One of my favorite dishes there is the eggplant parmigiana. I couldn't imagine ever finishing it by myself but the best this about Italian? Always better the next day! However this time I tried the tuna tartar as a appetizer- I've had a similar dish at yard house with their poke nachos. But I must say I favor yard houses more. The tuna was a bit pale. And I would of preferred more chips with the meal. It has a great taste though and I would still recommend it! I also tried the half lemon pepper chicken. Man was that one of the juiciest chickens I've ever had. It's incredible and I would highly recommend it. My boyfriend had the filet mignon he could keep his hands off it! Their macaroni side dish is also amazing. One of my favorite cheesecakes is the hazelnut chocolate.
Lauren C.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,64,238,4.0,7/10/2016,"I find myself here a lot! I think it has to do with the wide variety of food on the menu. Whenever I'm with friends and we're trying to decide on a place to eat, Cheesecake always comes up as an option, because we know that there's something for everyone--even the kids.  I've been there with kids for brunch, coworkers for a casual lunch, and even a high school theater reunion. Talk about versatility.  My favorite foods here include their salads, lettuce wraps, pasta dishes, Asian tacos, and of course, their heavenly cheesecake. But don't discriminate! Try their other desserts--the lemon cake is interestingly tart--as well."
Mar S.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,18,18,1.0,3/5/2017,"Awful!!! Waited 15min for a table when there were empty tables everywhere. Then when we sat down, another 10-15min for a waiter to show up. When the water came in and there was a mosquito in it. That was it! We stood up and left. It was so bad no one even noticed.   Get it together guys!!! This unacceptable."
Pam H.,"Keswick, VA",2,20,,1.0,6/3/2017,"If you've ever wondered if your waiter makes a difference in your meal, let me assure you it most certainly does!  Our waiter came to our table with a drawn face, my husband said, ""having a rough day"", he replied every day was rough around here. Ok, so he managed to take our order and serve us but by then the whole downward vibe of his attitude had permeated our meal and we couldn't wait to finish and get out of there.  Bad waiter for sure"
Adrian G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",73,11,18,4.0,3/5/2017,I just wantef a simple dinner with my wife so you cant go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. For me the food is consistently good and their drinks are above average for restaurants.
Adriana R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",103,49,291,4.0,4/28/2016,"I ate lunch here with my friend on Friday, March 25. We have a tradition of catching up over lunch or dinner at a Cheesecake Factory location. Like all of our meals at The Cheesecake Factory, we enjoyed it. Our waiter was attentive and accommodating, and the food was delicious. Our total visit was just short of two hours, and we could tell toward the end that they were trying to hint to us to leave. [Clarification: Another user misunderstood this sentence of my review, so I re-worded it. We did not chat for an additional two hours after eating. Rather, our total visit was two hours. I think that is pretty reasonable considering the time it took to get our drinks, look at the menu, order, get our food, eat our food, order cheesecake for dessert, eat our cheesecake, get the bill, and then pay the bill.] By the way, if you ever order a dish that includes rice, ask your waiter to substitute the rice for mashed potatoes or something. The rice at The Cheesecake Factory is the worst rice I have ever tasted - a weird texture and very bland. On that note, the Orange Chicken dish I ordered normally comes with rice and broccoli, I believe. I had the waiter substitute the rice for mashed potatoes, and the broccoli for sautéed onions and carrots. Delicious! One thing I love about The Cheesecake Factory is how accommodating they are - they will substitute components of a dish without any problem (and without an extra charge)."

Devi S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",7,34,240,2.0,11/30/2016,"I went in for a lunch date and got a disappointing time. Before I start with the negative, let me give recognition where is due to our server ""Danielle D."" - what a super star you have working for your establishment.  She over did her self and went above and beyond to do something that a manager should have done.  She was the one who offered us a complimentary cheesecake for the issues we had with 2 of our dish.   I am a long time customer of the Cheesecake Factory and I can honestly say the last 2 times I went was disappointing when it comes to the food. Today was worst than ever.  We ordered the Frozen Iced mango as our drinks and it was not as good as it used to be.  A little on the diluted side and had huge chunks of ice that will not go through the straw.  Then we went ahead and ordered the Ahí Carpacio, Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, Portobello, Avocado & Zucchini Fries & Side Fruit Cup.  When our Ahí Carpacio arrived I can tell by color that it was not good.  It has a pale pinkish color when it should be bright red when it's fresh, the smell was also on the inedible side and thought I should try.. well my suspicion was right, the Ahí was disgusting. It had a fishy taste, oxidation already happen on the fish. It was horrible, left a weird taste in my palate.  The warm crab dip was also not at its best; it was a little on the dry side when it should be moist, and it had an old dip that has been re heated a couple of times taste; however, the toast was good. The Zucchini, Avocado & Portobello Fries was about the only thing good that we ordered, because let me tell you about our fruit cups.. it was horrible!! The mixed old cut up Fruits from a couple of days ago with some new cut up fruits. You can tell by the green apple in it, some has a brown edge on the skin and some apple was bright green. Some of the pineapple was also mushy yet some was fresh.  Did you think by adding new cut up fruits customer will not noticed that it is not fresh.  I mean come on!! That got me so angry as a paying customer especially at a great place like The Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not sure who you have working back in the cold food area but he or she needs some training.  First it was the Ahí Tuna, then the fruits! If you doubt the freshness of an item DO NOT serve it to the customer!! It baffled my mind that you would treat customers this way.  When serving customer fish, especially when it is not fresh it can cause food allergies even food poisoning!! Get it together Cheesecake Factory!! Stop messing up on the food, and stop serving old food to customers.  I welcome a response or call back from management or even corporate to share my thoughts. I gave 2 stars because of our server Danielle D."
Alexis J.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,47,,5.0,6/20/2017,"SHOUT OUT TO Ashley IN THE CURB SIDE PICK UP. She can always tell its me when I call ahead to place my to-go order, even before I provide my name. Huge menu, and huge portions right in the heart of Boca. I've tried a variety here- from the fish, to the salads, to the Mexican, to the gumbo and I love it all. The fried mac and cheese though....OOUMPH!"
M. W.,"Boca Raton, FL",90,72,40,1.0,5/14/2017,"Don't ever order takeout from here without triple checking your order prior to leaving. 3 out 3 times ordering takeout from here, they left items out. This time when I went to pick up, I again noticed an item missing, and they made me wait almost 30 mins for them to make it. It's unfortunate, because the food is decent, but the service is horrible."
Justine F.,"Boca Raton, FL",5,12,1,5.0,11/1/2016,"I personally love the Cheesecake Factory. You know I love to go there.  They have such a wide variety of items on their menu that you can go no matter what type of cuisine you are feeling. It might be in the $15-$20 + range for dishes, but you get SO MUCH food, it's like two meals! My all time favorites are pasta da Vinci, chicken and biscuits, miso salmon, and BBQ chicken salad. The hardest part about coming here is choosing what cheesecake to get.  Pro tip: there's a large bar area for first come first serve seating"
Samantha Q.,"Boca Raton, FL",35,61,27,4.0,7/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite for happy hour and cheesecake. Their deals at happy hour are great especially on the apps. Their menu is very extensive which makes it hard to find something if you are indecisive since they have something from every cuisine, but good if everyone in your group wants something different. My favorite is their pastas. Their salads are also HUGE which is great because after all if your eating lettuce at least get a lot! From their apps the fried mac and cheese is by far one of my favorites along with the chicken samosas. Their Arnold palmer is great as well since it comes in a huge glass from the bar with a sugared rim and is bottomless. Service could be better at this place. If you are that busy than hire more waiters."
Toby F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,15,,3.0,9/30/2017,It's pretty funny how I'm called a moron for writing a review about the loud music. And I'm told to get a life?? Someone who responds to any comment in that way needs to stay off of making comments themselves because they're the ones that will sound stupid.
Paul R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,36,2,5.0,7/14/2017,"This place is really just a classic. Never had a bad meal here. Have sent food back here and there, but that's any restaurant. Service is great majority of the time. To give a bad review because once or twice out of 50 times they forget my ketchup or water is rude and silly. I give this place a 10 for their category."
Juliet N.,"FL, FL",142,154,639,5.0,4/19/2015,"this was my first time at this location. My mother and i decided to eat here since there wasn't a long wait time. We had a very pleasant and wonderful server named Sarah. She was great! She knew the menu like the back of her hand and was really helpful with a picky person like me.  My mother and i ordered the beef slider appetizers. They arrived to our table so hot and fresh and DELICIOUS ! I almost didn't want to eat anything else...almost! Then my mother ordered the soup of the day (chicken with mushroom) with a green salad. She was so satisfied, repeating how good it was. i had salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli that was outstanding, i had to remind myself, that i needed to pace myself so that i could savour every bite!  Very pleased with our food and service!  Thanks again to Sarah for her amazing service, we hope to return soon!"
Mike G.,"Boca Raton, FL",6,73,328,5.0,11/21/2016,Always a great meal here. Actually my biggest beef is that there is too many menu items to choose from. I want it all lol. Actually had breakfast for the first time ever here and loved it...
Gary J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,,4.0,7/8/2017,I've been coming here with my family for years now. This is a very nice restaurant with very delicious food. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone that wants to eat food in a nice environment in the area.
Andremene J.,"Lake Worth, FL",76,72,149,5.0,3/1/2017,Salted caramel cheesecake mmmm. The food is good but I just come for the cheesecakes. Excuse me while I go devour my cheesecake.
