Bob G.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,9,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Service was terrible.  They weren't busy.  The food was ok.   Beer was warm, mixed drinks were good.  Wine was stale like it was a bottle opened days ago.  Time to get service or ask for anything was an eternity.  Said last time I wouldn't go back but thought I would give em another try.  Nothing changed ... overall still sucks"
Emilio B.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,8,4,4.0,12/22/2016,"Great food and service. The waiter and crew were on point. He offered us a sample of everything we were unsure of or have never tried. He was efficient and polite, a rare combo in Boca Raton. The chipotle chicken sandwich was awesome, a good blend of  sweet and spicy kick to it. Will come again and recommend."
Jp G.,"Boca Raton, FL",11,15,,3.0,6/14/2017,We went the other night and waited over an hour to get a table. Other people that got there after us were seated right away. By the time we were seated we were really disgusted
Mrs R R.,"Palm Beach County, FL",2,230,22,3.0,4/30/2017,"If you want to be seated 3 miles away from the bathroom and you are elderly or accompanied by small children, eat here! If you want to sit in a dark booth and wait 5 minutes for a server to acknowledge you,  eat here. If you want a salad that has 1800 calories and more calories than a slice of their  cheesecake 1500, eat here. Factory is an understatement.  Do better cheesecake factory. Its not even season and impressions go a long way. Quick return time on the food a plus, everything else factory executed"
Guisella V.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,5,3,1.0,6/10/2017,"I came here only because I got a giftcard for my bday. Came in with my daughters. The hostess was on the phone but when she finished,she said 3? No greeting nor smile at all. Then she sat us and then came Matthew, sadly our server. He straight up said what do u want to drink, again not a hello, nor introducing himself, not only not a smile but a frown! The food was ok but seriously this guy made our experience so awful. Never coming back here . You guys should hire people that offer better customer service."
Isabel N.,"Tampa, FL",56,1,,2.0,6/2/2017,"The location did not allow us to make a reservation, so our large group has been waiting over an hour for my cousin's birthday dinner. We've been told that the table they plan to seat us at is lingering. I'm not sure why they are unable to join two smaller tables. We won't be able to celebrate special occasions here if this location continues to refuse reservations."
Louis T.,"Boca Raton, FL",218,57,3,4.0,10/15/2016,"Got a quick cheesecake to go order to scratch an itch!!! Nothing out of the ordinary! Way too crowded as usually and a little chaotic (that's why 4 stars and not 5)... but the cheesecake was spot on as usual! We were in Mizner earlier and Juniors was out of the specific cheesecake I wanted! They told me to come back tomorrow. I said, no thanks!!! Cheesecake Factory is closer and better! I stopped in because I was here! Thanks for saving the day!"
Haley M.,"Boca Raton, FL",13,9,,3.0,4/29/2017,"They always have closed off sections which is annoying when there's a wait. Food is pretty decent overall, the menu is huge. Eaten here for breakfast lunch and dinner. Portion sizes are more than ample. Decent chance your order might get mixed up"
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1176,675,784,4.0,12/18/2015,"Good flavors? Big time Yes Quality for price? yes Competent service? usually Clean joint? usually Real beers? no, but decent drinks Happy update- They fixed the Strawberry shortcake biscuit problem (a manager explained that they had been, and recently ceased, making them in the same unit as the bacon, which gave them a flavor that did not go well, for us, with strawberries and cream) and the floors seemed a bit cleaner than they did during our last visit, so back up a bit to 4 stars...plus there are a couple of new waiters who really know their job and do it well. They're stealing us back from Maggiano's! If you like it cold, btw, ask for the large room in the back left (the one they consistently seem to seat reserved parties of 20 or more in)... nice and cold!"
Laura H.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,7,3,2.0,5/17/2017,The wait to be seated was over 1hr. Food was cold and the wait on the food was long! Waitress was nice but forgetful! Over all it is over rated
Emily T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",525,229,853,4.0,3/16/2015,"This location has a staff that is always on top of their responsibilities! I'm always satisfied with service. During this last visit, our food came out exceptionally fast and tasted great. You're allowed to order a smaller portion before 5PM. I usually never make it in before that but when I do I love to take advantage as its cheaper and more reasonable to what you can eat. The shrimp bistro pasta is my favorite entree from this chain. The only improvement the dish can use is that the shrimp is breaded. When eating it, you will realize that you're eating all breading as the shrimp is very petite. Nevertheless, as a pasta lover - this dish is deliciously made with a light sauce and mushrooms.  The Asian chicken chopped salad is also a must. Perfectly presented and satisfying due to its size. A lot of hit appetizers I have tried but I personally didn't like their loaded potato tots. The ingredients felt too mixed where you can't differentiate the flavors. They  came as deep fried balls with a side of sour cream. I was surprised that when it actually hit my table, it was losing its warmth. It was almost cold and the dish didn't taste very well."
Michael M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",67,56,29,3.0,1/23/2016,"What I wanted was listed on the menu however it's apparently no longer available (turkey burger), bread was insanely stale and rock hard, server was rude and threw the bread at us. On the plus side the iced green tea is awesome and refreshing, the burger I got was decent and the cheesecake was amazing as always.  This is the 3rd time I've gotten so-so food and service between the lunch and dinner rushes, I suspect it's the new servers and cooks that get this shift to train them during less busy times. Recommend going around the normal lunch and dinner times, then I've received much better service and fresh bread."
Paul T.,"Boca Raton, FL",108,59,9,1.0,5/26/2016,"My family and I are sorely disappointed. We are usually very happy with the food but tonight the only great thing was our waiter. We had brought 5 of us here to celebrate our daughters graduation. We didn't mind the 20 minute wait or the fact that the hostess apologetically admitted to having given our table away to the 4 who had came after us (we know this because we shared the inside seating/waiting area with them.  We ordered one appetizer soy edamame and it arrived without the soy, but immediately received a fresh order (we feel bad for he people who received the plain edamame we already had dug into. Here is where the disappointment comes in. We ordered 2 orders of fettuccini Alfredo. It was warm and bland. This is one of my favorite dishes here and left much to be desired. We ordered the Cajun pasta which was half cooked lastly our 2 other remaining guests had chicken.        It was good. In fact it was so good that 3 of us shared the 2 others plate. The place was packed otherwise I would have approached the manager especially because the Bill was 125.00 without tip, and only one alcoholic drink. Very disappointing!"
Idan R.,"Toronto, Canada",964,205,618,5.0,1/10/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a purely successful recipe for a restaurant. The food is fantastic. The prices are amazing. The portions are huge. The space is large, clean and inviting. The service is always reliable. This chain is a well-oiled machine. It's my favorite large format restaurant BAR NONE. If only we had it in Canada!!! The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is huge. Here are some of my favorite dishes: Steak Diane --------------- Amazing, deep flavor. The mashed potatoes are out of this world Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp ---------------------------------------- Amazing flavors all around. Grilled Steak Tacos ------------------------- Simply good tacos. The cheesecakes are out of this world. Some of my favorites are: - Red Velvet - put it in an inter venous bag and hook it up to me! - Godiva Chocolate - Traditional Cherry Cheesecake"
Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1715,407,2.0,8/22/2015,"My Florida based family loves the Cheesecake Factory. I guess a lot of other people do too, because there's always a 10 to 20 minute wait to get a table in their gargantuan dining room. However, I honestly don't get the appeal of this place. Yes, the menu is extensive and the portions are big, but every time I've been been frogmarched into eating here, the food has been disappointing. Case in point, the $15 Asian chicken salad with 5 tiny slices of chicken, 6 pounds of lettuce, and zero flavor. Same for the lettuce wrap chicken tacos. Simply boring and no soul at all.  I can't help but feel that it's a real shame to waste cash here on nondescript dishes with few redeeming qualities. You can do so much more with your dining dollars! I definitely recommend checking out some of the other great restaurants in the area before eating at the Cheesecake Factory."
Anna C.,"Boca Raton, FL",44,15,226,4.0,7/18/2016,I enjoy their fresh salads and their Avocado Egg Roles are absolutely delicious but nothing beats their cheesecakes! They are simply the best!
Annika S.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,4,1,4.0,8/19/2017,"Always had good experiences with the food- miso salmon is fantastic every time and the mango key lime cheesecake is my favorite. The fried mac and cheese is to die for. Large menu both for food and drinks, every drink I've had (usually go for fruity cocktails or margs) has been tasty and everything is generously portioned.  There is almost always the same hostess there whenever I've gone, and I'm almost always put off by lack of friendliness. I've come in sometimes and said ""hi how are you?"" And got a gruff ""how many?"" In return- not even a hello. I worked as a hostess for years when I was younger in nearby restaurants and friendliness is the most basic tenet of the job- lack thereof here has made me feel unwelcome before I even sat down.  Aside from the hostess, service is usually what I would consider average- always friendly but lacking in some technical aspects of service. Always have to ask for new silverware in between courses after old has been taken away, before that waiting 5-10 minutes before even being greeted once sat & drinks are slow to come out after that, and despite having extra staff who appear to be bussers somehow dirty plates aren't taken away unless we ask them to specifically. This has been the case almost every time I've eaten here, so I think it's just something that the restaurant should teach its staff. I work as a server at another constantly busy nearby restaurant so it's hard not to notice these things, but I come out to eat to relax so ultimately I still enjoy my experience every time I come here even if service could improve. We appreciate that this location is open a little later in the evening than most other nearby restaurants & food ordered to go is just as great."
Jason S.,"Boca Raton, FL",154,21,5,4.0,4/13/2017,Food here is almost always on point. Service is always realllllly slow. Its improved a lot though from when I talked to the GM and told him my experience. Keep up the good work. We love cheesecake factory!
Bob W.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,12,8,1.0,8/5/2017,"My wife and I went on a Monday evening around 7:00pm, we waited approximately 15 minutes for a table. We ordered our drinks which were ok however the food sucked. I had a burger that was burned beyond belief and my wife had a pasta dish also very over cooked.  The waiter never came back to check on our food after serving us and when I asked for the check I mentioned that the food was poor, he really didn't care or ask for details. Never again"
Chef D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,8,,1.0,4/28/2016,"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I walked in to Cheesecake Factory, sat down at the empty bar, literally empty, NO BARTENDER ON DUTY AT 4PM! Proceeded to sit and be ignored for almost five minutes and left! Called and spoke with ""Bill the Asst GM"" and wasn't offered anything but ""I'm sorry and I will get to the bottom of this."" So, given the fact I know the Ex Corporate Chef, I am a Personal Chef and have been a Chef for over 25 years, I am PUZZLED to be mild about it. I personally live in the LA area and visit CF regularly, I've NEVER received such HORRID SERVICE from any CF WORLDWIDE. Oh yeah, I travel quite often as a Personal Chef and have always been happy to see a CF knowing I'd get solid food and good service.  I got neither here and no help from Management either! You listening CORPORATE!?! FIX THIS!!!"
