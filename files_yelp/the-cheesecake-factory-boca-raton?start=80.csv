Juliene R.,"Margate, FL",144,81,42,1.0,1/7/2017,"I'm a very frequent customer at Cheesecake Factory, I normally order the miso salmon and a side of shrimp scampi or shrimp and normally the customer service is great and they accommodate me but this time the server I had was very unaccommodating as well as she didn't even try to understand that I'm a regular at cheesecake and normally it's a side of shrimp. If you're going to be in the service indulge and learn your business the server was Kelly"
Tiffany G.,"Broward, FL",98,253,125,5.0,5/1/2016,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I'd list it in my top 5 favorite restaurants! This is because I know what to order when I come here.. I know what their best dishes are!! I used to frequent this restaurant more often back in the day when it was closer to where I spent my afternoons. Back then, I was able to sample a majority of the menu and I was able to rule out many dishes you should definitely not order. After some experience, I was able to come with friends and when someone would try to order the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, per say, I would advise against it. Not their strength, and if you ask me, that one should have been removed from the menu a long time ago...oily and tasteless... Not every dish here is their strength, but knowing the ones that are make for a guaranteed amazing meal here!! Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory likes to remodel their menu often. I have noticed they tend to keep some of their items that aren't so great but remove some pretty great ones!! Still not sure why this is so and who makes these decisions?? RIP to their roasted veggie and goat cheese pizza (flavor was amazing!!!), their shrimp and bacon club sandwich, The grilled portobello on a bun, and most recently noticed.. The White chocolate blueberry cheesecake!! Luckily, they left a few good ones.. Since I don't frequent the place as often anymore, I'm not as familiar with many of their new items.. I plan to try a few at some point!! I came for dinner tonight and left super happy wanting to give them 10 stars if I could..so here are some items I recommend!!! We started with the avocado egg rolls  (such a classic here) and the crispy Cuban rolls for appetizers. The eggrolls are amazing in the sauce they come with and the Cuban rolls which weren't around when I used to frequent the place back in the day have recently become a favorite of mine!! Delicious!!! Now take notes here and thank me later......For my entrée, I ordered the Miso Salmon BUTTT I ordered it with no rice and replaced the rice with mashed potatoes instead AND I ordered extra sake butter and extra miso glaze on the side (for you to add at will while eating)!!! These changes are an absolute must!! I have friends and family call me all the time when dining here to ask just how I order it since it's so amazing this way!!! I practically moaned my whole way through dinner!! ....and this is coming from someone who rarely orders a salmon dinner anywhere! .. By far my favorite one!! For dessert on this particular evening, We decided to try a cheesecake I have never tried here before.. The Oreo!! It did not disappoint and quickly went to my top favorites!! Just a note as well I did not order these on this visit.. But I am also obsessed with their Santa Fe salad and their Fresh Vegetable salad (this one is in salad apps).. I often get extra of the dressings that come with each on the side since they are so incredible!!  ..and you really can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes! I really love that their whipped cream is so fresh tasting too!! So good! Yum!!! I hope to be back to indulge really soon!!"
Nicholas R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,19,10,3.0,9/26/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory normally. Just my girl and I visited them last weekend and order Moscow Mules and they were the worst, not even in the right glasses. They are supposed to use a copper mug, and they bright them in high ball glasses. Not the best bartenders I guess. They said they don't have those mugs, but if your cheesecake you should. My opinion. The service was off kilter and the drinks we sent back.  I will be visiting different locations ""if"" I wanna go again. We had the Crusted Chicken Parm, not enough sauce either. It stunk that night. I go to the best restaurants around town, and I expect great service for the money $$$."
Patrick N.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,6,,2.0,8/7/2017,My son ordered specifically tacos WITHOUT onions....came w onions...no apology no nothing! Ordered Tuna salad...waited for 20 mins ...came out and said they were out of tuna!! 12 noon on Sunday ...all out of tuna!!?? REALLY!!!?lol! I don't blame the wait staff ...it's poor kitchen management ! First bad exp at a Cheesecake factory.
Elise M.,"Boca Raton, FL",2,34,,4.0,1/17/2017,"I love their Caesar salad. That's all I ever have ordered, it's that good. Sometimes you get seated in an area where the tables are just too close together. Otherwise they would get 5 stars from me. I shared the sugar free cheesecake with a friend, it was good."
John M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",61,5,,5.0,2/22/2017,Food was delicious. The prices are pretty reasonable. The service was great. No complaints at all. I'll be back for sure
Scott B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",9,180,100,5.0,10/25/2015,"Ah.... The famous and delicious Cheesecake Factory....for meals as well as desert ! As a family, we love this experience and can only visit every once in a while as there is just so much offered from delicious fresh bread to the extremely large portions.  There are so many unique and delicious appetizers and meals offered.   They even now have a dedicated. Kids menu that fill those little ones and their bellies.   Their pasta meals are special, salads are huge, and even familiar offerings like meatloaf are next level offerings. You won't be able to ace room for desert unless you plan on taking 1/2 your entree home.   It is however a must to try the cheesecake concoctions ( must be 30 types) or one of several other great deserts like Strawberry shortcake.   So pop in for a great experience and spend some quality time with family and friends.  Don't worry about asking to take part of your meal home, they are prepared and will offer suggestions as needed to help move this the expansive menu.   Servers are well trained and very caring and observant of your needs."
Ervin H.,"Miami, FL",4,37,,1.0,12/31/2016,"The worst service ever. Stay away. Slow service, no Table touches, no one brought us drink refills until we had to request it at the end of our meal...I've always expected more from this brand. Our dinner was on 12/31 and server was Audrey who did her best to rectify the bad service from the previous server. The General Manager was absolutely no help at all..."
Paola W.,"Boca Raton, FL",107,79,8,4.0,4/13/2016,"Really impressed by the food at this place everything you order is simply delicious!! From appetizers to entrees, the service was excellent too, having a potential to be one of my favorite places to dine in the area since their menu is so rich. The reason they don't have a 5 star from me is because unfortunately they served me raw shrimp in my dinner yesterday, I'm not making a big deal out of it because I didn't get sick and the manager was extremely professional about it, so maybe they will earn my full confidence pretty soon!!"
Lisa S.,"Boca Raton, FL",256,358,591,4.0,3/13/2016,"I'm usually not impressed with chain restaurants but my son and I had a lovely Sunday lunch together today. We really just came here so he could try the cheesecake. We were able to sit down right away at a high top by the bar. Our server greeted us immediately and took drink orders. She was friendly and helpful. We shared the crunchy little Cuban sandwiches starter and they were sooo delicious! We then shared what's called ""Adam's "" peanut butter chocolate cheesecake, which they split for us and put on two plates. We really appreciated that. I feel this chain does a great job at consistently serving quality food, drinks and desserts in an upscale casual atmosphere."
Maire C.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,7,1,1.0,2/9/2017,The reason for one star is the parking arrangement at night. The valet is useless. They only have one person working it so its slow and they take all the spaces in front and if you park yourself you have to walk far. Doent make sense.
Monica B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,2.0,11/21/2016,"I placed a take out order. I got the Skinnylicious chopped salad without bacon. They gave me the salad with no bacon, no chicken and no dressing. I also asked for sourdough bread and they gave me the other one. Terrible service."
Amie M.,"New York, NY",18,17,,5.0,5/17/2017,"Our waiter named Dylan was fantastic on Friday evening May 12th when my husband and I had been waiting for our nieces when we arrived too early, and thus he and I were there for quite a few hours ....  with the very best service!  Dylan was super polite, friendly, thorough and seemed to truly enjoy his job.  Of course the food was -- as always in any Cheesecake Factory.... delicious !!   I now have a recent new favorite -- the avocado egg rolls  that are  great!  Thank you to Dylan for making the time we spent in your restaurant so pleasant !   I hope this can find it's way to management at this location to recognize the stellar attitude Dylan displayed to us!  (If it does reach management there, just in case there are more than one Dylan on staff, wanted to mention we were in a booth in the section very close to the restrooms.)   Anyone who likes avocado should order those avocado egg rolls and my very favorite main course, Miso Salmon -   it's beyond fantastic the salmon that Cheesecake Factory serves."
Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",898,1221,4079,4.0,3/10/2015,"Let's start with the fact that I don't generally like chain restaurants. That being said, this particular chain is better than most because it seems to be able to hire and train chefs who can execute consistently at a higher level. It's not 4 star against say, 32 East, but in the category of solid chain restaurants that are upscale, it's one of the best.  Their Skinnylicious menu in particular keeps me coming back because it is low enough calorie without compromising taste.   I'm immune to the rack of devastatingly good looking cheesecakes because they do cold-pour and I'm a NYC baked kind of guy. Otherwise I'm sure I'd be in the CA meetings (Cheesecake Anonymous). One of the things that chain restaurants suffer from are lower quality ingredients when you have to buy in that kind of quantity. Unlike Brio which is Olive Garden on steroids, the Cheesecake Factory is a very nice scale restaurant.  There are small things, like the ever-flowing stream of waitstaff that is not often as well schooled in the menu, or customer service, and occasional product issues like leaving artichokes, which are seasonal, on the menu year-round, which requires them to buy from suppliers of product that is small, hard, and less optimal.  Costing them a star? The Cheesecake Factory plays the game of marking up the suggested tip (15%, 18% 20%) on the bill to include tipping for the sales tax. Tipping is always done off the SUBTOTAL, NOT the total.  That's a rip-off of the consumer because they assume they can't add or will not check. I brought it to the manager's attention, but he has to kick it up the McLine to corporate which installed and placed the system so I'm not holding my breath on the customer responsiveness. The place is constantly busy, but they do move traffic well so it generally is not an issue. Be prepared to wait though on average 10-30 minutes."
Cecy G.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,10,2,2.0,10/23/2016,I order a chicken fettuccine Alfredo.  The dish was terrible and lousy.  I wish I could have my money back.
Gerald C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",22,6,4,5.0,11/1/2016,Always great food.  My favorites include stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls.  Drinks at happy hour always a treat . A great place for friends and family . Don't fill up on the most amazing bread they put on table. Save room for dessert .
Bryn R.,"Lake Worth, FL",152,136,865,4.0,1/22/2016,Holla at the happy hour! Sit at the bar and enjoy the flowing alcohol : ) apps and drinks from 5-5.50$
Sheila W.,"Delray Beach, FL",4,6,,5.0,5/17/2017,"Haven't been here in awhile. Ambiance outstanding. Service attentive. Bread basket still the same but why change a good thing. The menu is huge. Like reading a book. We were there for lunch. Seated almost immediately. I had lunch portion of the meatloaf, nice large slice with sautéed onions on top, asked for gravy on side, mashed potatoes which were fresh made and succotash, which was fresh corn kernels, small pieces of zucchini and red pepper pieces on top. Had some spices in it. Very good full plate. My son had pasta dish with fresh veggies on pasta. He finished it all. Said it was very good. The other diners near us all had good looking dishes brought out also. After have no my lunch leftovers packed up I ordered strawberry cheesecake. Oh my. Delicious. Three extra large strawberries with whipped cream on plate, nice presentation. But of course it's the Cheesecake Factory. We shared the cake and it was a nice end to an enjoyable lunch. Looking forward to my next visit to a lovely restaurant."
K V.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,4,,1.0,9/12/2017,"Horrible experience tonight. After a horrific hurricane we just wanted a hot meal (we have no power.) After we sat  we ordered drinks that took 20 minutes to get (no big deal they only had one bartender, we get it) we immediately ordered food before the drinks came and 15 minutes later the power goes out (again no big deal, we get it.) We sat patiently waiting and finally flagged down our server and he said sorry the power is out, you probably are not getting food. I had a two year old and an infant, so probably was not going to work, we needed a yes or no because we needed a plan B. Finally the server says no. Not once did a manager come to our table and explain the situation or offer any apologies, when we asked the server why no one came to tell us, he was just as surprised because a manager was ""suppose "" to be on his way, meanwhile the server was taking off his apron to go home. My husband and I both worked in the industry so our patience and understanding is 100% there, but they handled it inappropriately. I am disappointed and sad to say I will not be back."
Thiago P.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,2,3.0,10/16/2016,"I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and it was very good, just a little dry. The service wasn't the best and wast to busy. I wasn't asked how my meal is or if I needed anything."
