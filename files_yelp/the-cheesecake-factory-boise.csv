Kat D.,"Meridian, ID",147,179,150,4.0,11/4/2017,"I have always loved the cheesecake that I can get at Cheesecake Factory, but I have really started to enjoy their actual food as well! Yes, the menu is extensive.  I wish it was like a 1/3 of the size it is, but I end up sticking with what I know & don't venture out to try something new.  My husband and I had Hunter as our server for the last 2 visits. I have to admit that service in the past has been pretty hit or miss....with more misses than hits. However, once we had Hunter, my faith was restored! He is always totally attentive without being annoying, he is super friendly, and he even managed to remember exactly how I wanted my cheesecake. I hadn't been here for about a month and my cheesecake order is a bit of a pain in the ass...strawberries on the side, glaze on the side, whipped cream on the side, & I want the original cheesecake with the sour cream topping, not the standard cheesecake that is served with the strawberry cheesecake. Yes, I have food issues. Yes, I know I am a pain...but I do tip well!  He has only been our server once before tonight, but remembered everything about my order. Impressive.  For dinner tonight we ordered: Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style Old Fashioned Cheeseburger & fries The Chicken parm is seriously AH-MAZING!! Seriously! It's balanced perfectly and the chicken maintains its crispness without tasting over fried or breaded The burger was also on point.  It's always seasoned really well and doesn't require a ton of sauce to make up for the lack of flavor.  The only negative is how crowded it gets and when it's crowded (most nights) you are seated super close to other diners. It doesn't allow for much privacy, but hey, I'm willing to endure it when the reward at the end of the night is cheesecake!"
Greg D.,"Meridian, ID",1238,341,5279,4.0,8/6/2017,"Reviewer #120 I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, specifically the cheesecake!  They have lots of very good food, too, but the cheesecake come in so many flavors, and large sizes that I find myself going out to dinner elsewhere and stopping by here for dessert.  My mom got a side of strawberries for her cheesecake and gave them to me. To be completely honest, they were the biggest, best tasting strawberries ever. I felt like I never had a real strawberry until I had one from CF. I think they fly them in super fresh or something.  There is sure to be a flavor that everyone will love.  The seating isn't the best and you're super close to other people, but it is what it is. The artwork on and architecture is beautiful and a conversation piece for sure."
Bryan S.,"Meridian, ID",31,89,135,4.0,9/26/2017,"The menu at this place is the biggest  I have ever seen in a restaurant.   I kid you not that it has several pages just for the appetizers.  That being said,  there is something for everyone in your group.  The place is very big and is nice plus they do have a bar.  We love the selection of small breads that come out before the meal.  The waiters are professional and effective. The kitchen gets your food out pretty quickly and does well if you have a modification to your meal.  We like to order a selection of appetizers and call it a meal but I have ordered from the menu and have always been pleased.  We also enjoy ordering our cheesecake to go at the end of the mill. The hardest part is picking out one of the cheesecakes from what I perceive that is at least 25 choices.  I would definitely recommend this place as one of the best restaurants in the mall area."
Cassie L.,"Boise, ID",332,32,193,5.0,8/18/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants. I've never had a bad experience here. They've never messed up my meal. I love their bread I actually look forward to that.  Favorite dish is the Steak Diane. Mr. Euro (my fiancé) loves their chicken dishes. He's into their chicken piccata right now. Cheesecake wise, go for the white chocolate raspberry. It's so good, it's delicious but not too rich. You can actually enjoy it. Great food, wonderful ambiance. My only complaint if I had to find one is there's bad cell phone reception? Haha. But you don't need your phone at dinner anyway! Great place!"
Thia H.,"Boise, ID",105,33,14,4.0,11/29/2017,Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!! I love Cheese cake factory. The food doesn't disappoint. I've tried so many things and I'm always happy. I come for happy hour at least 4 times a month and dinner at least 2 times a month. I get the cosmopolitan..... get a cocktail with your meal any one is usually good! I had to knock a star because sometimes the service is super slow. I once sat at a bar top and saw my drink that I ordered 10-15 mins ago just sitting at the bar pass dying while other less busy servers were just standing waiting for their drinks. As a server it pains me to watch this. It literally would've taken two seconds for one of them to deliver it to us and help their fellow server out. I had to get up and ask the bartender to grab our drinks for us. One bad experience doesn't take away from this place though. I would recommend sharing a slice of cheesecake (I can never finish one).
Candace J.,"Summerville, SC",106,151,43,4.0,6/26/2017,"Typically I avoid the Cheesecake Factory because it's a bit overwhelming and past experiences have been unremarkable. However, while visiting family in Boise we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for lunch since it could accommodate our whole party (12 adults, 5 kids). It was lunchtime but kind of late and in the middle of the week so it wasn't too busy. We were able to get a table within about 5 minutes. Our party arrived in waves which I think benefited us and the wait staff and kitchen because we all ordered as we arrived and none of us had to wait for our food for a long time.  Myself and my mother-in-law have to eat a modified diet and were able to find entrees that worked with our needs. Our waiter was very attentive and great with all of us. He was patient with the kids and the mess we all made. All in all it was a good visit."
Jennifer F.,"Boise, ID",38,121,,2.0,12/17/2016,"My husband and I were leaving the mall and decided let's grab a bite. The weekend before Christmas was crazy and getting out of the mall was more than I could take.  We were sat immediately.  Our server Sara had the personality of oatmeal. She clearly does not like being a server and is less than ambivalent about serving. Ok. Our server and food were cut from the same cloth. Mediocre at best and lacking in personality or flavir. We sent back the guacamole made to order. Spicy means it tastes as spicy as oatmeal. We get it back and it's still oatmeal. We asked for onion, cilantro and green chillies which we received.  Once we remade the guac. It was better. However I was over the place. My husband thought his martini was OK. So I stated let's get outta here.  Bottom line: go to a diner you will get the same quality in Food."
Jen R.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,21,2,5.0,12/19/2017,"Excellent service! Thank you Carson for serving us today. You went above and beyond to take care of us and make sure we were happy. You were attentive to our needs, and made the perfect suggestion for my friends dairy allergy. Not only that, you were just in general a friendly and helpful person. You even packed up our leftovers to go. And got us to go cups for our drinks! Thank you again for your great service. We will be back to your section specifically."
Lauren B.,"Boise, ID",19,54,60,3.0,1/2/2017,"Came here to have lunch with my Dad while we waited for an appointment at the Apple store in the mall. I ordered the ""small appetizers"" crispy crab bites and a cup of cream of chicken soup. Dad got the lunch portion of fish & chips. While we waited we snacked on the complimentary bread, which was pretty good. Granted we we there on a busy day, but the staff is either overworked or incredibly clumsy, as we consistently heard silverware and plates being dropped all over the restaurant about every 15 minutes in our hour and a half visit. Makes for a slightly awkward dining experience.  The crispy crab bites appetizer was really tasty, and totally nailed my seafood craving. The cream of chicken soup, however, was so bland and uninteresting that I unfortunately only took a few bites and left the rest. The lunch portion of fish & chips was huge! Quality, tasty white fish in a traditional batter. Very good."
Kassondra D.,"Boise, ID",26,16,25,4.0,9/17/2017,"I always enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory.  Expect to wait if there is a special event (half price Cheesecake day for example) or its a busy Friday or Saturday night.  This wouldn't be so bad if the lobby had a bit more seating.  Often you have to stand because all the benches are taken.  The servers are usually very friendly.  There has only been one time I can think of where we felt a bit forgotten by our server.  The food is always fresh and flavorful and I love all the variety.  The cheesecake is great but expensive so we don't always indulge.  Last time we went was half price cheesecake day and it was very busy, waited about an hour to be seated but the hostesses kept us updated and they got me some water while I waited (I was 9 months pregnant) and I thought our server was very attentive.  He made sure our cups were always filled and we had plenty of bread while we waited for our meal."
Laurie B.,"Boise, ID",350,11,8,5.0,10/14/2017,"I had the PASTA WITH SHRIMP AND SAUSAGE. Made with rigatoni pasta, shrimp, and Italian sausage, the generous portion was covered in a rich and spicy marinara sauce that was delicious. Our server was Forest, his customer service was excellent."
David M.,"Spokane, WA",2,25,24,5.0,6/10/2017,We are having the best dinner ever and Alan Johnson is by far the best waiter I have ever had. Got the bread right away and the food is hot. Definitely ask for his section..
Celia K.,"Garden City, ID",0,4,6,1.0,9/29/2017,"So everyone knows I worked at the Cheesecake. The food is great but the Cheesecake is not made here or all restaurants really. They have a factory in California and others where they mass produce then, freeze them and send them out. They are only decorated at the Cheesecake Factory. All the dessert are shipped frozen. It still good food but not fresh desserts."
Joanne E.,"Wenatchee, WA",1,17,1,5.0,9/19/2017,Omg...what a great meal. The atmosphere was nice and it allows us girls to catch up. The portions were more than we could eat and we had to take our cheesecake home. We will definitely be going back.
De E.,"Riggins, ID",5,5,,5.0,8/3/2017,What's not to LOVE about the Cheesecake Factory? They have a great menu - I had the chicken parmigiana pizza style and of course cheesecake for desert. The staff was friendly and service was great and the food was awesome!! We try to go there every trip to Boise plus it's right at the mall so walk off the lunch or dinner shopping at the mall.
D. W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",798,1407,,2.0,11/30/2016,"Fuck. That's probably not enough for a review. So, here's a list of grievances: extremely poor and dim lighting, nearly offensively so. Obscenely slow kitchen. The microwaves can't all be that slow. Sure, it's an excessive menu, but really, I could have driven somewhere else, returned with food and eaten it all before the dishes got to the table. Wait staff was solid, but unspectacular, though I will note she tried (and missed) very hard for charming. Points for effort there...kinda. Calamari was ok and so was the Bang Bang dish. It was billed as chicken and shrimp, but what they really meant was a pepper coconut cream vaguely sort of curry sauce, substandard rice, a half-handful of small chicken chunks and 2 shrimp. Joy. The salted caramel cheesecake is probably floating around somewhere in one of those circles of Hell, though the middle part wasn't totally offensive. This place is also stupidly overpriced and I really don't know what it is, but the only good locations I've been to of these places has been on the East Coast...not sure why, but every location I've been to out West has simply not gotten it...if you feel like throwing a pile of money at mediocre junk, here you go."
Mazal S.,"Boise, ID",17,111,115,3.0,12/1/2016,"Came here because of a cravings a family member had. It was fine. a ok. nothing better to say really. their tables are oddly big and its very hard to talk to each other especially since the music is so loud and the atmosphere is so ""romantic"". meaning... dark. i hardly saw my menu. i really get upset when its too dark in a restaurant. when I'm hungry i expect to see the menu and the food i get served. Makes me paranoid when i cant see what i eat or if the place is clean. feels like they are hiding something :). The food wasn't bad. I had salmon with brown rice and they didn't over cook the fish. no fry sauce. what?! had to explain what it was. Cheesecake was dry, way too sweet and tasted old. fail on desert that supposed to be their signature dish. quite pricey too. big portions."
Mary A.,"Boise, ID",10,209,,5.0,6/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has been at the Boise Towne Square Mall for almost ten years now.  My first experience was such that I didn't want to go back there.  The portions were huge although tasty and it just appeared that mega amounts of food and dessert was the idea here. We've been here recently for lunch and ordered from the Skinnylicious menu tasting wonderful salads and flatbreads with a smaller calorie output.  Today we opted for brunch which is only served on Sundays here.  Normally this restaurant opens at 11 AM but on Sundays opening time is 10 AM.  Compared to other popular and crowded breakfast places around here this one was fairly quiet and we didn't have to wait! Coffee was robust and fresh.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed.   We ordered.   My husband and I shared a Spinach, bacon, mushroom and cheese omelet and an order of lemon ricotta pancakes.  Our son opted for a Chorizo and Avocado omelet.   Egg orders come with sides of fried potatoes and a choice of bread. The omelets were nice and fluffy and we all enjoyed the combinations we ordered.   The lemon ricotta pancakes were thin, almost crepe like  and came with a small carafe of heated maple syrup.  There was a sprinkling of powdered sugar on the plate and sliced strawberries.  I used about a tablespoon of syrup and honestly wouldn't have needed any since the pancakes on their own were very light, with a touch of lemon and perfectly delicious! When we finished, the server asked if we'd like to see a dessert menu.   It was out of the question---we were full!  I'm thinking that the Cheesecake Factory should change it's name.   There are definitely so many choices on the menu and healthy ones.   There are even calorie counts listed after the items.  Very helpful to those of us wanting to keep the carbs, fats, and calories under control.   And if you really want a special treat after that----there is always cheesecake!"
Cristen S.,"Boise, ID",0,39,,4.0,12/16/2017,"You can always count on the cheesecake factory to deliver a consistently good meal and good service. Even though I almost always order the same item, it's always delicious.  Regardless of what you order, your meal always starts with their delicious, fresh baked sourdough and black bread; served warm with creamy butter.  My favorite menu item is their Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos.  The wraps are served in leaves of tender Bibb lettuce, filled with grilled, moist chicken, fresh bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and other Asian components.  My favorite part is the two sauces you drizzle over the top, one a sweet cilantro sauce, the other a sweet soy sauce based sauce.  The sauces are addicting.  Nicely flavored and a perfect addition to the taco toppings. It's ordered off the light meals section and with the bread is just the right amount of food without feeling too guilty.  Today I splurged and tried their buffalo chicken nuggets.  The nuggets are made in house with a nice crispy batter coating, juicy chicken inside, and a schmear of buffalo hot sauce on top.  Some come skewered on a toothpick with a dill pickle slices, which adds a nice briny contrast, and ranch dressing is served on the side for dipping.  Not only are they delicious, but also a very good value at only $5 for 6 large nuggets, good for sharing as a starter.  Our server was good and offered not only the daily specials but recommendations.  Our food came out quickly, and our drinks were re-filled a couple times, would have appreciated a refill after we finished eating and were still talking, but still good service otherwise."
Shelly C.,"Meridian, ID",26,77,35,5.0,12/6/2016,We come here often for dinner but this time just popped in for dessert and coffee. One of our favorite go-to's when we're at or near the mall. They're always super busy so you can usually expect a short wait. The lemon raspberry cheesecake is always a good stand-by and you can't go wrong with with carrot cake cheese cake! And they have good coffee too!
Thao L.,"Richland, WA",83,59,37,3.0,11/13/2016,"We came in on a Saturday night, a group of 5 people and were told that there would be a 10-15 minute wait. We waited about 30 minutes and no one ever let us know that the wait would be longer. All we saw was that every one else that came in after us got seated well before us so that was quite frustrating. The manager came out to apologize but didn't offer any resolution. Not good customer service. HOWEVER, if you can overlook that, the quality of the food was good and our server Chuck had great customer service."
Kenny C.,"Denver, CO",63,94,41,2.0,4/1/2017,"Well, a little surprised to be honest.   Sat at the bar where there are two bartenders and 3 customers.  I ordered a beer and some food.  The bartender did not make up a place setting for me ( which others had and is customary).  Food came quickly as did my drink.  I asked for a bottle beer and a glass.  I had to pour it myself.  No one checked on me.  I had to get their attention for salt/pepper and for a soda.  Plan on getting dessert to go.  Wish they were more focused on the customers in front of them."
Janay P.,"Eagle, ID",115,6,,1.0,4/7/2017,"I LOVE the cheesecake here so I was disappointed last night when my friend found a hair in her food. We were all pretty disgusted but shook it off and still had a great time. The waiter didn't offer to replace her food or refund the money when he found out about the incident. It happens, I thought. Unfortunately today while enjoying my leftovers for lunch, I found a coarse, black hair mixed in the herb topping on my herb crusted salmon. Two hairs?!? I am thoroughly grossed out and if I ever return, it will be to get cheesecake to go."
Rod S.,"Ontario, OR",0,2,,5.0,1/23/2017,"They made a mistake on my wife's order by delivering her meal to the wrong table. (It happens, no big deal). The waiter, assistant manager, and manager all apologized, and handle the situation very professionally.  We plan on going back, great food."
Kelly B.,"Eagle, ID",16,3,,2.0,11/30/2016,"The food as always is consistent and excellent. Our waitress was great. My complaint is with the hostess today. My husband and daughter and I went there today at 12:30 and asked to be seated next to another couple (one table apart) in the bar area. They were the only couple in there. She said, ""No, I don't have a waitress for that area.""  This is right when a waitress was helping this couple and she moved us to a single booth in the bar. I looked at here and said, ""That doesn't make any sense. You are telling me that there is no waitress for this whole bar areas? Who is waiting on that couple?""  She was very angry and it was a power control trip for her. I was shocked. ""No, she said.  ""I don't.""  I said, ""Well, I am not sitting at that booth and just stood there.  She stood there and then grumbled, ""Well okay, go ahead.""   We are longtime customers there and have never been treated so rudely.  She had black wavy hair should length, brown eyes around 5' 5"".  Very rude. I should have gotten her name.  Even my husband was being kind to her asking politely and she just brushed us off.  I could not believe how rude she was. Our waitress was excellent.  Next time I will get her name."
Karen C.,"Boise, ID",199,114,1060,4.0,12/7/2015,"Well, it's a chain. So you're going to get the full chain experience. However, the Pasta D'Vinci remains, hands down, my very favorite chain dish. I love the Boise location, the patio is fantastic! Nothing ""special"", but, hey, sometimes you just want consistency."
Sarita N.,"Nampa, ID",24,19,2,4.0,12/3/2016,"My husband ate here last night and have decided we will come back more often for dinners. I ordered the very simple sounding Herb Crusted filet of salmon and was blown away! The presentation was beautiful. The salmon over the mashed potatoes was the top of a jellyfish and the ""tentacles"" were the asparagus! The lemon sauce made my taste buds sing and I have NEVER had a salmon cooked so perfectly. It was so moist and tender. Kudos to the chef on that masterpiece! My husband had the Chicken Bellagio and that's what I'm going to get next time I ago. Another seriously top-notch dish! The wait staff was solid (and sported lots of tattoos!) and I love the atmosphere in there. The lighting is gorgeous, in my opinion, although I did notice a nearby customer using the flashlight feature on his phone to read the menu! As always, the cheesecake didn't disappoint.  We will definitely be back!"
Drew C.,"Boise, ID",87,160,157,5.0,11/10/2016,"Cheesecake Factory what else can I say? Lol. Everything is massive here from the cheesecake slices, portion sizes and even the menu is massive like a huge book. There menu has so much to offer I try to find something new every time I go. So this time I had the spicy New Orleans pasta. I actually found it last minute boy I was glad o did it was delicious!! It comes with a nicely breaded Parmesan chicken and the sauce is perfect the heat doesn't overwhelm you/take away from the flavors of the dish. I only ate half I mean you can't not eat here and not get Cheesecake lol. Our waitress was very attentive and was right on the with the water and even went the extra mile she put our slices of cheesecake in to-go containers so we'd be ready to go and since we only planned to eat half. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake-omg that was incredible!! Do yourself a favor grab a slice before it's gone!! If your looking for a nice night out either for just desert or for dinner this is the place!!"
Kristina M.,"Boise, ID",295,191,88,4.0,4/11/2016,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, so I've never understood the hype.  This location is near my office, so my boss recently treated me to lunch here.  The staff was wonderful! They were all very friendly, attentive, and quick. It was a gorgeous day, so we opted to sit out on the patio, which was just lovely.  The menu was expansive - like, excessively so - but it gave me a lot of options to choose from, as I'm limiting/excluding certain foods from my diet currently.  I ended up ordering the Grilled Chicken Lettuce Wraps - Mexican style. YUM! I was a little disappointed with the small amount of chicken in each one, but the flavor was incredible. I could have eaten another plate of them.... or two.  It's a little on the expensive side, which I think will be the only hindrance on future returns. But, I'll certainly be trying that famous cheesecake down the road.."
Jennifer H.,"Mountain Home, ID",11,13,1,5.0,2/25/2017,Yesterday my husband and I ate at this location for lunch .. the food was awesome and we had the nicest waiter .. he was super nice .. thank you ..
Moises E.,"Nampa, ID",25,67,114,2.0,3/3/2016,Keep coming back for the food and not service. Not trying to sound negative but it seems like every time we come in service gets worse. A huge pet peeve is that if you come in at 11am for lunch they will cram you in the back corner with everyone who comes in instead of utilizing the entire restaurant. Today we were given a broken glass to drink out of that was extremely sharp and they did not offer to bring us a new one.  The last time I was given a piece of shrapnel in my sandwich. I love the food here I hope this gets reviewed by upper management.
Taylor H.,"Livermore, CA",168,8,3,1.0,10/23/2016,"I came in before work alone and sat at one of the high tables by the bar, somebody approached and I told him I was waiting for my mother. I spent 30 minutes sitting at this table watching the tables next to me being helped trying to make contact with the SEVERAL waiters buzzing around... after 30 minutes and nobody checking on me or taking my order I just had to walk out because I was out of time. I've had poor service in restaurants before, but this is the first time I've ever had ZERO service. So ridiculous and embarrassing!!!"
Scott T.,"Boise, ID",1,13,1,4.0,7/11/2017,"Had some friends in town last night and we met them, like we always do, at this place. I usually avoid big chains but I have come to really appreciate the Cheesecake Factory. They have an extensive menu, the food is prepared well, is tasty, served promptly, and is hot. The service is excellent -- they must train their staff extremely well. And the prices are totally reasonable. If anything the weakest part of the meal was the Cheesecake itself. But, as a chain they continue to impress me -- well at least this one place does, I have not been to others. I totally recommend this Cheesecake Factory! [BTW -- as was recently in the press, and the subject of lawsuits, we also experienced the inflated tip suggestions on our bill. We split the bill 50/50 across two credit cards but the suggested tips on the bill were based on the whole amount. Luckily we noticed it at the time and didn't make the mistake of overtipping. SHAME ON CHEESECAKE FACTOR FOR THIS DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. THERE IS NO POSSIBLE EXCUSE FOR IT.]"
Elizabeth R.,"Boise, ID",0,9,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"Last time I came here our service was so horrible and we tried talking to a manager but he didn't care, but when we left a review stating what we went through then they decided to care and offer us a gift card. Why not care the first time? Anywho, I decided to give them another chance and I wish I didn't. The food is not even good I would rather have chick fila, the bread and cheesecake are the only good part. Once again our server was terrible. I will never come back here."
Julia L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",73,120,127,3.0,1/24/2015,"Came in for dinner with my boyfriend, we started off with mai tais and an appetizer. The drinks were good, (although not too stiff for their 10$ a piece price point). I understand that upscale restaurants often don't list the prices of their cocktails, but come on.. We are talking about a chain restaurant that shares walls with mall stores. I'd like to see how much I'm dropping on one drink without having to ask. So that was a little annoying, but our food was tasty enough. We had the buffalo blasts app, and I ordered the farfalle pasta with chicken and garlic and my bf ordered the Kobe beef burger with a salad. We both got cheesecake to go and it was decent, but really for how much everything cost us it could have been a bit better. Especially at a place named for cheesecake, lol. Anyways, next time we want to spend nearly 100$ on one meal we'll go to The Melting Pot or Chandlers."
Cindy S.,"Boise, ID",2,2,4,4.0,5/18/2016,We were a group of people and had very good experience visiting the place. Service was quick and food was quite decent for a chain of restraunt.
Nancy C.,"Houston, TX",96,167,71,2.0,7/10/2016,"What you'd expect of an enormous chain restaurant, minus the service snafus.  Appetizer was taken off the check since, well, i didn't want my appetizer after my meal.  I was more or less pretty pleased having a lunch date here with my little one until my husband texted me, as he was having lunch at Momofuku.  What a buzzkill."
Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",799,1037,4140,3.0,11/13/2013,"Just like every Cheesecake Factory I've been in, this was a good experience.  Always love the atmosphere, the awesome bread, the passion fruit tea and the very good service.   Favorite part of our meal was when my precious daughter in law (who recently had a baby) said it was the best meal she'd had in a long time.  (she had the seared tuna salad).     That being said, I had the shrimp scampi, herb crusted salmon combo and it was beyond rich.  Is it really necessary to bread and fry the shrimp before dousing it in a ton of butter?  (uh, don't answer that)...and the potatoes would have done so much better with less fat, also.     Husband's fried shrimp was not the best.  I know because I tried it.  He didn't complain however, as he was busy with his new grandbaby.   Steak-lover in our group seemed pleased with his steak and said it was cooked right.   Everyone agreed that the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake was right as right can be!"
B G.,"Lehi, UT",1,36,1,3.0,9/21/2016,The food was good enough... the lighting was awful.  Not sure why the lighting is so bad. Maybe they forgot to pay the power bill.
Lori S.,"Meridian, ID",28,12,,4.0,10/23/2016,"We went for lunch and our service was amazing.  The fish and chips were fresh and tasty.  The cheese cake was delicious as well.  Pretty spendy, but worth ever bite."
