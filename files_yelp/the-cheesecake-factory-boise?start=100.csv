Richard R.,"Oxnard, CA",102,196,62,4.0,1/22/2013,"The service was top notch and the food was really great.  Had an issue with a drink ordered, but the waiter and manager handled it professionally.  Wait time was a little long, but guess it is to be expected on a Friday night."
Bethany B.,"Boise, ID",0,16,5,2.0,5/5/2015,Sat down and our table was sticky and had food all over it and there were CHUNKS of food all over the bench from the previous diners still. Literally we wiped off the bench in front of the hostess who was seating us...clearly she had to of seen all the food on the seats but did nothing. Just watched us wipe it off. Disgusting. Then had to ask them to come wipe our table down again. Waiter forgot to bring my daughters juice until we had to ask 20 min after we all got our drinks and she never got the water we asked for. I also asked for another water since I gave her mine and that took about 25 min to get. Food took forever to get and was nothing spectacular. Ordered my daughter a grilled cheese which was cold when it arrived to the table. Pretty disappointing dining experience. Wish we had gone elsewhere...
D T.,"Boise, ID",2,52,3,4.0,8/4/2014,"had a salad, turkey sandwich, and dessert, they brought me the wrong sandwich but I got it later and the manager comped the my entree.  That was nice of her to do and I thanked her also. The manago key lime pie is the bomb and was the the only memorable thing about the meal.  Nice decor and a nice bar also."
Newt B.,"Star, ID",0,16,1,4.0,9/2/2015,"Lunch for 4 on 9/2...  There was a salad (chicken/avocado); spicy chicken on brown rice; something like Tuscan chicken from the skinny menu (which is almost un-American at the cheesecake factory) and huevos rancheros. As typical, service was good; the server (big dude with a thick beard) did a nice job.  Also as par norm, it takes a bit longer than you'd like to get your meal and the floor manager did come around and say...sorry about the wait, your food will be up shortly.  The food was typical CCF food, huge portions of well flavored food.  The salad actually looked killer and I would order that next time.  The spicy chicken wasn't the best, it was the same general's chicken recipe you get at any local Chinese restaurant...so nothing to knock your socks off there.  The skinny thing looked o.k. and the person eating it liked it and the huevos rancheros looked really good and the person eating it said it was. Good food, nice atmosphere, good service...I would say go there..."
Marshall P.,"Boise, ID",0,4,5,5.0,9/1/2014,Had a great lunch today. Lindsey was a fantastic server and the food was excellent.  Make a special trip to go to this restaurant.
Christopher J.,"Eagle, ID",0,24,,5.0,2/17/2014,"We stopped by on Saturday evening for a small celebration.  Fortunately, a couple of us went there early to get a table.  Over an hour wait, wow ok our plan worked out but we really didn't want to cruise the mall for an hour until the rest of the party arrived.  As it turned out timing was perfect.   Had the Jamaica Black Pepper Shrimp, potato soup and the 30th anniversary cake.  Fabulous food, exceptional service always attentive and took care of our needs without being intrusive.  Staff also sang a great Happy Birthday.  Only minor thing was I should have either ordered cake or cheese cake.  Didn't go for the confused desert."
Marcia G.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",45,242,150,5.0,6/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory always has something to fill your hungry tummy. We sat at the bar and has some appetizers. The service was so amazing. Our server was so nice and even offered me a warm wet towel to clean my ""sticky fingers"" from my appetizers. I was impressed!!  Potatoes bravas=YUMMMMMMMM!!"
Mary M.,"Mountain Home, ID",0,2,,1.0,1/4/2015,What a joke.  Sat for 20 minutes with no server even talking to us.  Manager offered a gift card for a return visit.  Why would we go back when we did not get to eat today.
H D.,"Independence, OR",8,6,2,5.0,9/1/2012,"My husband ordered the lemon and herb roasted chicken and it was AMAZING!  The sauce was very tangy:). I ordered sheppards pie, which I had never had before, it was very good:) Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to order as the menu is GIGANTIC! Lastly, but not least, make sure you don't leave without some cheesecake, it's amazing!"
Ophelia M.,"Milwaukee, WI",1718,591,2048,3.0,1/7/2009,"Is it a big chainish type place?  Yes.  Would I rather have been dining at an independently owned restaurant featuring an intimate setting and personal service?  Absolutely.  That being said, went to dinner here with a group of six, and found it to be better than I had anticipated.   What I liked:   Firstly, they rock a fine cocktail (If I were rating the cocktails, absolutely four stars--I would definitely stop off here for an after mall shop cocktail sometime).  Not only that, but, my dining companion and I upgraded the vodka in our cocktails from the house to Belvedere and from what I could ascertain were charged very minimally for the more expensive vodka (don't know if it was an accident?  We each had a few, so the accident was made repeatedly, in that case).  Dinner was decent.  Wasn't wowed, but wasn't disappointed either.  I had the Portobello sandwich, which was well made with fresh mushrooms.  The fries were fine (not memorable...but fine).  The cheesecake was delicious.  They have a slew of varieties and offer an ample slice (we had some left over to take home).    What I didn't like: First, our group of six were seated at an overly large round table--seriously, it was so big we could hardly converse. Secondly, our entire section reeked of fish.  So much so, that immediately we unanimously decided NOT to order any fish (ummm...ya smell fish?  It's not fresh).   Finally, no fry sauce--this is Boise!  Ya gotta have the sauce! Overall: Go for the cocktails, stay for the cheesecake.  Or, like someone else mentioned, their menu is huge so if you're going in a group with varied tastes, definitely a solid choice."
Kelly W.,"Boise, ID",77,49,,4.0,3/27/2014,"Yes this is just another link of the chain restaurant, the food here is GREAT. The Salmon is one of my favorite dishes - I'm not a big fan of ordering fish that I haven't cooked myself, but it's very well cooked (I usually order the barbeque salmon). The only thing that keeps this from being a perfect 5 stars is the price of the wine. Really, you can easily spend about $30 a bottle, so keep your eye out on that. Also, they can't seem to keep managers for some reason (although it doesn't really seem to affect the overall feeling of the place). The weekend nights usually bring you over an hour wait, so call ahead and make reservations. Overall, the restaurant is an excellent experience with good food and cool ambience."
Tiffany B.,"Hebron, KY",31,13,3,5.0,3/15/2014,"We've been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and love the good.  Portions are quite large so bring your appetite or be prepared to take some home.  I will have to say this particular location in Boise is the friendliest of all I have been too. Our server was was great, friendly and accessible but not overbearing."
Curt P.,"Mountain Home, ID",1,16,,3.0,1/17/2015,"The food was good, not great.  But in my opinion, the restaurant as a whole is way over priced in comparison to getting great food for less at one of the other many options that Boise has to offer."
Tina M.,"Hayden, ID",7,11,18,5.0,2/17/2012,"Excellent service! Our waitress was honest about her likes and dislikes in a respectable way. Tried the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. DELICIOUS!!! Very big portions. Not greasy, not too heavy. Also had the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Another great recommendation. I debated between that & Key lime or Vanilla Bean. I will definitely go back!"
Lam B.,"Lafayette, CA",0,7,1,1.0,2/5/2015,Waited 45 minutes for food.  Kitchen staff was incompetent.   Very poorly run and not deserving of the name.  Expect better from this chain.
Danielle B.,"Meridian, ID",26,44,3,5.0,8/29/2012,I love coming here!  the service is great and the food was fabulous.  The decor is neat and the bar was very well maintained and open for people to see the bartenders at work.  Bring whoever you want here for good times and good eats.
Wayne Y.,"Boise, ID",3,6,1,4.0,3/15/2013,"I'm a fan of the bar..been searching for the ultimate lemon drop, they make one that's a double with a little extra sugar that pretty good and the cheesecake isn't bad either..."
Doug D.,"Meridian, ID",15,273,39,4.0,10/16/2012,My first review was three stars and I find myself going back on regular occasions therefore I am revising my review to four stars.   They now have a skinny menu that is fantastic!
Scott J.,"Boise, ID",3,14,,1.0,1/2/2009,"Disgusting. I guess I should add more, but I think that sums it up.  I know, what should I expect, the place is called ""the cheesecake factory"", but I went there because I had a gift card.   My wife and I both ordered the 'pizza and a salad' lunch.  The salad was okay, about what you would expect for a chain, but the pizza was covered with imitation cheese that tasted like plastic, gross mushrooms from a can, etc.   We should have expected this, as the menu is fifty pages long, and whenever there are that many items on a menu it should be obvious that the place uses non-fresh everything and is marginal at cooking everything. Please Boise, veto this place, it is not what we want coming into town."
Randy S.,"Bend, OR",40,201,26,3.0,4/17/2012,"Had lunch while travelling, the place was empty for its size, but it took 15 minutes to get a seat, then the service was slow.  The food portions are large, the food is prepared correctly.  The staff needs an education on people skills and the waitress's and waiters need to tend to the clientele not themselves."
