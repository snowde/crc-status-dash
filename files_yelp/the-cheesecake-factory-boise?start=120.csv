Sarah B.,"Boise, ID",8,126,23,4.0,7/17/2011,"I feel like I shouldn't like this restaurant so much because it's a corporate chain, but I do!  Consistent food and services.  This is a well trained staff."
Chris W.,"Boise, ID",3,34,12,5.0,12/15/2011,I always have great service and food here. I know its a little $$$ but you do get a lot of food for the money. I have tried lots of things here and will not grip over any of the food. This is a must go to place.
Sarah B.,"Boise, ID",1,4,1,1.0,6/30/2011,"Great place to go with a large group... Wrong!  They will NOT take reservations for large parties! You cannot even call ahead. I asked for a party of 7 tonight at 7. The manager said no. Then they suggested I call to see how busy they are tonight before I come. No, the call will not help with getting a table - it will just let us know how long we will likely wait. They will only help us when the whole party is there. What the heck!  We will go somewhere else at 7 - with a reservation!"
Gloria C.,"Boise, ID",4,47,4,4.0,1/21/2008,"It's not about the cheesecakes, it's about the sweet corn tamale cakes on the appetizer menu.  OH YEAH.  Fairly good cocktails, be aware entrees will be huge, so 'lunch portions' is a good plan. You'll have a box at the end in any case, really.  Seating slow at peak times, which is Sunday Brunch here in Boise. They apparently don't do reservations after 12pm on Sundays, so if you need a large group seated, have a member go and get on the list. We needed seating for 14 (three were kids) over the holidays, and expected something of a nightmare, but were attracted by the menu's variety as we knew some members of our party were picky (in various ways, such as being diabetic).  We were actually seated reasonably quickly because we called ahead to warn, sent a representative to wait, and all showed up fairly quickly when they called us. Service good, menu large/extensive, yes it's a chain, and it's ridiculously popular here in Boise judging by busyness."
Erin T.,"Fairfax, VA",249,172,32,3.0,1/25/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is so overrated to me.  It was nice that they brought it to Boise though.  The menu is extensive but I've never tried any dish that made me fall in love.  I will say that the apple martinis are really good and plus you have the awesome cheesecakes. However, if you're going out with a group and no one can decide what type of restaurant to go to Cheesecake Factory would be good.  Everybody can surely find something they'd want to order. For the most part, just go there for dessert and drinks.  Skip the food."
C B.,"Caldwell, ID",0,20,,4.0,7/17/2013,"Service was really good.  I had the Renee;'s Special.  I didn't really care for it.  It was mostly salad and soup.  I don't like the Cheesecake Factory salad anyway because of the bittter greens in it.  The soup was barley...just not my favorite.  The Chicken Salad sandwich was O.K.  I am still giving 4 stars because I know I would have been happy with my regular...the Mushroom Burger.  By the way, drinks are a whopping $2.95.  However, they didn't mind when I asked for a to go cup."
Johnny O.,"San Francisco, CA",103,285,55,4.0,8/1/2007,"Love 'em or hate 'em, its everything a Cheescake Factory should be. If you have never been to one, trust me Idaho, you're gonna love it!! Near the mall. Since its Idaho, there's free parking everywhere!!!!"
J. K.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",6,142,,4.0,5/18/2010,"If you are a fan of warehouse-style dining (big open space, loud, busy atmosphere, same food at each location), it's hard to beat CCF. It had been ages since I wandered into one of this chain's restaurants, longer still for the food and not the tasty martinis. Say what you will about the food. Yes it's chain food, and yes it's probably not the healthiest choice out there. That said, we were pleasantly surprised when our food arrived and it tasted - and appeared - like it had been prepared by someone that actually cared about what they were serving. I've been to CCFs in more metropolitan areas, and ones in more chi-chi areas - but Boise's has them beat in food prep and taste. But what really made the Mrs. and I enjoy our meal was our server - Amy K. It was obvious that she enjoys the fact that her job brings a new set of people to her every hour, and it was very apparent that she sees it as an opportunity to make a new set of friends for that time. She was very helpful, happy to be there, and as our meal went on, very personable and conversational. Not your typical ""How you doing, ready to order, how's the food, thanks for coming"" that you'd expect from a place like this. I honestly feel like she really cared about us and our meal, and if we walked in there tomorrow (two months after our actual visit), she'd remember us.  If I owned the place, I'd either put her up front greeting people, or put her in charge of making sure everyone on the floor has the right attitude. Her service quite honestly made the experience better, and is the reason for my writing this review."
andy a.,"Twin Falls, ID",1,12,,4.0,2/18/2009,"Thanks to a gift card we made it to The Cheesecake Factory in Boise. Our Sunday dinner was pleasantly good. We tried the sweet corn tamale cakes, and they were tasty, a bit mushier than I expected. We had a variety of dishes. From pasta to pizza to sandwiches nobody seemed to be disappointed with a choice. The service was outstanding. The waiter, Will or Bill, made the experience a blast."
Rose B.,"Boise City, ID",2,87,90,4.0,12/28/2009,"As far as chains go, this is a good one. This was one of the only places open on Christmas eve. We had some wine and an appetizer. Which were good but what we really wanted was the cheesecake. I had a Key Lime Cheesecake and he had a Red Velvet Cheesecake.  We also got two more slices to go."
Jim K.,"Salem, OR",0,4,,4.0,5/28/2010,"Read J.K.'s review and we are staying right near the CCF so we thought we'd give it a try. Our first time at a CCF so we really didn't know what to expect. My wife had the Shepherd's Pie and I ordered the Chicken Bellagio. Both dinners were served in a very timely manner and were perfectly prepared. The food was hot and attractive in appearance. The meals were both delicious. And, there is a LOT of food. Now for the real treat. Again, following J.K.'s advice, we asked if Amy was working when we came in. She was and we asked to be seated in her station. We were escorted to a table for two. Amy appeared promptly and is everything J.K. described. We told her about her celebrity status on Yelp and she was quite surprised. After we were seated, it became obvious that there was a party of 10 to be seated right next to us. Amy suddenly appeared and asked if we would like to move to a booth instead. Given my hearing difficulties, that was an offer too good to refuse. She immediately bussed the just vacated booth and moved us over. Everything about Amy is just as J.K. stated. She is a first rate server and a real credit to CCF. I don't know about any other CCF servers since this was our first visit, but I would love to encounter Amy at every restaurant we visit. Thanks, Amy. And if anyone from CCF is visiting this site, find Amy and clone her. She is truly a treasure."
Jason W.,"Boise, ID",23,12,9,4.0,6/3/2007,"The appetizer was great!!  The avocado spring rolls!  My entree was pretty decent..mahi mahi with a mango chutney all sitting on a huge helping of mashed potatoes.  The decor was almost like a casino!  The staff was decent.  I can't get that appetizer dish out of my mind though.  Also, a bit pricey.  Too full afterwards...no room for the cheesecake!!  I'd go back for the Avocado spring rolls"
