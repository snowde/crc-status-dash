Jeremy L.,"Boise, ID",5,45,29,5.0,7/21/2015,I enjoyed eating here with my wife.  The service was awesome thanks Veronica and the food was delicious.  I was so full I had no room for cheese cake!  Also any business that donates to veteran events like this one has are a 5 star in my book!  I appreciate any businesses who supports and continues to support our veterans who have served our country.  I would recommend this place and will keep returning.
Danielle L.,"Boise, ID",14,16,6,2.0,6/13/2016,"My husband, son, and I visited the Cheesecake Factory and were unfortunately very disappointed. Our waiter was very friendly but checked in on us way too frequently. So much so that we felt very rushed and a little uncomfortable. Our conversations were constantly interrupted and as we rarely go out to dinner, it was frustrating to have this special time feel so hurried. There were plenty of open tables. I ordered the French Dip sandwich and was surprised to see that for $14, it came on a hamburger bun! My husband's small generic beer was $6.25. He normally pays $4 at the local brew pub for excellent craft beer. We ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and it was a disappointment as well: half the size of the pieces we saw other patrons in the restaurant enjoying. For $8, I should not have that tiny of a piece especially since this is the Cheesecake Factory."
Carmine C.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,20,1,1.0,12/5/2016,"Wow, the menu prices are really high now. So, if you think you can go in the appetizer page and find something reasonable, forget it. Appetizers are almost as much as full menu entrees. We ordered the fish tacos and Cuban sandwich. Tacos were okay but sandwich was very salty. Our bill was $31.15. I gave the waitress two twenty dollar bills. She took the money and never came back. A $9 tip? That would be a 30% tip without even asking. I had to find the woman and ask her to bring back the change. Got hit on both ends....high prices and aggressive tip-greedy servers."
Leah M.,"Meridian, ID",17,92,284,4.0,11/10/2014,"Had great lunch with the girls that included my ""standard"" Miso salmon over mashed potatoes (vs the rice that doesn't always seem to be right) but the salmon cooked perfectly as usual.  Everyone else's lunch very good. ..orange chicken with sweet potato fries, Cashew chicken salad (honestly the chicken was forgotten but promptly brought out) the waitress was ok...she had a grenadine explosion on the front of her white outfit (not bad just little spatters) but oddly the rest of her looked kinda dirty..weird..like rolled out of bed and put yesterday's clothes on. .the apron pretty gross..anyway..food very good just very surprised at cleanliness of waitress (who had no name tag and didn't announce her name). Thank goodness for the shared lemon raspberry & red velvet cheescake; divine! Made everything right!"
Angie S.,"Pullman, WA",13,30,8,2.0,7/10/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory usually had great food and great service. Today we had neither. The crab bites tasted good but were cold. The spinach and cheese dip was horrible. Too much spinach and not enough cheese. So so bland. The chips were stale. When we sent it back, they didn't even ask why. Drinks ran and out and getting refills was difficult.  2 stars are because the cheesecake still tastes ok."
Alicia W.,"Boise, ID",101,100,8,2.0,5/18/2015,"I'm not a fan of this place.  I've heard a lot of hub-bub about the Cheesecake factory and how great it is butttttt...I don't see it. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because our server was AMAZING and the Lemoncello cake was really good. But the food was terrible, and so was the seating. I never realized how important it is to be comfortable when you eat until I came here. We were seated in the corner booth closest to the hostess area. Now when I think of a booth I think of comfy, lush seating. NO. It was harder than sitting on the ground. It hurt!!! I had to sit on my sweater in order to stay because my butt AND my back were KILLING me within the first 10 minutes. And I'm only 25 years old, so I cant imagine older folks trying to settle in and have a good meal here.  Our server was incredible. He was very attentive and tried his best to help answer our questions about their ridiculously HUGE menu....there are more than 12 pages...and most of them are advertisements...Yup. That's what I want while I'm eating, to look at advertisements for other places in town. What is this, Las Vegas!? No. It's Idaho.  First we ordered the Crispy Crab wontons as an appetizer. I should have assumed that a restaurant that had everything from Chinese to Mexican would be a jack of all trades and a king of none... The wontons themselves were flavorless and chunky. Not what I look for when I'm eating a cream cheese and crab wonton. The dough was cooked too long so it had a slightly burnt taste too it and it was way too thick to begin with. The sauce was really runny and was not sweet and sour but more of a soy sauce and sweet...not tasty.  For dinner I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and a side salad with ranch. My salad came out with the ""wontons"" and the salad was wet. They had pre-dressed the salad too so all the dressing was runny and the leafs were all soggy...all I kept thinking was ""I'm spending $6 on a salad that I could have made for 25cents at home..and it would be tastier.""....sad thoughts.  Next....the Carbonara...sigh. What a disappointment. The sauce was like water. I know why they give you a spoon...it's so you can pick up the milky watery sauce from the bottom of the bowl and spoon it over the pasta...yum...*sarcasm*. The pasta was cooked well but there was no flavor but fat coming through to me. It just tasted horrendous.  My friend ordered the Garlic Noodles upon recommendation from our server. YUCK. I was so grossed out by the flavor profile of this. It was like eating the remnants of an old gym sock. Oh and also - if no one tells you, when you order chicken on your pasta, there will be bones. No one told us this. We had some fun with that. :/ Again, like I said, our server was great and the cake we ate was delicious. I will go back for dessert, and nothing else. And it will be to-go because the seating there is horrendous."
Colleen G.,"Bonners Ferry, ID",11,40,31,4.0,6/29/2015,"We stopped in after a rough day, and they were wonderful!! We had some special requests and they got our order spot on! If you are vegetarian, then this is the best chain restaurant to get a veggie burger. It is not a frozen, processed bun. They make it at the restaurant and it has a LOT of flavor!! Loved it!!   Make sure you enjoy the company of your party, because the building doesn't have very good cell signal, and you won't be able to bury your face in your smart phone. Not recommended for blind dates! We told the waiter that they need to get wi-fi, because we couldn't make our hotel reservations.  He offered to let us use his phone from another carrier. We declined, be were very appreciative of the gesture.  Last but not least, don't leave without some cheesecake.  They're all good!! P. S. Please let me know if they ever get wi-fi, and I'll change my rating to 5 stars."
Rachael A.,"Garden City, ID",0,12,,4.0,12/16/2016,"My coworkers and I came here for our company Christmas party and the service was great and of course the food was amazing. Gotta get my go-to avocado egg rolls and the baja tacos. Then of course the cheesecake came and I had to take it to go but nonetheless yummy the day after. We played a game out our table and even though we were kinda loud and obnoxious, the employees were having a good time watching us get through it. This is our second year and we love it."
Andrea D.,"Meridian, ID",25,48,12,4.0,3/3/2016,Cheesecake Factory is my fallback. We are never disappointed with the food or service.
LeeAnn C.,"Buhl, ID",161,299,172,4.0,7/21/2014,"I have had two really excellent experiences at the CCF recently! The first one, was a delish brunch on Sunday! Peach Bellini + Monte Cristo French Toast. Does it get any better than that? I think not! You have to try the french toast! So delish.  I brought my brother and his girlfriend here for a dinner & we had a great time. Our server Isaiah, was amazing! He gets a big shout out. He made our whole dinner experience great. More peach bellinis & laughs all around! Thank you for making our time together even better! We love sitting outside & the food is always great!"
Jon A.,"Boise, ID",35,14,64,5.0,2/20/2016,I Love This place. It is one of my favorite places. My Ex Fiance' Ashlynn and I would eat here a lot before I lost her in a horrifying Car Accident we were both in 8 Months ago. I try to stop by here frequently even if just for a Slice of Pie. To remember her. The Staff are great and the atmosphere friendly. The first time we came was because we were Fans of the Show the Big Bang Theory. Please stop by during happy hour for half priced Apps.
Lydier H.,"Pasadena, CA",329,186,499,3.0,7/18/2015,Love this food chain. Taste has always been consistent. I've been to least five different locations. Ordered same food. They've never let me down so far.
Kyle C.,"Kent, WA",22,97,116,4.0,1/28/2015,"Celebrating family on their last night in town and everyone wants something different. Been thinking of trying the factory for a while and figured this would be a good a time as any.  Cheesecake Factory gets a bad rap for a number of things, the first thing being the length of their menu. And yeah, it's the first thing I thought of when I heard we were going there, and yes it is very very long, but the staff there embraced it. They themselves referred to their menus as novels. Way to roll with the punches there Cheesecake Factory.  It was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday night. The food was great and the staff was sharp. The portions were perfect and it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Over all, I didn't have a bad time. I actually had a decently pretty good experience. You know this chain, you know what you're gonna get. It's the Olive Garden plus ten. Worth at least one shot."
Adrianna W.,"Boise, ID",42,23,9,4.0,11/19/2015,"I LOVE this place. The service isn't always great but their food is amazing! I get the same thing every time, Chicken Marsala. My mouth waters every time. I don't drink alcohol so often times I'll get a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiri, I know it's all sugar, but sometimes even a drink that's all sugar is hard to do. I've been here for birthday, anniversary, graduation dinners, SO good. Their only flaw I would say is they struggle taking care of big groups sometimes, and they are a little pricey. But for the BEST chicken Marsala in the valley, totally worth it."
Belinda B.,"Meridian, ID",0,13,3,2.0,2/8/2017,"We've been there several times since this location opened. We went last night at about 5 p.m. It wasn't busy at all and we ordered quickly, but ordered items that weren't our normal choices. My husband order fish tacos and I ordered the Shrimp Louie. It was strange when the meal came and my husband was given the fish and chips and I got a salad with 6 medium size shrimp down the center. Obviously my husband's order was just plain wrong, but mine was extremely disappointing. I've never had a Shrimp Louie with a few shrimp on top - generally it is a large portion of small, sweet bay shrimp, something for every bite of your salad. To say I was disappointed would be a major disappointment. When we finally caught the waitress to say that not only had my husband order fish tacos, but the fish and chips arrived with only catsup, no tartar sauce, she looked at us like we didn't know what he ordered. I know that is what he requested because it's not an item he usually chooses and I was a little surprised to hear it. But rather than apologize for a mistake, she acted like we had hurt her feelings even though he told her that he would eat the fish and chips. He could have requested that she correct the situation, but he chose to let it slide. We actually felt like had this been our first visit, we would have felt that we wasted $40+ for a really lousy meal. We've been there plenty of times before, but this could slow our rate of return visits really substantially."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,3/19/2014,"After our prior incident and sending the Corp. Office a copy of the Yelp review. AND: After 4 calls I made to them in the last two weeks / Finally a return call today: They made it right and sent their apologies along with an electronic gift card, via email. We hope to go back and have a better ""over all"" experience!"
Darren G.,"Eagle, ID",48,60,112,3.0,4/29/2015,Always too much food but it's great.  Less atmosphere and better food portions would be my focus.  Sometimes chains get too big and forget their customer service
Laurie M.,"Boise, ID",16,5,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Our family arrived at Boise Towne Square Mall location right before 5pm on a Saturday in February 2016. We were told 10 min wait and gave us the pager. We went just into the mall at the toy store and came back 15 min later, waited in sight of the host for another 15 min. still no page. We left for 5 min to walk around out front since the waiting area was now packed with about 30 people. I came back in site of the host again and stood there. At 45 min and watching several large groups leave,  I asked the host how much longer, and she said she had been calling for us and the pager must not have worked. So I guess she gave up and us?  Finally at 1 hour & 10 min they give us a table, only: 1 HOUR LONGER WAIT THEN THEY ESTIMATED!  Nothing for their mistake, no free drink or appetizer.  The only reason we stayed was because I had a $100 gift card for The Cheesecake Factory. I will never think of going with my family or relatives again as their wait time cannot be trusted. Their food is okay and prices very high, especially on drinks."
Jersey M.,"Eureka, NV",2,161,4,4.0,11/29/2015,"Seated promptly even though it was Black Friday and crowded.  Our server, Lisa C was very knowledgeable with the menu and made some recommendations that we were very happy with.  New to the area, we asked here about living there and she was extremely helpful as to where to live and dine. Tuna carpaccio was very tasty, herb crusted salmon cooked to perfection, stuffed chicken tortillas had great flavor.  I would definitely go back."
Kyla F.,"Payette, ID",27,66,11,4.0,1/3/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the same as all the rest... Beautiful building, good food. Last time I went I didn't love the server but that happens right? One thing I hate about it is the dark lighting at night, I'd like to be able to see my food a little more. All in all it wasn't my favorite experience (alright service and bad lighting) but I'll be back because the food is so good."
