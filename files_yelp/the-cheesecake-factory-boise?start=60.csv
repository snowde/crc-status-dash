Tom P.,"Boise, ID",0,9,,4.0,8/27/2015,My wife and I stopped in for dessert after finishing dinner at another restaurant.  Strawberry cheesecake hit the spot for me.  My wife had the Smores Cheesecake.  She was given a large portion and was not able to finish it all.  We have eaten dinner here in the past and have always had a great meal and great service.  Our waiter tonight was prompt and friendly.  We will head back soon for a date night soon.  Good job everyone.

Sabrina L.,"Boise, ID",356,48,82,1.0,9/4/2015,"So I have been here twice this week and both experiences were substandard (which is pretty sad considering the price point is mid-high.  One of the times, I went in and just wanted a light lunch, so I sat at the bar. The bartender watched me come in and sit down but was talking with someone who was apparently a friend. I waited for ten minutes as she passed by me not really doing anything but chatting. Finally I tried getting her attention by saying ""excuse me"", but it took me three times to get her to finally acknowledge me. Then I ordered a salad and a margarita. As I ordered, she rudely AND INCORRECTLY 'corrected' my pronounciation of the name of the salad. When my food came, the salad was a little bland (it had very few of toppings described on the menu. The margarita glass had so much ice packed into it that there was hardly anything in there and the whole drink was watered down and covered in condensation.  She also used table salt for the rim. Srsly, you'd think Cheesecake Factory could spring for something better..  The bartender didn't even wait for me to ask for my bill. She just threw the bill on the counter in a cup. Yes, inside of an empty glass, I kid you not. When I paid cash,  she didn't pick it up and return my receipt . Essentially, I needed to leave and couldn't even get my change, despite asking for it; which forced me to overtip against my will. I'm pretty sure that's stealing.  Then, when I was leaving, I went to the cheesecake counter and had a similarly crappy experience. I waited in line to order a piece to go. When I got to the counter, the lady acted impatient and rude. I ordered something out of the glass case and she rung up my order before informing me that I would have to wait for several minutes before they could open up a glass case, put a piece of cheesecake on there, and then hand it to me. Are you kidding me??!?? Instead, she chose to stand around and tidy up, chat with her co-workers and waste my time. Seriously?!?! What the heck?!?! I've never regretted eating out more! I paid for an overpriced lunch and also got treated horribly! Just wow! What a disappointment."
Lorene H.,"Smithfield, UT",3,33,16,3.0,7/30/2015,Busiest day of the year. I understand that. But when I've waited in line for 45 minutes to just get cheesecake and the guy at the register answers 3 phone calls before helping me - hmmmm. Not good customer service. Then he was rather rude about why he couldn't give me two pieces of cheesecake for the half price. Taking one home to a friend who is ill in bed. After waiting so long do they really think I'm not gonna just get both pieces and pay whatever price they charge?  As I'm leaving the line for just cheesecake is still out the door. Good thing the cake is so yummy.
Jerry P.,"Meridian, ID",0,8,,5.0,8/24/2015,"Went there with my wife on Saturday and had the Miso Salmon.  It was maybe the best Salmon I've eaten at a restaurant and my wife concurs.  Also, the waitress, ""Lisa"", was as good as it gets.  She is friendly, listens, and actually understands customer service.  She has recommended the Chicken Stuffed Tortillas, so we'll go back soon and give them a try.  If she says they are good, I believe it."
EJ L.,"Meridian, ID",0,14,,2.0,8/11/2016,"We've been fans of The Cheesecake Factory for several years, originally in Portland, OR area.  This Boise location provided the same menu with good service.  But...we just had lunch there, treating guests, and were very disappointed.  The service was slow, although the server was very nice, and the food was so-so.  The menu has changed, apparently, as some of our favorite items don't taste like they used to.  [corporate cut-backs?]  Not sure we'll return to The Cheesecake Factory since the prices are still high but the food quality just doesn't cut it.  Some complaints: silverware was smeared and spotted, looking not quite clean; one guest's chopped salad contained browned, tired lettuce, etc.; another guest's pasta dish tasted as if a lot of sugar had been added (crusted chicken Romano and pasta); and the flies were thick inside the restaurant...I was constantly batting flies away from my food (=ugh!).  The bill was $74 for four of us for a very mediocre and rather unpleasant meal! Got a nice response from a Cheesecake Factory representative (8/12/16) so we tried it again (9/3/16).  Had great service but the food still is not like it used to be.  This time Chicken Bellagio was ordered, a favorite for the past few years, and the chicken's breading was VERY spicy (hot), which it never was previously.  Two members of our party ordered a pasta dish (pasta with shrimp and sausage) and said it was over-the-hill spicy hot...and one of these people loves jalapeno-loaded foods!  Needless to say, the pasta was not enjoyed or eaten down!  I asked the server if they had had menu changes and he was adamant that they hadn't (said it might be a cook who was doing some changes...?); but I think he was a fairly new employee at this restaurant.  Even the cheesecake we ordered (four different types) was rather blah, compared to the flavorful selections of the past!  What in the world is going on at The Cheesecake Factory?  Guess we'll be avoiding this restaurant from now on!   The two stars' rating still stands!!"
Rebecca B.,"Nampa, ID",7,35,8,4.0,5/16/2015,"Always great food and dessert is never a disappointment! They have great pizza and Chicken Marsala, the Fish and Chips are also great! I love the Lemon Raspberry, Black Tie Chocolate Cake cheesecake, but the Tiramisu and Lemon Meringue are also delicious! Service is also excellent, always attentive and helpful! I would give 5 stars but the acoustics are terrible and between the noise and music unless you go in on off hours it's impossible to carry on a conversation with your dining companions without shouting. If they turned down the music it would be perfect!"
Amy H.,"Boise, ID",1,23,4,4.0,7/25/2015,"They have good gluten free pasta and an astounding selection of food. As with all Cheesecake Factories, I guess if the ""GF by request "" icon was just a little larger, it would be easier to sort through it all. But I am very grateful that they offer the great selection of gluten free meals that they do. The food was good, but this place has super uncomfortable booth benches. I have not encountered that in other Cheesecake Factory locations.  My first order came with my pasta undercooked. They gave me a salad so I'd have something to eat while my replacement meal cooked. When it came it was just fine. The manager made a point of checking on me after I ate to make sure all had worked out.  I think the uncomfortable seats and noise level were drawbacks, but the pasta was pretty yummy - and huge portions as well. My remaining gluten free pasta heated up quite nicely for lunch the next day!"
Erik P.,"Boise, ID",0,24,,4.0,6/6/2016,"OK, I want to hate Cheesecake Factory.  Chain, giant menu, with ads, in the mall, etc...  I can speak to their brunch that it is quite good.  Their patio is nice and reasonably insulated from the mall parking lot.  I have never had great service, but the service is, well, serviceable.  My last visit a table went unubused next to us for our entire meal, which is bad.  There are better local brunch options in Boise (Goldy's, The Griddle), but not that you can walk in to any time, get a table and full bar options and have a good meal.  Try the chilaquiles (get extra salsa verde and a lime) and you can split them between any two people with a reasonable appetite."
Phillip D.,"Meridian, ID",40,83,,4.0,5/7/2014,"I dont go here very often anymore. Its not that its not a good place, because it is. They just took my favorite dish of the menu. My wife loves it here and I know why. The decorations are nice, its clean and the servers that I have run into are super friendly. One thing that I love (I cant recall if its this one or not that does it) are servers that knell down to table level to take your order. I love this. I have only seen 1 restaurant do it. I think it makes servers seem more friendly.  There are a lot of places out there that are not clean, the wait staff are not user friendly, and the food is bad. When you find one that wins in all these categories, it makes me want to mark it as a keeper. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they took Carmel Chicken off the menu.  Carmel Chicken was like an upscale General Tso's Chicken. A really bad name for a really excellent dish. Speaking of the menu here, its huge. Its one of the biggest menus I have ever seen. How they pull off keeping so much food on hand and having cook staff able to cook each one so well, I have no clue. I am not a fan of Restaurant chains. But in the case of this place, I cant find any faults with them. I an not much of a drinker, but I do like an occasional cocktail. I have the Pina Colada here and its awesome.  Like another restaurant that I wont mention, this place knows how to make one without using a mix. On my last visit, I had the Mac and Cheese Burger. It might sound odd, but you need to have this. They burger is topped with their fried Mac and cheese balls and some of the sauce. The balls are crunchy and cheesy.  The burger is charbroiled. Its smoky and flavorful. If I was to give one negative, I would say that the cheese sauce over powers the burger a bit. But then again, its cheese! Is there such a thing as too much cheese? The other down side I will give is that its on the pricy side. The bill for the 3 of us (One of which is a 10 year old) was $40. A stretch if you are on a budget. But in my opinion, this place is worth the splurge. And dont even get me started on their cheese cakes. If you love Cheese cake, trust me, you will want to come here"
Lindsay R.,"Fresno, CA",1,19,16,1.0,2/21/2015,I'm writing this review in regards to the terrible service I received at this Cheesecake Factory location. when our waiter Robert approached us he seemed very solemn and mediocre. he wasn't excited to be working at the Cheesecake Factory as the waiters usually are. it was very disappointing since I don't live close to a Cheesecake Factory and I always look forward to getting to dine here when I travel to bigger cities. he didn't make our experience good he made it mediocre. it just made us feel really blah after we left the restaurant. the food was great as usual but the service we received was not the usual. disappointed.
Carmina B.,"Seattle, WA",38,180,68,1.0,2/5/2015,"This has to be the worst dining experience ever at a local Cheesecake. 15 mins wait for a table when many are available but not bussed. Very dirty water glass that was never replaced and a very long 48 mins wait for a pasta and chicken lettuce wrap dish. Unexplainable really, especially when the restaurant is more than half empty at 7:30 on a Thursday night. The manager could have done more than comp my pasta  and my toddler's mac n cheese knowing that I was tweeting my experience and had mentioned that I wanted to speak with them first, but he didn't seem to care. Perhaps that's all they can do because they're swamped with other complaints at that particular location and previous reviews on Yelp. Since it's a chain, it all boiled down to service as one should expect consistency in their food, no complaints there."
Dena F.,"Mountain Home, ID",11,5,,1.0,11/23/2015,"Don't order the salad and sandwich cuz, hello did you order a sandwich with that lettuce. Foods over priced and I just witnessed one of the table staff lay clean napkins on the floor then on a clean table for set up, that's nasty. The decor does not scream cheesecake to me,it screams don't set me under one of those light fixtures, they are scary. I guess next time I will stick to the food court."
Kimberly N.,"Meridian, ID",16,37,1,1.0,12/22/2013,"Food is awesome! ALWAYS.  What isn't awesome? Getting charged for a different tables bill and the manager Laurel arguing with me on the phone that she's ""too busy"" to get to a POS system and fix it. Heres the best part, gave her my number TWICE so that I could get a call back, and sure enough, Laurel didn't have enough time to call me back. Call again and spoke to a male manager, and he was AWESOME. Gave me the person to contact.  What makes me maddest? Not that the charge is STILL on my card 2 weeks later, not that Laurel has ZERO customer service skills, but that I called corporate TWICE and neither person I left a message for had the time to call me back. Sorry, your food is great, and if your customer service skills were great too... I'd support you. Alas, I'll eat elsewhere. Since you were too busy to call me back or  refund my money I'm conveniently too busy to give you any of my business. There are PLENTY of restaurants with great food that also have awesome customer service. I'd be empathetic of Laurel if she was even remotely human towards me, but it got personal on the phone and for that I say.. Get rid of her. Do your staff and your business a favor."
Chris H.,"Meridian, ID",286,190,1463,5.0,2/8/2014,Cheesecake Factory is excellent. Service is outstanding and food is alway on point.  Took the girls today for recognition lunch and they all had cheesecake before their lunch.  So I recommend this to everyone! Cheesecake before your lunch is the key to a great lunch.
Chryssa R.,"Boise, ID",39,112,18,5.0,4/29/2014,"I'd only been here once before (years ago) and was put off by all the huge, meaty dishes. So glad I went back! Their new ""skinny"" menu has some amazing vegetarian options. I had spring rolls, the pear/bleu cheese/caramelized onion flatbread, a glass of Syrah and of course, cheesecake. It was all delicious. They even brought a baby plate to keep my son entertained while we waited. But despite it being a busy Friday night, our service was prompt. I'm definitely looking forward to going back."
Kim E.,"Sacramento, CA",2,7,,5.0,7/30/2015,"So yea was pretty crazy tonight but my friend and I wandered into the bar area to try to find an open table there and this kind waiter told us one was coming open! Score. 3min wait ;) then Isaiah? (I hope that was his name... I'm seriously really bad with names...) bartender. Looks 19, haha  ;) he took really good care of us. Funny, attentive, fast, personable. Really made us feel at ease. Didnt feel rushed at all despite how busy it was. It's been awhile since I've had service that good. Haven't been to the cheesecake factory in along time but I'll Def be going back! Oh and the lemon meringue cheesecake!  Oh my word heaven!!!"
Lance W.,"Eagle, ID",85,14,9,3.0,12/14/2014,"Came here for my wife's birthday. I've been to other locations and had a good experience but not really here. The place was pretty empty, yet our server was hardly present and our food took a really long time to cook. Once it was here it was pretty good but not worth what we paid.  Sad to say but we probably won't be back to this location."
Vee B.,"Meridian, ID",5,11,,3.0,5/12/2016,Huge menu. Nice staff good food. No cel service in there restaurant so go here to get a break from your cel and you can really claim there calls never reached you. Nice to untether for an hour. Restaurant is at the mall so you can shop and then refuel. Oh and cheesecake. Oh my
Stacy L.,"McCall, ID",0,9,,1.0,2/15/2016,"My daughter and I went to the Cheesecake Factory this past weekend.  We were seated at a table about 3"" from a family who was super loud.  I could hardly talk to my daughter right across the table from me.  Right after we sat down I looked around and saw several booths available.  I asked to be moved to a booth so we could visit with each other ... We were REFUSED. I should have walked out, I wanted but my daughter wanted to stay. It wasn't because we were a table of two as I watched them seat each of those booths with couples.  Forget the Cheesecake Factory ... There are a lot of other places to eat who care about customer service."
