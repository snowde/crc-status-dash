Sissy F.,"Elko, NV",0,6,,5.0,4/29/2016,"Had some steak, potatoes, vegetables and it was amazing. Our waitress was AMAZING! She was very friendly, and helpful with the menu. It was delicious"
Jose R.,"Kansas City, MO",112,39,25,4.0,5/20/2014,"The service was excellent, our waiter was very friendly and patient with us. When we had questions he was quick to help with the answers ain't explaining the menu and giving recommendations. The good was well prepared and made just as ordered. I would come back again just for the service."
Holly H.,"McKinney, TX",0,16,12,1.0,11/29/2014,Very dirty. Not sure if this is because of the sprinkler issues just this week or what. My family and I were seated in the second booth as you walk in their door to the left. Our table had NOT been wiped down. There was actually catsup smears and crumbs all over it - I was disgusted. The window and vent were covered in dust and crumbs.... After having a great first visit to the WA Square Cheesecake Factory in OR we thought we'd give it a try here. Not impressed. To boot our bill was even more $$$ than OR AND we ordered the same thing..... Not sure why ID would be more expensive than OR.....We were there on 11/22/14. We will not be back... a bit grossed out.
Taylor W.,"Portland, OR",101,24,1,2.0,8/4/2014,"Simply put, The food was not good. I ordered the ""specialty salmon"" and it was over-salted and ultra fishy. Their only saving grace is the cheesecake. I will never go here for a meal again but I will surely return for another piece of cheesecake."
Brett G.,"Garden City, ID",0,25,,5.0,3/20/2016,"Great food and excellent service,my wife and I love a good burger and we did not expect them to be the best burgers in Boise,but hands down their quality meat and perfectly cooked burgers were amazing,makes other local burgers taste like fast food in comparison,highly recommend this place...."
Adan C.,"Boise, ID",117,22,,3.0,1/22/2014,"Not my particular style. Went during the holiday season, and why I don't know.  I don't care for the mall or the surrounding areas so I think I set myself up for failure with this visit. Service was decent, but nothing special. Food was likewise average, but nothing really stood out.  You would think with a menu as large as they have there would have been something that amazed me.   I know i should give it a second chance, but I just don't think I can bring myself to it."
Carrera A.,"Meridian, ID",17,38,3,2.0,9/15/2014,The food is standard chain restaurant food. I've been many times and will probably go again if it's the most convenient option. However I suggest asking not to be sat in Robert's section (a tall blonde gentleman). Not only was his service poor but his attitude was abhorrent. He actually got aggressive and confrontational with my husband when his tip reflected his bad service.
Becky D.,"Springfield, OR",97,1,,4.0,8/24/2013,"I loved my dining experience at The Cheesecake Factory. My husband and I are from out of state and we don't have these restaurants close to us, but you can be sure I will be eating in the Cheesecake Factory when I'm close.   Our waiter, Tyler was very pleasant and he seemed to have perfect timing when it came to serving us. The hamburger I had, was scrumptious.  It is so hard to find meats with flavor like when I was young. You could tell it didn't have preservatives because of the taste. The food was also presented so nicely on the plate. I felt the place was so pretty, too. I'm sure you can tell I was happy with my whole dining experience.  What a treat. I took some cheesecake to go and I'm looking forward to having it later. I must say, everyone on the staff was cordial as my husband and I left also. They said thank you and wished us a nice rest of our evening !  Kudo's to all !"
Ray R.,"Gooding, ID",0,7,,5.0,2/21/2016,"Our servers name was Michael. He was very polite, energetic, friendly with the guests. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to the younger generation. The atmosphere was relaxing & casual. The food tasted great, was perfect temperature and portions were great for the price. Cheesecake is amazing as well."
Lisa T.,"Meridian, ID",3,32,8,2.0,6/17/2014,"Today's visit was a real disappointment. The food took at least 45 minutes to arrive. They claim to have timed it at 1hr 4 min start to finish. I believe that may have been the time that the waitress entered our order, but she didn't get it into the system very fast. The burger served to me was completely charred on one side, in 3 pieces hidden under melted cheese. I believe they didn't want to have to start the order over when they knew it was messed up, so they tried to hide it, but even if that wasn't the case, the burger was really nasty tasting. The other 3 orders at the table were ""delicious"", and our server was very friendly and helpful. I still won't be going back any time soon because I just don't have 2 hours to sit around held captive in their restaurant."
Patty F.,"Boise, ID",26,59,,3.0,10/28/2014,"All CF are the same. As I recall, the BTS one has giggly girl servers who should learn how to wait tables and givevattention to diners.  I am selective about where I spend my dining out dollars. CF is average."
Stephen K.,"Boise, ID",15,15,,5.0,2/16/2015,"Received  excellent  service from Cerdaro and Chloe. They were. Both on point. Not only fast, efficient and friendly but had us cracking up laughing.the GM Don made himself readily available, which from my experience is rare. Bravo to Boise cheesecake  factory , I've been all over the country and Boise's  is the best one. And food so good ""you'll slap yo mamma."".lol"
Erika L.,"Idaho Falls, ID",1,67,2,4.0,3/22/2013,"This is my second time eating at this location.  The food is always good. The complimentary bread was hot and fresh and tasty. Both the chicken dishes we had were tasty and hot. As most people know, the serving sizes at Cheesecake Factory are really large so we had plenty to take home. The mashed potatoes were very good and my mango-lime cheesecake was tops.  Staff was nice, frequent check-backs. The wait was a little long, about an hour. But it was Friday night at about 7:30 or 8 pm and should be expected.  The only complaints would be that there was limited in-door seating in the foyer and we had to wait outside on benches in March for our table. Also the interior is pretty noisy."
Araminta S.,"Boise, ID",16,7,,1.0,8/23/2014,"The cheesecake is not that great! My sister's homemade cheesecake is 1000 times better with fresh fruit! This stuff taste like it's freezer burned and out of the package. Furthermore, their new spaghetti, on the new item menu for, 14.99! Are you kidding me? It tastes like it's two dollar spaghetti from a soup kitchen, yuck! Seriously I can't believe they would charge that much money for something that taste that disgusting. I will go buy the ingredients at Winco or Trader Joe's or grocery outlet and make spaghetti 10 times more tasty for way under $14 and serve nine people! What are the chefs thinking? they really need me to come in there and show them how to cook!"
Christie Ly G.,"Meridian, ID",11,47,52,4.0,12/13/2014,Fried grn beans and the seasoned edamame with an iced grn tea! Of course the bread basket and butter brought me in!
C M.,"Contra Costa, CA",125,111,12,4.0,3/8/2012,"WHY WAS THERE NO CELL SERVICE IN THIS RESTAURANT! Otherwise, food was delicious. I got the chicken salad sandwich and a baked potato soup. Yummy! I also tried the jambalaya, which was so freaking good, better than I've ever tasted. A little on the spicy side, but I love spicy! Waitress was super nice and helpful in making my  lunch selection. I got a coffee cheesecake. YUM! Really good, never liked this restaurant so much until now."
Mark Z.,"Meridian, ID",2,18,2,4.0,9/27/2015,First of all the staff was amazing. Yesterday I was here at the cheesecake factory. I ordered the build your own omelet with their amazing potato. Sadly the potatos were over cooked and hard as a rock. The waitress noticed I did not eat them after I had said how much I really liked them when I placed my order. She asked what was wrong? I had to tell her they were overcooked and hard as a rock and I could not even get my fork to go through them. She offered to bring more but at this time I was full and did not want a load of potatoes brought to me I was finished with my meal. She tried to provide something else soup or salad but as I mentioned I was full. She said well I will talk to the manager we need to do something about this. Totally her idea. Before I knew it the manager arrived and she even said I saw those they were hard as a rock that's not how they should be. She had took it upon herself to comp my breakfast for me which I did not expect. I have to say that this aggressive move to make sure I was a happy customer really got my attention. I will certainly be back this was not the norm and their food is amazing and so is the staff.
Courtney G.,"Enterprise, OR",0,6,,2.0,2/23/2014,"Food is good. Cheese cake is amazing! Service is terrible. We are from California originally and have been to several of the franchise locations there and were always pleased with our meal. The Boise location needs some major help with its service. The good is to the same quality but we have been here five times now and keep giving it another shot in hopes it will get better. Out of the five visits we only got a good server once and the other four were the worst we have had anywhere! One insulted us, another broke glass on our food and didn't offer to replace it, and the other two disappeared for over forty five minutes. So depressing because I love the cheese cake!!!!!"
Alan Y.,"Boise, ID",14,39,26,5.0,7/9/2014,Really nice looking place when you enter and you know they put in a lot of architecture work into it and it shows. I like to keep it simple and end up getting the strawberry cheesecake and it was really good. A lot better than what you get from a convenience store and it is expected from this place. They have a lot of different options when it comes to foods and desserts and from what I've seen they put in a lot of work to make everything look appealing to their customers. Perfect place to eat for really any occasion and I highly recommend it.
Callum S.,"Seattle, WA",4,150,7,4.0,8/30/2012,"Okay, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The menu is immense and everything I've tried on it is delicious. The atmosphere is great too. Feels very upper class almost.  The servers are very knowledgeable and easy to joke around with. My only complaint is that my waitress got my order wrong. They brought me the complete wrong thing. I don't know what she heard me say... I corrected them and they were happy to bring me what I ordered. Its just annoying to watch everyone else you're with start to eat while you're waiting. It's not going to deter me from returning or anything though."
