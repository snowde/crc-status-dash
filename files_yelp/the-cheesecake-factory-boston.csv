Tony C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,2,4.0,12/31/2017,Arrived at Boston last night and this is the only restaurant at 11:30 pm. Great service from the staff but the food were not as hot as we expected. Boston was freezing and the food were just warm. We ordered a burger and omelette with fries. The burger was tasty beef and the omelette was well fried with ham inside. Two dishes were well enough for two. Later we took away a chesscake and back to hotel for breakfast. We took it in the next morning and it still tasted good. Just one point to improve not hot enough for the food.
Ellen Y.,"Boston, MA",187,178,39,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'm genuinely upset. Cheesecake Factory is always a slow but good time, but I usually walk out feeling okay! Today was such a different story. We should have known the moment we walked in the back entrance! There were no signs indicating that we were at the back, and we had to awkwardly walk through the whole restaurant for the front.  We got there around 5:30, and was told 25 min for a table of 6. We were seated around 6:10, after I checked in with the hostess how long the wait would be. Our waiter took about 5 min to come to us the first time, and he seemed REAL flustered. My friend asked what the soup of the day was, and he looked at her blank faced saying that he ""doesn't normally work Monday's so he doesn't know and will check"". Every time he left our table, it took him FOREVER to come back. We could not get his attention!! The food was mediocre this time. My friend asked for a medium mushroom burger, but parts of it was DEFINITELY rare. The seasoning on the mashed potatoes was off, but the honey truffle chicken was good. I got the Evelyn's pasta, which was eh. It was a good mix of vegetables, but it all ended up tasting the same. The menu said it came with rigatoni pasta, but I definitely got a few elbows in there. My friend got the shrimp angel hair pasta, which she said just tasted not special. Overall, the extensive menu at cheesecake is overwhelming, but I don't think there's a terrible option.  THIS IS WHEN IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE. We literally waited 45 min between finishing eating to leaving the restaurant. Our server was just too busy. Every time we asked for something, it would take him over 10 min to come back and ask us to repeat what we just said. We even told him in the beginning that we had somewhere to be, but he did not seem to get that. Dinner should not take 2.5 hours when we just got an entree!  We were actually fuming when we walked out. Sat in silence in the Uber back home. Do not recommend this location!!"
Rebecca A.,"Biddeford, ME",61,53,130,5.0,12/10/2017,"I love coming here! The atmosphere, service and of course the food is always fantastic. Oh and you can't forget about the CHEESECAKE!!  On this visit we decided to order from the lunch sized options which are supposed to be smaller but truly you get an amazing portion. I had the spaghetti and meatballs that was very delicious and Judy got the pepperoni and sausage pizza with a salad. She had honey mustard for her dressing and it was the best honey mustard I've had, definitely homemade. The pizza was amazing, so much flavor. For dessert you guessed it cheesecake!! Judy had the celebration cheesecake which was spectacular and I had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, decadent!! Great as always!!"
Fion W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",62,1,3,5.0,1/3/2018,"It's really tasty. Both of dessert and main course. We ordered chicken farfalla and strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake texture is creamy, and the strawberry are juicy. And the chicken farfalla is fantastic use fry chicken breast but not dry, and the pasta is chewy. All the seasoning is alright! Strongly recommended!"
Andrew S.,"San Francisco, CA",46,162,565,2.0,10/16/2017,"Great location near the Hynes Convention Center and wait time was quick. The food is very mediocre - had the crab bites and the ""Skinnylicious chicken rigatoni.  Service was also slow.  Not recommended."
Hillary V.,"Lewiston, ME",23,69,136,4.0,7/30/2017,The menu is incredible. I could probably eat here for years and still never explore the entire menu. It makes for an interesting opportunity to try a lot of new things. We have visited twice in the past month and had a great experience both times. Our waiters went above and beyond both times.  We were lucky enough to experience the soup of the day being Loaded Baked Potato and it was amazing.
Ilana Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,26,4.0,12/3/2017,"We waited around 20 minutes for a seat, which isn't bad. The place was full around 5 pm, which is pretty early for a Saturday night. When we got to our seats, the silverware was dirty so we asked for a new set. Our waiter didn't come to our table often, and we had to wait a while to get our drinks, bread, and for him to take our order. Definitely could've had better service. Other than that, this is your usual Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge and has so many options! We shared a small plate of greek salad, spinach dip, and loaded tater tots. They were all delicious and the portions are huge even for appetizers. For the main dishes, we got a bacon-bacon burger and eggplant parm. We had a lot to take home as well! For dessert we shared a carrot cake cheesecake which was so yummy!!! Definitely recommend if you're shopping in the Prudential Center and looking for a place that hits the spot!!"
Jacqueline S.,"Menlo Park, CA",84,53,27,2.0,9/24/2017,"Wait time was quick. I had a party of five and we were seated within five minutes for dinner. However we were placed at a table meant for four. It was a booth and they stuck a small armless chair at the end. Not the worst. But it took 45 minutes to be given a fifth place setting and when I finally got one the fork, spoon and plate were dirty with bits of greens still stuck on them. Super gross and I got attitude when I asked for another set. You could see the food on it. It also took over an hour for food. On top of that it was annoying to constantly move my chair out of the way for passing people."
Melanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,286,1175,4.0,4/11/2017,"I love this Cheesecake Factory. Nestled in the heart of Boston it's perfect for almost any occasion. The restaurant is huge and can accommodate large parties. On Sunday's when the entire city of Boston ventures out for brunch and most places require a blood sample and a minimum of at least an hour wait... you can be seated within 15 minutes at the factory.  The menu here is vast... but there is something to accommodate every taste. Fish, chicken, beef, turkey or vegetarian. My favorites are signature the avocado egg rolls and the fire cracker Salmon. These are appetizers but I usually get them as a meal and they are perfectly filling.  The price point is reasonable. Entrees typically don't go past 20.00 dollars here. Of course you can't end dinner at the factory with the cheesecake! Get the cheesecake and damn your diet! It's so very worth it. If you are looking for a good quality bite with lots of options in Boston this is a great option. You can work off the cheesecake with a walk through the prudential afterwards."
Margot D.,"Boston, MA",220,688,34,1.0,9/10/2017,"If only they had their act together..... I was given the task of picking up dessert for 6 people, so I decided that 6 different desserts would be better than just one, this avoiding the ""oh no, I don't like xx"".  I went in, went straight to the area on the left for take-out orders and waited.  Waited some more, waited more, noticed that there were now 5 people behind me also waiting (and worried that they would think the slow service is because I was picking up something that was causing this) and we were all just watching while one employee took his time cleaning a coffee machine. Not once did he think to say to the gathered crowd ""someone will be right over"".  Nope, just glanced at all of us and kept doing what he was doing. Three (3!!!) other CF employees were at the host stand behind us and did nothing.  It's fine if their position is to be at the host stand and not handle orders, but SAY SOMETHING and then GO GET SOMEONE.  I finally decided I would not be forking over $35-40 for this and left (FYI, Flour bakery is around the corner on Belvidere)."
Matt L.,"Manhattan, NY",109,419,338,4.0,8/23/2017,"3.5 stars, rounded up. IF you want to get to this Cheesecake Factory (CF), you should exit at the E line of the green at prudential, takes you right out to where CF is in the mall. This CF honestly has a great location, so you probably won't miss it. Ever since I came to America, I've been a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory, primarily because they serve almost everything possibly imaginable here. The second reason I love this place in general is because of the crazy high calorie dishes they serve here. Some dishes here regularly make the ""Dishes with the Highest Number of Calories by Chain Restaurant"" lists: for instance, the chicken and garlic farfalle (according to the menu) has 2190 calories in just one serving. It's amazing, and only appropriate for special occasions.  This particular CF is not much different from other locations. The waitstaff is fine, and generally friendly, and if i recall correctly, the food comes out blazingly fast. I will say however that it is a little bit too dimly lit here, and wish that they would improve the lighting if possible. However, if you need to scratch your CF itch, this is definitely a great option. ?"
Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1439,14550,4.0,3/7/2017,"Chocolate Cake test complete, with the help of some friends... Black-Out Cake - Our Deepest, Richest, Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Chips, Finished with Almonds Linda's Fudge Cake - Layers of Rich Chocolate Cake and Fudge Frosting Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake - Layers and layers of Fudge Cake with Chocolate Truffle Cream and Chocolate Mousse Each one was a terrific chocolate cake.  The Black-Out Cake is their basic chocolate cake.  The Fudge Cake is extra moist and rich, while the Tower Truffle is a tad lighter with the layers of chocolate mousse.  So, go with your mood, and enjoy!  Perhaps with a glass of milk."
Emily H.,"Miami, FL",85,13,14,5.0,12/29/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, the food is always great no matter which one to go to. Chicken Madeira was delicious I can never finish a whole meal, also the bacon bacon burger was thick and tasty. We asked for it medium and it was at its point. Great food, great ambience, great service."
Brooke R.,"Minneapolis, MN",96,90,26,5.0,9/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory chains are pretty standard, one of the reasons they're so popular is because it's reliable. But this one gets 5 stars from me because of Amus the server. 10/10 would recommend asking for a table in his section specifically!!  Also remember, MA doesn't allow for liquor discounts so happy hour is strictly food deals."
Rachel W.,"Boston, MA",100,75,17,3.0,10/29/2017,"I like to sit at the bar for a quick bite when I'm shopping at the Pru. Cheesecake is always great, service is friendly and quick, and the 600 calorie and under ""Skinny"" menu is great. It's a big chain, but the food is usually pretty great."
Thu N.,"Boston, MA",73,268,895,3.0,1/22/2017,"So just got back to this place twice recently bc a generous family member gave us a gift card. Both time we had not so good service. First time we came right before closing time, around 11:30 pm so I dont really want to blame the bad experience on anyone but us. But you should avoid going this time if you can. The waiter didnt give us bread, which I figured due to the closing of the bakery. However, he didnt mention or apologize about it. The main course was so so. For dessert, we asked for cheesecake and was informed that they were no whipped cream since they are closed. I said it's fine but somehow we ended up with whipped cream anyway. I discussed with my hubby to bring the cake home since I dont want to make the staff wait for us any longer. So when my husband told the waiter to just box the cake and get the check, he said he already ordered it to go (???) Again, It's midnight, I dont blame him but yeah this isnt the best time to visit. Not once our water was refilled. 2nd visit, we came on a Sat and waited for 40 + min. I never knew they can get so busy. I got the cabonara and it isnt one really. I'm not an Italian food expert but I know cabonara's sauce is made with cheese and eggs, but it was with cream. I was so white and wet that it's more like a alfredo sauce. It was still delicious but thats just misbranding. And again, no water was refilled. The waitress this time was nice though. On the plus side, the cheesecakes was delicious both time. The chocolate mousse (recommended by our first water) was a chocolate bomb, so yummy. The chocolate hazelnut crunch was so good as well."
Kurt K.,"Houston, TX",4,111,4,4.0,10/13/2017,We came here at the peak of lunchtime. Amazingly we had to wait just 5 minutes. After we have been seated the waiter came around quickly to take first our orders to drink. He gave us another minute to choose for the eating and we had not to wait longer than this. After we placed our orders we got the appetizers quite quickly. Very tasty and also nicely arranged. Good one. Talking about waiting time. After we had the drinks and the appetizers we started to wait. Longer than usual It was just about to take off a star when the main course arrived. And they were as we expected. Good taste and nicely displayed. So we give this place 4 stars because at the end we enjoyed our lunch here
Erika L.,"Boston, MA",277,114,95,2.0,5/15/2017,"Be prepared to wait an eternity! Do not come here if you are the HANGRY type! My boyfriend and I decided to go to the cheesecake factory on the basis that we simply did not know what to eat. The cheesecake factory was the perfect place to go to since their menu has pretty much everything and anything you could think of from italian, Asian fusion, mexican, etc.  Our total wait time for a table was 20 min. When we sat down the waitress wanted us to order within 5 min, but of course we needed longer to peruse the lengthy menu. It took her 15 minutes to come back to take the order.  I ordered the cauliflower steak, since it had less than 1500 calories unlike most things on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips with a side of Mac and cheese.  Another 15 passes and the waitress tells me they're out of cauliflower. She tries to suggest something to me but I ask for the menu again. Another 10 passes and I decide on the Americana cheeseburger.  The kitchen was extremely backed up. Although it was mother's day, I would expect the kitchen to keep up with the tables, considering the establishment is HUGE and always crowded when I pass by. For some reason, the orders of everyone in the section came out at different times. The table to my right had gotten there after us but we watched them FINISH their meal and dessert before we even got ours. The table to the left of us ordered before us and didn't get their food until 15 minutes after we got ours.  The cheesecake factory was completely unorganized. What we wanted to be a quick meal turned out to be a 2.5 hour ordeal!  The best food item we had was the side of Mac and cheese. My burger was completely falling apart once I got it. The patty was dry and charred.  Bottom line: do not come here unless you need time to kill and are looking for a guilty meal"
Alison K.,"Boston, MA",111,49,48,3.0,7/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a classic favorite; however, the waits are obscenely long. My friends and I waited about an hour for a table, which is typical. We were seated and proceeded to order our food. Two dishes came out on time, but one dish took an additional hour. Although the staff was apologetic, it became known that the dish wasn't on our table because no one had checked to see if the order was actually submitted (it was not). Either way, it's definitely a typical Cheesecake Factory, an American favorite. I'd recommend the chicken tostada salad and literally any appetizers with buffalo in them. For dessert, I'd recommend the fresh strawberry cheesecake or any of the peanut butter cheesecakes."
Huijie F.,"Malden, MA",27,8,78,5.0,10/26/2017,I gotta miss cheesecake factory. I love the appetites here even though I know they r not that health. It is really cheap and high quality.
Daniella S.,"Boston, MA",179,67,80,2.0,12/11/2017,"Worst service I've experienced. My table of 3 waited 45 minutes (at our table) before anyone took our order. We were starving, no one was bringing any bread or anything until later. I ordered the veggie burger and the bun was very very soggy. It fell apart after the first bite. I wish our waitress would have kept us updated at least on the status of our food or something. I've been to CF before and this visit was truly a disappointment."
Adriana K.,"Cambridge, MA",1,41,53,2.0,7/17/2017,"I love Cheesecake factory and have been to it many times in Cambridge, Chicago etc  But this unit has a very poor customer service!!!  We arrived 9:50PM Sunday maybe staff was tired but if it's says it's open until 11PM I expect the same service as any other time.  We were seated shortly but the waitress never brought our bread until I have asked after like 15 minutes.  We ordered and after another 15-20 minutes the manager came to say they ran out of that dish and tried to make it (chicken with pan gravy) but he sauce didn't work. Well, if the sauce is a pan gravy I really don't know how it can be ran out or not work. But the worst part is to wait again for another dish and the waitress did not even apologize for that. And every time we asked something that was missing (the bread, the plate, the ketchup) she just made an annoyed face to us when we finally could see her (because she was never around).  And to complete, while we were still eating she wanted to take the plate out ""can I leave the fries and take this out?"". Well, no, can't you see there is still food, that I'm holding my fork, eating after so much time waiting for a simple steak?!  Oh, and the New York style steak with ""veggies"" were only those miserable pieces of green beans. At least they changed my mashed potatoes for sweet fries.  And the floor of the dining room was so greasy it was dangerously slippery.  Won't go back to this one."
Ajay V.,"Boston, MA",1,4,,4.0,10/21/2017,Had the most succulent and amazing Red Velvet Cheesecake and the High Tower Chocolate cake. I also loved their vegetarian pasta options. Their Fried Cauliflower with hot Sauce was amazing and worth the amount.  Best Italian food I have ever eaten in a long time. Thank You CheeseCake
Sarah S.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",63,344,1978,4.0,10/9/2016,I heart Cheesecake Factory so just had to come here on a recent visit to Boston! We had lunch. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries followed by the new addition to their cheesecake menu - an amazing hazelnut chocolate cheesecake!! Same decor etc as every other Cheesecake Factory.  The only reason I'm not giving this particular Cheesecake Factory a five is because the service was pretty slow.
Wendy W.,"Houston, TX",500,257,476,4.0,8/3/2017,"I feel like you can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. An American chain that serves EVERYTHING and when I mean EVERYTHING - just browse the menu! It is overwhelming, but they definitely have something you're looking for.   Attire is anything from nice to casual. It really doesn't matter what you wear. It may look fancy-ish, but it's low key. Good for groups, couples, families. Indoor and outdoor seating. The portions ARE HUGE! Remember that! Go at a peek time and there is going to be a wait, however this restaurant is very large so turn around. Note that you could be waiting an hour during peek ours. Try to go just before prime times.  Free bread before your meal, the brown bread is my favorite. You can always ask for more and they are happy to bring it. I have never had a bad meal there, so no complaints. After dinner you may be too full for cheesecake, but definitely browse their trillions of options and you can always get it to go."
Silvino P.,"Manhattan, NY",319,103,609,3.0,8/20/2017,Like every other chain Cheesecake Factory. Hostess in the front was a little rude and the floor was slippery and dirty which was odd knowing that lawsuits can happen. The food was good and our waiter was actually pretty good. Location is in the back bay of Boston which is a nicer part of town really touristy.
Christine H.,"Milton, MA",113,169,99,3.0,3/26/2017,"Came in on a Friday night and was sat right away. Cheesecake Factory usually satisfies a quick food craving for average fare. The table got beet and goat cheese salad, skinnylicious shrimp fresh rolls, spicy chicken chipotle pasta and mango chicken dish. All were hugely portioned and tasted good. Nothing outstanding in my book though.  The three stars is for the service. The waitstaff was extremely disorganized and we were brought over the wrong food 4 times before actually getting our order. My water did not come with lemon as requested and the waitress was joking and talking to another table in front us while we waited 5 min for our check."
Sean G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",31,509,538,4.0,9/17/2016,We have been in a few of these across the US from California to Florida.   Not a place to visit if you are on a diet. They have a massive menu from sandwiches to pasta but as the name suggests Cheesecake is their thing and they do it well at 5000 calories a slice.  It's a bit of a tradition to find an outlet and scoff a wedge of cheesecake. Located in Prudential Center.
Benjamin M.,"Albany, NY",11,360,3,3.0,4/3/2017,"I came here with my wife while attending a convention. We had been walking all day or sitting in uncomfortable chairs, and looked for a place to eat with guaranteed seating. The CF was packed and they advised that we had a 30 minute wait, but they gave us a beeper and let us wander the mall. Exactly 30 minutes later, we were seated at our table.  I had never been to a CF before and the menu was extensive. However, I didn't want something really heavy as I had a lot more walking to do. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich, and my wife had their burger. Both meals came quickly. My chicken was fried perfectly with ample lettuce and tomato and I was 1/2 through it when I realized there was either no Buffalo sauce or it was so scantly applied as to be missing. They brought me more and that was nice. My wife enjoyed her burger. We split a piece of lime cheesecake, which was very flavorful and tart and not too sweet. The atmosphere was loud, dimly lit (it got darker as the meal went on, as if they turned the lights down), and very compressed. Since it is at a mall, perhaps it is like this every Saturday for dinner. I can't say I enjoyed being packed in or struggling to hear my wife, but the food was very good and the prices were reasonable. I may try our local CF and explore other parts of their menu."
Vanessa S.,"Boston, MA",0,10,32,3.0,10/6/2017,"Ordered the Bacon-Bacon cheeseburger (yes, there are two kinds of bacon on it) for takeout. The burger was cooked to perfection. Just make sure you eat it right away. After letting it sit for almost an hour, the bun had become hard and of course, the cheese was no longer melty goodness. I would definitely order this again and make sure that I eat it while it's still hot."
Austin L.,"Cambridge, MA",1,39,17,5.0,10/4/2017,"I've been here several times, and they always do a solid job. Kind service (if not the fastest, but honestly it's not anything notably bad, just don't expect a 20 minute in and out), great cheesecake, and excellent entrees. Most recently visited with my girlfriend for her first exposure, and had a really excellent meal and a wonderful time!"
Catherine L.,"Boston, MA",74,75,232,2.0,2/4/2017,"It's my first time ever trying Cheesecake Factory...and.....meh. The food and service here was very mediocre. I ordered a spinach dip, quesadilla, BBQ chicken pizza, and a slice of cheesecake. The spinach dip lacked cheese and was overall just very plain. The quesadilla was on the soggy side and although we ordered the ""plain"" quesadilla (aka the one without chicken) there was only cheese inside and on the side was some salsa, sour cream and guac (though the guac was quite good and tasted fresh). The BBQ chicken pizza was good since BBQ on pizza is such a great combination....but otherwise the cheese was not very stringy/cheesy, and it was just a plain pizza. Their cheesecake was quite good, we ordered their 30th anniversary cake and it was layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake; although it was very sweet, it was quite satisfying. Their menu is quite extensive so perhaps I can try out their other dishes.....but I kinda don't have the urge to.  Service wise, our server was kind but he never came back to check up on us, and he never bothered to refill our drinks. We tried to wave him down several times but he never looked.  Overall, just an extremely average meal. In other words, even if I was desperately hungry, Cheesecake Factory would be my 5th choice. I'd come here for the cheesecake again but food...pass."
Christine L.,"San Francisco, CA",714,523,763,3.0,7/6/2016,"Solid. As in these cheesecake slices are solid. Solid like bricks. This may sound bad at first, but I'd take a solid piece of cheesecake over a piece of fluff any day! My visit was as normal as normal gets. A friend (let's call her H) and I came in to share a slice for dessert, we somehow managed to wander the entire shopping area before finding this place! We clearly weren't that hungry. So H decides that I can be her bf for the day bc only couples share dessert, but everyone in the bar area was sharing dessert so no shame there! There wasn't much of a wait for the lounge at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and we were in and out in no time. Service was quick and attentive. Take a chance and try a flavor you've never had before! I'd personally only come for the dessert, but their regular entree portions are huge so come hungry!  PS. If you're not in a hurry, grab your slice to go and eat in the garden of the shopping area. You'll save a dollar too (tip)!"
Victor H.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",133,628,2561,4.0,1/3/2017,"Food offering is the same as other Cheesecake Factory across the US. However, the service stands out as great. They are observant and on top of your needs."
Amy M.,"Brookline, MA",13,12,10,2.0,11/13/2017,I don't really like to eat here unless it's for the deserts. The food is good and service too but it really depends on what type of server you get. First time eating there with my girls I got the Diane steak which was burnt and one side was just burnt black pepper. Another time I had ordered the hibachi steak the waiter took it away saying it's not my order and gave me a steak that's a credit card size. I never met a waiter like that. It's pretty much always busy so don't be afraid to get your plate right.
Dave O.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",97,143,201,1.0,6/19/2017,"My only two experiences here were poor.  The last one yesterday.  Their AC was broken so the place was hot and when I asked to be seated at a table, the gal seemed confused; I told her that I'd show her what to do if we both went to the reception area.  Secondly, the service was poor.  It took a many minutes to get a server over and when she did arrive, we placed our orders for drinks and food and waited....and waited.  The management here needs to get additional help rather than under budget during peak hours (Sunday dinner time).  Really long story short is that this place is a salty, 'processed food' mill where service is poor and taste is below average.   We will not be going back a third time."
Luca M.,"Milan, Italy",7,126,,5.0,8/23/2017,"I must admit that me and my wife are Cheesecake Factory enthusiasts and we go there every time we find one to try our favorite burger and one of their famous cheesecakes. Las Vegas, Honolulu, San Francisco and now Boston... the place is always a guarantee in terms of quality and flavor and at the end the price is not bad too. As usual we had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and we didn't get disappointed at all. Juicy and smokey as usual... better if tasted with sweet potato fries and some good beer. Nothing much else to add rather than try it if you never did!"
Nicole Y.,"San Diego, CA",10,111,103,5.0,11/5/2016,"I give the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars because every time I've been it's been smooth based on food and service. Their menu is 27 pages I believe and their Cheesecake selection is quite large. Their portions are large and if you plan on counting calories they now have a skinny-licious (I think that's what it's called) menu. But the calories in all the meals are pretty high. Definitely a casual night out if you're hungry and want food with lots of options. It's inside the prudential center so if you wanna take a walk around the mall while you wait to be seated there's that. But you should be prepared to wait if you come here for dinner. There's always a huge wait. It's not super long but if they give you a little buzzer then you can't go far because it won't register when they try to tell you your table is ready. Also, if you wanted to just come here for dessert that's a great option. You can just get Cheesecake at the front they have a little table. Oh! And they have a pretty nice bar area."
Emily W.,"Boston, MA",8,40,13,2.0,5/11/2017,"I live around the corner from this location and have had mediocre experiences in the past, but after last night's dinner I will never go back. We got there about 8pm and we're quickly seated because it wasn't overly crowded. Took 15 minutes for anyone to come over to say hello or bring water and we quickly ordered. The drinks and avocado egg rolls came soon enough and were tasty, but the good stopped there.  The Kobe beef burger I ordered medium rare took 30 minutes to come out and was cooked through, charred, dry, and crumbly. The waitress asked if we wanted a new one (yes) and sent the manager over to apologize. Another 20 minutes later I asked the waitress to please check on the burger and she brought one 10 minutes later-pink but dry inside, room temperature, cut in half, and charred on the outside with a grease soaked bun. It was like the kitchen cooked it, checked the color inside, plated it to sit, and heated it up on a hot grill when the waitress came to finally bring it to us. The burger fell apart and was not edible.  The waitress offered to bring something else but after an hour and a half we just wanted to leave. Never saw the manager again and was offered a free slice of cheesecake and meek apology.  I'd encourage anyone go visit another locally owned restaurant (there are dozens in a 2 block radius) rather than eat here."
Ophelia S.,"Boston, MA",0,74,,4.0,7/29/2017,"This location is super busy because not only is it inside a mall, but it's in a great neighborhood for both shopping and dining.  The wait for a Thursday night dinner was 30 minutes which really wasn't bad. They have little buzzers that would alert you when you are about to be called, so you can wander in the mall for a bit.  The servers are super friendly, and the food was good! Nothing to complain about food wise, and the portions are huge. The only negative experience I had was how long it took for someone to come by and grab our payment. It must've been at least a 15-20 minute wait before someone finally took it even though there were so many servers flying by.  I would come back again though!"
