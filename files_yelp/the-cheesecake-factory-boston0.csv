Aine P.,"Seattle, WA",2,5,1,5.0,5/4/2015,Love this place! Great food and friendly staff. Beautiful to sit outside on a sunny day
Courtney T.,"Pawtucket, RI",189,5,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge, MA is beyond the most racist, impolite, and ridiculous restaurant I have ever gone too. First, a kid that was with my cousin and a group of friends went to go make a reservation for the 10 of us. They told him 2 hours and he walked away (he's Cape Verdean). Not even 15 minutes later I came back to make a reservation myself because we decided we would wait and for 15 people because more people came than expected. When I went in their, I was told one hour for 15 people. I would just like to say that is white privileges, obviously.  After the one hour (and a half) wait we were finally seated. During the wait, someone who was in our group was asked by his mother to buy some milk to bring home for the house. He did this before because CVS was closing at 9 and it was around 8:45. CVS gave him a brown paper bag for his two half gallons of milk that said CVS on it. After being seated after the long wait, we received a dirty table, dirty clothes, and dirty plates/silverware.  When the kid asked if they had milk for him to have with his food, they said that they did not have any. He then asked if the waitress could give him a cup so he could pour his milk into the cup. He even said they could charge him for the cup and continued to show them the milk that was in the paper bag. The waitress said ""Okay, I will be right back with everything."" After awhile of waiting, we saw not one, not two, not three, BUT FIVE police officers approaching us. When I asked what the situation or problem was they told us that a manager was told that we were pouring alcohol into our drinks. Mind you, we were there celebrating a friends birthday and my cousins confirmation!  The police officers then took the milk away and smelt it and declared that the milk was JUST MILK. They apologized then walked away. How embarrassing right? Due to the obvious fact that us and the waitress was uncomfortable I politely went up to a manager at the front desk and requested a new waiter/waitress because it was an embarrassing and awkward situation for not only us, but the waitress too. They said ""okay, yeah. No problem, I'll be right on that"". After the waitress coming back a total of 5 times, I went to the bathroom and decided to call my cousins mom. As I was telling her the story and what the police officers said to me and everything that was going on, a Manager who wasn't even dealing with my table got in my face screaming at me saying we were being disruptive and that she was going to kick us out if I didn't stop telling my Aunt the situation that was occurring. I told her that I'm on a personal phone call what I say is none of her business and that I said exactly what the officer told me he was called for. (The officer even asked us to see some of our drinks!). She then left the bathroom (didn't use the bathroom) while laughing and calling me a bitch. Due to this altercation, I was recorded by some girls in the bathroom behind me, so once again, an embarrassing situation. I could have been lying out of my ass (WHICH I WASN'T!) and she still had no right to put her two sense into my personal conversation. After the bathroom, I went to go talk to another manager. While I was gone she continuously walked by my table laughing then asked ""where is that white girl at"" (mind you she's a fat white girl, not that her physical appearance matters). When talking to the head managed, Clint I believe was his name, I was told that I was lying and that he knows these employees well and that both the girls saw a bottle of alcohol. No alcohol was found when the police searched us, our table, the bags, and our milk/drinks. Notice how he said two girls, we had one boy and one girl!  My uncle came in and demanded an apology and they offered an order on the house. We denied and said that we just wanted an apology. He continued to say we can afford our own food, just that we also deserved to be respected. We then checked everyone's receipt and made sure everything was paid for (I DID THIS MYSELF, PERSONALLY). We even left an extra $20 to show that we didn't come here for a scene and that we came here to eat properly. As the group tried to leave they stopped and said we still owed them money and that we didn't pay. They then argued for awhile saying we should have kept our receipt (they collected it from us). They then discovered that they made ANOTHER mistake and that we did pay and left the extra $20. Not that it matter since they even offered to put the order on the house!  There was a total of 12 of us for our 15 people reservation. I was the ONLY white one. Along with that, this all occurred before we even received our food. I didn't even eat it I was so aggravated that I lost my appetite. They even accused of us saying we put alcohol in our drinks (why would we even tell our server that if we did?)  Moral of the story: don't bring milk to CheeseCake Factory. You'll be arrested for underage drinking.they don't even deserve half a star."
Nessa M.,"Bristol, RI",35,86,1,1.0,5/25/2013,"They failed they failed they failed. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this place. Twice I tried to eat here during Anime Boston and twice they tried to kill me!! IF YOU HAVE A FOOD ALLERGY JUST STAY AWAY THEY ARE UTTERLY INCOMPETENT!!!!!! First fail happened when the moron waitress gave me a Dr. Pepper instead of a root beer. I immediately went into anaphalaxis and had to use my epi pen. Obviously we left. The Providence location is awesome, so I had high hopes for this place, so in thinking it was just the waitress who failed, we decided to give them another chance. I ordered a pasta dish loaded with garlic and substituted the shrimp for chicken. While I'm not allergic to shrimp, I'm pretty much allergic to every other kind of seafood, and since shrimp is commonly contaminated by other seafood, I thought chicken would be safe. I informed my waitress that I had a major seafood allergy and told her I wanted chicken instead. Well, what ended up on my plate? I found 2 stray pieces of shrimp in my dish. I refused to touch it and we left. Never again Boston Cheesecake Factory, never again."
Lauren W.,"Charlestown, MA",16,90,4,2.0,2/13/2013,"My friend and I recently dined at this establishment.  Let's face it, it's a standard chain, with standard food. Not that the food was particularly bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  Service was pretty blah. Our waiter didn't do anything crazy, it was more what he didn't do. For example, he certainly didn't pick up dirty dishes, and our dirty appetizer plates were on the table until the end of the meal, and he certainly didn't check up on his often, as water glasses were dry and ready to be filled most of the meal.  If you expect good service or exciting food, this may not be your place. If you're happy with standard chain fare, with poor service, then this is it."
Diane H.,"Boston, MA",434,684,720,4.0,8/27/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory---for its cheesecakes and their food. Usually there's some sort of wait--maybe a 15 min wait at this location, but this past friday, there was no wait at 6pm! Our server was nice, but he didn't give me my water with lime, and i mentioned lime 3 times..making sure he understood, and my friend didn't get a lemon with his water. Their nachos with the spicy chicken--GET IT! Would be better with more cheese, just because I love cheese, but it's sooo good. The fried calamari was delicious, especially paired with the cocktail sauce, the other garlic sauce? My friend says not so much. My other friend enjoyed his Margarita flat bread. I wish I got a taste of it, so I can tell you whether it's good or not, but it looked pretty appetizing! And again, our server did not rush us out, and he tried to sell us some desserts, but alas, we weren't that hungry after we devoured our meal. Their cheese cake is good, as with all the other locations. The tirimisu cake is my favorite..Their mojito is pretty good too."
Vanessa W.,"Acton, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2015,"I m in luck! It has been 2 years since my last time here. If my friend did not give me its gift card, I would never come back. So today I decided to give it 2nd chance by going to its store in difference location, and here is what happened again: a tiny wood stick was found in my artichoke dip. After a closer look, I found out it is the tip part of a toothpick! which reminds me what happened on 2013 Mother's day:  Huge disappointment, ruined my Mother's day: I am so regret to take my mom there for lunch on Mother's day! First of all, it took us more than 30 minutes wait for our food served. There were not even many people at that time. Both sides of our neighbors' food were ready and they came later than us , we still sat there waiting. All I ordered was burger and my mom had wasabi tuna. It should not take that long. But fine, it's Mother's day. It's not like me and my mom were in a hurry anyway. We wanted to take our time, enjoy the beautiful day. It was not easy to spend some quality time together, and to celebrate the day, when she lives in another continent across the ocean. However, as our lunch towards end, here came the WORST part: I noticed there was a fruit TAG in my mom's plate, mingled with rice! The manager came to explain: they used orange peels for the dish. The tag may fall into the plate accidentally when peeling the orange skin.They could take away the rest of my mom's food, and gave us a piece of free cheese cake as apology. Here I think is the funny part: 1. I don't want to know why/how the fruit tag get into the dish. 2. Sure, they could add orange peel but it doesn't mean it's OK to get into the plate. 3.  All they offered is just taking the plate away, and offering a piece of cake to fix the problem. We paid for the meal, and did not even finished it. My mom meant to box the rest before I found the tag. So in the end, they gave us a newly cooked, equal portion of the left meal, and a piece of cake. My mom is ok with it. But I am totally upset by what happened. That my mom kept telling me she's fine, and still had good time with me made me fell even worse. Very unpleasant experience! I am still upset even by now."
Josh R.,"Boston, MA",59,174,,3.0,3/11/2013,"Food was alright although the wait was terribly long as we went by on a weekend. I had the nachos, which was a huge portion fit for two. Although it was an appetizer, it really should have been listed under entrees! The chicken salad was also a massive portion. We were so full that we did not order mains after that.  The food was okay, but it's become the kind of chain restaurant that I wouldn't go for a special occasion like a birthday celebration. The wait was long although service was decent. Dessert is the big hit here of course, like the Godiva Cheesecake and Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Excellent desserts, whole meals on their own. Actually, to skip the lines and have the best food available (cheesecake), I think the next time I'll go have dinner elsewhere with a shorter waiting line and either come here for dessert after the dinner crowd is gone; or even take home the cheesecakes for some delectable, delicious end of meal savoring!"
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,4.0,9/1/2014,"The food was to say the very least, wonderful. Go here and make sure you try their Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It was spectacular."
Charlena K.,"Boston, MA",11,102,46,4.0,3/5/2013,"4 STAR DINING IN: My boyfriend and I visited this location while on vacation once and now that we're official Bostonians, we frequent this spot. We are literal junkies for the red velvet cheesecake! The food is decent, my favorite dish is the Chicken Di Pana and my boyfriend's was Mexico City. They cancelled it; life went on, he ordered something else, but it's such a pain when companies get rid of classics and things that their consumers like! The (non-alcoholic) tropical smoothie is also amaze- perfectly blended and super fresh and fruity! Honestly, if it weren't for the fruit smoothie and cheesecake (mostly the cheesecake), I wouldn't necessarily care to eat here because the food options are limited (they're all basic variations of the same main dish). The customer service is good, nothing to rant or rave about. Friday and Saturday nights have unnecessarily extended wait times. PROS: Great location, great dessert, nice ambiance, CONS: long wait times, decent/somewhat bland meals that are slightly overpriced --- 5 STAR CATERING: My sisters and I used their catering service for my mom's bridal shower/bachelorette party in August. Food was prepared on time and nicely packaged/handled. It was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced considering it was catered Cheesecake Factory. Someone from the dessert counter helped us bring the food out to the car and the catering customer service was really awesome in general. Again, the food was immaculate and only needed minimal heating by the time it arrived to our place!"
Kristen S.,"Attleboro, MA",227,286,233,4.0,11/2/2013,"Yes, CCF is a chain, but I really do love it.  So many great menu items, it's always hard to choose.  They have a newer ""skinnylicious"" menu, w everything less than 590 calories.  I'd rather splurge on drinks and dessert, so on my last visit, I ordered a salad off the skinny menu.  It was delicious, more of the size of their ""appetizer"" salads, which are still quite large.  The strawberry martini here is amazing.  Fresh strawberries muddled and mixed w vodka-tasty and strong! The pear martini is a little too sweet for me.  My favorite cheesecakes are: Adam's PB Cup, Stephanie's Red Velvet and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream.  I don't eat here often, I'd be 300 lbs, if I did, so it's always a welcome treat to go here and indulge a little!"
Timmy D.,"Malden, MA",26,53,76,5.0,1/3/2015,"Sat in the bar area, kind of a busy Sunday between Christmas and New year. All I can say is Vinny knows his stuff . Great experience from start to end. Thanks Vinny we will be back"
Anne W.,"Los Angeles, CA",566,1678,622,3.0,9/27/2011,"I don't actually like the Cheesecake Factory.. the food I mean.  The entrees used to be larger but the problem really is.. the food always makes me sick.  I am also not too big of a fan of cheesecake as I learned it will make you fatter than anything.  But.. this is a review about the Cheesecake Factory!!!  Last night I headed to this particular Cheesecake Factory to grab a slice and head out the doors and to the fountains across the street.  That was lovely and beautiful... the pool reminds me of the one in DC.  Great place to eat cheesecake (if you like it or have the metabolism for it), enjoy the last of Boston's summer weather, and chat.  Great post-date place.. if things are going well.  Wink wink. It did take about 5 minutes to get the cheesecake which was weird.. but that's because we are less important than the servers (who are bringing cheesecake to patrons in the dining room). So location alone is what makes this Cheesecake Factory.. A-OK."
Jennifer G.,"Boston, MA",442,305,456,4.0,8/27/2011,"I've definitely had my awkward share of waiters here...but their food is delicious, so it balances out.  Their portions are very fair, so go hungry if you plan to finish your whole meal.  I recently tried their lunch sized pasta, which I was afraid would be too small, but I actually really enjoyed it along with the appetizer.  I ordered the Buffalo Blasts by mistake thinking they were wings, but the Buffalo Blasts are definitely way better than I expected.  Good-sized appetizer to share with maybe three or four people. The waiters usually bring our entrees out when we're still eating our appetizer...and it's extremely frustrating because our food just sits on our table and starts to get warm - not the out-of-the-oven HOT that you expect it to be. Besides the service, no complaints.  Great food, AMAZING cheesecake (obviously), great location. Also, note that they don't take reservations, so on busy nights, the wait can take FOREVER...but it's worth it!"
Dani S.,"Boston, MA",234,44,8,3.0,12/12/2013,"Where do I start? The food here is great. But the servings are HUGE. Even the allegedly ""Skinny"" menu servings are large. All the food - cheesecake and otherwise - is quite good. It's the decor that throws me a little. It's perfect in a way. Warm lighting, soft calm colored walls reminiscent of a cozy little Italian restaurant, and clean. Super clean. So why 3 stars?  It's too perfect. Although it tries to be warm and cozy, it fails to achieve such a feeling. The mix of the super-cleanliness and the high ceilings (All of which are nice), it still gives off a feeling of trying too hard. And it's this feeling that takes away from what otherwise could be a very pleasant atmosphere.  If the feeling and looks of a place don't affect you much, and all you really care about is food, then I'd recommend it. If you're looking for a place to stay for an extended period of time and eat and talk with friends/famliy, then I suggest doing some more research."
July W.,"Boston, MA",15,44,25,4.0,9/7/2015,"Been there several times. Liked Shrimp Scampi (creamy) and its whole wheat bread (not sure if it's called this). Also liked Shrimp with Angel Hair and Fried Calamari. The cheesecake was too much for one person, better sharing with a friend."
Hana K.,"Jersey City, NJ",42,88,123,2.0,5/26/2013,"After coming here several times and trying their food (pasta, appetizer, salad), I've never been impressed. Perhaps I've just ordered the wrong thing on the menu because many of my friends come here for the food...  But I'm so glad I ordered dessert because I would go back for the cheese cake and nothing else. Don't bother trying the fancy Oreo or Red Velvet or Caramel or any of those cheese cakes. Just go with the plain Original Cheese Cake -- you will not regret it. It's simple, sweet, creamy and crusty perfection."
Nick T.,"New York, NY",69,100,257,3.0,11/19/2012,"Well we slept in till 10 so there weren't too many places open around us. Well there might have been but its the first time I was in Boston so I'm glad it was here. The food is decent and it came out quick, I had the mushroom burger which was decent at best. The salads have a enormous portion for the price. All in all chain restaurants all uphold to a certain standard they won't disappoint you but neither will they amaze you"
Lauren E.,"Boston, MA",28,301,5,5.0,7/3/2011,"I love, love, love Cheesecake Factory, and it is always my go-to place when I don't know where else to go.  The portions are huge, so I always end up taking some of my food home to eat for lunch or dinner the next day. I know it sounds boring, but I love the Club sandwich.  Other dishes I recommend include the Chicken Samosas (small plate snack), Pasta Carbonera with Chicken and the Santa Fe Salad. Because the portions are so big, I never have room for cheesecake after.  But sometimes I'll take a piece home to eat later. My only complaint is that this place is absolutely packed with tourists.  On weekends you may have to wait upwards of one hour or more, and if I recall, they don't take reservations during peak times. Otherwise, this place is good for everyone, whether you are a family with kids, couple looking to go on a date or a large group celebrating a birthday."
James T.,"St Clair Shores, MI",1,34,10,3.0,11/23/2013,"Its Cheesecake Factory, a 3 star venture. Giant menu, decently cooked food served in ridiculous proportions in an other-worldly looking  venue.  This is a restaurant for women, guys go there to please them but there is still enough good stuff on the menu to make it tolerable. Just get the meatloaf and pig out on it, its a solid meatloaf. All the deserts are good, let your girl order from a vast collection of cheesecakes, thats the main reason she loves this place. Get a nice ice cream sundae or some chocolate cake instead. Desert is the main reason to go here so don't skip it. Its a reasonable place for a super trendy tourist friendly joint."
Kathryn K.,"Brighton, MA",0,5,,1.0,8/9/2014,Terrible waitstaff with poor attitude...not a welcoming location at all!  I will never visit this location again.
