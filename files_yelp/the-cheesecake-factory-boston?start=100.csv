Chris P.,"Boston, MA",121,454,2083,4.0,7/29/2015,"Went on a Sunday night and the place was packed. Food is pricey but the portions are large and the food high quality, especially the cheesecake. I can't exaggerate how large the portion sizes of the entrees are. You will almost definitely be taking a to-go bag with you when you leave. I ordered the nachos for an appetizer, Chicken Avocado Club sandwich for the entree, and for dessert the fresh banana cream cheesecake. I ended up taking some of the appetizer and dessert home. For a drink I ordered a virgin piña colada, which was just okay. I know I won't be eating here too much just because my arteries couldn't take it and I'd probably have a stroke at the table, but coming to Cheesecake Factory is like a field trip, fun to do once in a while as a special outing with friends."
Emimi S.,"Boston, MA",3,46,23,3.0,9/25/2015,"I came in at around 3pm today, and to my surprise, there was actually a decent amount of people eating. Lot of people were having late lunches, or early dinners , I guess. I was here for what seemed to be lunch #2.  Anyhow, I'll just say that right off the bat, that the service we received was pretty terrible. Our waitress was slow, wasn't very friendly, never asked about water refills, or checked up on how we're doing. -1 star for that. As you may all know, this place offers A TON of food. After 15 minutes of looking at the menu, we managed to narrow our order down to: Crab Artichoke Dip, Shepard's Pie, Grilled Salmon, and Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Crab Artichoke Dip- served with thin, crispy slices of buttery bread. The dip itself was pretty good; it was thick and creamy, and reminded me of chowder. The only complaint I had was that there wasn't much crab in the dip. Maybe it was blended in or something, but I was expecting chunks of crab meat. Not really worth the $11.50. Sherpard's Pie- This was my first time trying sherpard's pie, but I thought it was tasty! Has meat, peas, mushrooms, carrots covered in a rich sauce and topped with a mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was flavorful and not dry , and the portion was pretty generous, so would give this dish 5 stars. Grilled Salmon- Fish itself was pretty standard, maybe a little above average. But then again, I've never really had a grilled salmon that made me go 'MMMMmm, OH SO DELICIOUS!!!!' It's served with side of tartar sauce and steamed, seasonless broccoli. 3 stars Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake- caramel+pecan layer, followed by cheesecake layer+ chocolate brownie layer. The chocolate thing on top was super good. That's some solid chocolate right there. But the cheesecake itself was ok. Good, but not something I would want to order again. 3 stars Love the menu offerings. Love the portions. Kinda love some of the food. Hate the service. And the prices. There are so many places to eat in that area. I would advise that if you have the time, explore somewhere new, fun, and cool to try! But otherwise, Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for a meal out."
Jungle B.,"Medford, MA",0,9,,2.0,7/2/2017,"The food was good but the waiter was horrible.  He would disappear, forget my order come back and ask me again and he just didn't care that it was my gfs birthday... :("
Peter Y.,"Greenfield, IN",4,203,88,3.0,4/9/2016,"I came with some friends long time ago. It still gives me a good memory. It has nice salmon here. The one I ordered is herb chicken which just fulfilled my taste. They also serve nice cakes, my favorite one is the mango cheese cake."
Rooty T.,"Clinton, MA",7,272,398,5.0,4/17/2016,"My partner and I stayed at the Sheraton in Boston along with a friend visiting from Denver CO. On a Sunday morning St Patrick's Day weekend, we looked for a place to have a late breakfast. We were surprised that The Cheesecake Factory offered breakfast every Sunday.  I ordered pancakes, eggs and bacon, my partner had eggs, bacon, hash-browns and toast and or friend had french toast and bacon. The servings were large. The eggs were fluffy as well as the pancakes. The bacon was crispy the way I like it. The french-toast was moist with a slight crunch on the edges and the hash-browns were nicely seasoned. We all had orange juice that tasted freshly squeezed.  What was nice is that each dish was plentiful and the cost was reasonable as compared to a mediocre yet expensive breakfast at the Sheraton."
Dave F.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,6,,1.0,6/12/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory in general. However, we have now been to this location twice and have had slow service and cold food both times. Once was mid afternoon mid week and the other was dinner time on a Sunday night. The second time we actually sent the entree back and waited a full fifteen minutes to get our second cold entree. It was buttered noodles. Nobody seemed to be interested in our satisfaction to boot. Would avoid."
Ian C.,"Irvine, CA",0,45,18,2.0,5/21/2017,"My wife and I have been to a good number of  Cheesecake Factory locations throughout different parts of the US because the food is consistently good and we know what we will get.  This location was no different.  However the waitress Fransheska was probably the least attentive one we've ever had in any C.F.  first she was hardly ever available the entire time we were there.  Only took orders and delivered our drinks one time.  She got the order wrong.  Never checked back once, not even once.  No refilling empty water glasses.  Not asking if we wanted more bread.  Never checked to see if the food was fine.  We had to ask her coworker who was able to correct the error in one minute because we could not see or find her.  Entree took about 40 min to show.  Maybe kitchen issues but never once updated us.  We just sat there with empty bread basket and empty water glasses and kept ourselves entertained thankfully to smartphones.   Never once had a unprofessional waitress in any C.F. and this was first"
Eric S.,"Boston, MA",20,286,26,4.0,1/4/2016,"For a chain restaurant, this place never disappoints!  The waitstaff can sometimes be hit or miss, but the food is always stellar.  Some of my favorites include the Ahi Tartare (an appetizer dish consisting of a puck of chopped raw ahi tuna sitting on top of a puck of avocado, sitting in a pool of soy ginger sauce, topped with spicy mayo, pickled ginger, and sesame seeds, garnished with fried wonton chips.  It's a delightful Asian twist to a French dish (or a French twist to a Japanese dish, you decide!). Normally I opt for ordering two or three appetizers instead of an entree.  Another decent ""appetizer"" that's actually entree sized are the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  They're not authentic by any means, but they are DELICIOUS!  It's simple.  All you do is make a taco/burrito with fresh lettuce as the shell.  It comes with pickled carrots, noodles, chicken in a peanut sauce, parsley, cucumbers, and bean sprouts.  It also comes with three sauces.  I'm not quite sure what's in them, but they're all good! As for entrees, the sandwiches are very good, and the burgers are very good as well.  The burgers are actually quite large, and come with decent sized patties and generous portions of condiments such as lettuce, tomato, and onion.  Plus, they're cooked to order! After stuffing and/or gorging yourself on this delicious food, you might want to take your leftovers to go, then go home to hibernate, but what's this?  The waiter/waitress just brought you a dessert menu!  Oh no! You're stuffed!  But somehow you still have room for dessert!  Why would you come here if you're not going to have a slice of their namesake!  I usually either opt for the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  I've tried the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and have found it to be lacking a bit in the vanilla department.  The Hot Fudge Sundae is good too, but only order it if you intend on picking up a slice of cheesecake at the to-go counter up front! Yes, the price is a bit steep for some of the menu items, but if you want to take someone out to dinner, this is a spot that will never fail you!"
Luana M.,"Boston, MA",8,2,,1.0,11/18/2015,"First, this is not a review about the food. I love the beef medallions I had there, also the cheesecake. On the other hand, the service is AWFUL. It was my friend's birthday, we had to wait more ONE HOUR to be placed. We almost gave up. What pissed me off the most was the receptionist who told us that we'd wait about 15 min. It turned out we waited for an hour. I hated that. Plus, Idk why the waitress took so long to fill our glasses with water. Eating that sweet cheesecake made us so thirsty! All the time we had to ask her to come to our table. That was really disappointing and it made our experience at Cheesecake Factory not really pleasant."
Steve H.,"Watertown, MA",51,107,58,3.0,6/19/2015,"This location is located in the Prudential center of Boston, the host team was quick to greet me and I was placed on a 5 minute wait. we ordered appetizers and they were great I would strongly recommend the Loaded Tater Tots! The service was just Okay, had to wait for refills when the location wasn't busy."
Kiki R.,"Milton, VT",15,22,31,5.0,5/4/2016,I ordered their steak sandwich with fries and my fiance ordered the turkey club with fries. The steak sandwich was absolutely amazing! My fiance and I both liked the turkey club but it wasn't the best we've ever had. The fries were a lot better than I expected. They give you free bread before your meal comes out which was also very good. The service was great! We were stuffed from dinner so we came back a few hours later for the cheese cake. I am not typically a cheese cake fan but I have to say that their chocolate mousse cheesecake is amazing! I love the whipped cream they give you with it. You definitely need it because the chocolate mousse is rich. My fiance got the fresh strawberry cheesecake and he loved it!
Sharon C.,"Brighton, MA",8,56,502,3.0,11/18/2015,"Extensive selection on the menu.  Love this place because there's always alot I can choose from.  My friend and I came around 5:30p for an early dinner ( I waited for 10 minutes or so for a table, so pretty quick for us to get a table).  The two of us ordered a luau salad ( my first time trying this and it was outstandingly delicious. It has mango with crispy wontons and other veggies in it..), pasta da Vinci ( mushrooms with chicken meats mix in with a wine sauce..awesome dish! We didn't like penne pasta so ended up having the waiter to switch it to fettuccine instead without additional cost ).  Lastly we got to have a cheesecake dessert ( had the lemon raspberry kind. It was alright. )"
Yuka Y.,"Brookline, MA",413,322,1048,3.0,7/1/2013,"It saddens me that the only ""decent"" place college kids seem to be aware of in Boston is the Cheesecake Factory. CF is always the default #1 idea when it comes to brainstorming a place to eat for a fairly large group. There's more to Boston you know!!!  As a foodie, I secretly die a little inside every time CF is chosen. I'll let the exchange students wanting to visit CF reason slide, but with the rest of my American friends, there's no reason to visit this place more than once a year. I don't have a thing against chains, it just baffles me when a lot of people don't want to venture beyond CF for a nice dining experience. If I'm in charge of deciding where to eat, CF will not exist in my list. Yes, CF has food that doesn't disappoint, but I wouldn't say it's outstanding. Portions are large and for the most part overpriced. Menu offerings lean towards Italian and Mexican cuisine. I thought it was brilliant when a friend ordered off of the appetizers list because of the smaller yet filling portions. Their skinnylicious side menu is an annoyance. In an ideal world if one dines out, one should enjoy food wholeheartedly without having to give a #(*k about calorie count.  Recent visits, I've had their White Chicken Chili and Kobe Burger. The Chicken Chili is on the hot end similar to that of salsa. It's like a spicy tomato chicken soup with rice. Kobe Burger was decent, done medium rare as requested. Pricing was obvious it wasn't real Japanese Kobe beef, but their pseduo Kobe beef tasted decent. It'd be  foolish to use real Wagyu Kobe beef as burger patties anyways!  Their cheesecake is on the heavy, sweet end. If you're looking for a slightly lighter, not overly sweet cheesecake, go for their Wild Blueberry White Chocolate or their Vanilla Bean."
Tatiana-Rose B.,"Cambridge, MA",392,6,3,4.0,4/25/2017,"So I showed up without a reservation with a party of ten for my birthday at dinner time during spring break (YIKES!). We were told they could only split us up in two five tops and they would try to seat us near each other. I ran into a manager named Kat. I mentioned to her we were there for my birthday and she said she would try to get us seated sooner and get us a table all together. She was so nice and reasonable, despite the restaurant being so hectic! Our wait was not very long, she personally saw us to the two tables 6/4 and after seeing 10 of us try squeeze into a six top booth, our waitress who's name I have regrettably forgotten asked us if we wanted to move to a much larger open table in a section of the restaurant that had previously been closed. We were so pleased! She was wonderful, and they were timely with the food. Cheesecake Factory is a good go to for me when I want to indulge and between the cheesecake and the strong long island iced tea and the special accommodation for our party size, we had a GREAT time!"
Tater M.,"New Haven, CT",9,117,566,5.0,12/26/2014,"This is my favorite cheesecake location because the staff are really nice and professional here and they time the food to table arrival time perfectly, the avocado spring roll appetizer always arrives crisp with the warm delicious gooey avocado pieces inside. The bread basket contains this brown chocolate looking toast that tastes amaaaazing. It's not chocolate but it's delicious!  The spaghetti with meatballs was surprisingly good, the marinara sauce was addictive, noodles were yummy, and best of all the meatballs were not boring, they had herbs and spices all over inside of them! The shepherds pie was very meh. Salty.. If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory location, portions are huge! Which is great to take back."
Amy B.,"Pownal, ME",0,11,,5.0,10/13/2016,My mother has a peanut allergy. It is hard to find a restaurant that takes the time to make sure the food is safe for my mother to eat. We walked in and the hostess told us to step aside and she would find out if my mother would be able to eat there. with in minutes the manager arrived and was happy to answer any questions. after assuring us that it was safe to eat there. we were seated. the manager alerted our waiter  and he came to the the table and told us he knew about moms allergy and would take care of her.   The food was wonderful as was the service.
Janelle G.,"Stoneham, MA",352,192,55,5.0,1/12/2015,"Went here on a Sunday brunch date because a nearby place, which will remain nameless, had a long line. NO WAIT for Sunday brunch, do you know how awesome that is to find in Boston?!?! Special menu too. Asked the waiter for a recommendation between the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles. He recommended the huevos rancheros and I was not disappointed! So good, cheesy, and the perfect amount of spice with sunny side up eggs. My date got a typical breakfast dish with eggs, toast, ham steak, and potatoes. Everything was so so good! I can't remember our waiters name (would love to give him a shout out cause of his friendly and helpful demeanor). Management, if you are reading this he looks like Adrian Grenier."
Tammy L.,"Boston, MA",39,160,2,1.0,5/12/2016,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Today we walked in and went to the cheesecake display/takeout section. We placed an order for a 6in chocolate mousse cheesecake and the cashier asked if we were OK with it being frozen. We said yes, paid, took our receipt, and then waited. 10 minutes flew by and we noticed the staff standing around doing nothing. So we asked about our order with a different cashier. She told us she didn't know about our order and went to check. She came back and said they'd run out of the 6inch cake but they had a 7inch. She went to get her manager, who then came up to us and said, ""Sorry we can't do that."" We were sooooo confused. Apparently cashier #2 told him we wanted the 7inch cake for the price of the 6inch. We hadn't asked for that. At all. So then he wanted to offer us a free slice on top of the 7inch cake that we had to pay the difference for. Nope, that's when we had had enough of this and asked for our money back.  Sorry, but I'm not stepping into a place of business where the manager starts off an apology by accusing us. His employees lied to our faces. That's that. UPDATE: Another manager called and apologized after my sister sent them a message online. Still, I'm not coming back to this location."
Kelly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,2,2.0,4/5/2017,Serving wasn't impressive since we had to wait until our server came. Other servers never cared us and told us wait. We two went there around 7pm and ordered one dish for each and could get out of there just before 9pm. One of worst experiences in CF.
Kristin A.,"Lynn, MA",168,9,,4.0,3/11/2016,"I've eaten here (except, well, the one in the North Shore) more times than I can count. Birthdays, graduations, date-nights, just because - you name it. The Cheesecake Factory is a great place and also well-known, the service is slow, the menu too big, but great quality and pretty pricey. This time however, the service was the best service I've ever had at a Cheesecake.  The place was pretty busy, it was a Saturday around 6pm. We didn't make a reservation, which got me hesitant to go there because usually the wait is about 30mins -1 hour without a reservation and at least 10-20 with one. They say us down immediately, gave us our appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering it. The cooks really do have to be appreciated here. They did a fantastic job. Although the waiter didn't come around as often as I would have liked, especially not have my drink refilled, was slightly annoying, but everything was fast. The appetizer was interrupted by our entree of Steak Diane (slightly salty, but great meat and mashed potatoes!). Although mine was over the medium-cooked amount I asked, it was still great and made for even better leftovers. For dessert, my boyfriend and I split a cookie-dough slice of cheesecake. It wasn't very good, and I usually love love love cookie-dough. The piece of cheesecake seemed frozen and hard to chew and that was two hours later as we had gotten it to go because we were too stuffed to eat any more. From previous visits, the strawberries is whipped cream is way underrated and the banana cheesecake is the best! Obviously, with any Cheesecake, you're going to have an expensive bill, but at least its better than subpar takeout!"
