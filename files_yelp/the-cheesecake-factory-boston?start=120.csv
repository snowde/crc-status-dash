Phil G.,"Cambridge, MA",6,10,,1.0,3/6/2016,"I usually love cheesecake factory.  I placed a take-out order and after being placed on hold for 15 minutes, I was able to speak to someone who put me on hold for another 7.  You'd think this is because they were busy but when I got there they were almost empty.   When I got to cheesecake factory, I asked for a latte with skim milk to be added to the order.  They then had to remake it when they added whole milk.  They then asked if I wanted utentsils and napkins, to which I answered yes.  They did not put utensils or napkins in the order. Overall, a bunch of small things went wrong that ultimately led to a terrible experience.  I love cheesecake factory in general, and I live right near this one so it's a shame that this venue is below the standard par of cheesecake factories."

Austin T.,"Andover, MA",0,4,,1.0,12/19/2016,Service sucks. All I wanted was a cafe mocha and somehow it took the employee 15min to make it. Doesn't take that long to make...
Olivia L.,"Rutland, MA",0,14,2,2.0,1/31/2017,"My review is based on my experience during Sunday brunch hours at this Cheesecake Factory location. Waitress was pleasant and service was prompt. The complimentary bread before the meal was delicious as usual, but the wheat toast that came with my omelette was dry and did not have a lick of butter on it. My boyfriend's pancakes were dry and came with maple syrup that was the consistency of milk and the color of a man's ejaculation. We paid $40 for dry toast and a mediocre omelette dry pancakes and an egg, and 2 drinks. Never again will we come to Cheesecake Factory for brunch or pay such a ridiculous amount of money for shitty breakfast food."
Dan Z.,"Boston, MA",0,12,13,5.0,3/11/2016,I chose this Cheesecake factory location as a blind date place for 2 of my friends and wanted to stress how great of the experience they've had at this restaurant. They were happy with the service and food. And the price is always great at Cheescake.  Thank you guys.
Marely M.,"Boston, MA",5,34,59,4.0,2/26/2015,"Yay yay yay I love this place. The location is perfect. The service is fast and very good. The place is big enough to accommodate big crowds. This place do get filled up so try to make a reservation. The food is super delicious. Whenever I go, I can't help to always order the shrimp Scampy, super delicious. However, the last time I went for a friend birthday celebration, I choose the Chiken Katsu. OMG! It's amazing! Much better than the one at Wagamana. That place rocks!  Did I mention the ambiance is great?!  And Au don't think I have to mentions their desserts."
Lindsay M.,"Boston, MA",5,89,,5.0,7/17/2016,"I don't care that it's pricey, they are always consistently good, so many options you really can't go wrong. Plus, there's nothing wrong with a cheesecake slice or two to go! Just don't go when it's a prime time for dinner or lunch or else you will wait forever."
Vicky H.,"Boston, MA",353,459,1340,1.0,1/17/2013,"It has been a few months since I came here so my friend and I decided to come back to eat. I am on a more strict diet so there are things I wouldn't be able to eat. The menu is huge -- more like a book so it does take a while get through it and check out what you want.  The place, usually around dinner time is very busy with long waits. We didn't wait long, probably about 7 minutes or so. Could have been worse, i suppose. We waited over 30 minutes once and still had to wait another minute or 2 even after our buzzer lit up.  After we placed our drink order, it took awhile to get to us - it was only water. I don't know why it took so long. Maybe they took a while to cut the lemon and lime? The bread came out and they were out of wheat so all we got were white bread which my friend and I both really care for. The waiter apologized and could get us a fresh batch but there might be a few minute wait because they were out of it. We were ok with that.  We didn't order an appetizer but just went straight for our entrees. My friend order her usual and I ordered the Grilled Salmon. It came with Broccoli and Mashed potatoes. I can't eat potatoes so opted for another green side - asparagus.  The bread finally came and we were both starving. That was good. I chose not to put butter and it was still good. (Usually i smother it with butter... mmmm).  Our entrees took a little while. The broccoli looked like they were previously frozen florets. When you bite into it, it wasn't exactly like fresh ones either -- taste just like previously frozen florets. There was no flavor to it, no crispiness, just very limpy. The asparagus was a little bit over looked and limpy as well. I do have to say, the Salmon was done just right. It was a good size piece and was not over cooked. I am however, disappointed in the 6 pieces of asparagus.  We waited for the water to be refilled but that never came. When it did, we were pretty much done with our meals.  Finally, after much wait, the check came. I was in shock they charge an extra $1 for asparagus. I asked the waiter about it. He said the computer automatically charged me it because I substituted a different side. When did this happen??? There was nothing written on the menu that they'd charge you extra for sides. What if you can't eat certain foods?? So obsurb and never heard of. He apologized for it but didn't offer to talk to a manager... so we opted to give less than our usual generous 20% tip because clearly he didn't deserve it.  We didn't get dessert either because neither of us were happy with the service and didn't want to stay longer than we had to."
Isabella C.,"San Francisco, CA",294,170,407,4.0,9/18/2014,"4 stars for the cheesecake, 3 stars for the food. Let's be real. I don't think we go to the Cheesecake Factory for the food.  They do have a nice range of options on the menu but I find that nothing tends to stand out very much. I've had most of their pastas and usually they're quite bland. They do have different sauces and taste accordingly, but generally there are no spices or special flavors used to accentuate the natural taste of the vegetables/meats in the dish. The one appetizer I've had that really stands out is the Buffalo Blasts. They're fried balls of Buffalo chicken bits and cheese and they taste heavenly though they're also extremely greasy... My favorite salad is the Luau salad and not surprisingly, it errs on the unhealthier side of salads.  I would definitely recommend sharing main courses and appetizers per table instead of each ordering a main because the serving sizes are very generous. It's important to make sure to save room for cheesecake at the end! And on that note, I'll just say that I think the best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the range of choice you get with cheesecakes. I've made it a personal goal to never repeat a flavor and to be honest, they're all amazing in their own way. The texture of the cheesecake tends to be fairly consistent regardless of flavor."
Jade K.,"Cambridge, MA",227,3,1,4.0,4/25/2016,"Food was pretty good - I went with a party of four, and we rarely go to Cheesecake so we didn't really know what to get, but our server, Matt Yang, definitely made the experience a lot better! He was friendly, helped us make our food choices, and was very professional."
Lin N.,"Medford, MA",0,2,,2.0,7/16/2016,It's a good place to go if you want steak. But bad service!!! We are Asian so the waitress looks so unhappy. And we got the bread after ours meals. That's ridiculous ！！ Never come back!!
Angie G.,"Calumet City, IL",55,13,9,3.0,11/1/2015,Food was great Jamaican chicken and shrimp was awesome  my honey had the bacon bacon burger it was great as well
Elizabeth D.,"New York, NY",0,1,1,1.0,1/1/2017,"The portion sizes in our to go order were quite small as compared to other locations in the area (my husband knew I went to this location as soon as he opened the first container). When I called to complain, I was told to either bring the food back or take a picture and bring it in. When I explained that we live 30 mins away and they closed in 10 mins, she apologized and said they either need the food back or a photo in order to reimburse the purchase. I have never been nickel and dimed by a restaurant, particularly a chain reataurant, in this way. They should be ashamed. I recommend going elsewhere for your food, unless you enjoy paying high prices for less food."
Fer C.,"Woburn, MA",0,2,,4.0,12/26/2015,"I just had lunch at the C.K. Pearl and we had a really great time. A surprisingly good restaurant with fresh good, nice view of the water (marshland) and really happy servers.  We ordered a large clam chowder, mussels for appetizer and fish and chips. I shared between me and husband, and it was plenty. I ordered more of the crostinis to have the mussel juice after.  The plates were delicious and fresh, one of the best we had in the area. Also it was not expensive at all, but we didn't have any drinks.  I also ordered a kids menu for my 4 year old son and I thought it was great quality, with a good selection.  The dessert menu is not that great do that's why we are giving the 4 star review.I would definitely come back."
Aj T.,"Harvard Square, Boston, MA",133,22,38,3.0,10/22/2014,The chocolate something shake is really nice. They hardly have any purely vegetarian options but ask the server and they'll ask the chef to speak with you. (They will give quite a few options) Ambience is nice. But loud at times. Pasta is good. They don't have any eggless cheesecakes / no vegan ones :(
Lea L.,"Brookline, MA",77,7,,5.0,5/31/2016,"Matthew H was an amazing server! Really attentive, took time with us. Will definitely come back!"
Rachel M.,"New York, NY",47,61,,4.0,8/13/2015,"I've always lived in a city, and in NYC for the last 13 years, so The Cheesecake Factory is not a go-to (maybe I've been to one 5 times during my 50+ years of age).  But I have to tell you, I've never been disappointed in the quality of the food (and I'm a bit picky, i.e. I like the food to be fresh, interesting, and well presented).  While in Boston I almost always stay at the Hilton Back Bay (across the street from The Cheesecake Factory) & today when I arrived in town I wanted to sit outside and chose this place for lunch.  I loved my waiter (Kevin), who recommended Sylia's (I think that's her name) Chicken & Avocado salad. And.....last week I was in Providence RI, and while waiting for the train (the Amtrak station is right across the street from the Cheesecake Factory), I sat at the bar & discovered their $5 Happy Hour food items (had the Avocado Egg Rolls - try to avoid fried food but these were pretty darn good) & a regulation salad. Would I normally write a review on Yelp for a chain restaurant - NO!  But twice in the last 2 weeks The CF has been a restaurant of convenience, the meals have been more than satisfactory, and the service I got today was outstanding, thus the reason for this post."
Kárenly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,55,170,4.0,7/21/2014,"The most important thing I have to say is that there's no plate that can be complete without the Strawberry Lemonade. Finding variety in a restaurant menu is quite the hard task around the area, but thanks to this restaurant I can just come and eat plates from around the world without the overpriced expenses.  My favorites are the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the flatbreads. In the least favorite plates, I would have to add the White Chcken Chili since it lacks flavor and it's really watery."
Michelle L.,"Warwick, RI",0,22,2,4.0,9/7/2015,"We only came in for desert and coffee.  Both were out of this world amazing good!   We sat in the bar area and  didn't have to wait.  The bar had a stench of a dirty dish rag.  The bathroom was a mess, overflowing trash and no toilet paper in some of the stalls."
Brittany T.,"Cambridge, MA",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2017,"This doesn't even deserve one star. Had the worst experience here. First the server took a very long time coming to greet the table. She never wrote down our order and a minute later she came back to ask my friend what he had ordered again. My food came and it was wrong so I told her and she seemed annoyed that I was complaining. For her screw up. Then she brings me the correct food and I take one bite and there is a hair in it! When I brought it to her attention she asked to see the hair. Then said she couldn't see it. I just asked her to bring me a cheesecake menu so I can order dessert and go home. She had an attitude the whole time. The manager came out at my request and assured me that she would talk to her. And I was very upset when my cheesecake wasn't comped. After such a bad experience, I felt like that was a very reasonable request. And luckily, the red Sandrea and the Tara Massoud cheesecake were both out of this world amazing! That was the only thing that saved my night."
