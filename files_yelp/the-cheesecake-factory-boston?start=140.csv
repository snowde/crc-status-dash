Sara T.,"Brighton, MA",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2016,The cheesecakes in here are great; Specially the fresh strawberry cheesecake. The place is classy and beautiful and the customer service is great.
Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,2.0,2/24/2015,"Yikes!  I was in the Prudential Center and needed to kill some time on a Saturday morning.  I wanted to get lunch but didn't feel like hoofing it over to Copley in the rain to Legals (yeah, I know there's a skybridge), so I talked myself into enchiladas from Cheesecake Factory.  Since it was early, I figured I wouldn't have a problem getting a seat at the bar.  It was empty on a Saturday afternoon and that should have been a red flag. Now I'm not expecting dinner and a show, but I do expect some type of friendly engagement with a bartender.  You'd think that since Saturday mornings at noon aren't exactly heavy drinking times, if you were a bartender, you would at least chat up your guests to see how they're doing, talk about the weather, or ask if they were from Boston ... anything.  This bartender wanted to be anywhere but at work.  I sat down at the bar, perused the menu and was greeted with ""Whatdaya want to drink?""  Is this a diner on a New Jersey roadside? I ordered lunch and he chatted up a buddy of his at the bar in regards to their latest gym session.  I had some time to kill, not all afternoon.  It must have been at least five minutes before he put my order in the computer.  Since it wasn't too busy, I figured it wouldn't take too long.   My lunch came out and it was just as delicious as I've had in the past.  I ate quickly and then practically had to flag the bartender down to run my credit card through.   I'm definitely thinking that I won't be back at this location any time soon.  I'm sure the other staff are friendly and efficient, but since I'm frequently over here by myself, I don't think I'd be apt to sit at the bar.  Bar-goers beware!"
Delante B.,"Boston, MA",51,40,6,4.0,8/2/2015,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, nothing too different in terms of food and ambience from anywhere around the country. We had brunch here with friends visiting from California. The good thing about this brunch is that it will hold you over all day. No small portions here for he price. They definitely get a star for that.  I take a star off since they had trouble giving us good seating, and the potatoes were way too salty.  Nevertheless, I'd go back here again for brunch. Perfect spot to go to before attending waking tours. Might just be my meal for the day."
Amanda L.,"Boston, MA",67,171,,2.0,5/15/2015,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but alas, I think I've finally grown up and have realized how mediocre it really is.  Before I start my rant on yesterday's 'meh' experience I'd like to clarify - the cheesecake is still BOMB. My boyfriend and I got the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to take home and share over the next few days. It's seriously rich, but seriously delicious. Now, back to yesterday's experience. When we got there around 6/6:15 there was a short wait. We put our name in for 2 and stayed in front of the host stand. 15 minutes went by and we noticed people were going up to the stand (after we had already been there) and were being called before us. Hmm. My boyfriend went to check on the status of our table and the hostess rudely mentioned she had called his name. Mmmmm. Nope. So we waited a few more minutes until she felt it was appropriate to have someone seat us. Another girl brought us to our table. We went to the right of the host stand, along the wall to the back of the bar area, left into the bar area, and through the bar area back up to the front. In short, we could have turned left at the host stand and saved a minute or two weaving through congestion. Le sigh. Apparently being a host at this place requires having a pulse. A brain? Not necessary. Our server was friendly, quick to bring the beverages and gave us an ample amount of time to review the novel of a menu this place has.  Sidenote: my boyfriend always wants to avoid TCF claiming the menu is too big and they make everything 'fine' but nothing 'well.' In short, it's been a challenge to get him to want to come here with me in our two years of being together. Anywho, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Thank God my boyfriend doesn't read Yelp reviews because it was exactly how he describes food at TCF - 'fine.' The sauce was 'nice' with a good amount of heat, but the dish was covered in toasted coconut that seemed like it would have gone better with a dessert than a savory dish. In short, this visit made me realize how many better options there are in Boston for dining out. I've realized why I haven't been back to the Cheesecake Factory in so long, and why I won't be going back any time soon unless it's to grab a piece of cheesecake to go."
Alexandra M.,"Boston, MA",455,1359,2040,4.0,10/25/2013,"Great food, okay service, HUGE portions. Do your inner kid a favor and get the fried mac n cheese balls, as a starter. My friend was a bit worried about the sauce but it blew his mind how well it worked--I already knew it did because its my fav item. If you order from tge skinny menu it might be cheaper than the regular menu! My veggie burger didnt compromise on flavor either. I always have to get the cheesecake to go because the portions are so big! I guess that's why you pay a bit more...do the kid another favor and get the smores one. Served with fluff on top. Our service was fine but we waited a bit at first and saw others who ordered after us get food first."
Claire G.,"Arlington, MA",109,59,3,3.0,12/21/2014,"I have mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory in general. I love the fried macaroni balls and the food is usually decent. However, the menu is definitely way too extensive and overwhelming. I don't trust places that serve ten different styles of cuisine. I would rather go to a place that specializes in one thing. In sum, Cheesecake is okay if you don't mind waiting around an hour for a table and like mediocre food. But I say scratch that and head to a local place around the corner."
Querby J.,"Everett, MA",122,65,134,3.0,3/23/2016,So this Cheesecake Factory has a lot of good and bad things about it. Okay let's first start off with the fact that they don't take reservations so depending on what day and time you go be prepared for a wait. Because I've been here before on a Saturday and it was packed with an hour wait. But I came here today on a Wednesday night and there was no wait at all. So it's pretty much luck of the draw. I went with a group of 4 and managed to get a booth seat. As an appetizer I got the buffalo wings. They were good but the skin was kind of chewy. The buffalo wings aren't that spicy so those with timid taste buds have no fear. My friend asked for the shrimp scampi pasta and they messed up her order so make sure your waiter understands your order. As a quick side note the bathroom here is mad nice. The lighting in there (and the whole restaurant at that) is really dim. Nice for the atmosphere but terrible for pictures (hence why my food pictures suck & I'm not a good photographer). My main dish I got the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a person that enjoys extremely spicy food and the description of the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta said that it was in a very spice sauce and it really wasn't even that spicy. So don't be fooled. It's still a great dish though (enjoy the picture of me obnoxiously eating my pasta). For the desert I got the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. Okay this had to be my favorite part of the meal! I'm not usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake surprisingly. But this one has me re-questioning not liking their cheesecake because this cheesecake was fucking delicious! If you're a fan of caramel this is the one for you. Delicious and it cuts real smooth. Make sure to get the whip cream with it!
Ngan T.,"Palo Alto, CA",434,266,30,1.0,10/6/2013,"I love food from the cheesecake factory--don't get me wrong. I've eaten from enough cheesecake factories to know this menu top to bottom, front to back. So as you can expect, I've got a couple things Ialways order and a couple of preferences that come with it. Here's how my experience usually pans out at this location: Get seated, wait, give up and get up to find a waiter, put in an order for the miso salmon with white rice and extra sauces on the wide. After not seeing my waiter, hail one down for bread and butter. Salmon comes without extra sauces and occasionally brown rice instead of white. I'll wait ten minutes after I've licked my plate clean before waiter comes back.  Anyway, you get the point. I love this place because it has everything but it's always terrible service. As for the other dishes--well with this menu, everyone can find something they like. I like the crab cakes. There's just enough crab meat to keep me from complaining for more. Calamari is usually done right. but the dipping sauce has too much....is it horseradish in that thing? I'm not a fan. Most of the pasta dishes not in a red sauce are VERY salty. Eater beware. I love their milkshakes from here teehee And you definitely can't leave without a slice of cheesecake. They're all delicious so do yourself a favor and order an extra one to bring home :]"
Abby R.,"Cambridge, MA",585,267,38,2.0,9/16/2014,"It's definitely not the best location of this chain. The inside is laid out very awkwardly, almost like there are two different restaurants that sort of melted together.  I haven't loved my food here as much as at some of the other cheesecake factory locations, maybe the traffic from all the tourists makes it hard to do each meal right."
Baran A.,"Boston, MA",8,34,6,4.0,5/7/2016,Had dinner with friends here last night - had to wait 45 minutes to get a table but had a pleasant evening and our server made all the difference - 5 star minus 1 for the long wait
Brigitte O.,"Huntington, NY",18,1,,1.0,10/15/2016,Waited for 2 omelets for 1 hour. Really? Spoke with 3 people who were very apologetic but still waiting for our breakfast. Absolutely rediculous!! Didn't even want to give 1 star but Yelp made me:(
Kaitie R.,"Osceola County, FL",57,6,1,5.0,6/15/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory here is really so amazing, I don't know why it has so few stars! The past few times I've been here has always been as a treat after a long hard day, and let me say, it is ALWAYS a treat. The server Shayne is so nice and considerate, and we've had servers who are even better. On one occasion, they even brought us boxes and packing tape to our table when we had to move on short notice. Again - they're amazing! Our favorite things to eat here are the Friend Macaroni and Cheese, and any of the pastas. The cheesecake, of course, is unsurpassed - the Fresh Banana, S'Mores, and Ultimate Red Velvet probably at the top of my list. It's really a classy and delicious place to spend your evening. And, for Sunday brunch, the breakfast Monte Cristo sandwich gives me cravings for weeks afterward.  Amazing."
A J.,"Boston, MA",0,5,1,2.0,7/9/2014,"Drinks are good but barely any alcohol in them ...lots of sugar, purée and Ice. I like most of the apps but I had pasta there for the third time at different sites and the fettuccini Alfredo is SO greasy and oily. I have never seen a place use so much d**n oil on pasta? On top of that the pasta doesn't taste like anything at all. The sauce is tasteless, the chicken is tasteless...I had to add crushed red peppers, salt and pepper...I shouldn't have to.  The girl at the bar (our server) was super nice though."
Narcissus A.,"Salem, MA",5,16,2,1.0,8/8/2014,"A star goes out to you, with great disappointment cause I actually love this place and the food. I'm giving you only 1 star because of your cocky, racist bartender. After holding onto my international ID for 5 minutes, he kept telling me it's a federal law to carry my passport around and that I could be arrested for not having it. (WHICH IS TOTAL BS) he kept laughing because apparently I was unaware of the ridiculous law  Most restaurants in Boston take my ID, I explained to him I was there for 4 days and my passport has important visas in it that cannot be retrieved that easily if lost. Then he laughed and kept telling me if get arrested for it. You know what? I just got up and left and took the party of 6 away with me. The service was rude and horrible"
Dorjee N.,"Allston, MA",0,5,,1.0,6/29/2015,"Horrible waiter! Was extremely unfriendly. Came with a group of friends to celebrate my graduation and unfortunately we ended up with the one of the worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever. The waiter was just plain rude from the beginning. We hardly saw him, had to flag down other waiters to just get water. The appetizers came with the food even though we specifically asked for them to be prepared and served in advance. When confronted about this, the waiter instead of understanding our disappointment, was just plain dismissive.  We are used to fast service, so anything over an hour is too long, and yes the wait was definitely longer than an hour, and we sat there without any refills on water, or anything edible for that period of time.  Never going back. Avoid this location!"
Elleen P.,"Boston, MA",82,511,256,4.0,2/18/2015,"I looove Cheesecake Factory -- reminds me of times when i was back home and my parents would take us every Friday night. Good times :"")  That being said, the food is pretty consistent with other Cheesecake Factories I've eaten at. My recommendations: the calamari, cajun jambalaya pasta, and avocado eggrolls. I like the red velvet cheesecake on occasion as well, but it does get a little sweet. Don't get the vanilla bean cheesecake -- sooo sickeningly sweet :( Food isn't healthy whatsoever but sometimes you need your fill of fattening, artery-clogging food. Service was good too, our waitress was attentive and quick in bringing us menus, our food, water, etc. Would recommend, especially if you like other CFs since they're pretty similar."
Michael C.,"Alameda, CA",89,257,59,3.0,7/9/2013,"To me the Cheesecake Factory looks like Walt Disney threw up in this place.  Too much tacky decor.  The menu is a book, I just want a few simple things.  The food is so so, it's an upscale Apple Bee's (ouch right!). They could not over decorate and lower the menu prices, I mean I like the place but don't like the touristy prices. Of course any type of chocolate cheese cake  saved the day!"
J T.,"Cambridge, MA",48,89,58,4.0,12/4/2013,"If the machines in""The Matrix"" tried to create a three or four star, vaguely Italian catch-all chain of restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory is what they might come up with. The ambiance is impressive, on the brink of oppressive, with soft lighting, walls that imply rustic texture, and ornamental fixtures at every turn (of which there are many). Indeed, every inch of the cheesecake factory seems to have been designed with care and intelligence for a life-like traditional dining experience. It is this impeccable attention to detail, multiplied by 1000, which results in something other than coziness. There are few if any dusty corners, no cracks to go along with the vintage plaster appearance of the walls, no fading of the colors or warping of the glass. In short, it's perfect in a way that life is not. The menu is absurd and overwhelming. Maybe it's designed to provide for the varied desires of large groups, on multiple occasions, or maybe it's just a show of corporate force. Either way you simply can't comprehend the full extent of the choices.  This begs the question, what is it that you're supposed to think of when you consider the cheesecake factory? Well, namely, cheesecake. It's a megalith built on the idea of dessert, but outrageously overblown.  Even the servers are sanitized and multiplied, dozens of them on any given night, dressed all in white instead of the usual black. Unique? Yes. When multiplied by dozens upon dozens? Not so much. Which brings it back to the patrons. Somehow the place doesn't, and I suspect couldn't, ever really feel full. Even when every one of the hundreds of seats is filled The Cheesecake Factory has the feeling of exactly that, a factory. Customers are the raw material. Money is the product. Food is just the process..."
M Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,49,15,1.0,7/31/2014,"OMG the whole restaurant floor is covered in grease!!! Can't even walk a few feet without slipping.... Such a hazard and liability, how do they not fall!!! There's NO paper towels in the bathroom. So unkept. Traveling from California, I expected a chain restaurant to have standards! I must add that the service was nice and pleasant. Thank goodness!"
Igor R.,"Brookline, MA",0,22,,4.0,9/4/2016,"This was a surprisingly nice place, the food was decent, the prices ok. (One star off for not so clean tableware)"
