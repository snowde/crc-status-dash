Gabe M.,"Boston, MA",16,8,12,4.0,9/2/2014,"My group of four ate here near just a few days ago a little after 10 PM. Luckily the wait was about ten minutes (just as the hostess had estimated). The host staff were very friendly. I did notice on our way to the table the the floor is very slick and must have grease or something on it. After being seated we began looking through the menu. Our waiter was awkward, but did get our orders right. I would have to note though that I had to ask for a straw three times and we had to ask for refills on drinks everytime. I have eaten at this specific store two prior times though and the waitstaff was much better each time.  The four of us ordered the macoroni and cheese burger with vegetarian patty, chicken and buscuit, BBQ chicken salad and a regular cheeseburger. I sampled a bit of everything and it was all delicious as always. We each got a piece of cheesecake as well and they all did not dissapoint.  Vegetarian options here are pretty decent considering that there is a veggie patty for burgers as well as salads and pastas that can be ordered without the meat(s).  I'm giving this four stars because the food and sweets are very delicious, there is a great selection (almost too big though), the room we were in was near a window and not too crowded or dark, and although the waiter on this occasion wasn't the most pleasant or helpful.  I would love to give a five star rating, but the greasy floor and not as clean as I would have expected bathroom situation had me a little worried about the kitchen situation and the waiter we had this time left us frustrated at times.  I do plan on going back again, especially when visitors come to town."
Abbie M.,"Boston, MA",1061,297,164,2.0,11/5/2012,"Everyone likes cheesecake. I mean, it's almost as American as apple pie.  However, I do not understand the huge hype around Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the ones in Providence, Braintree, and Boston, and they are consistently mediocre and overpriced. The cheesecake is yummy, for sure. Everything else is just meh. Their menu is like a book but it's not a good thing, it takes me 20 minutes just to read, and when I'm done I don't even want to order anything. Nothing jumps out. It's almost too much. Not only that, but everything is an enormous portion with thousands of calories - they consistently top lists of least-healthy foods.  The one thing I love here is the brown bread they serve to start the meal. I've had the carbonara (sans peas) and it's fine. Orange chicken is fine. The Caesar salad tastes rancid - so bad that I sent it back (at two different places!).  Try somewhere local instead."
Yuliana D.,"Manhattan, NY",11,114,88,5.0,2/22/2015,Amazing service!  Great managers and serves.  Fantastic service.  Cheesecakes - well:-). It's a chain.  They have awesome selection.   Nice place to enjoy desert.  This is NOT people watching spot though.
Brian B.,"Rochester, NY",59,51,,3.0,2/20/2016,Ordered the chicken salad and chicken chili. Both were very tasty. We went at a busy time but the service was still great.
Kat M.,"Toronto, Canada",167,109,193,3.0,7/27/2014,"My first food stop during my trip to Boston was at this restaurant. My initial impression of the place was that it is a typical chain restaurant in terms of decor and menu items. They do offer a ""skinnylicious"" menu for those that are watching their calories.  I ordered the crab cake bites to start. I did not find anything too special about these items except that they were edible. I also ordered the smoked salmon spring rolls which I would suggest not ordering as they were not very impressive. I found the smoked salmon spring rolls to be bland and I essentially had to drench them in the sweet chill sauce that they came with in order to add some flavour to it.  For dessert I had the classic cheesecake with glazed strawberry. This cake is to die for. Absolutely heavenly. The cheesecake itself isn't dense and heavy, it was surprisingly light in texture and flavour and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. The pie crust was a tad salty with hints of cinnamon flavour - a very good complement to the sweet cheesecake it holds. I really loved this dessert and recommend it to anyone craving something sweet. Overall, this restaurant was OK. Typical chain restaurant meals but the cheesecake is definitely worth ordering and eating."
K J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,38,,1.0,5/25/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is poor in both service, food quality, and cleanliness. Did I mention there are mice running through the dinning room floor?  The floors are slippery from grime, and several tabletops slippery from not being properly cleaned."
Devika G.,"Boston, MA",59,46,5,3.0,11/27/2014,"Always love coming back to cheesecake the only fact I dislike is it makes a hole in my pocket because i overboard with orders, only because the food is so good. Avocado egg rolls, Chicken chipolate pasta are my all time faves. Also the chicken samosas and veggie burger are to be tried. I am sure all the dishes here are hands down delicious. The other prob is long waiting line. Cheesecake at pru is the largest restaurant I have ever seen but still they always have waiting which again speaks for itself. And love their quantity. And lets not even start talking about the cheescakes. All are just fabulous. Also should try the cocktail named *something gorilla* its yummmm!!  Overall great place to eat and chit chat."
Jingyao Z.,"Allston/Brighton, Boston, MA",26,23,78,5.0,9/7/2014,I love the high dome and fancy pattern decorated walls here. Warm sunshine throughout the window with excellent service. Afternoon tea time  for girls or energy station while shopping.
Claire L.,"Quincy, MA",0,13,,5.0,5/15/2016,"My friends took me here, I loved here, just fantastic!!!! I like Hibachi steak from here!"
Brendan W.,"Marshfield, MA",0,2,1,5.0,2/2/2016,First time going to The Cheese Cake Factory was not disappointed.  Went after lunch crowd so wait wasn't long at all. Looking forward to going back again soon.
Sandra T.,"Vancouver, Canada",491,221,344,4.0,7/18/2014,"Always a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  There isn't a CF near me - closest is a 3-hour drive away so I always put it on my list wherever I go, as it's always a comfortable and safe bet where ever you are. My husband and I had just flown in, left our luggage at our hotel, and walked over to Cheesecake Factory as we were tired from the early flight, hungry to search for much else and wanted something sit-down.  The menu ceases to amaze us every time because all the food we've ever had has been great and you have LOTS and LOTS to choose from.  We were seated immediately at around 11:30am as the restaurant was hardly busy, maybe because they had just opened a half hour prior. Our server was super nice. Really perky and thorough with all the questions we had.  Maybe a little too perky. We almost always order the avocado egg rolls because they are pretty amazing, but decided to try things we've never tried before.  We went with the fire roasted chili rellenos, the chop salad, and salmon that was wrapped in a wonton wrapper.  Everything we had was pretty delicious!  The salad was fresh, the salmon didn't taste too fish'y, and the chili rellenos had a good amount of spice with lots of sauce surrounding it. Like I said, can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory, but once my husband and I went exploring Copley Square area a bit more, we knew we should have eaten at one of those cute outdoor café's on Newbury street.  Oh well, still a really good meal."
Megan B.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,3.0,4/18/2014,"It's your standard Cheesecake Factory--huge space, huge portions of expectantly good food, and extravagant generic pseudo-Middle Eastern decor.  What I like about this place is the location. The Back Bay is a fine-dining mecca, there's no doubt about it. However, a lot of the venues are small, easily crowded, and quite honestly, feel like a gamble if you've never been there before.  Sometimes, you just don't want to deal with all that, and that's where good old Cheesecake Factory comes into play. The Cheesecake Factory is conveniently located on the Huntington side of The Shops at the Prudential Center. Around lunch, it's never busy so it's perfect for someone trying to escape their workplace breakroom to grab a quick lunch. The restaurant is HUGE, so when you spy a huge family with a crying baby settling in for dinner, you don't even sweat it--they might as well be miles away, you won't even be bothered by them.  My favorite thing to do here is to grab drinks with my co-workers after working late. The service is quick, drinks are strong, and the price is right!"
Heather S.,"Hope, RI",11,37,3,4.0,7/22/2014,"After a long day of walking around Boston in the heat and burning up 1400 calories from all the walking decided to treat ourselves to some desert while we waited for the Boston traffic to subside.  Dulche de leche cheescake according to husband was fabulous but really 1080 calorie? However very tasty.  Strawberry shortcake was massive and probably one of the very best I have ever had. This could feed a table of 4+ it was so big. Needless to say I only ate less than half. Again as I was waiting for the dish researched and found it had 880 calories so my enjoyment of is was a bit guilt driven.  Anyone who is health conscious like my family I would highly recommended looking at the nutritional sites and avoid this place. While again it was very good the popularity of this place is really contributing to the obesity problem in the country there are 166 menu items that are over 1,000 calories...just walk by!"
Rachel C.,"Boston, MA",151,28,,3.0,8/12/2014,"PSA: A food coma WILL occur after your meal. Who goes to the Cheesecake Factory and orders just exclusively Mexican dishes? Me. But I've gotta say--the chicken quesadilla is pretty bomb (my go to dish--probably ordered it 5 times). I can't exactly say the same for the massive burrito I ordered that I couldn't exactly finish, nor could I say the same for the avocado rolls I ordered. What was I thinking?  I don't really know. I guess my strive for novelty and new tastes worked against my liking. The two previously mentioned above were extremely sub-par meals. The factory nachos, however, were to die for--although they were a bit too spicy for my liking, nevertheless, it was a flavorful explosion.  The Godiva cheesecake, I must say, is absolutely fantastic. It may or may have not been more fantastic if I hadn't engulfed a massive burrito prior to the engagement. Oh, and the Godiva sundae was alright...there was barely any ice cream on it though...Extremely chocolate-ty though.  I think this should be a lesson for y'all, save room for dessert if you can."
Judy C.,"Hingham, MA",0,13,,5.0,7/23/2016,"Had a great lunch experience.   Food was delicious and plentiful but the whole experience was made even better by Bryce, our waiter who was outstanding!!!!"
Laura B.,"Fall River, MA",69,303,37,2.0,9/6/2012,"If it wasn't for the semi-decent quality of the food this review would be a single star. Went Sunday during a break from seeing the tattoo convention and got the flakiest, most befuddled service I've ever experienced outside of a Waffle House. Our young, brunette waitress took forever to take our order and then kept promising us bread and not bringing it. When the table that arrived next to us the sat down half an hour after we arrived they got bread and service immediately (from a different, older staff member) while we were still waiting for our entrees to come out.  Asked for a salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and she brought me bottles of oil and vinegar. Bread finally came out after entrees and we were told ""guess this can be your dessert, ha ha."" Rude, awful service in a restaurant mainly being staffed by college kids makes me wish I had talked to a manager before I left. I will *never* be eating here when I'm at the Prudential Center again, and with service as awful as theirs I don't recommend you eat here either."
Nancy S.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,2.0,4/21/2016,"I ordered takeout tonight which I've done several times.  I had the Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich. It was awful.  First,, you cannot pick the sandwich up so you can't eat it like you would a sandwich.  Everything falls out, mostly the shredded lettuce and the tomatoes are slippery so they slide out; also the tomatoes are not ripe and they were hard and tasteless. The chicken was overcooked so it was dry and stringy and had no seasoning and also was too large for the sandwich.  It also was not a club sandwich; usually clubs are three pieces of thinly sliced bread, not two very thick pieces. I think you should rethink this menu item and evaluate the preparation."
Mo T.,"Falmouth, MA",2,39,,1.0,11/10/2015,"Completely terrible staff. We requested a booth and we had to wait with everyone else. Then when we were placed in a tiny ""booth"", we requested it to be changed. The hostess put us in the bottom of the list and we ended up waiting again. I requested to speak with the manager who couldn't care less about our predicament.  We left and went to Capital Grille which was awesome."
Ziqiu Z.,"Toronto, Canada",70,127,344,2.0,8/23/2015,wonder how the chain formed... got the salted caramel and it was no more than just okay probably not returning pricey ($8+for one piece)
Peter C.,"Munford, TN",2,61,8,4.0,9/5/2015,"It's the chain, quality is as expected, but this location is in a beautiful setting. Plus, great cheesecake-tiramisu is wonderful."
