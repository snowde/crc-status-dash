Ellen R.,"Piru, CA",0,16,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Food is ok, not worth the price by any means. Asked for goat cheese instead of blue cheese on a salad and was charged $6 extra. It would have been better if they had just stolen my wallet, at least that would have made a better story."
Kristine A.,"Boston, MA",223,434,10,2.0,4/16/2014,"Everybody knows how extremely large their menu is as it is a chain restaurant. There is usually a long wait that goes along w/ this joint. Let's get something straight though, when people are here for lunch don't take your time. We are not here to shoot the shit & be lazy. You obviously see us there eyeing you down to take our order, so hurry up for cripes sake. Have the decency to check on us & also don't make us wait for the check, I mean seriously? Get w/ the program."
Art B.,"East Wareham, MA",40,106,202,2.0,3/4/2014,"It was a disappointing experience. Everyone who ordered red meat described their meal as ""okay"" and ""very salty."" I had the wasabi crusted tuna, which I would recommend if you want a large portion of mediocre and surprisingly bland fish. Another ordered their ""spiciest dish,"" some new chicken thing which was neither spicy nor particularly tasty. The best thing on the table was likely the kale salad. Not planning going back."
Israel H.,"New York, NY",522,572,165,3.0,7/26/2012,"I was here last summer and the place is the most crowded cheesecake factory I have ever been to... Unfortunately, this means that the service is very slow and bartenders have no time for those actually sitting in front of them... OK not ""no time"" but very little. Food was consistent to cheesecake factory standards."
Anna A.,"Medford, MA",0,24,,5.0,2/19/2014,"I just want to say is very difficult to make everyone happy, however, when we leave work and we come to this place, the attention to our family is fear. Besides, I'm writing this review because last time we went, Diana, our waitress, was the best ever, she was polite and really took care of us, she understands the concept of family. Our meals were fantastic! End of the story."
Selena T.,"Boston, MA",47,35,12,5.0,2/19/2013,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Just don't go here if you're on a diet, although they do have a skinnylicious menu. The service really makes this place great. I've been here multiple times and each time, my waiter/waitress introduces his/herself, regularly checks up on us and asks us if everything is alright, and brings out our food quickly. Some of the staff here take their time to actually talk to their customers and hold small conversations with them. Overall, I really love their staff.  Another nice thing about this restaurant is the design of the place. I love looking around because the lighting is slightly dim and it has a nice feel to it.  Whenever I come here, I always get the strawberry lemonade. They rim the cup with sugar and my friends can't help but sneak a sip of my drink. It's delicious. Their food will be the reason I die young. I love their spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Again, not the kind of food you would eat if you're trying to be healthy, but it's great for satisfying your guilty conscience. Their portions are huge and often times I have to get my food to go because there's so much of it! The mini crab cakes, fried calamari, and avocado eggrolls here are all tasty as well. If you get the factory famous meatloaf here, you wont regret it. I've loved everything I've tried from this place and can't wait to try out more things on their menu!"
Orly R.,"Montreal, Canada",13,117,12,4.0,5/19/2015,Great food and service! I ordered the angel hair with shrimp and it was delicious. There is always a long line at the cheese cake factory but they did their best to have everyone seated as fast as possible. I would definitely go back. :)
Hector G.,"Victoria, TX",0,15,22,5.0,6/30/2015,Service and food was great!I recommend this place especially if you want a relaxing environment.
Joli A.,"Boston, MA",1,71,4,4.0,5/27/2015,"I'm not a fan of cheesecake but The Cheesecake Factory just so happens to have a sandwich I love. Everyone should try the spicy crispy chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries - total life changing meal. Anyway, like coming here to grab lunch at the bar. The service is always fast and attentive and it's never crowded around lunchtime."
Betsy W.,"Mansfield, MA",5,6,,5.0,12/17/2015,"Okay so I first experienced the Cheesecake Factory last week. I believe it was a Tuesday evening. About 50 degrees, unusually warm and dry for mid December in Boston. I just gotta get this off my chest-when I hear the words ""Cheesecake Factory"" I imagine a giant warehouse with conveyor belts spitting out cheesecakes. But oh was I in for a surprise! The Cheesecake Factory is not a FACTORY per se, rather a nice dimly lit Arabic-esque restaurant. Let's start with the bread-the brown bread is fantastic. For my entree I got the buffalo blisters, four cheese pasta with shrimp, and a loaded factory burrito. Are all of it in 7.5 minutes. It was so good that I ordered round two of all the entrees. Went to the bathroom, pulled the trigger and threw up course number one to make room for course number two, three, and four. Then I was ready to roll into flavor town. Round 2 was even better than the first! I ended up sleeping there and getting breakfast and cheesecake in the morning. Would recommend the cheesecake not-factory to all!!!"
Amy W.,"Agawam, MA",20,39,14,5.0,6/1/2015,Love the Asian lettuce wraps and fried zucchini. Service great at the bar. Get the skinnylicious sangria.
Etheric D.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,8/13/2015,Disappointed. Pasta was clotted and the salt was uneven. The cheesecake was just ok. Ice cream came with a big chunk of cream on top.
Kerri B.,"Boston, MA",1,27,4,5.0,4/24/2016,"What a delightful late lunch we had, ahi carpaccio, catfish and steak medallions but what really topped it off was the 5  service we received from Matt Yang !"
Shon M.,"Stamford, CT",0,5,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Went here Saturday evening for dessert with a group of friends. Expected the usual great experience that we usually have at the Cheesecake Factory in other locations. Unfortunately, service was terrible. Waited 15 minutes at the table for a server. Had to go up to the maitre d to ask for someone to help. In stead of apologizing, she was rather rude and condescending. Eventually a server turned up. The red velvet cheesecake tasted funky, no quality control at this location. The restaurant is also infested with mosquitoes!  I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but my experience at this location will give me pause while deciding to dine at any of their restaurants."
Jason H.,"Boston, MA",20,6,,5.0,8/23/2015,"We had Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Chicken Pasta at Cheesecake Factory last night. Both of them were pretty good. The waiters were nice and funny, even though they got lot of customers and were supper busy. I believe that I will come back to the restaurant to enjoy the food there again."
Julia L.,"Salem, OR",158,58,19,4.0,5/10/2013,"Normally, I don't write reviews about chains because they're all the same and I assume no one really benefits from it...but this cheesecake factory really deserves props for how they handled our crowd on Wednesday night. A group of 24 of us came to the restaurant (reservation at 6PM, but of course, only 19 of us were there by 6:10PM). Even though on the phone, they had said we couldn't be seated until the entire party was seated, they graciously seated us in the back with two gigantic tables where we could be loud and rowdy like how birthday guests are supposed to be without being completely isolated from the restaurant.  I won't comment too much on food since it's pretty standard - many of us ordered from the skinnylicious menu for the first time, which was a little small portioned, but to be expected. Regular menu items were MASSIVE (definitely two meals worthy if you want to save money/ prevent obesity).  When it came to checks, they separated everyone's bills in an orderly and prompt way, which included 20% gratuity so no one had to embarrass themselves by pulling out the cell phone calculator.  I usually dread large birthday dinners because when money's all pooled together on one check, there's ALWAYS $10 missing somehow. Cheesecake factory made it easy for people to be accountable and service for such a large group was impeccable.  Oh, and they sang the birthday song with us - extra props :D"
Lauren B.,"Boston, MA",204,294,73,5.0,11/27/2013,"In any Cheesecake Factory I've been in, in any state, I have never ONCE had anything except exceptional food and service. I was a waitress as a teenager and young adult so I appreciate good service. I got out of work here today, the day before Thanksgiving, early, and it was pouring rain.  I needed to eat lunch, and since my bus wasn't going to come for another hour (and it was so dreadful out, I really didn't want to walk far), I came in around 11:15 AM and asked for a quiet table. As I was dining alone, they let me sit far away from the few groups that were there.  Dining alone is always awkward and their bar area wasn't open at this time, so I had a booth away from the other guests. I had a Diet Coke no ice, Garlic Noodles, and free bread. (Saying ""free bread"" makes me think of Jim Gaffigan).  The Diet Coke was good, the free bread was good, and the Garlic Noodles were good.  Everything was great, and my waiter was so nice.  He didn't make me feel awkward for eating alone, which surprisingly, some waiters can do!"
Kristin T.,"Mid-Cambridge, MA",0,19,,1.0,10/18/2014,Words cannot describe what hell this place is. Dante has not been able to describe it. We waited over an hour which was not ideal but expected. However the hosts buzzed us to leave our comfy spot at the bar to then line up in the entrance for 20 minutes to wait AGAIN. I imagine this is based on the McDonald's wait time. So that they can say people only wait a mere 60 min before sitting. The children at the hostess stand were not helpful or courteous. So thanks for the absolute worst experience I've ever had eating anywhere.
Mikey D.,"Boston, MA",1,88,,3.0,4/11/2016,"This location is way bigger than I thought it was.  We were seated without a wait when we came, and we walked from the area by the entrance on Belvidere/Huntington under the steps up to the mall which was another section, over to another section along Huntington ave.  Much bigger in there than I realized until we walked through it like that.  I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  I'll paste in the description then talk about it: ""a very spicy mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews. served over rice"".  The start of the description indicates ""very spicy"", there wasn't any spice at all in that dish.  I've had spicier ice cream.  Second, although all that's listed are chicken, green onions, cashews, and rice, I expected more for some reason, maybe some veggies or something, nope only what's listed.  Well, marinated chicken, rice, cashews, and a few green onions just don't do it for me I guess.  The only cashew flavor came from the actual cashews, whatever the chicken was marinated in was pretty bland.  Overall just not a good dish. What saved the day was of course the cheesecake.  We got the 'Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore' cheesecake, and it was pretty tasty.  Ended up taking everything home I couldn't finish, between the main course and the cheesecake I probably have 2 full meals worth of food in my fridge right now from Cheesecake Factory, the portion sizes are pretty big."
KJ W.,"Boston, MA",6,54,6,1.0,12/12/2014,Rude front people who are anything but helpful. You guys gotta train or cut loose these idiots before you really alienate your clientele. Taking my money elsewhere despite being a fan of Cheesecake Factory.
