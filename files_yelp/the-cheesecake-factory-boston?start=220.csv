Iron F.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",42,72,63,4.0,7/21/2014,"Amazing!! Giant slices of the tastiest cheesecake you can dream of. And literally more than a dozen variations on the theme. From adding hot fudge, to adding Oreo cream, or coconuts, and on, and on... The place itself is quite exquisite too. A nice experience."
Matthew H.,"Brookline, MA",26,62,,3.0,11/16/2012,"Let's be honest, this is a chain restaurant.  I'm not expecting it to be the greatest meal on Earth, and they don't even come close.  They do turn out consistent food, and it's not always consistently good.  The staff generally isn't going to bend over backwards or rush for you. Way back when, I used to work in one of these for a couple of months.  The menu is somehow more daunting as a diner than it is as a cook, and that's saying something.  I mean... look at this thing, who designed this menu?  It's like someone actually sat there and asked ""well, what about the people who don't like that"" to every culinary concept that came up and finally the pastry chef just said ""FUCK IT.  Let them have Italian, Chinese, French, American, AND Mexican food, I'm making fucking Cheesecake, bitches!""  I mean, I don't know if that's exactly how it went down, but the only other thing I can think of is that someone ate a bunch of recipes and then barfed them all back onto a menu. Anyway, the cheesecake they make is generally good for what it is, and the rest of the menu is a cluttered mishmash of various ethnic cuisines and standard American fare.  Do NOT take an indecisive eater here or you will be waiting for fucking ever for them to make up their minds, and who can blame them... the menu is like 300 pages."
Lynn J.,"Boston, MA",1414,588,381,3.0,6/4/2013,"famous for more than cheesecake, this popular chain restaurant is a family favorite in any major cities. Food:  their extremely large menu  can be overwhelming at first. I recommend going with friends and sharing their large plates. FAVE DISH:  Lettuce Wraps appetizer...make your own wraps. The deal: the Cheesecake Factory had many dishes  make the top 10 list for most fat and calories...oops!"
Brittany R.,"Berlin, NH",68,1,,5.0,1/17/2015,"Visited your location last night with my boyfriend, first time ever going to the cheesecake factory and I was beyond impressed. I'm very familiar with the restaurant scene I've been server for about 7 years now.  Your location and staff blew my mind.  The atmosphere was amazing and really unique.  Our server Meagan o was really great and knowledgeable about your menu.  Her hurband tim even helped with opening our champagne it was difficult lol but they made it fun. Lots of fun and we really had an awesome experience and the food was amazing. Leftover cheesecake was my breakfast today so to say the least it was amazing.  Thanks so much for everything and your hard work as a company.  Please let Meagan know how great she was thanks :)"
Dave B.,"Boston, MA",1,16,4,2.0,4/12/2014,"Alex the manager says ""we can steal your things if we want"" I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory but the manager here, ALEX, is shady. I accidentally left a birthday card at the table and while the table was being cleared off, the card was stolen. I confronted the staff and they went and got my card but stole the gift card that was inside the envelope. Alex, the manager here, says ""oh well, tough luck pal. We aren't legally responsible for your things."" So I'll leave it up to you whether you want to support a restaurant that condones stealing your belongings. I'll go to the Cheesecake Factory, but avoid this location."
Wes S.,"Everett, MA",119,14,,4.0,1/12/2015,I always find the atmosphere at cheesecake refreshing. I love the lighting and suttle theme of the restaurant. My favorite dish is the shrimp jambalaya. It's a must try!!!
Arielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",385,336,,4.0,8/12/2013,The staff here was so friendly that it totally made the experience for me. Friends and I came in here late at night to have a couple drinks before heading back to our respective hotels. I was amazed at how friendly the staff still was when their shifts were so close to over and they were probably getting anxious to get out of there! A couple friends also ordered cheesecakes. I was in awe with how large each slice was and they were so fancy looking.
Apolinaras S.,"Somerville, MA",21,267,3,3.0,10/29/2012,"Look, it is Cheesecake Factory. Not somewhere I would go to, but my mother-in-law likes it, so I guess I needed to go to keep the peace. Staff is nice, but lines are always long, food comes bit slow, and even ""lite"" selections are not that low-cal."
J R.,"Boston, MA",0,35,,2.0,3/16/2014,"Cheesecake factory almost always serves consistent buttery and delicious food!  On the other random note: On the day that I visited, the young hostess probably for sh*ts and giggles, started placing all the minorities in one section and all the white people in one section. Immaturity?   Definitely ruined the ambiance."
davy f.,"Cambridge, MA",0,26,,1.0,5/12/2014,"The menu says draft Guinness, what you get is a bottle. If you don't know the difference, you deserve what you got. Caveat emptor! The food is reminiscent of airline cuisine in First Class when the airlines tried hard to serve a good meal.  Amazingly good for something prepared 8 hours earlier, packaged, hauled and reheated, but not something you'd voluntarily elect to have over real food. The strawberry shortcake, though, is quite large and quite good."
Christine J.,"Mid-Cambridge, MA",147,392,125,2.0,7/8/2014,cheesecake has gotten half the size and almost double the price. wth?  not worth it anymore.  cost $17 for 2 slices of cheesecake.
Andrew G.,"Millis, MA",12,9,2,4.0,6/8/2012,"Pretty good experience. Great menu selection. I was craving for eggs at 6pm (I know it's a little strange), but they had omelette on the menu all day. They have everything: seafood, pasta, burgers, meat, vegetarian, skinny menu....and yum yum cheesecakes :) Service is pretty good. Space itself is big, lots of sitting area. I liked the atmosphere. Parking a bit of an issue, you might need to park in a garage or walk for 5 min. I would defenitely go back!"
Danielle B.,"Boston, MA",18,10,1,4.0,6/2/2012,"If you have friends or relatives visiting the area, this is a great place to take them for great dessert and cool ambiance. This is NOT a good place to go if you are counting calories or if you want attentive service. The location--right there in the Copley Mall area--is fantastic for tourists and visitors. The orange and green lines have subway stops right there. The interior design is dim with a great view outside, if you get a window seat. The booths are hard and uncomfortable but beautiful to look at. There are intriguing Eye-of-Sauron tribal lights on the sides of the booths... needless to say while waiting (and waiting...) for your food, your eyes will have plenty of decorations to look at. It was my birthday and while they did come out and sing to me and have a cute candle in the cheesecake, I would like to have ordered another drink or had a refill, but the waiter was never around. I realize it's a busy place, but they could have made so much more money if they had been attentive! We wanted more of that delicious bread and more cocktails, but the staff was always elsewhere. So hunt down your server and ask for more bread! It is fantabulous! The food itself was great once we finally got it! I LOVE that they have an entire diet menu, even if it has a silly name ""Skinnylicious."" The gripe I have with this is the entire menu says ""590 calories or less."" If you are health conscious enough to order off the diet menu, why don't they give exact calorie counts??? Not all meals have exactly 590 calories. Budgeting what I eat--what if one salad has 300 and the burger has all 590???? I wish they were more specific. Every single slice of cheesecake will be orgasmically good, just don't even bother calorie counting there. The lowest calorie slice is the Splenda with strawberries cheesecake with a hefty 610. (On my 1000 cal/day diet, this is quite a doozy.) Some of them have over 2,000 calories IN A SINGLE SLICE. Heart stoppingly good. tl;dr version: good food, bad service, high calories, good when you have birthdays or friends visiting Boston"
Gerardo L.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/23/2015,Their menu on Yelp is not updated. The two things I wanted to order were not on their menu when I called. Then the receptionist gave me attitude like it was my fault.
Ellie W.,"Boston, MA",502,555,118,3.0,9/23/2010,"I feel like The Cheesecake Factory is the place you go either when you're craving some really fantastic cheesecake or you can't think of anywhere else to eat. The food is pretty good, so it's a safe bet.  I think a year ago, it was reported that David Beckham was seen here when he was in town. WTH. I should frequent Cheescake Factory's more often. If it's good enough for David ""Emporio Armani underwear model extraordinaire"" Beckham, I think it's good enough for me.  Especially if Beckham decides to hang out at the Cheesecake Factory in his Armani skivvies. I, for one, wouldn't mind."
Nandanie S.,"Quincy, MA",418,523,355,5.0,11/30/2012,"Brunch here is also very good! Portions are super huge, and adequately priced!!"
Tina R.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,1,5.0,10/15/2014,"Chilling at the bar with my girl Maureen having the best Spicy Margarita ever! My girl Abbot behind the bar is the BEST!! Offering great service, menu selections! She rocks!! Cheesecake Factory in Boston upping its game on food and service - luv it!"
C.J. C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,94,,3.0,9/15/2014,"Food is good. Probably their food worths 4-star.  I have eaten here several times over past couple of years, and dishes have been at least OK.  Orange Chicken was not really impressive. I'm a huge fan of Orange Chicken (ordering it at Cheesecake Factory already proves it!) and it was below average orange chicken among the ones I'd tasted, yet was also the most expensive one. However, white cream pasta (forgot exact name), BBQ burger were good.  And Jamaican Shrimp and Chicken (with Curry sauce) was fantastic! I'd recommend this dish to anyone.  However, their service and place maintenance is awful. Perhaps these non-food materials take 1-2 stars off of them. I see some Yelpers giving 1 stars due to their service, and I totally understand them. Floor is so slippery, I felt like somebody spilled oil on the floor or something. Hostesses always underestimate the waiting time. When they say it would be 10 minutes waiting, they call me like 25 minutes later. When they call 20 minutes, I get called after 30+ minutes. Some may have no problem with that business strategy, but I am always irritated by it. When they say 10 minutes, I expect to be seated at least within 15 minutes, not 25+.  I wouldn't say much about waiters. I remember when I visited here with 3 of my college friends, the waiter was really annoying. He was slow, didn't come to take order for like 20 minutes, and didn't refill water. Though, in my recent visit, waitress was so kind, asked for order frequently (yeah we asked for extra minutes to decide what to get like 3 times), and even after placing an order, she came back to us and told us that our dishes are being prepared and would come out in several minutes.  So I guess it just depends on who you get as your server. Overall, my experiences here has been okay. I know I will get good food when I go there, it's all about other factors (price, waiting time, service, maintenance, etc) that changes the dining experience for the night."
Michelle C.,"Mattapan, MA",34,55,72,3.0,4/9/2014,There is always such a long wait here at the Copley Cheesecake Factory. The food was okay and the menu was overwhelming. The cheesecake...well...let's just say I am glad I don't live in walking distance. :)
Bob S.,"San Mateo, CA",3,74,,1.0,7/30/2015,"ive been here three times.  each time the food was mediocre.  the servings are big but not enough to offset the price and mediocrity.  ive had better spaghetti from supermarket can sauce.  don't even bother with the asian food (obviously -- i shouldve known), and the ribs were dry the cheesecake is good though, but you dont have to get a table for that"
