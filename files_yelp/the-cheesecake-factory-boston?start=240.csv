Cheryl C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,36,6,3.0,7/29/2015,Service is wonderful but food is just okay. They are kind to children and the menu is kid-friendly.
Linda G.,"Endeavor, WI",0,2,,2.0,9/22/2015,"Have been to Cheesecake Factory in many other cities, brought a large group of 9. The service was lacking one meal was lost. The food was below the normal standards. The banana cheesecake was served with no bananas, as they were out.  Would not recommend this location for large groups."
Ismail O.,"Istanbul, Turkey",11,41,4,4.0,2/28/2014,We tried 5 different cheesecake and all was great. My favorite is Godiva.
Barrett F.,"Plymouth, MA",16,59,11,3.0,6/16/2014,"As the food at Cheesecake is pretty much always the same, which isn't a bad thing, this review is more focused on the service. We have been to this location many times and always had decent service. I understand their location makes it for a much busier location, however, I find their service poorer than other Cheesecake locations we've been to. Even on a quiet weekday afternoon I find that the service is slow. They make up for it with friendliness, but that only goes so far. With all the fantastic restaurants in the vicinity, only go here if you are craving the huge portions and food you're used to, or if you've never been to Cheesecake Factory. Otherwise, try one of the dozens of non chain restaurants on Boylston Street."
Thomas N.,"Townsend, MA",1,543,,4.0,12/31/2013,"lunch recently, we ate at the bar....everything was very good...drinks were good and less than what seems to be boston's going rate, the fried squash avocado small plate as an app was very good, salmon was excellent, even i liked it, and the burger was very good.....place is very busy and that must say a lot as it is pretty big and nicely decorated...."
Jeff B.,"Darby, PA",0,7,,4.0,9/6/2015,"The portions were large and very flavorful.   The service was very attentive and went above and beyond.    The bathrooms are a bit dirty and were unstocked.  Being in the business for a number of years, I have always thought the cleanliness of the bathroom indicated the cleanliness of the kitchen.   However,  it was the height of the dinner rush."
Jaz M.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",2,17,31,3.0,12/6/2011,"Dear Cheesecake, you are a mix of hit or misses. I always sit at the bar and am recognized as a regular. You are always my back up in case I walk out of some dirty Chinese restaurant. You are close, sometimes full but your food is never disappointing.  Now...service is a different thing. I have been to cheesecake more than 25 times and sat in a table 2 times (both disappointing) when I sit down to eat I would like to not be rushed and processed like a machine. The bar...once I walked up to the bar to overhear the bartenders gossiping about customers and my SO overheard them talking about us specifically (talk about being a regular!) don't complain if the tip we gave you wasn't good enough...maybe you should stop flirting with that guy and actually fill up my glass, bring the ketchup that I've been waiting on for a half hour already and take my dessert order (it's very few times I am able to fit dessert into my stomach from the large plates I order!) and please check your soda fountain I hate getting flat soda and taking that disgusting first sip that lets me know that you're out The lunch menus are great! $5 for sliders, avocado eggrolls (which totally rock btw)...so many options, but such a small stomach...(I guess that's why I keep coming) Red Velvet cheesecake is where it is (the awesome taste that is!) The pumpernickel bread is so delicious, sometimes I get full on only that and have to pack 3/4 of my actual meal!  Final thoughts, I will keep coming here because it has hearty meals, cheap lunch menus and awesome cheesecake! This is not fine dining people, please visit top of the hub for that! This place is for gatherings, cheap lunches, to go orders or just unwinding from the day."
Katy M.,"Boston, MA",71,78,,4.0,7/27/2014,"Aw man, who can go wrong with the Cheescake factory? They have just about everything from American to Italian to Asian to Mexican and more... so chances are you'll find something you like. It is VERY easy to succumb to weakness here and order the comfort food choices. The mac and cheese balls? DELICIOUS but over a thousand calories. The cheesecake, of course, is also delicious but equally as unhealthy. This is a good place for special occasions for obvious reasons."
Julia M.,"Brighton, MA",36,90,19,3.0,7/8/2012,"As far as chain restaurants go, The Cheesecake Factory is decent.  Their 10-page plus menu is a tad overwhelming though & makes choosing an entree rather difficult.  Once you decide on what to order & receive the food, you'll likely find that the food is okay -- not terrible but also not great.   I recommend avoiding the pasta dishes, as they tend to be a letdown.  The tomato basil pasta, for instance, is usually too salty.  If you are looking for really good pasta dishes, head on over to the North End. The two redeeming qualities of The Cheesecake Factory are its cheesecakes & location.  Its cheesecakes (at least the ones I've tried) are good, & the restaurant is conveniently located inside the Pru, just steps from the entrance to the Prudential stop on the green line.  Its convenient location, however, can also be a bit of a drawback -- the place gets very crowded Friday & Saturday nights."
Khalid K.,"Malden, MA",3,31,,1.0,7/23/2015,"I have been here 5 times, and it wasn't exceptional the last 4 times. So, congratulations on your 1 star.  I guess when a place is too big the servers and cooks can't keep up. I don't know who is to be blamed for such a poor experience.  The food doesn't get to your table on time.  I am done with this place.  This place is a big JOKE. peace out."
Chris C.,"South End, Boston, MA",137,119,,3.0,2/24/2012,"Fat G. counting the hours till the end of this workweek. And so, we come to a review of a place that most people have seen before, not necessarily been to. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Copley Mall, near Barnes and Nobles. Come inside, and there's a waiting area as well as a place to order desserts for take-out. There are a lot of tables, a small bar, and seating in the back, which has windows allowing you to see out into the street. Ambiance is tough to describe - it's not candlelight, but it's dim. A friend of mine said that when he hears Cheesecake Factory, he thinks pasta. Aside from cheesecake, I'm not really sure what to get this time. Having remembered being here before for a party, I opted to order a pizza instead of getting one of their pasta dishes (it comes on one of those big plates, but only 1/2 of it is actually food.) They have a wine menu, and a good variety on the menu, ranging from sandwiches, pastas, soups, salads, desserts, pizzas, seafood, etc.  The Everything Pizza had its fair share of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and onions. Though I was a bit disappointed, because the slices felt firm on the top half, but kinda wet and soft on the bottom half. Think a trapezoid of decent pizza, and a small triangle of sadness. The pizza was about $13, which i guess is ok. The waiter looked sad when everyone ordered water, and didn't want dessert... It's an alright place, but not a place I'd frequent regularly. You really come here for the  romantic atmosphere and the cheesecake, but that's really it."
Jonathan N.,"Boston, MA",79,196,445,1.0,12/17/2013,Worst service ever!!!! I will give them no star if there is one. I took my nephew here for lunch. We got a table within minute but no waiter come and get our order. We waited for 45 minutes with a bunch of waiters walked pass our table. They just looked at us and walked away without asking us if we need anything? We then got up and walked out the door. Along the way out I talked to the girl at the front door who handle the seating and told her what happen. She just rolled her eyes and did not say anything. Worst place ever and so unprofessional!!! I will not go here ever again!!
Tanya Y.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",344,200,547,3.0,5/9/2010,"BANG BANG!    ....chicken and shrimp!   So good! The Cheesecake Factory is somewhat over rated to me.  Although their food quality is good, their menu endless, and location superb, the price stops me dead in my tracks from coming back here [I only come back on special occasions].   All of the wait staff that I have encountered have been friendly and seem very knowledgable about their menu, which is a plus.  Bread and butter is always given at the biginning of the meal, which is delicious.   I always order the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which consists of white jasmine rice with shrimp and chicken coconut curry -- it is amazing!  The portion is decent -- I ALWAYS doggy bag about half to leave room for Cheesecake. If I could give 5 stars to solely the Cheesecake component of the restaurant, I would.  They have a variety of different flavor combinations all ranging from about $6-7.  Sooo good!  Theyre extremely rich, however, and one slice is good enough to share amongst 2-3 people. For approximately $20 per visit, I do get full, but am 110% positive that I can find good food much similar to this elsewhere for a cheaper price.  Overall do I recommend this place?  If you're feeling classy and want to indulge after a long day of shopping on Newbury Street, I'm sure coming here will be suitable;  Pinky's Up to you."
Max P.,"Cambridge, MA",0,8,,5.0,7/27/2015,"Great food, great atmosphere. Food is consistent and is always good here. Almost everything on the menu is good. I have been coming here for years, and have always enjoyed it!"
Carl B.,"Chicago, IL",121,9,1,1.0,10/22/2013,Sat and waited for 10 minutes for a someone to approach the table. No one ever came and so I left. Told the hostess. Could have cared less. Avoid this restaurant at all costs.
Emily W.,"Asheville, NC",92,73,6,3.0,7/9/2012,Service was on the slow side. But they were busy. Nice location. Decent food. Delicious cheesecake. I will definitely come back. And p.s. the SkinnyLicious Ceasar Salad was more than I could eat. Good to eat something calorically reasonable and have more than I could want. Oh and bring a jacket. They have AC and they like to use it to the max.
Tony S.,"Boston, MA",222,441,197,4.0,3/8/2009,"Started sucky, but ended like a good Pam Anderson home video.  I usually don't Yelp about major, fan-famous food joints, but my experience here yesterday warranted a review. I went there with 7.5 family members (0.5 for the new pint-sized addition that's all of 8 months old), around 3pm-ish (to escape the horrendous dinner crowd that NEVER seems to go away. Now, I'm a Cheesecake factory regular up and down Southern California, so I'm used to the all-to-infamous crappy-hostess-that-makes-you-wait-because-I'm-too-good-for-you attitude, but yesterday they took it to a new level. There were about 3 hostess' there, and they all acknowledged that I had 7.5 people, and the wait would be about 5-10 minutes. About 30 people piled in after our group, including a party of 8 and party of 6. Within 15 minutes, both groups got seated before me. 35 minutes later (which is my normal Cheesecake factory fook-it--gimme-my-damn-table-now bar), we were still waiting, and I sent in the family informer (my 3 year old daughter) to ask if our table was ready. Nope. Granted, one of the girls came up and ""double-checked"" on my table needs (which we all know is industry lingo for ""oops, we totally fooked up your table order""). At this stage, the family psycho (my sister) took over. Now... here is my issue. I'm from LA. I'm used to waits, unless I'm with my celeb friends. And I'm the pretty laid-back mellow fellow that doesn't get mad at a lot of things that typically drive others nuts. BUT, at least the host/hostess has always been frank about it and managed my expectations. This snooty blondie I-think-I'm-hot-and-have-the-power 4'5"" barbie-wannabe didnt' even have the courtesy to apologize or excuse herself, and simpy said ""well if you have an issue, I""ll get the manager.."".   Dude, this is Boston, not LA. I frickin own you, you $5.50/hour bimbette that actually didn't brush your teeth properly because you had ass-breath underneath that cheap-excuse of an immitation tic-tac you chewed on an hour ago. At this stage, I started to get...... sweaty palms... not a good sign if you're 1/2 Sicilian like me. That's usually the first step before I threaten somebody with ""i know where you live..."" Now... the good thing, the manager, a nice lady named Katrina, came out, very nice, very apologetic (and hey, even if she was acting, she acted well), walked us to our table, and gave us all our appetizer orders on the house. Now... psycho sister took that offer to the max with 5 appies, but for myself, I really liked that she at least had a great attitude. I've been in the food business, hotel business, and rent-a-car business. People mess up all the time by mistake. But have the decency to keep the customer/client happy and manage their expectations. Frickin apologize if you fook up.  I was so ready to slam this place down with my lawsuit forte (18 and counting, and all wins so far), but Katrina saved the day, and gave us a very friendly, very helpful water named Gray (yes, like the color).  I was happy, gave Gray a very generous tip (gave him what the appies would have cost), because I personally don't give a hoot about freebies in an upscale environment. I just want good food and service. The food? LOVED the Bang-Bang Thai chicken, the Thai Lettuce wraps, the crispy spicy beef, and the avocado eggrolls (VERY creative). The fish tacos were a total miss. I'm a fish taco connaisseur, a these were a yuckfest. The kids loved the cheese pizza, and the garlic noodles were decent. Banana cheesecake, and strawberry cheesecake were up to par (great). I left thoroughly satisfied, but mostly because mom said she finally found a restaurant in the Backbay where she adores the food."
Lulu A.,"Catamarca, Argentina",313,125,71,4.0,5/23/2011,"As much as I want to dislike CKF, I can't - they churn out all cuisines of good quality food in short time frames, the wine is solid, and the portions are always huge. The service is generally quick but the servers are usually frantically running about, due to the past pace and turnover of tables.  My meal was the blackened shrimp, I recommend it - fried plantains, mango salsa, brown rice, spicy blackened skrimpsss :) Don't expect fine dining, expect a solid meal and you will be happy... oh and the cheesecake is epic. duh."
Lydia P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,36,1,4.0,9/15/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have a personal project to dine in one in every city I visit, if there is a Cheesecake Factory. What I didn't know was that you can order brunch on Sundays! That was a nice surprise because I love breakfast food, plus it's much cheaper than the entree selections. I ordered the Belgian Waffle, which was HUGE. I was shocked by the portion, and it was so big that I was only ate half of it.  For dessert, I ordered Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. Man oh man, that was rich! Lots of peanut butter, caramel, and crushed candy to give it a nice crunch.  Service was great. My waiter was attentive, but also gave me some space to enjoy my dining experience."
Ian S.,"Boston, MA",110,9,,3.0,5/23/2014,Place is huge and there is always a wait. They dont do reservations either. Huge menu with just about everything you can think of. Id like to see the prices a little cheaper. All in all a good spot.
