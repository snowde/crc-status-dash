Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,3.0,2/8/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is, well, the Cheesecake Factory - decent, overpriced food served in a perpetually noisy atmosphere.   My classmate's birthday gathering last week, however, was fun times =D  Our server did a good job throughout the night and was pleasant to talk to with regards to drink recommendations, etc.  On that note, the Beringer Merlot and Matua Sauvignon Blanc offered here were both quite good =D  I had the Ahi Tuna Tartare and would recommend that if you wanna spend a bit less - reasonably portioned (unlike everything else here lol) and priced. To wrap things up, it's a solid spot for larger parties, but it'd much appreciated if CF would actually take reservations."
Gustavo S.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",3,4,,5.0,6/26/2015,one of the best places to eat. the menu offers a lot of options.  the kobe burger is simply amazing.
Kevin K.,"Woodbridge, VA",12,17,7,5.0,5/25/2013,"I had a great experience, Scott I think is the manager, is by far the best manager I have ever encountered working for a restaurant. He was very informative about the city we visited in our trip. I highly recommend this place to eat. Very dedicated staff."
Alice B.,"Boston, MA",2,12,5,4.0,4/11/2014,"The waiter was nice and polite, we got our food pretty quick & the food was good. We got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer, the factory burger & a normal burger (forgot the name) as entrées. The restaurant is very clean and beautiful, especially the architecture and the painting details. I would definitely go again to eat."
Samuel H.,"Wick, United Kingdom",0,3,,1.0,6/26/2013,"I have had this sub-par excuse for food before on a whistle-stop tour to the West Coast. I wasn't impressed to say the least. I did though decide with some coercion to try it again whilst visiting friends in Boston. Biggest food mistake i made whilst on the East Coast. What a sorry, miserable and frankly bland experience. From the moment i walked in the door greeted with the dour lighting that seems to be customary in every branch. To the instant i tried the first bite of my generic chicken dish. To the point of settling my tab, frozen in horror at the cost of such mediocrity. The Cheesecake factory is from beginning, middle and end a shoddy excuse for a ""restaurant""  If the fact every dish is laden with more calories that your average fast-food joint wasn't bad enough. The flavour does not make up for it. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason. Everything tastes sweet.  You will either love or loathe the cheesecake factory franchise. If you're a fan of rich, coma inducing food with portions the size small children then this is the place for you.  However if you actually have taste-buds and appreciate good food. Whilst at the same time not wanting to burn a whole in your wallet for the sake of calorie smothered food that you could get at any sub-par dingy diner. Then stay clear. A million miles clear."
Julie B.,"Boston, MA",274,416,705,3.0,4/10/2011,"Standard cheesecake factory attached to a mall. The servers are nice (and cute!) and the food is generally pretty decent. They are pretty generous with the bread here so try not to fill up before you even place your order. It happens to the best of us. My grilled cheese this afternoon was bomb but I thought my friends were gonna have to roll me down Huntington Avenue after eating it all. Beware of gigantic portions. Also, do not come here on a weekend night. Just don't. Nothing is worth waiting 3 hours for! Not even Reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  Well maybe..."
Will F.,"New Haven, CT",0,30,3,3.0,4/19/2014,"Standard Cheesecake Factory. I typically order the grilled coulotte steak and did so this time. It was slightly overcooked, but the meal was generally good.  The service was not great, however. We waited for nearly two hours and eventually were shown to our seats, only to see a table with lettuce and ketchup still on it. They called the busboy over and he quickly bussed the table... by sweeping the trash onto the floor."
Hina K.,"Peabody, MA",24,11,2,4.0,1/23/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory because I think the interior is great, their service has been awesome on the two times that I have been there and best of all amazing food with gigantic proportions :) I highly recommend if you haven't tried it yet! Its always busy so dont mind if you have to wait a bit because its worth it!"
Sara M.,"Boston, MA",171,704,12,3.0,11/6/2009,"I'm not much of a chain restaurant fan, but I liked coming here to sit at the bar...you  don't have to wait an hour and a half, and the servers are entertaining I had a piece of tiramasu cheesecake and a cappucino = bliss Come here for dessert and cocktails, skip the wait and titanic-sized dinners"
Delroy H.,"Boston, MA",55,169,19,5.0,7/18/2013,Great place! The staff was very helpful. I find the atmosphere to me pleasant and the food is very good. I'm addicted to cheesecake.
Emily D.,"Boston, MA",27,21,5,2.0,9/8/2013,"The food here is alright, but most of the time I've went with my friends, there have been complaints about dirty surroundings, and microwaved food.  The decorations are nice, though!"
Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1405,702,282,3.0,9/27/2013,"There are some places that I just don't go on my own choosing. However, when I'm with someone fun and they choose one of those locations, I often go along with the plan just because it makes them happy. The Cheesecake Factory may be one of the best examples of this. Let's face it...WOMEN LOVE THIS PLACE. I don't know why, but they do. So when I came into Boston for an evening and my female friend was ""really hungry,"" she chose to go here because it was also a short walk from her place. This may be the largest Cheesecake Factory I have ever visited and there are certainly enough employees running around to cover all the tables. My friend knew exactly what she wanted from past experiences and our drinks and food came out accurately and at a very good pace. She was very happy when we left...so that alone means it was a good experience and it was also a good place for us to catch up as the noise level overall was very average to low in the restaurant. For the record, those Fried Chicken Sliders sure taste a lot like Chick-Fil-A to me...and I'm not complaining at all."
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1882,1401,2.0,9/25/2009,"I do like cheesecake factory most of the time but not this place particularly... It is always so damn crowded!!  One reason is because everything close so early in Boston and this place is one of the few places open late.  Expect to wait over an hour when it is busy.   My friends and I had to come here two nights in a row because we are not from the area and it is so hard to find a place to eat late at night.      I found the food here was not as good as other cheesecake factory locations.  I ordered Jambalaya pasta and it was not tasty at all.  However my friends seemed to enjoy their food so maybe it was just my dish.  They had Miso salmon and Hibachi steak and Spicy Chicken pasta.   If I knew the area better, I probably would not have gone to this place 3 times."
Joanne G.,"Stoneham, MA",82,390,182,3.0,11/10/2011,"Cheesecake.   Basically that is all we had there, and it had to be Take Out because it was stupid crowded. Good Cheesecake, nothing more, nothing less. There is one closer to my house that I would go to, so the chances of me returning to this particular location is very slim."
A C.,"Boston, MA",46,120,2,2.0,1/15/2011,"There's not much point in reviewing The Cheesecake Factory.  It is what it is.  In fact, I've become a big fan of the Green Chile hamburger ($10).  Having eaten the SDLT burger @ Sel de la Terre, and a burger @ Cognac Bistro, I have to say, I think I prefer this burger. Unfortunately, someone in our party had a piece of uncooked chicken in his pasta dish.  Not partially cooked, not a little pink, just flat out raw.  Yikes.  The manager handled it appropriately - not charging the entree, and free deserts for the table.  Now,  does that make up for possible E Coli poisoning?  Well, my friend isn't vomiting or crapping her brains out yet, so perhaps. But I'm pretty disturbed by this mistake.  Overcooking a steak, or overseasoning a salad, are culinary mistakes.  To send out uncooked and raw chicken with the dish is just horrific, and it makes you seriously wonder what kind of quality control they have. I don't know if I can say I can confidently go back to this franchise - and just want yall to be aware as well."
Robert F.,"Astoria, NY",106,66,19,1.0,7/5/2011,"I was incredibly disappointed by the food.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken over brown rice & it was HORRENDOUS.    The rice was clumpy & SMOTHERED in teriyaki sauce (there was more sauce on the rice than there was on the chicken).  The chicken was also crappy - it was an odd cut of chicken (which I think was the breast, but not really sure) and the wings were still attached. I've had the pasta here in the past & that was OK.  the cheesecake was good (it is the cheesecake factory, after all).   Bottom line - it's a touristy restaurant & located in a very touristy part of Boston (at the bottom of the Prudential building).  There other (and cheaper) places to go."
Amy H.,"Brighton, MA",0,1,,3.0,10/18/2014,"My husband and I took our 7 month old daughter here today for the first time. We had been before she was born, and always enjoy the food. But now I have a baby there are other things that are important to me in a restaurant too! Our server was great and offered us a high chair and free bananas for my daughter, which was a nice touch. However, when I needed to change her diaper before we left the restaurant I asked another server where the changing facilities were and what type of facilities they had, he said ""I don't know, I've never been in the ladies room before"". Erm... Not exactly helpful! I wasn't expecting him to have been in there, I just assumed working there he might know something about the facilities?! When I got in the restroom there was just a marble surface in a dark area of the room to change your baby... This was obviously not designed by someone who has children! Needless to say, my daughter was wriggling about and bumping her head on the hard surface (even with the changing pad from the diaper bag) and crying because it was so uncomfortable and cold and dark. I had to abandon my plan to change her there and rush outside, calm her down and change her on the grass! Luckily we had already finished our meal and also that the weather was good today, otherwise it would have been really stressful. Great food, good place to bring kids but they REALLY need to improve the changing facilities."
Michelle S.,"Waltham, MA",136,75,2,4.0,11/16/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I've been twice recently and am really happy with their calorie conscious menu.  They have a good variety of meals that are under 500 (or 600?) calories.  The margherita flatbread pizza is awesome.  The bread they bring out while you're waiting is also awesome.  The cheesecake though....WICKED AWESOME!  It's sooooo incredibly difficult for me to resist getting a slice when I go there. Anyways, this particular location is ginormous.  I've only gone for lunch there and we get seated right away.  The service is good.  Nothing particularly special there.  Relaxing atmosphere and easy to have a conversation (noise-level-wise).   It's my first choice for a sit-down lunch at the Pru."
Marie P.,"San Francisco, CA",53,714,32,5.0,7/31/2011,We have a Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco so i knew what to expect from the food. Atmospherewise its real spacious and beautiful! Less crowded than I'm used to. Server was great and food was also.
Shaina S.,"Medford, MA",117,313,46,3.0,7/31/2008,"Okay, the skeezballs that work here really creep me out. Like, one guy actually sat at our table to talk with us, which could be friendly, but then when he gives you his myspace page, turns into like, a breach of company policy or something.  (Funny at the time, creepy upon reflection.) Last time we got a used car salesman with a cheesy smile, who just so happened think that every dish we ordered was his absolute favorite on the enormous menu. The woman who sat us (a server) did what the hostesses couldn't seem to (sat us) and was genuinely friendly.  She actually took the time to learn how to pronounce my name correctly.  Nice!  Also, Michael is a hilarious waiter full of jokes and speils and ways to con you into eating more cheesecake.  I still think the Crusted Chicken Romano is the sh*t and last time I got it, it fed me gourmet leftovers at work for two days! Adam's PB Fudge Ripple Cheesecake also rocks my world, even though I could've sworn it was brown when I got it in the dimmer lights of the Burlington CF.  Anyways, CF is good fun and all, but watch out for those male waiters.  They might give you the heebee jeebies, or if you let them get too close, something even worse!"
