Jackie C.,"Chicago, IL",144,543,107,4.0,6/21/2013,"So this review was hard for me write. I love the Cheesecake Factory and have for years. Friends, family and I have flocked here for the drinks, food and of course cheesecake. However, we had a server who could have cared less for us.  We waited for ages (guess about 10 minutes)  before we had any service. We finally flagged someone down to take our order. We ordered water, our appetizer and our meal. 5 minutes after that we finally had our actual server come by who was noticeably annoyed that we flagged someone down to get service. So for the rest of our time there we were treated with less than stellar quality that is so typical of the cheesecake factory. My husband wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt of having a bad day but personally when he has a bad day at the office he is still required to perform his job. Why was she any different? We will of course return to Cheesecake Factory hoping for a better visit."
Jenny B.,"Allston, MA",0,15,,2.0,2/19/2015,"I am usually a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but this location really disappointed me. I had a southwest chicken sandwich and ate half of it until realizing that it was raw. I showed it to my waitress, who reacted really insensitively to the situation.  The manager reacted appropriately, giving his card and not making me pay for the dinner, but I left very disappointed and a bit scarred.  I would eat at many other places ahead of this place in downtown area."
Andi K.,"Somerville, MA",0,25,,3.0,2/18/2015,"We split a couple of appetizers and I got a lunch-size pasta plate. We split a slice of red velvet cheesecake for dessert. The food was well prepared and plated, if pretty standardized. I was satisfied with portions and prices. The staff were very enthusiastic and friendly, but not necessarily the most helpful and attentive. I'd eat here again."
Dawn E.,"Marlborough, MA",657,1055,1536,3.0,6/5/2008,"I used to work  here.   I read a review which says the food isn't made on site, and that's not true... even the salad dressings are made to order and there are no microwaves anywhere in the building. Except the Cheesecake.  The cheesecake is frozen and comes from California.  It's still delicious, but it's been frozen. The food is good, there's a TON of variety, and you get your  money's worth.  So why three stars?  I used to work here and this is the first restaurant I ever quit because of office politics.  Plus, chain restaurants... eh... But in a pinch, I'd eat at Cheesecake anytime and many of my friends would give it five stars. Also, for a restaurant... it's open REALLY late.   AND.. one of our fellow Yelpers still does work there.. I won't tell you which one if you don't know."
CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,4.0,3/2/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is an AWESOME CHAIN! Does this location live up to its name? It sure does! With a few things to fix but nothing that will turn me off! :) We wanted some food after visiting Copley mall. So we thought why not Cheesecake Factory? You cant ever go wrong with them! (Most of the time anyways.) So it was 9:00 and we went down. Only to find out it was a 45 minutes wait. Then again for being on a Saturday night that's fine! So we got our name on the list and we waited....and waited....and waited...For about an hour or so. Still not to bad. The only thing we saw that we did not like was they had sat some parties that came in after us before us...We only had 2 of us. Not sure why this happen. So that was kinda annoying. (Minus one) After being sat our server came over right away! Let me tell you that we was thirsty! So this is a huge plus. We ordered a few sodas! The server was pretty nice and told us all of the specials at this time as well. He had our sodas out pretty quickly! Upon his return we then ordered our app and 2 meals.  For our app we got a side salad to share! It was awesome! The lettuce was very good. Romaine lettuce and spinach leaves with tomatoes and cucumbers! The house dressing was JUST AMAZING! I love their salads for that alone! Plus it was huge! So its really good for 2 people easy! huge thumbs up! Even for a side this would have been amazing. For a meal I got the four cheese pasta with chicken. All I can say is YUMMY! This is a MUST try for anyone who loves cheese! It blended SO well together. My taste buds want more just writing this review! Its that bad ass! We also ordered the orange chicken meal. It came with 12 PEACES OF CHICKEN! Fried with batter to perfection! Its a basic meal but they do it so well! VERY yummy! If you like orange chicken than you will love it! The only issue that we had here again was...SLOW! Took a good hour or so to get our meals. If you couldn't tell it was still well worth the wait! During our meal our server made sure our drinks where full. He did however take a little bit to come back to check on how the food was. I think he must have been pretty busy. So after dinner we ordered a tiramisu to go! Again it was slow getting it! We waited a good 20 minutes for them to get this ready for us. After paying for everything. So it was a hold up. By the time we got it home and walked off some of our food we had this for dessert! Yummy it was! Again it was worth the wait! So for everything we got we ended up with a bill of $65.00. That included a good tip. We knew the server was busy. Everything came out perfect! If they had done a little better on time this is and EASY 5/5! So I'm only taking one star away for the time and skipping over us while seating others. VERY STRONG 4/5! Oh we will be going back! The time is such a minor thing when your hungry! Because their food is just that good! Its worth the wait!
Jenn H.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,262,202,3.0,6/10/2011,"Look, it's a cheesecake factory.  Whaddya want?!  It's like any other cheesecake factory.  I went with a bunch of friends, had altogether too much spinach dip, and had a super heavy pasta (that I really only ate a third of).  Sadly no cheesecake this time (I stuffed myself!)...but that's usually the best part. Anyways, it's a safe bet, huge portions, heavy food, lots of options...and it's solid.  Not mind-blowing, but not a bad option."
Nora B.,"Plainville, MA",98,445,18,3.0,4/21/2009,"Basic, boring, good. Cheesecake isn't my favorite place (it's a chain, crowded, etc) but it's good for those large crowds of hard to please people. If we have to go to out to dinner for a friends birthday, this place is great to find something everyone likes.  The food isn't that healthy or superb but most things are filling and relatively good. However, their cheesecake is amazing filled with tons of crazy fattening options (yummy chocolate peanut butter cookie dough anyone?).  It's not that crowded on weeknights, during snow storms, or during the day. Any week night or lunch time will be so crowded with tourists."
Kimberly H.,"Boston, MA",97,152,31,3.0,12/5/2012,"The portions are RIDICULOUS and the menu gives me vertigo. When I eat off the regular menu I feel like I need to spend the next 24 hours at the gym ... BUT their seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake is amazing and, in my heart, I believe it is zero calories."
Johanna S.,"Boston, MA",0,38,,2.0,1/10/2013,"I had the Hamburger and really liked the baked, slightly crusty bun. The salad which came with it had too little dressing. Unfortunately the appetizer arrived after the entree (???), what made me sad because it was the second time I tried to try the avocado eggrolls and I failed. At least they took it back to the kitchen and off the bill.  The cheescake was dry on the top as if it wasn't from that day what also disappointed us, compared to what I experienced at my last visit to CF in the Burlington mall.  I think also the tables are set too close together (our winter coats and the ones of our neighbours nearly didn't have place at the small bench between us and we didn't see any hooks). Overall I still like Cheescake Factory, but other branches, I probably won't come back to this one."
Richie D.,"Everett, MA",32,28,,3.0,11/17/2011,"Pro's: Waiter Jeff was awesome! Very Very fast and friendly. My Burger was awesome *farmhouse burger*, My Boyfriends burger was great too!  Con's: You have to wait to get a buzzer... than wait for the buzzer to go off... then wait to be seated... it was like a big waiting game! On a rainy night on Thursday.... there shouldn't be a 30 minute wait! Oh and the Miranda Hobbs look alike manager should have told the hostess to use ALL the tables and don't seat 2 of us at a 4 persons table! wouldn't that table be good for the party of 3 or party of 4 behind us?!  Only reason I'm complaining on the wait was because there were empty tables we walked by..."
Michael R.,"Boston, MA",43,236,7,3.0,4/8/2011,"Now don't get me wrong, CF's cheesecake is phenomenally good (especially the Snickers Cheesecake!), but everything else their overpriced menu is just okay.  I've been here several times and have tried a number of different sandwiches and pastas, and although they were certainly good, there was nothing special about them, and I can recall even getting served a cold dish of Three Cheese Pasta before.  It's pretty unlikely that you'll have a bad meal at this establishment, as everything's decent at its worst, but there's nothing truly special behind the glitz and glam of the well-spoken Cheesecake Factory."
Nicole V.,"New York, NY",117,214,79,4.0,4/26/2010,"Oh Cheesecake factory... to be plain and simple- I love you. The food is delicious no matter what you're ordering. It's my sister's favorite restaurant (according to her it's her favorite in the world, but she's 11 so she gets cut some slack) so we go every time the fam visits.  I also find myself going in between and as a result, have quite a few suggestions: 1. splitting an appetizer and an entree tends to be more friendly on those of us who want cheesecake 2. the drinks are ALWAYS delicious 3. unless you're some kind of super human, be careful when you order the burgers.  they're super delicious but you will be stomach-aching full after 4. their other desserts are amazingly delicious too! 5. wasabi encrusted tuna = best thing on the menu (okay... that one is an opinion) 6. GO TO BRUNCH. the lemon ricotta pancakes would be worth sacrificing a limb for while the breakfast burrito is big enough to attach to your body and replace previously mentioned lost limb. ...I'm going back some Sunday soon just to get them and post pictures."
Sheila K.,"Jersey City, NJ",406,57,64,1.0,5/25/2011,"Eek! Methinks not, for sure. I went with a friend. The entrance was overly crowded with people just standing around waiting for the buzzer thingies to buzz. After standing for five minutes in the crowd, I realized I should probably just push my way to the desk, which I did. The hosts and hostesses were scrambling around in and out of the desk and when I asked for a table for two, one of them handed me a buzzer, took my name, and told me the wait would be at most 30 minutes. Okay. My friend wanted to try Cheesecake Factory and it was lunch time, so I wasn't too bothered by the wait time. So we waited. After 30 minutes the buzzer had not buzzed. We kept saying that it would probably beep any minute now and ended up waiting over an hour before we confronted them. Of course, we were a little dumb for waiting so long to do so. The hostess apologized and told us it would be another ten minutes. Thank goodness it ended up only being a short minute. We were seated and ready to order. Unfortunately it took quite a while for our waiter to arrive. I asked for recommendations, which I usually do as I enjoy hearing their opinions. With his opinion I ordered the fish tacos with fried fish and a cup of the soup of the day, some sort of corn chowder. My friend ordered the miso salmon. The waiter came out with a  bowl, not a cup, of the soup. I really wasn't in the mood to point it out so I ended up paying for the bowl. The soup was pretty good. The fish tacos were not. The tacos were bland and I actually only ate one, gave one to my friend and left the plate half full. I didn't really want to take it back with me. My friend's miso salmon was really good at first. But then it started getting too heavy. I think they need to add more vegetables to the dish; it's basically salmon on top of rice with five snap peas. it was my friend's birthday so on the way to the restroom, I let my waiter know. We got a complimentary cheesecake and that was the highlight of the meal. The cheesecake, of course, was delicious. With the extremely long wait, bland food, and expensive bill, I was thoroughly disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory. The waitstaff were not particularly attentive and it seemed too disorganized. I don't think I will be returning."
Jean S.,"Enoch, UT",0,2,,1.0,11/22/2014,"Stupid restaurant, put us in line for 45 mins and Just skipped us for no reason. And kept us waiting for another 40 minutes!  Have to yell at them to get served! Never go gain!"
Aaron H.,"Corona, CA",101,29,4,2.0,7/4/2013,"Lousy service.  Waited on hold on the phone forever just to place a take-out order to take back to my hotel.  The hostess wasn't prepared when she finally did pick up the phone.  Then, the entree I wanted was ""not available"".  Once I picked up the order, the hostess wasn't sure that our salads were prepared correctly; some confusion ensued.  The food turned out fine - of the quality expected at Cheesecake Factory - but this location really has some customer service work to do.  This should have easily been a 4-star review."
Vera L.,"Lynn, MA",62,15,1,3.0,12/10/2013,"Hit or miss. I went one week and ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was absolutely amazing. So I decided to go back with some family that was visiting and was very regretful that I did so. I ordered the chicken teriyaki again, but this time it came as one huge slab of chicken instead of cut into strips, and was very dry and lacking flavor, but the most disappointing thing was the rock hard rice, it was visually undercooked, I'm not sure how something so obvious and simple slipped through multiple employee's hands. Server forgot our appetizer, and when I asked if there was a house drink he could suggest he looked very confused. We tried to ask recommendations for food and he had nothing to suggest, strange for an upscale restaurant."
Anthony C.,"Boston, MA",0,14,,1.0,3/28/2012,"I come to this location quiet often and I'm always pleased with the food and service.  However, this past Sunday we had a terrible experience.  The waiter was very personable and checked in with us often but I just don't think he listened to anything we said.  I have a very serious food allergy and told him what I was allergic to and if he could check with the chef to make sure everything was okay.  (A few restaurants in Boston are really good with allergies and have a manager or even chef come over to go over what your having and ensure that everything is safe).  We placed our order, we got Buffalo Blasts for our appetizer and it was really good.  For our Main course, my gf got a Teriyaki entrée and I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I'm allergic to sesame seeds and when our food came my burger had a sesame seed bun..  People make mistakes, I get it.. the slip might not have said it or maybe they forgot, but you think the waiter would have noticed..  Anyway, I let him know how serious the allergy was an if I could get another one without the sesame roll.  He took it away and about 10 minutes later a manager came over and apologized.  The burger came back over, it was lettuce and a slab of meat and cheese on the plate.. Where are my fries, my bacon and my bun.  Are you telling me you don't have plain rolls?  He forgot and brought over a plain  roll and said 'oh the fries, yea they umm contain your allergy'.. I've ate here a million times, no they don't.. They need to take allergy's at the Cheesecake factory much more serious. When we got the bill they didn't comp the burger, they did add it twice and then take one away, which I thought was kind of messed up..  When we got home we noticed that our takeout back was covered in teriyaki sauce because they didn't fasten the lid.  Just an overall bad experience.  Basically we paid $60 bucks for an Amstel light and a tea. I'm not one to jump on to Yelp just to write a bad article, but it's been bothering me that I didn't complain and still left a decent tip."
Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,4.0,4/19/2011,"Decadence never tasted so good! This wasn't the first Cheesecake Factory that we have been to and I usually try to avoid chain restaurants unless I get out-voted,LOL. However, the Cheesecake Factory is now one of the places we actively seek out when we need to satisfy our sweet tooth. This particular CF is located in a really nice mall near the Prudential Center in Boston. We went on a weeknight around 7pm and it was as crowded as you would expect on a weekend. I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the wife had the Tiramisu Cheesecake, both were equally delicious. You get very generous portions for the price and I can tell by taste of their cheesecake that they use high-quality ingredients.  The only advice I would give about going here is don't order the cheesecake for desert if you have already eaten here or somewhere else because they give you so much that the cheesecake is a meal in itself,LOL. Also, if you are sensitive to sugar, they have a cheesecake here that is sweetened with Splenda, which I think I may try since eating their cheesecake more than once or twice a month might give me diabetes,LOL. The staff here was very friendly and the service was quick although I would watch your order to make sure they got it right since they are so busy, the person in front of us had some order problems and you could tell it was because the staff are so busy."
Kim K.,"Somerville, MA",335,1782,5989,5.0,3/8/2009,"Yeah, you wait an hour or more sometimes to eat here (especially on a weekend) and it's always crowded but dudes, c'mon, the Cheesecake Factory is excellent. Their food is top notch, always fresh, their staff is accommodating and unrelentingly nice, and the prices are good.  We went here last night just for cheesecake and waited 50 minutes. Maybe we're nuts but I say it's worth it. $20 for two slices, two hot teas, awesome service, and a really nice end to the night."
Claudia P.,"Boston, MA",27,246,4,5.0,9/7/2013,Food is always awesome. Chicken and biscuits are delicious. Also love the sheppards pie-everything is good ! The manager was really cool last night-I had a slight problem that was solved really well.
