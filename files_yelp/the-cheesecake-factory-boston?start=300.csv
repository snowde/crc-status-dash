Andrew G.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",0,26,1,4.0,7/27/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite ""Go-To"" Places of all time. I've been to them in NJ, MA, VA, MD, and a few other states I'm sure. I have one simple rule when I go to Cheescake Factory (no, its not try to eat an entire cheesecake by myself) its that I will never try something on the menu twice. Just won't do it. There has to be over 200 menu items everyday, so I think its an injustice to limit myself to the same thing. I have never had a dish that I have not liked here The last time I came was for dinner on a Saturday night in March maybe. We were seated within 10 minutes which was a surprise. Its inside the Prudential Center, so there's plenty to do while you wait anwyay, but definitely come early because this place gets PACKED! We started out with chips and guacamole. Now, I am not a guacamole ""snob"" whatsoever (I probably couldn't even tell you the difference between really good and really average guacamole to be honest), but I thought this stuff was pretty good. They came to the table and mashed it up right in front of you and gave us plenty of chips. You can get mild, medium, or spicy, but we opted for mild and I thought it was great. Pretty sure that was less than $10 too which is great.  Today I ordered Stuffed chicken Tortillas and they did not disappoint. As usual the plate was HUGE! Tortillas were fresh and bursting at the seams with chicken, cheese, peppers, onion, and cilantro. It was served with black beans and a sweet corn cake that was awesome! I'm not too familiar with Spanish/Mexican cooking but that corn cake was just so good- a perfect complement to the spiciness of the salsa. Honestly, do not even remember what my friend got because I was so engulfed in my food. In the past I've had Huevos Rancheros for brunch which was delicious (and huge..actually I'm going to stop saying meals are huge because I am pretty sure its implied at this point. You do NOT go to this place on a diet).  I've had Jambalaya Pasta with seafood where the sauce was perfectly made and you could really taste the layering of flavors. I've had the little pizzettes with sausage and ricotta as a ""small plate"" that were awesome. Corn tamales are delicious.  One day after purging myself with fast food, I even ordered a salad at this place (Me...a salad?). To this day, the Factory Chopped Salad is one of my favorite salads ever. Its actually listed as an appaetizer but I couldn't even finish it. Lettuce, avocado, bacon, apples...everything you could want in a salad and more. Do I even need to describe the cheesecake? Heavenly. My favorites so far have been Red Velvet, Oreo Crumble, and Dutch Apple. The truly unfair part is by the time I'm always done eating my dinner, I barely have room to split a slice with somebody! And I'm not talking ""I think I ate too much I better stop here"" full...I'm talking ""I cannot physically open my mouth anymore because there is so much food inside me"" full.  Cheesecake Factory is just good. They serve meals from all kinds of backgrounds in huge portions. Is the most authentic food you'll ever eat? Definitely not. Is it absolutelt delicious food that will keep you coming back when you get the craving? Uh-huh. Oh yea no doubt about it."
Adam Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",275,229,48,3.0,1/7/2009,"I'll keep this review simple. Huge portions (One dinner dish can serve 2-4 people). A tad pricey. Food can be poor or fantastic, it greatly depends on what you order. Desert is great. I like to go to the cheesecake factory when I have a group of 5 or more friends due to the huge portions."
Matthew P.,"San Diego, CA",93,182,56,5.0,3/24/2011,"I've never come out of the Cheesecake Factory with a bad experience. I hate giving a chain 5 stars but gosh, it's just so good. You have so many options it's overwhelming. Whether you want pasta or fish or sushi or just ""small bites"" they have it all. Not to mention that their cheesecake is out of this world. Is there any place that has better cheesecake, seriously? I've recently rediscovered this place for it's Happy Hour ""Bar Menu"". They have a TON of options to choose from and they are all 5 bucks!! Not only do you have a lot of options but the food is REALLY good and there is a LOT of it. Win win in my book! The cocktails are a little on the expensive side though. So if you are looking for a cheap night I would recommend just eating here and drinking elsewhere. But the drinks are good so I'd have to recommend at least getting one. Expect to wait for quite a while if you are going at night. That even goes for Monday. Everyone and their mom seems to want to go here. Friday/Saturday night? Forget it unless you get there early. But it makes sense because they are oh so delicioso!"
Jessica H.,"Hyde Park, MA",313,300,1194,3.0,1/28/2010,"We went there last night for dinner before catching a play at the Huntington Theatre. The wait wasn't too bad - our friend got there before us but they wouldn't seat her until we arrived. So we put our names in right away and I think the wait was only about 5-10 minutes. This place is huge and so popular even for a Wednesday night!  We ordered drinks - I got the pomegranate mojito, very very good! It's a little cheaper then a regular mojito too (maybe less alcohol since the pomegranate takes up room?) I def recommend that drink. Not many people can make a good mojito but they did a great job.  For such a huge menu The Cheesecake is unfortunately a big disappointment for any vegan. Luckily I had been there this summer with my dad in Virginia so I was already acquainted with the menu, Otherwise I would have been lost. Unfortunately most things contain eggs, butter, fish sauce, beef broth, cheese, etc. Supposedly all their pastas and breads contain egg so beware.  However I ordered the same thing I got this past summer and that was the Thai lettuce wrap. You can easily replace the chicken with portobello strips, asparagus, or avocado. They are very willing to do this and don't charge you that extra ""replacement"" tax that a lot of other places do. The wraps are delish - you get 3 different sauces and lots of good toppings to put in them. So the dish was great, exactly what I remembered.  I just wish they would have more vegan options - esp with some veg protein dishes (vegetarian beans, tofu, nuts, etc.)   My meal was great but I was definitely hungry a few hours later! The service was pretty good, the waiter was a little slow at times and we had to flag him down, but otherwise very friendly and a great atmosphere. We had plenty of time to chat, eat, and still make it to our play early."

Banana M.,"Seattle, WA",3,118,81,5.0,3/2/2011,"This was the first Cheesecake Factory I have been to and I have to say, this place is amazing!  The wait was long, but it was totally worth it!  We got the pasta dish and the recommended fish dishes.  The food was great!  When dessert came, we got 3 different flavours of cheesecake and it was so amazing. Best place for cheesecake ever!  Highly recommended!"
Chen X.,"Quincy, MA",8,13,,4.0,6/18/2011,"I really enjoy the Cheesecake factory because the portions are so well worth the money. I do not order pastas and what not anymore because even though the sizes are huge, the taste is decent but not superb. I come here for the burgers, especially the Tons of Fun burger, too bad they took that out the money, for reasons I do not know why. Other than that, the other burgers are nice, the meat is always cooked just right (Medium-Rare) and the fries are good. I remember always leaving happy with the amount of food that I've ate.  The service is always good, the waiters are attentive and very friendly with you. The atmosphere are good as well, comfy chairs and dim lighting makes this place a good place to just unwind. Though moderate in pricing, I would come back from time to time for its large portions and satisfying memories."
Romney D.,"Stamford, CT",123,146,49,4.0,1/25/2011,"I hate coming to the Cheesecake Factory because I never know what I want to eat and then I end up just getting a burger and it's just ok. I met my sister here for lunch and the host brought us to a booth that I could clearly not even get in lol. I'm 9 months pregnant...there was no way in hell. So when I told him I can't sit there he's like ""Are you serious?!"" I just gave him a look like, are you an idiot?! Lol smh.   Anyways he found us a table to sit at and our waiter was super nice. He had a great sense of humor and was very attentive. My sister ordered some fancy salad and a mango raspberry smoothie that looked so amazing. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and it was amazing. The best thing I've had in a long time. I want to go back just to have that again. The chicken was very moist and the fried outer layer was perfect!  I really wanted to check out the red velvet cheesecake but I was too full :( maybe next time!"
Khan A.,"Newton, MA",62,104,333,3.0,2/22/2011,"There's not a lot of special in this restourant. I don't understand why people crazy about it? I love seafood! and i decided to try salmon. That was a bad decition. First itr took them like 45 min to make it. I was exiting. and what i get? dry, very salted salmon. And that what i was waiting for so long?  But my friend order Jamaican Black Peper Shrimp and that was good! really! now if i'm going there this is the only food i'm ordering. it's really tasty! i try to do it by myself at home and i never got that taste. and i love their warm homemade bread! i can't stop myself from eating it. it's just sooo good. this restourant is not awesome but still have some pluses!"
Barbara S.,"San Diego, CA",76,20,2,4.0,6/20/2012,I just came here for dessert and ordered the pineapple upside down cheesecake and it was DELICIOUS!!! It is a little overpriced but well worth it!
Mona W.,"Boston, MA",0,90,,2.0,4/28/2011,"I used to love the Cheescake Factory, but things have changed...the last time was especially bad.  The wait was annoying. We were told 30 minutes, and it was 50 minutes. After being called up, we had to wait against the wall for another 5-10 minutes.  We were starving but the bread, ""was still in the oven"", and we didn't get it until after we had already gotten our meals.  The waiter brought out the wrong meal for one of my friends. He took it away but did not return for 20-25 minutes. When he did return, he attempted to place down the dish, which tipped over, resulting in sauce all over the table.  As I walked home, I had a horrible stomach ache. I'm really sad, because Cheesecake Factory used to be a favorite!"
Alistair H.,"Victoria, Canada",2,31,2,4.0,7/26/2011,"I wish i could write a review for the food separate from the cheesecake.  3 star food, 5 star cheesecake. Long wait on a late Thursday night for a large group. Make a reservation, this place gets hoppin'. The food was nothing to write home about, you get a little less than what you pay for. The real draw to this place is the cheesecake. If you do choose to go here for dinner, save ample room for the cheesecake. Huge selection and very rich."
Jessica W.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,9/29/2013,"Worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurants. During the entire dinner time, she served with her b**** face. Seriously, some one died in you family?"
Charmie C.,"Boston, MA",40,265,105,2.0,2/8/2013,"The best part of the experience was the quick seating. The one in Braintree is notorious for 40 minute waits. We were seated after about 10 minutes. Our waiter seemed in a hurry, though and was rushing us to order. I didn't like this. I ordered from the lunch menu, a pasta dish. He basically trashed one of the pasta choices I was going to selected, and pushily suggested I not go for it. Generally just seemed unhappy and was projecting that onto us. We ate, enjoyed the bread, and were out. Good thing I had a CF gift card. I probably won't spend my own money on that kind of service."
christine c.,"San Francisco, CA",46,377,1,3.0,12/5/2010,"Normally I wouldn't review a place like this, but my friend and I went for dessert one night this week and our server was the best! Her name was cut off on our check but it did read ""Nell."" So, Nelly, or Nell or whatever your name is, you're great. I could only ask that every Cheesecake server was as professional and funny as her. (A few weeks back I had a girl who was probably new and kept lurking awkwardly and touching her pony tail as she spoke to our table - gross!) but Nell, you're a doll. Keep it up!"
Chaundre D.,"East Cambridge, Boston, MA",0,1,,4.0,6/13/2013,"Hey y'all.  Tonight was the first time I went to the Cheesecake Factory-- and let me just say one thing: it was de-vine! Here's why I loved it: 1. They gave me two delicious half-loaves of bread in the beginning of my meal.  2. My waiter was handsome. 3. They piled on the cheese (I got the California Omelet-- I think there were 4 DIFFERENT kinds of cheeses). 4. The ambiance in the room was so fancy, I felt like a duchess. 5. The cheesecake! My only complaints: 1. They only gave me 3 pads of butter for a whole loaf of bread. 2. There was no butter on the toast that came with my omelet. 3. I could not understand my waiter. (But he was extremely handsome...) I would like now to describe what I ate to y'all. Here it goes: California Omelet: This was a cheese-y vegetarian de-light. It was certainly scrumptious. The omelet was fluffy and came with a bunch of fresh vegetables, sour cream, avocado, and 4 cheeses baked inside. I thought that the presentation was real nice, and the taste was de-vine. Then, I had the option of potatoes or tomatos on the side and I chose potatoes. They were a bit crispy; seemed a little over-cooked to me, but the seasonings were good. Over all, though, I've had better potatoes. The toast that came with it was dry and not buttered, so I did not eat it. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the best I've ever had. That's why I gave this restaurant 4 stars. I didn't think it deserved it until I ate some of the cake! It came with whipped cream and some chocolate sauce on the plate. Each bite was like fireworks in my mouth/throat. I tell you, I haven't felt as good as I did while eating that cheesecake in YEARS. If you are ever in Boston, you should definitely stop in to this one-of-a-kind restaurant, if not just for the cheesecake! God bless."
Peter W.,"Boston, MA",29,37,6,3.0,1/14/2010,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place. Every time I go it is kind of the same thing. It is right across the street from my office so it tends to be a lunch place for my coworkers and me. The portions are large, the food is decent although sometimes it is salted to death and I like salt. The service is hit or miss depending on who you get. Seems like there is a very high turn over with wait staff I rarely see the same people aside from the hostesses. The cheesecake is pretty good stuff though, and there are lots of different combinations. I haven't counted but I'd guess around 20 something flavors.  I've seen the lines on my way home for dinner at this place and I think you are probably better going somewhere else in the area. That or call ahead they take reservations."
Katyusha K.,"Laredo, TX",2,30,,4.0,5/19/2011,"I like the CF for the free bread, the good Cheesecake, and the hefty portions. I come to the CF more often than I should. I celebrate almost every occassion here. I've never had much to complain about other than the occassional bad waiter/waitress or the waitstaff forgetting to refill my drink.  I went earlier this week and had a bill of $21.24. I paid in cash and change. I was told by the waitress to take my change back as she did not want the 24 pennies to jingle in her pocket. IMO the waitress should have just taken the pennies and used it as change for other customers that paid in cash or just not made such a big deal about it. She had the audacity to ask ""You don't have a quarter?"" and to say ""Oh, no tip?"". I always leave tip unless I've had bad service - she provided decent service other than not refilling the drink until I was practically done with my meal. I was going to leave tip but she called me out on it just because I did not put $25 rather than exactly $21.24. I try to be exact w/ the bill b/c I have had previous waitstaff pocket the change which has ranged from $4 - $10. I don't order expensive meals that would require such a large tip so that is why I pay in exact change so that the waitstaff does not ""run off"" with my change as tip. To make it short, this waitress completely embarassed me by hassling me for a quarter and telling me to keep my change and then immediately asking about her tip. All she served was an appetizer and a dessert it is not like she has to hassle me for a tip of a party of 10 or something. It's ridiculous. I also went to the CF at this location for 5 de mayo. I had a waiter who was completely incompetent and rude. I was waiting for someone else to join me and he kept bugging me to order despite that I had only been waiting 10 minutes for my guest to join me. He did not bring out my guests Sam Adam's beer. When we reminded him about the beer he brought out the wrong one in the wrong glass. He took the bread away even though we were still eating it. He hurried us with the bill. Point blank: I am definitely going to think twice before heading to this location."
Chris O.,"North End, Boston, MA",3,17,,5.0,8/15/2012,"Can't say enough about this place. If you take into consideration the quality of food, portion, selection, atmosphere, price..I would choose this place over any in the world. And I'm dead serious. Bravo cheesecake."
Alvin C.,"Cambridge, MA",683,75,22,5.0,12/23/2010,"So anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to live in the Greenhouse directly across the street. If I was yelping for those 3 years I would have averaged about 3-5 check-ins a week. I digress... I could list a number of great entree's but the fact is there is something for everyone.  The same goes for their cheesecake (unless you don't like cheesecake).  I have had just about all of them over the years and have not had a bad one, while I do have some favorites. The portions are huge.  You will probably take some home, or waddle out of there.  the mixed drinks are fun as well.  The only downside is there will be a late if you go at the classic dinner times or holidays.  Still it is worth the wait."
