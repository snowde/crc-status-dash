Vik M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,,4.0,2/25/2013,"Quick walk from our base, actually we stayed at Sheraton and never left the hotel as its connected to mall. Had a Mojito, with Samosas as appetizers, Chicken Marsala fr dinner, prices were reasonable, staff was friendly,love it"
Ali M.,"Boston, MA",67,191,18,1.0,1/7/2014,I hate this location. I literally eat at Cheesecake Factory once a month and this is probably the worst location I've been to. The staff is rude and the food almost always comes out cold. I once got something to go that I have had probably about 100 times before and it was made with incorrect ingredients. I confronted the counter staff and the woman told me I was full of it and if I didn't want it I should leave it. I have never been treated this way and I will not be returning.
Alisa K.,"Cambridge, MA",324,229,71,3.0,9/14/2012,"As far as chains go, this place is solid. You can refer to Atul Gawande's New Yorker piece for some of the specifics (and how the healthcare industry could take some pointers from it). Really like their bread (love that it's warm) and their pasta (had the spicy chipotle chicken pasta minus the chicken).  The BBQ salmon was tender and not overdone.  Tuna carpaccio was tasty and well-dressed.  Shrimp jambalaya was good if you like shrimp (I don't). The servers were prompt and industrious though a little awkward.  Particularly liked the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. My only complaint is that a lot of the dishes were dressed with extraneous fried onions or what I can only describe as julienned tortilla chips.  Oh, and I've had garlic breath since last night and I can't for the life of me figure out what I ate that had garlic in it."
Ross G.,"San Diego, CA",25,131,5,2.0,12/3/2012,"Possibly the worst service ever. The girl took 20 minutes at least to check on us, the place was packed. This place needs to focus less on getting as many people in and out the door as possible, and focus more on quality. My friend's food was barely cooked, and had to be sent back. Which took an addition 25 min at least. Did i mention we waited 25 min before we were even given a table? Oh? have I got your attention now? Don't go here. Go to PF Chang's, legal or anywhere else in the malls. It's a shame too because the food is decent, as well as the desserts. With service this bad, you can't make an exception this was really unacceptable."
Kimberly H.,"Lincoln, RI",11,158,8,1.0,5/29/2012,"I had a new hire lunch here during my first week at my new company. All I wanted was just a large garden salad, without crutons/cheese- I knew my options were limited because I am vegan and have a gluten allergy. The first time i went there I asked if the balsamic dressing was vegan- I was told by wait staff that it was and trusted them as I thought they knew what they were talking about. The next time I went I asked about the dressing again, which were gluten free and vegan. They have no gluten free/vegan dressings- how could that even be with that large of a menu? Come to find out the waiter told me the balsamic dressing has honey in it- the waiter from the previous time told me it did not. It would be helpful for people with food allergies to have a seperate menu like other chain resturants do- bertuccis, not your average joes, burtons- these all have way smaller menus but offer way more information at the location for everyone's knowledge instead of having to rely on the staff. I can go to dinner at several different locations around the prudential center and not have any issues with ordering out. not good."
Olivia D.,"Madison, WI",187,26,13,5.0,1/7/2011,"If you have never been to Cheesecake Factory, make sure you pencil in some SERIOUS menu reading time, for it can take you over 20 minutes to get through the entire menu! My ultimate favorite menu item is the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad (i get the dressing on the side...all of their dressings are made form scatch!)"
Jeffrey B.,"Warwick, RI",2,47,,1.0,11/27/2012,Overpriced mediocre food.  I had a tough time finding anything good on the menu. The menu is like a phone book.  I decided to have the Tomato Basil pasta. It was really awful.  The chicken was drenched in Basil.  The sauce and Tomatoes were very bland. The pasta was overcooked.  I was not impressed. I did enjoy the lemonade I had with my terrible meal. The service was decent. I will not be back and I wouldn't recommend this  establishment.
Clive L.,"Brookline, MA",10,25,,1.0,3/17/2014,Food poisoning. Had the crusted salmon. Threw up three times. Thanks cheesecake factory.
Chrissie S.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",2,5,3,4.0,9/1/2009,"CF is awesome. Everyone knows it. Portions are HUGE (good enough to make two meals out of one) and tons of things to choose from. I used to primarily stick to the pasta dishes, being a pasta connoisseur but I have to say that I've discovered a new, probably often over-looked, dish that is definitely worth mentioning. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (pg.11 of the menu). It's a perfect mix of american-ized thai and goodness. It's chicken and shrimp, in a mild-ish curry sauce with coconut milk and veggies, with tons of rice. A great summer meal! Also if you're in the mood for something a little more italian...try the Chicken Belliagio. It's on the new special supplement menu... it's all sorts of goodness...lightly breaded chicken on top of spaghetti with basil/pesto sauce, drizzled with Parmesan sauce and thin slices of prosciutto to top it off. Enjoy!"
Rani P.,"Boston, MA",169,379,108,3.0,7/26/2009,"I've had good experiences and bad experiences at the Cheesecake Factory- but are we ever really going to Cheesecake Factory for an experience? No, not really. It's more about the huge menu and a place to take your non-foodie friends. However- I finally no longer look through the 100 page menu, and always order the ridiculously good Charbroiled Flat Iron steak and replace the french fries with green beans.  And some advice I wish I knew- ever order the classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries just because the strawberries are to die for? You can actually just order a bowl of them without the calorie-filled cheesecake."
Sally W.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,4.0,9/3/2014,"This was our second experience at a Cheesecake Factory, and it was much better than the first one. Great food , atmosphere and service. I was astonished at the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff. I recommend the beef and chicken sliders. Highly recommended."
Maxim K.,"Philadelphia, PA",35,21,43,1.0,4/2/2012,"Got my order wrong, gave me an old cheesecake, and, above all, made me physically sick from their fish dish."
Jennifer K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,57,89,3.0,11/3/2012,"Let me first say that I've been to many different locations of Cheesecake Factory, and I think this is the worst one I've been to so far. We had a fairly large party, so we tried to make a reservation, but I guess they don't do that? Since we were there on a Saturday night, we ended up waiting a very long time and splitting our party into several different tables in different sections of the restaurant. Also, this is the most crowded I've ever seen a Cheesecake Factory--ridiculous.  Anyway, our waiter was actually really awesome, patient, and quick, which is why I didn't give them 2 stars. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which I have had at several other locations and normally love. Tonight, however, it was super salty and there was a huge sprinkling (more like dumping) of cheese in the middle, which was odd because I've never had cheese in this dish unless I specifically asked for it. Overall, it made it salty and greasy, and unappetizing. The cheesecakes were pretty standard for CF, though, so at least that was comforting. Bottom line? There are so many other great places to eat nearby, so skip this Cheesecake Factory unless perhaps you come for lunch on a random weekday or something."
Jessica M.,"New York, NY",126,420,,3.0,1/1/2010,"My good friend works at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco so he had a $50 coupon for the restaurant. Usually when I travel I try to hit up locally known restaurants instead of chains but when gift certificates are involved - well, that's an exception. Cheesecake is pretty standard - we had the miso glazed salmon with sticky rice, which I'd never tried before. It was wonderful and large enough for us to share. My friend ordered our cocktails which were huge, fruity daiquiris. Mine was way to sweet and I couldn't even finish it; the libation was that huge.  Side note: EUROPEANS, especially Brits, LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. My friend from across the pond told me eating at the location in Union Square in San Francisco is on a list of top things to do when traveling the world!! Haha.  For that - I hope dining at Per Se in NY or French Laundry in Napa is on that list too."
Omari C.,"Boston, MA",3,3,,4.0,2/22/2013,They have great food there.The only problem for me is that some times I would usually get a rude waiter but there are some that are excellent.
J D.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,5.0,7/29/2014,I had the best service ever! Jessica was amazing. I've been to this location a bunch of times and never had such a good experience.
Mike D.,"Medford, MA",31,239,,4.0,8/12/2012,I have been to this location a couple times for dinner.  The service has always been good and the food is consistently good.  It is pretty standard if you are familiar with the chain.  The menu is deep and there is plenty of variety to order from.  The portion's are huge!  I will likely be back there!
Sandra C.,"Los Angeles, CA",376,437,2,3.0,4/11/2010,"I haven't gone to Cheesecake Factory in more than a year, and I would like to write about today's experience. I ordered the BROCCOLI AND CHEDDAR soup, and was greeted by tiny hard pieces of broccoli stalks inside the soup. It was annoying. Like chewing straws of ...hay. The bread was as usual...delicious. I had the herb crusted filet salmon. It was good...I didn't get to finish it because the soup ruined it for me. But other than that...Cheesecake Factory is a nice place to go to if you haven't gone in awhile. I really want to grab brunch there though...unfortunately I never wake up early enough (it ends at 2:00pm). Sad huh?"
Finn M.,"Suffolk, MA",6,86,7,4.0,9/22/2009,"I saw a review below from Stephanie M. that said Cheesecake Factory ""tries to be everything and therefore specializes in nothing."" Forgive me, foodies, but the four stars are for exactly that: the Cheesecake Factory does in fact specialize in doing everything.  They're a big location in a busy area that corners hotels, the ballpark, Northeastern, and Berklee.  They are exactly what's demanded of them: a place where you can take just about anybody, anytime, and get them something that they'll enjoy.  Next time you're complaining about how your burrito isn't ""authentic,"" look across the table from you.  Is someone eating a cheeseburger?  Or a pizza?  If so, you're the fool for expecting any of them to be some sort of ""specialty"" item.   This is a mega-raunt, and let's be honest, they do it well.  Everything tastes GOOD -- maybe it's not great, maybe it's not unique or exceptional, but it all tastes good.  If I can have good fettucini alfredo while you have good Cuban and your mom has a good shepherd's pie, you've gotta appreciate that.  They also don't cheat anyone even a little bit on the portions: you're going to get a dinner that will fill you. It's sort of ""cool"" to turn your nose up at the Cheesecake Factory, but they're laughing all the way to the bank.  They do what they do, and they do it well.  How could anyone be confused as to what this place is all about?  If they're not meeting your expectations... I give your brain two stars."
Jie D.,"Waltham, MA",0,9,,4.0,1/27/2012,I have been there many times. My favorite food is their clam chowder only served on Friday! It's the best!
