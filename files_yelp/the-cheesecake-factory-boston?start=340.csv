Kitty C.,"Quincy, MA",2,153,16,3.0,4/28/2010,"Whenever I order lunch from here, I always have enough food for two days, but its costs a boatload.  Beware the sandwiches or anything served on bread, the bread will be coated in butter or oil. Bright spot is the fried zucchini and the baked potato soup...yum My office used to go here for luncheons occasionally, and the service and food quality is consistently good-enough.  If you want some unadventurous comfort food, this is the place to go."
Sharline N.,"Boston, MA",15,10,,5.0,9/10/2013,"I took my daughter to this location on National Cheesecake Day and was surprised by how quickly the line moved. Our wait was about 30 minutes but Hillary the hostess made it seem like less. She kept checking on us and giving us updates on how much longer the wait was going to be. Our server, Tim, was very busy but what I liked most about him was that he introduced himself to us the moment we sat down and informed us he'd be right with us. I resent going to restaurants where you're ignored for about 15 minutes, which seem like 30 by the time you're acknowledged. Tim was right over with our menus...even though we know this menu, the fact that we were having a great experience made his dinner suggestions seem deliciously new. Dinner was wonderful and of course the decadent delights (cheesecakes) were the icing on the cake. A big thank-you to Hillary and Tim for making our evening memorable. When my daughter comes back from her semester abroad, we are definitely coming in to see you :-) Cheers!"
Michelle B.,"Suffolk, MA",23,15,1,1.0,8/14/2012,We usually go to the Galleria and have a decent meal.  I have a problem eating in dark restaurants.  Make me wonder what I am not suppose to see.  Tonight we went to the Prudential and because it was so late I decided to have breakfast.  Big mistake.  One egg over easy with an english muffin on the grill took 40 minutes and 3 tries to get it right.  After all of that I still could not eat the egg that was not cooked and the whites just ran off the plate.  I did eat the muffin that came back the second time after 15 minutes burnt but I was hungry.  My guess the evening cooks don't know how to make breakfast.  Maybe Cheesecake management should take it off the night menu and leave it for the morning crew (of course I have never had breakfast there in the morning so who knows???)  or properly train their night cooks.  Sorry Cheesecake... have to say it like it is.
Abby D.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,5.0,6/24/2015,"For such a large restaurant with such a large menu, Cheesecake Factory manages to do consistently well. Everything I've had there has been great, even the warm and delicious complimentary bread basket. For the past 3 times I've gone, I've gotten the ahi carpaccio starter which is absolutely incredible. It's fresh and flavorful and I highly recommend it. For drinks, I ordered the passion fruit mojito and my friend ordered the pineapple mojito. Both were delicious. For an entree, I ordered the popular chicken Madeira, and I can see why it's so popular! It's delicious but portion sizes are huge so if you're saving room for cheesecake (which, come on, you kinda have to) you might want to box the other half of the portion! For dessert I had the lemon meringue cheesecake as recommend by our absolutely wonderful server Matt. It was fantastic-rich and creamy, light lemon flavor with a toasted meringue topping. I would come here everyday if not for my diet! Love it."
Francisca W.,"Boston, MA",128,470,1014,4.0,1/25/2010,"(review dated 12/07): yes it's a chain, and yes their menus are usually soiled or stained (and yes it's gross), but it's a nice place to go esp when there's nothing better in the immediate surroundings that offers the same things at the same price range. and yes they're famous for HUGE portions, even the half-size salads are like a tiny mountain! food-wise, many are good (note ""not to be missed"" section), but i wouldn't go for the ""grilled"" sandwiches again unless they can skip the butter. the WHOLE sandwich is so greased up (i would say it's soaked in butter) my hands got all oily just holding it. in general, good food and drinks at fairly consistent levels. hence, they usually have a long wait, so better go early or simply avoid peak hours. p.s. many times we tried, many times we couldn't even stand the look of the dessert menu after the main course. :) Not to be Missed: THEIR BREAD!!! i have to make a difficult choice now that i found out the soft, brown ones are made w/molasses. appetizers: avocado eggrolls (love the sauce!), calamari, thai lettuce wrap (love the sauces!), ahi carpaccio, buffalo wings. mains: chicken piccata, steak diane, pasta di vinci. drinks: peach bellini."
Julia M.,"Brookline, MA",0,4,,1.0,12/8/2011,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. So greasy and fatty, no wonder they have a special ""low-cal"" menu. I went with a friend and both of us ordered burgers, the buns were soaked in butter and the burger was dry and overcooked. Terrible experience. If you go for the cheesecake, it is ok, just ok. For a place called ""cheesecake factory"" I expected more. Won't be back."
Harri S.,"Somerville, MA",109,315,77,3.0,1/24/2010,"I mean it's a Cheesecake Factory, the same in Boston, Los Angeles, and Tokyo likely Mars.  Location-wise this place was central and is HUGE. Almost as big as the one at The Grove in Hollywood. Service-wise, this location was more than up to par. They were super-cordial, and upon looking at our IDs for drinks, realized it was one of our birthdays and brought a brownie sundae on the house. Sadly, they no longer deliver via grubhub or the like...."
Kirsten B.,"London, United Kingdom",1,141,3,4.0,5/27/2010,"""Eigentlich"" mag ich ja individuelle, kleine, niedliche, Restaurants lieber. Auch das Konzept ""alles"" anzubieten von Burger, Asia, Pizza usw. überzeugt mich nicht wirklich.  Trotzdem fand ich es hier ganz gut, eine Wahnsinnsauswahl von A-Z, trotzdem gute Qualität, große Portionen, trotz Größe fand ich es nicht hektisch, Personal sehr zuvorkommend und professionell und das was mich zum 4.Sternchen überzeugt hat: die cheesecakes (kann man auch mitnehmen, wenn man sich nicht reinsetzen möchte)."
Andrew C.,"Bainbridge, PA",12,6,2,2.0,8/19/2012,I want to start off by saying the food was wonderful as usual. I went with my family and unfortunately it was my mother's first time at The Cheesecake Factory. We went around 4:30 PM on Saturday and the staff was terrible. They messed up orders one after the other and the waiter was quite rude. I haven't had this experience at other  locations but I will not be recommending this poor excuse for a Cheesecake factory experience to others.
N B.,"Boston, MA",2,12,1,3.0,5/16/2012,"Samd ole same for a chain. Large servings for the price. Known for their cheesecake which is a really large variety. Some how it seems their food isnt as tasty as when I was in college, or maybe because I dine out more often, not sure..and it varies by location. Usually order same stuff, shrimp scampi, skirt steak, pepper shrimp, nacho cheese, teriyaki chicken, can't go wrong (or can depends on location)"
Julie T.,"Boston, MA",145,262,35,4.0,3/10/2009,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, it's a chain. Yeah, I have to wait for hours for a table to open up. Yeah, sometimes it takes forever to flag down my server. BUT the place serves up consistently good food. Their desserts are even better! Yum... A couple things that I love from here: - Beef ribs (served with onion strings and fries) - Fried calamari (just good) - Chicken Costoletta (really crisp, served with mashed and asparagus) - Tiramisu cheesecake (mind blowing) If you don't mind the wait or the once-in-a-while crappy service, come here."
Nik B.,"Chicago, IL",120,353,138,3.0,12/17/2009,"It's kind of amazing that Cheesecake Factory can cater to so many tastes, and do a decent job with each.  I ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Club (without the bacon) and it was very good! I'm not really one to care about chain places, but today I was impressed with my food. We shared the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake which was also very good. It's hard to screw up a lot of sugar and tasty things put together though. I can definitely say that the portions are huge. I think for every 2 people you can just order 1 dish. Overall, I don't see any reason to come back to Cheesecake Factory. It's good for groups, especially in terms of catering to different tastes, but beyond that, there is nothing that wows me to the point where I would be excited to go back."
Meghan A.,"Providence, RI",31,122,,2.0,11/13/2008,"It's no wonder Americans are fat.  There is no reason for the Cheesecake Factory to have such huge portions. The last time I was there, I thought I would be safe ordering a grilled cheese with fries off the children's menu. Big mistake. Not only was it so greasy that it was borderline see-through, but it was HUGE. I wear instead of giving me just two normal sized slices of bread, they gave me the entire loaf and slapped some cheese on it. And butter. Massive amounts of butter. There is just no need for the portions to be so huge, and it's not like they are good left overs. The food isn't even that good when you're eating it there.  I'm not a huge fan of any of the cheesecake options. It's all very rich and takes days to get through. They do have a chocolate cake that I don't mind spending a couple of days working on, but that's about it. Everything else is just way too rich, too much, and too expensive. I can understand this place being your favorite if it's the only place in town, but when you're in a city there is really no need to go there. At all."
Manny D.,"Stoneham, MA",0,23,,2.0,5/14/2013,"Was there with family on Mothers Day.  Crab Wontons were super fishy tasting, even though I've had them several times before and they tasted normal.  Entree was disgusting.  The rice had the consistency of bad cream of wheat.  I never have a good experience with this chain except dessert."
Lindsey J.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,40,,2.0,7/13/2009,"Why do people like this place so much? I swear I can't go anywhere without hearing about someone pining to go hang out at the prudential center and then eat here. Why?  I'm guessing people don't notice that this place is your run of the mill chain restaurant that is only pretending to be special. I find the whole decor overbearing and the menu bloated. There food is just loaded with fat to make everyone crave it. When I want something fried, I'd rather go to some greasy spoon diner than wait for an hour to get seated here."
Steve S.,"MA, MA",227,471,3,4.0,9/25/2008,"Reading the other reviews, you would think Cheesecake is really McDonald's in drag.  Companies like Starbucks and Cheesecake should never apologize for their size.  Their offering is better than the independents.   Why would anyone consistently wait a hour  unless it was good Truthfully, the place amazes me.  Yesterday I had an egg white omelet.  My girl had a chopped salad.  The people next to me had nachos and tacos.  Next to them was steak and chicken.   Perhaps the Cheesecake is the most democratic of all restaurants, because everyone can eat anything...and its always consistent Small tip:  Eat at the bar"
G J J.,"San Francisco, CA",13,570,,2.0,12/11/2009,Sickening food. One star for food. I can't believe what I ordered (pasta) was so terrible. Basically 1 veggie option. Terrible. The reason it gets two stars is the desserts. That's all. Godiva cheesecake was great.
Matt K.,"Somerville, MA",0,2,,1.0,9/13/2008,"I've eaten here. I walk past it every morning on my way to work. But I refuse to believe that it is anything more than a cynical, cruel joke played on the world.  This place is not so much a restaurant, as it is a test of will. A test where The Cheesecake Factory promises to throw everything that's bad about chain restaurants at you, and dares you not to leave.  It looks like a casino: all gilded up, with giant columns everywhere, like some Mount Olympus of crapitude. But it's dark, insidious horror runs far deeper than the decor.  There is simply no way that any sentient human can endure, let alone enjoy eating at this place.  The menu is a sprawling, Dickensian monstrosity filled with twisted Epcot versions of the world's cuisine. There's Italian, Tex-mex, and, inexplicably, Goulash. There's even vaguely Asian things, which seem to have sprung  from some focus group where the question was: ""Name a foreign food you've heard of."" And it's all really, really, really bad. Oh, and as if all this wasn't bland and soullesss  enough, there are ads in the menu. For other businesses. Right in between the meal options. It's jus' like watchin' the elec-tru-fied television!  Now, some will say ""The portions are HUGE! It's a great deal."" But that's like saying ""This urine is cold, therefore it is refreshing."" Hey, if heapin' helpings is all you need, just eat 30 pounds of dirt for lunch, and save yourself the money. If you want decent food, eat somewhere else."
Ethan A.,"Boston, MA",19,287,,2.0,1/5/2009,"I'm not a fan of The Cheesecake Factory.  Overpriced, over sized portions, and overrated.  This location almost always has a wait, and trying to walk through the crowd on a weekend is brutal.  Stop sitting on the stairs people, I can't jump over you. That said, sure the food is delicious.  But you get gigantic deep fried portions of everything.  And you pay for such large portions.  Drinks are decent, but of course expensive.  Ten bucks for a mediocre cocktail?  This is a college town, there are plenty of cheap bars to get the same thing for half that.   In a city with so many great places to try, why come here at all?  It's just glorified fattening American cuisine.  Try something cheaper, better tasting, and odds are, better for you."
Anna W.,"Chelsea, MA",48,274,2,3.0,10/30/2008,"I am a Cheesecake Factory whore. It's not on purpose though! It just so happens that wherever I am, at any given point in time, there is ALWAYS a Cheesecake Factory around. So, it's become ""old reliable."" I used to work at the CambridgeSide Galleria, and my co-workers and I would go there every Friday night after close to grab some drinks and food and bitch about how much we hated work. When I finally left that place, I was so happy I could finally end my Friday nights somewhere different.... but then I ended up getting a job at the Copley Mall and hence, another Cheesecake Factory!  The food is essentially the same at all of them. This one here almost always has a wait. I don't get what the big deal is, but whatever. Their food portions are OVERWHELMING. Much too big for a single person to eat. My friends and I normally get some appetizers and share, or a pasta dish, or split a sandwich. There are a few things on the menu that I always seem to fall back on: -- Sliders. With fries. Yummy. -- Avocado Eggrolls. I don't know what it is with me and avocados, but I love them. -- Thai Lettuce Wraps. A little sloppy to eat, and the sauce drips everywhere, but I like it. -- Pasta DaVinci. One of my favorite pasta dishes of all time. -- Steak Diane. Little nugglets of meaty goodness. And it comes with their yummy mashed potatoes. Can't go wrong there. -- Pumpkin Cheesecake. yes, it's seasonal. I believe they have it now, and it sticks around till after the New Year. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it. I don't even like the taste of pumpkin, but this cheesecake is to die for. I just wish they had it year-round. Service is pretty fast. I love the large glasses they use for soda. Even the glasses they use for alcoholic drinks is good. Ladies, if you are looking for a good alcoholic drink that is delicious and won't knock you over, try the Strawberry Creamsicle. It is by far the most delicious drink I've EVER had, and well.... I drink a lot :-) Don't go here for brunch though. Their brunch food sucks. You're much better off going to Thornton's, which is across the street.  I would never choose CF to go to for a special night or date, but it's one of those low-pressure places where you can just go chill with your friends, knowing exactly what to expect."
