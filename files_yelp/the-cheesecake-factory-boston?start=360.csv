Amy K.,"Boston, MA",3,4,,4.0,5/7/2011,"I love this place and I always love cuban sandwich its simple,its easy,its delicious and don't miss a red velvet cheese cake. Yum Yum"
Casey Z.,"San Rafael, CA",14,72,4,1.0,10/28/2008,"I cannot stand this place, and i've never understood what the hype around it is. The only times i've ever gone is because friends for some strange reason want to have their birthday dinners there. but again, i don't get why people like it! 1- the wait to get in is freaking ridiculous, it's always long, i dont think i've ever waited under 30 mins, blah! 2- the staff blows. they put on fake smiles for you, and at the same time look like their about to stab you in the eye with your own fork. 3- the food isn't even that good! most of my friends make better food than they do here. i always think i've ordered something i'll like, but no they've found a way for me to not like it. this place blows. BLOWS BLOWS BLOWS!!!"
Sparky S.,"Medford, MA",2,40,16,3.0,12/11/2013,"The food was really good and tasty. Tex Mex rolls were great as starters. For main course, baja chicken tacos and Bang-bang chicken & shrimp were tasty and in good portions. The only bad thing was the wrong billing (maybe it was the waiter's fault!) . They added an additional item on to our bill, we were just 2 of us, so they should not have ideally messed up our billing. We were in hurry and didnt notice, only realized the additional amount that was billed later after reaching home. My advice, the place is busy, so make sure u get billed for what you eat."
Amanda J.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",37,172,,4.0,10/12/2009,"So after no luck with a long wait Thursday night, my friend and I decided to stop in on our lunch break today since we work in the Christian Science Center Tower next door. Mid-afternoon on a Monday you get seated right away, always a plus. Usually I go for the fish tacos, but today I tried the grilled eggplant sandwich. YUM! First, I should mention, it's so big and wonderful and cheesy that you can't really eat it like a sandwich. I had to cut it up and do the knife and fork thing, but I'm not complaining. The eggplant was very well seasoned. There was maybe a bit too much red onion but it was very easy to pick off. The roasted peppers and cheese were delicious as well but the best part by far was the garlic aioli butter on the bun. Oh my gosh that was exceptional.  My friend got a plain burger which was cooked perfectly. He was very happy considering our last attempt to get burgers (see my review of Whiskey's on Boylston).  The thing I like about this place is the amazing service. Our waiter was friendly and prompt, not overbearing while still being attentive. He also knew we were on our lunch hour so he did his best to expedite the food, get the check quickly, and even skipped the cheesecake speech since we didn't have time for dessert."
Nathan V.,"Boston, MA",0,14,,3.0,4/21/2009,"I'm sure almost all points have been hit by the 137 previous reviews...but here goes a few of my top things: 1. This place is always packed, be prepared to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes and most likely 30+ minutes 2. If you love bread like I do, then this place is awesome...go to town on the bread, I've asked for three or four bread baskets in one sitting, seriously. 3. They somehow have found a way to do a wide variety of foods in an acceptable way. Some items are better than others....appetizers are very good, and the bbq chicken salad is quite delicious, but huge, as are all their meals. 4. Don't spill water on your pants...it is quite embarrassing and then people will forever call you waterpants."
T E.,"London, United Kingdom",447,967,327,2.0,6/25/2008,"When my co-worker turned to me last week and said... ""Before you leave I want to treat you to a meal of your choice in return for the wonderful change in my life you brought when you yelped Coast Cafe"" What did I say? No... not Hungry Mother like he expected (and wanted). ""Cheesecake Factory, please!""    (coffee spits out of his mouth onto floor) Wha wha wha wha? why? I wanted to try, that's why. As a curious yelper and known enthusiast for social anthropology I wanted to see what made this place tick. Why thousands of people line-up and hang around for hours everyday all over this country just to get a seat at these gigantic restaurants that form a chain of megabucks that even has a NASDAQ symbol: CAKE. Why do you strange Americans come here? ===== ====== ===== ===== ===== ===== ===== ===== ===== 2 hours, 35 dollars and about 10,000 calories later and I need a man with a wheelbarrow to come take me home. 4 hours on from that and I can't sleep from fatness. I'm worried to go to the bathroom in case I do an Elvis and die. In fact if The Cheescake Factory was around in the 1970s I'm sure Elvis would've died a lot quicker. MY FINDINGS: Americans like going to places that are already popular, they like big portions for their money and they like choice. Lots of it. MY VERDICT:  A sad long menu filled with the most mediocre, middle-of-the-road dishes from cuisines around the world. All committee-picked to be the least adventurous and inoffensive. Every dish is played safe, ridiculously big and possibly the cheapest and most efficient way to get calories aside from blending up lard and shotgunning it through a funnel."
Max R.,"Essex, MA",5,3,,4.0,7/31/2010,"Usual corner stones of the CCF, overwhelmingly good service, huge portions, and slightly upscale atmosphere. I would say the food is slightly more than you would pay for in a typically sit down chain, but the huge portions, and the surprising quality of the food makes it more than worth the price. I would go there for a meal whenever there is one near me."
Serena L.,"Sydney, Australia",73,66,86,5.0,7/9/2009,"Out of all the cheesecake factory locations I've been to, this one is the best.  The service was great, perfect lighting, and I didn't even think the portions could get any bigger but the portions at this location is greater than the portions I get in California.   My family usually splits an order of Baja Chicken Tacos and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Their Baja Chicken Tacos are served absolutely divine. Three marinated grilled chicken in soft tacos to perfection placed with grilled onions and lettuce. Black beans, salsa, guacamole, and rice accompany the mouth-watering tacos. Usually 1 taco fills me up right away.  Evelyn's favorite pasta is what I would recommend to vegetarians. It's a huge plate and it has artichokes and eggplant (I ask them to not put in eggplant)."
Nadine R.,"Boston, MA",3,22,,1.0,1/23/2012,"Avoid going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Burlington mall. Service is poor, food is sub-par. It's been like that for years. Don't ask why I kept coming back. I think I would forget about how poor it was. It's really not a good experience. I'm done with this location."
Adam J.,"Westlake, OH",28,56,4,3.0,9/26/2011,"Like every other Cheesecake Factory -- if you've been to one, you've been to them all. Food is pretty good and portions gigantic. I was a little disappointed with the TVs at the bar though. I was hoping to watch MNF, but there were only two small TVs and after the 1st quarter the TV showing the game was switched to the Red Sox game. I guess it IS Boston, but it didn't need to be on both TVs 10 feet apart."
Jason M.,"Boston, MA",27,60,54,1.0,10/2/2008,"As if the masses outside didn't give it away, this is mall food for people with mall taste. (As an aside: I don't care about the tacky decor. I don't care that it's a chain. I care that the food lacks flavor and that they try to compensate for a shortcoming in quality with an increase in quantity.)"
Linh V.,"Boston, MA",9,116,6,3.0,6/30/2008,"I always want to be happy with my meal. With its huge portions and fancy smancy names, sadly I never am. For me personally, they serve way too much of a not so good thing. They should deduct quantity and improve quality. I can't say the same for the cheesecake, its a bit on the magical side."
Jeffrey H.,"Washington, DC",1037,662,564,4.0,5/5/2008,"Ugh, why do I feel the way I did when I wrote my Kohl's review (   )? Ya know, shame, remorse, cultural conformity. *Pops collar, slips on crocs, reads bible* But what can I say? The food here is delicious. I don't know what they're doing in the kitchen (I imagine some sort of leprechaun is mixing potions and sacrificing lambs) but it seems like every item on the menu just makes me drool. The portions are gigantic so be prepared for that. My friend and I split a ""small"" salad from their appetizer menu and  neither of us could finish the plate. Together, we still only managed to eat about half (and by half I mean I shoveled the dressing, bacon, tomatoes, and bleu cheese crumbles into my pie hole and ignored the heads of lettuce that were cluttering up space for fatness). For dinner I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. It came with a salad, but since I had just attempted to eat a salad to start, I chose to replace my side with french fries (twist my arm). The sandwich was behemoth and oh so delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my liking, but it's not like there was much room left in my stomach to eat them anyway. The helpful and attentive waiter wrapped up my unfinished sandwich and I was ready to pass out. Or vomit. Either or. But of course, the dessert menu came and we ordered a white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake to split (twists other arm). The cheesecake arrived with confetti sprinkles, mounds of whip cream, a birthday candle, and a herd of Cheesecake Factory waiters. SHIT. It's the night before my birthday. SHIT. I hate the birthday song. It makes me cringe, turn red, and want to crawl under a table and die. My friends know this. Do they care? No. So here it is, me, a cheesecake, and the herd. The song begins. I want to cry. But I see the dessert in the hands of my waiter Scott and I think, ""It will all be over soon."" *Singing ends, gathers up the rest of my dignity, spoons cheesecake into mouth....LIFE IS GOOD* This was my 2nd time ever to Cheesecake, and once again, I was not disappointed. The food is great, drinks are tasty, service is fantastic, and the high prices reflect that. Be prepared to wait since it's a popular dining spot, or linger into the bar area and stare some innocent people down until they hurry up and finish so you can grab their table. My only reasoning for 4 stars rather than 5 is their menu. It's too long and as my friend referred to it, it's like a magazine. It's so long they number the pages and there are even advertisements inside. *Orders food and books a trip to Disney World for the wife and kids I don't have* Point. Laugh. Criticize. I don't care. I went to The Cheesecake Factory and I loved it. *sips cool-aid*"
Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,4.0,7/13/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory appears to be in an alternate universe(or maybe just just Back Bay). Anywhoo, I enjoy this one over its friends because of the labyrinthine floorplan(way confusing finding your way back to your table from the ladies' room after a couple of cocktails), relatively low wait time, and the outdoor seating. Also, the bread seems to be freshest here, and the butter is always the right degree of softness. For some reason, this one always has a couple menu items I've never seen at another Cheesecake Factory, and the waitstaff is usually not retarded. Sooo....I always leave here pleased."
Amanda M.,"Cambridge, MA",4,20,3,2.0,1/6/2011,Every time I go here I leave disappointed... and with less much less $$. I feel like this place is trying to be a classy friendlies.  The slider burgers are disgustingly low quality (I feel like I was eating at McDonald's).  There menu is large to a fault and everything I've ordered so far does not live up to the price.
S B.,"Miami Beach, FL",63,372,37,3.0,6/2/2013,"I love the food here - but it can be on the pricier and fatter side.  5 stars for taste, 2 stars for occassional bad service, long waits for food and long waits for almost anything there!!!"
Peter G.,"Boston, MA",95,240,8,2.0,5/5/2008,"Begone evil chain! They can't tell you what's in the food because it's not made on-site. They can't modify your order because it comes pre-packaged (picking the 'things' out doesn't count). What kind of hooey is that? I'm paying $17 for a fancy-pants microwave meal?  Call me a luddite who wants an iPhone, but I think I will pass on mass-produced preservative-laced cryogenically frozen dining. I suppose the cheesecake is pretty good for having been frozen like Wesley Snipes."
Matt C.,"ALLSTON, MA",10,61,,2.0,7/5/2011,"WHY DOES EVERYTHING TASTE THE SAME? Literally everything on the menu tastes like everything else.  Loaded with salt. I work in the Prudential Tower, so occasionally I'll get takeout from here if I'm working late and need basic sustenance, but it's more of an issue of which of the mediocre chain establishments nearby I would like to order a plate of sodium from on that particular evening."
Anya S.,"Northbrook, IL",106,592,16,4.0,5/24/2009,"First of all, you all know Im hard to please, but Im giving it four (4) stars.  So, I finally gave in and we went there for deserts. We just got them to go, you know to avoid the three hour wait.  The service was great, fast, efficient. We got our deserts in about 60 seconds. My friend  got the trusted godiva cheesecake and I decided to brunched out and ordered the Tiramisu, not the cheesecake, the dessert.   The godiva was good, you know that and I dont have to repeat that.  But the tiramisu was finger licking good.  Yes, the tiramusi from Cheesecake Factory. Just chocolatye and creamy and yummy.  For about 5 minutes I actually considered going back and getting another one.  So, factory, you got two more stars.  Now, take reservations and  get rid of tweens, and all that yucky food, and maybe, just maybe you'll get another star."
Aaron C.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,156,,4.0,5/19/2009,The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chain restaurants in the nation. I like this location because it's so close to everything and very convenient. The wait isn't very long either. Please refer to my review of the Pasadena location for a full review
