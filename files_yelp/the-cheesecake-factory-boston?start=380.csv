Catarina A.,"Somerville, MA",6,23,,3.0,2/1/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory, bless its heart, does not try to be anything other than what it is. I give it three stars because, of course, the food isn't gourmet, but when friends or family are visiting from Europe, it is always a hit with them. Plus, I love their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps. Best ever!"
Nahalia R.,"Beverly, MA",4,24,7,4.0,9/21/2011,"I've eaten every pasta dish they serve as well as the Jamacian style black pepper shrimp and I have to say they do make a mean  meal. My favorite appetizers are the buffalo blasts and the artichoke dip. For the price you pay you get far more food than you would expect to show up in front of you. Also, I have never received anything but amazing service. I have to give props to the best waiter I have ever had, which is Emmanuel. If you go to this Cheesecake Factory you should ask for him personally. He goes above and beyond to make your dinner enjoyable and a bit funny. I go here all the time and will continue to do so as the price fits my very small budget."
Jeremy S.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,,1.0,10/11/2010,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  I asked around after hearing from him, and go a few more semi-positive comments.  I won't be listening to any restaurant recommendations from this friend any longer.  The Cheesecake factory is very overrated, way too expensive for what you get, and a very mediocre chain restaurant.  I've had better food at Chili's.   The menu is big, but the choices are somewhat repetitive.  I had the Memphis burger, being from the Memphis area, I'd figure they would at least make a decent representation of bbq.  I was wrong.  The bbq was tough, and there was only a small strip of pulled pork on top of a burger that appeared to be one and a half small sliders literally held together by a slice of cheese.  The beef itself was not bad, but the pulled pork on it was a disgrace.  The side of fries was almost exactly like burger king's fries, but there were not many there.  This was not worth $11.00. The service was even worse.  I had to wait around five to ten minutes for  a glass of water.  The waitress asked us if we would like bread, only to never bring bread.   My wife's dinner was just about as bad, greasy, hard pasta and small chicken breast medallions.  Very bland except for the extreme garlic and olive oil they soaked it in.   Do not even bother going here.  I will never go back, and I'll never get the fifty dollars spent back on this horrible chain."
Janssen M.,"Charlestown, MA",71,109,1,1.0,6/26/2008,"No. Just no. Occasionally my girlfriend will dupe me into going to a Cheesecake Factory and I'll try to convince myself that it will be half decent. So we go and wait 45 minutes on a damn Wednesday evening (what the fuck is this, Dorsia?) and I order something that even the Cheesecake Factory could not possibly screw up, ""Thai Chicken Pasta.""  I think back to all the delicious Pad Thai I've had in the past, oh man, Pad Thai is so fucking good, I can't wait to get my meal on and eat some tasty-ass wannabe Pad Thai. And then I dig in, all heavy syrupy ""peanut sauce"" atop thick greasy spaghetti. Two bites, fuck that. Boo to that, where the hell are my rice noodles?"
Jill G.,"Boston, MA",69,198,,4.0,8/23/2013,"For a very crowded and popular place, the service here is great. I have been to many large group parties here and the servers are very accommodating! Huge, affordable entrees and a menu that's so extensive, it's practically a book!"
Vik S.,"San Jose, CA",78,230,3,4.0,5/3/2008,"It's huge in comparision to TCF in my area.   Still we waited and waited.  Every time I go here, I am dragged here by someone else ( who just wants food that they ""know"") and I have to go in, head down and anticipating disappointment. Mahi tuna/mashed potato were surprisingly good, I have to say. Wrapped up the evening with some pistachio cheesecake which became my hotel room companion over the next 2 nights.  Delicious stuff...again I was surprised here. When alone and bored 3,000 miles away from home, I was sad to see my ""special friend""  reduce in size exponentially, and then finally turn into a crumble of crust that was thrown away by the maid staff  w/o regard. Ah well, I'm sure I will be back.......it's like death and taxes it seems for me, anyways."
Christopher M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",435,414,15,2.0,3/2/2008,"Two stars for interior design (which is to say having some and making an attempt. . . not that it's good).  After that this place blows me away with how blah it is. The menu is *wayyyyy* too expansive, and yet, nothing is really above mediocre (but is accompanied by a more than mediocre price).  The service is about what you'd expect at Applebee's, and honestly, I think the cheesecakes are kind of lackluster.  They all have the same boring pre-made-in-large-batches-and-pressed-into-shape consistency and ""perfection""   Ok, yeah.  I'm a cheesecake snob.  My specialty in the kitchen is cheesecakes.  I know what it takes to make a great one.  I've tasted cheesecakes from some of the greats,  So when I'm presented with run-of-the-mill cheesecakes in 101 flavors, I yawn. . . 101 times. Sorry CF. . you just don't do it for me."
LeAnn H.,"Brookline, MA",0,12,,2.0,11/24/2013,"i was going for 3-stars, as my general opinion of cheesecake is a-ok/quick/lots of options/easy and their saturday soup (eh, now sunday soup?) is my weakness, but the description accompanying 2 stars is more fitting for my most recent experience: meh. i've experienced better.  two of us went in for brunch yesterday. the server was friendly and all, but i'll cut to the punch line. one of us ordered scrambled eggs & toast w/ bacon, the other a veggie-cheese omelet -- nothing too crazy. when the food arrived, my omelet came on the plate with no potatoes and no toast, both of which come with. i asked that those be brought out. my guest then realized he didn't get his bacon either and we asked to have that brought out. upon cutting my omelet, i realized i had a bacon omelet with no cheese and had to send that back. at this point, the server is being very apologetic, and im being very patient. the manager was apparently sent over and she further apologized, and said she was having my omelet re-made.  when the bill arrived i was honestly surprised that the manager who took the time to come chat with us, i had expected a small gesture off the bill - i think that's customer service 101. if she didn't feel the need to comp my omelet, she could have at least bought us one of the two proseccos we ordered. something. i mean, i ate my brunch alone since by the time my corrected food came, my guest was already finished. so we each got to separately partake in a brunch that was 90% not what/how we ordered. just seems like cheesecake could have done a little more on the customer service end.  meh. ive experienced better."
Morris W.,"Roxbury, MA",0,25,1,2.0,5/28/2009,"Hey its Friday night, what do you want to do? Lets go down to the Pru and wait 3 hours for Cheesecake  Factory! Seriously, why do people go here? Every time I walk through the Prudential Center by the T its just a massive amount of people sitting on the stairs, waiting for their buzzers to go off, just to go inside and look through their massive menu. I hate it how when people visit Boston its always ""ZOMG lets go to Cheesecake"". With so many better options, why endure the wait?"
midnight i.,"Boston, MA",5,19,,1.0,1/16/2007,"I used to eat here maybe once a month, but haven't gone in almost a year and don't plan on going anymore. It just isn't worth the wait. I don't care how good the food is, a chain like this can only achieve a certain level. I can't believe people will hear ""Sure, a table of five will open up in about 1 hour and 45 minutes!"" and gladly pick up a pager and sit out in the lobby for nearly two hours just so they can browse an advertisement filled menu that offers food not substantially better than the Applebes down the block. Smell ya later, The Cheesecake Factory. Smell ya later forever..."
L H.,"Boston, MA",4,124,,4.0,6/21/2006,"I could not forget the first visit to Cheesecake factory in Cambrideside Galleria, Disney like decors - hand-painted yellow resin columns and brassy details and dark wood veneer partitions, with ambiguous shaped mosaic patterns and molding works, a true American pop style that was.   They do have some decent meals but when you go to Cheesecake factory, you tend to get ambitious and order funky ones and often get disappointed. The portion is always double the American diner serving size. ;) One appetizer could even fill the hungry sromach enough.  I would recommend anything from their dinner salads and from breakfast menu, and some en trees are quite healthy and well-prepared, but, whenever I try pastas/noodles, they taste shallow and sugar-sweet most of the time. Compared to  Galleria Cambridge Side, Copley Mall branch is a better choice with better foods and  definitely well-trained waiters. What I like in this branch is : 1. friendly waiting (Beware! Cambridge Branch waiting is totally opposite, very slow and untrained, they never show up to refill your drinks) 2. convenient location 3. some good menu like Thai Lettuce wraps(appetizer) en trees have good selection of ingredients some of which can pass as a top restaurant dishes. 4. Sunday Brunch (till 2pm) is a nice surprise too, yum what I don't like is 1. accepting no reservations(waiting can be over 1 hour during some busy weekends) 2. not enough waiting/sitting space 60-90 min waiting for a dinner except the opening hours, 10 min waiting around noon time) 3. one annoying Asian hostess(I am Asian and I have never seen that cold attitude from any Asian folks-she works during the weekends-2006) ***update, she is still working there but she has improved her manners dealing with young and shy customers and I am just happy with their hosts nowadays-2007 4. big proportion means doggy bags always or more wasted breads and others, and often shallow flavors with the sauce. You will soon learn what to order to your pleasing taste. Will I go there again? absolutely, but I have to be careful of what to choose not to eat too much sugar.  The people are not too loud and show good demography of different races and levels. The waiting service at Copley Mall has consistently been superb. Always smiling. This is a true family restaurant and I think it is good for big parties as well.  so, casual diners will be pleased with the atmosphere for sure. Enjoy  ;)"
Lisa R.,"Cambridge, MA",100,192,27,4.0,8/2/2008,"Okay, I have a history of being terrified of going to a Cheesecake Factory since an incident that happened about 9 or 10 years ago (at the Cheesecake Factory in Providence -- not this one). . . I actually had GLASS in my food. Yeah. That will make you not want to go back to a restaurant. There have been only a couple of times in the years since then that people I'm with have wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory, and I very reluctantly went. I never thought it was anything really great - just OK. However, I went last night to the one in the Prudential Center with a bunch of friends to celebrate a birthday. We went after work on a Friday, so of course the place was packed. However, we didn't have to wait long for a table, and we ordered a LOT of food. I have to say that Shea, our waitress was unbelievably sweet and right on top of things. We kept having people show up and we kept ordering more stuff, and she was just a trouper.  Even when we had already paid the bill, one of my friends asked for more coffee and water, and they were still nice to us. It was a perfect place for our birthday gathering - the food was good, as was the service. I love their appetizers, especially the avocado eggrolls and Thai lettuce wraps. I think I won't be afraid to go to a Cheesecake Factory again."
Bridget B.,"Cambridge, MA",197,574,3,2.0,1/6/2008,"I'm quoting Jessica M on this, because if this information is correct, it needs to be disseminated:  ""Did you know that Cheesecake Factory doesn't prepare any of their own food? It's all prepared at a central location and sent off to be reheated or ""grilled"" at the restaurants. Now you know, too."" For someone like me, who suffers from food allergies, this could indeed prove to be fatal if the servers of ""chefs"" are not aware of every ingredient used in the pre prepared food. I'm giving them two stars instead of one based on the benefit of the doubt. I honestly felt like they lost the plot once they stopped serving the onion strings, those were the best. As for the restaurant, it's an oversized (200 different entrees!)  TGI Fridays, or Bennigans, or whatever other Americana chain you want to point to, with the addition of a large cheesecake selection and a menu that actually has advertisements in it. Tacky decor, mediocre food, friendly servers (who apparently have to spend $120 on their own uniforms) and sickly sweet syrupy alcoholic drinks. I do however like the warm bread they give you at the beginning of a meal. But really the only way I ever seemed to end up here in the past was because I went shopping at the mall and was hungry and wanted to avoid the food court."
Jane B.,"Stoneham, MA",70,200,16,2.0,7/16/2007,"Over-priced, over-hyped, over-salted and over-buttered.  Seriously, it's like they drench everything in butter.  I hope you like some fries with your salt. Portions are huge but every time I walk out of this place I feel like I need to have my veins declogged."
Dave M.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,60,,3.0,10/30/2006,"So Cheesecake Factory seems to be the kind of place that you love or you hate.  In complete and utter honesty, I hate the place.  Why 3 stars then? Read my profile, I'm picky, but fair. ;) Why I don't like it: 1) the WAIT!!!! I simply can't comprehend why people think it's worth waiting an hour to eat here.  That said, would it be that hard to get beepers that have a range that actually allows you to venture past the halfway mark of the Barnes and Noble upstairs? 2) The menu.  I'm sorry, but I don't like feeling like I'm reading a laminated magazine when I'm trying to find something to eat for dinner.  Besides the silly ads, the way the menu is categorized makes it hard to find things.  Since they have so many things they have overlapping categories and that makes hard to keep track. 3) The food.  It's only marginally better than a TGI Friday's or an Applebee's, but the price point is signifigantly more than that.  Portion sizes are also inconsistent, meaning sometimes it's WAY more than you can eat and other times it's not enough. What I do like: 1) The bread.  Fresh warm bread is always a plus when you've been waiting for an HOUR and you're starving. 2) Girl appeal.  I don't know what it is, but girls seem to love this place.  Every girl I've dated in the last 3 yrs seems to be in love with this place and was always exstatic when we'd go there.  As a guy sometimes you just have to do what the ladies want, just not always..."
Queenie W.,"Manhattan, NY",198,109,197,5.0,1/27/2009,"Everything you dream about cheese cake can come to reality here. I mean, they even have two kinds of oreo cheesecakes. How amazing they are! Brunch are especially good. But look out for large calories and fat that you will take from each dish. They are really huge...^_^"
Jenna C.,"North Andover, MA",138,113,9,5.0,3/12/2007,"I don't care what all the haters say... I effing love this place. I know that it's a huge tourist trap but I still have nothing but love. The wait can be a little long and there may occasionally be annoying children but it's well worth it. The food is always delicious and the wait staff is extremely nice.  The menu seems never ending so there's no way you won't find something you like. To some people it may seem like too many options... but I don't think that's possible. Your meal is always prepared quickly and the portions are huge. The wait staff, as I said before, is awesome! and the cheesecake *DROOL* Cheesecake is my favorite dessert EVER! There are about 30 different kinds but I myself am a plain cheesecake kind of girl! I've tried my fair share but I always go back to the original. It is SO good. Literally cream-in-your-pants good :P Seriously even if you don't want to wait to eat there get a piece to go! In fact get 2 because you'll be craving it the next day.... SO GOOD!"
Chin C.,"Quincy, MA",31,147,331,3.0,10/5/2006,"Great place to go for dessert not a meal.  I went there several times, orders entree and couldn't finish it. They're way too large. So I ended up couldn't order dessert!!  Poor me, anyway I then decided to go there just for some cakes and that was fabulous. Hmm yummy, creamy, cheesy cakes. Prepare for a veeeery long line!"
John S.,"Newburyport, MA",0,7,,1.0,9/25/2011,"Things got off to a bad start when they served my water in a plastic mug; this is not in keeping with the upscale image for which the chain strives. I have learned that they have glass mugs for soda and just seem to treat those of us who simply want water as second class citizens. More importantly, my friend told me when I returned from a trip to the loo that someone at an adjoining table had found a roach in her meal. I had already seen a hair in my friend's cream. My meal was alright, and I accepted that it was a few dollars more than it should have been. I was looking forward to the cheesecake and enjoyed the taste but found the portion unduly small for the price. I spoke to a manager the next day; she did not respond to the reports of foreign objects but said that the plastic mugs and portion sizes were in line with corporate policies. She also did not seem to be very apologetic about anything."
Mike A.,"Cambridge, MA",53,83,6,2.0,3/20/2006,"The food comes in very large, overpriced portions. Everything on the menu *feels* heavy too...be prepared to loosen the belt a notch on your way out if you finish your plate. They don't focus on any style of food and they mix alot of world styles too. I hear they rotate some of the less popular dishes out of the menu to try new ones.   Reminds me alot of the enviroments you find in Las Vegas casinos on the main strip or perhaps on a cruise ship, although both of those places do a better job with the food than Cheesecake Factory.  I've never bothered with the actual cheesecake since it's not my thing but this is one of my last choices for a place to go out to eat. When I go to a restaurant, I go because I want a certain kind of food. They don't do any particular food well and every dish is plain mediocre.  On the upside, the waitstaff is very friendly and they get an extra star for trying."
