Goku U.,"Boston, MA",196,338,435,2.0,11/1/2016,"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday as a party of 8 to celebrate the achievement of a co-worker. Cheesecake was not busy and we had to wait about 10 mins for them to put a table together which I thought was surprising when I walked in and saw all the empty tables. Our waiter, Paco, was good, he was able to remember who ordered ice water, water with no ice, and lemon with water. He was patient when we told him to come back so we could have more time to decide what to order. I ordered the California avocado lunch salad without onions. The salad was recommended by the waiter. I ordered the salad with dressing on the side because Americans love to slather their salads with dressing which I don't like. My dish was presented nicely and there was a cup of dressing on the side. However as I started to eat my salad, I noticed that the dressing was mixed in. I was disappointed but decided to eat super-dressed salad. If you're going for salads, I highly recommend sweetgreen over salads from cheesecake. After we finished eating, we ordered 2 desserts to share: 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake. Never ever ever order the strawberry shortcake. The cake was dry and tasted really old. The ice cream and strawberries weren't able to recover the dish on their own. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes, but the cheesecake was 10x better than the shortcake. We only ordered the shortcake because the person we wee congratulating isn't a fan of cheesecake. Overall, service at the table was good. We had to wait in a half empty restaurant for a table. Food was ok, I really only come here for work outings."
Osh K.,"Lawrence, MA",109,239,1623,4.0,9/6/2016,Whats to say. I been going to cheese cake for years and at times its always been good to me. The food always good but I do love their salads. The cheesecake on the other hand never disappoints always new flavors and they are just so damn good. The Copley location is one of my favorites.
Lucy R.,"Miami, FL",0,109,4,1.0,2/23/2017,"Factory is the right word. What was once a fun concept 20 years ago is now a joke. Escorted to a dirty table and hostess asked to sit anyway and wait for a busser ??? Busser set up 4 settings for 2 of us even though we asked him not to. Server then came and asked if 2 more people would be joining us and left the extra silverware, plate etc. Nice start ! Chicken Picatta was swimming in runny, raw cream sauce (not cooked or reduced)  Chicken cutlets looked and tasted boiled, not sautéed. Salad was underdressed and took 10 minutes to get more. Was told ""bread was in the oven"" three times before it came out as we finished dinner. The good news is that both Cheesecakes were delish - thank God."
Megs L.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,2.0,7/24/2017,"Ummm wth? Been to many other Cheesecake Factory's throughout the land but this one was a BUST! We ordered Thai Chicken Wraps and Firecracker Salmon to start - both were really disappointing. The firecracker salmon was soggy, tasted very fishy and the most substantial part of the dish was the bed of raw red cabbage. What a waste of money. The Thai Chicken Wraps were essentially flavorless, in spite of being served with three sauces and very fresh ingredients.  We were disappointed by the apps so decided to forgo ordering mains. We were seated in the bar area between the kitchen and the front and noticed a lot of kitchen staff running to go orders to and from the front ... wondering if the quality of food coming out of this Cheesecake Factory is being seriously compromised by the quantity of food they are having to produce for take out. Big disappointment - will not return, will be reluctant to go back to any Cheesecake Factory for a while."
Paige T.,"Boston, MA",0,16,5,1.0,9/2/2017,"Absolutely do not come here. Unless you want to be taken advantage of and robbed. Hadn't been to the cheese cake factory in almost 2 years, & was beyond excited to come here. Fail. My boy friend, & I were seated and it took about 20 mins for someone to come over to us. When I saw and heard our waitresses slurred speech it all made sense. (SHE WAS ON DRUGS) At that moment my boy friend said ""should we just leave now"" but me being Hangry at this point figured the food would be out in no time although we still hadn't received our drinks or bread for table. I then grabbed a bus boy who was cleaning the table next to us and politely asked him to find our waitress since now it had been a half our since we were seated and the only thing on our tables were menus. The waitress came back over and pointed at me and repeated my drink out loud like she had forgotten them disappeared for another 20 mins. Now almost one hour prior to arrival I finally got up and found a manager whose name was (RYAN) I told him what was going on and he already knew who my waitress was and described her to the T. He then said that she had numerous complaints and her behavior had progressively gotten worse through out the night. I told him we were just going to leave and he pleaded and begged for me to stay saying he would take care of the check and was very sorry for what was happening. I went back to the table and they brought out our bread, one app, and on entree at the same time. I said to the food runner isn't the whole point of appetizers so it comes out prior to your meal, & with the other apps we ordered? Not one and one?! I was beyond frustrated at this point and asked the food runner to take the entree back and bring out our other app. We ordered buffalo blasts with ranch on the side and Mac and cheese balls. The buffalo blasts came out right away but there was no ranch so we waited and waited and waited for about 15 mins until the buffalo blasts were ice cold so we didn't eat them. We only ate the Mac and cheese balls. The manager told showed us who was supposed to be taken care of us for the rest of the night the only time he checked on me was when he asked if I wanted to comp the entree since it had been sitting in the kitchen and was now cold.. I told him well I would hope they would make and send me out a new entree since it's not my fault our waitress was busy getting high in the bathroom.. then was very confused because the manager had just begged me to stay saying he would comp the bill. Our new waiter disappears and my self and boy friend are just awkwardly sitting there with empty drinks thinking sooo are we all set then since he said it was taken care of and no one has come over to us for 30 mins. So we got up and walked over to the cheese cake counter to take desert home since we didn't touch anything but our one app we knew we would be hungry later the SO CALLED MANAGER chases us over causing a scene saying we were DINNING AND DASHING! I was mortified and began to cry I couldn't believe this and him causing a scene did he not remember the conversation we just had!? Probably not because it was a long dreadful 21/2 hour of painful waiting later. He claimed he said he would only comp one thing off the bill and not entire bill although we only touched one plate... he didn't take anything off the bill and charged us 70$ in full for food and a miserable experience.  I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN. Ps he also let the waitress keep her table right next to us where she was creepily laughing and slamming silverware and plates while serving. It was one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences of my life."
Grishm P.,"Downtown Jersey City, Jersey City, NJ",14,3,,4.0,8/25/2017,"The place was packed even on a Wednesday. This says the value of this chain. I was given a wait time of 10 mins and was provided a table in 5-7 mins. The place is big, clean and has ample of sitting area. The server was kind and had a smile in his face. We were given ample time to go through the enormous menu and select our meal. We had ordered the avocado toast which was a bit bland in taste but the toast was crisp. The chipotle pasta was delicious and the best part was the giant hersheys cheesecake.. a must have for any chocolate lover. Would definitely visit again."
Siya P.,"East Falmouth, Falmouth, MA",68,23,8,5.0,10/11/2017,Can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. Definitely a once in a while thing for me because it's very pricey. Always get the same things and never regret it
Angel S.,"Boston, MA",0,38,11,5.0,6/26/2017,All kinds of fabulous! They have a dish for every mood! Except sushi... I wish they had sushi... I would live there! The Godiva cheesecake is to die for and the original with strawberries is equally fabulous. Completely recommend all Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have been to so far.
Ted B.,"Staten Island, NY",1,22,20,5.0,9/12/2017,My first time at this Cheesecake Factory. We were happy with the service and the food . Nothing to complain about . Next time in Boston I will go again
Mary I.,"Stoneham, MA",22,340,1336,5.0,12/30/2016,"Overall, I had a good experience at this location. I came on a Wednesday night and the wait was 10 mins. Our server came soon after we sat down and our food came out quickly. Would come back again ."
Taryn S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,31,,5.0,2/15/2017,"My favorite restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory. I like The Cheesecake Factory        because of the food. I also like how it looks. My last reason is the dessert.                     I think the food is very delicious. There is lots of food on the menu but I like the grilled cheese because it is not over cooked. I also like fries with my grilled cheese. I think the fries are the best because they aren't too hot or too cold. There is pizza and lots more. The waiters also give you free bread with butter when you sit down. They give you any kind of bread you ask for if they have it. I like the plain bread. That is why I love the food at The Cheesecake Factory.   Another reason why I love The Cheesecake Factory is because of how it looks. There are benches with a rectangular table across. But if you want there are chairs with pillows on them around a circular table. When you are done and waiting for your check there are couches to sit on. I think The Cheesecake Factory looks awesome. It looks like a very cool restaurant. The one I go to is in a mall, on the bottom floor of the Prudential.  Finally we get to the delicious dessert. Its called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason because the restaurant makes cheesecake! Also if it is your birthday you can have cheesecake and an ice cream sundae. There is LOTS of kinds of cheesecake. Some flavors are plain, oreo, and strawberry cheesecake but, there is WAY more!!The dessert is SO yummy, you should probably go and get some! Those are 3 of the reasons why I love The Cheesecake Factory. The 3 reasons I wrote are only some reasons. There are more reasons why I love The Cheesecake Factory too. You could go there and see if you agree with the things I wrote!  - Written by William, a student in Ms. Taryn's class"
Hannah V.,"Flushing, NY",167,163,407,1.0,11/28/2015,"I don't know why it's so famous but nah... This Huntington ave. Cheesecake Factory is hugee with fancy structure and decor inside. The floor is super slippery!!! I almost felt off my boots walking in there. Don't they ever clean it??  There are various types of food offered but I just feel like none of them is really good. There are American, Italian, Chinese, Thai, even Vietnamese food...and it sucks. I had fish and chips and garlic cheese bread. The fish is so bland. It has no taste at all I can't remember how much salt I had to put on. The garlic bread would be better without cheese cause it got too greasy. I did have a ""fresh"" strawberry cheesecake which was fine but Im not really a fan of cheesecake after all so... The price sucks compared to the quality of food also. We only had three dishes, in which one of them is appetizer and one is dessert, with a cup of lemonade. It costs almost $50 icld tips. Ridiculous place don't know why people are so obsessed about it. They came to take pictures?"
Rose G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,19,73,5.0,4/16/2017,"Delicious breakfast on Easter Sunday! Tried to go to Thorntons- long line and no parking- when in the Prudential mall, parked and saw Cheesecake/ a sure bet and it was awesome!!"
Kevin B.,"Mount Juliet, TN",204,723,703,3.0,12/21/2016,"We came here for some snacks and a drink back in November and it was just an okay experience. The service was fine and the food and drinks came out quickly. It was decently tasty, but nothing that I would go out of my way to try again. We didn't have a chance to get dessert, so I can't comment on that."
Michael M.,"Cambridge, MA",99,2,,1.0,8/22/2017,Lemon garlic chicken gave me terrible food poisoning. Hadn't eaten that day and was throwing up four hours later. Tasted good but not worth it obviously.
Alina C.,"Boston, MA",0,12,4,5.0,6/24/2017,"I have gone to this place multiple times. Great bread, serving size for the price, and desserts!"
Therese M.,"Råde, Norway",32,123,528,4.0,6/1/2016,"I went here two days in a row before I decided I had to try other dining places as well before going back home to Norway  The dishes are delicious, the menue varied, and the portionsizes is out of ordinary dimensions  You will definately be FULL after the salad dishes. And salad would be one of the better choices if you plan to go for any of the cheesecakes for dessert. I have never seen such huge portions and cakes stuffed with so many ingredients (and kcal's!!) before!! The place is always crowded and often with waitperiods of 20-30 minutes....which you are offered to spend in the bar. I highly recommend the Sheilas warm chicken & avocado salad with peanuts, and the salted caramel cheesecake"
Ronnie R.,"Boston, MA",1,44,2,3.0,3/19/2017,"Near closing time, the waitress said they ""threw out"" the bread and we weren't able to get any. It's like 10:30 pm hits and they start to clean up, even when they are still open for another hour. I got the vegab cobb salad because I was trying to be healthy. Big mistake. That salad is a disaster. It was like a the cook went to a salad bar and put EVERYTHING on a plate and covered it in dressing. I think the vegan cobb salad needs a revamp because usually vegan is awesome."
Diana L.,"Boston, MA",383,12,,5.0,8/11/2017,"This is my favorite spot in Copley to eat. The restaurant is so big and I love going through the maze to my table. The service is excellent, food never disappoints. They're well known for their cheesecakes but their pasta is amazing as well. Portions are huge and their cheesecakes just melt in your mouth! Go for the honey wheat brown bread while you wait for your food. Super romantic but I wish the lighting was brighter!"
