Jessica M.,"Somerville, MA",10,51,4,2.0,1/5/2008,"Did you know that Cheesecake Factory doesn't prepare any of their own food? It's all prepared at a central location and sent off to be reheated or ""grilled"" at the restaurants. Now you know, too. I learned this fact from a friend who has a severe egg allergy; they were unable to confirm if any of their food was safe for her to eat. The artifice of the decor reminds me of Las Vegas, although I am more easily able to forgive Vegas for being Vegas than Cheesecake being an aspirational middle-class view of luxury. I am conflicted because I have eaten here a couple of times and their goulash dish seriously reminds me of my grandmother's."
Chirag P.,"Boston, MA",12,108,,5.0,2/12/2009,"This chain deserves high marks.  Although most of their foods overpriced, they do accommodate for budget college students with their sandwich menu.  Also, the way I see it, I never actually finish the plate with the huge portions I get, so I take the price, divide it by 2 and see it that way.  Same with the cheesecake slices, I can never finish one on my own so I split it with someone.  When they go for a particular food type, they go completely outside the norm of authentic, but the food still tastes great.  You want authentic (insert food type here), don't go here. My only bad experiences here were either fixable or inevitable.  Found out I was allergic to shrimp, obviously not their fault.  The second was missing the black beans for the factory burrito grande, but they were quick to give a side of that.  The third was ordering Jambalya, only to find out it has shrimp in it (I must've been out of it that day, it was clearly written on the menu).  No fuss, they replaced it with a different item at no charge. The only downside is the wait to get in when its busy, but the way I see it they are doing everything right, so it has nothing to do with slow service."
Happy Eater B.,"Atlanta, GA",1,109,1,3.0,9/25/2010,"Ok, the obvious pros: The ambiance generally works together to say, ""this is a classy, nice restaurant for mobs of people to get food."" The food portions are huge and the food is really good. They have tons of seating and are very popular. The waitress we had did an excellent job with everything.  Very well trained and just a nice person. They lose one star for putting advertisements in their menu.  This is *so tacky.*  They almost lose two stars for this.  It is completely inappropriate. They lose another star for not being absolutely amazing overall and for being a bit too pricey."
Lauren B.,"Boston, MA",57,115,,4.0,11/5/2007,"Normally I am anti-chain, but I have a weakness for the Cheesecake Factory.     The key is to get past the pseudo pretension of the hostess station (which usually involves giving stares of death to everyone who gets seated before you).  Then, there's the epic journey past garish decor that people like my grandmother appreciate and continuously comment on.  Finally, upon reaching your table, there's the quest for the perfect selection.  Once you've decided, the real test begins: can you restrain from eating all the bread?   Being seasoned veterans, everyone at my table wisely tore off one small piece and pushed the basket aside. On this Tuesday night, the restaurant wasn't crowded and our two appetizers arrived quickly- grilled artichoke (mmm...excellent with dipping sauce) and edamame (best sprinkled with salt).  It is essential to pace yourself- if you dive in like a ravenous beast, you'll get full to quickly and won't have room for your massive entree.    For our main, my fellow vegetarian and I each got the Luau Salad, substituting chicken with portabello mushrooms.  We followed the cardinal rule: if there are two vegetarians in a party, you get to be as high maintenance as you want.     After dinner, the waitress came over and asked us if we wanted dessert.  OF COURSE we wanted dessert.  What tops off a 2,000 calorie dinner more than a gluttonous hot fudge sundae?  It's living the American dream."
R F.,"Malden, MA",52,178,1,4.0,9/6/2006,"They're ALL Robots!!! It should be a 3.5, because it's above average, nothing special.  i don't eat cheesecake so that might have a slight effect on me not liking this place as much because with a name like the cheesecake factory, i'm pretty sure the cheesecake would be good (for people who eat that crap) anyway, this location is better than the cambridgeside mall one, because (I think) it's newer, nicer, and bigger.  The food is real good, huge portions, but again, nothing special.  There isn't anything bad about the place except that the waiters (Robots) are only pretending to be friendly, expecting a great tip by saying ""awesome"" 100 times in a meal service, screwing up a simple salad order, and fake smiles, when they pop up on the opposite side of the table that they just left to refill your drink for 10 minutes...  if you can see them through the ridiculously packed restaurant..."
Fan L.,"New Haven, CT",1,61,16,5.0,2/10/2011,Great place for dessert. I love their upside-down pineapple cheesecake. :)
Min Y.,"Somerville, MA",3,64,31,4.0,3/8/2009,"Food experience is typical American, but their dessert is awesome! Their cheese cake are the best cheese cake ever!  Also, the interior decorations  and food display makes you feel this is a high-end restaurant, but the prices are  reasonable.   Only bad thing is that there is a l-o-n-g wait before you have to go eat.  Depending on the occasion, the wait is worth the time."
Sarah S.,"Wakefield, MA",32,157,1,4.0,1/25/2007,"Love it. I don't care if it's a chain- love it. It's practically worth going for the brown bread you get before your meal alone! My favorites include the bleu cheese, endive, and carmelized pecan salad (very tasty and filling!), the chicken marsala, the fish and chips, and the dulce de leche cheesecake. A schmeck expensive, but portions are typically huge.  Only downside for me is the seemingly endless and unavoidable wait if you want to have dinner at any location, especially on the weekends. I recommend that on the weekends, you head to the Pru about 30-45 minutes before you think you'll be hungry, put your name in, and then shop a little in the Barnes and Noble before returning to the restaurant. Or you could just go for lunch!"
Andy H.,"Boston, MA",0,25,,4.0,8/8/2011,"I live nearby, so I've been to this CF multiple times, and have had a variety of experiences.  To start, my parents love this place, and when they are in town they usually stay in the Colonnade Hotel, which has some sort of reservation system set up with the place? Either way, when I eat there with my parents, the food is always great and I always leave full. I've had the Mahi Mediterranean (probably my favorite) as well as the Hibachi Steak and the Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira combo, and I would highly recommend all of them.  Be advised: If you are a party of more than two, make a reservation! Or expect to wait at least 30 mins and closer to an hour to be seated. When I come with my girlfriend, as a party of two we are generally seated much faster than other parties. Also the service is exceptional, and they are very polite about asking for ID when you order drinks, some places I feel almost afraid to order a drink in anticipation of the inevitable ""ID please or you get nothing!"" statement from the server. Even though we are full, we always get a slice of cheesecake to go, its that good! I have also have some crappy experiences at this restaurant. For example, when you go with a larger party of mostly under 21's that have water and a burger, and all ask for separate checks, you are not going to be treated with the utmost kindness. Even though I almost don't blame him, our server rushed us through our order (there were 15 of us, and we had a reservation) We didn't get any bread, and were presented with our check(s) while we were still eating. It was pretty rude, we were only there 45 minutes at the most and the guy probably made 40 bucks off of us. which, being a server myself, is a good deal. Will be back, but am more tempted to find cheaper options when dining on my own dollar."
Lady Fang Y.,"Boston, MA",30,68,,3.0,7/12/2007,"I can't help but LOVE the cheesecake there. The entree's are delish, but expensive, raspberry martini's are perfection o90but...the wait staff....needs a lil work. She took 10 minutes just to come to our table for the first time, 15 minutes to come back with water and no drinks. Another 10 to take our order. Food didn't come for 20 minutes. And when it did come, it took her 15 MORE minutes to see if we needed anything else. Like, oh I don't know...maybe my drink I ordered 45 minutes ago? She was sweet, It looks like she was trying, so we left her 30% anyway. She gave us directions to go to newbury st.  If your cheesecake wasn't so damn crack-tifying...I'd eat some where else. But, your food so goooood. Please try to keep in touch with your tables. I'll be back."
Clara L.,"Boston, MA",119,299,1,3.0,10/26/2010,"So I won't put this in my Chain of Fools list, because, well, it wasn't the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been in.  I decided to be lazy for dinner and have someone else make my dinner for me.  I ordered an appetizer for dinner and got the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls.  They were alright.  For $10, I got 3 summer rolls, two kinds of dip (sweet chili and thai peanut), and free bread and butter.  I love free bread and butter.  It wasn't the most filling meal, but I should know better than to order an appetizer for dinner.  Thank goodness for the free bread and butter.  It was still worth it to not have to cook dinner."
Paul D.,"Boston, MA",6,73,,4.0,1/28/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory, as a chain - can be hit or miss.  I have had a great meal at the Providence location, and had a terrible one at the North Shore Mall location.  Still the service and quality of the food, drinks and desert at the Prudential Mall Location (mentioned here), is consistenly solid - and has had me coming back often. Most of the time, I avoid the restaurant and head straight to the bar.  They have some truly fantastic bartenders (Walt is the best) and you get your food faster, your drinks faster, lively conversation, and you get to watch the whole operation from a front row seat. I will be back soon."
Brian P.,"Allston, MA",5,20,1,5.0,4/22/2007,"This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in the past few months, and the best part was I didn't even have to walk into the restaurant. I placed my order on   roughly an hour before I normally eat dinner and by the time my meal showed up (about 45 minutes) I was ready for some delicious food.  Let me start by saying that the Roadside Sliders are incredible. Rarely will I order something as conventional as a cheeseburger when I order from a restaurant that has a ton more to offer, but after the first bite I was completely hooked. They're basically mini-burgers that you can finish in about 4 or 5 bites (1 or 2 if you're REALLY hungry). They were so flavorful I had to order another batch the following week. Top it off with a slice of Peanut Butter Cheesecake and you'll be one happy customer. An excellent choice for any occasion."
Sean L.,"Boston, MA",301,161,61,2.0,2/12/2006,"I had some sort of Oriental Orange Chicken.  It was great but overpriced like everything else here.  The waiter was alright.  Normally this place is packed at night with a wait of at least 30min and for whatever reason they do not take reservations.  I might have gone here more than once if they did.  On second thought, no, I wouldn't.  This place is overrated."
Felecia C.,"Boston, MA",49,169,,3.0,12/21/2006,"I used to be in love with the Cheesecake Factory, but this love has faded so much that I almost never want to eat here (at least at this location) when people suggest it.  My main reason is the waiting time. This is like a 9 step process. First, put your name in. Wait 30 min for a buzzer. Then wait another 45 min for the buzzer to go off. When it finally does, you are ushered into a line of people STILL waiting to be seated.  I realize that Copley is a popular destination for tourists, professionals, suburbanites, students, etc...but when it takes longer to sit down than it does to actually eat my food, I have an issue.  The Cheesecake Factory is also not THE best place to eat if you have food allergies.  I think it really depends on the location, time of day, and server, because often I feel like it is too much effort to really make sure that my waiter understands all of the complexities that go into cooking for someone with celiac disease. I'd rather just order a salad, hold the bread and dressing, and say I have a wheat allergy.   I have read on some celiac message boards that at some locations, a manager or chef will sit down with you and pick whatever you want to eat...but at other locations, you'll be told ""we can't guarantee that ANYTHING can be made gluten-free.""  Thanks.  However, I am aware of a couple gluten-free desserts...the ice cream, goblet of strawberries (so simple, yet so delicious), and the Godiva cheesecake. Apparently there is no graham cracker crust...but I don't trust that it's not been contaminated by other cheesecakes in the bakery.  Despite the fact that I have my own hang-ups with Cheesecake, they do offer a huuuuge menu and decent service. Any waiter that says ""Sup, boo?"" or ""You done hittin' that?"" is awesome."
Aubrey O.,"Canton, GA",206,136,12,3.0,6/11/2007,"I guess I never really understood the hyper about Cheesecake Factory.  The first time I went to it was in Miami and it was pretty good, not great though.  My pasta was so dry and stuck together, I hate when it's cooked like that.  I thought maybe it was just a fluke, cuz everyone else's food looked great!  The second and third time were the same and I was really let down considering how much their food is.  I love pasta and feel like if you can't do pasta right then what the hell is wrong with you?! Either way the Cheesecake in Boston was no different.  Apparently whoever owns Cheesecake thinks that that's the right way to make spaghetti....I mean, how the hell do you mess up just a normal plate of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce??  On the other hand, their Louisiana Chicken Pasta is really good! Other then that, I love their drinks! Esp. the frozen iced mango----SO FREAKIN GOOD, practically heaven :)  Their salads are huge and tower over everything else you order.  The Chicken Madeira is my default dish with a side of steamed broccoli--yum!! If you want something a little spicier, the Spicy Cashew Chicken is my bf's fav.  And for appetizers?  While I'm usually partial to fried calamari with marinara sauce, their Roadside Sliders is def. the way to go!!  You could even consider it your meal :) While it seems I like Cheesecake more then I first claimed, the fact that they can't make a good, simple pasta with marinara really disappoints me...."
Stephanie C.,"Seattle, WA",0,19,,1.0,1/12/2011,I got a salad here and was even willing to pay $17 for it. I've had a CF salad before and it was ginormous--very satisfying.  This one was the size of a large appetizer salad.  Definitely not a dinner salad or the kind of salad you can make a meal out of.
joshua m.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,19,,3.0,10/22/2007,"The first thing I feel compelled to mention and feel everyone should know is that the Cheesecake Factory doesnt make their own cheesecake. It is from S&S in NYC. True dat. But beyond that, yes... they give you large portions. They should, for forcing you to wait an hour and be crammed in there.  The waitresses have to wear white pants. I feel badly for them.] The food is not that good. It is not that bad, but it is not that good.  You can count on this place to be consistently okay. J"
Amy L.,"New York, NY",0,9,,4.0,4/17/2011,"I go here pretty much often because I love this place! their food is great, especially pasta da vinci and plain cheesecake with strawberry is the best! but the only bad side is that the waiting line is long~~ I would have given 5 star if it wasnt for the long waiting line. but I still go because I still have a choice of take out =)"
Caitlyn L.,"Boston, MA",269,157,,2.0,8/21/2007,"I just don't GET the hype...everything I've gotten there has been the definition of mediocre (and the salads are just plain bad), the prices are high (for mediocre food), and the wait's always long, often longer than they even tell you.  So many people seem obsessed with it and I just don't understand....maybe the allure of being an ""expensive"" chain??  There's so much better food out there. Cheesecake's good, though."
