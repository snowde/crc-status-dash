courtney d.,"Boston, MA",15,33,,3.0,5/1/2006,"Ive always like eating here, although they don't specialize in any type of food so its incredibly hard to decide what you're in the mood for.   The portions are ridiculous, and strangely I rarely eat the cheesecake because I'm usually too full, but it is delicious.  The only downfall is they don't accept reservations, so unless you go at 4pm on a Tuesday, expect to wait a decent amount of time to be seated."" 05/01/2006"
Ali A.,"Boston, MA",39,87,2,5.0,2/3/2010,"Do I dislike waiting 45 minutes for a table?  Yes.  Do I hate tourists in my city?  Yes.  Do I detest eating next to large groups with many children?  Yes.  Do I put up with all of those things over and over again just for the Tex Mex Eggrolls and Santa Fe Salad??  Yes.  Yes!  YES!!  Call me a sell-out, call me uncultured, so help me God, I love the Cheesecake Factory!"
Shelly A.,"Boston, MA",21,74,14,3.0,1/11/2008,I hate to say it but the tourist trap has some pretty decent salads. Just make sure you order the small or you'll be digging through 2 heads of lettuce trying to find the ingredients the whole time. Of course the cheesecake is good but isn't all cheecesake? I will also say that they manage to get your order right consistently and find you a seat with a minimal wait even when it looks hopeless.
R. L.,"Brookline, MA",0,18,,4.0,6/1/2011,"For more pictures, please refer to:  i love cheesecake factory so much, I made it a point to make that my last meal before I left Boston for good. I have come here probably 6 or 7 times in a span of 9 months. My only wish now, is for Cheesecake Factory to appear where I stay. But in a way, it's non-existence is a good thing because at least it ensures that I don't increase a few inches on my waist! I'm not really a cheesecake lover, but I adore the cheesecakes here! My theory is that if you are a real cheesecake lover, you won't like the cheesecake here. But if you are like me (i don't really like the strong taste of cheesecakes), Cheesecake Factory might just be the place for you. So far, I have had the Godiva cheesecake (heavenly), Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. It is so creamy and decadent, it makes me want to cry. The main dishes are great as well. I had the Margarita pizettes, BBQ pulled pork burger and portabello mushroom burger. While I really love all of them, I have to warn you that the caloric intake of these food is really high, even with the portabello mushroom (yes i checked it online). That aside, I love how juicy the portabello mushroom is as you take a bite into it. The buttery goodness on the lightly toasted bun complements the juicy mushroom. The BBQ pulled pork is also great, soft and juicy, just done the right way, not too salty. Great place to have a meal, if you are not concerned about your waistline!"
A T.,"Boston, MA",21,127,115,3.0,3/7/2008,"I am giving it three stars. I don't give out too many three stars usually so I honestly don't know whether I like it or not. One thing is obvious - their cheesecakes are awesome. I probably go here for just that. But that's what they're meant to be good at anyway.  What I don't understand is this - why the wait? I mean, the food is not THAT great that people are lining their asses up here for 1-2 hr waits even on weekdays. Maybe its a tourist thing, I don't know. Having said that, I do like some of their dishes - pasta and grilled chicken medallions. Those are definitely worth trying if you do plan on going here. Alcohol selection is pretty much like any other restaurant of its type. Recommendation - try it if you've never been here and decide for yourself."
Beck N.,"Roxbury, MA",31,280,86,3.0,8/26/2007,"Not impressed.  For the size of the place (it took me forever to find the bathroom & I asked 4 people), the wait is usually more than a decade on the weekends.  Luckily, this past Friday we were seated almost immediately.  Our waitress was friendly & brought our drinks quickly, though when we were not ready to order (I was having a hard time finding something I wanted even with their magazine menu), she took off for about another 10-15 mins.   I got the chicken medallions & while they were pretty good, it didn't taste any better than something I could have made at home.  T, on the other hand, got the meatloaf.  Now, if you are trying to eat a 2,000 calorie meal, the meatloaf is the way to go -- it is HUGE... I asked him how it was & he told me that my meatloaf was better.  So, I tried a piece -- crunchy.   Since when is meatloaf supposed to be crunchy?!  & then it only tasted like stuffing... not so much meat. In any event, I've been here quite a few times & still feel like something is lacking.  I guess it would be a good night out for drinks or cheesecake."
Mara M.,"Boston, MA",4,26,,1.0,7/24/2007,"Ok the bad reviewers have said it all: The long wait, the huge portions (thats not a good thing), ridiculous prices, pieces of cheesecake that are so huge and gross that they should be illegal and this restaurant should be brought before a judge for feeding the obesity epidemic. I have had two awful experiences:  1.  Friends took me here for the amazing ceasar salad (a BUCKET of lettuce drenched in what was absolutely NOT caesar dressing) and my friend ordered three watery cocktails which cost her close to my life savings.  2. I dont want to go into details but it was the WORST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD!  I dont think any eggs were harmed in the making of it. Another thing that sucks about the C.F:   the clientele - stupid high school age boys who take girls there for a ""nice dinner"" (the same goes for inexperienced gay men) and disgusting, white trash tourist families whose taste in food is as bad as their taste in clothes. Next time someone suggests the cheesecake factory I am going to FLAT-OUT REFUSE even if that person is my future husband's mother, a potential employer, the Pope, the Queen of England, Angelina Jolie or Lord Voldemort under threat of the Cruciatus Curse. NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS!!!!!!!"
Johnny L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",3,13,32,4.0,2/16/2010,"My friend and I went their on last Thursday, and there were so many people waiting for seats. I ordered a Kobe burger and a original cheese cake . The burger was ok, and next time  I probably won't order that again. But the cake was so GREAT!! Their service was very nice at that night. I will come here again!"
Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",667,1217,63,4.0,8/7/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory is so great.  With a menu the size of a book, it's bound to please everybody.  The portions are huge, so it's a great value.  My favorite thing is the jambalaya pasta - so tasty!"
Mandy L.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,5,,3.0,2/28/2008,"This particular location is hit or miss. Of course, the food is exactly the same at every location of this chain (that is, good salads, good avocado eggrolls, cheesecake [duh]), but the service is fairly erratic. I recently went there for a friend's birthday, but the service was notably bad. The server shouted over us to get our attention, he didn't check on us during our meal (except to take our plates away in a hurry), and he served us our dessert in to-go boxes so that he ""didn't have to go back to the kitchen and pack up everything.""  I didn't understand why he was rushing us out, considering the place was pretty hopping when we left at 11:30. Needless to say, I will not be having any birthday dinners there. Maybe Cambridgeside would be better?"
Stephanie L.,"Cambridge, MA",13,104,,4.0,1/24/2010,"I love Cheesecake Factory! As mentioned in previous reviews, the portions are huge, there is a good variety of food, and the cheesecake for dessert literally ""takes the cake"" - it is so delicious. This location gets one star docked because of the very long waits around 6pm every night, despite its large size. If you have a party larger than four, I definitely recommend you go at an off-hour, i.e. at 5pm."
Natasha D.,"Seattle, WA",6,53,,2.0,8/19/2008,"My old roommate and I used to come here at least twice a month for dinner. She's picky and could always count on the Pasta da Vinci to satisfy her. The buffalo blasts are delicious, even if they're a heart attack on a plate. I've also had their crab cakes and French country salad multiple times, both of which are good. The martinis here are good, if a little weak. On the other hand, don't waste your time for brunch. The aforementioned roommate and I came here a couple of weekends ago and I will never go back. I ordered a bloody mary, and waited about 7 minutes (as a waitress, that's a VERY long time to wait for a drink) for her to come back, only to inform me that they don't serve booze until noon. That's not her fault, but wouldn't you think she'd know that when I ordered it? It wasn't busy, so it's not like she was ""weeded"" and had other things to do. My eggs benedict were cold, the hollandaise sauce flavorless. However, I couldn't have sent it back even if I were that bitchy because we weren't checked on until our silverware was stacked neatly on our plates and ready for lift-off. Jackie had steak and eggs, which she swears is good, but tasted chewy and over-marinated to me.  I'll be back for dinner when I'm in need of easy comfort food, but for brunch, I'll head across the street to cheaper, better Thornton's."
Nicole D.,"Ramona, CA",0,8,,3.0,3/14/2013,"I love the oak modern family style of CF. However, it's a little overpriced and the service is so so."
Ali S.,"New York, NY",27,53,,3.0,9/24/2007,"I see a lot of mixed reviews for Cheesecake, and I can understand why. On the one hand, for the same price there are so many other more charming & interesting restaurants to try, but on the other hand Cheesecake factory's food is a pretty sure bet.  Good selection and good (but not great) food.    Ambiance is definitely lacking.  Something about the design of the restaurant always conjures up images of the Disney movie Aladin-weird.  And the place does make you feel like you are in a factory- huge capacity, insane waits, very noisy.   I can't help but feel everything in this restaurant is some how a product of some corporate boardroom somewhere- feels kinda sterile.   As for the food: It is pretty good for a chain restaurant- surprisingly expensive for what it is.  If you are more adventurous you can definitely find far more flavor and ambiance everywhere in Boston.   They make a pretty good chicken Madeira which is nice because its kind of a surprisingly uncommon dish.   ...Oh yeah,... and the cheesecake...I guess its good, but overrated.  I am more of a cupcake person : )!"
Beth K.,"Arlington, VA",0,5,,1.0,3/22/2010,"The reason I am only giving one star is to serve as a warning for all customers of the Back Bay Cheesecake Factory!  My daughter was eating at this location on Sunday night, 21/3/10, and had her purse stolen within 7-10 minutes.  Her seat was not in plain view of other diners  nor did diners pass her chair very often.  There were more employees walking by her table than anyone.  In the end, after much panic, the kind manager offered her free cheesecake.  Now that was like salt in the wounds.  He did help her look for her purse, but I believe the restaurant at the very least should have taken her food off the bill!"
Charles S.,"Cambridge, MA",5,30,,2.0,1/28/2010,"I can forgive any restaurant for a one-off bad meal.  It makes no sense to torpedo a place because the waitress or the cook was having a bad night. But I've eaten here a handful of times now, and there's a consistent problem.  The vegetables in the salads are never fresh.  The lettuce tastes like fridge.  The chicken is over-cooked, almost like it was cooked once and then reheated.  Awful.  Just awful.  The cheesecake is great, however.  That's the only thing keeping this place out of one-star territory."
Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",5,34,,4.0,12/3/2010,Delicious food! I'm a huge fan of the Factory Nachos!! Huge portions! I try to split a meal with another person because the portions are just out of control. The only downside is they change the menu!! They had a maple glazed pork tenderloin on the menu that was amazing but they removed it from the menu -- I hate when restaurants do that!! But everything always comes out hot and delicious. Ohh and the pumpkin cheesecake or Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake are definitely worth trying.
Ally W.,"Boston, MA",6,22,,1.0,11/2/2011,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory because they have a great menu.  I can find any dish to satisfy my carving that day.  But this Cheesecake Factory has messed up my order numerous times before.  I had a tough time eating the pasta because it was extremely salty.  They messed up the pasta again when I sent it back to the kitchen for another plate.  My friend found a receipt in his sherry temple so we questioned if they even washed the cups before.  The manager did not seem to acknowledge the problems when we spoke to him; however, he did comp the sherry temple.  I would not give this place another chance.  Highly disappointed..."
Liana K.,"Malden, MA",229,418,72,2.0,4/29/2008,"The food is definetly not worth the price.   I will admit that the cheesecake is good (esp peanut butter one)  & i love their drinks, but for dinner I'd go somewhere else first."
Amanda L.,"Brighton, MA",218,738,28,3.0,12/12/2007,"Where do I even begin? One look at the menu and you think you were looking in a magazine.  The last thing I want to do when I'm hungry is look at ads for a $10,000 ring that I know I can't afford. What's good about Cheesecake is that it has everything. What's bad about Cheesecake is that it has everything. It's hard to have a menu that has so many different items on it and be good overall.  There are some awesome items on the menu (I love the grilled cheese and the mac and cheese balls) but some of the items are quite mediocre.  A lot of people don't realize it's a chain restaurant, because it kind of doesn't look like one.   I've never had drinks there, but they do have a bar special (Can't remember times though...) were apps are like $1.00 or something. Otherwise, it's kind of overly price, and while the dishes are big, doesn't mean they are good/flavorful. However... I LOVE cheesecake, and every time I walk by their counter I start drooling.  They have amazing cheesecake, I don't care, I love it, it's amazing, I would eat it all the time if it wouldn't turn my into a 500lb cow.   But otherwise, it's meh."
