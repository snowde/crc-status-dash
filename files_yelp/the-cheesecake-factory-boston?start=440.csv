Klaudia K.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,2.0,2/26/2012,"While the food at the Back Bay Cheesecake Factory lives up to the name of the restaurant chain, the service is appalling. The wait took an hour and a half and came with much confusion regarding the seating arrangement (we were a party of 11.) The waitress was not only rude but also sarcastic towards the people in our party. She made the atmosphere unwelcoming and made everyone feel rushed. The belligerence was greatly unappreciated. Overall, I would not recommend anyone going to this Back Bay Cheesecake Factory unless they would be willing to put up with the egotism and ignorance of a cantankerous waitress named Jessica K."
Angela L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",69,7,,3.0,8/10/2012,"This is my high school group's go to place for birthdays. Since there's always a birthday in the group every month or two, I've been here a lot in the last two years. It's a great place for bday dinners because there's a variety of choices and large portions so everyone's somewhat happy, there's singing and to top it all off, THERE'S DELICIOUS CHEESECAKE! The appetizers and entrees are not that great. I've tried a different entree each time and was unimpressed each time. Food is decent, but never mouthwatering. The cheesecake is definitely the best part of the meal. The service is also great and the environment is perfect for chatting."
Jay T.,"Austin, TX",5,21,,1.0,9/23/2007,"Big portions of disgusting food! Hooray! The place is ugly, the food is gross, the patrons are gross... All in all, a really gross place. I'm feeling a bit nauseous just thinking about it. I had the shrimp scampi. Pasta was a good bit beyond al dente, and definitely not cooked to order. Shrimp was a little overdone and somewhat bland, and the breading was just nasty. I took the breading off and just ate the shrimp. Dessert was definitely the best part, but really nothing to write home about. I had some kind of layered chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cake and brownie thing. The decor kind of put me off. I had trouble pinning down exactly what they were going for. My guess would be ""ugly."" Don't go."
Jillian Y.,"Berlin, Germany",69,301,10,4.0,3/15/2008,"For a chain, Cheesecake Factory is a no-brainer.  This location is great - it's huge, and sooo much better than the Cambridgeside one.  That said, for a name like ""cheesecake factory,"" you'd think their simple strawberry cheesecake would be good...nope.  My dinner was great, my beer was great, my server was great, but the cheesecake was LAME. Try the bistro shrimp pasta though, yum!"
Victoria N.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,6,1.0,4/12/2009,"I seriously do not get the hype surrounding Cheesecake. What's the big deal?? Everyone goes here, for every occasion imaginable. Tourists who probably have Cheesecake back home come here. Whyyy?? You're in a new city, so explore the exciting dining options the city has to offer! So why did I find myself waiting over an hour for a table here? Because I happened to have a gift card--a prize for a cooking competition I won that was sponsored by the school. Long story short, we were told that there was no balance left on the card and that it was bought at a grocery store rather than at a location. They called the number on the back, and apparently the card was never scanned, pretty much implying that it had been stolen. They couldn't do anything without a receipt, so I ended up having to foot the bill when I would never even had gone in the first place if it weren't for the gift card. Yes, of course I know that this is not the fault of Cheesecake Factory. I just thought it'd be a good story to share. :} Although you can imagine how that just topped off our night of disappointment.... So the service wasn't bad, and they handled the above pretty well. But reviewers are on point when they mention the fake smiles and niceties of the people working there. When our waiter came by once, I said we were debating between these two appetizers, clearing expecting a recommendation, but he just waved us off with a 'I'll just give you more time.' Other than that, it was aight. On to the food/drinks...here is what we got in order of tastiness: - Pomegranate Mojito: tasty goodness, although lacking in alcohol for such a large glass. Price wasn't bad for what you get, though. - Beets with Goat Cheese (under their 'small plates' menu): description says 'fresh beets, apples, baby arugula, and pecans.' It was tasty, but maybe they're hinting at something by not putting goat cheese in the description...? - Strawberry Creamsicle: tasty like a shake, but again lacking in alcohol for such a large glass. - Bread: definitely better warm, as I've had in the past. - Fries: comparable to McDonald's fries. You can take that however you want to. - Sliders: thin pieces of meat not even formed into patties; obvious they were just scrapped together from a larger patty. - Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake: I swear the size of their cheesecake slices have gotten smaller over the years. So chocolate coconut cream sounded really good to me, but maybe I should've assumed there would be coconut flakes even if they weren't in the description. I love coconut and coconut flavor, but I hate those nasty little flakes. - The Navajo sandwich: we were debating between this and the sliders or just the beef ribs...boy do I wish we had gone with the beef ribs. I'm a sucker for variety though, and having two dishes instead of one somewhat appealed to me more at the time. The dry and tasteless chicken was the worst part, and the sandwich as a whole was really nothing special.  All in all, the food sucked. We should've just stuck with drinks and maybe another small plate. So we all know how long and inefficient their menu is, but I think the biggest annoyance was not having prices listed under the cocktail section. I had to pick out the ones I wanted so the waiter could ask the bar, and it's not like I'm going to do the same with each one until I found one with a suitable price... Maybe they should stop taking ads for their menu to make room for listing the prices for everything. Including the cheesecakes, since all they have now is a range of what it might be. I felt like I was flipping through a program booklet rather than a restaurant menu. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I just had two leftover sliders that were much tastier broiled with cheddar cheese, toasted bun-tops, and ketchup/fancy mustard, washed down with a glass of wine. Can't say the same for the fries, but that's to be expected with leftover fries. I also just had a few bites of the cheesecake, and guess what I found? A nice, long strand of hair sticking out of it. Gross."
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,5.0,1/25/2006,"This place can have QUITE the wait so be prepared. The food is delicious but try to save room for the dessert, clearly. Order the avocado eggrolls and you won't be disappointed. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich lives up to its name. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is mine too. The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is too scrumptous for words. Can you tell I go here a lot? I always assumed this place would have so-so food and amazing cheesecake but everything about it is good. That's probably why the line is out the door!"
Steph M.,"New Hope, PA",2,35,,1.0,9/16/2009,"I am not a fan.  Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant that tries to be everything and therefore specializes in nothing well (except cheesecake).  The meals are mass produced, mass quantities of very low quality cuisine.  There are so many other (and better) restaurants on the area - it is totally not worth the 2 hour wait to eat at a place that actually feels like a factory."
E C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,,5.0,10/8/2012,"A lot of food. Great value. If you can beat the crowds, it's a lot of fun. Staff is terrific and it's very kid friendly. Giant menu, so there will be something for everyone"
Sandra C.,"San Mateo, CA",24,165,128,5.0,7/2/2005,"You'll have something to please everyone here.  Wide selection.  Their cheesecake is of course, a big draw, but I love their appetizers especially their avocado egg rolls."
ChianWen T.,"Boston, MA",3,194,15,3.0,9/27/2009,"Somewhere along the way of becoming a city girl, I have lost appreciation  for the Cheesecake Factory.  There was a time when I would drive 4 hours from Ann Arbor to Chicago just for a slice.  Today, they are not worth the normal expected 2 hour wait,  even their cheesecakes are not so paradisial to me anymore.   The Cheesecake Factory to me today is what the Old Country Buffet was 10 years ago.   You get a lot of food for the money but before you are even finish with the meal you are grossed out enough to say, ""I ain't never coming back.""  But you will. Trust me, you will.  For the convenience,  for the good memory that is no longer, you will."
Kev H.,"Boston, MA",6,62,,3.0,4/11/2010,"Okay, this place deserves a solid 3 stars. The restaurant is overhyped to the max thats for one and although the portions are pretty good, the price is decent, but the major drawbacks is the food itself, huge heaping helpings (try saying that 5 times fast) of salt on your beef isn't exactly what someone would  want, maybe its just me, but in the several times I've visited this place I ordered something new, but there always seemed to be an excess amount of salt or sauce or what ever you want to call it. Maybe the portions are huge for everything even seasoning."
Geoff T.,"Somerville, MA",9,212,,3.0,8/12/2005,"Holy expensive, Batman! It's pre-fab food. What else do I have to say? It's not bad, some of it is even pretty good, but if I'm going to lay down some cash for a night out, it's going to be at an independent place where they take time and love with their food. The Cheesecake of its name sake can't really be messed with, I will admit. Good stuff. Stop by for dessert sometime, but go to some small five table place in the North End to spend your money."
Melissa H.,"New York, NY",42,203,2,2.0,5/11/2007,"Okay.. I go to Culinary School so maybe I'm a bit of a food snob. But I can appreciate certain chains and this one just doesn't do it for me. Their salads are HUGE and not that bad - but you can never finish all of it and I for one hate to eat leftover salad.. blegh. I've had chicken from here once and it was really rubbery, kind of reminded me of ""fake chicken"", it was just gross and chewy. The only things I like are the appetizers, really. And the chicken tacos aren't that bad. But when I walk out of here I just feel gross.. the food is so heavy and my body isn't used to eating like that. But if you want huge portions and just an easy place to go, I guess this isn't a bad place. But it's really not worth the long wait at all."
Eva A.,"Boston, MA",14,6,5,5.0,7/25/2009,I have been here three times. I really like the food. The environment is really nice. It is very luxurious without the having to dress fancy. I like the staff there too.  Always friendly and great at recommending a meal.  It's great to go with a group of friends to help split the bill if you are on a budget.  It is also nice to go with your significant other for a special occasion. Lunch time is always hectic. I find that of you go before noon you will get seated right away. The food is always fresh and delicious.  Let's not forget the dessert. I always take it home. I can never finish my entire meal but I do look forward to going here. It's great!!!!
Ellie V.,"Quincy, MA",1,38,13,1.0,3/23/2012,"The first time I came here, I LOVED it, but the more I go the less I like it. The first time I came, I ordered the petite fillet, and unlike other places my steak wasn't burnt for once. It was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the fetucinni alfredo and he loved it.. We also ordered crispy crab bites for an opening. It was good, but I think six gum ball sized pieces were served. The waiter was extreme friendly. Second time, we ordered same thing but with the avocado rolls or whatever as an opening. My steak was burnt and the avocado rolls had no taste. The waiter wasn't so friendly either. Then third time, I came with a group of friends for a friends birthday. Two people ordered pasta from the lunch since we came during lunch time but the waiter gave us a dinner plate. We didnt know so when the bill came we had to pay for more than we originally ordered. The waiter should have asked us if we wanted the dinner or lunch serving. I do not plan on coming back anymore."
Simon L.,"Portland, ME",198,67,11,3.0,7/24/2007,"I really do like the Cheesecake Factory, but this one is a little too big for it's britches.   There is never less than a half-hour wait for a seat, and they have lost or delayed pick-up orders the last two times I ordered from them, with no offer of a gift certificate or anything to compensate: the manager just left me standing in the entryway. The food's good, yeah, but why so much plastic?"
Theresa J.,"Malden, MA",204,287,9,4.0,8/23/2009,"I'm not embarrassed at all to say I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to 3 different locations and I have loved them all.  My gf who is not an adventurous eater by far was visiting me from out of town and this is where we finally decided to go after a long discussion.  We are both greedy as ever so even though they have gargantuan portions we both ordered an app and an entree and dessert.  I did not say we ate it all I just said we ordered it......lol.  I had the vietnamese summer rolls, the caramel chicken, and the red velvet cheesecake.  She had the boston salad, jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp, and the key lime cheesecake.  We both enjoyed our food.  My only issue was the server was from space.  He messed up my drink order, never refilled my drink without being asked, and he was just generally not so great as a server.  Other than that it was a good experience."
Brady B.,"Dorchester, MA",311,209,5,4.0,3/18/2009,"I really can't knock this place. Yes, it is a chain and it can draw an obnoxious crowd. However, I have eaten here several times over the years....mainly when I have townies in for a visit (""can we go to the cheesecake factory? I love it there!"") or when my sister's in town with the kids. My 8 year old niece, who at her age is already a foodie like her uncle God love her ordered the mac and cheese here last summer. When I asked her how it was she answered ""the best I ever had!"". She wasn't kidding, I had a bite and it was delicious! Granted, it's not my first choice by far for a restaurant, but I can honestly say that for a chain I really do like this place."
Erica T.,"Boston, MA",120,144,58,4.0,11/18/2008,"This is where I go for a girlie date. We each order an appetizer and split everything (1 drink and one app and tip = about $20 per person). And, surprisingly, they make some pretty fantastic drinks. Granted, I rarely ever order cheesecake as the portions are so huge, it'd have to be a separate ""We're just here for the cheesecake, ma'am."" It does get a little crowded but I don't mind, we usually go at off times anyways :)"
Stephanie B.,"Medfield, MA",3,27,2,2.0,1/29/2008,"From the moment we arrived it was crazy.  The hosts didn't know to give us a beeper or just ask us to stand aside.  We we asked how long it would be one host said 5 minutes the other said 20 minutes.  So after 10 minutes we were taken to our table.   The server was friendly, but not outstanding.  He has to kneel down to take our order because the noise was so loud in the place. Our meals were so so.  Nothing much to write home about.  I would only go back to this place if there was no other place to go."
