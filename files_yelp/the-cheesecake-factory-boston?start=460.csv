Olayemi A.,"New York, NY",18,38,2,4.0,3/23/2009,"When I went with a large group for my roommates birthday, I was less than pleased with the wait.  Even after finally getting called up, we still were left standing around for 15 mins until we could actually be seated.  Why call us up if we still can't be seated?  But fine, whatever.  We get seated and I like the decor, it seems really fancy when really if you think about it, its just a classier Applebee's with better desserts.  I like the free bread and butter too. I found the prices surprisingly reasonable.  I was expecting a lot of $16 dollar platters or something but there were a lot of reasonably priced tasty entrees availible.  I ended up getting  a bbq onion ring burger with fries.  For only 10.95 and the serving was large.  I ended up having leftovers, which I ended up not even eating.  The big whopper came with my drink however (a tasty raspberry lemonade).  I knew something was up when the prices for the drinks weren't listed on the menu.  But I figured hey, how much could it be.  When I got my bill, WHOA.  My drink was a whopping 5 bucks! $4.95 to be exact.  And yes while the serving was large and there are free refills, I still find that excessive when places like Applebee's have similar, great tasting drinks for half the price and free refills too.   All in all, a great place to go on a date or with friends.  The food is good, the prices are reasonable (minus the drinks and cheesecake..then again their cheesecake is amazing) and the ambiance makes for a great night out.  4 stars =)"

Benjamin D.,"Boston, MA",167,30,5,4.0,1/9/2010,"Went to Cheesecake factory with my parents (dropping me off at college for the spring).  I'm a big fan of their burgers, so I tried the Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich with Chipotle Mayo.  Major good idea."
Eric G.,"Morgantown, WV",20,6,,2.0,7/15/2012,"Really let down by this place.  Girlfriend had the Chicken Alfredo, and the garlic was completely overpowering.  I had the Chicken Marsala, and it completely lacked flavor, except of course for the garlic.  I love garlic, but too much, is too much.  I suggest eating cheesecake only, and leave the Italian food to Italian restaurants."
Megan M.,"Ashland, MA",33,146,28,3.0,4/13/2007,"Wow, some long reviews for this place!  Overall, I like TCF. It's a good place to go for lunch, their menu is ridiculously long. But that works for me, as I'm someone who likes options. Lots and lots of options. I just need to narrow it down a bit before I go, or else I'll wind up sitting there for a while.  Portions are ginormous, to fit in with their ""BIG"" theme. Huge restaurant, huge menu, might as well go with huge portions. I can easily make another meal, if not 2, out of my leftovers.  I usually favor the Symphony Salad for lunch, maybe an app of calamari or the lettuce wraps. And then there's the cheesecake. Yum. So many options, so little time.  While I don't necessarily crave TCF, I have no doubt I'll be back again."
Bob B.,"Medford, MA",3,48,4,5.0,1/31/2012,"I don't expect to give such good reviews of a chain like Cheesecake Factory but I had one hell of a good meal and the service was excellent.  It was a slow night so we didn't have to wait for a table.   I got the Louisiana Chicken and Pasta and it was outrageously good!  She had another chicken dish that was good.  The drinks were well made.   Wow, good job!"
Adam C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,,1.0,8/14/2012,"My girlfriend and I used to go here all the time. Probably spent a few hundred dollars in a semester at this particular restaurant. That all changed when one night our server brought out my girlfriend's food cold. She mentioned that the pasta was cold, so the server said she'd go have them reheat it. Seems easy enough. She brought it back, and we asked her for some more water and some olive oil for the bread. What happened next baffled both of us. She turned to my girlfriend, who is black and had been making the requests, and said: ""Who do you think you are, you n****r b***h?"" Stop the presses. Needless to say we went and complained, and the manager of the restaurant started crying about it. They gave us the meal for free, which we had no intention of finishing, and offered us a variety of gift cards in various amounts, which as nice as it was, felt a lot like trying to buy some quiet out of us, especially as they raised the amounts each time we said no. I don't know what it was that caused our now-fired server to burst like that, as I don't think our requests were unreasonable, but whatever it was, neither of us want to go to a restaurant where servers hurl racial slurs and profanities at you. They lost some good customers in us, and other customers be warned that the servers here may turn your enjoyable date into something much worse."
Ellen L.,"Shrewsbury, MA",34,241,,2.0,9/21/2009,"I give cheesecake factories in general a three.  this location was sub par.  i went during the lunch hour, and it's definitely not a surprise that it was completely empty inside.  There were literally 2 other tables at the peak of the lunch hour on a weekday.  wtf?  the service was mediocre...."
Brett H.,"Boston, MA",0,16,,2.0,5/13/2012,"The food is what it is, but I'm consistently surprised by the lack of customer service. It's so conveniently located that I keep getting talked into going back, but the servers, hosts, et al never seem especially interested in being nice or getting the orders right."
David V.,"Randolph, MA",18,328,318,4.0,11/8/2009,Every time we come here we are always impressed at how delicious the food is and how quickly it arrives.  We love to get a good bang for our buck and this place always gives us plenty to eat and some for later (leftovers!).  My wife loves the orange chicken and the chicken littles...my absolute favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake!  We love their low priced bar menu.  Be sure to arrive early because this place fills up quick and as you probably already know...they don't take reservations.
Cinful B.,"Boston, MA",4,15,,3.0,1/23/2012,"The place looks great which is always the case at the Cheesecake Factory, which is why they got two stars. The staff seemed nice and are pretty attentive considering it was kinda busy. I went there a few times I can say nothing really stands out for me as far as the food was concerned. This last time had to be the worse. We got Shepard's pie.. yuk. It was like a mushroom and pea beef stew with a lump of mash potatoes on top. Honestly it didn't look good but we tried to eat it anyways.. It tasted like it looked.. greasy. We also ordered fish tacos they fell apart upon arrival and neither of us could enjoy those either. The small plates and apps were awesome, chicken croquettes, stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, we reordered some to replace the dinner. The waiter ask if we wanted things wrapped up since the plates were full NO way we replied. He must have told the manager because he came over to hear our complaints and refunded for the two bad meals. We got two pieces of cake to go they were great. and because they at lease tried to fix the issue I am gonna change it to three stars for the recovery ;)"
Brendan R.,"Boston, MA",79,6,,1.0,11/6/2011,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Chestnut Hill MA and always had a great experience. Sadly the restaurant in the city at the Prudential was nothing like your other locations. During Sunday brunch, we had the waiter stop by our table about 3 times total - got no bread even though we asked for some, had to ask a bus boy to refill our waters, never got our dirty plates from our appetizers taken away. On top of the bad service, my dining companion's food came with hairs all over the side of the pasta dish - the server asked, annoyed, ""do you want me to take it back? It's just on the side, not the actual food, so I wouldn't send it back"" - so what are we supposed to say to that. Then, we noticed the chicken in the pasta was bright pink! Seriously? I couldn't believe it. We nicely pulled our server aside and explained the problem and he apologized, but no offer for a different dish, no offer to comp that dish. I've never gotten the check and ran out of a restaurant so quickly. My boyfriend, who had the chicken dish, felt sick the rest of the day. I'm just happy he wasn't more sick after eating that chicken. And all these problems for a $50 + tip meal? I won't be returning. So many other choices in the area for that price."
Sithembile X.,"Brookline, MA",11,5,,4.0,8/11/2009,I have been going to this cheesecake Factory since I moved to MA in 1999. I have spent numerous birthdays and other celebrations and the menu never gets old. My favorite dish is the Spicey Cashew chicken and the Godiva Chocolate for dessert! Of course I cant go home without the Sour apple Martini! Def a great place to celebrate any occasion.
CHRISTINE F.,"Worcester, MA",0,4,,1.0,7/6/2008,"wow - factory is right, and not a well-run one. I telephoned the day before to reserve a table for 8 for a business lunch. I specified that we had only one hour and asked if that was a problem. I was assured it was not and to simply let my server know. So I asked the group to look at the menu online so we could order right away. Alas, upon arrival I was told that the table would be set up. 15 minutes later it was. (What is the point of reserving then?)The waiter disappeared after the drink order and long story short, the lunch finally arrived 50 minutes after we did. So 2 of us with meetings had to ask the others to bring our salads back and had to leave without food. Of those who remained, one had the wrong salad altogether and had to wait again. While there are obviously many tourists and shoppers at the Pru, I'd think that they were also accustomed to the business crowd in Back Bay but apparently this is a suburban family restaurant that happens to be in the city. Definitely NOT a place for business people."
Bulba S.,"Cambridge, MA",19,48,,4.0,8/15/2008,"I guess I'd consider this a guilty pleasure. I certainly don't come here often; there's a long wait, and the prices are very high. The entrees are of gargantuan proportions, which, depending on who you are, can be a pro or a con. For me, it's a con, because I tend to finish what's on my plate, and then I just leave feeling kind of ill after engorging myself with appetizers, an entree, and cheesecake - even if all of these are split between multiple people. But still, this is a nice place to meet with friends for a reunion or something. That's usually what I end up coming for, which makes the long wait okay - time to catch up with one another's lives and wander the Pru. And the food is delicious, everything I've had here has tasted simply amazing. Okay, so the lack of nutrition facts anywhere is a little skeezy - I do like my restaurants to provide a general idea of wtf I'm filling myself up with, but honestly, when I'm gobbling down my $6 piece of cheesecake, I do not care."
sean w.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,8,,3.0,4/11/2008,the food here is whatever... alot of it anyway. they do have some true gems on this menu though. i would recommend: avocado eggrolls shrimp summer rolls guacamole app.(made to order and very good) french country salad chopped salad pear and endive salad seared tuna tataki salad(maybe the best thing they have) they have some good pizzas too mesa chicken  beef ribs some of the fish selections garlic noodles rigatoni putanesca chicken salad sandwich cuban sandwich(nothing like the real thing but still not bad) and a few other things if you crave desserts then this place will definitely take care of it for you... chocolate tower truffle cake godiva cheesecake banana cheesecake lemon raspberry cheesecake traditional tiramisu stay away from the carrot cake and the strawberry shortcake which seem to be so popular... unless you truly do not give a fuck about yourself. the carrot cake weights in at a wopping 1800 calories and the short cake not to far behind it isnt very hard to have a full meal here and reach the 4000 calorie mark..so watch it. and also... first of all the meals are not prepared at some off site location and shipped in to be reheated. in fact the only things that come in frozen are the pea and carrot mix that goes into the mexican rice the french fries which are made from frozen mashed potatoes and the cheesecakes. everything else is made to order and fresh. if the food seems to be  what ever it is because of the volume of the store and rate at which they crank out these meals.  if you have severe food allergies then you run the risk of a reaction almost anywhere you go.chances are you will have to wait a bit before you get a table... this is a perfect time to talk to a manager or a kitchen manager about your allergy and what to avoid instead of asking a server  who only gets paid $2.63 and hour and doesnt know a damn thing about the food production. if you have ever felt rushed out of someplace late at night maybe it is because you decided to go out to eat right before a restaurant closed. no one wants you there. the servers just want to clean up and get the fuck out or maybe try and catch the last train to avoid having to pay for a cab ride home instead of having to wait on some creepy same side sitters(people that sit next to eachother instead of across when eating) who thought it was a good idea to have a full service meal at 11:55pm on a tuesday. there is a time and place for everything... even for the cheesecake factory. enjoy
Joseph D.,"Boston, MA",2,14,,5.0,9/5/2011,"Review is purely for their cheesecake. Unbelievable! Definitely get a whole one to-go. They are affordable, though they don't have all flavors for the full cakes. Godiva was surprisingly delicious despite the plain appearance and oreo is my favorite. Red velvet disappointed me."
Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,617,238,4.0,3/30/2007,"Surprisingly good food for such a commercial chain. Their cheesecakes are decadant and delightful. Always worth the calories and fat. Try as many flavors as possible, you'll almost never go wrong. Their portions are massive and it's almost always better to share. I love their rye bread, YUMMYYYYY! Oh, and their drinks.... Pricey but excellent, and so STRONG. I think I was pretty buzzed after one of their over-sized margaritas. I recommend the cobb salad and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and, of course, the margaritas."
Justine D.,"Somerville, MA",14,93,,2.0,5/31/2008,"I think this place is extremely overrated.  None of their food seems all that fabulous to me, they always serve way too much of it (so I guess if you like eating massive quantities you'd like it) and the line to get in is always ridiculous.  It's somewhat pricey, too.   There are so many awesome, independent restaurants in Boston that are far more worthwhile eating at than the Cheesecake Factory."
Richard G.,"Santa Clara, CA",20,292,134,3.0,2/26/2006,"Food was overpriced, but still good. The wait is a bitch though (but isnt it always at TCF) The cheesecake is decadent."
