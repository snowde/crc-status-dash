Kristina G.,"Boston, MA",14,80,1,2.0,2/28/2006,"Why reservations are not accepted at this place is beyond me.  The wait to be seated here is pretty intense for food that just isn't up to par and is overpriced.  Save your time - time is worth more than money.  So by eating here, not only do you waste money, you waste time.  And that's a lot of wasting."
Denise M.,"Suffolk, MA",1,21,,4.0,9/23/2009,"I make it a point to eat here only from 4 PM - 6 PM on weekdays, because that's when they have the discounted bar menu ($3.50 - $5.95) per order. Also, there is very rarely a wait during this time. I usually order the *Chopped Salad* and another item off either the *Bar Menu* or the *Small Plates* menu. I've never been disappointed when I've ordered off those menus. The reason that I'm not giving them a 5 star review is because I really don't like eating here during regular eating hours; there are excessively long waits and too large portions. While the food quality is good, I don't particularly like paying for an entree only to have to take home half of it because I can't finish it. I would prefer if they had small portion options all the time, instead of just between 4 and 6 PM."
Miguel D.,"Roxbury, MA",3,37,2,5.0,10/29/2006,This place is great..I've only been there once but its still great. I had the teriyaki chicken and the portion was insane. The drinking glasses where huge. My mouth is watering now mmmm.....Well i think I should head out now. Enjoy and remember chew twice once for you and one for me !!!!
Nicole B.,"New York, NY",64,377,,4.0,4/29/2008,"i'm puzzled by the negative reviews. i like it here. granted i'm not going to wait for hours for a seat, nor would this be one of my top suggestions for a night out. however, if i so happen to end up here it's all good! the goulash here is comparable with my grandmothers and with the goulash i've had in the czech republic and poland. it's not as good as all those but it's up there and that says a lot (shh don't tell my grandmother!). the cheesecake is very yummy. it's no new york cheese cake but they got some good flavors. the menu is expansive, the service has always been great. and there's something to please everyone here. like i said before, it's not my number one, but it's not the last on my last either."
Iska B.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,521,35,4.0,11/21/2006,What's not to love here? There is a big menu and of course for dessert you have so many cheesecakes to choose from. The food is a bit expensive but nothing horrible and the portions are large so it feels worth it. The drinks were also to my liking with some unique cocktails. Good place for a date or just going with friends after a long day shopping. Even better just for dessert. Expect a long wait on Friday and Saturday though unless you go early.
reese w.,"San Francisco, CA",127,350,102,3.0,3/25/2006,"I think the food is terribly overpriced for what you get. I have definitely had better cheesecake and entrees elsewhere, but it is a nice place to go with friends. As many other reviewers mentioned, you should expect a wait if you go during a busy time. I think the waitstaff really do try to please the customers, and rushing people in and out of the restaurant is not one of their policies. I have never had a problem with a server trying to push us out the door."
Kathleen P.,"Boston, MA",68,127,,4.0,4/12/2006,"It's not a bad place, but there is always a big line, and I don't think the food is really worth a long wait. I do like going there though because there are lots of choices and big portions. I still haven't tried a piece of cheesecake from here yet. I know, what is my problem? But I am usually too full to comprehend eating anything else, and I never bother getting it to go. I need to try the cheesecake though, it looks really good."
Ashley J.,"Roslindale, MA",32,209,1,2.0,3/26/2008,There all the same. This is a generic place for people who don't have very high standards for food quality. I have tried and tried to like it here because people always want to eat here but I just can't wait in this kind of line for this blah food. I am generally unimpressed.
Sam S.,"Brookline, MA",77,115,11,4.0,5/7/2006,"I love this place. it's decently priced, has a huge selection, humongous portions, and great food! the only problem is that i NEVER get to eat the cheesecake because i can BARELY get up let alone eat more."
Nick L.,"New York, NY",0,39,,2.0,6/17/2007,"If you're gonna get dinner in the backbay do yourself a favor and go some place that isn't a bougie applebees food is ok, but inconsistent. they have a huge menu, so there will be something for everyone."
Marissa P.,"New York, NY",136,493,17,4.0,4/12/2007,"yeah, seriously, fuck the haters, good food is good food.  and the cheesecake factory is tasty!  i mean, okay, it's not gourmet, but it's not like you always have to be such a gourmand.  i rarely go to the cheesecake factory anymore, but i used to go all the time with an ex b/f, literally, all the time, and we would have such fun waiting in barnes & noble while waiting for our buzzer to go off 'so the wait's really not that bad as long as you are entertained by books or people or other mall things... sometimes their food is kinda salty, too saucy, too sweet.  they are a bit excessive in every which way - portions included!  and most of the cheesecake is wayyy too rich!!! barf. i will say this though, their turkey burger is the best turkey burger i've ever had, without a doubt...  eat it!"
Chris C.,"Boston, MA",2,37,,4.0,5/6/2011,"You cannot go wrong here. They have so many wonderful options of food and dessert. I love their tappas menu and the red velvet cheesecake. Servers are usually friendly and the atmosphere is very lively. Of course there is a wait on a popular night, just have to plan ahead."
Oleana B.,"Boston, MA",0,54,5,2.0,2/20/2013,"I always forget to never come here again. It's a pity because this place has nice sized portions and a great variety but everything is so bad. After a long consideration of the menu I got the burrito. When it arrived, it was the size of 3 normal ones. The size alone grossed me out. The sides it came with were OK. The baked beans, probably from a can were OK, so was the guacamole and the sour cream was fresh. The burrito was totally disgusting. It was filled with steamed rice, really old chicken that was reheated multiple times, what was supposed to be caramelized onions were just burned onions, they were actually black, specks of corn probably from a  can and specks of fried pepper which were OK. It felt like you were eating steamed rice and really old, dry and partially burned chicken. The cheese and salsa was on top of the tortilla instead of being inside, or at least the cheese being inside. I don't claim to be a burrito connoisseur but something felt seriously wrong with the burrito setup compared to what I am used to. Some of the salsa tasted like spoiled tomatoes. The whole dish literally swam in some kind of cheese sauce with green stuff in it. The waiters were nice, however we had to wait 15 minutes for a table and then when our buzzer rang, we had to wait again for a our name to be called to be seated. Another 5-10 minutes. When we came to the seating area there were a lot of open tables. This is my last time at this place."
dan w.,"Allston, MA",11,44,6,3.0,3/20/2006,"I agree with what everyone has to say here.  the place is overrated and slightly pricey.  it is also often overcrowded.  however this is a great place to go for lunch from work for 4 main reasons.  it is not as crowded around 12 so you can usually get right in.  they have a wide variety of sandwiches and burgers you wouldnt normally get if you were there for dinner, they are slightly less pricey and some are verry good.  they have the option of lunch portions on many meals.  im normally not a fan of lunch portions but if youve been to the cheesecake factory you know it is not humanly possible to finish a plate.  the lunch portions are still huge and slightly cheaper.  the last reason it is a great lunch spot is if you are with a lot of people or are not really sure what you want, there is an endless variety of things on the menu"
Carol C.,"Jersey City, NJ",87,55,2,4.0,12/13/2006,"Dude. I freaking love THIS Cheesecake Factory.   Other ones I've been to (Cambridgeside Galleria, ones in Jersey) have been absolutely terrible!! Disgusting service, terrible food, dirty tables, you name it, they messed it up! But there is a light at the end of the Cheesecake Factory tunnel.  And that light is the CF on Hunt Ave.  I've been there about 2 dozen times over the past four years, and maybe 4 experiences have been bad.  For you mathies, 4/24 = 1/6 hits were bad.  The rest were great.  Let's do what I remember of the bad before we do the good. When it was bad: -A couple of times we requested a booth and didn't get it. This situation was remedied, but not without perhaps 10 minutes more of extra waiting time. 95% of the time they get it right. -Sometimes waiters/waitresses are just...crappy at best.  Maybe s/he has had a bad day, maybe s/he is just batshit crazy.  Bad waitstaff is the absolute exception; MOST waitstaff are friendly, informative, attentive, and nice!  On one particualry horrendous visit, we heard one particularly loud and waitress telling the table next to us that she'd be interested in a threesome.  Now, what you do in your personal sex life is none of my business, and frankly I just don't friggin care, but at your place of work is not the place to do it.  We really didn't want to hear this in the middle of our dinner, and it was just gross.  to hear it while she was shaking her loud (and misshapen, i might add haha) ass in front of us.  -They can screw up your order. I want to say 2 out of 5 times they have gotten something minute wrong. See the upside below. -The floors can be slippery. I can't understand this, its gotta be the oil from the kitchen, but yeah. Just be careful.   -The wait WILL SUCK on a weekend, most espcially in the evenings! Be prepared to wait anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours.  You've been warned!! -It can be loud! As all restaurants in Boston, there will be a larger population of college students, and obnoxious people in general.  Not that all college students are loud and obnoxious, but you know how we get when we're in groups stuffing our faces and drinking. We get messy. When it was good! -Friendly, attentive hostess waitstaff that got us everything we needed when or even before we needed it!  -They make amends when they mess up.  They overcooked my friend's burger, he got free dessert.  Its happened a few times.  I think they should get it right on the first shot, but what can you do? -I love their booths. -Everything you could and couldn't want on the massive menu. -The Cheesecake rocks! -I have never once been disappointed in their burgers. They have always been fresh, and over or undercooked they use the best meat I have ever tasted.  They have a variety of cheeses, mushrooms, etc for your picking..tell them to double check the cheese you want if they say they don't have it. Some days they have different ones than others. -Shrimp club was amazing, too. -Breakfast there isn't bad, I remember specifically my homefries were over done, but the omellette and toast were perfect. -I love their honey wheat bread. 80% of the time it is fresh, warm and delicious.  Not bad sourdough, but its not my cup of tea anyway. -My friend has always enjoyed their flavorful Passion Iced Tea.  Not a bad scotch selection either.  Bartenders have been known to be slightly heavy-handed on the alcohol, but hey, what are you drinking for then? (jk!) -They have a huge dessert menu, not just cheesecake! Its not that pricey, around $10 for appetizers, anywhere from $7-27 for entrees, $7 for a slice of cheesecake.  Huge portions, and you won't leave hungry.  Great for medium sized groups."
Shaun G.,"Dorchester, MA",8,57,6,3.0,8/20/2008,"I do not come often, but I think the atmosphere is nice and it is the best out of all the Cheesecake Factories around. I think you do have to study the menu, which is kind of a minus. The desert is the best."
Andy K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",376,1066,199,3.0,6/17/2008,"I always enjoy a stop at a Cheesecake Factory. This one is no different. Huge portions, great flavors, nice staff and delicious cheesecake. Long wait though at this location, about 45 minutes, but since we were in a mall we could shop and walk around with that vibrating alert device."
Jennifer S.,"Salem, MA",110,103,1,3.0,2/20/2006,"The wait will leave a bad taste in your mouth long after you have sampled some of their tasty dishes.  I'd say bring a book and be prepared to wait at least an hour.  If you do make it inside you are going to be overwhelmed with an enormous menu.  Cheesecake almost offers too many choices.  Best Buy: Order an appetizer as your meal, the proportions are HUGE and don't even leave room for a slice of their signature cheesecake."
Brendan M.,"New York, NY",27,204,3,3.0,3/3/2006,"My recollection about the Cheesecake Factory in SF was that you got absolutely gargantuan portions of good but not exceptional food. I have never eaten at this TCF, though, because it's definitely not worth the 1 hour wait to get a table. You can get the cheesecake to go, but I just don't think it's that spectacular."
Audrey J.,"Boston, MA",0,12,,4.0,3/18/2009,"I hated Cheesecake Factory since 2004 until I found the perfect dish last summer. The Chicken Costoletta is literally the best thing I have ever had. It's pricey, but you probably can't eat the entire thing so it's basically 2 meals. Due to my love of the chicken costoletta, I come here all the time with anyone I can and everyone absolutely loves the dish! The rest of the menu is so-so, its too big to be honest. I only recommend that you come here and get that one dish. The Cheesecake is also good, can't go wrong there."
