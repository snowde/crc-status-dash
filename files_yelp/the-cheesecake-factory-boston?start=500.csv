Star K.,"Sacramento, CA",15,83,4,4.0,2/23/2007,"oh. my. god. think spending $7 on a piece of cheesecake is ridiculous? think again.  go try cheesecake at the cheesecake factory and you'll realize that it is worth every single dollar. i always go in there and get a piece of cheesecake to go, so i cant say anything about the service or the regular food (hence the four stars and not five).  but know that if you go here, you go for the cheesecake. i will say this about the ambiance: if youre bitter about love and dont want to see a bunch of smooching couples, get your food to go.  they must gravitate towards this place or something. seriously, though...amazing cheesecake!"
Michael G.,"San Francisco, CA",15,234,2,4.0,7/21/2005,"If you want something, their menu has it. The tome that lands in front of you takes practically more time to digest than the enormous plates of food they serve. If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory, then you're missing out. I recommend going here for lunch rather than dinner, though, as the wait can get really long during peak hours."
danielle m.,"Seattle, WA",23,47,,1.0,1/27/2006,"I got food poisoning both times i ate here, eating two different dishes.  The first time I got a pasta (i forget which one), and the second time i had the enchilada mexican plate.  I didn't get cheesecake, I drank soda , and i only ate these dishes.....Cheesecake factory = SCARY!"
kristyn m.,"Boston, MA",0,42,1,4.0,8/29/2005,"Be prepared for a two hour wait. But since it is attatcehd to the mall, you can waste the time that way. They don't only have cheesecake, they have great food to. The prices seems a little expensive, but the portions are huge. They have these buffalo wing things that are stuffed with blue cheese. They rock! And the salads are great!"
Billy v.,"Salem, NH",29,49,5,3.0,11/13/2008,nice place  make sure you call first good dark bread ! DUTCH APPLE CARAMEL STREUSEL Cheesecake kicks ass
Emily A.,"Oakland, CA",2,149,,2.0,12/12/2009,"cheesecake itself was good but the meal was barely tolerable, plus way too expensive. yuck."
Sadie C.,"Boston, MA",1,28,,4.0,7/12/2009,"Its a chain, but it is better than your average chain and they are great to kids.  If you have kids and going out to dinner requires fast, efficient service and someone who doesn't roll their eyes when you walk in - you can go here get a decent salad and they have some pretty good cocktails.  I gave it 4 stars vs. other chain restaurants - like a Fridays or Chilis.  Oh and I love the banana cream cheesecake."
Pauline M.,"Marlborough, MA",0,34,,4.0,11/4/2010,I love the grilled chicken salad.  At least with this place you get plenty of food for your money-the atmosphere is nice and lots of options.  Only down side is that it is always busy.
Robert B.,"Dorchester, MA",3,44,,4.0,5/19/2008,"My rating is based on the Strawberry Martini and the Country fried chicken sliders! Yummy stuff. Although I would never make plans to eat here with anyone because... NO ONE LIKES WAITING FOR AN HOUR TO EAT WITH A PAGER IN THEIR HAND!!!!!!! I guess it means they don't need a good review but the consumers need a warning! Go during an off peak time after mall shopping and you will enjoy it, also sit in the bar to have a shorter wait for drinks."
Jesse N.,"Medford, MA",10,93,,5.0,7/11/2005,"There's much more to The Cheescake Factory than it's indulging cheescakes (the vanilla bean is my favorite). It also boasts a gigantic menu full of diverse dishes, from Thai to Tex-Mex. I have to admit, I order the same thing everytime: Avocado egg rolls (rich and sweet), the shrimp scampy (best use of garlic I've ever experienced), and of course I finish my meal off with a nice cafe latte and vanilla bean cheescake. Need I say more? A favorite for birthday parties and big groups."
Dylan C.,"Boston, MA",32,113,2,3.0,2/15/2006,"I'll make this one short and sweet.  Long wait for table, waiter, and food.  Large menu, reasonable prices for good food (I especially like the portion sizes).  Bottom line: go for dessert... and get a cheesecake to go."
Robert G.,"Boston, MA",17,99,,3.0,3/3/2006,"Eh...  This place is GREAT if you are hungover on Sunday morning and want to be a clown with your friends.  If you try to go at anyother time you'll just be disappointed by how long you have to wait.  (You'll be disappointed on Sunday too, but you'll be hungover and with friends - so who cares?).  The food isn't terrible and portions are HUGE, but it is definitely a ""factory"""
Paola C.,"New Fairfield, CT",130,234,19,4.0,3/18/2006,"Cheesecake factory is one of those places you have to go to at least once...  the food there comes in big portions and the prices arent half as bad... its good for a casual dinner with the family or a romantic dinner out with a significant other...  the selection of food is great and of course there's the cheesecake!  if you dont want to go and eat a full dinner, sit down and at least order a drink and cheesecake... its absolutely amazing...  their variety is crazy and depending on what you like you can find just about anything from key lime pie to white choc rasberry truffle to tiramisu flavors... always try the cheesecake!!!   the only downfall is the wait... depending on when you go it'll be about an hour to wait... id suggest going for an early dinner (5ish) or a late late dinner (8ish/9ish).... enjoy!!!"
Igor K.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",0,11,6,1.0,6/15/2008,"I've been to Cheesecake several times previously, and overall, I found the food quite palatable, even pleasant at times. Not gourmet but come on it's a relatively inexpensive chain restaurant so what can you expect.  My last dining experience, however, has convinced me never to go back again.  Night started with them giving my girlfriend and I the wrong appetizer, which we promptly sent back. 10 minutes later we got the one we ordered. Unfortunately that was the highlight of our evening.  I proceeded to order a burger, medium rare (probably a mistake at CF, but hey, the waitress didn't say they couldn't make it so I assumed it was good to go) while my GF ordered their overpriced ""Jambalaya"" Pasta dish. Long story short, my burger came out extremely dry and well done. I sent it back politely, pointing out to the manager how dry and overdone the burger was. The next burger (which came about 10 minutes later, after my GF had essentially finished what she could choke down of her dry, flavor-lacking meal) appeared ok at first glance. However, after taking a few bites, I found it quite unpalatable, as the burger was essentially completely RAW in the middle. The meat really wasn't even warm.  I called the manager over again, and she once again apologized and asked me if I wanted to try something else on the menu, which I declined. She then mumbled something about ""Well, this is what happens when you rush food"" or something to that effect, which I thought was odd. She was apologetic, however and not really stand-offish, which is better than some other experiences I have had elsewhere.  For our trouble, we ended up getting a comped piece of some off-the-menu cheesecake (No choice of cake was offered to us for some reason?????) and not getting charged for the burger. I thought that we should have had the entire meal comped but didn't bother pressing the issue as I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.  All in all, a terrible dining experience. I don't expect greatness when I go to a place like Cheesecake but I do expect at least borderline competence in the food, which I did not get this time around. If the cook is incapable of cooking a burger medium rare, they should politely tell you that they can only do medium as some other similar restaurants do."
Gabriella S.,"Quincy, MA",0,10,,2.0,8/12/2008,"In general, I actually like Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced, the portions are generous, and there are enough options that everyone will find something they like.  However, I think I'm going to stop coming to this one because both the food quality and the service have been consistently bad. The main problem is the slow service.  The last time I came here, our lunch was stretched out for almost two hours because we had to wait so long for everything.  It was made worse by the fact that we had to ask, and then wait, for things servers normally bring automatically, like water refills, straws for our drinks (we had to ask twice) and sugar for the coffee.  My boyfriend asked for ketchup for his hamburger, and then had to wait so long that it was cold by the time he finally got to eat it.  We wanted dessert but by the time our server finally came to take our order, we really had to leave and do other things with our day.  We even had to wait to be seated, even though there were empty tables available.  Maybe they are understaffed? There are some smaller issues as well; for example, some tables are directly across from the kitchen, which at times can be so noisy you can't hear the conversation at your own table.  Also, the food is not as good as other locations.  My favorite is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which I recently loved at the South Shore Plaza location.  At this one, it was served at room temperature and had less sauce, and tasted like it might have been sitting around for a while.  All in all, I'll find somewhere else to eat when I'm at the Prudential, and get my favorite Cheesecake Factory dishes elsewhere."
Julie F.,"Weymouth, MA",9,102,,4.0,6/25/2005,"Love the Cheesecake Factory's food (especially the cheesecake!), but it's next to impossible to get into this particular location for dinner unless you've got the whole night blocked out for the occassion. They don't take reservations, and their wait list can back up for 3 hours! To be fair, most of the big restaurants in the Pru also run a waitlist on the weekends, but the Cheesecake Factorys' seems to always be the longest wait. My advice? Have your dinner elsewhere, then stop by the Cheesecake Factory for dessert- pick up a slice at the counter, along with a big glass of milk, then take it upstairs, find a nice bench somewhere in the Concourse, and enjoy without the crowds. If you do happen to get into the CF for dinner, the food is great, portions enormous, and the staff friendly. But to me, a place with ""Cheesecake"" in the name can do no wrong!"
Andrew L.,"New York, NY",25,71,1,4.0,8/8/2005,I always enjoy a meal at the cheesecake factory. Their portions are large and the atmosphere is inviting. The wait can get long at times and they're not known for being cheap. It is probably a bad idea to not get cheesecake if you are there because it's definitely worth it.
Peanuts The Guinea Pig B.,"Boston, MA",19,70,,4.0,8/15/2007,"I only like this place for the following reasons: the portions, the drinks, the price, the fact that i can have a good time with my friends and not feel annoyed by the people around me. Yes this is a Disneyland type restaurant but honestly, sometimes I just feel like going out on the whim and at least I can bring back the rest of it for lunch the next day."
Liz W.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,29,,1.0,1/6/2008,"I have a hard time understanding why everybody likes this place so much.  If I'm looking at this many things on a menu, I'd better be at a diner.  Sure, the food is pretty good for a chain, but the prices don't match the quality.  I only find myself there for other peoples' birthdays."
