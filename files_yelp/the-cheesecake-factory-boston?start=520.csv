Amy B.,"Boston, MA",10,111,20,3.0,7/16/2009,"If you want to avoid the lines go on a Sunday for lunch. We were instantly seated and we got to eat outside (their patio area is limited but has a lovely view of the reflecting pond...) I had the cheese pizza which really wasn't special, I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. I guess I should have been more adventurous. For dessert I had the Godiva Godiva Brownie Sundae. Now don't get me wrong it was delicious and rich, but I wish you had the option of some of the desserts in a smaller size...I ended up taking 2 out of the 3 brownies home for later... I guess my biggest complaint about the cheesecake factory is their refusal to put nutritional info online. Now I've fine with splurging calorie wise when I go out to eat, but I like to know what I am getting myself into and make better choices when possible. The fact that their ""low-cal"" salads are 590 calories scares me... So between the portions and sketchy ass hiding of the N.I. this is not a place I'd regularly go to..."

Greycella L.,"Brattleboro, VT",85,153,4,3.0,12/22/2006,"This place didn't live up to the hype for me, but my little sister who lives in Boston loves it and goes to it with a crew of girlfriends all the time- and I think they are the target market. Twentysomething college-going chicks. Maybe for you cityfolk it's acceptable to go through the process necessary to be seated here, but I didn't think it was worth it. Wait in a formidable line to get your buzzer/flasher thing then wait around for around an hour for it to go off and THEN wait in another line to actually get seated! Pretty silly for food that's just slightly better than the other sodium-packed chains like applebees. Their legendary menu is glossy and has ads in it- which seems unjust given that I'm paying decent money for mediocre food just because of the location and because my little sister was just dying to take me here as I treated her for her birthday. There was a lot to choose from, and the portions were generous. When we mentioned it was her birthday they brought out their namesake dish- which honestly wasn't that great. I wouldn't go back here again, but with a cute interior and a huge menu I could see why this is a popular date spot for the college crowd because it feels more upscale than it really is and the price is enough that it feels like a special outing but not enough to bust the bank. That said, any date of mine would get way more brownie points in my book if they did their research and found a locally owned spot that didn't have a long line or ads in their menus when taking me out."
Missus F.,"Salem, MA",62,310,4,2.0,12/21/2008,"i really don't get why people go ape shit over this place. the tiramisu is amazing. as in, the regular tiramisu, not the tiramisu cheesecake (which is good, don't get me wrong). i have a hard time picking something off the large menu, and i've never been thrilled with the food. i've been enough times that i should have found something good by now. i don't know. i kind of feel like this place is generic and is for people with no imagination. that's rude of me to say, though, so let's pretend i didn't."
sammie j.,"Medford, MA",0,60,,4.0,5/27/2009,"I only been to the New York Cheesecake factory once and it was at the Prudential. I went with a friend because our bellies were screaming in agony for hunger. As we entered the place, there was already a long line. We actually waited about 10-15 before being served, apparently, the restaurant is usually busy. The atmosphere was bustling and amplified. The waitress was nice enough, she wasn't harassing us every 30 seconds if our food was delicious and everything was fine, yet she checked on us enough, in case we needed something. I order Fish and Chips and it was huge portions, even for me, A person who lives to eat. I could not even eat all the food. They forgot the lemon but I can forgive. The Only thing I can complain about is the food is pricier than the typical American restaurant. I paid $20 with tips for my meal, but it is okay. I left full and happy;Mission accomplished."
Scott B.,"Newton, MA",5,157,,1.0,8/28/2008,"you know i gota say this place has gone way down hill since they have grown so huge.  i actually used to like going there now its just looking at the menu and figuring out which will make me spend less time in the bathroom either gagging or doing the other. As i always say, if the food isnt any good just get drunk.  then you can serve me shit on a stick and i will say oh my god that is the best shit on a stick i have ever had"
Alex G.,"San Francisco, CA",204,28,5,2.0,2/28/2006,people always want to come here 'for the cheesecake.' i think the food is overpriced and the place is overrated. its not usually worth the wait.
Merredith L.,"Noe Valley, San Francisco, CA",553,935,28,4.0,10/5/2006,"This is a chain restaurant.  If you have picky eaters, though, this is a great place to take them.  The menu is enormous.  There are pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, salads, anything you could want.  Personally, i'd rather go to a smaller, more individual place, but sometimes you cant.  the sunday brunch they have there is good as well.  the best things about cheesecake factory though are their brown bread (dont even bother with the white, just ask for all brown in your basket mmmmm) and the frozen lemonade drink they have.  i always forget what its called, but it tastes just like a real lemon.  don't get it for the tiny bit of alcohol that's in it you cant even taste, get it just to have a lemony treat. mmm.  this place is always super crowded though, so be prepared to wait in line for even hrs.  oh, and the cheesecake is supposed to be good too. i dont eat cheesecake, and one piece will give you your calories for at least a day, but try it if you want."
Karina M.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",19,62,2,3.0,6/18/2007,"The cheesecake factory and I are in a love-hate relationship.... love being the cheesecake (duh) and the good selection of food and hate being the prices and the huuuge portions. I am a huge-portion-hater because that means that I am going to leave the restaurant feeling sick and overstuffed. And the cheesecake factory does just that to me... see it's those huuuuge plates of pasta and the I just HAVE to order the cheesecake because i'm in the freaking factory, so I end up leaving the place feeling like a cow. If you dont mind that then go for it-- or you could also take the leftovers home and feed yourself for another week. Also the place has a sort of ""chain restaurant"" feel to it, sort of impersonal. I know they try to make it an amazing experience and try to look classy and unique etc, but i think it's just unavoidable (maybe it's the ads in the menus)."
Felix L.,"Boston, MA",5,54,2,3.0,4/24/2007,"I think this place is generally over-hyped. Entrees are a bit pricey for what you get. The food is generally decent, never amazing... I guess the desserts are good, but I never want to stay any longer after i'm done with my meal (after spending 30+ min waiting for a table)"
Steve S.,"Boston, MA",1,99,,5.0,8/29/2005,"As good a meal as you can find in Boston and portions so big I've never finished it all in one sitting. The menu is incredible, both in its breadth and its quailty. From salads to steaks to appetizers to desserts, this place will have a delicious option for every eater. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of change because you won't want to miss out on their signature cheesecakes after you've had your entree. It's best to go during off-peak hours, unless you are prepared to wait a couple hours."
Jill M.,"Punta Gorda, FL",4,36,,4.0,6/29/2005,"This restaurant is guaranteed to please.  They have the biggest menu I have ever seen in my life with absolutely everything.  There's something to please every tatse.  It's actually a bit overwhelming.  I spend 20 minutes looking at the menu, then I just give up and order the same thing every time.  My favorite item is the chinese chicken salad.  I'm not a cheesecake girl - but I hear it's pretty decent there.  Go figure!  The portions are enormous - so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.  And expect a wait - it's pretty much always packed."
Juliette V.,"Cambridge, MA",0,101,,4.0,7/12/2005,"Huge amounts of food and great quality for the money. I have never gotten anything I did not like. Their menu items range from copious salads to good old fashioned burgers to nicely seasoned buffallo wings. Plus, do not forget the signature item, cheesecake."
