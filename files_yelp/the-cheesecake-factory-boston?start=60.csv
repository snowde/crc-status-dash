Michael K.,"Quincy, MA",0,18,6,3.0,8/1/2017,The food are good the workers their are nice. It is a friendly place to eat and enjoy your time. The room lights are lite so you can see. It is a nice place in Boston back bay . The cheese cakes are delicious that is why I want to come back again. After all it is a good place and good time.
Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",202,439,2581,3.0,3/21/2016,"I normally LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, but this visit fell short of the normal standard! I ordered one of my usual dishes, the chicken parm sandwich and it wasn't as good as usual. My fellow diners enjoyed their meals (chicken with asparagus & mashed potato and nachos), the portions were huge, but the quality wasn't there. We ordered 2 slices of cheesecake, key lime & salted caramel, they were delicious! Service was great, our service was really helpful and able to provide recommendations and the food came out quickly. Another added bonus was that we were seated straight away, with no wait! Not often heard of at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Leonardo V.,"Boston, MA",2,2,1,2.0,7/30/2017,"Wow, the server talent here has dropped substantially. Dirty B&B plates and silverware. This is the simplest task in a restaurant, the first thing a guest sees, and it's a big fail. At least the food is consistent here still. Cheesecake Factory used to be at the top of its game but seems to have some lazy servers now. Email me and I can come help improve this (for your lunch service anyway)."
Sam Y.,"New York, NY",103,25,,1.0,5/4/2017,I have nothing good to say about this location and its entirely because of poor service. I have come here 4 times in the past month (it's awfully close to my office) but have only eaten here successfully once. Each time it takes about 10-15 minutes to get a server's attention for water and then about another 10-15 minutes to get my order in. I don't know about anyone else but I don't have all the time in the world for lunch. I generally like their food but 3 times this month I've had to skip lunch because I can't for the life of me find my waiter.
Chris M.,"Boston, MA",0,19,10,4.0,4/14/2016,"Went on a Sunday afternoon, had a 5 minute wait. Not bad.  Something that slightly annoyed me was that as our hostess was showing us to our table, the path was blocked by a lady trying to fix her stroller and instead of turning back and going a different route (which the group behind us did), she JUST STOOD THERE for a good 3 minutes. She didn't say anything to us or the lady. Hmmm... Eventually we got to the table but...that was annoying.  Waiter was friendly and helpful, but just sort of..disappeared after we got our food. After we were done eating, we were searching for him so we could get the check.  Food was good, all in all.  Spicy chipotle chicken pasta- flavorful, good, wished there was more chicken though  Louisiana chicken- really good. Ordered this before and I love the crispness of the chicken. Mixes well with pasta"
Spencer R.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2017,"I wanted a ruben and they didn't have it on the menu. I wanted a simple grilled cheese sandwich, but they had to make it their job to load it with a pound of butter and clog my arteries. they ran out of fries and i sat there looking like a dick without my fries. they brought out our orders in at complete different times and my friends finished theirs before mine even came. once the fries finally came out , of course they were something of a salt miners nightmare. my mouth was dryer then the dead sea and greasier than the oil spill in the gulf of mexico  overall this was pretty shitty considering that it is a somewhat decent priced meal.  our waitress took away my friends present not realizing it. they didn't sing happy birthday to my friend. fuck you cheesecake factory"
Eileen C.,"Belmar, NJ",54,71,,4.0,6/28/2017,"I was staying at the Sheraton. The location was convenient. Although it was busy, the wait time for a table was under 5 minutes.  The drinks were strong but good.  My whole family enjoyed the selections available and the food came out quickly.   I would recommend to anyone staying in the area to hit there for lunch or dinner."
Stephanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,225,143,3.0,2/20/2016,"Oh, The Cheesecake Factory. Every time I have gone up against you I have lost, crawling back to the car with my tail between my legs and preparing for the imminent food coma. Your modest (but delicious!) assortment of vegetarian options like those rich, buttery, palpably artery-clogging garlic noodles with perfectly cut pieces of asparagus I dream about. Your stuffed mushroom appetizer that my boyfriend and I have a hard time splitting evenly (even with 6!) Not to mention those crunchy, oil soaked portobello, zucchini and avocado fries with assorted dipping sauces that taste so right. (I mean, it's full of veggies so it's good for you right?) All in all, a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory. We came for an early dinner once around 5pm (the ""blue-haired"" special!) and was seated as soon as the hostess was back to lead us to the table. Another day (Valentine's Day, actually) we came back around 9:30 and the quoted wait was over an hour! Since California Pizza Kitchen stopped taking orders ahead of its earlier 10pm closing time, we decided to go with takeout which easily fell within the 15-20 minute estimated wait. Although I could never hate the Cheesecake Factory when it consistently and reliably indulges my most gluttonous fantasies, my boyfriend did see a small mouse in the bathroom as we were getting ready to leave. We weren't sure how to report it without alarming the restaurant (according to him, mice are everywhere in Boston so it might not be that shocking) but I just felt like somebody should know."
Maria M.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"We ordered an appetizer and entree. The waitress didn't write the order down, when the food came out it was dumped on the table on the table by ""runner's"" and everything came out at once.  We never saw the waitress until it was time to pay. We had to ask repeatedly for ketsup, salt.  When placing the order I asked for dressing on the side for the salad, the salad was soaked with dressing.  In hind sight we should have requested to see the manager.  In the end we will never go back. Too many other options available in Boston with better service."
Nevaeh N.,"Fenway/Kenmore, Boston, MA",0,10,,4.0,6/26/2017,Good food not so amazing like everyone hyped about cheesecake but it was my first time ever going to cheesecake period. THE SERVICE was phenomenal let me tell you my server Cesar was FIERCE!!! He was quick charming and on point. It was effortless yet perfect for me.y food was good the mac and cheese was my favorite and a lot of it too. It was big
Victoria O.,"Methuen, MA",113,2,1,1.0,6/23/2017,"Well, first off every person in my party currently works in a restaurant and is aware of how a restaurant works. We walked in within an hour of closing time, which I understand sometimes can be annoying. However, we waited about 5 minutes for our sever Sarah to come over who was clearly under the influence of dugs or alcohol. Everything was fine until my boyfriend ordered his second drunk which had 0 alcohol and was filled with juice. He told her he didn't want it because there was no alcohol and she laughed and snatched it back. Food came out about 30 minutes later. My food had clearly been sitting in the window for a decent amount of time and had a clear fluid all over the top, my boyfriend ordered medium rare steak that came out med-well/well with broccoli that was freshly out of the freezer and ice cold. Sever did not come back, let someone else know about the food, he took it back, server came back in the meantime, asked how it was over the rail.. ripped my plate out of my hands and didn't let us finish what we were saying. The Manger Denise came over... the most unprofessional, inside and out manger I have EVER come across, didn't offer any apology, or anything. My food came back, the sever handed me my new plate over the rail, didn't offer me cheese, about 10 minutes later my boyfriends steak came back... same exact  steak with the same bite he took out of it.. now extra well done when it was supposed to be med rare and microwaved the broccoli . He found Denise and she argued with him for about 5 minutes telling him that it's normal procedure to heat up already eaten food and put it back on the grill to warm it up(why would you warm up a med well steak that was supposed to be med rare) still didn't apologize, said she was correct several times and that he was wrong. In this time another manger Sam came over. She was the nicest person we came across the entire night, and made sure we were as happy as we could be,and actually apologized for her co workers. About 15 minutes later the new steak got delivered Denise who threw it on the table and walked away.  Not once did Any one except Sam apologize. This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and all we got out of it was a free piece of steak. So next time you think about going to the cheese cake factory, just remember your food is being cooked on the same grill as half eaten steak, as Denise reassured us SEVERAL times. Attached is the picture of the steak that was sent back"
Marco H.,"Fenway, Boston, MA",1,28,23,5.0,4/17/2017,Always a good place to go!!  Tuna tartare is the most!! Also any cheesecake you can get is delicious .
Valerie J.,"Baltimore, MD",242,15,15,1.0,1/25/2017,"This was the worst meal I've ever had from The Cheesecake Factory. I was in Boston for just a day and a half, and thought this would be a pretty safe bet for a good meal - I was wrong. I got the Chicken Salad Sandwich which I could barely eat 3 bites of. It was awful. The chicken tasted like the scraps that aren't good enough to use on their main entrees, and it was full of peanuts and WAY too much celery.  The bread was too buttery and was soggy. The best part of my meal was the sweet potato fries, but they were undercooked.  Worst meal I've ever had from a Cheesecake Factory."
Lizzy K.,"New York, NY",256,223,134,4.0,5/21/2015,"What's good about going to a chain, is knowing what to expect. This Cheesecake Factory is no exception.  The food was just as good, the service friendly and accomodating. It was very baby friendly. On a saturday afternoon, the wait wasn't too bad- about an hour.  My only complaint is that the entrance sent you to the back of the resturant so you had to walk through to get to the front which was a little bit awkward."
Priscilla Y.,"Boston, MA",651,101,155,3.0,10/3/2016,"I love the pasta and bread here! The food is consistent and the service is attentive, even during busy times. It's a little pricey for what it is and I wouldn't recommend anything aside from the pasta and the free bread (brown bread of course). There isn't typically a long wait (I've only waited 15-20 minutes at most) but during peak meal times I've seen wait times up to an hour. The atmosphere is loud though, so don't come here for a romantic dinner or anything."
Aimee L.,"Boston, MA",9,15,2,2.0,9/3/2017,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but be prepared to wait by a wall for 15-20 minutes AFTER they buzz you. They should buzz you when they are ready to seat you, not when they're ready to line you up by the wall. The lobby is extremely crowded and full of stinky, sweaty people because of this."
Bojan P.,"Toronto, Canada",20,123,105,4.0,1/4/2016,"4 of us came to the restaurant after a long day of touring Boston city.  We were super hungry and were ready to get large portions.  We had no reservations, and ended up waiting in a super crowded area for only 15 minutes until we got a table. Pros: + 15-20 minute wait even with a large line + Super large portions Cons: - Sub par service (primarily due to such large restaurant)  Ambiance (5 stars): The restaurant looks really clean, and modern.  It has high ceilings and comfortable chairs. The washrooms are clean and spacious.   Food: (4.5 stars) Knowing their large portions we only got the main meal. I got a Burrito (4 stars) - super large and tasty. Smokehouse Burgers  (5 stars) - After recommendation from the waiter we got 2 of these instead of the Bacon Bacon Burger.  The burger was amazing.  One of the best burgers I ever had.   Real juicy with a generous portion of bacon and cheese and great sauce.  Would def recommend it.   A Salad with Salmon (5 stars) - All the ingredients were really fresh and they went well together.   Service: ( 3 stars) We order drinks at the start and then we ordered food.  We were given bread at the start, and most of the drinks about 5 minutes later.   We finished the bread, and still waited another 5 minutes for the drink (After reminding the waiter that the drink was missing he came back with it). We did not get extra bread or anything and waited another 10 minutes at least for the food to arrive.  the waiter was not around to help us.   The bill came to 115 with tax and tip for 4 meals, and 6 drinks."
Maria K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,38,,3.0,4/25/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Was in Boston attending a conference at the Marriott and didn't want the boxed lunch that was provided.  A colleague and I ventured over and made use of the overhead connector from the hotel.  It was nice not to have to go outside as rain was in the forecast (luckily did not materialize :)  This was quite possibly the largest dining room at a Cheesecake Factory location I have ever seen which I am sure helps cut wait times during peak hours. The food doesn't really need to be reviewed.  I got the carbonara pasta which was yummy.  The only thing I wanted to mention was that we had an interesting interaction with our server.  He seemed to be making a federal case about not being able to split a check but trying to reassure me that it could be done at the end when payment was made.  I used to wait tables and I like to think of myself as being a very gracious and considerate guest.  I only asked because I know in most places there is a policy against splitting a check if you don't mention it upfront as you order.  I would expect a lecture if I had not asked ahead of time but I was not expecting the tongue lashing when I mentioned it early while ordering.  Okay, so just say that it can be taken care of at the end and it would have been fine dude. The hotel did have a small fridge for leftovers but no microwave to heat it up, go figure.  Pasta is still yummy cold!"
Brooke S.,"Geneva, NY",54,26,48,3.0,4/15/2016,"This is an okay Cheesecake Factory but the one at the end of lechemere is better and worth the travel. They don't take reservations so be ready to wait but maybe not on the weekdays. The hosts were okay greeted me quickly told me to wait and forgot about me. But they came back shortly and got me so I wasn't upset. Then a waiter greeted us and he was very nice, probably the best thing about the trip.  We ordered drinks and got a Cesar salad for an app, it was good and perfect size. I ordered pasta with sauce and my boyfriend got a spicy pasta dish. My dish came out 50% tomatoes  and my boyfriend said his was okay but agreed we probably wouldn't be back.  We got the Oreo cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake. They were both good but the biscuits with the shortcake were way to hard.  So to summarize: food was okay and service was great - probably won't be back tho."
Colleen M.,"Oglesby, IL",33,17,2,2.0,8/13/2016,"My daughter and I came here for a ""girls night out"" while my husband and son went to a baseball game.  This restaurant is located inside the Prudential Mall.  Décor is nice and modern.  The tile floors were amazingly greasy, it was very hazardous to walk on them!  I can only assume it is tracked in from the kitchen floor- which is a little scary to think about.  We ordered the factory nachos as appetizer.  She had the filet mignon and I had the grilled chicken tostada salad.  Overall, the food was not bad.  As described by my daughter ""its just ok"".  However, the service was another story.  We sat down at 6:35pm.  Because of the astonishingly slow service, we did not leave until 8:18pm!  Constantly having to ask for our server to refill drinks, etc.   Taking into account the cost of the menu items and obvious cleaning issues, I would suggest another one of the surrounding restaurants for your next night out."
