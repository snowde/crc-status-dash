Keem H.,"Cambridge, MA",109,84,12,1.0,3/26/2017,"Very rude and quite discriminative hosts. We checked-in,  the host told us 15 minutes. We waited and then they called us. We asked for a high chair for our child. She looked at us and said that would be another 20 minutes !!!! Why didn't you say so from the beginning didn't you see me walking in with a stroller!!! Very rude!! No wonder why people keep complaining about their service. Honestly not worth your time or money."
Tianyu Z.,"Malden, MA",0,4,,3.0,4/24/2017,"Good location, the best location in Boston. I didn't need to wait for seats. There were not many people dining here in Monday evening. So we get seats very quickly. We ordered rib eye, fillet and Hibachi steak, all medium rare. For fillet, it was perfect for me because I don't like very raw steak. I like the doneness here. However, rib eye was a little overcooked. I could see little pink at the center, but brown almost. And the cake was so sweet for me. Recommend if you want to try cheaper steak."
Jayson H.,"Gilbert, AZ",809,161,66,2.0,7/27/2016,I would love to give you A5 star review because I usually get their chicken tender strip things. This time we decided to go with the nachos because we're in a quick hurry and we've had nachos at other locations. This order was Tiny in comparison. Practically zero chicken very few chips. At first it took awhile to get our server to us as well. When she came she was good
Emilé Y.,"Wellesley, MA",177,7,,5.0,5/7/2017,Ordered the Kobe beef burger. It was delicious and the portions were huge! Will definitely return.
Katie N.,"South Portland, ME",21,6,1,5.0,4/27/2017,"First experience at a Cheesecake Factory, ever! And I must say -- I now understand what all the fuss is about! There food is phenomenal, and so is the cheesecake! Would definitely eat here over and over again!"
Amy C.,"San Mateo, CA",299,409,1300,4.0,1/21/2016,"This review is simply for the cheesecakes and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. I've never eaten a proper meal there, although I have seen their lunch and dinner menus, which seem overwhelming with the sheer number of items on the menu. From what I've heard, dessert is where The Cheesecake Factory excels, and entrees are not as much of a strength (mediocre and overpriced, from what I've heard). However, their cheesecakes are really phenomenal. They come in huge slices with mountains of whipped cream. As a whipped cream lover, I am a huge fan of the amount of whipped cream that goes onto these cheesecakes. They are perfect for sharing among a group of friends. Every July, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants nationwide also celebrate National Cheesecake Day with 50% of all cheesecake slices, so the cost of one slice drops down to about $3.50. One of my favorite desserts there (besides the cheesecakes) is the strawberry shortbread. This is a massive dessert with sugary, crunchy shortbread topped with a large quantity of fresh cut strawberries, with generous scoops of vanilla ice cream and swirls of whipped cream on top. At only $8 or $9, the amount of food is really good value.  The ambiance at this place is nice. It is a huge restaurant located in the Prudential Center, so even when there are a lot of patrons there isn't much of a wait."
Victoria D.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,12,,3.0,8/13/2017,"Food is seriously meh. We got the BBQ burger and the chicken but neither were great dishes yet still pretty overpriced. Our server was adorable though hence the three stars. He actually went dadalada when serving our cheesecake and it was the sweetest thing. The cheesecake unlike the actual meal was great. We had the strawberry cheesecake and the juiciness of the strawberry and the creaminess of the cake balance out perfectly. If you ever come by the Cheesecake Factory, opt for the cake not the food."
Amy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",471,356,301,3.0,8/24/2015,"*the entrance was a bit confusing. If you entered thru the revolving doors by outdoor seating, the front area is all the way back around the restaurant.  *there are really no obvious waiting vs order lines in the front area, so if you only want to order a cheesecake to go, ask everyone around you if they are waiting to order/get a seat/etc. *cashier lady and staff were nice, and my salted caramel cheesecake slice took only a few minutes to pack. But expect tons of pple waiting around, and try to focus really hard on the staff calling your name for your order over the loud music/chatter/noise. *the salted caramel cheesecake was delicious! I suggest sharing one slice between two pple, otherwise it feels a bit overwhelming."
Eleanor Q.,"Manhattan, NY",88,75,97,4.0,12/23/2015,"These restaurants under the same brand usually feels the same. Huge rooms, dent light, decent dishes. Pros: Dishes were very nice. We ordered separately and shared everything. I personally favor the pasta but all others were nice as well. I recall better with pictures so see the description on my photo. Con Inefficient waiter"
Monica L.,"Manhattan, NY",26,141,217,3.0,12/30/2015,Probably the best place to eat huge quantites of food with a great environment and service. Mango smoothie is fantastic and all dishes are what you expect.
Ed H.,"Boston, MA",2,41,,5.0,1/30/2017,"I consider The Cheesecake Factory as the only large chain restaurant that provides consistent quality and service. I know what to expect with any location that I visit. In the rare cases where they haven't delivered to my expectations, managers have stepped in to rectify for either quality (e.g., food came out cold) or service (e.g., unusually long wait for an order or waiter messed up the order). The menu is broad, you can come back over and over again to try something new. The portions are also generous (although I have noticed that they are a bit smaller these days than in the past - not sure if that is a trend or a few one-offs). Overall, I rate 5 stars because no other chain comes close."
Jose S.,"Valencia, Spain",187,175,1788,4.0,7/20/2015,"I've been a few times to this franchise. The first one was in 2013 in Palo Alto, bigger than this one, but all of these franchises share the same decoration, no matter the city or the building. First time I ordered a dish with salmon, I only remember it was yummy nothing else and for dessert a original cheesecake, a must if you come to this place. This last time there was a lane, so we needed to wait some minutes in order to hace dinner. After waiting, a member of the staff called us and took us to our table. I personally don't like how the service is managed, too exaggerated in my opinion, no need to give a speech or overact. Despite of this, he attended us pretty good, firstly taking note of the beverages ( the waiter exaggerating with every choice ) and then the food. We sticked with burgers, after three weeks I hadn't had one, so it was time to order one. I order it medium cook, but for my opinion it was overcooked, nevertheless to say it was good and yummy. You can order your burger with french fries or one kind of vegetables ( forget about ordering a mix of two or more ). To wrap up the dinner we had Godiva and Dulce de Leche cheesecakes, both very heavy but wonderful at the same time."
Leo C.,"Dorchester, Dorchester, MA",33,4,,5.0,7/31/2017,Went there with my boyfriend for a bite to eat some cocktails and got a lovely male server he was an absolute pleasure and  our drinks and food were out quickly deffo a 10/10
Michelle T.,"Lowell, MA",2,26,84,4.0,12/29/2016,"Our waiter made great recommendations for my bf and I. It was absolutely delicious. We ordered the Cuban rolls, herb salmon mashed potato asparagus fish, Louisiana chicken pasta & the chocolate hazelnut Nutella crunch cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious but a bit too sweet for my palette."
Mike G.,"Hull, MA",5,123,159,2.0,5/1/2015,"Okay it's Cheesecake Factory; and good food should be a treat. NO THANK YOU. We were crazy to think that. LIKE ALL GLORIFIED CRAPPY CHAINS, it misses the mark. (We do like PF CHANG'S though.) We waited a few minutes (10) before being seated. It was Okay. We had Chris (Christopher) as our server. He was great throughout the meal. Very friendly. DRAFT PRICES ARE NOT WORTH IT, TRUST ME. JUST A RIP-OFF.  BACON-BACON CHEESEBURGER $12.95 (2/5) We, also, did a sweet potato upgrade. Look at the burger pic taken. In the old classic commercials ""WHERE'S THE BEEF"". Almost a third smaller than the bun used. SPICY CHICKEN CASHEW $17.95 (1.5/5) OMG, it was SALTY and MEATLESS. The whole mound in the picture is RICE. SERIOUSLY, RICE; seriously, this place is a joke. $17.95 for RICE, what a joke. WE ONLY DINED HERE FOR A GIFT CARD ONLY (given to us). Otherwise, we would not step inside one of these crappy restaurant. They will be like the old Steak and Ale's, Bennigans and other restaurant chains that closed."
Claire P.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",88,137,174,5.0,7/1/2015,"Located at the entrance of the Prudential Centre right by the T stop, this place caught my eye immediately.  We had to wait a few minutes for a table, however whilst waiting we had time to view the vast cheesecake counter and eye our top choices.  After being sat down we were promptly provided with the menu, as we were only there for cheesecake we flipped right to the back of the menu to view the sweets. We were shocked when the list of cheesecakes covered two entire pages.  Sadly my first choice of fresh blueberry and white chocolate had sold out, however our waitress recommended that I try the raspberry and white chocolate instead, so I did. The slices were not at all skimpy, so much so that my sugar levels were off the radar after finishing.  The cheesecake itself was moist and light with exceptional flavours running throughout. The bases was strong enough to support the weight and structure too so it didn't fall apart when you stuck your fork in. If you're in need of a sugar fix and are in the area, I would recommend this place!"
Alex B.,"Quincy, MA",0,45,16,1.0,3/16/2016,"I get food from here all the time, and today is one of many dissapointments. Should of learned my lesson the first time. Tonight I ordered two alfredo one with shrimp& chicken the other with just shrimps. First of all they were literally $1 difference. Second of all my shrimps were cut in half like they were running out of shrimps, and there are FIVE pieces of shrimps so basically they put 2 1/2 of shrimps in my alfredo. THIS SHIT DOES NOT WORTH $20+. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. HORRIBLE!!!"
Theresa C.,"Boston, MA",1,16,,4.0,4/17/2016,"***GLUTEN-FREE REVIEW*** GF items are clearly labeled on the menu! What a plus. This makes dining out so much more pleasant for me.  They only have one GF cheesecake available (the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake). I wish they'd have a larger selection of GF cheesecakes. Otherwise, this isn't a bad place for many GF cordials, appetizers, and entrees."
Faisal A.,"Boston, MA",0,2,1,5.0,7/5/2016,Five stars for Aliah. The best waiter ever. Thanks for your outstanding service buddy.
Ariana P.,"Brighton, MA",0,5,,1.0,1/8/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a reunion dinner. While planning, we called ahead and asked for a reservation. The first time we called, we were told that they did not take reservations. The second time another member called, someone allowed a reservation for us at 4:30.  When we arrived, we were told there was no reservation under our name so we had to get a pager and wait 30 minutes and that was fine. The part that was the most appalling part was when a waitress (not even a hostess) called out the name of our party's name. She kept calling so we went up. She looked at us, we said the party's name and then she looked at us with a disapproving look and said ""Is your pager buzzing?"" When we responded no, she said ""Nice try."" Um, since when did we need to prove our identity? She continued to call the party's name but no one stepped up. So they moved on to another table. We waited another 20 minutes before we knew that we had been waiting way over a half hour. So my party went up and asked about the reservation as well as when we would be seated. They conveniently said that we were next. When we were lead to our table, we were seated at a booth meant for four with a chair at the end. No other booth had that kind of arrangement. It looked like the table had been put together in a rush and last minute. My party was positive that the table being called earlier was ours.  The rest of our experience was okay. The service from our waiter was okay, but there could definitely be room for improvement. I would like to think that the waiter was new and was trying to still get the hang of things. The food was as expected.  I am very put off by the way the staff talked to us, as if we were trying to take someone else's place in line. No one else was coming forward and the name they had been calling was one of my party members. We genuinely thought that she was calling our party. I felt that it was very unnecessary for the hostess to talk to us that way. We were polite the entire time as well as treated the staff with respect. I am not sure that person should be in an industry that involves being nice to customers. What I noticed the biggest problem about this location is the staff. The host/hostess stand seemed very unorganized, the waitstaff seemed to be less than thrilled to be there. It's understandable, not many people want to WANT to work in the industry, but if you're going to at least try and hide how much you hate to be there."
