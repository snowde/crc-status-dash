Emily P.,"Lafayette, CO",92,106,323,5.0,11/22/2017,"So ... my boss splurged ... and we ordered 10 delicious meals and 8 desserts ... TO GO! Not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination! I called and ordered over the phone with Dana. She was patient, focused, and sooooo sweet! She repeated each order back to me, and verified the pick up time. When I arrived the food was piping hot (which rarely happens with take out food), and Dana and Alexandria (I think that's what her name was- also super efficient and friendly) were writing the names I provided for each and every meal and dessert on the individual containers. Wow!  Thank you! It made my delivery at work so much easier! Annnnnnd ... each meal and each dessert was delicious. No complaints from my picky picky office mates. First time everrrrrrr! I happen to be a super picky salmon person. My grilled salmon was super delicious. Usually when I order salmon at a restaurant I can't eat it.  It has to be grilled to perfection. Cheesecake Factory - awesome job!!! Thank you! Other dishes we ordered ? Cheesecake (duh). Yummy!  Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken ... excellent reviews from both people eating it.  Salads - big, healthy, and devilish. There is a healthy portion of the menu called ""skinny- Licious""... accurate description. Healthier, lighter food. So!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for the delicious food, spectacular customer service, and for going above and beyond what we expected!  Happy Holidays!"
Amber M.,"Black Hawk, CO",260,214,235,2.0,10/26/2017,"The menu here is huge, so you should be able to find something you like. Unless, of course, you want something healthy. I ordered the ""Almond-Crusted Salmon Salad"", a menu item labeled as a ""Superfood Salad."" It contained fresh, quality ingredients, but was fully saturated in an oily dressing and the salmon was coated with what appeared to be a mayonnaise-based sauce. Some dressing and sauces are nice, but this was too much. It was too heavy for me to finish and that should not happen with a simple salmon salad. I looked up the calories on CalorieLab and that menu item contains 1,200 calories. That's crazy for a salad.  The service was fine and the place seemed clean, but beware the menu items. Things that sound healthy definitely are not."
Paulette D.,"Denver, CO",189,69,237,4.0,8/25/2017,"My friend and I ended up here after wandering around watching the street performances. She had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before and was ""hoping they will have something she liked"". Haha! We walked in and were promptly sat at a nice table outdoors. Our waiter was extremely attentive and we were quickly served water and our choice of wine. We decided to get a bottle and it came out in a nice wine carrier and our waiter kept it flowing as we were pouring over the endless food options.  Of course Colorado pulled its typical weather heist and it went from a bright blue sunny day to a torrential downpour in a couple of minutes. As soon as it started a multitude of servers ran outside to help everyone bring their stuff inside and re-sat. Great service!  My friend and I then received our food. We ordered the mac and cheese burger with sweet potato fries and the chicken club sandwich; both of which we shared. My friend was very pleased with both, as was I. The burger was cooked perfectly to our liking, it would have been even better if the mac and cheese covered the whole burger. The chicken sandwich was good and cooked very nicely with great bread. The only food problem we had was the sweet potato fries. They were not crispy, and lacked flavor. The regular fries were good so we shared those. At the end of our meal we shared a piece of strawberry cheesecake, which was good, but not great. We also received coupons for a free piece of cheesecake when we visit next. Yum!  Overall we had a good experience at the Cheesecake factory and would visit this location again if the craving came."
Ricky N.,"Broomfield, CO",95,29,3,5.0,8/10/2017,"Right when you walk in, the atmosphere is entrancing at best. ( depending on the time you walk in ) for me it's 930pm. I can hear myself think and engage in a conversation. It's lightly dimmed, music is very retro but soothing and you can truly appreciate the decor at thus time of the night.  I am thoroughly enjoying our waitress as well. She's very welcoming and she has a an almost homely feel to her by her personality. She's quite engaging on the menu options as well. Moving to the food quite a bit to just do taste tests and I can happily say the food was amazing.  Fresh in every sense and seasoned perfectly. I almost regretted swallowing it. While i am no connoisseur when it comes to fine dining, I know what I enjoy and don't and to my amazing surprise I tried something I've never tried in my life and am in love. I highly recommend coming here at night just so you may get a mere glimpse into what I had experienced here tonight."
shawn S.,"Orlando, FL",14,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,Service was awful (ketchup spilled on my pants and sneakers- and nothing was done. Dynamite shrimp was over cooked. Natasha was hopefully really new. Wouldn't reccomend.
Tricia R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,179,84,4.0,4/26/2017,"NOMS! My fiance and I had a show at the Boulder Theater and saw The Cheesecake Factory was next door. We decided to have a nice dinner before the show, and the Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint! It was prom night, so it was definitely busy but we still got seated rather quickly for showing up on the fly, (about 15 minutes wait). The staff was super friendly and nice. The waitress we had was great and not only was she nice, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered our questions about with ease. The food was incredibly delicious, no complaints whatsoever. They also had Moscatto wine, which is my absolute favorite so I was pretty stoked about that. The place, while busy, was clean and tidy. I'm glad we decided to stop in. If we end up back in the area, we'll definitely stop back by for some more tasty goodness!"
Yakova O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,24,3.0,12/5/2017,"Always a great place for drinks and a challenging menu, however can't go wrong with any of the items"
Paul W.,"Boulder, CO",76,148,14,2.0,10/23/2016,"Having enjoyed their dinners from time to time, I expected the same quality for breakfast, in this case, Sunday brunch. Given how many amazing restaurants Boulder has on display, it's always seemed silly to me to venture into The Cheesecake Factory, a standardized chain found in many US cities. My adventure started with a sour, fermented grapefruit juice which tasted as it it were somebody else's drink - one that was left in the back of the bar for a few days. In case this is news to you, grapefruit juice should taste fresh and delightful, not as if it were scooped from an old, icy, cardboard container and microwaved. I sent it back and stuck with water. The water tasted like coffee. We're off to a great start! I asked for extra butter and was given 3 tiny tabs, as if butter is a dangerously low commodity for this multi-million dollar chain. How about fresh organic butter? Ya know, the stuff that doesn't give you cancer? Oops, too expensive!  In the same vein, I suppose it's too much to ask to have maple syrup that's made of, ya know, maple syrup. The maple syrup I was served poured so quickly from the tiny metal pitcher that it could only be sugar-water. Providing real maple syrup must be far too much of an inconvenience and expense for a one-person $20 tab. Note to manager: This is Boulder, where we expect food to be made of food, especially if it's labeled that way. Given that it's not maple syrup, this makes you yet another corporate conglomerate lying to customers, feeding them crap that makes the sicker and fatter. Good on ya mate!  The partially sprouted tomatoes on my plate of Crab Hash were clearly grown in a hot-house, born from GMO and had their flavor surgically removed. They seemed to have a sign on them that said ""Not to be eaten!"" The hash was pretty good, but only God knows what types of crappy, cancerous oils they used to make it. My plate was drenched in oil. I should probably get checked for lesions. When I looked at my second pancake (beneath the pretty one on top), it was only partially formed, kinda like Pacman. Its mouth drooped open as if to say, ""the cook was lazy today, please look away from my decaying mouth.""  I asked the hostess to move my seat further down the windows but was told ""that section would not have a server for some time"", as if walking 12 feet was too dangerous and complex an expedition for my waitress. The reason I wanted to move was because the hillbilly couple next to me was so enthralled with hating muslims and gay people - and blowing Trump that I could not stand listening to them. My little move request make sense now honey?  I mean it's wonderful that you have a snippy, corporate barbie doll at the host desk, but it would be nice if she also had a soul. Too much to ask? I'll have to come back here to test the dinner menu, but I think I'll wait until AFTER I eat at every other Boulder restaurant, cafe and 7-11. Thanks so much."
Oscar D.,"Denver, NC",6,11,2,1.0,7/30/2017,"We were in Boulder for the day with some friends and thought we stop at cheesecake factory since we know we like their food. Everything started out okay, the bartender came over and got us drinks and got us some bread. Then we waited and waited after a while we noticed that no one in the restaurant was getting your food. At around after waiting about 45 minutes and looking around to see if we were going to be served the manager finally came over and told us that they were a little bit backed up in the kitchen and our food willwill be out in five minutes. He didn't apologize or offer any kind of a restitution. We then noticed that he was doing the same to each table. Our waiter was not very attentive and when we told told him that we were tired of waiting he just kind of laughed it off.  It looks like they were shorthanded and poorly managed so most tables did not get the attention that would be expected, we certainly didn't. Also the bathrooms were dirty and no one seemed to care and the food was under cooked, when it finally came out. Overall it was about an hour and 40 minutes before we were done with our meal."
Ryan H.,"Fort Collins, CO",32,183,412,5.0,11/16/2016,"With such a vast menu and options, it is hard to go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. I love their menu and the vast amounts of offerings.  My go to menu items are the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  The cheesecake is amazing and always amazing. All the flavors are good.  I like the easy going vibe at this location and the setting is beautiful and well situated with ample parking.  This is a great place to eat for the entire family."
Le C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"I took my wife here for her birthday and although the server was a very nice kid...there was a huge issue. First, my kid ordered a hamburger well done and it came out rare.  Not cool!   Secondly my wife used to love their Potato soup and it was on the menu this day.  She ordered it and the Server brought it to the table.  She took a few bites and noticed something was not right.  She asked the Server why it tasted so strange and he took it back to the kitchen. Get this...he came back with this explanation...the kitchen ran out of potato soup and just substituted it for clam chowder!  Did not tell her just sort of made that decision for her.  Well my wife hates sea food and became very sickened at the fact that she was duped into eating a meal she did not want. The manger took a few bucks off the meal and explained that the kitchen will sub foods it runs out of. Sometimes they won't ask or tell you that you are eating something you did not order! No more of this place!  Can't be trusted!  Thanks for the Birthday dinner CF!"
Leslie P.,"Boulder, CO",61,10,,5.0,4/29/2017,"I've been eating here for almost 10 years.  Their wait staff and management is very profession and friendly.  I've even had a waitress put quarters in my parking meter so I wouldn't have to leave my table.  Seriously!   Everyone knows the food choices are overwhelming but that's really a negative is it? They have grilled tofu substitute options and if you're a regular like me, management occasionally gives me a free lunch which is pretty darn awesome."
Vance S.,"Siloam Springs, AR",7,35,17,1.0,5/30/2017,"What a poor experience, we went in 1 hr prior to closing, sat at the bar....no question that as soon as we sat the bartender was ready for us to leave so she could close!  This is a individual assessment....not a restaurant one.  This bartender sucked....  food...had 2 apps and 2 drinks.  Meh....will not return here for sure....popular name...very poor experience."
Ben K.,"Boulder, CO",93,1,,5.0,10/28/2017,This restaurant proves that slavery was bad. The cheesecake was extremely velvety and made me fully happy. I shoved that cheesecake down my throat faster than you can say ballsack!
Karen S.,"Denver, CO",129,139,,3.0,6/23/2017,"Used to be one of my favs. Loved the huge menu, great food and huge portions. When I went here I realized they are a jack of all meals but master of none. Portions were medium. I got the Thai wraps, Thai pasta and chicken parm pizza. The last one was not good. The first two were decent but you get much better Asian food at an Asian rest. The waiter talked me out of the dish I was orig going to get and suggested the crappy ckn parm pizza. Other than that, the service was fine. $8-9 for a slice of cheesecake? I could buy a whole one for that at Costco."
Chan R.,"Windermere, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Had a terrible experience here for my brothers birthday. I had family visiting from another country and we wanted a special meal out to celebrate a birthday. It was awful.  The server was extremely rude and nonchalant, almost like we were a bother to her. Some of the meals came out cold (one pasta dish (that's was for a child!), and two steak dishes). They were taken away and said they would be remade. When they came out it was obvious they had just been reheated. The pasta was rubbery and still had the cheese on that was added after it got to the table and the steaks came out well done, when they were initially medium.  The server kept saying ""whatever"" without a care in the world and the so called manager just came out with a creepy smile and acted like everything was great! We ended up paying a rather hefty bill with no apology just ""whatever"" from the server. We didn't want to cause a scene since it was a birthday celebration but thanks to this location it was ruined. Have never had an experience like this at a Cheesecake Factory before. Very disappointed."
S. K.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",0,17,5,5.0,6/12/2017,"This place is great, the food is so good.  The bartenders are ALWAYS on it and Colton..  what can I say.  Keeps moving with a smile on his face, such a gentleman as well.  Can't go wrong!!"
Joseph U.,"Denver, CO",53,64,43,5.0,4/10/2017,"Great way to spend a Saturday! Walk the pearl street mall, watch some of the street performers then off for a fun dining experience! Fresh baked bread, steak was perfectly cooked and the choices of cheesecake are mouth watering! I chose the lemon meringue and it was gone in a matter of seconds! Service was good but not great. Still good enough to earn 5 stars from me!"
Mona K.,"Denver, CO",178,231,310,3.0,2/28/2016,"Great location and ambiance!  While the menus are extensive and have a ton of variety, what the Cheesecake Factory does best is, of course, cheesecake. Highly recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough; its life changing!!!"
Elaine J.,"Brighton, CO",0,17,1,5.0,4/25/2017,You can never go wrong here. Everything is wonderful. The cheesecake is to die for. I've been to Lodo's too. Great service great food.
Amy C.,"Broomfield, CO",0,7,3,4.0,10/18/2016,"We had a birthday dinner Sunday night.  5 people 3 great meals, one late one fair shrimp taste like it was pre cooked.  The cheesecake was great though.  The 30 anniversary one is great.  Our Server was v"
Erin V.,"Superior, CO",0,124,69,5.0,8/30/2016,"We stopped in for drinks and appetizers before a concert.  My Asian pear martini with sake and passion fruit was so good!  The food came quick even tho they were busy, and tasted delicious.   Our server was friendly and professional.   The bathroom was also clean. Five stars!"
Sean R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/21/2017,"My buddy and I made a special trip to CF with the intention of having a nice brunch before we each take are respective flights home. We order at 10:05 only to have to wait 35 minuets for our omelets. The side of breakfast potatoes amounted to 7-8 tiny pieces, maybe 3 bites. The toast came UNBUTTERED only to be given rock hard butter after flagging down the waiter. The omelets themselves were bland. The bacon, onion, mushroom and cheese were one goop thrown in the middle of an egg blanket. Finally, the waiter never checked back in, never refilled our drinks, and seemed disinterested in service. Denny's has a better quality and customer service experience; at 1/2 the price."
Michelle P.,"Boulder, CO",6,24,4,1.0,6/11/2016,"Horrible, horrible service. Our waiter ignored us at every turn. He took orders for people who came in after us and would let them know the specials and what's good. When he finally took our order there was none of that. It took forever to get bread. It felt like he was being really ageist. We got absolutely nothing. I don't even know his name because he didn't introduce himself or anything. Also I'm pretty sure the woman who brought out our food was sick. She could barely talk and that's usually because of a virus. Great. A woman with a virus served our food. I will NEVER be coming back. Such a shame because I love the cheesecake factory in Danbury and Boston."
Werner B.,"Denver, CO",4,84,32,3.0,2/13/2017,"Due to lines everywhere else Friday night on Pearl Street we ended up at The Cheesecake Factory. Always a good standby. Seated fast. Restaurant was rather hot, had to take off sweaters and roll up our sleeves to survive the temps. Ordered the 4 cheese pasta and the avocado toast. Food quality was as expected. Really wanted the roasted veggie sandwich but that was no longer on the menu so a bit disappointed. Staff seemed a bit overwhelmed and we waited for our food about 30 minutes. Although busy, our waitress was nice and very helpful."
Jon P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,98,,3.0,3/10/2017,Nice place for lunch. We a\had a very nice meal outside on the small patio they have. Great for people watching as they stroll Pearl St. The lunch specials are a deal. Great service.
Garry P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",43,4,,4.0,12/27/2016,"Have tried several things on the menu and so far it's been hard to disappoint.  Consistency is definitely the key here and the ambiance is nice. Dishes always taste the same and always good, portions are decent. Biggest pet peeve is the prices.  Food is good but find it hard pressed spending over $100 for 3 sandwiches, 1 alcohol drink and 2 pieces of cheesecake."
Kate H.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",0,49,,4.0,12/31/2016,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory. Our server was great and the food was delicious. (The beer is overpriced- $7 for a fat tire but we just won't get beer next time.) I deducted one star because I received a smaller slice of the chocolate truffle tower cake than I usually get at other locations. I've had this cake at least 6 times, and it's always been a HUGE slice. The one I got from this location was a little bigger than half the normal size. And since I got it to share it was a little disappointing."
Stevie H.,"Broomfield, CO",0,3,1,4.0,1/23/2017,"Not as expected. Expectations were at least a short wait at noon, but to my delight we got right in. The beverages were tasty and kept full. Our appy was flavorful with the tex-mex eggrolls w/ a pico, lime and ranch sauce. Kobe burger was awesome, southwest chicken sandwiche was also . Our waiter Ryan did a great job. It was a satisfactory visit"
Sam A.,"Longmont, CO",0,12,,1.0,4/13/2016,"Have come here for the last 3 1/2 years and I'm sad to say it has gotten so much worse every visit that I am compelled to post this review, I don't believe I've ever posted a 1 star review. Food quality is horrible and the waitress was easy to say most things here are frozen or pre-prepped off site and warmed up here - gross. Service has become very condescending and rude. Manager wasn't any help at all. Also, be aware if your child has food allergies they will make her/him feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed."
Jose S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,1,4.0,7/13/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is centrally located on pearl street mall. We had an amazing experience, our waiter was very nice and attentive. We order the Avocado Egg Rolls for appetizer and they were really good, they have gotten smaller and smaller with time but still good. We also order lemon raspberry for dessert and it was great. The only negative about this restaurant is the parking, since is right on the mall street it can get difficult to find parking."
Amy E.,"South Boulder, CO",889,258,,2.0,2/10/2015,"I'm updating my last review based on a recent experience with the service at CF. My previous review regarding the food still stands, so please take a look at it for that aspect. We'd always had good service at this CF, but our most recent experience was fairly terrible. We visited around 4:30pm on Friday, February 6. The place was mostly empty, but there was no hostess at the front. We waited a few minutes. The manager (I believe) finally walked by and helped us. (We appreciated that, because some managers at some places think they are too good to fill in at lesser positions.) We took a seat in the bar area. Our server came by fairly quickly, and though she seemed frazzled and scatter-brained, she was also pleasant. We ordered two cocktails. After we did, she made an odd little comment. ""I'll probably end up making them,"" she said. But we didn't pay much attention to that. Then we waited. And waited. No drinks. Usually, at this CF, drinks arrive quickly. We could see the bartender behind the bar. A white guy with closely cropped hair and a bushy beard. But he wasn't making drinks. He was rummaging around under the bar, over and over again. So, there Sweetie and I were, talking. Music was playing quite loudly. We were sitting as far from the bar itself as possible (on the south side), when, through the noise and distance and over our conversation, we heard the bartender loudly say, ""F**k this s**t.""  Wow, okay. The table next to us, containing about 12 Muslim women and little girls in hijabs, all stopped talking and turned to look. The bartender was crashing and banging things behind the bar, pulling things out from underneath, slamming them around. Nice. Then, again very loudly, he said, ""F**k happy hour."" Even nicer. And he just kept rattling and slamming and banging things.  Needless to say, the entire atmosphere was very unpleasant at that point. Not a nice relaxing Friday anymore. Finally, we could see the bartender making our drinks. But he was clearly royally pissed off, making the drinks with no care. That became even clearer when the drinks arrived. The mint leaves in my mojito hadn't been muddled, just thrown in as an afterthought, so the resulting concoction had no mint flavor. The entire drink tasted like nothing but simple syrup- extremely sweet with no flavor of any kind. I tried muddling the mint with my straw, but that didn't help much. I've never sent back a drink before, anywhere, but I sent this one back. We had already ordered food. When it arrived, we ate a little of it, but soon had the rest packaged to go. We just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. We paid and scurried away, glad to be the f**k away from there!"
Gideon M.,"Boulder, CO",19,1,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Wow, what an incompetent manager and utterly castrated or maybe just clueless and immature staff.   We're told they'll have a table for 8 in 20 minutes. A full hour later, after we have asked for the third time, we were finally told the tables are not ready because they're ""unstable and unsafe"" and that the staff is ""waiting for silverware."" If the tables are unstable, shouldn't they be removed immediately?! If 20 min. turned into 1 hour (or even 30-40 min.), shouldn't the manager offer some appetizers for free? No apology; no explanations; no leadership; and certainly no heart or mind at all.  BTW, the place was fumigated, and the smell (beyond the hostess counter) was unbearable."
Robert R.,"Boulder, CO",8,4,,5.0,3/19/2016,"Went to Cheesecake Factory as part of an ASL deaf event with about 15 friends. We've experienced really horrible waiters in the past for these events at other restaurants, but Robert, our Cheesecake waiter was EXCELLENT. He gave every single one of us: deaf, hard of hearing, or not, equal and undivided attention when taking our orders.  He was calm, soft-spoken, and patient. The food and drinks were of course, delicious as we've come to expect from this location. We'll be back."
Andrew N.,"Austin, TX",38,165,1381,2.0,12/23/2014,"So I'm probably one of the few visitors to Boulder that dared to eat at a chain restaurant while visiting such a gastronomically rich city, but I did. And I did it more than once hoping that each time it would get better. And it didn't. I'm not going to write a long review because I would be merely regurgitating what other reviews are saying. I will simply reiterate that service is spotty. There are either too many or too few waiters. You either get a genuinely nice waiter or someone that just ""wants to do their job"" and nothing more. I went there went it was busy and I waited, I went when it wasn't busy and I waited the same amount of time."
Isaac S.,"Westminster, CO",0,1,,2.0,11/27/2016,"Came here on Saturday, and it sucked. The hostess' were ""eh"": passive-aggressively rude and seemed to not care about their customers.  They said the wait was 20 minutes and it turned out to be close to 40. (Not that big of an issue as it was busy and I understand if no one was leaving.) Our waitress was not the best either. I feel bad saying this but she was very awkward and rarely checked up on us. I don't want to be mean at all, the experience was just uncomfortable. They ran out of fish and made us pick something else. Very inconvenient. In addition, the food was decent, but made me and my girlfriend sick.  Overall, just a bad experience. Would not recommend."
Emily C.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,10/25/2016,"Bad service and even worse food. I spent $100 on HORRIBLE cocktails + appetizers. The drinks were so bad, overly sweet and underpoured. The food wasn't cooked well. It sucks when you order something from a restaurant that you know you could have done better at home.  I'm so disappointed with this experience. I've loved every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to, but after going here I will choose any other restaurant possible."
Theresa H.,"Westminster, CO",0,26,,2.0,4/15/2017,"Disappointing, At 7:15 already out of Sangria and the parmigiano chicken sandwich. And the Boulder attitude, if you don't come back no skin off our back."
Ellen D.,"Johnstown, CO",0,6,,1.0,12/15/2016,"Poor choice of dining:  stale bread, limp and old lettuce, hard chicken, very slow service and uncaring waiter.  Will never go here again."
Antonia W.,"Capitola, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/8/2016,"Just want to ask Cheesecake Factory to get their own WiFi. Several times, I have come in for a meal and could not do some really important work. I would come in there a lot more often if I could easily access WiFi since they do have a large menu and they are open late. Many others must have experienced this as well and it has probably affected their business. Solving this tech issue would be a big help to the Cheesecake Factory and all it's customers."
