Kasey H.,"Spokane, WA",0,8,,1.0,8/6/2012,"Went here on 8/3/12 while vacationing in Colorado with my boyrfriend. We had already had dinner & walked the strip mall on Pearl, & dropped into the Cheesecake Factory for dessert. We're from the Eastern part of Washington state, so we've never been to one before. The service was fine, but by the time the check came, we were astounded. Expected about a $20-30 tab, & the total came to $43.99!  The breakdown of the check was as follows: One strawberry lemon drop for $11,50 (I've never paid that much for a mixed drink before in my life, even in the ritziest places; plus it tasted horrible, & was less than half the size of the Long Island), one Long Island Iced Tea for $9.25, one Reese's peanut butter cheesecake for $8, one peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for $7, & ala mode (ice cream) for $5. The ice cream, instead of being a $2 add-on for my boyrfriend's plate, came in a separate bowl with 2 piddly scoops of ice cream that would barely be larger than a teaspoon each.  My boyfriend could have sworn the menu said his drink was $6.75, which was why he ordered it, but when I asked the waitress, she brought back the menu to show us, & it was a different menu than we had ordered from (we had the full menu, which included drinks; she brought us a separate drink menu only). I resigned myself to the horrific bill & we paid it, but I made the check out for $46 even, with a $2.01 tip. I realize now that it may seem contentious to sign a bill with a 2.01 tip, but at the time, I was only thinking of making the amount a whole number, & yes, I wasn't going to tip overabundantly for an outrageous bill. When I checked my bank account today, now that I'm home, I found that they charged me $47! It isn't the extra dollar that pisses me off; it's the general experience altogether. I thought for a moment that they may have misunderstood my writing, but I write very clearly & it would be difficult to interpret a ""2"" as a ""3"" in the tip, & even more so to see a ""7"" instead of a ""6"" on the total. This has happened to me before, though, at other restaurants where I was slighted, & I think wait staff will do this since most people won't contest a dollar overcharge. In addition to the bill fiasco, my boyfriend & I chose to dine outside, since the weather was so nice. About 5 feet out from the outdoor seating fence, was a pair of facing benches, on which a group of about 5-10 hippies lounged with their dog. Apart from the overly loud conversation they were having about not working for ""the man"" & the politics of the world, when one of the tables near us vacated, one of the women snuck over to the fence, vaulted over barefoot (I'm not a prejudiced person in general, but this girl reeked like she hadn't showered in months), & grabbed the plate of leftover food the customers had left. She vaulted back over the fence & proceeded to eat it by hand with her fellows. The part that almost made me lose my stomach, though, was that the dog was one of her ""fellows"", & they were letting the dog get up & lick the plate & food in the same places they proceeded to lick it from. It was not an enjoyable experience, & what surprised me more was that none of the wait staff said anything to them, giving me the impression that my food was likely to be ripped off the table at any moment.  The only decent things to relate: they are open late, which is nice. The waitress, before the bill came, was friendly, & the cheesecake was awesome, though expensive. Despite that, we both plan on being back in the area in the next few months, & suffice it to say, never plan on dining there again. We felt completely misled & walked out of there feeling robbed. Although on this trip the per-person fare was less than $61, we realized that if we had dined there & had dessert, plus drinks, it would have been well over that amount."
Erin H.,"Englewood, CO",266,519,854,2.0,5/15/2011,"All of my visits to the Cheesecake Factory have been ok.  The food isn't bad, but it certainly isn't anything special either.  On the plus side, you can find something to please just about anyone as their menu is almost as long as the phonebook.  In my opinion, they'd be better off reducing the number and types of choices and focusing on doing a few things really well, but hey, it's a chain.  I don't go often so it always takes me forever to get through the menu, which I don't like.  But, again, the food has always been ok and the cheesecake is usually good.  The thing about this particular location is that there are so many other restaurants I like nearby that I'm always disappointed when people want to go here."
Mtb C.,"CO, CO",55,340,,3.0,9/7/2010,"Wow, it's been years since Cheesecake Factory was even an idea for a Saturday night dinner.  But sometime hunger can do strange things to a person... Well the place still has what it takes to be a decent dinner location.  Great service, gigantic menu with lots of choices and a great location.  I have to say I'm not a fan of the size of the menu or the ads but heck, you get a lot of choices if you're with picky eaters.  The proportions are huge so we usually split a dish and get an appetizer.  Location is great on the Pearl Street Mall so if you choose not to get cheesecake for dessert you can hit up other places along the mall.  I say give it a try and don't let the ""C"" word discourage you.  (chain)"
Anita Y.,"Berthoud, CO",57,311,13,4.0,7/19/2010,"Brunch on the patio on a hot summer day.  I have no complaints. Service on spot on. The food was delicious; we tried the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Strawberries and the Crab Hash with Poached Eggs and Hollandaise. Real, fresh strawberries. Not a syrup-y frozen concoction. Real crab meat, not K-rab from a kani roll. It was so delectable, we cleaned our plates (although our "" hot day"" sensibilities were crying out for a more judicious serving) set off for home on auto-pilot under the hot July sun, and settled in for a post-feast nap."
Josh B.,"Wildernest, CO",1,7,,5.0,11/30/2013,"Great late-lunch, early-dinner service.  Accommodating and friendly staff.  The food was terrific.  Affordable and fun."
Michelle P.,"Westminster, CO",19,116,25,4.0,9/9/2010,"How can you go wrong with Cheesecake Factory? There is something for everyone there - have you seen the menu? It takes about 20 minutes to decided what the hell to order.  We arrived STARVING! Bread and butter were yummy and so were our drinks. For the appetizer, we ordered shrimp tempura. Super good and crunchy. Loved the green onions they place on top and the tipping sauce complemented the shrimp.  For dinner I ordered their chicken carbonara. Loved the creaminess and bacon bites in the dish. I thought they did an excellent job of making it - one of the best I have had. They brought my hubby's shrimp pasta jambalaya half ways through my meal. The waitress said that there were too many jambalaya ordered that the cook missed one and it happened to be my husbands. Fortunately they didn't charge us for the dish.  For dessert, hands down: Tres-Leches Cheesecake!"
Noelle B.,"Boulder, CO",8,113,1,3.0,3/14/2010,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in both Chicago and Denver.  It was several years ago and I remember the place being fancy and delicious.  I didn't get the same experience last night at the Boulder Cheesecake Factory. First, I think the menu is ridiculously long.  I'm sure the menu has always been that long but it was insane. Next, the bread was disappointing.  It was very cold and was served with packets of butter you'd find in a diner.  I expected more from the Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend and I both had burgers.  That's why I bumped my review up to three stars.  The food was good.  It wasn't anything truly amazing but I did like the different types of burgers they served.  It was very creative.   Fortunately the Cheesecake was spectacular.  We had a plain cheesecake with fresh strawberries and it didn't disappoint.  At least CF is still serving their signature dish just right. Two more things.  One, we were disappointed in the glassware.  We were served our water in plastic mugs that you may find at Chili's.  They were cloudy with use.  We thought a place that touts itself to be 'classy' would at least serve us water in glasses. And two, the music was TERRIBLE.  We heard everything from Kelly Clarkson to Janet Jackson to some rock music and then easy listening.  The music was loud and didn't quite fit the ambiance of any restaurant.  Something low and mellow would have been much better. My experience there felt very much like I was at a chain restaurant.  I know CF is a chain, but in the past it's never felt like that."
Kent R.,"Boulder, CO",2,122,,1.0,7/30/2010,Mediocre food at good food prices.  A menu laden with ads to increase the sense of consumerism. Indifferent staff who can't wait to get off work. What's not to love?
John C.,"Boulder, CO",1,7,,5.0,12/14/2009,"OK people, how can you give this place a bad review? If you're a chain-hater, kindly recuse yourself and refrain from writing a bad review just out of principle. This restaurant should be judged for what it is, a casual restaurant that offers tasty food at a reasonable (but ot cheap) price in a timely manner. Let me tell you my credentials first. I've been to this place at least 200 times over the last several years. Sure, every experience wasn't perfect, but I can say with high statistical reliability that the service is good 95% of the time. Without going to a 4 or 5 star restaurant, you just don't get that kind of reliability anywhere else. I will say that during the evening hours on peak dining out days, the service gets strained by the sheer volume of traffic they handle. I usually take a late lunch during the week or midday on a weekend. Some of my favorite food choices are the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. That is some serious chomp! Oh, and the Miso Salmon is to die for. Not just to die for, it's to kill for. the Navajo Sandwich is a tasy lunch treat; try it with cooked carrots instead of the fries for a more healthy version. I really can't remember the last time I ordered something I didn't like there. I seem to remember some sort of Asian dish that had too much sauce... The portions are ridiculously huge. My biggest challenge is getting out of there without feeling like a whale. An appetizer will do fine if you're not that hungry. Otherwise, force yourself to take some home with you.  Besides a bewildering array of cheesecakes, they have other scrumptious desserts. Chris' Outrageous Cake is, well, outrageously delicious. Prices are not cheap. $7 for a slice of cheesecake, for example. However, I am willing to pay extra for consistently good service and food that is consistently delicious. And you will never be hungry an hour later, unless you are half grizzly bear and are nearing hibernation time. I'm a booth man, and this place is loaded with booths. Big ones, little ones, medium ones. Oh, and did I mention the restrooms are clean and nice, with those fancy automatic faucets and extra high privacy walls between the urinals? Nice!"
Kelsey O.,"Lafayette, CO",120,23,30,4.0,1/11/2013,"I love going to cheese cake factory. Lunch portions are huge! Server are very friendly and helpful. Of course, the cheesecake is decadent!"
Jim N.,"Winchester, KY",22,498,13,4.0,7/16/2010,"Great lunch here after shopping a few hours on Pearl Street, en-route from Estes Park to Colorado Springs.  We've been fans of Cheesecake Factory for year; but, this was our grandkids' first visit.  They had great meals, good lemonade, and fries....they were very happy; adults had a mixture of things, all excellent.  Prices were pretty reasonable, considering how much food is served.  We took home enough for lunch the next day.  This is a solid choice for lunch or dinner.....don't be afraid to share a plate or a salad (they're that large)"
Phil M.,"Erie, CO",13,36,20,5.0,6/16/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is awesome.  I really don't understand giving this place any less than 3 stars - those that do must be food snobs or chain haters.  The menu is extensive which reminds me of the diners back East where I grew up and nothing like anything else you will see in the Dencer/Boulder area. I've been here several times (as well as the Denver location which is the exact same experience as the Boulder location except maybe Denver is more crowded) and each time the food has been delicious, service has been awesome, and the atmosphere/ambience perfect. --BEGIN RANT-- I'm really sort of getting sick of the automatic 2-star deduction that some people give chains.  I like a local/unique restaurant as much as the next guy but when many of the local options are far inferior (not the case for Boulder typically, I admit) I am glad to have these options in town! --END RANT-- Oh, and the cheesecake (and selection thereof) is amazing!"
Sarah K.,"Richmond, VA",348,315,300,2.0,1/28/2010,"Mediocre food that's gone down-hill over the past few years. I used to think this place was incredible; now I feel that it's typical, sub-par and overwhelmingly chicken-oriented.  The ads in their menu makes the place appear as a sell-out--why am I interested in jewelry when I'm supposed to be choosing a meal from your rediculous 20-page menu?  The waitstaff mingle in small groups between serving and occasionally look over your shoulder (a little too frequently) while gossiping about the latest staff-related drama.  Save it for the kitchen.  I ordered teriyaki chicken; the skin was rubbery and the chicken was wierdly shaped--didn't know chicken breast grew with two drumbstick bones sitcking out on either side.  Luckily (sorta...) the rice was swimming in teriyaki sauce (the best part of my meal) so that moistened the meat a bit.  I felt ill the rest of the night. The other people in my party didn't rave about their food either. It all seemed very typical with little creative flair--proof that the chefs are trained to crank out the hundreds of dishes on the menu all day and with little enthusiasm.  Definitely speaks to the ""Factory"" aspect of the place."
Evil S.,"Cleveland, OH",2,58,18,5.0,9/18/2012,Eaten here twice in the last year and both times the service was great and the sticker shock on the food passed when the giant plate was brought out.
Ricky S.,"Longmont, CO",5,38,,2.0,11/17/2010,"High price low quality. Pasta is too oil. I just can't eat more after I had a quarter. Cheese cake is not as good as expected. Two cream flowers are big enough but I'm here to have cakes but not the cream. Strawberry topping can only be admired but not tasted. Cheese is soft. Maybe it's just the style I don't like. In such a kind of quality and price, we got the table by waiting for 20 minutes."
Leslie R.,"Leadville, CO",1,57,,5.0,5/8/2012,"The best food on the planet! Its my FAVORITE restaurant! & I have a lot of favorites! The Boulder Cheesecake Factory is overly crowded with no where to wait for tables, that's a pain, & the waiters/waitress & hosts are friendly but not over the top friendly. But they're good! & the restaurant itself is CLEAN, great atmosphere & FANTASTIC food! Definitely recommend ANY Cheesecake Factory!!!"
Shawn S.,"Evergreen, CO",109,166,25,4.0,3/13/2012,"Food is always AMAZING and the service is equally so.  I do wish, however, that they would just drop their prices a bit and not make each meal enough to feed a family of 4!  Pasta is typically great as a leftover but nothing is ever as good as it is fresh..so just feel like I waste so much food when I go here.  I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce. YUMMMY!  And we tried the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake which made my ass grow just by looking at it but I still licked the plate :)  All-in-all..a safe bet for a great meal and good service along with a guaranteed necessary trip to the gym the next day."
Suzie S.,"Parker, CO",0,158,,3.0,7/31/2012,"After falling in love with their location in Park Meadows I chose the Boulder location to celebrate my son's graduation with a large group of family. The server for our table was conscientious but can't say that for the rest of the support staff up front. Very disappointing and not interested in our comfort. At a cost of $200 for the nite, I felt we deserved some effort.  The food here was good but overpriced. It was not nearly as good as the Park Meadows location and I admit I had second thoughts on my choice after our meal was served. I tried the new black bean burger that took the place of my favorite portobello sandwich and not impressed. I would prefer smaller portions on most items and lower prices so that I could enjoy a meal plus the tasty desserts.  As always the expansive menu can be overwhelming.  Cheesecake is always excellent. Would I go here again, probably not. Parking was down the street in garage and managers did not comp parking tickets like in downtown Denver so that was additional expense for all of us. Would I recommend this place, not likely when the Pearl Street Mall has many options that would likely provide better customer service and quality of food. But take me to Park Meadows and I would be quick to patronize that branch."
Mo C.,"Denver, CO",528,804,72,5.0,7/16/2009,"The food at Cheesecake Factory is just always fantastic. This is a chain that has high standards and I for one appreciate that. The passion fruit iced tea is always great. This time around I had the grilled salmon lunch with asparagus and green beans (instead of rice). Yum! The patio at this location is particularly cool, as it faces Pearl Street, which is great for people watching. Unfortunately, your meal will get interrupted occasionally by those looking for a couple of bucks for various reasons. But, there are often street performers with everything from juggling to instrumentals to breaking dancing. Just a cool spot. PS- Try the low carb cheesecake! It is phenomenal! My cousin said it was better than the Kaluha one she ordered :)"
Elise M.,"Durango, CO",5,66,,2.0,8/7/2009,"It seemed for the longest time that I was the only person on earth that hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory. During parent weekend in Boulder our group of about 25 adolescents and parents decided to give it a shot. The menu is the one of the most overwhelming things I have ever seen. It's like a short novel of sub-par food. Now that I've been there a couple times, I feel wrong every time I order something, because I haven't even read the other half of the menu. Plus, it's filled with advertisements! An ad for Bob the plumber is the last thing I want to look at when I'm ordering my food. It's cluttered and annoying. When the food does come, I won't lie, it isn't terrible. It's just so overwhelmingly mediocre. The plates are plain (I usually like a good looking plate of food) and most of the food is deep fried. I usually leave satisfied, but with a stomach ache. I try to order the cheesecake every time I go because that is, after all, the point of the place. It's alright. I just feel like if one type of food is the shining glory of a restaurant, it should blow me away when I eat it, not make me feel like I'm eating gourmet playdough."
