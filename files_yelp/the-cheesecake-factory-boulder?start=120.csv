Becky S.,"Wolfeboro, NH",210,448,21,3.0,1/6/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory in Boulder is no different than any other.  I rather enjoy their pork chops.  I also really enjoy their patio, it's right there on Pearl Street so it's great people watching.  There's also a small room to the left when you walk in that provides for a small-restaurant feel instead of the usual dining hall feel of other C.F. locations.   I've never gotten bad service, but everything about this place is just average.  Except the patio, that's great.  Drinks could be a little cheaper."
Mrs D.,"Broomfield, CO",0,9,1,3.0,6/18/2012,"LARGEST PORTIONS EVER! Will feed me for a week, so long as I'm ok with eating mediocre food this week  :)"
FX H.,"Broomfield, CO",6,134,1,4.0,10/9/2011,"Good food, fast service, meal was present and cook as order,... Excellent food but service was little lack of attention due busy...."
Colie J.,"Lafayette, CO",13,208,105,3.0,2/27/2009,"It is with a heavy heart I give this particular CF 3 out of 5 stars.  I have only ever had issues at 4 out of the 20+ I have visited. This one's food is really hit or miss.  I ordered a Sunday Brunch breakfast style Monte Cristo that I had at Ceasar's in LV and this one's bread was soggy.  Sent it back and it came out just a little more cooked than the first time, but still soggy.  I was so excited to be living in a place with a CF again.  I have been about 6 times and 2 or 3 the food just hasn't been up to par with my other experiences.   My favorite dish is stuffed chicken tortillas, but at any other CF EVERYTHING on the menu is good. They have a pretty good bar menu from 4-6 M-F where smaller appetizers are served for $3-6. If you are in a city with a CF try it, just with this one I can't vouch it will be a good day."
Hallie M.,"Louisville, CO",4,27,1,2.0,7/22/2008,"I went because a friend fell in love with one of their chicken dishes and wanted me to experience the place.  I generally avoid all chains. The bread before the meal was very tasty, can't go wrong with hot bread.  Unfortunately while the tables around us were eating their bread while looking over the menu I had to ask our waiter to bring us some when we ordered our entrees. I got a lunch special of the day, catfish breaded in pecans, and expected it to be along the same price of the regular lunch specials, ten or so dollars.  When the bill came my meal was sixteen dollars!  The fish was pretty good, but catfish is a cheap fish.  They gave me enough potatoes to serve a family, which I didn't need.  I'd have preferred an overload of veggies. I shared a piece of tiramisu cheesecake.  It was alright, nothing to make me ignore all of the great food of Boulder to go back and have again though."
Robin P.,"Boulder, CO",5,18,23,4.0,7/26/2010,"Great lunches!  Very large for the price and great variety. I don't like cheesecake much, but I love the key lime cheesecake. I like the BBQ salad more than the oriental chicken salad."
Mark M.,"Boulder, CO",22,111,5,4.0,12/26/2006,"How incredibly disappointing - the big chain pulls through with a very good meal. My son stared at my wife and I in disbelief , wondering who had invaded our shells - we wanted to go try the Cheesecake Factory.  The ethnic, local, organic, mom and pop, crew was going corporate.   I went with an open mind and was surprised by my experience.  Greeted by a team 5+ bubbly teens who quickly and efficiently seated us in a window booth that proved to be quite and comfortable. Down side was the kiddy mess smashed into the window from the prior party. Waitress was quick with water, (2 no ice - one with with out batting an eye)  specials of the night and our drink order (local fix of  Fat Tire).  Our initial drink order was accompanied by the prompt reply of ""Noooo Problem"" our first of night of her seemly universal response to any request , order or question.   But I got used to it  ""Nooo Problem"". With only three people and the knowledge that the portions were huge we ordered three things.  All came out quickly. I put aside my snooty chain predisposition and realized that everything we ordered was great: Tuna Salad Tataki - Very rare seared tuna with lettuce, big beefsteak tomatoes (ripe mid-winter after a blizzard of 06), and avocado in a light Asian dressing.   Ranch burger - Big - bigger than big - giant.  Cooked med-rare. Great flavor texture with thick crispy bacon, mushrooms, and cheese.  The portion of fries seemed diminutive compared to the burger. Chicken wraps - Grilled chicken, beautiful bib lettuce, grated carrot and marinated cucumber, and noodles.  Three sauces for dipping each rated very good compared with other ""real"" Asian restaurants. None of us like cheese cake so we did not sample the name sake.   Overall better than even my low expectations would have thought.  I will go back for the times when like the other reviewer state ""you want to make sure everybody comes out happy""."
Michelle N.,"Cardiff, CA",57,108,6,4.0,9/8/2007,"I get a tid bit nostalgic when I am on Pearl Street at the Cheesecake factory.. memories of college brunches, lunches and dinners roll through my dome and I smile.  Being back in Boulder for a short visit, I happily ended up here for dinner.  The menu was awesome and abundantly full of options, even for me with all of my food allergies.   Brit, our server was AMAZING!  I can't even recall the last time that I had such good service.  She was especially accommodating of my allergies, so I made sure to tip her well.   We ordered the sliders for an appetizer.  They were incredible.  Until last night, I had forgotten how damn good sliders are!  No joke, I am now thinking of hosting Friday slider night.  The drinks were well endowed with liquor, and the latte was just what I needed before hitting up the Pearl Street bars.  The quesidilla and orange chicken entrees were good, but we might be more adventurous with our selection upon the next visit.     I love Boulder and I think that it has the best Cheesecake Factory of the entire chain.. at least from what I have experienced."
Neil A.,"Broomfield, CO",0,41,,4.0,3/12/2011,"If my most recent visit had been my first to this location, I would have given it only 3 stars. However, on the strength of earlier experience with this and other locations, I am holding the line at 4. Obviously, this place can be a characature of itself, with the monstrous portions and epic broad-ranging menu. Still, I don't think it's fair to just look at that and dismiss it out-of-hand. If you get something that reheats well, the value is very good as you can often get 2-3 meals out of one visit. With the size of the menu, not everything is going to be great, but there are some nice dishes to be found amongst all of that. The latest experience was a bit of an adventure. The 2-year old had 45 minutes of running around outside during the wait and was a bit hyper (chucked a plate onto the floor, breaking it). After we ordered entrees, another server came up with a couple of random plates of food, thinking they were for us. A couple of minutes later, the actual entrees came, but the server had mistook my order, so I had a while to watch my wife eat before they finally got my order (shepherd's pie) correct. I've had it before here, and generally like the dish. It was fine this time, but not as good as I've had other times here.  When we got to dessert, it got really interesting. While we figured out cheesecake for ourselves, we ordered sliced strawberries for the little one. That took about 15 minutes(!) to come out, and the cheesecake we ordered took at least another 15 minutes. The waiter was very apologetic, saying that the bakery was backed up and that they had some new people up there so things weren't going great. I'm generally pretty forgiving about these things, but it is hard for me to imagine a job requiring much less skill than what we needed from the bakery: 1) Slice strawberries in half (if they aren't presliced), toss them on a plate and put some whipped cream 2) Slice a premade cheesecake (which is probably also presliced), toss it on a plate and put some whipped cream 3) There is no 3 - you are done! What did you think, you're cooking a risotto or a filet mignon or something? Very odd. Anyway, the waiter was very apologetic, but didn't choose to do even a slight bill adjustment after all the screw-ups. We didn't request or necessarily expect anything, but it would have been a nice gesture after the various problems."
Carl S.,"Denver, CO",89,96,10,2.0,12/14/2009,"I ate here once with my then fiance. I had fish and chips and it was horrible. I don't remember what she had but I don't think she was very happy either. My fish was cold and the batter had separated from the fish. That means, overcooked... The fish itself was also separating. I'm just really glad we had a gift cert. so our dinner was only a few dollars. I won't ever eat at this place again."
David Z.,"Baltimore, MD",6,74,,3.0,5/19/2006,"Well, it's hardly a local business, but with the huge menu of mostly hit (not miss) dishes, it sometimes ""hits the spot."" Try the fried avocado egg roll thingies for appetizer, if you are not on a diet (other than Atkins!). Also good are breakfast burritos and some of the pasta dishes."
Elizabeth S.,"Denver, CO",0,14,,3.0,7/6/2014,"I normally would give this restaurant a five star, but after going and seeing that they have shrunk their portions, I cannot do so. This is the first time I have been at this location. I was a regular customer located at the two Cheesecake Factory's in Las Vegas for many years, and ate there all the time. I thought all locations served the same portions because they do the same menu; but today the appetizers we normally got in Vegas were HALF the size for the same price. Way overpriced for what we got.  The regular dinner salad used to be huge, in a big bowl, today it was just a small tiny salad on a small plate and cost me almost $7.00, and they no longer put anything on it, just plain lettuce and spinach. We did  not order a meal, so not sure if the meals got smaller in size. The cheesecake is always delicious (but too pricey), and the food menu has a great selection. Food is very tasty, and it used to be our favorite place to go, but now that I am getting half of what I used to get, and spending the same amount, and even more since they did raise their prices a bit, I doubt I will drive out of my way to go back there again. Staff was friendly, service good. What made Cheesecake Factory so nice was the large portions and fair price. Not anymore."
Aaron H.,"Boulder, CO",2,74,42,3.0,1/30/2008,"Cheesecake factories are all the same. Overpriced but decent food and drink. Gimicky and chainy. In boulder there is so much good food that this is hardly worth your time. Why three stars then you ask.? It is because of one spectacular appetizer. The Buffalo blasts(pic included)! For $8.99 they pile your plate ridiculously high with the fried, triangular beauties. filled with shredded chicken buffalo sauce and maybe cheese. Served with a side of hot sauce and blue cheese. These are the only reason to go the the cheesecake factory in boulder."
Marie E.,"San Antonio, TX",26,70,,2.0,7/21/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but this location doesn't do it justice. The table was dirty when we sat down, and the food wasn't that great. I will go back to the Cheesecake Factory, but probably not this location."
Ratha O.,"Lafayette, CO",5,27,,3.0,1/19/2010,"I had the garlic pasta with only 5 pieces of itsy..bitsy.. minute shrimps. Talk about Shell-Fish!!! You don't get what you pay for! However, their cheesecake with strawberry sauce and whip cream is pretty tasty!! I'd probrably go back..just for the dessert!"
