Sally H.,"Aurora, CO",126,102,281,1.0,5/19/2015,"This is my very first one star review.  When I started doing yelp reviews I vowed to myself that I would not rate a business one star.  The reason behind my thinking is I truly believe a bad review hurts a business; that is if the business serves its customers.  The Cheesecake Factory did not even serve my party.   The incidence occur earlier this evening when my family went out in celebration for my niece's graduation.  Since we knew that so many of us were to attend dinner we made a reservation two weeks prior for a large party of 25 at 6pm.  Part of the party arrived tremendously earlier to dinner and others trickled in before the reservation time.  Overall, we were all there before six.  Ten after six, we were told by the manager that they were waiting to set-up our table because the party before us were still lingering around.  We were also given the option to split our group into two for faster service, but we opted out because we wanted to celebrate this special occasion together as a family. Time passed by and we still were not seated.  We asked the front what was going on and was told we did not have a reservation.  We were simply put on the waiting list.  Meaning that we had to wait for the next available seatings.  However, here's the kicker, Cheesecake Factory had called the day before to confirm our reservation.  After the initial explanation of the delay in our table, we sat around for another forty-five minute to be told that we did not have a reservation and we had to wait longer to be seated.  That is simply ridiculous and I felt awful for my niece.  She absolutely loves this place and it was her choice to dine here. Luckily, we called a place near by and they were happy to take all of us in with such short notice.  This location puts a bad taste in my mouth."
Zach B.,"Golden, CO",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Sunday 7/30/17 I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever experienced. After a 40 minute wait, which can be expected on a Sunday, we were buzzed on the clicker to return to the host stand. The hostess told us, as if it was our fault, that our table would be another 10 minutes. This is where we should have gotten the hint for what was in store. We were seated and not greeted for about 10 minutes. We ordered everything on the spot because we had been seated so long already. After 35 minutes our appetizers came. Another 20 minutes passed and our server came out to inform us the kitchen had run out of one of the meals we ordered (55 minutes after ordering). When the food finally arrived at 1hour and 10 minutes after being seated, one of the dishes was a completely different menu item. The worst part, was that the server defended a fried piece of chicken with mashed potatoes as a chicken pasta. Still no offer of a manager. Another 15 minutes passed and the final dish hit the table. After eating, we waited an additional 15 minutes before our server was seen again, who didn't offer us cheesecake at the the Cheesecake Factory. This is the point where I demanded a manager come to our table. Manager did what he could but we will not be returning. Literally wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it. Honestly sad yelp makes me give them a star to write this review. 0/5."
David R.,"Denver, CO",0,52,,4.0,6/23/2016,Great value at lunch and great food!  The pizza crust was perfect!  Jalan did a fine job serving us and our two grandkids.
Gina C.,"Westminster, CO",5,9,4,1.0,6/26/2016,Just went for birthday dinner and as much as I love going to the Cheesecake Factory I was highly disappointed with the services given by our waiter. Not sure if he didn't feel like working tonight or was upset we sat in his section. I however will not be going back to this location. My food was warm not hot it took a long time for the food to make it to the table.  He was not attentive to the table at all. I could have told him about the food but he was no where to be found by then it was too late I started eating my warm/cold dinner. Which for 19-20 for a pasta it should be spectacular. It seemed as when we did ask the waiter for Something It was as we were bothering him. Also when they(my family) mentioned it was my birthday. The waiter had no interest in making it special or even saying oh well happy birthday. Overall just not good! Hopefully he gets a new job he can actually enjoy.
Scott L.,"Conroe, TX",130,497,1388,5.0,8/6/2015,"Returned to TCF to sit on the patio-café which has one of the better venues for people-watching on Pearl Street and took my own advice: just order cheesecake. This time the service was AMAZING. Our waitress, Mary, was extraordinarily attentive, and seemed genuinely concerned about our welfare as humans, not only as guests. TCF should clone this girl."
Kaitlin P.,"Louisville, CO",8,4,,1.0,8/31/2015,"This review is exclusive to their catering.  We had a prior catering option fall through the day of  a company lunch that day so I contacted Cheesecake Factory to see if they could help.  While they were able to come through for us last minute, I was not happy with the food brought to us: The person I spoke to that morning made recommendations based on the number of people we have so I ordered food based on those recommendations.  We could've gone with an order 1/2 the size and it still would've been more than enough.  I realize the portion sizes at CF are HUGE, but this was so over the top and it was a big inconvenience on what to do with the food afterwards.  We ordered basic pasta + salads.  The pastas were so over-salted, which prevented people from wanting the second/third helpings that I desperately needed to get rid of.  The salads were fine and of course the bread was amazing (that and the fact that they could help us out last minute are the only reason for the star). We regularly order food from businesses on Pearl St for employee meals.  Cheesecake Factory will not be a location we order from again."
Megan B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",111,7,,3.0,7/5/2015,"Just visited tonight for an early dinner with the family. First, let's state the obvious - this is a huge chain that serves a ton of people, so this is not a gourmet stop. However, there are a couple places where I think CF should get credit. First, this chain is incredibly consistent - hadn't been in years, and never to this location, but I ordered some old favorites and they were just as I remembered. Secondly, for the amount of food you get, the price is really decent.  That said, their food is prepared pretty heavily and can be too rich - I usually opt for a salad for that reason. Their luau salad is my favorite (rec dressing on the side), but I've enjoyed all the ones I've tried. Also, their avocado egg rolls are delicious, no getting around that. Some other favorites I remember are the stuffed chicken tortillas and cashew chicken. Their cheesecake can definitely be too rich/sweet. Tonight we tried the lemon raspberry, which was fairly light and rather tart - a nice change.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, and the service was just fine. All in all, I'd go back again, especially if I needed a larger venue or was with picky eaters - there are so many options!"
Bernadette B.,"Chicago, IL",467,3,,5.0,10/14/2015,Matthew and the bakery were very nice. Mitch and mike were very helpful and swift on their feet ;)  SO WORTH IT!!!! Yummy
Brock P.,"Johnstown, CO",18,9,3,4.0,5/28/2016,"The shrimp and sausage pasta is fantastic!  And, of course the Original Cheesecake is amazing as always!!"
Ken C.,"Denver, CO",17,18,16,3.0,1/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice option for semi-special occasions, like birthdays, get-togethers, highschool proms, etc. They are extremely popular, can accommodate large parties, and of course have those delicious cheesecakes.  But apparently being so popular doesn't mean the restaurant can handle the strain. We came on a Friday night, which was understandably busy. We were given a wait time of 15-20 minutes, but ended up waiting 30 with nary an apology. Okay, aggravating but no big deal.  Until we waited another 10 minutes before being greeted by our server. I noticed he had been triple seated so not his fault. He was brisk, efficient, and polite but so noticeably strained that I felt rushed for my order and fearful for his throbbing forehead vein.  The rest of the dinner was prolonged between each step with drinks, the meals coming out, and the check being settled. Our server did all he could, but I felt pretty bad for him.  Cheesecake Factory has a great set-up to be a default restaurant. The vast menu, fair prices, huge portions, and gimmicky dessert  shtick is a good formula to people please and make the restaurant an easy choice when the question is, ""Where do we want to go to celebrate something but don't want to look up a new place?"" Easy recipe for popularity.   But a corporate chain restaurant should have scheduling down pat. The staff seemed to know what they were doing but were hurried and kept looking at us like ""where did all these customers come from??"" Overstretched and it was obvious. Hopefully it was a one night fluke because the restaurant was on par with everything else as usual."
Blair C.,"Denver, CO",221,137,350,3.0,2/8/2015,The only reason you'd eat at Cheesecake Factory is for their namesake of cheesecake. Their menu food is subpar and nothing to brag about.
Andrew P.,"Oxnard, CA",3,12,12,1.0,11/5/2014,"WORST SERVICE SINCE MOVING TO COLORADO Went here a week ago. I would love to list the pros. But I have none. So here are the cons.  #1 Arrived, the hostess didnt even greet us. We had to get her attention. She looked like she just rolled out of bed. Wearing dirty black leggings, a spaghetti strap shirt with her bra strap exposed, two different colored socks (pink and blue WTF?), and casual sneakers. Is there even a dress code here? #2 Asked for a booth and was looked at like it could not be done then after insisting she the hostess sighed and sat us there.  #3 Waited over 10 minutes just to see our server. Ordered everything at once to make things quicker. Wings, Salmon, and A burger Medium. Wings took 30 minutes just to arrive. #4 Food arrived 30 minutes after the wings. The medium burger was well done. After i cut it open to show the server it was completely over cooked. He said, ""That looks pretty medium."" (Are you kidding me? You say you are sorry for the mistake, take the food away, and make sure you get it re fired.)  #5  Instead of getting to it. He sets the burger down next to the POS and decides not to re ring it but to go to another booth and talk to another guest for 8 minutes. I was dumbfounded. I finally had to tell him to re fire it and put it in a box to go.  It came out 15 to 20 minutes later and the whole time we were never approached by the server or the manager about the issue. It took us over an hour and a half to get our food and for one of us to have our meal. A ticket time for lunch should only be from 12 to 14 minutes. Its just so odd. It seems like the place was being run by people who were there to just collect a check and go home. No passion, no desire to show their guests a good time. Nothing. Needless to say we will not be going back there. I can only hope this keeps some people from experiencing what we did."
Lisa B.,"Boulder, CO",2,15,1,2.0,9/13/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory, but this location is terrible.  When it first opened in Boulder, I was excited, and went there somewhat regularly. I went today for the first time in a long time, and everything about the experience was awful. The service was slow. The food came out completely wrong. The server didn't ""make it right"" in a way that is super annoying when you are paying $17 for a salad it comes out missing Half the ingredients that are listed on the menu. For two people, no appetizers, no dessert, drinking water, the bill comes to $50 with tax and tip. There is way better value, service, and food on Pearl Street. Sad to say this was my last visit"
Katy H.,"Boulder, CO",28,6,,1.0,2/14/2016,The food is bland and boring. A majority of our food was cold. The service is mediocre. The o LH redeeming factor is the cheesecake is ok but it's not good enough to warrant sitting through a horrible meal.
Immanuel D.,"Boulder, CO",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2015,"This is by far one of the worst places in Boulder to eat. First and foremost, the servers here are racist. This isn't just speculation, I heard this from a 4-5 people who work there. They would constantly make fun of different races and say certain races of people didn't tip them well. Such as, ""black and Mexican people never leave good tips."" Mind you the servers here can make $300 dollars a night, but they STILL complain. After knowing the people who work here, do yourself a favor and never eat here. These people don't deserve your money. The male servers are also incredibly sexist and are the type of people to spit in your food. This is not a good place to take your family. Plus, there's so many local businesses in Boulder that really go for quality. This place is just a crappy chain that banks off ignorance of people coming to Boulder who don't know any better places to eat. Oh, and if you go for the cheesecake, remember NONE of the cheesecake is made at the restaurant, they ship it all in FROZEN. If the cheesecake is your favorite, get a slice at take-out without tipping. If you go here please know a large amount of workers here are just drug-binging alcoholics that make fun of customers behind their back, especially the servers. This is coming from someone who knew several of the workers."
Mark L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",38,19,1,3.0,8/18/2016,"Service was the best part of the meal. Typical corporate restaurant with mediocre cooks. Bland food and quite pricey. When I complained of the food, we became the ""table to avoid"". Crappy management. Wish I had saved more than 1/2 my money and ate at Illegal Pete's."
Jo M.,"Boulder, CO",35,6,1,5.0,1/25/2016,I just had a little kid open the door for me and I asked where his parents were.  He took me right to them and they were playing with another kiddo. I  gave little kid #1 $1...  Good job kid and parents!!!  Have faith
Kelcie S.,"Westminster, CO",32,57,27,3.0,8/3/2014,"Irving was our waiter the other night. He was spectacular and if I ever decide to go again I will ask for him. He was the right amount of attentive and was extremely polite. I would give five stars souly based ok him, although the food was not wowed me this time.  I have ate at several different cheesecake factory's and I was not impressed at all at the quality of food at this location on a Friday night. I thought it was a little odd there wasn't a wait on a Friday night, now I know why.  I ordered a Caesar salad which was too notch and not overloaded with dressing. My main course was the garlic noodles with shrimp.... Paying $18 a plate there was no flavor not could I taste the garlic in the dish and the shrimp was over cooked to the point it wasn't chewable. I haven't ordered this dish before but I'll stick with their appetizers from now on.  My bf had a simple pepperoni pizza.... When it came out to the table the dough wasn't cooked all the way. There was grease dripping off the pizza like it was from a New York dive pizzeria. He had them take it back and they were very nice about the situation as they took the pizza off the menu and gave him a piece of cheesecake on the house.  Our other guest had the chicken katsu and she loved it soo much. Perfect flavor and cooked to perfection. I won't give up on this chain but definitely not going to that location any time soon."
Eddie P.,"Hixson, TN",8,39,33,4.0,6/3/2015,Today I did the small plates of dynamite shrimp & crab cake rolls - tied to a side salad which was HUGE!!!!  Great 1000 island dressing!  Go heavy...
William K.,"Louisville, CO",1,24,2,1.0,1/31/2016,"Simply put, avoid this location. Though their hours are posted as being open until 11:00 PM, I visited the location at 10:20 PM on a recent Monday and was told they were closed ""because we were real slow tonight."" If you're going to run your restaurant that way, advertise hours of ""''till Close"" instead. Now I know that I would need to call ahead to check how busy the restaurant was any time I wanted to visit after peak hours, which is more hassle than I want to deal with. Instead I will visit a different location or a restaurant that actually adheres to their posted hours. If you're interested in The Cheesecake Factory, I'd recommend their Park Meadows location instead, which has always been absolutely wonderful in service and food quality and seems to actively care about their customers."
