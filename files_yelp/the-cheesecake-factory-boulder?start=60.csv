Rajeev R.,"Boulder, CO",27,57,,1.0,5/31/2016,"After 30 years of visits, finally made a decision to never visit any Cheesecake Factory establishment again. My Guest experienced rude behavior. I gave the CKF leaders an opportunity to apologize to him. They did not. The man they insulted is UN's head in Iraq whose staff cares for 3.2 million refugees. Cheesecake Factory's behavior is not acceptable and not excusable."
Lian S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,7,,1.0,8/16/2016,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Food was supper crappy and very bland. They never brought the bread and it took over 20 minutes to refill my water. I will not come back to this please. Also, a milkshake... is 8 dollars."
Rick M.,"Broomfield, CO",0,14,,2.0,2/14/2016,My eggs where completely frozen and at the bottom of my food(nearest the plate) was cold as the plate.  Plus then they tell me they ran out of something and had to substitute. How does a business stay in business with these problems? What's up with food served on a cold plate. Haven't yet found a place in all of Colorado that serves food on a warm plate.
Jina S.,"Superior, CO",2,3,1,1.0,7/10/2015,"Food was amazing but the service was NOT. For starters, the menu is incredibly vast which I enjoy very much giving as there is an option for everyone and an option for every craving. They have almost everything you could imagine. I had the tomato basil pasta which was delicious. It had chunks of mozzarella and tomatoes accompanied by grilled chicken and a pesto drizzle. To die for!! However, my fantastic meal was the only good part. When I walked in the door I was greeted by a hostess who told me there would be a 10 minute wait. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our table. When I asked the hostess if she could give me another estimate she simply said ""another 10 minutes"", which she had said 45 minutes ago. Not appreciated. I don't have a problem waiting for my table, but don't tell me 10 minutes is the wait when I have to wait almost an hour... And then when I confronted the hostess about her lack of honesty towards me she rolled her eyes at me and was very rude. It was quite unprofessional to say the least. Needless to say I won't be going back for awhile. I'm very disappointed. My meal would've been that much better if the service had been up to par as well. I'm still appalled at the attitude the hostess had towards me and am surprised to how she is still working there. I will definitely be calling the manager soon to discuss my experience."
Jane K.,"Bloomington, IN",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2016,"The WORST Cheesecake Factory I've ever been. Especially, Service was very poor. I've been to many other Cheesecake Factories and they always welcomed and served breads for starting while waiting for the appetizer or main dish. I almost thought that maybe the Cheesecake Factory in Boulder is different; do not serve breads for starting until I saw other tables got the breads while we were waiting for the foods for 35 minutes. It was not their busiest time either. Our waiter was hardly around, so we had to ask other waiter. I understand people make mistakes, however I wouldn't have write this review if he apologize for not serving us properly. I saw the other waiter told him about the situation, but he pretended nothing happened. It was very unpleasant and I agree with the reviews about the Manager was not helpful. I told her about the bad service when we went out, No sorry face but frowned at me. We will never visit this location again and would never recommend to any of my friends."
Sean V.,"Denver, CO",8,4,,1.0,5/26/2015,"This place doesn't deserve any stars at all!! Service was HORRIBLE! My sister made reservation 2 weeks in advance for a party of 25 to celebrate her daughter's graduation. A call was made to confirm the reservation.  We waited for over an hour and a half, and later being told that it was a waiting list not a reservation. Some of us complained to the manager, but they didn't care to help resolved the issue. Needless to say we will NOT be coming back. Thanks Cheese Cake for ruining the special moment. Thanks BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for taking all 25 of us in at a short notice and your wonderful service."
Tenth F.,"Boulder, CO",0,8,,1.0,5/25/2015,Very bad service and food is normal. Do not order any fish they are all frozen.
Ian M.,"Boulder, CO",0,23,,1.0,2/5/2015,"This place is the worst. I keep coming back, though, because my mom sends my girlfriend and I gift cards to it on almost every holiday. In total, we have probably been to this location around 10 times in 5 years and each time was a negative experience. The funny thing is that my mom began giving us gift cards to Cheesecake Factory long before we lived in Boulder, so I truly do feel like these problems are unique to this location.  We went last night and our main objective was to play it safe. In other words, we decided against looking at the massive menu and ordering what we thought sounded good and instead ordered based on what we thought the kitchen could make successfully. I got a crispy chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got chicken alfredo. The chicken on my sandwich was over cooked and completely dry. The real disaster, though, was my girlfriend's dinner. We had planned on sharing dinners with each other by swapping our plates back and forth across the table. Her plate came out so hot that after waiting for it to cool down she finally just gave up on it ever cooling down and gave me a bite on a fork -- it was terrible! Literally, it tasted nothing like alfredo, only garlic and mush. Obviously the reason the plate was so hot was that it had been microwaved. Really? Almost $20 for a chicken breast, noodles, and sauce and you guys can't make it fresh? It's worth mentioning that my favorite thing at Burger King used to be a Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which they removed from their menu many years ago. It cost about 1/4 what I paid for my dinner last night and I actually mentioned during dinner that BK made better chicken sandwiches.   We are the kind of people that never complain at restaurants. I sat there and ate my chewy chicken sandwich and told the waiter it was fine. My girlfriend decided she had to say something about her dinner. She did and they brought her a complimentary piece of cheese cake. I guess that a $6 piece of cheese cake makes up for an inedible $20 dinner?  Oh well, I guess it's time to politely ask my mom to consider sending us gift cards to just about anywhere else."
Leticia G.,"Littleton, CO",8,17,6,1.0,7/30/2015,Came in on a Thursday night at 9 pm the wait was twenty minutes. They sat us down and offered us bread and we waited for 25 minutes for bread. A table came in ten minutes behind us and they got bread even though they only ordered cheesecake and waters. The manager came out around 9:40 and tell us that they ran out of bread 30 minutes ago and I told him the table who sat down after Us got bread and he looked baffled that his lie was not valid. It was ridiculous. We got waiters who were too busy attending to other tables to even say anything or bring refills. I never complain and never write these but this was infuriating.
Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,308,4.0,5/31/2012,"I absolutely love their cheesecake!  My favorite is the Brownie Sundae with a cherry on top.  It is gorgeous!  It always looks like artwork when it comes my way.  Hate to dig in, but you have to!  We always split it, and frankly it is a meal in itself.  We have eaten from the menu too, but have to say, it is nothing overly exciting, usual chain fare.  I always come for the cheesecake and tea because it is 5+ stars!  Service is always good, but sometimes there is a bit of a wait.  It is on Pearl St., so that is normal.  Location, location."
Alekhya V.,"New York, NY",0,2,,2.0,12/19/2015,We usually love Cheesecake Factory however this one isn't the best! Being a big chain they ran out of most of the stuff on the menu. Their cheesecakes are frozen. We ordered evenlys pasta and the first time they brought out it had chunks of PLASTIC. After returning it we received the worst pasta ever. The pasta was uncooked and bland.
C S.,"Nederland, CO",0,8,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I have eaten here for many years.I am sorry to say that it is on the decline. The staff used to be awesome....polite and helpful.Now it is a new bunch of employees,many of whom act as if they could care less.The last time I ate here was in November. The waiter was nice but couldn't seem to figure out the bills for the tables in front of us,forgot my salad dressing and did not check to see if we needed anything.In retrospect,I wish I had not asked for dressing because I had food poisoning four hours after eating there. When I called the manager several days later he acted like he didn't believe me.I told him the dressing was not cold and that I thought it was the culprit,he didn't even offer to refund my money or give me a gift card ( not that I plan to eat there anymore!)"
Mighty B.,"Broomfield, CO",0,10,,1.0,2/5/2013,"There should be an option for ZERO stars.  I love cheese cake.  A good cheese cake can be the perfect part of any meal or day.  A bad cheese cake can be a colossal disappointment.  Which brings us to the cheese cake factory.   Over the weekend I and some family members went to the cheese cake factory to get a quick dessert. Upon entering this establishment we were greeted with great disdain from a staff of pompous self-centered hipster wannabees.  Every service employee we dealt with acted like it was a displeasure for them to even acknowledge our presence let alone converse with us enough to serve us. Not being regulars we had some questions about the long list of cheese cake options.  The person taking care of us (or actually the person avoiding taking care of us) acted like it was our fault that we did not know everything on the menu.  After a couple of questions he rolled his eyes at my sister and started talking to a coworker about some party they were going to later. That was just the tip of the ice berg so to say.  We found no one there to be friendly, helpful, knowledgeable or efficient. The extremely poor service would have been tolerable even the desserts lived up to the expectations alluded to by the name.  Alas the food was more of a letdown then the service was. Most of the cheese cake came out frozen.  Instead of remedying the situation the server told us to just let the cakes warm up over time.  Not the right answer by the way.  The cheese cake that was not frozen was mediocre at best and no worse than most chain restaurant cheese cakes.  Definitely they are not worth the $8 - $10 price tag when other places sell a better product for around five bucks.   But the biggest problem that I had was as follows.  I asked for a New York style cheese cake with no toppings.  The server said to get the original.  I asked if this was a true New York style and not a key lime or lemon type.  He looked at me funny and assured me that it was.  I asked again if it was firm and sugary as apposed to fluffy tart cake.  With a huff, he again said that it was a New York style cake  When the cake came it was definitely not a New York style and tart enough to make me pucker.  When I pointed this failing out to the server he said that it was too late to do anything as I had already taken a bite out of it. He also said that I would know what not to get next time."
Christine D.,"Englewood, CO",12,18,2,1.0,4/10/2016,"Worst service of my life!!!!!!!!!! I left here in such a bad mood due to the horrible treatment we were given. I came here last Sunday 04/02 around 4:30. We were told by the host that our server would be right by. About 10 minutes later our server walked by and said I'll be right with you. (Instead of getting our drink order) walks by her other table takes their order, puts it in, walks away decides to bus some other tables, disappears in the back for an additional 7-10 minutes then comes back and tells us that someone else will our server. Clearly she didn't want to be there and managed to get cut and wanted nothing to do with her tables or customer satisfaction. I'm a hospitality manager and understand the way things go in restaurants but I figured going to a corporate restaurant with a good reputation it would be a guaranteed good time. I was so upset by the treatment that we left after drinks and apps. We had two appetizers and two drinks and our total was 72$. Kinda crazy. We left hungry, sober and upset. Never returning. I wish I remembered the servers name but she was thin, buzz cut style short hair, and no Social skills."
Alyssa T.,"Longmont, CO",0,2,,4.0,3/10/2016,"Service was good, drinks were good, food was ok. Pasta was bland had no seasoning as was the shrimp. Had the shrimp angel hair pasta which tasted like noodles and canned tomato sauce Husband had the Louisiana pasta which had a bit more flavor from the sauce but still needed seasoning. Cheesecake was excellent."
Karey S.,"Erie, CO",0,12,,2.0,10/26/2015,"My mom ordered a salad with pears and bleu cheese and it literally had 3 pears in the whole thing so that Was disappointing. Server was a younger guy who obviously wasn't having a good day or hates his job, everything we asked was an inconvenience for him. I'm a server myself and I would never be that standoffish with a table especially a big top.. I used to think of this place as the fanciest place to go and now it's just mediocre."
Jessica W.,"Broomfield, CO",0,7,3,5.0,3/6/2016,"Last night was my birthday and we decided to have dinner at CF. We've been to this location before but it wasn't a super memorable experience. Last night was off-the-charts amazing! The wait was quoted as ""30-35 minutes,"" but was actually more like 15. We got a great table in a quiet area. Our server was on point from start to finish. I was a server for 10 years and know what a challenge Saturday nights can be, but Gretchen K was about as good as it gets. Everything was delivered super fast and had some really nice special touches that are really appreciated, (like boxing up our leftover guacamole and labeling the box with the date- small thing, yes, but a really nice touch).  The food was perfect. My husband had the cajun chicken, which was the perfect temperature, looked amazing, and had the most phenomenal breading ever. I got the filet mignon and it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Dessert was key lime cheesecake- also perfect, and delivered with a Happy Birthday message on a cute little bed of rainbow sprinkles. Small touches make a big difference! Gretchen, if you or your bosses read this, know that we may get one or two date nights a YEAR, and this was definitely worth the wait! Thank you for making my birthday perfect."
Tarylen L.,"Longmont, CO",0,12,,5.0,4/17/2015,"When there for dinner with my little one, and she love it! the kids menu was perfect, and surprise! they have the Skinnyliciuos 2 pages menu for mom!! What a great combo! The service was fantastic the food very nice under 500 cals, and everybody happy. We order some cheesecakes for the boys and dad, so it's a place where everybody can get what they want and just one block away from the office!"
Amy F.,"Longmont, CO",64,328,32,4.0,12/30/2010,"The menu is too long, the wait is often too long, and the poor waitstaff is almost always being unfairly harassed by visiting CU parents and is thus a bit apathetic. And yet, we're still regulars here because: 1) We only come in for apps and/or cheesecake.  Occasionally we'll get a real meal, but that's only when we're with a big group that really wants to eat there and we still usually just split the Thai lettuce wraps.  2) If the wait is over 15-20 minutes, we skip it.  Since service is slow, we also don't go if we have a strict deadline (trying to make a show within the hour, etc). 3) Smile and be extra friendly to your waiter, and I guarantee you'll get better service.  The cheesecake selection is great, and so is the cheesecake.  It's not ""NY style,"" but if you think of it as its own special kind of cheesecake-like dessert, you'll be fine. And yes, it's expensive BUT look at the portions!  I mean, my God!  We always split something and 90% of the time still bring home left-overs.  For three meals, it's a fair price!"
Lyn Y.,"Boulder, CO",113,81,22,5.0,2/18/2013,"I have been here a few times now, and I have never been disappointed! It's pricey yes, but you can seriously order anything your mouth might be dreaming of....because they have such an extensive menu. The atmosphere is awesome, because it is chill and elegant; however, no one shuns you if you walk in in your running clothes. Waitstaff is attentive and well educated, despite the daunting menu. Oh forgot to mention, the Well-Mannered Dirty Martini is perfect....it comes with Blue Cheese Stuffed Olives! All Capitalized because it takes an attentive bar tender to stuff those things each night!"
