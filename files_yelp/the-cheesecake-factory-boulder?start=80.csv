Dale C.,"Loveland, CO",1,8,,1.0,9/5/2014,"Meal was a microwave dinner but much more expensive. Waitress was not to be found, no coffee refills, took forever to get the check."
Zubey L.,"Boulder, CO",5,114,4,1.0,5/24/2012,"okay let me first start by saying i've been coming here for a good 6 years or more.  When I first started coming.. it was great.. wait staff were on it.. food was hot and delicious... then this place  got 5 stars.   Over the years.. and especially the last year or 2 this place has gone down hill ... i won't sit here and review every time i've been in  but I ill review when i was there yesterday.   So being skeptical about returning after about 6 months... i was hopefull they would have gotten their act together...  Did they??.. HECK NO!  its was even worse then before!!!!!    1st we ordered drinks.   the waitress was pretty good about getting them to us fast... my wife ordered the Strawberry Lemonade..  IT WAS RANK!!!!! either it had gone bad... or they threw rotten strawberries in there..  sent it back.   then it took about 10 minutes for her to come back and take our order.   I got FIsh and Chips,  My wife got the Herb baked chicken.. my mother in law got the Jamaican shrimp.   so we sat there and waited... and waited ... and waited for our food.. FINALLY 50 minutes later she brings our food.  My fish and chips... COLD!!  the fries... COLD AND SOGGY!!  the coleslaw.. was HOT!! yes HOT !! like they  heated it up... the tarter sauce.. was OLD smelled rotten..   asked for more.. they brought it right away and it was fine.  so i ate as much of the fish i could since that was the only thing half edible  .. my wifes chicken... BLECH... nasty... not good wasn't even cooked all the way through..   My mom's Jamaican black pepper shrimp?  it was decent.. but they forgot the plantains  so we asked them for them.. they brought them.. looked like they have been sitting there or hours.. cold... dried out..   THat is it we are never going back.. and will tell all our friends and family to never go again.   If i could give this place NO stars I would. HOWEVER.. the cheesecake is bomb.. but expensive."
Conner G.,"Berkeley, CA",78,33,1,5.0,8/20/2014,I had an awesome brunch at the Cheese Cake Factory this past Saturday. My waiter Adam was attentive to my drinks when they were low and took my order in a timely manner. The food was great and so was the service. Prime patio location on pearl.
John S.,"Falls Church, VA",9,341,26,3.0,7/9/2014,I thought the service was rather slow for such a quiet late lunch on a Wednesday.  Ordered the lunchtime salad and pizza combo.  Took about 10-15 minutes for the food to come out and got my salad and pizza at the same time.  Would have been nice to get the salad first.  Good food and friendly service.  Nice sitting outside on Boulder's Pearl Street mall.
Jennifer C.,"Jefferson City, MO",33,15,4,5.0,8/7/2014,"Couldn't have had a better lunch than today's lunch. Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff.  I enjoyed the shrimp bacon club sandwich with fries.... the sauce was amazing and the shrimp were flavorful.  I'm so glad I was able to try (my sister's) Asian lettuce wraps.  The Chipotle dipping sauce was on point. I will definitely order that next time I find myself at a cheesecake factory."
Marcus J.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,1.0,12/27/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite, if relatively overpriced, places to go. My wife and I first met at the Boulder restaurant, so used to enjoy going back occasionally. However, this restaurant is now on our no-go list, after the last three very disappointing visits. The service is much worse than it used to be, the cocktails appear to be watered down, and the food is pretty terrible - for example, they'd burnt (badly) the meatloaf on both occasions that we tried it. I don't quite understand what's happened to what I thought was a restaurant that provided consistently decent (if not exceptional) food, but something's gone wrong and they've lost a patron."
Blu M.,"Denver, CO",51,249,29,2.0,1/2/2012,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory for my dorm mate's birthday. First off, the food is overpriced. I ordered one of the burgers and although it was good, it was not worth how much I paid for. I also ordered the cheesecake and it came out delicious, but it was EXPENSIVE. I think I could have gotten way better food on Colfax, than the Cheesecake Factory. The waiter we had lost my credit card as well and took a while for me to find, and I left the cheesecake factory angry. Yeah this place is good, but it's not worth the price, especially for someone who is going to college at CU. I seriously don't have money to waste at this place..sorry"
Joseph D.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",1,9,,2.0,9/27/2014,My g/f went here for dessert because the kitchen had  a 30min wait. So we figured why not let's go. We both ordered different types of  cheesecake chocolate mousse and banana and it was too cold. The consistency was hard and the bananas they serves as a garnish were brown. We both let disappointed having expected a lot more.
Ka B.,"Boulder, CO",9,106,216,3.0,5/3/2014,"Well, it's a chain restaurant. Good portions, good waitress. It was only a 20 minute wait for a Saturday evening but it was fine we just walked around the mall and came back. Overall, I wasn't super thrilled with the food for what I paid. It wasn't terrible (it was a pretty presentation) but it's just not very memorable or unique... Probably will not go again unless prompted by others. Even the cheesecake is a little whatever and was still frozen in the middle. My mom makes a better cheesecake!"
Erin K.,"Millbrae, CA",36,7,6,4.0,6/8/2014,I really like this place. If you have ever been here you know the menu is great (as big as a book) so everyone is happy! Great date night spot
Megan C.,"Boulder, CO",21,39,10,4.0,8/15/2013,"Always great food and a great atmosphere guaranteed! With such a large and diverse menu you won't have trouble finding what you're in the mood for. Also this location is on Boulder Colorado's famous walking mall, a great relaxed place for shopping and strolling."
Debbie R.,"Boulder, CO",19,20,,3.0,8/29/2011,"Basically the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one, you might as well have been to them all. The food is usually good but 'commercial' tasting (think Applebee's, Chili's, Friday's et al) - really nothing special. The menu is HUGE with a ton of delicious sounding options (their marketing team is genius). It's so big that they even have ads in it (slightly weird to me).  Their portions are far too big and I've found most don't reheat well the next day (this is when you'll discover just how oil-laden the food is) so it feels a bit wasteful and expensive (the price appears appropriate for the portions but if you can't consume it all then it's a little expensive - I'd rather they give me less and charge less).  There's usually a wait even when you're looking at empty tables and it seems to take longer than it should for food to hit the table. If you get the bread and butter, understand that the butter is usually cold (pet peeve). It's a decent place to eat as long as you understand what you're getting. Now, their cheesecake is delectable and you'll find options you couldn't have even imagined. Just don't plan to have cheesecake after eating dinner there as you'll be too full.  My favorite time to go is after have a late-ish, large-ish lunch somewhere else then just stopping in cheesecake factory for dessert (in lieu of dinner). This is when I've truly loved and enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory experience most and I've never had a bad piece of cheesecake there."
Jeff C.,"Smithfield, UT",0,4,,4.0,1/12/2015,"Didn't eat a full meal here, but rather just stepped in for dessert, and I have to say I was impressed. I ordered the kahlua coffee cheesecake which was very rich and tasty. The waiter was clearly fishing for a big tip, but that's obviously not a problem as that will generally just result in great service."
Margaret A.,"Burlington, VT",43,205,17,2.0,1/30/2012,"I'm actually a fan of the cheesecake factory, but at this location the service is horrible.  The few times I've gone, the service has been slow, and the servers seem miserable.  The last time I went, the waitress took forever to take our order, then when I asked things about the menu- instead of saying, "" let me find out for you,"" she told me she wasn't sure.  She would ask the same question over, so if I ordered vanilla ice-cream she asked, ""What flavor ice-cream would you like?"" Ugh, I just told you... In terms of food, and locale- everything else was fine.  But they should be the same no matter where you go since it's a chain.  I've always had great service at the various locations I've been to, usually the servers are woking hard for good tips.  I guess I'll have to wait to go to another city to get my future cheesecake factory fix, or next time I'll have to order to-go."
Diana D.,"Northwest, Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,5/26/2015,"So, so bad. I had the Cobb salad because it was a gluten free option. It came with no bacon and I asked if it was supposed to have bacon and the waitress said not theirs. Which on the menu it clearly says bacon. It also had no dressing and I asked about that and she looked at me like I was crazy. I know a dry salad when I taste one. Finally we shared a piece of cheesecake, Godiva chocolate because it was listed as the only gluten free cheesecake. I was sick for over 7 hours because something had gluten in it.  I'll never go back. What a horrible experience and meal!"
Laura B.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,61,2,1.0,8/2/2014,"If I could give zero stars I would.  Our evening began with listening to the manager scream at servers, over customers tables, and heads, to get their attention.  Then we ordered drinks.  My friend was excited to try his first Mojito. He was served a glass full of slimy brown mint. We sent it back and got the same dang thing! Just a bit less slime this time, but still old, brown, bug eaten mint!  We decided to leave at that point. After all, if  the bar is willing to serve bad things, what will the kitchen do? Did I mention the manager said, ""There's nothing wrong with that"". Boo!"
B M.,"Boulder, CO",1,39,24,2.0,3/26/2015,Food was good but unfortunately I found a hair in my food near the end of my meal.. Gross! Let server know and then got the check... No comp and no manager came by.. Yes my food was almost gone by the time I found this gross hair but attention to that is necessary.. My guess is he didn't notify a manager partly because he was just double sat... I can only hope that normally they would address this better than doing nothing because getting someone else's hair in food is is gross.
Meeeeowww W.,"Denver, CO",0,7,,1.0,8/25/2013,"We were here today for lunch.  We were seated on the patio and waited nearly 15 minutes to be greeted by a server.  (I also watched other tables wait too long to be greeted by other servers.)  Our entrees (there were two of us) came out five minutes apart, and even then they forgot the side of bacon my father ordered.  That came later with no apology.  I ordered the orange chicken- it was overcooked, bland, and needed more sauce.   Our server was just awful! We paid up and she just placed the book on the table and rushed off, not saying thank you or anything.  Completely unprofessional and rude. We tipped 10% which was 10% more than she deserved.  We will never return to this Cheesecake Factory.  I assume the management here is terrible which would explain the bad service.  Don't waste your time and money at this dump!"
Renu D.,"Broomfield, CO",59,270,76,1.0,10/3/2010,"I have been to this location of cheese cake factory three times - all the three times with a big group of friends to celebrate something special. we are regular people who 'do' go to a chain restaurant to celebrate. So this rating ranting and the review has nothing to do with this being a chain restaurant. that cleared, lets get going. The food is ok at this place. Not spectacular, but kind of, I can eat it on one of those days. But I can not say the same about the service. On the earlier two occasions, I found the service lacking, but last night it just went all the way to a million minus stars and more! They do not take reservations on a Saturday night. Okay!! so we went and submitted our group name and waited 45 minutes for our table. after we are merrily seated, we order our wines, cocktails and other drinks and the apps. so far so good. And we have a lady wait staff for our table. she comes out with water for everyone and wants us to move our hands, limbs and whatever else we can from the table because she ""is not strong enough to hold that weight""  and wants to put the tray on the table! If I was the server, I would make 2 or 10 trips back to the kitchen and move fast on my feet ! It would not have been a big deal if the rest of the meal had gone well! since that did not happen - it IS a big deal!! you would expect a wait staff member to know how to open a bottle of wine! wouldn't you ? Oh no! she comes with the bottle of wine and says, ooh I am sorry I don't know how to open the bottle !!! WHAT! Remember my peace loving hubbz? he patiently explained the process to her. No luck! she did not understand. so he demonstrated the method to her. All this while I kept thinking, she should have asked for help from another staff member.  Anyhow, she happily lets my hubbz open the bottle and then serves the wine. And we wait for the appetizers and the rest of the drinks  and food.  I can really write a tale of woes on this but the long and short of it was that none of the food we ordered came on time, she entirely missed an order of appetizers and never ever bothered to check on us. One of our friends ordered scotch on the rocks, which came in a funny and cheap looking glass. I have never ever seen scotch served like that. It was hilarious and insulting at the same time. The icing in their 'serving  cheesecake ' - they served wrong entree to one of our friends - not once, but twice. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for them to get the  entree she ordered . Which was after their serving/kitchen staff kept on almost throwing the plates on our table because they were hot.  If it were not for the gratuity already added for our party, I would not have paid a single penny as tip !!  The food - 3 stars the service! oh well!"
Jose M.,"Katy, TX",6,7,6,4.0,11/12/2013,Overwhelming number of choices. A bit expensive but portions are generous. Foods are delicious!
