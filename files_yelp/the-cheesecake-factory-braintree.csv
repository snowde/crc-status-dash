Julie M.,"Weymouth, MA",57,157,123,4.0,12/4/2017,"I just really cant get over how dark it is in this restaurant. I like intimate ambiance and all but it is just so dark you can hardly see where you're going let alone the menu.  The avocado spring rolls are out of this world. The outside is fried perfectly to give you that crunch, and then you have good chunks of avocado inside with other spices. The dipping sauce looked green in color and had a sweetness to it. I think last time i ordered them there was a creamy sauce where as this one was more of a liquid sauce. Whatever the sauce was it paired perfectly with the rolls.  I was impressed that the butter that comes with the rolls was not in packets but instead one large pad on a saucer.  The pasta carbonara with chicken, ringing up to a $20.50 price, was well over priced for the portion size you get. I normally am able to get a few meals out of the one dish but not today. The meal was delicious i cant deny that, with the exception of a few cartilage pieces in the chicken, the garlic Parmesan sauce is very flavorful over the spaghetti and i loved the peas and bacon bits. Last but not least, the cheesecake. Holy moly the Chocolate moose cheesecake is like silk in your mouth. It is so smooth and light with just the right chocolate-y-ness. So so so good."
Laura M.,"Boston, MA",9,14,3,1.0,12/23/2017,"We had an awful experience here last night as a large group dining for a birthday between 6:20 - 7:45pm. We had two servers assigned to our two tables. My review is for the server assigned to our table who was short in stature with brown hair (cannot remember her name). My husband ordered a filet mignon. Our sever brought him a ribeye and told him it was a filet! Yes, you read that right. Our waitress did not know the difference between a ribeye and a filet. She then quickly left before we could protest further.  The ribeye steak tasted like it was rolled in salt before it was cooked and was inedible. The mac and cheese tasted like the boxed Velveeta from our youth. My steak tacos were fine, but very small and nothing spectacular.  Ten minutes later she returns, says she was wrong and that she will give him the inedible ribeye for free. My husband rightly rejected her offer (a ribeye is a very different cut from a filet) and requested a filet. She said it would take a long time to come out, and he still said that was fine. 30 minutes later - everyone else is done eating, his filet comes out undercooked!! It was bright red throughout and not even close to medium well. I'm not sure how it took 30 minutes to undercook a steak. He sends it back.  When it returns 10 minutes later, he is so frustrated he asks for a to go box. We ask for the bill. Here's where the fun begins folks... Waitress charged us for 2 filets and only refunded 1! She said she would not refund the 2nd one because we ordered it after she said she would give us a free ribeye. First, that is not a proper accommodation. A ribeye is not a substitute for a filet. Second, we should not be paying for the restaurant's numerous mistakes regarding the type of steak and the requested preparation.  I slept on it and realized this was actually ridiculous and we should not have paid. We should have asked for a manager and pressed the issue. I am leaving this review so others are aware of the poor service we received and the subpar food."
chelsea h.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",133,177,8,3.0,9/16/2017,"I'm not a chain lover, but I come here from time to time before going across the street to the movies out of ease.  Last night was ok, nothing special- just as I expected. I just want to say that we didn't love our experience because our waitress was a dud, had zero personality, and forgot to give us bread before our meal. Although, we watched her give some to all the tables around us. She wasn't very polite and seemed irritated when we were trying to figure out what we wanted to eat, and bothered whenever we asked for a drink. Once our food came we never saw her again until the check came. But, like I said- this isn't much different than I would have expected from this place. I'll go again, and expect an ok experience.... hopefully next time I'll get a waitress who at least knows how to smile."
Brenna C.,"New Bedford, MA",61,34,1,4.0,1/6/2018,"I honestly love treating myself to dinner at Cheesecake every once in a while. Their menu selection is so huge; they have something for everyone! I'm pretty picky, so I love that they also offer a photo of each dish on their online menu (pro tip). Only downside is how expensive it is here, even for the more ""basic"" dishes. Don't walk in starving, expecting to be seated right away. I think every time I've come to this location there's been a decently long wait time, so just keep that in mind. I feel like everyone's eaten at The Cheesecake Factory at some point in their life, but I can say that I'm never disappointed at this location!"
Young P.,"Boston, MA",224,346,388,4.0,11/7/2017,"When did Cheesecake get so fancy?? I haven't been to Cheesecake in years and I was really impressed by how much has changed since then. I ordered the gumbo which was surprising delicious and my wife ordered the fried catfish plate which came with green beans, mashed potatoes, and corn as side dish. We also tried the fried chicken sliders as appetizer and they were delicious as well. I was fairly impressed and I guess I should give Cheesecake more visits in the future."
Joie T.,"Quincy, MA",147,109,211,5.0,7/26/2017,"I know the food is incredibly unhealthy, but they come in large portions and it's sooo good.  Appetizers to order:  Firecracker Salmon!!! Thai Lettuce Wraps Crab and Artichoke Dip Entrees to order: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (substitute for Louisiana chicken instead)!!! Louisiana Chicken Pasta Pasta Carbonara Hibachi Steak Cheesecakes to order: Carrot Cake Cheesecake Tiramisu Cheesecake Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal)!!!"
Debra D.,"South Easton, MA",3,5,,1.0,12/30/2017,"My family of five ate here for lunch.   When we sat down there was old stevia wrapper stuck to the bottom of My plate and dirty forks ( actual stuck on food)  My shrimp and pasta came with hot pasta and STONE COLD SHRIMP).  My husbands food was Undercooked. ( he told her exactly the way he wanted it with details ). And there was a foreign substance in my edamame beans.   ( something stuck on the bean).      The manager that came over was just matter of fact and said they would be replaced.    NO CARE, concern or sympathetic comment   They remade the meals as the rest of my family ate ......  when our meals returned the second time they were hot but half way thru my pasta I found a large piece of shrimp shell.  With the leg parts still attached.    During the meal As the waitress was refilling our waters she touched the pitcher to the rim of he glass......  GROSS!   (If my mouth is on the rim to drink so is everyone else's and all transferred SPIT on the pitcher also).   No attention to PROPER HEALTH PRACTICES very unsanitary....... I am disgusted at the lack of concern, lack of attention to detail in the kitchen ( with the foreign substance and shells).   They took off my meal and my husbands but nothing can help the RUINED meal of us all eating separately and he upset of things not being correct the first time.   I can eat cold foot at home.   I wanted to have a nice meal with my family.   Well.... not here !"
Mario M.,"Miami, FL",173,66,126,3.0,11/11/2017,"Came here after a long day of visiting stores for work and had a not so great experience. I sat at the bar and there was one couple who had just finished their meals sitting at the end. I ordered a beer (Sam adams because they didn't have Stella draft) and was asked if I wanted the delicious bread that usually comes with while you wait for the meal. I got my beer and waited for the bread. Another couple sat next to me a few minutes later, ordered their meal, and received their bread right away. I looked around to see if my bread was coming, looked at the bar tender and said; I guess I'm not getting any bread tonight. He looked at me and said he would look into it, but at that point my Louisiana Chicken Pasta dinner had already come out. I was really looking forward to drinking my beer with the bread, however that never happened. My meal was ok, but was never offered an apology for the bread, so I asked for the bartender to comp my half drank beer ( I wasn't feeling the Sam Admas). I'll probably visit a different restaurant when I visit this area the next time I'm in town due to this experience. What ever happened to customer service??"
Austin D.,"NY, NY",89,3,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Came here to end 2017 in a nice way, ended up it's terrible service. We stood for 5 minutes waiting to be approached and seated. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. The waiter was nice person but a terrible waiter. Don't plan to come back to this Cheesecake Factory location after tonight."
Tanya D.,"Boston, MA",69,129,119,5.0,8/27/2017,"This is a review for the cheesecake only!  I have eaten here only a couple times and was never impressed, their menu is too large for anything to be well done; they should stick to what they do best, and that is cheesecake!  So I usually only come here to order a couple slices of cheesecake at their take out counter when you walk in and then I bring it home to enjoy. I have never been disappointed! They have so many flavors and I love them all!  Banana (DELICIOUS) Tiramisu (SO freaking tasty) Lemon Raspberry  Key Lime  Lemon Meringue  Cookie Dough (CHUNKS of cookie dough! Admittedly though, not my favorite) Pumpkin (seasonal): OMG. It tastes like the pie but even BETTER.  I can't even remember everything I've tried but I'm always left satisfied no matter what!"
Chelsea L.,"Portsmouth, RI",18,70,123,3.0,8/9/2017,"I wish I could give 3 and half stars. Our server Kathleen was really great and apologetic after a long wait for drinks. But my food was very disappointing. I ordered the Cuban sandwich because I love Cheesecake Factory's Cuban egg rolls. My pork was so tough and fibrous I had to pull it off the sandwich and basically paid $14 for a ham panini. My boyfriend was very happy with his mac and cheese burger, so it wasn't a total loss. I normally would have mentioned my disappointment in the food but we needed to get heading to New Hampshire."
K L.,"West Newton, MA",0,3,4,5.0,11/13/2017,"Rainy and cold Monday night, Wine down and some good food are the prefect pair to wrap up my very long day from school and running errands. We decided to sit at the bar, it's quite quiet or maybe it was just pretty late 9:30 ish. Michelle was my bartender, she is very attentive and great smile, very welcoming. Great suggestion on the spicy Korean cauliflower, very delicious!"
Alicia M.,"Foxborough, MA",0,1,,5.0,1/3/2018,Came here on 1/3/18 @9pm. Service was great!! Kelsee the bartender was awesome!!! Super friendly and welcoming and a lot of fun to talk to. Drinks came out great and food was very yummy. Thank you so much for making my birthday awesome! Will come back again!
Lisa G.,"Washington, DC",26,104,153,4.0,10/10/2017,"Came here for lunch while visiting from out of town. There was a bit of a wait for lunch but a table opened up in the bar area so we jumped on it! Our server, Eunize, was very sweet and attentive. We ordered an appetizer Caesar salad and buffalo blast to share between three. We sent back to buffalo blast because they were full of batter and tasted different than our party remembers them being months back. Taking it off the bill was not a problem which is appreciated because some places try to make you order something else. My sister ordered the chicken chipotle pasta which is her favorite, hold the peas and crunchy topping but add extra sauce. My partner and I shared the tempura fish tacos which to me were a bit over battered. Overall, a nice lunch and not bad for $44. Would come back here again."
Dee C.,"Boston, MA",61,109,136,4.0,5/2/2017,I visited this location just for drinks. It was a pleasant experience. As soon as we sat down we were served. We had the pleasure of meeting Voss a bartender there. He was very knowledgeable and made our drinks to our liking. He was social and attentive which i feel is a must as a bar tender. He even gave me some future drink ideas.  I can't speak for the restaurant service as a whole but if you're in the area and looking for somewhere to grab a quick drink i would recommend here. There are many options in the area but lets be real Legal Seafood is just good for their food. They couldnt make a Mai Tai if their name depended on it.  I had a great experience and 2 different drinks. An ultimate margarita recommended by Voss (bartender) was a great recommendation
Barbara K.,"Boston, MA",160,72,157,4.0,8/22/2017,"This particular location holds up to any other Cheesecake I have eaten at. We came here on a Tuesday night, we had a party of five and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, it was surprising but to be expected at Cheesecake I suppose. We had a wonderful waitress, I thought I made a note of her name but turns out, I did not. If you haven't eaten at the Cheesecake, it's definitely a pretty solid restaurant. Their menu is huge and has something for everyone in any mood. We had an order of spicy chicken nachos to split, they went very quickly.  I went with a staple of mine, the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken, which was delicious. I also recommend their lemonade, it's just like drinking liquid lemony sugar and it's fantastic. Everyone in my party had been to a Cheesecake Factory before and ordered their favorites and everyone was happy. We came here for a birthday and they have a song that they do that embarrasses the birthday celebrator just enough. The cheesecake here is delicious, I have never tried a slice I haven't liked."
Scott F.,"Duxbury, MA",0,3,,1.0,11/4/2017,I am not sure why there is a 2 hour wait for a table. The service is bad and food just so so. The desserts are good but when it takes 2 hours to get a table then after finishing dinner another 25 minute before dessert arrives at the table its not worth it.
Nan P.,"Canton, MA",0,8,,5.0,12/19/2017,"Went to south shore plaza in Braintree for Christmas shopping. It was extremely crowded. Went to Cheesecake Factory for lunch at 11:30am lots of people there. We got a table for 2. No wait. Megan was our waitress. She was quick, courteous and very attentive. We ordered omelettes. They were delicious. Plenty of veggies and cheese Enough to bring home.  I will be returning soon."
Josette S.,"Fall River, MA",0,8,24,5.0,6/11/2017,"I love this place,  we come here every so often to get cheesecake which is delicious. And to just enjoy a little time out when we can. Even when it's packed to the max the staff is always pleasant,  and always smiling.  It's why we love coming to this place.  Keep up the amazing job you have loyal customers for life."
John W.,"Marion, IA",27,106,165,2.0,12/25/2016,"So this was my first time going to one of these and I must start by saying I didn't order cheesecake. I ordered carryout to eat when I returned to my hotel.  I ordered a peanut Thai dish which was really good except for the spattering of uncooked rice in the dish. So I was eating it in fear of breaking off my temporary crown.  Had the rice been cooked correctly, this would've been 5 stars but uncooked rice is like raw chicken... you just don't serve it."
Qme Z.,"Boston, MA",244,92,40,3.0,5/30/2017,"I came here with a group of four for a late dinner Saturday night around 8 pm. As per usual the restaurant was packed. We were told the wait time would be approx 1-1.5 hours. Since we wanted dinner with drinks we decided to stay and wait. They give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is ready but the buzzer only has a radius of 10-15 feet, so we really couldn't go too far. We waited for about an hour and was seated. The table was still dirty from the party before with some clean plates and silverware on top. We requested the table to be cleaned and shortly after a bus boy showed up and wiped it off. The food and drinks were a little sub par from other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to. It really wasn't worth the wait, but I'll be back for their cheesecakes."
Jeremy P.,"Boston, MA",4,98,5,4.0,9/3/2017,"The best service is at the bar. Nachos appetizer melty to perfection. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and the Sam Adams seasonal was fresh and ice cold! I've eaten here several times over the years and the food and service was just meh, 2.5-3 star experience. The bar is definitely 4 stars"
Heather S.,"Waltham, MA",46,18,,1.0,8/26/2017,Thanks for the food poisoning Cheesecake Factory!  Won't be eating at this location ever again.
Quynh N.,"Randolph, MA",106,59,57,5.0,8/20/2017,"It is always super busy here mainly because it's the joint for mall shoppers. The food is always great and the servers are good at providing quality service. I have yet to have a bad experience. Just make sure you make a reservation if you plan on eating here, regardless of the time and day! Okay, maybe only during peak hours."
Krys G.,"Stoughton, MA",35,268,392,4.0,2/28/2017,Go before the rush or you will wait forever. The menu is quite diverse and offers many items. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The salads were nice and cold and fresh.  We decided on the shrimp with angel hair pasta and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. The dishes came out hot. The pasta was nicely cooked the way we like it. The portions were huge for us we couldn't even finish. We were kind of full but decided to split the Lemoncello Cream torte for dessert. It was fantastic!
R S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,25,,1.0,4/28/2017,"We normally have great experiences at this particular location but our most recent experience soured every previous one. Our server Brittany was atrocious, she clearly dislikes her job and should not be in a service based industry. We won't be back.  I didn't even think it was possible but after giving this location another try we had the same abysmal service by the same server Dwyer?. To be honest it seemed that Brittany was more concerned with anything but taking care of her tables. We waited 45 minutes for our meal and 20 for dessert"
Kim N.,"Cambridge, MA",18,41,5,1.0,9/15/2017,"SO sad :( I've always considered Cheesecake Factory a ""go to"".  Tonight at the Braintree location may have ruined that for me.  I got my usual Tuscan Chicken off the the skinnylicious menu. It's usually bright and fresh with delicious asparagus.  Tonight's had 2 pathetic limo pieces, half the amount of chicken as I've had in the past at Cambridge, and covered in oil.  If I hadn't been starving I would have stopped after one bite but I ate about half and I feel absolutely disgusting after how greasy it was.  On top of my friends burger being over cooked and teeny tiny it was just an overall bad experience. I won't be back."
Jen S.,"Brookline, MA",135,260,172,4.0,8/23/2016,"Still catching up on so many years' worth of reviews! So Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake factory- same menu, same taste everywhere. Same long waits for its expansive (slightly expensive), delicious menu. But I'm rating this place since we come here more often (proximity and all) The main thing I want to say is that this place has lovely staff and very kid friendly! They were always very nice to us when we wanted to bring our baby in his car seat- either by giving us a big booth to fit him with us or helping us secure him on one of their car seat holder things they have. On a busy day, one of the walkways between the restaurant and the mall are packed with parked strollers. :) They have a delightful brunch! Good brunchy/breakfasty items AND lunch/sandwich items to choose from.  Their small plates are really great if you have a small appetite but still want tasty food. Worth the price.  Their entrees are huge and possibly can be turned into leftovers for 2-3 meals :) Their sandwiches are VERY tasty and probably some of the more affordable items on the menu- and the perfect amount. Not too big, not too small.  Their desserts: I love their strawberry short cake. I guess they have cheesecakes too. :-P Kidding- oh there are SO many to choose from and they are all divine.  Oh and the BREAD! OH THE BREAD! The honey wheat bread is for the gods and goddesses. I typically ask them to only bring out that kind instead of their sourdough. They are generally nice to accommodate. If they forget because it's busy, I don't complain. I just make my husband eat the sourdough :) It's worth the wait. Sit outside if you can. Don't hesitate to bring your little one and don't worry about leaving your stroller out of your view.  Have your cheesecake and eat it too, even if you take it to go because the bread and entree stuffed you so."
Angel M.,"Manhattan, NY",211,188,217,5.0,2/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the  !!! I didn't realize before how they have such a huge variety of actual good food!!!! I cant wait for my next cheat day!! Disclaimer: I came here 3 times within 8 days to ensure a perfect Yelp review :P Apps/Small Plates: Calamari and the Buffalo Blasts are my favorites so far. Initially, I thought the buffalo blasts were a little too salty/rich but I think they make the perfect shareable appetizer. Buffalo sauce, cheese, and chicken in a fried won-ton wrapper is actually the best thing ever. -Crispy Fried Cheese: only about $5.50, but so not worth it. Do yourself a favor and get the Fried Mac & Cheese instead. Entrees/sides: -Goat cheese & beet salad (I think its the French Country Salad) but that was the gist of it. It's pretty good. I'm trying to get myself to eat more beets, so this was an enjoyable way of doing so. It also had asparagus and candied pecans. -Fried Mac & Cheese: YUM! Need I say more?? If I had to, I'd only mention that the marinara sauce on top is so amazing. -Mac & cheese: the sharp cheddar taste was strong (if you're into that). When I had the leftovers the next day, it was extremely oily??? But once I poured out the 1/2 cup of grease, it actually tasted really good. Drinks: I had the Georgia peach (sweet & frozen), the House Merlot (very good) and The blue Long Island Iced Tea. All very good choices. Desserts: -Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake: YUM -Salted Caramel Cheesecake: DOUBLE YUM -Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel: YUMMY!! (this isn't a legit ranking. Caramel + cheesecake is always a win for me so these fun variations were amazing). There are so many other things to try!! That is what makes it a 5 star experience. The wait is the only con with this restaurant. Plan early and make sure there is that one person in the group that is willing to wait for the table while the others are running late! They're cool about letting you sit, even if the others aren't there yet. You can also order drinks at the bar while you wait."
Akisha M.,"Springfield, MA",0,18,9,5.0,5/22/2017,"I saw the cheese factory from the highway and decided to treat myself. It was 3pm so the lunch crowd was gone. Sat at the bar and had the best service. I ordered a passion mojito, which was amazing. I wanted something cheesy and hearty. I opted for the mac and cheese burger with sweet potato fries. What a delight!!!"
Martin V.,"Carlisle, MA",0,38,,1.0,8/13/2017,"No Wifi? Seriously? And they even block the mall's free Wifi? Davio's is going to bury this place, if this is any indication of how Management thinks about its customers."
Cathleen R.,"Milton, MA",0,11,6,3.0,9/27/2017,"Ehh...it's a busy chain, so you shouldn't go in with super high expectations. I was seated the other night when it was very quiet (host said ""I'll find a place to put you""... looked around for a bit, plenty of empty seats, then brought us over) and had to wait quite some time for a server to come over. She apologized for the wait, no problem. The rest of the night, however, the service was subpar. The waitress was impossible to find unless dropping off the food and hurrying away, didn't offer or give us bread, and had a very bored personality. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. Mind you I entered an hour before close, so it wasn't late enough to be rude to the staff! I was irritated when I left but not enough to keep me from coming back. Just know you're not signing up for a 5 star experience when you go here...especially with disinterested, unpersonable staff."
Heidi L.,"Dennis, MA",1,12,,2.0,9/24/2017,"Extremely slow and inattentive service. Disappointing.  My daughter's 12th bday. Everyone from the hostesses to the waitress lacked any sense of urgency with serving.  Table of five, appetizers, five entrees served randomly by four different people-- took THREE hours.  I'm sitting here still waiting for the check. :(  Update:  I noticed that the Cheesecake Factory customer service people commented back, apologizing and assuming I didn't bring up my concerns while I was still there.  I did-- more than once, to two different servers bringing our food (randomly) and also to another employee passing by while that I begged to find our bill so we could finally leave after so many hours."
S. C.,"Braintree, MA",0,9,1,4.0,3/7/2017,I typically visit Cheesecake for lunch and usually on a weekend.  I know enough to go early to avoid the long wait.  I've always been quite happy with the food and service and my kids love it.  Wish you would bring back the pretzel chicken though and add a Baked Mac n Cheese!!  Burgers are great as well as pasta.  I sometimes order an adult grilled cheese even though it's not on the menu and they always accommodate me.   Only weird thing is they include a suggested tip which is fine but it should be on the pre-tax amount of the bill and not total.
Trisha R.,"Southside, U.S. Virgin Islands",45,5,1,1.0,8/26/2017,"Not sure if it was an off night, but nonetheless our food was horrible. Except for the chicken sliders. It was a Monday night, party of 4. Our waitress kept forgetting about us. We had to send one of the plates back and normally if a plate is sent back it's taken off of the bill but NOPE, not tonight. We certainly will not be back."
Nichole C.,"Buzzards Bay, MA",102,30,13,5.0,5/29/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory and try to go as much as I can.  The service has always been good and the food is delicious and the portions are huge!
Megan F.,"Canton, MA",240,2,,3.0,11/15/2017,Really disappointed with the size of the cheesecake slices now. Total rip off. The Linda's fudge cake used to be a huge slice!! Now it seems to only be about a 3rd of what It used to be. Doesn't seem worth the money for a sliver of what the cake used to be.
J K.,"Quincy, MA",6,52,83,3.0,2/5/2017,"Brittany gets a 0. Russel gets a 5.  We've had Russel in previous visits. He's lovely, and gracious, and a good server. I hope he's appreciated."
Heather P.,"Rockland, MA",85,74,,5.0,11/23/2016,"I am always satisfied with this restaurant. I have made it known to all my loved ones that I have tried every single flavor of Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. Every single flavor, including seasonal ones. I have mentioned to the waiter once that there should be some kind of award for a person who tries every one. Perhaps a punchcard and with every slice a punch is given...in the end perhaps a free cheesake? He agreed, but...yeah nothing happened with that. Anyway! Haha. I loved every meal I ever got-alwasy tasty and perfect. I have quite the appetite but almost always have an extra meal waiting for me in the fridge due to their huge portions that turn into leftovers. (Nothing like opening the fridge the next day to see those wonderful leftovers for lunch!)  The decor, the waitstaff, the book (menu) of options for meals which is really a book. The prices, the portions, the delcious cheescake...I could go on and on. Even the wait is not that bad for a crowded Saturday night. Plenty of parking, and you have thre Southshore plaza attached.  Will have to check in again soon to see if any new flavors have developed......:-)"
Alanna S.,"Sharon, MA",234,4,,1.0,11/19/2017,"I am very disappointed with my latest experience. I usually love Cheesecake Factory, so earlier today I went to get takeout to bring to a party I was attending later. I ordered 3 spinach and artichoke dips. It took 30 minutes for them to have it ready, which was long but understandable because they were busy. After walking out with my takeout I did check to make sure they were all there. To my dismay, it was crab dip and not the spinach dip I had ordered. I went back inside and told the worker who had given me my order that it was the wrong dip, and I really could not wait another 30 minutes to get the right order. The woman said she would give me a refund, but she needed to get a manager first. 5-10 minutes later a manager finally comes over. The worker told the manager, ""They ordered crab dip, but really wanted spinach dip so now they want a refund"". No mention that it was in fact her that actually messed up the order. The manager punched in her authorization code for the refund and walked away. No apology. The worker then told us the refund would be issued in 2 days. We walked out 45 minutes later empty handed. Not once did someone say how sorry they were for the mixup. I understand that things like this happen, but I expected some sort of apology. Instead the workers and manger were rude. I sadly do not think I will ever be going back."
