Brooke D.,"East Weymouth, MA",112,24,22,2.0,6/17/2014,Just following up with my first complaint to state that the manager has since sent me an apology letter and a $50 gift certificate for the poor quality experience/cakes I received. At least they tried to make it up. So I've given an extra star for customer service.
Michael C.,"Milton, MA",55,174,99,4.0,9/18/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is always very busy. Expect to wait. The food is excellent. The deserts even better. I love the Strawberry Short Cake.  Its a chain, I have only eaten at this one a bunch of time. Its always been great."
Mark B.,"Middlesex, MA",7,43,14,2.0,5/14/2014,"Good food, premium prices and fair service.  I went with friends to this location recently to have dinner. As with all the locations, there is a wait. The location was clean and parking was kind of difficult, being in a mall on a Saturday I was expecting a wait and parking far away from it.  Once seated it took a little time for our server to get to us. Our drink order arrived and the only drink that was screwed up was, of course, mine. I ordered a light beer, but got a regular, no worries though, it was good.  our order arrived haphazardly and with some delay in the dishes. I'm used to the whole table being served at the same time, not one plate every 5 minutes or so.  As far as the meal quality itself, it was good. I ordered the Filet Minion and it was ok, I ordered med rare and it arrived medium.  As like all the other locations, it was packed.  The location was clean and pleasant. The menu has continued to expand and some of the dishes sounded appetizing."
Marlana Y.,"Boston, MA",261,264,623,5.0,1/14/2010,"I don't come here much because it's too pricy but whenever my bf offers to treat me...here we go!  The wait time can be a nuisance but it is right in the mall so you can just shop around while waiting.  The service is incredible. They are attentive and knowledgeable. The menu is vast so it can take awhile for me to figure out what I want.   I really like their free bread too! What i love to order there: LEMONADE- I love the sugar around the rim. Gets me hyper happy every time! Calamari- I have never tasted calamari as good as these. You can't get any better. It's not chewy or rubbery like some places. When you bite a piece, you can actually bite it. Its melt in your mouth wonderful! Salmon Firecrackers- Its salmon in a fried spring roll. It's something nice to try once and tasted very good. Portabella Mushroom Sandwich- I When I first ordered this it was a huge surprise.  love how greasy it is! The portabella is very juicy! I love it! Most of the sandwiches comes with fries and they are prefect to the crisp! For all those non-meat eaters out there.  and sadly, this always happens because I filled myself up, no room for dessert =("
Mandie R.,"Warwick, RI",71,35,2,4.0,2/1/2012,"This is my first time visiting this location as I usually go to the one in Providence with my boyfriend. I found this spot to be just as nice but not as crowded. I was happy to see that they have added a healthier menu filled with low calorie/fat  drinks,appetizers and entrees. They however do not have a dessert menu but no complaints as I rarely ever finish a meal nevermind have room for dessert. I decided to try the Skinny Red Sangria and it was delicious you would never know that it was a diet version of the original (which I have tried in the past) I also got the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls even though they were an appetizer they were just enough to fill me up. I left the restaurant not feeling overly full but satisfied. I also liked coming out knowing I didn't ruin my diet for the week as I am trying to lose some more weight for a ball gown I need for a Military ball I'll be attending in a couple months. I look forward to trying more from this menu. I just wish more restaurants had these types of options."
Elizabeth B.,"Quincy, MA",5,25,,2.0,5/15/2011,"Came in for brunch Sunday with my mom and sister.  Restaurant deserted (but it was 10:30 on a Sunday, probably to be expected). -2 stars for service.  Our waitress could not possibly have been LESS interested in providing adequate service to our table.  No good morning, no chit chat.  Basically: ""Do you know what you want to drink?""  Disappear for ten minutes, bring two sodas, forget my mom's juice and take another five minutes to hunt it down.  ""Know what you want for food?"" Order, and food shows up relatively quickly, which was nice.  My brioche egg sandwich however, was lukewarm, the same for my sister's eggs (hence the other missing star). At that point, we were so turned off by the indifferent service that we just wanted to finish and get out.  Cue the check, which took another ten minutes to appear after we asked for it.  Parting gift? The waitress throwing the bill on the table in front of my mother and saying ""I couldn't pronounce your last name if I tried, so here ya go.""   I'll probably be back, but only to order takeout.  I hate experiences where waitstaff make you feel like you're an intrusion on their day.  There are so many options in the greater Boston area, why bother being treated like crap first thing in the morning?"
cabrio q.,"Dedham, MA",0,66,2,4.0,7/21/2015,"I know this is a chain but I really like the menu.  I've only ate at the bar at this location and service was fine.. Nothing memorable but definitely suitable.  So many menu items to choose from its hard to pick.  The food is consistently good.  My favs are lettuce wraps, burgers, nachos, firecracker salmon rolls."
Kay D.,"Braintree, MA",0,21,7,2.0,4/24/2014,"Decent. Wait time is always ridiculous any time of the day even when you look around and all the tables are empty, and they don't even take reservation. So who are those tables for? Food is ok, service could be much better."
S X.,"Braintree, MA",0,12,,2.0,11/2/2011,"So, its the Cheesecake Factory in the mall -how much can you expect? I didn't go in with high expectations but the hubs and I wanted a drink and sweet one night sort of late and didn't want to schlep into Boston. We ordered a cosmopolitan, shared a slice of tiramisu, and he got a beer. First, the cosmo: WAY too sweet- as in, how did they even get it so sweet? They must have either added some crazy syrup or used concentrated Hfc cranberry juice or -I don't even know. I've downed few billion cosmos in my life and this was candy in a cocktail glass. It was also $11.50 (price NOT listed on the menu of course.) So I've paid that much for a cocktail plenty before, but at the mall?! in Braintree?!  The tiramisu itself was neither good nor bad. It was fine at the core- except it was covered in an ungodly (and inappropriate) amount of whipped cream. Why is there whipped cream at all on tiramisu I ask? Well, maybe because they are trying to make it fancy?  Obviously, the effect is the opposite.  The server was completely unremarkable - he was neither friendly nor rude. He could have been a robot actually. So, in many ways it was precisely what you'd expect- unremarkable, overpriced ($34 for one dessert and 2 drinks), and all around chain-ish. I now remember why I never remember it."
Kathy Y.,"Boston, MA",182,89,6,3.0,4/9/2012,"We came here on a Saturday Night around dinnertime, peaktime, 7pm.  Of course we expected that there would be an hour wait, which we totally didn't mind.  We were seated and the waitress took our orders immediately as it wasn't our first time there.  We already knew what we wanted. We shared an appetizer The Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.  This was okay, it wasn't as crispy as I expected it to be. We all ordered pastas for our main entrees.  We had finished our appetizer already and were waiting quite a while.  We had wondered what was taking so long as our entrees took over a half an hour after the appetizer to come out.  We wanted to ask what was going on and what was taking so long.   But nobody was around.  When we were finally going to ask, the waitress just came by and said sorry it's taking so long, it should be right out.  No explanations as to why. Our food finally came out after waiting a little longer.  The manager than came out to apologize about how long it took and explained that the pot that they used to boil pastas malfunctioned and it took a long time since all of us ordered pastas.  I guess at least he came to apologize about the wait.   I had the  Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  This is always excellent and didnt' disappoint me.  Portion sizes are big at the cheesecake factory as regulars should already know.  I ended up taking half of it home.    I ordered a red velvet cheesecake to go.  This was a disappointment sadly, I swear the portion sizes for cheesecake use to be larger in the past. Overall the food is still good there, the staff was nice, but the wait was just a little longer than usual this past night we went."
Sharon C.,"Pembroke, MA",0,3,,1.0,6/14/2015,Worst experience. Service was terrible - waited 20 minutes to be greeted and then another 10 just for drinks and silverware. Waitress could care less and manager was no where to be found. Food was cold and taste less. To cap it off the bathroom was filthy. Don't go here!!!
Melanie C.,"Quincy, MA",0,5,,4.0,5/26/2015,Went to the Cheesecake Factory for Sunday brunch.  Delicious!  Ordered pancakes and it came with maple butter syrup that was so good!  I also love their pretzel crusted chicken!!  Servers are always great about refilling drinks without being asked.
Rob S.,"Quincy, MA",113,21,,4.0,3/19/2014,"I love this restaurant. I never deviate from the BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad. The drinks are great, the appetizers are delicious, and, of course, the cheesecake is to die for. I love this place and would recommend it to anybody who wants to grab a bite to eat and have dessert too!"
Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,156,41,4.0,3/30/2011,"Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants... I always make it a habit to go when I'm back in Braintree. We had the NICEST waitress... she was a funny, Irish woman who was so accommodating and was genuinely upset when our order got mixed up. Also the manager came over immediately to apologize, offered food while we waited for the new dish, and was beyond nice. SUPERB service! Try the louisiana chicken pasta or the pasta da vinci -- love those dishes. Also the peach bellini was delicious."
Kacie D.,"Boston, MA",23,153,19,5.0,4/13/2011,"I am a very frequent visitor to the Cheesecake Factory in in Braintree. I have no idea why so many people have so much to complain about. Everyone I've ever spoken with only has good things to say about this restaurant, myself included.  First...the wait. Yes, there is always a long wait at this restaurant. But you know...really, don't you know this going in? If you go early or later then you can avoid it. if you like the restaurant enough, you'll go at an ""off"" time or you'll sit out the wait. Is it the restaurant's fault that they're popular and busy? Should they build an extra story for you to provide you with extra seating? My opinion is that you get what you wait for! Good things come to those who wait, and this is no exception. I have been served by many servers here, all of whom have been attentive, friendly and professional. They know the menu inside and out which is a huge feat considering the menu is about 100 pages long. The food always comes out faster than expected and is piping hot.  Every menu item I have ever tried is delicious! My personal favorites are the Pasta DaVinci, the Chicken Madera and the Factory Chopped Salad. All of the desserts are amazing because it's their specialty! Their cheesecake selection is overwhelming. The Adam's and the Red Velvet are exceptionally good.  If anyone is reading this and has never been to this establishment, I recommend disregarding some of the more miserable people who have posted here and have nothing intelligent or useful to say."
Thanh L.,"Stoughton, MA",146,322,241,2.0,9/5/2011,The wait time is crazy and the food is not good. Its pretty pricey to eat there.
Joe Z.,"Plymouth, MA",36,6,4,5.0,1/23/2013,"Had a great dinner at the Cheesecake Factory .  My wife and I got a couple of gift cards for Christmas .      My wife ,my two yr old daughter and I went out for dinner on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was very clean and had soft music playing. The waitress was very nice. She promptly took our drink order and brought us our bottle of wine  and our daughters juice. She also brought us plenty of sliced bread and butter, and also brought sliced banana for my daughter. ( anyone who has a young child knows just how much a simple thing like that can make a huge difference in the dinning experience) . She was very helpful in explaining the different meals , and in making suggestions on appetizers etc.    The meals were great . I had the Chicken  Bellagio , and my wife had the Macaroni and Cheese Burger . Both fantastic. My daughter just nibbled off our plates.     For dessert we went with the Banana Cream Cheesecake. Delicious . The atmosphere was what I call ""Mall Fancy""  But all in all a very nice experience . Didn't taste like your typical chain restaurant food.  We will defiantly return.                        ---------------Thank You."
Leanna S.,"Foxborough, MA",75,46,241,5.0,12/28/2013,"Excellent waiter, Scott. We have only ever had an issue with one waitress in Nashville, TN. The portions are large indeed, but you don't have to eat it all in one setting, so for those complaining, stop. Unless it's something fried, it will generally reheat well. We get different items as much as possible due to an extensive menu ( which is daunting sometimes). But appreciate the new additions to the skinny menu. Don't come here for ""light and healthy"", but do come here for tasteful and plentiful. The arugula is bitter, so you may want a Caesar salad instead of garden. But we generally enjoy everything. The bread is great and the lunch portions are still very generous. We appreciate the decor and understand that the building needs to meet the demands of the people, but if you're looking for small and quaint, this is not your place. It's generally busy if not packed with a waiting line. Be prepared to wait except during off peak times 2-5pm. Great cheesecake, Hershey's looks like a big glob of chocolate, but the rest are beautifully presented. I highly recommend the seasonal cakes. Enjoy!"
Sarah A.,"Pembroke, MA",0,9,,5.0,2/14/2015,"Well done, Cheesecake Factory, on a snowy Saturday V-Day.  Long wait but great service and food. Well worth it!"
Mia s.,"Plymouth, MA",0,17,,1.0,2/18/2016,"horrible !! service was very lousy and inattentive. we were there today for a late lunch, took forever for drink refill had to ask for bread 4 times !! and the waitress just shrugged her shoulders. very disappointing !!"
