Joshua D.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2016,"I have been to this Cheesecake location about 6-7 times. And every single time my wife and I have been disappointed. You might ask why would you return after a bad dining experience? Well we really like the Cheesecake Restaurant Chain, we have gone to the one in Back Bay, Burlington, North Shore, Providence Place, and all have excellent food and great service (Providence have hiccups in service and waiting here and there). So after a bad experience we seem to convince ourselves again to forget the past and give it a new shot. But after our last experience I don't think we will be dining there ever again. We have had all sort of issues at this location. From our waiter forgetting the bread, to our waiter forgetting about us completely. On our second visit we were sat and ordered our food, and it took about an hour and a half for it to arrive, it was 4 PM by the way. Cold food Check, forgetting drinks check, waiter never checking back after food arrives check. Another visit I had was when I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, and the dish came impossibly salty (I asked them to try it and take it back). And in our most recent and last visit our fried calamari plate came to our table looking like a mess, like it had just been dropped on the floor and quickly put back on to the plate (I knew this because the cocktail sauce was everywhere). Cheesecake is our favorite restaurant and I had to be disappointed, but if you plan on going to cheesecake go to another location, and if you still come to this one, don't judge cheesecake as a whole based on this location."
Anonymous B.,"Boston, MA",2,117,,4.0,9/20/2016,Went here for the first time last night. The food was really good and the portions were huge. It is a little pricey but again they give you a lot of food. It's very dark in there and the seating is tight. I'll definitely come back though.
Kimberly B.,"Fort Myers, FL",89,27,6,5.0,5/22/2015,"My roommate and I chose to go to this spot after seeing the copious amount of vegan options they had on the menu. (well vegetarian, but you can make them vegan). We sat at a high top table at the bar because the wait looked long for a dining table. Boy did we have the right idea! We had the best service I have received in a very long time. Our waitress, SamL caught us off guard welcoming us in the most bubbly of manors. We had a few questions about the menu, as my friend cannot eat any dairy or meat. Sam knew the entire menu (and that says something for a menu that's multiple pages long). We were able to get two very tasty dishes! As far as food goes! I ordered the mac and cheese balls for an appetizer, and Kayla ordered sweet potato fries. When I say melt in your mouth cheese balls...I mean it. The sweet potato fries are satisfyingly crispy as well! By the time our entrees came we were too full to even eat half! They made for delicious left overs.  The drinks were sub par, definitely not what we wanted, but they were still good enough to order a second.  I will absolutely go back and request Sam...and the cheese balls."
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",158,857,3017,4.0,2/9/2012,"Love this place, what can I say....  The wait is usually a little longer than I love to wait with a toddler, but last time I went the hostess that sat us suprised me & asked if she could bring the baby Bread & Bananas - ""WHAT, ABsolutley?!?!?""... It soo occupied him & he was having the greatest little time with his plate... Kept him from that akward before his food gets there moments...  Food was as always - DELISH... Can never decide, would like to order the App Comboby myself but that could be a little gluttenous... So Ill stick to my Corn Tamale Cakes & Thai Lettuce Wraps... Hmmmm Now I want to go now...  Will always love Cheesecake - You just have a special place in my heart!"
Thomas W.,"Roslindale, MA",23,11,6,1.0,10/8/2014,"Let me start this by saying that Cheesecake Factory restaurants, overall, are great locations for eating out. The granite Abe south shore plaza location is a growing FAILURE. From management to the chefs, this location struggles on a regular basis. Case in point- I ordered a Louisiana Chicken Pasta to go from the location. I arrived and waited for the order outside. After several minutes I finally decided to just go in and get it. The server told me they were bringing it out from the kitchen that moment. I went home. What I received looked as if it had been microwaved several times over. The chicken was hard and near plastic- it just wasn't edible . Clearly they had not just cooked this but decided to throw this in the warmer and, with no care, just shove it out to me. I noticed this terrible meal, called the restaurant and received a ""manager""... He told me they would send a gift card in the mail... LIES- nothing came (after a week) an I called back to the restaurant to deal with the matter. I was told they did not have a manager by that name and that I would have to come back in again to deal with it. I reordered the same meal and THEY DID IT AGAIN- same disgusting rewarmed leftover from someone else's plate.  The manager was immediately contCted and told he would remake it and it would be to my liking. I took that THIRD plate of the same meal home... What do you think happened- THE SAME DISGUSTING LEFTOVER REWARMED GARBABGE.  So, I would suggest going to cheesecake and utterly avoiding the braintree south shore location.... They can't get it right. Don't believe me - take a peek at the pics of this terrible meal.  By the way, I wish yelp allowed for 1/2 stars. That would be reserved for locations like this - they are restaurants in name only."
Meagan M.,"Fall River, MA",37,1,,5.0,4/23/2016,Pasta carbonara was amazing.  Definitely recommend this dish to anyone. I've had authentic Italian pasta carbonara before and this was just as good as those
Jane B.,"Brockton, MA",29,8,1,2.0,4/22/2017,"1 hour wait for two, 25 minutes for four....ok, we'll wait....get a table in the poorly lit dining room, husband had to go out to read menu....long convoluted meun, ok, we order....app.shows in 20, cold...ok, burgers will be worth the wait , do you have to ask for bread?.....never offered....40 minutes, good burger, cold fries.....ok, not one word from waitress as in how is everything? ok, wave down waitress to get check, never again, ok, way better spots in this area.....disappointing, no doubt."
Daniel I.,"Boston, MA",54,27,63,3.0,5/12/2015,Went on a group outing and we decided to go to the cheesecake factory. We were seated right away. It was a busy Friday evening our waitress was having a tough time remembering small stuff like our drinks the main reason i love the cheesecake factory is the wheat bread with butter she forgot that too. The service was bad but the food was great i got the cuban sandwich it was delicious the pulled pork was well season the toasted bread with the mayo was awesome. The person who made this sandwich must've gone to sandwich prep school it was the best sandwich of the day. My girlfriend got the chicken alfredo it was nice and creamy and a nice spice at the end.
Anna B.,"Raymond, ME",0,4,,2.0,6/13/2016,"Arrived at lunchtime yesterday.   I was early and waited for my party to arrive, as they wouldn't seat me until 60% of my party was in the restaurant.  When we were all assembled, we went bk to the hostess to be seated.  She abruptly told us to ""stand over here"", to the left of hostess station---apparently she didn't want people standing near her.  We were sat at a really nice round table.  The waitress was clearly new. She had waaaay too many tables and was overwhelmed.  We waited a very very long time for our drinks because she forgot them----twice.  We ordered ALOT of food---we ordered as if money wasn't an object.  The food was fine---very average, but served hot and the order was correct.  That said, the service was painstakingly slow---OMG.  The most offensive part of the meal was when we were sitting at the table, a bus boy who was pushing a cart across the patio outside hurled and expelled an incredible amount of saliva and mucus out of his mouth ONTO the outdoor patio.   I was horrified, but didn't want to ruin the meals of my friends and family.  To top it off, the woman sitting at the table next to us, FLOSSED her teeth at the table at the end of her meal.  It was disgusting.   This place is gross."
Jocelyn H.,"Roslindale, MA",4,17,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Oh boy, what can I say. If you are dining in a restaurant that SAYS it offers gluten-free, then you had better train your staff to know how to really confirm that items are cooked the way they need to be cooked. Saying things like, ""we don't THINK it should be a problem"" or ""That's just the color of the water"" does NOT instill confidence. This is a fast-food restaurant that really shouldn't do more than breakfast and cheesecake. My friend had to send her food back (without eating it) and they charged us for her drinks even though they didn't feed her (she has very serious food allergies.) Very poorly handled."
Eric P.,"Billerica, MA",121,185,64,3.0,4/26/2013,"Cheesecake factory, your lighting and ambiance reminds me of a restaurant that would be found in Jurassic Park. Pam our waitress was glorious, almost TOO good at refilling our drinks. The glasses for beverages are already pretty huge, but I had no less than 5 refills during the meal, even though I hadn't completely finished the previous glasses. Stomachache ensued. Food is what you would expect from a large chain, it's pretty delish but I wouldn't expect to see it on the front of Food Network magazine. Portions are also HUGE, I always take home half, even being 6'4"" and built like a brick shthouse.   This place did not get four stars because of the seating. You are SO close to other patrons it is ridiculous. And always packed to the brim with people. I would of rather had a bit of a wait then being squeezed between two people.  One mans hand roamed over to my leg by accident thinking it was his dates, not to mention I could barely talk dirty to my date without the other people around us listening to our leather daddy fetishes. Other than that though, great selection of cheesecake!"
Baran A.,"Boston, MA",8,34,6,4.0,4/24/2016,The menu selection is very good - quality is good too and the staff do a good job - they are always busy at this location so it always takes time to get a table but I can't fault them for being good - the only negative is the prices - they are a bit over the top - $8.95 for a slice of cheese cake but I will go back !
Shelly M.,"Falls Church, VA",1,13,,1.0,6/11/2016,"I would give absolutely NO stars if I could. This place is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to!  The management is poor at best.  I waited 30 minutes for a to go order of cake that was pre-ordered on the phone for pickup.  I went back to the register after noticing that everyone else who arrived after me was gone.  After discussing my observation to the cashier, the other cashier looks, and it had been sitting in the refrigerator the entire time!  No I'm sorry!  No attempt to resolve the mistake on their behalf. I approached the manager expecting more than just an ""I'm sorry"", which is exactly what I received.  My 4 year old son can, and does, resolve issues better than the Cheesecake Factory manager.  Never again!"
Michael C.,"West Bridgewater, MA",20,35,2,4.0,2/19/2016,Always consistent with both the wait and food quality.  They obviously do a great job of training their staff as all employees are very professional.
Emily R.,"Boston, MA",57,189,13,1.0,3/6/2013,"Right now, let me make it clear, the ONE start is for the food. The food was fine, the usual cheesecake factory food. The service was AWFUL. First of all the hostess was rude, she directed us around like she was Hitler, were you even trained?! Our server, Colleen R, was the worst. I have had better service at McDonalds. First we sit down and she takes forever to come over, then we ordered drinks, we asked for waters too. She never brings them. We ask for water again, and some more bread. She brings the water, but no bread.....we finally get that too...when our food arrives.. Right when we ordered drinks, my friend showed Colleen her i.d (it was her birthday) and I even said, Hey Colleen, its her birthday!!! So we eat, colleen rarely comes by at all, I wanted another drink but forget it. We ordered cheesecake, Colleen comes over and tells me the strawberry cheesecake is frozen so what else do i want (doesnt bring me a menu) ..** All this is happening while Colleen is eye fucking and flirting with the table of six guys next to us..too bad we didn't have dicks i guess!*** Colleen brings out the cheesecake, doesnt sing to my friend. People are being sang to all over the place, but not her! okay fine.... BUT THEN...minutes later...Colleen brings the guys next to us their dessert and sings and claps and makes a huge deal about their Birthday........................................................................................................... Thank you for ruining the Birthday Dinner Cheesecake...thank you."
Danielle S.,"Weymouth, MA",3,5,1,3.0,2/27/2016,"The food is good not amazing. Always packed and at least an hour wait on the weekends but it's a nice environment and the bread and drinks are good! The chicken piccata and lemon garlic shrimp are two good meal choices. Overall though the place is overpriced in my opinion, but a fun night out when you get gift cards from family or friends!"
Vanessa L.,"Boston, MA",0,11,12,3.0,8/30/2015,"Granted it's the weekend and the restaurant is a bit busy but the bakery didn't have a line and I waited about 15 minutes to someone to get a frozen cake (original, not a specialty cake) from the freezer for me to go..."
Kelly C.,"Brockton, MA",0,2,,1.0,6/7/2016,"Rude staff, disgusting food which was way too expensive. Definitely won't be returning."
Andy L.,"Canton, MA",0,3,,1.0,9/17/2016,Showed up at the braintree location at six with my 80 year old parents and did not get a table until 8:20 got several apologies from the hostess about the wait but nobody really seemed to care or have any idea what they were doing  the managers were no where in sight and the wait staff was overwhelmed don't know how you can be so incompetent and keep your doors open
Shawn F.,"Marblehead, MA",52,8,,5.0,7/1/2015,This is a nice Place to eat .  We ordered a lot of food and it was all good .  Friendly service. Along with great food gives it the five stars.  Desert always so good.
