Jake G.,"Quincy, MA",6,17,1,2.0,11/23/2014,On my 28 years of life in this beautiful world. My first experience at the Cheesecake Factory was a couple weeks ago. And I wasn't impressed      I got the feel of an Applebee's dressed in white. ALL WHITE. The food was meh and the service was the same. I had the fish and chips. It was ok but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Only to write yelp about. I would go back I guess if I had to. Not a fan. I don't trust anyone dressed in all white slangin cheesecakes.  Jus sayin
Brittany H.,"Braintree, MA",4,16,,2.0,7/27/2015,"My family and I just moved to Braintree from Texas. We were super excited that there was a Cheesecake Factory right down the road from our new home. Having two young children who love this restaurant, we've already frequented it 5 or 6 times. I've tried so hard to want to go back seeing as it's so convenient, but the service has been so awful each time, that for the money, we'd rather go elsewhere. The food has been delicious each and every time we go, but for some reason, we wait at least 20 minutes AFTER being seated to have just our drink order taken. By this time, we are ready to order as well except I guess that's a little too much for the staff since we don't even get our drinks until our food has almost been brought out. For me, drinks are equally as important. I am a diet coke drinker and usually go through about 2 refills. I don't think I've ever been given a refill the times we went at this location.  My point is, the food is fantastic, but the young staff that is employed at this location is very below par. When you spend the amount of money we do at a restaurant as a family (which is at least 100 if not more), you expect better service - or at least average service. If this location could clean up their act a bit, it would be a must go."
Peter D.,"Stoughton, MA",0,8,,1.0,7/27/2015,"Last Saturday night, my wife and I went to this location.  They said it would be about 20 minutes wait but it was more like 40 minutes.   In the restaurant, the ""background music"" was so loud, it was like being at a night club.  I mentioned it to the front desk and I was told she would mention it to the manager IF she saw her. About 15 minutes later, my wife tracked down the manager and was told the music was automatically controlled and nothing could be done. The temperature in the restaurant was too cold and again, nothing could be done. When my wife ordered her Evelyn's Pasta dish,  she specifically requested that it be hot.  When it arrived, it was cold.  She sent it back and ONE minute later it came back and it was still too cold to eat. The waitress came back, we told her it was inedible and she took it away and off the bill.  This left her with nothing to eat and I had basically finished my meal. This location is patronized because it is inside the mall and it is convenient.  We will not be back."
Khoa N.,"New York, NY",79,170,270,4.0,3/18/2013,"Dim lighting, good service, big portions, and good food. Cheesecake makes a perfect place for any type of gathering, whether it's a family outing, a romantic date, or a fun rendezvous with some great friends. A few of my favorites. 1.) 1st and always, the honey wheat black bread. I can eat a whole roll and more if I momentarily forget the gigantic entree to await, along with the infamous amt of calories branded to these Cheesecake dishes. 2.) Chicken marsala with the bowties. The chicken is tender, the mushroom is tasty, and the sauce is amazing. 3.) Luau salad. This will appear like a mountain before you, but it is so delicious that before you're aware of stuffing bite after bite down your mouth, the mountain is conquered. 4.) The cheesecakes. If you still have room in that belly of yours, any of their dessert selections will complete your night.  I enjoy all my dinners at the Cheesecake Factory. The only downfall is that I wouldn't dare eat here often, unless I split my meals into 2 or 3 portions to cover my next day's consumption as well."
Lizzie P.,"Quincy, MA",0,6,,4.0,1/30/2015,"I honestly used to go here all the time after my parents and I have our weekly shopping trips to the mall. Whether lunch or dinner or after school or something... this was where I'd used to come. I came here last week before the blizzard, and not that I don't love the food, it's that my food came out about close to cold- as nearly not hot as I normally would like to have my food.  I will say that I absolutely still love their cheesecakes, sucker for the tiramisu.  I'd recommend the miso salmon... however, caution yourself with the thousands of calories of that plate placed in front of you."
My H.,"Stoughton, MA",6,33,99,4.0,12/10/2014,"We went here during a mini snow storm and wanted to get some crab cake sandwich (off menu) and a strawberry lemonade before they close. Fortunately they allowed us to order and we took advantage of their free cheesecake slice w/ a purchase of a $25 gc. There was a similar deal with 2 cheesecake slices via their website for BF.  Anyways we had a good time and the crab cake sandwich with the sauce is amazing even though it's kinda expensive (15). My gf got a fish taco plate and that wasn't great. Not worth it in my opinion.  Overall, we had a good time. Our waiter was nice even when he keeps making small mistakes."
Vy N.,"Dorchester, MA",0,5,8,5.0,4/13/2015,"LOVE the pasta. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is amazing too. Honestly, I used to come here for that Honey Wheatbread. Its so good with that butter. Waiters are courteous but if you're there on a Saturday Night, there is a 30-45 wait for a table."
Angela M.,"Brighton, MA",121,9,4,1.0,8/27/2014,"Let me start off by saying The Cheesecake Factory is my all time favorite restaurant. That being said this is the worst location I have ever been to. I typically would not take my time to come on here for a bad review especially because every time is not going to be the best experience - but when the last three times have all been AWFUL experiences I figured I should voice it after all it is my money that went to waste. 1st bad experience - we were told it was a 20 minute wait turned into waiting for 45 minutes. We got seated our server was never informed another 10 minutes before we were approached. I don't blame her I get it they were too busy for their staff to manage correctly she was very pleasant. I was with a friend we both ordered same meal the Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoe which is my favorite but not when it comes out with watered sauce and no flavor. The server explained they had new cooks... I never send my food back but we did. We opted with just getting apps but by the time we actually got them neither of us we're hungry so we ended up getting to go boxes. To put in perspective we got there at 6 and didn't leave until 9:30 between the ""20 minute wait"" and everything else. 2nd bad experience - we were seated in the bar which is fine different server again wasn't told we were seated eventually made it over and apologized - but it wasn't a busy night. I believe then our salads were forgotten to be entered because the people who came after us with pasta dishes came out before ours. 3rd bad experience - this past weekend sat outside with the nice weather at a DIRTY table with no silverware or plates server drops off the bread and runs for the hills. Didn't make a big deal just ate at the dirty table had another employee grab us silverware. We order our food and my friends food comes out completely wrong. Again didn't bother to complain. It's unfortunate this location does such a poor job and gives the franchise a bad rep."
Casey O.,"Boston, MA",3,15,,4.0,8/23/2016,There are so many options of food to choose from here. I have a gluten allergy and found it extremely helpful that they label everything that is gluten free on the menu. I had the guacamole to start and the chicken lettuce wraps for a meal. They were both good! My only complaint would be that the chicken wraps had a little too much slaw in them for my liking. My boyfriend got one of the salad options and let me just say - the salads are HUGE. I think multiple people could split it. Our server was so nice and accommodating when I mentioned my allergy.
Nandanie S.,"Quincy, MA",418,523,355,5.0,6/10/2013,"Must try: Skinny Licious menu - Sauteed chicken pasta, turkey burger, chicken enchilada Regular menu - sandwiches, burgers, chicken romano, AND cheesecake of course. I had their low carb cheesecake a few times, and it's really good. Makes me feel a little less guilty when it comes to the thought of cheesecake."
Francisca W.,"Boston, MA",128,470,1014,2.0,9/21/2014,"knowing how busy i could be, i dropped off my friend while i looked for parking, just so she could get ahead in line for a table (for 2) at 7pm on a Saturday. 10 min or so later i walked in, passing the patio which had PLENTY of two-seater tables, yet my friend reported that not only she didn't get a table immediately, she didn't even get a pager!!!  she was told to ""come back in 15 min"" because they ran out of pagers just now, but saw that people after her getting pagers one after another.  hmmmm interesting.  we then re-approached the counter and were given a pager right away.  asked if it would be faster if we chose to sit outside, was told by this snobbish host ""yes"" matter-of-factly without even bothering to look up.  thinking back, she was never asked whether she would like to sit outside, either.   but please explain to me why we weren't seated already when there were at least 4-5 EMPTY 2-pax tables out in the patio, along with couple more 4-seaters outside??  meanwhile, the line to approach his Majesty was a mile long at the hostess stand, with more crowds around the waiting area and outside, eager to be seated. 3 minutes we got our pager, we decided to go to Johnny Rockets instead -- had a great meal there, and for cheaper!!  came back to return the pagers a couple hours later when it was muuuuch less busy (still people waiting for a table, at 9:30pm!).  but once again, the host (the other one) didn't even bother looking up when there was a patron approaching. i don't understand this place and why it's so packed all the time, esp when you're constantly being treated like peasants.  really."
Victoria C.,"Weymouth, MA",0,39,,1.0,10/11/2016,"I came here last weekend with my boyfriend on a saturday night. We were told there was over an hour wait, typical for a saturday, so we got our buzzer and sat down. About thirty minutes later a girl sits on the side of us with our friends and begins her one hour wait. Twenty minutes after that she decides to go complain to see if she can get a table faster. Mind you her party was bigger than ours. And she comes back laughing because she succeeded. So her and her friends get seated before us. Im very dissapointed in the management for this. We stayed and waited our renmaining twenty minutes or so and had an awesome meal with an awesome waitress, i wish i remembered her name so i could give her some credit. However i cannot believe that management just gave this girl who complained a table, which probably shouod have gone to someone who was patiently waiting. So not how you run a business. If we had no already been waiting over forty five minutes and had a giftcard to spend we probably would have left, the girl also thought it was a huge hilarious joke. Ha ha. Very funny. I wish i could give zero stars for the management team. Not how you handle customer service. Five stars for our waitress and my chicken picatta, it seems its always the little people who keep the place going."
Candice M.,"Randolph, MA",160,37,13,1.0,6/14/2015,I went here today for the last time. We had the worst service and there were toothpick plastic pieces in my pasta. After I told the manager. He told me he'd take the pasta off our bill and remake another minus the plastic pieces. Well needless say he gave me a slice of cheesecake and then recharged me for the newly made pasta. -_- why he offered to take it off and remake it is beyond me. Needless to say I paid for the pasta and the Cheesecake Factory lost two loyal customers. I hope they are happy!
Barbara T.,"Dorchester Center, MA",0,6,,4.0,2/5/2015,"Beautiful restaurant, but their waits are ridiculous almost an hour wait for a table on a Saturday/Friday night. So weekdays are always the best days to catch them. The host in the front with curly hair was very nice and friendly. Service and food was great. My go to place for birthdays/family dinners. *I'm also a vegetarian and there were a lot of options which is another reason I love this place."
Helga M.,"Brockton, MA",6,4,1,2.0,1/22/2015,I love the cheesecake factory but I will never go to the restaurant in Braintree again.  The last two times I've gone there was dirty silverware on the table.  I don't mean water spots but actual food on it.  The service was great as usual but the food was flavorless. The spicy chicken tacos had no spice.  The server said they ran out of the sauce that goes on it.  Why not tell us ahead of time and give us a chance to pick something else.  The buffalo blasts had literally 1 small piece of chicken.  It was just fried dough.  The girls at the front desk will ignore you and have a private conversation.  Thank God for our waiter his personality salvaged the night.  The wait is too long for a below average experience.
max p.,"Foxborough, MA",1,71,16,1.0,7/3/2016,"Thanks for the stupid response. So should I tell this location to match the standard of the other cheesecake factory locations for the food I order?? I should not have to. Every other location I went to made the food correctly. Not flavorless like this location. SMH."" Please customize my order to match the standard at every other cheesecake factory location"" Hahah wow"
Michael S.,"Pembroke, MA",17,39,,1.0,4/20/2015,"Service SUCKS!  Waiting 20 minutes and yet there is a booth right here that hasn't been bused. 3 bus boys/waiters standing around talking. Manager is non existent.  Update, after asking 3 times for that table and being told no, our turn came up and we got THAT TABLE!  Food was delicious  two different orders of wine took over 10 minutes each."
Ann M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/30/2016,"I ordered chicken Alfredo and it was a little watery so I sent it back and yet again it was watery but our waitress and the manager were literally so nice about it, the manager came back to our table twice to apologize and it was just so nice and he took it off our bill. Although the food wasn't ideal the staff made it a good experience!"
Steven S.,"Sharon, MA",29,80,165,4.0,7/14/2014,"My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised with our dinner here. It had been quite a few years since we swore we wouldn't come back after numerous  bad food and service experiences. Glad we returned! From the initial welcome to the crisp and personable service by our waitress Kaitlynn K, everyone we interacted with were warm and friendly. And the food was really, really good. My Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club was delicious and my wife's Mexican Tortilla Salad with avocado was tasty and plentiful. Sorry, no dessert review here, for we're both dairy free and, of ALL places, they don't have any cheesecake alternative for us (which is why I didn't give a 5 star rating). We will be back!!"
ThomaS T.,"Westminster, CA",0,104,110,3.0,8/20/2015,"Shrimp bistro - it's ok. Hardly any flavor . Mediocre pieces of shrimp. Hardly any mushroom toppings.  Strawberry short cake- biscuits were not warned , they were hard as a rock . Ice cream, had no frost bites on it , so it was good . Whipped cream was ok , at least they didn't use cool whip .  Warned biscuits on bottom of melting ice cream would have been great . Service - alright not bad ."
