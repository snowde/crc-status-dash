Kemi A.,"Portland, OR",131,654,34,4.0,2/15/2012,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before? There's a reason why this is a cult favorite among family, friends, and coworkers. The Cheesecake Factory is simply the shit.  It's important that you have reservations, otherwise you'll be noshing on the cheesecake on display before you are given a table. The staff are very friendly and polished, so it makes you feel like you're at a very posh place. The menu is extensive, I'm not kidding it's as thick as a Bible! Do yourself a favor and check online before you go in. The CF does a good job with variety, but if you're looking for something halfway healthy, GTFO. There's also options for vegetarians/vegans, but not so much. Always ask your server before you order.  I was there on a business lunch, and the food was delicious! We started with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant rolls, and popcorn shrimp as appetizers. Then I had the seared salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus--yum! That and with a strawberry lemonade drink made my life complete.  After stuffing yourself with 2308345893485 calories, you have to have cheesecake!! What kind? Well when I looked it was over 40+ of them. I had the Pecan cheesecake which was to die for, good luck trying to eat it all after that big meal! Needless to say you won't have to eat for the next two weeks."
Justin M.,"Marlborough, MA",1,1,,1.0,5/22/2015,"Waited forever for my Drink and food. Place sucks, overpriced and trendy. (I.E.) ohhhhhhhhhhh, I went to the cheesecake factory last night, im so cooooooooollllll lets take a selfie here so people can see how cool we are. People make me sick"
Sara M.,"Quincy, MA",1,7,2,4.0,10/13/2015,This is always a good place for a pasta fix.  The place is generic but the food tastes great.  I had pasta da Vinci.  The sauce makes the food tastes sweet and good.  Unfortunately the chicken was unevenly sauced.  Some pieces taste plain hence 4 stars.  Yuji was my waiter and he was very pleasant.
James C.,"Holyoke, MA",11,50,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Waiters here are absolutely moronic to say the least. Very ignorant. I ordered the filet mignon and they brought a fork and a spoon to the table. I asked for a knife, took them over 15 minutes before they got me one. Food was cold by then. This is what you could expect from the hands of minimum wage."
Jack J.,"Canton, MA",0,34,,4.0,5/14/2016,"A step up from your run of the mill three star chain restaurant experiences. Decent food, excellent selection and good atmosphere make it very good. Cattle call, assembly line run 'em through & move 'em out process combined with average & impersonal wait & reception staff keep TCF from being a truly great experience."
Zachary W.,"Boston, MA",22,5,,1.0,10/9/2013,"I've been to this location a few times before.  It is a cheesecake factory, nothing special.  So I would typically rate it a 3.  However, time management is horrendous and tonight (Saturday) was the last straw.  Was told over an hour, which is fine for a group of 9 on a busy night.  Killed time by shopping...went back an hour later and was told 5-10 minutes.  Checked in 3 times, every 10 minutes with the last time resulting in another 10-20 minutes instead.  The time kept getting greater!  Other groups were complaining about misinformation as well.  Hosts weren't communicating each other and even took people that were just walking in and having them seated while groups were still waiting!  A host next to me literally said ""I can seat a group of 5.""  When the other hostess asked which party he sat he said ""they just came in, no name."" The whole time was wasted and with a plethora of options in the area we left and said we had enough.  Not even an apology.  Poorly managed...and they should expect to be busy on a weekend.  (I wrote this on my phone as we were leaving)"
Davis J.,"Chicago, IL",533,425,259,3.0,7/25/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect example for what is wrong with America. 100 page menu? Of course. Seating for a million? Why not. Insane Portions? Durrr. This location is always slammed with peeps trying to get their glutton on. Get in early to beat the crowd. Note: The best item on their menu are the 'Vietnamese Tacos.' Three little steamed bao buns filled with juicy pork belly and pickled veggies. Delicious. As of August 1st they will no longer be on the menu. FML.
Chandra L.,"Randolph, MA",37,3,,3.0,12/2/2015,"The service is good. But the food is lackluster. Maybe I have a tendency towards now flavorful foods but I find most of their offerings bland. The cheesecake, however, is to die for."
Brittney V.,"Stoughton, MA",275,13,8,4.0,12/22/2014,"What do you people expect from a Chain Restaurant? MY GOODNESS, the way you people write reviews is a bit over the top -_- a majority of you need to step off your pedestals & be more realistic. The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on the higher end of chains. It's atmosphere is nice and overall the service is good considering how busy it gets. God bless the hostesses, they don't get cut enough slack. What do you expect the wait to be on a busy Saturday night?! It was long but the hostesses are easy to converse with. Anywhooooo I Loved my stuffed mushrooms & going through a miso salmon phase. Delicious is an understatement. For Desert- Linda's Chocolate cake... Legit everything. I had a good time at the Cheesecake Factory but at the same time, I never walk into restaurants looking for things to complain about."
Kelly F.,"North Providence, RI",169,309,45,3.0,10/8/2013,I don't see what the big deal is. In my opinion it's overrated. I like this location better than Providence. The service is better but still mediocre. Food is decent. The salads are good. Overpriced but good. Nothing blows me away. They have a good variety of beers and drinks. It's a decent place for drinks with friends but I personally wouldn't do a date night here.
Gee S.,"Hyde Park, MA",7,5,,2.0,12/17/2014,Food is usually good. ... service is lousy. .. always an issue with my takeout. ... food is so good I keep coming back. Most of the time they mess something up. ... then I have to complain. ..2 stars is a gift. .. maybe they will wake up some day. . This place had so much business they probably dont care if half the people are dissatisfied.
Marc B.,"Delray Beach, FL",47,120,7,3.0,8/18/2013,"I've never been  big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but my wife and I were given gift certificates, so we had no choice.   We went on a Friday evening around 6pm.  Expecting it to be busy, we were surprised when we got seated immediately. Service was very good.   We ordered burgers that were actually cooked to order, except they put cheese on my wife's when she specifically didn't order it.  The server took it back and got it fixed quickly.   The manager even came by to apologize. The food is good. Although overpriced.  The cheesecakes are great.  Noisy atmosphere.   Where did all the quiet restaurants go?"
Tunisia M.,"San Francisco, CA",51,109,,3.0,8/31/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. While not sucking, there's not much wow factor either. The entrees takes up the lower half of the ratings, with over sized portions of food with not a whole lot of flavor.  The cheesecake on the other hand deserves the higher half as do the drinks-you can't really go wrong with any of the lemonades. Some of my favorite cheesecake flavors are the key lime, original and dulce de leche. Probably best to just come for the specialty next time."
Ryu J.,"Raynham, MA",133,9,22,4.0,3/19/2014,One of the best pasta dishes money can buy most definitely especially if your a pasta lover like me. Great customer service just try not to go there towards the week to avoid long wait time of holidays
Christopher T.,"San Diego, CA",13,202,2,2.0,5/12/2013,"I've been to many cheesecake factory restaurants and in general,  the service is very good along with the food. My biggest concern is the large offerings of food, I think they should focus more on a few select items and improve their quality rather than try to do too many thing at once. The main issue I have with the south shore plaza location is that the chicken & biscuits meal I ordered was lukewarm and after the staff supposedly warmed it up, it was still unacceptable. The waitress almost had an attitude so of course I didn't leave her a monetary tip, I wrote on the check that next time she should smile more and complain less. I have no plans of ever going back to that location."
Mike R.,"Canton, MA",0,7,,1.0,11/14/2015,"Called to ask what I might expect for a wait at 6pm.  The maitre 'd groaned over the phone and hing up on me. I haven't been to this location in a while and now I remember why.  Great location, too bad the customer is still at the bottom of their list"
John W.,"Newton, MA",44,43,4,5.0,1/28/2013,"Some of the best food and service here. I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for some time and the food and service is always spectacular. We came on a Friday evening at around 5PM. It wasn't as bad till the night progressed. Anyways, the waiter introduced us as we sat down. I swear, the bread and water arrived in under a minute as we sat down looking at the menu.  Ordered the chargrilled steak. The food was promptly delivered. I have to applaud our waiter for always checking up on us. I had a glass of Coke and had it refilled many times without me asking. The waiter took initiative which I really liked.  And of course, after our main course was finished, we had some slices of their infamous cheesecakes. Overall, I would keep coming here!"
Janet D.,"Holbrook, MA",0,7,,1.0,7/16/2013,The wait was 20 minutes longer than they said it would be. The vinyl seat were still wet from when they cleaned them. There were fruit flys flying around. Food was OK. I will never go there again.
Cyndi C.,"Boston, MA",62,38,158,3.0,7/31/2014,"First of all, happy anniversary to CCF! Didn't even know 7/30&7/31 is their anniversary. ..cheesecakes at 1/2 price. My 3 stars, I'm sure would not make or break them...they're popular n always crowded. Please keep in mind that I have always been a fan since this chain opened up its 1st at The Atrium, chestnut hills. Like most chain restaurants (Maggiano's), they tend to change up things n stupidities took over. My reviews: Pro's. .. fave item...my passionfruit ice tea. -The  honey wheat brown loaf..still ok -Spaghetti n Meatball w/Italian Sausage Sauce...a new item. Yum...must try if craving for this all-time comfort food. Tasty sauce meatballs...not as heavy as expected. The fresh basils added a special touch. -Mini bite menu: Zucchini, Avocado,  Mushroom Frites. Crispy not greasy...accompanied w/2 kinds of sauces...only liked 1 of the 2. Cons: -Tex Mex Egg Rolls...more salty than usual! They did away w/their usual green sauce n replaced it w/some watered-down sour cream and a splash of red something sauce on top. Good thing is, they plated it w/limes this time, without having to ask for it... when they once have that green sauce! CCF, do yourself as favor, stop messing up them sauces! If it's not broken..why fix it?! - My once fave pasta dish, Chix Marsala w/mushroom over Bowties...tasteless n bland. Needs some sauce ppl..not just a tablespoon of it drizzled on!!  I'm not giving up my fave, but I'll make sure I'll ask them to serve it up w/sauce...please!!! -Our server, sloppy! Settings were opened up from their usual wrapping w/the napkin...the knife was found at the seat next to me. When asked for another setting, she came back 20min later w/still wet utensils scattered over the table...no napkin this time! I washed it with my tea...didn't feel like waiting for another 20. Came back but then, didn't clear out our table. Btw, they gave us next next-available-seating, at the outdoor patio. *Sigh* wanna go home...stressed out a bit between the waitress, cool July nite, n then a heated lamp next to me...seems like I'm getting my hair done at a salon.. My BFF n I ordered cheesecakes to go. I got mines up at the counter. The few waitstaffs waiting for their cheesecakes were very nice...suggestions on flavors to the indecisive me! The guy, Aldwyn B, who took my cheesecake order was calmed n chilled under all that madness. Even when I was deciding between 2 flavors. Very helpful n patient. Ended up sticking to my fave, Keylime cheesecake n a 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (chocolate) for my guy. We'll see if we like them tomorrow."
Amy C.,"East Bridgewater, MA",11,39,6,5.0,1/30/2015,"Had a great meal. I tried something I normally wouldn't and was pleasantly surprised. My salad, even though it was a salad was ice cold, DELICIOUS. My meal came timely and hot. I would definitely go back again...and of course the cheesecake is a MUST!!!"
