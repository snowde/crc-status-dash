Cardy O.,"Boston, MA",2,11,,1.0,10/19/2014,"i personally didn't like the service at this particular location... my dish had more nuts in it than actual meat in it... also i was sitting right beside a awkward couple and could hear there whole conversation, the tables need to be spaced out more.  I could not wait to get out of there and will be in no hurry back!!!!"
Marie P.,"San Francisco, CA",53,714,32,4.0,10/12/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is big and clean. I'm used to the huge wait in San Francisco so getting seated right away is a charm. I can't complain our server was super nice and attentive. Cheesecake Factory for me isn't the type of restaurant you go to all the time, so I know I go like only a few times in a year so I celebrate coming here!"
Jay M.,"Amherst, MA",0,12,,3.0,5/2/2014,"I come here every year for my sister's birthday (she loves it), and I'm always kind of disappointed in the food. It's kind of meh. The cheesecake is amazing, and I've never really had a bad experience with the service. But I definitely wouldn't choose to go here for dinner, especially not with how much it costs.  But seriously the cheesecake is great. I've had the oreo, banana, and triple chocolate cheesecake and they were all fantastic."
Adrienne M.,"Boston, MA",2,19,,2.0,1/5/2015,"Update: Literally too busy to go to. They have a minimum of a 30 minute wait at all hours of the day. I have to get take out if I want to eat their food and even then I have to wait in line for 20 minutes to pick it up. Good for them, but makes me never want to go."
Jennifer R.,"Randolph, MA",1,4,,5.0,4/27/2015,DELICIOUS ! I had wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory... The staff is just delightful & the food is exquisite! I recommend the Nachos for an appetizer & Chicken Caesar Salad for a meal. SO GOOD & SO FILLING. YUM!
Tom H.,"Quincy, MA",4,18,,5.0,2/19/2015,I have been to this location many times. We all know their food is great and I have never had a problem with their service at this location. Though during peak hours you will probably have to wait a bit.
Delroy H.,"Boston, MA",55,169,19,4.0,1/19/2014,It's ok to stop in for brunch as the food is good. However it's not what I would recommend for your regular brunch  hangout as it is not family oriented. I like the feeling of being home or in someone's kitchen having brunch. I prefer the Station in Newton.
Melissa B.,"Boston, MA",2,150,,1.0,1/17/2015,SALTY. Ick. Had dinner here the other night and everything we ate was overly salty and obviously not freshly prepared.  Had a gift card but would NEVER return.
Aubrey L.,"Boston, MA",4,54,20,4.0,12/2/2014,"I've been here alot of times and always loved getting the stuffed mushrooms. Their pasta's are really good! The only downside about this place I feel like is if you ever chose to sit outside to eat, it always seem like they forget all about you! Sometimes it takes such a long time for them to even appear and take our orders or even bring our drinks. They're busy and it's understanding but I personally don't suggest sitting outside to eat unless you have alot of time on your hands."
Starr G.,"Abington, MA",0,12,,1.0,5/7/2016,"This may have been a great place when it first opened but my recent experience I have to say I was disgusted and disappointed. The place was dingy, and dirty. I had to send back our silverware TWICE due to caked on gunk and food. I had to send my glass back due to a dirty film from it not being washed properly. The table, seats, and floors were sticky; and left over food all over the floors. The menus even felt disgusting. I felt like I needed to shower the second I sat down in the booth. The window next to where we sat had nasty food and finger prints all over it... it was nasty. They obviously didnt take the time to clean in between seating people whatsoever. There were fruit flies everywhere, landing in our drinks and food. It took 20mins for a server or anyone to acknowledge that my napkin dropped in the middle of the floor; I left it there waiting to see if I would be brought another clean one. 20 mins before a MANAGER brought over a new napkin and picked up the old one. All the while servers and employees walked over the napkin right in the middle of the floor. The waitress service was sub-par; and not friendly. However, the food was alright; I don't think it was worth the over priced meals but that was the only good thing I have to say about this place, the food was decent. That was and will be the LAST time I go to that location in Braintree-- Its too busy for them to even clean in between seating people doesn't matter how good the food is; if your eating area is disgusting the food doesn't matter. Very disappointed."
Jeff S.,"EAST WALPOLE, MA",0,3,4,1.0,1/14/2016,"This place truly sucks. I was given a pager said 15 min wait, 35 mins goes by nothing. I go up to the counter and they said I must have got a defective pager. No apology. We ordered Tuna Tartare it was absolutely disgusting, it was old, fishy and NOT FRESH. My father ended up getting food poisoning from Salmon on top of this horrible experience. Honestly stay away, its not worth it, they clearly could care less about food quality and service."
Lucia D.,"Dorchester Center, MA",1,12,6,1.0,2/27/2014,"I order mac n cheese balls a bit ago,  got plastic instead. Broken plastic in my mouth. Yea spare yourself."
Yvonne R.,"Quincy, MA",0,49,7,1.0,12/20/2015,"Went here last night. We were seated,my napkin had shit all over it, the fork had dried food on it, I pointed it out to the waiter and he replaced the fork and napkin not the whole setting. The cheese on my sandwich was burnt to a crisp, I pointed out to the waiter, and he took my fork and started picking at it.....YUCK. It's so freaking dark. DON'T go here"
Tim C.,"West Roxbury, MA",0,4,,1.0,1/4/2015,"Not a pleasant experience.  We were told 30-35 minutes wait for 5 people and after 42 minutes they said we would be seated any minute.  52 minutes later, we were paged to our table.  When we were seated, it was by far the worst table in the restaurant.  A booth made for 4 people beside the kitchen where dirty dishes were kept at our table level.  Our servicer wasn't bad but the wait put a bad taste in our mouth and we were too cramped."
Rahul S.,"Lowell, MA",40,11,8,1.0,11/9/2014,"We went into this place at around11:45pm, they are open till 12:30. The waitress made such a face when she came to help us. It just seemed as if she didn't want us there. Her attitude towards us the whole time got worse by the minute. She would come bang the food on the side of the table and leave. Not leaving it in front of the person who ordered it. Seriously? I love going to Cheesecake Factory, but this location needs some serious help. The food was good but the service make us not want to be there. If you don't want customers coming in late, which I believe I wasn't that late, change your hours!! Step it up cheesecake, train your employees!!"
Viv K.,"Quincy, MA",77,46,,1.0,9/15/2014,"I have been here multiple times because I enjoy the food but it is always crowded, extremely noisy, service inst always that great, because they want to get you in and out, its very rush rush and not cozy.  I went a few weeks ago and it will be my last time. Ordered BUFFALO WON TONS, one of my favorite apps, started chewing on a bone/cartilage in one, made me sick. For my dinner I ordered the Chicken Madeira, its a pan fried chicken, with mashed potatoes and asparagus (its far from a Mexican dish). It was fabulous, never had to complain about it until the next day when I ate through 90% of the dish for lunch, and found 2 black beans as the bottom of the take away container. First question I asked myself was who's fork did these beans come from. RECOMMENDATION: never let anyone take your food back to the kitchen!"
Le N.,"Quincy, MA",2,70,2,3.0,5/21/2013,"ALWAYS a long line - doesn't matter what time of the day it is!! Food is okay - portions are very large. My favorite from here is more so the appetizers than the actual entree itself. I often find myself ordering a bunch of appetizers to substitute as my entree. =) I like to get the thai lettuce wrap (the sauces are yummy!), buffalo wings, and avocado rolls. When I do get an entree, I do find myself often getting the navajo sandwich - basically fried dough as my bread. mm yumm!  So if you're at the mall and need to grab a meal - cheesecake does do the job. Just be prepared to wait.. sometimes longer than the estimated time. -_-"
C R.,"Norfolk, MA",8,194,7,4.0,3/6/2013,The food and service are always top quality - and consistent - at all of their restaurants! CHEESEBURGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG YUM.
Melissa W.,"Boston, MA",6,23,,3.0,7/30/2014,Food is average compared to most other locations. I've been here several times with coworkers for lunch and it has taken 30-45 minutes for our salads to come out each time. Would not recommend coming here for a work lunch unless you have at least 2 hours to spare.
Sun S.,"Sharon, MA",4,20,,2.0,8/18/2015,"I have been to this restaurant hundreds of times, but it's been over a year since I have been there so we went there for dinner last night.  Service was good,  but the menu has changed less options.  The quality of the food has gone WAY DOWN. We order our favorite Texmex Rolls they were so spicy so much more spicy than before.  I asked them why they were different and they said they were the same.  They are not the same they are way more spicy I have eaten these hundreds of times.  The dipping saw was like guacamole not a light creamy sauce with a hint of avocado like before. My son ordered the pasta cabonara his favorite it was so bland and tasted burnt, it was just terrible!  What a waste of money.  My days of going here are over."
