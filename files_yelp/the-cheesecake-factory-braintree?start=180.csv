Kimberly Y.,"Dallas, TX",12,247,154,4.0,7/22/2014,The food and service are both good. The cheesecakes are to die for.  They even offer a sugar free cheesecake for those who want a lower calorie option. I also like that they offer low calorie menu options.  This is probably one of the better franchise chains out there. And they have late hours too.
Winnie K.,"Boston, MA",210,171,56,4.0,9/12/2012,"I still love this place, I know it is such a chain restaurant, but I don't care. I love that there is so much to choose from and now they also added the new Skinnylicious menu to the list.  Woo Hoo!  The portions are huge & the food is always consistent, I still get the WOW factor when they deliver the dishes to the table. I love the Alcoholic & Non-Alcoholic drinks here, perfect mixture of booze & juices to keep you buzzed but not bombed. But my favorite is the desserts; yup the cheesecakes, the cakes & what have you,  I love, LOVE Carrot cake, but I must say I rather order the Carrot Cake Cheesecake than the real thing here, but I still will not pass on that dessert if it was offered to me!"
Alexandra M.,"Winchendon, MA",0,19,7,1.0,11/21/2015,"So we had a really great server here at the cheesecake factory in Braintree. Come the end of the meal I presented my cheesecake factory employee swipe card in hopes of the 25% off, to be told by the manager that discounts are not permitted Friday and Saturdays... I had never been denied my employee discount at any other cheesecake factory ever. Highly disappointed and will not return. I don't spend my days and nights slaving away at the my cheesecake factory to not get my employee discount when I'm taking my friends Out and about to a new mall."
Jennifer N.,"Boston, MA",1,30,3,1.0,1/21/2014,"I've gone here a couple of times and the service is awful.  The first time I sat at the bar. The older bartender was more attentive but once he went on break and was replaced with a younger girl, she never once came over to check on us. She was literally socializing with her coworker and favored customers the entire time. It was very frustrating. We sat at the other side of the bar and she literally stayed on the opposite side the entire time. My brother didn't get a chance to order his food until the older bartender came back. Given the environment, it's too rude to yell ""excuse me"" from across the bar because then I'd have to raise my voice to be heard. The second time was even worse. It was a very busy Saturday during lunch time. The host said it would take 15-20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The waiting area was incredibly packed but we managed to seat ourselves on the waiting bench directly across the dessert cashier (which isn't far from the host, just several feet away). An hour goes by and we're still not seated at a table and it's still really loud and packed in the waiting/dessert area. Mind you, I am starving at this point and was patient enough to wait this long assuming the wait for my table was longer than the host expected because, again, it's still loud and crowded around me. After I managed to push past the crowd to the host, I asked him how much longer the wait would be. He goes ""oh, your name was called a long time ago. Your buzzer didn't go off because it's broken"". If he had in fact called my name, he obviously didn't try very hard because I was sitting nearby. It's way too loud to call someone's name from your post and assume the entire waiting area can hear you when it's insanely busy. I was so irate. The host really couldn't step into the crowd of people to call my name? Knowing that my buzzer was broken. WHY WOULD YOU USE BROKEN BUZZERS?! I was livid but was seated immediately. I still was friendly to my server, saying please and thank you but I can't force a smile when I'm dying of hunger over here. And she cheerily told us to ""not be so difficult next time"". Woman, do you know what your people have put me through? I am never coming back. This place is absolutely dreadful for service. The quality of the food doesn't even matter. The service completely killed it for me."
Madison R.,"Plymouth, MA",72,2,,2.0,11/18/2015,"Let me start with, my father had called an hour and a half ahead to make sure the restaurant can accommodate a party of 11. He was put on hold and forgotten about. We got there and put our name in at 7, then waited 2 hours after we were told it would be 45 minutes. It was about 9pm before we got seated. We saw many tables of 5 and 6 go before we were finally seated. There was a crowd that walked in shortly after we got there and they were all cleared out before our table was available. Fine, so we got seated and ordered drinks and food and apps. We didn't get our meals until almost 10pm. By this time the entire place was empty. We heard happy birthday about 8 times after being seated before we got any kind of food. I have two young children who fell asleep at the table because it was so late and we hadn't gotten food yet so they went to sleep without eating dinner because the wait was so long. Then after all of the food came out except my father's, the waitress came over and apologized because his food had been sent to the wrong table.. How does that happen? The only thing that saved this experience was the food. It was good but not worth a three hour wait."
Geoff L.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,14,5,4.0,9/17/2012,"What's not to love. Huge Servings - Huge Menu - Great Deserts I eat in the bar area so I don't have to wait. The servers were attentive, prompt and the drinks were all good."
Anymonous O.,"Mobile, AL",0,12,,5.0,11/6/2015,Best food. Always amazing service! Little pricey but worth the price due to the portions.
Dan S.,"Quincy, MA",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2014,This place sucks margaritas are small as fuck kiddie size and they cut you off after 4 drinks fuck em!
Sarah S.,"Quincy, MA",0,6,,4.0,4/13/2014,"I love this spot for a date night with my husband. I would probably not recommend this as a family with young kids spot on the weekend because the wait times tend to be long. But as a date spot - this is great. The atmosphere is nice with low lighting and music even though it is usually a full house. The prices are tipping in on the slightly high side - for a typical date with 2 dinners, 2 drinks, 2 desserts (or an app) the cost is probably going to tally up to $70 including tip. The food is worth it though. The louisiana chicken and chicken bellagio are spectacular. Plenty of food for leftovers. We usually get dessert to go to enjoy together the next day while watching a movie (nice cheap-ish date). As for the desserts - wow, amazing. My husband always gets the chocolate tower cake (yum). I've sampled many of the cheesecakes and suggest the smores inspired one.  Put your name in early and walk around the mall for a while to kill time.  I would not recommend the brunch menu - but going for an early lunch on the weekend is a good idea for a quiet, less crowded experience."
J. R.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,171,105,4.0,10/8/2011,"I will make this simple. It has good food, but I had the worst server I have ever gotten in my life, which killed my cheesecake experience. Her name is Courtney by the way. And she calls me ""honey"" even though I'm probably 5 years older than her. Not ok. Doesn't introduce herself, doesn't tell the specials (not that I give a shit about those).  And she forgot to give us napkins, forks, and my salad had cheese even though I told her no cheese because I am lactose intolerant.  Anyways, the ""chocolate bread"" that they give you in the beginning is worth the shitty server. They have excellent salads, excellent appetizers, and excellent cheesecake.  Their food really is excellent. I just wish it was a little lighter in there. You literally eat in the dark. Like those Golf in the Dark places... this is eat in the dark. Whatever., It was yum."
Maura M.,"Quincy, MA",10,14,5,2.0,7/6/2014,Services was just ok. The hostess was very unpleasant. I understand that it gets super busy and sometimes over whelming in their but if you can't be pleasant DONT WORK WITH PEOPLE especially in the hospitality industry. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over to us. A little too long for my liking especially after waiting an hour to eat lunch. The overall look and feel the restaurant is cool! I like the food but services makes or breaks a place for me and this place is just becoming over rated.
Jm M.,"Boston, MA",0,29,,5.0,7/26/2015,A HUUUUUGE shout out to the food runner Jess for saving the day!!!! Thank you! Thank you! She gave my daughter a bunch of her colored pens to play with as well as her paper. We were able to eat while our daughter played. Thanks to Jess!! :)
Consumer B.,"Holbrook, MA",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2015,"Horrible experience on my nephews birthday! Server did t come by after we received our food, waited 25 minutes than had to get server. Hostess was suppose to send manager but sent a server. After 20 more minutes the crew came over to sing happy birthday and the manager still didn't address the issue. Mind you our food wasn't warped, my son was asleep in the booth and still no check, as I type we are still waiting on the check.........super annoyed!"
Dena D.,"Revere, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Probably the worst food I've ever had. The artichoke dip was so bland and tasteless we barely ate any of it. Then I ordered the chicken teriyaki and SPECIFICALLY ASKED if it came with veggies,  the waitress said it did...when my dinner arrived I was very disappointed Only a chicken breast and white rice arrived. I asked waitress where the veggies were and she said..oh sorry it comes with a fried banana. It looked so unappealing I almost sent it back. So for 81 dollars plus tip I advise all to eat somewhere else because this factory is AWFUL."
Eryn D.,"North Easton, MA",19,31,3,2.0,2/27/2014,My family and I just returned for a dinner. And I have to say the Cheesecake Factory has gone so downhill in quality that it's just not worth it anymore. For the price they charge on meals you could go somewhere else for a better version at half the cost.
Ben L.,"North Dartmouth, MA",6,70,,3.0,5/19/2014,"i usually dont eat at big name franchises but this is the only acceptation because cheesecake factory seems to never dissapoint on the food.  the plenty of times i came here, I ordered pasta, burgers, or steak. this time i had fish and chips and it was actually not good. but im not only putting a spotlight on this dish because everything else i ordered was good. I just dont recommend the fish and chips because it was like biting into a fried greasy batter ball and the fish didnt have too much flavor. other than that, it was great. banana cheese cake was incredibly good like always. im not the biggest chocolate lover but everyone i know seemed to love it. I personally cant handle that sweetness, its an overload for me.  they could really work on the service though, they gave me order to a wrong customer at another table, but they did handle it well, they seemed to have taken care of the situation right away, i only waited 5 more minutes."
Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,4.0,3/18/2012,"I don't understand why the Cheesecake Factory is always so busy.  Even on a dreary Tuesday night, there can be a half hour - to an hour wait.  The folks in the corporate offices are nothing short of geniuses.  First and foremost, the waiting area is in front of a dessert case.  So unless you venture outside of the restaurant, you'll be sitting in front of cheesecake displays for a half hour - to an hour.  Even if there is no wait, you'll still be forced to wait several minutes in front of the case.  So when it comes time at the end of the meal ... hell yes you'll want dessert! My favorite part of the Cheesecake Factory is the salads.  The portion sizes of all their entrees are ridiculously large, so if you're going to shovel away some food, make it a salad.  I typically get the barbecue chicken salad with the barbecue ranch dressing on the side and it is quite delicious.  If I decide to forego the onion straws on top, it's relatively healthy, too.  The service is professional, and I've never had a problem with being served an incorrect meal.  It's a little on the expensive side, but when you consider the portion sizes, you certainly get what you pay for! The cheesecake is extremely rich and when it's $6 - $8 per slice, you can easily make your own cheesecake for $8 using ingredients you most likely already have at home!"
soylinduh O.,"Belmont, MA",10,57,45,5.0,1/4/2010,"MMM Chesecakey! First and foremost, happy 2010! I thought it would be appropriate to even out the scales and start this year off with a positive eating experience! After what seems like a full month of over eating and over drinking my boyfriend and I were finally having a calm Sunday.  Since we had to stop by Macy's at the Braintree Mall we decided that we would indulge one more time and go to the Cheesecake Factory.  I have only once actually had the cheesecake because I usually just end up over eating and not having room for dessert. We sat down and ordered some Buffalo Blasts and a white sangria and pomegranate mojito. I could have easily drank a pitcher of the mojito.  The Buffalo Blasts were amazing!  I would highly recommend them.  For the entree I ended up ordering the factory burger and salad...maybe my body would think I was doing it some good by not getting the fries. On our way in, the man noticed a red velvet cheesecake and out waitress highly recommend it and she was right, it was incredibly delicious.  Another plus, for every slice 25 cents goes to feed America.  This one last splurge was a very good idea and now I can't wait to get back on the gym wagon. So...let's review... 1. Order the Pomegranate Mojito 2. As an appetizer get the Buffalo Blasts 3. Help out America and get the incredibly delicious red velvet cheesecake Until the next review!  (I hope you're ready to travel!) look at my blog for pictures"
Lindsay D.,"Lynn, MA",79,181,42,5.0,9/26/2011,Obviously I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times but never to this one  until Saturday! Had the best waitress in the world who I believe was named Siobhan. I was happy to see the new skinny menus had the milk icons for hidden dairy. That helped me out tons! I tried a new app which was the Charred Shishito Peppers and fell in love. I didnt care either was about the sauce they give you but my fiance loved it for the app he had! Again wait staff is everything and you hit a home run with ours. She was hysterical. Good overall experience! Oh but dont eat outside there was some odor in teh mall parking lot in that area. It was gross.
christine c.,"San Francisco, CA",46,377,1,2.0,8/2/2011,"I am a huge fan of this pre-made, probably frozen chain. I found my staples and I've come to love this place (mostly just for their Linda's Chocolate fudge cake and the crusted chicken Romano) but this particular location is a hot mess. I've been here on multiple occasions and it's always ridiculous. The staff just kind of ushers people around while they wait but don't really know what to do with them. And once my food came out really late and really messed up and I asked to have it remade/sent back and the manager came over to question me about it. As if I had done something wrong... (This was probably 2 summers ago, now) but I was humiliated and mortified. Servers are totally hit or miss here, but honestly, I'd skip the drama and go somewhere else or just get take out if you're seriously craving the food."
