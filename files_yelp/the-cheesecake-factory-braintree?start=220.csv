Marilyn C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",121,319,18,4.0,5/11/2011,"I had heard of the Cheesecake Factory many a time since living in Boston, but I am not a huge fan of chains so it took me 4 years to get here.  Went for lunch with some co-workers and had a good time.  I was surprised by how crowded the place was for a weekday lunch, but we were seated right away.  The menu is insane - sooo many choices.  I decided on a salad since I knew I would be getting desert.  The server was friendly and did a good job with some special requests people had.  I was a little perturbed that I ordered dressing on the side of my salad and it came on the salad and on the side - luckily it wasn't too overwhelming and was good. The salad which sounded kinda tropical and had an asian flavor was good.  The portions like the menu are HUGE - I got the dinner portion for lunch because I wanted to make sure I had leftovers and did I ever - 2 doggie bags worth!  I followed the salad with some coffee and cheese cake.  The peanut butter cheese cake was delicious and I saved half of that as well.  That's 3 doggie bags.  That my friends - is a record."
Sybille P.,"Providence, RI",111,101,710,4.0,7/30/2013,Had the polenta fries at this particular location. Sooooooo good.
Meredith G.,"Braintree, MA",23,7,12,2.0,12/21/2014,"My daughter and I decided to go here for lunch while doing a little Christmas shopping. I was not impressed  to say the least. We ordered the fried mac and cheese balls as an app. We asked for the marinera on the side and did not receive what we ordered. Instead our waitress brought us the fried mac and cheese balls dripping in marinera sauce. She stated that she knew it was wrong but brought it anyway because she didnt want us to wait. Bless her heart. We then ordered our meals. My daughter pizza and salad which was good (but then how hard is it to screw up pizza and salad). I ordered the famous factory meatloaf. Believe me when I say anyone thinking of ordering this can skip it. My meal was cold and tasted funny. In all, the best part of my meal was the wine that came out of a bottle. For what you pay, neither the food or the experience was anything to write home about. Will not be coming back anytime soon."
Roberta N.,"New York, NY",0,99,17,2.0,11/26/2015,"We should have paid attention to the reviews and gone somewhere else. This Cheesecake Factory was a major disappointment.  There was a reasonable 15 minute wait for a table.  After a 3+ hour trip we were tired and hungry.  The waiter was inept - we could barely hear him and when he told us the specials, they made no sense.  As he explained ""capers, olives, lemon and olive oil"" as a special, I was puzzled.  Who has capers as a special?  He left out the salmon.  After the second or third time of repeating, we just ordered from menu.  Then It took over 30 minutes for one appetizer which arrived with our meal.   Of course he forgot that I asked for balsamic vinegar and had already disappeared.  Another wait for him to reappear and then return.  He sent the manager over.  He told her were upset about the dressing.  She did nothing except say she was sorry.  He even kept us waiting for the check and took so long to come back that we asked another waitress to take it.  The food was good but I wouldn't go back."
Kris L.,"Quincy, MA",0,14,,1.0,2/28/2015,Waited on hold for over 30 minutes trying to place a take out order.  Went to the restaurant (as I was headed to the mall anyways) and complained to the manager who actually LAUGHED when I told her.  She offered for me to put in the order then and wait - was NOT going to happen.  The message that came through loud and clear was that the restaurant is busy enough that my business didn't matter.
Dave C.,"Gorham, ME",44,5,,4.0,12/29/2013,"Four stars for the food!  However, they need to look at how they work their waiting area.  Too crowded, way too much confusion over who goes where and the occasional party who gets seated before someone who has been there longer."
Kathryn H.,"Boston, MA",0,11,2,5.0,2/16/2015,Omg our favorite bartender Moss is consistently fantastic! We have such a blast with him and his recommendations (always end up with too much cheesecake lol)! Food is equally as tasty as our drinks! Thanks for being so fun everytime we visit!
Kyla V.,"Braintree, MA",0,3,,5.0,1/20/2015,The portion of their food is unbelievable. The hostesses greet you right when you get in and if they aren't busy they seat you right away and the food comes out as you order. They have a huge bar with a variety of high end drinks.
Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111,5.0,1/2/2013,"I know a lot of people who are ""over"" the initial hype of The Cheesecake Factory from years ago when they started popping up.  The chain was all the rage because of its large comfortable atmosphere & seating, huge menu and options upon options of drinks & of course, cheesecake!  You can order out too & even request a whole cheesecake be made for take-home to that special occasion.  The ""large"" theme doesn't stop with my prior comments, The Cheesecake Factory has a huge waitstaff & appropriately schedules employees for their most busiest times.  I love their strawberry lemonade, mac & cheese, Renee's Special, chicken marsala, salads & desserts.  My fondness for The Cheesecake Factory doesn't end there...my husband conducted a surprise proposal for me with the help of our waitress at this location, how could I ever be anything BUT ""over"" it?!"
Drew H.,"Boston, MA",0,37,9,3.0,1/11/2014,"For a chain restaurant, it's one of the better ones. The service, food, beverage, and desert are above average. The draw back is the long wait when there are empty tables. Waiting to eat is not worth my time.  Con: And they need to get rid of the flies hovering over the tables."
Jonathan N.,"Dedham, MA",134,9,,4.0,7/20/2012,"I've been there several times extremely long wait, but as always the Cheesecake Factory food is awesome. Avocado egg rolls and factory chopped salad are a few of my favorites. Try to avoid peak times. Maybe try lunch."
Leah D.,"Whitman, MA",0,9,1,3.0,1/2/2013,"FIrst impression wasn't so great. It's a very loud, cramped type of atmosphere which I am not a huge fan of generally. The prices were a bit high for my taste also. The food made it worth it though. I got a chicken dish I don't know how to spell or pronounce and my fiancé got filet mignon. Both were delicious and of course the cheesecake was amazing. So all in all it was a good experience, just not affordable enough to make it a regular thing."
Kestrel D.,"Arlington, MA",113,50,1,4.0,4/16/2011,"I'm in my mid-20s, have lived in the Boston area since college, and had never been to any Cheesecake location. Of course, I had heard about it - the people who detest it take offense to the same things that its fans love - for example, the million-page menu. I'm not a huge lover of chain-type restaurants, but I remained open-minded. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday, and were informed of the 50 minute wait. Undeterred, we grabbed drinks at the bar and settled in for the duration. Step 1 of the night, Grey Goose dirty martini, received an A-rating, despite the fact that I was hoping for more than 2 olives and a little more dirtiness. Initial observations were that the decor of Cheesecake is certainly strange (reminds me of Aladdin or something, or maybe the inside of a cheesecake?), and that I love those little hand held buzzers that summon you to your table, because then you can be pretty certain they will not lose you and you won't miss your name being called. Allows you to enjoy your drink stress-free. All restaurants should have them. And then, said buzzer buzzed after no more than 20 minutes - who doesn't love an under-promise/over-deliver wait time prediction?! The person who seated us was over-enthusiastic and hilarious (in a good way), and our server, whose name was Joe, was attentive and friendly. The food was good - not amazing or to die for or anything, but certainly yummy. Fresh ingredients, enormous portions, flavorful. How do they do that with so many dishes on the menu? And so many people to serve? Mystery.  Because the name of this place is the Cheesecake Factory, we got some cheesecake - some caramel peanut butter chocolate creation. While I felt the strong desire to purge afterward, it was worth it. Cheesecake, you did good. I'll be back."
Brian L.,"Hoboken, NJ",65,713,8,3.0,12/1/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory.  They're all the same.   Waiter was nice, friendly, and constant.  Ordered the pork chops.  Was not a fan (too sweet).  The applesauce wasn't very good either.  First meal I did not like at CF.  Should've just gotten my Chicken Bellagio again.  Oh well.  Lesson learned."
Lauren M.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",73,55,26,4.0,7/2/2012,"I feel like I have been deprived for some time because I have just recently been coming here.  I've only been here twice but both times I loved the food.  I got the chicken Mediera both times!  The atmosphere is nice, it's reasonable pricing, nothing crazy.  I would def recommend.  My only complaint is that the wait staff have never been excellent, but the food makes up for it."
Sarah N.,"Naples, FL",0,28,,3.0,12/1/2013,The atmosphere here is like a loud stylish cafeteria. I forget exact dish I ordered but the appetizer was fried Mac and cheese. I took one bite and wanted to throw up. I got a bowtie pasta Alfredo type dish with chicken and peas and it was supposed to have other stuff in it but I didn't see anything. It barely had chicken in it. I could only take a few bites and decided to get desert. I am not a fan of cheese cake so I got tiramisu which was ok. I will never go back here the food was not that good.
Victoria J.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",60,207,68,3.0,10/4/2010,"No matter what you do, you WILL leave this place in a food coma. I have never seen a place where even the salads make me feel guilty just by looking at them.  The portions are not huge, they're offensive.  How is it even possible for one person to eat something that MUST be for the high school football team.  I mean seriously.  You take left-overs home and it's like Thanksgiving - you're eating the same thing for a week. This place is really good when you find yourself with a large group of people to feed.  The menu is HUGE, and it has a little of everything - sure fire why to please everyone in your group of 15 people.  The inside...OK.  I feel like I'm somewhere in Jersey.  No offense, but this is the tackiness that pop culture media has beaten into me about Jersey culture. The food, though, is solid.  Every once in a while whoever is making the food goes a little spice happy, and whatever dish you have is just TOO MUCH flavor wise.  The Buffalo Blasts are awesome!  Yummy Buffalo Chicken wrapped in a wonton and fried - it's like a Buffalo Chicken Crab Rangoon, minus the crab.  I also like the Crispy Beef, and the Lettuce Wrap appetizier.   You can't really complain about places like this.  They market themselves to a certain demographic and they make a killing - there's nothing wrong with that.  On top of it, with decent food & service, what other places will happily accomodate your group of 10+ people AND allow each of them to have Americanized versions of Asian, Mexican, Italian, & Comfort food under one roof?  Seriously."
Kim P.,"South Boston, Boston, MA",4,27,1,2.0,7/6/2012,"Did not have a good experience tonight. The potstickers were ok but then when my pasta dish came out,I could tell it was sitting for awhile. There was barely any sauce and the shrimp were so overcooked that they were like rubber. When our server finally came to see how everything was I told her how bad the shrimp were and she offered to replace them.  I was not about to wait for them to attempt to make a new batch. She brought the manager over who was nice and said she would adjust the bill and when we got it, she took $4.45 off of a $17 pasta dish. So I just paid $12 for pasta in a little tomato sauce that wasn't even good. Next time I will go elsewhere."
Anne C.,"Hyde Park, MA",0,41,29,2.0,5/28/2013,"The food here is very good but everytime i eat here which has been tha past 4 times i always get sick with the chicken. and i havent returned since, thats too bad :( because i really liked the food and cheesecake"
Jan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,140,24,3.0,12/8/2010,"This place was packed! My second time eating at a Cheesecake Factory, the other being in Pittsburgh. I wasn't blown away by the food, it's good, but nothing new for the taste buds, and it's typical of chain establishments, you try one, you pretty much know what to expect....  I had the Cajun jambalaya Pasta, while others with me got the grilled rib eye, and a chicken parmesan. No one had complaints about their food, everything tasted good, the rib eye was cooked to a nice medium rare as requested. The portions seem to catch some people by surprise, but I love food, so no complaints from me there!   Service was friendly, the cashier area seemed a bit disorganized, with quite a few customers standing around waiting to pay their bills, us included."
