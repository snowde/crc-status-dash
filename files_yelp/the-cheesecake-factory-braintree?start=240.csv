Kathy D.,"Randolph, MA",157,758,180,3.0,3/10/2012,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on Thursday night with 8 people.  I called to make reservations.  NO reservations  I went in at 6:20 and put my my name in.  Everyone else was coming at 7:00.  they told me the table would be ready in 50 minutes.  the table took about an hour and 15 minutes.  The place is always packed.  The Hostess and Manager was extremely nice.  We sat down and our waiter, too was very nice.  We ordered our food and it everyone was very happy with what they ordered.  I had lettuce wraps.  I remember them being a little bit more tasty then they were this night. They weren't horrible. They just seem to be more tasty in the past.  I also ordered firecracker shrimp which was delicious!  It was a very good experience all around.  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake so I can't rate the cheesecake.  I'm not too sure why this place gets so crazy busy...I find it to be just an okay restaurant."
Sean G.,"Quincy, MA",13,9,,3.0,3/8/2013,I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Its always over crowded the food is so/so The menu is too big. I do like their Brunch and their cheesecake is fantastic
Aaron M.,"Lincoln, RI",22,45,,5.0,2/19/2010,"If anyone who has ever been to The Cheesecake Factory knows exactly what your getting yourselves into. Delicious food at ok prices. So I won't bore you with descriptions of foods and such, I'll merely tell you what you can expect at this location. The fact that it is attached the the Braintree mall is a definite plus as the wait times can get to high volumes on holidays and weekends, so it allows you to peruse the stores for abit before your buzzer goes off to be seated. The floor plan is more of an open room, slightly different from the Providence and Boston chains with the elaborate rooms and levels for booths and tables. The service was great, the food came out fast and fresh and as per usual I left with my doggy bag complete with ""Adams Peanut-butter fudge ripple cheese cake""  and the overwhelmingly stuffed belly. Some recommends if you've never eaten here before, or if its a rarity to go. Louisiana chicken pasta-Parmesian encrusted chicken over bow tie noodles with  a mushroom and pepper sauce that is amazing. double bacon cheeseburger-Massively delicious"
Shannon S.,"Quincy, MA",95,295,8,3.0,7/14/2010,"You know why I like The Cheesecake Factory? Because at times when I'm especially indecisive, I KNOW I will be able to find something on the menu here. I mean, after all, the menu is spiral bound for goodness sakes. Do I think that the food is of top notch quality? No. Is it terrible? Definitely not. But given the variety of dishes they offer, they do it all pretty well. I've always had pretty decent service... I mean, after waiting our quoted ""55-70"" mins for a table (there were 7 of us), I'd expect nothing less. But our server just didn't seem that into going out of his way. He just didn't make himself that available. He also skipped me when taking drink orders, then checked in with the table behind us, then returned to take mine. It was like he knew... not cool. As for the food, it was a-ok. I had the chicken di pana... I can't get enough of the potatoes at CCF. Everyone seemed generally pleased with their entrees and drinks. Though I didn't order cheesecake, which is practically criminal... I know, I always enjoy letting my mouth water over the menu. Keep up the good work CCF!"
Alexis A.,"Brockton, MA",72,79,4,1.0,8/17/2009,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, just not this location. The last few times I went including this past Thursday, it has become dirty. The tables always have grime to them and it's starting to look dingy in there. They must get a better cleaning crew.  As for the wait, it's just plain ridiculous here. I went on a Thursday evening not a Saturday night and waited for almost and hour???? That confuses me as it was only mildly busy for this restaurant. I've been to many different locations and ones out of state (Fort Lauderdale, North Carolina, Rhode Island) and have never waited this long, EVER!  Then we get the most crazy, rude, grungy looking waitress. Her name is Kerry BTW and looks to be in her late 40's. She grilled my licence and said that her uncle died in his home 2 years ago on the road I live on. I do remember this home being dilapidated for a long time, but that was TMI for the attitude she was swinging. Then she ""needed"" to add her personal favorites on to all courses we ordered, just to let you know, we never asked.  When I went to pay the bill with my debit card, she asked for my license, as if she hadn't studied it hard enough before. Was she trying to memorize it, I don't have my social on there. WEIRDO. Then when she wrapped our meals she threw it it our faces. I don't think I'll return to this location without requesting NOT to get this waitress. I AM DISGUSTED!"
Amy S.,"Ashland, OH",0,11,,4.0,4/8/2011,"We love Cheesecake Factory. There's nothing on the menu that we don't like. I am partial to the pasta dishes and the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.  We like to go for lunch and get the lunch portions for a more reasonable price.  The avocado egg-rolls are also fantastic!  I was disappointed in the Mojitos at this location. The CF has always had fantastic mojitos, maybe its just this location or the bartender that day... either way they weren't up to par from what we've grown to expect ."
Nancy R.,"Boise, ID",59,136,52,3.0,10/1/2011,"I love the cheescake factory for their huge variety of foods.  It is usually a good place to eat.  However, the last time we were there, I ordered the Navajo sandwich, and it was so bland I didn't even like it.  My daughter ordered the herb crusted salmon and it was raw in the middle and it grossed her out.  I do love the Vietnamese tacos, but they aren't consistently good.  It would be nice to see this location step up their game."
Eric T.,"Marion, MA",57,247,22,4.0,1/30/2010,"I was lucky enough to get a Cheesecake Factory gift card for Christmas so I got around to cashing it in. I know it's a chain, and attached to a mall, but if it weren't for the shoppers with their Macy's bags you wouldn't even notice. It had a very nice one off kind of feel about it. As soon as we walked in we saw the place was PACKED, so the 45 minute wait didn't bother us much. They don't have a ton of space for customers waiting for tables, but we were able to sneak a spot by the bench at the main door. That was a prime people watching spot. You wouldn't know there is a recession going on if you sit here for a half hour on a Saturday night. There is nothing but well dressed shoppers, families, and couples milling around. Dropping $7 for a slice of cheesecake at the counter doesn't even phase anyone.  Now onto our seats. We were seated in the middle of a long section. One side was a bench than ran the length of the floor, the other side were comfortable chairs. I guess this makes it easy for them to host large groups if needed but if you're seated next to another table beware, you'll learn everything you'll want to learn about them and then some. There is just no privacy. On one side of us we had a table of four that looked and talked like Jersey Shore cast offs. One guy returned from a smoke break, and brought the stink back in with him. On the other side, two girls in their early 20's who sounded like they were on The Hills (only add 50 pounds). I had to sit here and listen to some girl go on and on and on.... and on about who's ""hooking up"" with who, and so on. I just wanted a quiet dinner with my girlfriend. I didn't need to hear all this crap. So if you go ask for a booth.  That will be the end of the negative part of this review. Everything else was great. Our waitress was friendly, quick, and attentive with out being annoying. We skipped on the apps and enjoyed the bread they bring over when you sit down. The meals took very little time to come out. We both ordered chicken pasta dishes. I got the Chicken Belagio that was on the special card. The chicken and prosciutto were a great combination over some pasta with a basil sauce. For a chain or anyplace it was a good dish. I hope it's no the menu next time I go.  For dessert we split a Dulce De Louche cheesecake. I wish I got my own, but it was rich enough and filling enough to split. The coffee that washed it down was brewed to perfection. It's nice to get a fresh cup of coffee so late at night.  I'd be happy to come back to the Cheesecake Factory again. Next time I'll be sure to ask for a booth. Go here expecting a wait, and remember it's a chain attached to a mall, so you won't get a quiet dinner setting, and you'll have a great time."
Angela C.,"Braintree, MA",0,9,,4.0,2/19/2013,"I actually really like this place. As a vegetarian there isn't a ton of stuff I can eat, but the things I can eat are always good. I seriously adore their veggie burger. It's a homemade beet based burger that is different than the typical Boca burgers most other places have.  It can be really busy and loud. Actually it's almost always busy and loud so I usually just do take-out. The waitstaff has always been friendly, and once when a mistake was made (appetizer was forgotten) the manager came to see us and offered us free cheesecake (yay!)."
Vincent N.,"Norwell, MA",0,10,,2.0,7/16/2014,I went there last night. It is kind of crowded on Tuesday. Food is just average. Wonder why it is so popular need to wait in line on week night. Maybe because the y don't really try to rush you out right away after you are done with your food. Good for chatting with friends.
Stacy Hao T.,"Randolph, MA",76,33,16,3.0,4/30/2012,"I enjoy coming here sometimes because my favorite dish here is the spicy chipotle chicken pasta, but the service is always horrible. The waitress is especially not attentive, its not the first time I've been here, so DAMN improve yourself. I also like their happy hour too, some drinks are pretty good, but some of them are just gross and needs to be sent back because it wasn't well mix together. Everytime I come here, I expect poor service, because not once have I had a wonderful waiter or waitress, it s ridiculous."
David A.,"Brooklyn, NY",379,684,63,2.0,4/17/2009,"This place isn't great compared to the Cambridge one. We waited in line for 45 minutes on a Thursday night for a table. Once we got seated, it took a while for our waiter to come over. He forgot to bring basics....say, plates for the bread......water......then instead of refilling a water, he took it away. Yeah, great service, NOT. Had the Ahi Tuna steak that was wasabe encrusted. The fish cut itself was good, but I didn't like the way it was prepared. It wasn't spicy at all and was quite watery. Sitting on a bed of rice didn't do the trick. The rice wasn't good at all and it was sitting in a bed of BUTTER. Who prepares Ahi Tuna Steak with so much butter? The handmade guacamole and chips was amazing as usual. Very addictive. Get the spicy. It's about 2 on the spicy scale. NOT SPICY ENOUGH. It's sad to see leftover chips when there are no guacamole left. The salsa isn't all that. The malibu pina colada was OK. Not the best drink I've had. Heck, didn't taste any different from a regular pina colada, except it was not the best. This is centrally located right outside the Southshore Galleria Mall with lots of free parking right by the highway."
Patti W.,"Braintree, MA",33,38,4,5.0,12/13/2012,"One word...Yum!!!! My daughter and I had the Steak Diane with Mashed Potatoes. Can you say incredible, delicious or mouth watering? Well that describes our meal. We both ate and ate till we were full and asked for our doggy bags of course but we had to have cheesecake. MMMMM Key Lime Cheesecake so soft, smooth and tangy can life get any better?.....Naw I don't think so."
John A.,"Medford, MA",45,248,21,3.0,2/7/2010,"The menu at the Cheesecake Factory is an extensive list of many different food offerings and somehow they manage to make every dish respectable.  I've eaten here a few times and while I can say the food has been good, I don't think they have one signature dish that really stands out from the rest (the cheesecake doesn't count).  If you're feeling the ""I'm and American"" attitude then this place is perfect because the servings are absolutely and utterly massive.  You'll have enough food for dinner and lunch for the rest of the week. The problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that the waitstaff is unable to keep up with the popularity of the place.  This isn't because they're less efficient than other restaurant staff but because the sheer volume of people that frequent this place on any evening is enough to overwhelm even the most seasoned waiter.  For this reason the service is unfortunately sub-par."
Hector K.,"Boston, MA",19,7,,2.0,7/20/2012,"I recently went to the Cheesecake factory with a couple of my sisters. It took a while for us to be seated, but that's because we got there right in the middle of the dinner rush. Waiting wasn't too bad because you get to look at all the nice cheesecakes in the case. Eventually, we got a booth, which was huge, even though there were only three of us. It looked like it was made for eight people. We had their buffalo chicken appetizer, which was good, but you can't really screw up buffalo chicken at a restaurant. For my entrée, I ordered the shepherd's pie. It was pretty good, but it was nowhere near great. The ground beef didn't taste that good, and the mushroom sauce wasn't really that good either. The mashed potatoes on top were good, as were the vegetable mixed on the bottom mixed in with the beef. Overall, it was an okay dish, but I do expect better from them. I've been to a different Cheesecake Factory location before, and the food was great, but that's probably because I ordered a different dish. I got the Chicken Chipotle Pasta before, which was wonderful, and the portion is huge. Anyway, after that, I got dessert. I had mango key lime cheesecake, which was great, although they put way too much whipped cream on my plate. I don't understand why I need whipped cream on the cheesecake and three more piles of it on the plate. I didn't end up paying much, even though I ate a lot. So, you get a lot of food without spending too much money, which is always good in my opinion. Of course, I have to mention the wait staff. Our waiter was extremely nice, but he was a little frazzled. He seemed kind of all over the place. So, it took longer than usual for us to get things like extra bread or another glass of water, but I guess that comes with going to a restaurant at their busiest hour. Either way, he was nice, but I think he talked too much. Overall, I think I had a good experience there. I'd recommend going earlier in the day, though, when it's a little quieter and there are no children running the next table."
Jason T.,"Brockton, MA",32,48,1,3.0,7/8/2011,Not its all cracked to to be.  the cheese cake is good.  They should stick to that.  Stop making dinner.
Mayo B.,"Billerica, MA",1,69,,2.0,6/15/2009,"This is probably one of the worst cheesecake factories I have been to.  Yes, it can be expensive, but the food is for the most part very consistent and tasty, but this location has issues.  The service was terrible. When one the guests in my party was finished eating an appetizer we shared, the server removed the knife from her plate and placed it in on the table....I mean, not only is that a little unhygienic, but I a little wierd? She could have taken the knife and gave her a new one or simply placed it on her bread plate...maybe that is just me. Another thing that bothered me with the service was the waitress didn't wait until everyone was done eating to clear the plates and she actually gave people in my party their leftovers while people were still eating...again a little weird. Now to the food...I don't what it is about this location, but the food is sub-par. I have been to other locations and I felt that the meal I had at the Braintree location was not consistent with other locations I have been to. I also feel that this location is alot smaller than other locations and maybe that's why is not up to cheesecake factory standards.  If you want a better experience, go to the one in Natick...just my two cents."
Justin M.,"Brockton, MA",98,90,5,3.0,3/23/2013,"This place is just okay.  I do not ever crave the Cheesecake Factory and I am ok going a long time without it.  I had a gift card so I met my girlfriend there for dinner on a Tuesday night.  Its always so busy and that's really irritating, on a Tuesday night I do not want to wait 20-30 mins just to sit.  The prices are out of this world but you should know that going into it.  It is not a good place for people on a strict budget.  The beer was good and cold which was a plus and average priced and the wine was a nice size nice price.  The spring rolls were surprisingly delicious along with the dipping sauce.  A little sweet but really good.  I got the chicken tacos which were ok at best a tad cold in the center but I ate them and went on with our day.  The bill total after getting 2 slices of $7.50 cheesecake was $93 on a Tuesday night.  From here on out if I actually go to another Cheesecake Factory in the next couple of years I need to make sure its on a pay day and I get there early, most definitely not my first choice but it will do if the group wants to go."
M O.,"Randolph, MA",2,21,,2.0,7/24/2012,"Over the last few years, I found that the quality of their entrees have declined. I went there several years ago and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. My last visit proved to be a relatively expensive disappointment.  Our first negative experience was the wait. Understandabley, a popular chain restaurant like this would have a long wait which we were okay with. However, when parties of 2 that put their names in after us got seated before us, we started to get fed up since we had been waiting for over an hour when the expected wait time was half an hour to 45 minutes.  When we finally sat down and got our food, we were further disappointed. My boyfriend and I didn't order anything that would take too long to make since at that point, we were pretty hungry after the wait. He got an omelette and I got an order of fish tacos. After another half hour, our food finally came but it seemed like the food had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes before it arrived at our table. The fish tacos were soggy and had absorbed all the juices from the tomatoes and the omelette was cold. If our food had been brought to us when it was ready instead of sitting on the counter by the kitchen, it would have tasted much different.  Sadly, I probably will not go back to this particular Cheesecake Factory."
Daphne X.,"Emeryville, CA",90,27,10,2.0,11/19/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory made us waited for 30 minutes before we got seated on a Wednesday night. We began our dinning experience with a tropical martini and a pineapple mojito. They were both very mummy.  Unfortunately, I can't make the same compliment for our plates. We ended up ordering a Chinese Chicken salad and a Steak Diane.Our meals arrived pretty hasty but for some reason my steak was cold. It also tasted very blend; Similar to boiling a piece of meat without any marinate or spices. I requested to have the salad dressing on the side, it showed up separately  about 15minutes later. It was irritating waiting that long for something that completes your meal. I've had really satisfying Cheesecake Factory food at the Cambridge side location. I recommend that branch over this one."
