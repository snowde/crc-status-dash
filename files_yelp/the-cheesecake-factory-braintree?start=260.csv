Alyssa S.,"South Weymouth, MA",41,238,,2.0,9/15/2009,"I am mainly writing this review for my ""Nacho Average Reviews"" list; but just to throw it out there, The Cheesecake Factory offers a lot of options on their menu with standard prices that bring you huge food proportions.  However, I do not believe that the ridiculous waiting time on some evenings (umm 1-2 hours or more?!) is worth it.   That being said, my friend and I did happen to make a stop here after some shopping at the plaza.  We enjoyed our Blood Mary's a lot, and the price of them wasn't too bad ($6/7 each).  We only ordered nachos, and we were presented with a large plate of tortilla chips covered with cheese and jalapenos.  There were also three mini piles of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.  Not bad, but not great either.  I think the chips needed more cheese, and I always need more salsa, sour cream, and guac haha.  For an overall Cheesecake Factory rating, 2.5 stars For my ""Nacho Average Reviews"" list: 1.5 stars."
Maura D.,"Peabody, MA",0,41,,1.0,2/1/2009,"So maybe I am a glutton for punishment but off i go today back to the cheesecake factory (with four kids!) before we go to the movies (mall cop.....you owe me 90 minutes of my life back!) and again the service was horrible. The kiddos split some pizza and i get the simple pecan and blue cheese salad. Which comes......with no blue cheese!. So basically I paid two dollars extra for three pecans on a garden salad. Brought it up to the server....NOTHING HAPPENS! Seriously no response. The only good thing about this place is the strawberry shortcake....the best on the planet. We killed two of them between us all.  Go to this location at your own risk because you will never get what you ordered....or better yet, just stick to dessert!"
Louis C.,"Weymouth, MA",180,187,349,1.0,9/1/2010,"This was going to be a 3 star review but I just can't support the Cheesecake Factory anymore, after my experiences last week.  My girlfriend Kelly and I went here last week for cheesecake to go after a night out. Well, I have a nut allergy and I know that I can only order certain cheesecake flavors. I got the Dulce de Leche, which normally doesn't contain nuts, or mention any type of nut topping in the description. We got home and take out our cheesecakes and there's nuts on top of mine. Now, you can tell that these nuts are sprinkled on and not part of the product so I call up the CCF and ask to speak to a manager. I talk to ""Kelly"" who is the person who also picked up the phone and inform her of my allergy and that there was nuts placed on my cheesecake. I was told that it wasn't ""nuts"", but a toffee topping that they put on the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. I say to her that it's clearly nuts and that another person is looking at it too and saying that they are nuts. She tells me that all their food is prepared offsite and that it's possible that they are prepared near / around nuts. I asked her what she suggested that I do and she said that ""If I really had a nut allergy, she suggests that I don't eat the cheesecake."" THAT'S IT!? No offer to exchange my cheesecake or to refund my money that I spent. NOTHING!! If it wasn't already 11:45pm on a Tuesday I would have drove all the way back and demanded my money back. Instead, when any one asks me what I think about the Cheesecake Factory, I will let everyone that I know about my encounter I had with ""Kelly"" and the Cheesecake Factory in Braintree, MA. Last week's incident was not acceptable, and could have sent someone to hospital."
Ethan A.,"Boston, MA",19,287,,2.0,9/1/2008,"I don't get why people like this place so much.  It is ALWAYS packed.   The food is mediocre, and comes in huge portions.  I don't care for the service - they try way too hard.  They try to come off as really high end, but take a look around at everyone eating there and its obvious it isn't.  Drinks are very pricey.   The cheesecake is of course amazing - but I have had servers laugh at my friends for getting after eating a meal, since the calorie count was so high.   Interestingly enough, if you take the late night bus leaving the mall, you will find a good amount of the cooks taking the bus with you.  They are a mix of immigrants (not making jokes, I have had conversations with them) and admit that they have minimal training and that the recipes call for enormous amounts of butter and olive oil added to cooking, way more than you would ever use normally.  But hey, let the buyer beware that a grilled fish has as many calories as deep fried chicken.   The servers sometimes ride that bus as well - and one has admitted to me that they laugh at the larger customers who eat the huge portioned meals and desserts.  Makes you think twice before going there again."
Mikey S.,"Boston, MA",19,135,,3.0,7/31/2009,"I like this place. Yes, every time i go there i have to wait and yes every time i went there the waitress was a little bit retarded but for some reason i still like going here. Maybe its the huge menu or maybe its the fact that i feel a little bit richer when i come here with all the fancy decor but the food has always been good and the prices arent bad either. oh yeah i think it has cheesecake too."
Dan R.,"Brockton, MA",6,72,14,3.0,5/24/2013,sat at the bar today with my wife of 12 years ( just the start of our anniversary ) the blueberry mojito and mai tai was delicious...   we split an order of fried calamari and that was not so good...the larger rings were very chewy and not much flavor...the dipping sauces were able to enhance the flavor only so much....the manager came over to us minutes before the dish arrived explaining that he was sorry the app was taking so long due to the oil being changed out of the fryers...we didn't even notice the time but maybe that's why our calamari was so flavorless...I've had fried calamari at several other places and this is the worst of the bunch...
Nana C.,"East Weymouth, MA",0,44,9,3.0,9/13/2013,"Everything was good, not spectacular.  To start, the wheat bread is delicious.  I had what they refer to as ""the incredible grilled eggplant sandwich"".  It was huge! Thick slices of grilled Japanese eggplant,mozzarella, red peppers and a large thick slice of white onion were layered on a sesame seed roll. The menu said red onion.  I know they weren't out of red onion since there was a slice on the burger.  The eggplant sandwich was tasty, but rather difficult to eat since the juices kept dripping out of the other side. I don't think I'd actually consider it ""incredible"".   Lettuce and a slice of tomato were on the side, the tomato didn't look appetizing so I did not add it to my sandwich.  The skinny-licious burger was tiny; we could've just ordered the regular burger,cut it in half and saved the other half, and half of the calories for  tomorrow's lunch.  The skinny-licious salads  were okay, nothing special.  A few pieces of lettuce were wilted.  Service was good.  We ordered our cheesecake to go, since we were full. That was a mistake! The slices seemed smaller than the ones they serve in the restaurant and they were pre- sliced and boxed already in the refrigerator. They added whipped cream  but the cheesecake didn't  seem fresh.  The edges were a bit dried out.  If you call yourself the ""Cheesecake Factory"", your cheesecake should be outstanding. It wasn't this time."
Tony P.,"Spokane, WA",6,104,,3.0,3/23/2011,"Another place I had higher expectations for; of course, the desserts are wonderful (and worth the price--take 'em home) but the rest of the food is not particularly special.  Have eaten at this location four or five times and have now started ordering the cheap sandwiches just to eat the dessert.  The larger dinners seem kinda like Applebees + to me--just not worth the price.  And since I am driving home, drinking is not an option."
Irene R.,"Memphis, TN",214,559,90,4.0,5/7/2010,"Great food and even low care cheesecake for those of us who are diabetic and still want desert.  Ask for AJ, best waiter there."
Smiley B.,"Quincy, MA",0,15,,1.0,10/28/2010,SLOPPY SLOPPY SLOOPY. The cooks there are horrible well compared to the cheesecake factories in Newton and Copley.  Also the waiter misinformed us on the prices. The knives weren't clean and the calamari was just over cooked...Also how can anyone mess up a burger...it is the easiest thing to make. Will not go there again for appetizers or entrées but I still would go there for the dessert.
Lou Ellen M.,"Glen Mills, PA",0,4,,1.0,10/3/2013,"This place was disgusting.  Floors dirty-food under all the tables in our section, menu had food stuck to it and what I believe was some kind of sauce sticking pages together, friend's chair had what looked like died mud on her chair which got all over her pants, mgr was called over and he offered to dry clean pants, then as if all that wasn't enough, got our appetizers  after about 15 min,  and there was a bug on our lettuce wraps and lettuce had not been cleaned well if at all. We left and there was a big hairball on the floor as we walked out."
Rosanna H.,"Quincy, MA",0,13,,5.0,3/11/2010,"Have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory and always will be. They have such an extensive menu and I have tried probably at least 50% of the menu and have not found something I did not like.  Since it does not accept reservations, long wait times are expected but it is worth it.  Suggestions: 1. Pasta DiVinci 2. Thai Lettuce Wraps 3. Louisiana Chicken Pasta 4. Blackened Chicken Sandwich 5. Avocado Egg Rolls  6. Brownie Sundae Cheesecake 7. Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake"
Q S.,"Somerville, MA",189,282,3,2.0,11/9/2008,Cheesecake Factory is always sooo crowded.  I've learned my lesson and I came on Saturday around 2:30pm - thinking I was going to beat the lunch rush - but I was wrong.  We still waited for 30 minutes.   The portions here are huge!  Even for the lunch menu.  But the quality cannot really compare to the quantity.  Everything tastes pretty average.  If you are vegetarian - there aren't that may options. The cheesecakes on the other hand are awesome!  I had the banana cream cheesecake.  It came with banana slices and too much whipped cream.  But the cheesecake itself was very good.
Kelly C.,"Weymouth, MA",128,194,67,3.0,10/14/2010,"I have to say that this place is getting better. Maybe it's new management, maybe new waitstaff- I don't know. But it's noticeable better.  Food is good and lots to choose from. Drinks are boozy and large and desserts are well that's what they are known for. Only problem is, it always comes with a long wait for a table and an extremely large bill at the end.  I used to order the chicken costelletta and ask to substitute the asparagus (gag) for the green beans. They used to refuse to do it and even once the manager came over to say no. Why? green beans cost less on the menu than asparagus does and why not just do it to make me happy? they must have got a lot of complaints on things like that because now no one bats an eyelash when I ask. I know it seems silly but if I'm spending a lot of money on food, I don't want to be given a hard time about something silly like subbing a vegetable.  I get cheesecake to go a lot when I'm in the area which is always fast and convenient. I highly recommend the Chocolate Tower truffle cake (which is not cheesecake) for the chocolate overload of it."
Domenico B.,"Holbrook, MA",181,61,6,3.0,11/6/2008,"Went here on my birthday, not as my first choice, but because it was easy on the day before our move. You get what you pay for. The service was attentive, but we came during a shift change and switched from a pleasant and bubbly waitress to an older guy with a difficult-to-understand accent.  The biggest complaint came with my wife's entrée. She ordered wasabi-encrusted seared ahi tuna. That means the tuna should be cooked on the outside and raw on the inside. What she got was a piece of tuna steak that was ready to be mixed with mayo and slapped on a bun. It was cooked all the way through. Probably because the best way to ensure tuna is cooked properly is to cut it thick, not as thin as it was.  We weren't the only ones to have a problem. The guy at the booth behind us sent his burger back TWICE because it was underdone. My other complaint about Cheesecake Factory is that the menu is way too long. Choice can be good, but too much choice makes it hard to peruse it all and decide in the 2 minutes before the server comes back. It also means that the kitchen has to be prepared to cook way too many different dishes. ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" However, the place is loud enough that a toddler and an infant won't bother other diners with their normal good behavior. And I liked the jambalaya pasta dish I ordered, especially as it was appropriately spicy. Still, I don't know how often I'll come back. I won't be going out of my way to go there."
Bridget A.,"Holbrook, MA",1,7,,3.0,7/11/2011,"The food is usually really good here but the waitstaff is inconsistent. If you don't have a nice personality, don't become a waiter/waitress. Oh and the portions are way too big. No wonder why obesity's an epidemic."
Lili T.,"Boston, MA",38,55,1,2.0,11/18/2010,"Ugh can't say that I like this place. It's always a zoo in there.. Plus I can't stand the fact that I have to wait in line after speaking with the host it's so awkward it feels like a school cafeteria.  What's up with the long tables that if you get seated there, you'll probably be sitting directly next to a stranger!!? The food is ok, unless you get a mojito. They tend to forget to clean the mint leaves, thus allowing you to enjoy a SLUG as free dessert! YUCK I'm all set with this chain!"
Sara D.,"Hyde Park, MA",0,29,,3.0,6/6/2009,"Well, I have been to the cheesecake factory several times, and believe it is about time for a review.  I will start by saying that you do not get the full Cheesecake Factory experience at this location, due to the fact that it is always extremely busy and noisy at dinner time.   It is difficult to get beyond the door, because the wait is extremely long for dinner, especially on weekends.  I imagine that lunch must be better.  After waiting for over an hour at times, you finally sit down for a meal.   I usually get the shrimp scampi, which for me, is the best I have had anywhere.  If you are a big fan of shrimp scampi, you have to try theirs.  I have tried some other dishes, and they are okay, but nothing like the shrimp scampi they make.  Huge shrimp displayed on the plate, with a thick scampi sauce, pasta, and plenty of garlic.   The wait staff is generally friendly. I am not one of those people who complain about friendly service.  It kills me to see people complain about a waiter or waitress being ""too friendly.""  I am always appreciative of friendly service.   But, I recommend that you visit another location.  I am sure I'd be willing to give another location four stars.  This one is practically in the mall at the South Shore Plaza.  Parking is never good, even with that huge parking lot, and it is a long long wait to sit down to eat.  The place is also extremely noisy and not a good date spot.  Avoid the restaurants near malls, because the one in Cambridge has similar problems.  Find another Cheesecake Factory location and you may enjoy it."
Ray S.,"Rockland, MA",1,26,1,4.0,9/6/2010,"Awesome food! I've never tasted such delicious pasta in my life! Cheesecake is out of this world!! Average price 10-15 dollars, great wait staff! Ten pages of dishes to choose from and they have a wide variety! Everything is on the menu from Thai food to steak tips, pasta dishes, fish, humongous salads. Definitely try this restaurant if you can't decide what you feel like eating!"
Mister C.,"Brighton, MA",2,9,1,3.0,9/9/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to have a meal, but this location isn't always the best. I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night and of course, their is always a wait. But we did get seated eventually. The service wasn't bad, but wished the waiter was more attentive, like going us plates for the bread. The dishes and drinks came out and it was good. I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was good, but it had a lot of green and red peppers and onions and very little pieces of chicken and even pasta for that matter. But it was good. After the meal, I got a Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and it was mediocre and did not wow me. Maybe next time, I'll get something better."
