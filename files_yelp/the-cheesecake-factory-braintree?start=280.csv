Amanda P.,"Weymouth, MA",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2014,"Always been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and was there last month for lunch and had a great experience.  So two nights ago (a Tuesday night), I took my boyfriend there for his birthday.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated-we'd been told 20 but not a big deal.  We sat and ordered bar drinks...our server couldn't tell us the beers they had.  We asked her which Sam Adams' beer they had and she answered ""seasonal?"" Like she was asking us.  She seemed either new or too young to be familiar with beers/alcohol so also, no big deal. The place was packed so we were patient. Five minutes later we put in an app of buffalo blasts (which was sadly the best part of our meal)...and another 15 minutes later we got out appetizer-but still didn't have drinks.  We ended up asking for the manager...who did absolutely nothing but say they were busy-we didn't even get an apology.  There looked to be two bartenders on and the bar itself was half full...one of the bartenders was on her phone (texting or checking Facebook maybe) Then, our server proceeded to avoid us...luckily we'd already ordered our meals.  When the meals came, she did come back about ten minutes later to check how they were-we said ok but only to avoid making her feel any worse. They were both absolutely horrible-my chicken sandwich was dried out and the plate burnt my hand-it must have sat under the heat lamps for awhile.  My boyfriends fish and chips were mostly breading with minuscule bits of what we really hope was fish inside.  He's a huge seafood person and couldn't tell the type of fish they used. I've worked in restaurants my whole life and couldn't believe how bad the service was...and it was a combination of a lot of things, but none of it was our poor servers fault. So, if you do decide to go-please keep your expectations low."
Jane M.,"WAKEFIELD, RI",0,19,,2.0,11/17/2013,"Saturday evening. You've finally managed to get together with a couple friends for the day & the ""local"" friend suggests ending the day with a nice dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. It's pretty crowded, but you're told it will be a 30 minute wait. After an hour & ten minutes, you realize that drinking at the bar is not what you came for. So, you check-in with the front desk & the 2 hostesses look at each in disbelief when they take your plastic alert gadget; then say, ""We can seat you right away!""  There's no preventing telling our waitress how disappointed we are when we realize that our waitress is the one who took our name when we arrived.  She gets the manager, who apologizes & tells us that it's his responsibility for the error, trying to reduce the frustration by offering appetizers on the house & fast, hot food service from here on in.  We're grateful for the attempt & cheer up a bit.  Our ""new"" waitress was very attentive.  And our meals (way too big) came out fast but not hot.  Lots of ""Happy Birthday"" singing & clapping by the waiters all around for many tables. Instead, maybe they should help at the front desk if they have extra time? It's too noisy anyway.  That said, it's a beautiful restaurant if you get seated in a nice section.  I'm sure that there are better dining experiences here, but be prepared for either."
Nikki D.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,10,,1.0,8/2/2011,Horrible service. Our menu was encrusted in slime and filth and the pages were stuck together. When we asked for another menu the waiter gave us huge attitude. We just left. If they can't manage a clean menu then their kitchen must be a health hazard. Truly disgusting and bad management. We won't be going back to that location.
Jack L.,"Boston, MA",135,6,1,1.0,4/8/2012,"Our waiter Brian S was not good at all. When one of my of my friend wanted to order a drink he kept walking away when she didn't even finish talking yet. Second is we waited for a refill on water for 15 minute when is not busy at all, he was actually watching television at the bar. Finally when he walks by I ask him for water and he fill it to the top where I can't even move the glass without spilling it. The final thing is he left us to go box to pack in case we didn't finish our dinner when we didn't even finish eating yet. I believe that if a guest want their dinner to go the waiter or waitress suppose to pack it for you. But we had to pack it ourselves and there were no bags for us to put it in until we ask for it. I felt like our waiter Brian S was paying more attention to what's on the television then on the guest. We were going to order dessert after dinner but the service was so disappointing we end up going somewhere else for it.  I have been a lot of restaurant for dinner and by far this is the worst service I ever  had."
David M.,"Boston, MA",9,141,,2.0,1/24/2010,The Cheesecake Factory is probably the most overrated restaurant chain in my opinion.  There cheesecakes are excellent but their food leaves a lot to be desired.  One thing that does annoy me about there is the waiting times for tables.  Even at 9pm in can take over an hour to get a table.  I also had the unfortunate experience of my guest being served freezer-burned shrimp.
Francesca H.,"Somerville, MA",195,44,7,2.0,12/28/2009,"I like the restaurant in general..but this experience could have been better. The service was good but everything else seemed mediocre. During the entire visit I felt a draft in the restaurant and it was fairly cold out(30-40F) and I had to put on my coat at times. The food I ordered(the Jambalaya Cajun Pasta) was said to be a popular dish so my friend and I decided to split it. When it came out, the pasta wasn't very flavorsome(I had to add salt) and barely had any spicy taste to it. On the menu it said it was very spicy, and my friend and I barely felt the spicy tingle. The dish was actually pretty pricey for a plate of pasta(about $17) and definitely not worth it. The noodles were overcooked too. I knew we should have gone with the Chipotle pasta. I went for a friend's birthday and we asked the waiter for something for her birthday(they usually give a little ice cream for birthdays) and we had to tell him twice before we got it. By the second time, she knew about it and it wasn't oh so surprising."
Jason G.,"Abington, MA",49,163,4,3.0,3/21/2009,"Like any Cheesecake Factory the portions are huge, the wait is long, the tables are close together, but the food is usually good.  However this Cheesecake Factory is not free from problems.  The service is sometimes very slow, and not always friendly.  The cooks here have their own issues, especially that time I ended up with a toothpick wedged deep into my burger that cut me in the mouth and I almost swallowed.  I have been back since then, since who can avoid the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake for long."
Deb A.,"Covington, LA",11,6,,2.0,8/2/2011,"Heard so much about this place and finally went.  Bad mistake, the service was horrific, waitress rushing thru our dinner.  Had to send my entree back, over cooked, soup of the day was too salty.  Will not go again and would not recommend."
Jonathan B.,"Stoughton, MA",159,95,6,2.0,3/1/2008,"You should go to The Cheesecake Factory if you like to wait 30 minutes for a table, you like to stand in the middle of a mob while waiting for said table, you like to get oversold by your waiter, you like to be served portions that are laughably large, you like food that is bland and you like food that is overpriced. I would otherwise give The Cheesecake Factory one star but the service was above average."
Kristin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,275,1,3.0,10/21/2008,"to my delight i was taken out to lunch at the cheesecake; and even more delighted she didn't offer to take me out for chinese food. (which is standard considering the company i work for.) however, my partner in crime on my days in boston had already learned: ky + msg = brutal death.  i was also delighted when i walked in to a cheesecake factory which wasn't slammed to the walls with people and actually had smiling happy hostesses! HAZAH!  once seated our waitress was friendly and attentive, huge bonus in my book. my chicken quesadilla was ever so greasy with extra sour cream, and just as i like it.!!! it is also not a proper trip to the cheesecake without dessert! yeeeee! it's always so hard for me to decide... dulce de leche? tiramisu?  dutch apple? banana? in the end, i went for the dutch apple! sweet lord, twas heaven in my mouth!  i always enjoy going to the cheesecake. their menu is over the top with too many choices and their cheesecakes are goin' straight to my thighs and flanks! i just don't care. i leave full, happy and 10lbs heavier! :D"
Julie C.,"Boston, MA",139,572,20,3.0,8/18/2008,"cheesecake factory, what can i say, they are good. been here quite a few time at this location and the one in boston.  i like many of their dishes but i must say their shepard's pie ( and i loove shepards pie) was a bit disappointing. it was good but way too oily on the bottom. but the mash potatoes were brown on top! perfect! and their fries are yummy too! our waiter was real nice too. :-)"
James W.,"Arlington, MA",108,240,108,3.0,8/25/2008,"what i find amazing about this location for the cheesecake factory is, despite the fact it is absolutely humongous, there is always a wait to be seated.  late . . . early . . . mid-afternoon . . . whenever.  don't go hungry or you will end up across the hall at joe's american. that being said, the food is good and predictable.  between this location in the south shore plaza, the cambridgeside galleria and the chestnut hill location i've have everything from the burgers and sandwiches to seafood and pasta and have never had anything bad.  my personal favorites - the shrimp scampi which has a nice little spice that i cannot identify and the shrimp club sandwich which tastes much better than it sounds. i love cheesecake and try a different one each time.  damn the calories, damn the diets, you only go around once.  a piece of cheesecake isn't going to kill you . . . today.  get one. huge portions are always a hit with me.  combined with the reasonable prices and this is a place i would, and do, go to again and again. i hate to cross other people's reviews, but this location does NOT take reservations."
Steven C.,"Hull, MA",3,73,,2.0,9/29/2008,"I've been to this restaurant twice, and both times, I've been disappointed, whether it be at this location, or another.  I find the pasta entrees to be rather bland.  Why people wait for two hours to get a seat in this restaurant is beyond me (especially when right down the street is a Bertucci's, which I think has the best pizza around). The last time I was here, we waited 15 minutes and nobody even came to our table to offer us drinks.  Finally, I asked one of the waiters walking by if anyone was going to show up, and he kindly and quickly found our waitress.  A couple of minutes later, our waitress came over and apologized, saying that she forgot to come by and serve us.  Well, at least the cheesecake we got for dessert was delicious."
Kate O.,"Quincy, MA",12,14,3,2.0,12/10/2011,"feel like your eating a mess hall of a cafeteria, food is good but atmosphere is poor"
Jay J.,"Quincy, MA",0,18,,1.0,8/20/2008,"The cheesecake factory has somehow convinced people they aren't a chain restaurant and you should feel upscale when tell you there is a 2 hour wait.  I tried going twice and when I heard the wait I went next door to Joe's American Bar and Grill where I was seated right away.  For some reason I went back a third time me for lunch.  The menu was ridiculous to read, the drinks were overpriced, and the food was unexciting.  The only thing I liked was the actual building it's in.  Next time I want to go to a chain restaurant, I'll just go to the 99"
Tammi M.,"Quincy, MA",16,56,,3.0,5/15/2010,It's a consistent place. Service is all right. Food is good. Prices are on par with other restaurants of it's kind.
Sarah U.,"Randolph, MA",0,16,,2.0,8/18/2008,"The food and service is very overrated, but I must say if you go there just have the cheesecake...mmmm good"
