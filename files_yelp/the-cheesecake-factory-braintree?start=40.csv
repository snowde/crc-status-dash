Vivienne N.,"Boston, MA",12,22,6,1.0,6/2/2017,There were 2 flies in my water. We had to remind them to bring the bread and butter for us. We ordered the Newyork steak and they charged us for the more expensive Ribeye steak on the receipt. Totally unprofessional.
Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",322,374,,5.0,3/8/2017,Just got back from having lunch there. I went with my usual chicken with biscuits and left the restaurant very satisfied. I didn't leave any room for cheesecake this time but I've had it there before and all varieties I've had so far have been great. I just found out there today that they're implementing this new thing where you have to ask for bread if you want it served to you. Because both myself and the table next to me hadn't been served bread yet and when we asked about it the waitress explained that the reason that the bread is no longer being served automatically is due to people with food allergies and from now on if a table wants bread they must now ask that it be served. This is a first for me because I've been there countless times in the past and have never had to ask for it. My guess is they may be trying to cut back on waste. Makes me wonder if I'll see this policy starting to trend at many of the various chains out there now. But very nice experience this afternoon and excellent food as usual.

A. P.,"Aptos, CA",23,23,2,1.0,8/9/2017,"Last May, we went to a Cheese Cake Factory in San Diego twice for dinner while attending a conference.  We had delicious food and experienced prompt, courteous service. Because of this experience, we decided to have dinner at the Cheese Cake Factory while on a business trip to Braintree, MA.  The decor was exactly the same, but that's where the similarity ended.  This restaurant is so poorly managed and the servers are so overworked that, once we were seated, our server didn't appear at our table for 15 minutes.  She patiently explained the menu options and took our dinner orders.  A basket of bread was delivered, so we thought our dinners where right behind.  After waiting for another 45 minutes, we finally asked another server to check the status of our orders, but she never returned!  Frustrated, we left the restaurant hungry, disappointed, and very dissatisfied.  Obviously, not all Cheese Cake Factory restaurants are the same!  We'll never return!"
Steve F.,"Boston, MA",0,23,2,1.0,10/14/2017,"Avoid this location, very disappointed with the service. The food was ok. First Let me say that I have been to at least half a dozen cheesecake factories across the country and have had great experiences at all of them, except this one.  I visited this location 3 times in the last 2 months. I will never go back.  First visit, terrible service. Took 20 minutes to have our server take our drink order. When we said ""can we give you the whole order now?"" She said ""no, I'll have to come back for that"". We ordered two apps ahead of our meal. But our main courses arrived WITH our apps. Same time! We expressed our dismay and the waitress said ""do you want me to take your food back and keep it warm?""  Yeah, no thanks.  So we tried at again two weeks later. Better service but once again, apps came out with our main courses. We told the waitress that this happened to us 2 weeks earlier.   She alluded that it was a common problem.  Last week we said ""let's give it one more shot"". This time we sat at the bar. It was around 9pm on a Saturday. While the drinks came quick since we were at the bar (go figure) we waited 22 minutes to get BREAD (we timed it). Put in our app and dinner order and SPECIFICALLY SAID "" can you make sure our apps come out first?"" The waiter looked confused and said ""of course"". Low and behold, 20 minutes later another waitress shows up with a big tray with our apps AND dinners. At this point I was pissed. I said ""why does this ALWAYS happen here? Do you not understand what an appetizer is?, this happens here all the time"" her response was ""really? All the time?""  With a snotty tone. I asked to speak with a manager. Nobody ever showed up. Our original waiter came back and asked ""how is everything?""  I pointed to the apps on the table with our dinners and said ""what do you think?""  He looked surprised and apologized but made no offer to correct the situation.  So I am never giving this location another dollar again. Either their training is lacking or their is zero management oversight. But to screw up the simplest of tasks in large restaurant that often is completely unacceptable."
Sarah P.,"Hyde Park, MA",0,13,1,5.0,10/2/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory! The food is always good and the servers are always nice towards my husband and I.
Felicia S.,"Braintree, MA",2,41,111,2.0,11/29/2016,"This place has really gone down hill. The service is horrible. After waiting 45 minutes for a table, we finally sat down and had to wait another 15 minutes for a waitress to come over and take our drink and appetizer order. We asked for the lettuce wraps (which are AMAZING) but then had to wait another 45 minutes for those to come to us, when we put in our dinner order....hour and a half for our food to come out. I get it was busy and other tables were waiting long too but not this long.  I will deff only be ordering take out from here on out.  The foods still good but just not worth the time"
Mdog W.,"Boston, MA",0,16,1,2.0,10/15/2016,"Came here at lunch time with 2 teenage children 15 and 16 after being at hospital. Wanted quiet family conversation. Unfortunately we were ""profiled"" and sat in a section with screaming toddlers and babies. At one point a bowl was thrown through the air and just disintegrated on the floor next to us. I was appalled to be sat in a 6 table cordoned off corner that represented a very badly run day care.  Food was as expected. You know what you're getting, frozen perfected, chain recipe. Fried appetizers were good because they were fried. Burger is average, eggplant Parmesan is average, chicken Madeira is very good however. I think that's one of their few staple items that remain popular. The dessert was like a top of a wedding cake you take out of your freezer a year later.   Which was surprising and disappointing. However the number 1 most mind blowing thing about this surreal experience was the check included a suggested gratuity. As if the waitstaff weren't affected and arrogant enough they have the audacity to list a suggested gratuity on your check. If this is a corporate suggestion I suggest the Cheesecake Factory reels it in."
Samantha G.,"Scituate, MA",280,61,508,5.0,2/13/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the best! Everything on the menu is delicious. The menu is more like a novel; so many options from drinks to entrees and appetizers and of course, dessert! Any time is the perfect time for this restaurant. Just this year alone, I went for my birthday, New Year's Eve, and to celebrate my first year in college.  My favorite items here are the orange chicken with white rice plate, the tropical iced tea, the Godiva cheesecake, the strawberry shortcake dessert, and the salted caramel cheesecake. Side note, the bread and butter there is always warm and fluffy. The brown bread is my favorite.  Happy service, great food, great atmosphere. Definitely go here!"
Mark P.,"Braintree, MA",0,10,2,1.0,8/3/2016,"This was one of my favorite places to eat but it has gone done hill for past several years. The quality of the foods that they serve is horrible. Soups served cold and salty. Salads drenched in dressing. Meat balls in pasta were raw in the center. Simple chicken salad sandwich took 45 min because the bread was not ready. And many more issues with our food at different occasions. The server who brought out the foods were poorly trained. Fingers all over the dishes or bowl.  The cleanliness of the place has declined over the years. The floors are greasy and filthy. How many times can the managers apologize?  I hope management reevaluate their food quality control and service. Proper training of kitchen staff and severs is needed at this restaurant in Braintree, MA. Corporate need to visit the place before it is too late!"
Kilo M.,"Oulches-la-Vallée-Foulon, France",1,51,14,1.0,9/14/2017,"Guess the girl with dark brown hair idolize the trashy charter penny from BBT. She was extreamly rude to my mother on her birthday. Shocked this was allowed. I demanded a Manger and she said no, you don't deserve a manager. I've been eatting at cheese cake factor sense it opened. Go to go to a different location for now on. One where the staff is actually nice and not nasty."
Peng L.,"Quincy, MA",380,125,144,3.0,12/30/2015,"Went with a few friends before New Year's Eve and the food was pretty decent. Got the Cajun jambayalan pasta and it was pretty plain compared to say the spicy chipotle pasta I usually get. We also got the herb salmon, spicy chipotle, shepherds pie, and a cheeseburger. The salmon was pretty good, not too dry. The sauce was tangy and the asparagus was a little bitter to my taste. The design kind of looks like a claw with a bunch of fingers too so we got a laugh out of that. My friend says that it was pretty plain.  The shepherds pie was not what I had imagined. It had mashed potatoes on top with mushrooms and ground beef on the bottom with a subtle sauce. I thought it was all right when I took a bite out of it from my friend's plate.  The spicy chipotle was okay. Just like the usual which is always a plus.  The Cajun pasta had shrimp and chicken. They were both so full of moisture and not dry. The only down part was that the whole dish isn't very seasoned. It was so plain I had to add extra salt and pepper to get SOME flavor in my mouth.  SERVICE: It was really good. Our waiter was super friendly and got us a lot of bread which I personally loved. The only downside was that my friend's spicy chipotle order was wrong. But we just had to wait around 5-10 more minutes but we were all eating when his food wasn't there which wasn't enjoyable.  This is a good place to go with family and such. No high expectations from such a hyped up place."
Amir S.,"Boston, MA",281,21,12,2.0,8/18/2016,"We planned a birthday outing for my daughter who turned 11. Ordered a Red Velvet cake for our table. For starters, we ordered the Firecracker Salmon (extremely salty this go round) and the Chicken Dumplings (too salty for everybody's taste buds). My wife ordered the Tex-Mex (her favorite), and unless you like beef, corn and whatever else goes in that, there was absolutely NO SEASONING. For the meals, I asked the server what sides came with the burger. She explained that I had the option of having regular fries, sweet potato pies or seasoned fries. I chose the seasoned fries and a medium burger. My daughter ordered the golden fried shrimp with fries. My wife ordered the Mac and Cheese Balls. Our order comes back and the fries were cold WITHOUT seasoning. I asked the server if they had any seasoned fries. She replied: ""those ARE seasoned. They're seasoned with salt."" I then asked, so what's the difference between your regular fries, your seasoned fries and your sweet potato fries? She said: ""the fries are seasoned."" I sent the plate back and I also sent back my daughter's salty dumplings. The manager brought back the ""seasoned"" fries and they were cold. I complained that it appeared they had seasoned cold fries. The server tried to convince me they wouldn't do that (while I'm staring at a cup of cold fries). Needless to say, they took the whole plate three times with the same burger on it that had now gone from medium to nearly well done somehow, but definitely cold. I changed everything and got chicken sliders. They brought them out hot, minus the cheese, and NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER. Since the place was built, my wife and I have been there countless times. This is perhaps the worst of times. I tipped the server $26 (a little over 20%) because I would hope it would be an incentive to REMEMBER A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER next time.  After the manager gave us this history rhetoric about how the morning prep comes in and makes sure every ""ingredient"" is added to their 30-something-year specifications, we left. As always, the cheesecake was on the square. OH! The manager came back to the table and said: ""I checked and tasted the Tex-Mex, and you're right. They do not have any taste to them. But there's nothing we can do about that now, because whatever we have has been prepped for today already."" ??? (sigh) #FlashFrozenFoods #GottaLoveIt"
Abby W.,"Mansfield, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/23/2017,The food was mediocre at best but I had too wait over 2 hours just too get my food. This place is overrated. You could easily go to a small Italian place with better food. That is 2 hours of my life I will never get back. My waiter  took 10 minutes just to get my drink refilled. I am outraged! The fries at McDonald's are better then these things. The cheese cake is to expensive for my likening. Never again!
Tiffany K.,"Forest Hills, NY",23,110,161,2.0,12/1/2015,"My boyfriend and I were excited to come here for dinner and cheesecake.  Im usually content with the food especially there are some Cheesecake Factory in NYC. However, I was quite disappointed.  I ordered Shrimp with Angel Hair. When my order came, I was so shocked. My dish was literally covered with tomatoes.  It was seriously overload with tomatoes.  We ordered the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake. I don't understand why our waitress decided to overload the slice with whip cream.  The service was decent. Im not sure if I would want to come back to this restaurant anytime soon.."
Samantha I.,"Quincy, MA",8,67,75,5.0,12/26/2016,"This was the 2nd time that we've done catering here, and will definitely not be the last. The chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala entrees were so good. The avocado egg rolls were also delicious, along with the crab cakes. It was very organized too when I got there, everything was ready on time and packaged nicely (although not labeled on the outside of the containers which I wish they did). The catering orders come with their delicious bread too. Thank you CF!"
Amanda T.,"Quincy, MA",84,29,21,3.0,12/8/2015,"Usually like this place, but things were a bit off this time around. Somewhat expected with big chains like this though. When being brought to our table, the floors were extremely slippery. Not that it was wet or anything was on the floor, but seriously had to walk with caution or else you would have fallen. Once getting to the table, I noticed right away that both of my forks were dirty with previous food crusted on. Before taking a sip from my cup of water, the cup was crusted with bits of food and the food was floating in the water. Once we told our server, even he said ""that is pretty gross."" He brought a new cup of water and make sure to check that it was clean. Our server was attentive and really chill.  We got the Gluten Free pasta with shrimp and tomatoes, the shrimp was not deveined and the meal itself needed more flavor. The pasta carbonara was just okay. We also got the bbq chicken pizza which was pretty good.  Luckily we saved space for dessert. We got the original cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream. It was delicious although a bit too soft. There was plenty of whipped cream almost too much, but then again you can never have too much!"
Wai W.,"Quincy, MA",7,98,160,3.0,7/28/2016,"I have been to this location many times and other locations as well.  Everyone has been to Cheesecake more than once, either for their food or their cheesecake.    Today we came for their happy hour to grab some quick bites before the movie.  We ordered the Tex-mex roll, salad, Fried Mac&cheese balls, and all were good.  I always like their varieties of bread, usually the wheat bread.  Service was good."
Shannon F.,"Westport, MA",163,449,501,2.0,11/15/2016,"So I am writing this update because you screwed up again Cheesecake Factory.  Why do you make me want to hate you?  I ordered this very simple thing: nachos with chicken and guacamole on the side.  I didn't mention I was a vegetarian because it wasn't in my eyes necessary.  Apparently it was necessary.  Because she came out with the nachos and repeated back to us politely ""nachos with guacamole and chicken on the side""  Put down the plate and walked away.  Only for me to find out that they had chicken.  I sent them back, and she back to tell us that the cheese sauce they use has chicken broth in it.  ""whaaaa?"" we said!  But I really did thank her for at least telling us that instead of making them again and me getting sick.  I really feel however that this should have been avoided to begin with, but I think it's such a crazy place to work they're not being trained properly in food safety."
Evan M.,"West Bridgewater, MA",11,313,49,2.0,4/25/2016,"This is our local Cheesecake Factory and we've always had a great time here, but our visit yesterday will probably be the last for a while.  The place is filthy and there's no nicer way to say it.  There were piles of food underneath our booth that clearly hadn't been swept in a few days.  There were crumbs and food on the booth and next to the table by the window.  The table top hadn't also hadn't been wiped clean before they set it with clean silverware and napkins.  And there's layers of dust everywhere. It was disgusting.  Evidently there's a cleaning crew that comes into the restaurant each night, but they're not doing their job and the restaurant needs to supplement their cleaning. Unfortunately it didn't get much better from there.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken served to us was completely raw. Pretty much red inside.  We were told that this chicken is cooked on the salad side, but that the chicken cooked on the other side of the kitchen ""should be fine"".  Well what about all of the other people in the restaurant being served chicken from the salad side? Anyways it was a disappointing experience and we probably wouldn't return unless the kitchen gets it's act together, and the restaurant is cleaned.  The only saving grace was the waitress who was a lot of fun, and tried to make the best of an experience that was going downhill quickly."
