Lisa M.,"Boston, MA",20,63,51,5.0,8/22/2016,The food at the Cheesecake Factory is superb! I had the lemon shrimp with asparagus and it was awesome!  The burrito dish was huge.  The appetizers were good sized portions. The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake was to die for.  This place is busy and I can see why. The food is very good. The waitress we had was attentive and made our dining experience here awesome
Olive W.,"Quincy, MA",48,6,1,2.0,9/10/2016,"Have always thought this place was over rated over priced, but knew you could always expect big portions, well the other night was going to visit some friends and stopped to pick up two slices of cheesecake to go. Only two slices because I remember them being large enough to share. So it seems they have changed the size to HALF  of what they use to be , but not the price, or the sense to change the to go package so it was very clear they are NOT the same size $8 per slice , I won't lie they were good,but feel cheated with the portions ."
J D.,"Braintree, MA",0,6,,2.0,3/1/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory but last night had the worst experience by far. I've always had great food and service but these were lacking.  First off, waited unusually long for beverages and had to ask for bread. My son ordered cheeseburger sliders which he got with no cheese. He decided to eat them and they were overcooked and just gross. My other son ordered a regular cheeseburger (medium) and it was just charred! We sent it back and the waitress said the cook was making another one and it would take time. (like it was our fault it needed to go back) She brought out the second one. Minus Fries (they couldn't throw a few more on the plate so my son could eat a couple hot ones with his burger?) This one was charred as well Neither boy ate much of his sandwich and waitress made no notice of it. She should of asked what was wrong.  Very disappointed! Learn how to cook a burger!"
Lily L.,"Quincy, MA",2,4,1,1.0,1/28/2017,"We really love cheesecake factory, I know they are always busy, but this time we are super pissed at the situation, they are really bad at managing wait time....misleading the wait time, we waited there an at Least 90 minutes for nothing and left... definitely not going back anytime soon with the kids...."

Michael H.,"Holbrook, MA",0,20,8,5.0,7/19/2017,"The cheesecake factory is always good. If you liked your meal once, you will like it the second time. Very consistent high quality delicious food."
Lilly T.,"South Weymouth, Weymouth, MA",0,11,1,5.0,6/20/2017,"I love this place and go everytime. I love the bread and the baked mac and cheese. However I always get the ahi tar tar and the lat month or so they have been ""out of tuna"". I just don't understand why it would take so long to get more tuna. This is always a go to spot with my friends, however the food isn't always worth the wait since sometimes the wait gets crazy. Overall love this place just wish they kept up with their menu. Menu doesn't change much AT ALL which is good since I know what I like but i would like to see a new menu"
bobby l.,"Quincy, MA",0,10,58,4.0,12/19/2016,Foods are ok. Had ordered filet mignon but over cook.  Wasted $30. The spicy chicken pasta is good. I liked it. Service is good. This deserve a next time. Will come back some other time to see any improvement on the cooking.
Erik P.,"Thornton, NH",0,38,1,1.0,8/15/2016,"If I may say that this place went down the tubes. From the poor quality in food, to waitresses having a personality of a tick. Order we had wasn't done right. And brought out the wrong stuff. I am sick of this place and how bad it became. What happened? They used to be good.  Sadly enough I didn't have any luck finding a manager as I spent a few minutes asking for one. About 10 minutes went by and we gave up and left. No manager came out."
Kayla M.,"Quincy, MA",50,2,,2.0,5/30/2017,"Only reason I gave a two is because the food was amazing. I went here for my birthday and had the most careless waitress. The table was small and cramped to begin with and when we asked our server to clear our dishes from the bread, she said ok then walked away. We had to eat with every dish we had still on the table. We asked for straws and she said ok and again walked away. After the 4th time asking we finally went to the bar to get our own. When it came time for the bill, we waited 15 min for her to wrap our food up (and by wrap I mean throw it into a box messily). Waiting for change took over a half hour. When we asked to talk to a manager she was also very rude and didn't apologize about the service. She just said ""I'll go find her"". The waitress came back over with our money still in her pocket saying ""you needed something?"". I understood it was busy, so we went to give it another try and got a latte that we had ordered the night before. The cashier rang it in as the wrong drink. We said that to the women who made them and she ordered to remake it, we said it was ok and she went back to work. We tasted the drink and it was gross so we asked her if she would mind remaking it and she said it's made the same way and refused to make it over again even though she just offered a min ago. Needless to say I will not be returning to this location and wasting my money on horrible service."
Grant C.,"Brentwood, NH",27,123,79,3.0,12/23/2016,"This is an okay restaurant the food was above par. In my Coke Zero their was some unidentified object. It was fixed immediately. The cheesecake was amazing. Parking was nuts, took 20 min to find a space. I'd give it another shot."
Jessica N.,"Quincy, MA",239,146,66,3.0,3/14/2015,The food here is decent. One of my usual go to places at the mall since it is larger than most of the restaurants that are located at the south shore plaza. I tend to never make it to dessert and always end up bringing my meal home since the portions are huge.  The servers are fast and efficient since there is usually always a crowd. They're informative and are nice even when customers are being groggy.  I tend to stick to the pasta selections although I have tried many items from the menu. I still have yet to try the sunday brunch! I will eventually as the menu looks so enticing to me.
Katie R.,"Quincy, MA",130,347,204,3.0,1/15/2015,"I used to go to the cheesecake factory ALL OF THE TIME when I lived in providence.  when this one opened up I went a few times but by that point in my life I had realized there was more to life then 2,000 calorie plates of pasta.  However I recently went here with my mother around brunch o'clock and I had their crab hash.  I would 100% go there again just to get this.  Super light great flavors with crab and celery and peppers and onions with a little bit of hollandaise and two poached eggs.  Yum.  It probably still had 2000 calories in it but oh well.  My mother had some kind of french toast monstrosity that was also delicious."
Caren B.,"Dedham, MA",112,48,21,2.0,8/14/2016,"I was in a party of 10 last night. We were seated after our 40 minute wait, which was not bad. After siting there for maybe 15 minutes or even more the waiter came to take our food and drink order all at once. I had a question about the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and if I could have it without mushrooms to which he said yes. Well over a half hour later he came back to let me know that it was in the sauce. So then I had to make another decision and went with the eggplant Parmesan. Everyone else's food came out and after I waited while everyone else ate my food finally came out. The eggplant tasted like it was covered in pepper. It was so gross I only ate my pasta. I should of just skipped eating all together as I waited long enough. I do not think I will return to this location ever again. The waiter should know the menu and if not ask the kitchen. I also should add to the fact that the table I sat at had huge cracks all over and it was very sharp where the cracks were because they are granite. The floor was also very dirty as well. This place has gone so downhill from what it used to be."
Marie L.,"Allston, MA",0,39,4,2.0,4/2/2017,"Ew. The drinks are fun, the atmosphere is fun. The food is bland . I've had Cheesecake Factory twice in my life. The mehhh food isn't worth the INSANELY high calories. If you're going to have a cheat meal make it worth it by going anywhere but here."
Time K.,"Atlanta, GA",1,12,,3.0,8/13/2016,"Buffalo chicken is plentiful and taste good.  The mild is pretty hot.. Burgers are okay, the Kobe burger is the best out of the choices of meat.  Pizza is very good, menu is large.   Atmosphere is decent although most times I go there always to seems to be at least one fly buzzing around..."
Jessica Y.,"Boston, MA",218,232,554,3.0,11/27/2013,"You must try the cheesecake here. I always look forward to the dessert at this place. Anything peanut butter, Oreos, Godiva chocolate, or fruity are the best. Their red velvet cake is fluffy and apple crisp is good too. Today I tried the toasted marshmallow s'mores cheesecake. It was yummmm but the slice was so big even for three to share after our lunch.  The food is ok. Nothing special that I would go around telling people to try. I've had few of their burgers and pasta dishes. Their portions are huge and I normally have to take the rest to go. If you are looking for something a little better than UNOs, Applebee's and TGIF, come here."
Bryant F.,"Randolph, MA",3,100,3,4.0,7/16/2016,When here tonight with the wife and family. The food was excellent. Can't understand the negative comments. They have everything on the menu you could want. Extremely satisfied!!! Only slight negative is the waiter could have been faster but he was cool. Will be back!
Jennifer S.,"North Attleborough, MA",31,143,56,2.0,11/21/2015,I usually love this place but not today. The waitress was MIA. They brought everyone's food out except my 9yr olds. Waitress never came back to ask how pur meal was and we have been waiting forever for the check. The potato soup was subpar and not warm enough. The kids grilled cheese was good but nothing great. The flavored iced tea (passion fruit) was watery lacking taste and the rest of the meals were just okay. Not worth the expensive bill.
Katie C.,"Norton, MA",0,5,7,1.0,2/24/2017,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and have gone to many locations! However, the only time I ate at this location, I got food poisoning from eating the chicken potstickers! Beware!"
