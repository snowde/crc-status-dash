Meaghan H.,"Haverhill, MA",2,2,,2.0,5/22/2016,"We experienced excellent service and an enjoyable meal on a busy Sunday afternoon. However, the staff and management at the host stand were cold, unwelcoming and don't seem to be fit for hospitality. A little kindness goes a long way, even with a bit of a wait. You expect to wait at the Cheesecake Factory, but I do not expect to feel like a number being called at the deli counter."
Juliana P.,"San Diego, CA",29,271,19,2.0,10/23/2014,"I'd like to specifically dedicate this review to the Cheesecake Factory ""skinny"" menu.  Overall, at this location we had great service and sat at one of the ""bar"" tables. It always kills me how fancy Cheesecake Factory is inside...for a chain.  Anyways, it seems like Cheesecake Factory is of the ""any meal is a 500 calorie meal depending on what you eat"" school of thought. Most of the options on this menu were the same unhealthy choices they normally have, just in tiny portions. Luckily they adjust the prices accordingly. And to be honest, their normal portions are way to big, so it's nice to get small plates from this menu.  I won't even go into what my meal companion had (not on the skinnylicious menu or whatever). I ordered the grilled artichoke and the beet salad. I wouldn't reccomend the beet salad--it just didn't really taste fresh, and it was a little acidic in a bad way...like the beets had been washed in soap or something. The grilled artichoke was actually really good. The dipping sauce is a nice little addition to the plate so you don't feel like you are totally eating rabbit food. I applaud the commitment to giving more options, but I find that cheesecake factory often does a lot of things but not well. I know ""dessert"" and ""skinny"" seem like they are mutually exclusive, but I would push them to develop more gluten free or vegan options for dessert (I know they can do more than a bowl of strawberries if they have 30+ cheesecakes)."
Chris M.,"Boston, MA",0,19,10,4.0,2/15/2016,"The food was good. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Overall, it was delicious. No complaints about the food. It was the sanitary conditions that made me hesitate to give this place 5 stars. The utensils were not clean; they had food on them. I asked our waiter to give us a new set, and she did. Still, I was not completely comfortable using them.  Service was great. Our waiter knew a lot about the menu and served us well."
Chris M.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,1.0,2/11/2017,Seated ourselves at a high top. Waitress came over promptly gave us menus and took our drink orders and never came back
Todd S.,"Braintree, MA",1,6,,2.0,8/30/2016,"Cheesecake factory always has a huge selection on the menu, but it is overpriced. I went to the location at the South Shore plaza and the wait was about 40 minutes. I ordered the Cuban eggrolls and chicken piccatta and after a long wait for my food, it was just alright. The best thing is the carrot cake cheesecake"
Amariza R.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,5.0,7/13/2016,"Cheesecake Factory, has the best bartender Christina, Casio, mark, Michelle visa and Kelsey. ARE JUST AMAZING.  I have been to manny restaurants, Boston, NYC Europe. You named. For some reason the service me, my husband and friend received is just implacable. Red carpet. Ps they do it with everyone.  They are so engaged with clients.  Their personality is just FIVE STARR.  I HAVE BEEN HERE BECAUSE OF THEM. THE BARTENDERS. Xoxo AMARIZA"
Jessica P.,"STONEHILL COL, MA",1,5,,1.0,7/29/2016,Horrible! My food came out wrong so I send it back. They brought back the same meal just brought my dressings on the side. I told the waitress that my salad was still missing wontons and had barely any beans and I'm lucky if I got an ounce and a half of chicken.  I get this same meal every time so I know how it should be. She told me she was going to get the manager but instead she came back and said that they were going to buy my cheesecake instead. The cheesecake on this particular day was half off so this was not adequate compensation for my poor meal and the bad service. They shouldn't have charged me for my meal or at least given both deserts for free considering they were only $3.95 on this day. Bad management!
Yesenia R.,"Brockton, MA",320,30,71,5.0,4/15/2015,Omg I love coming here great atmosphere very good service the waiters are on time always sweet love the food definitely try the fish
Amelia S.,"Stoneham, MA",1,11,,1.0,12/27/2016,Hope you have lots of time when coming here. Waited an hour and 10 minutes after being quoted 35 minutes. The meal took over 2 hours and then when the bill arrived the waitress took 25bucks cash for her tip and charged the rest of the cards for the split bill. Essentially deciding what her tip should be. No thank you. Pretty sure the customer decides that. Also that bill took over 30 minutes to transact. Thanks I really wanted to spent 6 hours at the Cheesecake Factory.
Rose A.,"Medford, MA",1,16,62,4.0,6/21/2016,Our waitress was nice but i could tell she really didn't want to be there that evening. Wasn't very friendly. My food on the other hand was delicious. I ordered a Smokehouse B.B.Q Burger w/ sweet potatoe fries and a raspberry lemonade. Everything tasted great!
Ryan F.,"Foxboro, MA",0,1,,5.0,12/18/2016,Came in for a quick lunch. Louisiana pasta was great and the service was first class. Micky was terrific! Gonna ask for him again
Jenn G.,"East Weymouth, MA",1,43,21,2.0,12/14/2016,So I had an awful Cheesecake Factory experience actually 3 of them on the 3rd strike I wrote a review and contacted the company to my surprise they wanted to do right by me as a costumer and sent me an apology letter and a gift card inviting me back to there restaurant. Might go maybe a lunch won't try on a dinner when I'm starving and with cranky kids but might go back I will keep everyone posted and   Koodo's to the manager over there for being a people person and actually catering about costumers good job Bill
London W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,5,1,1.0,5/13/2016,"Great service, terrible food. It's Friday the 13th idk if that had to do anything with it.."
Paul A.,"Boston, MA",21,14,3,5.0,6/4/2016,Great Service by Brittany! I had the Chicken Ballagio...was to die for. Ended with the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake.
Elfego S.,"Revere, MA",22,134,552,4.0,6/15/2015,"Me and the wife where hungry after we went registry shopping for a few hours. We decide to go to the Cheesecake Factory in the south shore plaza. For a Sunday night it was fairly busy and very active. They told us 10 min for outdoor seating for 2, and sure enough it was pretty fast. Bread took a little bit of time to get there after we ordered our food and drinks but pretty usual it's busy. Food was delicious, cooked real well and made to perfection. Our meals were really good and the desert was not that bad. The original cheesecake was good but a little to soft. I was used to those kind of cheesecakes that when you cut into them they are still pretty sturdy in a way. If that makes any sense to anybody but I ate it anyways."
James C.,"West Barnstable, MA",0,9,9,3.0,3/5/2015,"The food is consistently great, but the service feels rushed. A major part of going out to eat is the service, the experience, and the cheese cake factory is just that a factory approach to your food service."
Chad G.,"East Weymouth, MA",65,58,98,4.0,2/28/2015,"""Chad's Eats"" review of The Cheesecake Factory   Cuisine: Friggin Everything ! Location: Braintree Mall  Parking: It's the mall so on the weekends and especially losing hundreds of spots to snow mountains it can suck  Decor / Ambiance: Beautiful. This is a top class chain in my mind. There are a few chains I endorse and this is one.  Greeting:  Pros even when slamming busy they have a system in place to get you seated at quickly as possible.  Menu mix:  Oh boy! When I said ""friggin everything"" in the cuisine I meant it. It is without a doubt the biggest menu you will ever see. It's a lot to take in AND they got specials on top of the endless selections. Pick any cuisine and I guarantee its  on there.  Water / Bread service: Excellent, bread is great. They give you a dark molasses type bread and a French baguette. Hard to stay away from eating it all.  Drink pour:  Don't  remember getting wine or drinks but from what I have seen at other tables it looks like a generous pour.  Food quality:  I always enjoy my food here. Food always seems to be fresh, the presentation is always neat and clean flavors are always right on. Service: These folks are pros. Very attentive.  Value: Consistent with the food quality, service and ambience  Bathrooms: Spotless  Would I return? Always do, mostly for lunch Comments & Tips:  They have great salads, one of my favorites is in the skinnylicious menu. Goes down grade after having a couple of cheeseburger sliders which are awesome. I also really like their fish tacos and when it comes to their cheesecakes it is one of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in life because they're so friggin awesome. One of my all-time favorites is the red velvet cheesecake and a pineapple upside down cheesecake and to many more to Mention and oh my God my stomach is rumbling now thinking about it"
Julie B.,"Boston, MA",0,11,,1.0,11/12/2016,"My husband an I went there  on Friday night. We had a great waitress. I ordered the chicken enchiladas off the skinnylicious menu. However, I could live without the RAW chicken inside of the enchiladas. I totally lost my appetite. I'm thinking that cooking chicken falls correctly falls under cooking 101. The manager did not seem to care. However, the waitress was very apologetic. I won't be going back!"
G K.,"South Easton, MA",1,170,4,2.0,6/24/2015,"Sorry, this food is way , way over salted.  There is something very heavy about the taste.  I will not return. Service and atmosphere is nice."
D S.,"Quincy, MA",0,77,2,1.0,1/4/2016,"Usually i come here since food is decent but today... Just baffled me. Stale old bread. Stale fries with my order. Whoever made my drink put my HOT drink in a GLASS, instead of a mug. How'd they solve this? Just put a sleeve on it. The hot chocolate was basically a cup of milk. Strawberry shortcake was perhaps stale or old because it was tough/chewy. It was more like shortbread ice cream sandwiches with whipped cream and strawberries on the side. Burger was alright at best. Should've gone to Fridays instead."
