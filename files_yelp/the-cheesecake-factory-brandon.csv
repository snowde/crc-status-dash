Laura M.,"Tampa, FL",4,27,118,5.0,12/30/2017,"My family loves The Cheesecake Factory!  We have been to many different locations!  Having recently moved to the area we have tried this particular location several times already!  The restaurant is always clean and the staff are always friendly and on point.  They have a really nice outdoor seating area as well with heaters for the cooler weather or chilly evenings.   When you are seated the server will take your drink order and bring you a basket of bread and butter.  The bread is delicious and my favorite is the brown bread!   The menu here has something for Everyone.  The food is delicious and is served in very large portions.  I can never finish my meal.  It's a great place for large groups or get togethers!  They have a full bar as well.   Don't forget to save room for their amazing cheesecake!!  I have tried most over the years!  They are all delicious.  If you are full you can always get a slice to go.  I've done that many times. It will be as enjoyable later or even the next day.   At this visit my husband had their meatloaf which he loves.  He had leftovers for lunch because they give such a large amount of food.   I ordered a favorite of mine, the Chicken Madeira.  I wanted to lick my dish!  If you haven't tried this you must!! The restaurants description as follows: Our most popular chicken dish! Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes. A little hint from me would be to order some extra Madeira Sauce on the side,  because it's that good!!   I"
Dr. Richard M.,"Riverview, FL",4,48,67,4.0,11/12/2017,"Everyone knows the this place has the best cheesecake on the planet. But their food and drink menu is extensive. The portions are large and the food is very good. If you want cheesecake, skip the starters. Entrees you must try are Pasta DaVinci, Chicken Bellagio, Factory meatloaf, cuban sandwich, Factory burrito, Bistro shrimp pasta, any any of their burgers. The cheesecake comes in over 30 flavors. You have to decide for yourself. Tip; go up to the dessert counter and look at the different cheesecakes  before you order a slice."
Lisa M.,"Brandon, FL",50,116,125,4.0,10/23/2017,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints in the food department but I have only been 3 times and have bad wait service each and every time. Stuffed mushrooms off the small bird section are amazing and a perfect low carb option. Cuban egg rolls I also highly recommend...major comfort food! Boyfriends fave is the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich.....the marinara they bring for dipping is top notch.
Lindsay D.,"Riverview, FL",193,64,714,4.0,11/22/2017,I went to the cheesecake factory this week in the first time in years. I must say every time I go there I am surprised at how many menu options they have. I really believe anybody could find something to eat here. This time I got the steak Diane and the meat was tender and paired well with the mushroom maderia sauce mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got the truffle honey chicken and it was extremely tender. I convinced him to split his leftovers with me after trying it.  My Dad got the chicken carbonara and loved it especially the cream sauce. For dessert I got the Adam's peanut butter and fudge ripple. It was very good and I loved the butterfinger inside. There food isn't the best I've tried but all of it is very good and the large variety helps. Looking forward to my next visit.
Jalisa C.,"Douglasville, GA",129,27,26,4.0,1/8/2018,"Cheesecake Factory is always the best option when you have a large party! With their wide variety of menu options, it gives everyone a range of foods to eat."
Cassandra S.,"Tampa, FL",139,486,15,5.0,9/24/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised with our experience!  First of all, the only negative I would say is the parking at the mall.  It's insane.  Not sure what TCF is supposed to do to improve it, but give yourself at least 1/2 hour around dinner time, between traffic, finding a spot and then walking to the restaurant. The place was packed, but we happened to walk in right as a high top was leaving.  Awesome! Our server, Nathan P., was to the point and detail oriented, which was great.  My salmon was delicious.  My bf loved his buffalo chicken salad.  We were out of there in under an hour.  Overall great experience!"
Erika S.,"Gibsonton, FL",16,78,112,4.0,7/10/2017,Love coming to the cheesecake factory for happy hour. You have to be sitting in the bar area. They have a special menu that has drinks and small plates that are part of the happy hour. They have $5 mojitos and long islands and i love to order the guacamole and the happy hour burger. They both come with gluten free option.  I usually don't get the cheesecake but my favorite is the red velvet. Its soo good.
Heather S.,"Tampa, FL",38,80,91,5.0,6/24/2017,"Curb side review: We cautiously ordered take out as we have never had a good experience at other restaurants with take out. CF knocked it out of the park! They took care to present the food well and not just throw it in the container in a haphazard way. Presentation is key to set up the mind for a good bite and I cannot say enough how impressed we were. We ordered the meat loaf and bang-bang chicken and shrimp along with adam's peanut butter cheesecake and the new coffee cheesecake.  The entrees were delicious and a large portion neither of us could finish. The cheesecakes were fantastic and the packaging was impressive to have a texture on the bottom so it doesn't slide when eating it (I hate when things slide around in a take out dish!) For curb-side the order was ready in 20 minutes on a Saturday night during dinner rush. I pulled up and called the number on the sign. Food was ready and hot. Service was great! I know, I know how good can it be at my car? The waitress did little things that matter. Letting me know things were hot and to be mindful how close input the cheesecake to it, reminding me to take my cc once I signed the check and had some small talk.  We will for sure use CF again for a date night in"
Tim K.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",72,247,438,2.0,3/12/2017,"Tried the local CF w/a $25 gift card I received.  Nice ambiance - a bit loud, though. Sunday.  Busy.  Understandable. Sat at a recently vacated high-top in the bar for 10 min, didn't get bussed and then my beeper went off so I let them seat me. Ordered the Farfale with chicken and roasted garlic.  It was miss ordered, so I waited about 40 minutes for meal.  By the time it came I wasn't really hungry.   Even if I had been, the flavor wasn't great.  It's done in a cream sauce that lacked any real punch.  Plus, I struggled to find the chicken in the dish.  If I'm paying $17 for a meal there'd better be enough for leftovers. I was offered a salad while I waited for my meal to be fixed, but wasn't interested in salad.  When I received my bill there was no adjustment for the wait - I would have discounted the bill for the inconvenience. Won't be returning here for awhile - not worth the aggravation."
Richard L.,"Riverview, Tampa Bay, FL",43,14,32,5.0,11/16/2017,Brendan was our waiter & he was outstanding going above & beyond for us. He deserves the highest praise from us
Kitty J.,"Tampa, FL",0,20,32,4.0,7/16/2017,"I've eaten at this chain 100+ times in various cities over the past 10 years or so. It is, in fact, my favorite chain restaurant. Each location varies in quality and taste of food. Service is always good.  As a whole, this chain has a huge selection. There are some great dishes that have been on the menu for many years, like the Chicken Madeira (my favorite), Spinach and Artichoke Dip and Factory Nachos.  I've eaten at the Brandon, FL location and the food is good. Staff is great, very friendly, professional and attentive. I've never had any location, however, touch the quality and preparation of the food in the Baltimore Inner Harbor (Maryland)."
Dawn D.,"Atlanta, GA",4,82,84,4.0,1/19/2017,"This review is based on my my service and food. The decor are any Cheesecake Factory runs about the same. With exception of the external outside area, the greenery at this location is fit for a nice tropical night in Florida. I got there prior to 7pm, so I waited about 5 minutes for seating. My server, Barry came right over and took my order with kindness. About 20 minutes later, my fish tacos along with brocolli and braised carrots accompanied my meal.  Welp, the fish tacos were a hit, nice and hot. As was the brocolli, nice and hot. The carrots however were room temp at best. Not sure why they were not as hot OR barely hot, but I didn't make a fuss about it. Barry was very attentive and offered to replace my food. It was edible and wasn't entirely cold, just not hot. It wasn't an issue for me, so I declined. The Ambiance-A  The Meal-A  The Service-A+ [Barry is his name] It was good for the Cheesecake Factory."
Angelynn J.,"Lakeland, FL",94,161,343,5.0,6/22/2017,"Every time we come here we never have to wait and the service is always nice, the tables are always clean. All the food at Cheesecake Factory is so good. They never mess over our orders either. I love their strawberry lemonades and their lemon drops. It's my favorite restaurant."
Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1503,8670,4.0,10/14/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake a few time. Now officially give them a review. Sometimes I come here for dinner and sometimes is just the cheesecake. It easy to access since they are not too far from the parking lot.  The visit from the past is distance memory. But I will say about our current visit is easy just for the cheesecake. There were so many cheesecake to choose from. I was debating to have the tiramisu cheesecake, Chris outrageous cheesecake, mango key lime cheesecake. I went for the tiramisu. It was really good. Because the cheesecake are extremely fresh, I refuse to have them in the 4 degree overnight. I eat it all and left nothing.  Service is quick to order. They have added a flower whips Creme on the side. The box is special made for that condition."
Keith R.,"Dover, FL",49,72,76,4.0,5/10/2017,"We had Chicken Bellagio and Pit Beef Sandwich. A Baltimore Classic with Char- Roasted Beef with a superb Au jus and Horseradish sauce. It was the waiters first day he did very well. The Greek salad well it did have feta cheese and minced olives that was about as Greek as it got.  We did get seated at an ""out of the way place""  I nipped that in the bud right away I said I wanted another seat so we was seated properly. I hate being seated and forgotten."
De Ann R.,"Jacksonville, FL",34,118,137,4.0,8/26/2017,"We ordered the lettuce wraps and a egg roll sampler plate.  We were both craving desserts but after the appetizers we were full.  The lettuce wraps were fresh and good. Also, the firecracker salmon rolls were very good.  The service was ok.  I think our waitress was new; she was nice but not fast.  I really wanted some dessert but the next time I will get a slice cheesecake."
Nomie S.,"Lakeland, FL",91,51,64,4.0,11/17/2017,Happy hour is where it's at. Great choices delicious food and solid drinks. Service was a little slow but all in all good experience. Definitely will come back.
Niccole W.,"Kunigami District, Japan",75,74,67,2.0,9/13/2017,We met up with a couple of friends for dinner and drinks. We spent the majority of our time there in search of our missing server. The food arrived in parts and the plates were very hot from being left in the window. To be very I think the gentlemen that waited on us was just a bit too seasoned to keep of with the serving pace a restaurant like this typically has.
Catherine V.,"Riverview, FL",32,20,92,5.0,7/9/2017,"Gave this restaurant a second visit after my not so good experience last week. I was very happy with experience today, was seated in less than 5 minutes , seated on a perfect spot and the server was very kind and attentive. The food was still superb still ordered the same food I did last time. Been wanting to try something new but i cant help and wouldn't want to miss my chance to order my favorite Chicken Bellagio! and Baja chicken Tacos. All in all i give it a 5 star! nothing beats a good service and a good food! Thats what people come back for!  Made my day! now its time for wine"
Courtney B.,"Columbia, SC",30,30,33,4.0,10/4/2017,"The food was great and the service was good. The Cheesecake was the best part of the meal, rightfully so. The fried macaroni bites are a must have for any trip."
T C.,"Seffner, FL",12,303,676,4.0,8/9/2017,"We came by for lunch with a friend after shopping the mall. The restaurant was pretty empty as it was early. The host started to seat us then moved tables for another guest and then seated us. It was kind of strange.  We were greeted with a great waitress, very friendly and attentive. We had two hamburgers, Caesar salad with salmon and avocado toast. We all enjoyed our meals. I would have liked the French fries cooked more but my classic burger was large and tasted. The avocado toast was my daughters favorite. Caesar salad and salmon was good.    The restaurant was clean, we would come by again. We did think the prices for hamburgers and fries was a bit high."
Angel A.,"Lakeland, FL",15,44,35,2.0,11/11/2017,This place is consistently terrible.  I came here a while back and told myself I would not return but against my better judgement I returned.  It has been a while since I was last here so I figured maybe they haveChanged.  but no they haven't food is still bland and not hot when served.  Only reason they got 2 stars is because they're cheesecake is delicious and the service was good.
Izhak S.,"Riverview, FL",0,6,6,3.0,11/11/2017,"Went there yesterday for dinner with my daughter and grandkids. Wait time given to us was 30 minutes and we had to wait for 45 minutes and the place was really loud. The food was very good, but service was absolutely the worst. Our server didn't attend our table, we had to ask other servers to call him every time we needed. He had an attitude for every single thing we asked. I would probably be back there since the food was good, I hope that next time we will have a better server and the place won't be packed."
Jessica B.,"Bradenton, FL",16,50,106,3.0,8/17/2017,Nice place good local... Not to long of a wait . Food isn't bad...prices r ok I guess.
Melissa P.,"Tampa, FL",5,9,,5.0,8/16/2017,All I can say is YUM! Best meal i have eaten in a restaurant in quite some time.  Service was fast and extra courteous.
Chad P.,"Lakeland, FL",147,110,607,4.0,5/29/2016,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories around the country and they're all pretty much the same. They're all laid out the same, they all have the same food, and the staff is all trained the same. I mean, it's a chain restaurant so consistency is the name of the game.  One thing I like about this particular location is that it has outdoor seating; but it is Florida after all.  My particular visit was satisfying, but not perfect. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated when there was clearly plenty of empty tables, but whatever. The waitress was perfectly nice, though she didn't bring any plates out with the free bread. Lame. Turnaround time on our order was about average and my burger was closer to a medium-well than a medium, but it was still quite enjoyable. I will say the fries were excellent. My date got the eggroll sampler but only ate about half and they boxed it up no problem. So there's not much to say about this place. If you've been to one CF you've really been to them all."
Lisa M.,"Ruskin, FL",90,12,47,3.0,7/25/2017,"My husband & I ate at the Cheesecake factory last night. We both got a salad. I had the mini-greek...delicious! He had the Caesar salad...he enjoyed it. For our entree we had the Eggplant Parmesean w/angel hair that was tossed in a pesto sauce. It was...ok. It could been great but it lacked seasoning. I never use table salt. I had to last night to get through this dish, so did he. For dessert, I had the Mango Lime cheesecake....it was simply amazing! It had a sweet, but tart flavor that was balanced perfectly. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. If it hadn't been for the flop on the main course, I'd rate the meal a 5."
Ameena S.,"Tampa, FL",76,39,194,5.0,6/30/2017,Colin the manager was very nice and he made sure that I ate something with all my food allergies . He made my experience memorable. He was awesome !!!!!
Jeremy S.,"Gibsonton, FL",56,77,249,5.0,9/22/2016,"My wife and I come here all the time for their happy hour. I usually get the burger on their happy hour menu which has 2 patties and cheese on a bun with pickles and cabbage on the side if you like. I've also gotten the hot dog before which is very good as well and a pretty good-size which will definitely fill you up. Both cost just around $5 and for another couple bucks you can add fries to it. My wife got the thai rolls this time which she really loved with the peanut sauce that came with it. We generally share the guacamole and chips which is always fresh and you can make it spicy if you like. The drink specials are pretty good too, I usually get whatever craft brew they have on tap. This last time was a pint of Jai Alai for $3.25, but they do have a few 5$ cocktails as well, like the Mojito which is served with fresh mint leaves:-) If you can make it by 6pm on a weekday, make sure to ask the hostess for the happy hour menu!"
Latoya J.,"Cocoa, FL",72,41,127,4.0,9/3/2017,"Love the cheese cake factor. I been voming and getting my fav  for about 10 years. Tge crispy chicken costella. I also love the raspberry lemonade. Their cheessecaske is done of the best cheese cake I've ever had. The red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut And banana are amongst my fave"
Myk F.,"Tampa, FL",131,205,316,5.0,1/17/2017,"Im not a fan of chain restaurants and I probably wouldnt have gone here if my daughter hadnt picked it for us for her birthday dinner. All that being said we had a GREAT time and the server and manager helped me out with a little surprise for my daughters birthday. The service was great, the calamari was VERY good and my steak diane was very tasty and cooked to order. I still think there are too many menu items to be great at all of them, but the items we had were very good that night."
Alex R.,"Celebration, FL",583,227,1073,5.0,12/31/2016,"Damn, I wish I could stray from my favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory. Miso Salmon, probably the one dish that I can't stray away from when I go to Cheesecake Factory. It's like a love hate relationship. No matter how many times I go there, I go with this thought that I'll try something else. Ehhhh!!! Fail!!!!!! This is like that one girlfriend you keep coming back to but all your friends are like dude let it go there's others. (That's just an acronym) This dish is always cooked to perfection. With such an extensive menu I don't know how they keep shelling out such quality. I love Cheesecake Factory. If that's not endorsement I don't know what else can express my joy when I go there."
Stacia H.,"Brandon, FL",0,4,,1.0,8/3/2017,Do not order the buffalo blast! No chicken inside!  Please take off the menu! I received a lot of breaded chicken but that all it was.... Breading.  Such a disappointment!
Mindy M.,"Lakeland, FL",12,68,118,4.0,5/6/2016,"Never had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory.  The wait can be a witch at times.  I always request a booth.  The oat bread they give you while you wait is incredible and all of the entree's are huge.  You will definitely leave with a doggy bag. The only thing that bothers me about this restaurant is the layout.  I absolutely hate the bench seating, there is no intimacy.  It feels like a cafeteria to me. The wait staff is always attentive and quick to refill your drinks.  I always ask them to leave a menu on the table, because it takes me so long to figure out what dessert I want."
Keisha P.,"Brandon, FL",52,31,7,4.0,5/15/2017,Seriously one of my favorite places to eat! Their portions are huge...giving me lunch for work the next day. I love this restaurant and would definitely recommend it.
Luke B.,"Tampa, FL",112,8,11,4.0,1/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a fine example of a chain restaurant done right. As with most chain restaurants, a few details slide through the cracks, but mostly the Factory hits the mark. The staff is friendly, punctual and always ready to refill a water glass or sprinkle some Parmesan. We had two courses for our dinner, an appetizer and two entrees.  The appetizer was an interesting blend of West Coast healthy eating and Asian finger food: Avocado Spring rolls. I can say that they tasted like well-made guacamole (onions, tomatoes, the works) while their presentation (cut in half diagonally and served on a bed of crispy rice noodles) certainly put me in the mood to chow down. Can definitely recommend. For entrees, I had the Pasta Carbonara with chicken  while my friend had the Factory Chopped Salad. The pasta had a creamy, rich garlic Parmesan sauce that, I think, dried out into a thin glaze over the course of my meal. Overall, both it and the chicken were quite good, but nothing stellar.  I only had a few bites of the salad, but I can say it was a delectable menagerie of all sorts of flavors and textures: tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, bacon, bleu cheese and apple just to name a few. I can definitely recommend that dish. One issue left a little more to be desired: the silverware was very poorly washed. My knife had marks all up the blade and the rest of the silverware was only a little better.  Overall, I had a good experience and I can recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone looking for a healthy or hearty meal. If you want finer dining, there's plenty of other places to look, but Cheesecake Factory has the charm and the wherewithal for you to have a good night out."
Sina I.,"Tampa, FL",34,14,44,4.0,6/26/2016,"We loved the food, I got the mushroom burger and it came with a side of fries(or salad). My girl friend had cajun chicken and again it was excellent.  The only problem was the waiter who was in hurry to get order and bring the checks, simply he wasnt friendly. P.S. The place was too dark, honestly I had problem to see my food. You can check images, I didnt want to use flush so the images also became really bad ( my cellphone camera( Galaxy S7) is usually performing great in low light but it was too dark I guess) ."
Shreya C.,"Brickell, Miami, FL",239,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Though I did go on National Cheesecake day, I waited almost two hours for my slice. They misplaced my order and the friend I went with got her order before mine. The entire experience is a disaster. They have no sense of organization."
Hope L.,"Hollywood, FL",1102,6,7,2.0,4/3/2017,"Honestly my experience here was pretty much mediocre, probably wouldn't come back unless I really wanted Cheesecake. Took over 10 minutes just to get water on the table, food took 45+ minutes to come out on a Monday night, not very busy. Wanted to get Cheesecake to go and it took almost 20 minutes ordering at their to go counter. Food was good but not work the wait. Maybe go to a different location."
Gio U.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,5.0,10/9/2017,This place is very good and staff is friendly and the avocado toast is incredibly amazing
