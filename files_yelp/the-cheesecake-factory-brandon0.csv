K C.,"Ruskin, FL",7,52,5,3.0,1/10/2013,"Food at the Cheese Cake Factory is always good but as with many places today customer service is a hit or miss, today was a miss. Waiter was not the best and really stated to piss me off, enjoy your tip."
Mike S.,"Zephyrhills, FL",1,86,21,3.0,12/21/2013,"We go to this Cheesecake Factory at every special family event. We have always been pleased until today. We went during lunch which usually we always go at dinner time but same menu. Today the food just wasn't as good as usual. I had chicken an biscuit, basically chicken pot pie. I love it. Today it was just dry and the vegetables were terrible. Literally not cooked and hard as a rock. I was so disappointed. My wife wasn't impressed and my daughter had a chicken sandwich was horrible. By the time we leave we spend $121 that's food and cheesecake. We probably won't go again."
Jeff J.,"Tampa, FL",21,18,,4.0,12/20/2012,"Desserts to die for, food to take home as a second meal, and great atmosphere.  Cheesecake Factory never lets me down, no matter where you go.  Maybe one of these days we will actually go when they're having drink specials."
Inspector Y.,"Largo, FL",6,161,8,4.0,6/18/2012,"They only got 4 stars cause of the wait time, but other then that it's perfect.  The best is the pineapple upside down cheese cake...DAMN its good!"
Virginia G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",286,788,879,4.0,2/10/2010,"I love the beet and goat cheese salad here! Definitely a challange making a menu decision so we always start with the salad, a couple martinis and then decide. Hubby leans toward the steak sid eand has never been disappointed except for the flat irons teak which was pretty tough. Brunch is delicious and expansive and of course desserts are delicious!"
Kevin M.,"Avon Park, FL",0,19,6,5.0,7/27/2014,"Loved the Chicken Bellagio. Great breads and excellent waitress. I really wanted to try the desserts, but the entree left me too full."
Slow M.,"Dallas, TX",0,39,,1.0,1/28/2013,"Never ever again.  The bartender does not know how to make drinks.  I ordered a cocktail with 4 ingredients and it was terrible.  The Navajo sandwich I ordered was cold and the chicken was dry.  My side salad was ok, but a closer look at the cucumbers showed brown spotting on the skins.  Thanks for serving me bad produce.  This bad experience was enough for me to swear off Cheesecake Factory forever."
Jana C.,"Tallahassee, FL",106,117,7,5.0,1/20/2012,"I love this location. It's packed, but not as busy as most Cheesecake Factories are. I gave them 5 stars because of their service. The wait wasn't that long and they were nice enough to take back my food when I did not like it. Their menu is huge so basically I can always count of them to satisfy whatever I feel like eating at the moment. I never really order the cheesecakes though. I am always too full to order dessert."
Max B.,"Brandon, FL",3,3,6,5.0,3/6/2014,"This restaurant is amazing!! I really like the waiters, they are very polite and they dont rush u at all! :)"
LifeLover L.,"Bradenton, FL",3,52,,2.0,5/3/2013,"Whats all the fuss about? i havenever had stellar food here. and its always packed for some reason. The ever-present crowd makes me think that im missing out on something, so then i trick myself into waiting an hour to get seated. i have been to this location 4 times now.... not impressed"
Romain C.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,89,67,5.0,4/10/2013,"been to these all around the country. service was great, thanks to cody j. had the kobe burger with my preference of goat cheese. it was yummy and BANGIN'!"
Kay M.,"New Orleans, LA",76,116,52,5.0,2/24/2011,I have been to several Cheesecake Factories and this one definitely tops the charts! The food was sensational-- my boyfriend thought the stuffed mushrooms were the best he ever had. The new peanut butter cup cheesecake is sensational-- highly recommend!
Veronica T.,"Houston, TX",0,32,,3.0,10/23/2011,"I agree with the split reviews.  For me the good, excellent crab cakes.  Decent orange chicken and chinese salad. The bad- way too loud. Plus with the outside seating and service in and out, there always seem to be a lot of flies around the tables.  I hate bugs!!! Not my favorite local haunt."
Josh P.,"Tampa, FL",57,9,3,5.0,1/8/2011,"Love the Cheesecake Factory, always consistent with the food! Vast food selection and great atmosphere!"
Andrew M And Janice H.,"Seattle, WA",52,12,19,5.0,1/5/2010,"Excellent food, great service, one of our favorite restaurants. For the most part we prefer the mom and pop hole in the wall type restaurants, but you just can't go wrong with the Brandon Mall Cheesecake Factory. It has all the great qualities of the Tampa International location, without the long waits and loud crows. We dine there about ever 2 months and rarely wait more than 5 minutes for our party of 2. The Shepard's Pie and lousiana chicken pasta are our favorites. Extra chicken is only a few bucks more, so we usually order that and have awesome leftover the next day."
Meg B.,"Aiken, SC",5,58,2,2.0,1/28/2010,"I was excited when this location of The Cheesecake Factory was opened because all my friends were saying how great the location in International Mall was. I don't know if there is just a HUGE discrepancy between the cooks or what; but I was NOT impressed. My husband and I went awhile after it opened and ordered desserts (cheesecake for me, chocolate cake for him) and sodas and walked out with a $30 bill!! In addition to the huge bill the service was mediocre and the desserts were both not very good. I have had better cheesecake bought from the bakery at Publix for MUCH less money. The only redeeming factor was that the portions were large. We haven't been back."
Al D.,"Sun City Center, FL",0,19,,5.0,4/9/2013,"I and 2 friends had dinner at this location last night and it was great. The service was wonderful, (I can't remember her name) and the food was fantastic. I have eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before in California and made a special effort to go to this one to celebrate a special time. It was as good as I remember and I was very happy we went there. All 3 of us got pasta dishes and we all raved about them."
Patrick H.,"Brandon, FL",132,44,,5.0,5/13/2012,"Great chain.  Wide variety of food, Sunday Brunch, and this location is much better then the one near the airport at International.  I love the appetizers, and pretty much this is just a great place to eat.  Service is great, and for a slightly upscale chain this is the best in the area."
Therack T.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,4.0,5/22/2012,Staff is always very friendly every time I visit.  They have good Happy Hour Specials.  Always a good way to end a shopping trip at the mall.
Kristy J.,"Tampa, FL",1,11,2,4.0,9/10/2011,"I really like Cheesecake factory there is always a huge wait so we try to work around the busy times, but the food is really good. You also can get it to go if you are in a hurry. The floor is super slippery though and I almost bust my butt in heels everytime we go there. The staff is usually friendly and we choose a bunch of appetizers and share because they are so good  and for desert do the Godiva choc. cheesecake or the red velvet cake they are amazing!!"
