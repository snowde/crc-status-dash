Matthew P.,"Land O Lakes, FL",159,343,81,5.0,4/22/2014,Very nicely run restaurant! Good management makes a great team!!!! And they have a great team here!!!  You know what your going to get here and its the same as in the other locations! They are a better group in Brandon than the group at International Plaza that's for sure!!!!
Valerie T.,"Riverview, FL",0,18,1,2.0,11/7/2015,I was subjected to this restaurant again because my friend wanted to go. I tried to give it a chance without previous bias. But once again my expectations of mediocrity were failed. I knew the overpriced food was bland in taste and scarce in ingredients so I played it safe and ordered a Cuban sandwich. It tasted like nothing.  I thought last time I went there was maybe just an off night but once again I left this restaurant feeling ripped off and disappointed.
Robert L.,"Lakeland, FL",0,4,,5.0,11/29/2016,Really good service. Our waitress friendly and always kept our drinks full even though it was a long wait for food. The food was awesome and the cheesecake was out of the world!
Chris W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,49,4,4.0,4/27/2016,"Great outdoor seating, and a very relaxing interior ambience. The chicken marsala, seared tuna salad and beet salad are awesome. They have a great wine selection and the cheesecakes are amazing. Really great experience all around. Sometimes the servers are a little bit untrained, but with the ambience and the food being great I would still recommend the establishment."
Sally N.,"Ruskin, FL",33,17,111,5.0,4/26/2016,"Love the Thai wraps and the orange chicken. Cheesecake of course is the best- I give these 5 stars- love their orange chicken too, but not on the diet"
Kathy D.,"Randolph, MA",157,758,180,4.0,2/4/2015,Went here on a Thursday afternoon with 3 people.  Were seated right away.  Had a fantastic waitress.  Everything was served quickly.  Our food was delicious!  I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times in MA and the last few times were not so good.  So it was nice for this excellent visit!  I had chicken quesidillas and they were very good.  I defintely would go back again when we go back to Florida to visit!!
Ashley N.,"Greenville, SC",83,329,247,4.0,2/22/2014,"I went here for a late lunch with a friend and we decided to sit outside on the patio. The recently re-did the patio and it lookes really nice with the new overhang, lights and heaters for when it gets cold. Our server was the only one outside on the patio and I felt kinds bad for hime since we were his 5th or 6th table and they kept setting him. Some one came up and asked for our drink order but he had already gotten it.  For lunch we just got water to drink and then I ordered the Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread from the Skinny menu and my friend ordered the Asian Salad from the skinny menu. Someone dropped of bread and butter for us. The food came out promptly and was good. my flatbread was filling. My friend like here salad ok even thou the lettuce looked a little wilted. We split the tiramisu cheesecake for dessert and it was perfect! Overall its good but a chain restaurant so not a place I typically visit."
Leo M.,"Carrollwood, Tampa Bay, FL",9,20,25,5.0,10/17/2013,"If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know that the menu is a little overwhelming.  I have never had a bad experience here and I love the food.  The chicken samosas was espectacular!  It's very flavorful with a hint of curry and a cilantro dipping.  My burger was delicious !! My partner had the chicken madeira. He claims it was the same as always... YUMMY!    I would of tried it, but I'm not a fan of mushrooms."
Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",35,15,2,3.0,3/6/2016,"Decent for lunch and dinner.  Avoid brunch.  The pancakes are subpar and the syrup is watered down.  The outdoor seating is nice, so it depends what you are looking for in your outing."
Angelina D.,"Seffner, FL",32,59,80,3.0,2/7/2016,Samosa chicken was really good for app...my husband had some pasta w/shrimp and sausage he gives it an 8 out of 10..i had frozen mahi  mashed potatoes mmmm n bland broccoli ...however my red velvet cheesecake never fails n makes me happy
Keshia J.,"Tampa, FL",2,1,,1.0,9/19/2016,"Went to this location on a Friday night with a party of 18. Expected there to be a wait and had no problem waiting. We were quoted an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. After waiting our allotted time, we asked the hostess how much longer. She told us about 15 minutes. I was annoyed but we had already waited that long so what would 15 more minutes be. After 30 minutes went by, I asked to speak with a manager. The manager (Justin Fletcher) came and said it would be another 15 minutes. I asked him to explain why it was taking so long to get us seated and he stated there were 2 spots in the restaurant that he could put us but they were waiting on tables to leave before they sat us. I then asked why this was not communicated to us after we waited the hour and fifteen minutes, to this he had no answer. I said to him that we had already waited 2 hours and by the time our dinner would arrive to our table it would have been 3 hours that we hadn't eaten. To this his response was ""well we do have to cook the food."" That was the most disrespectful comment. It was then that I told him the party would not be eating here and asked for his name. At first he was reluctant to give it but once I informed him I would be contacting the corporate office he gave his name and this is when he offered to buy our party appetizers. I said no thank you we are done. Never was there an apology given. I felt extremely disrespected and will never eat at this establishment."
Morgan L.,"Brandon, FL",122,5,4,5.0,6/30/2015,"Our waiter Cimmeron was amazing. Very upbeat, polite, and informative. I ordered the lemon roasted chicken meal which was spectacular, probably the best chicken I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the 4 cheese pasta which he agreed was good as well. For dessert I got the toasted smores cheesecake which although a bit too rich was still very good especially with the toasted marshmallow and graham cracker."
Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,269,3.0,3/21/2013,"I can't ever complain about food with Cheesecake Factory.  Not to mention this is the second location in the Tampa area so you don't have to go too far no matter where you are to find one.   The menu continues to amaze me every time I come here and leave me indecisive until a game time decision has to be made.  The location is great for a mall eatery and wait times every time I have gone have been bearable.   My only gripe on the couple of times I have visited this location has been the speed and quality of service.  It seems as though the lunch staff doesn't necessarily understand many of its lunchtime customers are on lunch breaks and do have to head back to work.  On my most recent visit I think our group only saw the waiter 3 times.  Once about ten minutes after we were seated to get drink orders, then to get food orders, and lastly when it was time for the check."
Travis T.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",0,18,,5.0,3/28/2016,"Great spot for a nice lunch or dinner, food and service is always wonderful, we also go in just to take a slice or two of cheesecake home."
Paul E.,United Kingdom,9,50,2,4.0,9/2/2014,"Fantastic. Huge menu. Huge portions. Friendly staff. Great food. A bit pricey, though."
Steve W.,"Tampa, FL",3,4,,2.0,1/2/2016,"Service was very slow and food was sub-par.  Really disappointed with my visit this time around.  Will eat here again, however, this is a definite strike against.  Hope they bring their A game next time"
Steven L.,"Manhattan, NY",1217,662,3742,3.0,10/29/2012,"Wait can be busy if it's on hot days like end of the week and weekends. Service is great, but sometimes hard to get their attention if they're running around and if they're not looking in your direction. Food is average and nothing to wow about, however presentation is great. Can't go wrong with a slice of cheesecake in the end!"
D D.,"Tampa, FL",9,84,60,1.0,11/15/2015,"Very disappointed! Came for brunch....server was blah, service was slow, food was gross."
Kim E.,"Tampa, FL",2,20,,5.0,12/16/2014,Simply the best cheesecake ever! It is amazing. Dinner was good too but even sharing an entree with  my husband we struggled it finish our dessert. Next time it's just the cake!
Janel V.,"Riverview, FL",1,25,2,5.0,1/25/2015,"Quick seating on a late Saturday afternoon so that was awesome. The service... Amazing! The food was delicious. Wow.... Just wooooow. Amazing food. The flavors and the quality is amazing. Gorgeous place and the ambiance is amazing. A little over priced in my opinion so be prepared to spend some money.  FYI: The red sangria, better than any I have ever had. Delicious!!!!!!"
