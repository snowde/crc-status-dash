Katy S.,"Tampa, FL",451,986,582,4.0,4/14/2013,"I am a fan, especially now that they have the Skinnylicious menu.  My biggest prior hang up at Cheesecake Factory was the size of the portions and the undisclosed calories.  This has totally changed and now they have a gigantic menu full of delicious and healthy options! After enjoying my healthy meal, I like to totally ruin it by going with either the Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake or the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake.  Both decadent and delicious.  Cheesecake Factory always delivers excellent service and food with a large and diverse menu!"
Donald W.,"Tampa, FL",115,70,129,5.0,12/6/2014,Great for a night out with family or out on your first date. Pretty impressive brother.
Nick A.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,26,3,2.0,6/20/2014,"Don't get me wrong I love The Cheese Cake Factory and their food, however, I'm writing the review more specifically for this specific location and their employees. My colleagues and I were in Brandon for business and decided to do lunch here. The wait wasn't too bad and we were seated in the corner of the store next to the silverware guy who rolls the silverware. (First red flag) Our waiter approached us and we ordered, he came back with our drinks and then disappeared. We saw him literally that one and only time. He wasn't busy because his other tables were being treated to, but we were left to nothing. Our drinks were empty and we kept trying to wave him down at his other tables, so I walked up to the nearest hostess and asked to flag him down for us, she said ""no problem I'll get him."" Yeah he never showed up, and someone else served our food. The food was mediocre at best. We felt pretty ignored and used as customers, and for what? Frustration."
Shawn W.,"Merritt Island, FL",20,126,17,4.0,5/30/2015,"I went here with my girl because she had NEVER been to the Cheesecake Factory.... the more I thought about that notion the more I feel like that was probably my fault.....so here we are!! The food was really good. As usual, large portions and way hard to finish. She's a cheesecake snob so we had to try some of that before leaving...it was phenomenal, just like you would expect it to be. Our waitress was very pleasant and our wait for the food was not nearly as long as I have experience at other CCF in the past. Overall, good place. I'll go again."
Elena M.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,130,259,4.0,9/13/2015,Menu too big however the cheesecakes never disappoint.. Food is fancy microwaveable stuff not bad but I could probably pick up the same food at the frozen section at Costco.
Bobby M.,"Riverview, FL",0,7,2,5.0,7/1/2014,Love this place!! They have no issues with making food not on menu. If I eat at the one in Brandon or Chicago the quality is the same. The first time we ate at one my son was home on leave with his new wife. So it holds a special place in life
M W.,"Largo, FL",0,6,,4.0,1/24/2016,"I've never had a problem with the food or service at multiple locations. Depends on the time of day for high wait times. Pretty tasty food and something for everyone from the miso salmon to the mac and cheese burger. The highlight of course is the many varieties of cheesecake which do not disappoint, very generous serving that can be split into two because it's ultra rich."
Marion M.,"Lakeland, FL",0,133,,5.0,8/29/2015,"Ate at Cheesecake Factory yesterday and it it always good no matter what you order. Service, selection and decor is the best. The special cheesecake was Sea Salt Caramel and it was awesome ."
Nicole Leigh S.,"Tampa, FL",376,221,262,4.0,12/20/2011,"Since my recent switch to vegetarianism (with a strong mind to go vegan) I haven't been going out a whole lot, but every now and again it's kind of nice to have a sit down meal with a good friend. This past Sunday I was invited to the Cheesecake Factory for some brunch. I had never looked at the menu with the vegetarian filter and let me tell you it wasn't particularly easy. Now, the Sunday brunch menu is navigate-able (yes, I'm making up words) when it comes to meatless options- but there's a lot of cheese/milk products and eggs everywhere. I decided not to get breakfast and ended up settling on the new Skinnylicious Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread and it was (not surprisingly) delicious! At under 490 calories it was a great mid-morning breakfast/early afternoon lunch treat and at only $5.99 it really topped the charts. Laura, my friend, went with the Bourbon Street Omelette with a side of tomatoes and a bagel. Obviously it had a little (read: a lot) more meat than I was looking for, but she said she really enjoyed it. I don't remember what hers cost, but the whole breakfasty list was relatively low cost. Coffee was two thumbs up and service was lazily relaxing. Not that he wasn't a good server, mind you, he just wasn't rushing us and on a Sunday morning I appreciated that. I would definitely look to trying out more of the selection, but I fear my diary-less diet may get in the way going forward. Either way- I'll keep you posted!"
Yohanis C.,"Apollo Beach, FL",79,83,95,2.0,5/17/2015,"It could be such a great place if they did not try so hard to be creative. Less is always more! I do not understand why most restaurant experiment with mixing so many ingredients in one plate instead of keeping it simple. I must say, I love their kale and quinoa salad, and that's about it. The service is good but the food is just too much and low quality, trying to please huge appetites. Too pricey for its quality."
Sirius Q.,"Schenectady, NY",8,114,614,3.0,5/26/2015,The relaxed ambience is ideal for families.  The food are generous portion sizes and prepared consistently based on my dining experience at this location.  This location gets busy a lot.
Kristi P.,"Brandon, FL",116,121,71,2.0,5/26/2015,"No, just no. I've been here before and outbox convenience, I ended up back. The menu although huge seems to never seems to deliver anything worth consuming. We got the pretzel covered chicken skewers which were the best thing we ate. My date got the steak dip sandwich and I got a chicken sandwich. I've never seen my guy leave much food on his plate. He barely made it through half of his sandwich. I have to remember not to do this again, no mater how much of a convinence it is."
Auyanna G.,"Brandon, FL",29,164,221,4.0,3/17/2014,I appreciate that even on busy days the staff is always polite and really move as quickly as possible for tables. Food is consistently good regardless of how busy they are which is a plus. My favorite dish is the Chicken Ballagio. The chicken is pan fried until it's nice and crispy then topped with prosciutto which adds the perfect amount of saltiness. It's served with basil pesto noodles and parmesean sauce. It is sooo good. I always have plenty for lunch the next day! I don't need to tell you how fan-freakin-tastic the cheesecake is. Can't leave without a slice of the carrot cake cheesecake. #foodgasm
Joseph R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,24,9,1.0,7/3/2015,"Either the brandon location is an anomaly, or the company has committed to sucking. Three waiters...no fried macaroni balls...and food so bland i gave up on it and sent it back. At least the lemonade and bread were delicious. Never again."
Diana K.,"Sun City Center, FL",69,87,166,5.0,5/23/2015,Very good service and food. We only waited a couple of minutes to be seated. They say us next a window which nice to see people walking by. The food was very delicious and hot. I will definitely eat here again. It worth every penny.
Teri C.,"Greenville, MS",17,14,8,5.0,10/31/2013,Great place food is awesome as well as the service!! Thai Lettuce Wrap was very good along with our cheesecake!! Great Food!! Great Service!! Great People!!!
Ms Fab J R.,"Orlando, FL",93,245,47,4.0,3/25/2015,"Most people don't realize the bar high tops are first come first serve. Why be on a waiting list? I love their pastas, and salads.  They have every cheesecake imaginable.  I tried the raspberry white chocolate one and went to heaven. I love this place. Great server."
Joseph A.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",0,14,,5.0,5/9/2016,"Went for Mother's Day yesterday and had a great experience! Wait was a little long but expected. Waitress was great, food was delicious and hot. Had a great time!"
Eloy C.,"Brandon, FL",91,13,25,5.0,5/10/2015,I love this place always a wait but worth the wait trust me .... Love the Italian sandwich OMG it's great !!!! I also had the l snickers cheesecake
Thomas P.,"Valrico, FL",2,17,15,3.0,9/30/2014,Came in for a late dinner with the family.  Service was fast and food came quick.  The menu was large and offered a wide variety of choices.  The big turn off and the reason for the three star rating was due to the dirty silverware.
