Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,4.0,10/16/2014,"After being disappointed at the Cheesecake Factory in International Mall/Bay Street I decided to try this location in the BRANDON Town Center Mall.It's located off the Interstate 75 off of West BRANDON Blvd across the street from a Best Buy and in a humongous plaza behind the mall.This location tends to get packed it was full of people waited almost an hour but we finally got our table after waiting so long that's my only complaint.But other than that everything else is fine.Our waitress Melissa was really nice,attentive and very welcoming.Service is great especially when it's a madhouse.My Classic Burger with fries was amazing that day and my S'mores Cheesecake was absolutely delicious and this time the women's bathroom was clean I love that overall great experience"
Natasha P.,"Tampa, FL",98,208,163,4.0,12/21/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, very well organized chain restaurant. The menu can be a bit over whelming because there are so many to choose from which makes it difficult to order especially if you are trying to eat something different from previous visit. For my last visit service was just ok. My group 5 and were probable the first to arrive when opened for lunch but some how took us a while to start our meal not including the 15 minutes it took us to make up our minds on what to eat. I had the slimlicious turkey avocado sandwich and that just perfectly delicious. I would eat that again for sure."
Char C.,"Lithonia, GA",0,3,1,4.0,4/10/2015,"Visiting from Atlanta and again Cheesecake Factory maintains their quality in atmosphere, service and of coarse  food. My family was happy, comfortable and satisfied. We had a long day at Busch Gardens and I'm glad we stuck with our ace in the hole...we arrived a few mins before 5 and that was perfect timing because on our way out there was a short wait beginning to build. Thanks cheesecake factory for your dependability.."
Coralee H.,"Tampa, FL",0,9,,4.0,7/21/2015,"The missing star is due to the noise factor.  I am deaf, yet I could hear the ""sound track"".  I think most folks are happy with ""thumpa thumpa thumpa while dining.. me? not so much.  Our server DeAnne was professional, we enjoyed chatting with her.  I was surprised to note name tags are not part of the servers uniform.  Substitutions are permitted without charge  I was able to have the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp with Shrimp only. The seasonings are dumbed down for the American palate, which is to be expected. The portions are overwhelming for a senior citizen, go boxes are cheerfully provided.  The chain appears to have responded to criticism regarding the high caloric content of their offerings. They now include some lower calorie choices.  This was my first experience with the Cheesecake Factory. I can understand why it has maintained its good reputation."
Aimee B.,"Austin, TX",226,185,49,2.0,7/31/2011,"I almost want to write two separate reviews, but I guess it's better to just have the good and the bad in one place. THE GOOD: My friend and I walked into Cheesecake at prime dinner time on a Friday night. There was a huge line, and of course, the place was packed. However, we were able to snag seats at the bar (why don't people like to eat there with no wait?!). We ordered two drinks, mine a mojito. It was very good. Not authentic, but tasty nevertheless, and the bartender did not skimp on the rum. The service was friendly, prompt, helpful, and great. They deserve 5 stars alone. THE BAD: The food was so terrible. I ordered the fish tacos and I just can't begin to describe how disgusted I was. The fish was fishy (which any seafood fanatic would know that is not a sign of fresh fish...) and the toppings were just out of control, and tasteless. The flavors were not very good, and the soft taco shells tore before I could even pick them up. I ate what I could of them, but wound up eating more bread than anything else. The rice and beans on the side were also disappointing, but I think that was more a personal preference than the actual preparation. It was yellow rice with sweet corn and peas (do not want sweet rice...) and black beans. Not very appealing. Overall, I would probably come back again eventually, but probably just for an appetizer and drinks at the bar."
Hong N.,"Jacksonville, FL",241,115,133,5.0,10/20/2013,Recently went for a.friend birthday. The easier was really sweet. Food was good too. I always get my favorite chipolet pasta and avocado rolls. So good!!
Kristen C.,"Riverview, FL",46,100,18,4.0,4/18/2013,"I enjoy dining at the Cheesecake Factory mainly because of it's cheesecake.  The Pros: The variety of cheesecake flavors available-- no matter what you are in the mood for you are guaranteed to find at least one that sounds good! The atmophere is nice- you can sit inside or outside and it's very clean and classy but you can also  dress casual and fit in just fine.  The staff is always polite and professional.  Prices are relatively reasonable for what you get. Cons: The wait time tends to be long as peak hours so unless you go on an ""off time"" expect to wait.  I think the thing I dislike the most is the way the seating is arranged.  I don't like ot be seated so closely to strangers when I am trying to enjoy dinner and conversation.  And if you are dining for two this is bound to happen.  I am disappointed they took the crab cake sandwiches and the chicken and dumplings off of the menu!  Both: The HUGE menu- this is good and bad... it can be hard ot decide what you want with so many options! But it is good because again, no matter your mood you should be able to find a food you are craving."
Katie W.,"Berkeley, CA",15,12,,4.0,1/3/2014,"Ordinarily I wouldn't bother writing a review for a chain, but I had to comment on the exceptional service here.  Our waitress was kind, patient, and informative. Really great. As for food, I always love trying a couple tapas and appetizers. The pretzel crusted chicken is delicious, and the chicken samosas were pretty good too.  Main meal portions are huge, so expect to have leftovers.  Four stars because it's just a tad too pricey."
Stephen H.,"Pensacola, FL",3,19,,3.0,5/16/2015,"The food is a 3 at best. Soggy fries and stale bread make the sandwiches subpar. The cheesecake saves the score hands down. 5 star cheesecake, 2 star food, and 3 star service. Tourist trap, but still worth the trip once in a while."
Sarah B.,"Tampa, FL",231,233,282,3.0,6/30/2014,"I always feel 'eh' about Cheesecake Factory. I feel like I'm always in there for a longest possible time and I hate that the menu is ridiculously long. This particular cheesecake factory has always had great service and hasn't disappointed me yet. I like that they have a ""skinny"" menu with just as many options as the main menu. My biggest gripe with Cheesecake Factory is that they don't offer ""bites"" or ""samplers'"" of their cheesecakes. There is no way I ever order dessert because there is no way I can or want to eat an entire piece of that cheesecake."
Timothy C.,"Riverview, FL",8,46,1,5.0,5/11/2015,All I can say is awesome. The service was great. We had the fried mac and cheese was great. Then we had the Cuban sandwiches and by far they are the we have had. I never thought I'd say someone has a better Cuban than morainis but they do. We loved this place.
Anthony M.,"New Port Richey, FL",33,164,15,2.0,3/13/2013,"Although I never had a great meal at any CF, I stopped at the one in Brandon on lunch.  This was a giant fiasco, where the entire order was wrong...the manager came over to apologize and said a replacement order was being baked...20 minutes later he came back to say it hadn't been started and asked if I still wanted it.  Most of my co-workers had finished eating. The waitress offered a free cheesecake that she would bring right away. She asked if I wanted whipped cream on it and I told her no.  Of course, it came out with extra whipped cream on the side.  My co- workers joked about it and said they would probably charge for it.  The bill came with my meal and the cheesecake.  They removed the cheesecake after talking to the manager for the fifth time. The manager admitted that nothing had gone well that day and offered a gift card.  I still have it if anyone wants to eat there."
Philay D.,"Riverview, FL",33,75,40,4.0,10/27/2013,"I love this place!!!!!! I love my Thai lettuce wraps. Delish!!!!!! Can eat it everyday ... If I can afford it. The only thing I don't like is that their silverware is always dirty and sometime not wrap up and they just place it on the table. That is the worst part but everything else, is outstanding."
Joe M.,"Dunedin, FL",7,19,5,3.0,2/20/2015,"If you are a walk in be prepared for 40 min wait. Call ahead..the bread was delicious,  and had the mac and cheeseburger. Cooked to order, but could only taste all spice that coated the top of the burger. The waiter was attentive. Maybe next time my burger will be better."
Avery K.,"Tampa, FL",1,96,4,3.0,12/19/2015,"I have to say that I was disappointed with my latest trip to the Cheesecake Factory. Our server was nice enough, but he forgot my beef for ageless, I was hoping to sip on it while waiting for our food, but I didn't get it until a bit before the food came. For a beer that cost $7 (which would normally cost $6 for a 6 pack in the store), I expect it to at least be served on time, or comped. We also asked for some sauce which also took ages to arrive."
Ronald T.,"Plant City, FL",125,27,9,5.0,11/16/2013,"Great place! Good atmosphere, service is always outstanding, the friendly and congenial waitstaff keep us coming back."
Jason H.,"Tampa, FL",3,11,3,1.0,6/6/2014,I had a terrible experience with a hostess at this location. We utilized call ahead seating which I understand is not a reservation but we wanted them to know that a party of 10 was coming with a baby in a stroller. It was a Thursday night and we ended up watching parties of customers (2 to 4 people per party) be seated ahead of us. My wife went up after 20 minutes to check on how much longer and she was told only about 10 more minutes. After another 25 minutes I had lost my patience. The hostess was smug and after I asked for a manager she would not answer any questions I had while we waited for the manager. I would have walked out at this point but my neices and nephew really wanted to eat there. My brother and his kids were visiting from out of town. We had not seen them in almost a year. A weak hostess on a non busy night will hurt the customer experience. This night it did.
LaTosha J.,"Plant City, FL",2,4,,5.0,3/11/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat. date have this Cajun pasta with spinach pasta and regular pasta mix with shrimp and chicken a little spice oh my god. on my birthday I get that dish and I  go to the Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times a month.
Bonita B.,"Tampa, FL",47,299,172,3.0,1/10/2013,"The food was okay usual; however, the server was not attentive until it was time for us to pay the bill and receive a tip. Due to the poor customer service of our waiter, we did not order a dessert and we reflected our appreciation via the tip.  Note we visited the restaurant during non-peak hours - there were many vacant tables so the waiter was not busy or overworked since there were not may people sitting in our area.  One other thing... On the day we visited, the restaurant was cooler than the outside, the temperature outside was 66 and raining (brrrr). Next time I plan to wear a winter coat into this restaurant."
Dora B.,"Seffner, FL",2,52,,5.0,6/17/2014,"Two friends and I decided on impulse to grab dinner here on a Friday night around 9PM. It was my first time there, and it was so busy I thought we'd never get seated, but within ten minutes (we were told it would be twenty) we had a booth. Our waitress, Sam, was awesome. She was attentive, patient, friendly, and professional... we were very impressed when she came back to tell us one of our appetizers would be briefly delayed because she ""didn't think the one they made looked quite perfect"" and asked the kitchen to remake it. Even though the place was extremely busy, we never had to wait for drink refills or anything, and the bar even remade a drink without complaint when my friend decided she wanted something different.  Everything was absolutely delicious... we had fried calamari, avocado spring rolls, fire roasted spinach dip, and firecracker shrimp. The appetizer plates were more than big enough for all of us to split! I was really impressed with how much I loved the avocado spring rolls... and I don't even like avocado much! The drinks we had, which were all mojitos, were absolutely amazing, flavorful and fresh, and I have to compliment the bartender for making them because I know how busy she was and how time consuming they are.  I can't believe how well we were treated, and how quickly, on a night when the restaurant was clearly so busy. We will absolutely be back here again!"
