Michael B.,"Lutz, FL",1,9,10,5.0,2/16/2015,Great service even when they made a mistake they owned it and we Felt as though we were the first priority
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",365,306,155,4.0,3/20/2011,"3.75 stars Can't say that I've ever had great service at a Cheesecake Factory and that's the one thing that keeps me from frequenting more. It's a huge chain that is known for it's cheesecake and its super diverse menu.  However diverse the food items are, everything on the menu is always really good. It doesn't matter what you order, they do a pretty good job of mastering a lot of genres. I had the Grilled Salmon which was cooked perfectly and it came with a heaping side of Mashed Potatoes (which were delicious) and some Asparagus (cooked perfectly). Someone else ordered the Burger (looked good!) and Fries (crispy and yummy), another, Shepard's Pie (HUGE and tasty) and a Grilled Chicken and Spinach (also perfect). This place is good for kids as the options are plentiful and the plate sizes are""just right"". My 82 year old Puerto Rican grandma ordered off of the kid's menu and said her Grilled Chicken and Mashed Potatoes were ""Berry goodt and no too salt!"" Although we were seated right away, we unfortunately got seated near a birthday party table of 15 people which used up like 6 servers, including ours. We weren't greeted for 15 minutes, were never checked up upon, had to flag our server down for every little thing and waited forever for our check. As I said, it's the service that keeps me away because the food is always tasty. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt b/c we went on St. Patrick's day so they were probably unusually busy. Prices are on the high side depending on what you order, $19.99 for Salmon, $8.95 for the Burger.  Go with a lot of time and an apetite, portions sizes are huge. Don't forget to save room for the cheesecake!"
Josiah G.,"Tampa, FL",405,405,29,4.0,7/6/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains I give credit for doing things right. The service is usually good, the food from the ridiculously large menu is always on point and the drinks are made well. Chains seem to get away with serving weak drinks, but mine are always good here. With that, and a menu so big you could order something different every visit forever, I'll find myself here a few times a year. Both this Brandon Mall location and the International Mall location have consistent food, service and drinks."
Rachel M.,"Parrish, FL",0,21,4,5.0,11/8/2014,"My husband and I sat down at a horrible restaurant this afternoon, and immediately left and went to somewhere we know wouldn't disappoint. Cheesecake Factory has always shown us great service and food. Our server, Laura was so nice, and very knowledgable of the menu. She was quick to answer questions and make suggestions. I'm so glad we didn't stay at the previous place, because we ended up having a great time at CCF!"
Zoe H.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",2,18,5,4.0,9/3/2013,"Great food, but lets be real you only come here for the amazing cheesecake! It is so hard to choose from because of the ridiculous amount of delicious choices and flavors. It can be a little pricey but well worth the splurge every once in a while! Great girls night spot!"
Blake R.,"Orlando, FL",188,55,7,5.0,8/6/2014,"Let me start by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. When we arrived at the restaurant around 7pm, it was quite hectic and busy per usual. However, the bar area was pretty quiet and some tables were open, so we decided to sit at the bar and avoid the wait. I had the Chicken Madeira, which was recommended by our waitress, and it has easily become one of my favorite dishes now as it was so delicious. Customer service was impeccable. Our glass was never empty and were were tended to almost as soon as we sat down. Excellent location all around!!"
Bruce M.,"Tampa, FL",1,40,1,3.0,8/20/2014,"Had lunch here with wife, not bad. Service is soso food is avg for a chain restaurant. Dont get me wrong its good and clean. I would go back"
David Z.,"Sebring, FL",0,6,,2.0,2/15/2014,"Came here for lunch right at noon, ordered steak & salmon, wife ordered steak & shrimp.  When we got our food it was barely warm as if it had been sitting out for 5-8 minutes.  I pet the waitress know & she took both back.  Upon being brought back mine was the same, wife's shrimp was warm, but that was it.  I saw the manager & let him know again.  He apologized, offered another dish, but I declined.  This was my 1st visit to this Cheesecake location.  The waitress was good, but something was not right in the expediting/checking of food before leaving the kitchen.  We did not have to pay for our meal, which was nice.  Might return, not sure."
P O.,"Riverview, FL",2,40,12,4.0,3/25/2014,"I've always been a fan and I'm glad to see that no matter what location I go to, I can expect similar service.  I enjoyed eating on the outside patio, it felt a little more spacious than it usually does inside.  I love chicken salad so I went with the skinny chicken salad sandwich, my reliable choice for a sensible meal.  The salad that comes with it is ok.  The crispy cuban rolls were pretty good.  The strawberry lemonade is a little sweet for me but might be just right to someone else.  My server was wonderful, as usual.  I didn't get cheesecake this time but it's always a treat, never met a cheesecake here that I didn't like!"
Dan S.,"Apollo Beach, FL",0,29,8,1.0,10/8/2014,"Food and service are both pretty good. Somewhat pricey. Location is easy to find, but parking can be very difficult weekend nights.  The reason for the low rating is they took off the Moroccan Chicken from their menu. It was the reason I went to Cheesecake Factory. On top of that, they didn't tell me they didn't have it until after they took my order and came back to tell me they don't serve it anymore."
Madison S.,"Tampa, FL",0,21,5,2.0,3/14/2015,"I have simply lost faith in the quality of the service at this restaurant. My family and I came to celebrate my nephew's 14th birthday. We arrived at 6 PM and we were informed that it would be an hour and a half wait. The hostess asked us to leave the restaurant and walk around and return in an hour for a pager. She took my cell phone number, and said she would call if she couldn't find us. Half of the party went shopping and the rest waited in the restaurant. At 6:43, she called my cell phone, but I didn't have a signal in the mall. At 6:45 my mother requested the pager and the hostess didn't mention she had just called us. The shopping group returned at 7 and sat waiting with the rest of the party. My brother-in-law asked the hostess about the wait time at 7:30 and he was informed that she had already called us and it would be another 20 minutes. I spoke with the manager who said he would seat us, but nothing happened. We were finally paged at 7:45 and seated. Everyone had good food, except for my sausage and ricotta flatbread, which had burnt sausage on it and it wasn't sliced. By this time, I felt it was useless to complain. We sat at the table for 2 hours and also ordered desserts. Drinks were never refilled and plates were never cleared. I'm very upset that this will be the birthday celebration my nephew remembers for his 14th birthday."
Barbara C.,"Riverview, FL",86,109,459,3.0,4/7/2014,I love coming to Cheesecake Factory because the food is always good.  I Went here for Sunday Brunch yesterday and had the creme brûlée French toast with Ham. The ham was dry it had been on the stove a tad bit to long.  The creme brûlée French toast tasted like regular French toast.  This really surprised me because everything I have is usually great!  My mimosa was excellent and the service was wonderful!
Melissa J.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,20,2,4.0,9/23/2015,best lemon drop martini ever food ok great cheesecake.
Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1,3,,1.0,9/22/2014,The service was poor. The table and silverware were dirty. It took over 2.5 hours to have our lunch served. I will not be going back.
Steve R.,"Weymouth, United Kingdom",0,10,2,4.0,9/4/2014,"The food and service was excellent. Portions were generous and very filling. The menu choice was huge, not sure if this is a good thing or not. The restaurant is very large with plenty of seating so unless you visit at a really busy time getting  a seat should not be a problem.  The only bad thing I can say is that the lighting is a little on the dim side, ideal for a romantic couple but not for a large family meal. This was my first visit to this restaurant chain but I would definitely visit again in the future."
Sharina J.,Metro Detroit,213,272,171,4.0,9/19/2013,"I was super excited when I learned that my temporary home in Florida was only a mile down the road from the Cheesecake Factory.  You know who wasn't happy?  My weight watchers team leader!  I've tried my best to stay out of this fine establishment and I have not once gotten the cheesecake (yet).  I actually like their food and lunch specials.  Whenever you need a good comfort food I would suggest the white chicken chili!  The restaurant is definitely wheelchair accessible, bathroom, table seating and all."
Cathie D.,"Tampa, FL",112,171,3,4.0,3/17/2014,"Ok, so it's a chain & the menu is a bit overwhelming, but it's a great ""go to"" place when you can't think of another place to go!  This particular location is always crowded, but the wait usually not awful!  The outside patios are really nice to sit out on after they covered them!  Service is always great!  I love, love, love the Thai lettuce wraps & the avocado rolls!  The cheesecakes are all great, but sort of pricey!  They need to get some more beers on draft!"
Donna M.,"Thonotosassa, FL",14,158,3,4.0,6/22/2015,"Well, who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory????  The only thing I don't like is the menu is so big that it takes me forever to figure out what I want to order.  It is best to go at an off time since the location makes it very busy at noon and dinner time.  If you are like me, I sometimes throw the diet to the wind and just order one of the fabulous deserts.  Again, if you are in a hurry, I would say try to schedule your visit at an off time."
Melissa M.,"Tampa, FL",140,385,209,4.0,1/10/2014,"This location is close to work so an easy stand-by. Frou-frou drinks are good but pricy. Options for beer are limited. The menu however, is massive. Even for a huge restaurant with high volume, they are very accommodating. The orange chicken is awesome but not healthy. They have made it with grilled chicken for me and loaded up on veggies in place of rice. Have to make room for cheesecake calories!"
Mario C.,"Lithia, Tampa Bay, FL",28,59,43,4.0,8/23/2013,"Ok, so the Thai style shrimp appetizer does NOT stack up to the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish, but you just can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes!!!"
