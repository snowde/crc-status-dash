Francesco C.,"Sarasota, FL",2046,176,345,4.0,1/21/2013,"Coming to a popular American Icon, I promised myself not to be too critical to a place in which the name of the business describes as to sell, just multiple variety of ""cheese cakes."" However, when I walked up to the restaurant, I was already in awe with the colorful and fancy outdoor decor and art deco type of building.  So my curiosity had increased to try something new.  Walking in I noticed the long line just to add in their names in a large service book and in hope to be called soon.  While waiting I took a menu and glanced through it to find 6 full pages (12 counting both sides) of food items and only one and a half of cheese cake pictures and variety with their description.  Now, I was stuck to chose.  I had no idea it would have so much to gander.  When I was finally called and sat in a square table, I ordered a sweet drink, the Raspberry Lemonade, my girl friend ordered a Mint Tea.  Soon after they brought out our drinks, warm white bread and pumpernickel bread with butter was given while trying to decide.  Of course, I had to try to convince my 115 lb friend not to read from the ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and actually get some grub.! Finally and surprisingly she agreed and decided on a ""Chicken Piccata"" and I order also from the chicken coup, I ordered a ""Crusted Chicken Romano."" Crusted Chicken Romano was great to the taste, chicken was cut like fillets and tender and breaded nicely, although this was a lunch date, the portion was perfect in size.  Came with Angel Hair pasta with marinara sauce.  On her plate, I found it a little better tasting with creamy lemon sauce dressed with mushrooms and capers, had plenty of shrooms on top and her cut was similar to mine and very tender. Hers also came with angel hair pasta in the same mushrooms lemon sauce sauce.  Food was good!  Finally we ordered the sinner!  A huge piece of Oreo Cheesecake!!  Wow!  Rich and more rich, but great tasting and it marbleized my stomach!  I love this place!  Only thing I seen that was cumbersome, is the seating, all in tight arrangements, do not expect a romantic dinner nor privacy!!  You are facing neighbors and they can see you play footsie!"
Diane C.,"Naples, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/7/2014,"BEWARE if you eat Gluten Free! Upon being seated I requested  GF MENU from the hostess.  After waiting ten minutes with no menu, I resorted to walking to the hostess stand to get it myself.   I ordered gluten free pasta.  The menu specifically said that the GF pasta was fussilli.  When penne pasta arrived I questioned whether it was gluten free-and Thankfully(!) the server delivering the meal was honest and said no.  The meal was promptly removed and I received an apology from two servers and a manager while I watched my family eat dinner.  A delicious GF meal finally arrived but the timing ruined the meal out.  And no- there was no adjustment on the bill for the inconvenience.   Bottom line:  this was a BAD mistake.  If a restaurant touts GF, they need to double check the orders.  Where I not paying attention...I would have had a sick three days.   In addition, when a meal is ruined for whatever reason, I expect a manager to make it up to me...via a discount or a coupon for another visit.  In won't be returning to this Cheesecake Factory."
Sephora S.,"Markham, Canada",7,185,160,3.0,6/28/2013,Went for a quick lunch on the way to shopping & we had a great server & the appetizer a tex mex spring roll was so delicious.  Lunch salad was disappointing...hardly no chicken...will not do salads again.
Nancy A.,"Bradenton, FL",9,28,2,4.0,6/28/2014,"Food and cheesecake here is always excellent, however a bit pricey. I had the lunch special crusted chicken which is a decent size portion for lunch, but cost $11.99. I ordered a strawberry martini and was completely shocked when I saw the cost on the bill. $12!!!  It wasn't that much or even that great. Next time I will avoid the drink menu."
Matthew W.,"Valrico, FL",8,41,33,3.0,1/13/2015,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch we got seated immediately. We asked to be seated outside since it was a nice day, waiter came over took our drink order my wife asked for a diet coke with lime she did not receive the lime with the drink had to ask the server a second time, and then it still took several minutes to bring the lime. We then placed our appetizer order and our kids order since we had not made up our minds yet a few minutes go by and then we place our orders. We had not received the complimentary bread that is usually served once you are seated so we had to ask for the bread to be brought out also the plates they set on the table for bread and appetizers mine was dirty it had some kind of sauce smeared on the top and a glob of sauce on the underneath of the plate. We got the Thai lettuce wraps which are always very good and they did not disappoint today. We each got a salad I got the Cobb salad and it was fantastic and my wife got the French country salad and she said hers was good as well. I got the lunch sized portion of the salad and it was large I don't know how much bigger the regular size salad is but I was more than happy with the size of my salad and couldn't have been able to eat much more. I gave it three stars for slow service, dirt dishes on the table having to ask a second time for lime when you asked for it initially with your drink order."
Lacey W.,"Thousand Island Park, NY",0,5,1,5.0,2/18/2015,"I love love love the Cheesecake Factory . This one in particular is always A+++ they are so accommodating to me and my family ( we often come in in large parties . The food is consistently amazing and if something isn't right, the fix it immidiatly without hesitation . I have probably eaten here at least 8/9 times in the past 3 weeks since being in Tampa on vacation . I love this place !"
M R.,"Sarasota, FL",12,302,361,4.0,11/2/2013,We ate very well at Cheesecake Factory today.  The burger with mushrooms was good and the firecracker salmon rolls were yummy.  The kids ate their kid meals and we were all satisfied.
Joe H.,"St Petersburg, FL",2,5,3,5.0,11/12/2012,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. They have great food. The service is normally pretty good. The atmosphere is great as long as you are seated at a booth or the bar (at the tables you are way too close to strangers). Favorites include the pot stickers (appetizer), Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Jambalaya . If you are a martini fan, the Red Raspberry Martini has amazing flavor."
Max W.,"Clearwater, FL",73,228,13,3.0,1/10/2013,Hostess was a pill and didn't apologize for almost running my wife down... Had to ask for small plates and silverware... Waiter came off sounding like Billy Mays every time he came to the table... Cashew chicken was very good as was the Carlton salad... Going to caulk the service up to post Christmas weirdness...
Kelli B.,"Lithia, FL",0,15,,5.0,1/6/2015,"Great food, huge portions - you will need a doggie bag - and amazing cheesecake!  Never disappointed.  Great for Kids."
Hli H.,"Sarasota, FL",14,46,16,5.0,12/1/2012,"Chicken Madeira! and any of the cheesecake selections are awesome. The service is pretty good considering they are always sooo busy. The ambiance is nice-a little on the noisy side (again since they are packed most times). Something needs to be done about the floors though. I have almost slipped several times while walking to my table, and have seen other women come close to slipping as well. Other than that I enjoy coming here."
Kristi A.,"Riverview, FL",22,58,,4.0,2/5/2013,Huge menu...in fact too large to choose from if you ask me. There are two things I go here for...the avocado egg rolls which are like heaven in my mouth and the herb crusted salmon salad which is just one of the best salads I have had anywhere. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss and there is almost always a wait here. Very loud atmosphere...typically we just order out and enjoy our salmon salads in the comfort of our own home.
jonathan H.,"Louisville, CO",0,12,,2.0,7/31/2012,"I have dined at several Cheesecake Factories accross the country. Generally, the food is good and the service is adequate. At this loction,we discovered a fly on its back half alive on our bread plate. We showed the waiter. He said , "" I will tell the manager and he will come by and talk with you."". The manager never came by and we did not receive an apology or explanation for the fly. The waiter acted as if it was perfectly normal. Half dead flys in breadbaskets with brain dead waiters is what you can expect here."
Jeddica C.,"Brandon, FL",5,7,14,3.0,8/1/2014,"I have been to this location numerous times and I have always enjoyed my experience.  I went on 7/30 for a brief planning meeting and we wanted to receive the half off cheesecake that was being offered for ""dine in only"" guest (that wasn't the case). unfortunately my server was overwhelmed and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted and to order drinks. When we finally got those it took another 10 for her to come back for our orders.  Luckily we had a lot to discuss because I would have felt looked over if not!  I tried the lemon shrimp pasta dish it was my first time ordering it. And it was OK. I also ordered a sweet tea that I had to remind her about 20 minutes after I ordered it that wasn't very good so I left it on the table and told her I didn't want it she still put it on my bill. Overall we were a very easy to please group and she thanked us for our patience.  In the end all was well when we received our $3 red velvet cheesecake my FAVORITE.  This was probably my least favorite experience at this location that I frequent maybe once a month or so they need servers that can handle the rush of National Cheesecake day a little better!"
Jason K.,"Lithia, FL",6,51,8,2.0,12/28/2012,I joined the family for lunch.  The restaurant was not that crowed and we were seated pretty quickly.  The food was prepared in timely fashion; however the service was more than a little slow.  It took forever to get the leftovers (huge portions) and the check.
Lola T.,"Sarasota, FL",22,577,174,5.0,9/21/2012,"Love this place, and I don't even eat cheesecake!  I always order the same thing because it so good.  An order of the fried macaroni & cheese and the Boston house salad.  I immediately ask the server to box 1/2 of each item and them I have dinner again for the next day.  I have also ordered carryout using curb side and have found that they have the most attentive staff working curbside.  I have never had a wrong order or missing items when I order carryout here."
Jeremy T.,"Tampa, FL",21,204,2,5.0,12/20/2009,"I've been at this location several times with friends and family.  This place has an amazing menu with so many good choices it makes it hard to decide.  Usually restaurants either have big menus where nothing is particularly great (does not make it bad either), or they have a few things they do great and little else.  This place has a big menu which everything is a winner. The food is hot, tasty, and you get a fair to large size portion as well.  This place also has takeout if you want to grab your meals to go, also if you order takeout you will not be stuck waiting for your meals for eternity either because they have to do something special for your takeout, with their cheesecake service they are used to the concept of takeout.  Also since this is located at the mall I have placed my order when I enter the mall, do my shopping, and then pick up my meal when it is time to leave. Also their cheesecakes are limitless in their selection, also it is not the only item they have for dessert, but why would you order anything else? One of the few places where you cannot go wrong."
Benjamin M.,"Denver, CO",208,199,139,5.0,1/21/2010,"It's true--I generally don't like chain restaurants. The Cheesecake Factory (along with a handful of others) is a definite exception to the rule. When people ask about my favorite restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory is on my list. If a psychologist asked me to do a word association with the ""Cheesecake Factory,"" these come to mind-- Huge portion sizes (relative to prices = great value) Diverse menu (more pages than most kids' books) Consistent food presentation Professional service The BEST strawberry lemonade Countless dessert selections Cool Mediterranean/Egyptian decorations No doubt about it: five stars. Even though it's chain food, this is a surefire bet for a great meal."
Rebecca K.,"Valrico, FL",166,117,47,4.0,5/19/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory for days when I decide to treat myself and indulge in a 3,000 calorie dinner. The fresh warm bread is always a winner. I have had slow service a couple times on very busy weekend evenings, but nothing to really complain about. The food on their 100 page menu is a plenthora of tasty items to choose from no matter what mood I am in. Although, I'm not a huge fan of their light/skinny menu and I'm sad that the past couple times I didn't see the portabella sandwich anywhere on the menu. The flavor seems to be lacking a bit on the couple of dishes I have tried from the light menu. I ordered the light lettuce wraps, but it seemed that I needed to drown the wraps in the accompanying sauces to get any burst of flavor. If you like spicy like I do - try the Black Pepper Jamaican Shrimp entree or the Sante Fe Salad from their regular menu. Portions are enough for two days of eating.  And of course the reason why most tourists or sweet tooths visit is for dessert. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and their tiramisu cheesecake is absolutely delicious. I never want to eat all of it in one sitting so I can savor it for days, but I always end up cleaning my plate and feeling like a porker waddling out of there. The couple times I've ordered a drink, I have not been overwhelmed, but not underwhelmed either.   PS. Sitting on the patio enjoying the weather = excellent people watching of the mall patrons."
Bianca A.,"South Bay, CA",17,148,4,5.0,9/10/2009,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory on Labor Day for dinner. The restaurant was full, but to my surprise there was no wait. We were greeted & seated right away by a cheerful hostess. Our server had passed by our table and said he would be right with us. I'm glad he acknowledged that we were there. He returned momentarily and he introduced himself & told us what the specials were as well as his recommendations. He was very thorough and detailed when he explained everything. He definitely knew the menu. After taking our drink order, he dropped off a bread basket which tied us over until the food arrived,which did not take long. I had ordered the Caramel Chicken. It consisted of crispy chicken pieces in a spicy Vietnamese caramel sauce with vegetables and rice. The chicken was very moist & the vegetables were crisp. The caramel sauce was tasty and not too spicy at all. The rice was just right, not overdone to where it was almost gelatinous and not dry either. Nice & fluffy, as I like it, as it should be. The Cheesecake Factory is known for its huge portion sizes & this was no exception. However, unlike other dishes I have eaten, I was able to finish a majority of this in one sitting. Our server was very attentive & checked on us often and refilled our drinks before we asked. Once he cleared our plates, he came back with the dessert menu & again told us his recommendations. I'm glad that he did because there are so many different flavors of cheesecake to choose from as one would imagine. I went with his recommendation of the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake which consisted of original cheesecake, fudge, and chocolate truffle. The cheesecake arrived shortly and it was delicious. It wasn't overly rich at all. It definitely hit the spot. I'm glad I went with his recommendation and it was a perfect way to end the meal. I would definitely come back to this location again. The restaurant was very clean, the hosts were always smiling & the servers were very attentive and knowledgeable. The manager even walked the floor several times, something I hadn't noticed at most of my restaurant visits as of late."
