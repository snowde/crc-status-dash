Jennie T.,"Riverview, FL",0,1,,5.0,3/4/2011,"This restaurant is simply amazing. Everything on their menu is absolutely superb. I believe that everyone should try their ""SOUP OF THE DAY"" because they make something different every single day, and its delicious. The waiters and waitresses are all nice and know a thing or two about at least everything on the menu. I give a 5 out of 5 stars for this restaurant and their service. Everyone should at least try this place out."
Katie B.,"Riverview, FL",81,66,5,5.0,4/9/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those rare restaurants where you can satisfy your cravings for both an impeccable dessert and a filling and delicious meal. Its atmosphere is a perfect combination of casual dining and relaxed elegance.  Whether you're taking the kids out or celebrating an anniversary, everyone is sure to enjoy the food, service, and ambiance.  My favorite dessert item is the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake; it's the perfect blend of rich, creamy cheesecake and smooth, mouth-watering chocolate.  The Cheesecake Factory also has an impressive variety of meals ranging from seafood and steaks to chicken tacos.  The chicken and biscuits nearly knocked me over when I had them. The warm and buttery biscuits nestled atop the country gravy, mashed potatoes, and veggies was delicious. I hadn't expected such a down-home delicacy from a place like The Cheesecake Factory. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more highly."
