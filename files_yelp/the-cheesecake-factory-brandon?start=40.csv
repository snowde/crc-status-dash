Nadine S.,"Apollo Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",86,344,998,4.0,3/22/2015,Arrived pretty early and already a waiting line but had loads of empty tables. Usually see that when not enough staff to cover all the tables. When called they took us to an outside table but clearly not ready so they asked us to go back inside so they could get another table ready. In the meantime several other parties of 4 were seated while we continued to wait. About 10 minutes passed and finally we were seated. The waiter was very prompt and efficient and came right over with water and menus. Food came out quickly and was piping hot and fresh. All 4 of us had something different but we started out with the garlic cheese bread that came with a yummy oil mixture and a red sauce. Delicious!!! I had the small Cobb salad which was massive yo say the least. Could have fed a family of 4. One person had the bacon cheeseburger which he said was delicious and piled high with bacon. Another had a quesadilla which was big as well.  To end the meal 2 got cheesecake of course. White chocolate raspberry and Godiva chocolate. Way too sweet for me but because the waiter brought an extra fork I didn't want him to feel bad so had a taste....they earned their name of Cheesecake Factory. Everyone we have ever tried has been delicious! Continues to be a favorite place to eat!
Ariel T.,"Tampa, FL",91,134,787,2.0,1/23/2016,"**Review is based off of To-Go Experience** I have frequented this Cheesecake Factory's location plenty of times, however I should note I rarely order anything to go from this establishment. Every time I have visited, it is usually for a sit down meal. All of the meals were I have sat down, or have even ordered from the bar have highly surpassed the level of poor service that I received from their carry out service last night. To be quite honest, I'm highly disappointed.  Especially because I spent $40 on to-go food, which to me as a college student isn't cheap by any means.  But alas, I'm highly in love with the Cheesecake Factory's guacamole, the amazing salads, and the addictive appetizers. So, I thought it would be a good idea to order myself some to go and watch a movie in the comfort of my own home. So I did what any would, I ordered ahead while I was at my house, and then proceeded to drive to Brandon to pick my food up. Well, 45 minutes later in the parking there I was-foodless, hangry, and calling them wondering what happened to my order. I was over it. Waiting out in the cold and wind forever, was definitely not Netflix and chilling like I'd intended. I was wondering why the heck everything took an eternity to prepare. I'd just ordered guacamole, Luau salad, and buffalo chicken blasts. Two things that are cold, and a fried appetizer should never take that long! I will return, only because I love the service I get in the restaurant. However, I will definitely remember this horrible moment and never order anything to-go from this location again. Lesson learned."
Michelle P.,"Tampa, FL",3,51,20,4.0,10/23/2016,"Excellent food and good service!  Went there today and got the grilled salmon for myself, the spaghetti and meatballs for my son. The food arrived hot, large portions and was delicious. We got the tiramisu cheesecake for desert and it was great!"
Raf N.,"Tampa, FL",6,107,183,3.0,1/24/2016,"****This review is for their cheesecake only. This is gonna be a short review as I just ate one slice of their cheesecake by myself and now I gotta hit the gym to convert cheesecake into muscle.  Oreo and Red Velvet ones are the best, IMO. White Vanilla was bad. No, I did not eat all 3 in one day. - Sent from my iPhone @ LA Fitness"
Samantha S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,9,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I'm 23 weeks pregnant and have been craving Thai Lettuce Wraps from CCF for months. I decided to travel to Brandon to get some today, and after waiting an hour for our food my chicken was raw. :( and according to my waitress that's what took so long to bring our food. Safe to say that not only didn't I eat them but it ruined the dish for me probably forever."
Angela M.,"Smyrna, TN",37,9,,4.0,4/12/2017,Amazing service and the avocado egg rolls are to die for... Fish and chips were good with sweet potato fries and saut√©ed spinach. Yum!
Stephen D.,"Lakeland, FL",1,70,49,4.0,4/9/2017,We always enjoy going to dinner here. Depending on the time there can be a lengthy wait but the staff is nice and the food is always on point.
Chandler D.,"Tampa, FL",2,16,,1.0,12/29/2016,"Wish I could give ZERO stars. This is our second and last time at this place. We got a pasta dish. The menu didn't say it was covered in disgusting cilantro and parsley. I'm allergic to cilantro and God knows how it's contaminated with other herbs in the kitchen. Had to send the pasta back because it was dusted with cilantro. Asked the server to just give me the pasta. No herbs. After waiting 30 minutes for a second dish- the server brings out another bowl of pasta covered in herbs. Seriously??? The manager on duty with her giant pregnant belly simply said ""have a good night momma."" Wtf??? You should've comped my entire meal. Disgusting. Didn't eat anything. Literally came home starving. Don't waste your money or time."
Stacy K.,"Winter Garden, FL",30,32,,5.0,4/22/2017,First time at this restaurant. Service was excellent. Waitress was very informative. Gave us recommendations and they were great. Food was delicious. Will definitely come back again.
Deb R.,"Hudson, OH",0,2,,1.0,8/21/2017,"We arrived at Cheesecake Factory in Brandon at 8:10 pm. There were multiple open tables open on one of two patios. ( The other patio was empty.) When we asked to be seated outside we were told they weren't seating outside. When I questioned it, the manager said it was because he was having "" trouble "" with wait staff. We would have to wait 20 minutes. ( vs. 5 minutes for inside seating.) We patiently waited the 20 minutes all the while watching 5 tables finish & leave on the patio. Finally after the 20 minute wait I again went inside only to have the teen hostess dismiss my request. I then said I would definitely be writing a yelp review on this experience. The manager then magically appeared. We were then seated on the other empty patio. Poor customer service. We have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the US and have never had such a strange and rude experience as far as the staff. The assigned waiter was courteous. The food was not prepared to the usual Cheesecake Factory level. ( The Santa Fe salad lettuce was not chopped and the chicken was undercooked.) I see why their overall Yelp rating is only 3.5."
Yilian D.,"Tampa, FL",24,7,11,5.0,2/16/2017,They have so much food to choose from it's crazy! I absolutely love it and it's so beautifully decorated inside too.
Alex P.,"Lithia, FL",6,12,2,2.0,5/8/2017,"First of let's start off with the wait. The girl at the front desk said that my wait would be about 30 minutes and eventually it ended up being almost an hour however, this was indeed a Saturday night so that is on my part. Now, when I finally got my table I was seated in an area that was uncleaned and as noisy as hell. I finally ordered my drink and after that when the bread came, THE WAS NO SOUR DOUGH BREAD! I was really looking forward to trying it but they only had wheat bread which paired with butter is pretty good. So when I got my spaghetti and meatballs, the pasta and the meatballs as a whole were pretty good except for the fact that the meatballs where kind of overcooked on a few sides but that wasn't really a problem. So for the food itself, it was actually pretty decent and the Oreo cheesecake i had was very good! However the atmosphere there is really the pits. It tries to be something classy but doesn't do that good of a job and it's EXTREMLEY noisy especially on a Saturday night. The food was decent however the atmosphere is really what drags it down."
Thomas S.,"Gibsonton, Tampa Bay, FL",23,27,1,1.0,4/10/2016,"This review is for the waiter I will have to call Man Bun McBeardface. We arrived on this evening wanting dinner and some cheesecake. We ordered an appetizer and told Mr Manbun (didn't give his name) that we would like the order our entrees after the app had arrived so that we didn't end up rushed, and he immediately copped an attitude. Ok I understand you are a waiter and know your job but we have been burned before at this location. So my wife request that her dish be served spicy, and Mr McBeardface comes to the table and slams a bowl of chili flakes and says, ""this is all we have."" (Strike 2)  (strike 3) He messes up my order, completely, and doesn't offer at least soup or salad while I wait for the kitchen to fix the original order. He doesn't comp the order, or even take off my drink or anything in which I believe is a ploy to not get in trouble with the management. Not hard to please, but Cheesecake Factory dropped the ball on this entire experience, and I honestly would rather tip a server that does an ok job instead of entitled hipster trash."
Steven K.,"Darien, GA",7,11,1,4.0,1/24/2017,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory, we ordered Dynamite Shrimp, Fried Mac&Cheese, and Guacamole. Shrimp was amazing! Reminds me of Bone Fish Grill. Fried Mac&Cheese was good crunchy and creamy. We ordered the medium spice guacamole(we wanted a little spicy not too much) but it didn't have any spice to it. Still taste good none the less. Tyler was our bartender, super friendly and nice guy! Makes a good Long Island and Mojito."
L Y.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,29,22,4.0,10/16/2015,"The mixed fries were really tasty. Pieces of fried mushroom, zucchini and avocado! Tried the parmesan bread and it wasn't anything to order again. We skipped the entrees and went straight into trying the cheesecakes. Lemon raspberry and Lemon meringue were 2 of the best cheesecakes I've tasted. Had to order another slice of each to take home. Pumpkin pecan was good. Lastly Keylime was just tooooooo sour. Just a little more hint of sugar would had made it better. Overall, Cheesecake has never disappointed me. Good food and desserts."
Janice U.,"Valrico, FL",1,17,16,5.0,6/24/2016,"I've never been disappointed by anything I've tried at the Cheesecake Factory. Tonight my boyfriend and I ate a light dinner at home and came here just for the cheesecake and coffee. I had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and an iced latte. Delicious! I couldn't finish it so I'm bringing the rest home for later.  We got here at about 7:00 on a Friday night. There was a wait for the restaurant but not for outside, so we sat on the patio. We were waited on immediately and the service was great and courteous. Highly recommend."
Melanie H.,"Davenport, FL",63,88,227,4.0,5/27/2016,"Came here for dessert for our anniversary. You can never go wrong with dessert here! ¬†My hubby ordered a regular cheesecake, which he devoured. I ordered the raspberry lemon cheesecake and it was awesome! ¬†The mix of sweet and tart was perfect. I also ordered an appetizer- portabello, zucchini and avocado fries and it was delicious! ¬†The sauces that come with it make the appetizer complete and food couldn't be eaten without it. The appetizer was much too much for me to eat by myself, but definitely made me happy to have as a late night snack before heading home! ¬†It was difficult to get out quickly as our server was no where to be seen, but not surprising as it was late at night and many were doing their side jobs and cleaning. Still will keep us coming back!"
Diane G.,"Tampa, FL",117,291,115,3.0,7/17/2015,"If you have a hard time making deciisons (as I often do), you may find it difficult to decide what to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is more than a dozen pages long and contains everything from salads, burgers, and pasta, to steaks, seafood, and Mexican...when given so many options, it's also difficult to get a good answer from the server as to ""What is really good?"". I would assume, given the name, that their specialty is (every type imaginable of) cheesecake, for which there is also an abundance of options...unfortunately I have never tried any of them. Today we had the nachos appetizer, and I stopped at that because 1) the plate was rather large for two people, and 2) I still could not make up my mind. The nachos weren't bad. My companion ordered enchiladas, which she said were good (when I want Mexican food, I want to go to a Mexican restaurant). The decor is nice (and the restrooms were very clean), service was decent and so were our drinks (the first round seemed to be prepared better than round two); I especially enjoyed my pear martini.  Great place for to meet up for a girl's happy hour and some mall shopping after."
Meredith B.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,33,129,2.0,10/29/2016,"Not the best experience here...we were packed in like sardines at 2 seater tables in the bar area. Kind of weird being so close to people next to us...especially with loud talkers!! ¬†Waitress was ok, didn't seem like she was totally there, but might just be a bad day?! We ordered the fried mac and cheese, which was tasty! My husband ordered the Cajun chicken littles... while it was a lot of food it was terrible. Chicken had zero flavor, and all pieces were cooked inconsistenly. Some were really dry and rubbery. ¬†Mashed potatoes were not the best, but the corn was good. I had chicken quesadillas which were fine, nothing spectacular. ¬†All in all the food and experience were definitely not worth the price. We won't be back again. I suggest trying one of the other restaurants in the area."
Sharon S.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",1,7,,1.0,1/7/2017,"My 2 daughters and I visited this location today for the first around 2:30, and we were seated after a few minutes. ¬†The waitress took drink orders, 3 waters and a cocktail. ¬†Water arrived, asked if we would like bread, and said yes. ¬†Orders were taken, i ordered Renee's Special (salad, 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup), daughter ordered tuna tartare, and the other ordered Thai lettuce chicken wraps. ¬†Waitress asked if I would like more water, I replied please, thank you (she took my glass and returned with same glass) that was a first, not sure why a pitcher of water was not brought to fill all glasses.   We waited, waited and waited for food. ¬†The waitress stopped by and said its taking a little long on the Thai wraps. ¬†We continued to wait. ¬†Total time 45 minutes, the tuna tartare and mine were brought to table, and she said it would be a few more for the wraps. ¬†My Renee's special was not like the one at International Mall, it was a plate of lettuce, 3 tomato wedges, less than 1/2 sandwich and luke warm soup.  They were delivered with the chicken strips not cooked through. ¬†Which is hard to do since we are talking strips, we called waitress over and let her know the chicken is not cooked through, and she asked if my daughter wanted more, and of course not since it took forever to get our meals. ¬† One of the managers stopped by and said ""I heard you had some problems"". ¬†My ¬†daughter said her chicken was not cooked through. He offered cheesecake to compensate for our ruined meal. ¬† This was absolutely worse meal ever at Cheesecake Factory, and will not be baxk to this location."
