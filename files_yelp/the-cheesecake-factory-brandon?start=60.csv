Derek N.,"Reidville, SC",74,355,282,4.0,5/23/2014,"Decided to stop by for some cheesecake after a horrible experience at another restaurant. SO GLAD WE DID!!! My Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake was PERFECTION! The portion was generous and the taste was fantastic. The Oreo cookie on top was crispy and fresh. The whip cream was not sweet enough for my liking, but this did not hurt the main dish. I did have some left overs to bring home for another day. The bartenders quickly greeted us and made us feel welcome. The bottles of wine, on the top shelf, could use a little dusting; but all in all it was a great experience. We do like the new covered outside patio. We will have to try eating out there one day."
Betty S.,"Brandon, FL",26,4,,5.0,11/22/2016,"Can't remember ever having a meal from there that I wasn't totally satisfied with, and I've eaten from there 10+ times. Normally would get the spaghetti and meatballs. The cheesecake is also heavenly as expected given the name of the place. A little more expensive but great location for a special occasion!"
Richard S.,"Brandon, FL",0,28,,5.0,11/11/2016,Love love the Cheesecake Factory always pretty good service the food is good and milkshakes are excellente.
Lisa B.,"Tampa, FL",7,14,36,4.0,11/7/2016,"Waited 1/2 hr on a Saturday evening, not bad for them, they were crazy busy. ! We had a party of 7 and they put us in a booth w/ a chair at the end, which wasn't a good idea, waiters trays flying overhead. Food was okay (endamame/ fish tacos). Service was good . Cheesecake, awesome. But they are pricey. $92 for 2 adults and 1 child."
Hikmet Salih O.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,11,7,2.0,4/1/2016,I rarely write reviews. The place either has to rock or really suck for a review. It sucks at here. We have been sitting for almost 1 hour and only thing we got so far is bread and french fries. So far drank 3 glasses of soda and i feel like i am full already. Really lame. Good thing is I am visiting the town only and not coming here again. Otherwise a great place.
Dingo X.,"Gibsonton, FL",6,9,,3.0,7/2/2016,A place where rich white folk dine but I still squad up my minority friends to eat here. All the privileged caucasians snapping at the necks when we rolling up. Their computers got shut down temporarily through a power outage and I was hoping for free food(Have you seen those prices?)but no luck was found.
Marcie S.,"Navarre, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/20/2017,"Worst Service Ever!  First time in our 28 years together, my husband and I walked  out  of  a  restaurant. We  certainly  don't  mind  waiting  for  a  table.  But  to be  ignored for almost 15 minutes after being seated while others in the area, seated after us, were served is ridiculous.  We asked the waiter if we could have some service. His  response, ""A server will be with you.  We left and enjoyed a delicious dinner at Bahama Breeze."
HR M.,"Lithia, FL",0,83,29,1.0,5/10/2015,"Not very impressed by this Cheesecake Factory. We have been here several times and have been overall consistently disappointed. There have been numerous occasions of very slow service; messed up orders and skimpy servings.  Yes, we've noticed Cheesecake Factory servings getting much smaller over the last couple of years.  Tonight, we are done!!! We ordered items and after waiting 20 minutes, we were informed that they were out of a key ingredient. There is no reason for that. If you cannot provide something on the menu, then that is a call that should be made early. Further, this is not some family small business. This is a major chain restaurant and it is lame to be out of something.  Done. This is our last visit to the restaurant. We'll go somewhere else. If we have a Cheesecake Factory desire, we will go to a different one than here."
John F.,"Gibsonton, FL",2,3,,1.0,11/13/2016,"One star because  This place has to be very tough with its' employyees about washing their hand after using the restroom. the other day I was in the restroom in the mall, I saw an employee has the uniform on, didn't wash his hand after he used the restroom. that's disgusting.  they should care more about people's health."
Robyn B.,"Orlando, FL",66,157,126,4.0,2/17/2015,"I've visited this location once before and enjoyed my experience. During my most recent trip, the review is the same . I'm going to guess that this location fairly busy all of the time, as it is located in the mall and during both of my visits there was a wait. Thankfully during this visit, we were there strictly for cheesecake so seating in the bar was appropriate. I'm not sure if this is true to all locations, but at this one, you are able to seat yourself in the bar area. They are also full service in the bar so just an FYI for those who don't like to wait :) Our waiter came to take our orders shortly after we sat down and he was very nice and patient. I was with a friend who was slightly indecisive and had several questions about the different cheesecakes that they offer. Our waiter was very well versed in the cheesecake menu and made great recommendations for all of us. We were all very pleased with our choices.  Each time I visit the Cheesecake Factory, I try to order a different flavor cheesecake. On this visit I chose to try the pineapple upside-down cheesecake. Now I've often shied away from this one because when I want cheesecake, I really WANT cheesecake and this particular cake has 2 layers of pineapple cake with pineapple cheesecake in between. BUT I am SO glad that I opted to try this one because it was soooooooooooo delicious! I was extremely pleased with it.  Now, if you've never had a piece of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, please know that this isn't your typical thin, petite, restaurant portion of desert. These portions are huge and easily enough to be shared by 2 or 3. If you just want a little taste, make sure you plan to share. One of my friends opted for the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which had a lighter flavor than the pineapple upside down but was very tasty as well. The other chose the red velvet cheesecake which is extremely rich and sweet. I've had this one before as well and it's an awesome choice!"
James P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",67,459,57,3.0,11/2/2014,"Brandon Cheesecake Factory is truly a mirror of everything Brandon is all about - it's in a mall, the clientele is entirely moms and elderly, and it is completely chain-restaurant vanilla.  Huge portions, expensive domestic beer, and cheesecake galore.  A few notes: - Burgers aren't a great value.  They run $12-14, but the fries that come with are in a little tin cup.  You get BIG BURGER little fries. - There is basically every type of food available through their menu, so if you want something not listed, you can probably get it anyway.  As long as it includes the ingredients they have, you can Frankenstein something together. - Their menu is 30something pages long, but many of those pages are ads.  But who has ever sat down at the Fac (what kids in the know call this establishment), seen an ad for customized Warhol-esque pop art, and gone ""YES I NEED THAT!""   - White napkins shed on your fine clothing.  Ask for black."
Barry F.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,35,145,5.0,10/1/2016,We love going here We always start out with the Avocado egg rolls It's our favorite then on to more stuff
JD P.,"Riverview, FL",16,53,3,2.0,7/11/2016,"Well, I was waiting for my daughter and a friend to shop at the mall so I went here to have a drink and kill some time...It was 5:55 HH over @ 6 the gent; Tyler gave me a BM under happy hour price. It was ok. I proceeded to wait for my wife to leave work and meet me there. She showed-up and was hungry, it was MY Birthday...she ate,  I was not hungry , she had the chick and shrimp with rice in peanut sauce. It was ok. A meal like that for 19 dollars should have taken her breath away, I tried it, it was worth maybe 11 bucks if it was good. She ordered a Mojito, 12.25 REALLY?? WTH is that????? Never again. If you are going to charge NYC & LA prices , you should warn the customer pls! I had two beers and a BM, My wife the rice plate, my daughter showed up and had spinach dip sprite with chips, the bill was 110 bucks before tip???, I didn't eat! The prices are ridiculous for what you get. Tyler however charged my phone for me which was really cool because it died in like 30 mins...freaking Samsung...lol The cheesecake ( salted Carmel) was awesome except for the crunch part on the bottom, it was probably right, ??? but it felt like I was eating crunched-up glass It will be a while before I go there again, I didn't even get a discount for a Birthday dinner like 99 other restaurants do."
Melissa V.,"Tampa, FL",81,148,214,1.0,10/1/2015,Came here to get a small bite and I got the buffalo wings and husband got the chicken viggilino or something but his plate was good and so was mine until I bit into my third chicken wing. It was bloody and we called the waiter and she apologized and took it to the back and the manager came out and apologized as well and offered us another set of wings but we had no appetite after that and didn't want to take the chance at another bad batch so yeah. It was an okay experience. Nothing to wow over.
Daryl M.,"Sun City Center, FL",36,104,120,4.0,11/12/2015,"Cheesecake Factory, another dependable chain restaurant. Food is pretty good, desserts are great, service is generally really good too. The location can get very busy. They have outdoor seating, this will normally get you in quicker if you are willing to sit outside. Service ranges from ok to stellar. I've never really had bad service here, so that's a huge plus. Portion sizes are HUGE. I normally split a meal and still have left overs. The menu is a novel so they have a little bit of everything. Normally with large Menus quality of food can suffer. I have not found that to be the case with CF. The only real downside to me is seating can feel a bit crowded, especially the tables near the bar. The manager is normally always floating around too. Overall: priced well, very larger portions and a very busy location."
Halee D.,"Brandon, FL",73,2,,3.0,4/14/2017,I LOVE this place and the size of the menu fits anyone's food taste. But they put the calorie count so that made me a little sad when ordering. How rude.
Terry M.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,97,7,5.0,1/20/2016,"I started this review off very poorly. My wife and I were able to get away from town for a few days and decided to eat here although they also have one in Jacksonville. It did not start out well.  When we were finally seated after a LONG wait where we felt we got skipped, with no apologies we were seated in a small but crowded section with no privacy. I could see they were closing off sections due to short staff or closing in a few hours but I had to ask. As it happens, I asked a person who looked like a server if we could move and it was actually the manager. She sat us alone in the closed section and she must have remembered our wait and personally saw to our needs. It was a great recovery from a dining experience that started off poorly.   The food is the same as you'll get at any other Cheesecake factory but the service was unique."
TheBaby D.,"Tampa, FL",0,53,23,2.0,1/30/2017,I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory always have been however this is the first time I was disappointed. I decided to dine here for a nice hot lunch when I received a room temperature meal NO GOOD! when you order steak and potatoes you would expect it to be hot right. Unfortunately mine was not the plate it arrived on was hotter then the food in it. When the manager came not at my request but the waitress (must be their policy) he assured me the heat on my meal would be corrected. Round 2 the meal was brought to me by the manager nice man mind you he didn't need a towel to hold a so called hot plate and hot food. He waited while I tasted what turned out to be the same temperature as the first plate and I told him so. He apologized for this. I tried to get through the meal but damn it mashed potatoes are suppose to be hot as well as my steak. I asked for my meal to be bagged I wasn't interested in finishing it. At least the manager offered to compensate me with a slice of Cheesecake to which I declined. I guess today was not my day at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not giving up though maybe at this spot next time closer to home. The best part of lunch was the drink and water with lemon
Chris M.,"Lutz, FL",13,34,,1.0,2/11/2017,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factories in the past, including this one in Brandon MANY times. But lately we have been disappointed by the Brandon location.  A few times we were seated in the booths up against the glass that looks into the kitchen.  When we happened to look up at the glass we were astonished to see tons of flies flying around at the top of the glass!  Not cool CF!  Also, while eating my burger and fries, I constantly had to ""shoe away"" little bugs that were hovering around our food on the table.  Gross!  Yesterday we decided to give it a try again because we had a gift card.  We were seated a row over from the glass window this time thank goodness.  The family at the table next to us left just after we sat down.  And then the two tables next to that also left after finishing their meals.  The whole time we were there having lunch, not one person came to clear the three tables down from us.  They must have sat dirty and untouched for at least 30 minutes!  Disgusting!  Their service has been really lacking lately....I hope someone from corporate is reading these and takes notice.  For the amount of money they charge for a meal, I expect to eat without having to shoe away bugs the whole time!  I don't know what's going on, but for the time being I'll take my money elsewhere.  Sorry CF!"
Sheri D.,"Sebring, FL",19,71,9,3.0,8/6/2016,The whole staff from the hostess to the mgmt that I came into contact w was so pleasant and personable.  The skinny margarita was yummy although I think $10.25 and a lot of ice stuffed in the glass was a little pricey.  I had two margaritas and an appetizer (which was spinach and tortilla chips) my bill was $45 w tip - no it's not a lot of money - but for the area and a being a chain resturant I thought too pricey.  Oh well - lesson learned and props to my server!!!
