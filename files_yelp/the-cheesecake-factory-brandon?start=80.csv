Andrew L.,"Springfield, IL",37,51,108,5.0,1/10/2016,Had the Oreo supreme cheesecake tonight. The consistency of the cheesecake is always incredible. The Oreo supreme was tranquil and provided a fantastic finish to a great night!
Robin H.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,3/21/2017,Stuffed mushrooms were horrible felt like throwing up didn't like the menu don't eat cheesecake but food sucked over rated.
Steve F.,"Riverview, FL",0,3,,1.0,3/19/2017,Be CAREFUL I went to this Cheesecake Factory yesterday and I almost swallowed a piece of GLASS  that was in my drink.
James I.,"Tampa, FL",20,40,19,4.0,12/22/2014,"Normally, the word""chain"" dredges up fear and disgust (I'm looking at you Applebees) But sometimes, chain restaurants can be enjoyable and make you change your mind. I recently went to the Brandon location this past Saturday with my parents. for my birthdayI've been to CF in Chicago at the base of the John Hancock building before, and besides the structure itself, the food , service, ambiance were similar. CF could be accused of having a Dissociative Identity Disorder since their entrees range from pastas, chops, seafood, pizza, sandwiches..etc IMO, most of the dishes seem to be covered well. I ordered my staple, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and a mojito.  The mojito was cool , crisp, and great. The pasta was nice and spicy, shrimp fresh, and as is the course with CF, enough for 2 meals. My parents were surprised because they thought it was primarily a dessert place, but were shocked at the dizzying amount of entrees. For dessert, I ordered the Caramel Pecan turtle cheesecake. It was awesome, but cheesecake in any flavor was awesome.  Service was good and the servers decorated the cake plate with ""Happy Birthday"" in syrup and sang which was nice. Parking wasnt an issue since the restaurant is part of Brandon Town Center and even on a busy Christmas Saturday night, we were able to park close. Just dont get on the scale the next day  lol.."
Tina F.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,1.0,2/6/2017,Terrible service. 16 year old hostess had way too much attitude just because we asked to sit outside twice. Nice bartender. The food was good. The server was short and not sweet. I've eaten at enough cheesecake factories to know not to go back to this location.
Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",435,435,1503,5.0,11/13/2012,"We recently had dinner at the bar at this Cheesecake Factory and I must say it was one of the most pleasant dining situations we have had recently. Our Bartender/ Server Ronnie was on the ball. He had drinks in front of us before we had really even settled into our seats and he kept them full. We like to eat at the bar because it is typically more private than some of the tables, you get a t.v. and you have the bartender (who rarely leaves the area directly in front of you) to wait on you.  We ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Stuffed Chicken Tortillas for our entrees. They were both extremely delicious. The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas came with 2 delicious corn cakes (sort of like spoon cornbread formed into cakes) that I could not get enough of. The meal had a green sauce that is a little different from what I would traditionally eat (aka red sauce), but it worked out nicely. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my Husbands. It is bow-tie pasta covered in a creamy and slightly spicy sauce with fried pounded chicken on top.  We grabbed dessert to go and we were out of the restaurant in less than 40 minutes. Fast, delicious and we had leftovers. Winning."
Patrick C.,"Valrico, FL",0,9,,4.0,1/28/2016,"I was here the past weekend on a date and has a nice time for dinner. They had a long wait considering how packed the place was but after about 50 minutes, we were able to get a table. You would think that the service would be bad on a busy night, but our server was very attentive, checking up regularly if we needed anything. Their menu is a bit heavy but I am a fan of their Cajun Jambalaya and Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. However, Cheesecake is the name here an they definately deliver in that department. From their original traditional cheesecake to their many specialty ones, they have one for every sweet tooth. My preference is the peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. With good food, decent drinks, and great service, its understandable that Cheesecake Factory is one of the more popular restaurants in Brandon during weekends. Just understand that you will probably have to wait close to an hour to grab a seat."
Carla H.,"Riverview, FL",0,15,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Menu is like a novel-they try to do too much! You have Asian, Mexican, American, German, and so on and so forth and a lot of the food I would classify as just ok, and not much above it. Haven't they watched Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmare lol the first thing he does is knock half the pages off of the menu at restaurants and for good reason! When you try to do too much it can never be that good! Specialize in something! However the cheesecake is of course on point. Cheesecake Factory is only good due to its atmosphere and cheesecake because if they didn't have that NO One would go there!"
Bo V.,"Hurricane, WV",2,26,2,3.0,7/21/2016,I usually drop 5 star reviews for Cheesecake Factory but this location wasnt great. Enchiladas were overwhelmingly seasoned with cilantro as was the beans and rice. Boom boom chicken and shrimp was bland and had no kick. My girlfriends roasted garlic pasta wS really good. Apple Caramel cheesecake wasnt the best and raspberry cheesecake barely had raspberry
Melissa P.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,7,2,4.0,1/7/2016,"Visiting Tampa, we were in the mood for something sweet and I'm fond of cheesecake so we ended up here. I had an original cheesecake, M had chocolate tuxedo and a chocolate shake all of it was yummy but the shake was surprisingly better than the cheesecakes. Service was friendly and fast."
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,792,1522,5.0,6/26/2012,"My family and I are Cheesecake Factory regulars. I think I have been to this location over 100 times since I moved to Brandon back in 2005. The service here has always been great, much better than the other location at the International Plaza where the waiters are schizo. It's the place where my nephew tried his first cheeseburger when he was a toddler, birthday parties, and numerous other events have occurred here, it is filled with memories. I love most things on the menu. The avocado eggroll sliders and tuna tartare are my favorite appetizers. I previously ate their burgers regularly, but have found them to be a little too salty in the last few years. The caramel chicken is an awesome choice and is inspired by Vietnamese cuisine with just a touch of spiciness. The four cheese pasta is always great. Their factory burrito grande is no joke, never order it alone unless you plan to box it. Brunch at Cheesecake Factory is always a great thing as well. The factory huevos rancheros are awesome. Like I said before, I will eat almost anything on the love Cheesecake Factory menu. Is it healthy? No. Is it tasty? Yes. The portions are huge, so it isn't a bad idea to share them and then also save on price as well. Finally who can leave the Cheesecake Factory without a waiter or waitress suggested you take some cheesecake home? My favorite cheesecake choices are the fresh banana cream cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Delicious. The bartender always makes great drinks as well and despite the huge crowd, you still get seated in a reasonable manner.  The Cheesecake Factory may be a chain, but it is one of my favorite chains."
Khurram W.,"Orange Park, FL",0,4,,5.0,12/13/2015,"Nice location, food and atmosphere, great service. Kids loved it. Wish had some room left to try a wide range of available cheesecakes."
Rosetta P.,"Tampa, FL",4,17,,3.0,6/24/2016,"Nice atmosphere.  Enjoyed time with the family overall but I was a little dismayed for my 17 y.o. who I let order a $20 dinner shrimp and steak dinner that left us disappointed.  I mean there were 4 round just about bite size pieces of steak and only 3 medium size shrimp, with her mashed potatoes on the plate.  They spread it out and use a lot of cream sauce to make you think you're getting a lot.  I just assumed like I said for a twenty dollar plate, they could've done a little better than that.  At least one nice round piece of meat and 5-6 shrimp.  I had higher expectations.  Overall, it was nice... celebrated my mom's 90th birthday which they sang her happy birthday, but if I don't go back, I won't lose anything over it."
Mailoha A.,"Tampa, FL",518,567,9992,4.0,7/23/2014,"What I ordered: miso salmon Good service, good food, and good price."
Sandra L.,"Brandon, FL",0,7,,1.0,1/13/2017,Have ate here 100's of times. Busy day at work a week ago and took home $65.00 dinner. Everything in it was awful except piece of cheesecake. If I hadn't picked it up myself I would have said it did not come from Cheesecake Factory!! Items we have ordered many times and loved!! To expensive not to get the quality your paying for!!! Contacted customer service online that very night with all of the details and they never even bothered to answer me and apologize
Lo S.,"Tampa, FL",279,206,321,4.0,7/18/2014,"So...call me typical, touristy, or WHATEVA. I really like Cheesecake Factory. My personal favorite is in Caesar's Palace is Vegas. I come here for the Spicy Ahi Tuna roll and a Passionfruit mojito. It's like...it's like multiple orgasms of the culinary arts man. Epic noms infinity. And for $12 that passionfruit mojito better be that good. Wtf?  I ended up at this particular locations during one of Tampa's mid-afternoon tsumai/torrential rainfall episodes. No biggie.  I usually sit at the bar because the service is always TOP NOTCH. At all CCF's bruh. Bar!!! All day!!! Again, great service!!! But, $30 for a mojito and ahi tuna salad? (Didn't order my beloved tuna roll on this day) Goodness gracious!!! That's pretty durn steep!!!  I still love CCF for consistently good service. But the prices...EEEKKK!!!"
David A.,"Plant City, FL",0,24,4,2.0,6/6/2015,"Okay, so I Love Cheesecake Factory, but they should re-name the Brandon, FL location ""House of Flies"". We were seated in a booth in the front on the windows that look over the parking lot on the West side. There were 20 flys on the inside of the window flying around so we asked to be moved to the interior of the restaurant, which they did after we explained why. So they put us in a booth by the kitchen, which has a large glass partition, which is like a fancy fly display case. Flys everywhere on the glass. They have several ways to combat this now, they may want to start trying to get rid of these nasty critters.   Good food as always, but I hate to think a fly helped cook it."
Bonnie S.,"Riverview, FL",0,12,,1.0,2/19/2016,Cheese Cake Factory ...you guys... I was very disappointed this evening. I had the Steak Taco's the only thing that was good about this dish was the steak pieces.  The rice was so hot and spicy I couldn't eat it and the black beans were just ok. The Taco shells were awful !   I really wished that I sent it back. I wanted to try something different on your menu ... I never try anything new always have a hand full of dishes that I order.   Not an enjoyable dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  P.S WE WERE SURPRISED THAT YOU ALOUD BALLOONS FOR A CHILDS/TEENS BIRTHDAY PARTY. Hmmmm
Melanie D.,"Riverview, Tampa Bay, FL",71,7,,3.0,6/19/2016,"The service was just okay. It felt like we were rushed and when we said we needed more time it felt like we waited awhile for the waitress to come back . The food was mediocre. Nothing to really rave about . Wait time for a table wasn't too bad . Maybe we just went on a bad day , might come back at a later date. High prices for sub par food and service ."
Ian S.,"Riverview, FL",87,242,20,4.0,5/27/2015,"If you can't find something that catches your attention on this menu, there's maybe something wrong with you. The menu is a book, with adverts, that goes on, and on, and on. And they pretty much nail everything on the menu too. If I had to pick a favorite dish it would be the chicken costelletta (sp?). It's a huge piece of pounded down chicken cutlet lightly breaded and sauteed with a lemon sauce, yummy! Of course the cheesecake here is awesome, and again, there are way too many choices for cheesecake as well. Not to be outshone by the cheesecake... I can also vouch for the carrot cake and the black out cake, both to die for."
