Rae A.,"San Diego, CA",21,110,435,4.0,12/26/2017,"Can I just say this place is lit for the holidays? We waited maybe 30/40 minutes which I guess isn't too bad? Our server was super cheery which made it fun and she also hooked us up with like 3 baskets of free bread, which is always a win. Our food did take some time to come out but it was understandable.  Fried Zucchini:  4/5 It was crispy, not that oily and served with ranch. I personally have had better fried zucchini for cheaper but you know, you're paying for the atmosphere. It wasn't a huge serving and it as small slices of zucchini, very petite and cute. Fried Calamari: 4.5/5 It wasn't oily, squid was tender, served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Was a good serving size and came out pretty hot. It was well seasoned, not really sure how much it cost but rentals said it was pretty good.  Bistro Shrimp Pasta: 4.5/5 It was a huge portion filled with lots of mushrooms and shrimp. It was creamy and coated with the pesto sauce but it wasn't overwhelming. It wasn't a heavy pasta dish but it was filling and it was hard to stop.  Miso Salmon:  3/5 It tasted more like teriyaki than miso. It was a little sweet. It was served with a lot more rice to salmon ratio. If you're asian, you've probably had better rice.  Cajun Jambalaya 4/5 Well, I wasn't able to try this for diet reason as per usual but my father finished it and it looked like there was a lot and also that's all I can say.  Eggplant Parmesan:  3/5 It was a little oily and had a lot of cheese, which to some people is not a bad thing. It comes with three slices of eggplant heavily coated in breadcrumbs and topped with mozzarella and marinara. It comes with a small side of pesto that was pretty much just empty carbs. It was not hot surprisingly.  New York Steak: 5/5 Wow who would have thought that steak here was pretty good? She ordered it medium well and it came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Pretty good I think because again, she finished it to the last bite.  Cheesecake Factory is another American food chain that has great service, great bread, and a great ambience. It's a good place to celebrate and as much as I try not to eat sweets, the cheesecakes are honestly, the icing on the cake."
Erica L.,"Irvine, CA",769,9,11,3.0,1/5/2018,"I rarely write comments but I just placed a to go order on the phone and a waitress named Ariel was seriously the nicest person ever. She asked if I wanted to do curbside pick up or if I would be walking in to pick up my order. Now I know curbside pick up sounds pretty self-explanatory but as someone who has never done that I asked the silly question what exactly is that. She was completely patient and explain to me how it would work and was so nice I felt the compulsion to write this.  Update: So disappointed, went through curbside pick up and grabbed my order only to return home and realize that no utensils were included. Sounds Silly but I remember being really impressed with their take out utensil quality. I even tipped them for a to go order !! :( But was super disappointed that they didn't include butter with my bread when I specifically said to include it over the phone. I proceed to open my two pastas, and find them both lukewarm. I only live 7 mins away and also when I asked the waiter who brought my food, he told me the order had just come out. My bf who ordered the bistro shrimp pasta said it was bland and mine was as well. Better luck next time ??"
Rx L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/8/2017,"I wanted to take the time to thank Carmen and Chris ( manager from Riverside) for making our tip an exceptional one. I've never been a fan of CCF however because of these two individuals I have become a fan. Their service and attentiveness was beyond compare. Thank you both for the wonder full experience. We visited 12/4/17 at 6:15pm, sat at table 46, and was check number 0289. I have written this review 3 times in different locations to make sure the staff listed below gets the credit they are due"
Jeffery D.,"Brea, CA",1,67,48,2.0,1/8/2018,Never be back got a gift card for Christmas came on the Friday before New Years for a Togo order I sat there for 15 waiting for my food to come out of the kitchen and there bags up on the counter and those bags had my food in it that time I was sitting there waiting for it to come out then I asked for well done and the burgers came to my wife and son who is six rare as rare can get still bleeding and that's not a joke all the food was pretty much throw out shoulda just got the cheesecake they try to fix it and say they'll send me a gift card and where very nice about it so we'll see what happens maybe I'll give it another go if not for sure a cheesecake lol
Val G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",228,409,249,4.0,12/7/2017,"So I just started my new vegan life style and a vendor invites me to lunch in the area. We stop by The Cheesecake Factory because I am sure that they would have something for me even if I have to just go with a side salad but I learn I'm in good shape because they have a few different offerings.  I didn't get to look at the menu too deeply because I was having a conversation but I saw that they offer a Veggie Burger in their Skinnylicious menu. It comes with a green salad a light dressing. I am not sure if this is a vegan because of the bread but I made sure no mayo or cheese was added. As for the taste, the veggie burger is really delicious. The texture of the patty is obviously different but very tasty. It does fall apart easily but that was no big deal for me.  The restaurant is always well maintained including the restrooms and the service was very good. Our drinks were always being refilled and our food came out quickly."
Maelynn P.,"Anaheim, CA",277,102,223,4.0,9/13/2017,"Always great service and even better food! I come to this location at least 1-2 times a year for some sort of celebration. Recently, I went for a birthday/gender reveal. I wanted to know if they did anything special for gender reveals so I called ahead. I believe I spoke with Bill, the manager, and he was more than helpful. Unfortunately they don't do anything for gender reveals :( He was willing to put all my belongings in the managers office if I wanted to hide anything.  Food -I'm such a child, aaaand I eat like a child too.. I always order that FRIED MAC N CHEESE BALLS and I'm never disappointed! 4.5/5 -I'm a big fan of their DINNER ROLLS because I love bread... haha 5/5 I've tried so many different of their food items and I have yet to be disappointed :)"
J i m m y L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,14,20,1.0,1/7/2018,"Curbside pickup service totally fails!! Your on hold forever just trying to place your order for pickup. Had to hang up 5 times and recall (Bakery). Once I got there to pickup, they (Bakery) put me on hold forever and they never bothered to pick up the phone again. So I had to walk in and get my food!"
Mary M.,"La Puente, CA",37,19,103,5.0,12/27/2017,"I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in years and had some gift cards so we decided to have lunch here.  The dishes we tried were the New York steak, fish and chips and orange chicken.  All three of us thought the food was great!  I had the fish and chips which came with cole slaw which I usually won't eat but it wasn't loaded down with dressing and was delicious and so was the fish and chips.  I also tasted the orange chicken and that was great too.  The brown bread they bring with the meal was also a hit.  Our server was also nice, polite and attentive.  We are already talking about a return visit!"
Jonathan R.,"Anaheim, CA",14,33,8,5.0,1/8/2018,Came here for happy hour the food was good like always ..can't beat the happy hour burger  the server Stacey was really great  was the best server  I have had in a long time ... happy to come to Cheesecake Factory and have superb workers like Stacey
Eric R.,"Chino Hills, CA",137,47,,5.0,1/5/2018,"The family and I were at the Brea mall shopping. After waiting in several long lines, we decided to eat dinner at the cheesecake factory. After waiting over a hour, we were seated outdoors. All of us felt frustrated and in a bad mood. The entire family was upset and complaining about menu choices and sitting outdoors...... and then a young man named Chou walked up, it seemed like he could feel the tension. His upbeat attitude and happy energy  started to put all of us in a happy mood, as he explained the menu. The food was good, but Chou's excellent customer service is what maid our experience 5 star."
Omar S.,"Anaheim, CA",40,36,8,1.0,11/7/2017,"MGR tonight on 11-5-17 6:51pm was rude and DID not know how to speak to customers. Asked for a different table and his reply was COMPLETELY uncalled for and unprofessional. Don't bark at me for complaining about the crap seating you placed us in. (See photo). He could have taken a different route in dealing with guests but he chose to be rude and disrespectful. I will start going to a different location. 1 Star was for the customer service by the MGR only. Btw managers name is CHRISTOPHER. Customer service skills are needed by this guy so deal with the other MGR's or go to a different location.  Update to above.... food was actually bad. I had that lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish. The chicken seemed like it was microwaved then thrown in a pan of oil to give it some sort of ""grilled"" feel to it. Was really fatty as well. Poor dish, I don't recommend that. To be honest, the only thing I liked, was leaving. That whole night was shot from the beginning. The OTHER manager later took only half our bill off essentially saving us only $50 on the bill. That didn't help. Terrible customer service trumps everything else. Your food could be terrible (like above), but if your customer service is on point then my review would be positive. Wasn't the case. The entire bill should have been comped and we should have been given ""credit"" towards another night. They were being cheap."
Patricia A.,"Anaheim, CA",81,103,136,4.0,12/5/2017,"This place gets 4 stars mostly because of our amazing waitress, Tiana.  Once we were seated for dinner, she distributed menus, got our drink orders in, & brought sliced bananas to appease my daughter.  She was also prompt in serving us our bread (my fave is the brown one) & butter.  When we ordered, we requested that my daughter's food to arrive first and it did.  The rest of our order (mini crab cakes, avocado egg rolls, chicken piccata, steak, & salmon) came fresh & was delicious.  A different server accidentally brought us another appetizer (loaded potato bites), but Tiana let us keep it anyway.  Overall, awesome service & good food as expected for a Cheesecake Factory.  As much as I wanted a cheesecake for dessert, I was too full to order one."
Diego P.,"Anaheim, CA",146,65,,2.0,12/5/2017,"Service was amazing, everything was clean but being a pizza lover I ordered pizza. I've had the worst of the worst to the best of the best pizzas but ultimately I rated Cheesecake Factory with only  a mere 2 stars. So let's rewind and disclose what happen: I ordered their personal size pizza and it reminded me of the good old website ,"" Craigslist"".  We all respect the fact that Craigslist hasn't updated the look of their site in 20 years. They're like if you want to use our shitty website to sell your garbage fine, if not ,""Efh oFF "", we don't care! The same goes with an outdated pizza( Crazy how pizza related to Craigslist). The pizza tasted so Out dated and rubbery It made my stomach hurt after and pretty much ruined my night (consequently me yacking the pizza).It's a shame the pizza was a no-go."
Jeesoun S.,"Cypress, CA",8,64,205,1.0,5/17/2017,"I was tired and felt like having the sweet dessert to comfort me this afternoon. I stopped by the cheesecake factory in Brea mall. I ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake w cafe latte.  As soon as I got in this restaurant and waited for about a minute at the entrance then I felt like vomitting and could smell terrible dirty mop on the floor. The service took a while and I had to wait a lot longer than 20 mins for a dessert. When I went to the restroom and got back to my table, still smells terrible mold around the floor. This is not the first time I had bad service in the dirty restaurant and served w uncooked fish almost half frozen on my Christmas dinner w my husband. Wow!  Totally disgusting....yuck... I pay for the foods but I was treated like a homeless. I won't go back again never...It is done!  End."
Meg K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/3/2018,"TL; DR down below.  There were 2-3 big parties that were arriving shortly after we arrived. We got an estimated wait time of 20 mins for myself and my husband. They handed us a buzzer/pager and we decided to wait inside closer to the entry way. Why? We didn't want to block the walkway for people exiting or block other people from coming in to be with their party or to put their name down for a table. About 30-40 people were waiting to be seated, but we put our names down before they did, had a buzzer, were only two people, and the restaurant was clearing out A LOT of tables anyways. We waited for 45-60 minutes. Did not hear our name and our buzzer did not chime, light up, buzz, or signal to us that we were being called. After seeing all the parties go before us and many others who arrived way later than us, my husband went up to the host desk to ask them what was going on. They said that they had called our names already, but that they would put us at the top of the list for a table and would be about another 5 minutes. We were then FINALLY called by the host, but I asked them why we weren't actually told about our table being ready (buzzer or in person) especially since we were being very courteous to them, other patrons, and I'm pretty sure the fire codes/regulations. The host then apologized and said that sometimes the buzzers don't work... As we were talking, the person (who would later be seating us) didn't get the memo that we were already at the desk trying to get answers as to what happened. We noticed that she was calling for us with a normal volume that would not have reached to anyone unless they were REALY listening near the cheesecake display case and maybe the one seat in the waiting area. She just stood near the host desk, said the name as if she were talking normally, and gave up. No walking closer to the guests waiting near the entry way...no walking in general...  She gave up after saying our name three times because we ""didn't arrive"" and told the host that we were a ""no show"" all annoyed. The host then had to break it to her that we were already right here... A considerable amount of people have now left the restaurant and there were still about 7 people waiting to be seated. She tries to quickly change her attitude to a cheery one and sat us in a booth. We tried to forget the whole ordeal because who wants to ruin date night? However, as we were in the middle of us being seated, a waitress then complains to this person in front of us behind our booth's tiny pillar. We hear every word and this lasted for a minute or two. The person then says that a waitress will be right with us. It took 15 minutes for that waitress to come by to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. We asked for water and gave her our order right away. She came back with the waters and our bread. Our crab bites came sometime later after we had already finished half of our bread. So maybe 10-15 minutes after we ordered? No offer on any bread refills throughout the entire time. Our entree food arrived 45 minutes after we were seated, 30 minutes after we ordered because of that 15 minute wait time with our waitress.  The food at the time was good, but this entire experience wasn't. We basically complained to each other the entire meal about how this whole experience was basically about 2 hours waiting for food. I also opened my leftovers today and saw that they had my asparagus heads sticking out of the take out box when there's clearly room for it to be entirely in the box and a 2 inch white hair on top of/slightly embedded in my mashed potatoes... TL;DR: Don't trust the buzzers/pagers. Don't trust hearing your name unless you camp out near the host desk. Don't be surprised to see staff drama/attitude. Don't expect to be seen at a reasonable time after being seated. Expect the food to be okay-good, but if you get a takeout box, ask if you could pack it yourself. If they do it, don't be surprised to find extra unwanted things or bad packaging.  If any of this happens to you at the restaurant, demand to talk to someone right away. Don't think the bad experience will turn around because it likely it won't. We didn't complain right away for this reason and because we didn't want to spend any more time than we already had there."
Dave D.,"Victorville, CA",34,39,300,4.0,10/10/2017,Service is there but no personal touch what so ever just factory would be. Food ok... al dented​  they. Really know how .. Firm to the tooth  Over all  over priced  . Food decent.service ditto  My review is over unless desert kicks its up.  Son had fish n chips quality control. No
Franco M.,"Downey, CA",80,332,246,5.0,3/3/2017,"The Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger really hit the spot! Had some really good bacon and the patty was well seasoned. The bun wasn't soggy at all. The cheese was perfectly melted. It was accompanied by some crispy, salty fries. It was an excellent meal and I can't wait to come back and try something else.  Out of the three main dishes I tried I liked all three. Tried the burger, some pasta, and chicken tenders. The tomato based pasta sauce tasted home made and the chicken was good quality, though a bit under-seasoned. Still very good with the BBQ dipping sauce though. Just don't like ordering bland items and having to resort to sauces to enjoy it. Should be good on its own and the sauce should be there for a kick if desired in my opinion. Didn't like the dessert. We went with their Dulce De Leche cheesecake, but it tasted like caramel. Big difference! Next time I'm picking the Original! Best burger I've had all year! Thought the location and service was also great. Loved my experience here. Pros: + Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger + Pasta sauce (tomato based) + Great Service + Nice location Cons: - Chicken tenders could have been a bit more seasoned - Caramel cheesecake"
Ronald W.,"Anaheim, CA",241,67,65,5.0,8/5/2017,"Awesome place! Came here for the national cheesecake day which means it's half off on al cheesecakes here. Really nice interior design more of an Egyptian style architecture style. We came in during a busy Saturday lunch. They have really good turnover rate, so we only waited for 20 minutes for table of 5! Here's what we ordered: Miso salmon Grande burrito Da Vinci pasta Chicken alfredo pasta Chocolate dream whole cheesecake Awesome place to dine in especially their lunch special. Miso salmon is a must try here!"
Danna T.,"Cerritos, CA",194,63,318,4.0,3/9/2017,"*TIP: They only take reservations from 11a-11:30a. WEIRD! I never heard of such a thing. Can someone please confirm that for me? Thank you in advance! I love Cheesecake Factory! Their menu is endless!! I kid you not, their menu probably has 15 pages minimum lol. Anyways, I go for their pasta because they honestly have the best pasta dishes. AND THEIR BREAD! I love their bread!! Apparently they just released a new specialty menu last week, so we were able to try some of their new dishes!  I ordered a Peach Bellini blended for my drink and my bf got a Whiskey Smash (*strong!). Both drinks were really good! Sweet and fruity.  For starters, my bf and I ordered the avocado egg rolls and the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks. The egg rolls were okay -- the avocado to egg roll ratio was too much. I thought it had a little too much avocado. The truffle grilled cheese were good! I loved how they put whole strips of bacon instead of pieces of it. As for my main dish, I first ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I'm never picky with my food, but this dish was really sweet for my liking. I was hoping for a more savory chipotle flavor, but it was definitely not the case. As much as I was embarrassed to ask if I could change my dish, Lou was super nice about changing it for me anyway. (super plus!!) He let me change my dish to Pasta Nepolitana, one of their new specialties and Bo0o0O0o0o0YYY this was soo good! I loved it so much, it is a must try!!  Shoutout to Lou for giving the best service! Super patient and understanding. I would definitely come back to this location."
T W.,"Long Beach, CA",0,12,,3.0,1/8/2018,"The staff is literally awesome to be able to work through crowds that gather in the lobby around the desert and pick-up area. My complaint is it needs somebody to rope it into an area for people to line up go to the counter and direct to a waiting area to be called back at the counter or a screen alerting the order is ready.  A trampling herd needs  some sort of organization.  It seems overwhelming to the customer, counter people and those pushing to get seated."
Ken S.,"Brea, CA",0,44,,2.0,11/29/2017,"Wish I could give this a better rating because I go here so often but there are a few things to note about this particular location. 1. The food. I always order the same thing every time, a pasta dish. But no matter when I go, it always tastes different. It's great, don't get me wrong. But it's inconsistent. Sometimes it's spicy, sometimes it's light, sometimes it's rather tasteless. But I crave that pasta dish, so I continue to eat here. 2. The servers (for the most part) Many of them seem to hate their jobs. I get it though, serving in the food industry is one of the most stressful jobs but man, it's obviously difficult for some to maintain a smile or even a positive attitude. The service is hit or miss. 3. The food runners. Some in particular are just the worst. They just leave the food and go... there's no proper manners or simple respect. Not even a ""enjoy your meal"" or ""can I get anything else for you?"" It's just very cold and almost insulting; as if we are dogs getting fed kibble. It's pretty lame and I guarantee many people feel the same. I get it though, they have other orders to take care of, but it's not rocket science to have a positive attitude and treat customers with respect. Also, if you order a pasta dish, don't expect them to ask you if you need shredded Parmesan cheese. They don't care and you won't get it unless you wait there for an hour trying to flag down a server."
Jennifer F.,"Irvine, CA",283,90,735,5.0,12/26/2016,"From start to finish Cheesecake Factory sure won't disappoint. I've been here multiple times and this diner always has excellent service for a chain. The salads here are unique and tasty. The wait is never too long for a table, and the servers here always instantly start your table off with a lovely bread basket. The brown bread is super tasty. From pastas to salads, to kids pizzas, Cheesecake Factory is sure to leave your tummy nice and satisfied. Located conveniently adjacent to the brea mall, this is a perfect dine in spot after your long treacherous day shopping. Sometimes shoppers can be a bit cut throat, maybe it's because they are a little peckish and hungry.   Jaunt on over to the Cheesecake Factory if your looking for decent service, tasty unique eats, and a satisfying dinner. The mood is pretty casual, and there is a lovely little patio if you'd like to dine outdoors. Try the cake, it's really bomb."
Brandon G.,"Tucson, AZ",129,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,The last 2 times I had ate at this place I had ordered the cashew chicken and I had gotten food poisoning. I had just ate it tonight and immediately got sick again. I am never eating here again. They are terribly slow waiters and the service is awful. I expect more of a chain restaurant like this place. Both me and my mother are sick to our stomachs. NEVER EAT HERE. I would rather eat at Lazy Dog or God awful Red Robin.  Two thumbs DOWN for The Shitcake Factory.
Carmela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,63,67,4.0,11/3/2017,"Customer service was great! From the nice hostess that sat us down to the server Vitality that waited on us. Service was great. Food was not as great as they messed up on my dad's order. They forgot his avocado, overcooked his meat. They gave him cabbage instead of lettuce haha. The good thing is that everyone else's order was good!"
Sam W.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Food here is hit or miss. More misses.  How can you get the Evelyn pasta screwed up? The broccoli was not stirred fry with the pasta, rather the broccoli that is a side dish was thrown to one side of the plate."
Daniel A.,"Anaheim, CA",208,208,98,5.0,11/3/2017,"the cheesecake factory is one of my family's favorite restaurants.  the place is super popular so invariably the parking is a little challenging. the restaurant is quite large and attracts lots of customers. so what i am trying to tell you is be prepared for the crowds and the wait.  once you are seated, you will experience pleasant waiters, delicious food and a relaxed atmosphere.  the menu is too big and has choices for every kind of eater. but whatever you do eat a light meal because you will want to have some dessert.  i typically go with the lettuce wraps and save room forr a slice of cheesecake.  i recommend this restaurant!"
Gloria C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",29,103,263,4.0,6/20/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory sure knows how to do it - their food has been stellar every time I've come here, and the servers are exceptional! They do their best to cater to your needs, whether it be with food or anything else, and always have a smile on their face. Their portions are HUGE - I got full off a salad to the point that I didn't have enough room for a slice of cheesecake (which are also all phenomenal). What does occasionally worry me mid-meal is the amount of calories in everything they have (salads often are almost, if not over, 1000 calories), and their cheesecakes are over 1000 calories for 1 slice, but these thoughts have never actually stopped me from stuffing my face.  This place can get pretty crowded on special occasions (e.g. holidays, graduations, etc), so be sure to plan accordingly. If you don't care where you eat (either inside or outside), you can tell them and it should speed up the wait time too. Overall, a worthy choice for either lunch or dinner!"
Julie L.,"La Mirada, CA",19,37,30,5.0,8/22/2017,I love this location because of its proximity to the mall and just the overall service I get each time I'm there. I have not had a negative experience and don't believe I will due to their standards.  Of course we get cheesecake every time and we always enjoy it. We tend to lean towards chocolate flavors and it never disappoints.  Their strawberry shortcake is so good too. It's one to try if you're not in the mood for cheesecake.
Henry L.,"Buena Park, CA",26,41,8,2.0,12/18/2017,"Went on a Wednesday night in which the restaurant was somewhat busy. Service was definitely on the poor side, as we constantly had to wave down the server. The calamari appetizer was very salty. The main dishes, both pasta, had about half a chicken breast (if that). It's sad but this is the why we visit chain restaurants less and less. After a $70 dinner, and a poor experience, we probably won't be returning for quite a while. Good luck and I'm sure they will continue to stay busy, but I'd rather support the local mom and pop restaurants, who actually care for their customers."
Lynette N.,"San Dimas, CA",74,31,9,1.0,9/24/2017,"I just had dinner at this place with my family and I've never been more disappointed... After agreeing to wait 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated along with 2 other groups of people.. Everyone's orders were taken and everyones food came out at the time, except for ours. We waited a good amount of time before asking about our food and when we finally did, the server rudely told us the other tables got their food before us because they were seated and ordered before us which was a complete lie.. On top of all that, we learned she never put our order in so she lied and made a mistake - I can look beyond the mistake but the rudeness and lie are unacceptable.  Overall, the service was horrible and the quality of the food was too.. The Cheesecake Factory used to be a decent place to eat but it is overpriced, the quality of the food is no good and the service isn't either. I highly recommend you do not waste your time and money at this restaurant.  One star because zero stars isn't an option."
Justin H.,"Orange County, CA",416,177,1097,5.0,5/26/2017,"To me, The Cheesecake Factory is one of those few chain restaurants that are tried and true. They consistently serve wonderful foods that are of great quality. It tells you something about a restaurant that has been around for ages and yet still attracts crowds and crowds of people every weekend! I actually tried something a bit different from my usual dishes. I tried the baja chicken tacos. The tacos were actually really really good, and I love that the tacos were homemade. This time I did not get a cheesecake, but um... must I really talk about the amazing cheesecakes that the Cheesecake Factory makes? I think it goes without saying that they make some awesome cheesecakes!"
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,5.0,5/23/2017,"The bread - It's amazing, soft, and delicious. I wish I didn't have to share with everyone else at the table but since you can always ask for more, I'm more okay with sharing. =D The menu here is overwhelming and extensive. There's a lot going on but they also all sound really good! Here are my recommendations: Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: It's seriously really good. If you like anything garlic and caramelized onions, then this is for you.  Strawberry lemonade: The cup has a rim of sugar so it must be good! I'm joking but really, the strawberry lemonade is pretty amazing and I inhaled it.  Red velvet cheesecake: Every time I take a bite, I'm crying inside because of pure happiness. It's SO Good!"
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,4.0,6/25/2017,"So we went to Cheesecake Factory for an early lunch as business called.  We got there right when they opened to avoid the crush of people.  THe crush came about 15 minutes after we arrived.  and within 30 minutes, the place was packed.  I was shocked. That being said, we were sat promptly and our server was great and very attentive.  We kinda customized our order and she nailed every item on our order so it was done the way we wanted.  That was really great to see. We had the bread served with our appetizer.  The dark bread is really tasty.  However, when will  restaurants know that people do not like ice cubes for butter.  You cannot spread it as it rips your bread to shreds.  There is no excuse for that.  So, as usual we had to smash the butter underneath our plates to make it so we could use it.  Very annoying. The Fried zucchini was honestly one of the best flavored zucchini I have ever had.  Great flavor on all fronts and I wanted so much more. The salads were prepared as we like them and no, we did not have any frogs in them (sorry BJ's) thank god!  LOL The entrees came and oh my goodness, the portions are very large.  Absolutely shareable portions.  We had the eggplant parmesan with the spaghetti with a nice pesto sauce.  THe sauce was on point and the pasta was done nicely.  So, we were off to a pretty good start. To finish off, we had the Strawberry Cheesecake.  I asked for extra strawberries.  Needless to say I was very surprised that I was served eight very large strawberries.  It was a nice touch and we all ate until we were very full. So, I was pleasantly surprised by this visit.  The service was a 5, the overall food was a 4 and the overall experience was a very high 4.  That butter thing, just bugs the heck out of me.  LOL. Needless to say, this place serves good food and the menu has a huge variety and something for everyone.  Go during the off hours or you will be with the crush of people.  I would absolutely recommend this location."

You also seem to get better service in here. When I sat down the server came right over and got the drink order. I did get my appetizer order in to. When I got my dinner order in I was ready to go. The appetizer came out and Wow, it was like the normal size and not a happy hour size. The price is half for happy hour.  The dinner came out and it was so good. Perfectly cooked Salmon. The potatoes and broccoli was great to.  The service here is always great!! the place is always clean and well taken care of. The parking is easy even when you have to fight Christmas shoppers.  Well lit area. Easy entrance.  5 stars for this visit!  Way to go Cheesecake Factory!!"

There was a total of 18 of us. The service was spot on! I have to give Lilly, our server, a giant HIGH FIVE, for the fantastic job she did! Thank you for making our Christmas Dinner run so smoothly. Food was awesome, as usual. Dessert, well... what can I say? It was fabulous. Thanks to all st staff that helped Lilly make this event so successful. We will definitely be back! Thanks for the good eats."
Tammy L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",32,122,72,2.0,7/23/2017,"Came for some dessert after dinner and of course had some cheesecake! Always delicious and great for a special occasion.  The service from the start was bad, no one acknowledged us for about 10 minutes, then the blonde hostess was really snappy and rude with us. Our server was really sweet though so she saved us from walking out at that point.. the whipped cream tasted expired and the silverware had dried food on all of it. the forks and spoons, it was disgusting. We had to take the food to go because I felt disgusted.  Does the dishwasher in the back need a refresher course in how to use the soap and sanitizer?"

Elaine X.,"Chino Hills, CA",145,55,47,5.0,10/8/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is such a consistent chain restaurant. Great for celebrations or just casual dinners! This is my favorite location and here are a few items on the menu I recommend: Egg Roll Sampler: Great appetizer to share and good pairing sauces. Artichoke Dip: Great starter as well, they give you a ton of dip! Really rich flavor! Pasta Napoletana: My favorite pasta dish in the entire world. So rich and yummy. Asian Pear Martini: My favorite drink on the menu, fruity but also strong. Crisp flavor. Overall, I'm here frequently and the food is always great. This location does a good job of keeping the quality in each dish consistent across different visits. When it gets busy, the wait can be a little long for your food but the bread they provide keeps me satisfied. I have always experienced amazing service here. All the servers are experienced, knowledgeable, and patient. Definitely a happy regular!"
Derek Y.,"Chino Hills, CA",90,38,30,4.0,10/12/2017,"Standard cheesecake factory. I never really come here for food, just their cheesecakes. Whenever I crave something super sweet I would probably come here and try one of their many flavors of cheesecakes and cakes. It is hard to finish one slice at once because it's so rich, but soo good. The down side about their cheesecakes though is the price. Bruh almost $10 per slice for one of their special cheesecakes slices. Cheesecake:3.5/5 Price:"
