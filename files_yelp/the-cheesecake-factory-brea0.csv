Great service. In n out within 1 hour. Great quality food, prices are in the medium range ($15-$25 per plate). Good location, right next to Brea Mall. Must try next time: Kobe burger, red velvet cheesecake"
Sam R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",7,31,3,5.0,3/2/2017,"Outside of the wait time this one is one of my favorite locations.  Great for an intimate date night and happy hour. Great food, service, apps,drinks."
Amy L.,"Santa Monica, CA",347,4,1,5.0,2/14/2017,"One of the best Birthday dinners for my mom, she was overjoyed by the excellent service! Shout out to Chou for being the best server and being so attentive and not to mention he's adorable. Definitely coming back here!"
Karen A.,"La Mirada, CA",49,3,,2.0,7/30/2017,"Everyone always raves about this restaurant. We were going for a birthday with 7 people so we knew it would be quite pricey. I was very excited because i had been here twice years ago but could not remember much except how terrribly loud this restaurant is. Luckily, we were seated in the back in a big booth so we were able to carry on a conversation. By the way, the wait was an hour. They don't take reservations.     The appetizers were good. We had an artichoke, avacado egg rolls and a chicken taquito. The drinks from the bar were good. It was the main courses that were not up to my expectations. My daughter ordered the Hibachi steak, whick she has had many times. It was so overcooked she said it tasted like beef jerky. My husbands Filet Mignon was okay , a little overcooked also, but had a big chunk of gristle in the middle. I got a combo with Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. The shrimp were flavorless except for the sauce. I didn't care for whatever herbs they put on salmon so scraped them off. My other daughters had Pineapple Shrimp and Chicken. I tasted a shrimp and it was flavorful but hard as a rock. I won't go back to this restaurant again. Just another hyped up chain."
Kate B.,"Brea, CA",2,57,6,2.0,1/22/2017,Food is good but I'm going to vomit.  The busboy is sweeping the floor with the most undesirable pile of dirt and instead of using a dust pan he is just pushing it across the floor.   He's even sweeping under my feet!   This is soooooo gross.  I've never seen a pile so dirty!
Tiffany L.,"Walnut, CA",905,346,695,3.0,6/5/2015,"SEAFOOD IS NOT FRESH!!!!!  Today I came in for brunch with my family and we ordered about 4 dishes and 2 of them had shrimp in it. The shrimp sandwich and the cajun jambalaya pasta. Although there wasn't a lot of shrimp in both dishes, but I can certainly tell you it was not fresh at all.  Personally, I'm more sensitive to UN-FRESH seafood, so my body can tell. I will get small bumps and rashes or my throat will feel itchy. You might be thinking ""hey she's probably allergic to shellfish?"" SORRY I AM NOT! I guess you can say I am allergic to cheap and not fresh shellfish? Than yes I guess I will agree with you! Anyways, we got the avocado egg roll, cobb salad, shrimp sandwich, and cajun jambalaya pasta.  The cobb salad was delish as usual!  This was our first time ordering the avo egg roll, it looked really good in the picture, but honestly it is not worth that $11, esp when the egg roll skin is so thick and I think there are better egg roll skin to choose from like the clear rice paper ones.  The shrimp sandwich, had wayy too much mayo or whatever and not enough shrimp and the tomato slices were ginormous!! Not a well made sandwich.  As for the pasta, it tasted good, but I thought it needed a little bit more sauce and i think there was only 3-4 tiny shrimps!!!  Sigh -___- did I just pay $18 for mediocre pasta LOL. So basically our bill was like $75; I think thats wayyy to much esp if there wasnt even any alcohol or dessert in our bill We all know that their cheesecake is obviously delicious! And their complementary bread lol"
Daniel S.,"Walnut, CA",68,7,2,4.0,7/26/2015,"There's only one thing you should ever order here. CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. That's it! Not steak or pasta. Just CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. I'm typically not a fan of American cuisine because I really prefer Asian food but the gumbo at Cheesecake Factory is amazing.  The gumbo has tender chicken, shrimp, and sausage drowned in a thick, creamy sauce that's filled with great spices. A bed of rice sits on top of the gumbo which soaks up all that flavor from the gumbo. Also, DON'T ORDER STEAK HERE!! They just can't seem to get it right. I came here with my family, and my cousin ordered her steak to be medium rare. It came out way past well done. She asked the waiter to have it remade. For the second time it came back WELL DONE. The meat looked as dry as the California drought. The manager then came out to ask her if she wanted to get something else which my cousin did do. One great thing about American restaurants is their customer service. You can't get that kind of service at any Chinese restaurant. The manager let my cousin get a new dish free of charge, and then she took the steak off the bill. She basically got three free meals! .   Lastly, the rye bread they serve here is the best bread I've ever had. You can really get caught up in eating more and more bread as you wait for the food. It's so ADDICTING. It has a subtle sweet flavor  Tip: Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations but if you have a big party you can try coming half an hour to an hour earlier to get them to prepare a setting for your group at the time you want. They're very accommodating!"
Eric J.,"Anaheim, CA",110,2,1,5.0,2/16/2017,"First visit here the food was delicious. I had the Parmesan Alfredo w/Chicken Pasta & a Tropical Smoothie! After, I tried the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake"
Deez N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,3,,1.0,2/16/2017,They were out of cheesecake and then one of the employees flirted with my boyfriend and made him break up with me it was the saddest night of my life and to top it off they gave me the wrong order I am never coming back and I am also 3 month pregnant
Debbie C.,"Fullerton, CA",12,4,3,4.0,8/14/2016,"I came here for the first time with my seven-year-old daughter. I thought I would try something new. I thought I would try the wild mushroom soup. My daughter ordered a cheese pizza. The wild mushroom soup is the best mushroom soup I have ever had. Probably one of the only ones I've ever had, but it made me a believer that you're never too old to try something new. It had a real deep, rich, meaty robust flavor. It was excellent.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out extra cheesy and she loved it.  My 4 star is based on the soup and the friendly staff. On another note, I was upset by the fact that you are allowed to bring animals inside a restaurant. Apparently, all you have to say it's a service animal and the staff are trained not to question. There was a lady who was 60+/-,  who was well dressed and appears to be of some wealth, came in with a poodle inside of carrier.  The dog carrier did have a tag showing it was an ""emotional"" service animal. REALLY!!!!   I can see having a service animal if someone is blind or perhaps suffering from PTSD.  I, for one, do not want hair, pet dander , nor seeing poop or pee while I'm trying to eat my meal.  The lady did agree to eat outside."
Dee J.,"Bellflower, CA",0,7,4,1.0,10/15/2016,"Let me start off this review by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory. If I can eat there everyday, I would. This is the first time I've visited the location in Brea and it definitely will be my last. Customer service was horrendous. Our complimentary bread was extremely late... so late, that it arrived a few minutes before our entrees arrived.  Second of all, they got my order wrong and they had to send it back to the kitchen. My husband wanted to wait to eat his food until my food came out so we can enjoy our dinner together, but it would have been cold since I had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Third of all, we ordered low carb cheesecakes to end the night and wait for it.... our waitress said it was FROZEN. So we can wait an hour for it to be ready or take home FROZEN CHEESECAKE.  We came to Cheesecake Factory for the  cheesecake. Needless to say the manager, Joey, was useless when we called to complain about our dinner. Our Saturday date night dinner was ruined. The least they can do was comp a part of our meal for the inconvenience, nope. Nada. Paid full price for awful service. Go to a different location to enjoy your dinner, like Cerritos or Irvine."
Danielle T.,"Brea, CA",30,27,,1.0,6/9/2017,"The last two times I have come here, food and service have been sorely lacking. Last night it seemed like our server was spread way to thin and had tables inside and outside. We were seated near a heat lamp and promised it would be warm, but the side of the table that was not next to the heat lamp was freezing. We ordered the salmon rolls and kale salad to start. When they came out the salad did not come out with the modifications I had requested. It took our server over 10 minutes to come check on us and I sent the salad back. The food was delivered about 10 minutes later and the salad had still not come back out. We asked for boxes when the dinner was delivered because it was just too cold. After we had eaten a bit of our food and boxed the rest up, the salad had finally come out and I asked if our server could just box it for us. Our server brought the boxed up food back with the check and said, ""I'm sorry I didn't realize you were in a hurry."" And just walked away rather than asking if anything was wrong. We paid and left and we were charged for the salad. I myself would have told a manager how long the salad had taken and asked them to take it off of the bill. When we got home we realized that there was hardly any dressing on the salad, hardly any sauce on the lemon garlic shrimp, and the steak medallions came with hardly any meat. This Cheesecake Factory use to be on point, but now I cant see myself ever coming back."
Vernon C.,"Whittier, CA",158,2,,3.0,2/3/2017,"A 3 star. Service and food decent. Honoring our military,  -ZERO-. Waited over an hour to be seated with my love in a small spot surrounded by small children.... I thought restaurants take into consideration seating for couples and family... I am a family man so not against kiddos just when I'm out with my Lovely lady would like a seating arrangement a little more adult. Thanks for the meal but will find  a place that honors Marines and is concerned with the clientele and not the mass."
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,2.0,12/17/2016,"Ate here last Saturday and they were crazy busy. One thing you expect from CF is consistency and tonight there was none. Our two favorites:  Chicken Madeira, the potatoes were completely cold and hard a hard ""skin"" on them from sitting out waiting for the chicken I guess. Chicken Bellagio, nearly the same, the pasta was stone cold. I guess their assembly line was out of whack. It was very disappointing and since they were so busy, getting our servers attention was non-existent."
Jake K.,"Whittier, CA",176,12,1,5.0,12/30/2016,Went the other day with my family and we had Marak M as our server!! He was amazing!! He even brought my daughter a chocolate when we sat down because she was being fussy!! Super attentive and great service on a busy night!!! The food was great but the service was even better!!!!
Michael L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,10,24,2.0,4/5/2016,"My mother is computer illiterate so she asked me to post this for her.  =D She went there today for lunch with my grandmother.  She ordered off the all day breakfast menu and got a bagel.  The bagel was ROCK HARD, chip your tooth hard.  She never complains but this time she pointed it out to the waitress.  The waitress just said, ""Oh, we don't sell a lot of bagels so we freeze them."" and that's it.  The manager came by later and said the same thing, ""It's hard because we don't sell a lot.  We have them for Sunday brunch and then we freeze them.""  And that was it.  Morale of the story:  Cheesecake Factory employees hate bagels, puppies, children, and veterans."
Mark T.,"La Verne, CA",103,53,60,5.0,12/28/2016,"Great service as always and great atmosphere. We went for happy hour and got the new happy hour hot dog with mushrooms, avocado portobello and zucchini fries, and nachos. The zucchini and mushrooms were delicious and a must to try. The sauces went well with them as well. Overall great experience at an affordable price."
Richard N.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/14/2017,Long wait!!!! 2 plus hours. I'll update you on the food and service if I'm still hungry. No where to sit while waiting. Some one should  take a look at the wait time.  Thank you.
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,3/28/2015,"Not being a lover of chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones one it comes to the food. The long waits, however are insane, the food is not that good. We came here for happy hour and I have to say it was much better than I thought it would be. Prices are great, we thought the portions must be small, so we ordered a ton to share for the table. I should have known with their usually massive portions that happy hour portions are what is a regular portion in other restaurants, plenty. So we totally overate, but the quality and presentation was pretty nice, service was ok and we we lucky and didn't have to wait long since we sat in the bar area. Not in a rush to go back, but nicer than I thought."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,4/7/2015,"I met up with two of my friends for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) recently on a Sunday around 6:30 p.m. For a regular March evening, the eatery was pretty crowded--more crowded than I had expected--but the hostess told me that the wait for three was only 15-20 minutes. I got my buzzer and waited for my friends, who came later, but it worked find because I think we ended up waiting about 25 minutes total.   We were quickly ushered to our table once our turn came to be seated, but I was grateful for one of the booths toward the back of the restaurant -- away from the loud hustle and bustle of the front. Our server was friendly enough, asking for our drink orders and bringing bread right away. She didn't check up on us too much throughout the evening--only once right after our meals came (we hardly had the chance to dig in and maybe one more for drink refills--but we didn't really see her again until we were ready for our check. However, we were really wrapped up in our conversation anyway, so it was fine not to be bothered.   I usually get the ""Grilled Cheese"" sandwich (that's no longer on the menu) or the ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"" (one of the Glamburgers), but I felt like trying something different. My two friends hadn't been to TCF for dinner in a while, too, so it was a night for us to try entrees that were different from our usuals.   I was pleased with my sando and would definitely order it again. Despite the restaurant feeling busy, we had a great leisurely dinner and didn't feel like we were being rushed out of there. This is still one of my favorite CF locations ... definitely a convenient place to hit up if you're ever in the Brea/Fullerton area.   Here's what we got:   ""Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich"": I love crispy chicken (though grilled chicken is healthier), and I love the slight spice from buffalo sauce, so this sandwich was right up my alley. It featured crispy coated chicken breast covered in melted cheese and your choice of spicy buffalo or chipotle mayo sauce. It was served on a brioche bun and accompanied by French Fries or a green salad. I asked our server if the buffalo sauce was really spicy, and she reassured me that it wasn't and that she preferred that sauce. I was so glad that I ordered it! The sauce had a slight kick, but it was definitely fine for me to handle and I didn't feel like my mouth was burning for the entire evening. I didn't touch the onion and tomato that also came with my sandwich; it had enough flavor in of itself. I also opted for French fries ... I love the fries from TCF because they're thicker and always well-salted! The chicken's interior was tender and soft, and I enjoyed the sufficiently crispy exterior. Since I had a huge lunch, I ate half my sandwich--but downed all of my fries--and savored each and every bite.   ""Veggie Burger"": My friend's a vegetarian but had never tried the veggie burger, so she decided to give TCF's version a go. This ""burger"" was made with brown rice, farro, couscous, mushrooms, black beans and onions. It came on a toasted bun with melted Fontina cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. My friend took the onion out of her ""burger,"" but said that the combo was actually very good. She especially liked the blend of the brown rice, couscous and melted cheese (gotta love that Fontina). She also ordered her meal with fries and said she would definitely order it again. Like me, she's a sucker for those addictive fries from TCF.   ""California Omelette"": My friend's husband felt like ordering breakfast for dinner, so he opted for one of the omelettes. This one came with avocado, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, garlic, shallots, sour cream and Jack and Swiss cheeses. It also came with a choice of starch (I believe), so he opted for toast (instead of potatoes, which is what I would have ordered). The omelette was a decent size and it came with four halves of toast (so two pieces of toast cut in half). My friend's hubby said the omelette was delicious--it sported lots of gooey, melted cheese, and he liked the flavors and textures from the mushrooms, garlic and avocado. This isn't an omelette I would order personally because there are too many ingredients that I don't like, but it's a good option for those who love avocados and mushrooms (there are plenty of other omelettes I would choose instead, if I felt like ordering breakfast for dinner).   ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": I ALWAYS have to get cheesecake if I'm dining at this place--no matter how full I am--so I ordered a cheesecake to go. I always debate between the ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"" or ""Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple,"" but the Reese's version won out on this particular trip. I love both cheesecakes, but I was just craving those peanut butter cups. This cheesecake features chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in the ""Original"" cheesecake, with layers of moist, delicious fudge cake and caramel."
