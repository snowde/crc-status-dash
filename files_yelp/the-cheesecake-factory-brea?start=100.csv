Jason G.,"Long Beach, MS",0,1,,2.0,11/10/2017,"Service was slow and when the food did come, it came out one plate at a time. I had the spicy cashew chicken. It was burnt chicken and bland sauce. Disappointing, especially after waiting for an hour for the food to arrive after ordering. The others in my group thought there food was ok, but nothing special."
Mike L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",83,1291,17,2.0,1/15/2017,ive experienced a lot better service at other Cheesecake Factories.  We asked 2 different servers 3 times for straws and halfway through our lunch we finally got them. The burger was good but the bread was completely soaked and couldn't pick up. good thing is we wont have to comeback to this location
Rick S.,"Anaheim, CA",59,170,275,4.0,11/13/2016,"To start off. It's a beautiful restaurant and the outdoor sitting is very nice, our waitress was great and she knew the menu, it's a very full menu form pasta to Mexican food and the deserts, there are so much to choose from.  I has the fish and chips.  The portion was large and it tasted great. This Cheesecake factory is just outside of the mall.  Parking can be hard during Christmas time."
Ari H.,"Riverside, CA",138,23,52,4.0,5/22/2016,"I came here with my family on May 22 at 11am. We had to make a reservation a week prior because the restaurant is always crowded. We were seated immediately; our waitress was prompt to bring us the menu and get the order for drinks.  Food- Honestly, the food is medicore. The portions are big, but so are the prices! I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta because everyone was raving about it, but it didn't impress me. It's tasty, but it's not something to rave about.  Service- Our waitress was great. She was prompt with our food and orders. She was also kind to children.  Inside- There are a lot of tables and booths. The interior is beautifully decoated.  Price- Your wallet will cry tears of emptiness. :,( Verdict- Come here for special ocasions and make sure to make reservations."
Randy B.,"Norwalk, CA",1,38,53,4.0,2/23/2017,First time here and the atmosphere is really nice. Food was good and the prices are OK...Kinda overpriced for what it is but I guess it's typical for an  American spot. Strawberry lemonade and Banana cream Cheesecake were really good also I recommend those for sure.
Sharise R.,"Riverside, CA",91,17,1,1.0,6/14/2017,"I love Happy Hour at Cheesecake but my server, Michelle S. , was so rude. I asked for extra cheese on my nachos because they have been skimpy with the cheese lately and she claims that they did put it on there but I had plain chips on the bottom. She then said ""oh well there's nothing that I can do about it, tough luck"" I'm not trying to cheat anyone or get more cheese but if I say they didn't put extra cheese then they didn't. As a server you should try to help me with the problem instead but NOOOO!! She wants to be rude!"
Stephanie T.,"Placentia, CA",103,81,143,4.0,6/19/2016,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I enjoy how consistent the food is any location you go to. The red velvet cheesecake and the Oreo are my favorites! Absolutely to die for! It can get busy and the service can be slow at times, but if you are looking for somewhere to splurge on the calories then this is definitely the best place to do it."
Esther Y.,"Buena Park, CA",99,381,1111,1.0,10/22/2016,"I haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory in the longest time. I used to always go to the Glendale (Americana) location, but ever since I've moved to the OC area, I haven't gone. Today, I came to this location and I was incredibly SO disappointed and shocked at how salty the food was and how horrible the service was.  I basically had 5 different waiters because the first, original waiter never came back to my table and she only came to put down my order and of course give the paycheck. It's like she expected me to tip her for doing absolutely nothing. LOL. It was frustrating trying to get every server's attention because literally no one came to my table. I asked for an extra plate, more bread, and a water refill SO many times and it took literally forever. I had to ask a worker who was cleaning up the table, he wasn't even a server and he seemed to do a better job than the actual waiters. And another thing that bothered me was the first female waiter. She seemed like she looked down on me because she was very rude the short time she served my table and when I asked for more bread she went off to her male waiter friend and pointed at my table and held the bread basket up, and they both chuckled. It was very demeaning and I felt very offended. And the worst part, she never brought me my bread. And so I asked her male waiter friend for more bread and he went off to her and told her and they laughed again. I don't know what was up with those two, but I ended up just leaving because I was just so offended. Never coming back here. Also, the extra plate they gave me was super gross. It had food marks and it was just nasty. Seriously worst experience.  I got the 1. Barbecue ranch chicken salad ($14.95): comes w/ avocado, tomato, grill corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine w/ all tossed with BBQ ranch dressing. Topped w/ thin crispy fried onion rings. It was surprisingly pretty sweet and not the same as before. I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was way too much.  2. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($15.95): comes w/ penne pasta, honey glazed chicken, asparagus, red and yellow peppers, peas, garlic and onion in a spicy chipotle Parmesan cream sauce. This was very salty and not as good as I expected. The asparagus was the best part. Overall I'd give this a 1.5/5.  Oh btw, I went around 11:30 AM and I got the lunch size plates and they were both smaller and cheaper! I'm never coming back to this location because of the horrible service and this location just seems to have all the food wrong."
Jenny F.,"La Habra, CA",75,11,2,4.0,8/18/2017,"I absolutely love coming here, all of their cheesecakes are so delicious. In addition, I love to get the crusted chicken Romano, I'm a sucker for Crispy thin chicken.  Tonight me and my boyfriend went and got the fried Mac and cheese, it was heaven, so much flavor and it came on a light crazy marinara sauce. Taste like a mozzarella stick but even better. On the downside the Cheesecake Factory can be loud at night and can get pricy. But if you want good food go here."
Alison M.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",1,16,2,5.0,12/10/2016,"We were pretty brave to come out on a Saturday night whilst many were out Christmas shopping at the mall but we figured, ""What the heck, we want cheesecake!"" I just have to say a big THANK YOU to Marcus who helped us and was literally one of the most attentive table servers we have ever experienced. Not only was Marcus chill on this busy night, he gave plenty of time for us to choose drinks (there were 7 of us), remembered when the kiddos swapped spots, refilled and check in on our food, let us order more food and took time at the end to share details on all dessert options! His friendly smile, patience and kindness will be remembered.  Oh and the food was pretty awesome too- that Nutella hazelnut cheesecake is something amazing!"
Benita G.,"La Habra, CA",0,26,,5.0,8/9/2017,"Food is great! Great chessecake, Friendly staff, seconds away from Brea mall, highly recommend it."
Lydia S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",202,100,196,4.0,6/1/2017,Super busy with our waiter did the best he could and was  very friendly!  I got my usual  the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. I had to box my own leftovers - different than  the Huntington Beach location.
Brian B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",17,105,72,4.0,7/14/2017,"Wow how could I have never done a Review on Cheesecake Factory? I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to The Factory. I almost always order the Shrimp Scampi. Now it's not a Shrimp Scampi that any Louisianian would consider calling it the real deal, but for what it is it's very good. Jumbo Shrimp flash fried and served with Roasted Garlic over Angel Hair pasta. Yeeeees in deed. The Garlic should not be discarded, but should be eaten with as many bites as possible with the pasta. Delicious. I'm not a real sweet eater but needless to say that when here I do as the Romans do. For me Strawberry cheesecake to go never disappoints. Um um good."
Pryo H.,"Fullerton, CA",5,175,891,5.0,12/28/2016,"I have to give  Cheese Cake Factory  tonight 5 star, not only  the food that we order from the small bites section come perfectly and delicious, our waiter Trenton was really helpful and we never have to look for him when we need something.  Please don't forget to order chocolate chip cookie dough cheese cake for dessert"
Jeffrey C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",212,116,48,5.0,5/19/2017,I thought The Cheesecake Factory is a good one. There is cheesecake. The interior is good. The exterior is good.
Cat B.,"Orange County, CA",187,288,617,3.0,9/15/2016,"5 stars for service.  We had the friendliest and most accommodating waitress and wait staff last night. They constantly refilled our bread basket (the kids love the ""chocolate"" bread) and our drinks.  2.5 stars for food. Hubs beef dip was quite good. The bread was soft, the meat tender, and the sandwich was nice and warm. Super comfort food for sure. The kids enjoyed their salmon/rice and fettuccine dishes.  I would have given the food 4 stars but for my jambalaya, which used to be my ""go to"" entree and also happens to be one of their signature dishes. For lack of a better word, it really sucked this time. : ( You could tell they cooked the noodles then plopped them on the plate before adding the chicken & shrimp jambalaya sauce on top. It was also room temperature which means my dish sat under the heat lamp where the noodles had time to clump together.  Once I separated the noodles and stirred the sauce in, my dish was bland. Did they salt the water for the pasta, or add salt to the sauce?  Fortunately, our awesome waitress quickly brought out some more sauce for me to stir into my dish, and after adding some salt, it became more reminiscent of the dish I once loved.  Don't think I'll be ordering this anymore since I also noticed that they really skimped on the serving of shrimps which were small and overcooked. Boo hoo for my lost relationship with CF's jambalaya. It'll take me months to get over this breakup."
Brandon S.,"Chino Hills, CA",590,223,187,4.0,8/31/2015,"We came here for brunch and were surprised that there were only around 15 people waiting. It's normally a zoo. So we went to the host and told him party of two. He said, ""if you eat outside, there's no wait. Eating inside wait is 10 minutes"" ...We told him eating outside is good, yet we literally waited 14 minutes. We were confused. The host had no idea what he was talking about.  Ordered the Monte Cristo french toast. It was crispy on the outside french toast with eggs, bacon, and swiss in between the toast - served with a nice strawberry preserve dipping sauce and well seasoned crispy potatoes. The meal overall was quote good, which resulted in the average of the one star for the unnecessary wait, and the five stars for the food. The sandwich is dense and quite filling, so splitting between your wife or husband is wise with this plate. The experience can make or break a place. Although the brunch was pretty good, the wait upset us. And there were others around us that were unfortunately told the same wait time expectation but we're also waiting longer than expected."
Mimi A.,"Riverside, CA",4,27,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Okay so...for starters i gave 2 stars because my waitress Crystal was really nice. If it wasnt for her understanding nature, i would have given 1 star.  So my best friend and i came here to eat a dish that we always order...the 4 cheese pasta (add the lemon sauce from the lemon picatta dish) if you're reading this, try it! Sooo, the waitress comes back to inform us that the chef refuses to add the sauce to the pasta and he will charge us $4 to put it on the side.....(never have i been charged for adding extra sauce) I was appalled and asked to speak to a manager....a manager named Derek was sent our way...he proceeded to argue with us that if we are adding more sauce and not removing sauce then there has to be an additional charge...but he said he agreed that $4 was too much, so he did us a ""favor"" and charged only $1.50 for the lemon sauce ...(kinda disrespectful to charge at all) We figured might as well just stay cuz at least our food will be good....well it came out and it was warm..not hot like we usually like to eat our food. Derek came over once again questioning the temperature of our food. He said the chef handed it right from the pan....and he went as far as sticking a thermometer into my pasta to check the temperature. He agreed that the temp had dropped slightly however he felt it was still hot.   First of all, who are you to tell me how hot my pasta should be? If I like it hot, I want it hot, especially since I am paying for it. At that temperature we pretty much had to inhale our food otherwise it would have been cold within a few min.  We didn't send our meal back, nor did he comp anything. I have been to many restaurants and I've never been treated with such disrespect from management. It isn't about the 20 dollar meal, it's about principle.... Being a former business owner myself, I know that customers are always right (even when they are not, its our job to be respectful and understanding and make sure the customer walks away happy) I wont be returning to this cheesecake factory location ever again....because ive had the same order at other locations and i have never been charged extra, nor have i experienced such disrespect."
Lindsey R.,"Boise, ID",186,236,311,5.0,5/20/2016,"i usually don't give reviews for big chains like this, but i have been to many cheesecake factory's and this one is beyond the best one i've eaten at. it even beats out the newport beach location- and that one overlooks the ocean! when we moved to orange, i immediately looked up where my closest one is because its been  one of my favorite restaurants basically forever now. whats not to like? they have EVERYTHING. i mean, literally, they cater to every persons every desire food wise. you really can't compare that to anywhere else. its the best place to go when you can't decide what you want! i have never had to wait, the parking lot is big and accessible and never full, the servers have all been extremely friendly to me, and its always quick and easy. you really can't go wrong with this winning formula! 5 stars!"
Triplet C.,"Walnut, CA",64,10,5,3.0,7/28/2017,I was disappointed with their Asian cuisine dishes. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it's more like teriyaki chicken. It was soaked with sauce and very salty. There wasn't a single cashew nut which I was expecting. The dish should have some vegetables and none was present. My dinner was very unsatisfactory except for the  waitress which she was really nice. I rather go to elephant bar but there's none around.
