Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,4.0,6/3/2015,"It's been a while since we have been to any Cheesecake Factory locations, I really like the cheesecake factory, the food, the relaxing atmosphere, above all? The cheesecakes, I rarely eat cheesecakes, in fact I rarely eat cakes, so I don't mind indulge in some whenever we come here.  We chose to sit at the bar on a Sunday afternoon after shopping, so we didn't have to wait at all. Had a draft blue moon to start, later on I had a Mojito, one of the best summer drinks, very refreshing and tasty.  I ordered off the skinnylicious menu cause I have been on summer bikini diet lately. Edamame was light and yummy as usual, fresh salmon rolls were so good, loved the sweet chili sauce. Veggie burger was delicious, the veggie patty was a little too mushy because it was made with brown rice mostly, but I still enjoyed it so much. Hubby had garlic noodles with chicken, I was surprised he picked a healthier item on the menu, he loved the noodles.  The highlight of my meal was pineapple upside down cheese cake, oh MY, it was so yummy! Pineapple upside down cake is my favorite flavor next to red velvet, it was heavenly sweet and comforting! Didn't care much for the whipped cream as usual. Our early dinner was relaxing and pleassant, the service was friendly and attentive. Definitely a nice spot for a casual meal after shopping."
James M.,"Whittier, CA",0,9,,5.0,10/20/2017,I love the brea cheesecake factory!! I came in for lunch and they were able to get me in and out in less than 30 minutes.. sliders were amazing and our service was great! Keep it up brea
Taba F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,9,3.0,7/17/2017,"I've been here a few times since I'm 5 minutes away.  They seem to get busy all the time and wait time is getting longer and longer when you're waiting for your food.  But then again it's cheesecake, regardless of my review, it's cheesecake, everybody loves cheesecake"
Cindy L.,"Walnut, CA",178,7,22,4.0,8/7/2016,"The hibachi steak was really tender, and the mashed potatos had a very rich flavor. The jambalaya had a spice that really gave pasta a nice punch! Although the pasta on the chicken bellagio had a very strong pesto flavor, the breaded chicken that topped the pasta was extremely tender and juicy. All of the food we ordered had very large, plentiful servings. We also ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake, which was delicious. Would highly recommend the key lime cheesecake if you enjoy a bit of sour creaminess. Definitely ate our fill."
David B.,"Whittier, CA",20,6,5,2.0,1/16/2017,"Very disappointed. We waited nearly an hour for our food. 2 orders were so dried out, it seemed that they had spent waaay too much time under the heat lamps. We have always been very satisfied with the Cheesecake Factory.  Then they handled very poorly.  Our waitress was very helpful though."
Danielle M.,"Pomona, CA",2,26,6,4.0,7/2/2017,My only complaint is the long wait! But that's expected right? Their food is amazing and oh my goodness their cheesecake is to die for! Had great customer service the few times I've been here & will definitely be going back !
Hannah K.,"La Habra, CA",448,33,5,3.0,10/8/2016,"Say no to banana cream cheesecake.  Generally overpriced, but tasty-ish food. I had Renee's Special with Loaded Baked Potato soup and a turkey sandwich. I'm a fan of rosemary, but there was too much in the soup and the best part of the sandwich was the slice of tomato inside! My husband got the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken which is his go-to (tasty but a little dry).  We got the banana cream cheesecake for dessert which is a plain cheesecake topped with a layer of banana cream, topped with banana slices and whipped cream. The banana cream had a gritty texture and it tasted of artificial banana flavor. Husband commented that it was like eating a banana Now & Later. Don't do it, y'all!"
Daniela A.,"Oakley, CA",0,11,7,5.0,2/12/2017,"By far the best dining experience we've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 6:30, right in the middle of rush hour. We were told it was going to be 40 min wait and we were sure that the hostess was being ambitious with that wait time compared to all of the people still waiting. But we actually were sat before our forty minute wait! Very impressed. Our server Roxie was hands down phenomenal. She brought our bread basket to the table when she first came to us to take our drink orders. Ah! Wish all Cheesecake restaurant servers did that. Our food came out quick and as perfect as could be. She was amazing with our drink refills and took excellent care of us on this busy night. 5/5 for this Cheesecake location!"
Young S.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,10,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"Sun afternoon. We arrived  1:30pm. ""15min wait."" Sat down at 2:02 pm. Food served at 2:46pm."
Nicole J.,"Orange, CA",194,17,4,5.0,7/12/2017,"Nicole at the to-go counter is extremely professional, caring, and kind. When doordash' system was down, Nicole made sure to get in touch with me and make sure that she would take care of my order until someone got there- (It took 3 hours for doordash to get in touch with me from the time I placed the order). I really appreciate a good server when I come in contact with one, since I used to be in the food service as well. I know how hard it is for such a big restaurant to stay on top of everything, but Nicole definitely satisfied everything I needed, and still managed to keep my pizza warm when I eventually got it.. Will definitely be back because of her! :)"
Matt L.,"Lakewood, CA",128,17,4,1.0,6/2/2017,Absolutely worst dining experience ever. So the dish I ordered was missing half the menu listed ingredients. But they did over compensate with burnt pepperoni and hair. Tasted like a day old dominos pizza that I ordered at midnight the night before. Just literally came home and threw up. Absolutely disgusting. Oh yea and I also had to was my arm off after the server dropped used silverware on me and didn't bring extra napkins or anything. Then a different server dropped a plate on me and didn't even acknowledge it. This place should be shut down for the worst possible food and service and the biggest cluster fuck in management I've ever seen. HORRIBLE
Ed M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,214,4.0,7/11/2016,Clean restaurant. Excellent server. Great selection in the menu. The only complaint is the Loud music. If they would bring it down a bit then it would be a great place to chat.
Maria T.,"Anaheim, CA",52,3,1,4.0,1/5/2017,"Only reason this restaurant is four stars and not five is because of the 45 minute wait on a Wednesday night.  Everything else was absolutely perfect. The restaurant gives of a caesars palace vibe which is perfect for any formal dinner or celebration. From the beginning, the food exceeded my expectations with the soft,warm, and tasty bread that was served while waiting for our meals. This place has a VARIETY of food like no other. American, Italian, Seafood, Vegetarian, a little bit of Latin and Asian. Also I was pleased to find a separate menu just for slim eaters, and the items on it appeared tasty. No matter what you order, it is very delicious and well done."
Amber B.,"Stanton, CA",45,137,106,1.0,3/26/2017,"These people are inept. They had to call a manager to answer our question, ""how long is the wait for a party of 9?"" Which is taking 5-10 mins, meanwhile they are putting other parties names on the waiting list that we walked in ahead of. This is after they refused to take our name for call-ahead or a reservation. I won't be coming here again. This ""restaurant"" is awful."
Honest R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,46,8,2.0,9/23/2016,"This chain is in a downward spiral.  The factory nachos came out burned and rock hard so they were sent back. After getting someone else's nachos, which were super cold, our second batch came out rock hard and burned again (although slightly less). I'm really not sure what is going on with the chips, but don't get the nachos. It's the same at other locations too.  The other items were just ok. Not up to their usual standards. At least the portions are still the same I guess. You go to chain restaurants because you know what to expect, right? Well, the only thing to expect now is subpar food. I think I'm over The Cheesecake Factory as a whole."
Richard R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,35,11,4.0,6/10/2017,"Who doesn't like this place. The food options on the menu are seeming endless and the food portions are easily shareable for 2 to 3 people. The wait time can be long depending on when you go, ie dinner time on a weekend or and time in the evening when graduation is near. The lemon chicken was really tasty and enough for my gf and her mom. I had the veggie burger and it was also good. What really was delightful was that pumpkin cheesecake at the end of our meal... I have dreams about how good that was...."
Dan Y.,"Azusa, CA",111,14,24,1.0,8/27/2016,"Seriously? I stopped by to get a slice to go for my gf. Got home and to my surprise??? $8 for this sliver with whip cream all over it!! Please see pic....I'm sorry I guess I haven't been there in a while, but if you are going to charge $8 for a slice? Please again please see pic and correct me if I'm mistaken..."
Lawrence A.,"Los Angeles, CA",484,34,54,1.0,3/28/2017,"If you purchased a good amount of cheesecake gift cards and in exchange received free slices of cheesecake and find yourself needing to use them all at once before they expire, don't go to the brea cheesecake. They don't care if you don't have the luxury driving 20 minutes one way just to get to your closest cheesecake. I will only go to the Arcadia cheescake factory moving forward!"
Brigitte O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",274,474,2244,4.0,7/23/2015,"Love the lettuce cups! Comes with cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, chicken, cilantro, peanuts, and three sauces to pour on your self made creations. This is technically an appetizer meant to split among several people but if you eat it yourself it constitutes a hearty meal.  The burgers are surprisingly good here.  Beware the dark bread and butter pats. It is very easy to polish off more than you planned especially it is busy and your meal takes a while to come out.  The cheesecake? I haven't been the biggest fan. We used to make cheesecake homemade when I was little and so the cheesecake here is too sugary to me. On more than one occasion I've been excited to try a new flavor only to eat less than half and not want any more than that. Thankfully I shared on all those occasions and the other person was more than happy to eat more than half ;)"
Cindy W.,"Walnut, CA",385,391,363,4.0,4/15/2016,"Plenty of cheesecake to choose from. When looking at the name, instantaneously it tells you they sell cheesecake. TRUE. But they are so much more than that. The food before the dessert are tasty as well.  The menu, in fact, is very thick and packed with a large amount of selection from salad, pasta, seafood, steak, rice and all of the between. They offer two types of unlimited bread.  Both of them are delicious especially when they are warm and fresh out of oven.  My favorite dish that I often order (always order) is the Shrimp Scampi.  So good! Love it! Price is fair and I think it is worth splurging with entree and dessert because you gotta make room for the cheesecake.  Save space for cheesecake! I can't do anything too sweet and I find all the special flavor cheesecake can be pretty sweet.  I always would choose the Original.  Sometimes when I like to be fancy, I would ask for Strawberry Cheesecake A La Modé (a scoop of ice cream). Great place for small or big parties.  Great for everyone.  Do expect a wait if you plan to visit on weekends, and/or holidays."
