Anthony B.,"Brea, CA",279,16,,5.0,3/6/2017,Every time I come here it's the best service An food you can get around brea.  Martina is a amazing server and Mellissa is the sweetest bartender ever!
Andrea Y.,"Walnut, CA",419,196,278,5.0,3/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite ""American"" chain. I always have a good experience. My friend introduced me to their shrimp and chicken gumbo, and I've been ordering it ever since. IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Creamy, spicy, filled with tender chicken breast and chicken and sausage. It is an explosion of rich flavors that goes perfect with the white rice! I also love that rye bread that they serve (meh about sourdough though) at the start of your meal. It's so sweet and soft and so damn good with butter. Is it possible to come to the Cheesecake Factory and just have the Jesus diet? (Jesus diet = complimentary  water and bread....) I also tried my sisters shrimp and sausage pasta (lunch special menu) which was actually surprisingly good and really saucy! I tend to avoid pasta at restaurants because it always tastes bland to me but this one had a lot of flavor. I enjoyed eating her leftovers the next day. Her dish also took a while so they offered her a free loaded potato soup (very nice of them)...and it was also delicious. Tasted like baked potatoes with all the toppings (including bacon and cheese!) but just in a soup form. The BBQ ranch salad and Chinese chicken salad are both spot on too! Really huge portions and lots of dressing. For cheesecake, I always order the red velvet cheesecake. Pure cheesecake can be too cheesy for me but the alternating red velvet cake layers really helped to balance it out. My only gripe with this place is that it's overpriced :/ The menu is also insanely huge too and can confuse and frustrate you (paradox of choice, anyone?). Save yourself the headache and just get the gumbo. You're welcome."
Mark L.,"Beaumont, CA",199,130,96,3.0,3/2/2016,We've had a Cheesecake Factory gift card vicious re-gifting cycle that we decided to finally end. The service was great when we went even though it was pretty busy. I forgot how expensive everything was too. Most of the dishes are about $19 when they should be around $12-13. Even their average quality burritos were $19 and they don't beat the $7 burritos at our local mom and pop restaurants.  The food was ok but definitely not worth the money. The bill for our family of 4 was around $100. It's just really expensive for what you get.
Julie K.,"Orange County, CA",8,135,234,4.0,6/19/2015,"I had Tuscan chicken it was in their healthy or lighter menu. It had balsamic sauce that was on sweet side, tomatoes & asparagus. There was some farro which is like a wheat berry for those watching carbs it was really small amount.  Then we had fish n chips it was really like beer batter and flakey fish it was tasty. I had it at Olde Ship in Fullerton pretty darn similar good old fish n chips. Came w cole slaw. Appetizers we had crab bites, it came in cute rectangle skillet w lemon and tarter sauce. It was really a bite but good, crunchy bread crumb coating and real crab meat inside. Overall we are satisfied w Cheesecake, make sure u get the famous avocado egg rolls~ yum! Crispy egg roll and creamy avocado filling w dip."
Kenny K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1,15,2,5.0,5/18/2017,Edit: 5/18 Whitney from guest services took care of this issue and hopefully this  small misunderstanding won't happen again.  Changed the ratings because of the way it was handled by guest services. Great customer service and will continue to visit this location.
Jenny L.,"Brea, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/1/2017,"This place is always crowded, so if you come here for dinner, expect a long wait without reservations. But even with the reservation, you still need to wait. The food is good, service is not bad."
Brooke C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,32,68,5.0,5/4/2017,"Went to a late dinner after work with my boyfriend and had the best server ever. Nakeia was so friendly, checked on us constantly and made sure we were taken care of. I'm so used to terrible service at restaurants but she really outdid herself. Thank you for the outstanding customer service!! If you come here, I recommend asking for her as your server!!!"
Wesley W.,"Monterey Park, CA",1204,727,10,3.0,1/22/2016,"As far as chain restaurants go, Cheesecake and BJ's are my most favorite.  The food and service is consistent along with the ambiance.  The Brea location was no different than all the others.  Good service and the food is what you'd expect.  Tasty but unoriginal.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and as usual, it was delicious with wonton skins along with fried vermicelli on top.  I like that they have a lunch size. This is the type of restaurant you go to with big groups so no one will bitch because if you can't find something to eat at Cheesecake, then you're pickier than Sally. (You older folks will get my reference)   So if you're looking for a consistently good restaurant with a huge and I mean huge menu, this is the place. Oh, the cheesecakes are pretty good."
Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561,4.0,3/27/2015,"I've been pleasantly surprised with my recent visits to the Cheesecake Factory. This wasn't my go to restaurant, but I'm starting to like it more and more after each visit.  Service: there were a lot of people waiting in line as we entered the restaurant so I expected a long wait, but the host told us that we only had to wait about 15 minutes. They gave us a buzzer, which was really confusing because they ended up calling our name instead of using the buzzer to call us back to the host stand.  Tonight, we decided to get: --buffalo blast: a twist on your traditional buffalo wing appetizer. We were expecting to get just wings, but instead, we got a plateful for large fried chicken. Once you cut into it, the shredded chicken is coated with some light buffalo sauce. On the side, there's blue cheese and buffalo sauce, with celery. The blue cheese was a little strong for me but the dish itself was delicious. --chicken Madeira: had to get this because it was the most mentioned dish on Yelp. Even the description says ""our most popular chicken dish"" so I knew I had to try. The sauce is somewhat tangy, which compliments the melted cheese on top of the chicken. The thoroughly cooked asparagus and sautéed mushrooms adds a light touch to the heavier dish. The side mash potatoes was delicious as well.  --hibachi steak: I definitely think this is underrated. When I tried a piece of this, my tastebuds exploded. The meat was so juicy and lightly seasoned. What put it over the top was the slight hint of wasabi in the mashed potatoes, which pulled the entire dish together. There's also deep fried asparagus on the dish as well. I definitely will get this dish the next time I come back. Couldn't opt for any dessert tonight, but I really wish we did because the desserts here never disappoint."
David R.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Very disappointed... Came here after my nieces graduation.  I know they were busy but the service was horrible. It took 15 minutes to get us drinks, didn't even offer us water. The food took forever. My sister and her husband ordered a salad before their meal that never came. One the food finally came, they forgot to put it my salad, I assume, it took another 15 minutes for them to bring my salad, meanwhile all of my family was half way eating. I was talking to my niece and when I turned away the waiter had taken my salad and placed more plates on top of it. I wasn't even done eating!! Rude rude rude! Never coming back here and will tell everyone not to come here."
Jeremiah C.,"Whittier, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/8/2017,"Alright, I'm back:  I came here today (7/8/17) with friends to catch up... again. This time, I had a beautiful steak. I had ordered a steak; well-done, and was absolutely delicious, best steak ever.  My friends were really proud of what they had ordered (chicken fried steak and bacon macaroni burger). My friends absolutely fell in love with their meal, stating it was better than our last time. As for me, I'm definitely coming back tomorrow.  I had ordered a Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. My mouth watered like a waterfall. It was delicious. I couldn't stop talking about it.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and was very quick on if we needed more napkins, ranch, or sauce. Amazing.  I bought more cheesecake home for my family and they absolutely enjoyed it. This is my stop. And, you cannot take me away from it. Amazing.  Grade: 5/5 Jeremiah C - It's Not Your Birthday PR"
Michelle N.,"Carson, CA",1145,207,1650,4.0,5/23/2015,"Came here for the first time with my family. The lady on the phone was a bit rude when I was asking for an average wait time but once we got there, the wait was only about 10 minutes and we got seated quickly. We were placed in a extremely dim part of the restaurant, but I guess you could say the rest of the restaurant was dimly lit to uphold the classy atmosphere which I appreciated. However, the light was so dim I had to squint and stick my face into the menu in order to read it. Ordering drinks, we asked for a round of waters, with myself asking for a Shirley Temple as well. Turns out I didn't get that water and had to ask again for it. The menu, is too darn long. I think if they split the menu up into different menus according to the different services, the menu wouldn't be so large and daunting. It was extremely hard to choose what to eat as waitresses never give you enough time to really look at your menu. I got their pasta, as I love pasta, but I was a bit disappointing with my pasta looking like a brown gold pile of pasta with mushrooms and chicken. Yes the pasta was delicious, but I honestly was hoping for something that looked a bit more appealing. I couldn't finish the dish, so our server took my plate and boxed and bagged my food to take home with me. I ate it the next day for lunch as it was boxed in a microwaveable container."
Janelle G.,"Whittier, CA",32,53,49,2.0,5/22/2017,Our waitress rarely came to our table...but she kept going to the other tables around us. She kept forgetting to bring us things we asked for. Our food was cold. Don't think we'll be returning to this location.
Jenny K.,"San Diego, CA",4,28,4,2.0,1/24/2016,Had the miso salmon on top of brown rice. The rice was so good and the salmon cooked well but wth?! around the salmon and rice they have a white sauce with small circles of teriyaki-like sauce surrounding the entire dish. The sauce was sweet and it did not go with the salmon at all. Not too sure what they were thinking pairing the sauces together. My friend also got the miso salmon and we both thought it was so gross. Can't believe I spent $20 on that crap but at least I had a gift card. It made me really really really super duper appreciate salmon from California Fish Grill. I wish I got anything else... Nothing could have tasted worse than the salmon and sauce combo.  One stars for the friendly service from our waitress. One star for the average desserts (we had the tiramisu cheesecake and strawberry shortcake biscuit thing)
Roo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,16,25,4.0,1/8/2016,"Alright listen up fam, I'm here to tell you that the Ol' Cheesecake Factory is still popping. I came here knowing damn well what I was going to get: Buffalo Blasts. In case you don't know what they are (and you should) they are fried wontons stuffed with buffalo chicken and cheese served with buffalo sauce and the best blue cheese dressing in the world. Rating: 6/5 Next up we had the Shrimp Scampi which was   as far as scampis go. The price was kind of up there for what it was ($20), but good thing your boy was rocking that sweet, sweet gift card. And of course if you come here you best be getting that cheesecake, I don't know what's wrong with you yelpers nowadays complaining about the cheesecake factory when you don't even get the cheesecake?! Come on fam, do it better and step your game up with some of this ridiculous Salted Caramel Cheesecake.  Overall the Cheesecake Factory met my expectations."
Steve S.,"Orange County, CA",1953,1200,7574,4.0,12/4/2014,"Cheesecake Heaven!! But that's not all they're good at. The food is also good! Whenever we're at the Brea Mall, this is one of a couple places we like to dine in. The place is spacious (over 300 maximum capacity, I looked lol) they have indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is very elegant and with the high vaulted ceiling, it's a really nice place to eat. Here's the rundown:  Miso Salmon - They have this dish down pat. And for some reason, this location makes it the best. I always get the lunch size portion, which is already a big portion. I can't imagine what the dinner portion would be. I can barely finish the lunch portions. lol. The fish is cooked perfectly. The miso glaze is just amazing. It comes on a a huge bed of rice. Yum! The sauce that surrounds the rice is just delicious! A perfect dish in my book!! Marhgarita Pizza and  Caesar Salad (Lunch Pizza and Salad - Special) - It was a dollar more to get the Caesar salad, but it was worth it. The pizza was a nice sized, heck it's probably good for 2 maybe 3 people and it was good. Yum! Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Kids Menu) - This one came with fries and a drink (milk for the boy). The grilled cheese was very good and it was also a big portion. Yum. We requested the fries cooked well done and they complied, Yum.  The complimentary bread was awesome!! Specially the wheat. DELICIOUS!! Service has been always good here. Regarding the Cheesecake, we didn't have any this time (so full). But my favorites are the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake. You can't go wrong with either of them. This location has a little cheesecake shop inside. You can order a to go cheesecake there. And during the holidays, they also set up a table where you can get gift cards. Their current promotion, get a gift card, get a free slice of cheesecake. Win Win. Parking: I have an issue with them on that. Since it's the holiday season and they are outside of the mall. You have to park where the mall people park. Why, because their Valet closed off 4 rows of parking. That's BS in my book. There were 4 rows of empty parking spots when we got there and we could not use them. We had to park with the general population peeps. No Bueno. Aside from that, I really like coming here for brunch. You get a good meal, good service and the cheesecakes are just Delicious!! Try them out for yourself and decide =)"
Nicole R.,"Buena Park, CA",145,9,2,1.0,4/22/2017,"Poor management, poor customers. My family and I just wanted to grab a quick bite and waited patiently for a table at the bar but what do we get? Some jerk taking our table when my husband was about to sit down. Now what did the managers do? NOTHING! I mean, I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been coming here for years, but this kind of rude behavior that was actually allowed by the management as something ""they can't control"" is unacceptable. It's common courtesy when someone is standing next to an open table to think that it is occupied but no, common courtesies are thrown out here and it is just chaos. Thanks Cheesecake for leaving me disenfranchised with a place that I USED TO like. Thanks for not sticking up for us and thanks for letting people with no manners or common decency to win again."
Anthony D.,"Anaheim, CA",30,583,317,5.0,1/26/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory always has great service. If you ever have an issue with food quality, of service, the manager will address the issue immediately. The steak is okay for The Cheesecake Factory. I had the Ribeye and for The Cheesecake Factory is wasn't that bad. My favorite will always be in those order (as far as steak goes) 1. Ruth's Chris 2. BLT Las Vegas 3. Mastro's 4. Lou and Mickeys San Diego 5. BOA"
Jay J.,"Anaheim, CA",2,4,,3.0,12/14/2016,Pretty good food but i had better at other location. Thry offer free cheesecake with 25 dollars gift card. But i couldn't use it because the date is from 1/1/17
Tyler G.,"Brea, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/19/2017,This is our favorite place to buy cheesecakes and meals. They have a variety of cheesecakes to choose from and they serve delicious meals. Everyone must eat at this restaurant!
