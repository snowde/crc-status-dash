Jennilee D.,"La Mirada, CA",27,19,11,4.0,12/11/2016,"Been coming to this place for eternity, and I can say the service is always great and the food is amazing. Love their happy hour appetizers"
Angelique H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2017,The food is usually delicious here but the service is horrible. We came for a late dinner around 10 and then left at 10:30 because no one acknowledged us. No drinks or server to greet us. Go to the other restaurants around that area. Thanks
Jocelyn A.,"Fullerton, CA",4,5,6,2.0,7/24/2016,My friend and I went for dinner last night. We were seated outside upon request. The plates and linen on the table had dirt or dust all over them. Our alcoholic beverages took about 10 minutes to come out to us. The waiter kept going to the other tables around and kept looking at us saying I'll be right back.. Took about 20 minutes just to order food and then the food took about 40 minutes. A table that arrived half an hour after we did received their food before we did. And to top it all off the presentation of the plate was not up to par. There were sauce marks around the edges and some of the shrimp looked like they were just throw on the plate. Just surprising cause I've always known Cheesecake Factory has been top of the line in all aspects. Pretty disappointed..
Alex G.,"Placentia, CA",4,141,21,1.0,7/14/2017,"Curbside to go! What a joke! Ordered our food over the phone and was told 25 minutes. We arrived at the 20 minute mark, called in and waited 10 minutes before someone came out. When the person arrived at the vehicle he was carrying only my cheesecakes. He then gave us the bill and charged us for our order. He stated you order will be out in about 5 minutes and then asked if we would like some water while we waited. We thanked him and said yes to the water. 20 minutes later our order was finally brought out but, the water that waiter agreed to bring never showed up. At this point our cheesecakes, which are supposed to be refrigerated, have now been sitting out for about 20 minutes. My first question/issue is, why would you bring my cheesecake out 20 minutes before my food? My second issue is the excessive wait, I could have gone in, sat down, ordered and finished eating in the hour plus it took to finally get what we ordered. We now drive home, start eating and find that my four cheese pasta is SALTY and has only 2 tiny pieces of chicken. When I ask for chicken to be added to my order and pay 3-4 dollars extra, I expect at least a small breast. There must be a chicken shortage going on that I'm not aware of. I hope they get their act together."
Joelle B.,"Chino, CA",58,50,3,5.0,3/4/2017,I simply love this place! Been here a few times and have always been satisfied! Won't be going to the Rancho Cucamonga one anymore as my experience has been horrible there almost everytime!
Sarah J.,"La Habra, CA",79,9,3,1.0,5/1/2017,"Cucumber lemonade was about the best part of my experience, and it was way too sugary. The Wait staff was terrible: like absentee newbies who were confused by the menu when we ordered. I got the shepherds pie and my hubby got chicken avocado salad. Both were poorly made with cheap ingredients. & it arrived 40 minutes after we ordered it. When we informed the staff they offered us soup. Of all imaginable solutions.... soup? I will never come here again. Cheesecake Factory has declined in its standards without a doubt!"
Angela M.,"Kagel Canyon, CA",9,9,4,1.0,6/12/2016,"This place is pretty gross. The silverware and plates that are set on the table has left over food on it. When you touch it, it has that disgusting crusty feeling. The table next to us was served uncooked chicken. Can you say salmonella outbreak?! Thank God mine was cooked, otherwise they def would have heard from me, I work for the health department.  Our server was not friendly. And it took about 45 minutes to get our food... And it was cold! I've been to other cheesecake factories in Pasadena, Glendale, and Sherman Oaks, but this is by far the  worst restaurants I've been to. Absolutely disgusting! Do yourself a favor and go to another Cheesecake Factory if you're craving for their food."
Rhea S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",10,14,12,2.0,4/16/2017,"Two stars is being generous.  It might have been because it was Easter breakfast/brunch, but seriously having to wait a long time then to have the food be cold when it was brought to our table was hard to understand.  Not enough food runners?  A restaurant like Cheesecake Factory should be able to figure it out.  I like this Cheesecake Factory, but I won't be back on any notable holiday."
Soomi P.,"Irvine, CA",489,473,92,3.0,10/18/2015,"I feel like all Cheesecake Factory locations are pretty much the same... I was here for lunch yesterday and it was exactly what I expected. Good food, good service, but not much more than that.  I definitely recommend the skinnylicious grilled salmon with veggies.... soooo good!"
Mike B.,"Glendora, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/11/2017,"We come to the Cheesecake Factory for our grandson birthday.  There were 6 of us at 6:30 PM. It took 10 minutes  to seat us. Service was great, food was very good. Great place for special occasions."
Antonio R.,"La Puente, CA",115,38,19,1.0,5/29/2016,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  Wish I could give zero stars.  System has been down for over an hour they had us wait for about an hour before telling us that their system was down. Drove here and wasted my time and about 1 hour waiting for nothing when they knew they had an issue. Going to make the short drive over to Lucile's to get a better experience. First time here and probably the last time as staff offered no help or explanations Edit #1 I was contacted by Veronika and she wanted to know what happened, i explained the above and she offered a gift certificate ($25). I went back and it was a much better experience, the food was great (i has a steak) and since it was my daughters bday they sang"
Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,5.0,10/31/2015,"I usually don't venture this far just for a lunch, but I had a meeting in the area and it was suggested to meet here. Ok I thought.....but having tried several other Cheesecake Factories all over the place, I had a horrible feeling there was going to be a long lunchtime wait with the lobby area packed and flowing all the way outside the door. But to my surprise, no, not at all. I did show up at around 11.45am, and the person I was meeting was going to be late, so I waited till 12.30pm. Still to my surprise, there was hardly a crowd all this time. Sure, it got a bit busier after noon with people slowly trickling in, and the large mall parking lot was starting to fill up too....there's plenty of parking, but the later you come, a little further away you'll have to park and walk. When you first walk in to this Cheesecake Factory, you can immediately tell that it's so Cheesecake decor.....very nice, clean, and impressive. So, we had no wait at all and were seated right away by the nice and friendly hostess. We were already familiar with the menu and I pretty much knew what I was going to order. Whatever it was it had to include the Avocado Egg Rolls....yum! I ordered the Pear & Endive salad.....and as usual it was very good....perhaps a little skimpy on the chicken, but it still tasted good, and the portion was extremely generous.....as usual. Everything was delicious...including the free bread...hot and fresh out of the oven. I'm truly impressed at how consistent they maintain their quality at all the CF outlets. Our waitress was friendly and attentive....nice ambiance....very good food. I'm not sure how often I'd come back to this area, but if I do I'd definitely come back to this CF. Oh, there was a table nearby with a birthday celebration....the servers did their birthday song routine, but it was kind of out of tune.....as fun as it may be, I'd pass on that."
Carissa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1139,196,2829,4.0,8/15/2014,"I now come here for the cheesecake and ONLY the cheesecake. I was on a mission to try every single one of their cheesecakes to find out which one I liked the most; I got about half way through their cheesecake menu and fell in love with the ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake"" and the ""Godiva Chocolate"". I will eat these two flavors until I get sick of them and then continue on with the rest of my cheesecake mission. The ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake"" is made with layers of original cheesecake, fudge cake and chocolate truffle cream, while the ""Godiva Chocolate"" is made with layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse. The cheesecake here is rich, creamy and can be very, very sweet (depending on the flavor you order). Your wallet and scale will not be happy, but indulging yourself in delicious cheesecake is worth it! I have dined in several times for brunch, lunch and dinner at this location, but have yet to find an entree that is worth ordering more than once. They have a large menu selection, so it is a great restaurant for picky eaters or those unsure of what they feel like eating. Although the food portions are large, the food is mediocre and priced higher than it should be. I do enjoy the complimentary bread and butter that they give before your food arrives! The servers here are friendly and help to make your dining experience more enjoyable. Hopefully I can find an entree that is worth coming back for, but if not, a slice or two of cheesecake will suffice!"
Bill E.,"La Habra, CA",1,36,54,4.0,4/15/2017,"Well as you can tell by some of my reviews, Service is extremely important to me when you are paying to go out. First thing here the bartender Gabriel was great when he laughed pretty hard as I asked him if they serve cheesecake here and said, I can check. And then the server Nikki was very Cooperative when I asked if she could look for my ambulance after I had my second whole cheesecake. Love good service and friendly people! And interesting to note that the sister chain is the Grand Lux Cafe which I like much better regarding the menu, I have been to the one at the Venetian in Las Vegas many times. I will say though, this is a great American dining establishment. And okay, just got my chicken enchilada plate and it is great."
Amanda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,4.0,4/15/2017,"Love their food! Such a large menu to choose from, definitely something for everyone. Try the banana cream cheesecake and herb crusted salmon."
Martin P.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/6/2016,"Horrible service, we had reservation for 37 and they cancelled on us without giving us a notification.  Shout out to Islands for letting us get reservations right away."
Jennifer ..,"Newport Beach, CA",0,38,26,1.0,4/10/2017,Today I decided to eat my cashew chicken for lunch........ huge mistake. I don't know what they did to it but I have been so sick all afternoon and still. I ate about 1/4 of it. Thanks Cheesecake factory for what I'm assuming is food poisoning
Kathy S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",25,28,1,5.0,8/26/2017,"Ok... long wait and accosted in the restroom by a crazy woman, made me cry and the cheesecake staff were so incredible to make sure I was ok on my birthday..food was good but the staff is what really made my day"
Gabby K.,"Glendora, CA",856,287,827,4.0,8/26/2015,"Atmosphere: Casual. Large restaurant with booth, table and outside seating available.  Ordered Items: Crab cakes, Ahi Carpaccio, and Sheppard's pie.  I'm not a fan of chain restaurants at all, but I would probably say The Cheese Cake Factory is my favorite. They offer a large variety of lunch or dinner options, also Vegan, Vegetarian, and Gluten free options ad well. They start you off with delicious warm honey wheat and fresh sour dough bread. The service is almost always fast and polite. I'm sorry to report that I didn't catch the person who helped us last night, but she was amazing; she even let us try the soup of the day, which I thought was good, but my mom thought it was the consistency of baby food (LOL). We started off with Crab Cakes, there were 3 large crab cakes served with tartar sauce and some other sauce that I had no clue what it was, but it was delicious. Then our meals came out shortly after, I ordered the Ahi carpaccio, according to The Cheese Cake Factory this is a small plate, but it was a  good sized square plate filled with Ahi Tuna topped with garlic, onions and seasoning pared with wasabi, ginger and seasoned ponzu sauce. I thought it was perfect and fresh. The momma bear ordered a Sheppard's pie, that was a HUGE bowl of meat, veggies, and topped with mashed potatoes. I thought it was salty and she told me she wished the meat was more tender but wasn't completely unhappy with it. Overall if you have forced to go to a chain, take yourself to the Cheese Cake Factory."
Karla S.,"South Gate, CA",1,13,18,5.0,3/5/2017,"I ordered the chicken chipotle pasta, it was delicious ! Our server was Deja, she was awesome . Very attentive and great personality. I will definitely come back to this location for the great service and yummy food. Thank you Deja for making my experience a great one."
