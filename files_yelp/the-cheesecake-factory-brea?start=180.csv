Carla M.,"Chino, CA",660,82,8,4.0,1/22/2017,Great food and very nice atmosphere. The service is a little slow but good. I do recommend.
Timothy H.,"Fullerton, CA",422,102,1945,5.0,4/25/2016,I love all the good here. I loved the salads and burgers and pasta and great bread they give you at the table. The menu is so big it's hard to decide what to get. My wife and kids love this place. You should try it.
Jessica C.,"Apple Valley, CA",1,165,129,5.0,8/5/2016,"Cuatomer service was okay. My cheesecake idk, Im not sure what I was expecting. I think I was expecting great, delicious, unforgettably great. But instead I got a semi-cheesecake taste. It was the Banana cream cheesecake although I was extremely disappointed, my husbands piece was great he had the caramel one and loved it. So overall not too bad. I can leave without them those pieces are just super expensive. Price wise for me is not up to par. If Ima pay 6 dllrs for a piece it better be the greatest thing I have ever had. Unfortunately not the case. Im sure people would disagree."
Brianna A.,"Whittier, CA",42,51,49,5.0,12/12/2015,"Came here tonight for my sister's birthday and it was a 45 minute wait. Not too bad for a Saturday night. Service: The service was exceptional here! I wasn't able to catch our server's name in the beginning but she was patient while we all took our time looking through the menu and deciding on what to order but checked in on us in a timely manner. She had such a positive energy that really made the night special.  Food: Last time I came here I ordered the Jambalaya and was totally in love with all the flavors of the shrimp and sausage! But lately I've been really into Eggplant Parmesans, so I decided to go with that. My plate came with 4 eggplants covered with cheese and a side of pesto pasta. The pasta was okay but the eggplant was DELICIOUS. It was such a huge portion for about $14-15 that I was only able to eat 2 eggplants and less than half of the pasta. Well worth it! Cheesecake: Our table decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake and share so we can all try different kinds. My sister loves the original cheesecake so we ordered a slice along with the Oreo cheesecake and the new Salted Caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake slices are big and so rich and creamy that you definitely won't be able to finish one by yourself. The Oreo is verrry chocolate-y and was a tad bit too much for me. I didn't care too much for the Salted Caramel but 4 people at my table loved it! And you can never go wrong with the original!  Overall it was a great experience and everyone was happy with their food. In the end, including the cheesecakes, it averaged to about $20 per person, not including tip. Definitely a nice night out and worth the money!"
Janel W.,"Danville, CA",3,26,5,2.0,4/28/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here before going to a Ducks game a couple of weeks ago for a quick dinner. They seated us right away, in an area near the windows on the right side past the cheesecake counter. HELPFUL TIP: if they seat you in this area, ASK TO MOVE.  That seating area was disturbing. There were fruit flies everywhere, and they were flying into our drinks, food, and faces. I think they were coming from the windows. We let the host know that there were a bunch of flies and that we wanted to move. She had to go ""talk to someone"" then came back and told us we could sit in a booth right across from where we were originally sitting. That was no help at all AND we had to move our food and drinks by ourselves. I don't know about you, but that's kind of embarrassing. I've rarely had to move seats in a restaurant, and when it happens, there's normally at least 2 people that move your food. That's just restaurant etiquette. Also, you know what else is restaurant etiquette? AN APOLOGY. Nobody apologized for the fruit flies. They just kind of went ""oh..."" and went on their way. I can't even review the food because the fruit flies swarmed the dishes before we could fully enjoy it.  Good thing I had a gift card and didn't spend actual money. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back to this location. EDIT  Contacted corporate (as a friend recommended), and they pretty much said ""Sorry you had a bad time, did you talk to the manager? There's nothing we can do to help right now."" U-S-E-L-E-S-S"
Lindsay M.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/1/2017,"good food, our waiter was awesome!! (Forgot his name). :( service up front was unbelievably HORRIBLE!!! There was a huge mix up for my family last night. Called to make a reservation, some guy took all my information down, walked in Monday night and the girl up front pretends to look for a reservation @ 7 (even though she knew they don't take reservations) after she's done pretending, she tells me, they don't take reservations. I start arguing with her because she told me, ""well everyone working here knows we don't take reservations after a certain time."" OBVIOUSLY NOT, dummy!! Another employee steps in and tells me that she can seat us in about 20 minutes on the patio. I walk back, to inform them that there will be one less person in my party. After hearing it would be 20 minutes, the stupid girl I talked to in the beginning told me, oh, well now it's going to be 45 minutes because of one less person! WTF?! I asked How is that possible for the wait time to double with one less person?! Stupid! She asked for my name and I gave it to her, and then she goes ""oh! Your THAT family...."" WHAT THE HELL is that supposed to mean??!!!! I wanted to tell her off. I don't know her name (African American girl with glasses). I would go back, just so long as I don't have to deal with that girl and her stupidity. No thank you!"
Joyce C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",2,34,69,4.0,7/21/2016,"3.5 stars because though there isnt much to complain about their food is alright traditional american food and i personally wouldnt come back unless I had to. I got the mushroom burgers cause i was craving fries. but ther burger buns were soooo greasy/buttery. very cheesy and not much mushroom (which is why i got the mushroom burger) meat was good as i asked (someplaces overcook the meat). i LOVE their bread. haha we kept asking for refills and were full by the time the food came. Portions are large!  and their cheesecake in store is MUCH better than the ones you get at the grocerystore! the wait can be long and the food comes out slow too..  desite a large parking lot, because of they share with BJs and we were there on a weekend we had to park pretty far. Despite having a pokestop my internet inside the building was awful and I couldnt connect"
Malek Y.,"Artesia, CA",11,3,,1.0,3/19/2017,At first the service was good but then it just went downhill. We asked for bread and got it twenty minutes later when the manager got it for us. The place is infested with gnats and not one of the servers offered to take our plates. I would give them no stars but one of the servers saved the day. The first server left without telling us. The manager had no control over his own staff and the adults' plates came out before the children's. Cheesecake Factory used to be good but now it just sucks. I don't recommend going here and I feel sorry for whoever went there too. I am never going back here again. It flat out sucked.
Adelaide L.,"Brooklyn, NY",274,96,378,5.0,6/11/2016,"I've always really enjoyed coming to Cheesecake Factory. The service is great and the food is great. They have such a wide variety of dishes on their menu from pastas to burgers and pizza. I love the complementary bread they give you before your meal. I always end up asking for seconds. I ordered their Shepard's pie last time, it was absolutely delicious. It's so awesome that an American restaurant known for their cheesecakes would have a traditional English dish, and know how to cook it so well! It's basically mashed potatoes with cheese on top of a mixture of minced beef with veggies. Sounds simple, but the flavors were so complex and perfectly blends in your mouth for the perfect bite! To top off my meal, I ordered a strawberry cheesecake. My only negative critic is that the menu says ""fresh strawberries"", but that isn't true. The strawberries are preserved in their strawberry sauce and put on top of the original cheesecake, but it still tasted very good."
Lauren S.,"Whittier, CA",271,21,2,3.0,3/17/2017,Atmosphere is always great and although wait times can be long the patio is a good option. I'm gluten intolerant and although they have a gluten free menu including one cheese cake option I don't feel great afterwards as the cross-continuation must be too high. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. It's a little expensive and very calorie-laden for what you get.
Alaina C.,"Long Beach, CA",178,38,,2.0,1/3/2017,"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the olives in my martini were delicious. The appetizers were okay, but what really set the tone was the bartender who obviously did not want to be at work...I mean, it's Tuesday afternoon, what else would you be doing?  I should have gone to BJ's or Lazy Dog, at least those people appear to give af."
Chanson H.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",110,288,16,5.0,12/14/2016,"My first time at a Cheesecake Factory for a weekday work lunch.  I couldn't believe that there was still a 10 minute wait for lunch.  We waited it out, but were pleasantly surprised that the service was prompt.  Despite the wait for a table, we were out of there within the hour.  Very efficient."
Abbey S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",5,6,,4.0,8/14/2017,"Place it really great, food is amazing! I went last night with my family had a good time and enjoyed our dinner! I even ate half of my daughters meal too! Only thing I can possibly complain about is the terrible parking! I hate not finding parking up close I'm not too sure if there was preferred parking or valet but I would much rather pay to park somewhere closer to the location because I hate parking far and having to walk after a good meal."
Pyt L.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/28/2017,"-Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration, it was way too crowded, we waited for a WHOLE HOUR until we were called, and even when my party was called, we were called to stand around for 5 more minutes rather than being seated right away as there was another line for the parties that were called, which was fine with me but it was definitely not ideal for my grandma with her walker - this would be a 1 to 2 stars wait/operation. -The pina colada was pretty good, and the food all came out to be average (so food and beverage alone would've deserved a 3 stars.) It's not bad thought, just nothing was amazingly delicious.  -Server did an okay job, nothing to be complained about on top of my head except that she brought over some plates one time, and 2 of them were kind of dirty. Also, we've mentioned that the occasion to eat there was for my birthday celebration, and after looking up some posts on yelp & google, it appeared that Cheesecake Factory gives complementary dessert/ or sundae for birthday celebrations. However, all I'd gotten for my special day was 2 blobs of decorated free whip cream with a happy birthday message along with the piece of cheesecake that I paid for. -The mango cheesecake was really kind of below average too, and a bit too sweet..I've definitely tasted better cheesecake else where, so this was disappointing. (perhaps I should try other flavors next time) To be fair, I was a bit ticked off because all I'd received was the whip cream for my bday celebration after waiting for over an hour, so this review definitely took into consideration of that. Perhaps it's not by industry standard that every restaurant is expected to give a little something nice on an actual birthday celebration, but the experience there really just made me feel exceptionally ""unspecial"" dining there on my birthday when I could've gone else where.  Moral of the review - probably go somewhere else if you want to feel special on your birthday. (but it's a bit shocking to know Cheesecake factory can't afford to give an extra scoop of ice cream for birthday customers) (the pina colada was really good though! - maybe coming here for happy hour would be a better idea..I would appreciate 1 extra cherry to be in my cup if I'm there for a celebration - at least it has some nutritional value)"
Kelly T.,"Irvine, CA",204,24,46,5.0,1/21/2017,"My fiancé and I love Cheesecake Factory. One thing that keeps us coming back to Cheesecake Factory is the complimentary bread (perfect blends of grain in each type - unlike anything I've tasted before) and the large variety of specialty dishes. The decor is very nice, and the restaurant is clean and very hospitable. Another is that the waiters and waitresses are attentive, and will go the extra mile to ensure that we enjoy our meal/dessert. During one of our visits, we asked our waitress if she could put a slice of cheesecake in the freezer for us because we wanted the cheesecake frozen/more solid, and she happily put a slice in the freezer for us. I know it can be an inconvenience when a customer asks for something unusual, but I really appreciated this waitress going above and beyond. They also serve large sharing portions, especially for the pastas, and are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. We love Cheesecake Factory and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fancy place to dine that won't drill hole in your wallet! Thank you to all the staff at this location for your exceptional service!"
Joshua E.,"Buena Park, CA",14,8,,1.0,3/25/2016,"On two separate occasions I placed an order over the phone for curbside service. Both times they said ""it will be ready in 20 minutes,"" so I get there in 25 minutes. The 2nd time I ordered was with a ""Cory"" who happened to be the manager (I knew this because I called to complain about what happened below) 1. I call curbside and asked for the name on the order and they mentioned someone will be right out. I had to wait 10+ minutes.  2. The girl that came out didn't even acknowledge or apologize for how long it tools come out. She takes my card and comes back.. With NO FOOD after another 10 minutes. But mentions it will be ""right out."" Keep in mind this is past the 25 minutes past the 25 minutes from the initial promised time. 3. Finally the food comes out.  ... So, back to the time I placed the order.. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta WITHOUT mushrooms and extra sauce on the side buffalo blasts with RANCH, and the Cuban rolls. Cory also asked if I wanted complimentary bread. I said ""yes please."" Who then repeated the exact order. He got it right.  When the girl brings my food out she repeats my order and asked if I wanted bread??? At this point I was so irritated and just said no thanks and left to go home. I live a good 10 minutes from this location. So, I open the bag.. The pasta had mushrooms (the wife's allergic to it) and no extra sauce.. The blasts had blue cheese and I hate blue cheese.. NO Ranch. This literally happened twice, the same exact way. I called to notify them of their poor service and was transferred to Cory. I told him what happened and he said he checked the order himself.. ""Did you?"" Just a little bit of advice, don't over promise and under deliver. Don't say 25 minutes, when it's really an hour. Don't send the food out without really checking. Just be honest with your customers."
Michelle D.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,19,26,5.0,2/20/2017,"We love this restaurant! Our server Jessica Gutierrez (at the bar), was able to handle a large rowdy party of 12 with ease and grace while we waited for a table.  We will definitely come back and ask for her again. We love this place it's worth the wait!  Must have the Buffalo blast wonton appetizer!"
Ash B.,"La Mirada, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/18/2017,"I convinced my husband to come here for happy hour. The happy hour is only offered in the bar, which was full so we opted to sit on the patio and pay full price. I ordered a MEDIUM mushroom burger protein style. This is the first time I have ever sent a dish back. I ordered a medium mushroom burger and it came out beyond well done. It was visibly burnt to a char. I waited over 30 minutes and the burger was clearly inedible. Hesitantly, I returned the burger and the waiter told  me it would take another 20 minutes for them to remake the burger. I agreed to the 20 minutes for a new burger and then the manager came to the table. She was the most condescending person I've ever met. She made nothing but obvious, unhelpful comments. Finally I said to just cancel the burger, as I was afraid they would spit in my burger. I waited more than 30 minutes for the check and then not one thing was comped.  I was shocked, so I asked the waiter if he could comp my glass of wine. He rudely told me he would get his manager. She came to the table again and offered me dessert, even thought diet restrictions do not allow me to eat dessert (hence the protein burger). After sitting here for more than an hour and a half I did not eat dinner and finally they comped my glass of wine. I will never come back here. Fast food restaurants have better services for a fraction of the price. Do not come to this Cheesecake Factory unless you want subpar service for full price."
Shelley S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,16,6,4.0,8/1/2017,We love coming here the food is great BUT the girl who took us to the table had an earring in her nose. Kinda gross because I wanted to tell her it looks like you have a burger in your nose. Kinda ruins the idea of eating
Jen H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",310,237,1212,3.0,5/31/2014,"Have been here several times over the years and 3 stars seems to be about right for my experiences. There's always a wait because we usually come on Friday or Saturday evenings. It goes by pretty quickly and doesn't seem to be as long as they say it is. They have a wide variety to choose from on the menu. Burgers, seafood, pasta, salad.. you name it! But some of my favorites include the garlic noodles, miso salmon, and chicken costoletta. For the most part, our waiters have always been outgoing, friendly, and prompt. On one of my most recent visits, however, we weren't so lucky. Our waitress wasn't very personable and seemed to almost disappear after a while. She just did her job and wasn't friendly like other past waiters. It took a while to get refills on our water as well as our second batch of bread.  All in all, I enjoy coming to Cheesecake Factory to enjoy a nice dinner with the family."
