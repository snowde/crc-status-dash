Sonia K.,"Brea, CA",2,11,4,3.0,6/26/2016,YUM  I got the steak and shrimp combo plate.   Had to flag down my waitress a couple times but the food was good.
David S.,"Walnut, CA",205,8,,5.0,1/8/2017,"Came in on a busy Sunday. Surprisingly for the amount of people waiting outside, we got seated instantly in the heated patio. Our server's name was Vitaliy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have wrote this review. Moving on. I ordered a steak diane with shrimp scampi medium rare. It came out a bit tough and cooked to about medium well. I notified the server and he asked if I would like to switch it out. I refused not wanting to wait any longer for my food. Not 5 minutes longer, a lady (most likely manager) came over with a plate of fresh steak diane cooked perfectly to medium and apologized for the overcooked steak. This is service I haven't had in most places and I'm glad to see it at Cheesecake Factory."
Elena G.,"Fullerton, CA",7,68,49,2.0,3/24/2016,"What can I say? It's the cheesecake factory .....flavorful food served in splitable  portions but why,,why is the service consistently SLOW AS MOLASSES during lunch time?? We had been there over 45 min. Before our food arrived. To boot,  my salmon dish came out completely cold : ("
Ann F.,"Pomona, CA",265,133,181,5.0,8/23/2015,"I went there with my sister for late, we arrived around 2:00pm to a packed restaurant inside and the hostess gave us choice inside or shaded patio; we took patio (less noisy and wait). I had my $25 gift card and cashier checked for me to    make sure it works since I didn't bring too much cash or debit. Server took drink orders; both had water.  Ten minutes later came back to order entree; she ordered chicken salad sandwich w/salad and soup combo and I had bacon bacon cheeseburger medium well and fries.   Very impressed with the food, burger appeared hand pressed and cooked like I asked, fries little salty but decent; she enjoyed her food and liked the clam chowder.   Gift card worked at the end with just paid additional $3.00 plus tipped $5.00.  Enjoyed our experience and will be back on a weekday."
Stella M.,"Los Angeles, CA",301,546,833,4.0,4/27/2014,"I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. I personally think the food is great. I admit, I do think it's a little overpriced for what it is but the food never disappoints me.  Personal favorites: Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Madeira, Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, and Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. And of course their cheesecakes are amazing! :) PS. During lunch, order their lunch portions for their pastas. It's more than enough. :)"
CrayCrayCritic C.,"San Jose, CA",0,39,,1.0,7/8/2017,This is the WORST cheesecake factory I have ever been to. I have been here several times and each time the food is gross and service is slow!! Every time I come here there are problems. I love cheesecake factory but this one is terrible. Whoever manages this location really needs to straighten things out or get a new chef because it is not on the same level that other cheesecake factories are on. Dont go to this location.
Nury C.,"La Mirada, CA",38,20,91,1.0,12/26/2016,30 mnts wait for 1 person and it took more than 40 mnts to get my hamburger.   30 mnts wait for 1 person and it took more than 40 mnts to get my hamburger.
Laura W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,82,112,2.0,10/30/2016,Horrible service when we visited for lunch.  Restaurant wasn't even that busy.  I ordered the chicken Caesar salad which was way under-dressed.  Had to wait forever for our bill. Food was ok.  We usually enjoy this location but today wasn't up to its usual standard.
Carmen S.,"Long Beach, CA",32,14,12,5.0,12/17/2016,Our server River was on point!! He is the best! Made sure our teen felt special on her day...
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,4.0,1/20/2015,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factories consistently great food, and good value but I feel like the level of service could improve.  The wait staff, at times, act as if they're doing the customer a favor by working there.  I don't ask for much when dining but if I need water refill, place an order, pay the bill, I expect them to come around in a decent amount of time.  We don't go out to eat, to be ignored and then made felt as if we're annoying them by making requests.  This doesn't happen all the time.  Sometimes we have great service.  Overall, I love the food and will be back but be wary of service standards."
Abdullah A.,"Pomona, CA",1,5,,5.0,2/28/2017,"I've been to this place which is located in Beverly Hills. I went there with my friends, but we arrived so late. When we arrived this place, we thought that it will close at that time. This restaurant has a good service, it has kind waiters, and it also has a lot of delecious things to order."
Marlene A.,"Brea, CA",0,42,,5.0,12/8/2016,This restaurant makes you feel cozy and warm. The meat loaf and mash potatoes reminds you of mom or grandmas pot roast and then there was cake. Marie Antoinette says let them eat cake. The chocolate fudge cake is to die for and the Cheese Cake oh my God it is so good. Bon.  appetite
Amanda J.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,10,2,3.0,11/20/2016,"My family and I went to a dinner celebration tonight at the restaurant. Service was great but I have to say my dinner was thoroughly mediocre. I had a combo with chicken madera and shrimp scampi. The chicken was fine, nothing special, the mashed potatoes were over peppered but the shrimp was the worst. First, I have never seen breaded shrimp scampi. The breading was falling off. The sauce was dumped on the plate, no pasta like it is described. Whole garlic cloves are not pleasant to bite into either. We ordered cheesecake to go and I was shocked by the size of my slice! The used to be rather large. Now it is a small slice for $9 which is outrageous! Not thrilled that I spent $100 for a family of four for a terrible meal. Plus I orders a flavored lemonade that was $5! That""s just crazy."
Janelle G.,"Las Vegas, NV",590,78,762,4.0,5/12/2014,"Ive been to a couple of different Cheesecake Factor's. One in the bay area and the one here in Las Vegas.  We were celebrating Mother's Day when we went here and the wait was soo long. About an hour and a half to be seated outside. It looks like all the other Cheesecake Factory's and the outside seating was a tad bit small but was able to fit a good amount of people. Their menu is so large i usally dont know what to order. But yesterday i chose to order The Gumbo. First time ive tried it and it was really good. Not too spicy but enough to make you want to drink some water. We also ordered the Factory Nachos for our appetizer which was a good amount to feed the 5 of us. And of course babe had to order some Buffalo Wings which were really good too. I ordered a Mimosa for a drink..it was a normal mimosa nothing too special. We ended with the Fudge chocloate tower cake and fresh strawberry cheesecake. Overall i think my mother in law had a good late lunch. BTW our server was really good, her name is Abby. She helped us with everything we needed and she really accomodated to us and our large party. I would definitely go to this location again."
Dee A.,"Victorville, CA",18,3,,1.0,6/14/2017,"I placed an order for orange chicken and red velvet cheesecake, to be delivered via DoorDash. I am less than 3 miles from the restaurant. It cost me 37.00. The chicken, rice and vegetables arrived ICE cold and look like they had been tossed together like a salad.  The chicken was so hard, I couldn't heat it in the microwave, therefore, it was inedible. I called he CCF. They said call DoorDash, who was only available via email. They issued me a 3.99 credit, even after I requested a refund. NEVER AGAIN!!"
Valerie P.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,23,1,2.0,8/11/2016,Both times I have been here in the last month my food was severely over cooked to the point where it was hard to chew. I ordered some sort of fried shrimp sandwhich the first time and the bread was so toasted that it was black on the sides. The shrimp themselves were dry and tough - I expect crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside with anything fried. I had the same problem with the orange chicken. I even told my friend while eating the chicken that it felt like I was eating chicharones  the outside was way too crunchy and didn't taste like anything. I couldn't even cut it with the regularly knife they give you! The brown rice they served it with was severely undercooked and tasted like pebbles... I've been to a few different cheesecake factories and ordered plenty of different dishes and never had this problem. 2 stars cause cheesecake is always on point tho.
Natasha P.,"Fullerton, CA",3,59,4,5.0,5/9/2017,"My family of four has frequented Cheesecake Factory for many, many years. It's down the street from us, has a great menu that satisfies everyone, and has easy parking. We've sat on the patio and inside; both are great. My only qualm about seating is that sometimes the tables are so close to one another that you feel that you're on a date with another couple! The Vegan Cobb Salad is ridiculously good, but Louisiana Chicken Pasta is where it's at. It's massive, so I always have enough to take home for breakfast and lunch the next day. But the most important part of this review is the service...River was our server on Sunday night and he was just absolutely fantastic. He's been our server before, but he was extra awesome on Sunday. As soon as he started talking, I felt like he was at Disneyland. Perky, attentive, and great customer service. He also said some really nice words to my family as we were getting ready to leave, and it made all the difference. I'll do my best to sit in his area next time!"
Sepi E.,"Fullerton, CA",151,103,254,3.0,1/4/2015,"My friend and I only really come here for the bread and butter, avocado eggrolls, and the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. All three are so, so delicious.  I find that the rest of their food is overly greasy and whenever I order anything other than the avocado eggrolls- I regret it.  Service is either really good or quite average. Seating can be difficult on the weekends after like 5 PM."
Ruby S.,"Glendale, CA",140,335,385,1.0,8/2/2016,"TERRIBLE!!!! Be warned!!! Went here for my sisters bday, NEVER AGAIN. First of all they don't take reservations! Went in said party of 11 and they said the wait was 50 minutes and it wasn't even busy. So all of my party was there we went into the bar and got some drinks and appetizers. Our buzzer went off at 1hr 10minutes. We all got up and took our drinks with us. Then they tell us that our table is still not ready. They make us stand there with our cold drinks all 11 of us in the walkway for 10 minutes. We finally sit down! The table is sticky. We asked the bus boy twice to wipe it down and he never came back. Finally the waitress had to wipe it down quickly for us. We ordered and got our food. Then, everyone's food was mildly warm and just mediocre. For $20 a plate I expect the food to be atleast hot or decent... My orange chicken was super dry. Finally the desert comes for my sisters bday. It's a tiny wine glass with a scoop of something chocolate and all whipped cream on top. She finished it all in 3 bites. The bill comes and she puts her 18% tip on there as well. Overall we spent like $250 and 3 hours at the D*** Cheesecake Factory and they didn't even give her a D*** piece of a cheesecake."
Terry D.,"Brea, CA",4,131,10,3.0,10/1/2016,"Great variety of foods & flavors. Of course, outstanding cheesecake. Usually busy. If they tell you 15 minutes, don't believe it. If you have 45 minutes to kill, stay. Otherwise move on."
