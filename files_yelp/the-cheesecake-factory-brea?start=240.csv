Nidia S.,"Winooski, VT",144,29,47,3.0,1/25/2015,"I always feel like this place can be a hit or miss.  So typically the wait time for this particular Cheesecake is always long so make sure to get there early, especially on a weekend. Also there isn't much seating if you have to wait so be prepared to stand.  Okay here's my thought on the food: it is delicious and always well made but unfortunately the service here stinks! Terrible service.  It took us an hour to get our bread. Our waitress kept telling us she would bring it and then forget it. We finally got it when our main entrees came out so what was the point ? I know the menu is huge with lots of options but here is what I got: If you are looking to be healthy start off with the Kale Salad (small plate). It was absolutely delicious. The kale was fresh and was lightly drenched in an amazing salad dressing.  Main dish: Katsu Chicken. It was a tad bit spicy so if you don't like spicy beware. The breaded chicken and rice tasted delicious. I got my white rice switched out for brown rice. The meal comes with a creamy hot (spicy) sauce with pairs well with the chicken, rice and veggies. No need for Sriracha.  Dessert: The RED VELVET CHEESECAKE is a must! It totally made up for the terrible and slow service. The cheesecake was absolutely delicious. It was so smooth and not dry. The texture was very moist. Great cheesecake with very fresh coffee. This is the best cheesecake type in my opinion. You will not be disappointed   This place is great. I just wish the service was better. When my party had our food we realized they brought everyone's plate but our waitress forgot my Dads plate. He had to sit there for her to find his food. She also took forever to get our check (over 20 minutes).  If you are going to Cheesecake beware of the long wait times, (unless you are going to the bar), slow service but delicious food!"
Sheila J.,"Placentia, CA",249,414,2139,3.0,1/22/2015,"We arrived at 3:45, on a Thursday. I was already joking to myself that the service may be slow, due to the time frame. That was a correct assumption.  We already knew our drink AND food order, by the time we were greeted, which was easily around 5 minutes after being sat. A pet peeve of mine, are crumbs on the benches. These had many. Tacky. Not to mention we all nearly fractured a tailbone or sphincter muscle, on the thin, hard benches.  The server was nice, the drinks and food good. The skinny shrimp tacos were amazing. The side salad it came with, was nasty, but the Caesar was done well.  I'd return, with its great location, aesthetic decorations, and food selection/quality, but not during an in-between time, and never in a bench!"
Helen O.,"Walnut, CA",65,17,10,5.0,2/8/2016,"Everytime i visit Cheesecake Factory I am never disappointed ! They keep the bread and butter coming and their food is always good!! Plus this hot waiter Vic helped me out, you can tell he's been doing this for awhile or hes very good because he was beyond attentive and very sweet! Everytime i come here i am going to ask for him LOL ..  Recommend the Mac and Cheese Balls mmmm oh and the Cashew Chicken Salad so yummy."
Anna C.,"La Habra, CA",55,19,2,5.0,3/13/2016,"The food is always awesome,  but sometimes the service isn't. However,  Nikki was the best server ever. If you are visiting this location ask for her.  She is attentive and kind.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon and she still managed to give every table in her section the same great service with a beautiful smile.  She was patient with my nieces and that always gets high marks in my book.  Five stars to Nikki!"
Cari S.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,22,9,4.0,4/21/2016,"Amazing service. I'd definitely go back.  We only went here to have dinner because we had a gift card, if I'm being totally honest.  But after the service we received, I'll go back here often. It was a Saturday night and we had a party of six, including my toddler. There was a 45 minute wait that ended up taking more like an hour (at least it felt that way). The place seemed chaotic near the host desk. I was not expecting to have a pleasant dinner. But then we were seated, the host apologized for the wait (even though he had nothing to apologize for, the crowd there was insane). The waiter came right away, took our drink order, brought bread, and soon after took our order. To my surprise (and delight) he offered to bring the kids (my 1 1/2 year old and my 11 year old nephew) their food right away. YES PLEASE! That was our saving grace.  He continued to surprise us with quality service (something I didn't expect on such a busy night) and he never seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. None of the service did, in fact. They were so calm, I barely noticed how busy the restaurant was.  The kids were happy, we were happy, the food was great. They even have a ""low calorie"" menu which I ordered from. Delicious.  We'll definitely go back."
Kari T.,"Los Angeles, CA",429,433,335,2.0,3/17/2015,"Happy hour says they go until 7, but they really don't. There was one time I got there around 6 and the bar tender let me order off the happy hour menu until just before 7. So I feel like if they want to give it to you they will...but whatever. Don't advertise it if it's not true.  The food is pretty whatever and over priced. I definitely come here for the cheese cake."
T C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",10,372,,4.0,8/28/2016,"Really digging their sweet corn tamales right now.  And those buffalo wings, dry.  Very meaty."
M T.,"Downey, CA",1,48,30,4.0,9/25/2016,First time at the Brea location and the service was excellent! Our server Vitaly was terrific! He made great recommendations too!!
Nesly I.,"Long Beach, CA",76,30,15,5.0,10/7/2016,Always good but it just keeps getting busier. I love that they've added healthier meals on the menu. Lemon chicken piccata pasta and luau salad are my faves.
Tom F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",17,54,,3.0,9/6/2016,"3 stars because the food was yummy. My daughter and I love cheesecake factory but it has been hit or miss lately with the service. We usually go to fashion island but went to Brea. Micheal was our server and very friendly. When we arrived we were told the wait would be 20 minutes and it was.  We were seated and ordered water. We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. It was a while and still were waiting for our food. Our waiter said he would try to speed up the salad. We ordered Fried Zuccini and an Asian Salad. About 5 minutes later, people who were seated 5 minutes after us got their salad, same as ours. The people next to us, seated after us, got their Pizza!. The table behind that was seated about 10 minutes after us got their burgers and apps, including zuccini.  We still sat with no food. Our salad came out, no zuccini. Then our zuccini. It was pretty strange, 2 of the 3 table that got their food before us had the same waiter as us.  Again, hit or miss on the service"
Natalie G.,"La Puente, CA",20,138,254,5.0,1/27/2016,"Came in on a Sunday around 4 , a little bit of a wait but not too bad. The food was delicious , ordered the everything pizza . Vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert , was the perfect place for our girls night out and also celebrating a friends birthday. The wait time was waaaaaaaay too long when we left so the earliest the better."
Audrey R.,"Arpajon, France",31,71,137,4.0,5/23/2015,"I am a big fan of The big bang theory , so when my friends asked me where I wanted to eat I immdiately answered ""Cheesecake factory!"" If you go to this restaurant for lunch or dinner and you want to enjoy a meal + a dessert, I really recommend you to order a small meal to be hungry for the cheesecake because otherwise you wont have the chance to eat the best dessert ever ! I order a small plate called ""Fresh basil, tomato and cheese flatbread"" for $6. It was perfect because after I was hungry enough to eat my favorite cheesecake : the original !! (I ordered it with strawberries toppings , it is called Fresh strawberry cheesecake) for $7-$8. Another thing to know is that it is a very fat dessert, very high in calories, so after eating only 1 cheesecake (without meal), you will feel completely full!! I love the original cheesecake, I am gonna miss it back in France ! Ps: our waitress was very bad we waited for a very long Time each Time"
Tina M.,"Fullerton, CA",248,29,20,5.0,4/1/2016,"Even through there are so many items on the menu I usually order the same entrée. Last night I tried the CHICKEN WITH LEMON COUSCOUS Chicken Breast Served Over Couscous and Quinoa Sauteed with Spinach, Kale, Green Beans, It was delicious!  The lemon and kale flavors made a healthy meal taste great. The server was friendly too!"
Beca H.,"Arcadia, CA",9,117,62,5.0,4/21/2015,"Came here with the family and had a great time.  Great food.  Great prices.  And great service. You can ask for more.   I also really like the windows throughout the restaurant. There is so much natural light, it's really nice."
Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",171,217,150,4.0,11/10/2014,This has always been one of my favorite restaurants. This place has really good pasta. I ordered the fettuccini alfredo  with sun dried tomatoes. This dish was excellent!! Of course i can't leave here without ordering cheesecake. I highly recommend if your a peanut butter lover like myself the Adams Peanut Butter cheesecake.. It doesn't get better then that. Big thank you to our server Julia who gave my friend and I excellent service.
W445 F.,"Tustin, CA",0,10,5,3.0,4/15/2017,Portions were smalller than expected leaving room for their cheesecake.  Service was great
L Z.,"Fullerton, CA",67,58,23,5.0,8/28/2016,Always good but it just keeps getting busier. I love that they've added healthier meals on the menu. Lemon chicken piccata pasta and luau salad are my faves.
Lo H.,"Buena Park, CA",1,30,20,1.0,5/28/2016,The service at nine pm is really bad. The food quality was poor compared to the other times I've been to other cheesecake factories. The bread was dry and old. The meat of the burger was too rare and the bun was hard. I ordered a medium well but the meat was rare af... Everything was overcooked. The water cup leaked.
Anita O.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2,25,26,3.0,9/6/2016,I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and love the entree portions. I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go and I noticed that the slice was relative small.  The container was much bigger that the slice.  Is this an intentional act by the Cheesecake Factory?
Nessa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1246,230,796,3.0,9/4/2014,"This is a beautiful restaurant. It's usually very cold, but it sure looks lovely! They have amazing cheesecake! As that should be expected because of the name!  Also, it is pricey ($17+ with Tax for a Chicken Caesar Salad)! Their meals are okay and the service is alright from my different experiences. I think it's worth it and especially nice to come here to get a cheesecake and enjoy the beautiful ambiance, just as long as you bring a sweater! ;D"
