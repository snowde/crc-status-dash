Pamela A.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/1/2017,"This chain is normally great, the food is delish and normally the service is pretty good; this 1 star review is just to make note about my last experience at this location, and hopefully might get the right persons attention so this problem can be addressed.  It was a Friday night around 930 that me and a friend arrived; we are both friendly people and we're friendly to the greeter/ front desk hostess who we initially greeted because she did not greet us, nor did she respond to us greeting her ; I believe the only thing she asked was ""for 2?"" during the interaction, with an attitude. She gave my friend and I the feeling of being looked down on, which we let roll off our shoulders, but can be more upsetting for the next person. I don't know if she was having a bad day or if she's just a b word all the time; just being frank. And wanted to make this review because this person was the greeter at this we'll known establishment; I know I wouldn't want my business being represented by greeters that do not even know how to greet, especially on a Friday night, just puts a sour start to the experience"
George H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/14/2016,Today was not a good day here at the CHEESECAKE factory.  1. Bartender male picked his nose and then asked would I like something to drink 2. Female bartender then came over and leaned in over to us like she was exhausted and asked are you ready to order 3. Bread basket came out after we requested it and it was like bricks 4. Our food came and my beans were cold and sauce was drenched over the meal Not a good day. I expected better for a $50 meal
Dylan L.,"Dallas, TX",574,10,11,1.0,5/6/2016,"This is probably the worst service ever. We had a reservation for a large party of 37 and when we got there, they said we would have to wait an hour to be seated! What is even the point of making a reservation if we have to wait just as long if no longer. Very dissatisfied with management. Where else would we go? The wait for other nearby competition was 1-2 hours, and Cheesecake Factory really poorly handled this situation."
MR. T.,"Fullerton, CA",5,57,5,2.0,5/31/2016,"Ate here for an anniversary dinner.  Ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Chicken & Shrimp Gumbo.   The bread they first served was old and the sour dough almost broke my teeth it was so hard.  Next, the food was very late and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. They brought our food and the Madeira was overcooked and the the Gumbo was so runny that the even the waitress said its usually not that runny.  Too bad because it was good so I had it replaced with the Jambalaya.  It was dry and not very good but I ate it anyway because by this time I was starving.  My first runny dish was more flavorful. They did give us a free cheesecake, but I wished they would've spent time cooking our first dishes better.  They were not even that busy.  The manager said they were backlogged which i understand but then prepare the food better.  Disappointed."
John D.,"Whittier, CA",303,205,1680,5.0,8/4/2014,"Not that you need an excuse to eat cheesecake, but July 30 was National Cheesecake Day. The Cheesecake Factory celebrates every year by offering dine-in customers any slice of cheesecake at half price. This year they stretched the celebration across two days, July 30-31. Like Kool & The Gang ""Celebration"" song goes ""WOO HOO"".  At this time every year, they traditionally introduce a new cheesecake flavor. This year it's Lemon Meringue, a lemon cream topped with lemon mousse and meringue on a vanilla crumb crust. It would be my choice today. Tasted so smooth, creamy and full of calories. I enjoyed every bite! My wife had a slice of Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake while my daughter chose the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake. The comical sight for me to watch them thoroughly pulverize their cheesecake with grace and elegance in silence was priceless.  The portions are big enough to share, but who wants to share a slice of pure pleasure. Eat slow, take small bites and you'll be fine. You and your blood-sugar level will live on the edge today."
Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,596,4341,5.0,12/16/2013,"This is one ritzy place. And now I know they sell way more than cheesecake. In fact, the other options on their menu, (that which can be characterized as ""real food"") is probably better than the desserts.  Just about everything here is delicious, as far as I know. What I love is the sheer variety they offer. Yes, even healthy options for those of us who need to still fit into our skinny jeans the following day. It all boils down to your preferences. I always prefer to visit restaurants like these with friends or family so that we can order different menu items that catch our eye, and share them. And although the price is right, it certainly doesn't hurt to share the bill.  Curious about some of the menu items? Well, here are some of the delicacies my family and I enjoyed: 1.) Crusted Pretzel Chicken: Crispy, juicy chicken strips on a skewer, made with crushed pretzel bits and served with 2 different sauces. 2.) Chicken & Mushroom Lettuce Wraps: Light and healthy Asian -style lettuce wraps with diced chicken & mushrooms, & dried noodle bits. (FYI: The lettuce is romaine lettuce, so the chicken, mushrooms, & noodle bits are hard to grab). 3.) Parmesan Polenta Fries- Mild & creamy polenta cheese sticks, topped with parmesan cheese, and served with a side of marinara sauce. Don't expect the cheesy mozzarella sticks you find at other restaurants. This is more of a soft, creamy cheese.  4.) Avocado, Mushroom, & Zucchini Fries- Amazingly savory pieces of fried veggies served with 2 different sauces. My favorite are the mushrooms. Those are some juicy little bites of fried heaven. Veggie or not, though, I wouldn't count them as healthy. Even the endless portions of free bread they bring to your table are amazing. My favorite is that black, whole grain bread with oats. I used to think it was burnt beyond recognition, but it turns out to be soft, chewy, and subtly sweet. Try it with a bit of honey that they bring to your table. It's really good. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, but even the booze looks & sounds great, here. They have almost every cocktail, martini, & beer you can imagine. The service is usually friendly, and as for the price: 4 of us ate to our hearts' content for a little over $46. You can't beat that."
Cara C.,"Tempe, AZ",76,2,,5.0,10/11/2016,Amazing service here! Also huge portions for a perfect price. This will always be one of my favorite places. We were seated fast and food came out quickly and our waitress was really patient with me and my girlfriend who were really incisive.
Atis S.,"Brea, CA",14,20,32,4.0,11/3/2015,"Took my aunt from oversea for lunch. I wanted her to experience America and feel like an American as much as possible before she went back to her motherland.  Here's my review for this particular branch: Great service. The waiters were friendly and attentive. Food was decent, but a bit bland (it's an American restaurant so) as usual. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper. Also, White chocolate raspberry cheesecake is a must try."
Karla O.,"Orange, CA",58,50,4,5.0,7/17/2016,"My husband and I will typically go to this Cheesecake Factory location or the Spectrum and we've never been disappointed with service here. The wait is usually not too bad and service is always great. Last night though, we only waited 15 minutes to be seated, they seated us at a booth (yay!), our server Russell was awesome and they said that our dinner took too long to come out so they gave us complimentary egg rolls on the house because of it.. Whaaaaat?! That was so sweet of them and exceeded our expectations of customer service! Thanks guys!"
Dolores M.,"Balboa, CA",0,12,,4.0,9/22/2016,"We go there once a week!  Great food, ambiance, and service!  Especially notable is ""Jennifer""!   She really went out of her way to make sure that our experience was the best!  Thanks Jennifer! The Martins"
Will C.,"Garden Grove, CA",188,190,114,5.0,1/3/2015,"It was the post Christmas rush but they seemed to have adequate staff for the busy rush and the wait list..  We got here without a reservation but got on the list by having my GF jump out while I parked.  Carley seated us quickly and had the high chair for the 3-yr old at the table when we rolled up to it.  The transition from Stroller to chair was smooth thanks to a well trained staff and lickety split timing. If you're in this situation , get a menu and be ready to order b4 you get to the table! Tyler came right away to take our order and the Artichoke appetizer arrived in five minutes. The food was good I meal was excellent all in all a good experience specially at that time of year. Well recommended we will return."
Car L.,"Buena Park, CA",3,53,25,1.0,9/19/2015,"I was in the mood for brunch, so I got their breakfast sandwich brioche. It was busy, so the service was subpar. When I got my meal, I noticed the bread was so soggy...I couldn't enjoy the sandwich itself. Then, I find a walnut/cashew in my egg. What the hell!! I am allergic. They could have killed me if I ate it. I get anaphylaxis. Thank god for the soggy bread, only thing that made me break the sandwich. I placed my life at risk today...I get to live another day! I will start carrying my epipen around now!"
R S.,"La Habra, CA",5,40,4,5.0,3/1/2016,The best cheesecake I have ever had!!  Love the seating outside as inside quiet noisy! Great friendly staff and if your celebrating a special occasion they make it extra special for you!
Rebekah M.,"Fullerton, CA",82,43,24,5.0,10/19/2014,"Came here this past week, at around 8:30pm and I didn't think it was going to be packed because it was a Thursday night, but it was crowded. Luckily, we didn't wait too long. I loved the ambiance because it was so romantic! Dim lighting, single candle in the middle of your table for two, and even though it was loud everywhere, I was still able to focus on my handsome date.  We ordered the avocado egg roll as an appetizer, we weren't interested. It was kind of bland and the sauce didn't make it any better. I did like the stuff that came around it, looked like styrofoam, but tasted like air, it was interesting.  We both had the combo, salmon with Dianne steak. Fell in love with the salmon immediately! I'm glad I had it first because the steak is more heavy; along with the mashed potatoes. I couldn't finish everything because I just ate too much and there wasn't much left, so I decided to not box the rest.  We ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. I honestly didn't think it was going to be a chocolate overload, but if you don't think that there's no such thing as ""too sweet"" or ""too chocolatey,"" then this is your cheesecake! But for my boyfriend and I, we won't be getting that one again...our fault.  Overall, I liked that we didn't wait long. The food was good, as well as the service. Gabriella always came to check up on us, which was really nice!"
Kelly B.,"Buena Park, CA",121,12,,5.0,7/30/2015,"Being ""national cheesecake day"" you have to go in open minded..they are going to be busy.. there is going to be a wait.. and the servers are going to do the best they can with what support they have behind them.. our waitress Justine was awesome! positive spirt and great service under all the craziness! did we  Have to wait 20mins for our cheesecake..yes, were they out of the one i usually get..yes; did it ruin my night.. absoultly not! so before one can go on yelp and post a negitive review.. just a thought..dont go on a day that is meant to be one of the busiest days for them.. and you'll save yourself from being upset.."
Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,4.0,1/25/2016,"Food is good, service was great. However on weekends, with no reservations allowed we waited for a party of 6 adults and 2 children a total of 2 hours for a patio table.  The little ""pager"" never went off and they had to come outside and shout for our party. We were told the wait would be 1 to 1.5 hours. Arrived at 630pm and left around 930pm. So service and dining was quick. However the fries were over cook but the new Skinylicious menu is pretty great,even if they didn't have the Turkey burger that night."
Me'lani W.,"Walnut, CA",0,3,1,5.0,8/10/2017,"It was 9pm and I was looking for a Chinese Chicken Salad for the last 2 hours in Rowland Heights, and either the restaurants didn't have it or were closed. Finally Cheesecake Factory popped up and they closed at 11pm. YES. I was FINALLY going to get my salad fix! I called around 10:40 and asked if it's too late to place an order to go. I get there about 10:55 and they greeted me with a warm welcome despite how late I came in. I paid for my order and WOW this salad is HUGE! I asked if I could add the pumpernickel bread to my order and the cashier said ""of course!"" She came back with very warm bread wrapped in foil with sides of butter, no charge! I drove 30 minutes home before eating my salad. Dressing on the side as well as the wonton crisps. The salad was delicious and the mandarin oranges were so refreshing! This salad satisfied my cravings and I was able to share with my 2 sisters and have lots leftover! We will be coming back soon!"
Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,2.0,7/13/2014,"Lacks consistency  I've been here so many times and I still can't tell if I like this particular location.  I've had some great experiences and some pretty terrible experiences.  My last visit was not my favorite. This last visit was a Friday night at 8pm.  It was shockingly more crowded than I thought it would be at 8pm- it was pretty packed and held a steady 45min wait. Long wait is fine, but  throughout dinner it was clear that they were understaffed and it made it a fairly unpleasant time. Aside from the regular taking orders and delivering food, we didn't see our waiter much at all.  I'm sure he was busy, but it just wasn't with us- the staff was stretched pretty thin.  Refills and additional requests were very hard to come by.  My order came out wrong- not the waiters fault, the cook added random stuff to my burger that it doesn't come with and I needed it remade.  Normally that's a pain, but even more so that night because of the sparse staffing.  I finally got it taken back, but now other people you are eating with feel compelled to wait.  That's always annoying especially when it's a careless mistake. When the burger came back it was made correctly and the food was legitimately delicious.  That's why we keep coming back- the food rarely disappoints.  It's just everything else that's iffy.  If they could handle staffing better, it would make a better experience for the guest.  Everyone seemed to be waiting a long time for simple requests and the neighboring table chatter indicated everyone was as put off as we were. The bottom line- if you come here during a busy time, be prepared for long waits and have patience."
Michelle G.,"Anaheim, CA",25,7,36,1.0,6/21/2015,"We went there for my son's birthdays, bought two cakes, and candles  and asked them to please hold till the end. About an hour and a half into dinner we hear singing across the room, another bday. Cool!!!,  We then ask for our cakes please, with my son's candles on them. Now just to let you know the cakes that were being held had both my son's names written on them.  20 minutes later the manager tells us the cakes were given to a party of ten just earlier. He said he would chomp a piece of cake for my whole family. Heh I don't think so sir, I just dropped$200 on a mediocre meal and you lost $50.00 worth of cakes. Thumbs down here."
Paul A.,"San Dimas, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/28/2017,Worst experience ever. The waitress was extremely rude. Asked for blackened salmon brought half cooked pink salmon. Manager said that is the way they cook. Took it back and destroyed it.
