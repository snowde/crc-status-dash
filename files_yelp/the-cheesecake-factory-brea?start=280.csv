Julie T.,"Orange, CA",106,128,146,4.0,11/16/2015,"This location is located close to a shopping mall. It is in the same parking lot, but not inside the mall. Cheesecake factory will always guarantee the same 'ol consistency that people love. The menu is so extensive, the servers don't even know what is on the menu. I have had the fish tacos, which is great. It comes out as a huge portion and could easily feed two people. The fried zucchini is the best I have ever had.  Most recently, I had the fish and chips and they really do give you a lot of food. I believe I had 6 pieces of fish in my basket which normally, at any other restaurant, you are only given 2-3 pieces.  I have had their factory nachos as an entree even though it is an appetizer, and I'd have to say that that could feed a whole family as an entree. I barely made a dent into it and I was full.  Cheesecake factory is really successful, and I can see why. You get a lot of food, and you don't have to end up spending an arm and a leg. Service here is alright, I heard two female bartenders talking about how they'd rather go home and complain about how they were open past 11 o'clock. This really bothers me because they should really staff people who want to work rather than people who would complain on the job."
April G.,"Chino Hills, CA",147,95,91,5.0,11/28/2015,"What's left to say! Pricey but quality and portion size is well worth it. Appetizers on point, cocktails on point and service on point! Can't give anything less than 5 stars!"
Naheed B.,"Temecula, CA",209,17,8,5.0,7/24/2016,"Absolutely fantastic service. Went for lunch with family after an exhausting wedding the day before and this was midway between the hotel and back to our respective homes. The servers took such good care of us even though we had a bouncing 8 month baby. they filled water and checked up on us, and our server provided great food recommendations. go to this cheesecake factory! right off the street so you cant miss it and you avoid the crazy mall parking."
Diane R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/20/2017,Just sat for at least 10 minutes and we weren't even asked if we wanted a glass of water. Bad service!!! At least let me know you're too busy to take my order.
Joe P.,"Anaheim, CA",137,39,129,5.0,11/1/2016,"came here for dinner with the family on sunday for my sister's birthday and it was a great experience as usual.  the food is great, the service is excellent, and we left very full with leftovers.  as usual, this place delivers on a great meal any time.  always come back to this location in particular.  Thank you!!!"
Destinee G.,"West Covina, CA",5,37,34,4.0,11/10/2015,Food was pretty average....i got the bbq/ranch chx salad and it was pretty good!!! The service was great...table of 10 (business lunch). The cheesecake is the real star of the show!!!
Manar A.,"Placentia, CA",144,130,38,3.0,11/7/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good idea for big groups. Guaranteed that everyone will find something that they like. Haven't been here in a couple years up until last night. We were seated outside as it was the first available seating. There was one heat lamp near us and we asked our severe and FOUR times if they could turn it on because it was so cold. They never turned it on, we ended up turning it on ourselves, which we would have done to begin with but the person who seated us said he would have to get someone to turn it on.  Also, we waited and waited for our bread, but it never came. We asked them and they were like ""oh you never got it?"" So, dinner comes out and we still don't have bread, kind of defeated the purpose l, but we reminded them again and we finally got our bread...after dinner!  I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with town rice instead of the white rice it usually comes with. It was surprisingly delicious!! I will get it to go next time because I would rather not deal with their service, luckily I had a good time with friends and we were too busy catching up to get hung up on it."
Caydie C.,"Corona, CA",259,32,31,2.0,7/16/2015,When I think about cheesecake factory food  I think about how horrible it was to work at this location. Food is great! But working for This company has ruined my appetite.
Bangjin C.,"Pomona, CA",1,14,,4.0,11/3/2016,"The Cheese Factory has some types of food, and I ate the beef which was so delicious and big. The service was so good because we had a friendly and kind waiter. He constantly asked us whether we need help. I also ate the delicious cheesecake. I will go the restaurant next time when I have enough time."
Y T.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,17,,2.0,3/16/2016,"most of the time when I dine at a cheesecake factory the food is fairly descent but I just dined at the brea location and the breakfast potatoes (cubed) with onions was horrible! they were over cooked, burned, and none of us could hardly find any onions. the scrambled eggs were also over done and dry. the english muffins were under toasted as they were almost as white as they come in a package. service was also slow as it took some time to get some of our water refills after asking several times during our time there. the coffee refills came steadily though. we were there for a birthday and we were told we would receive a complimentary dessert but it was never offered to us even though we brought a small cake of our own. It's not a huge deal about the complimentary dessert but you would figure you would be asked anyhow. hopefully the corp. chef of the cheesecake factory will look into this overcooked foods as we were a little taken back by the fact that the runners and even management didn't question the cooks back there that the potatoes were obviously burned, etc... I would not send that dish or the others with the same potatoes out of the expo window. best retrain your staff a little as it will make a difference. good luck!"
Catrina L.,"La Habra, CA",0,8,2,5.0,7/25/2016,Best time everything with Leah! She made awesome suggestions and the food was fantastic . I loved the cucumber and hibiscus lemonade. The Super Toasts were delish!
Viviana V.,"Fullerton, CA",25,88,12,1.0,7/8/2015,"Ok so im giving this place one star because Yelp wont let me give any less and the ""chicken Bellagio"" I ordered was pretty good. I like the flavor combinations on that plate.  Ok first of all we were seated way at the back near the kitchen. Which meant every few seconds we hear the loud band of servers slamming the dishes into the sink. There was a disgusting odor of either dirty mop or nasty dish rag. This was the ongoing argument between me and my boyfriend on and off through the dinner. He thought it was dish rag while I insisted it was dirty mop..anyway.... The server came and took our drink orders rather quickly but after bringing our drinks she dissapeared for a long time. After our order was taken we waited about 15 minutes for them to bring us bread which was rock hard and cold.  We got our  appetizer the ""firecracker salmon"" this is the biggest rip off ever. We got a plate of four greasy pieces of deep friend wonton like pockets. The taste was bland and way over priced for the amount you get. Do not order that appetizer. Plus it took forever for this to come out. Over 20 minutes.  I have been here before and this experience was not good at all. We asked for more bread and a server ran by and slammed our bread on the table and ran off. We had to flag someone else down for more butter. Either way the service and the fact that it smelled so gross in there ruined this dining experience. Its way to expensive to have such a bad experience. Very dissapointing considering its such a nice looking restauraunt. I was so annoyed by the end of the dinner I didnt even want any cheescake..: ("
Andrew P.,"Orange County, CA",509,711,317,4.0,9/17/2015,It's still a favorite.  Not cheap but not super expensive and you do get what you pay for.  We came here for lunch and I ordered the Hibachi Steak with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and my wife got the seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  Both were well prepared and the portions were great. The bread is always nice as well. What makes this meal even better was we used a gift card to pay.  Can't wait to come back again.
Jocelyn N.,"Fullerton, CA",1,7,1,3.0,8/6/2016,"I usually love coming to Cheesecake Factory but unfortunately this visit was not. My waitress seemed very unexperienced for the amount of tables she was attending. The wait for her to take our order was about 35 minutes.. She didn't even ask if we we're ready to order. The food was great, but the service was not. I am very understanding that Saturday's are very busy but that doesn't mean you leave a customer unattended. I do not plan on returning to The Cheesecake Factory of Brea."
Tatiana D.,"Downey, CA",51,27,11,1.0,5/3/2015,"Let's start off with the fact that we signed in as a party of 5... We get called and they put us down as a party of 2. Then tried to squish us in a 4 seater. The manager was accommodating and helped us get a bigger booth for our bigger group though. Let me just say that I don't care how good the food is if the service is bad. Kylie our waitress was in a bad mood, everytime we would ask for something she rolled her eyes. She brought our drinks but no sweetener said she would be right back with it and then started taking another tables order. My boyfriend had to get up and get the sugar himself...how hard is it to bring sugar. We always come to this location because typically the service is good but today that was not the case. I had told the host that today was my sons birthday and our waitress forgot brought our check and my bf had to remind her and she said she ""spaced out"" Snobby girl, she needs to get another job!"
Jane L.,"Chino, CA",196,307,2328,4.0,8/6/2012,"As far as Cheesecake Factory locations go, this one is really consistent with their food and service.  Here's what I usually order: *Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Generous portions of the pasta. The bow ties are cooked to perfection and I like the cream sauce. *Thai Lettuce Wraps - Yes this isn't a real Thai dish at all but I do enjoy eating it. I liked the grilled chicken and the curry noodles along with the sauces they provide. The lettuce that they provide usually fresh.  Cheesecakes Recommendations *Snickers Bar Cheesecake *Kahlua Cheesecake  *Tiramisu Cheesecake!  Service is usually good. The servers are pretty attentive. Sometimes they'll box our items. There are also times when we ask to get to-go cups for strawberry lemonade that they will give us entirely new strawberry lemonades in cups. Overall, I like this location and will be back for another visit!"
James G.,"Anaheim, CA",255,5,,2.0,8/5/2015,I got engaged and went to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate because I never been there before. Our waitress was rude and as we were being seated she rolled her eyes at the host seating us as if she was pissed. She wanted to charge me for deciding to switch beverages after I finished my coke. We didn't get a celebratory cheesecake or any type of congratulations from our waitress. We felt like we couldn't even ask for extra blue cheese for our salad.  The food was good but the overall experience was disappointing. Fortunately it didn't ruin our big day.
Randi B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",216,1184,1903,3.0,7/29/2012,"Over the years I have been here a handful of times for family dinners or things with friends. The food is pretty good, but overpriced. The menu is huge and I know I have tried a few different things that I have enjoyed. I never really choose to come here on my own, as I would rather try new places than continue to frequent this chain. On Saturday we were in Brea and wanted breakfast. I remembered having a good breakfast here a couple years ago so I suggested we come here. Well, they do have breakfast, but a limited menu. It looks like Sunday is the day to go, because that menu was much bigger and had better options. BF ordered the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich which was eggs, bacon, ham, tomato, cheese and mayo on a Brioche Roll. It was pretty good, I should have ordered that. I got the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito (the waiter said was a very good choice) which is a massive burrito filled with eggs, chicken chorizo, potatoes, peppers and onions. It is topped with salsa, an avocado and tomatillo cream sauce, and cilantro. When they brought the burrito they also gave me a separate plate with black beans on it. For this burrito having so many ingredients that sound awesome, the flavor just wasn't there for me. I ate about half of it and I only saw a couple pieces of chorizo (which wasn't spicy at all) and there were way more potatoes than eggs. The black beans on the side were kind of weird to me, so I tossed some on the plate and mixed it up with the burrito. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me.  Breakfast, with an iced tea and a Mocha Milkshake, was $40. Ehhh, this seemed more like a $20 breakfast to me, but again, this place is overpriced. I'm sure I won't be back again until my boyfriend's family wants to go here to celebrate a birthday."
Farid J.,"Fullerton, CA",38,36,6,5.0,6/30/2016,"We had a great server and I was happy to see they had a ""skinny,"" menu. I think this in particular separates them from the competition to me. Food was good as was the service. Had a good time, will be back and no complaints."
Cathy R.,"La Habra, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/29/2017,"Terrible customer service. It was a hot afternoon (lunch), but since we'd seen some vacant shady tables when we walked up, we asked for a table on the patio. We were sat at a table. The table was made of stone and much hotter than the ambient 91 degrees outside.  It was halfway in the sun, and so hot to the touch, you couldn't touch it. There was a table in the shade next to us, so we asked to move. The server said she could try to move us inside, as the one table in the shade, that had been vacant since we sat down, might be taken. She was gone about 5-10 minutes, during which time the before mentioned table was untouched ( there were also the shady tables we saw when we walked up, but we were told that they weren't currently seating anyone at those tables.). A head server came by and said she could seat us inside but we'd have to go wait in line for it. Awkward since we had already been served bread and drinks. We asked why we couldn't sit at the still vacant shady table and were told that someone was ""getting ready"" to be sat there. I said ""okay then. Just bring us the bill for the drinks"" that were  just a soda and a club soda.  She told us we'd have to wait for our server. We just walked out.  We won't be going back.."
