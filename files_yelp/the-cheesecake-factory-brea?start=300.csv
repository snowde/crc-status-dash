Derek T.,"Orange, CA",117,40,8,2.0,10/8/2016,"Came in with a party of about 28 last night. Their servers don't wear name tags so I'm not sure of her name, and she certainly did not introduce herself. She merely came over, we were sitting in the middle section of the party, and told us that she's going to be taking orders. I asked if we could order family style for the group of four that was closest to her including myself, her eyes popped out apparently upset before scribbling furiously onto her notepad. The group of 4 next to us, asked for a separate check to which she sighed and rudely asked them, ""WELL ARE YOU GOING TO BE MOVING AROUND? I CANT PROMISE YOUR FOOD WILL BE COMING TO YOU IF YOURE GOING TO BE MOVING AROUND."" She wasn't yelling but she was certainly being rude. I felt very uncomfortable every time she walked by. She seemed less annoyed with us after she Input the order but I don't know, it was not a very enjoyable evening. This service was completely lackluster. 1. No introduction, 2. The rude service is not necessary 3. There is no need to sigh at us if the request is too difficult IMO"
Ian W.,"Dickinson, ND",33,74,8,4.0,5/24/2014,"Chicken little?   You mean three chickens on a plate?   Newcastle on tap was out and so was the crab so we thought they were compensating with our entree portion size.   Juuuuust kidding, I guess 5 pieces of fish for fish and chips and a literal mountain of chicken is normal.  Natalie needed an oxygen tank to survive at the top.   Its a chain so you can't expect the home made feel but for what you pay it's pretty good.  Service was attentive for how busy it was on a Saturday evening.  Overall not too bad. Oh, and don't be the douche who thinks he's funny and asks if Penny is working."
Vanessa G.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Just ordered the lemon shrimp pasta at Cheesecake Factory in brea from the skinny menu. I was totally disgusted when I noticed all of my shrimp were dirty. The chef didn't bother to devein the shrimp and the angel hair pasta was cold and clumped together. I alerted the manager and he didn't apologize he just offered to make me a new one. He just didn't care. And on top of that he didn't comp my meal. The reordered meal had tough chewy shrimp and the tips of my asparagus were cut off. I just had asparagus stems. Wow!!! I will never eat there again. I am advising everyone to stay clear of this particular Cheesecake Factory unless you like eating shrimp with poop still in it. I also told the hostess as she showed us our table that it was my daughters birthday.  She nodded her head and said ok and that was it. Love the Cheesecake Factory but this location you should skip. On a happier note my waitress was very professional.  To make matters worse, I was told to contact them by using contact us then was told to select general and there is no such thing. Ive never been so frustrated with this restaurant. My server Nicole was very pleasant we sat at table 324 outside which had a beautiful view but the thought of them serving uncleaned shrimp and ignoring my daughters birthday was disappointing. After looking at my receipt I just realized the waitress entered my order twice and then removed the error with comp food/drink. I wasn't comped for anything!!!!! I will be sure to alert everyone on Facebook as well regarding the awful experience!!!!!"
Star G.,"Fullerton, CA",2,15,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Really liked this place. I ordered the lobster dip (an appetizer) for my meal so I would have enough room for dessert. I would order that again! My kid had grilled cheese, she was not impressed, said it was like any other grilled cheese. We had the tuxedo cheesecake. Slice was generous. Wait times can be long, if you have time to kill then ok, if you prefer to be in an out in 2 hours or less this is probably not the place for you to go on the weekend."
Shareen D.,"Orange County, CA",104,235,24,5.0,8/15/2014,"Honestly, this is my favorite restaurant.  I always get great food and great customer service and I love the overall ambience.  Their salmon dishes are easily my favorite as I am huge on seafood. Their gumbo comes in second. Don't even get me started on their cheesecake, despite the calories, this place is simply delicious.  Will keep coming back and I haven't had one bad experience thus far. Keep it up!"
Labradog T.,"Arcadia, CA",0,12,,3.0,2/1/2017,We ordered the Kobe Burger and asked the waitress for extra mushroom. She said okay but never told us that we'll be charged extra $3.00 for each.  Waitress was all smile to check on us once but never offered to refill our drinks.Can't complain about the taste of our burger.. it's still the best.
Joshua O.,"Pomona, CA",3,1,,1.0,4/5/2016,"from start to finish poor service!!! 1.(hospitality staff)  requested patio seating. (no wait or line)  was told there was only 1 server working the patio and would have to be seated inside. 2.(server- isela v./bar) ordered a blue moon (draft-beer) from the bar.  after receiving appetizer (buffalo blasts) / then my child's kids order of the corn dogs ( had to return corn dogs -inside full of batter and hot dog cold to touch)/ and main order for my family- i asked my server if the beer was still on the way? the response was ""they did not bring it out?""   3.the kids corn dogs then were brought out after everyone in the family was almost finished eating.  after this happening my family was never approached by your management staff(derick beck-manger working) 4. (closing out check)  once finished and presented with my bill , i promptly handed my visa card to my server isela v. in attempt to leave quickly.  after receiving my receipt i noticed i was double charged for my child's corn dogs ( the one which was improperly cooked). after noticing this i personally walked up to my sever and informed her of yet another mistake of the over charge.  isela v. then related this was a mistake mad by her manager (derek beck).  at this time i followed my server to her manager in order to have the error corrected. upon contacting the manager - it seemed as though he did not know of any of the mishaps which started from the moment i entered your restaurant.  this is when he finally asked about the whole experience did he seem to have concern( also due to the fact i was asking for contact information for the corporate offices). i feel it is not the customers responsibility to bring up any inconsistencies with the restaurant experience.  if i was approached : upon being denied patio seating, not receiving my beer and having to ask for it a second time, my child's food not being properly cooked, and being overcharged for my order, then possibly further mishaps could have been avoided. 5. fixing the over charge.  this was possibly the most uncomfortable experience off all. my initial charge with the over charge was -$97.52.  the manager told me that in order to fix the over charge he would have to run my visa card a second time.  he stated that first charge would not go though but would have to run the card again for the corrected amount of $93.20.  prior to this second transaction i used my smart phone to access my online banking which showed the first charge of $97.52 already pending.  the manager derek beck told me he had to charge my card again and this was my only option.  so i did the secondary charge of $93.20.  after both charges i then had a total of $190.72 pending.  this is unacceptable. the customer should not be bering the burden of a dining experience.          after further conversation with your manager about my discomfort - a $25 gift card was given to me to hopefully smooth over wrong doings.  really? a $25 gift card when you have over $190 of my money pending?  this has left a bad taste in my mouth. from beginning to end i feel your restaurant staff at the brea ca cheesecake factory -failed as a team hospitality staff = fail / did not accommodate to requested patio seating server / bar = unaware of errors with drinks orders not being delivered.  and not checking bills for errors prior to charging guests. bartender not noticing a drink order sitting on there bar top not being delivered. kitchen = fail not properly cooking a child's meal.  corn dog with batter inside and hot dog cold to touch. management = fail not stopping by a table to check with such errors as beer/and food orders. and not taking off the overcharge of the second corn dog order. having the customer to walk up to the manager to have errors fixed and having the guest ask for management information and corporate numbers instead of offering this information. this will not stop me from coming back to the cheesecake factory but has and will make me think twice if this is were i really want to eat at again. hopefully i will not be double charged for both charges that are pending and this can be where it ends. hopefully your company will read this and stop this from occurring again. j. ortiz"
Katie O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",170,41,30,5.0,9/30/2014,"My visits to this location almost always consist of family time.  The food is excellent and the decor is fabulous; however, my favorite part of visiting The Cheesecake Factory at the Brea Mall is the staff. My grandparents are regulars.  When they have treated me to a visit here, I am able to observe customer service at its best.  From the time that we get seated, to the dessert at the end of the meal, the staff is on point.  And if they are not, my grandpa is the first to make sure that he gets what he orders.  The manager has even visited our table a couple of times to make sure that their customers were getting taken care of in a way that supersedes the standard.  I respect that they take the time to listen (or repeat) different menu options or questions.  Or that they ask before refilling my grandma's iced tea.  I see how they respect my grandparents, and in turn, I have a greater respect for this establishment as a whole. P.S. I love the Strawberry Shortcake.  Ask for a fresh biscuit each time you order it, and you will not be disappointed!"
Swetha L.,"Dublin, CA",32,46,35,3.0,8/9/2015,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory. Nothing special. This place is crazy busy as is any other location I've gone to in the Bay Area. This one is really pretty from the outside. I think we waited a good 20 mins to get seated. Our server Lu (or is it liu?) was quite friendly. He had to endure a little bit of a banter from my dad (my dad is really straight forward, so don't take offense to it Lu!).   Service wasn't too bad took some time to get bread and food came out in a decent time. I got the Jamaican shrimp, my mom got the gumbo and my dad got the special salmon of the day. Both my mom and I thought our dishes were meh. Mine was spicy and sweet, which is a flavor I'm not too fond of. The plantains were yummy! My dads salmon was excellent. Other than that, nothing spectacular. Not great nor bad.  And of course the cheesecake is bomb! Got the red velvet one. So good."
Lynn L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",23,168,52,4.0,4/16/2016,"Pretty typical and standard cheesecake factory. The service can be either super slow, or great...I guess it just depends on your server Cuz I've had both. If you order something and are not satisfied, let your server know and they will switch it out for you without any trouble. I love that about this place...I'm never scared to try anything new off their menu!"
Arlene C.,"La Mirada, CA",17,41,42,1.0,2/27/2016,"Went to eat the other day with my family. The worst experience ever. Took forever to be seated obviously was a Sunday so we expexted that. When we did we got seated out in the patio, started raining minutes later which was obvious was gonna happen. We Asked for umbrellas to be opened took about 15 min. My Chicken salad was brown and tasted horrible  Waitress white blouse was stained, bathrooms where overflowing with paper everywhere. Almost walked out with toilet paper stuck to my shoe... never again will i eat there."
Jaslene M.,"Bellflower, CA",0,26,1,5.0,10/3/2015,"This review goes out to Crystal. She was one of the best waitresses I've had, & her food + dessert recommendations were on point! She knew exactly what was good on the menu, and her descriptions proved to be true"
Felicia M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",605,268,842,2.0,11/30/2012,Here is the skinny Wait wasn't that bad even though the waiting area was packed full.  Seated in a booth and the pads of the seats were kind of thin so a little uncomfortable.  Server was good.  Bread always great Stuffed mushrooms were delicious Small salad just ok Herb crusted salmon is always a hit but next time I will get the lemon sauce on the side (way too much lemon) My date ordered the nachos and they were good.  Overall a good dinner but not great.  I felt rushed out and the server gave us our bill before she asked if we wanted desert. I know this is a very busy establishment but let the customers enjoy on not fill rushed out to make room for another party.  If I am paying this much I want better service but it was so busy that I didn't get the attention I wanted. I usually come her for my bday dinner but I won't be back :(
Mona A.,"La Mirada, CA",112,120,392,5.0,4/13/2015,"fourth time at a cheesecake factory, and i must say this location by far is the best.  When i walked in i was greeted by 5 people at once, all very nice young employees. The lady at the stand asked hkw many and i told her 5 for my youngest sister's bday. she quickly sat us and asked for my sisters name. and the location was pretty full housed. maybe only 6 areas open. and about a total of 7 groups outside sitting for dinner.  i my family and i sat at our table and were quickly greeted by another smiling face George our waiter. we explained the 5th person was on her way. so he came back with waters foreceryone and said let me know when you're ready. very kind gentleman and excellent service.  the group finally became 5 and we then placed appetizers first... my crusted macaroni balls yummmmmy and roasted asparagus.. after we all placed our entree orders. George was very honest of what to order asked what we liked in flavor and what we didn't. we all ordered based off his recommendations.  as we waited he made sure our fresh bread basket was never empty. food overall was well worth every penny spent.. my Chicken Romano parmesan crusted entree was AMAZING. everyone enjoyed their plates and George serious was one of the accomodating waiters by far.  i believe weekdays are better then the weekends because the service is 200x's better and its not over crowded.  that and just Brea location has a better staff."
Jasmin M.,"Long Beach, CA",120,32,8,1.0,8/8/2015,"My friend and I came to dinner after stopping by at bjs for a drink. We got sat, the server finally got to our table and took a while for our drinks. I get it, were 2 girls ( I'm a sever, this means 2 girls is less priority than your 4-top) but the fact that Christopher ( is what the check stub said) never came back to check on us is crappy service, and everything came out wrong. Yet he could check on the table, literally right next to us. He was obviously avoiding us.  We then stopped a runner to call for a manager because ""Chris"" never came back. Complained to the manager Veronica. She was really polite, apologized for the mistake. However, the manager then tried to blame the runner, as if it was her fault it came out wrong. Then she explained that Chris was busy that's why he never checked on us. But he checked on the table next to us? All around. The experience was not good. Service was horrible. Food didn't even come how we ordered it. And the management obviously didn't care enough to take care of the problem. And the table next to us agreed, they however, got checked on numerous times and had an OK time.     Next time, go to to bjs. Better service and food."
Katy M.,"Anaheim, CA",10,13,5,5.0,9/12/2015,Always happy here. The food is huge portions for good price  so you can always take some home for later. Every time I try a new dish I am extremely happy and satisfied. Service here is always great. Servers are always efficient and positive. They have a million different types of cheesecake. We never leave without trying a new one
Abby L.,"Cerritos, CA",399,32,86,2.0,3/30/2015,Our server was okay. I came here with my mom AFTER lunch so it wouldn't be too busy. The server didn't ask us if we were ready to order. She just assumed that we weren't. Our free appetizer bread was burned. Like come on. Seriously? I had to waive my hand for a different server to notice me and tell him my order. I've never been this upset by Cheesecake Factory ever. This location doesn't know what they're doing.
Tamika N.,"Brea, CA",0,17,5,4.0,4/17/2015,I LOVE this place. The happy hour was really good and very reasonable. I am completely impressed with the service.  I will be back.
Glen M.,"El Segundo, CA",63,312,577,4.0,3/20/2015,"Really good food but if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be ready to wait. We got there early (so we thought) at 5:30pm and had a 30 minute wait. They don't take reservations because there's always enough people to fill the place.  Their menu is probably 20 pages but half of it is advertising. They added a number of combo plates (pick two) and many of us decided it looked good. However, for most of us, it was disappointing. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory in the past, you get used to fairly large portions. These combos were smaller than expected, especially for the price. Maybe they are now downsizing their portions but for us, as mentioned, it was disappointing.  Service was good however we did have to flag down the wait staff more than once for refills on our drinks (we may have had a newer waitress as our orders also came out in waves and two of us were waiting four minutes for meals while others at our table were eating).  But, really, overall, nothing said will impact their popularity. The place is almost always packed and their food is usually very good. We just had one of those less than stellar experiences. I'm sure our group will choose to go back again one day but the next time we're in Brea, we may try one of the other places in that same area. Hope you enjoy it!"
Debi R.,"Irvine, CA",299,156,57,4.0,2/11/2014,"The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is a chocolate lover's dream. The cheesecake was smooth and creamy with hidden pieces of Godiva chocolate hidden inside.  What a treat to get a piece of chocolate in every bite.  I'm a chocoholic and my craving was more than satisfied when I ordered this. It was big enough to last me 2 days.  I had it for dessert, then breakfast the next day!"
