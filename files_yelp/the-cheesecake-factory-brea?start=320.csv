Brit L.,"Walnut, CA",302,92,87,3.0,7/14/2014,"Came here on a Sat night, and boy was it busy! Good thing is that I only had to wait about 10-15 mins :) & our waiter was super friendly, and was very prompt with everything!  First off, THE MENU IS SO OVERWHELMING ! (It took a good 10 mins just to read everything and figure out what the heck I wanted) They literally have everything, from asian, to italian, to american.. you name it haha.  For the appetizer, I decided to try out the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake and it was very interesting..lol The consistency was kind of mushy ? Like mashed potatoes, and personally I loved the avocados on the dish, but my boyfriend didn't. Also the presentation was nice, but I'd only recommend this dish if you want to try something new.  For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, and it was okay.. It came with some sauce to dip but I didn't really like that so much. Overall, it was kinda bland, and the roasted peppers didn't do it for me."
Lisa L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/7/2016,One star because Customer Service should be a top priority and when you call to make a reservation since you have in the past had to wait 2 hours to be seated and you're told they don't take reservations.  This is inconsiderate poor customer service.  I would understand waiting if I had not attempted to make a reservation due to poor planning but unfortunately this restaurant doesn't allow you to plan they don't see your time as valuable.
Trevor J.,"Mesa, AZ",45,254,91,5.0,4/1/2016,"Eaten here a couple of times and as long as you don't go during peak times, the wait time is fairly short.  It is in a mall though so the wait times are understood if you come during the times.  Food is good, but the real reason to come here is the cheesecake and each slice I try, I love it.  Always fresh and tastes so good."
Flii H.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,9,22,2.0,9/26/2015,Drink  was great now the food on the hand i ask for my steak well done it was still pink when cut it they took it back to recook it cut it again it was still pink. For my first time i would say horrible. The waitress was great she did a good job and knew how to handle the situation
Eva L.,"Fullerton, CA",0,98,242,5.0,8/23/2015,"I love coming to Cheesecake Factory for late-night drinks and food. I love their vast menu! There's always something for everybody! I especially like their avocado egg rolls and dynamite shrimp appetizers, and of course, their exceptional cheesecakes!"
Abcde A.,"Chino, CA",0,75,5,5.0,6/5/2016,I was there Friday with my boss having lunch. We had our papers on the table for a party we r planning. The waitress we had was phenomenal. I wish I could remember her name and I didn't pay for the meal but she served the tables near the waitress stand area At the end of the first isle u walk down right n front of the window. Great service here. Unlike Pasadena where the servers are in abundance and lie to customers. Brea needs to train Pasadena lol.
Mutya P.,"West Covina, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/30/2016,First time here. Went for my nephews birthday we waited almost 3 hours. Front desk sucks! My sister ordered the pork chop and it was red inside the manager said she will give her her business card in case she gets sick tomorrow. Definitely not worth the wait and food was not good and service sucks! I don't really write reviews but I'm making an exception for this place because of the awful experience!
Breanna N.,"Downey, CA",3,37,3,5.0,3/20/2015,"Since it is a chain, most CFs are the same - restaurant layout, menu and service. But this is my most visited location and it never disappoints. Everyone is friendly welcoming and attentive. Wait times are reasonable, and when they tell us it'll be 20 minutes, it really will be a 20 minute wait or less, unlike other restaurants!  A slice of cheesecake is pretty pricey but it IS the CHEESECAKE factory so you have to save room for a slice for yourself or to share. Ive tried numerous flavors but my favorite has to be the original (of course) and oreo. There are so many unique flavors and I wish i can try them all! Other favorites of mine are the passionfruit iced tea and avocado eggrolls!"
Jessie K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,5,4,3.0,5/11/2016,2nd visit this month. I ordered spicy chipotle pasta. My gf ordered chicken picatta. C.picatta was ok. But spicy chipotle pasta was really bad. It was way too sweet n no spicy chipotle flavor at all. The reason I gave 3 star is the server was very friendly and nice. I would definitely not come back
Tami D.,"Orange County, CA",789,616,4877,4.0,11/25/2011,"We received really great service at this Cheesecake Factory location this week. I ordered two of their cheesecakes a couple of days ago (the Low-Carb Cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake-Yum!), but when we went to pick them up yesterday, the restaurant wasn't open yet. Thank goodness for my persistent husband who called them directly. The manager opened the restaurant doors a half an hour early just to make sure we got the cakes to our destinations on time! Since we needed the cakes for each of our family's Thanksgiving meals, we were so grateful for the wonderful customer service! I can't say we always receive the same great service from the wait staff when we eat inside the restaurant, but the customer service at the bakery here is always amazing. Each time we've ordered from the bakery, Sonya has helped us. She is always really friendly and even remembers our names. Now that's great service! We've also received wonderful service at curbside when we've ordered food to go. The convenience of having curbside is wonderful for those parents who have kids asleep in the backseat and want food to go. I also love the fact that everyone who brings the food to us is really friendly and helpful. I really like Cheesecake Factory's consistently good food and amazing cheesecake, but I like their super customer service even more! I also can't wait to go back to get more of the Dulce de Leche cheesecake really soon!"
M T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/14/2016,"I usually hate coming to this restaurant but always end up here because my parents love their jambalaya. The wait for the food never fails to be obnoxiously long. The food is so-so in my opinion, hardly worth the at least 40 minute wait for it to reach the table."
Ramy A.,"Cypress, CA",11,48,1,4.0,2/10/2015,Was there on last Saturday night... And by the far the best cappuccino I have drank anywhere... To management please find out who made cappuccinos on Saturday night and the individual should be in charge of the bistro.. Making a cappuccino like that is an art. I will look forward to trying more of the different coffee drinks Cheesecake Factory has to offer...thanks to whoever made that cappuccino :)
Kisha B.,"Bellflower, CA",12,45,41,5.0,6/16/2014,"Me and the fam took Dad here Saturday for Father's Day. This place is FABULOUS!!! Our server's name was Justin, and he was WONDERFUL and we tipped him, as such, to show how we appreciated it!!! We were seated out on the patio because it was the first available opening for our group. At first I was giving MUCH side-eye (because I DO NOT do bugs, lol) but the weather was perfect, and there weren't that many bugs, and the scenery was perfect. The food was BEYOND delicious, the drinks were GREAT, the desserts were Heaven sent! This place is AWESOME, and very much recommended!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!"
Mary V.,"Chino Hills, CA",11,97,22,3.0,4/5/2016,"My friends and I came here for Sunday brunch. We asked for a table for 5 and they sat us at a table for 4 and just put a seat and the end of one of the tables. Then they gave us plates and utensils for only 4 people. Really? Our waitress took a long time to come take our drink order (we ordered mimosas which were delicious and came with a strawberry on top) by the time we got our drinks we were ready to order but our waitress was no where to be found. We finally stopped the person who brought us water to take our order. Right when she was gonna take it, our waitress came. Our food also took a long time to come but I guess that's usual. The food was delicious and the lunch special is awesome! 3 stars for the food but service was terrible and just took extremely log for everything. our waitress needs to ask for help or not take so many tables on a busy day."
Johanna R.,"Rowland Heights, CA",15,9,8,4.0,5/21/2016,Usually We come here for sure we Order Miso Salmon my Fave!!! & Pasta. I really love their Bread&butter also!!! Service is Good!!!  Been go to place since close to the Mall!!!
Vanessa M.,"Orange, CA",89,1,,2.0,8/10/2016,My Bf and I love coming to The Cheesecake Factory but tonight was just disappointing. We both ordered the baja chicken tacos. I usually ask for it without any pico de gallo. So when we received our order it had everything in it but barely any pieces of chicken?! I thought we were being Punk'd. We both laughed at the situation and called the server over and he took our plates back to the kitchen. The Manager came to our table to apologize and offered free soup or salad. We accepted the offer but it still didn't change the fact that we were hungry and had to wait once again for our food to be properly made with chicken. How does one mess that up?! 15 mins later we receieved our food on the same plate with  the  same side dish of black beans and cilantro rice. You would think for sanitary purposes that Everything would have come out Fresh! It sucks that more wasn't done to alleviate the situation at hand. I'm never one to complain but being an avid customer at this facility it's kind of hard not to. It's hit or miss at this location and thats why I gave it 2 stars.
J T.,"Fullerton, CA",11,501,49,4.0,3/21/2016,"We have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. This location is decent with plenty of parking within the Brea Mall. The wait is always long since this place is always packed. Don't go for lunch on Sunday because the crowd after-church is ridiculous. Service is always above-par. The Thai Lettuce Wrap is amazing. I order this item every time. Of course, the dessert is great but $10.00 per slice is a little steep. We love the Mint Chip Cheesecake and Pumpkin Cheesecake whenever they are in season."
Julie K.,"Corona, CA",121,166,18,5.0,5/29/2015,"Have paid countless visits here but first time rating. I absolutely enjoy my world favorite Tropical ice tea and never fail to order. I knew what I wanted to order, so we wasted no time by placing an order when the drinks were being served. The delivery of food was faster than usual. The waitress was quick and friendly as well as those who helped deliver food. My friend and I ordered Kale-Quinoa Salad, Thai chicken wrap, Red Velvet cheesecake, and two Tropical Ice Tea. My friend had never tried any of these items although have been to this chain restaurant many a times. She loved them all! We'll be back for more!"
Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",460,304,1025,4.0,12/18/2013,"I will never say no to eating at Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if this is a chain restaurant; Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Their menu is so big, it could feed everyone of any preference. Except maybe vegans.... but they're probably used to that. My favorite item to get at Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is the chicken bellagio. It is one of the cheaper specialty items on the menu at around $15. It is a HUGE portion too. Everyone on the menu is a big portion but trust me when I say you'll have enough to take home to feed you for dinner and make you full. It's two big pieces of breaded chicken breast on top of a California king sized bed on pasta (don't know what the sauce is, I forgot) and topped with an arugula salad. It is so good. I literally get this every time I've gone here for the past 5+ years and I haven't gotten sick of eating it. My cheesecake recommendations are the red velvet cheesecake and their anniversary cheesecake. I can't remember exactly what the anniversary one is called, but I know it's in the menu and described something along the lines of their cheesecake to celebrate their many years of success as a restaurant. Look out for it on the menu because it is chocolate cheesecakey goodness. The red velvet cheesecake is bomb diggz. Just trust. Of course Cheesecake Factory is nada without their addicting bread. I personally like the wheat bread most because when paired with butter, it tastes slightly sweet and its so good. It doesn't taste anything like any other wheat breads I've had before. I thought it was like molasses bread or something intricate for the longest time ... but no its just wheat. Their sourdough bread is good too. Best when served piping hot out of the kitchen with loads-a-butta! ""Keep the bread comin'"" is my motto. The service at this location is usually very good, unless they're extremely busy, like it was yesterday when I went. it was lunch time and it's near the holidays ... the place was packed, even to the patio. The waiters had so much to do for so many tables and the kitchen was getting backed up with all the orders. I noticed they had a bunch of large parties too. My waiter this particular visit was very MIA and our food took a whopping total of 40 minutes to come out. The manager came out to apologize to us for the long wait because there were so many large parties, but still. 40 minutes?! Insanity. The food was good nonetheless. Luckily I had no time constraint, otherwise I would've been royally pissed.  I love getting cheesecake for parties and birthdays at their little bakery section. They have all the cheesecakes on the menu for purchase, frozen and ready to thaw in a couple hours. I DO NOT, however, recommend purchasing their customized chocolate plate where they write ""Happy Birthday ____"" on it for you with chocolate because they totally messed up mine. This was supposed to be a nice presentable cake and I feel like the woman that wrote on the plate played around with it and made it look awful. Not to mention, it's pretty pricey to get that plate too."
Saree C.,"Long Beach, CA",89,185,214,4.0,3/27/2014,"People have been telling to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a long time.  For some reason I was craving cheesecake and was overwhelmed with school so with a couple of friends, I got cheesecake to go. Tiramisu: Delicious! Probably my favorite! It isn't as rich, so I ate this a lot faster than the others. Tuxedo: Delicious! Friend-recommended.   Chocolate Raspberry: RICH. Tastes good, BUT I could only have 1 spoon. Kahlua: RICH x 2. If I thought the Chocolate Raspberry was rich, this just surpassed it. Seriously, I could eat 1 spoon at each meal and probably have a single slice last me 3 days.  I still can't believe we spent about $34 on sugar. ANYWAY I think I liked the ones that were less rich simply because I could eat more of it (yes, I'm a glutton).  But I think the rich slices would go a long way if you just order one instead of 4.   I hope to come back and try the other cheesecakes!"
