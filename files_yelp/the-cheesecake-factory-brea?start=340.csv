Samantha G.,"Fullerton, CA",1,71,13,5.0,1/11/2015,"Delicious pasta and of course, the cheesecake. My last visit, I had a pot pie and it was amazing. I took my servers recommendation and she didn't let me down. Tasty and savory especially on a colder night. I loved the veggies. I will get this again and again.  I love cheesecake, so it is hard to go wrong.  You can tell most, if not all, of these cheesecakes are frozen then thawed to serve. This last time I got the chocolate cheesecake,  it was delicious.  I have had the Oreo cookie cheesecake,  cookie dough,  blueberry, lemon,  and I love them all.  (If you don't get the cheesecake then why did you come here. Everyone comes here for cheesecake.) Great service, fast food,  great suggestions, and a well trained staff make for a memorable dining experience with exceptional service. Thank you for a delightful meal."
James T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1510,585,1443,3.0,3/27/2014,"Came here for dinner with some friends, and as with every Cheesecake Factory, this Factory in particular seemed even darker (ambience?) than the norm. But onto the 'deets'! Service: Waitress was super awesome, even if she didn't laugh at my lame-o jokes.. (at least I admit they're lame!) She was constantly dropping by to check on us, despite the fact they were swamped with customers. All of my friends had a different dish and if I could see what they ordered, I'd describe it to you - too bad I couldn't! Food: We stuffed ourselves silly with wheat bread portions (the brown ones) and man, were they good.. as for the main dish, I ordered a salmon and steak combo ($19.95, no S&H.. ba dum dum..? No? I tried) and it came out pretty good. It was comprised with the salmon (and asparagus) on the left side of the plate, along with a vinegary type sauce underneath the fish. The steak (fillet portions, so they were already cut and rather small) adorned the right side of my plate, and were laid with mushrooms and onions. The two were separated by a line of mashed potatoes straight down the middle. The portion was rather small, and after I finished it, I craved more food. Much sad. Overall, I think the company I was with carried the night, as the rest of the experience was good but not amazing for me. Thanks though, awesome waitress lady! :D"
Sandy N.,"Anaheim, CA",22,77,60,2.0,7/4/2015,"We ordered the calamari, shrimp and chicken jambalaya, and fresh strawberry cheesecake.  The food were okay.  However,  the utensils were dirty and we needed to ask for replacement. The water glass they gave me also have left over food stuck to it. We also found a dead bug on the cilantro leafs for the calamari dish decoration.  3 stars for food and service but 1 star for cleanliness."
David L.,"Dublin, CA",145,185,,4.0,12/3/2015,"I guess not many people come to Cheesecake Factory on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, because the place was rather empty when we went at 10:30 PM. The salted caramel cheesecake was to die for; and combined with the usual great service, made this place the perfect spot for late night conversation. Probably won't be back in the area late at night, but if I am, this place is on the list."
Jenn A.,"Whittier, CA",82,15,1,5.0,12/29/2015,Been here multiple times & the food never disappoints. Great food & amazing cheesecake! Love the chicken piccata.
James S.,"Fullerton, CA",10,38,70,4.0,12/26/2015,Cheesecake factory is always consistent with their food and service. A good end to the shopping in the Brea mall the day after Christmas.
Brielle R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,1,5.0,11/15/2016,"This was my second time visiting Cheesecake Factory. I will admit that the only reason that I visited the first time was because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Since I was impressed with my visit the first time, I decided to come back with a friend. The bread is one of my favorite things. For appetizer I got the avocado eggrolls, which were just as equally appetizing. The waitress was very pleasant and helpful. For my main dish I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. The pasta was very tender and the sauce was delicious and creamy. The menu is very big and can be overwhelming, but taking the extra 5 minutes to look over everything will be worth it! I am excited to see what I will be getting my next visit. Highly recommend!!"
Bill H.,"Lakewood, CA",5,37,10,5.0,9/16/2016,My wife and I have eaten there a couple of dozen times since my last review. She finally got the courage to order the gluten-free pasta again. It was excellent. Thank you for fixing the way the kitchen Cooks the noodles.
BettyLou H.,"Irvine, CA",160,180,8,3.0,10/8/2014,"Today, I was reminded of an odd way they do breakfast. My friend and I each had the egg breakfast. I had ham and she had bacon. The bacon plate was extremely hot (she was warned) and the bacon very hard and dry. So, we assume that, like the dried out potatoes, they made all this stuff early in the morning and re-heated it. Hmmm. Not really top quality.  Another aggravating thing they do is drop off the plates that contain dry toast or muffins and leave without furnishing butter. When the overworked waitress returns to ask if everything is OK, the toast is cold. How hard is it to just put extra butter on the plates, or, better yet, butter the toast/muffins in the kitchen? More like a real factory production line than a Cheesecake Factory."
Anissa T.,"Fayetteville, AR",173,211,684,1.0,11/11/2011,"If this is what the famous cheesecake factory has come down to, I guess I'm out.  We had a pretty lousy experience here on 10/18/11, and it all was about quality. The service was ok, but certainly not of the really friendly helpful variety, just more the do the minimum. Two of us ordered glasses of different Pinot Noirs - one was drinkable, but not good, the other was REALLY bad, and was sent back to the bar to be replaced. I blame myself for ordering an inexpensive Pinot on the not good one, but the other one should not even be carried. It's THAT bad. The waiter acted huffy about us sending back the one glass, didn't seem that interested in our opinions. I had a shrimp/white wine sauce sauteed pasta dish, and was really surprised to find the shrimp had a little bit of a coating on them, like a very light breading. Not expected or enjoyed in this type of dish. I didn't dare complain, though, as 2 of my co-workers ended up with Shrimp Scampi that had BREADED and FRIED shrimp with a little sauce and a pile of dry linguine on the plate. Absolutely the worst take on a simple dish ever.  Based on this experience, Cheesecake Factory is off my list unless I'm just going for drinks or dessert."
Jaxon T.,"Fullerton, CA",322,48,104,2.0,5/24/2016,"What are the chances of these douche bags in the front, making same mistake of skipping our party? This time, it wasn't the receptionist but the guy who receives the ticket and calls out the guests. I felt bad for the receptionist and I had to point out to her how come it's taking it was taking so long to get a patio table with so many open tables. Hmmm... At this joint, make sure you double check or else case they will skip you."
Ryan B.,"Santa Ana, CA",91,30,,1.0,11/2/2014,"I was home alone for the evening and decided I'd like one of Cheesecake Factory's tasty pastas! Little did I know it would be a nightmare of a dinner... I ordered it to-go and arrived at the Brea Mall location just before the estimated time. The young lady on the phone said they would call me when it was ready... Which was a lie! Not only did I wait 20 minutes without a call, I was even ignored after calling them! They answered the phone and transferred me, but nobody picked up... For 18 minutes.  I ended up going in and confusing the staff by asking for my to-go order. Sorry for the burden grabbing my cold food! After complaining through their site about the situation I was eventually contacted by who I assumed to be a manager at The Factory. She also lied by offering a full refund in the form of a gift card which I have yet to receive in the two months since this evening.  Don't expect me to return to this location ever again!"
Jody R.,"Placentia, CA",22,48,28,3.0,3/13/2016,"Great food- I had the Chicken  Madeira and it was fabulous.  Expect the place to be noisy, overcrowded, & overpriced.  If you don't mind that- it's worth the wait for the food & good service.  It's a nice place to be if you have a 2-3 hours in your schedule."
Brandon F.,"Buena Park, CA",105,17,12,5.0,12/12/2014,"I had a small intimate wedding ceremony yesterday in a beautiful park with only about 30 attendees. Afterwards, we came to The Cheesecake Factory. I knew a party of 30 would be difficult, and we weren't the only large party, even on a Thursday. But we came in, put our name in, and were seated in less than half an hour. I anticipated much longer, but we got beautiful patio seating under several heat lamps that fended off the cold preceding a forecasted storm coming the next day. The servers were extraordinary. My large group, though stressful, is always joking and smiling, and the two waitresses devoted to our two long sixteen-person tables immediately followed suit. They laughed and joked along with us, while serving us quickly and without a single mistake. I wish I could remember their names, but the only thing I can say is that my server looked like a short haired Rachel Bilson. Obviously I can't speak for all thirty people on the food specifically, but I'll speak for me. Part one: the lemonade. I wasn't feeling boozy so in my search for something virgin I saw the words ""house made"". Best lemonade I've ever had at a restaurant, with a sugar-rimmed glass to boot. Then, appetizers! Spinach artichoke dip. Fried calamari. Both delicious and addictive. Then came my shrimp scampi. I always get the shrimp scampi. Throw just a twist of lemon juice over the top and you're in garlicky shrimp heaven. And, of course, the cheesecake. My Rachel Bilson inspired waitress suggested the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OH MY LORD. Best ending to a meal I've had in a long time. I can honestly say that this place made my wedding night amazing. My family and friends left full, satisfied, and smiling."
Stephanie O.,"Anaheim, CA",273,113,77,5.0,1/4/2016,The food is always delicious here and the mood is always romantic. I love this place. Their Salmon dishes are amazing and so are their salads.
Anita L.,"Placentia, CA",252,12,18,3.0,8/7/2015,"My coworkers and I headed to the Cheesecake Factory after work on Saturday. The hostess gave the person behind us a buzzer first, but she apologized for the mistake afterwards. About 30 minutes later, we got a table outside. We ordered: - Fish Tacos: Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Crispy Tempura Fish, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Black Beans and Rice. $13.95 - Chicken Romano: Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce. $16.95 - Factory Burger: Charbroiled with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions on Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. $12.50 - Tomato Basil Pasta: Grilled Chicken, Fresh Mozzarella, a Touch of Garlic and Penne Pasta. Light and Fresh $14.50 When the waitress took our order, she had repeated it back correctly, but when our food came, it was not exactly as we ordered it. My coworker had ordered his tacos with avocados on the side and I had ordered my salad without dressing. They brought the avocados later but didn't get me a new salad, so I ate the salad with dressing. It was OK, but for the price I expected better.  For dessert, we ordered:  - Lemon meringue cheesecake: Lemon Cream Cheesecake Topped with Layers of Lemon Mousse and Meringue. 25 cents from every slice sold through 7/29/15 will be donated to Feeding America and the 2015 Special Olympics World Games (yay!). $7.95 - Chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake: Layers of Our Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate. $7.95 The lemon meringue cheesecake was fabulous. The chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake was very good, but it had more chocolate cake than cheesecake (One of my coworkers really likes chocolate cake, so it was OK). Overall, I felt the service was friendly but not very attentive. (As noted, they made several mistakes, but they were nice about them.) The wait was long, both for a table and for our orders. The menu has too many options. Prices are high for what you get. The regular food is OK. The cheesecake is fabulous; this is why we come to The Cheesecake Factory. I may just pick up a cheesecake next time, though."
Jacqueline G.,"San Diego, CA",220,348,35,3.0,2/20/2014,"I have no been here in years and only came because my friend and I had gift cards. Our actual server was nice but I don't understand why there is always a long wait at all hours of the day?! We waited one hour and finally got seated around 9:00PM ish. I think by then you really just want to punch out all your orders: drinks, appetizers and main entree since you waited an hour and they have the menu on display outside.  It's a nice location where you can find parking especially after the mall has closed. I did noticed some people who we were getting impatient with the valet taking a while looking for their cars. We ordered the avocado, portabello, zucchini fries which was small in portions but yummy. My friend ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I can't remember if she thought it would be in an actual pie form. It comes with a large dish and it looks like a mashed potato layer on top. I thought it was okay. It did have flavor and the meat reminded me of chunks of hamburger paddy but at least the gravy had some flavor. My friend loves Jambalaya so he has the past version of it. Big chunks of shrimp and he said it was okay. I went with trying to be healthy with the seared ahi tuna salad. Big chucks that were seared all around well but maybe like 8 pieces. Drink wise we just asked for ginger whisky and you do taste the Jack Daniels. Overall, it's a chill experience and we sat outside on the patio even though it was kinda chilly out. Heat lamps did their job or is it because we sat up against one? We went traditional on dessert and got the strawberry cheesecakes. The actual strawberries they top the slice with reminded us of the maraschino cherries. I definitely devoured the cheesecake."
Corbin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,1.0,6/11/2016,Garbage service. Waiter was horrible. Never communicated with us. Food took over half and hour to come out and food was already cold when it came out. Never coming to this cheesecake again. I recommend others to stay away as well.
Aria F.,"Royal Oak, MI",28,285,21,4.0,10/25/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has become a little bit of a hit or miss with the service recently. However, I like to make the most of my experience so I will not let the couple bad experiences with the service bring down the review too much.  If you are a big party, make sure you get here at least 45 minutes before you want to be seated on the weekends.  I have tried a lot of things on the menu but the Miso Salmon is by far my favorite along with Whiskey smash to wash it down. The menu is unbelievably long so it's gonna take at least 10 minutes to sift through the whole thing.  And last but not least is the whole purpose of going here...the cheesecake! There are so many to choose from, however I would recommend the dulce de leche if the pumpkin is not available."
Joseph V. L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Crossing this place off my list. Service is inconsistent, the seating you get will always be the cramped spot, and peak hour crowds amplify the crappiness.  It almost seems like this place is not well set up for capacity.  I will go to the one in Santa Anita from now on."
