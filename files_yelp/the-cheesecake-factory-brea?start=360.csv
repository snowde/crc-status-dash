Ron V.,"Placentia, CA",0,9,1,2.0,1/19/2016,"So my wife & I went out to for dinner at CF because we've always enjoyed the food. It was pretty busy (Sat eve 1-16-16) so we had to wait around 50 mins. That was fine, but when we were finally called for our table, they asked if ""heated patio"" would be alright. It was a cold evening but we said it was OK because of the heaters. We were led to a table for two on the edge of the patio but our heater was off. (Every other table's heaters were on) I asked if someone could turn it on, but that's when the waitress told us it was broken but we should be fine since the other heaters residual heat would be sufficient. Seeing that we were already seated and we waited for close to an hour, we reluctantly stayed. It was fine for about 15 minutes, but my wife was getting really cold to the point of being uncomfortable. We both had light jackets on but the ""residual heat"" wasn't cutting it. I got up and politely stated our dilemma to a waiter who told me to ask the manager. (who just arrived at the table with our meals) I told him my wife was very cold and uncomfortable without a working heater, but all he said was ""Can I bring you some hot water?"" I didn't know how to respond to that, so I said NO and off he went.  Now i am not one to leave a negative review, especially when the food was delicious and our waitress was prompt and friendly, but I was taken back by the ""hot water"" comment. At least he could have offered us some hot coffee or tea, maybe a dessert & coffee or something to at least make us feel like you are trying to rectify the situation, but ""hot water""?  What were we supposed to do with hot water, soak our hands in it to warm up? So very odd...  Anyway, it was a disappointing end to what should have been an enjoyable night out."
Celena R.,"Wildomar, CA",105,5,1,4.0,1/25/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for our one year anniversary. We went on a Saturday and the place was packed. We waited 40 minutes for a table and it was smooth sailing from there.  We were worried that our food would take a while so we decided to order right when the waitress came.... Our food came in 7 minutes (yes I timed it) It was unbelievable. Everything was delicious, definitely worth the wait, and at the end we got a nice little anniversary surprise (: Love this place, we'll always come back!"
Ak D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,16,1,2.0,7/7/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory but this one is not my favorite. They will ask you to wait for 5 minutes and finally take you a table after 20 minutes of wait! Initially, i thought this was an one- off incident but later it became a pattern. Food is great...service is so-so."
Kerri D.,"Upland, CA",174,150,16,4.0,12/16/2015,Stopped on our way home from shopping at Disneyland. This is our usual go to place after Disneyland as the service and food are always super!  I was a little sad I couldn't get the pineapple upside down cheesecake but I understand!
Paul A.,"La Puente, CA",389,13,34,4.0,3/25/2015,"Great area, great food, great service and GREAT CHEESECAKES! Four stars just because it can get extremely busy."
Vanessa H.,"Pomona, CA",8,6,,5.0,3/26/2016,This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and I was very impressed. I came for my birthday dinner and everything was perfect. They have a wide variety of food suitable for almost everyone. The food was good and the service was spectacular! Our server Martina (I'm sorry if I got that wrong) was great! She was genuinely nice and made sure everything came out right.
Dee W.,"Paramount, CA",227,368,146,4.0,1/28/2014,"Great service! Very clean! The wait for a Saturday night was not bad at all.....our Waiter was wonderful! Very nice, patient & informative. This was my 1st time to this location & I really enjoyed it versus Pasadena or Los Angeles. We will be back........in a bit."
Debbie A.,"Placentia, CA",206,11,3,1.0,10/30/2016,"Nothing like serving vegan meals and someone puts a piece of feta cheese in the Vegan Cobb salad.  Very suspicious if you ask me  I stopped eating from the nursing secretions of a mammal when I was a baby. Diary is full of puss and blood.  I will let everyone of my vegan friends not to trust this restaurant.  Veganism isn't a diet, it's an ethical stance against the suffering and death of animals.  FU"
Jessica W.,"Brea, CA",14,28,30,4.0,11/24/2014,Good sized portions and food taste  HOWEVER  the service is killing me  Seriously  30 minutes to get the God damn check  It's not even that busy the waiters are too busy talking to eachother to do their job
Sydney G.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",88,1,,1.0,6/23/2016,"Worst Experience ever! I am not one who ever takes to the Internet to complain or rate restaurants but after my experience last night I just had to. First off Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.... I often visit this location as well as Woodland Hills, Newport Beach and Arcadia.  But last nights Service was horrible... management was a joke and on top of that RUDE! When they finally brought our food out my dish was over cooked and not edible. I nicely let the server know and she asked me if I wanted something different. I then looked at the menu and asked for a different dish that I was hoping would at least he edible. 25 min. Later while everyone had finished eating and all plates were cleared I was still sitting there waiting for my dish. I then asked if they could just put the dish in the to go box when it was finally ready. After they brought the dessert my dish was finally ready... a total of 35 min after I had sent my original dish back. Then when we got the bill they charges me for the dish that first was not edible then was brought out as we were ready to go! I then told the manager he could take the food back and to take it off the bill... and he did. I'm not one who complains for free food but I mean come on... you mess up... you should compensate for your mistakes. Not even a sorry was said... just attitude given from the managers side. I'm in shock by the establishment!"
Van N.,"Cape Girardeau, MO",96,4,4,1.0,11/30/2015,I went in at 8:00 and it was not that busy and the girls up front skipped us. We waited for 30 minutes. The couple that came in after us got sit 5 minutes after they got to the restaurant. Pathetic.
Nidia N.,"La Habra, CA",2,52,52,4.0,11/13/2015,"a slice of cheescake runs about $8-9 per slice, but very well worth it. ordered a slice to go; & it was very neatly packaged. Great presentation, great taste, never fails. Open late for those late night cravings."
Risha C.,"Corona, CA",64,36,66,5.0,8/4/2013,"2nd Review: Location: Love the area, right by the mall and beautifully placed with great patio decor and lighting as well as the interior Food: As always, the food is ordered and served in a timely matter.

Adrian P.,"Whittier, CA",1,6,,4.0,4/17/2016,"The food was awesome, friendly and funny waiter too. The cheesecake was HEAVENLY. I love it! Just the wait time sometimes is bad which is understandable due to popularity."
Lawrence T.,"West Covina, CA",20,38,,5.0,8/5/2015,"Went here on a Saturday afternoon and it was full capacity. Our party had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. I had the Louisiana chicken and pasta. A favorite of mine to have everytime I come here. It's tasty, saucy, and zesty. I don't know what else they have on the menu, but they are probably just as good as my dish was. Nice cocktail drinks. Try the Moscow mule, $12 and try the apple martini $? Both very good."
Erin K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",49,288,190,4.0,5/26/2013,"I got the Vegetable Salad without the cheese from the Skinnilicious menu (haha). It actually really yummy. Portions were generous and ingredients in my salad were FRESH.  The waitress was knowledgable about the ingredients in the dishes and when she was unsure, she made the extra effort to double check with someone. She also was very responsive and kept the sodas coming, and was super friendly! wish there were more gf options, though!!"
Michael M.,"Whittier, CA",102,7,1,5.0,6/11/2015,"Stopped in last night and wasn't disappointed. I myself had the chicken enchiladas and my girlfriend had the chipotle chicken pasta. Both were delicious! As far as the enchiladas go I'd rather have these than some of the Mexican restaurants I go to. Perfect amount of sauce, for once a place who doesn't drown the enchiladas in sauce, chicken was moist and perfectly cooked plus the side of beans and rice tasted great. In regards to the chipotle chicken pasta that is great also. I could be bias due to the fact of I love chipotle sauce or anything of that sort but the combination of creamy Alfredo but with a little kick from the chipotle sauce makes it a must have everytime you visit. Only cons I have on this location is the seating. I understand it does get busy but where we had been seated the tables were so close together we were practically sitting with the other tables and conversation between the both of us was almost impossible. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat. Giant menu and great atmosphere, with drinks expect about a $35+ bill but it is well worth it. As a tip to avoid the cramped seating just ask for the patio. -Michael"
Raymond L.,Hong Kong,34,172,1251,4.0,12/26/2014,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory that I visit when ever I'm in town. The food is good and the service can vary, pending on server."
Amin M.,"Covina, CA",54,138,181,5.0,1/25/2015,"Sunday dinner!! Wait was a bit long, but it was well worth it, the rib eye medium well was great with a side of Asparagus was all I needed it. The chicken wings are also really good."
Mallery O.,"San Diego, CA",738,93,1025,4.0,12/23/2014,Love the free bread! I usually get the chicken madera or one of the pastas (especially the garlic noodles) and an appetizer to share.
