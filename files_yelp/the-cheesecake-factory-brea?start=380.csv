Michelle R.,"Dallas, TX",60,6,4,5.0,7/2/2015,Everything I've ever ordered here has been delicious. I love the white chicken chili because it's not too spicy and they also have good parmesan chicken. My favorite cheesecakes are the chocolate mousse and Chris's outrageous cheesecake (if you like chocolate and coconut it's a MUST). The service is good too but it gets packed on weekends and around dinner time.
Lynn S.,"Anaheim, CA",38,123,57,5.0,9/17/2015,Came here for lunch and had a great experience with our server Katrina k. If you come here ask for her ! She is so kind and friendly and made our lunch very pleasurable ! She's knows her wines and makes a killer iced coffee! Hopefully corporate reads this and compliments her work ethic because we will definitely come back and ask to be seated in Katrinas area!
Wendy T.,"La Habra, CA",0,14,2,1.0,6/24/2016,They changed their Oreo cheesecake recipe   Horrible!  Waste of 60 bucks!  We were all so disappointed.  They should call it Tuxedo black and white cake with 3 chocolate wafers in the middle
Allie B.,"Fullerton, CA",8,78,34,5.0,2/27/2015,My family and I frequent this location and always leave pleased. We have yet to have poor service. Love the complimentary bread. Chicken Madera is exceptional and the Fresh Basil Tomato Flatbread on the Skinnilicious menu is great if you're watching your calories. We just love this place!
Vega P.,"Orange, CA",214,39,42,5.0,1/10/2015,"Chicken Bellagio & Cajun Jambalaya pastas are my favorite! Also, they have the best happy hour! :)"
Gary W.,"Brea, CA",1837,140,696,4.0,1/8/2014,"This place has great decor, food & service with reasonable price. I think it probably has the best service among all the chain restaurants. No wonder this place is always packed, especially on weekends. I'm not really a desert person, but I love the cheesecake here. Godiva, Hersey, Ore are among my favorites. This is a great place to host business or birthday parties and it won't break your bank."
Mariella C.,"Anaheim, CA",5,30,7,5.0,3/17/2016,Want to thank Genevieve today for serving us she was very attentive great customer service skills the food was delicious we went for a special occasion which was a pleasure to have it at such a wonderful place thank u and the cheesecake yummie
Sultaraco B.,"San Gabriel, CA",8,165,66,1.0,1/31/2016,"This place sucks bad,was on hold for 8 minutes to place take-out order,then was told 35-40 minutes to pickup,place is full up the ying-yang,waiting another 10 minutes,never ordering again here."
Collene A.,"Fullerton, CA",26,25,3,3.0,8/29/2016,We usually have good food and service at this Cheesecake Factory except for this past meal. We showed up and we had to wait for our drink service. Then we waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and take our food order. It took 30 min for the food to come out and we were left completely alone with no one asking if we wanted or needed anything else. My daughter ordered a steak medium rare and it came extremely rare. Almost steak tar tar. The spinach she ordered with her meal was barely cooked and had no seasoning. My husband ordered roaster beets and we could not tell if it was roasted or how it was cooked because it was served ice cold. My white bean chicken chili was like warm. Not a good memorable meal.
Meilani L.,"Fullerton, CA",353,7,,2.0,1/30/2016,"We had a reservation for 8pm but a few of us were there since 7:30. It was past 8 and we were asking the hostesses when we were going to get seated and they kept saying ""about 15-20 minutes..."" After several minutes had passed, we asked the servers why our table was taking so long and then they said ""they're waiting for the people to pay the bill."" Finally at about 9:30 (over an hour after our reservation) we were finally seated. I understand that we were a party of 12 but that's why we made a reservation and it's still a huge restaurant which should groups of all sizes."
Acquired Taste N.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,57,1,1.0,2/23/2017,"Unbelievable!!!! And I don't mean this in a good way either! So we came here to celebrate a co-workers Birthday lunch with a group of about 14 people. So I thought that they would be more accommodating and customer friendly. But we got the worst waitress with the most anti-customer attitude. From the minute she addressed us you could tell she was not happy to be assigned a large group. I wanted to order a lunch sized portion of their Chicken Marsala but before I even I finish my request, she cuts me off and says ""Sorry, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!"" Then I  asked to see the manager who wasn't any additional help. The manager blamed her Corporate Office saying I can't offer that as an option. I asked her, ""I thought the motto for Cheesecake Factory was solving and helping meet customer requests at the time of the visit?"" She emphatically responded with a big ""NOPE! Corporate won't allow me!"". The Cheesecake Factory isn't what it used to be and it's disappointing! They used to have a can do attitude but now they just raise their prices without aiming to please their customers. What a shame! I hope CORPORATE IS READING THIS REVIEW."
Priscilla P.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,721,1,2.0,12/29/2015,"10 years ago, cheesecake factory was a solid chain restaurant to go for a good meal. but nowadays, i think otherwise.  i recently visited and started with glass of water. there was something floating in it before i took a sip and i informed the waiter. she brought me a new glass of water. thinking the water was fine, i drank from the water, only to find a dead FLY in my glass. naturally, i informed the waiter and she told me ""oh it's ok, you'll be fine"" WTF?? that's disgusting lady!! and speaks volumes about the restaurant's poor sanitary conditions.  as for the food, it's subpar and underwhelming. i don't think i'll return for the food anytime soon."
Yianni K.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,21,30,2.0,8/18/2014,"Two stars because I always enjoy their margaritas and cheesecakes... But, this particular location has disappointed me the last two times I came here.. Came in on a weeknight, not too busy, we get seated immediately only to realize that our table was still dirty. Of course the hostess didn't notice so once we sat down I put my elbows on the table and realized something sticky was on there... I look over and there's a folded used towel and some rice still there... I ask for them to clean it and they cleaned that spot only! Open the menu - menu is dirty...  Waitress was awesome but had way too many tables... They seated her 4 tables one after the other... This brings us to today. Blonde guy as a host, not very friendly and asks us to wait 40 minutes for the patio even though the place is slow... Finally 30 minutes later we get seated and yes, there were only two other parties out there so what was the hold up? Anyway... What really drove me crazy was the other host who simply threw the menus on the table... Of course, no side plates on the table either! Oh and two dirty tables that were not picked up until 10-15 minutes after we were seated...  Waitress was good once again!  Basically, I love Cheesecake Factory as a brand, but this location needs some work on Hostessing and Bussing!  Excellent ultimate margarita though!  (Sidenote for the hosts, when you join 2 tables, don't put someone to sit right on the joint, uneven patio tables, where is the plate supposed to go? Wobble or at an incline?)"
Marissa W.,"Cambridge, MA",0,100,5,1.0,7/30/2015,"Came here for national cheesecake day, and I must say this is not only the worst Cheesecake Factory ever but also probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had for a very long time.  There was no organization, lines were all over the place, blocking the waiters' access to the cheesecake kitchen, waiters were bumping into other waiters, people were confused. It was a hot mess.  It was crowded of course, but we stood in the to-go cheesecake line. As we were in line, we heard a waitress say to another waitress, ""Such animals! It's only cheesecake!"" She then yelled at another customer (who was inadvertently in her way), ""DONT stand there!"" We figured it was a grumpy lady having a bad day and continued standing in line browsing a menu.  When the line didn't move for a good 15 minutes, we decided to check out the situation. Turns out we were in the pickup spot and the order line was on the other side. I'd say about 15 waiters passed us while we were in line. Nobody had the sense to tell us we were in the wrong line. When we finally got to order, there was more attitude from the cashier. And then we were told we'd have to wait 30-40 minutes for our cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory, you have declined so excruciatingly low since I last visited you a few years ago. :(((( service is so embarrassingly bad. Stop hiring angry people. And when you have promotional days, please have someone come to bring order to the chaos and control us ""animals"" LMAO.  *growl*"
Ali E.,"Irvine, CA",21,70,21,5.0,1/13/2016,"This was our first time at this location. The service was a little slow at lunch, even though it was not very busy. All the items were fresh and delicious. Their lunch specials are limited and it's a bit on the pricey side, but you do get bread and butter with every order."
Nina K.,"La Habra, CA",105,64,8,5.0,1/12/2016,"I give this location five stars because our server was super patient, even though our party was full of rowdy Asians who are not the best at English. She was really nice and did not condescendingly correct our pronunciation of certain words. The food is always just okay, but the cheesecakes by themselves warrant five stars. The Godiva cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake are always my favorites."
Toomuch B.,"West Covina, CA",28,38,6,1.0,11/7/2015,"This is the worst place ever, I stood there waiting to be seated and whilst everyone else, even people who came in behind me were seated I was still stood there 10 minutes later. I even asked the seater there and he ignored me and seated the people behind me.   Its like I was invisible, i will never go to another cheesecake factory ever again.  They are downright rude and ignorant."
Chris L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/30/2016,"I went here for a family birthday, and everyone was dissatisfied with their meal. My mother and I found strange crumbs in our drinks, and it took the waitress 3 times to fix it! It took longer to get our food than the people next to us, who got here 15 minutes after we did. My mother also ordered a well-done burger with onion strings in it. The first time, the cooks forgot the onion strings; the second time, the cooks made it a medium grill. My mom didn't want to eat anymore because she lost her appetite. My pepperoni pizza wasn't as good as usual because it was burnt, and a couple of the slices were soggy. I could barely finish half. The manager took the cost of the burger and the appetizer off, but it was still expensive for 3 meals. I don't think we will be coming back to this location."
Jessica L.,"Rosemead, CA",850,252,376,4.0,1/5/2013,"Come during lunch time because you'd be paying a lot less and you get just as much! I'm all about the good food, but ending with a fat wallet as well (: Get the sundried tomato chicken pasta because it's noodles are tender and the sauce is so creamy and delicious! You get a lot for what you pay for. You can also eat it with the warm, oven baked soft bread that they give you and smother it with some better to make it even more indulgent (: If you love seafood then definitely get the Herb crusted salmon! it was so fresh and the spears of asparagus that they give you are jumbo sized! but i'd advise to to the lemon cream sauce on the side as it made the dish taste a little funny.  I've always had a pleasant experience with cheesecake factory because the way they compensate their customers when they're lagging is amazing! Last time i was in a rush to get to a movie and i put in a rush order, but it took so long for my pizza to come that i had to request it to go. Turns out that they had burnt my pizza and was in the process of making a new one, so the manager came by and gave me a free slice of cheesecake of my choice for dessert and the waitress to show her apologies gave me and my two friends free sodas to go on the house!  Then second time was when the kitchen was lagging on the food so it took a while before my dish came so the manager came over and compensated me with a free slice of cheesecake! I love freee food so i give them props for handling the situation so well! Get the TIRAMISU cheesecake its soooo decadent! The taste of tiramisu and the silky texture of cheesecake all in one bite. It's definitely a match made in heaven!"
Sherrie F.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,72,86,5.0,11/23/2013,"Haven't been to this Cheesecake Factory since I moved out of state.  We came for my moms birthday to have lunch.  My favorite is the shepherds pie and their meatloaf.  I usually get one or the other when we come. There's always a wait, but if the weather is nice like today then we usually sit outside on the patio and that's hardly ever a wait.  The service is prompt too.   We also used to see Omarion and Snoop Dogg at this location, but that was years ago."
