Santiago G.,"Anaheim, CA",74,21,2,5.0,12/8/2017,I just want to mention Emily T. On my recent trip to Cheesecake I had the pleasure to be served by Emily and she really stood out. She was all about the positive attitude and great service. The food was great like always and of course dessert! Thank you for another awesome experience at Cheesecake!
Melanie M.,"Anaheim, CA",116,59,23,5.0,9/13/2017,"Their chicken bellagio doesn't disappoint. It's so good. I haven't had a bad experience here. Their cheesecakes are delicious, too. My favorite is the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. I definitely recommend those two if you don't care about eating too much carbs haha"
Kellie P.,"Walnut, CA",15,25,25,3.0,10/8/2017,"I have dined here way many times so far but this last time was super disappointing because of the dinner portions were not good enough plus the ingredients were so ridiculously skimpy. I ordered pasta Alfredo sauce with chicken for my kid adult size and the whole dish was dry and only about 5-6 small pieces of dry and hard chicken and it costs $20.95, seriously???? I was so so disappointed that I don't think I'll be back for a long while, at least until I could forget this bad dining experience. It sucks that Cheesecake Factory was always my favorite restaurant but looks like not anymore!"
Mark O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",106,178,850,4.0,3/25/2017,"Meal choices abound at all Cheesecake Factory locations. Wait times at Brea Mall, CA can be unexpected and long. 50-55 mins on Saturdays is typical. Food is pretty good but not spectacular. Cheesecake Factory prices are very affordable. I award 4.0 stars The atmosphere and decor is approaching elegant with nice accents on the walls Living is Southern California affords the luxury of waiting for a table outside even in Winter Outdoor seating is nice even in March. The Cheesecake Factory has space heaters  - bring a sweater. Bon appétit"
Johnny M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/15/2017,"I really like cheesecake factory but something is going on with this location and i'm starting to doubt if they love me back.  I usually order from doordash and I have noticed that the portion sizes of my dishes, especially, pasta dishes is all over the place and sometimes I feel like my dishes are half the size that they are other nights.  My go-to dishes are Louisiana chicken pasta, and chicken pot stickers and occasionally bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Every dish tastes great, but it's the consistency in portion size that really makes me give this location only four stars instead of five."
Janice B.,"Carson, CA",0,17,6,5.0,12/7/2017,"Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory, I always order the Chicken Marsala. This is my all-time favorite and even though there are many choices, I always find myself getting the same thing. The atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful with the waterfront."
Em S.,"Brea, CA",1,12,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Usually my experiences at this restaurant have been positive however this evening, not so much. I placed a curbside order and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I arrived at the 20 minute mark, called and waited. After 8 minutes someone came out, collected my payment, and shared the food would be right out. 20 minutes later I exited my car and went inside to see where my card and food was. With 6 people working behind the counter you'd think I'd be helped in a timely fashion, unfortunately this was not the case. After an additional 5 minutes someone was finally able to assist. She scrambled around and found a portion of my order sitting on the counter(I'm assuming they'd been there for quite some time as the food was cold) Someone else brought the cheesecakes. Luckily my order was correct though the food cold."
Steph M.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,13,9,5.0,8/14/2017,"Went in Saturday evening for a birthday dinner with my sister. It was pretty busy and yet Chris our server was amazing!! He was on it with refills, asking how things were etc... beyond courteous!"
James K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",61,66,88,4.0,5/31/2017,"Food was amazing.  Their service was great.  We really enjoyed our waitress because she was friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic.  It had been a long day and it was just what we needed to unwind.  I was really impressed with their steak. When I go back home, I got cheese cake. It was good. However, I am giving them 4 stars because waiting time was really really long.  Food : 5/5 Atmosphere : 4/5 Service : 5/5 Waiting time : 1/5"
Erica P.,"Cerritos, CA",7,147,361,4.0,8/31/2017,"We came by for their cheesecake special: Half off cheesecake. There was a crowd and it took a while to get a seat. Ordered several appetizers and entrees. I think the menu is too complicated. It would be better if they simplified it a bit more. My favorite was the fired max n cheese balls. Absolutely delicious and worth the carbs. For my entree, I got the four cheese pasta. This is my favorite. Nice, tart marinara sauce with cool, creamy cheese. The pepper was el dente and sauce was delicious. Ordered it with chicken for some protein. For my cheesecake, I ordered the tiramisu. I love their tiramisu cheesecake. Not too sweet and it taste like tiramisu. However, the surprise of the evening was the birthday celebration cake. I did not expect to like the new cheesecake so much. It was really good. Several layers that somehow worked. I found it too sweet, but enjoyable. It was worth it."
Katie W.,"Walnut, CA",42,56,59,4.0,5/26/2017,"THE SERVICE: I had lunch with a friend. We came in at 3 pm on a Friday. The place was pretty busy but we got seated right away and the service was good. They were prompt about getting us bread, drinks, refills and bringing us the check. THE FOOD: I ordered their almond crusted salmon kale salad. The salad was nicely dressed and the dressing itself paired nicely with the salad. However, I thought it was a rather small meal and left me just not hungry but definitely not full. I also thought they could have given more avocado as well."
Steven T.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,4,2,5.0,12/9/2017,"""You get what you pay for."" Came here with my family and was not disappointed.  The food was a little slow coming out but was very delicious! We had the mushroom burger,  Chipotle chicken burger,  antioxidant salad, shrimp&sausage pasta, and I had the Shepard's pie. They offer smaller portions of most of what you order I believe. They had a mix up with one of our orders but offered some side dishes while they remake our food. Overall,  job well done Cheesecake Factory! !"
Noemi F.,"Whittier, CA",15,8,3,5.0,8/25/2017,"We celebrated my husband's birthday there yesterday. The food and service were amazing. This restaurant was not our intended destination, as my husband had chosen nearby BJ's Restaurant, but we ended up walking out of that place before our food arrived because of the terrible service we received. My husband was very upset and just wanted to go back home. Cheesecake Factory was just across the way, but it was dinner and the restaurant looked busy, so his concern was that it was a school night for our kids and the wait would probably be long. After some convincing we walked over and indeed very busy--long wait. But since we dine there often, I recognized the Restaurant Manager and pulled her aside explained the situation and asked if there was anything she could do to help. She was so warm and receptive. She checked the floor and had us seated in less than 5 minutes. She saved the day! The Birthday Celebration back on track.  Our server Jaime was AMAZING!!! She took such great care of us and checked in often. The food was delicious and the drinks as well. You have a customer for life!"
Michela P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,134,116,1.0,2/28/2017,"this place is a disgrace of a restaurant. I order the eggplant parmesan and the pork chop. the eggplant was cooked good seasoned good, but the pasta was so dry I literally almost choked trying to eat it.  the pork chop was over cooked and dry. service was good."
Jean B.,"Oceanside, CA",7,11,3,4.0,9/17/2017,"I went there Saturday night. I am glad it was not a long wait, if you're willing to seat on the patio.  I am glad I picked Shrimp Scampi it was delicious.  My husband has Tacos and my daughter has chicken pasta. All good.  Parking was hard for disabled, it easily filled up. Go there early."
Diana N.,"West Covina, CA",82,39,39,5.0,7/27/2017,"I have been craving cheesecake factory for the past year. So I woke up this morning, woke my boyfriend up and dragged him to cheesecake with me. I did not regret coming at all.  Our server was Andre, and he gave excellent service. My boyfriend and I was sharing a Caesar salad and chicken Bellagio and half way done I realized that the chicken was pink! Since I don't really eat the chicken I didn't notice it till the plate was almost finished. So I waved Andre down told him the situation and asked to just cook the chicken more. They brought out a brand new plate of chicken Bellagio with the pasta and everything even though we basically finished the last one! I was so amazed and did not expect that at all. Of course we had to pack it and take it home since it was too much food. Bravo to the excellent service and amazing kitchen. I will definitely be coming to the Brea location more!"
Rebekkah C.,"Orange County, CA",598,385,3780,2.0,6/10/2016,"Yummy food, but terrible experience! (2 1/2 STARS) It's been a loooong time since I've been to CF. CF's Ad on Insta worked and enticed me to go O_o. We went on a week night 8:30pm, and it was very busy. That's a good sign! We asked for a table for 2 and told us the wait was only going to be 5 minutes. They offered bar seating and we said no. They gave us a buzzer/pager thing and we waited for 15 minutes. Not a big deal. We were not in a hurry, but what annoyed me was after the pager vibrated, we went back in and they didn't have a table for us.They offered bar seating again, which we already declined in the beginning! They apologized and gave us another buzzer and waited for another 10 minutes.  At the table, our server was very nice. I liked that she made lil conversations and even teased me a bit about how much I love their MOLASSES BREAD ^_^. (sooo good!). It was going great until she messed up El hubby's order. She put in the wrong one. Awww man...I got my food and we had to wait for 15 minutes for his food to come. It also didn't help that we were seated next to a large group of loud teens. Siiiigghh.... As for the food, it was delicious. I tried their KALE and SALMON SALAD. Sooo good, healthy and filling. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the salad had the right amount of dressing. El Hubby had their FRIED SHRIMP with coleslaw and french fries. Perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp! Yum! We also had their CALAMARI. It needed more salt. Probably wont get it next time.  It's gonna be awhile til we go back."
Darren S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"They NEED to update their credit card machine!! We tried to use a $100 visa prepaid card but they informed us that it was declined 3 times. However, we visited a local boba shop shortly after and it worked on the 1st try. In fact, last year we came with a $50 Cheesecake Factory gift card and that was also denied a couple times. Our waitress was very thoughtful in her quiet manner of letting us know that our card was declined, but the manager treated us as if we came in with a fraudulent intent."
Brian W.,"Brea, CA",3,6,19,1.0,11/11/2017,"Unbelievable, just ordered curbside pickup, and disappointed to say the least. First I got there right on time, and called the number posted there for curbside pickup but no answer. After waiting fora bit I walked in (which I don't mind doing but what's the point of offering curbside pickup). I was surprised by the amount of $41.38 but since my wife ordered I figured she got more than the 2 entrees we planned on. Unfortunately it was just the 2 ""specials"" and 1 slice of cheesecake. As you can see from my photos I was flabbergasted at the price of $15.95 for the miso salmon, $13.95 for pasta with sausage and $8.50 for 1 slice of cheesecake ( more like whipped cream w cheesecake on the side) lol. Those prices I could understand at the right portion but seriously both entrees looked half eaten (the full price dinner price is $17.50) looks like we got half the portion for $3 off. The online menu I found had cheesecake priced $6.95 to $7.95 of course ours is $8.50 (although this might be outdated) still the slices are clearly cut in 1/12 which places a full cheesecake at $102.00 nice. Of course they don,t have pictures and prices on lunch size specials. Smh. We used to eat here all the time goes not any more!"
Anthony B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,2.0,11/10/2017,Wife and i got out of the house for a staycation/date night. Unfortunately it took an hour for the food to come out (sounds like they delivered our food to the wrong table). Manager came over and apologized that we had to wait so long for our order which was nice since everyone around us that ordered after us were well into their meals. The chicken dish we got was pretty good but i couldn't eat the chicken/mango salad. The dressing combo with the salad just didn't go together well. Experience was just ok. Would've been nice to have a discount on our bill or a free slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience we experienced but nothing offered.
