Angela E.,"Yorba Linda, CA",31,205,133,3.0,10/24/2015,"The food continues to be good. This trip was early on a Saturday. It was pretty crowded. We sat in bar. Service was fine. However, the whole experience was terrible b/c the temp in the restaurant was so unbearably cold. We rushed to get out."
L P.,"La Puente, CA",1,43,482,5.0,1/4/2015,Came to celebrate the new year here with my family. . Food and service is always the best. Friendly and courteous service. The food was great. Everything we order was cooked to perfection. And the best drinks ever
Alex S.,"Monterey Park, CA",6,64,12,5.0,12/31/2015,Nice place. Food was ok...typical Cheesecake Factory. 5stars for service and cleanliness.
Fidel T.,"Pomona, CA",26,51,133,2.0,4/25/2015,"I went here because I was craving their pasta. To start it off our waitress Veronica got our drinks then didn't come back for 10 minutes to take our order. As we waited she never came back until our food came. When it came she asked for anything and brought more bread since we asked. I usually get Evelynes favorite pasta, but this time it was a different pasta noodle. I'm not too picky so I managed. After this she never came. The manager had to come to refill our drinks that's how often our waitress attended to us. Years later she comes asking for dessert. OF COURSE HONEY I said YASSSS! 10 minutes later she brings a menu and 8 minutes later she comes to take our order. We get cheesecake and she leaves the bill. She soon comes back for the bill of course because she wants her tip honey. I'll give you a tip honey, wait your tables better!!... Just sayin"
Eric I.,"Cerritos, CA",0,26,4,4.0,4/20/2015,First time at Cheesecake Factory. Parking was very ample and there was no wait what so ever. Got seated and our server Holland took our drink order. He seemed like a cool guy but we felt a bit rushed. He didn't seem very enthusiastic like the other server in the section next to us. Unsure if he was grumpy because he has to work on 4/20. But regardless the food tasted amazing but service could have been better. I wish they did something special for my girlfriend for her birthday. We will probably come back in the near future. Yeah we were hella rushed.
Ray F.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,1,4.0,9/12/2016,"Great service from our waitress Jennifer,  great food, seasoned well, huge cheesecake,  and just a great staff. The only thing I would change is where you have to go to the hostess,  I would put it closer to the front door so you could actually talk to the hostess instead of waiting to get closer so you could hear them. All in all a good place! On our short list of restaurants"
Samantha G.,"Placentia, CA",3,9,,2.0,7/22/2014,"Cheesecake Factory always has great good, but tonight was not a very SANITARY night. YUCK! ALL of the utensils had food gunk all ober them. We asked for new utensils and we got a whole new set with gunk on them again.  We requested small plates to share our meal and even the plates had food gunk on them. We had to take our napkins and water to clean off the utensils and plates. The napkins ended up being as dirty as a dish rag. YUCK and YUCK!!!!!"
Mark W.,"Westwood, CA",0,13,6,5.0,4/11/2015,"I love cheese cake factory. They never disappoint me no matter which branch I go to. My favorite dishes are the barbecue chicken salad, bang bang chickens and chicken bellagio. Staff are very nice and professional and treat you very well. Highly recommend their Godiva cheesecake!!"
Frank F.,"Santa Ana, CA",13,25,6,4.0,2/22/2016,This was my first time eating here and I was really pleased with the food and service. We came here to celebrate my sons bday at his request. I had the chicken and pasta dish from the skinny menu and it was good. Our server Nicky was great! The vibe is cool and we will definitely return.
Emily Y.,"Brea, CA",1,4,,2.0,9/5/2016,"We were seated quickly which was exciting for the cheesecake factory.  Our waiter seemed nice;however, from the time we ordered til our food arrived, it was about AN HOUR!  With three kids, that was not okay.  Our waiter had a VERY large party and it was obvious that was his priority.  Wishing the money that was spent was spent elsewhere."
Deanna D.,"West Covina, CA",4,55,92,4.0,1/20/2015,"Off of the SKINNYLICIOUS MENU: Grilled Steak Medallions, goodness in your mouth. Off the pastas menu: Louisiana Chicken Pasta, it was alright. Nothing to brag about!! Off the dessert menu: White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake, you WILL NOT be disappointed."
Neil D.,"La Mirada, CA",245,140,69,3.0,11/9/2014,"Name and Such makes it popular.  I used to frequent when I worked nearby, and always ordered some 36 hour marinated steak.  Wasn't able to this time as it was not available, but none the less couldn't complain about the service or food. Had their catch of the day, grilled salmon and strawberry lemonade.  Didn't make room for cheesecake this time around.  I'll come back again."
Sameel S.,"Glendora, CA",5,9,3,5.0,7/4/2016,"We've been coming for years, as most have. So I'm not going to comment on the food as most already know what they are getting. I'm giving a shout out to the best server I ever had, Michael. He sang my wife a bday song, and he was a great singer! Made us feel right at home. Very knowledgeable. A++++++ as a server. Seemed like a genuinely great non judgmental person. We need more people like him in the world."
Victoria B.,"Fullerton, CA",8,44,15,5.0,6/22/2016,Today I had such an amazing experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Brea. My best friend and I eat at The Cheesecake Factory twice a month and order the same thing every single time. We order the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta with extra sauce and add sun dried tomatoes. This is such an amazing dish the food always come out perfect. On occasion when we are feeling extra hungry we order one of the many specialty egg rolls appetizers. Now for the most part this is one of the busiest restaurants in town so it's understandable when the service is just adequate but to was outstanding. Today we had the pleasure of having Lu as our server. He was incredible! So friendly and on top of everything our drinks were never empty and he got everything right! My best friend and I have had out Cheesecake tradition for over two years now and we finally found a server who is exactly what we need. We will be coming back for Lu! Thank you!
Minnie B.,"Orange, CA",325,27,23,4.0,2/14/2016,I've been here numerous times. The service is good. The food is always good. Their bread is my favorite! I usually get the pasta with shrimp and Angel hair. I love their banana cheesecake! The service today was ok. We have to flag her down for water. Usually they refill drinks frequently.
Omar P.,"Brea, CA",2099,372,31,4.0,12/9/2012,"Expect a long wait, but well worth it. I love the decor and the whole layout of the restaurant. You are provided with half a french roll and a squaw roll w/butter. Nice touch especially when the bread is nice and warm. Started out with the tex mex eggrolls- good flavors and comes with guacamole and salsa. Unfortunately the quality of the guacamole was lacking. I got the BBQ Salmon served with corn succotash, mash potatoes, and crisp onion rings. A steal @ 16.95. All the items work well together and I just love BBQ sauce on my salmon. My wife had Chipotle Chicken Pasta. Quite tasty, but a little too savory. To finish the meal we tried the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. Crunchy pecan with pumpkin cheesecake lined with peanut butter brittle. Great to the last bite. Worth a trip- especially if you like variety. Ton of items on the menu."
Elizabeth H.,"Corona, CA",3,58,29,1.0,1/23/2016,The chicken entree we ordered was pretty good but the skinny Long Island ice tea was so sweet. Told the server and he replied that it was the agave syrup. FYI the ingredients printed on menu had NO agave syrup. Nothing was done. Wasted my money. Not coming back
Lee T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,10,4.0,4/9/2015,Hardly will ever disappoint. One of my favorite chains. Service was good and the dessert was better. The happy hour menu had a large selection to choose from.
Alisha B.,"Las Vegas, NV",114,14,11,4.0,8/9/2015,The food was great! Unfortunately I had a piece of hard plastic from one of the large food storage containers. Our waitress and Manager where great on apologizing and making sure all was ok. They took my meal off the bill and gave our party all free dessert.
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,5.0,12/29/2010,"Thank you, family, for all the foodie gift certificates! You know we love to eat!  4pm on a Monday meant no waiting, and still lunch special pricing! (good until 5pm)  After the warm free bread, we dug into some appetizers.  We went crazy for the Crispy Crab Wontons which came with a vinegar dipping sauce, a refreshing change from red dye #4 sweet and sour sauce. We also loved the Crispy Artichoke Hearts from the small plates menu - 9 for $3.95. They may have been marinated, but they were still good. For my entree - the best of both worlds .... Shrimp AND Bacon Club Sandwich. The bread was wonderfully buttery and if I wasn't totally full from all the appetizers, I could have finished it! As it was, we had SOOOO many leftovers to take home that we had enough for a whole second meal.  Unfortunately, which is usually the case at this place, no room for cheesecake!  Dagnabbit! And it looked really good, too! Very good service, with plenty of check ins and drink refills!"
