Jennifer N.,"San Diego, CA",268,370,216,2.0,8/21/2012,"I haven't been in forever since the lines are SO long, but I happened to be in Orange county and we went early. I remember them tasting a lot better...wasn't terribly impressed though. Maybe it was the location? I got the lunch combo but the sandwich was very plain (even though I had to send it back 3 times because they kept putting mayo on it; props to the waiter, Ben i think, for being very apologetic and nice), they could have made it their own with some kind of sauce or different topping than tomato and cheese....the salad didn't even have carrots or cucumbers, JUST red lettuce and dressing.  For a place whose had such a bad health wrap, I'll give them a star for creating a healthy menu under 500 calories, but the ahi tartare left much to be desired with only ahi, avocado and a little sauce (which was good in its own right) but could have had more than 4 chips and/or add cucumbers or onions or SOMEthing. I'll go back for the cheesecake, but it's definitely not going to be my first choice for a meal, especially in SD."
M C.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,3,1.0,2/13/2016,"Very Disappointed with the way the manager handled my situation.  The server was good, food was good however when I was eating my dessert there was a thick short black hair in my Smores cheesecake. I called the server and she apologized and asked me if I wanted a new one. I was upset because the last thing I expect on my dessert is to have hair. The manager came by and apologized however I expected at least for him to provide us with a discount instead they only took my dessert away from the bill and paid for everything else. I will not be back that is for sure. I will take my business elsewhere."
Emily Z.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/29/2016,Cheesecake Factory is an amazing place for a casual lunch for two or even dinner for a big group! My friends and I love this place so much! The reason I didn't give five stars is because their service and staff isn't always the kindest but most of the time they are very sweet and accommodating. The variety of foods they have at this place are endless! Easily one of my favorite restaurants
Stephen L.,"Placentia, CA",8,15,4,2.0,11/8/2015,For a restaurant that I've thought greatly of ever since high school. This franchise has now began to suck and be such a disappointment. Food quality has suffered immensely. The food is too salty and the cheesecake was terrible. They are no longer going to earn our business.
Lawrence L.,"Covina, CA",513,1037,7335,4.0,11/18/2010,"Spent a nice time celebrating a birthday with some dear friends at the Brea Mall edition of the CF.  Aside from the great company, the experience at this chain restaurant is so typical of most of the locations that I have been to... not that it's a bad thing, there just isn't much to write about that is new... Obviously known for their wide selection of cheesecakes (well... DUH!), you can find almost anything on their menu that is high calorie, high carb comfort food... On this occasion, I did something that I usually don't do -- I ordered the Rib Eye Steak;  I guess I was in the mood for some beef.  It was decently sized, well marbled, boneless cut;  even though I usually go for the bone-in cuts because I feel that they have more flavor.  Grilled with the requisite cross-hatches on both sides medium rare, you could do worse for a steak for $29.95 all things considered. I also had the soup du jour, the Creamy Chicken Noodle soup;  meh... it was ok but I've had better soup du jours from the CF in the past. The most memorable part of my meal was the refreshing red Sangria in a wine glass with fresh fruit on the rocks, smooth.  The other half of the most memorable part was the slice of Italian Tiramisu cheesecake, close to another 1000 calories, but what the hell, it was delish. From my vantage point, a good time was had by all in our party,  so I can't complain too much about anything.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  The place was busy all night but we were seated without too much of a wait at 500pm on a Saturday.  Since we had a party of eight, the bill was padded with an 18% discretionary gratuity but this wasn't unusual... so with tax and tip, with drinks and appetizers too, it came out to around $40 a head... not too shabby..."
GlamKat L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",200,180,471,4.0,10/13/2014,I love this place.The menu is filled with many choices and the food is delicious..service is always good...and of course the cheese cake..what else?..blueberry mojitos are the best here. Only bad thing is that it gets packed during the weekend so make a reservation.
Shae H.,"Oceanside, CA",0,67,34,4.0,7/31/2015,"Cheesecake Factory will always be my first love when it comes to American Restaurants.  You can expect the Shrimp Scampi in Cheesecake Factory at Raleigh, NC to taste the same as the Shrimp Scampi over at their Brea location.  Speaking of, this is my favorite dish - the shrimp scampi over a bed of angel hair pasta.  Once in a while, I will order something different, but I always come back to that crispy shrimp with garlic sauce.  Husband loves the steak diane with mashed potato and the daughter prefers the miso salmon over rice.  I love to finish it off with their kahlua cheesecake.   Consistency is key when you're traveling all over the US and wants something familiar, and Cheesecake Factory delivers that every time."
Rock R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,5,3.0,1/21/2016,"great food. the shepherd pie was the best I've ever had. I've been here before and received excellent service. however, last night Chris our Server wasn't on cue.  his mind was elsewhere. it certainly wasn't with the customers.  when our hostess walked us to our table my wife immediately notice the bench seat dirty, grabbed the clothe napkin from the table and began to clean the seat before sitting. the hostess just watched her and did not offer to get someone to come and clean it. the table was slightly tacky with some residue. I scraped off food on my side of the table.  If I return, and Chris is working that day, I will kindly request not to be in his area."
Indy P.,"Fullerton, CA",0,58,,1.0,8/29/2016,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Quoted a wait time of 15 minutes (we waited 25, which was not great but OK). It took 35-40 minutes to get our food (which was unacceptable). While everyone else around us (who came in much later was already halfway through their meals), we were fighting over the bread. Our waitress (Alejandra) passed our table many times but actually stopped only once to refill our bread because we were obviously starving and had devoured everything in sight that was edible. We had to flag her down after 25 minutes to ask about the food. Only then did it seem to occur to her that we had been waiting a LONG time. She brought out my entree -- Tuscan chicken -- and it was COLD, which indicates to me that the meal had been sitting there for a while waiting to be picked up by her. She told hubby that his dish was going to take longer (he didn't order anything fancy -- beef steak tacos!). We start eating MY meal together and he finally gets his tacos about 5 minutes later -- and it, too, was COLD. Aside from the temperature of the food, neither of us were impressed with the TASTE of our selections either.  Mine was supposed to be ""served over vegetables and farro."" The picture depicted showed a generous heap of farro but I could actually COUNT each grain on my plate. There was no more than a teaspoon! It was my first time ordering this so maybe that's the norm but it certainly did not look like the picture they had.  Hubby is NOT a picky eater AT ALL, but even he was underwhelmed w/ the beef tacos. Overall, a horrible experience. Oh, I had to use a butter knife on my chicken because I asked (twice) for a knife to cut my meat and after waiting 10 minutes, they brought out a knife that WAS DIRTY. The second knife they brought out (I was almost done with the meal by now), was cleaner. The only reason we came was for the cheesecakes which I love. But at $8.59 for a slice of mango key lime cheesecake, I expected a lot more than the thin wimpy stingy sliver that I got -- the 2 heaps of whipped cream (which I don't even like) covered up the cheap portion and we did not realize this until we got home. I couldn't believe it. What a rip off! Further, hubby told our waitress we were celebrating my birthday. She never once said happy birthday, nor did she offer the birthday sundae that many tables around us got.This is possibly the worse restaurant experience I've encountered this year so far -- from the wait time to the despicable portions to the clueless wait staff. I've never had a perfect experience (or even a glowing one) at any Cheesecake Factory locations but this is by far, hands-down the most inept."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,4.0,3/17/2013,"I have liked all the Cheesecake Factory locations that I have been to, and this location is no exception.  I have to say that the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant chain!  Unfortunately, my wife thinks that the Grand Lux Cafe chain is better so we end up going there more often.  They are sister restaurants though. We have been to this Brea location twice this year for dinner.  Parking has not been a problem.  I do not believe they currently have valet parking.  We have not had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table which is great!  At other locations, the wait is normally 30 minutes or longer for dinner.  The service was terrific during our first visit.  The last visit, the service was not as good.  During that last visit, I believe our server was new so I'll give her a pass for taking so long with taking our orders and helping us.  That is the reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars though. The food is delicious, and they give generous portions.  We always have leftovers good for one or two meals afterwards.  The entree prices are pricey, but the portions help make up for it.  There are many different choices on the menu so you are sure to find something you like.  I have not found anything bad yet. Make sure to save room for dessert!!  That's the reason I always have leftovers is because I save room for the cheesecake!!  Going to Costco and buying their cheesecake at the frozen section is just not nearly as good as getting the cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory itself.  My current favorites are the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake.  I just wish they weren't so expensive!! If you just want to buy a slice of cheesecake, then you can buy it at the front when you walk into the restaurant.  They have a counter and display there.  The display showcases many of their cheesecakes and other desserts.  The display of cheesecakes is the most beautiful attraction in the restaurant!"
Cohdy D.,"Tustin, CA",4,21,9,2.0,11/11/2014,"Service during a rush is a joke. Don't expect anything but excuses from the managerial staff either.  I have visited this location two times and both times it happened to be during a busy lunch hour slot. Both within the last two months.  I have ordered the same thing every time I go to because it's always great; lunch salmon with all broccoli. Our waters with lemon came out without lemon, had to wait five minutes to see our waitress again to ask for the lemon and then waited another five minutes after that for her to realize we never got our bread basket. We tried to order when she brought us the basket but before I got a word out she was off to another table.  We waited another seven minutes to have her back at our table to take our order.  Food came out promptly and we ate pretty quick because it's always good food. But once again when we were totally finished eating we were sitting there for an extended period of time with no refills or our bill. So when we saw the waitress again we asked for a manager.  This was the kicker. The manager told us she had a few trainees on the wait staff at the moment. I don't know any restaurant management that trains newbies during their busiest time slot. It just doesn't happen for this exact reason. She went to take a percentage off our bill but the waitress had already run our card so later I found out I was double charged by them.  Horrible experience, questionable managerial staff but good food. A+ to the cooks for holding these places together because otherwise I wouldn't walk into one of these places."
Daniel P.,"Chicago, IL",252,12,,2.0,1/9/2016,My visit to the cheese factory was bad and sorta good. They put my table of 4 and a baby high chair in tables with the chairs I thought it would be common sense to put us in a booth. Then after the server was kinda behind when I order a water with a lemon I didn't get the lemon and barely got a refill on water. My stay wasn't well.
Jay B.,"Chino, CA",771,706,27,4.0,2/5/2013,"Mmmmmm, Cheesecake Factory.  Mmmmmm Strawberry Lemonade, mmmmmm....honey wheat bread.   Typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant, large spread of menu items, and I mean LARGE, lots of desserts, and almost too many choices, but it's hard to go wrong, whatever you choose.   WARNING - This is a HIGH volume restaurant.  It's been crowded almost every time i've eaten here, regardless of the time of day.  So for them, it's a great location, for us....not so much.  Parking can be hit and miss as well, esp since it's in the mall.   With that said, the servers are good, we've never had issues, and we always enjoy our meal here, ESPECIALLY the bread, ha ha ha.  I really love that  bread."
Amanda R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,5,5.0,1/5/2016,"Went for dinner with my boyfriend tonight. Great dining experience, our server was Leah D, whom was awesome. She was so attentive and seemed extremely genuine. I observed her section get busy but that didn't seemed to affect her A+++ service. Always keeping calm and even taking the time to joke with us and making us feel like her most important table. Avocado rolls were delicious, paired with a sweet sauce that was amazing.  We each had a separate chicken dish which we gobbled up. And of course we finished the meal off with white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake, my favorite!  Overall, wonderful dining experience from the scrumptious food, hard working bussers and food runners  to Leah's great service.  Thank you all."
Nick H.,"Anaheim, CA",1968,2395,6076,3.0,4/11/2010,"2.5 Stars. Couldn't eat my Burger!  Extra .5 star 'cause that dang red velvet cheesecake was sooo good! I haven't been to cheesecake factory for years.. probably over ten years. I began to crave it again after seeing a Cheesecake factory box over at Dean's Curry Pizza in Long Beach. I was also craving burger so opted to come here.  I ordered the factory burger with Swiss cheese prepared medium-well. It came on a baguette. I figured this was a bakery so the baguette would be good. It wasn't. Hard as a rock. I even took one side off like an open sandwich and it was useless. Still, hard as heck.  ~Factory Burger- 1 Star  This burger sucked, primarily because of that bread. On the same note..the meat was very dry. Hard to explain. It wasn't juicy at all. What good is meat if it's not juicy meat? Don't get your meat where you get your bread... I should have stuck to the regular hamburger bun. How could a burger that looked so yummy..be so uneatable!  In all honesty, I ate almost half of the burger. I brought the other half back and just gave it to the dog. What a waste. I noticed that my dog didn't eat the baguette either..just the meat. However, this is no fault of Cheesecake factory, as she never eats bread. I just thought it was funny this time.  ~Red Velvet Cheesecake~4.5 stars!  They did a good job with this bad boy.. Yummy and well prepared. Absolutely Delicious. I would order this again, but will do so in another ten years. My bad burger ruined my night.  If you are paying 10 bucks for a burger..it better be right. Cheesecake Factory needs to take a lesson from BIG MIKE'S in Long Beach. That's a burger."
Zule B.,"Bellflower, CA",4,28,2,1.0,9/9/2015,The food was good and service was good but wow i cant believe no one. NOT EVEN THE MANAGER knows the ingredients of whats in what. I asked for specifically what is in the sourdough bread. I could've been allergic? Vegan? Ok im ranting now but thats a shame really...
Kim J.,"Riverside, CA",18,156,18,5.0,5/2/2015,Great food and service when I went yesterday. The service was excellent because the waitress was helpful and would refill our drinks without someone asking for a refill. I loved the spaghetti and meatball lunch plate. The gave generous portions and the price was good for the size. I had no room for dessert but next time I will try some of the cheesecakes.
Chriss L.,"Fullerton, CA",41,507,269,5.0,5/6/2012,"Most people think of huge portions that could feed a small village when it comes to CF BUT be of good cheer fellow CF lovers, their new ""small bites menu"" delights the palate, wallet & tummy. I think they actually call it ""skinnylicious menu"" which I find a little disturbing because the portions are still of sharable size (I think), but I digress. The foods are perfect for people who generally eat smaller portions or just don't want to gain 5-10 lb in a single, unbelievably delicious, meal. It also allows you to try more items without having a ton of leftovers or getting that gross, overate-feeling. I guess in the end, it doesn't matter what is ordered, because at some point we will all stuff our faces with their irresistable  cheesecake or other mouth watering desserts."
Jeni H.,"Calabasas, CA",816,322,532,5.0,1/14/2013,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory :) The outdoor seating at this location is particularly nice and the location is ideal for post-shopping dinner.  Weekend nights, you may want to make a reservation- this location can get busy!"
Ms. V.,"Fullerton, CA",1,48,15,2.0,4/17/2015,"This is not a review for the food, just the service. I love food and cheesecake at this chain, but I have always had problems with the service and this time was one bad experience too many.  Came in. The hostess was meh, just looking me over with dead eyes. Got seated. Server comes and takes my drink order. Then I wait and wait. The drinks come. Then I wait and wait and wait. Three groups come after me and she takes their order. But not mine. I didn't even get bread! I think about speaking up, but don't because honestly, it was not busy and I shouldn't have to be flagging down a server to take a simple order when it isn't even busy. So I leave a few bucks for the drinks and leave. No one notices. I won't be coming back to this location again."
