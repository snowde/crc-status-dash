Im a fan! ALSO try the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake ...delish!"
Tom I.,"Walnut, CA",46,28,12,4.0,6/14/2014,Pretty much love this place. Nothing but positive experiences. EXCEPT for today. It wasn't really that bad. The Hostess didn't seem too friendly or even personable to my Dad who was listing our party etc. She could have just been having a bad day. Oh well not my problem. Im just here for to eat. We sat down at some tables instead of a booth where we usually sit. It was a little different. Being out in the open and people staring at you like your the only black guy in the cheesecake factory...oh wait...(skin check)  Nevermind. Now where was I? Oh ya So we sat down and we waited and waited for for someone to greet us and take drink orders water bread and such. So we waited for like 5 mins. Then a couple seats to our left. They get served. Two ladies sit to my right and they get bread and served.( DONT WORRY THE RACE CARD IS STAYING IN THE WALLET) LOL JK.  My mom jokingly said to the two ladies next to us we haven't been served and they felt so bad they offered us some bread like we were homeless. We kindly declined flagged down another hostess and she was Very nice and got someone right away. The food was bomb as Always. Can't complain. I had the fried shrimp platter (Cheat day) and it was good. I also have a Peanut butter cheesecake currently on the green mile of my fridge and shall be dealt with a little later tonight. Overall great experience. Love it here.
C A.,"Irvine, CA",1,24,18,1.0,3/16/2016,"WORST Cheesecake Factory location! Every single time I come here, the service is terrible. My food comes out cold, or wrong. I typically get either filet (medium rare) or a sandwich (w/no mayo) and 10/10 times, my sandwich has mayo & my steak is cooked well-done like a piece of leather. The servers try to be fancy & appear educated, so they don't write orders down.... Maybe they should! Why do I keep coming here, you ask? Well, it's centrally located & convenient, but honestly I would rather drive to the Cheesecake Factory at the Garden Walk in Anaheim! The service there is top-notch & they're so friendly- unlike this place. Today was the final day that I come here. It took 45 minutes for my sandwich to come out. The server never brought us bread or gave me a refill, and ... Wait for it.... My food came out completely wrong (and cold)... Our server didn't tell us her name, so I can't put her on blast if I wanted to but all she kept saying was ""oh okay sorry"" and then walked away. Wow! I'm a fan of this chain but seriously the Brea location SUCKS!! The hostess/hosts are snobby, the servers are not friendly, the chefs clearly don't know what the heck they're doing & the managers probably obtained a managerial role because of mommy or daddy. Basically, don't come here. 100% of the time I go, my meal is a disaster... And I'm not even picky!!! Get it together brea"
Tom C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",5,23,38,2.0,8/25/2014,"If you're looking for great service better steer clear.  Drink order after waiting 15 minutes another 10 to get them and it just went downhill from there.. food has become VERY pedestrian like the Thai lettuce wraps how the price increased but the size decreased, scorched dry chicken and flavorless. Just an awful experience and it's not the first time but probably the last unless it's happy hour. Cheesecake alone have this the second star. You won't stand on just your name for long.."
Ruben Q.,"Anaheim, CA",1,22,,4.0,6/12/2016,"This place has a vast menu. I particularly like the Cajun dish, and of course, their cheesecake. Wait can be long, so I'd suggest to come mid afternoon before or after the main meal times."
Ivy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,58,24,1.0,2/19/2014,"I was here several weeks ago because I was craving their fried Mac and cheese. I ordered the appetizer when the server took our drink order. It took the server about 7 minutes to bring out our drinks, still no appetizer. The server had to drop off other drinks before returning to our table to take our order about 5 minutes later. After ordering our entrées, we waited about 15 minutes the entrees to arrive, still no appetizer. At this point, 25 minutes had passed since we had ordered our appetizer.  Let's get this straight, we ordered our appetizer with our drinks and still our entrees arrived before the appetizer. I had to flag down the server and inquire about the appetizer because she didn't even stop by to see if our entrees arrived correctly. She looked surprised when I brought it up and asked if we still wanted it. She left to check on it and came back with the response, ""I just checked and the kitchen burnt your first round of fried Mac and Cheese, but they're working on another one. It should be out any moment.""  We actually waited 15 minutes for the appetizer to arrive--totaling in about 40 minutes since we ordered it. By then my boyfriend had already finished his entree and I was too full to actually enjoy the appetizer. To my amazement, she still charged us for the appetizer.  Clearly our server forgot to place the appetizer order. She was surprised when I reminded her about it, and had the audacity to ask if I still wanted it. If the kitchen truly burnt the appetizer, it still would have arrived significantly earlier than our entrees. Had the kitchen also made a mistake, she would have taken the app off our bill. It was her mistake and she didn't want to own up to it. She didn't even apologize. Please don't blame the kitchen for your mistake. And please do not charge the customer for your mistakes either."
Jason T.,"Los Angeles, CA",286,66,42,3.0,5/1/2016,"Having been to Cheesecake Factory in the past, I know what I was getting into. Coming here the food is normally good and service is ok. Every restaurant has good and bad nights and last night was a bad night. Yes, Saturdays are very busy but I didn't feel I got what I paid for. First, we reminded our waiter for bread and he forgot and had to be reminded again. Second, our food took over 45 mins and our waiter wasn't aware that it was running late until we mentioned it. Third, our waiter was a tad rude on top of being un-attentive. We asked for a substitution for a dish and our waiter obliged, but failed to mention it would be an additional charge while taking away the pasta from the dish. Later when we asked the waiter about it, he tried to rationalize it by saying vegetables are more expensive than pasta. Maybe he was new or doesn't have much experience with customer interaction, but I don't think this was very professional on his part. He could've worded his explanation a lot better and we left The Cheesecake Factory feeling disappointed and with a bad taste in our mouths. Service always trumps food and if a meal is great, but the service is poor you'll feel like it was a waste and that's what we got from The Cheesecake Factory. Next time we decide to come here, we will think twice and take our business elsewhere."
Dianne P.,"San Diego, CA",20,10,,4.0,10/6/2015,"We had lunch here on Monday Oct 5th with my parents  and grandchildren.  We waited 40 minutes for our lunch to be served without water or bread refills. It had been some time since we ate at a cheesecake factory ad will be,a long time til we consider returning. The food was fine once we got it. I don't appreciate  poor service when we could have chosen other restaurants  in the area. Not going to recommend this place."
R M.,"San Diego, CA",1,60,,2.0,3/9/2016,"We came to this location for my boyfriend's birthday, Justine was our server. She was okay in the beginning, although we were sitting there for about 10 minutes before we got greeted. After she took our order she checked on us maybe twice after that. She checked IDs for drinks and she realized it was one of our birthdays but didn't say happy birthday either. She told us she would come back to refill our waters and never did, we had to flag another server down to get us some condiments since she was nowhere to be found, it only bothered us because there were only 3 tables in the bar area at the time where we were seated and we saw her in the corner talking with other servers and then she disappeared . We wanted to sneak over to her to ask if we could do something special for his birthday but we couldn't find her after that . The food was good which explains the 2 stars, just wish we could have had a little more attentive service."
Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,289,566,5.0,1/9/2013,"I am obsessed with the dulce de leche cheesecake, I have written many reviews about it. I just can't get enough of it. This location is pretty nice, not as loud as other ones,the area is pretty quiet. I went on a Sunday at 9:00pm so that may be why. They always bring yummy bread to start off with, white one and some other wheat one. I love the wheat one better, there's so much more flavor. We started off with the chicken croquetes, they were pretty good. A little greasy for my liking. They're very similar to chicken empanadas except these are deep fried instead of baked.  For the entree, we split a chicken madeira (as usual) best way to eat asparagus! grilled and topped in yummy madeira wine sauce. The chicken has melted cheese on top! By the time we were done eating, we had no room for dessert. I took a piece of the dulce de leche cheesecake and I wanted to eat it on the way home but I didn't. I ate it half of it the next day with a hot cup of coffee. Yummm I recommend black coffee for extremely sweet cheesecake. It's a nice balance. Anyway,. this location is nice. Easy to find parking, good service."
Victor G.,"Anaheim, CA",16,13,2,5.0,10/23/2015,Excellent service...Charles was the best waiter we've ever had.. He went above and beyond.. Food was excellent and hot on the wait was short on a very busy Friday.. Had a blast
Vicki M.,"Orange, CA",0,90,3,5.0,8/28/2015,"Have frequented this location about 4-6x a year for 9 years, and LOVE the food. Always excellent and so many choices. Best Chicken Piccata and Chicken Marsala with HUGE portions so great take home. Then there is the INCREDIBLE cheesecake menu. Have MANY faves, but lately husband digs the Hershey Cheesecake (chocolate EVERYTHING) and I am hooked on the S'Mores Cheesecake (complete with Graham Cracker pieces and toasted Marshmallow, OMG!!!!). YUM!!!!!"
Marc M.,"Brea, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/21/2015,"This place sometimes gets it and too often doesn't.... I've been visiting this location for the past 8 years, maybe six to eight times a year and the cheese cake is amazing every time...unlike their entree dishes. I really have mixed feelings about their food because sometimes they get the item right and sometimes they screw it up. I've even tried ordering the same dish again because I liked it the time before and it was different. All in all in the location is okay but nothing to write home about."
A C.,"Corona, CA",5,43,3,2.0,8/27/2014,No one was available to seat me when I arrived. It was not busy. Luckily my friend got there ahead of me and already was seated. Our server was very attentive though.  I ordered the Almond Chicken sandwich with Mushroom soup and salad. The sandwich was not good and tasted more like bland ground turkey. The mushroom soup was way too oily. The raspberry cheesecake was yummy and was the only thing worth the cost.
Ataa G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",532,5,2,1.0,10/17/2015,"Wow, where do I start. My family and I eat out every Friday night and we go to a variety of restaurants. Since we didn't have the full family together I decided to go again to Cheesecake Factory. Last time we went was months ago and even then the service was pretty horrid. My mother just ordered a BBQ salmon with asparagus, which turned out to have a few pieces of penne on her dish (most likely from the chefs incompetence from another persons order), the asparagus wasn't cooked and for some reason there was gravy poured on her salmon, by mistake most likely. I ordered a chicken piccata which was cooked with too much oil that made the meal unpleasant. From the very beginning all our appetizer and salad plates we ordered our server forgot to pick up the dishes which made our table cluttered. After he dropped off the dishes he never came once to tell us how our meal was till the very end when we finished. Each year this particular restaurant in Brea goes down in service and food. I will most likely never come here again.  I added a star because the one good thing I looked forward to here was their amazing cheesecake."
Peter P.,"Cerritos, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/8/2016,"1 star for the bread and butter, the server was nice, and the michelada alright. Look, this place is overpriced for what you're getting. The food sucks. Go across the street to Lazy Dog. Straight up."
Pourio L.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,527,37,2.0,10/26/2012,"The only thing that's good at any Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake. Everything else is way too salty or oily. It's a good place to take a date for dessert if you have reservations because the decor and atmosphere is nice but yeah... don't go for food. I've been to this one and a few other across SoCal. They're all the same.  Parking: Plenty but on a wkend night can be crazy Price: Not bad for cheesecake, everything else is overpriced Wait: 20-40 mins on wkend"
Lila B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",58,94,295,4.0,5/15/2012,"This place never lets me down .. A variety of food and all of it is great. Coming around lunch time there was no wait, waitress was very pleasant.  Please... If you haven't already try the MISO SALMON... With mash potatoes instead of rice It's beyond FANTASTICAL!!!  Funny enough, the lunch portion is alot..I only ate 1/2 so I have some for later. Yay!!! Too full for dessert but there nothing wrong with ordering some to go.. I'm such a greedy person. I LOVE FOOD!! :)"
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,4.0,10/21/2012,"I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory many times, and each time I am there I try to get something different. This is not because of my adventurous spirit, but I genuinely haven't found anything to me my ""usual."" My friends loves the place, and when we go there is usually a long wait especially on Friday and Saturday nights. After seated, you will find yourself LOST in the menu with all the different choices. Most are descriptive and sound great. I honestly haven't had an entree there that I can say was better than average. The Cheesecake is good. Obviously with that name, they HAVE to have good cheesecake. Well I think the factory should stick to desserts. The service there has always been good, and it is an upscale and clean restaurant. This also serves no function to me when I don't enjoy my meal that much. I have eaten there for brunch on a few occasions and I must say that the breakfast menu is much better in comparison. The waffles are good, as well as omelets. I do not know if it is because of their location near shopping malls here, or word of mouth among the well-to-do crowd, but for the money I would say no to the factory. If only I can convince my friends of this now!"
Joe M.,"Villa Park, CA",16,325,5,4.0,5/29/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has good consistency with the food at their restaurants.  This is convenient outside the Brea Mall and it is easy to park and get into restaurant.  Lots of choices in this area, but it is hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  There is usually no wait during the early part of the week at lunch."
