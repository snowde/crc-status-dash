Andrew C.,"Plano, TX",237,12,10,5.0,10/4/2014,"Not a bad place to get some great service and some great food! My girlfriend and I ordered some calamari and avocado egg rolls as appetizers and a few drinks (Stone IPA, Stella Artois, Passion Fruit Margarita) My girlfriend was getting a little cold and the lamp at our table was unfortunately not working. I asked two representatives if there was a way to get the lamp working. Sure enough, the lamp was out of fuel but multiple employees asked if we wanted to be moved to another table. (Great Service!) Our server checked on us multiple times which was great. Overall, great service and great food/drinks."
Nicole S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,2.0,10/2/2015,"Wow.  I looked on website that said they take reservations.  So i called to make reservation for an early birthday dinner. The person who answered the phone said they did not take reservations, except for the morning between 11 to 11:30am.  What a ridiculous policy.  I'll go to another place that doesn't have ridiculous rules for their customers. Unbelievable that lack of customer focus."
Brenda E.,"Fullerton, CA",44,4,1,1.0,12/4/2015,"Coffee served on a cup that is made out of glass and its chipped. Then there was a ball of white pepper in the clam chowder soup, then we get our cheesecake and the whipped cream tastes spoiled like a metal lSeriously #Cheesecakefactory.  After waiting manager was rude and it was the worse experience ever."
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,5.0,8/5/2015,Came here during their National Cheesecake Day Special and the service was amazing. The food was quite delicious as well. It was my first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory and it was most definitely a positive experience. I wish I remember our server's name because she was great. The new Salted Caramel cheesecake is absolutely amazing! I also really like the Chocolate Mousse one. The Avocado Egg Rolls are also quite tasty.
Elaine L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",102,16,4,3.0,1/2/2015,"Food and cheesecake is awesome, but not a very memorable service experience. seeing it as cheesecake factory, you'd expect to get decent service at a nice restaurant but my experience and mood was ruined by our waitress. no expression on her face, seemed like she didnt like what her job required her to do. she never replied with a ""you're welcome"" everytime we thanked her, NOTHING. i understand this restaurant has been very busy with new years coming up and employees can be stressed and tired out, but her actions are not acceptable. me and my family did not even want to ask her for anything bc we didnt want to deal with her.  the other tables around us were receiving very nice service and i regretted not asking to be served by someone else. i get better service at mcdonalds for crying out loud and no tip is needed. the only time we heard a thank you was when she gave us our bill because her tip depends on it. written as a heart around her name, it was assumed to be a girl named gabriella v?  AVOID GABRIELLA and ask to be seated somewhere else if you dont want your mood ruined. food and cheesecakes are amazing here though so +2 stars. our waitress gets ZERO"
Parisa S.,"Chino Hills, CA",154,4,,1.0,8/22/2016,"I have been eating at Cheesecake Factory for a long time and the last few times I have had terrible service. It seems as the waiters are overconfident and don't feel the need to write down what I order. Today I came with a few co-workers for our lunch. We were excited to eat at cheesecake and get an order of buffalo blasts. It took about 5 minutes for our server to stop at our table and say hello. After getting our drinks, we were ready to order our food. We ordered our food and still hadn't gotten bread for the table. It took about 20 minutes for bread to be brought to our table. At this point our food still hadn't been brought out and we had to find the server and ask him to check on our food. I had mentioned that we were on our lunch and didn't have much time left. The server quickly rushed and brought out our food however one item was missing. I flag down the server and ask where my order of buffalo blasts were. The server realized he made a mistake and claims that he had misunderstood us. At this point I am upset because I knew it wasn't a misunderstanding. I know what I ordered and it was not my fault that my food hadn't been placed. Though the manager ended up comping our buffalo blasts, which we were looking to actually eat them while sitting down, I felt that he didn't care that he would no longer be receiving the business of myself or my co-workers."
Cindy M.,"Covina, CA",93,21,23,5.0,11/24/2015,Awesome food and service. All restaurants get busy but they don't all deserve a low rating for that.
Pat S.,"Brea, CA",53,16,3,1.0,8/18/2015,"Very disappointed with the service and the mosquitos.  We sat down and the server shifts were changing and the server for that table was not there yet! We waited for 20 min. Before we had someone  come up to our table! We wanted a quick bite to eat and it turned out to be over an hour meal! We finally got a server and placed our meal and it took a other 20min. For bread! Apparently they did not have any bread ready! That is what the server told us! The food was ok but it took a long time! We sat inside by the glass that divides  the kitchen to the dinning room! I counted at least 10 mosquitos since we had been seating there for a while! It would of been nice to have a manager come over and apologize but no one ever did! I did see to managers when I was leaving, they were just standing there chatting instead of noticing anything in the dinning room! Very disappointed!"
Sydney T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,56,15,1.0,4/18/2015,"I go to Cheesecake Factory pretty often but this has been my first time going to this one. I have to say I love Cheesecake Factory but this has been the worst!  Got my usual Parmesan crusted chicken. The plate wasn't even hot it was semi cold and the chicken was bland. It didn't even come with the usual items. All I got was 3 pieces of sad looking string beans. The waitress was replaced in the beginning for us since the other girl went on break. She was a shorter Hispanic lady who was extremely rude when we asked her for refills of water and to have more bread. She attempted to say to us that they charge for extra bread but ""went to ask"" her manager and in gave us another loaf saying next time we have to charge you for it. Are you kidding me??! The worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Go to a different Cheesecake Factory if you are wanting to eat at one."
Anamaria J.,"Whittier, CA",8,25,5,4.0,8/17/2015,Michael was our waiter and he was a great waiter.  He suggested the salmon special and boy was it terrific.  I substituted the rice w spinach.  Excellent healthy dish.  But I made up w original low Cal cheesecake.  Yummy! Con cafecito! Oh ya.
Hank T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,72,3,1.0,9/13/2015,Took 20 minutes for our server to come. When he did show up he told us they are out of teriyaki chicken and wheat bread. Actually they are always out of bread when we come.  The person in charge of ordering needs to get on the phone with Sysco or US Foods and order extra. Not a good experience.
Wesley S.,"Corona, CA",0,25,11,5.0,4/22/2014,"The food is amazing, my all time favorite dishes are the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, chicken bellagio and spicy chicken jambalaya.  Recently, I was crazing a niche to try something new. It was a great recommendation from the waitress, Nikki Restaurants should be about the entire experience. Before you enter, introduction, recommendations, checking on your guest, etc.  Needless to say, I enjoyed my last visit!"
R C.,"Arcadia, CA",1,19,8,2.0,8/12/2014,"Always loved Cheesecake Factory, except this time!   Went to this Brea location on 7/20/14.  Waited at the front for a very very long time.  After seeing many people who came after us got seated (must've been at least an hour), my friend and I finally decided to not be patient and ask.  The girl at the front claimed that the buzz thing broke and would put us in right away - which turned out to be untrue! because at least 4 groups got in since and before we finally got a table. The bad experience did not stop there....  we only got forks, no other utensils; the server did not bother to ask what kind of side I wanted when choices were supposed to be offered with the main entree; when I asked her about it, she made it seem like there was no choice...the rest my brain has selectively chosen to forget so I won't hate Cheesecake, or perhaps it was the lack of energy...I was too hungry at that point to complain or to remember much. To be fair, the food deserved some compliment.  Anyways, Cheesecake probably won't care to read my review."
Sue I.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,16,6,5.0,7/13/2015,"Food was mediocre at best. What you would expect from a chain restaurant. The 5 stars however are for my server Tatiana. She was amazing. Very attentive and such a people person. If you're ever here, ask to be seated in her section. You won't regret it."
Hannah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",393,237,334,4.0,12/15/2013,"Its not often I go to a chain like Cheesecake Factory, but sometimes-- especially when you're deep in the suburbs-- there is nothing better! However, there are just some things that Cheesecake Factory does not do well... and that would include Bloody Mary's. We each ordered Bloody Mary's and they just simply were very depressingly bland. They tasted watered-down, with only a stick of celery for gnashing, the only spice it seems was the ""salt"" around the rim of the glass. Terribly disappointing! and not that we were looking for a buzz per se, on a Saturday afternoon following a couple hours of holiday shopping, but I'm fairly certain there wasn't any vodka in our glass.  Thankfully lunch made up for our bad drinks. Normally trying to find something to order at Cheesecake Factory takes me ages because the menu is ridiculously large and cumbersome. Its pages long, with way too many meals and styles and options listed. But after this visit, I'm sure I've found my new go-to meal, as it was SO INCREDIBLY GOOD::  the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp! A little mango salsa, black beans & rice, fried plantains! O-M-G this is it! I've discovered the best thing on the menu! The small-sized shrimp were spicy and tender, the mango salsa very mild. It provided the perfect blend of flavors a bit lighter in taste than typical Cuban food, although similar set up.  Our waitress was super friendly and provided great service. She told us that if we didn't like our drinks we could order something else, but we didn't bother hopping through those loops.  We ended our lunch, of course, with a slice of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Tangy raspberry syrup with lady fingers embedded into the cake & lemony cream cheese filling, it was so delicious, and the perfectly sweet finale to a great meal. yum!  Cheesecake Factory only gets 4 stars by me because I despise rating chain restaurants. But they are consistently good."
Meg T.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",80,38,121,5.0,7/12/2014,"Always great service, food is always well presented, in the company of great friends, how can you go wrong?!!!"
Amy S.,"Brea, CA",128,40,14,1.0,11/5/2013,"When we walked in, we asked for somewhere we could be seated with our stroller, as our daughter is barely 3 months old. The hostess acted as if we were inconveniencing her. They agreed to seat us outside after a little convincing.  We got seated outside on the patio and our waiter came up about 7 minutes later and said, and I quote, ""What do you want to drink?"" No ""hello."" No ""my name is ..."" Nothing.  He brought us our drinks and walked away, not a single word spoken. He comes back another ten minutes later and asks what we want to eat. Never were we asked if we wanted any appetizers, never were we told if there were specials etc. He never served us bread and we had to ask for it, even though we had bread plates sitting in front of us. And when I asked, it was as if I was inconveniencing him.  My husband asked if he could sub his fries for a salad and the waiter said ""sure"" and walked away instantly. Never did he ask what kind of dressing for the subbed salad or if we wanted anything else. He was so rude.  Maybe he was having a bad night, I don't know. What I do know is that I am a mother of a newborn and getting out is very difficult. We were friendly, I didn't expect to have such crappy service from such a normally great restaurant.  We ended up walking out...which is something we've NEVER done. We went to Lazy Dog where we experienced the exceptionally wonderful service we always get. I am not sure if we will ever go back to Cheesecake Factory after tonight. I also wish I would have gotten the waiter's name so this was a direct review of him and not of the restaurant...but that is not possible. Such a disappointment."
Nikki V.,"Bellflower, CA",91,73,55,4.0,5/27/2014,"My cousin and I came here after a day at the spa and were looking for something light in order to save room for some cheese cake. She had the pasta and I had grilled salmon, both from the lunch special menu and we shared the spinach and cheese appetizer. the spinach dip was bland but my salmon and steamed broccoli was actually very good as was her pasta and chicken. I can't remember the specific name but it was yummy.  We also shared a slice of blueberry/white chocolate cheese cake and it was heavenly. ill always be back for the cheesecake."
G.G S.,"Orange County, CA",0,305,,3.0,8/31/2015,"I love their cheesecakes, bread, and they have quite a good variety of decent food on their menu. Our experience was less than stellar for these reasons (which made me deduct 2 stars): Kid's corn dog entree was sent back because the batter was RUNNY. Hello, it's an egg based product--not safe to feed a child raw! Then it took  A LONG TIME for the kids' burger replacement meal to come out. Also, the chicken avocado sandwich came with a pile of lettuce, when the menu (which mentioned tomato) did not list. That really bugs me. If it's something you're going to pile on, say it on the damn menu, so I know to tell you I don't want that on there. The chicken was too lumpy and cumbersome, and just didn't blend with the sandwich. Then the thing that really bugged me was their HORRIBLE FRIES. Truly one of the very worst I've ever had in my life. SOGGY, SOGGY, SOGGY. Basically, rectangle shaped mashed potatoes."
Stephanie B.,"Murrieta, CA",28,132,24,5.0,5/18/2015,"We were told a 15 minute wait, and it was exactly 15 minutes. Our servers were quick and efficient. Our drinks never went more then half empty. Great food and the cheesecake was delicious. Even though our server was training another, our service never suffered."
