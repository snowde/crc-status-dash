Anthony D.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",90,36,22,5.0,5/16/2014,Very fancy and nice looking restaurant. Food is great and the cheesecake is always amazing here. One of the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to although the service isn't the greatest here. Waiters seem to be forgetful of drinks here at times. Other than that I love this place.
Krystle C.,"Chino Hills, CA",11,31,19,1.0,5/13/2015,"Watch out for a bartender (male) who also serves tables. I uses to work at cheesecake factory and up til now i love their food, its the best chain restaurant in the US so this review is not for the company but for that server guy, i didnt get his name (but i will & post it!).  So i had dinner with my daughter and younger sister, we got to go orders too so our bill was about 80$. I was server before so i tip good but i guess this server wants to make sure he gets tipped so he partially took money from my sister's gift card to tip himself, i gave 16$ tip but he added 10$ for himself, we didnt notice until we left because i was busy with my daughter. My sis and I decided to let it go and not call the manager because we know how hard it is to be a server. However i feel like people dont deserve that kind of treatment. So sad that people would STEAL from their guest, he made himself so low for a small amount of money."
Jeeyoung P.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,256,591,4.0,8/15/2012,"Remember, you can't make reservations Fri-Sun This time we ordered: -chicken soft tacos -avocado egg rolls -garlic noodles -fresh strawberry cheesecake avocado egg rolls-3/5 You fry an avocado, it's still going to taste delicious. But this tasted more like guacamole and there was too much cilantro for me. The sauce was very delicious, though. chicken soft tacos-4/5 I didn't like the tortilla, it wasn't soft but pretty hard. The chicken was flavorful and it comes with a side of orange rice..pretty weird. (with carrot slices) garlic noodles-4/5 My friend enjoyed this dish, you can order with either chicken or shrimp fresh strawberry cheesecake-5/5 Very rich and delicious. Gotta have cheesecake when you come here.  Our waiter was extremely nice, a little over the top. We had a nice dinner."
Liz O.,"Seattle, WA",678,808,67,4.0,11/21/2011,"Late lunches at TCF FTW!  No crowds, no wait, no complaints!  Seated quickly, and the waiter came for drink orders shortly after too.  Never been a huge fan of TCF, as my other TCF reviews consistently exhibit, but I'm tolerant and finding improvements here and there. Our waiter, Brady, made the experience very memorable with his quirky personality.  He knows how to entertain, and was able to adapt to our very eccentric and outspoken group.   Lunch portion salads are HUGE.  I only finished a third of my cobb salad. Fresh, tossed, and satisfying - nothing outstanding but I wasn't expecting it to be considering I ordered a generic recipe dish. Friend ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken (Asian dish) which had a sticky texture but enough flavor, and a slight kick to it - nothing unbearable.  ""Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple"" cheesecake had a strange flavor that I didn't care for on the first bite, but by the second bite it was much better. Dipping in the whipped cream is a must for me. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream cheesecake - (we shared, I didn't eat all of this on my own!)  Perfectly creamy and felt much lighter than the Adam's cheesecake."
Jake A.,"McMinnville, OR",53,101,,4.0,8/18/2015,Wonderful place. The tuna ahi is excellent.     The sausage pizza is good but a bit salty.   The service is good.
Trudee H.,"Pasadena, CA",2,13,12,1.0,11/9/2013,"Normally I'd have given Cheesecake much better rating,  But I'm only giving Cheesecake one star today because of the poor service I received from The hostess, Gabby, who was rude to me twice!  I let it go the first time but when she was rude to me again for the second, I was offended and had to address my concerns with the Manager, Cassandra, who was so nice and apologetic. Cassandra offered me an appetizer but I declined and told her that I wasn't looking for free food. I just wanted to tell her that I didn't appreciate being treated poorly and for her to train and address Gabby's bad customer service."
Carren Marie S.,"Anaheim, CA",318,189,131,4.0,7/1/2012,"Gosh.  If it wasn't for how busy this location was, I would give it a better rating.  Cheesecake Factories in general are just the smart restaurant to go to. Why? With such a big menu, everyone's happy. Not to mention, they seem to have healthier menu options too that are not only lower in calories but they are yummy as well.  You wouldn't even be able to tell that their healthier options. Much approved, if you can't figure out what to eat, have yourself go here and let the menu or the waiter choose for you. Literally."
Allison S.,"Los Angeles, CA",838,1082,1595,3.0,12/1/2009,"I know Cheesecake should be mostly uniform and standard since its a chain. I always find the cheesecake amazing-- my personal favorite being the white chocolate raspberry truffle. However, why do they put that much whipping cream? It's not only on the cake but the side too. It's just adding to its deadliness (which I suppose might be why there's two dollops; you're already clogging your arteries anyway so a little more won't hurt). I can never finish a slice by myself (especially after dinner), so it's best to share with someone. The reason I'm posting a review is because I've been to many of them-- SF Union Square, Marina Del Ray, and this one just doesn't seem up to par. Don't get me wrong, the service is outstanding and the atmosphere is great but the food is a little off. The jambalaya i got last time was seriously salty and the pasta in the chicken marsala that the BF ordered was not al-dente, even after we sent it back to the kitchen. We could taste the starch in the pasta. Good thing the crispy chicken costoletta (my favorite) is always good. I would usually give them a 3.5 to 4 but not at this branch."
F D.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2,8,2,2.0,7/3/2015,Good food but cautious  As great as the food is there are sometime service issues.   Most recently we were seated at a table where the booth was dirty and my daughter sat in some liquid and crumbs.   Makes me worried how many corners they may cut when busy.   Good food but be aware the staff seems to busy and misses details.
Sam A.,"Walnut, CA",0,22,,1.0,2/16/2015,Bad bad bad management  Dirty dirty dirty place Stay away  They don't care about customers
John L.,"La Mirada, CA",2,38,8,1.0,1/31/2015,"Service was horrible.  Our waitress, Britney M (blonde hair with glasses), only came to our table twice. Our food came almost 1 hour late after the table next to ours even though they ordered way after us. Plus, she messed up our order. My steak Diane came overcooked and mushrooms looked like little charcoal burnt crispies (cancereous, much?? And she just had a overall bad attitude. Unfortunately, nothing can be fixed about this place."
Juliet Rachel C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",946,350,691,3.0,10/6/2013,"The wait can really, really suck and I've also had below average service here on many occasions. However, for a typical American chain restaurant, the food is actually pretty good. For me, it's been consistently good. The interior designs and decor are ornate and lovely. I like how spacious and well structured this place is, too! It's just a very relaxing environment to be in, but the one annoying thing is that it's always really packed and really noisy!!  Ahhhhhh, I'm in love with their complimentary sweet wheat oat bread!! I can devour basketfuls of bread!! The other sourdough/white bread is just whatevers, but I'd die for the oat bread, YUM! I've had too many items on their menu to name, but I mainly like to order their pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and of course, I LOVE, LOVE their cheesecakes and the black out cake!! The cheesecakes have always been notably memorable to me.  Good place to go to for casual group dinners; wide variety of menu items, inexpensive & pretty good food, comfortable environment, plenty of parking, and of course, their cheesecakes!"
Amanda C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",20,44,16,4.0,5/8/2014,"I honestly love the Cheesecake Factory, and this location has friendly service. The good: -Food. I have tried a lot of the dishes here, and so far the only one I have not cared for was their Orange Chicken. It tasted too much like orange rind to me. Go figure. My ex loved it though, so maybe you will too. Portions are huge (and so are calories) so I usually take half home. -Menu. Lots of variety, and low calorie entree options. Nutritional menu available upon request. -Service: Always professional and friendly, no consistent problems. The bad: The main thing for me would be the calories. If you're watching your weight either come here on a cheat day or (do what I do:) order from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu and take half home for later. Otherwise, dishes are easily over 1000 calories. My favorite orders: Steak Diane and the Factory Chopped Salad. Favorite cheesecake: Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake Story time: Last time we came here, they were pretty busy, but I think something was also going wrong with the kitchen staff. Our food took a ridiculously long time to come out, at least 45 minutes for 2 entrees. Our waiter (I wish I could remember his name), was sincerely apologetic and gave us a couple free side salads on the house while we waited. We really appreciated the gesture."
Adriana R.,"Manhattan, NY",372,132,18,4.0,4/8/2015,"Easter sunday dinner with my good friend was swell! We sat at the bar and wanted to order a bottle of wine, but we wanted to taste some first. The server was extremely nice and let us try 3 diff kinds until we decided on a bottle. We then ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps.. amazing! I had never had their cheesecake, so I tried the original and it was very very good! Overall, as much as people complain about the overwhelming options at cheesecake factory, its a great option to have!"
Monica N.,"Alhambra, CA",395,673,443,4.0,2/20/2012,"If you must eat at a chain restaurant the Cheesecake isn't so bad. It's a testament to ever-widening waistband of America with it's high-calorie enormous portion sizes.  Save some money, save some time, save some calories. Come at happy hour. $5 appetizzers, $5 drink specials including glasses of wine and maybe take a walk in the mall afterwards you big ol fatty."
Christina P.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/13/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory in Brea is a great place to get gluten-free offerings for those with Gluten intolerances, but I will NEVER GO BACK because of the customer service and the food quality I received today as well as with the last 2 visits within the last 3 months.   After waiting for over an hour to get our food on all occasions, the wait staff was rude and unprofessional.  For this particular occasion, The bread on our sandwiches were sloppy and not toasted.  The managers were not compassionate and we were made to feel like it was our fault.  I am so disappointed because it's hard to get ""time"" back with family when it's lost to a horrible experience.  I really hope they get new management to fix their back kitchen and front service issues."
Eve F.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1,100,,4.0,7/9/2015,"This place has one of the largest menus I've seen at any restaurant.  So many choices. I especially like their small plates and appetizer menus. The crab wontons are heavenly and there are about 8-10. Also, their avocado egg rolls are wonderful.  Theirs is one of the best I've had. I enjoy having small plates or appetizers here because you get such a variety.  I've always received great service. Today was my friend's birthday and while I did not mention that to our server, she must have noticed anyway and brought her a small ice cream sundae with a birthday candle and a couple of the servers sang happy birthday to her.  That was special that they did that. This is one of my favorite places."
Maita B.,"La Habra, CA",1,14,,1.0,7/7/2015,Cheesecake Factory is HORRIBLE. Food is dry as hell and they don't give you free refills on your drinks.... I just think that is ridiculous.
Albert L.,"Pomona, CA",1295,573,1338,3.0,2/17/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory in Brea is like any other Cheesecake Factory (good service, nice decor), except for some reason there seems to be much longer lines in this one than many others I've been to (must be it's proximity to the mall). I'm always a sucker for the Pasta Da Vinci (penne pasta+chicken+madiera wine=drool) but most of the dishes there are good too. I would avoid any of the ""Asian"" food there if you're used to eating at real Asian restaurants w/ real Asian food."
Nicole A.,"Irvine, CA",376,6,225,1.0,6/25/2013,"This place blows. Seriously the worst service. I came here with 5 friends for dinner a few months ago on a weekday. Our waiter looked like he was around our age and had an attitude problem. It took almost an HOUR for us to get our food (I don't think it takes an hour to prep and make a couple orders of salads, pastas, burgers and fries, thanks). A table that came after us got served before us and by the time they were paying the bill, we were still waiting for our orders to be brought to our table & served. -__-   When I FINALLY took a bite into my burger, I realized it was cold and nearly spit it out. The fries were soggy. I would have been better off going to McDonald's and getting a Big Mac and fries, and would have been more satisfied.  When I tried food from other peoples' plates, I found the food to be disappointingly bland and just ""meh"". They should stop charging top dollar for subpar quality food, or maybe put the money they make from their overpriced food towards better training their servers to be more competent and less douchey. I would rather eat TV dinner or high school cafeteria food than consume anything from here ever again. Definitely my first and last Cheesecake Factory experience."
