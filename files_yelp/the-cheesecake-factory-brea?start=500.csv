Calendula M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,23,,3.0,9/10/2015,"Visited on August 30th at 3pm...between ""lunch rush"" and ""dinner rush."" The Brea location, however is jammed full of people at all hours of any day. Parking is tough.      First of all, the wait for a table wasn't as long as it looked like it would take. Good start. The food was four stars. (Too many choices!)  It's noisy inside, so it's not a place to go to chat, because you will have to scream, then duck your ear near their mouth to hear. But the waiter, was just stretched too thin. We waited 20 minutes to order. He didn't refill coffee, and we had to ask for creamer. He didn't bring ketchup for fries, or other condiments for other food. He could have saved himself from running around to fetch those things, if he had just brought them in the first place. I noticed that the table next to us was also asking for things like more salad dressing and soy sauce. We waited forever for him to bring the containers for leftovers and the check. He was friendly and polite, but was not a seasoned waiter who minimizes the number of trips to a table. Maybe if the they had a person for just refills? Maybe if they had ""waiter school"" for newbies? Maybe if they put sound absorbing materials on the walls and section dividers? Maybe if they routed diners waiting for tables in one area, and diners trying to leave go out through another area?  I really want to like it better, but there's a lot of room for improvement of the overall experience. The food itself is just fine."
Mike Y.,"Buena Park, CA",3,18,4,3.0,7/1/2015,Had the spicy chicken sandwich. It was dry and the bun seemed semi stale. Wouldn't recommend it. I'll try something different next time.
Mike R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",15,5,,1.0,7/1/2015,"Waited for over 30 mins for lunch to arrive. Said pasta bar was very busy?? Is that an excuse for slow service. I mean, I don't think it was any busier than it typically would be for a Wednesday afternoon. The food arrived. I had ordered a lunch special. Had wild mushroom soup that wasn't bad but the side salad was too drenched in balsamic vinaigrette and the chicken almond salad sandwich was way too rich and salty. Wouldn't recommend this  renees special or something. Had a Stone IPA also which was of course, good."
Jamileh S.,"Fullerton, CA",32,12,19,5.0,8/31/2014,"Great food, good service, amazing desserts and excellent drinks!!! Sat in their patio section and it was nice and relaxing!"
Steven T.,"Bothell, WA",16,15,5,3.0,8/21/2013,"Food is great as in all Cheesecake Factories but only reason not giving more stars is because service was a little snobbish, stand-offish. Especially the front lobby/host. Almost like, everyone is too-cool."
Joe V.,"Anaheim, CA",1,20,5,5.0,6/24/2014,"Great food, great service!  Stacey was our server and she was the bomb!  Thanks for making our anniversary dinner perfect! Ask for Stacy to be your server!"
Linda N.,"West Covina, CA",36,99,33,2.0,11/24/2013,"Giving it 2 stars because our pasta was delicious and my son liked his chicken strips.  Service was ok.  Went to the brea mall because we had an appointment with Apple and I was craving the chicken sun dried tomato pasta. Portion is rather large so my sister and I opted to share. Took our server about 10 minutes to grab our drinks. That was ok considering how slammed they were. Ordered our food and it came out about 20 mins later. Ordered my son the pepperoni pizza and the chicken strips because he usually loves both. Pizza was way salty. So we asked the waiter to take it off our bill because no one could really eat it. Service again was kinda eh, our glasses were always filled so that was great. Wasn't until the end of dinner where it got interesting. I decided to wipe my hands with some baby wipes and out of habit decided to wipe a bit of the table down, and yes if you look on my pictures posted that's what I got! Disgusting dirt on the table even after the hostess made sure the table was ""clean"" before us being seated. So yes ladies and gents we ate in that. Brought it to the attention of the manager and she explained that she does have the staff wipe it down org Lysol wipes and such which I think is a complete lie because it wouldn't look that way once we are seated. She then explained it was because of cars passing by the dirt gets on the tables. Pretty gross considering there was a party there before us and they supposedly wiped the tables down. Over all good food, but outdoor seating cleanliness no bueno. And the manager seems like a bull sh*tter to me."
April A.,"Fullerton, CA",5,8,1,1.0,12/26/2014,"I've always loved Cheesecake Factory but this time, they really screwed up. I ordered their ribeye medium rare and the first time it came out it was well done. The second time it was purple and raw. By this time, my husband was already done with his meal. By the time I got my steak, I had absolutely no sides or anything to eat it with at all. It was a terrible experience and I don't know that I would recommend Cheesecake Factory to any of my friends or family due to the inconsistencies. The staff was very friendly so this review is only about my meal."
Kevin T.,"La Mirada, CA",24,10,7,5.0,7/25/2014,"The service here is always good but was especially great with Stacey. She was always attentive to our needs and we never had to look for her or wait for anything. I recommend to anyone to ask for her station.  Now onto the food... I've had about 40% of the menu and I'm shooting for at least 90% but they keep adding new tasty items. My constant favorite is the chicken Madeira. You really cannot go wrong with anything you order and if it's not what you expected, you can always replace it with with something else. The management is very friendly and understanding.  The bartenders are usually swamped but try to keep an eye out for the guests wandering up to the bar. The mark west Pinot noir is a nice start."
Chloe S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,51,91,4.0,8/23/2015,Service at this particular CCF is a hit or miss but the food is DELICIOUS! Oh my...of course I will continue eating at not just this CCF but all CCFs because the food is just great and let's not even talk about their desserts...Chocolate Fudge cake a la mode...They are all yummy
Zuly R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",131,129,120,1.0,9/1/2013,"I hadn't been to Cheesecake for a couple of years up until last night, we celebrated a friends bday. Our group consisted of 8 people - relatively a manageable size I presume.  Service: Our server was definitely on something - we are still figuring that out. He completely creeped us out, but aside from that... really ""how many times do we need to ask for lemons?"" We asked for lemons for our water when we placed our drink order (ordered cocktail + water w/ lemon). To make a loooooong story short we asked him whenever he walked by (not that many times) & finally politely asked 2 other servers - very sweet lady who was always smiling brought them half way thru our meal. We should've initially asked her.  It took ""messed up hair spike here & there guy"" close to an hr to take our order & this is bc we kept asking & he would in return say, ""I'll be back give me a couple of minutes."" What really got him to FINALLY take our order was... My friends flowers were sitting there in the heat so one of the girls put them in the water cup. He saw this and freaked out... He lectured her & touched the bouquet saying it could spill nevertheless it fell right after he touched it. He went off on her (leaving us speechless in shock), he wiped spilled water off with my sisters dinner napkin & LEFT IT THERE ALL NIGHT. Then proceeded to say, ""Ugh... I'll just take your order now."" FINALLY!!!  Never did this guy check on us, he completely looked out of it & easily snapped. A whole cheese cake was purchased & he brought us HOT plates. When asked for a box for the cake - he came & left it on a chair. I mean he really went out of his way to make us not want to tip him - too bad gratuity was included. We didn't request to speak to a manager because we were there to celebrate a bday & didn't want to ruin my friends night but this guy shouldn't be working there at least not as a server."
Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,4.0,12/27/2011,"I've been here a couple of times before. Mostly to buy cheesecake, but I've eaten food here before too. But it's been so long since I actually ate food there, so I can only remember liking their clam chowder. The cheesecake, on the other hand, absolutely amazing!! I love love love the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The white chocolate shavings on it, is the best part!  I like this Cheesecake Factory, because it seems less crowded to me than the one at Huntington Beach. I recommend coming here for a nice lunch or dinner date!"
Wendy W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",206,12,9,1.0,5/7/2011,"Please bare with me, but today is my first YELP!  It's sad that it had to be a negative one. Don't get me wrong b/cuz of my star rating. Me, my husband, family and friends go to Cheesecake Factory all the time. I love their cheesecake variety and or we go there to just chill and hang out for drinks or dinner. BUT, where do I start but to say, OMG! There was a small thin piece of metal in my husband's ""California Cheese Steak!""  He took his second bit and to his luck he chewed right onto it. I have to admit that doesn't sound like the most pleasant thing to happen but I'm glad he didn't end up swallowing it. He made this funky noise while chewing and the next thing I know, he's trying to spit it out immediately. We both looked at it and was was trying to figure out what it could possibly be.  It was shiny, slightly edgy, thin piece of metal. Now, of course we are NOT going to continue to eat this sandwich because who knows what else could be in there or even where that piece came from. So, we told the waitress to take it back. She was a actually a sweet thing and apologized and seemed fairly concerned and apologetic to the situation. The kitchen manager also later came over and acknowledged that he was addressed of the situation and apologized that this had happened to us. And that we would not be charged for that sandwich. (Cause there is no way I would be paying for a sandwich that was barely touched, not alone finding a piece of metal in it) Which later asked that we can fill out a form of the situation.  Which is all good because he was doing his job and I can understand it's all protocol. But, as a customer's perspective I don't feel they really cared about finding out how it got there or at least making us feel reassured that they would investigate on it so that it would not happen again. Which is a bit irritating cause I would be worried about why is there bits of metal in food. Or at least reassuring the customer at least. Instead their only response to us was, ""I'm sorry to hear that this happen to you. We are shocked. Fill this out form so there is a record of it.  But, I don't know where this could of come from. Because, it couldn't of come from our kitchen.""  Paused with a few secs of silence and looking at us like we could of possibly known where it came from.   Now, this is where I am HEATED about the whole thing. Throughout the remainder of our meal, Me & my husband noticed that many of the host or either floor managers basically watching us eat. I literally felt uncomfortable to even finish my meal. I felt as if we were being observed because they were starring at us in groups of 2 or 3.  As if we planted the dang metal piece. Or as if the answer would magically appear by watching over us. Now, seriously... we just wanted to be acknowledged and concerned for by telling them what happened to our sandwich. Instead of having a fun Friday night watching the game, getting dinner, drinks & dessert. I felt as if they just wanted us to leave so the situation would go away with us.  I think we were quite good customers.Overall we didn't complain, get mad, or give the kitchen manager or the waitress a hard time about the metal piece. Other than just tell them to please take it back. However, it seemed like we were suspects. Seriously!!??? Over a sandwich we barely touched or ate?  Now the whip cream to the 'cheesecake' (excuse the pun). As, we were leaving I went over to the hosted table to ask for a business card. Now this isn't shocking. But, it happens to be that all people watching us eat were all gathered together in hosted area. As if they were waiting for us to leave.  What a coincidence, that the kitchen manager and I am assuming the floor managers happen to merge all together as we were exiting. When I asked for a card, 1 gentlemen replied. Sure, let me get you one. While another gentlemen sharply snapped at me, ""IS THERE A PROBLEM?!!!"" Now, if you can hear the tone. It was intense and rude! As if I was an obnoxious customer causing a scene or causing trouble from the beginning. Come on. I was just asking for a business card. Based on that remark alone and the attitude through the remainder of my meal. It was HORRIBLE!  I don't wish it upon any other customer. Seriously, that experience shocked me! This is why I am 'Yelping'... for the very first time! Crazy as it may sound, though their food and environment is nice to hang out. Seriously! NOT WORTH the customer service provided by the management tonight!  I rather paid double somewhere else to get dinner or drinks than to feel like this.  WARNING TO ALL THOSE THAT GO TO THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION!!!!! If you have a problem with your meal. BE CAREFUL, they probably thinking your scamming out of it. EVEN when u barely touched it!  I didn't enjoy my meal or my time there one bit! Most unsatisfying meal. Now, I'm glad we took a picture of it to see it more clearly. Now, I can share it.  WHERE DID THIS COME FROM??? WHAT IS IT???"
Lillian F.,"Anaheim, CA",14,15,204,5.0,1/6/2015,Steak Diane was amazing.  We had ordered 3 appetizers that didn't get to our table on time.  They gave them to us for free.  Very nice of them.
Sara p.,"Yorba Linda, CA",7,19,46,2.0,2/26/2015,"Sheilas Cashew Chicken Salad's name has changed and avocado has been added. You'd think the avocado being added is a good thing? But... the cashews have shrunk, more like mini and fewer cashews :( Also the chicken portion is lots smaller. Why add a good thing when you will have to skimp out on other areas? I used to love this salad. Hopefully I just got a bad batch."
S G.,"West Covina, CA",0,10,,4.0,4/11/2016,"Always good food, good drink, and great cheesecake. The chicken picatta has always been my favorite for so many years. I've been fortunate to always receive great service. And you can never go wrong with their cheescakes. The dulce de leche cheesecake always a winner."
Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",638,502,122,4.0,8/11/2013,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory -- I personally think everything is amazing here. Go during lunch though, it's so much cheaper."
Andy B.,"Walnut, CA",2,15,,3.0,4/29/2015,"I have been to this location many times. None of them memorable.  This last time I got the factory burrito grande.  Despite being a ""wet"" burrito it was extremely dry. It didn't help that 80% of this massive burrito was rice filler. The service was pleasant but a bit slow.  Cheesecake was good. Overall it was just an OK experience."
Victoria B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",4,3,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Last Saturday I had the worst experience at Brea Mall Cheesecake Factory. I went their with my family and I never felt so disrespected in my life.    The serves was so poor it was ridiculous. Out waitress was so slow with everything and she had a face on her the whole time like we were a bother. I order a $17 pasta that was so small it look like a kids portion. I called for the manager to come look at it and when she did, age just rolled her eyes and walked way. The day before I had ordered a similar pasta at BJs which was five times as much. I will be going back to BJs. I don't know if I'll be back here"
Ivan I.,"West Covina, CA",94,4,3,1.0,1/1/2016,"So... where do I start. We get here for a party of 5 and they get our name wrong. I asked to make sure that they were not calling us. The hostess said nope not us. Well we waited, they ended up giving our table away to someone else. We being so hungry we told them the next available table. We got sat outside in the cold. Well when they sat us down  they offered us bread. We ordered some appetizers and waited patiently for our bread. The appetizers came and no bread. I had to stop another waiter and asked for bread. I asked for lettuce on my hamburger and got cabbage!, cabbage?! WTF ON A BURGER?! My nephew got fish and chips. His batter was raw. He ate it because he was hungry but said something after he ate half of it  He never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything. I know they are busy because of the new year rush, but man I have not had service this bad in a long time. Don't come here when they have a rush."
