Heather N.,"Anaheim, CA",39,164,59,1.0,10/24/2015,"I was craving cheesecake and their  Portabella mushroom  zucchini and avocado fries so decided to get my craving fix.  We came around 3 o clock for a late lunch early dinner.  The wait was only 5 minutes.  We sat down and ordered our food right away.   We ordered 3 waters,  the zucchini fries,  jambalaya,  Farfelle with shrimp and miso salmon with green beans instead of rice.   We also asked her for wheat only bread.  Our waitress walked away giving us a weird look on her face so I just figured maybe no one ever asked for wheat only bread.  She brought out our water and my friend was trying to make friendly conversation with her but she was not having it.  She walked away and didn't come back until our appetizer came out.  While enjoying our appetizer we notice she was coming around asking the other tables how they were doing and refilling their waters.  We waved her down asking for more water.   Sometime later she came out with the food.  The jambalaya was super dry but our waitress was no where in sight.  We waited and waited but not one time did she come by to see how the food was or if we needed anything so we could not ask her for extra sauce.  After a while when our other food was semi eaten I had to waive a different waitress down and ask her for more sauce.  By the time the sauce came out we were no longer hungry and just politely asked her for the check and the dessert menu we were going to order dessert to go.  She brought us to go boxes which really surprised me as from my last visit there I remember they usually box everything up for you.  I figured no problem she must be busy .  While I was boxing up my food to go I noticed that she brought out another tables leftover food  boxed up for them.  This is the same table that she was constantly checking up on.  Maybe she felt like the other table with older people would tip her better verses a younger Asian table.  I'm not sure.  I was very disappointed and don't feel like the mediocre food that was dry and horrible service was worth coming back."

She made this experience so pleasant, I hope to return & hope to have her as our waitress again.  Thank Q. Lisa. You made our visit memorable. Can't go wrong with avocado egg rolls for the appetizers.  Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane was the bomb!!! Low carb cheesecake, yes low carb, was delicious!!!"
Joey M.,"San Dimas, CA",378,10,6,5.0,3/10/2016,"Tonight will mark my 5th time ever attending The Cheesecake Factory. I was very pleased from the walk in to the walk out. Our app's were great, except for the calamari... There is to much sodium added.. My main course the Salmon herb crusted what have you. All my friends were also pleased. But to get to the real reason I am reviewing this place is because something special and magnificent caught my attention. Anabel the sweetest most precious waitress... Person I have met in a long time. This wonderful, positive, and selfless woman has inspired me! I am happy to know that people like Anabel are in this world. If you know Anabel than you know her story. It takes a strong strong woman to be doing what she is doing not only tonight but the rest of her amazing life. She is such a blessing to be around! Thank you Anabel! Keep your faith and never loose sight of your future! God bless you and all your family!! The Cheesecake Factory is lucky to have you on their team!!"
Lisa P.,"Fullerton, CA",1,31,5,5.0,5/6/2015,"Had dinner here last night. Service was amazing! From our host to the waiter, they were so pleasant and helpful. They have a great SKINNYLICIOUS menu and it tastes really great! I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Assorted Veggies ($17.95) and my fiancé ordered the Steak Medallions ($15.95). We also ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (MY FAV). Everything was really delicious and flavorful even though it was a ""skinny"" menu. The entrees were under 590 calories which is really nice. It also came with fresh bread in the beginning, which I didn't touch because I'm trying to stay away from carbs. However, we did order the red velvet cheesecake and I took a bite out of courtesy. Honestly, it was just a-okay. But then again, I'm not a dessert person and really not a cheesecake person - so, I guess that means it's not bad. Overall, great experience and the prices were fair."
Andres S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,39,32,1.0,6/11/2015,One star for good service .. The food was terrible . salad was brown. Fettuccini was watery and the chicken Romano looked  as thin as a tortilla .. Will not come back... No good ..
Jeffrey C.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,18,1,5.0,12/5/2015,"Just left this place .. If you ever want to go ,recommend going in the evening got seated in less than 5 mins ... The food is awesome server by the way can remember her name but never the less she was good and it was polite how when she was leaving she introduced the incoming server , although everything was good the thing I hate the most is the small ass tables they have , I guess that's not going to change so no need to review that lol but The best part about the night was the red velvet cheesecake the best dessert have to try it"
Steve C.,"West Covina, CA",8,10,6,5.0,5/3/2015,This place is really nice to go on a date or with the family the food is really good the plates are really big and they have a good presentation they have good drinks I'll recommend this place to anyone
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3239,810,14322,4.0,2/25/2013,"Cheesecake Factory. Reminds me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but instead of candy, they make cheesecake. There's 3 things you notice immediately about the restaurant. VARIETY, GINORMOUS PORTIONS, and of course, CHEESECAKE. Some people talk mad smack about this restaurant chain but I can't say that I remember having a bad experience unless the wait was too long. That usually happens in Marina Del Rey, Redondo Beach, or Newport Beach.  Maybe, it's because these locations are more touristy than the others or cause it's an upscale neighborhood. Whatever the reasons are, I enjoy the restaurant as well as their decently stocked bar. Recently, I also visited the Grand Lux Cafe in Las Vegas and got this weird feeling of deja-vu. They're sister restaurants from the same company, but that's another day, another review. Here's what gets my taste buds going when I visit the Brea location. @ Bread - wheat, white, and don't be shy about the butter. @ Boston House Salad - Boston lettuce, chopped bacon, egg, blue cheese, croutons, tomato, and of course, RANCH dressing. Basically, it's a cobb salad and sometimes I add chicken. @ Chicken Madeira - Sauteed chicken breast, asparagus, melted mozzarella cheese, covered with mushrooms and madeira sauce, and mashed potatoes. I soak the white bread into the madeira sauce and drag it around the plate. I've tried other versions of the Chicken Madeira at different restaurants and it just doesn't compare. @ Bistro Shrimp Pasta - Crispy battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato and arugula, tossed with spaghettini and basil garlic lemon cream sauce. I smother the dish with tabasco sauce. YUM! @ Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon - Salmon with lemon sauce, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Simple, clean, and my choice before a night of drinking debauchery. This dish just digests well for me cause it's not heavy or oily. @ Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - How can you turn down this classic dessert? They're starting to promote this SkinnyLicious Menu with dishes that have fewer calories, but with the same familiar taste and I just disagree with that. I'd rather order something on the original menu and then work my ass a little harder at the gym. Save your calories elsewhere, cause I really don't get the point."
Edwin C.,"La Habra, CA",0,25,2,5.0,4/29/2015,I always get the same thing every time I go; The Steak Diane. Can't go wrong with that. The steak is always tender and juicy and the mashed potatoes are amazing. Usually I'm too full for a cheesecake so I just grab one to go on the way out. I was just here on 4/27/15 and everything was great.
Linda P.,"Stanton, CA",81,73,8,1.0,7/27/2014,"I've been to many different cheesecake factory restaurants before, but this location is probably the worst I have ever been too. The utensils were extremely dirty. All of our silverware were crusty and a couple of them even had dried food on them. The food is always good but for some reason 2 out out 8 of our food were missing ingredients. One of the salad came without dressing! The service was terrible. We were ignored and our server checked on us only when she brought out our water and took our order. She never came to check up on our food or ask if we needed more bread, or more water. I won't be coming back to this location."
Christina A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/27/2015,"The Italian sandwich, the unappreciated sandwich on the menu, but ever so delicious. Couldn't even manage to take a picture; I just dug right in. Forget all the Italian sandwiches you've had this one was amazing. I couldn't believe all the flavors. How could I miss this on the menu!? Delicate yet fresh and cool with prosciutto and all the delicious Italian delicacy  meats served with the juiciest tomato and a marinated veggie of some sort that drips down. All served on artesian bread. It was perfection. Even the waiter mentioned how everyone forgets this item on the menu in the sandwich section. You can find the picture online on the restaurant's site. Make sure to have fries with it,  especially worth the extra dollar for sweet potato fries. Superb!"
Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",149,145,371,4.0,3/27/2011,"Diverse menu, huge portions, but kinda pricey. I love munching on their complimentary bread (sourdough and wheat) while waiting for the food. My favs... - Roasted pear & blue cheese pizzette: pecans, arugula and caramelized onions on a mini pizza. A sweet & savory snack! -Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic: bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. It usually has great depth of flavor but past 2 times it has been kinda watery and bland =( -Renee's special: 1/2 sandwich, soup, AND salad. Really good deal!  I get the chicken-almond salad sandwich with their soup of the day, and caesar salad for $1 more. Bread is buttery and toasted. The chicken salad is delicious and flavorful. The caesar salad is well dressed and my favorite soup so far is their clam chowder (usually on fridays). Huge portion! -Caramel chicken and kobe burger are my boyfriends favs.=p Oh and don't forgert to save room for dessert!! It's called CHEESECAKE factory for a reason! My favorite is their WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE! Raspberry swirl cheesecake with a cookie crust and topped with shaved white chocolate and whip cream. DELICIOUS! I always try to save room for this dessert. Service is usually good. Place is busy during lunch and weekends, so plan accordingly. Ambiance is nice and low-lit at night. Good for a nice lunch with friends, sit down dinner, or date =)"
LaReina M.,"Whittier, CA",3,34,19,4.0,2/23/2014,"We went here yesterday for my moms birthday, and my sister arrived 2 hours ahead of time (2:00pm)  just to let the staff know a large party was arriving soon, so when everyone arrived at 4:00 they STILL made everyone wait 30 minutes because they said they weren't ready. Which was unacceptable due to arriving 2 hours ahead of time for a no way dinner.  Other than that, dinner was amazing! We had two waitress's to take care of both sides, and the waitress's was soo nice! I wish I caught her name to recognize her on here, but she had short hair like a bob cut, and super sweet! Very attentive! The orange chicken was great, my husband got the filet miyong (I don't know how to spell it) but he was in heaven! Excellent Restaurant Other Than The Wait, Amazing Food!"
Neville T.,"Chino Hills, CA",87,22,30,4.0,8/9/2014,"So we went on July 30th, which was National Cheesecake Day, and it was moderately crowded. With that said, our party of four was seated fairly quickly, in around 25 minutes.  The food was what you would expect from a Cheesecake Factory, enormous portions that take a while to finish. The Jambalaya Pasta is really good and really spicy. Also, we ordered the Shepard's Pie and Seafood Gumbo and both those looked really good as well. For dessert, I went with the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which is what I always get. I recommend getting whatever cheesecake sounds good to you, because I'm sure that all of them are good. Unfortunately, the waitress we had (who's name slips my mind), was kind of slow. And she wasn't only slow for us, she was slow for the whole section of tables that she was serving. A total of 2 hrs passed from when we were seated to when we left because of the slow service. The time it took to get the food out was really long, but we had the free bread so we were satisfied. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite ones near by and I will most definitely be back."
Laurie D.,"Whittier, CA",0,13,4,5.0,4/2/2016,Fantastic dining experience from beginning to end. Our waiter Greyson awesome in his expertise and knowledge. His recommendations were awesome. The dessert was suburb per usual.   Had been a while since we had been there and will make a point to come back again soon!
Mike M.,"La Habra, CA",13,40,75,4.0,11/15/2014,"OK...the wait is always an issue at the Cheesecake, no matter what location...so it's a given...let's jump to the entrees. My wife had the shrimp scampi, which was crisp and a wonderful blend of garlic and pasta! It will be one of her favs over here. I had ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo!! Not too spicy and very flavorful. A California twist on the New Orleans dish. I think I like the jambalaya just a bit better. Either dish makes a nice meal. OK, I do need to mention the warm sour dough and Indian bread and butter is to die for!!!!"
Mark V.,"Fullerton, CA",110,82,71,3.0,1/19/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, consistent quality and good service. Way too friggin crowded - but I had a gift certificate. And really, the cheesecake really is pretty great. Parking at the mall blows in the weekend."
Elesha N.,"Newport Beach, CA",676,143,337,4.0,12/15/2011,"Not a fan of chain restaurants but I did enjoy myself at the Cheesecake factory. Friday night, 25 min wait. I ordered ""Evelyns favorite pasta"" which was Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts. It really delicious!! My boyfriend ordered herb crusted salmon that came with a Delicious Lemon Sauce, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes. Not overcooked or dry... but cooked perfectly !! Favorite things bout this place: LARGE menu! Pastas, Pizza, Entrees, Vegetarian options, vegan options, Steaks, Seafoods, sandwiches, milk shakes, desserts ect! Overall, good food with no complaints and good service= romantic date night!"
Violet G.,"Orange, CA",10,332,12,2.0,2/9/2014,"Service started out great, but then our waiter disappeared for 45 minutes or so.   The new Loaded Tater Tots were ok, but not great - they are made of mashed potatoes, and the texture was a little off.  I had a salad, which was good except for the random bits of ingredients which did not belong in this particular salad - tomatoes, endive, etc.  The waiter apologized, but did not offer to take it off of the bill.  My husband had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken; he said the pasta was good, but had some sort of additional ingredient... perhaps a little chili pepper?  The chicken was very fatty.  We had a slice of chocolate raspberry cheesecake, which was good; it would have been excellent with a little more of the raspberry component."
Lorena C.,"La Habra, CA",0,6,4,5.0,6/7/2015,"I love the hot chocolate its the best, I highly recommend  it with the desserts. An the service is really good avery member of the staff are very friendly."
