Anna W.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",353,176,1171,4.0,1/27/2011,"I love the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake!!! It's definitely my favorite cheesecake. I started going here for years, but only for cheesecake. It wasn't until recently that I had lunch here, then dinner, then dinner again. So I guess now I'm a regular. haha I actually been to over 6 different cheesecake factory, this one is pretty average.  I still think their cheesecakes are much better than their food, but the food is not bad. Just a few of my favorite cheesecake are: White Chocolate Raspberry (of course), Fresh Banana cream cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo cream, Oreo cheesecake, and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Yumm.... They really are the only place to get such amazingly unique, rich, and amazing cheesecakes. As for their food, I really like the Cheesecake factory in Arcadia. I was disappointed by the food in the one in Westwood. As for this one, it's pretty good. I like to stick to the stuff I know they are good at, which is the Chicken Madeira and mushroom (their most popular dish, the one they sell most of), Crusted Chicken Romano, and Crispy Chicken Costoletta. For some reason all their specialite dishes are all chicken. So I guess if you're in the mood for chicken and cheesecake this is the place to go. I also had many of their salads and pastas. The salads are pretty good and really big. The pastas are a hit and miss, sometimes it's really good, but most of the time it's too dry or too salty. Really this place is best for desserts!!"
T C.,"Newport Beach, CA",187,207,197,3.0,8/10/2011,"Holy Calorie Counter!! I used to be a fan back in the day, but then I got a whiff of the Calories per meal, and got scared straight!!  My favorite dish the Pasta Carbonara comes with a whopping 2,130 calories per serving! Whuuuaaat?? I've decided to find a new place to hang my hat when it comes to eating...  I guess the portions are large or something like that, but 2,130 really?? Wow! I used to get the petite filet so maybe I should stick to that?"
Mary N.,"Los Alamitos, CA",475,1627,1012,3.0,9/24/2011,+ good ambiance + yummy selection - server (Sloan) wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to want to be bothered with refilling glasses.  + however the rest of the staff was very friendly
Gabby B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,2,3.0,3/22/2015,Love the cheese cake factory! But at this location the service is not always consistent and it seems to be not as well maintained as others that I have been to.
Seham A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",15,13,7,5.0,1/1/2015,"Great service from our server Charles C. Came in on 1/1/15 and it was extremely busy with customers in the bar section. Heard the customer at the table next to us giving our server a hard time. After ease dropping (lol), we applaud our server on how professional he handled the situation. We will definitely be back because of the exceptional customer service that Charles delived to our table."
Thomas S.,"Fullerton, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/21/2015,"The food is great, but  they need to bring back the amazing Mediterranean Mahi Mahi! The service is solid, but needs to be a bit faster and attentive."
Eli M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,44,25,4.0,1/20/2014,Never had a bad experience coming here...food is always consistent and service is usually great.  My faves are the arugula salad as an appetizer with the chicken marsala as the main course. Just came here for a birthday dinner and the fact that they dress up your dessert for your b day is always a nice touch...
Nam N.,"San Diego, CA",664,852,1291,4.0,12/26/2010,"I know foodies hate on chain restaurants....but I love me some Cheesecake Factory---and I'm not afraid to admit it! :) Of my top favs are the Chicken Madeira, Chicken Piccata, Cajun Jambalaya, their complimentary bread, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake....and they can serve up some delish cocktails. They are infamous for their GINORMOUS portions---but for someone who loves leftovers, I'm definitely a fan. (Granted, what I bring usually lasts me at least 2 more meals!) But if you come for lunch, many entrees come in half sizes. And yes, those are still on the larger side. Sure the wait for any Cheesecake Factory can be ridiculous but we usually call in orders for take out. And with the curbside feature, you don't even have to get out of your car to deal with their crowded lobbies! This was extremely clutch when I grabbed some lunch for my family during the crazy torrential rain storms last week. Quite convenient. NOTE: This location's curbside pickup is alongside the valet booth."
Katherine W.,"La Habra, CA",16,231,52,4.0,8/23/2013,"This central mall location seems to keep this place pretty busy. On weekends, you should expect at least a half hour to an hour wait for a table. If you ask to be seated outside on the patio which is very nice, you can get seated sooner than indoors. They also have heat lamps on the patio when needed. Warning, their food portions are HUGE! My husband and I like to share the crispy chicken costelleta which is basically a pounded thin chicken breast breaded and drizzled with a creamy lemon sauce. It comes with 3 portions of chicken, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Leaves room to enjoy my favorite Snickers cheesecake!"
Adele L.,"Huntsville, AL",6,132,102,4.0,9/9/2013,"Kahlua cheesecake is the best! Jambalaya is the worst... oily, hyper-spicy, but flavorless. A complete waste of a menu item, when you could order instead the sublime Wasabi-crusted Ahi Tuna. A magnificent sushi-grade steak lightly seared. No fire in the wasabi, which actually made it taste better. Silky perfection! Brown rice is an option, and it is cooked and spiced just right."
João Mateus L.,"Fullerton, CA",122,4,1,1.0,2/24/2016,They don't accept driver licenses from Brazil to prove you are over 21. The state of California accept it as a valid document and they don't... bullsh!&t!
Porsche C.,"Fullerton, CA",222,229,74,3.0,3/31/2011,"I like to come to this place for happy hour.  For $30 you can leave this place drunk, full, and with left overs.  The appetizers are under $5.  I like the buffalo blasts.  They are basically spicy chicken and cheese in batter fried won ton triangle.  The sliders are pretty good too. On a non-happy hour outing, I like the pasta bellagio.  It is linguine with a creamy basil pasta.  The portion is large enough for two people.  The service is friendly.  On the weekends, be prepared to wait."
Tom Y.,"Fullerton, CA",6,7,1,3.0,4/9/2014,I have been here with my friends Waited around 30 mins and  I ordered pasta and it was quantity over quality.  Don't know why ppl rave abt it when the taste is overall mediocre.  Not worth coming here again.
Sandra S.,"Buena Park, CA",0,17,4,3.0,2/5/2016,"I'm not sure what's going on at this CF, but the last 2 times we've been here the service has been pretty bad. 2 different servers have had a bit of a tude and were not friendly. I'm not sure if they're just overworked, but I was pretty bummed, the place isn't cheap for that kind of service. Food was great though, so there was that!"
Kevin L.,"Fullerton, CA",383,154,7,5.0,9/25/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory. You'd think a chain this big would sorta suck, but nope. Never had a bad meal here. I'm a huge bread + butter guy and I eat at least 3 baskets here each and every time. My go to meal is the Four Cheese Pasta made with spaghetti noodles rather than their tubes, and ask for extra extra cheese. If you love cheese, you can't go wrong....ever...with this pasta. Save room for dessert :) Yepp, Im a glutton when I come eat at Cheesecake.  Definitely approve. -Goodfood.LA"
Hanz L.,"Placentia, CA",308,356,70,4.0,3/31/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is really a surprise.  A chain franchise... good?!? My recommendations are as follows: -Pick or customize a pizza you like.  Make sure to opt for honey wheat bread. -pasta -jambalaya I remember watching food network and learning what chicken piccatta was for the first time, and so I decided to give it a try at Cheesecake factory.  Boy was I glad I tried it at cheesecake factory.  It was so good I wanted more.  I went to some of my favorite other branches such as Mimis and the chicken piccatta there was terrible.  Give it a try at Cheesecake Factory!"
Anthony S.,"Santa Ana, CA",24,3,1,2.0,3/30/2014,The spicy cashew chicken on rice sounded promising however such a huge let down with the chicken soiled in over salted spices it did nothing but overwhelm the plate it's a definite no for me next time. #disappointed
Mateo C.,"Whittier, CA",15,28,8,3.0,9/29/2015,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday with my family. We were a total of four people. This location is always a zoo. There are so many people here that it's hard to actually relax. The hosts need a better plan to organize the chaos of waiting for a table. The hostess who took my name offered us a seat outside because the wait was shorter. I figured it was a nice day so I agreed to that plan. Five minutes later she ""whispered"" my name to alert me to my table being ready. If I hadn't been standing next to the host desk I would have missed my table. We were escorted out to the table and sat down. The first thing we noticed was that the four appetizer plates were FILTHY. It was like they hadn't been washed at all. We quickly asked for new plates. None came. We finally went to another table, looked at the plates there to see if they were clean and grabbed them ourselves. After 15 minutes waiting, the busboy came with new plates and was embarrassed to find we had handled problem number one ourselves. He left. Our server came to the table and introduced himself. He was a fairly nice guy but he was on the quiet side. He took our drink orders and then gave us a few moments to decide what we wanted to order. When he brought our drinks out some minutes later, he asked if he wanted bread at our table. I would think this should be a given. We waited a few more minutes for bread to come and we reviewed our menu to order. Again the server was kind enough. Not Mr. Personality but kind. He took our orders and we waited for our food. The food was average. I had mentioned that I was celebrating a birthday but no birthday recognition was given. I don't expect a hundred dollar bar tab but a free piece of cheesecake or plate of appetizers or cocktail would have been appreciated. I generally like Cheesecake Factory as a rule but I couldn't help but feel disappointed this time. I am hoping that in future visits the service is more exemplary and that the dishes are clean."
Arthur D.,"Irvine, CA",1,136,6,3.0,3/26/2015,Great service.  Decent food.   Wait to get seated was way too long.
Sherri F.,"Lincoln, NE",0,5,,1.0,9/6/2014,Manager called me to discuss issues promised a gift card not that I would go back which we still haven't seen. Clearly customer concerns are not taken seriously.
