Kaylee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,104,27,4.0,12/10/2013,"I used to hate Cheesecake Factory but it's grown on me recently. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could because of one particular incident (I explain it in the lat paragraph). I like that it's always open late and the food is consistent. If you're starving and want a decent pasta or burger, this place is awesome. The smokehouse burger is sooo good, though the fries suck. The Louisiana chicken pasta is always good here! I've been to other locations and it's either too oily or too bland. This place makes it with just enough cream and flavor. The service here is generally pretty good too. And hello! The squaw bread (brown bread) is to die for! This location is also a lot bigger and nicer than some other ones (like the Katella one).  So why 3.5 instead of 4 stars? We had one meal where our waitress was rude and never even came to take  our orders. She went to the table next to us 4 times without even glancing at our table. We addressed this issue with the manager who was really nice and offered us dessert. we asked the manager for bread which took 20 minutes to bring out  even though we asked her directly! And the waitress never apologized, but she started being more attentive and acting like nothing happened. I also didn't  appreciate that the manager didn't assign us a new waitress even after we had issues with our first one."
Jen C.,"Ontario, CA",27,353,65,3.0,1/8/2013,"I came here with friends for dinner at around 7pm and it was packed! We were seated around 8 but this was on a Friday night. It's weird that they have a large menu yet they only have one soup for the day, which is what I ordered. I had the Clam Chowder in a bowl. My dish actually came out last out of the 5 dishes that came out. And the guy serving it, couldn't hold the bowl still so the soup kind of spilled onto the sides of the bowl and his finger was touching it and yet they still served it to me. Anyway, the clam chowder isn't the greatest. I've had better. I also ordered the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. This was really good but I couldn't finish it since it was too rich for me. Our waitress was nice. She came by often and asked if we needed anything else. I think it's best to go here when it's not as crowded and save some room for cheesecake."
Johnson L.,"Manhattan, NY",331,532,169,3.0,2/6/2011,"My experience here has already been meh. The first time, the food was not so great and the service was wonderful. This time, the service was horrible and the food was soso.  The Cheesecake Factory reminds me of BJ's, just fancier. Honestly, I really do not like how it is so dim and poorly lit in the restaurant. It is literally so hard to see anything (which makes taking pictures and everything blinding) and it just ultimately bothers me. I got the Farmhouse Country Burger and my girlfriend got the Bistro Pasta, both of which were really good, but our waiter was totally MIA and did not deserve that gratuity tip. Funny is that they had ads on their menus."
Cameron L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",49,14,1,5.0,7/20/2014,First off! Lemme say WOW! My baja tacos were amazing!! The side dish was delicious as well! Waitress was against ordering the red velvet cheesecake (she said it was dry) I ordered it anyways and strongly disagree! I ate the shit outta this red velvet cheesecake! It was amazing wasn't dry at all! I would order it again!
Elizabeth K.,"San Clemente, CA",45,33,,3.0,9/16/2014,I've gone to the cheesecake factory a lot. It's usually great. This one wasn't my favorite. I went with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law who has a new born. We called ahead when we were five minutes away hoping they might take that into consideration but they didn't. We asked for a sling for the carseat and never got one. Our waitress was good. We all have allergies and wanted to make sure what we ordered was ok she didn't come back to tell us she had talked to the manager and that all our food was safe until after our food got there. Usually they are more communicative about what's in it and letting us know we are good to go. When our house salad came we got a huge pile of mixed green (spinach little green leaves etc.) 2 tomatoes and 2 cucumbers. Seriously?? The rest of our food turned out great. We didn't have any problems with our allergies but not our greatest experience.
Carla C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",32,3,,5.0,2/10/2016,"I love this restaurant, they always have great service and very tasty food. I love their four cheese pasta the most"
Bing T.,"Fullerton, CA",48,52,,1.0,10/9/2012,I wanted a pina colada after gf was talking abt the drinks she had at a wedding so we came here since it was on our way to the mall. Big mistake cause it tasted like the bartender forgot to add the alcohol.  Tried the reeses peanut butter cheesecake on the bartenders recommendation and it was ok. Bill and tip was 24$ too expensive if you ask me. Gf was feeling sick so she just had a diet coke.
Rho L.,"Chino Hills, CA",4015,1071,1568,4.0,9/11/2010,"I'm surprised I had never written a review for cheesecake factory amidst all of my calorific meals here. The one downside is the wait for a table, and the wait when you get to your table. Now that that's outta the way..... The food here is consistently delicious. One of my must haves is their avocado egg rolls. So crisp and velvety all at the same time. texture overload. Oh and that sauce that accompanies it -- sweet and tangy. what a perfect compliment to those eggrolls. Their bread basket is awesome. Simple yet such a butterylicious way to start a meal. And I use lots and lots and lots of butter. Side note, their rib eye is flavorful, marbled goodness.You gotta try it. On a recent visit, I had the chicken madeira and herb crusted salmon comb with mashed potatoes for $19.95. What a freakin rad deal, especially since I spent the first 15 mins agonizing over what I should order. More often than not, I'm usually pulled in a tug of war between two items i really want to try.  Thanks cf for letting me have both. Serving was a nice large portion, tons of mashed potatoes. In fact it acted as a barrier in between the fish (and its butter sauce) and the chicken (and its wine sauce). Both were very good, but I wasn't too fond of the sauce the salmon was sitting in. It was completely drenched that it took a bit away from its texture. Still great though, finished everything. I've tried many many variations of their famous cheesecakes and of course have my favorites. Dulce de leche, tiramisu, white choc mac nut are all fatteningly yummy. Had the red velvet once and that was monstrously yummy.  I haven't had a dish here yet that I didn't enjoy. The one cog in the wheel is definitely the wait time...otherwise, always a great eating experience."
Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,3.0,10/5/2012,"Came to this location for the first time to get my beloved bistro shrimp pasta. Can't bring myself to try anything else.  After a 30 minute wait we were seated. We sat in the circular part next to a window.  The view  was really nice.  The bistro shrimp pasta wasn't the best I've eaten. But it was still tasty. What disappointed me was the lack of arugula in the dish. The Arcadia location topped it with a bed of fresh arugula. But the best came from the Anaheim location.  But still it satisfied my craving.  Our server was this nice  young blond girl. We had a couple of issues and she informed me that she was still fairly new. My daughter had the child pasta with butter and Parmesan.  I knew something was wrong when baby girl asked for my food.  The bow tie pasta had a hard texture and seriously lacked flavor.  Had this before way better.  Our server replaced it with spaghetti and marinara.  Baby girl was then happy and gobbled up her food.  We also had to replace her Shirley temple drink.  She said it taste like medicine.  I tasted it and it did taste medicinal.  Because of my server's inexperience we had some trouble getting my cheesecake order right.  I wanted the Chris outrageous cake. She thought the Craig outrageous carrot cake.  We even looked at the menu together.  Still was handed the carrot cake.  She  was so nice and was trying so hard,  I didn't want to complain again.  So I paid my bill and went to the cheesecake counter at the front to exchange my desert.  The manager was called over and I explained the whole situation. She gave me the correct cake and graciously let me keep the carrot cake! Wow! I emphasized that the server overall was good. Would come back when in the area."
C L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,34,34,2.0,12/21/2015,"I had dinner here with my godparents and in the beginning everything was good. Our food was delicious and the environment was wonderful. When we got our check, i was surprised at the amazing price and of course i fought for the check so i paid without even paying attention to what we got charged for. As we were walking out, i got stopped by our server, Leah. She told me she gave me the wrong check and asked if she could fix it. I was confused but i waited and she brought me a different check than the one i paid for. First of all, i wasnt happy about being given the wrong check and second of all, she charged me for two cranberry juices without disclosing that it wasnt free for refills. She asked my godfather if he wanted more cranberry juice and he said sure. I felt deceived that she didnt tell us we would be paying for two. Servers should be honest and disclose if there are additional charges or fees. Also, i told her i needed a voided receipt for the wrong check that i paid for. She takes my credit card, charges me for the correct check, makes me wait 10 minutes, then comes back and tells me she cant give me a voided receipt until the other party pays for their bill. I tell her i will wait. Then she goes and takes other tables orders and ignores me for about another 20 minutes before coming to me and giving me the voided receipt. I did not get any compensation for this error or any of my time wasted."
Eko K.,"Fullerton, CA",124,120,243,5.0,7/1/2014,"Off course the best thing about cheese cake factory is their cheese cake. Their foods is awesome too. Try the miso salmon, shrimp sandwich and crab cake."
Brittnee S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",76,27,40,4.0,7/31/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is huge!  Very spacious, yet cozy. I went with my co-workers to celebrate a birthday. We each ordered something different: Tuna tataki salad (mine! It was super yummy, they give plenty of fish, and big tomatoes!)  Alfredo Blt And some kind of penne chicken, tomato pasta. Everyone loved their food! The staff is very knowledgable and friendly (I let our waitress know it was someone's bday) they brought out the cheesecake and sang her a happy birthday! Super fun! Now the cheesecake...was interesting. We ordered the red velvet cheesecake. Wasn't a big fan. It was really sweet and decadent. They were both great...by themselves. I prefer the original cheesecake with berries. But that's my preference. I have to say their whip cream...is killer! I'd def go back and I really want to bring the hubby next time!"
Anthony S.,"La Mirada, CA",14,13,,1.0,1/7/2015,"Last year in  holiday season of 2013 I went twice. The food is overpriced. The second time I ordered I ordered with a group. My food did not come with the rest of my friends orders. The waitress asked if I wanted a drink or appetizer in the meantime, I said, no. Halfway through my groups food my order came. It was overcooked. I was upset. My order had originally gone to another table. I wrote to the manager. He responded in an email which he wanted to speak with me. I replied with my phone number, no response. I will never go there again."
Jacob O.,"Whittier, CA",28,6,,4.0,1/3/2015,"Really great food, waiter service, very accommodating. Excellent for birthdays, dinner dates, or if you're just in the mood for some really good food."
Gordon L.,"Ottawa, Canada",12,56,2,3.0,10/14/2013,Was seated next to kitchen and the noise was almost unbearable due to dishes being constantly flung on top of each other.  Waiter seemed bored but remained attentive.  Food all came within reasonable time except for a side which got lost for a while. Beer was trickling down the sides of the glass. Good food and excellent cheesecake as usual. Certainly not a bad overall experience but could have been better and not to its usual high standard.
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,3.0,3/4/2011,"Yeah.. I felt like I was in Hollister. ANYWAYS, went here for my birthday dinner. let's just say, i was hoping it'd be better. The food was just a-okay. the ceasar salad isn't that great, i've had way better. everyone in our group had something different, the only thing that stood out was the bread that they give you. its BOMB, but other than that, i don't care for this place."
Shannon S.,"Fullerton, CA",10,87,155,5.0,9/20/2013,"Fortunately, there is no waiting at this hour~ its about 6pm, Thursday.   I generally like the food here.  For three (ladies) of us, we ordered 1 appetizer of Asian Lettuce Wrap Tacos, 2 main dishes of Steak Diane and Tomato Basil Pasta, 1 Strawberry Cheesecake for dessert and 2 beers and a lemonade at $ 75.00.  Portion was perfect and food was excellent.  I would highly recommend this place for a simple meal and/or for a special occasion~"
E K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,88,53,2.0,10/20/2014,"Very disappointing. The lunch special fettuccine alfredo (~$13) was served on a dirty plate and the portion was tiny. The alfredo sauce was watery and tasteless. The factory burger (~$12) was mediocre and the bread was so hard it was difficult to chew into! I ordered it with sweet potato fries ($1 extra) which was topped with too much salt. As desert, we got the pumpkin cheesecake... Which was still frozen."
Ashley H.,"La Habra, CA",36,55,21,2.0,10/19/2014,Every time I got there some thing is always wrong with the food. Quality is very hit and miss here when it should be superb. If you happen to get a dish prepared correctly it can de wonderful. Other wise your in for flat chicken pounded to paper. Good luck.
Cupcake V.,"Anaheim, CA",57,110,40,3.0,10/27/2010,"3.5 stars:  Friendly staff and nice looking place. The menu is way too big not to have photos of the food and cheesecakes. It's a book full of advertisements, which is really strange and a bit overwhelming. It bothered me so much that I didn't bother reading the menu and just ordered a small beet & goat cheese appetizer salad, which was good, but nothing special. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake was sinfully delicious. I loved the mascarpone mousse filling. I tasted a bit of my friend's 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which was also fabulous! Very silky and perfectly sweet. I will go back when I have more time to linger and actually read the menu."
