Kevin K.,"Fullerton, CA",12,14,1,5.0,7/17/2014,Server was a great help in choosing the food! Chicken costoletta was AWESOME! the server also recommended to get extra sauce on the side which was great advice. really happy today :D
Japen G.,"Anaheim, CA",182,402,559,4.0,7/11/2012,The menu is still very overwhelming but I am quite impressed with their efforts to provide lighter meals and a good selection for lunch portions. The Lunch Pasta I ordered was the Pasta Carbonara and it was delicious.  I totally enjoyed each bacon filled mouth full of pasta.  But I know my heart wasn't too happy because this pasta was loaded and was just a hearty slop of goodness.  They used a thin noodle pasta almost angel hair pasta.  The pasta had an oil based sauce that was rich in flavor and wasn't creamy.  So when you look at the pasta it looks deceiving because it looks light.  But once you stir the pasta a bit you start seeing all the goodness that was at the bottom start to mix and all the bacon dancing the tango on your plate. I am still not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory because of the usual wait you would encounter especially during weekend dinners.  But going here for lunch on a weekday was pretty painless.  We waited no more than 5 mins before our group of 6 was seated. I was quite impressed by the food and service this time around.
Tessa C.,"Anaheim, CA",19,216,401,3.0,7/23/2013,"I ordered the Chicken Piccata off of the lunch special. The chicken was tasty, however the lemon sauce was nonexistent. You really can't mess up mushrooms,so not much to say on that.The capers tasted quite salty,which the angel hair pasta needed as it was plain.  Several friends ordered the  Chicken Madeira and commented that it was really good.The Fettuccine Alfredo looked good as well."
Allen S.,"Irvine, CA",158,71,4,4.0,5/30/2013,"Ya I know, it's your standard chain restaurant. The menu is actually a BOOK of items. But I have to hand it to the staff ... they have to know everything on that menu ""inside and out"". My hats off to them with huge amounts of respect. So with that ... the food. You know I can't always remember what I ordered to talk about it in this review .... because I'm ordering from a BOOK. :)  Hands down .. one of the best cheesecake dessert menus to order from ... I think. I get through the meal just so that I can order the dessert.  This particular Cheesecake Factory restaurant on the outside patio in Brea was great! I loved our server she was awesome and gave great attention to us in such a way that she made me and my girlfriend feel very special. Oh ya and the food was good."
Vivian P.,"Brea, CA",0,17,1,4.0,1/10/2015,"I love this restaurant! I have enjoyed everything I've tried here and they have many options for those with food allergies. I recommend the burger or pasta for those with gluten free diets. The wait time is usually pretty long but I find that it is always worth it. Why don't I rate it 5 stars? It is pretty loud, but it's not unbearable. It's the waiters. While, I have had mostly good experiences, I have had some rather bad ones. A few of them are just plain rude. Most recently, my food order was taken and then the waitress walked away. Without taking my drink order. She came back a few minutes later and said ""You didn't tell me what you wanted to drink"". I was thinking ""well that's because you didn't ask and walked away!"" Overall, I would recommend it but watch out for some of the waiters."
Bonnie R.,"New Orleans, LA",10,60,48,3.0,12/1/2014,Good for a chain restaurant.  Had the chicken madiera which was ok. The arugula salad was small but good. The make-to-order guacamole was supposed to be medium spicy but really had not much taste at all.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the cheesecake!
David C.,"La Mirada, CA",85,59,34,5.0,11/2/2014,This place has great service and really delicious food. A must try is the Fried Mac and Cheese Appetizer!! We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday.
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,3.0,4/6/2010,"Cheesecake factory is comfort food for me.  I know what to expect and I know I will get cheesecake for dessert. Road Side Sliders:  4 bite side burgers on mini buns served with grilled onion, ketchup and pickles.  They are actually pretty tasty. 3.5 stars. Red Velvet Cheesecake:  my first time trying red velvet cheesecake.  It is actually pretty good.  3.5 stars. 3.5 stars!! Cheesecake Factory is yummylicious!!"
Julie G.,"Brea, CA",0,13,,5.0,12/29/2014,"Love love love Cheesecake factory my favorite restaurant food , drinks, service always fabulous!!!!!!"
Jenn L.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,22,,4.0,6/19/2013,"I've only really had a few of the same things from here but that's because they never fail to disappoint me. Beginning with the wait - depending on when you arrive the wait can range from being seated right away to an hour for a party of two. They don't allow you to call ahead to be placed on the list nor do they allow reservations. Weekend dinner time is usually the most packed.  The complimentary bread - they give each table three rolls (usually two wheat, one sourdough). The wheat bread is by far better than the sourdough, in my opinion but I will still eat the sourdough. They come with butter as well.  Stuffed mushrooms - pretty basic. Six mushrooms stuffed with herbs. They're simple but we order them almost every time. They're fairly reasonable for $3 worth if I remember correctly.  Buffalo wings - we usually get mild. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan but I don't really like them. My boyfriend loves them so it's not that they're bad it's just like I can't seem to acquire a taste for them. And they're about $9 so pretty pricey for buffalo wings to me.  Side of fries - completely random but there's just something about their fries that have us ordering them with our pastas every time.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - the one and only dish I order here. It's honestly not that spicy and I love that they include yellow and red peppers along with asparagus. Their chicken is pretty good but if possible try asking to replace the chicken with the Louisiana chicken (it's kind of like fried chicken) but it's not overwhelmingly huge. The lunch portion is well worth getting if you're not too hungry but I usually opt for the regular.  Jambalaya - my boyfriend always gets it with pasta (you can get the option of rice instead). The chicken is always more tender than the chicken in my pasta so I like to steal his. The shrimp is cooked just as well as the chicken. During the past few visits, though, we've noticed that there isn't enough sauce so we've had to ask for more on the side. They're usually nice about it do don't hesitate if you feel like you need more sauce. This is definitely a must try.  The Cheesecakes - I've only had the Tiramisu and Original and I will definitely pick the original all the time. I felt the tiramisu was too sweet and basically full of cream. It didn't taste like a cheesecake, it just tasted like foamy sweetness. The original did not disappoint. It was perfectly creamy with just the right amount of crust. It's always hard to order a piece of cheesecake considering their pastas are pretty large in portion but the cheesecake is definitely worth trying!"
Cheryl J.,"Brea, CA",0,13,1,2.0,12/28/2014,So came in here not knowing what to expect after hearing what friends had to say about here. There portions are tiny and the food is not even good and there prices are ridiculous. The only good thing about this restraunt is the employees. The staff here is better than any other restraunt but thats the only reason why i gave them two stars.
Leila H.,"Fullerton, CA",1,4,5,5.0,11/14/2014,Had margaritas at the bar excllent. Ordered guacamole with  tortilla chips very good. Husband had Tuscan chicken nicely done great service. Slays enjoy our visors here.
Joo Hye L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,7,1.0,12/19/2014,"It was the worst cheesecake factory I have ever went. I ordered spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and there was no chicken. Not even a half of the piece. The pasta noodle was really hard to chewing. It was like a left over food from last night. Horrible!!"
Lily T.,"Orange County, CA",19,299,2463,2.0,12/26/2012,"Quick and simple, but the darn crowd!"
Sophia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,289,5,5.0,12/18/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place ever since I stepped foot in here as a child!!!

Hanz W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",201,231,81,2.0,8/19/2012,"Cheesecake factory is more for tourists, visiting friends/family, hs dance dinners, business luncheons, or celebration of some sort.  They don't specialize in any particular fare, they have more of a sampling variety of all sorts of cuisines, so more like a little bit of something for everyone.  BJs, Cheesecake factory, Claim Jumpers, OG, Yardhouse, etc etc big chain restaurants. The namesake section is a tiny little section near the front entrance that most people just stare at while waiting to get seated.  For a place called cheesecake factory, I'd probably support more of a cheesecake theme mixed into all their dishes somehow.  Like if they took that cheesecake and turned it into a smoothie drink. Anyhooo, got a Meatloaf dish with mashed potatoes and a corn/squash hash sorta side.  The meatloaf was astoundingly bone dry and I didn't want to ask to send it back because it took a really long time to get so I just asked for several sides of gravy to douse the meatloaf with.  In addition the mashed potatoes while plentiful was provided with like 3 spoonfuls of gravy.  I ran out of gravy in no time and had a whole mound of gravyless mashed potatoes, so again, asked for more gravy.  Might as well give me a pitcher if I need to properly balance the sauce/food myself. The worst thing about being seated in a corner is that other servers won't walk by so if your server disappears for prolonged periods or comes to the area but serves the table behind you and next to you and doesn't even glance at yours and leaves, then you are SOL.  I do prefer high traffic seating just because the likelihood of your server being less than attentive is decent so if someone else can help you, you flag them down."
Carlos K.,"La Mirada, CA",0,15,,1.0,5/23/2014,"The worst service for the second time out of three times I have been there. This is the last time I will eat there. Went there at 4 pm waited 10 minutes for a waiter, he came by, took our drink and food order then we waited 10 minutes for water. I saw our drinks on the service bar sitting there for 10 minutes. Finally went up to the waiter and shift manager and asked for our drinks. The shift manager came up and apologized and said that there were only three staff (boo hop). People that came in 15 minutes after us got their food before us. Guy came up and said that he was the owner and apologized and said that he was going to take care of the check and later brought us a piece of cake (not cheesecake) that we tasted but didn't like. Pissed off super by this time. Asked for the check and paid $42 for three of us. Obviously he didn't pick up the check. Having managed major restaurants before, he was not the owner but a bad general manager.  Don't eat at Cheesecake BREA. BAD, BAD service. Used to be good but they have gone in the toilet. BTW, they screwed up my food order on top of all of this! Too many other choices in the area. BJ's, CA Pizza, islands, yard house, taps, etc. Even kabuki."
Lyndsey D.,"Walnut, CA",0,16,,4.0,1/4/2016,"I got the red velvet cheesecake To-go and it was delicious. The cheesecake was very moist and satisfied my sweet tooth. The only thing I would change is the amount of cream cheese that is in the cake, I wish there was more red velvet."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,2/14/2012,"This is a beautiful location just next to interstate 57 on Imperial in Brea. Excellent parking as its next to the Mall. Well lit interiors and always has a crowd.  My wife ordered fire cracker salmon rolls, CRISPY TAQUITOS have Spiced Fresh Salmon Rolled in Spinach and Onion, Served with Fried Crisp in Wonton Wrappers a Sweet Hot Chili Sauce. This may be the best dish in this restaurant for 11.95. We had FRENCH COUNTRY SALAD has  Mixed Greens, Grilled Asparagus, Fresh Beets, Goat Cheese, Candied Pecans and Vinaigrette taste is very good if you add olive oil on top it becomes delecious. Enjoyed this and it fills you up. This is not a place to order burgers as you will regret it, I did so on a previous visit and had to leave the Burger as is. We also had Chicken taco wraps. Enjoyed the Lunch on Valentines day."
Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, CA",947,1248,244,4.0,2/28/2010,"Mmm... cheesecake factory.  i go for the food, not the cheesecake. yes, it was crowded -- there was a long line.  but i went to the bar area and got a table within 5 minutes.  maybe other people don't know that you can go to the bar area and be served the same food.  the service was fairly good also.   love the brown bread and sourdough w/butter.  tried the fire-roasted artichoke appetizer today which was pretty good.  had 3 halves of artichoke (don't ask me why it wasn't just 2 or 4...lol) with two dipping sauces (one was a garlic aioli, the other chipotle).   my fav dish at cheesecake is chicken madeira.  juicy chicken breast w/cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus served with madeira sauce.  yummy mashed potatoes that i crave.  i usually split it with another person. no dessert cuz we were full.  quite satisfying.  =) if you complain that it's pricey, maybe you should eat less (and don't order a drink -- water is good for you).  the portion size of one meal is good for two people (especially if you have bread and an appetizer).  sadly, i have seen people eat TWO entrees by themselves w/appetizer+bread (namely at the marina del rey location)...no wonder obesity is such a problem... great place to have a meal after the brea mall closes.  heheh.  note: my fav appetizer is the avocado eggroll.  i even have avocado eggroll buddies, but decided to try something different today."
