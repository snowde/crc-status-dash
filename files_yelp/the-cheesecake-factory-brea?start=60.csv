Jailene G.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,86,108,3.0,7/23/2017,"Maybe it's just today because normally I love Cheesecake Factory. But our meal was subpar compared to those I've had at the Cheesecake Factory in Victoria Gardens and Americana. The Margherita pizza I got was not put together well. I wish I had taken a picture but there were several slices that had nothing but sauce (no cheese or basil at all). And the crust was about 1/3 of the pizza itself. Also got the green salad with balsamic and a lot of the leaves were way too big. I shouldn't have to cut a salad. The Salted Caramel Cheesecake was ok, nothing special. And the spinach and cheese dip was pretty good (wish it had artichokes tho)."
Anne D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,,5.0,11/12/2017,"Took my mom here for lunch yesterday and we had a great experience. We sat at one of the high top tables in the bar area after speaking with the very nice hostesses at the entrance. Our server was sweet and attentive (wish I had caught her name - I think she was also tending bar if that helps. Just want management to know how great of a job she did). Overall the service was excellent.  Drinks: Mom and I ordered mimosas, which were refreshing and tasty. It seemed like they were prepared with fresh orange juice, which made them even tastier.  Food: We ordered the tamale cakes, the Thai lettuce wraps, the ahi tartare, and the stuffed mushrooms. The tamales were our favorite - so flavorful and delicious with a little kick to them. The lettuce wraps are a classic appetizer here and great as usual - I love the array of sauces and fillings, and the chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The tartare with fresh avocado was scrumptious. Mushrooms were awesome - loved the sauce they were in - though they were a bit on the small side. Maybe I just wished they were bigger because they were so good! (On a side note, kudos to the staff for having to remember and be trained in such an extensive menu! I worked in bars and restaurants throughout college and grad school so I know how challenging this can be. I'm always impressed by the staff's knowledge and recall whenever I come here.)  We *almost* ordered cheesecake but we were just too full. Standing favorites include the Reese's flavor, the classic strawberry, and the pumpkin pecan when they have it.  My family and I have always loved this particular location and have never had a bad meal or a bad experience here. Some of the more critical reviews seem to have been written by people whose expectations are kind of ridiculous (like coming in with a huge party on a Saturday night and expecting to be seated and served immediately) or people who have no awareness of or appreciation for how it works behind the scenes at a restaurant. It's not always an easy job (okay, getting off my soapbox now).  Keep up the great work and we'll see you again soon!"
Tracey C.,"Placentia, CA",173,35,222,1.0,11/17/2016,"We went in very late after a movie around 10:30 pm. I ordered an ice tea and the rim of the glass was broke in 2 places, unfortunately I figured it out by dragging my thumb along it. I got a price of glass caught in it but I was able to pick it out with a tweezers. The staff promptly brought me a bandaid and a alcohol prep. OUCH! I ordered the Vietnamese shrimp rolls appetizer because I missed lunch and dinner and almost wished I hadn't. The noodle was cold and hard on the outside:( Unfortunately, I had to use the restroom. The restroom was a mess! The trashes were overflowing and the sink vanities had dirty water all over them. There was toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor. Out of four stalls there wasn't an ounce toilet-paper unless I wanted to get it off the floor. Toilet seat cover it is....... We have come here several times in the past.  I would say around 30 times at this time of night and this was the first time I ever had such a horrible experience. The waitress comped my iced tea. Thanks. Maybe they can use the saved money for some toilet paper and janitorial service."
Tony L.,"Anaheim, CA",69,158,184,3.0,12/28/2016,Not a big fan of chain restaurants. But Cheesecake is a solid restaurant for the price. The portions are so large that you get 2 meals for the price of one with all the left overs you will be going home with.  The free bread is the bomb and service is always good. But the restaurant is huge and feels like you are in a cave.  The meatloaf dinner is a must but they got rid of the best item on the menu I thought. The Po Boy Shrimp Sandwich! No longer available. I think they took that away years ago. That's how long it's been. lol
Mara C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",800,100,102,5.0,10/2/2016,"How did I jump from 2 stars to 5? Well let me tell you something, Cheesecake Factory's customer service department was astonishing. They seriously took my review seriously and instead of being petty about it, they decided to make it right. This was actually about a month ago when it happened, so mind you I'm a bit overdue on this updated review.  I was messaged by Craig from Guest Services who apologized for the last incident that occurred when my boyfriend had food poisoning. They sent over a letter explaining that they would look into the situation that last occurred and after a few days, sent me an electronic gift card to make it up to us and give it another shot. I don't know how they figured it out but my boyfriend happened to be in town that exact week and so I took him to dinner with the gift card before he left back home to Vancouver.  This time around, the food didn't disappoint and Neal's tummy was feeling just as good as it was when he took that first bite at Cheesecake that evening. I sincerely appreciate the time that Cheesecake took to make our experience better, knowing that sometimes things can go wrong in the food industry. I would honestly recommend my friends and family to them especially seeing that they do care about their customers.  Thanks Craig!"
Kristi N.,"Yorba Linda, CA",18,36,5,5.0,5/3/2017,"Went here last night for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. They must have changed their menu. They had a lot to choose from and an entire menu of healthy options. I had the Korean Fried Cauliflower that was in a sweet & spicy sauce and OH MYYYY was it good. We also tried the Chicken Samosas, which were really good and my boyfriend had the Teriyaki Chicken which he loved!  We were so stuffed we didn't have room for cheesecake. Next time!"
Will G.,"Brea, CA",46,61,298,1.0,6/24/2017,"Late decision to meet up w friends at Cheesecake Factory. It's been a while since I've stepped into one of these.  It was CRAZY BUSY - but the wait was less than 20 minutes.  I was sat at a booth, which I didn't like - big guy and need a little extra room - and waited all of 15 seconds to be sat at another table. AWESOME!! Waiter is nice but I'm guessing not very much of an active listener. Told him twice to please bring lemon w water. I'll try a 3rd time.  Sat at a table then my friends decided to sit at the bar - so I moved. Usually I wouldn't cause I rather sit and have conversation but I'm good.  Ordered Chicken Pizza Style and after almost 20 minutes - was told they were out of it. My whole party ordered it and so now no one was getting it and its the ONLY reason we all showed up.  So we decided to order the Chicken Romano - which I'm told is almost the same thing...which then asks the question, Why can't they make the original? Maybe the kitchens frustrated.   The Chicken Romano was fine. It looked like it was simply thrown on the plate in a fit of frustration. Finally, in all honesty it was nothing to really write home about. I'll say this...the pasta was cooked well for a chain restaurant so that's the plus.  When the bill came - and after waiting next to several dirty plates as the person next to me left and the area was never bussed by either the bart beer or the bar back (but they had time to chuckle and giggle - not so much as the iced tea was comped for the trouble.  You would think that even after they knew that we had waited over almost 30 minutes BEFORE we were informed they had run out and then waited even longer to get the food they would make some sort of gesture other than simply saying - I just found out we are out of that dish.  But, this is what happens when chain restaurants get so big they don't fee they need to pay attention to why people eat there and what customer service is all about.  Like I mentioned before - it had been a long time since I stepped into a Cheesecake Factory...I guess I was right to stay away.  What started as a pleasant experience quickly became a bad, but salvageable, experience - that wasn't salvaged.  I do hope you folks start paying attention to what is really important when people CHOOSE your restaurant to dine at - and stop taking your customers for granted.  If this is your choice to dine at - the menu is WAY BUSY - but the food, if they don't run out  is pretty good.   I'm obviously bummed about the experience and so my Star count reflects it.  There are better places to go where the service is good and the customer service is excellent - find and frequent those places. You'll experience what a good dining experience actually is. Take care.  Happy grubbing!"
Angie O.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,18,8,5.0,10/28/2017,"Cheesecake  service  I love the overall ambience ... even though my sister got an allergic reaction to their chicken bangbang.. other times we went, it was good."
K C.,"Walnut, CA",16,27,5,1.0,5/8/2017,"We always come to this Cheesecake Factory and always have a good time. But today's review is for their dessert and our waitress.  I always order the black out chocolate cake every time I come. When it was placed on our table today, the cake looked completely different than before, the portion was half the size and they DEFINITELY changed the recipe. It no longer tastes the same at all. Instead of having more cake, it's just layers of chocolate cream and fudge that's super sweet.  I wasn't complaining or anything I was just so shocked that the cake looked and tasted so different. But our waitress (Kara) immediately starting defending herself and saying that corporate changed everything and it's none of her business. I didn't even say anything directed at her, but as a waitress if you see that your customer is so upset with something, you really should be more kind or try to see if there's something else you can do about it.  And when I was still debating if I should ask if there's something she can do about it, she came to our table and just said ""let me get a box for you"".  Overall I just didn't feel welcome or accommodated by our server at all. She was not approachable or helpful. I really wish I could've returned that cake.  Also, CHEESECAKE FACTORY: Bring back the old Black Out Chocolate Cake!!!!!!"
Fred K.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,37,16,1.0,6/21/2017,"Not happy with our take out chocolate tower cake.  $10 For a 1"" slice.  I saw the cake cutter sliced a small piece and put it aside.  I thought they were getting to a fresh part of the cake.   Didn't check the seal box.  I got home my wife was upset on the half slice of cake we took home.  After spending 150 on dinner, and getting cheated on half a slice of cake just made the dining experience. SAD."
Kristina K.,"La Habra, CA",169,13,13,5.0,7/8/2017,We ordered the Chicken Maderia and we needed to be done in an hour to go to the movies at Brea Edwards. Stacey was a Excellent server and had us done in 41 minutes just in time! On a Saturday night! With The Best Customer Service! Thank you Again for helping us be on time!
Richard R.,"Whittier, CA",1,35,22,5.0,2/4/2017,"Cheesecake Factory Brea is  .  My family and I went to dinner on a Saturday night and although it was packed we choose ""first available"", we were seated within 15 minutes. (5 stars already)  Our server (Daniel), was kind, knowledgeable and friendly.  Our food was well prepared, we'll presented and delicious.  We will certainly be returning.  Thank you CCF Brea"
'Tyra R.,"Fullerton, CA",53,1,1,3.0,12/4/2017,I love going here with my family. My favorite is the chicken Marsala and the tamale cakes they're both so good
Michelle S.,"Chino Hills, CA",20,166,843,4.0,2/26/2017,"This is pretty much your standard chain restaurant. I'm so glad to see they've gotten rid of the servers wearing all white (shirts and pants, with a tie) awhile ago. There's is always a wait in the weekends. Too bad they don't take reservations. I like  that they have a skinnylicious menu with healthier options as well as nutrition info. We ordered the avocado egg rolls appetizer  miso salmon, and skinnylicious shrimp tacos. The egg rolls are good, but not as good as the ones from cpk or bj's. The miso salmon is allllways bomb! Don't be fooled though- just because it's salmon doesn't mean it's healthy. The tacos though are so good!  It doesn't taste diety at all. Natalia Z, our server, was super on point. Even though it was hectic and busy, she didn't miss a beat. She was so pleasant and attentive. She should be the lead sever/ trainer for all servers because when I come here the service can be hit or miss."
Janice L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",195,133,251,5.0,2/1/2016,"Ask me what my favorite restaurant is and I'll say Cheesecake Factory :) This was actually my second time eating at Cheesecake this week! I came to the Brea location on a Sunday night around 5:30pm and there was a 45 minute wait. I got a mojito from the bar because there was such a long wait and YUM YUM YUM! The mojito from here was also the first drink I ever had when I first turned 21.  We finally got sat and the waitress popped up behind me and scared me with her extremely friendly greeting. Of course the warm bread and butter came following :) I ordered the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon. It comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes with a lemon sauce on the bottom. During my meal I ordered another Passionfruit Mojito and it was good, but I prefer the regular Mojito more :) I found out that they have Happy Hour from 4pm to 6pm on the weekdays too, and cocktails are only $5! So I'll definitely try Happy Hour sometime this week!  I have also tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, etc. and honestly they are all so good. My boyfriend tried the Ribeye cooked medium rare and it was really good too! I don't think that I have tried anything that I did not like at Cheesecake Factory :)"
Judy K.,"Norfolk, MA",0,6,,4.0,9/24/2017,Always great food and a very long wait unless you go during the day for lunch. Love the chicken and bow ties.
T L.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,63,45,1.0,2/7/2017,"We came here after a long day of soccer for my son's 11th birthday on a saturday night at 5:30.  I expected a wait and it wasnt bad- about 20 minutes and we were seated. Waited 10 minutes for a waitress to take drink orders etc.  Very nice and personable.   Made our orders which was the hibatchi steak, shrimp pasta and Fettuccini. Meals took their normal time and we were served 2 of the 3 dishes....the Fettuccini was forgotten and waited another 20 minutes to be served. The mamanger only offered an apology and nothing more. Serivce was below what I could consider average having the birthday boy's meal being late. No dessert was ordered so we left."
Michelle R.,"Anaheim, CA",1033,1879,9616,3.0,1/11/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain-restaurant serving up massive food and of course, cheesecake. If you're a fan of the tv show ""Big Bang Theory"", the inside looks nothing like the place Penny worked at, nor are their uniforms yellow. The Brea location is located right on the outskirs of the Brea Mall, on the corner of Brea Boulevard and Brea Mall Way.  While there's plenty of parking, you have to carefully cross a busy mall road to get to the restaurant.  During the day, its easy to cross, but there didn't seem to be much lighting to help at night. We arrived a little after noon on a Sunday, and the wait was estimated at 20 minutes.  We were told that the bar area was open, and also offered the full menu.  We decided to eat there instead, and sat on high table near the bar. and most of the patrons were watching the Vikings vs Seahawks wild card game.  While we were looking through their menu, our server took our drink order and brought a basket of squaw and french bread.  If you have never been to the Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive. Most of the spiral bound menu is filled with advertisement, but there's pages and pages of food from salads, sandwiches, comfort food, pizza, and every version of chicken and fish you can think of.  Their portions are as big as the menu, also massive, so I was happy to see they had a lunch portion of their more popular food items. I decided on the lunch portion of their popular fish n chips, which came with a side of cole slaw, while Stephen had the falafel salad, which was a mixture of romaine lettuce, kale, feta, pita chips, and a yogurt dressing.  I would not rave about the food as being the best (hey, its a chain) but we left satisfied."
Mark D.,"Fullerton, CA",4,224,,4.0,9/11/2017,"Great place! Huge variety of food offerings! Love the fact that they are open late! Pricing will most likely get your full undivided attention. But food, atmosphere, and service are all excellent!"
Omar E.,"Whittier, CA",82,9,3,5.0,6/22/2017,"This has become a regular spot for my family and me fairly prompt on regular days. It is evident that it is family friendly, place great experience and very tasty food properly portioned if your hungry you'll find plenty to fill up on."
