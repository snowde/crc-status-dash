Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12842,4.0,11/7/2010,We come here every once in a while and this was the first time we actually had to wait for a table.  The service is great and so is the food.  The service staff are very attentive and pleasant.  They got our food perfect and quickly.  Our appetizer arrived just a few minutes after we ordered.  Our drinks were refilled quickly.  The food was prepared just as we ordered.  It was a pleasant experience.  Our favorite cheesecake is Craig's Crazy Carrotcake Cheesecake. Yummy!
Denny T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,194,1,1.0,7/8/2012,"First things first, I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. However, my experience with this particular location made me lose my appetite. While waiting to be seated, I decided to look at the variety of cheesecakes up front. I noticed that there was a plate of cheesecake left on the counter, ready to be served to someone who was eating at the restaurant. However, there was a fly on it. The waiter noticed the fly, shoo'd it away, and simply went on with serving it. I was disgusted and felt bad for the person who was eating it... There were also A LOT of flies and fruit flies within the dining area. The next time I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory, it will definitely not be this location."
Elleen P.,"Boston, MA",82,511,256,4.0,6/16/2014,"This place brings back lots of memories from when it used to be on the way from my school to my house in Yorba Linda. Their service has always been impeccable, and although their food is really greasy and grossly portioned, it's still good if you order ~2 entrees and 1 appetizer for a family of four. Trust me, the portions are kind of insane. My favorites are calamari (appetizer), the jambalaya pasta, fried avocado eggrolls (?), and red velvet cheesecake. My sister loves the fried mac & cheese, but to me it tastes a bit like hot dog on a stick (the cheese one). Beware of massive lines on Friday nights though!"
J Y.,"Corona, CA",0,8,,3.0,10/4/2014,The food took a bit to be served. The complimentary sour dough bread was crunchy. Our server smelled like warm vanilla sugar from the body shop. Way... too... strong...
Dubai T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/6/2015,Bad service (the worst in a series of the cheesecake factory restaurants in California) and the service here in the increasingly downhill
Lisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,325,88,3.0,8/12/2010,"Of all of the Cheesecake Factories, the one in Brea was the best. Maybe it was because I ordered the right food for the staff is more attentive.  I like meeting friends at this place when I want somewhere in the middle of Orange County and Riverside and a safe place to eat. No food order can go too wrong here. I usually don't know what to order because the menu is so big, but I usually end up with one of the pasta dishes. Large portions. Awesome to take home and save the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Yum. I love their free wheat bread. Delish. Their sodas seems to be watered down. When this place is busy, you can feel it. The server seemed rushed, your specific requests may be forgotten, etc.... This is a good comforting place. Semi-fancy. Expensive for the food. The desserts ARE TO DIED FOR! Do yourself a favor: Eat the bread, share and appetizer and entree, and get a slice of cheesecake. Yum."
Braelin K.,"Brea, CA",247,17,2,5.0,7/11/2014,"Came here for our anniversary dinner and the 5 stars is for food yes, but the service! Excellent! I'm in the industry so I know how annoying I am, being 10 years a vegetarian with a gluten allergy that if ignored is a force to be reckoned with. That being said, Sean D made my embarrassment of changing so many things disappear! He was so kind and willing to accommodate my dietary needs! He knows exactly how to provide excellent service and genuinely wants his guests to enjoy their time. I am just so blown away! Our amazing dinner was just the supporting act! Thanks so much Sean! We will be returning customers because of you, doll!"
Susi M.,"Brea, CA",0,66,,5.0,2/20/2014,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory dozens of times and have never been disappointed yet.  The quality of the food is always superb.  From drinks to appetizers to main dishes to desserts - you can't go wrong with anything you order.  Delicious salads, great soups, yummy pasta dishes, homey dishes that remind me of years gone by - all delicious!   Is it pricey?  Yes, but definitely worth it.  Is there a wait sometimes?  Yes, but once again worth it.  The only ding I can give this place is the noise level, which at some times can be a bit high.  Service is always very pleasant and efficient - we've never had a problem.  I can heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good food!"
Lisa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",10,1,,5.0,10/27/2014,"This cheesecake factory was awesome. Our group had a very nice server, and all the employees we spoke with had great customer service, even though the restaurant was super busy. We didn't even have to wait, got lucky and snagged a table at the bar. They even took one of our appetizers off the bill, because it didn't come until our food got there."
Leasha C.,"Olympia, WA",261,584,688,1.0,4/22/2012,"NOPE!  Came with a party of 11. Sat, enjoyed ourselves, had some drinks, ordered our food and chatted more. I'm sorry but I don't think a burger tossed in the middle of a plate (literally looked tossed in the middle) is worth $12.95. Pauls Place's Mushroom Burger ($5) is WAY better than what they feel the need to charge $12.95 for. I REALLY don't think an 8oz glass of Apple Martini is worth $11. You can take the little lemon swirl out and knock the drink down to $4 and we would be in business because that is about what it is worth. Trying to get the check was next to impossible. We all paid well over what our meals were priced at and taxed but she still came back saying the tab was $40 short. NO! I have a feeling she pocketed a little extra because I know for damn sure that we paid over the amount on the tab (The final price already included gratuity.) Its cool though. Not that it matters but I will not be back to this location (let alone any of them since I've had terrible service at the Garden Walk location as well)"
Macchiato C.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,135,11,4.0,3/3/2012,I like The Cheesecake Factory because I like Sheldon Cooper ... Nuff said. LOL
Ziv C.,"Brea, CA",8,14,1,5.0,7/18/2015,Nice food and thank you for Dana brought the best service that we have ever experienced in Cheese Cake Factory.
L. P. M.,"Orange County, CA",4,208,1,2.0,1/31/2012,"A tough review because I like the chain and have found the food options plentiful and wait staff pleasant.  At all other locations -- and then there's Brea, and the below is not the first example of inattentive service at this location. Hello, Bartender, over here, please.  Don't act like you don't see me sitting here at your bar.  You know, I'm the dude with the empty beer glass that has been empty for, oh, I don't know, 10 minutes?!?  Right, just look right through me and my empty glass and just stare up at the ceiling, because that's where you'll find bar patrons wanting to order some food and a drink before heading home.  The thirsty, hungry types always hang out on the ceiling.   Better than that, a shift change at 5:00 PM during Happy Hour that ends at 6:00 PM?  Perfect scheduling, because Bartender A who has a shift ending isn't taking orders but instead cleaning bar glasses so she can end her shift vs. Bartender B who stares at the ceiling like he can't be bothered serving patrons really is a smart management decision and great way to handle customers willing to part with money for food and drink. While my glass still sits empty I devise a quick plan to ensure I don't interfere with the flow of this bar:  Me, money, and willingness to part with some cash, perform a magic trick that should surprise no one:  I paid for my beer (with tip) and left leaving behind others still sitting with empty glasses.  Before heading home, hunger and money still in tow, I spent some money at another local chain being served by a bartender that interacted and smiled and brought food and beverage. Hopefully those patrons on the ceiling got better service."
Apple B.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,6,2,2.0,9/9/2014,"Food was above average a little, but very arrogant, bitchy waitresses here. They just stood around and hovered over one particular table they were friends with. Very rude comments and attitude  from our waitress when we asked questions and when she finally came over to clear my plate she asked some weird question about my soup. She assumed that I got an extra soup as a side... And then just walked away and threw the check on our table."
Sandra A.,"Cerritos, CA",0,24,,4.0,9/14/2013,"It's been a tradition for me and my family to go to this Cheesecake Factory every year before the start of school for my children. The atmosphere is nice and the servers are usually move at a decent speed. The last Sunday that we went, I ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger and absolutely LOVED how it mixed so well with the burger. The cheese wasn't gooey and I didn't feel overly stuffed after finishing the burger.  Our food was great but this time our servers were very slow. We waited around 20-25 minutes for our food and the place wasn't very crowded. Although the servers were slow this time, I still feel that this restaurant is a great place to go for my family."
Mr. G.,"Alamo, CA",1,123,1,3.0,1/14/2013,"This location is on-par with most others. Long waits to get seated. A hurried staff that seem overworked. And the typical mile-long Cheesecake Factory menu.  Nothing to complain about though. We were seated after the obligatory 20 minute wait. They got our order correct. The food was good, and the prices were what you'd expect to pay.  Consistent experience. Nothing to write home about. But not exactly my favorite place, either."
Pam K.,"Buena Park, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/8/2015,Terrible service put us on patio not even crowded and no server. Where is the manager not sure couldn't find her. Not worth the wait! Many options around this area try somewhere else!
steve l.,"Anaheim, CA",0,10,1,1.0,1/8/2015,"Snooty waitress was an anomaly for our experience at what is a normally fantastic restaurant. Food is great, love the atmosphere, absolutely hated this experience because of this little witch. She came around to the table with her fake smile and when we hesitated what was at most 20 seconds with our ordering, she rolled her eyes, said she would come back later, and took off without any acknowledgement from us. When she came back, she was rude, abrupt, and obviously annoyed. I will spend the remainder of the evening or until I get bored attempting to ruin her life for the slight against my dining experience. Game on."
Emily M.,"La Habra, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/27/2015,I had dinner here last night with my parents and our server was Lisa D. She was fabulous and gave us such great service!! She was knowledgable about the menu and seemed to truly enjoy her job. I worked in the service industry for about 10 years and I can honestly say that I have never had a better experience dining out. Lisa was awesome and room such good care of us. We will definitely be coming back and requesting her as our server.
