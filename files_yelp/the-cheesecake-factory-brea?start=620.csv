Drew P.,"Long Beach, CA",28,23,4,4.0,5/2/2012,"Not at all what I expected from the sound of the name Cheesecake Factory. Very well presented and clean.  The bread that is given first was dry, hard and not a good first impression. We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer and I had the Chicken Alfredo w/ Sun Dried Tomatoes. Very delicious and presented fine. The portions were large; making it worth your money.  For dessert, we had one of the fudge brownie sundaes and a chocolate milkshake. The sundae was presented very well but not as great as I hoped; however, the milkshake was one of the best I have ever had, no doubt. Considering the fair prices, elegant environment,  huge portions and we happen to have an excellent server, I will in fact be returning again."
Victor C.,"Fullerton, CA",20,176,12,3.0,6/18/2014,"Place gets packed during lunch and dinner hours, had to wait for a table maybe 15 mins last time, but it was fine. The place is hit or miss. depending on what you order. It is very similar to the lazy dog restaurant in pricing and menu. it has a nice ambiance and vibe to it, their cheesecakes are probably the best thing about this place they are decadent and delicious. I will say that they have some really nice waitresses who are super nice and super gorgeous. Aside from that the place is pretty decent."
Michelle M.,"Anaheim, CA",54,24,1,5.0,8/6/2014,"I've been here so many times I lost count. The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! But this time was different and actually the best experience yet. Our server was by far the best waitress there, I'm sure of it. She greeted us with a smile, memorized all of our orders without writing a single thing down, brought my grandma a new plate of food since the original order was too spicy for her, and made my dad's birthday extra special! My dads favorite dessert on planet Earth is cheesecake. He was so excited to place his order, ""I'll have the original please."" Our server replied, ""Really? Just the original."" My dad firmly said, ""Well I like it."" Our server embarrassingly laughed while we hysterically laughed. When she returned, she was carrying two plates of cheesecake. On one plate, spelled out in chocolate it read, Happy Birthday Frank, while the other said, ""Because you like it."" Our table broke out in laughter yet again! Thank you for making my dad's 65th extra special! (Kicking myself in the rear for not getting our servers name)"
Min S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,158,48,2.0,2/8/2012,"It seems like this location is way worse than the one in LA. I've only been to the one in LA three times so I thought all the locations provide same level of service and the food. No, it was not. Even though the wait was much shorter than LA one's, from sitting us to serving and the taste of the food were all below expectation. The chicken dish( fried and stirred) was way too sweet and it was covered with sweet syrup. All  of my friends said it was way too sweet. Imagine To tell you the truth, they added more syrup and bell peppers to the Orange chicken from Panda Express. Spaghettis was okay and a it was a huge dish, but I would not order it again. Another Asian dish we ordered was about average. Now I am gonna only order American dish or Italian dish at Another location. Server didn't seem to much care about , nor she seemed to be interested in serving us."
DESTINY L.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",1,16,,2.0,8/3/2014,Called in three times because they kept on disconnecting me. Got to the restaurant to place order. Had to wait almost 10 mins for the cashier to take my order because she was not at the counter.  A lot of my time was wasted. Good thing their cheesecake is good or else I would've given one star.
John S.,"Brea, CA",1,32,12,5.0,10/17/2013,"The only reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because there use to be a waiter here named ""Christian.""  He is the best example of a waiter.  I have never had a waiter as nice and helpful as this guy.   He helped us with our questions, was very attentive to our needs like bread and water and was always around.   For food and everything else, cheesecake is cheesecake.   it's good food."
Joyee C.,"Monterey Park, CA",61,264,616,3.0,6/29/2014,"I came here for my birthday few years back, and was satisfy with my plate and dessert.  I think this restaurant should lower their dessert price a bit as it's their selling point... It gets so pricey that I don't feel like order it unless for special days. I love the advocado eggrolls here! My go for appetizer dish!  Since this location has lots of customers, I feel their servers are slow and careless."
K C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",6,72,1,2.0,5/27/2014,"Took my favorite thing off the menu (Thai chicken pasta)!!!!!  Was really the only reason I went there. I have had two bad meals there since I had to change from my regular. Grilled chicken club was soggy, bland and boring. Fries were undercooked. And the pizza tastes like it's from a cafeteria. I used to love coming here too. :("
Manuel H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,18,,4.0,7/19/2014,Had dinner there Saturday night and the server Steve was awesome!  It's rare to find patient and genuinely friendly people in the service industry.  The reason I'm going with 4 stars is because the veggie burger was terrible - so be warned.
V L.,"Pomona, CA",0,9,2,4.0,9/20/2015,"Everything was good except the wait at the beginning. We waited like 10 minutes to get water and drinks and the one to notice was not even the waiter from our table but the one next to it who went and got somebody because we were not being helped. Besides that everything was great, the food and the drinks as well as the service. Will definitely come back!"
Dr. Catherine L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",517,127,93,5.0,3/6/2012,"I am never disappointed when I come here!! I love their ambiance and lighting I love their service and how the waiters introduce themselves or when they switch off I love their unlimited sour dough and honey wheat bread with butter I love their huge portions I love their very reasonable prices I love their cheesecake menu The chicken madeira and ceasar chicken salad are my all time favorites!!!  This is a perfect place to be at with friends, for an important meeting with colleague, or a romantic date!"
Melissa G.,"Monterey Park, CA",139,268,209,3.0,4/19/2012,"Overall, an above-average chain. Not somewhere I would personally choose to eat, but a good option if you're looking for a fancy ish location. Additionally, I've seen Cheesecake Factories work especially well for business/customer lunches-- note that it can get a little bit noisy, but that's not always a bad thing with such meals. Pros: -Generous portions -Lunch special entrees still = huge portions -Entrees are all generally good (especially like the miso salmon and I've heard from mulitple people that the jambalaya's bomb) -Delishhhh & decadent cheesecake (though I tried the straight up plain cheesecake once and it was just okay) -Good service Cons: -If busy, this location is loud & it's hard to carry a conversation -Some entrees, though savory, seem greasy/heavy (carbonara pasta, shepherd's pie) -In general, and it's really my fault for what I order (they do offer a ""Skinny"" menu), this is not a place the calorie conscious will leave feeling too superb"
Liz H.,"Irvine, CA",15,167,22,4.0,1/13/2012,"My girlfriend and I eat here constantly because it's the halfway meet-up point between us.  We have found over the course of multiple visits that the enormous menu is hit-and-miss. We've found a handful of dishes that we enjoy and just order those over and over. Her favorite is the Orange Chicken, which always comes out hot and delicious and with just the right amount of rice. I prefer the Barbecue Chicken Salad. Their pasta dishes are generally very tasty, but if you order anything with chicken or shrimp in it they seriously skimp on it. The only thing I've ever ordered at CF that I could not finish eating because it was so disgusting was the Chicken di Pana. It tasted like feet. Avoid it. The service is generally very polite and friendly, if at times a little slow. We usually don't notice unless our drinks get exceptionally low and nobody comes to refill them. My friend loves their strawberry lemonade and I am very fond of their good strong Mojitos.  Their desserts are delicious, naturally. To be honest I've never bothered with the cheesecake, I love the Black-Out cake and the Bowl of Fresh Strawberries option. Of course it's much better to get the strawberries when they're in season."
Sam A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,106,13,5.0,3/20/2012,"This place is great!  I stopped by for lunch last Friday.  The wait wasn't unreasonable (20 minutes) and the service was awesome.  Our waitress was super attentive, quick and informative about specials and such. The food is always fresh and looks great when it makes it to your table.  Desserts are amazing too!"
Sigi M.,"Whittier, CA",94,30,86,5.0,8/23/2013,The service was great and our server was great with a food suggestion. I must say a big fan of the sun dried  tomatoes but when he described the sun dried tomatoes mixed in the Alfredo sauce it was too good to pass up. Just as described the plate was delicious.
Angeliza May O.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,31,,3.0,9/7/2011,"I just recently had brunch for the first time at Cheesecake Factory, I'd have to say, it was delicious!!! They have a good menu selection well divided from appetizers, lunch, dinner, drinks, desserts, and Sunday Brunch!  The time I went was around 11:45AM, Sunday Morning. The weather was content in Brea, so of course took advantage of eating outdoors. There were plenty of other people outside and servers running back and forth. I like our waitress, she was personable from the beginning, but I didn't like the fact that she was jammed with plenty of tables at once, it took her about 20 minutes to get our cup of waters before I had to ask her co worker for one. Even when she brought it back, she didn't notice they beat her to it. I really wanted a good cup of soup; so I ordered the soup of the day, which was cream of broccoli!! Had to be one of the best, I've ever tried!! It wasn't just a small ""cup"" as they say, it's a bowl of soup that was too filling!! For my meal, I was craving a sandwich, definitely wanted something tasty. I ended up getting a ham and cheddar breakfast sandwich with bacon of course!! It was really good, great portion size and very filling!!  I was quite satisfied with my food choice!! I went home completely full!! I've got to go back with more of an appetite, for Sunday Brunch!!"
Ann C.,"Chino Hills, CA",715,545,480,5.0,5/6/2009,"Holy Shrimp Scampi! Every time I eat at Cheesecake I always order the usual:  Fetuccini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes!  Thick and creamy with the sweet tartness of the sundried tomatoes *wiggling* -makes me do the ""happy dance!"" Last Tuesday  I wanted to try a different dish for once so I ordered the Shrimp Scampi w/ Linguini (usually it's angelhair pasta).  I was blown away by my dish!  Literally, every single bite I had to emit a satisfied ""Mmmmmm!"" The noodles were chewy and al dente, the white wine butter sauce was light not greasy and the SHRIMPS!  Big, colossal sized shrimps coated with this light panko-like bread crumbs and herbs and fried on a wok...it was crispy and juicy and did I mention they were huge!?!  The noodles had GARLIC cloves sprinkled- like golden pieces of caramelized heaven... *drool*  Seriously, ridiculously good!  As it should be for costing $20!!! Also good:  If you're a meat guy go for the Factory Meatloaf it's very hearty.  If you like fish go for the Miso Salmon it's sweet and light.  Or the herb crusted Salmon which is also delicious.  My cheesecake of choice:  White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle!  Chocolate crust with white chocolate creamy goodness =) ""Doncha wish your girlfriend loved to eat like me?  Doncha wish your girlfriend was a pig like me?  Doncha!""  LOL  Sometimes I crack my own self up!"
Steph N.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1,69,18,3.0,5/29/2015,LOL old review. Uhh yay for national cheesecake day. Boo for sad asparagus salad which is a greasy handful of asparagus on a plate.
Michelle C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",187,133,42,1.0,9/20/2013,"I've been going here for years, but the last time I was here was enough to make me never go back. Our server was nice but in a sarcastic way from the beginning. She also kept forgetting to bring things to us or pretended to not hear me. She even attempted to charge us for extra bread when I ordered 5 items for 3 people. I complained to the manager right before I left, and he kind of just shrugged and was like, ""I guess I can 'give' you extra bread right now... if you want..."" in a very fake, caring tone of voice. I will never go back! At least until they decide to shape up their staff and management. It's sad to think they are opened by the same people as Grand Lux Cafe. I had never had problems with Grand Lux before! Unacceptable!"
Mayra M.,"Anaheim, CA",15,29,4,1.0,4/26/2013,"I normally get excellent service but not today.... we dined to celebrate a friends promotion, but no that didn't happen. We ordered at the bar but were seated so we brought our plates and drinks over and it seemed like the waitress forgot we existed. We kept saying excuse me excuse me and nothing finally we asked  for a drink and she said ok not asking the rest of the group for their drink order we asked her. Then after 30 minutes of waiting for a drink she brought us our drinks and check. To add insult to the matter she gave herself an 18% gratuity for a party of four so we were force to tip for service we did not receive. The manager apologized and brought us a slice of cake which was nice but at that point it was a little to late. FYI we continued to sit there and our waitress never apologized nor followed up with us. The Lazy Dog across the street is looking better by the minute."
