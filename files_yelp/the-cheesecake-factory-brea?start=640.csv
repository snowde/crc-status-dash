Art B.,"Kilauea, HI",0,9,,4.0,12/28/2013,"Four of us just returned from lunch at the Brea Mall Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. Priscilla was our server and was very sweet and friendly but did not listen to what we ordered and three dishes came out different than what we wanted. We sent those three back and the manager came out to see what happened. We told him and he was right on top of the situation. He made sure we had the correct dishes as quickly as possible, checked after they arrived to see if we liked the meals and offered us a free dessert for the mix up and delay.  You know that anyone can make a mistake. It is how the mistake is handled that shows  a truly great restaurant. Not only the manager but several other servers were checking in on our table to ensure we were happy.  We were all impressed with the manager and how he runs the business. We highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory to everyone. The only reason I would not go 5 stars is because of Priscilla. She does not listen well. Even after the botched meal order, I was still eating my lunch and she came up to ask if I was done. I told her ""no"" and she still tried to take my plate away. Don't know if it was a bad day for her or if she has a listening issue."

Aleyna L.,"Fullerton, CA",103,125,7,4.0,1/24/2012,"I'm a huge fan of The cheesecake factory. I've been going here for more than 3 years and i usually come twice a month.  When i first tried this place, they used to be better for some reason. I always order strawberry lemonade and it just go way too sweet like few months ago and it didn't change till the last visit.  Their portions are mind boggling large at dinner time and just right when you order lunch portion. I recommend spicy chicken chipotle pasta and Fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and garlic noodles. I've also tried Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was meh.. something that you could make at home! They give you white and brown oatmeal bread before the main food. But lately i discovered that they only give you brown bread now! Or was that just me..? i don't think so because i saw so many bread coming in and out only with those brown bread in the basket. Well but i guess that's pretty reasonable because brown bread was the most popular bread and people always asked for that over and over again.  Their service is very good. Never caught a day when they were mean or inattentive!  Just my favorite place to eat for decent price! I can't really say anything about dessert menu because i get stuffed when i finish eating pastas.. But I've tried original cheesecake and obviously the best because it says in their sign board.. ""The Cheesecake Factory"" *Pizzas are good too!*"
Heather B.,"Carson, CA",94,41,7,3.0,3/27/2012,"This place has its potential to be better.. First of all, it is bad mistake to go during the weekend around dinner time because a lot of hugnry people who just finished shopping at Brea Mall don't want to have dinner at the food court. I don't think they take reservation on the weekend and only take walk-ins.. So if you go around 6 or 7 pm on a Saturday, you'll see at least twenty people waiting to be seated. If, after 40+ minutes of waiting, you are seated and have ordered, it'll take another 20 minutes to be served. I feel like the food tastes better during the weekdays... Probably because they don't have to rush.. I ordered what I always order, Farfalle with garlic sauce, and the pasta was undercooked. I didn't even bother asking for another one because I knew I'd have to wait some more. Another thing is that it's really loud... and dark!! It was hard to have converstation :( The cheesecakes are always delicious~ I tried the lemon raspberry for the first time. It's very tangy (almost a little too sour), but if you're not a huge fan of cheesecake.. try the lemon raspberry. It has half cheesecake and half lemon pound cake :)"
Anna S.,"Walnut, CA",205,618,274,4.0,10/14/2013,"I've been coming here since I was in college and it never disappoints. It's much bigger inside than it is outside. There's always a crowd coming but when we got there with our table of 4, we were seated immediately (around 11:30 on a Sunday). Our waiter was attentive, the bread was warm and the entrees are huge. My appetite has been shrinking a bit so it may be good to try family style next time you're there (unless you really want to bring back appetizers). I ordered the fish burger which actually tasted like a better version of the filet-o-fish. Since they have a huge mound of coleslaw in the burger, I opted for fries with my dish. SO ordered a turkey sandwich, salad (and it came with a soup of the day although I don't think it was mentioned on the menu). It was still filling. My dad ordered the jambalaya pasta and ate it up. He even asked for mild spicy. My mom ordered an omelette breakfast platter with yummy roasted potatoes. Great place for groups and noticed how friendly it is for children too."
Andy D.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",197,241,222,4.0,3/31/2013,"After a show at the Improv we all decide that we wanted to go to get something sweet so we cruise on over to the Cheesecake Factory in Brea. We were seated in about 10 minutes and we had an awesome server. He was very friendly and made us all laugh for no reason at all. Made us all feel very welcome and after coming from the Improv a waiter made us laugh, we were making jokes amongst ourselves that we should've just come here. Hahah. Anyways, we all ordered our own dessert and it was amazing as always. This specific location had extra low dimmed lights and was nice for our quadruple date night. I don't live near here, but if I am in the area again I will definitely stop by."
May O.,"Santa Ana, CA",11,42,23,1.0,5/2/2015,I came here for my birthday decided on the cashew chicken.  It was horrible they went overboard in the sauce and it tasted like it was out of a bottle.  My husband had the meatloaf and enjoyed it
Steve W.,"Irvine, CA",0,34,,5.0,7/12/2011,"Why can't I stop thinking about this place?  So we ordered some food at work on the 4th of July for lunch. We decided on the Cheesecake Factory. So I don't have a 9-5 job where I get the 4th off, and get to have go to bbqs with family. Well, family can be a little hard to understand at times, so it's not all that bad. At least I don't have to deal with that anxiety attack on the way to the family's house as to what's going to happen today?  Alright, so I ordered what I always order ""Weight Management Chicken"". It comes with 4 grilled chicken breasts with asparagus and steamed whole grain rice. Sooo Good!!! And for desert, I had to get a piece of the Sugar Free Cheesecake (made with Spenda). OMG, I'm just in love with this. Cheesecake with less guilt. I guess it's like light cigarettes for smokers."
Kirstie A.,"Bellevue, WA",302,32,15,2.0,2/20/2013,"i really hate leaving bad reviews. but anyways it was valentines day. so my boyfriend and i ordered to-go figured that would be easier since its going to be really crowded there.  called in ordered, and once she said how long it will be ready.. she hangs up. helllooo??? i need my total. -__- called back. and also asked for extra bread. bcos im absolutely obsessed with the honey oat. pretty much begged her to not forget.  once my bf picked it up, what do ya know..  NO bread. & i also ordered a drink (mint green tea) which im also obsessed with. and we didnt even get that -____- nothing annoys me more than buying something and not getting it.  i understand its valentines day its very busy, but as servers.. im sure you have to be prepared for it. esp if your working at the cheesecake factory."
Melanie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,48,55,3.0,2/5/2011,"Boyfriend: ""So what is the cheesecake factory? I thought it was just a place where they mass produce cheesecake. Therefore, cheesecake factory. Right?"" lawl, no. I went to the cheesecake factory for a fellow yelpers birthday and I just thought the place was ok.  We came on a Friday night around 6:30 and it was PACKED. Good thing one of my friends made reservations so when I got there we were able to go right to our table. However, when we were waiting near the front for our friend to come get us the hostess didn't even ask us if we need any help and no greeting whatsoever. Rude much? We sat around a large table in the back corner near the patio and we were all bunched up together. Right off the bat I noticed that it was WAY TOO DARK IN THERE! One of my friends kept cracking jokes about how it was way too dark he couldn't even see the menu.  We got our menus and I give them props for having such a large variety.  The price for pasta ranged from around 12 bucks to 25 bucks. The burgers were around 10-15 bucks and I didn't really look at the rest of the menu, but lets just say there's alot to pick from. Maybe TOO much.  Our waiter brought us some fresh bread since my boyfriend and I came a little later so that was a plus. The bread was probably the best part of my meal. Loveeeee their bread and it's also really light. I ended up ordering the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and my boyfriend ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. The Bistro Shrimp pasta according to the menu had ""Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce."" However, mine had WAY too much tomatoes and not enough spaghettini. Overall, it was pretty good and HUGE I just wish they didn't put so many tomatoes so I could have enjoyed the sauce more. My boyfriend's Carbonara wasn't so great. There wasn't alot of flavor and it tasted very plain to us. He even had to add my leftover tomatoes and sauce to his dish to make it taste better. He said it tasted way better so I guess the extra tomatoes worked out in his favor. Overall the food was just ok and it was way too dark. Good thing my friends were there with me so it made the experience much more enjoyable. Will I be back? Probably since they're giving a $10 gift card for me since I did an online survey. After that? Nah. I'd rather to go CPK."
Farakh Z.,"Long Beach, CA",41,158,10,4.0,1/18/2014,"Went here for dinner one night..love their food.  Good selection of everything under the sun which can be a bit intimidating but as long as you know what you are in the mood for, you can find something you'll like.  My favorites are always the pasta dishes as well as their sandwiches.  Of course the cheesecake is great as well."
Pam S.,"Oakland, CA",272,312,35,4.0,6/8/2011,"I went to their happy hour from 4-6pm for $5 drinks and appetizers.   Nice location @ the Brea Mall, easy parking I really liked the mojito - easy to drink, not over-powerfully minty We got a nice spread of appetizers - stuffed mushrooms, artichoke & spinach dip, chicken croquettes, and potstickers. I was impressed with the service.  The staff was incredibly attentive, and when there was a mix-up in the potsticker order, both our waitress AND the manager came out to apologize!  Never has a restaurant been so concerned at the delay in an order of potstickers."
Jennifer F.,"Los Angeles, CA",437,246,279,2.0,3/7/2011,"Our party of four arrived without reservations and were seated within minutes. We were brought to the patio but our table was still dirty (sticky with crumbs and fries), and our waitress swept everything to the ground. The same thing happened to a larger party. Patrons should only be seated at clean tables!  It was much too dark outdoors. The lights were very weak and the candles weren't helpful. Actually, the waiter forgot to light our candle so we had to ask him to.  Service is friendly but very hasty. It was difficult flagging down a waiter even in such a tiny area. Though, three of them came out to sing us happy birthday which was nice.  The bread was good but very inconsistent. Our first basket consisted of a single loaf of white bread and two loaves of brown grain bread, all of which were room temperature, chunky, and crunchy. Our second basket consisted of three freshly warm and flat (sat on, perhaps?) pieces of brown grain bread.  For entrees, I had the Wild Mushroom Burger with a Kobe patty which I quite enjoyed. I also like the original Kobe Burger. The burgers are gigantic and I was too full to touch my fries.  My friends ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and Pasta Carbonara, both of which were unimpressive and boring. Different pieces of noodles had different temperatures! The portions were huge and we took about half to go. It would be a nice change for the restaurant to offer half-portions at half-price! $7 VS $14.  For dessert, we had the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was quite good. The whipped cream was fresh and light, but the white chocolate on the outside tasted like plastic!  I like their Godiva Brownie Sundae and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake as well.  Food story short: Skip the pasta, go for the Kobe burgers, and opt for a slice of cheesecake."
Alice C.,"Irvine, CA",1936,1026,623,1.0,2/4/2009,"I've been to Cheesecakes around SoCal numerous times and I've never experienced below average service.  But this time, I experienced below poor service, as in to the point our server did not come by for more than 30 minutes to check up on us and I had to ask another server ""Hi, can you locate our server? He's no where to be found in plain sight"".  If I would give this location a letter grade, I would skip F, and go straight to letter Z.       We skipped out on the Happiest Place On Earth (gasp, what a bad decision) for my sister's 21st and decided to just grab dinner and cocktails since she just turned legal.  I have an above average tolerance span for waiting for food, but not this time, it took our server 20 minutes to bring out all our food.  At that time, my four cheese pasta that was suppose to be served with sizzling melted cheese blanketing over my pasta, but instead, poor pastas were covered in hardended plastic looking cheese, I didn't know Cheesecake was the FakeCheese Factory.  I was very unhappy.   Buffalo Wings appetizers were good, until I realized I wanted ranch instead of blue cheese, this was when our server was no where to be found.  What a downer when ranch and buffalo wings fail to unite.    When my sister ordered a mojito, our server asked her for her ID, and I, with no shame, blurted ""it's her 21st birthday!"" and a smart, considerate, supurb server would automatically have a lightbulb shining on top of their head with ""this calls for a birthday dessert"" marquee scrolling round and round.  But no, he didn't get it.  I was too irritated to ask for it, and my sister was too nice and she said ""it's ok, I don't want it.""  Seriously, who doesn't want to feel special on their birthday, I mean, come on. Oh, on the free bread, did you know we had to ask for them?  He didn't bring them out, we had to ask.  That's a big nono, Cheesecake.  Honestly, if I can give them a 0 star, I seriously would, but I guess folks at Yelp are just nice people that doesn't want to put what is suppose to be excellent chain restaurants to shame."
David C.,"La Puente, CA",3,43,18,4.0,3/15/2014,Wait times can be pretty bad.  The servers are pretty good.  I always order the miso salmon with extra miso sauce on brown rice.  Not much difference in size between the lunch and dinner portion.  Save money and go for the lunch portion if you can.  Patio seating is very nice in the evening.
Lo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,11,4.0,4/13/2014,Came here 3/12/14 to celebrate my 25th birthday and I must say I loved it! I am a fan of TCF been to plenty and food is always great! Love there lunch and great prices! I particularly loved it here because of their service the waitresses were so great with our guests and party! From the moment we walked in they were attentive they didn't give an impression that because we were a large party that meant large tip they actual worked for it and earned it! I will def be back!
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,4.0,2/21/2011,"This restaurant is in the Brea Mall shopping plaza near the end of the parking lot  Has it's own valet parking service. Just to clarify, cheesecake factory serves food other than cheesecake. Whenever I go, there's an inherent desire to purchase cheesecake. But the driving force that gets me there is often the entree. Environment: Similar to the more frequented restaurant in Sam Diego's Fashion Valley Mall, it's always loud. Cheesecake factory is one of the few restaurants that does not take reservations yet still manages to fill up for dinner and most times for lunch. Amazing! If they started allowing for public purchases of franchises, I would definitely invest. The tables are distributed well and at night, the restaurant is dimly lit. For lunch, lots of natural light penetrate the many floor to ceiling windows. Not too bright with just the right amount of light. Upon arriving, you head to the front desk to get seated or pick one a beeper. Gets crowded and some people don't understand how to form lines. Otherwise, no problems. Waiter/waitresses: all very friendly. Most of time, they're a bit younger. They come by frequently to check on you throughout the meal. Occasionally, they take breaks during your meal but their temporary replacements are more than adequate in providing service. The service here isn't quite as good as that it's San Diego counterpart. Things just seem to move a little slower. Food: the best part of this culinary experience. There are several pages of appetizers and entrees to choose from. Have tried a good number appetizers including firecracker salmon rolls, thai lettuce wraps, spinach artichoke dip, and the cheese and crab dip. The favorite is probably firecracker salmon rolls which are served with a spicy thai flavor sauce on a bed of shredded radishes. The entree I always order is the thai chicken pasta. Only once has it been merely satisfactory. Otherwise, always tasty. Green noodles, large chunks of chicken, peanuts, some sort of bean, and bell peppers covered with a slightly spicy peanut sauce. So darn good! Desserts are alway a slice of cheesecake. The favorite is the kahlua coffee cheesecake. Hard to explain why. Maybe it's the perfect combination of coffee and cheese flavor that makes it so irresistible. Drinks: mostly stick with water. On occasion, will order the strawberry lemonade which is a bit sweet (might be from concentrate). No strawberry chunks within the drink. I think we've ordered a blended drink before. Not sure what it wa but there were no complaints afterward. Recommendation: EAT!"
Vanessa D.,"Buena Park, CA",1,9,,5.0,5/19/2015,"I came into the Cheesecake Factory for dinner after my graduation ceremony. My family and I were starving, thankfully we were seated fairly quickly. Our server nikae (i think that's how it was spelt) was amazing. She helped me decide on my passion fruit margarita which was yummy. My entire family enjoyed their meals and drinks, along with our dessert. I was very pleased with our experience, our server was one of the best I have ever had. Friendliness and cleanliness is important to us, and she was on top of it! She went out of her way to make me feel special since she knew I just graduated!"
CHANTAL L.,"Placentia, CA",0,51,7,5.0,4/13/2014,"I'm not into franchise restaurant establishments and I typically do not eat at Cheescake Factory unless it's someone's birthday or special occasion, despite being a franchise this place is delicious! I can't get enough of the BBQ chicken salad and the mouth watering chicken costinetta! Hands down the best chicken dish I have ever had.  There menu is expansive but I tend to stick to my favorites."
Joseph A.,"Walnut, CA",382,150,251,5.0,3/4/2009,"I've been here twice for lunch so far, and each visit was a superbly positive experience.  What really helps here is that, to me anyway, this particular Cheesecake Factory has a really pleasant decor, inside and out.  I'd recommend getting a seat out on the patio for lunch on a nice, sunny day. On my last visit, Kassidy R. accompanied me for what was explicitly to be a Cheesecake Tasting Adventure.  See, I don't just focus all my energy on pancakes.  My personal goal is to pretty much try every type of cheesecake listed in the menu, but not all on the same day.  Takeru Kobayashi, I ain't. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple - ""Creamy Cheesecake Swirled with Caramel, Peanut Butter, Butterfingers® and Reeses Peanut Butter Cups®"": My All-Time Favorite.  I didn't have it on this day, but Kassidy did, and she said she enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it if you are not averse to chocolate, and not allergic to peanuts.  5 Stars. White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake - This combo is too rich for my palate.  3 Stars Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - This is listed as being their most popular flavor for the last 28 years.  I understand why.  Strawberries are in season, so get this stuff ASAP!  5 Stars Prior to this particular visit, I had a Shepherd's Pie for lunch.  Pretty damn tasty!  I was surprised to learn that the crust was essentially mashed potatoes. On both occasions, the wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The Tina Fey lookalike (her name escapes me, but I less-than-three her) was the best.  Friendly recommendations, re-fills without asking, and everything.  It's like she was reading my mind.  I'm Cyclops, and I wish she'd be my Jean Grey."
