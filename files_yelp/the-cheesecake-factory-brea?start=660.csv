Janette Z.,"Long Beach, CA",9,6,,1.0,11/8/2014,The food was great but the service was terrible! She never came back to offer refills and it was hot outside. She took forever to bring the check and even longer to bring it back.
Ben H.,"Brea, CA",3,21,,3.0,5/9/2014,We get takeout Cheesecake here when the wife has a craving.  Haven't been here for a meal in years.. too many better and local options in Brea to settle for a chain.
Jenn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",385,240,132,3.0,2/6/2011,"Rundown - I don't love Cheesecake Factory - It's an overpriced chain - I'm really a sucker for the overpriced cheesecakes - Service is OK at this location - The cucumber drink is horrible I remember, back in high school, this was the ""cool"" place to go for a dinner date or on a special outting with friends.  It was expensive (for being in highschool) and none of us really new what good food was all about.  For all we knew, this was it.   Fast forward a decade (+) later.  This isn't great food but it's borderline decent.  It's not bad for a chain but it's really expensive.   Now days, I go here when my other half is craving his favorite dish - Something jambalaya.  I never say no because I'm always hoping to find a dish that I would love.   Other than the cheesecake, No such luck yet. Let's start with my recent drink experience.  I tried the cucumber martini and it was horrible.  I took 2 sips and couldn't get myself to drink it anymore.  I think the waitress knew I hated it and she didn't say anything.  I should have asked her to get me something else but I didn't bother.  (This really was my laziness on a Sunday afternoon).   I've had the old fashion burger, chicken littles, buffalo blasts, pizzas, some bow tie pasta and probably a few other dishes.  Other than the buffalo blasts, I really can't say that I like any of the dishes.   On the other hand, the cheesecakes do win me over.  I love most of their cheesecakes and haven't had one that I hated.  I recently tried the red velvet cheesecake.  I was a little skeptical but I really liked it.  My only gripe about the cheesecakes are the portions.  I remember them being a lot larger when I was younger.  Maybe I'm just a lot bigger..... If anyone can recommend something aHmazing, that would be great.  I'm sure that I'll be back when the other half is craving it again.   I'm such a nice girlfriend.... :)"
Alex K.,"Fullerton, CA",3,16,,1.0,7/15/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what else needs to be said? Too big of a menu, servers kind of don't care and the hot food is whatevers. It's 2013 now, why do they still have advertisement in their menu? Am I the only one who thinks this is annoying? It was probably once cool or clever but now its just clutter."
Leilani B.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/7/2013,"Bottom Line: Other Cheesecake Factories are better than this one. I came here last night with some friends; hoping to experience the same A-plus service I have received from the many other CFs I've been to before. We were seated after maybe 15 minutes of waiting, which was a big plus for us since it was a Saturday night! One star for that! This CF is one of the most beautiful I have ever been to! They have gorgeous high ceilings, and cheesy yet cute paintings and props. Though the Egyptian theme is a little hokey, people like me love when restaurants make you feel like you're in another world -- one star for that! Once we got to our booth though, we were surprised at how rock hard the cushions were! Seriously? This CF seems pretty new, how on earth could their booths be that worn out?! It seriously felt like we were just sitting on a wooden bench all night. One star off for that, you want your guests comfortable -- right? Now, our server. She was, um, friendly I guess. I don't even know what her name was because I don't think she told us. She didn't offer to answer any questions about the menu, which totally sucked because we all were a little overwhelmed with the options. Sadly though, due to the fact that she disappeared for like 20 minutes, when she did come back to take our order, we just wanted to put our order in before we ended up spending all whole evening there. When we finally got our food she didn't check up on us until we were done; which sucked because my friend needed some ranch for her fries, but eventually gave up on her request after spending 10 minutes looking for our waitress. What also bothered me was the fact that when it came to dessert time, the waitress just dropped one menu at the table and then walked away. Hello? There were five of us seated; wouldn't it be considerate to at least bring enough menus to go around the table? Oh, well, maybe this CF just doesn't train their employees to be like most other restaurants in this chain. One star off for that, I would at least want good service, because that's what this chain claims to be all about. And now the food, I ordered the chicken medeira. It was delicious as usual, until I got to the asparagus. I took one bite of it expecting the usual savory flavor, but no, not this time. After one bite of the asparagus I nearly gagged, it tasted so sour! I have never had asparagus taste that way before, so since I was concerned about how old it was, I just skipped on it all together and left it to the side of the plate. One star off for that, all restaurants should ensure that the food they cook is fresh. All-in-all, this place is a lame Cheesecake Factory. I would not recommend going to this location. If you like bad service and spoiled food though, this place was made for you! Good luck, Yelpers!"
Jessica T.,"Covina, CA",442,69,,5.0,5/26/2011,"I am a cheescake factory (and cheesecake) addict. I'm pretty sure I've had like 3 birthday dinners here.  Favorite Appetizers: Besides the wheat bread (best ever!!) there is the avocado eggrolls, the calamari and fried macaroni and cheese. Feel free to try one or all :) Favorite entree: Chicken Piccata. Its super yummy chicken lightly drenched in lemon wine sauce and topped with mushrooms and capers to enhance the taste. It also comes with a side of angel hair pasta which I occassionally sub for the mashed potatoes.  Favorite Drink: the georgia peach. I am not a fruity drink person, but this thing is soooo goood.  Favorite Cheesecake: White Chocalte rasberry truffle. Its not too crazy but still full of flavor.  The burgers are also good and the fries are so crispy (all of them).  I am never let down by the food, the service or the ambiance. This place is always a 10 for me.  Only downer: the don't take reservations, but it is always worth it to wait. and if you can snag a seat or table in the bar you can still eat there."
Kay J.,"Brea, CA",58,110,2,5.0,3/20/2013,"Such a great place to go! Everything is delicious! I like to go and sit outside because they have really nice heaters and a really pretty patio area. I feel like you should order something different each time you go because the menu is so huge, but I can't help but to order to salmon every time! Always friendly service too! Can't go wrong!"
Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,3.0,12/30/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory was the closest one to Cerritos before the one at the Anaheim Gardenwalk opened up.  This stand-alone unit is pretty good in terms of attractiveness, but being a stand-alone unit is also its downfall. It's not directly connected to any shopping center, so if you decide to change your mind or find out that the wait is two days, you'll probably have to get back in your car and continue your search for food in a vehicle.  It also doesn't offer any diversions while you wait for your pager to go off. The Brea Mall parking lot is the worse shopping center parking in Orange County and one of the largest. It would take half a day to cross the damn thing. Not to mention, you'll be well out of the range of the pager's signal radius. The food here is comparable with most other Cheesecake Factory's: Large portions and good quality food. I've only been here once and it was as a welcome-back dinner for my dad after traveling abroad. The service was great that night, but then again, it may have to do with the fact that the terms my family used was server jargon (I have brothers who work as servers). I would recommend coming by here if you're in the Brea Mall vicinity and you're looking to eat at a nice sit-down restaurant. Oh, and to get the most out of your money, always ask for a to-go cup of whatever it is you're drinking. That way, you can sip on that sucker as you do some shopping or walking around."
John N.,"La Verne, CA",3,112,4,1.0,2/17/2014,Went here Sunday night for dinner. Wasn't crowded and the food still was bad ! Ordered pasta jambalaya and when it came out the noodles were all stuck together so sent it back. Manager came over 10 min later asking us if we wanted a salad or soup? When I told him we just had a salad don't u think since it's called the Cheesecake Factory that maybe u would offer that after our meal ?? Just sayin ! Won't be going back !!
Joe Y.,"Brea, CA",15,47,6,5.0,12/10/2013,Cheesecake did an excellent job catering our Christmas Party. The event had 140 guest. The GM Bill is great and made the party fun and effortless for me. Food was great. The staff was exceptional.
Stacy C.,"Walnut, CA",753,737,1249,5.0,2/20/2011,"After the failure of a trip that is to Chomp in Fullerton, as from my previous review:   I called this Cheesecake Factory hoping I'd make a reservation for my party. The hostess (I think her name was Katie) who picked up was very friendly and told me that there was no need for a reservation, that I would be able to be seated when I got in. True to her words, she had saved a table for us even though there were other people. We were seated immediately and our waitress, Michelle, was very accomodating to my group. I hadn't realized that my friends had invited more people than I had expected, but Michelle didn't hesitate and had more chairs to be fetched for us (although the restaurant was pretty much packed). She then personally went to each person describing what kind of food we might like and what not. She was very attentive, along with Christopher, whom replaced Michelle when she went off. The food was alright, I ordered the Original Hamburger, and it was like any other burger, but much larger with extra cheese. But no less, it was still pretty delicious. The order also came with fries, that were too fried for me personally, but they came with it so mind as well eat it. If I may suggest, it's much better to get their steak- it's unbelievably delicious, but the price is a bit much, I'd admit. It's tender and super juicy and if it's not made to your liking, they'll have no problem in making sure it's made right. At the end, our bill came out to about $210 dollars for my group. (Plus tip and tax) But overall, the experience was very good and I was very happy that they made my birthday very memorable. Food overall: 3 stars Service: 5 stars"
Lauren K.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,3,,5.0,4/6/2015,"I had a late dinner with my boyfriend last night. We decided to sit on the patio and we had a great time. I feel terrible but I can not recall our waiters name but he was great. Being a server myself I know how it can get slow on the patio but this did not discourage him to give us great service. He was polite, tentative, and was willing to go the extra mile to make sure I was completely happy with my meal. I just wanted to give him a shout out because I know how negative the server life can be sometimes. Thank you for the service!"
Dd'z K.,"Fukui, Japan",266,233,23,5.0,11/13/2011,"To all the Chessecake Factories I've been to, there has never been a hit or miss like some other chain restaurants.  The one in Brea is no exception.  The food is excellent, service is great, and did I say the food is excellent?! We had the thai lettuce wraps appetizer, filet mignon steak and bow-tie pasta and it was so, so, so good. You get what you pay for in portion size, quality of food and service."
Arthur B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,,2.0,4/5/2014,"It took about 10 minutes for our server to get to us. Was very brisk when he finally did come to get our order. The kicker was, it was not even that busy.  The food came out fast, but it was super expensive (20.00 for linch pasta?) and not worth the time or money."
Grace S.,"La Mirada, CA",168,55,322,3.0,9/26/2009,"Despite its name the cheesecake factory serves more than just cheesecake. In fact it serves a variety of dishes from burgers to pastas to Asian inspired cuisine. For dessert, aside from the dozens of different types of cheesecakes that seem to be available you can also have things like warm apple crisps topped with vanilla ice cream, tiramisu, sundays, and a variety of cakes.  My husband and I had a couple of gift certificates to use so we decided the Cheesecake Factory was a perfect place to eat (and it would be free). Normally, I wouldn't eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The average price of all the dishes is a little high for me for what you get. The food is good, but not great. Unless you have a reservation, I've never had to wait less than 20 minutes for a table. It's only worth the wait if you don't have to do it often.  The cheesecake lives up to the name. Now, it really is outstanding cheesecake. There is a cheesecake for every taste, whether you like chocolate or fruit, plain or low carb. Pumpkin cheesecake? Carrot cake cheesecake? Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake? They've got one for you. A slice of cheesecake from the factory is nearly a meal in and of itself. It's rich and creamy and makes me savor each and every single bite.  The service is outstanding. Every single time I go there every server is friendly, cheerful, quick, helpful... I'm just a little stunned how good the service is for such a busy place. Great, I've hyped it up for you. Let's just say they are well above average when it comes to service. The food comes out fast and hot and my drink glass never seemed to get more than half empty. Sometimes I would turn away for what seemed like a few seconds and suddenly, the glass was full again.  To tell you the truth, I don't actually like the food at the cheesecake factory I ordered some spicy crispy beef thing with rice. The texture of the crispy beef was perfect, but the sauce was more sweet than spicy. No, I was not expecting ""Thai"" spicy, but I've had mild salsa spicier than that dish. I was just hoping for a little more kick. I've had the shrimp scampi and fresh grilled salmon and the seafood always tastes and smells fishy as if it isn't fresh.  Randy ordered the wasabi crusted seared ahi. I was shocked how big the slice of tuna was. It was really good, but still just lacking the kick I was expecting from the wasbi. Despite this, I think it's a decent deal for the price.  The decor is great, but the tables are a little too small. Granted, there were only two of us, but they stuck us at a table the size you normally see at a fast food joint for two. Thank goodness we only ordered an appetizer and an entree for each of us in addition to the drinks and breadbasket. We were struggling to find room for all the dishes. The restraurant is also usually a little too crowded for my taste no matter what time I've gone there. All in all, this is a good place to bring a date or have lunch with a group of friends for a slightly more special occasion than just plain hunger.  Picking up a cheesecake to go is a breeze though. There is a counter right up front and the service is quick.  Even though I do tend to eat here, I would really recommend eating somewhere else and just coming here for the dessert. The food deserves a 1 star, the cheesecake is a 5 star for sure, and so this place averages to a 3 star for me."
Frank D.,"South Pasadena, CA",14,111,1,4.0,6/13/2011,"Came here on a date. Food was good, weight management chicken. Kind of embarrassed to say the whole thing, the other was a chicken salad. Lol They still need to have reservations but the place is packed so it doesn't hurt. Otherwise an enjoyable time. :)"
M P.,"Fullerton, CA",1,37,,4.0,3/28/2015,Really good place. Good food and good service. And if you order it to go they'll bring it out to your car. Warning: very very busy location so give yourself plenty of time to wait if you're sitting down to eat. I've been to other cheesecakes where you can just roll in and get a table- not this one!
Nancy T.,"Orange County, CA",405,1218,301,5.0,9/28/2010,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants...but I do occassionally go to them. Cheesecake Factory is one of the few exceptions I'll make because they have such an extensive menu, so it's perfect for going to in big groups or small ones. All of my friends actually make fun of me because I pretty much have the entire menu memorized here, but I'm actually proud of my skills! ;) The portion sizes are outrageously large! About a year ago, they added a ""tapas"" menu, which has smaller bites for less money. These have become some of my staple items because the portion size is far more reasonable and the quality of the food is really good. I love the tuna tartare - the fresh tuna (none of that canned junk) tastes amazing against the right amount of avocado and comes served with these homemade chips. I also love their fried zucchini. It costs about the same amount as the one at Carl's Jr, only they give you a much larger quantity here and the quality of the zucchini is obviously much higher! The pizzettes are decent too - they have a really good thin crust, but they're a bit scarce on the toppings. In terms of entrees, I have a couple of main staples I always come back to. The factory combination of shrimp scampi and chicken madeira is my all-time favorite dish! The shrimp scampi is super buttery, garlicky, and just freaking delicious against al dente angel hair pasta! The chicken madeira has a really nice tangy sauce and comes soaked in mushrooms, melted cheese, and asparagus. If you do get this combo, make sure you ask for the pasta instead of the mashed potatoes - they'll usually let you substitute this for free; trust me, you'll want to because the pasta is SO yummy! I also really like their fish and chips, chicken littles, steak diane, cheesesteak, and the everything pizza. You can't really go wrong with any of those dishes! Btw, they have a really good chicken corn chowder soup, so try to get it if you can - it's usually the soup of the day on Saturdays. Onto the most important part! After all, this place IS called CHEESECAKE factory for a reason. They have an absurd variety of cheesecake here, but I like to keep it simple. My two favorites are the fresh strawberry and the oreo cheesecake. I go with the former when I'm in the mood for some fruity flavors and the latter when I just want some chocolate. There is another oreo cheesecake on the menu, but it's way too rich for my taste because they glob on a bunch of other chocolatey flavors too, so make sure you distinguish between the two if you decide to order it. I know I'm going to sound like a pig, but I've tried almost ALL of the cheesecake flavors here. If you like more indulgent cheesecakes, then I would recommend the white chocolate raspberry truffle (everyone always seems to like this one) or the chocolate tuxedo cream if you're a BIG chocolate lover. If you're a fan of coffee, the kahlua one is also really good, but again...just too strong for my taste - I love sweets, but I don't like desserts that are TOO sweet if that makes sense. I've also had their tiramisu, which wasn't bad, but definitely not like one I ate, which was made by chefs from Italy - so obviously, it'd be a bit unfair to compare. They have a really yummy warm apple crisp, but I think the one at TGIFriday's is comparable. Yeah, so I'm just a tad obsessed with this place."
Scott B.,"Paso Robles, CA",573,253,229,4.0,7/21/2013,I really love the new lighter menu with lots of small plate choices. I had the ahi tuna carpaccio and the endive salad. I want to come back and try everything on that new menu. Pass on the cheesecake.
Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,3.0,9/1/2011,"I'm rating this based on a pickup experience, so maybe if I ever eat in at this location, I can update my review. This week, I wanted a good, healthy meal and since I'm traveling alone, I wanted to be able to pick it up and take it back to my hotel. After browsing the menu online, I saw that the Cheesecake Factory has a 'Skinnylicious' section of their menu for weight-conscious meals. PERFECTO! So, after figuring out what I wanted, I called to place the order so I could pick it up after work. The guy who took my order was somewhat helpful, but told me that neither of the things I wanted were available for take out, which was disappointing. So I had to figure out something else. Eventually I placed my order for the weight management spicy chicken salad and the crispy crab bites, which were both within my calorie budget! Right on time, I pulled in to CF, and parked in their curbside pickup area to wait. After close to 15 minutes, I actually had to call them to see why they hadn't brought my food out yet. They took the description of my car and everything and anytime I've ever done this with other places they come right out pretty quick. When I got my food it seemed like it had been sitting in the containers for a while. The crab bites were soggy. The salad was good, but the chicken was a bit dry. Just not the quality I'd expect. Anyway, I realize this probably isn't indicative of their service, which is why I gave 3 stars. But I was disappointed."
