Nick J.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",446,61,10,4.0,12/5/2010,"A BIG tip of the hat to the Cheesecake Factory servers who have to memorize the menu. It's HUGE!! Rivaled only by the massive calorie count of each item on that menu ;-)  Be warned, people. Ask for the nutritional guide before you order your meal. Your arteries will thank you. With that out of the way...  The food just delicious. With such a diverse menu, you might think they cooks wouldn't be able to get it all right. I've been CF numerous times and with copious amounts of people. No complaints. For an appetizer, I will usually go for the Avocado Egg-rolls. For the entree, I typically order off their breakfast menu (served all day!). It's all good, but I just recently had the Morning Quesadilla. It's one of the ""healthiest"" options on the menu at just under 600 calories and it's pretty filling.  Good food, great service, love it.  Get some!"
Evelyn j.,"Fullerton, CA",0,2,13,5.0,4/9/2011,"I took my whole family...A group of 8. It was our first time and we enjoyed it very much.  I have a special needs son. So I called ahead to try to make a reservation. I was told we do not take reservations. I asked to speak to the manager. She was very helpful once I explained HE had a hard time waiting. She was understanding and I was happy she made the effort to accommodate us. She said we would have to wait BUT would try to make it as quick as possible.  on the Sunday we arrived, it was packed. We only had to wait 15 min. Our waitress took our order quickly and keep things moving which was very much appreciated.  THANKS for making DINING at your restaurant a PLEASANT EXPERIENCE for the whole family.  I will be back....Lots of community love there from all the staff : )"
Jenn S.,"Santa Fe, NM",9,72,3,2.0,2/14/2011,"I debated writing this because honestly I love cheesecake factory's food. I don't enjoy admitting my love of a chain restaurant's cuisine, since it's one step away from calling a Big Mac a work of art. I would consider eating the incredible eggplant sandwich at CF over spending time with my family. It makes my days brighter, the homeless look a little cleaner, and the fact that taxes make up most of my pay check since I moved here not so bad. I have ordered it on dates and tuned them out while I ate this amazingly messy monstrosity and ended up wearing it.  But.. the service has seriously sucked at this location. I've gone in twice (alone!) and sat at the bar and been ignored, when people who come in groups and sit at the bar received attentive service. Just annoying and rude. I won't be coming back to eat in at this location."
Rachel D.,"Diamond Bar, CA",63,18,2,5.0,2/25/2013,"ALWAYS good service, always the bombest food!! Bomb cheesecake bomb anything!! Blueberry white chocolate cheesecake is ALWAYS the one i get. I usually like to try diff things everytime i go but that cheesecake i crave! every entree i get is good. Try the spicy tuna roll.. Not the average roll.. So good and the salmon spring rolls and the bistro pasta, chicken madera or however u spell, the salads, the little order of mac n cheese.. Anything!! Service is ALWAYS on point.. Im guessing they make their own tip because every time is great service. always gotta give good service a good tip!"
susan l.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,750,1646,3.0,6/6/2011,"like any other cheesecake factory. reliable service, reliable food.  cant really complain about this location though it tends to get busy on the weekends from all the shoppers.  favorite things to eat: sante fe salad luau salad chicken madeira farfalle pasta"
Jenny N.,"Walnut, CA",151,191,74,2.0,1/25/2011,"This review is from 2006... Waiter lacks courtesy We were sitting in the outside patio area. A waiter lifted a chair to move to another table and knicked someone on the head at my table. When he realized what he did, he turned to the wrong person and apologized. He didn't seem concerned that he had just hit someone in the head with a chair and didn't apologize to the correct person. Watch your head when eating here."
Debbie Z.,"Anaheim, CA",0,13,4,5.0,6/15/2014,Today is Father's Day. Took Dad to this location to celebrate his special day. The hostess was really friendly and kept us up to date on the NBA Championship. We ordered the chicken maderia. It was delicious. Dad got the rib eye steak. He enjoyed it. Our servers were excellent. Martina and Christina made Dad feel really special.
Joshua G.,"The Dalles, OR",122,71,111,5.0,2/19/2014,Very good ordered BBQ Bacon Burger w/ Cesar salad and 1diet coke and water burger was delicious salad was crispy and fresh and well tossed service was very good they see an empty glass they're quick to refill it they check to see how the food is order was also delivered in a timely manner. 5/5 Great Job GUY AND LADIES KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
Ji-Ji W.,"Orange, CA",2,10,,1.0,8/16/2014,Currently sitting down as I write this. I just received by far the worst service ever. I don't even know my servers name.  But my server has not spoken one word to me or my gf since he took our order. He finally came up and spoke to us actually only to ask if we want dessert. This was very disappointing service considering I work in a restaurant as well. My gf was also trying to more ketchup the entire dinner but she finally have up. I would still come back here as all the other surrounding servers look very involved with their tables.
Ricardo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,88,,3.0,1/4/2012,"I think their name says it all, cheesecake factory. Their modern decor, friendly service,  and deserts are the highlight.  But the food, wait time to be seated, and noise level, sorely lacking! I had watered down 4 cheese chicken pasta, that basically was microwaved, along withmost of the orders for everyone else. Would not recommend the food, unless your ok with non freshly prepared meals.... Stick to the cheesecake and eat at Bj's which serves better food!"
CzarFace Doom M.,"Norwalk, CA",52,48,97,4.0,10/26/2013,"The food was ok, i mean it was great but not really my stile of food. The cakes on the other hand were DELICIOUS! just a little pricey for only one slice."
Nina Y.,"San Francisco, CA",671,1277,1718,4.0,8/9/2010,"My family and I like going out to dinner whenever I'm home from college. Cheesecake Factory is normally my pick because I love their cheesecakes. They may not be as good as homemade cheesecakes, but they're pretty good. I enjoy their Quesadillas and their Petite Filet. It's delicious. We all love the bread so much. Normally, we get full off the bread before any of our food gets there. We always end up with leftovers.  Overall, I've had pretty good experiences with this Cheesecake Factory. I enjoy sitting outside if I go for an early dinner because no one is really out there and it's peaceful...somewhat."
Mr. Loving T.,"Lakewood, CA",74,83,28,4.0,5/24/2011,Oh..... Yeah... The kids chicken fingers are Scrumptious!!
Michael B.,"Anaheim, CA",111,85,6,5.0,10/30/2014,The food was amazing. What are the cob salad and nachos as well as to Smoore cheesecakes. Service was okay.server was attentive got refills on drinks in a timely manner. Who came out very fast and quick even though they were steady busy. There was a little service mishap. Server had to go home for a family emergency and there was a miscommunication with our table. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes without being helped or seen our server and did not receive our desserts. Went to the front desk and spoke to manager manager was very nice and apologetic. Also took a few items off Bill. Also the server who is supposed to pick up Our table  also came out to apologize as well for not getting to us in time. Overall with the way the server and the manager handle situation was very impressed and happy with the outcome. Will definitely be back to this restaurant for the food and the service are always good.
Shelley C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",52,46,111,4.0,8/20/2011,Always LOVED the food and the atmosphere is very relaxing and soothing.  Not to mention all those desserts staring you in the face!
Jill H.,"San Gabriel, CA",54,124,,2.0,6/28/2011,"We were here for a late night date night.  Had a couple items on their small bites plate. Their plates were very salty... I just couldn't take it. I did not like it at all. We had the chicken samosas, sweet corn fritters (the corn was missing), crispy fried cheese with little to no marinara sauce. On top of that, the waiter was just not around. It was one of the worse experiences I've ever had with service at the Cheesecake factory and very disappointing. It will be a long time before I go back."
Iris-Bianca H.,"Orange, CA",467,56,13,3.0,11/24/2010,"So a year ago, my friend and I ordered the chicken wings appetizer. There was still a lot of hair on the chicken wings so we asked to have it returned. The waiter replied by saying ""Well.. all chicken wings have hair"". You FAIL, my friend. Customer Service points and your tip just went out the door.  The management attempted to redeem themselves by offering us a free appetizer. Sure it was nice, but mister, ""Well.. all chicken wings have hair"", you need to rethink your career as a waiter.  -Fin"
Ashley A.,"San Bernardino County, CA",694,255,47,5.0,8/10/2011,"Tropical Mango smoothie, Dulce de leche Cheesecake, Snickers Cheesecake, Mango Lime CHeesecake, Salisbury Steak for $13.99, Korean BBQ Beef Tacos. I cant express enough how cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants! Simply amazing!"
Caesar M.,"Lynwood, CA",8,18,15,5.0,2/8/2011,"This is one of the better locations of the CHEESECAKE FACTORY chain. Again, little pricier than the BJs across the street. But it is pretty awesome. I personally like their selection. If you are there on a Friday night, better get an appetizer. Yes, the bread is good and what not.... but get an appetizer. Trust me, you won't regret it. The food will take some time. But overall, great service (when possible). I am an oldschool type of guy and I LOVE their original cheesecake. But DUUUUUUUDE, the red velvet....... *lights up cigarette*.... yeah, ORGASMIC."
Mykie D.,"Anaheim, CA",57,7,,1.0,12/1/2012,"Can't give less than one star unfortunately.  The service here is beyond repulsive. Waited about ten minutes to be seated. After being seated we were able to read through the entire menu and waited an additional thirteen minutes (we timed it) and we were never treated or asked for drinks and the two tables around us had received services twice in this period. At this point we decided as a group to get up, leave, and eat at Red Lobster next door. Don't waste your time on their uncomfortable seating and dreadful lack of service."
