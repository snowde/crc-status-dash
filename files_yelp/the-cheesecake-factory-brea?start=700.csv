Huyen N.,"Orange, CA",0,11,,2.0,8/16/2012,So a group of us decided for Cheesecake Factory for lunch today and I was quite disappointed.  The appetizer was the only good thing today.  We had the avocado egg rolls and that was pretty good but that's because I LOVE avocado! So let's get to the actual meal... My order was the grilled salmon with mashed potato and broccoli as my two sides (lunch portion).... The best thing was the mashed potato which is pretty sad considering it was supposed to be steamed... It tasted as if I was eating salt!!!  Now onto the salmon well that was also very salty but not as salty as the broccoli.... The bread was also not very fresh since it just a tad warm once out table received it... Overall today's lunch was lacking all kinds of satisfaction...:(
Jeff K.,"Anaheim, CA",1208,940,2711,3.0,1/3/2011,"more like 3.5/5 stars. the bread they give you in the beginning is delicious, and its even better cuz its free!  :D  i really like the brown one. the interior is nice and the kitchen is behind glass windows.   the server was nice brought water and utensils quickly. i got the chicken di pana.  The brocolli was bitter, the chicken was thin.  but the mash potatoes were heaven.  light fluffy, with a hint of butter. my sister got the crab hash.  i didn't like this as much.  the dish was lukewarm.  the crab and eggs were just alright.  it didn't taste like sex.  :( my gf got the garlic noodles.  i say this is one of the best things on the menu.  it was full of flavor and was very aromatic.  the olive oil on the noodles add a nice touch to it.  if you like garlic flavor food, make sure you order this. their portions are huge.  you gotta be a sumo wrestler to finish a dish all by yourself.... they don't give anything for free for your birthday.  i wish they gave a free cheesecake or something.   PS: just read josie. k's review for more insight on their food items."
William G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",46,257,158,3.0,5/31/2013,Try the warm asparagus salad and Vietnamese tacos
Joshua L.,"Orange County, CA",361,977,93,2.0,1/5/2013,Unbelievable how crowded this place gets on a Saturday night.  I mean all over the lobby and outside.  People are sitting around with their pagers waiting for a table.  I don't even know why.  People love this place I guess.
Ahmed K.,"Anaheim, CA",215,164,555,5.0,8/30/2013,"As always, it tastes wounderful. It is true that some workers brings you sickness, but I'm okay with that. I recommend the Salmon here ""herb crusted salmon"" is very very delicious. Ask for extra sauce, warm."
Christa A.,"Portland, OR",424,530,302,1.0,4/12/2010,"Oh No. I am looking up Cheesecake factory reviews and there are a lot of high reviews out there for this horrible chain. Can I post this review to all other Cheesecake Factory reviews to spread the word that some might be killing themselves through a slow painful cheesecake death? or at least killing of their young with an IV of Alfredo fat?  I want to ask what sort of horrendous ingredients is this chain using to have 4 items featured on the 20 worst restaurant foods to eat in America? ( )  Cheescake Factory French Toast with Bacon 1,849 calories 65 g saturated fat 3,114 mg sodium 98 g carbohydrates Cheesecake Factory Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club 1,752 calories 28 g saturated fat 2,309 mg sodium 85 g carbs The lightest sandwich on their menu is a freakin grilled cheese. You would be better off ordering their turd burger.  This one saddens me the most because it is on the kids' menu.  Cheesecake Factory Kids' Pasta with Alfredo Sauce 1,803 calories 86 g saturated fat 876 mg sodium 70 g carbohydrates The website where I am getting this information from says it better than I can "" This cream- and cheese-infused pasta bowl is bloated with more saturated fat than a full-grown adult should eat in 4 days, and more calories than you'd find in 40 Chicken McNuggets.""  Cheesecake Factory Bistro Shrimp Pasta 2,819 calories 77 g saturated fat 1,008 mg sodium 184 g carbohydrates I have a slight fixation on calorie counts and with the rise in obesity especially in America with our youth, we have our answer as to why we are one of the fattest countries in the world. NOT OK! p.s. aside from their horrible uniforms and frozen tasting items they really aren't that cheap for what you are getting and the food isn't good enough to wait hours for your pager to escort you into the cheesecake trough."
Holly E.,"Newport Beach, CA",239,136,192,4.0,12/2/2012,"Great place for happy hour! They make one yummy Cosmopolitan (all drinks $5). The avocado egg rolls were rich and the nachos were generous. I was bummed that they didn't have any grilled artichoke, but the spinach dip made up for it. Definitely coming back for seconds! *cheers :)"
raneeta c.,"Fullerton, CA",31,4,,1.0,10/1/2013,"I came here to celebrate my mom's bday and let's just say I had the worst time. First f all I had to ask our waiter several time for items. Then our meal came out and my mom's plate looked decent but my plate was horrible. I ordered pasta and my plate came full of pasta but like 2 pieces of chicken. So I brought it up it to our waiter who offered to bring me more chicken which was fine I thought. He came back after 2 minutes and said ""I'm sorry but we will have to charge extra for that""!! First of all I'm paying $18.00 for a plate full of pasta and no chicken and now you want I charge me extra? I complained to the manager who was worthless because he didn't do a damn thing either! So folks, don't waste our time and money coming here!"
Rebecca W.,"Placentia, CA",400,136,57,3.0,7/13/2010,"The first time I came here was for dinner about a year ago, and sadly it was a very disappointing experience. Since they were so busy, the eating utensils weren't even properly cleaned now was the table, but they cover it up by dimming the whole place. Also the food was horrible since there was about 2 cm of oil separated from the sauce.  But I went again recently during lunch, and I had a pretty good experience instead! They have a daily pasta special till 5pm where you can order a ""lunch size"" for all the pastas for around $10 instead of their usual price of around $15. To me this was great! Since I can't fit much in my stomach. I could only eat 1/3 of the lunch portion and I was stuffed. Talk about a big appetite.  Although the food is alright, the staff here is pretty nice. My friend and I got an Asian guy who was seemed super happy to help us! So friendly so I had to give him a pretty nice tip.  I'd rate this a 2, but since the waiter was so nice I'm adding a star. :]"
J J.,"Anaheim, CA",295,103,340,4.0,2/7/2014,"Went on a saturday. So many people. Super crowded. However, our group didn't have to wait long because we decided to be seated outside. Ordered shrimp and chicken gumbo. It was very good. Couldn't order any dessert because I was full with the meal and also the bread they serve. Waitress was nice. Only downfall was that the food came out way later than I expected. But overall, a good experience."
Clarissa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,108,38,4.0,2/22/2013,"I would have given them five stars, since i use to come here all the time. I went there for sunday brunch and this time around i had the most awkward server ever! he seems like he was shocked or dazed?! not really sure but he didn't seem trained. I got the french toast napoleon and he gave me my syrup for my french toast about 5 minutes after i ordered so i expected to get my french toast soon..but man was i wrong. my boyfriend and my friends had to wait around 40 minutes for our food to come out and by that time by syrup was cold and my bf had asked the server for another one and he just stared at my untouched, filmy, cold syrup, and said 'another syrup?'  UMM YES!! i didn't say anything but who gives you your syrup way before your entree comes out??  overall i love the food here, but i think they've been going downhill with service the fast few times i've been there. i'll probably be back since i still do enjoy their food though.  For sunday brunch i would recommend the French Toast Napoleon, if you have a sweet tooth or the Crab Hash if you love crab:) For lunch i would recommend the Miso Salmon or the Luau Salad For dinner i would recommend the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane For desert i would recommend the 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's chocolate cake and cheesecake layered."
Dawn K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3,170,80,4.0,4/4/2013,"The menu is huge, so are the portions, and the cheesecake selection will make you feel like you can't decide.  I hate going here for dinner, there is ALWAYS a wait.  Lunch is PERFECT, no wait, smaller portions, smaller prices.  I usually have the chicken chipotle pasta - i love it, just the right amount of spice.  They have a lunch portion and it is just enough to finish without feeliling like you are stuffed.  You have to ask for bread at lunch.  Patio is nice.  Service usually good.  I never eat dessert, I am usually too full!"
Yunnie L.,"Anaheim, CA",16,202,194,3.0,7/31/2014,"Say Cheeeeze. Yet I'm not sure if all the waiters n servers are that happy. Since there are only two days of 1/2 off on cheese cakes, I guess we shall expect insanely busy  line waiting out there. I thought it's Thursday, so there wouldn't be many ppl at 830pm. I was totally wrong. Was shocked to see how many ppl like me wanting to have 1/2 off cheese cakes. Walked in and asked how long it will take to be seated. The host said 45 mins...I asked if it's only dine in to get discount and she said yes. I gave up but walked to To-go counter. I overheard the cashier told other customers discount will be applied also. When it was my turn, it was true!!!! I'm so glad i went to To-go counter. It also sounds the restaurant is overwhelmed by the volumes of customers so they decide to give discount for both not just only dine-in. Yet  I was not happy with the host who could've told me the truth. Anyway I'm happy to have my cheesecakes with milk yum."
Greg B.,"Fullerton, CA",296,114,21,4.0,3/12/2012,"We come here with the family often - it's like the default go-to restaurant when we can't decide on a particular place.  They have a huge variety of items on the menu.  I love the Miso Salmon, Shrimp Scampi, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and my wife loves their Steak Diana.  The kids of course love the cheesecake - plain or with strawberry.  The only thing that bugs me is how dim the lighting is.  I might be just getting older, but it's always a challenge to read the menu because it's so dark inside. Ambience is good, nice decor and colors, service is usually very good, and the overall feel of this place is welcoming.  The food is good and we can't really complain about anything major, so that's why we keep coming back."
Christina D.,"Pomona, CA",13,62,3,5.0,4/9/2013,Yeah this place is awesome! I went on a Friday night this place was packed annndd I only waited about 20 minutes. These people move it's so great because I always dread any place on Fridays but not this one. I'll definitely be returning. I ordered mini corn dogs. They normally come four on a plate our adorable waitress brought out three and said the fourth didn't look very pretty so I'm having them make you another one. The food was quick the service was great and the food yummmayyy
Alfonso D.,"Industry, CA",2,12,9,5.0,7/23/2013,"I come here with my girlfriend about twice a month we just love there hit wings. For starters it is a nice venue and the staff is always nice. The wait here is around 30-40 mins which is not bad. Me and my girlfriend usually share something because there portions are so huge lol. We will usually order the Kobe burger, or the the four cheese pasta which is more then enough for two thrust me. The cheese cake is great just make sure you leave room for it or just take it to go like I usually do haha. So come here and check it out for yourself."
Angela L.,"Walnut, CA",8,25,,4.0,5/21/2011,"Sooooo delicious! So my friends and I were shopping at Brea and decided to come here at 9 for a late dessert. We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake, and man...... best dessert I've had!  The Strawberry Cheesecake is just biscuit stuffed with whipped cream and ice cream, topped with lots and lots of Strawberries. The biscuit had a great texture, soft enough and crispy at the same time.  Ice cream was also great.... a classic combination. We also got free bread which was delicious also. OH AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. We got seated outside, which was so romantic because they had candles on the tables and heaters to prevent us from feeling cold. Would definitely come here with a date... too romantic!"
Jerome L.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,249,114,4.0,11/6/2010,"Wow! First time at a Cheesecake Factory and am I impressed. The food's delicious, the drinks were good and I think the put crack in the cheesecake. The service was excellent and the restroom's were clean. I had a pina colada, soda and some water for drinks. I had the buffalo wings for an appetizer which were delicious but it seemed like the wings had a high bone to meat ratio. The steak diane and chicken madeira combo was absolutely delicious. The steak and chicken were covered in wine sauce with mushrooms and flanked my mashed red potatoes. The pumpkin pie cheesecake had a perfect and all natural flavor to it. It tasted like it was made only an hour before I ate it. The service by our waitress, Nicky was excellent. Servers like her are hard to find and always appreciated. I must knock off one star because we were quoted a thirty minute wait time and ended up waiting a bit longer. Still, one little mistake won't keep me from coming back. Excellent job."
Scott B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",126,121,1,2.0,1/18/2011,"Should any quality restaurant be proud that the word ""factory"" is in their name?  I just don't get this place.  No restaurant can do mexican, italian, american, chinese and fusian well...and they don't here.  A walk through the Willie Wonke Factory like doors and your first impression is that this place is a busy machine.  It is built like the Sistene Chapel.  What is their a/c bill like with 30 foot ceilings?   You are whisked to a table..order your drinks and wait.  Your waiter seems harried and uninterested in anything other than keeping diners off his ass.  You order your food and then..not surprisingly, the salad section of the kitchen knocked out their order in 10  minutes, but someone in the italian section took their 15 minute break so that food comes out 10 minutes later and the fusion area got backed up, so that comes out 5 minutes later than that.  It's like a clown car of food delivery.  5 people, 2 glasses of Kendall, $125 with tip.  Food was fine.  Portions great.  But, never again.  I'll go down to the mom and pop, or a chain that values service above the Lucille Ball like chocolate factory, and spend my well-earned (well, earned) money there."
Nency G.,"Whittier, CA",0,28,7,1.0,6/16/2013,The food was nasty and tasteless. The floors were dirty and slippery. I saw food on the floor all over the place. The waitress came to take the order and then brought the check. She never came to our table to ask us for refills or desert. Nothing she just disappeared. We stopped another waiter and ask him for more food and more drinks! We pad over $100.00 for dinner! And it totally sucked in there. Never again!
