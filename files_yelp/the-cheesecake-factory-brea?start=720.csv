Stephanie W.,"Anaheim, CA",45,539,322,4.0,10/18/2010,"I love coming here!  the food is always good... I esp like the Spicy Crispy Beef... if you bring the food out and you see that it's a rice dish, why would you think I want tabasco instead of the hot asian stuff.. the last time we went.. the guy that brought out the food was freaking asian and asked if I wanted tabasco!  I asked for the other hot sauce.. and the guy was like oh you mean sriracha... and I said yes... but he freakin brings out sambal.... of course this is after he walked by 3 times and notices that the hot sauce has not arrived.... arg!  Other than those 2 bonehead waiters... pretty much the other times have been pretty good.  never really had room for their desserts since their portions are so large.."
Sally S.,"Seal Beach, CA",2,43,2,2.0,8/16/2012,"Came here on a Sunday for lunch.  Wait was not bad, about 15 minutes. My major complaint is that they brought over a plate that was way too hot to touch and ending up burning someone in our party.  They did warn about a hot plate a millisecond beforehand, but that was ridiculously hot and should never have been brought out like that.  Also, don't order a kids hot fudge sundae.  Ours came out looking sloppy, half melted and not worth eating.  Other Cheesecake locations have better service and ambience."
Sally M.,"Walnut, CA",24,7,1,1.0,8/23/2014,"The food was very bland. We were a party of 7. Our favorite, the Jambalaya had no taste and very little sauce. This was true for the two other pasta dishes. Very disappointed!"
Shally P.,"West Covina, CA",10,17,14,1.0,2/23/2014,"Sunday 11am, dropped off my mom, wife, and kid to get seats while I go look for parking, cuz there seemed to be a line. My brother also got off the car to have a cig while waiting.  Quickly found parking with luck, and see my mom waving at me and my bro. Yay, no wait! Walked in, looking for the wife and kid who had seated, couldn't see them (big place), and my mom started asking around and was IGNORED by two busy waitresses. So it end up with us three each going down an asle like idiots to look ourselves.  4 adults and a baby on high chair, two sets of utensils on the table. Friendly waitress with a poker face quickly took our drink order and left, came back with drinks and announced she will be back with my coffee, then came back with my coffee and cream, no sugar. Waved the waitress back for sugar and TWO more sets of utensils, we have annoyed the waitress at this point judging from the poker face growing fearsome. Another waitress brought the table bread, still no utensils. Finally got my sugar and ONE set of utensils, my brave wife asked for another set. I kept my head down when the friendly waitress brings the fourth set and announced ""here you go"". My wife whispered ""she looks mad""... Yes, I know.  Round of main entrees served by other waitresses, handing us the plate, oily plates, for us to put on the table ourselves. While the waitresses quickly turned around attending to the busy lunch time, left us struggling moving the appetizer plates out to fit the entree plates. None of them thought of to clear the table.  Halfway through the meal, our waitress stopped by querying for coke refills and left before I could stop her, as I was waiting for her inquiry on coffee refill, I had 1/5 of cup left.  Potatoes with the two Sunday brunch orders were over fried, dried, and tough to bite. Angel hair pasta had an 1/8 inch oil left on the plate by the time my bro was almost done with it. Fettuccine was too salty.  Monte Cristo and Crab-hash was good, though we've given up on its accompanying potatoes.  Finally saw smile on our waitress' face when she brought our check. I guess she was happy to see us go. No regards on the empty coffee cup."
Lisa W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",70,35,4,3.0,8/18/2014,"Been more times than I'd like to admit.  Always go back for the same entrees, which are usually good.  Service is hit or miss, but not miss enough that we won't be returning."
Chef M.,"Brea, CA",17,41,8,4.0,3/22/2013,Menu is too big but the chicken costoletto is the best thing I've had there hands down
Khelyn C.,"Corona, CA",3,101,35,4.0,10/31/2012,"My boyfriend and I went here for our two year anniversary as an early celebration. Our server was very nice. She kept checking up on us if we needed anything. The food was prepared very well. My boyfriend ordered a Kobe burger with caramelized onions and it was amazing. He also ordered a baked mac & cheese on the size which was my favorite dish of the night! I, on the other hand, ordered a Steak Diane with herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes on the side. Both the steak and the salmon were good but it didn't really stand out. Just a warning, the portions are HUGE! If I would have known, I would have just asked my boyfriend to share the dish with me. We had a lot to take home. As for dessert, we ordered the creamy pumpkin cheesecake. This was a hit for me. I will miss it once pumpkin season ends :("
Paul A.,"Whittier, CA",19,22,3,3.0,5/14/2013,Food was what I expected. Restaurant was sitting way to many people at small tables. Huge wait for sub standard service.
Sergio I.,"Orlando, FL",112,18,24,5.0,1/22/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Brea Mall. it offers late night dining. the property entrance is magnificence. They have a nice out door seating and the landscape is well cared for. we had a 20min wait on a late friday night. The service was decent. The staff behind the bakery was very cheerful and friendly.  The design of the property both outside and especially inside were magnificent. Lighting is dim and intimate. Dress code is casual, but most guest are well dressed. Children were present and well behaved.  The menu was overwhelmingly desirable with plenty to choose from and something for everyone. We ordered the Ahi Carpaccio, Delicious, but tiny in portion. The Chicken Bellagio was on the special menu and prepared to perfection. The Thai Chicken Pasta had a strong peanut sauce taste but subtle and good!.  Warning: The cocktails are way overpriced for the amount of alcohol it contains. I didn't care for the caribbean cooler but the Pomegranate Margarita is flavorful. our bill came out to about $90 with 4 drinks and key lime cheesecake which i have yet to taste.  Overall a little pricy but definitely recommend this place, especially if you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory."
Rohit K.,"New York, NY",26,79,5,3.0,9/12/2010,"I've been eating at this Cheesecake Factory for years now. I go here whenever I can't think of a new restaurant to try out. Cheesecake Factory has been consistently average over the years, and you're not risking anything by coming here.  Their omelette's are really good, but the portions are just too big sometimes. Their pastas are OK, but again the portions are enough to easily feed two people. Their Kobe burger is pretty good, and the fries are just regular fries. Their pizza's are not that great. I wouldn't recommend the Cheesecake Factory for someone that is looking to eat pizza (go across the street to BJ's.)  The cheesecakes here are amazing. Kind of pricey, but definitely worth it."
KIM L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",2,12,,2.0,3/28/2014,Went in yesterday at 3. We were seated in a corner small table. Waited 5 minutes no one came over.  Went to the restroom came back and still no one came over. So we left and went to lazy dog. best service ever.
Kai P.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,165,7,1.0,6/4/2010,"I'm not opposed to mediocrity by any means. After all, we can't all get into Harvard. Now let me begin by saying my main pet peeves are as follows: (A) chain restaurants and (B) smörgsbord menus cluttered with 'Chipotle' this and 'oriental' that.  Stick with a couple things and do them well.  Here's the rundown: Avocado egg rolls- the sauce was waaay too sweet. Willy Wonka himself would have died from diabetes upon tooth- to- wonton contact.  Otherwise, its a fried shell stuffed with avocado.  Live like you're dying- challenge thy palate! the Navajo- fry bread? Really can't see anything wrong with further infusing grease into refined carbs (my poor poor intestinal tract).  But dear sweet baby Jesus, I needed a weed whacker to get through all the damn vegetation. I'm a fan of lettuce, really I am... on those rare DIEt stints, but if it looks like a salad and taste like a salad... by golly, its a damn salad!  The chicken.... so unremarkable I seriously though about omitting my two cents on the matter. White choc macadamia nut cheesecake- I glanced at the calorie count on this bad boy and asked the waitress, ""Is this for the whole pie or a single slice?""  She looked at me like I was boo boo the fool.  I'll take it!  The whipped cream was delightfully frothy but it garnished the entire plate!  The slice was minute in comparison. The crust was a nice firm Blondie and the cake was packed with nuts and caramel.  It was rich! But I completely abide by the 'rest- and- digest' system and I slipped into a deep hibernation."
Stephanie H.,"Rowland Heights, CA",299,198,361,3.0,8/31/2012,"im always  a fan of their white outfits(= pretty packed place. be prepared for a wait if you dont have a reservation.  food and service is solid enough but nothing spectacular. id only come for lunch & the lunch price/portions, but even then, i wish they'd place more emphasis on quality than quantity.  *fish & chips were decent. the fries were whatevs.  *cobb salad. needs work on the presentation; the pre tossed look doesn't cut it. and avocado was two slices while the meat was plentiful. *love the cheesecakes"
Joyce Y.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,85,1,2.0,5/18/2014,Service here is hit or miss. Sometimes it's excellent and sometimes it's horrible. It really depends on how busy and organized they are with communicating who has been seated and who arrived before another party. The food is always the same and to be expected.
Jimmy A.,"La Habra, CA",137,18,2,1.0,6/16/2013,Won't be coming back. The crab bites were terrible. Service mediocre. Don't know their own menu.
David H.,"Irvine, CA",50,222,17,4.0,10/18/2012,First time here. Menu is massive and everything to choose from. They also have a light menu and great kids menu. Try it out if you are in the area.
Jocey K.,"Monrovia, CA",49,428,,3.0,3/15/2012,"Honestly have never been a fan of this place. Aside from the cheesecakes and the ambiance,the taste of their fare is mediocre. Last time i went was for my brothers birthday and I ordered the Mac&Cheese balls. I'd heard about them on Food Network as being one of the best restaurant items in the world. Well I agree! They are so good and huge, so they are pretty much a meal in themselves. I ended up taking my entree home because i was stuffed(well i also ""nibbled"" off the bread and my moms calamari hahha)I'd go back for those but they have to be lethal diet-wise. For dessert I ordered the Red Velvet and it did not disappoint!"
Jay M.,"La Habra, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/14/2015,"First of all our server was very kind and helpful , she brought me extra sauce after I asked her, however , I am  Not sure what happened today but my portion was super small and , I ve been coming here for years with my wife and  when I received my chicken Madeira dish today it  looked like a lunch portion , with very little sauce , and the thing is this dish does not come in lunch size portions.  If it was a 5 star restaurant I would understand the small size but  considering it's their signature dish  I expected more just as previous times I've ordered this dish. I've always known cheese cake to be one for large portions. Needless to say I left hungry after spending $18 for my dish ,  my wife had  almond crusted almond salad, and her dish was missing Brussels sprouts, Parmesan cheese and was overloaded with cranberries  Also her salmon was undercooked.  In not sure what happened there  but Since I have been here many times before ,  I will be back , (hence 3 star review )but for now I ll be taking a break from this place for a while."

Roselle T.,"Atwood, CA",107,24,26,5.0,2/28/2012,I love coming to this place esp for lunch..a couple of my favs are the simply grilles salmon and the orange chicken. Lunch portions are big and very filling.
