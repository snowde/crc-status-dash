Dennis L.,"Garden Grove, CA",9,41,22,4.0,11/11/2010,"I love PASTA!  And the Cheesecake Factory delivers!  What I love, the options!  And I'm not referring to the desserts!  Food is good, service is fast and friendly... drinks.. very nice.  The high back booths make this a great place to meet with friends and catch up or plan out the upcoming weekend. I recommend the 4 Cheese Pasta with Chicken.. off the chain!  This is one of the bigger cheesecake factory's I have been in, so the waiting time is usually about 30 mins on a Friday and 20-25 mins on a Saturday for a party of 5. Dessert, you've gotta try the Lemon Cheesecake....  Not the place for a rowdy crowd.  Small group 6-8 ideal, prices under $20 for most, appetizers... go for the Factory Nachos or Stuffed Shrooms!"
Lauren C.,"San Francisco, CA",169,158,7,3.0,7/10/2010,"For a lack of decent places to eat in Walnut, California, my boyfriend's mom took me to this Cheesecake Factory location.  I've previously eaten in many Cheesecake factories all over California and this one was rather simple, and the food was pretty much the same.  The Brea location is located in a shopping mall, in a typical suburbia setting.  I went there on a friday afternoon, so it was pleasant surprise to see that there was no waiting time at all. I ordered Evelyn's pasta, which was tube pasta with olive oil, garlic and various veggies, and it was alright.  I had the feeling I could cook a much healthier version at home.  However, the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake was DIVINE.  In fact, although I avoid cheesecake like the plague (since I can LITERALLY feel my thighs getting bigger as I eat it), I could not resist the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  A must have!"
Victor H.,"Walnut, CA",0,31,28,3.0,7/13/2014,"My wife and I are regulars and for the most part never any issues. Until this Saturday.  We waited over an hour when hostess said 20min and bar was full so we had to wait. Then it took forever to get drinks and finally when we placed our order.  The waitress came back after 40mins and said the kitchen was backed up, ok I understand.  Then 10mins later mgr comes and says the  cook messed up the dishes and had him re-do them. Ok we are still ok until the dishes come out and there cold. WTH !!!  We tell waitress and she offers to redo them but its to late we need to hurry up and go. She offers to buy dessert but again to late. We were there a total of 2-1/2 hours and started feeling last we wld never leave!!!!    I understand the restr doesn't want to turn business away but when your staff can't handle the service then it's time for the mgr to slow seating or risk pissing people off and having to give all your desserts away.   We normally will go to Lazy Dog across the street but we like some of the dishes here but will have second thoughts next time.  BTW we still left a good tip for waitress and didn't talk crap to her ! It's not her fault"
Joyce J.,"Buena Park, CA",10,78,1,5.0,9/7/2012,"I like to go here and have a few different things, my favorite salad here is the Santa Fe Salad, I prefer to have this at lunch and get the lunch portion the dinner portion is way to big for me. When we go here for dinner I like to have the steak Diane and scampi without the onions. It is sooooo delicious. For appetizers I like to have the fried calamari, made to order guacamole and on the small plates I like the crispy artichokes. For dessert I like the Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple, I also like the red velvet one too. Larry likes to have different sandwiches or steak. Larry likes to have the Black out chocolate cake or the fudge cake. Nikita likes the classic burger with cheese and ask for bacon on it too. Lately Nikita has been having the Farm Fresh eggs with hash browns, bacon and either white bread or bagel. Nikita likes the fried calamari for anytime as she says not just as an appetizer. Nikita likes the same desserts that her Dad gets, with the exception she doesn't like whip cream that they serve with desserts. I wish I had an Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple!!!!"
E K.,"Orange County, CA",1,60,1,2.0,12/26/2013,"This review is based on the sevice. The food was ok... nothing special. I believe our server's name was isela. The service was bad. She was not attentive and barely came to our table. didn't really understand.... because she would go around to the surrounding tables except ours. Also, we asked for NEW coffee....what is the point of asking for NEW coffee??... if you're just going to pour the NEW coffee into the COLD OLD coffee...Also, I wish they would change their server uniforms to black or a darker color. The food and drink stains all over servers clothing...umm not very presentable."
Karney V.,"Studio City, CA",98,309,2,4.0,7/8/2010,"I always order the same thing at certain places I go so I cannot really comment on what else to suggest in terms of main courses. Their chicken madeira is great, and I am one with the belief that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Cheesecakes are pretty good, too, as they don't skimp on ingredients like other places. Reservations are good if you can get one.  Wait time here is always at least 10-15 if you simply walk in, as it is one of the very few decent places in this area that caters to students/faculty from the surrounding high school, colleges, optometry, and law school in the area."
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,4.0,1/20/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those tried and true places.  The place was packed and we ended sitting at the bar. I got the turkey burger with a side salad to try and eat healthier.  It was very good, didn't really notice it wasn't beef.  Then I ended up sharing a sundae with the wife, I did say I was trying to eat healthy didn't say I was actually succeeding!  The vanilla ice cream was good but the fudge was room temperature not hot.  The service was friendly and fast."
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",784,912,135,3.0,9/8/2009,"This is like what, the fourth Cheesecake Factory I've gone and reviewed? Like all other Cheesecake Factory, this location holds consistent to the rest of its brethren. For a particular reason to review this spot, I took a glimpse at the mighty hype that's plaguing the dessert world at the moment...Red Velvet. For this particular visit, it was to finally put to the test of Feeding America's (a charity to feed the poor of course), recipe on Stephanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. Now after trying so many desserts, I think I have a good hold as to what to look for. Some may consider a nice dessert to be a well balanced delicacy. Perfect in texture, fluff, sweetness, and gluttony all around. For others, the idea of having a Sugar Rush the size of 100 Kindergarteners bum rushing you for Birthday Cake may be another way of perceiving the perfect treat. This item I might add was a whopping 1556 calories, an unprecedented amount compared to the rest of their cheescake offerings. If that doesn't tickle your jelly rolls, the idea of whipped cream, dazzled in White Chocolate Shavings a la Mousse', and a bi-layer of red velvet seduction all in one bite. You gotta hand it to Steph, she developed one enticing edible that made me give it to her, for a one night stand. The price of such whore-riffic antics, $7.50 ($0.25, goes to charity; should be a lot more in my opinion); with $50.00 for an entire cheesecake. Unfortunately, I wasn't up for an inflation so I bought a slice. It certainly lived up to the medium of all dessert fans. Sweet enough with the red velvet and white chocolate in harmony, nothing wasn't really overpowering one element over another. However I love my sugar, so the lack of it made me a bit jaded. So why not a perfect rating? Two things, price (could be justified, if they donated more of it to the charity) and the fact that my birthday friend had to consume it while, I was in wheelchair status (P90x/Bboying made me lose a lot of my alcoholic absorption powers aka fat) the night I was suppose to consume it all to myself. Overall, not too bad it'll be a while unless someone wants to buy me a whole cheesecake or another slice of this stuff to make me beg for their attention. Sorry cashier girl, not enough convincing on your part."
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,2.0,9/17/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: OMFG. If you thought service was slow at CF, then this will redefine your idea of slowosity. We had to wait nearly 15 minutes to get BREAD (and they didn't even give us honey oat when it finally came!!!). No wonder there's a ginormous line outside!! I'd seriously avoid going to this location if you have other options."
Kay D.,"Orange, CA",376,708,719,3.0,9/14/2009,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and would normally give the franchise 4 stars.  This location is relatively new, and extremely packed (too packed), so they get knocked down a star. What I love about Cheesecake Factory is that they give you ENORMOUS PORTIONS of whatever you order, so I normally get 2 meals of leftovers after I leave.  Oh, and I guess they have good cheesecake here, too. My favorite entrees here are the pasta dishes.  The Thai chicken linguini is amazing!  It doesn't really taste like a Thai dish, but that doesn't stop the peanut sauce Heaven from dancing in my tummy. Sometimes I come here just for the cheesecake.  I'm not a big chocolate fan (though they have more than enough rich chocolatey goodness to satisfy any chocolate lover), and my personal favorite is the raspberry lemon cheesecake.  I also love the vanilla bean or the dulce de leche, which are so simple but amazing! As a bonus, they also make a mighty good mojito! I would never choose/suggest to come here, but I wouldn't say no if somebody else wanted to bring me.  :-)"
Diana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,111,,3.0,10/26/2009,"Service is whatevers. Sometimes you get lucky with a really good waiter. Other than that, you get stuck with high school/college kids who seem to be too busy for you. The food is decent. It's okay for the price I guess. The only realllyyy good things are the brown bread (they give you one amidst all the white sourdough/french bread, so you have to keep asking for baskets of bread). And the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's A LOT of calories, and technically you only need one bite because it's so savory, but that one bite is heaven!"
Angeline W.,"Fullerton, CA",104,91,20,5.0,6/1/2012,Lots and lots of options. Big portions. Nice interior design and an outdoor seating area. Sunday brunch is sooo good here too! Monte cristo sandwich :))
Deborah C.,"San Francisco, CA",181,173,282,4.0,8/11/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is a great place to have lunch and of course dessert! i know everyone compliments on their desserts, but i want to ramble on about their different varieties of lunch specials at a decent price. whoo-hoo! [when] monday, 08/10/09 @ 11:30PM [what we got]  i went with my mom, brother & boyfriend.  before your meal, they give a basketful of warm bread:          *french bread & honey oat along w/ butter    1) Pasta Special:  Chicken Fettuccine w/ Sun-dried Tomatoes         *creamy, tasty chicken, smaller portion, but great size for lunch    2) Thai Chicken Pasta:  fresh sprouts, more of a peanut-buttery taste         *if you like pad thai & PB, then you will love this dish.         *smaller portion, but pretty filling    3) Renee's Special:  1/2 turkey sandwich, salad w/ balsamic vinaigrette with soup  (OR you can get the chicken salad sandwich)         *this lunch special was HUGE:  turkey sandwich was a good size, 2-3 handfuls of green spring mix & soup (make sure what kind of soup they have before you get this combo)    NOT A LUNCH SPECIAL BUT THIS IS NICE TO ADD:   -Pulled Pork Sandwich w:  coleslaw, french fries, side of BBQ sauce        *tender & flavorful meat, tasty coleslaw & FF was            crispy & nicely salted :D   [price]  $8.00-$12.00  except for the Pulled Pork Sandwich, $12-13 [service]   waiter was very helpful, informative, kind, friendly & knew every answer when we asked him questions. [side comments]  waiter recommended to try their new dessert called:  Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake. 0___o   i was sad that i could not try this b/c i was full, but next time for sure!!! :D"
S R B.,"La Habra, CA",0,14,,4.0,4/3/2013,"We arrived about 6 p.m. on a Friday evening. The greeter said it would be about 10 minutes for an outside table. I like to eat outside. It is quieter too. The buzzer rang only 10 seconds later. As usual, fast service and good food. We had a table on the outside patio by the railing.  A male and female ducks came over to say hello. The ducks were friendly and caught bread pieces we tossed to them in the air. My friend said she had seen the ducks elsewhere in Brea, and they travel around together. I get gift certificates as presents, and sometimes forget I have them, or don't get around to using them. I had a Cheesecake Factory gift certificate from 1998. It was a paper one. I wasn't sure if they would take it. They did. Good for them."
Jenny F.,"Los Alamitos, CA",2,22,6,4.0,5/28/2014,Everything was perfect for the food at the Cheesecake Factory as usual!  The only thing that bummed me out is the bread they give has been changed to a new sourdough. The old bread they offered was a dark bread and a french bread which was soooo soft and warm. This new bread is so hard that it actually cut my mouth and caused my gums to bleed. Please bring back the old bread...it was soooo good!
Daniela M.,"Pasadena, CA",69,108,8,2.0,5/5/2011,"Ok right off the bat, my qualm with CF is that they charge so much for mediocre food.   I do have to admit however that they have a delicious pomegranate margarita.  There's an extra star just for that bad boy. Anyway, we accidentally busted a ""Oh yeah that' us"" and got seated right away.  We heard ""party of 3"" and I said ""yup that's us"" only to hear my cousin say after we were seated ""did she say party of 3? or party for christine?""  Christine- if you're reading this- whoever you are...my bad. So the service was aiight and  the atmosphere was nice the food tasted like hamburger helper.  Nuff said.  I found it ridiculous that they had ads on the menu.  I mean come on, now we can't even eat without having companies bombarding us with advertisements?   Don't think I'd come back unless someone specifically requests to come here."
Jeremy M.,"Chattanooga, TN",409,359,67,3.0,2/8/2010,"Every time I come here it starts out the same... ""Where do you want to eat?"" ""I dunno, I'm pretty hungry...how about Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Sure, that sounds good"" Once I've spent a couple hours reading their book...uh menu... the gluttony begins! Seriously the  portions    are HUGE! That would only be a minor inconvenience if I didn't always feel compelled to order dessert after eating my three thousand calorie entree. A very good chain restaurant. Go with someone you can share with and enjoy a sensible dinner of half an entree and half a cheesecake!"
Mrs. T.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",6,178,12,3.0,2/25/2012,"Service here isn't as great as the Anaheim one. It's hit or miss. Since it's a chain restaurant, the food is the same at each place. I like the sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes here. I sure wish they'd build a cheesecake factory in San Luis Obispo!"
Serendipity S.,"Downey, CA",8,17,,4.0,4/26/2015,"Had dinner here last Sunday, for my son's Birthday. Waited for about 20 minutes, which was typical wait time.  The place have a very extensive selection of food, which was awesome.  My boyfriend had Chicken Madeira, I had the Crispy chicken Costoletta, both of which I would highly recommend if you are in the mood for a great chicken meal.  My son had the mac & cheese burger, which he enjoyed.  We came specifically for cheesecakes, which is his all time favorite desert.  He chose the Snickers Bar Chunks cheesecake, then me & my boyfriend shared the white choc caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, they both deserve to be added on top of our favorite desert list.  The thing that really made our experience great, aside from the good food, was the Outstanding service by our waitress named Jennifer.  She was everything that a good restaurant should have, on top of good quality food. Customer Service, in my opinion sets apart a good from a bad restaurant. Not to mention, we spent less having complete dinner here for 3, than a not so decent dinner at the Yardhouse in Brea for 2, with a not so good service all together. It's not the same kind of place, I know.  But consumers, do spend money to get good food, and good service.  It doesn't matter what kind of restaurant, the concept of dinning is the same.  Our server definitely earned 22% of our tip that night.  Can not wait for the CheesCake Factory to open in Cerritos, which will be closer to Downey.  This will definitely be a choice for dinning in my book.  Hopefully, the servers they hire would be as good if not better than Jennifer in Brea :') Thanks again for the outstanding service & for serving great food.  We definitely had a good dinning experience with CheeseCake Factory! I"
Matt L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/14/2011,"I took my gf here a few months back since I had a gift card so why not. The wait was horrible, so by the time we got a table I expected decent food to make up for it.  I got the club sandwich and my gf got the cajun jambalaya pasta because the waitress suggested it. I think our server came around a total of 3 times; to take our order, give us our food, and to give us the check. So the service wasn't too great, whatever.  The food finally comes out after 30-40 mins. and the toasted bread has gone all soft. The fries that came with my sandwich were kinda cold and gross. My gf said her pasta was disgusting and dry.  We got a slice of cheesecake and that was pretty much the highlight of our meal... So for the amount that our check came out to it definitely was not worth it, gift card or no gift card. Overpriced crappy food."
