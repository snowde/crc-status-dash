Angela C.,"Orange County, CA",227,1627,693,3.0,10/3/2007,"Everytime I come here I have to wait!  I come home every once in awhile to have a reunion with my high school friends, and since they LOOOOOVE Cheesecake Factory we always end up here.   I love Cheesecake Factory too, but this one is not as good as some other ones I've been to.... just because of location and service.  It's located in the middle of the busy busy Brea Mall and the service here is slower than most. The food is still as good as the other ones though!  The things I order at Cheesecake Factories around the nation are the chicken wraps, miso salmon, or cobb salad.  They have some great pasta dishes too, but I can't remember their names.   Oops I almost forgot to mention, try their fried avocado rolls as an appetizer!.. very delish, even though I'm allergic to avocados (I still can't help but sneak in a bite or two)."
Pete S.,"Cypress, CA",474,1401,1557,4.0,10/8/2007,"We came here this past Sunday afternoon, about 12ish. There is a valet in front of the restaurant . Why I don't know because there are lots of spots near by for mall parking. Fortunately, this place was not overly packed, the wait was only 10 minutes for our party of six. Unlike the other yelpers, we had terrific service.  I got a lunch sized portion of Thai Chicken Pasta, I think it was $12.95.  They no longer have the Heath Bar Cheesecake on the menu.  Yes, the food can be a bit expensive, but it's not too bad for lunch. This place is as consistent as McDonalds for a chain but on a higher scale. ;-)"
John P.,"La Habra, CA",5,40,451,3.0,3/26/2014,"This was only my second time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Well we will start off with the wait not so bad it was a solid (15) fifteen minutes not that bad at all and we waited for maybe 15-20. When we were called in we walked up to the desk as two other parties walked in after us however the other two parties kind of made their way up in front of us and with out even really looking at the tickets both of these parties where sat before us. Now I know I could have said something but I did not want to make a seen been with my family. The hosts really did not seem like they even knew we existed leaded us back to our table sat us and walked away uttering a quick word of your waiter will be with you soon. The waitress was a girl by the name of Taylor and she was awesome and wonderful really took great care of us the whole time. My Kids had the chicken strips with fries and fruit bowels that I know of the kids had no problem with their fries or chicken strips however the fruit bowels looked like some one in the back might have been opening up sealed packets from the nearest grocer and putting them in their bowel (not to tasty or fresh tasting either). My wife had a good dish called the Crispy Chicken Costoletta in many ways this was a good choice it was very tasty. I was not so lucky one of the many things I don't like about restaurants is choosing my dish because you just never know what to get and you want to enjoy what you get but you are worried that you are going to spend a lot of money on something you will regret that you ordered. So been the fact that this is only my second time here I always think to my self I will order the easiest thing on the menu thinking to my self that there is no way they can miss this up. Well I was wrong I ordered the California Cheesesteak and it was like something I could have made at home dry, dry and dry not. The meat was tough and over cooked really did not enjoy it at all. Well lets get to the desert cause I will be honest if you want a great desert then go to the Cheesecake Factory one of my kids got a regular kids Sunday he loved it I got the Rocky Road Sundae with House made Marshmallow it was what dreams are made of oh awesome if you go get this for desert. However my wife got the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore and again a huge hit for our family we loved it. Again our waitress (Taylor) was awesome in every way she really took care of us how ever she could. So to be honest with you Yelpers it comes down to this if you want desert and want it to be a date or something special go to the Cheesecake Factory. But if you want a good main course be choosy and make sure you pick something you know you will like and hope it comes the way you wanted it to. The place is loud and looks like something out of Los Vegas it does get busy. Kids will be ok here I think my kids seemed to do ok and they are the ones to not want to sit in one place for to long. The atmosphere is very dating kind of girly and rich feeling along with the price of the food. Anyhow again like I said I have only been to this Cheesecake Factory two times in my life fare warning. One other thing I almost forgot they have roadside pick up so you can order your food and come to their curb side to pick it up I thought this was kind of cool"
Suzanne S.,"Fullerton, CA",1,7,,4.0,2/22/2011,"The food and drinks are good as usual, the service has been nice, haven't had any major problems at this location, just that coming here on certain days and nights results in such a long wait time! I like the fact that the mall is right next door, added convenience for those who like to shop then eat."
Andrew F.,"Placentia, CA",1,4,1,2.0,10/9/2013,Brought home two pieces of cheesecake for my wife and I. For 8 dollars a piece it wasn't worth it. Small slices and way over-priced.
Xandy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",513,162,34,5.0,2/15/2010,"My favorite chain restraunt hands down.... Everything on the menu at the cheesecake factory is outstanding.. They offer a variety of foods which makes it hard to order from the menu..The red velvet cheesecake here is mmm mmm goood...I seriously saver every bite when i eat it... The one thing i love most about the cheesecake factory is their brunch menu.  Every sunday they do brunch and i swear they serve the best egg benedict w/ hollandaise sauce.. so mouth watering, the crab hash, and the belgian waffles =finger licking good. I love breakfast food and if you do too, you should def try out their brunch menu."
Elaine Y.,"Diamond Bar, CA",37,138,304,5.0,1/10/2012,"This has to be my all time favorite chain restaurant.  Food is consistently good, as well as service.  Noisy enough to bring a baby and a toddler into the mix.  Best is their shrimp scampi, baja chicken tacos (now on skinnylicious menu too), pasta da vinci, maui salad and avacado egg rolls."
Tiger L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",344,72,11,3.0,2/2/2013,"On par with most Cheesecake factories. Service is good, food seems a little off compared to Santa Anita & Pasadena.  It's okay & nearby."
Lost S.,"Mira Loma, CA",1,13,6,4.0,11/6/2011,"My only complaint is the wait is too long.  I went on a Saturday night, and so did most of Orange County! They don't take reservations, so the wait was more than 45 minutes; however, once seated, all was forgiven. The Salmon was perfect! The C.F. is on my list of places to eat."
Jonathan H.,"Anaheim, CA",64,172,8,3.0,1/26/2010,"If you like waiting in long lines for an hour or more for only okay food, this is the place for you. When I came here, a line extended right to the door. I had high expectations at that point, only to be shot down by the average food. The food did not stand out to me and was pretty forgettable. I can't even remember what I ordered that night right now. However, I remember not hating it. It was just ok. The service that I received was memorable however. The waitress that served me was humorous and polite. She checked up on my party several times. I definitely appreciate service like that. So ok food and decent service. This isn't a place that I would go to often."
Albert D.,"Brea, CA",6,27,3,4.0,8/6/2009,"Hmmm. How do I start. It kind of weird, but through my cheep mindset I found my love for Cheesecake factory. How? Well National Cheesecake Day (July 30th 2009) just rolled by and my friends kidnapped me out of my house to get half off slices. We get there with empty stomachs and somehow left full. I've had many cheesecakes before, but Cheesecake Factory's Red Velvet is by far one of the best I've ever had. The slice is substantially larger than the others, which you pay the same price for. The environment... is relaxing. The lights are dimmed enough to cool your day down without making you fall asleep. The service... not remarkable, but passable. The price is ridiculously high. A slice on a normal day can get around 8 bucks. With the size of slice they give you, and that price they could be banking 80+ a cake! Normal items are good, not great. Usually for places with high reputations I have even higher expectations. But I left satisfied- a little worried about my health- but satisfied."
Jimmy H.,"Buena Park, CA",937,444,757,3.0,1/18/2013,Cheese Cake has a good operation. Food is always consistent and service on par. Not much wow factor but won't be disappointed either. This is a good for family and friends gatherings. The place is big and trendy and the menu has a good range to cover everyone's taste.
Vic S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,98,41,3.0,12/19/2010,"Service is much better than the Rancho location, however my food was mediocre which was the 4 cheese pasta. The Ahi tuna cold inside; according to our son-in-law the fried shrimp was the best he ever had.  The over all experience was just an OK. Not great, but not bad. For it being the Sunday before the Christmas at the Brea Mall / 57 freeway it was amazingly not too long of a wait.  I did have the apple pear martini (x's3), good, but foamy (?)  Ordered the Cheesecake........ to go."
Todd H.,"La Mirada, CA",14,58,21,4.0,1/12/2012,"Nice day today, so sat out on the patio.. Had the turkey sandwich and salad...my friends had the crab cakes and spicey tuna rolls..followed by being forced to having a piece of cheese cake and they still have one of the best..  Everything down to the ice teas were great... service was exceptionally good... What can I say, nice place, good food, with good friends, a very cool day..  Would highly recommend and will definitely be back..."
Dominic M.,"Anaheim, CA",48,59,37,2.0,7/11/2011,"Good food as expected but overall average. The biggest let down is that it seems that there is managment issues all over many servers will add 18% gratutity on partys that are less then 6 depending on if they feel they will be given a ""worthy"" TIP! That is not cool **ILLEGAL** and Is pathetic i had a party of 3 and was charged 18% gratutiy its an on going issue at this LOCATION SO BE AWARE AN OVERLOOK YOUR BILL BEFORE YOU SIGN!!!!"
Russell G.,"Anaheim, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/21/2015,"It took me 2 weeks to write this review because I was so mad and didnt want this to be profanity laden. All I can say is WOW! Really? We went there June 8 to celebrate my sons birthdays. We brought 2 ice cream cakes as requested by my sons. I checked in the cakes with the hostess who wrote our name on both cakes and took them off to the freezer. We had our meal and when we finished asked for the cakes. About 20 minutes later the manager comes out and says ""so I hear there's a problem with the cakes, I seriously thought he was leading into happy birthday. Instead he tells us that they gave away our cakes with our kids names on them to another party. He offered to give us a slice each, which seems fair, NOT! I handed over 2  $25 ice cream cakes and he was offering a couple of slices. We spent 200 for dinner and lost 2 cakes. Anybody else would have comped the ruined birthday meal, we were offered slices. We settled for 2 halves of cheesecake that honestly may have equaled 1 of the ice cream cakes. Definitely not satisfied. Whats worse, they wouldnt even own their mistake, they kept blaming the other party for accepting free cake, instead of just saying we made a mistake, sorry. Thanks for a disappointing evening. BOO."
Joanne C.,"Orange County, CA",331,662,282,4.0,1/1/2012,"Pina Colada is still a must, but I think they upped the price to $9.50. Complimentary bread is served warm, but they still serve their butter rock solid cold. Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are a great starter, but next time I think we'll get this as an entree. it's a HUGE portion. Pork Chops were okay. Not as delicious as I remembered them, but still good and a huge portion for ~$19. Grilled Spicy Chicken Sandwich served with fries or salad was okay for ~$12. I probably could have made it at home. Good, but nothing special. Wish we had room for Cheesecake, cause the Tiramisu Cheesecake is awesome. Paradise Tropical Tea is good. Service was good, but I think they were short on servers?? Bill came out to $61 + tip for the 2 of us. I've always loved Cheesecake Factory, so we'll be back."
Nate S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",84,12,2,1.0,12/26/2012,My mom ordered the salmon which qas not fresh and tasted old and fishy she had a few bites and ended up returning it. She got really sick when she got home and threw up all night. My sister ordered a chicken sandwhich and also got sick anfld thew up also. The quality of the food has gone downhill and the service is beyond horrible. My food was also disgusting and upset my stomach. Awful quality food and horrible service
Davis J.,"Fullerton, CA",242,30,28,4.0,4/28/2009,"So I've been to Cheesecake factory many a time, I was a long time CCFactory hater, but this one in brea might just have changed my mind. The Restaurant: Seems to me as a continental American Style Restaurant Meaning Steaks, Fish, Pasta, you name it they got it Really nice decor, probably why girls always want to come here What we ate 2 People = Salsbury Steak Special + BBQ Salmon + Fried zucchini appetizer + 2 Sodas = $40 Not too shabby Time for food arrival Fried zucchini 8 minutes, main course 20 minutes, pretty darn fast but restaurant wasn't at rush hour The Good:  Always have a clean interior and clean servers Surprisingly for the first time in my Cheesecake factory eating experience Everything I mean Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green beans, meat, fish, mashed potatoes, even the corn. Perfect seasoning, perfect proportions, the chef did a bang up job kudos. The server was also very attentive and helpful. The Bad: The male host or whoever looked like he had a hangover.  Not very cheesecake like. Besides that top notch Would I go Back: Althoughhhhh I support smaller restaurants, if a really cute girl or good friend wanted to go to cheesecake, I'd drive 40 minutes out of the way from rancho cucamonga to the brea location to eat here, because this meal changed my views on CCfactory"
Johnny H.,"Whittier, CA",0,22,,1.0,5/17/2014,Very unhappy with cheesecake factory they are out of several appetizers including their famous artichoke dip and wheat bread. I wish I would have known before we waited 45 minutes. Not professional at all. Management needs addtional training.
