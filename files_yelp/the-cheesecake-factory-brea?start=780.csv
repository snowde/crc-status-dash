Chris O.,"Walnut, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/13/2014,I always have a wonderful experience here. The food is wonderful and the drinks are delicious. The service is always friendly only the wait is too long.
Laila S.,"Fullerton, CA",46,30,17,3.0,8/20/2011,"It's the Cheescake Factory. I love the stuffed mushrooms and green tea. Order whatever, it's the Cheesecake Factory."
E C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,175,5,4.0,2/23/2009,"OK, so I've been putting off going to the chain because I've always thought that this was a overrated and sterile establishment.  However, it was my moms birthday and she wanted to go here since it opened a couple of years ago.  So we got in, and waited about 20 mins to get a table on a Friday night...not bad for how busy they were.  While waiting, got a couple of drink at the bar. Vodka tonic was very weak and the Pinnaple Mojito was delicious but the mint could have been mettled more and the contain more ALCOHOL.  Once we got to the table, bread and water came out fast and the food did as well.  I would have to say that the food is just AVERAGE but a whole lot beter than Chilis, Fridays and them other chains for about the same price.  But, what you go for isnt really the food, rather the abience and the service.  Would defientely choose Cheesecake Factory over the other crappy chain rest."
Megan Y.,"Irvine, CA",21,126,,4.0,2/23/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, but I wouldn't say anything extradionary. Though with typical food like this I would give it 3 stars, but what puts this at 4 was really the service. They tend to overestimate your wait, which I find better because then you're glad when it turns out that the wait is shorter than expected.  For a Saturday night, at around 7:30pm, a 30-40 minute wait wasn't too bad. The other part was our server was awesome. He was always constantly making sure we had refills when we were half way done with the drink. He always kept checking on us, despite the busy night. And it never felt like we had to search for him when we did need something from him."
Joori J.,"Fullerton, CA",151,87,28,2.0,2/28/2011,"I am not a fan of giant corporate restaurant chains like the Cheesecake Factory. I always call it the Shitcake Factory. 2 stars because I think the bread basket here is pretty good, but you're not there to eat bread right? Any restaurant that makes the employees learn, study, then test their knowledge on what is in the jambalaya has got something very wrong. I'm a purist when it comes to cheesecake. The most I ever want on my plain cheesecake is cherry topping. I don't need Oreos or any other frivolous flavors to try and mask how mediocre and dry the cheesecakes are. Go here if you have a mandatory business lunch meeting or if you are an uncreative unadventurous person who doesn't want anything new out of the box of restaurant chains. By the way, can the menu here get any larger?"
Kay W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",18,118,43,5.0,10/23/2011,"When I'm hungry and want to eat well without breaking bank, Cheesecake is the place! I've had many items from the menu and nothing has ever disappointed. Love the fusion palettes and creative use of flavors.  You get a great portion for the price so it's good for group dinner and share. Some personal faves include miso salmon, steak Diane, chicken bang bang, Mac n cheese balls, mmmmmm"
Leslie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,78,5,4.0,12/29/2009,"Good God, this place is good. I usually go with the fam but when I go with friends, we always share. I'm not a fan of sharing, but when we do, my wallet is very happy with me. So I'll take it! :) We ordered probably around three appetizers and two main courses (the portions are big, so huzzah an infinite times over) and the bill was $7 each! The baby back ribs, I definitely recommend. If you've been to Lucille's, you know what I'm talking about (good ribs). Here, the ribs were heavenly. Fell off the bone and yeah, I MELTED. I'm a meat person, so this was pretty much the epitome of deliciousness. $25 bucks, if you're willing to shell it out though! Can't say much for anything else though as I just stick to the steaks&ribs section. I simply don't find it worth it to order a sandwich or pasta for $10+ but that's maybe just me. Appetizers are good (I always order the spinach and artichoke dip) and the service is so-so. Everyone's always runnin around and it may take a while to get your order. Oddly enough, I haven't even tried their cheesecake..."
Heba E.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,14,4,1.0,4/23/2014,UPDATE: So I learned about Israeli couscous today....and that's pretty much what was served. Not the standard couscous that's been around for hundreds of years - although I don't know how long Israeli couscous has been around. It is another form of pasta - so it doesn't taste bad - it's just not what I'd expect in a Moroccan dish.
Pobzz C.,"Brea, CA",33,37,18,5.0,5/19/2012,"Pricey, but food & service worth it for our special meals or my Salsbury Steak fix ...best ever! Everything good, mall parking not so bad depending on day, usually super short walk we need after a meal. Banana appetizer works for our son's allergies. They forgot my sons food once, but friendly and helpful staff, we will be back. Allergy friendly!"
Alyssa B.,"Whittier, CA",30,24,6,4.0,1/22/2009,"This is not my favorite Cheesecake Factory (I like the one in Newport Beach better), but I like it because they are open later.  Almost every time I've been here, it's after 9pm, sometimes as late as 10:30pm.  And we usually go on weekdays so it's not busy at all and there is no wait. I'll admit, I care more about the bread before the meal than the actual food.  I've ordered a variety of entrees and appetizers, most of which are good, but not particularly memorable.  But oh the bread...specfically the dark bread with oats on it.  YUM.    Also the Strawberry Fruit Smoothie is a must-have for me. As the for the Cheesecake, of course it is delicious.  But I rarely have dessert here becaue I'm always too full, but even when I do, I go for the Strawberry Shortcake instead.  It is wonderful."
I Love Food F.,"Brentwood, CA",3,60,4,2.0,1/3/2012,"great cheesecake blah pasta, blah salad, blah appetizer, blah blah blah would only go here for the cheescake, everything else? tastes like some frozen dish off of costco's"
Helen L.,"Norwalk, CA",1,7,,4.0,3/30/2014,"I have had: the Cajun Jambalaya, the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, and the Louisiana Chicken pasta. The jambalaya and Louisiana pasta are my favorites so far. Love the seasoning of the Louisiana pasta. The gumbo was ok. I would not order it again; I just expected more flavors out of it. As for cheesecakes, I have tried the Dulce de leche, Lemon raspberry, and Kahlua cocoa coffee. All were very rich, so I only eat a bit at a time.  When I dined-in, the waitress kept checking on us."
Ara C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,175,1.0,1/23/2014,"Yes, place has great decor, but the food was terrible. The first plate of bread we got was burnt. I ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp, and the noodles were way over boiled that it had a very mushy texture to it. On top of that, the shrimp was beyond overcooked and was rubbery and way too salty. Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to."
Kyi W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",37,36,104,5.0,6/7/2011,"Seared Tuna Tataki Salad with Wasabi Vinaigrette with an Iced Green Tea. You will say ummm after every bite. If your not into salads, the Shepherd's Pie is a winner. Oh and you must finish with one of their many cheesecakes. Great prices, awesome atmosphere, great for entertaining large parties and the food is excellent. Get going!"
Tori L.,"Orange County, CA",1399,1096,502,4.0,8/12/2009,"I can't really complain about this Cheesecake Factory, since I received excellent service at this location.  Others, however, hmph. The portions are large here, decently priced, and of course their cheesecake selection is enormous.  The cheesecakes are enough for two people to split if neither of you are dessert gluttons.  This is also assuming that you're full from your main course. The pre-dinner bread is good, and I recommend their ahi tuna salad.  Their sandwiches are also hefty and, although you can get them at any deli, there's a pretty wide selection. My favorite cheesecakes are the strawberry and the white chocolate raspberry.  Mmm.. if only this place wasn't so crowded all the time."
Carlos G.,"Brea, CA",1,20,,2.0,3/19/2010,This place used to be one of my favorite spots. Food now seems mediocre. I went for lunch last time I visited and it was really over priced for what I received. Would be better off refocusing on the basics instead of constantly trying to expand the menu.
Grace T.,"West Covina, CA",66,53,9,2.0,10/11/2011,"I'm a regular of Cheesecake Factory. Love their food and love their cheesecakes! For this particular visit, I sat in the bar area and the service we got was EXTREMELY SLOW (slower than usual slow bar service)! In addition to that, we had to ask various servers several times for bread. We finally received the bread AFTER we received our main dishes. Something must've been off that day. =/"
Mark E.,"Whittier, CA",50,26,,5.0,3/11/2012,"One of my best friends (who's a girl) and I went out for some dinner at this location last night and we were pleasantly surprised! Pros: Great food, excellent wine selection, classy and upbeat ambiance, excellent service with a server who took a joke and gave a few witty jokes too. Cons: The price of drinks and the dim lighting outside. Notes: The wait was a con as well but it was a Saturday night at 7-8pm. I didn't expect it to be slow at all. The pro though was we wasted 45min walking around the mall across the way. I had fresh grilled salmon with large, juicy asparagus and a large mound of mashed red potatoes. The salmon was cooked well and wasn't crunchy, the asparagus wasn't over cooked and was perfect with the potatoes. They had some Georgia Peach drink that was addicting and tasty, couldn't get enough of the peach flavor. The server was very kind funny and made the night enjoyable and the experience that much better. It almost felt like I was on a date with how smooth things were going. The only advise I'd give the restaurant is to make the outside a little more brighter. It's kinda hard to see the menus without good lighting!   It'd been 7 years since I came to this restaurant, all those years were wasted but now I know better. I'll be back!"
Ron L.,"ASTORIA, NY",83,83,3,4.0,3/7/2012,The food is very good at this Factory. They serve very large portions of food. The unsweet Green ice Tea is amazing.
William H.,"Reno, NV",19,10,,5.0,12/27/2010,THE BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD!!! food is 10/10...service is 10/10...the cost is 10/10...and the cheesecake factory has the single best appetizer in the entire world - tex-mex egg rolls!!! :)
