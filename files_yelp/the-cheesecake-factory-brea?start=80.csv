Denny L.,"Walnut, CA",542,23,,3.0,5/15/2017,"Servers were nice and approachable. Food was okay. I feel like nowadays American restaurants don't care really as much as their food quality as before. I mean I get it, there's a lot of people to feed but you have to understand that I'm paying 15-25$ for a dish.  My family ordered the spinach cheese dip and it came out like warm. When I bit into it, the middle of the artichoke was stone cold. What is this?!? Servers handled it well but still I'm shocked that it came out that way. Isn't spinach cheese dip suppose to come out hot??"
Morris R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",125,75,238,3.0,8/13/2016,"The menu is super huge, I mean I almost get anxiety over figuring out what to order. When the family comes it will take about 15 minutes for all of us to figure out what we want.  The food is really good with many flavors coming together really well. Service is about average, however, it usually always busy, no matter what time you go. I have been here a few times, and have not found the in-between time. Food portions are big enough to fill you up and keep you full for many hours.  Would I come back? Absolutely, the desserts are out of this world. Who wouldn't want a salted-caramel cheesecake after a good meal? Seriously the name of the restaurant says it all. Is it in my top-ten? No. But that is simply because here in SoCal, our options for great food is endless."
Ashlee S.,"Dallas, TX",98,225,103,5.0,8/28/2016,"You're always set up for a good time if you go to Cheesecake Factory. My only problem is trying to decide what to order while flipping through their thousand page book they have for a menu. This place offers a wide variety of food, drinks and desserts. From American cuisine to Asian, Mexican and of course Italian dishes.  This last visit I ordered spaghetti ad meatballs. The portion sized are huge and the food couldn't taste any better. Definately don't skimp on dessert either, the choices are endless."
Yeva F.,"Santa Monica, CA",41,47,111,4.0,9/20/2016,I came to this location couple of times already and I have always been satisfied with their food and service. The burgers are all very delicious! Especially the Kobe burger and the mac and cheese burger. I feel that their burgers are better than their pastas. The Kobe burger is a must try!
Renee G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",328,417,149,1.0,12/18/2016,12/18/16 unreal this establishment allows children  around 4 or5 to sit at the BAR while they wait for a table and Thier parents drink SO UNCOMFORTABLE  sad and absurd what kind of message does this send we spent over $90 weren't  ready to leave but kids and family so loud and annoying we left before we were ready
Tanessa R.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,31,142,5.0,4/21/2017,"Amazing. Great quality, quanity and Value. I'm obsessed with the orange chicken and highly recomend to everyone. Hello and cheesecake to your heart's desire."
Jeff J.,"La Habra, CA",0,8,2,2.0,9/15/2017,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory location now for years. Mostly for birthdays ETC. I have always loved their food. Usually I get the cashew chicken my favorite. Tonight I decided to try the Factory Meatloaf. It was the worst meatloaf I have ever eaten. Yes I told the waiter. He offered me something different if I wanted it. I didn't want anything else at this point. They were kind enough to take the charges off my bill. I am giving them a better rating only because they took care of my issue. The meatloaf I would rate with no stars. Anyway beware of their Factory Meatloaf. The corn was also cold and crunchy as if it just came out of a can. Again terrible. If it were not for the mashed potatoes and gravy, which was the only thing that tasted good on this whole meal. You can see by the picture I am posting, the meatloaf looks more like spam than Meatloaf. Tasted more like spam as well. Good luck if you order this dish."
Sismanov B.,"La Puente, CA",2,4,7,1.0,4/17/2017,"Probably the worst service i've ever gotten at a Cheesecake Factory.  To begin with, as we were seated I noticed that one of the butter knfies that were placed on our table had a piece of something stuck on it. This clearly wasn't washed correctly. Second, We ordered a Santa Fe Salad and a Pork Chop. It took forever to get our food and once it arrived we noticed there was something wrong with both our dishes. The Santa Fe salad comes with chicken but the dish that we received had none. The Pork Chop was cold and then I noticed that the green beans that come with the dish still had the stems on them, at this point I was fed up. Never comming back to this location."
A T.,"Downey, CA",97,82,42,5.0,11/2/2017,"Sunday Brunch here was v. good, easy parking, yummy bread, good coffee, and lots of good food.  I appreciated that they did not rush me and my friend, and the service was excellent. Normally I'm hesitant of chain restaurants but they won me over.  Can't speak for all of their locations but this one was very good to me."
Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",392,555,703,3.0,6/7/2016,"I've always been a fan of the cheesecake here, especially the Red Velvet!  Regardless of the great cheesecake, the food has gone downhill.  Came here recently for a late dinner and ordered the Chicken Madiera.  It's my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it!  It's still good but not as good as before... the chicken is much thinner and the sauce doesn't carry the punch it once had.  The hubs gumbo was pretty salty.  The staff always seem stress at this location.  I notice it even when I come for takeout for cheesecake.  Parking spots here are pretty tight and it's crazy during the holiday season since it's so close to the mall."
Dustin N.,"Placentia, CA",105,20,,1.0,11/10/2017,My wife ordered three pastas from here through door dash. Two of the three pastas where half filled and one was full. Called and talked to the manager named Christina and she said it was door dashes problem and that we needed to take it up with them. Won't be ordering food from them again
Tom I.,"Placentia, CA",230,184,246,4.0,12/6/2015,"I go to a Cheesecake Factory at least once a week. However, the one in Brea is my favorite one.   I am not much of a shrimp eater, not because that I am allergic to them, but more of a preference. They say shrimps are pretty much the bugs of the sea, they eat the junks from the oceans. If you think about it, that's pretty gross, but true.  With that being said, I would eat them at Cheesecake Factory. I always order the Shrimp Scampi, I trust having them here because I know they prepare and clean them well. Everything about this place is perfect, customer service is always outstanding. The place is always immaculate. Even the price to me are decent for great foods. So why not five stars? Like I said, I think the price is decent.  The one problem I have is that they are kind of cheap with their pasta portion. With a plate over $20 bucks, you would think they give you a little more. Especially when you know pastas are cheap as hell at the market. Anyway, it's still great, but could've been five stars. Tips: If you like raisins on your salad, you can request for golden raisins that's available in the kitchen.  Price: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Quality: 5/5 Quantity: 3/5 Customer Service: 5/5"
Eun H.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",459,528,640,4.0,1/22/2016,"Gave godiva cheesecakes as a Christmas gift to my clients and I received several free cheesecake giftcards here at Cheesecake Factory. So i scheduled lunch dates here so that I can claim my free cheesecake slices! Been coming to cheesecake since 1990 and a lot of the stuff they had on the menu is still there. I get their creative salads (with dressing on the side), hibachi steak (quality used to be much better ten years ago! But still good!), crusted chicken romano, crispy fish tacos, santa fe chicken salad, sweet corn tamale cake (this is something you can only find at cheesecake!) and miso salmon (though i prefer miso cod if they are using miso as a marinade for a fish). As for their dessert, i wanted to try something new so I ordered macadamia white chocolate Cheesecake. If you are not getting a black coffee with your dessert, i do not recommend these. Macadamias are covered with caramel and the entire cake is overly sweet! I think i will stick to my default cheesecake next time-cheesecake with fresh strawberries!"
Corey H.,"Brea, CA",2,36,4,2.0,9/4/2017,"I wouldn't know. Actually that's not true (I've eaten there in person twice before and the food and experience was good - expensive, but overall good). If I were a first time customer ordering to-go food today - I would think The Cheesecake Factory was the lousiest restaurant ever based off the customer service over the phone. I tried to place a to-go order today, labor day 2017, and first off the phone call intake person hung up on me twice or more because they couldn't hear me because their phone headset wasn't working, either that or the background in the restaurant was too loud. So then I called my brother right after to check it wasn't my phone acting up and he could hear me - my phone was just fine.  Finally I call back and get through and the guys like; ""Hold on, I can't hear you very well, let me use this other phone over here."" And then he picked up the other phone, I told him what I wanted, and then he transferred me to the bakery so I could FINALLY order a little to-go food. Then I was I was placed on hold forever with the bakery and couldnt get through.  This sequence in the last paragraph happened twice.  Eventually I gave up because they obviously didn't care about my business enough to place a small to-go order which I probably would have even tipped on. Oh well. Ordering to-go food for pickup is supposed to be convenient. This was a big let-down."
Leo S.,"Anaheim, CA",101,202,76,5.0,7/19/2016,"I had not been to a cheese cake factory in I would say 8-10 years. I would always get the same thing every time, and I grew tired of it.  My wife and I decided hey lets eat her then we will go to wherever we were going. We are waiting to be seated and it was quick maybe 5 minutes the most. We we are waited by Carissa who is beyond amazing. She gives us ample time to order and she even helps me narrow down between three different items.  I ordered the club without tomatoes and normally I don't like sandwiches from places and this one was really good. The turkey was moist not dry and the bread was toasted just right. It wasn't warm it was cool and crisp the way a club should be. Maybe it was the bacon that set it off...yeah could have been that ha.  We tried the Oreo cheese cake which was really good. First I have tried since the last time I was there. The price point was good for two plus desert.  I even forgot my debit card had to go back and Carissa was so sweet making sure I was ok and she even apologized when it was my fault :)"
Michelle V.,"Chino Hills, CA",176,41,24,3.0,8/25/2017,"The food sent my coworker and I straight to the restroom!! :(. We both ordered the angel hair shrimp pasta and ate the hot buffalo wings so we're not sure which of them did it. The shrimp tasted kinda old and rubbery but the pasta was yummy.  I came here for lunch today with 8 other coworkers for two of their birthdays. It was pretty busy and they don't take reservations so if you plan to take a long group, make sure someone goes early if you're limited in time. Of course since it's cheesecake factory, we all ordered cheesecake and that was VERY delicious!  Our server was pretty great!!! She was very friendly and on top of everything, as well as very friendly. Great customer service. I didn't get her name but she did have hot pink lipstick!"
Debbie I.,"Orange, CA",7,104,8,4.0,7/22/2017,"I really like this location. Great servers! The Thai lettuce wraps are excellent. Their grilled porkchop and ribeye are tasty as well. I've never had a drink I didn't like here. And of course the cheesecakes! So many amazing varieties! Lemon meringue, ultimate red velvet cake, key lime, salted caramel and so many more amazing flavors. They even have low carb cheesecake options. Great place to celebrate anything or just chow down."
Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,106,4,4.0,8/15/2017,"Met a friend here for lunch and ordered off their lunch menu. I ordered the miso salmon lunch (sauces on the side) with brown rice and my friend ordered the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes. I usually like to order the sauces on the side otherwise the sauce can be overwhelming and a little too sweet for me.  I always hesitate to order salmon or fish in general at non seafood restaurants for fear it will be over cooked. Over cooked fish is the worst, especially since salmon is not cheap when eating out. Great news....Both were cooked perfectly and we both enjoyed our lunch. Nice atmosphere at the Brea restaurant and service is very good.  The menu is pretty extensive and everyone in your party can easily find something to their liking."
Jon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,167,18,5.0,12/27/2016,"So we went to Cheesecake Factory today to get more carbs because who doesn't appreciate carbs during this glorious carb holiday season? And while the usual Spicy chicken pasta and thai lettuce wraps were always comforting, what truly stood out was the service by Charles C. He was attentive and helpful throughout the entire meal. His service is one of the best I've ever experienced and WHATS CRAZY is that I found out that he served my family 2.5 years ago and we were so amazed with his service that I wrote a review about this cheesecake factory all the way in 2014! HOW CRAZY. If that is not consistency of hard work and great work ethic, then I don't know what is. Charles C. if you are reading this, you are a great waiter and good luck with all your endeavors because you deserve it."
Mei D.,"Montreal, Canada",35,111,7,2.0,1/20/2017,The food is like any other Cheesecake Factory location  But good lord the misquoted time is ridiculous- called at 5:25 place my order and was told it would be ready in 25 mins  It's now 6:30 and my order still isn't ready  I mean 10-15 mins off is one thing but we are going on 40 mins pass quoted finish time :/ it really throws off other plans - wtg Cheesecake Factory
