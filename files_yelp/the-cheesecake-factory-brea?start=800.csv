Kevin G.,"Long Beach, CA",6,52,,3.0,8/28/2011,"I try to avoid chains. But I can't say the same for my family, so every once in a while I get dragged here for some sort of family milestone. The menu is so insanely big I can never figure out what to get, and invariably choose wrong. That said, as far as chains go, it's not bad... A little something for everyone"
Rachel K.,"Placentia, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/1/2014,"have to agree with the other reviews that state the Service here at Brea Mall Cheesecake Factory is hit or miss. (depending on who is working) I have been at this location 3 times.  One time was pleasant and the other two times were terrible.  The only good thing on this last visit  (on Memorial Day) was that there was no waiting to get a table. Long story short we were sitting outside and the service was horrible.  Then at the end of our meal I went and told the hostess that there were 2 people at my table celebrating a Birthday.........a few minutes later a group of waiters/waitress came with 1 scoop of ice cream with a candle in it.  I told them again, there are TWO Birthdays here.  The waitress still placed the ONE ice cream between the 2 people celebrating their Birthdays and sung Happy Birthday and said since there are 2 people we are not going to use their names in the birthday song and just say from Cheesecake! (their names are Lisa and Roger was that to hard for them to put in the Birthday song?) And really, they have to share one scoop of ice cream between the two of them? TALK ABOUT CHEESY!!!!!"
Susan G.,"Anaheim, CA",43,31,,2.0,10/1/2011,We always loved the Peach Bellini's. But to pay $9.00 for a peachy drink with no alcohol???  My 80 year old mother couldn't feel a buzz on an empty stomach. That is the end of my ordering Bellinis here.
Richard H.,"Fullerton, CA",14,40,10,4.0,9/29/2011,"Your typically good Cheesecake Factory.  The service (like all other locations) can be slow when they are busy.  The take-out service is consistently quick, friendly and they have never once botched an order."
Lourdes N.,"Anaheim, CA",370,147,,4.0,7/23/2008,"Theres a few reasons why I am a Cheesecake Factory fan.    First- they (finally) got happy hour from 4p-6p.. haha a whole two hours.. woo hoo. but only a small selection of appetizers. boo. Second, the Brown Molasses bread they give before your meal..i always ask for more.  (You can also buy a loaf of it to take home). Third, Fourth and Fifth Reasons: CHOCOLATE TUXEDO Cheesecake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Tiramisu Cheesecake.  I LOVE THE CHEESECAKES.  i go out of my way just to buy a slice of cheesecake...it hits the spot. Sixth reason (i have alot of reasons)- some of their food dishes..Pasta Da Vinci, Miso Salmon & Bistro Shrimp Pasta."
Linda K.,"Long Beach, CA",187,36,6,4.0,1/9/2010,"Celebrate good times come on-! We love the Factory. Chris L and I celebrated a personal accomplishment today, over mimosas and a couple of appetizers.  We were ambitious, hoping to score a slice of cheesecake...No way! Our selections: The tamale corn-cakes: garnished with sourcream, avocado, tomatoes and diced onions...Sweet, savory, perfectly balanced.  The tasty bits of core were delightful Chicken wraps: Satay chicken with sliced cucumber, diced tomato, grated carrot, a light pasta w/ dark sesame seeds, and 3 sauces to boot - peanut sauce, sweet/sour sauce, green sauce (can't tell the flavor) After wolfing down our factory bread (Warm and tasty), we started on the corn cakes.  I could have stopped there but the chicken wraps beckoned...after a brief pause I created my own wrap and sampled the remainder of the meal. Delicious. Mimosas to crown the celebration, brought our total to $40.   I really miss the Thai steak salad, but so far, the menu continues to BRING IT! Sore point : my teaspoon was crusted with some residue - ew! Otherwise - Great service, Great food..."
Trvlr W.,"Torrance, CA",19,250,50,2.0,10/11/2008,"You know, I really want to like this place. I've been to 3 of their restaurants in California. They all look the same, same food, same service. Not a good thing either. The reason I come here is because I've had a couple international friends come visit and I want to give them an experience of big American food. The only thing is... the menu is international! Lots of variety and perhaps a bad place to bring someone who wants to experience American dining.  The food is nothing special... nothing that wows me. Same with desserts. The plethora of cheesecakes just do not wow me. Perhaps because I can make a pretty mean cheesecake myself.  The service was slow. It took forever to get our food and we got there right when the restaurant opened!"
Michael M.,"Brea, CA",18,106,24,3.0,7/25/2011,"So so, the food was just ok, I ordered an eggplant sandwich which had way to much cheese on it.  Service was good, decor was good.  Long lines and wait times here so come patient."
Aaron Y.,"Downey, CA",53,142,14,3.0,7/10/2011,this place can be an expensive date or a cheap date food ranges price. the food comes in huge portions.  on the weekends expect to wait for an hour or two.
Tim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",321,161,237,5.0,5/7/2011,this place is the place to be when  uwatn good food. i went here about two weeks ago with a firend and even when the place is packed the wait was only 10 minutes. When we got seated they served us hot bread right off the bat and wow it was really good. Throughout the rest of the meal it was just soo good and everything was really big portioned and the bill wasnt that bad afterall you get what you pay for. i would definitely come back for sure!
Scott D.,"Petaluma, CA",0,16,,2.0,1/21/2012,"Maybe because I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but this was just okay. Servers are not into you and smile when they bring the check. The food was what you expect at a chain, and not hot when brought to the table. Salad is great though. I think I can find better for the money. they probably just do well because of the location being next to the mall. Plenty of hungry shoppers who forgot why they don't really like cheesecake factory."
Alice C.,"London, United Kingdom",460,403,55,4.0,4/20/2011,You can't go wrong with this place with their portions and variety of food. The only bad thing about this chain is not being able to take reservations.
Stanley L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",301,367,1614,4.0,9/28/2008,"The huge dining hall at this branch on the outer perimeter of the Brea Mall is beautifully decorated if not a bit too theatric.  The service staff is well trained and the food is consistently above average.  The wait can be long on weekends.  Patio dining is very relaxed and enjoyable.  I love their signature Oriental Chicken Salad but I would stay away from pub fare like buffalo wings, etc."
Devin R.,"Victorville, CA",35,52,11,3.0,8/16/2010,"Aside from the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake and desserts, I've never really been a big fan of the place. I think my problem with it is that I don't quite know what to settle on. Instead of it being a place with really good steak or insanely delicious pasta, its a place with several different cultural delicacies. It doesn't quite work in my opinion. The food isn't bad, but it's really just mediocre to decent. By no means am I food snob, but am I really so crazy because I can't enjoy my Jamabalaya while my girlfriend is eating enchiladas and my brother a kobe beef hamburger? It's too much and my pallate needs to know what its getting into when I enter a restaurant. I usually commend them on their service, though, but last night the waitress- without asking- took the rest of the bread that we were planning to take home. It's also too dark in there and it doesn't help the hypochondriac in me that thinks I'm losing my vision. Anyways, if you're going to Cheesecake Factory, then go for the awesome cheesecake and enjoy a tastier meal elsewhere."
Ana B.,"Portland, OR",811,699,339,2.0,5/15/2008,"I really want to like this place..i do..but I don't. It's really beautiful inside and out , and has an extensive menu. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing? This was my second time there and I was equally as unimpressed as the first time. The food just seems bland..and fucking expensive! On an up note the portions are large..so I do have lunch for today as well..but i'm thrilled about it. The food took a long time to get out ... and it gets super packed so watch out.  The only thing I was super into were the drinks. My friends and I got a margarita ""El Deablo"" (sp?), I'm normally not into flavored margaritas, what can I say I'm a purist, but this one was fantastic.  The Long Island Ice Tea was really strong, but didn't taste as delicious as they normally do. They have rad appetizer specials for happy hour (which they don't call happy hour here because i guess they're to fancy? fuck that.). I'm not to sure on drink specials but I'm sure I'll check that out soon.  In Short: I'd only come back for happy hour otherwise I don't plan on coming back."
E S.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,390,,4.0,5/12/2008,"Short Version: For a chain restaurant, it's pretty darn good. Long Version: I have to admit that for a chain, Cheesecake Factory doesn't disappoint. Every time I've gone, the food has been really well prepared, the service was fantastic (polite, friendly, professional waiters; all of them) and every part of the restaurant is spic and span. And of course, let's not forget the best and most devastating part of the experience; the cheesecake. You must must must check out their amazing variety of cheesecakes and try at least two of them. They are so spectacularly good. The only drawback I've found to the place is that it is always crowded. Always. Expect at least a twenty minute wait. That said, I think it actually speaks well of this venue. If it wasn't so good, would there always be such a long line?"
Liz K.,"San Francisco, CA",8,108,40,4.0,3/7/2011,"MMmmmm.  Oh how I hate that I love the taste of fat.  Okay, so I know it's so very big-box and if you eat here regularly, you'll need a stint placed in your neck to siphon out and clear your blocked carotid arteries, but, that being said, I can't help but return to CF when I'm visiting my mom down in SoCal / Brea area and I don't have any plans for dinner.  It's my default for grindage when I have a hankering for some downright heavy, mood-altering food.  I only go after a thousand-calorie-burning workout and I use their published calorie info.  You can still come out with a deficit in calorie expenditure for the day if you are careful.  Their health management salads are tasty.  Hibachi steak is fabulous.  Blasted farmhouse burger is downright dangerous.  Eat half and save the other for next day.  Alternatively, take up marathon running training and eat the whole damn burger in one sitting ....but see your doc about Lipitor.  They used to have a short ribs dish that we'd order for my mom but it's no longer on the CF menu.  The waiter said it was too expensive for the amount of meat you got (it was a $30 dish and I didn't think that was too expensive-- too bad they discontinued offering it - my mom loved that dish).  Personally, the miso salmon is one of my favorites, but at 1673 cals, make sure you can afford that intake. Then, fuhgeddaboudit and enjoy! :) Aside from the food, service by servers her has been fabulous every time we've been over the years.  Just recently, we went on a bustling Friday evening with the restaurant bursting with peeps.  Overflow of hungry people waiting outside with beepers in hand.  Even when so busy, we were served with patience and conscientiousness -- which is always much appreciated and noticed by way of tip."
Fernando J. M.,"Placentia, CA",160,11,,5.0,5/26/2011,"Our favorite place to eat, by far! The wait is sometimes long, but it is definitely worth it. The price point combined with the delicious selection and great service are second to none. The Miso Salmon is to die for! There are probably a hundred different food choices, and most of the ones we've tried have left us more than satisfied."
Reese G.,"Glendale, CA",99,68,4,4.0,2/14/2011,"Came here for Vday on Sunday and the place was pretty packed but we waited no longer than 15 minutes.  Im going to break this down into categories. Setting- very nice and spacious. Lights were very dim my bf kept asking if the lights were going to get ""turned on"". I am not sure if its always that dim or maybe its just a romantic vday thing. You can sit inside or the cute little patio with lights twinkling. Service/server- Took about 8-10 minutes for us to meet our waiter. He was very busy so It was okay. He took very long to assist us or to check up on us but we were okay at first because he brought us bread. Second time around he took about 10 minutes after we decided on what we were getting to take our order. Came back once for refills. Came with my parmesan halfway after I was done eating my pasta. He literally gave me and my boyfriend like 10 minutes to enjoy our food then asked if we were ready to box them up...  inside my head I was thinking ""Uhh..actually we're just resting so we can eat some more!"" but I wanted to be a lady on a nice little date and not eat all the food haha.  Food- I was in the mood for shrimp and got the shrimp with angel hair and the shrimp was just big and juicy looking. My bf got the Bistro Shrimp pasta which I thought was amaaazing. I kept picking on my bf's food. I really wanted to switch plates but I felt bad for my bf. My food was okay. I was expecting a creamy white sauce pasta but instead got a red tomato pasta. The Bistro has crispy shrimp and it was creamy. I am def. coming back to get the Bistro pasta. We told ourselves we'd get dessert but we were too stuffed.  Although I didnt get it this time, the Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for. Its my favorite cheesecake so far and Im not even a big fan of cheesecake. It red velvet with cheesecake and white chocolate shavings.. yummmm! Can probably do three bites then its too much goodness to eat in one setting. I love it though. Overall, I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Its pretty pricey but they give you a lot of food. I want to come back for my birthday or after church or something :)"
Melody L.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,275,11,3.0,5/9/2011,"Especially because of the prices, this place is just eh. I had lunch here with my cousin and her in-laws. I ordered the Grilled Chicken with avacados sandwich which was quite filling but kind of eh in deliciousness. The bread that they give you beforehand is very very good, good enough for me to get full off of and it's free! The service is quite nice, but I just don't think the food is up to par with how much you're going to be dishing out here. I feel like I can get better good elsewhere. However, their cheesecakes are definitely to die for (figuratively and literally). They're so yummy, but so fattening at the same time. Definitely a guilty pleasure and not something you want to be eating everyday."
