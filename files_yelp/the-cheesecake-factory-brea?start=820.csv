Paul K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,85,4,1.0,9/24/2012,"Like others, I frequent different Cheesecake locations around LA and OC. we were here yesterday for my wife's birthday. as we were waiting we saw others that walked after us to get their tables first. we were given a pager, but there were groups that were not. and some groups were paged while others were called by name. what's up with this?  I walked up to check my name on the list and complain and the girl couldn't care less. Her attitude was pretty much ""shut up and keep waiting"" I kept on waiting and I saw this group of five (that I saw come in as I was waiting) get their table pretty much right away: that really pissed me off. I talked to the girl again, but why would she care? a person that seemed to be the manager approached, but all he wanted to do was quiet me down and move us out of the waiting area. Mr. Manager, your staff is doing terrible, FYI. In the midst of this, the girl was lying that we requested a booth which we never did and that was making the wait longer. anyone can make mistakes. It's how you deal with the mistakes that can either make up for it or just make the shxxt hit the fan. We went over the BJ's in the end. it's a pity that this place has some of the best cheesecakes that will force me to go back."
George J A.,"Norwalk, CA",18,68,22,4.0,4/24/2011,"Always a good place to go. The staff is very friendly, had a great time celebrating my moms birthday - thanks to all the staff!"
Christopher J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",174,591,420,4.0,12/8/2008,"This place is great because they have a large variety of menu options. Evert item I've ordered has never let me down and that's why I like this place very much.  I don't usually order an appetizer because the bread is usually enough to begin with. You might be flipping through their menu for awhile but once you make a selection, you won't regret it. Of course their known for their cheesecakes so try their white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and tuxedo cheesecake!! I can't forget to mention their Godiva fudge sundae is to die for =)"
Katherine H.,"Pomona, CA",22,12,2,4.0,4/20/2011,"I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, though I do feel weary of corporate chain restaurants,this is an exception. Notorious for their huge portions that swiftly and sneakily overwhelm your daily calorie intake, you can easily avoid bulging waistlines by sharing a generous plate of almost any entrée on their menu. Their bread is also a favorite of mine, I love the multi grain one, and I try to to steer clear of the sourdough but its just too  good. Entrée-wise I preferably am very keen on their Chicken Madeira which I'm sure everyone and their mother has tried. Also the Lemon and Herb Chicken was pretty good since I'm a huge fan of anything lemon-y. A slightly newer dish that I've tried was the Chicken Bellagio which was topped with generous amounts of angel hair pasta with garlic pesto topped with two generous pieces of crisp breaded chicken and garnished with two or three slices of prosciutto, really delicious, but be careful, sometimes this dish varies on its sodium count, so this dish can be a hit or miss and will come out too salty sometimes.               A really good appetizer, which I mostly consider an entrée in itself are the Thai lettuce wraps, for $10.95 it comes with carrots, bean sprouts, a choice of three different peanut-based Thai sauces and grilled chicken strips that leave you completely satisfied, I assure you. I also commend this place for having great drinks, especially their caffe lattes which are similar in price to Starbucks but seem to tone down the sweetness of the syrups without sacrificing the taste of coffee. Also their smoothies, especially the Strawberry one is so good, every sip is completely gratifying. On desserts, I've tried the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, which is pretty decadent but I like my chocolate dark and a bit on the bitter side, but thats me. Favorite cheesecakes: Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake (say that 5 times fast!). Overall, been going to this place ever since I was 12 and though nowadays I am a bit more health and also budget conscious, I always come back here when I expect instant gratification."
G L.,"West Covina, CA",0,54,2,1.0,8/15/2012,"The service was slow.  There were only 3 of us and the party next to us had like 10 people.  We ordered first and they got their food first.  What was that?!!!?  And we couldn't even find our waiter when we needed him.  I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich from the Brunch Menu.  The waiter said it was really good.  When I got my food...NOT SO GOOD.  The sandwich was super greasy, the (scrambled) eggs tasted old - sitting out for a while, the ham was hard and the hashbrowns were hard as a rock.  If it's not freshly made, don't serve it!  Totally not worth it!  Stick with what you know and forget the waiter's opinion!"
Alex H.,"La Puente, CA",4,6,,1.0,1/3/2014,"stopped by on New Years Eve for lunch. ordered chicken pot stickers, which came out cold. I had no one to complain to, because I sat at the bar and the bearded gentlemen paid very little attention to me. I was starving, so I ate them (even though they were disgusting). so then a guy comes to clear my plate and was careless, because the sauce on the plate splashed all over my brand new $135.00 Lucky Brand jeans. the guy didn't offer an apology, he didn't bring me a wet towel for me to clean myself off, nor did he report it to a manager. so I sat there waiting for the bartender to see if he even cared, and he didn't. I walked over to restroom room and used the sink to clean off all the teriyaki sauce off my jeans. now my jeans are completely soaked and I'm embarrassed, because it looks like I have a huge wet puddle all over my private region and left leg. I ordered my lunch entrée, which came out cold (again) and not cooked properly. never got an apology from anyone. within an hour, I got an upset stomach and had the runs my entire evening. eating salmon & pot stickers not cooked well are the main cause. thank you cheesecake factory for ruining my new years eve and a special thanks to the idiot for being so careless and dripping teriyaki sauce all over me! never returning to this place, again."
Jojo L.,"Orange County, CA",104,403,241,5.0,1/2/2011,"chicken madeira: mashed potatoes are cooked perfectly with some chunks of potatoe. you get a huuge portion of chicken for this dish bang bangchicken and shrimp: lovee this dish. i think its a thai flavored dish with coconut and curry sauce.  crab hash: this is from their sunday brunch menu. didnt really like this dish that much. i thought my food was lukewarm... i wasnt sure if it was supposed to be cold and warm at the same time? eh i wasnt a big fan of this. garlic noodles: garlic flavor is really intense in these noodles. if you love garlic, then order these noodles! tomato basil pasta: tastes just like how it sounds. mozzarella cheese is included with chicken too"
Vintage P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,26,13,1.0,11/19/2011,"Terrible service! Fourth weekend in a row eating here and we never got a good waiter. I felt like a 17th century peasant for practically having to beg for water after asking several times and the same goes for the bread. Food always takes about 45 min before it reaches the table. The cocktail menu lacks prices and when I asked the waiter he said they were around $7. It was a shock when the check came as it was almost double. The best burgers here are the Monterey and Veggie. The Fiesta Sunrise burrito is horrendous, don't be fooled by its big size.   It is a frozen burritto with spongy eggs and chorizo that tastes like an old hot dog. Todays server never once checked on us to see how we were doing. It is too bad the servers don't care about the guests, we are good tippers. $$$$"
Becky A.,"Los Angeles, CA",345,112,26,1.0,1/24/2011,"WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!?!? this place used to be so good!! did the chef change?!?! Was he having an ""off"" day?!?! WHAT?!!? gdamn it lol Okay... My friend Andy and I went here as a last resort to get some food. Wow fail much? yes very... After that day I've lost all interest to ever coming to this cheesecake factory. Okay I admit the service was excellent but the food not so much... We ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and the Spicy Chicken sandwich?  I'll start with the pasta: the pasta looked great so I dug right in.... After the first bite... I just shoved it to the side... it tasted like the chef just dunk the noodles in water and served it up with some mushroom and shrimp... it had no flavor what so ever just tasted nothing like... yea water!! I dont know about the burger. but from the look of my friend's face i knew it was fail also...."
Ashley W.,"Walnut, CA",85,143,97,3.0,10/19/2008,"So far I've been to the Cheesecake factory at Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Santa Anita, and last night I was at Brea.  They sat us outside and I gotta admit it was pretty warm due to the heater next to us. However, the bad thing about sitting outside is: 1) Smokers 2) Forgotten by waiters and/ or waiters do not return for a long time  3) Bread comes first before the untensils and plates This Cheesecake factory is VERY SMALL so expect at least 30 mins wait to be seated on busy days, and that's for TWO people only. The bigger the group= the longer the wait. ( at least 45-50 mins they say). I had the Chicken tomato basil pasta, and it was alright. There were small slices of chicken breast on top of tomato pasta mixed with cubes of tomatoes and mozerella cheese. I thought it was a little bland, so you're better off ordering something else.  I always eat the strawberry shortcake in the end, and I was surprised with what they gave me. It was HUGE and LOADED with strawberries, unlike the one at Newport Beach were there were barely any. However, the cake itself was barely noticeable in sight and taste, so it was kind of disappointing.  I think I'm better off sticking to other Cheesecake factories simply because it's not as cramped."
Tammy N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,61,,4.0,5/26/2011,"One meal from this place feeds you 2-3 times Came in during a weekday around 5:45, there were tables open but they didn't seat us right away.  We didn't mind where we sat, but even with tables open inside they put us outside. It's heated so it was still warm. They start you off with some white bread and a honey oat dark bread with butter.  The honey oat is the better of the two. For an appetizer we got the buffalo blasts.  There's about 7 strips and its more like finely chopped chicken marinated in buffalo sauce breaded, then deep fried. I love these and they served it with ranch and buffalo sauce with celery sticks on the side. For the meal I got one of the specials which was the salisbury chopped steak.  The steak part had a mushroom sauce on top with carmerlized onions and it was pretty good.  They give you two big scoops of mashed potatoes that are really good.  The green beans were good except they were slightly over seasoned and they didn't chop off the ends. The service was good, not great but not bad. Overall, I will come back to cheesecake factory but probably one closer to home."
flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,2.0,12/21/2007,"Okay, I know I'm going to sound like a fatso, but I came here after my lunch at French 75. HOWEVER, I swear I didn't order anything when I came here. My boyfriend's office had their lunch party here a couple hours after mine started, so the timing worked out. I only tasted some of the food and had a ""mug"" of water. Parking is a pain in the freakin' rear here! I've been told that even when we're not in the holiday season, the parking is kind of a pain. One lady I talked to in the restroom said that she attempted to get valet, and despite two open spaces, they refuse to let her valet. How bizarre. She said that now that she has had two lemon drops, she's ready to go back and slap them silly. The wait for food took fooooooorever. Granted, they were pretty busy but geez, it was already 2:30 in the afternoon. I didn't care as I already had lunch, but everyone seemed to care. The service was very friendly, but hunger pangs cut into that. The food is really no different from the Spectrum's CF, which I've already reviewed. The steak here was nicely cooked to order (the medium rare actually came out tender and medium rare) and the food portions are huge, although I rather get good food in normal portions then average food in giant portions. My boyfriend also got the apple crisp which was more mush, less crisp. The highlight was the ice-cream. That's sad.  I didn't like the way they set up our big table because if you were sitting on the bench area, you had to move 4 people out of your way to use the restroom. With the amount of liquids being consumed during the long wait for food, a lot of people had to go repeatedly to the restroom.  So, for the average food, looooooooong wait for food and the horrid parking, it's only 2 stars. Nice servers though, and at least the steak is cooked to order."
Isomer I.,"San Diego, CA",5,31,38,5.0,12/26/2007,"We have held a Christmas Dinner here for the past two years for a party of 25 - 30 people on a Saturday night right before Christmas. Of all the places where we have ever gathered, this Cheesecake Factory in Brea has, by far, handled it with more aplomb than all the other restaurants put together. Not only does it have the space, but we have always been seated on time or ahead of schedule. They warn us to arrive 1 hour and 30 minutes early to get a place holder in the queue for a group this large, but the few of us that arrive early, hang out in the bar and when it comes time for our group to be seated, it has never been late. On top of that, they assign us at least two waiters who are attentive to every member in the group. There is no need to flag down someone for a refill and with a group as large as ours that means they are staying on top of over 30 drinks! Our food arrives hot and delicious and the bill is never hard to decipher. In fact, they have no problem with splitting the bill into reasonable chunks. The seating is more than spacious and easily accommodates groups larger than ours without having to split us up among different tables. Having had our Christmas Dinner at places where a restaurant claimed to be able to accommodate us, but to arrive and have our group crammed into corners with no elbow room, the spaciousness here is a welcome change. We pick places central to all of us, so we don't always have previous experience of having eaten at them. I have seen the lines for others waiting to be seated here and I can certainly sympathize. But this restaurant wouldn't be so popular if the food wasn't good and if you're going to arrive on a busy night, deal with it. I have rarely eaten at a popular restaurant on a busy night and have NOT had to wait at least an hour to be seated."
Gene C.,"Corona, CA",27,93,,2.0,7/24/2007,"Hostess: Hi how many? Me: Table for 2 please. Hostess: *Looking through book* turns one page. Turns another page. Turns another page. Ok, there's a 120min wait.  Me: Hahaha. I'm sorry, I thought you said 120min. Hostess: Yes. We're pretty busy. Me: I hate you and everything you stand for. The Cheesecake Factory is the devil. Ok, I didn't say the last part. But I know I'm not the first or the last person to think that. The menu is extensive, give them credit for that. Even though it is like 30 variations of cheesecake--my vote goes to vanilla bean btw. Foods eh. But the wait....good lord....what's wrong with you people??? And who says 120min? Don't you just say 2 hours? Or does that sound worse? Actually, that does sound worse. Can I get a Fast Pass and come back later?"
Paige N.,"Orange, CA",23,24,5,1.0,1/19/2011,"I've always liked cheesecake factory but this location have horrible service.  I was here once and I don't want to go back.  We came in around 11 to avoid the lunch rush.  After we were seated it took the server forever to get our drinks.  Since it was a cold and rainy day I wanted some hot water to warm up first and our server told us that she doesn't think they have lemon or honey but she'll check....  Are you kidding me?!  It's not like it was late at night where your inventory would run out already. Five minutes or so later she came back with a cup of warm water and said she'll try to find some honey or lemon.  Another 10 mins+ or so passes and she came back with some lemon.  More time passes, by now the water is getting pretty close to room temp and she came back with some honey.  She really have no excuse for taking that long since there were barely that many people in there.    Our waitress came back, took our order and said she'll bring out some bread for us in a bit because she's waiting for the fresh hot batch. Customers start to slowly come in and were seated to both sides of us (we were sitting in the row of booths that were facing the bar).  Their server came with their drinks AND the bread basket before us!!!  We sat and waited for a while and she finally came back with a bread basket.  At this point, we thought maybe she went off and took a break without telling us about it.  Was it hot and fresh out of the oven like she claimed it would be?! ABOSLUTELY NOT!!!  it was COLD!!  At this point we were getting pretty irritated.  We had to ask a different waiter to get us a basket of bread that are actually hot or at least warm.  This waiter was kind of enough to do so for us and did so pretty quickly.   All the waiting and what not pretty much ruined the meal for us.  Did we wanted to leave a tip? Heck no!! but did we? Yes we did give her the 15%...  did she deserved it?! ABSOLUTELY NOT.  We were seriously thinking of getting of name down and file a complaint.  I guess it's her lucky day.  Would I want to come back to this location and get the horrible service? ... Probably not."
Grace H.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,42,2,4.0,12/1/2010,"the cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants ever. when i'm craving an all around great place to eat, it's the cheesecake factory. which was why i was soo happy when this one opened in brea several years back, because before then, i had been going down to fashion island to enjoy their delicious entrees! my must haves: - avocado eggrolls - thai lettuce wraps these dishes are so unique and have flavors you can't find at any other restaurant, in my opinion. makes it special and unique, which is great~! and of course, i ask for more of their brown bread. soo goodddd. oh, and when i'm feeling extra special, i get a virgin pina colada. also, soo gooodddd :) just can't give 5 stars because service is sometimes just ok, depending on our server. great place to go with friends & family. will continue coming back!"
Jimmy N.,"Anaheim, CA",28,8,,3.0,12/24/2009,"The food here is decent! Service was great, but a little complicated at the beginning with our seating. We had a party of 10, but they gave us a table that only seated 8!  The waiter bounced us back and forth about a couple of times, until we got a little irritated with them. In the end they did give us 6 free plates of appetizers which made up for it! =)"
lisa f.,"Walnut, CA",1,68,2,5.0,12/9/2012,"I recently had an exceptional service at the Brea location. I told the hostess that I had a party of 12 for an 8 pm dinner. I was a little hesitant to have this holiday get together at Cheesecake Factory because I know it can get busy. It was difficult because it was a big party and during the holiday season. I was quoted a wait time of 45 minutes. My party and I patiently waited. When the time reached closer for us to get our table we were told that it was going to be about 10 minutes more; however, the manager made a mistake. He quickly came over and apologized for telling us that it was sooner than he thought. He came to us twice to give us an update on our table. He could have not told us anything and make us wait longer. He personally walked us to our table and gave us some free appetizers for waiting. There was a table next to us that opened up as soon as we sat down and the manager insisted that we spread out more and brought the table closer to us. It was great. The chef came out and brought out our appetizers and even checked on us during our meal to make sure everything was tasty. The manager also checked up on us during our meal. I will definitely visit this location again and no longer be hesitant about planning dinners for large parties at the Brea location. My party of 11 as well as myself was truly taken aback by the customer service at this Brea location. This is something that is a rarity especially with large parties and during the holiday season. This location is a 10!!! Jason Smith was the manager who helped us."
Ryan T.,"San Marcos, CA",183,134,3,3.0,1/12/2008,"If you go here on a Friday/Saturday night you will have to wait, sometimes an hour for just two people.  The trick is to go at the bar (that is if you don't mind eating at the bar) the wait was only five minutes and you can order anything from the menu. I've eaten at Cheesecake many times often for birthdays with a huge party.  Nothing really impresses me with the place I feel like all their foods are good but not great...I did enjoy the ahi tempura roll last night which was surprisingly good but their salmon was bit dry and the steak (I ordered it rare) was over cooked.  I've had their pastas before and they are pretty good.  In the end I know I'll be going back to this place since someone will want to eat here for their birthday. There are worse things in life."
Lex G.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,37,,5.0,8/19/2010,Chicken Piccata is a must!!! The restaurant is always so pretty :) romantic! My boyfriend and I love this place.
