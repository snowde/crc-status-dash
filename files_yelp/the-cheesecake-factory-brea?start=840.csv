Julie T.,"Lakewood, CA",110,224,5,4.0,5/24/2008,"Part two of my sister-in-law's birthday: seventeen of us went for dinner tonight, and had a pretty swell time. We had to wait a while (Memorial weekend, and prom night for many), and we were finally seated outside, which was fine. I had the barbeque ranch chicken salad, which comes with onion rings on top instead of croutons, and was enormous. Hubby had the spicy crispy beef, and ate every bite (except the bite I took - it was delicious!).  Their bread basket contains both warm sourdough and pumpernickel, and is wonderful.  The cheesecake was the only thing that I was a bit disappointed with; my husband had the tiramisu cheesecake, and neither of us was thrilled with it (yes, I had a bite, are you surprised, really?).  It had a shot of mocha whipped cream on top, which really didn't add much to the taste.  I will say that the service was very good; some restaurants are overwhelmed when serving large parties, but Cheesecake Factory isn't one of them.  We have come here before for celebrations, and have always been satisfied."
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,351,,3.0,7/16/2009,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located adjacent to the Brea Mall -- near the intersection of Imperial Highway and State College Blvd. I have found the food and service at this Cheesecake Factory to be consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Personally, my three favorite entrées are the Grilled Pork Chops, Beef Ribs, and Miso Salmon. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite of the appetizers. Generally, service at this location is much better when compared to its Rancho Cucamonga location."
Cynthia W.,"Downey, CA",66,122,52,3.0,6/13/2010,My food was very tasty! I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and red velvet cheesecake. The service was good after our real waiter was back from break.
Brian K.,"La Mirada, CA",19,5,,1.0,2/18/2011,"After waiting for our table for an hour, standing in an aisle way because there are too many other people also waiting for their tables, we finally got sat.  Oh yeah, i forgot to mention that i was only able to order one drink at the bar at a time, so i got to buy my wife's drink.,go deliver it to her since there is absolutely no way to maneuver a stroller through the bar there, then return and pay again for my drink. Anyway, about 20 minutes after we ordered, an expo came out and asked if it was me who ordered the shrimp pasta. I said no, i ordered the chicken and biscuits - which were subpar at best. The expo looked confused, walked away, then returned to tell me he thinks my order may have been deleted but i would probably be ok and my food would come out on time with everyone else's. My plate arrived 15 minutes after the first plate at our table was set down. I didn't complain because i know that won't solve anything except get me more fired up. So i tell you all, cheesecake factory is too busy for its own good. It's overpriced, its food is nothing to scream about, and its customers are easily forgotten in its madness. They gave us a $7 dessert for messing up a $16 entree. Not an even trade in my opinion.  If there was a way to give zero stars, I would."
Marc P.,"Oakland, CA",50,127,21,3.0,12/22/2007,"Cheesecake Factory. The Southern California treat. I would not dare step foot into a CF in the Bay Area for fear that I would be tarred and feathered upon leaving. However, in Southern Cal, it's different. Perhaps it's because Cheesecake Factory has history for me. Perhaps it's because there's nothing better that's easily accessible. Perhaps it's because the Southern Cal thing to do.  When I go, I always get the same thing --- the stuffed chicken tortillas. Good enough, I guess, though I feel guilty always getting the same thing. It's like buying a cassette tape for that one song.  Don't tell my friends up North that I eat at Cheesecake Factory. They may take away my Yelping privileges.  Alas."
H L.,"Fullerton, CA",0,25,,2.0,3/18/2013,"you never know how it's going to go at this location. I'm not sure if it's the location, transition in staffing, or what, but it seems to be very good or very bad here. Inconsistent in food and service. I have had okay pasta and meat here with good service, then on other ocassions it has been just awful. I would say skip this place because it is too frustrating."
Jenny M.,"Orange County, CA",61,98,153,5.0,3/13/2010,Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant chain! I hate that there's always a wait of at least 30 minutes no matter which CF I'm at but their food is soooooo damn good. My favorite dishes would be the Farfalle pasta (yummmy!!) and herb crusted filet of salmon. I seriously have cravings for the farfalle every couple of weeks. I also looove their pumpernickel bread!
Jenn L.,"Cypress, CA",341,897,684,5.0,5/20/2008,"wow... where do i start?? i've been coming here every single month.... ever since late 2005. i know like all the cheesecakes & food there... my most favorite pasta was the sheila's new orleans pasta.. but they have discontinued it. *sad face* hm..  CHEESECAKES: i highly recommend the dulce de leche cheesecake (if you're a caramel fan),  vanilla bean cheesecake,  fresh banana cream cheesecake, adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake. APPETIZER: highly highly recommend: tex mex rolls!! fire cracker salmon rolls, thai lettuce wraps, spicy ahi  tempura rolls, crispy crab wontons. BURGER: the KOBE burger.. most tender & juicy DESSERT: fresh strawberry shortcake.. you can never go wrong with that. BEVERAGE: strawberry fruit smoothie, it's a must-have. heh..heh.. all the other pastas/specialties were good.. but not good enough to be on my top list. ENJOY."
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,141,7,2.0,8/19/2012,"I normally love the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is my least favorite. It is really crowded and the food here seems to be much worse than the other locations. The nachos were terrible and so was the Santa Fe salad. The service here isn't so great either. Won't be coming back to this one.."
Caroline L.,"Fullerton, CA",38,131,2,4.0,2/25/2010,"the cheesecake factory big portions, kiinda pricy, crowded, loud, but definitely tasty. i haven't liked Everything i ordered but i never hated anything.  my typical fare at cheesecake would be: brown bread and butter (appetizer bread). SO GOOD strawberry lemonade! Thai Lettuce Wraps. They are Delicious. so fresh. all the veggies are fresheroonie! i love butter lettuce. it's good. annnnnnd. the 3 sauces it comes with??? WOWZA.  i know u could probably make this at home if u had time to wash and chop everything but it defnitely makes for a great meal, not just an appetizer. just be careful, it can get messy cuz of the sauces and the water in the veggies. but its definitely healthy! Miso Salmon.  Wow... i love miso sea bass, and sea bass is an expensive dish, but when i tried the miso salmon i realized that its the miso sweet glaze that really brings out a nice flavor out of fish in general.  plus they put it on this huge thing of white rice which at first seems whatever but it has this cream all over it, and around the dish, and it's just like.. melt in your mouth.  it's So good.  i looooooooooooooove it. when it's in season: BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE. its' like their white chocolate raspberry one, but sometimes they'll have a blueberry cheesecake and its simply the best ever. like .. i got it one day and every week i was like.. should i drop by and get a slice? just sit in and have a slice? i told all my friends but every time i thought about it i felt Guilty! how can u eat a slice of cheesecake every week? sigh....... **Plus i've always wanted to go for sunday brunch or something, but i have church! :) i think it'd be a really cute place for breakfast/brunch on the patio. also, i've seen the menu and it sounds delicious!"
jimmy j.,"Chino, CA",1,25,11,3.0,8/16/2010,"HMMMM.... The food is alright and overpriced. WHY?! I go here for a fancy dinner date or anything fancy. But, it is definitely not the best. I'd go back if I have another fancy date, but I would not want to spend my money here for no reason."
Elaine L.,"Oakland, CA",41,137,4,3.0,2/25/2009,"I know, I know, Cheesecake Factory is EVERYWHERE! My friends and I ate here after shopping and just needed a place with good drinks and decent food. I always enjoy their Tuna Tataki Salad and we actually ordered their Anniversary Cheesecake. It was layers or chocolate cheesecake over regular cheesecake and I have to tell you that I've never noticed how creamy their cheesecake is! Delicious! Oh, the Wild Horse Pinot Noir was good too."
Kat S.,"Cerritos, CA",446,105,,2.0,12/22/2008,"i'm going to give them two star without even eating there.   WHY?  CUZ I MOTHERF**KING WAITED for more than an hour and couldn't get seated and had to spent the hour surrounded by ignorant people trying to look hip, teenagers trying to talk big and stupid date trying to act all teacher-ish.  Below goes the conversation: Kat says:  that girl got a nice coat! (shivers in her sweater jacket) Date: ..... Kat still tries to come up with a conversation: that must cost a bundle Date:  you women are always paying attention to the appearance and paying unnecessary  money. Date continues:  don't u know its not the appearance that matters, but what's in your heart?  Face will change, but your heart is what stays the same. Kat:  (OH ~MY~ FRIGGING~ GOD!!!!  ) daddy, i've learned this when i was 4!! and don't tell me appearance don't matter!  your a$$ wouldn't be standing here next to ME if you believed half what you just said.  go ask some 500-lb gaudy looking woman with pink tights out next time!   yes, i'm a bitch, and yes, i need to vent on yelp!"
Madelyn T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",8,157,8,3.0,3/8/2010,"I've been coming to this location for years now.  Come on you got to love their cheesecake!!  Red velvet, YUMMY!  Atmosphere and service has been great.  My only complaint is everytime my hubby and I order our regular pasta entries it's always SALTY!  This happened 3 times.  The waitress had to replace it a few times.  They said it's because the person in charge of stirring the noodles doesn't do the job well.  Well hello?  This doesn't stop me from coming though!"
Monique R.,"Whittier, CA",6,15,,4.0,1/3/2009,"Cheesecake as been one of my favorite restaurants just because of the vastness of the menu.  I too absolutely love their cheesecake, banana cream to be exact, it is like an orgasm on a slice of  tender pie crust.  I recently went and had the wasabi crusted ah tuna on a bed of white rice and this delicious sauce surrounding it all.  It was really, really, good.  My friend had the rib eye and although he claimed it was on the small side he loved it.  I loved it too (I tend to pick off people's plates) because it was tender and juicy and just the right shade of pink.  Oh, I almost forgot the scrumptious clam chowder we started off with--yummy!   The service was good and prompt, no attitude, no rush.  I've been to a few different Cheesecake's and have not had one bad experience ever. The only down fall is the wait.  We were informed at the Brea location that our wait would be between 15-30 minutes, it was more like 35!  But that's the case in most restaurants these days. . . wait, aren't we supposed  to be in a recession?"
Tara F.,"Brea, CA",7,68,17,4.0,3/24/2010,I love love love the Shrimp Scampi. If you're a garlic lover this is for you. The key lime cheesecake is my favorite. The service is good. The only downers for this place is they are always packed and have a long wait and they don't have enough seating while you're waiting.
Pam A.,"Alta Loma, CA",4,69,2,1.0,1/31/2012,"I had a veggie salad a few weeks ago (skinny menu) at the Rancho CF, and it was amazing.  Ordered it tonight at Brea, and it was just gross, all pushed down into a ball, and it tasted old! I didn't even eat half of it.  The dining room service wasn't good, either; everyone's plates just looked disappointing."
Angie P.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/16/2012,"So one of my most favorite luxiourious restaurants is indeed the Cheescake Factory. The food is great, but it takes a while for the food to come out. The waiters and waitresses are very polite. Totally reccomend."
Natalie C.,"Fullerton, CA",96,35,4,3.0,1/14/2009,"It's true, this place is super packed especially on the weekends. You'll end up waiting about 30 min - 1 hour. I got there at 6:45pm and was told the wait would be 25 min but we were seated at 7:30. The service is slow and they bring the food randomly so that some people get their dishes before others at the table. That gets a little awkward because usually people like to eat together. The place is nice but the food and service are just mediocre. The only thing that brings me back to this place is the cheesecake. It's that good. It's the only reason why I gave this place 3 stars."
Elaine S.,"Pomona, CA",36,22,3,4.0,1/26/2012,"for a sat, night my husband and i did not have a long wait. but the place was so crowded and loud we could not really enjoy eachother company!! maybe next time but the food was off the hook!!"
