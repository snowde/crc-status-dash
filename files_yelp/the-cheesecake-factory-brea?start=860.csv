Ella M.,"Corona, CA",95,185,271,4.0,9/5/2009,"My bff Julie took me for my very first Cheesecake factory experience. And the result is good. We went to the one in Brea since it was close by to us at the time. I love their passion fruit iced tea with the liquid sweeter. Then I ordered Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The pasta was done ""Al dente"", the shrimp very tasty and the sauce was heavenly. I forget to mention that they do give you bread and butter as a starter. I'm going to definitely keep coming back to this place, cause of the service they provide you."
Patty P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",98,56,11,4.0,4/26/2011,mmmm cheeeesecake! love the oreo cheesecake! definitely pricey!
Chris L.,"West Covina, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/25/2010,"Christa M..... you are an idiot! People dont come to this place to diet or to watch what they eat.  Yes... many of the items are fattening, but its a great place to eat. Its great food, 99% of the time it has good service and I have yet to ""DIE"" from it so... just relax and enjoy your time."
George L.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,143,132,3.0,10/25/2009,The only thing good here is the Cheesecake. They need to hold true to their name and stop making food.
Michael H.,"Walnut, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/17/2012,"Today I went to Cheesecake Factory with my girlfriend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and everything was great until we found out that our utensils were already used by some previous customer who dined before us. It started when we sat and our utensils looked a bit dirty; however I just cleaned it with my napkin and didn't really think much of it. Things went well as our waiter gave us our bread; however after I used my knife to put butter on my bread and eat it, I realized that my spoon had remnants of chocolate stuck to it, Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I just assumed that they may have missed washing it and that only the spoon was used. So I asked my girlfriend about her utensils and her spoon had dried chocolate stains on her spoon and other marks on the rest of her utensils, which makes me really believe that these were used by someone before us. Realizing this after already using my knive and fork, I lost my appetite and spoke to the manager. Atleast the manager was really nice and said that we did not have to pay for the meal which we did not eat because of our lost appetite. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the staff was friendly and the manager was nice. I would NOT return to this Cheesecake Factory. I never had a problem like this anywhere I have eaten in my life. I expected a slightly upper tier restaurant like this would never have this sort of problem; however I was wrong. My girlfriend and I just ended up leaving and left us in a bitter mood; making this an unpleasant night."
Mermaid Princess A.,"Torrance, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/30/2008,"I really enjoyed this CF location.  The restaurant's outer and inner design is unlike anything I've seen... it's very creative and unique.  Very beautiful.  Our server was really nice, and she checked on us as needed and not too often (I hate servers who interrupt your meal every 5 minutes to check on you).  The food was really really good.  There is another CF location I went to a few years back and the food was just okay, but I was pleasantly surprised with the food at this location as it's superb. I really recommend the avocado roll appetizer.  It's really good and I liked it a lot.  I would DEFINITELY go to this location for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries because it's fancy enough to dress up if you want, but still a chain restaurant if you wanna go casual.  The ambiance is great too."
Lynn S.,"Brea, CA",0,10,,3.0,6/2/2010,"As usual, the food is amazing as ever at The Cheesecake Factory. Why the 3 star review then? This location seems to always dissapoint me. From the lackluster service to the inability to cook steaks/cheeseburgers to the requested temp. That being said, I would suggest that if you ever visit this location to know what you want quickly, get it in, and get out (oh and don't order a burger or a steak haha).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They are both exquisite. I would even suggest getting both and saving half your entree for lunch the next day. My absolute favorite entree is their Chicken Bellagio. It is on their seasonal menu but has stuck around for a while so hopefully it becomes part of the regular menu! It is served over pasta and has this flavorful but not too heavy sauce topped with arugala and prisocuitto. I could easily get this dish each and every time I go to Cheesecake. Another entree to try out would be their Bistro Shrimp Pasta.  And of course, you should always save room for dessert when coming here. If you get the Godiva or the Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake you won't be dissapointed. However, I have heard that their other dessert options (not cheesecake) are also good, but haven't gotten around to trying them yet."
Steve W.,"La Mirada, CA",429,79,186,3.0,6/26/2009,"Love the restaurant but can never go because the wait is TOO LONG. They need to expand and put in more rooms and tables. When BJs was too crowded, we tried Cheesecake Factory, same ridiculous wait (over an hour). We won't try again, big waste of time."
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
T H.,"Brea, CA",5,14,,4.0,6/15/2010,"I love cheesecake, and I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food here is great, the service is attentive, and the desserts are obviously excellent. The thai lettuce chicken wraps are my personal favorite, but I've never been disappointed by the food here. The quality control is really quite remarkable...I've eaten at more Cheesecake Factory's (CA, FL, CO, KS) than I care to admit and they're extremely consistent.  The only negative is the wait, every place pretty much always has a wait, but I suppose it's an indication of a product that people want. On weekends the wait can be an hour or longer. One tip...if you come as a couple, just grab a table at the bar and skip the wait."
Jeff Rey E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",64,4,2,5.0,11/4/2009,three words: RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. my favorite dishes here are the bang bang chicken and shrimp and hibachi steak. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.
Archana T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,13,,2.0,11/9/2009,"Well, we were there last night. The cheesecake factory restaurant's I have been to before is in Pasadena and Canoga Park. I must say that the service was good to which the two stars go. I have dietary restrictions and they made sure to check on all stuff. But the food with same criteria was much better over at Pasadena and Canoga park. Pizza and Pasta.. were good but I wish they get inspired from the one in Pasadena.. :)"
J S.,"Fullerton, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2011,Waited over a 1 hour to be seated for 8 after they told us we can be seated in 10 min. Took a while for bread to come out. Ordered garlic pasta and cajun pasta tasted nothing like garlic or cajun just noodles. Service sucks. Leaving unsatisfied AGAIN ugh
Jay H.,"Anaheim, CA",2,19,,3.0,9/27/2011,"The bleu cheese BLT was good, but the service was poor. We sat in the bar area and they had two servers during their busiest hours. Our server of course was the slower of the two and you couldn't understand a word he said. Ater he brought our drinks he thought it would be a good idea to card us, I wonder if he would have taken them back it we were under-age? All in all I would be back, but avoid the previous server."
Martin V.,"Long Beach, CA",26,60,12,2.0,3/6/2009,"Yes i have experienced better. To be fair, the is place is not bad, but is everything you would expect from a chain restaurant,  the service is mediocre which i assume is because it's always so damn packed... What i would go back for? Guacamole egg rolls and raspberry  white chocolate cheese cake, worth the two stars"
Eunice C.,"Torrance, CA",40,22,,1.0,9/20/2011,"I had the worst experience at this location.  I never had to leave a restaurant before finishing a meal.  I love Cheesecake Factory, but this location's service is not up to par with the name that it carries.  First off, the bathrooms were so filthy I had to wait to use the ones at the mall.  Then, the waiter gives me a napkin with lipstick marks everywhere,  I guess they reuse napkins here.  Our first waiter tells us that we can still order off the lunch specials, so I choose a meatloaf plate and a cup of soup.  A new waiter takes our orders, and i specifically tell her the lunch portion.  She brought us the regular dinner portion, and told us that it was already after five.  Why didn't she tell us that while we were ordering? If i had known that then i would've ordered something else off the regular dinner menu.  If the meatloaf was good, then I would not have cared as much.  But, my food tasted and looked like it came from hometown buffet.  To top it all off she forgot the soup, but I just wanted to leave.  My cousins and I didn't even finish half way, and just asked for the check.  I am NEVER coming back here, and no one else should."
Mateo X.,"Walnut, CA",2,19,,2.0,6/14/2008,"ok wat the fuck is all the hype about ive been before and its nothing special i went last may for my  friends birthday ok a fucking hour long wait in the sweltering heat just to be seated outside on the ""balcony"" or whatever the fuck it is ok so then everyone but me was seated  in the shade of their toothpick unbrellas then we had to wait like 30 minutes until we got anyfucking bread then of course we got drinks which were not even cold  and then we waited for like another hour to get our orders in and served to us so while all of that is happening i am melting in the blistering heat and had no choise but to throw a white linen napkin over my black shirt to help deflect the heat from melting a hole through my twig of a body the food was mediocre the service.........she was a bitch and the bill was very overpriced but i didnt pay for it of course meanwhile it was one bad experince i know but cheesecake factories in general are always way too crowded way too pricy for the quality of food and like idk if its just me but is it a little bit tacky in there? or is it just the people? X"
Yolanda r.,"Orange, CA",1,16,1,3.0,1/5/2012,"Reasonable prices.  Salads have gotten smaller even the whipped cream amounts with the cheesecake but its still good food.  Quick, friendly service with nice clean decor.  And the best passion fruit iced tea ever found.  Go enjoy!"
Archie A.,"Placentia, CA",3,53,,5.0,4/15/2012,great place as always. you can tell an excellent restaurant when it is always crowded.
Brian S.,"Sierra Madre, CA",1175,414,248,1.0,3/20/2008,"All I have to say is if you get ""Kenyon"" as your server, try to move to another table!"
