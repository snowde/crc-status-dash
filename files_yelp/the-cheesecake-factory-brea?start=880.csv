Grover G.,"San Francisco, CA",12,122,7,3.0,12/15/2008,"chain restaurant, crowded, always a wait....so why do I love them?? It's their food!  I have a couple dishes that I crave at times, which means I drag my family along with me even though they don't really care for the place.  The mandarin chicken, it's not anything unusual or fantastic but I love it, same thing with the chicken marsala.  Yummy!  The best has to be the Thai chicken pasta.  The only dish my wife will eat and it is REALLY good!  I think part of the reason I enjoy this place is because we don't have one in town and don't get to go too often."
Ed L.,"Anaheim, CA",13,46,,1.0,6/7/2007,Why is it always so crowded here?  The food is that good?  And why does a cheesecake cost $50?!  What the hell?!
Celeste L.,"Saint Louis, MO",22,55,10,1.0,6/17/2007,"Since I've moved from SoCal to San Francisco, I think my taste in food has changed and perhaps I've become a bit more snobby.  So I was reluctant in writing a review of this place because I thought I might be too uppity, but seeing how the other reviews for this place were pretty bad, I thought, why not add my two cents?  First off, the wait at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday night was half an hour.  I would expect to be majorly impressed after a wait after that long; the Cheesecake Factory did not stand up to this expectation.  Nothing on the menu looked that great, so I got a California omelet.  It came without the avocados mentioned in the menu.  It was made from bland eggbeater mix that had not requested, and a side of sliced tomatoes, which turned out to be flavorless.  I didn't think that an omelet could be screwed up, but this the eggs were rubbery and the omelet was pretty bland.  My sister ordered the garlic noodles, which were pretty tasty and had a *lot* of garlic flavor, but were swimming in oil.  I also tried a bit of mom's bang bang chicken, which was just a standard issue curry dish.   We didn't order any cheesecake; since most of us Asians suffer from lactose intolerance, it wouldn't be a good choice, but that fact may have influenced this review.   As I was finishing up my meal, I looked over at a neighboring table where I saw a big group of children and adults.  The adults were feasting on huge cocktails and slices of cheesecake topped with a huge ball of whipped cream, the kids gorging on giant piles of French fries, sugary sweet drinks, and stacks of sliders burgers.  As I processed this scene, I realized the reason for childhood and adult obesity in this country and subsequent mass appeal for places like the Cheesecake Factory.  This is where you want to go if you want to be fat."
Jill B.,"Brea, CA",11,32,,2.0,5/5/2008,"Always crowded and the food is just mediocre.  The chicken madera and the cheesecake are about the only staples that I can recommend.  Good place if you have kids to dine out, but just your average chain that is very crowded."
Steve B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",19,99,35,4.0,8/24/2010,This place can get really crowded especially on a weekend. Parking can be somewhat difficult.  Overall a like their food and atmosphere.  The Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken is really good. The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for.
Grace T.,"Bellflower, CA",106,584,3,4.0,6/18/2007,"Yes, the wait is long.  Yes, food can be expensive.  But where else can you get a white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake that's yummy and as light as a feather.  We came here on a Saturday night and endured a 30 minute wait.  The food was good (bistro shrimp pasta is a fav of mine) and service was attentive (we were seated on the patio and I usually tend to find that service is always slower outdoors)."
Jacqueline T.,"Rosemead, CA",42,93,,1.0,8/9/2007,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factorys but nothing like this one.  The service was SUPER DUPER slow!  I'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt that she was a newbie but come ON!  If you need help, ask for it, right?  We had a party of 13 for my friend's bday bash.  It took 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  It took an extra 10 minutes for the bread to come.  She was only serving 3 tables!  She disappeared majority of the time.  I dont know WHAT the heck she was doing.  The food took 1 hour and 15 minutes to get to our table.  We all finished within 10 minutes because we were starving at this point.  As we finish, I tell the waitress that it's my friend's birthday.  She was super nice and asked me what was his fave cheesecake.  When the bill came (it took a total of 10 minutes to get the check to us...she was punching some buttons on the cash register FOREVER), we see that she charged us for the cheesecake!  DUDEEE!  It's his birthday!  You could have been cool and put it on the house.  That's what all the restaurants do.   After a 2 hour dinner at Cheesecake Factory, I was ready to go home.  It was just a ridiculous experience!"
Shelley H.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,421,28,3.0,3/27/2007,"What's with the OC and their devotion to chain restaurants?  I ended up here b/c a friend and I needed to think of a place to grab a quick drink and this was the first place that came to my mind.  I don't really like going here for food b/c the wait's always too long, and you've seen one cheesecake factory, you've seen em all.  But one thing I LOVE about this place is their dirty martini.  They use blue cheese stuffed olives which is AWESOME!!  I wanted to ask the barista for a bucket of that stuff.  We had our drinks with some of their free bread and it turned out to be a not so bad mini-meal."
Eugene K.,"Irvine, CA",11,34,,1.0,3/8/2008,"I'm generally not that picky about food and I've been to 2 other Cheesecake Factories (one in San Jose and the other in San Diego) and this place kills it for everyone.  I loved Cheesecake factory until I went to this particular one.  Since my friends and I live in the OC, I kept suggesting to go eat at CCF and my friends were like, ""Why?  Cheesecake Factory isn't that great.""  I was so surprised that anyone would say such a thing until they finally wanted to give it another chance.  OMG that was a big mistake!  This one in the Brea Mall really stinks in ALL ASPECT of having a restaurant.  The Pasta Di Vinci is one of my favorite dishes that I used to get in San Diego and I've also tried it at the one in San Jose and they were both really good.  In Brea, not only was the sauce dry and the pasta slightly harder than I expected, the chicken really tasted like it was frozen and thrown in the microwave for a couple minutes.  I was patient about my initial tasting and asked if I can have it fixed, but the manager in charge of the time said that the other Cheesecake Factories were cooking it wrong. The waiters were also unhelpful.  They would rarely come around asking if I needed a refill and after they sensed that I wasn't having even a decent experience, they ignored me completely!  I wasn't even showing any form of distaste towards the waiters since I know it's not their fault if the food wasn't to my standards.  The service was so poor that I had to walk up to them and get their attention if I needed anything. I'm taking my friends to the Cheesecake factory in San Diego to nullify their belief that the food at the chains are horrible, but I can't blame them for thinking this way because of this one in Brea.  There is quite a distance to drive all the way down just to try their food, but if you can go to another restaurant while in Orange County you should really avoid this particular place."
Xenia G.,"Anaheim, CA",119,206,51,2.0,3/20/2007,"i usually don't have a problem at cheesecake factory but i just got the feeling that our servers didn't care about us.  maybe it was the fact that my husband & i didn't look like orange county money - it was actually our first off day in about a week but thats beside the point.  so we don't have fake bakes, i'm not carrying a designer bag [i prefer not looking like all the other women robots out there!] or my makeup isn't applied by my own personal stylist, but let's be real - this is only cheesecake factory lol we were seated immediately - lunchtime on a monday though. our server came to our table shortly after and we placed our order.  hubby asked for his salad to be served before his entree...our drinks came about 15 minutes later, whatever.  guess when hubby's salad arrived?  along with the rest of our food! lol  i noticed our server was busy closing out other guests bills and tending to them but he didn't even stop by to refill our drinks or ask how we were doing.  our food was great [fresh off the line HOT!  and delicious] so my average rating is based on our server.   the restaurant wasn't busy at all and i think its key to check how the meal is going, refill drinks, etc.   please please improve...thanks!"
Melissa R.,"Brea, CA",113,78,15,2.0,2/1/2010,"I tend to love a mom 'n' pop, hole-in-the-wall place but decided to give this corporate restaurant a fair and objective chance at impressing me. First off, I called in to make a reservation. They said they don't do that but they will take my name, desired time, and number in my party... sounds like a reservation but the woman on the phone assured me it was not. So me and the two others in my group arrive. It was absolutely PACKED. like shoulder to shoulder, sliding my way toward the front counter congestion. I told her my name and that I had phoned in earlier. As she looked me up, I noticed the other hostess explaining there would be an hour and a half wait to another patron. I was worried and prepared to leave if my hostess uttered the same unfortunate remark. To my surprise, she looked up, gave me a pager and said it would be 15 minutes. So much for the ""no reservations"" idea. I was happy to have called. So we waited... and waited. I asked her where we were at in the line after about 30 minutes. She said we were next without looking at her computer. I figured she was guessing at best and asked the manager. He said ""coming up."" Well, that doesn't help me. Anyhow, we were finally seated after 40 minutes. This was the most annoying experience due to the fact it was so crowded in the lobby and outside. The food was mediocre. The cheesecake is quite good but you can just as easy order it from the front to-go. I chose not to dwell on the food or waiter service mostly because it was unremarkable and a bit boring. I won't be returning to The Cheesecake Factory unless it is to pick up some fairly good, overpriced cheesecake to-go."
Janay N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",52,77,81,4.0,9/17/2009,One of the best cheesecake factories I have been to. I also been to the one in Santa Anita that one is disgusting. I got the Mahi Mahi on a bed of mashed potaoes and other delectable veggies. Good stuff for dessert I tried their twist on strawberry shortcake the bread was dry and I dont really consider it to be much of a dessert after that point. But we always have great servivce there
Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,4.0,4/26/2008,"went here on a thursday afternoon (probably about 12ish) there was barely a wait. we sat in the bar area. nice waiter. this hapa looking guy, pretty good looking but didnt make much eye contact. i ordered the half order of grilled salmon on the lunch menu with rice (being so asian haha) instead of french fries. it was pretty good! it was actually a big piece with a lot of rice. the broccoli was really salty though.  parking wasnt too bad at the time. i guess it was just good timing on the wait. (parking and to be seated)"
Rico M.,"Lakewood, CA",273,70,,5.0,8/18/2008,"I've always heard of how good this place was and I finally had it for my friend's birthday. Let me just say good food, great service, good amount of portion (I had to to-go box), and really good cheesecake. And it definitely wasn't pricey at all. I'm definitely coming back for more."
Christina J.,"Fullerton, CA",13,9,2,1.0,8/16/2012,"This one star is for this particular location and not the chain in general. I love their cheesecake and their food is pretty good, however I will never be visiting this location again.  I used to go to this cheesecake factory around twice a month with friends or family but after my recent experience if I need to fulfill my cheesecake factory fix, I'll spend the extra time driving to the Garden Walk or even the Spectrum. I ordered medium well steak diane and my friend ordered the steak diane medium well and chicken madeira combination. When our meals came some of our steak pieces were way over well done and if I had to compare it to something it would be as if you were attempting to saw through a block of cardboard. Shortly after the waitress took our plates to replace them, the manager came out and made the comment that they cut into all of our steak pieces and only 35% was over done but (at this point he rolled his eyes at us) they were going to replace it anyways. If he was replacing our meals anyways was it necessary to roll his eyes at us and make a snide comment about how only 35% of our steak were way past well done? As far as I'm concerned if you order steak in a restaurant and your steak is near cardboard status it needs to be replaced. He was extremely condescending and instead of apologizing for the inconvenience, it seemed like he felt we should've just suffered through the way overdone steak instead of complaining."
Chris D.,"Norwalk, CA",29,107,6,3.0,5/27/2007,I'm giving Cheesecake factory a 3 solely on it's cheesecakes.  Theyre absolutely delish.  Lots of selection food wise and cheesecake wise but everytime I eat here i feel like crap the rest of the day.  I enjoy the food and all and the grease but man...it is just to much grease.
Rachel R.,"West Covina, CA",13,64,,5.0,4/27/2009,"i'm giving cheesecake factory a 5 because it's still one of my favorite restaurants.  it was my fave, but i think coco palm inched it's way to the top spot.  so anyway.  we arrived for friday night dinner around 6:45pm so we were lucky enough to beat the dinner crowd and be seated by 7pm.  service was good so this review will mainly be for the food.  we started with bread.  i love their bread, but it's not as great when it's barely warm.  for our appetizer we ordered the firecracker salmon.  it was good, but the chef put a tad too much kick for my taste this time around.  now usually i don't even bother looking at the menu because i order the same thing every time.  chicken marsala with extra sauce.  i almost opted for something different, but figured i should just stick to what i know is good.  unfortunately, it didn't taste as delicious as usual.  they kinda skimped on the sauce.  but the main reason is because i had a tiny taste of bf's meal.  he ordered the kobe burger.  i got a little nibble of the kobe patty.  and dudes.  it was freakin DE-LISH-EE-OUS.  and i think that's what made my usual, taste not so yummy in my tummy.  it was so good that bf didn't even breathe as he was eating it.  and not only that, it has mushrooms which bf detests.  and he still devoured it.  so yeah, next visit i might have to order that kobe burger instead of my chicken marsala.  we ended the evening taking home a slice of banana cream cheesecake.  bf finished it in like 4 forkfuls.  i barely had time to get me a taste hhha.  so yeah, cheesecake factory is still one of the best. oh yeah, i ordered a cup of clam chowder and either they upgraded me for free or their cups are the size of bowls.  it was good.  i ate it all up."
Eric S.,"Brea, CA",0,109,,4.0,8/15/2010,Always a wait at this place but it is totally worth it! Very good food. I definitely recommend the burgers!
Andrea B.,"Anaheim, CA",10,12,13,5.0,4/28/2010,"After shopping at Macy's, we popped into the Cheesecake Factory for Happy Hour drinks and appetizers.  I had not been into a Cheesecake Factory for years  -- best memory recalled too much on the menu, too crowded, and lots of food.  We were pleasantly surprised by the airy open feeling in the bar area.  We arrived just before 4:00 P.M., but the bartender said we could order at Happy Hour prices.  I ordered a Cosmo which was about the best one I have had at any restaurant  -- not skimpy, not too sweet or vodka tasting  -- just perfect.  At $5 I don't think you can beat it.  We also ordered the sliders  -- these came as 4 little burgers  -- plenty to share plus we ordered the freshly made guacomole and chips.  A good amount of Chips which  were crispy and there must have been at least 3 avocados in the guacamole which came with a small cup of salsa and sour cream on the side.  This was easily enough food to fill us up.  Each appetizer was also $5 each.  We did go ahead and order dessert (well, you almost have to being at the CHEESECAKE factory.:)) We ordered the Brownie Sundae Cheesecake which was absolutely delicious and plenty big to share.  Small check, yummy food, and beautiful atmosphere.  What a winner!  We will be back for sure!"
Suzanne A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,6,,3.0,3/12/2008,"Fair food, the wait isn't worth it though. Usually the restaurants look big but when you walk in, they aren't very. I recommend ordering take out (esp. the cheesecake, it's worth it) and going to a romantic spot to eat."
