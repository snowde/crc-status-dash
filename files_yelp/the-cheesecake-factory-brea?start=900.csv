J H.,"Brea, CA",0,25,1,1.0,9/15/2008,"My friend and I met for lunch on 9-9-08 and most of the tables were empty, which is a surprise for this place.  Maybe we learned why the place was empty when we were seated at a booth on the west side of the restaurant.  There were flies buzzing all around us and we complained to the waitress when she arrived to take our drink order.  She said she was aware of the problem and has complained to the management herself, but she said management won't do anything about it.  She also said that the flies seem to be worse on the west side of the restaurant.  As she's talking to us, I count 6 flies landed on the post behind by friend's head.  We asked to move to another part of the restaurant to see if it would be better.  It was better in the middle, but we still had one fly land on our table.  We requested to see the manager and he said that he was aware of the problem and they were going to have pest control come in that evening (after what the waitress said it was hard to believe this).  He said that this is a problem he doesn't know how to fix because the flies continue to come in even after the ones inside have been killed.  It didn't sound like he really intended to try and fix the problem.  Needless to say, the thought of how many flies might be on the food in the kitchen just is too gross to contemplate.  I think it will be a long time before I can venture into this place again. If ever."
