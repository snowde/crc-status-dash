Ariel M.,"Westfield, NJ",39,87,101,4.0,1/9/2018,"I came here for lunch on a week day, and it was packed. We had to wait almost an hour for a table of 4. We started with a round of drinks, I went with their signature Martini. Their menu is so extensive it takes a while to look through everything and decide what you want. For appetizers we had the loaded tater tots and the Korean Cauliflower. The Cauliflower was DELICIOUS! I would definitely recommend that.  I ordered the Avocado Toast for my main course and it was much larger than I thought; it was more of an avocado baguette. Very filling- i took half of it home. My family ordered the Mac & Cheese Burger, Truffle Grilled Cheese Sticks and a Salad. Everyone was happy with their food; it was al great quality and big portions.  We took some classic, chocolate and carrot cheese cakes home; you can't go wrong with their deserts.  Staff was friendly and attentive; we didn't feel rushed at all during our meal. I would go back to this location- there is so much more to try!"
Kimberly S.,"Middlesex, NJ",24,140,384,4.0,10/10/2017,"Stopped by Sunday night for dinner, this is always a good place to go when you don't know exactly what you want to eat since the menu is huge!  Checked out the cheesecakes while we waited 10 minutes for our table... They served us some delicious bread and butter to start and got our drinks while we looked over the menu.  Looked over their specials for the day and the Truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks caught my eye for an app and we also got some calamari to start. I loved the grilled cheese sticks they were a nice change from the standards. The calamari was also very good.  For the entrees I almost always order the same thing... The farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic it's one of my favorite pasta dishes so I enjoyed that as usual. We also ordered the combination dish of Steak Diane and shrimp scampi with some brown rice and that was great too.  Service was excellent and unfortunately no room for dessert today.... Maybe next time."
Ahmed B.,"Monmouth Junction, NJ",3,79,7,5.0,10/8/2017,Ericka our server is awesome! Super adorable and very patient. She checked on us promptly during brunch and made changes to the plates we ordered as we asked. What I really liked is that she asked everyone on the table if they'd like to change anything to their plates ... just in case... great job! Managment should high give her !  Ps ... I noticed other servers that usually do a great job when we're here were helping her and her them! Good team effort   10/8/2017-Good day to come. Zellynda was hustling. She was a Good server and food came out really good. She made sure our edits in the menu were what we wanted. Checked on us more than the usual experience. And that's all folks!
Jess D.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",256,274,1449,3.0,1/3/2018,"Although I have been coming here since they opened it can be a bit or miss . Some days the service is on point and others it's slow. I am usually satisfied with the dishes I order . The portions are Farley big and tasty depending on the dish. Unless you go with the skinny menu things are portioned pretty good for less calories dishes. As far as the servers are concerned some are good and very attentive, some even go over the top by taking notice you need a refill on a drink without asking or cleaning the table as dishes are done. Then you have some that take your order and you never see them again until you are almost done. All in all it's a decent place to eat for brunch or lunch ."
Sam P.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,73,78,1.0,1/6/2018,Had one of the worst experiences. The hostess messed up our order. Main course came out before the appetizer on top of it the restrooms had a leak and were flooded with no idea what (guess!!!).  We spoke with the manager which seems to have worked as the hostess attitude towards us changed immediately. Hope someone reads this review and do something about this as this place is in a very good location but they care a Sh!t about customers
Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",48,201,448,3.0,10/4/2017,Only came to this Cheesecake Factory to do a pickup order of cheesecake. It was tucked into the back section of the mall but there was plenty of parking and even some to go spots that I was able to park in and run in.  My order was ready when I got there and customer service was great but I did find that the cheesecake at this location taste it different than others I have been to. Some of the cheesecake slices that I picked up we're also very tiny and cut smaller than usual. All in all the cheesecake was great but I think I prefer other locations better.  I had ordered the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate tasted a little different I'm wondering whether it was sitting out for over a day or if it was actually made differently I'm not sure if the cheesecakes are just shipped to the store directly so perhaps it was just old. I also picked up an Adams peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was almost half the size of the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake. It was sliced thinly and the end of the slice was falling apart.  Overall everything was good though.
Sheila R.,"Summit, NJ",109,288,1251,4.0,1/28/2017,"We had a very nice dinner during the week at the Bridgewater cheesecake factory. They have an excellent wine by the glass list, so we started with wine. For dinner, we both got the salads. Each was very different, but tasty. Huge portions of mixed greens were tossed with quinoa or super antioxidants!!! Delicious.  Overall, service was excellent and setting was very nice. Great option in the bridewater mall."
Leo B.,"Port Chester, NY",110,45,47,4.0,9/21/2017,"Be prepared to wait during lunch if you have a big group (luckily I didn't have to). The servers are busy, attentive, and courteous as they regularly check on drinks. Everyone (7) at my table was satisfied with their meal. I will definitely be back!"
Deonna M.,"Kissimmee, FL",28,7,5,2.0,10/1/2017,Everything was Burnt today. I am so disappointed. Miguel is an awesome server very attentive and friendly.  He is the reason for the two stars otherwise I would have said zero.
Louis G.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",2,7,13,4.0,9/22/2017,What can you say about a place where the menu is thicker than a phone book and that places desert first in its name.    It lives up to the billing.  The cheeecakes are amazing.  Always get an extra slice to go.  Have never tried them all but know what I want.  Go for the Oreo Dream Extreme--please and thank you.  The fire roasted artichoke (ask for a side of Balsamic) and the Avocado Egg Rolls.   Pretty happy with my entrees but the menu has too many options to find ol faithfuls so it takes a long time to settle on an order.  Yesterday i just ordered Apps and small plates--the fontina stuffed mushrooms are amazing.
Derek B.,"Old Bridge, NJ",46,2,2,1.0,12/3/2017,They've messed up my order 4 times in the last year for pickup. So disorganized. Everyone there is just looking to have conversations and don't care about getting things right.
Ming K.,"Whitehouse Station, Readington Township, NJ",1,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"On 1/5/2018 Friday night 8:55 p.m. my wife, daughter, and I went to the Bridgewater branch Cheesecake Factory for dinner. We were told there was a 30 minutes wait, and was handed a pager by the host. We were sitting on the bench waiting, and after 30 minutes I went to the front desk to check on the status. I was told by a different host that input into their system was actually a 40 min wait. I told her that when we received the pager, we were quoted a 30 minutes wait. After checking their system again, I was told that they are cleaning our table, and we will be next. After about 5 minutes, a group of three people that had received a pager after us got seated. A few minutes later another group of four got seated. After waiting for 40 minutes we were still not seated. A few minutes later another group of four people who came in and received a pager 15 minutes after us got seated. I happened to look at my watch when they sat down next to me on the bench. My daughter said she saw a group of two people who came in about 20 min after us get seated. During out wait I also saw a group of 6 get seated. I understand a group of 2 and group of 6 are seated at different tables than groups of 3 or 4. But still, a total of of 5 groups of people who received pagers after us got seated before us. I made another complaint to a woman that just showed up at the front desk. She took the pager, which never lit up, from my daughter. Instead of apologizing to me, I was told you're not the only customer here. While I was complaining, another girl took my daughter and wife to the table without even letting me know. After we were seated, I asked for the manager. The manager was the same women who took our pager. I was told later her name is Sara Solomon. I told her that I was not happy with the situation. She said they made a mistake. I asked her where is the apology. She unwillingly apologized and repeatedly said she couldn't have done anything about it. My wife told her that she mismanaged the restaurant and asked her what is the point of using the pager if you can not manage it properly. She immediately responded again with you are not the only customer here. Immediately I stood up and left the restaurant. She was basically telling me that they don't want my business. I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for over 20 years. The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was in Atlanta. I was very impressed by their customer service and food. I used to go to the Edison NJ branch before the Bridgewater branch open. I will not go back to Cheesecake Factory again unless they send me an apology letter or email."
Josh H.,"Whitehall, PA",515,108,647,4.0,6/7/2016,"It seems I am one of the few who never been to the Cheesecake Factory. I finally got the chance to go during my visit to the Bridgewater Mall in NJ. My dining experience was everything I hoped for! I didn't have to wait for a table, the service was spectacular, the food was delicious, and their cheesecake was amazing. The menu is HUGE so I will definitely be back in the future to try some of their other menu items. They have everything from pizza and pasta to steak and seafood."
Shivani N.,"Bridgewater, NJ",7,3,2,5.0,10/28/2017,"This is my favorite restuarant in town! The food is delicious and the service is exceptional. For apps I love to start off with the buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls! My favorites dishes are the bang bang chicken and shrimp and eggplant parm, sooo good! Top that off with some cheesecake for a perfect night out!"
Peter V.,"Plainfield, NJ",59,24,3,1.0,9/4/2017,"I ordered three entrees, an appetizer and a piece of cake, on the phone, for pickup. When II went to pick up the order I asked if there were three entrees and was told yes. When I got home I only found two entrees. When I called to relay this experience the woman who answered was very unapologetic. I don't recommend ordering  to go from this location."
Marc D.,"Allentown, PA",30,9,,2.0,9/2/2017,"Flies everywhere, tomatoes not fresh, just gross. I would not go back.  I am adding a bunch of extra words so that Yelp does not convert this to just a tip (hate that)."
N G.,"North Plainfield, NJ",3,47,48,1.0,8/12/2017,"Racially profiled by the bartender ""Christopher"" very disappointed in his attitude and the way that he approached me and my cousin. This location will never get my money nor business EVER."
Cody O.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",141,145,207,3.0,4/18/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has some quality food and a huge variety.  You may have to wait quite a while before getting a table because this spot is extremely popular. The cocktails are fresh and flavorful.Their entrees are always delicious and the burger I got was cooked to my specifications and came with a side of delicious french fries. The cheesecake is tremendous but it seemed as if they had not prepared enough of each variety as several members of our party had to change their order because they hadn't defrosted any of the kind they wanted. Overall, I had a positive experience, I just wish they had defrosted more of the cheesecakes so that the people I enjoyed dinner with could have had their first pick."
S J.,"Summit, NJ",0,25,,1.0,2/9/2017,"Fried chicken was included in our ""vegetarian"" appetizer ...   we sent it back and the manager came over and said ""sorry mistakes happen""  After paying a tab over $100...   mistakes shouldn't happen and when it does at-least have the decency to offer a dessert on the house or a credit on the bill.    Attitude ruined our meal tonight!"
L G.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,14,,2.0,7/14/2017,"Food is honestly horrendous. The only reason anyone should go here is the cheesecake. The drinks are inconsistent, sometimes properly done, and sometimes bland/weak. The food is somehow always greasy, even the salads. I try so hard to like it, because it should be fun, even okay because of the corporate control and planning but the management is a disaster. Have dealt with manager Chris before and it explained A LOT about why the place is in the dump. He's missing the spark plugs if you get my drift. Servers are also majorly lacking and lazy. It's just such a cluster eff.   The front desk is clearly understaffed and untrained. Want it to be good, but good Lord it's not."
Ramon A.,"Somerset, NJ",87,87,117,5.0,5/15/2017,"After a long morning and some shopping at the mall decided to have a late lunch here.   It was pretty busy but we know it would be like that so we put our name on the list while still having one more stop at the mall so that we would just not be waiting there. The standard at this chain is better than any other american themed restaurant.  We had the chicken samosas and loaded baked potato tots for appetizers, the samosas were small but good and the tots were simple great, they had bacon and cheese ... do I need to say more.  For lunch we had the Thai coconut-lime chicken and lemon garlic.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp and I was blown away with the Thai coconut-lime chicken.  Definitely a repeat."
Nina J.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",0,19,,4.0,11/19/2017,"Party of 6, with some difficult (ordering-wise) patrons.  Sean, our waiter, was fantastic.  He had the skills and more so, personality to make our visit extra special.  As always, the food was excellent!  We were celebrating a birthday.  We had lots of different food orders.  Everything was superb from the scalding-hot black coffee my mother requires, to my gluten-free cheesecake for dessert.  We had a Mojito and 1 glass of wine (both delish, if a bit pricey for NJ-although I will say the drink was huge).  Skinnylicious shrimp tacos, Asian chicken salad, chicken pot pie, and chicken and pasta-all excellent.  Breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich, both on point.  Mostly however, the bread and butter are the stars of the show.  I don't know what they use, but I could happily eat that for my meal every time I visit.  Again, our server made our visit.  Sean was so pleasant to all of us, attentive, joking with my dad, taking our picture, and singing 'Happy Birthday' although we told him he didn't have to.  Just such a nice guy and really good at his job.  We made sure to tell the manager how much we enjoyed our visit and our server. If you are at Bridgewater Commons and heading to Cheesecake Factory, check out Sean and say hi.  And tip well!  :)"
Mohit T.,"Raritan, NJ",0,11,1,5.0,4/9/2017,"I visit this place almost once a month and I love it everytime. Have not been to other cheesecake factory but this one is a very nice place, staff is very welcoming and has good ambience. My personal favorites are Avocado egg rolls, Cashew chicken and Thai glazed salmon."
Dan M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",66,317,549,3.0,7/13/2016,"I came back here for another department lunch.  The service was very good as we had a large party to accommodate.   We started off with chips and guacamole.  The guacamole was great.  The mild guacamole was chosen.  I kept going back for more.  I was real impressed with this. For my lunch order, I had the Baja chicken tacos.  There was 4 decent size tacos that were filled with ""spicy"" chicken, cheese, tomato, avocado, onion, chipotle, and cilantro.  There was a little too much going on with all the toppings on this taco, but the taste was still acceptable.  There was also a side of rice and beans, which were solid. For dessert, I had the tiramisu cheesecake.  It was of good flavor, but just a little dry I thought.  That was my only complaint regarding this particular slice of cheesecake."
Jason C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,6,,5.0,11/7/2017,"Great place to eat! Despite getting chest pain every time i eat here, it's definitely worth it:) just typing this review is making me crave one of their 10000 calories meal yummm"
Kamila M.,"Newark, DE",53,269,33,5.0,7/6/2016,"This was my first time dining in at The Cheesecake Factory. I have ordered cheesecake from here and have loved every piece.  This Cheesecake factory gets packed! We came on a random Tuesday night for 6:30 pm but did not get seated until 7:00 p.m. That is not that bad of a wait especially since you can go to the mall while you wait. The service was really great. Our waitress was exceptionally nice. They offer you bread to your table which is a nice bonus. Cheesecake factory also has a ""healthier"" menu that I thought was nice. I ordered an Asian salad that was very good. My friend ordered a flatbread that she enjoyed. Altogether, I think Cheesecake factory has a huge menu so everyone in your party will have something that they will enjoy. The service was good and the food came out quickly. Only downside is the wait."
Diana C.,"Frenchtown, NJ",0,12,1,4.0,11/6/2017,"I only go so often because the food is always great. I have my signature dish and it's always my go-to, the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta. Hey, I know I could make it at home, but going out is so much more fun. The service is iffy, depends on your waiter and what night you go. Don't expect to go on a Friday or Saturday night and be seated immediately; I've had to wait 45 minutes. Bread is always endless and awesome, and the ranch dressing is the best I've ever had, and probably one of the highlights of my visits. I usually love this place."
Ally P.,"Raritan, NJ",60,16,8,3.0,2/27/2017,"Be prepared to wait when coming here. Almost every time I have been to this Cheesecake Factory the time from ordering to receiving my meal has tipped on the side of too long. You should expect to be here for an hour at least.  That being said, Cheesecake Factory's food never seems to disappoint. There are options for every diet palate and need. My personal favorites are the Buffalo blasts and the Americana cheeseburger."
Kashmala K.,"Franklin Park, NJ",2,38,122,3.0,12/13/2016,"So I love the food but when it is served cold, it just ruins everything. Mocha latte was on point though."
Brandan H.,"NJ, NJ",31,2,,2.0,4/23/2017,"I have been here multiple times as a sit down customer and over the phone orders and since my first time here the service and wait time have gotten worse every visit. Very popular place so I can understand a wait to sit down and eat however the last two times I've placed food orders to go, I've waited a combine time of a half hour JUST TO ORDER OVER THE PHONE. I have no idea what happened to this place but I don't think I'll go back. Food is amazing, but the wait makes you realise you'd have eaten, had drinks and been home going to Fridays compared to even getting apps here."
Kita F.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,5,,4.0,8/2/2017,The food is great it's just a long wait time and the drinks are good too it's good for girls night out self don't go by what else no one else says I was referred here by a natural Salon in Plainfield on Central Avenue we went there at customer appreciation night I love the way she does my hair so I thought I'd give it a try and I was overly satisfied
Cassie R.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",0,2,,3.0,8/30/2017,The hostesses were absolutely awful. They both were rude and didn't even stop talking to each other when we walked up. It took 10 minutes for her to find us a table when several were open. They didn't seem very bright and had the biggest sticks shoved up there you know what's. They were so awful I'm taking two stars off. The food it's self was incredible. Huge portions and absolute perfection. I had the Chicken Bellagio and my partner had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Our waiter was amazing. He was on top of us the entire time refilling drinks and clearing plates. Our cheesecake was wonderful and brought in a timely manner. If it weren't for the terrible service we received before our meals began I'd  be giving this restaurant 5/5 stars.
Homer S.,"Homestead, FL",41,3,,5.0,7/8/2017,When you walk into a chain you have been to serval times you pretty much know what you are going to get from a food perspective. The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best around. However what I focus on when I walk into chain is actually not the food but the customer service. I set at the Bar and my bartender Crystal was amazing!! Super friendly and very knowledge!! I would go back here just for her. Also the cheesecake is fire but you already knew that :-)
Tami B.,"Round Rock, TX",18,16,9,1.0,3/18/2017,"Completely awful visit. We checked in at 5:39, were told an hour and a half wait. It is now 7:52 and we are still waiting for a table. Every time we ask how much longer, we are told just a few more minutes. We could have taken our kids to another restaurant by now, but they kept saying just a few more minutes. This is utter nonsense."
Terry W.,"Dunellen, NJ",42,54,15,3.0,2/11/2017,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, but I received a gift card from someone and on a long work evening, I grabbed up my husband and we went to this location near our home. I loved the decor, very large but inviting. There was a wait of about 10 minutes for a 2 top and so we made our way to the bar to wait.  I ordered one of their new signature cocktails; cucumber mojito - it was very good and I appreciated the bar tender letting me know it was gin and not rum before making it for me.  I prefer gin, but it was nice he thought to ask.  We were buzzed and got our table. It took a bit for our waiter to show up and when he did he looked at our table and said ""oh, you got drinks already, I'll get some bread"" and walked away.  That was it! No hi, no do you have questions on the menu, have you been here before, welcome - nothing and then he was gone - for a good ten minutes! He came back and just seemed like he was bothered to even wait on us - had a bit of an attitude.  Asked for our order, we order the chicken pot stickers to share, I got the catfish and my husband got a combo of Steak Diane and shrimp.  He repeated the orders and my husband asked for a glass of the house cab as well - that seemed to throw him off.  He asked ""you want it now?"" Yes, yes he did. lol  He then repeated our order and left. The glass of wine and our appetizer was delivered by a runner.   The pot stickers were ok.  We love potstickers and I thought I would really like them, but the chicken was a bit heavy for the light potsticker shell and fell out on every bit and seemed thick and mushy.  The soy was good, over all, I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't terrible. Our meals came and the waiter again seemed pissed off to be there - the placed the dishes in front of us and I had to act quickly as he turned to ask if I could have some extra lemon - he had already turned and was walking away! No asking if we needed anything else, no words, nothing, *slam, here's your plates, goodbye*. He brought back a small cup of lemon slices for me but literally kind of slid it onto the table as he walked by.  My husband looked at me and said ""guess he's in a mad rush for the next tip he won't get"". The catfish was good, not great, but good.  The mashed potatoes were heavy and dry.  The green beans were so far overcooked they were shriveled up bits of blackened green on my plate.  I ate one, pushed them aside.  The country corn was nice, with a bacon-y flavor with a huge amount of corn silk in it. My husband ate his with little comment, he was hungry, but afterwards said it was just *ok*.   We thought to possible get some cheesecake, after all, that is the name of the place. Someone came and took our plates, and the next thing we know, our waiter is there with words! lol  He says ""want anything else?"" Wow.  What a salesman! My husband then says ""no, I think we'll pick up someone on the way out to go"".  He walks away, and comes back five minutes later to do his slide and run again, this time with the check. By that time I had my coat and and just wanted to leave - ever feel like you're not welcome some place? Yeah, that was the feeling.  We won't be back.  What a shame."
Susanne M.,"Topeka, KS",37,124,66,4.0,5/1/2017,Cheesecake Factory is generally expensive and offers huge dishes!  I was able to sit outside on a gorgeous night. Drinks were good & strong.  Pasta was al dente & tossed in sauce without being Too much.  It was called mac & cheese but was more like vodka cream sauce. Service is good but slow movers in general.  I was in no hurry so it was nice.
Edward C.,"Warren, NJ",469,11,,5.0,5/27/2017,Cheese cake is bombingly delicious! Definitely worth going! Always crowded at night time means it's Waldo's has great business!
Sara M.,"Plainfield, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,Absolutely horrible. Brought my cousin here to celebrate her birthday. The waiter took 30 min to get our drinks. Our food came out before the drinks did. Then I asked the waiter to do a happy birthday candle with the Cheesecake. Never did it. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.
Rosa G.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",266,111,210,5.0,12/3/2016,"Met my bff's last  night -- 7 loud ladies exchanging Christmas  gifts  at happy hour did not rattle our server ERICA.. she was amazing. We never had an empty cocktail glass, good was flowing it literally felt like it was just us!! Excellent service & great food &  drinks"
Dhyan H.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",12,16,74,4.0,10/9/2016,I know it's a chain restaurant. Food menu is extensive. Some dishes are good and some average. We had:  Tex mex egg rolls - tasty Pasta DaVinci - ok. Lacking sauce Baja tacos - good What stood out was the service. We sat outdoor and unfortunately it rained. The staff was very mindful and helping.  Sure there is an hour long line. Give them a chance. Cheerz
