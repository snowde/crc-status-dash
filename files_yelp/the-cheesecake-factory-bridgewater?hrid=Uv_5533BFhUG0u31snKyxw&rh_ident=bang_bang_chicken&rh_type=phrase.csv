Kat M.,"Bridgewater, United States",64,158,,4.0,7/6/2012,Cheesecake Factory - thank you for satisfying my   and shrimp cravings. Your fried avocado eggrolls are awesome too. And so is your chocolate cake.

For apps I love to start off with the buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls! My favorites dishes are the   and shrimp and eggplant parm, sooo good! Top that off with some cheesecake for a perfect night out!"
