Jonnie H.,"Bridgewater, NJ",42,8,,5.0,3/29/2016,So glad they made a restaurant closer to my house. Parking is a problem sometimes but that's the entirety of Bridgewater mall. Friendly staff. Never had a problem that wasn't resolved in some way before I went home.
Dave J.,"New York, NY",28,270,166,3.0,10/14/2014,Here's the deal...This chain is consistant and offers a variety of tasty menu items.  Service here was above & beyond the norm.
Sam D.,"Charlotte, NC",23,192,123,4.0,10/9/2014,"Always a fan of Cheesecake Factory for dinner but lunch I'll reconsider next time. Food was great as always but the service was a bit slow for lunch. I arrived around 11:30am and only 2 other customers were seated but lunch still snailed out. Regardless, the food was great. I had the lunch Shepard's Pie which was delicious."
Corie L.,"Neshanic Sta, NJ",0,2,,1.0,5/8/2016,"I wouldn't even give the single star if the option allowed me to post without a rating. Ineffective, rude, unprofessional hostess staff. We made reservations a week in advance for Mother's Day. The hostess knew nothing of the reservation when we checked in. After a 45 minute wait, we left. Ridiculous. Stay away."
Vicki R.,"RICHMOND HILL, NY",280,31,,4.0,5/21/2014,"Believe it or not The Cheesecake factory might be my favorite restaurant. It is not fancy, but is always good and has a giant menu. Def my go to place,"
Veronica C.,"Manville, NJ",0,14,1,4.0,8/11/2016,I go here a lot and anything i've ever gotten is delicious! so many options and their cheesecake is to die for!
Laura P.,"New York, NY",847,391,238,4.0,8/21/2012,"Cheesecake Factories are a popular place, so it's never surprising to me that the wait on any given day at any given hour is, at a minimum, twenty minutes. However, surprisingly enough, my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory, with my family on a Sunday around 12:30PM, did not come with a wait and we were seated immediately. The menu is overwhelming, especially for people who have never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Two of the people I was with had never had it before and found it hard to choose just one thing to order. Our waiter was very friendly and suggested some of his favorite dishes. Clad in the classic Cheesecake Factory white outfit, our waiter was a young guy with spunk, very eager to take our orders and bring us our food. I traditionally get an appetizer as a meal because of how daunting I find the rest of the menu, as well as the portions of the regular size entrees. I got the cheeseburger sliders and a ""small plate"" of cheese quesadillas. We ordered the customary fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer to share, which absolutely blew the minds of the two who had never had them before. The mac and cheese balls are really one of the best foods to get at a Cheesecake Factory, or pretty much an restaurant.  And of course I got the raspberry lemonade, complete with crushed sugar around the rim of the big glass. I absolutely adore this drink from the Cheesecake Factory and find pure joy in the very existence of it.  The decor of this Cheesecake Factory was nice, as they all are. I think it could be classified as Grecian decor? Or European in general? I'll get back to you on that.  We were celebrating a birthday during this particular visit, and about six waiters sang ""Happy Birthday"" and brought a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle to the birthday boy. The cake was incredible and was surrounded on its plate with homemade whipped cream. A+ in my book. No matter how long you have to wait to be seated at a Cheesecake Factory, it is always worth the wait. I waited two and a half hours on Valentine's Day with a big group of friends and dates and we all decided by the time we were seated at 10:30PM that it was well, well worth the wait. This experience at this Cheesecake Factory was no different, even though we didn't have to wait at all for the always amazing experience."
Kristen L.,"Bedford, NH",26,9,5,2.0,7/20/2015,"I've been to plenty of cheese cake factory's before and this one by far needs to improve on there customer service skills!! God awful!!! Hostess & Host zero personality.. Waiter never checked back to see if we liked our food, or if we needed a refill on beverage.... Totally not impressed.....good thing the food is consistent! And the cheese cake is amazing! But would not visit any time soon! You need Trump to do some ""your fired"" at your restaurant!!!!"
Sudhir M.,"Rahway, NJ",44,52,223,4.0,9/19/2014,"A restaurant chain, some people like it and some don't, but from the many times I have been to the Cheesecake Factory, I find all their dishes on the menu to be quite good. Also haven't really heard anyone with a real bad comment about its food. Apart from the food, they also have a bar and a great ambience/interior decoration which is consistent throughout all their restaurants. While their dessert (Cheesecake) is what they are known for, their appetizers and entrees are also a delight. My favorite at the restaurant is the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (Shrimp, Chicken, Andouille Sausage, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions and Garlic Simmered in a Spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. Topped with Steamed White Rice). An appetizer I tried this time was the Tex Mex Eggrolls (Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese served with Sour Cream and Salsa). Tip: Relish the freshly baked wheat bread with butter that is complimentary."
Kasey C.,"Hackettstown, NJ",2,38,4,5.0,10/7/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is so so amazing I can not put it into words! The menu is HUGE so be prepared to sit there for a little and have a hard time deciding what to get. I try something different every time and have never had a bad meal. The service is good but could be better they are slow but I think that is because the place is so huge and is always packed so I will let them slide for that. I recommend the Mac and cheese burger, best burger I have ever had."
Cat L.,"Montgomery, NJ",10,29,25,4.0,10/6/2014,i placed an order over the phone for fish tacos and fried mac & cheese I got there with in 20 minutes and the food was already ready. The mac & cheese was good but I wish it was lobster mac & cheese that would be extra delicious. The fish tacos are subpar the tortilla wrap was fried and it was kind of soggy. The fish I got fried not grilled and it tasted just like fried fish  you couldn't taste any seasonings other than lime juice. The black beans and the rice was phenomenal it was so yummy but it was like on the side. they gave you four fish tacos and those tacos were literally the size of my hand. over all I would recommended it for people who like large portions of food. it's definitely not something  for food adventurists. The service was excellent though very quick very fast and they friendly. I didn't tip because I did takeout and it turned out to be around $25
S S.,"Montville, NJ",0,14,,4.0,7/6/2016,"We always shunned chain restaurants prior to having a baby. Now that we have a child and cannot go to upscale sit-down restaurants in fear that we might ruin other people's dining experience, The Cheesecake Factory seems awesome. The vast selection of food is great and the loud background noise can muffle sounds of agitated babies. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service."
M N.,"Middlesex, NJ",0,7,,3.0,6/8/2016,"Came here yesterday with my boyfriend and parents for dinner. Service was really slow and it took about twenty minutes to even receive bread. The food was pretty good; I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken, my boyfriend ordered the four cheese penne, my dad ordered the hibachi steak and my mom ordered the steak tacos. The only bad item was the steak tacos. The rice it came with was odd tasting and the steak tacos lacked flavor. However the cheesecake made up for it! I prefer the location in Edison. Faster service and the area is much bigger."
Brooke Y.,"Hellertown, PA",6,62,5,3.0,7/6/2015,The food was good until I noticed a hair in my salad. The waiter did apologize and got me another one pretty quickly. My husband and daughter both thought their meal was mediocre. Waiter was slow and a little flighty. Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was to die for. That is all. Would def go back for that.
Jessica P.,"South Plainfield, NJ",80,15,6,5.0,9/22/2015,I love this particular location as I usually have no issues finding parking and even on the weekend the wait isn't too bad. The food is always good and so is the customer service. I've had large groups here and as long as you call ahead they are very accommodating. You won't be disappointed.
Joshua S.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",128,26,286,4.0,4/15/2012,"Pros:  friendly service,  good food,  and most of all love the atmosphere in here.  Cons:  large portions but that is a minor issue I would go back there"
Denny S.,"Rochester, NY",211,354,1012,4.0,5/11/2014,"What I love about cheesecake factory: 1. Happy hour w/decent food 4-6pm 2. Great service. 3. Good menu selection for happy hour. 4. Outdoor seating to hang out What I don't really love about cheesecake factory: 1. Although its called cheesecake factory, i am not a big fan of their cheesecake. I personally think it's just okay. 2. The regular menu is too much selection and it can be very confusing. 3. In my opinion, if they revamp their menu and have something more interesting. It would be really cool. Don't get me wrong for someone who lives in central/north jersey, I am grateful having a cheesecake factory around."
Tyler A.,"Green Brook, NJ",63,185,395,2.0,4/13/2014,"I do not ever leave here thinking, ""I'm happy I came here!"" I have a very negative opinion about the place, it's due to the oversized menu and the way the food comes out of the kitchen. Also, what self respecting restaurant serves drinks and condiments in plastic? I will never understand why CCF is so popular."
Eero D.,"Neshanic Station, NJ",15,7,,1.0,8/12/2015,The service tonight was terrible. We're leaving to get a cheesecake elsewhere on the way home. 17 minutes in between my dish and my wife's. We had to continually track down waiter who was NOT overwhelmed. We never received any drink refills. Embarrassing and terrible.
Hannah Jayne H.,"Springfield, MO",86,20,4,2.0,1/24/2014,"Let's just start out calling it like it is: service nightmare, but same good food I've come to expect at one of these restaurants.  I thought this trip to this Cheesecake Factory was going to be awesome! We  walked right in the door and were seated immediately. That NEVER happens at any Cheesecake Factory, so I had super high hopes for the rest of my visit.  But it was pretty much all downhill from there. We waited 35 minutes before someone even came to talk to us. I would've been more understanding, but besides a few people at the bar, we were in an otherwise empty restaurant.  We waited extraordinarily long periods of time between getting water, ordering drinks and then having our order taken. We tried to do it all at once after our server's long disappearance but she kept telling us she'd come back and take our order later. We also never got that super wonderful basket of bread that you usually get (we asked for it after we realized that it wasn't coming)... People should know better than to deprive a girl of her sweet, sweet carbohydrates!!! After our food came out we never saw our original server again. We had to flag someone down and ask for our check. Someone else finally came over and he was pretty awesome! He apologized profusely after we explained our situation to him and he was super quick in getting us boxes for our food, a slice of cheesecake to go and our check.  Long story short: the food gets the first star and our second server gets the second. As far as Cheesecake Factory goes this definitely was not my best experience."
