Max B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,5,1,3.0,7/16/2015,Disappointing service. Asked to be seated outside and were treated as if we asked the worst question ever. Asked for umbrella to be opened and were told that they would see if it was possible. Food is mediocre at best. Our server was  completely inattentive and could not be found to get an extra drink ordered or refill.  there are many many other places that you can go to where service and food will make your evening but this location is definitely not one of them.
Ahmed S.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,6,39,3.0,8/15/2015,"I have been going to the cheese factory since it first opened up near me in Bridgewater. I like going there to sit outside during the summer time. The food is great and the outside seating is awesome. The service is decent even though I never encounter the same servers ever and it seems that they always have new ones working there. I hate the music they play. It is nothing to enjoy during the summer or over dinner. Also, their prices are a bit too high for the kind of food they offer. Not a great selection of beer on tap."
Scarlet S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,6,,1.0,1/4/2016,Horrible experience. Went here to celebrate my graduation. After the waiter came back for the second time to take our order they didn't have what I tried to order off their everyday menu then after choosing something else they brought out a cold steak. Absolutely horrible. Terrible place. Absolutely will never go back. Ruined my graduation celebration. Horrible horrible restaurant.
Dylan D.,"Skillman, NJ",25,48,12,3.0,9/17/2014,"Just getting back from a night out with my parents. The food was ok but some of our favorites were taken off the menu. Our waitress was very personable when she was around. She also found a way for the kitchen chefs to make my moms favorite salad. Despite being accommodating, she wasn't around to check on our table enough. Our dinner and bread plates weren't taken away at all. We left and the bread appetizer plates were still on out table along with the dinner plates. I don't get to treat my parents out to dinner often because of my busy schedule with work and my pet sitting business so I was hoping this night would be special. I don't know if I would go here for another special occasion again. I would go back for a regular lunch but not for anything special."
Rabbit S.,"Readington Township, NJ",21,6,1,5.0,4/21/2014,"God, the selection...the cheesecake? Chain restaurant? You'd never know it going here! Staff, selection, GF menu... It's a personal favorite. ;)"
Kristin R.,"Middlesex, NJ",11,96,44,2.0,2/16/2015,"Came here last night at 6 pm and the place was jam packed and extremely crowded, to the point where there was no place to wait inside (without being in someone's way). I got told that it would be a 45 minute wait for my friend & I and we ended up having to wait an hour and 15 minutes. Then when we FINALLY got seated, we got a nasty waitress who barely waited on us and was rude. The food came out fast at least and I was absolutely starving by the time it did. Note to self: don't come here on the weekend!"
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1731,1526,245,3.0,11/22/2011,"I went here a while ago and never reviewed the place.  It's your typical CF. Thank goodness there was no wait when we went during the week. The bartender we had was super friendly and quite a character. I was trying to keep it healthy...yeah funny...going to CF and being healthy...but I tried, not knowing what I ordered was unhealthy although you would think healthy. I had the grilled turkey burger on a ww bun...no mayo or anything and a side salad. It was good. No cheesecake for dessert although I have had them  before. One of my fav's is Raspberry/Lemon...yummy...but you cannot go wrong on any of their cheesecakes... Their menu is extensive. It's a book. Their food is marginal at best.  It's actually pricey too...drinks and cheesecake add up. :-)"
Jeff M.,"Salisbury Mills, NY",0,12,1,4.0,5/17/2015,"So something happened in the kitchen that resulted in two out of our three meals coming out badly, one needed to be sent back and completely remade.  The waitress got the manager though an they took care of it and made everything right.  I don't expect a perfect meal every time, but I expect that when things go wrong they make it right, and they did."
Mary D.,"Bridgewater, NJ",26,2,,1.0,7/4/2015,The food is okay here. It always comes out cold! The service is really really bad! Every time I come! The only reason I come is it's in my neighbourhood and I like the cheesecake.
Sara M.,"Montville, NJ",10,81,39,4.0,2/19/2015,The food is okay but who really goes there for the food. I love the red velvet cheesecake which is a problem! Waitress was great and I would definitely come back to this location.
Sammy G.,"Albany, NY",168,555,378,3.0,7/26/2011,"I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan but on the occasion I will go to one and this time it was Cheesecake Factory. It's not connected through the mall so you have to walk outside to get to it. We didn't have to wait at all, but I think it was before the rush around 5:30 because when we left there was a wait list at 6:45. I don't think if there was a wait I would actually wait for it, the food is pretty good but not enough for me to wait 20 minutes to sit.  The menu is huge, there are tons of things to choose from and a variety of drinks and desserts. I rarely go here because there aren't many vegan options, some vegetarian but I don't think you can really eat vegan here, not that I know of off hand. I ordered the Four Cheese Pasta, I've never really gotten anything different, it's really good! Like everyone else said, the portions are HUGE. They give you free bread in the beginning, so it fills you up as well. It is tastey. Dessert, it is called ""Cheesecake"" Factory. And there are tons to choose from, I've had a few different ones and they're always delicious. I ended up getting the Red Velvet Cheesecake and it was a lot bigger then most! It's taller and wider, more layers and it's fantastic! I ordered it with someone else and after eating dinner we couldn't even finish it even though we split it! If you've never been, I would say try this place and see what you think. Out of the chains, I do like this one."
Drew E.,"Manville, NJ",164,13,,5.0,6/29/2015,"This place never disappoints. I've been here many times before but this was my first time since downloading the Yelp app.  This place is always busy when I come in but never fails to seat me within 10 minutes. The staff are friendly and prompt. They tend to your needs but don't dilly dally.  This time, my girlfriend and I had some sort of fried buffalo chicken appetizer to start. The only issue was that the portion size was too big, so we had leftovers for lunch the next day. We always order the same entrees and they come out as delicious as usual. The prices are great considering the portion size and we always look forward to going back."
Mrunal S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,4,,4.0,6/21/2015,"They have amazing cheese cakes , but the food was mediocre .. Maybe because we visited during a busy weekend .. I ordered some pasta and they forgot to add few things to it as I had asked .. Chef was good enough to come out and apologize and fix it for me"
Andy C.,"Edison, NJ",0,9,,1.0,3/27/2016,Customer service is garbage here. Went in to purchase a few slices of cheesecake with my mother and the guy at the counter treated us like crap. He was insinuating that we couldn't afford to purchase food at the restaurant. Will never go here again!
Charlotte L.,"New York, NY",0,49,,4.0,3/27/2016,Had a delicious Greek salad appetizer along with steak tacos (would've preferred to have the ingredients and put them together myself - do they call that fajitas?) while my friend had almond-crusted salmon salad.  This is my friend's favorite place and she was so excited that I was amenable to going there after our jewelry shopping foray earlier in the day.  I know that the service at CF can be hit-or-miss. Today's was good!
Deborah N.,"Hillsborough, NJ",68,24,,3.0,7/25/2013,"Just once, I'd like to walk in the door and be seated right away. I've been three times and each time my wait was upwards of one hour - usually two or more hours. Because it's a chain and the menu isn't inspired, the food really isn't worth the amount of time you're waiting for it. If you come on a weekend or special day like Mother's Day, the wait will be at least two hours. If you come during the week, expect to wait 45 minutes to one hour. The food is OK. My last visit is probably my last visit because I'm not waiting hours for overpriced chain food anymore."
Crystal R.,"Raritan, NJ",0,3,,1.0,10/26/2015,"Always have mediocre food. Menu is so large and varied, they are definitely ""jack of all trades, master of none...."" Food tastes like pre made frozen fare. Overpriced Applebee's style food. In general, I would give it 3 stars or so but tonight's meal was especially bad. Not my favorite place, but ended up here this evening because I had a gift card with money still left on it. Gift card was since Christmas 2014, so obviously I'm not a fan of going there or it wouldn't have sat in my wallet for almost a year.  I noticed after the fact that we were never offered bread. Other tables around us received some. By the time I noticed, I was well into the meal. food took forever to come out even though the place was not especially busy tonight. I ordered a factory burger. Figured they couldn't mess a burger up too much. Burger comes out with two small pieces of meat on sourdough bread, cheese isn't even melted on, and it has no caramelized onions on it. By the time our server came back to check on us, I had already eaten about half of it. Was I supposed to sit around staring at it while it got cold? Told her about the onions. She apologized but then the only remedy was I had to wait another 5-10 min for her to come back with a bowl of caramelized onions that I could add to my now-cold half of a burger. Uh, thanks???? was not even offered a free dessert or anything. Took her forever to get the check to us and she didn't even give me a pen for me to sign it with. Had to use my own from my purse. To top off the evening, I've felt sick all night since eating there. Bloated and just unwell.... I feel better after eating a #2 meal at Wendy's, and that's not exactly a good feeling.  This has not been a favorite place of mine, but after this experience I'm definitely not going back."
Karen L.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",18,36,,1.0,4/3/2015,Beware when you order a skinny girl during happy hour it probably has little or no alcohol content!!!!! On an empty stomach 3 have no effect at all!!!??????
Nicole P.,"Manhattan, NY",245,318,31,3.0,11/1/2013,"I wanted to give this store a higher review, considering my experience inside the store was so much better than the experience I had on the phone with an employee. I called on Wednesday night to order a cheesecake for my coworker's birthday. I was given a gift certificate to use for CF so this was the primary reason why I wanted to order here. The girl who answered put me on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up. I called back and was put on hold for another 5 minutes. I hung up and called back. The same girl that was playing phone games decided she was finally ready to take my order. I ordered one 7"" pumpkin cheesecake and I asked for the cake to be taken out at 11am the next day to give it plenty of time to thaw out by late afternoon. When I came in Thursday, I was informed that the girl that took my order the night prior on the phone never put the order in! Thank goodness the gentleman behind the bakery counter was very friendly, competent, and helpful. He quickly brought out a chilled pumpkin cheesecake for me and apologized. I told him not to worry as it was not his error and thanked him for his assistance. The pumpkin cheesecake was definitely a treat for the palate. Ladies, if you save up your calories one day, this cheesecake is well worth the mileage."
M B.,"Chatham, NJ",4,19,8,3.0,6/15/2014,"For a chain, three stars is high praise!  The selection is vast and the service was attentive (we were eating in the middle of a shift change and the new waiter came over to introduce himself and ask if we needed anything). My favorite dish was the Santorini Salad - a faro based salad that was sublime.  The rest of the food was well prepared and special requests were honored.  My waiter forgot if I wanted to omit the feta cheese or the beets so both were left off the salad and brought to me in side dishes so I could add the one I wanted, and leave off the one I did not.  The only thing that really bothers me about this place is the cavernous sites they all occupy - so noisy!!!  It's hard to take after a while.  I recommend going on off hours if you hate cacophony."
