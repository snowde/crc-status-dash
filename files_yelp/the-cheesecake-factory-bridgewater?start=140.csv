Scott S.,"Wildwood, NJ",2,271,135,5.0,11/28/2014,First time here.  Wow not what I expected.  I expected a small place with just desert. Just the opposite.  Fancy inside w bar.  Large menu.  Had the clam chowder it was great.   Then a chicken parm sandwich which was great. Will be back
Jennifer C.,"Bound Brook, NJ",3,8,1,5.0,1/8/2015,"I again find myself at the Cheesecake Factory and this time in  Bridgewater New Jersey.  The hostess who gave me my little flashing fab to announce when my table was ready was absolutely delightful, smiling and bubbly and always being polite. I got sat in a really comfortable little space (which isn't always the case when you're a party of one)  and the server  Reina was there right away. She was more than a spectacular help with all the appetizers as I am allergic to garlic and raw onion. I ordered my favorite entrée, chicken Bellagio, which was delicious and she never left me hanging for additional water or wine.  She so graciously helped me find a dessert that did not have cheesecake in it, as I do not like cheesecake, and then informed me that she could pack it up in a great way to take it back to my hotel so I could eat it tomorrow (The chicken filled me up too much).  I am a big fan of the cheesecake factory in general but this stop at the Bridgewater cheesecake factory was well beyond what I usually expect. Bravo to the server Reina -she's a class act.  So if you have a chance and you can go to the Bridgewater Commons Mall please don't miss the cheesecake factory and Reina's spectacular service"
Richard R.,"Somerville, NJ",7,100,7,1.0,11/8/2014,"Just another chain cranking out crappy food if u ask me, I will go to McCormick's over cheesecake any day of the week."
Joe N.,"Watchung, NJ",0,60,,3.0,10/13/2014,"The food options are good.  The food quality is good.  The noise level is high.  The cheesecakes are mostly great.  The service is hot and cold--or should I say fast and slow.  Bar service is not good.  Sent drinks back many times.  (Old Fashion with no fruit; Martinis ($12 bucks) messed up; duplicate drinks with different quantities of liquid.) just sloppy craftsmanship.  Maybe I caught the trainee session but who needs that aggravation.  Good for them, they do employ a lot of people but I am not in a hurry to return."
Espio R.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,3,,4.0,2/5/2015,Ordered the meatloaf very good and moist lots of flavor.had enough to take home . Passion fruit mojito is my go to and never disappoints.our waiter was fast and on point my son enjoyed his pepporoni pizza
John R.,"Warren, NJ",152,1133,296,3.0,12/9/2010,"Cheesecake Factory? I never thought of ever going here based on the name but I am glad I now know it is much more than dessert. The offerings come from a very large menu and seem to cover almost every desire. For lunch I found the Grilled Portabella on Bun to be quite tasty and going back I am sure I would try something else, as like I already said, the selection is very large. Downside - $3.95 for a lemonade? At 35% the cost of the entree this seems a little steep."
Michele G.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",24,42,,3.0,9/27/2014,Service is inconsistent. We usually have to wait a while for food. Sometimes no one comes to our table for initial drink orders for a good 15 minutes. Food is decent. Like the small plates and appetizers the most. Bread is awesome.
Maurie A.,"PARSIPPANY, NJ",6,73,21,5.0,12/18/2012,"Don't let the chain part fool ya! There are SO many choices you can likely go there for 30 days straight and not have the same thing twice. My sis got the garlic-lemon chicken and I WISH I had. They messed it up initially but recooked it and it was DELISH! Yep, I sampled. I had the Harissa Chicken, which was good, just not as good as hers. Of course cheesecake was in order, so Pumpkin Pecan ruled the day!   Bottom line: Run to this place! Good food, good service and good times!"
Bruce L.,"Pebble Beach, CA",43,20,1,3.0,8/26/2014,"Love the place, but are you kidding me ... out of wings at 7pm on a Tuesday night?  Advised 20 minutes after ordering. Handled nicely by the manager, but really?"
Tamika H.,"South River, NJ",3,47,17,5.0,2/2/2013,The staff were fast and very pleasant. The food was good as it always is at any Cheesecake Factory. One of my favorite spots! I love the lemon herb chicken it comes with carrots and mash potatoes. The flavor is so delicious and the meat is always so tender and juicy.
Domenic F.,"King of Prussia, PA",134,399,12,5.0,11/16/2010,Amazing....had a sunday morning brunch here and it was truly huge.   I mean there must have been like 8 eggs in it.   The burrito itself was excellent. What more can i say....this place rocks.
Davetta P.,"Rio Rancho, NM",1,2,,2.0,10/1/2014,"The shrimp scampi was breaded which I do not prefer. I was disappointed with the seasoning and the flavoring overall. The waiting staff seems to have ego running their decision making, therefore the service was sub par. The pasta on my dish was served in a mold of a cup with no seasoning whatsoever. Hugely disappointed. The next day I ate at Maggiono's and got the shrimp scampi that I was expecting all  along."
James B.,"Princeton, NJ",0,12,8,1.0,9/2/2013,"How is it possible to be seated, order and watch other customers be seated after me, eat and pay for their orders and I am still sitting here waiting for my order?  Questioning our waitress only to have her ask if I would like my order deleted; instead of just saying sorry!  As I am writing this review the waitress brings my check and does not ask if we would like anything else ""my son wants chocolate cheeses cake"" or I would have just pay and leave never to return!"
Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,845,26,3.0,10/21/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory but I've gotta knock this place down a star due to some recent experiences.  Let me be completely clear - I love the food at CF and think they are one of, if not, the best chain restaurant.  The food quality is so far above the other chains it's comical.  Everything I've ever had here has been awesome.  The apps are great - love the Buffalo blasts, Ahi Tartare and everything else I've tried.  Salads are seriously the best I've ever had and they make very good sandwiches and burgers.  Very good fish tacos, as well.  Whatever you get, you will like and the portions are enormous.   The place is an absolute mad house (almost always) - mostly because it's located right in the heart of the busy Bridgewater mall.  But, that's not why I'm knocking it down a star.  You almost always have to wait at least 20-25 minutes for a table, but you can always enjoy a drink at the bar.  Be warned though - the drink prices are borderline rip offs.  It's about $8 for a beer which is a little silly.  My wife and I typically try and grab a table by in the bar section to eat since they are first come, first serve. The reason I'm knocking this place down a star is that the service has been so miss recently.  We've had incomplete orders, very long wait times for the food and some pretty bad overall service.  It's definitely a slight change for this place because they never used to be like this.  I actually ordered the same salad on my last 2 visits and they forgot the exact same ingredient both times.  Without me even saying anything, the food runner noticed they had forgotten it and said he would bring it out to me.  I never saw him again.  Oh well.   I think you'll always like the food at this place, but it really has turned into quite an adventure.  I'm still going to continue to come, but I might have to temper my expectations.  I am super happy because it is Fall again and they do have Pumpkin Cheesecake back.  It's amazing.  Every piece of cheesecake I have tried here has always been great.  It's one of the best ways that you can end a meal and you can also easily get it to go."
Rao A.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,1,,4.0,7/28/2013,"Stopped here with family after a long day of shopping at commons. Oh man what a refreshing taste they were all. The choco souffle was extraordinary.  The service was quick. Nice atmosphere and kids loved it too. Now wondering what took me so long to try put this great desert fare. Its raining cats & dogs outside and i wish i wouldnt have left my seat at choco factory. I would telish the taste for all nite long. The new york chese cake, strawberry dippers are my favorites."
Chris C.,"Warren, NJ",27,17,2,5.0,5/21/2014,"The menu's huge (great selection), the service is great, & the Cheesecake is as good as you would expect from a place that bears the word in it's name."
Mark H.,"Secaucus, NJ",55,50,18,4.0,4/21/2014,"I never understood why people always raved about CCF, the previous two times I had dined there, the food was nothing special but always accompanied with a long wait. When my wife and mother-in-law wanted to go there for Easter dinner I was reluctant.   I had never been to this specific CCF before, so I decided to ""go with the flow"" and agreed. We waited for a table about 1/2 hour but considering it was Easter, I guess that's not all that bad. We were greeted by our waiter almost immediately upon being seated. He was such a nice, extremely personal guy and had a really great attitude especially considering that he was working on Easter Sunday. We ordered our drinks and he offed to bring some bread to our table. I had a Margarita on the rocks w/ salt. It was so so...a bit sour for my taste. Since it WAS Easter I decided to treat myself and I ordered the fillet Mignon. Wow, what a difference from my other visits. I guess that was the right thing to order because it was probably top 10 pieces of meat I've ever ordered. It was cooked perfectly and really had a great taste to it. It was salty which I like. Right up there with some of the better steakhouses I've ate at. I'm not a big dessert person so i didn't have any cake but my wife did and I guess she liked it because it was gone in less than 5. Coffee was alright...like the clear mugs. I'd like to bring up our server again because he really was good at what he does...I wish I remembered his name so I could give him credit. But he had dark curly hair and dark rimmed glasses and a soft voice. Not only was he friendly, but he also knew the menu very well and effectively described the items in question. He also made suggestions and went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of. A server of this caliber you usually don't see at a chain restaurant. The business should consider themselves luck to have such a great employee.  $125 for the 3 of us with 2 drinks each and fillet...not bad for Easter Sunday. Did I mention that it was Easter Sunday enough times in this review?"
Dana M.,"New York, NY",101,267,96,4.0,2/28/2014,This place ALWAYS has a wait - but it is worth it if you do wait. Nicely decorated (as is every other Cheese cake factory). The food portions are really big and the food is really creamy. The people are friendly and pleasant.
Michael T.,"Flemington, NJ",23,37,,5.0,9/13/2013,"LOVE the Cheescake Factory.  Menu is huge, almost overwhelming!  The skinnylicious menu is great if you are trying to eat healthy.  I have never had anything that I didn't like.  Service is great and staff is really friendly!"
Leslie S.,"Bedminster, NJ",8,27,,2.0,8/21/2011,"If you want frozen food that is fried or reheated, this is your place. I have tried this specific Cheesecake Factory 3 times and really want to think next time will be better but unfortunately it keeps falling short.  Too busy, and not enough staff in my opinion. My table asked for more bread, and we never got it but the tables next to us did. It was also tough to catch the waiter for a refill.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken, which you could see was chicken fingers just dipped in sauce. I ordered the Renee special for lunch which comes with a soup (broccoli cheese) which was like mushy baby food. The chicken salad sandwich was okay but I had to take off the bread because I felt like it was doused in butter and it was pretty intense. We didn't order cheesecake but I would come back only for cheesecake in the future since you really cant go wrong with it. The Reeses Cheesecake is very good I have to say.   FYI-They do not have a mall entrance to the restaurant so you do have to walk around the outside."
