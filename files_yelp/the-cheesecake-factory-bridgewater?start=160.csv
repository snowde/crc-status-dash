Jessica F.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",29,21,9,1.0,9/19/2014,"Today just reassured me the reason I have always thought this is the most overrated chain. I don't know what people see in this place! They are the slowest place ever. Today as soon as I sat down I told the waitress I was in a hurry and placed my drink and food order without even looking at the menu. She said ok..25 minutes later my friends get their drinks...5 minutes later they get there food. And I don't even have my drink after a half hour when I was the one that said I was in a hurry. As my drink came out after 35 minutes I told the waitress to cancel my food as I didn't have time (on lunch break). The remark I got from her was ""I put it in even before their's"" not an I'm sorry, it's on the house or anything. The manager came over without me asking and he was very nice and sympathetic, apologized,  and offer to wrap it up to go on the house. The only reason I would ever go back here is because this was the place I went on my first date with the man I love. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't return. If you are at the bridgewater mall go eat at the food court. Better food, cheap, fast, and better service actually haha"
Tama A.,"Miami, FL",162,34,116,5.0,3/24/2013,"The best! See Heather at the bar. She's absolutely awesome. :-) warm, friendly, offers superb customer service and made my penny spent worth while. And the meal that was suggested; green chilaquiles with carnitas and eggs were TO DIE FOR. Thanks Heather!!"
Diesel H.,"Milford, NJ",57,472,197,1.0,4/23/2013,"literally waited 2.5 hours for a table to hold 12 people [birthday party]. food was so mediocre its not even funny. basically applebees on crack as far as the menu goes. i literally didn't open anything but the skinny menu b/c even that was redic in calories-- and the other menu had WAY too many options. Americans love options, which I never understand.  The waitress was pretty rude. I understand it was a busy night, but c'mon dude, your income depends on this!! And she messed up our whole order. it was beyond frustrating. overrated. won't ever be back."
Helen W.,"Jersey City, NJ",46,277,2,3.0,8/27/2013,"The service was good.  Previously, they told us it would be a 30 min wait but ended up sitting us in like 10 mins so I was happy.  This cheesecake factory seemed bigger than the others I've been to.  Most of the food is usually good there."
Joy B.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,6,,4.0,1/29/2014,One of the best places for happy hour if you come early enough. Bar area fills up quickly. Margaritas are good. Amazing avocado egg rolls. Service is slow at times.
Abby B.,"East Meadow, NY",24,244,5,1.0,9/2/2010,"The good: beautiful restaurant and stellar wait service.   The bad: everything else It's bad enough that CF is notoriously un-veg-friendly (black beans cooked in beef broth, vegetable stir-fry cooked in oyster sauce, egg in just about everything: bread, pasta, avocado rolls, salad dressing), but I was still surprised by how badly my veggie meal was appropriated by an establishment who manages to prepare a veritable novel's worth of meals to perfection. I started with the edamame, which was served with bits of spaghetti mixed in, presumably from the shared boiling water.  Besides being tacky, since most of the pastas have an egg-base, I was not amused.  In addition, besides being grossly overcooked, the edamame were slick with what I hope was oil, but fear may have been butter... and the requisite sea salt was absent. Next I tried the white bean hummus.  A vegan dish by design, I was startled by the taste of cheese when I took my first bite.  A closer inspection determined the culprit; why would you melt cheese shreds onto the flatbread without a mention?  Finally, I ordered the fresh vegetable salad, minus the egg-laden pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  I also omitted the cheese and the apples, subbing avocado.  I was charged $1 for the addition of the avocado, but strangely was not credited for the deduction of the other ingredients.  I do not like being nickel & dimed-- especially when it only goes in one direction. Can't The Cheesecake Factory take a cue from other large chains and at least indicate allergens on their menu, at most become significantly more friendly to vegetarians and vegans? Major disappointment."
Mat T.,"ANNANDALE, NJ",13,20,78,4.0,6/15/2013,"My girlfriend and I Ended up eating here with a couple of friends after a sad let down next door. Usually we will just grab slices of Cheese Cake to go because the seating wait is crazy long and we usually get seated in that awkward area where your table is almost joined with the complete strangers you don't know. This time we sat out on the patio which was much better despite the musty cushions. The mini burgers ""hate calling them sliders"" were real good and the fried cheese triangles were tasty. Didn't notice what our friends got but they seemed pleased as for drinks you get what you order and there was no let down there. If your in the mood for a milkshake go for the flying gorilla but make that gorilla drunk by requesting some dark rum in it. The cheesecake was delicious as always and all and all the nite ended well."
Braden M.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,23,,3.0,1/18/2015,"Cannot stand the wait times. It's ridiculous. Who would wait an hour and a half for dinner? I guess that shows the place is a successful business and very popular, but it's just too much for me, not to mention bumping elbows with everyone in the vestibule is less than desirable.  The only reason I put up with this place is because my wife is a diehard. I would go elsewhere rather than wait, but I always experience courteous staff and hostesses who are extremely well trained and handle stress well. The food is fantastic, I can't say enough good things about that. No reservations. Agh!"
Stephen M.,"Rockaway, NJ",20,42,,2.0,8/11/2013,"The bread served before the meal was tasty enough.  I ordered a mushroom burger with fries.  It arrived quickly, but I did not find it anything exceptional. The reality of the poor burger was not  up to the hype depicted on the menu.  On the plus side, my waitress was pleasant and prompt. I don't think I will be returning here. The food is overpriced for the quality."
TJ T.,"Hackettstown, NJ",59,28,9,3.0,8/10/2013,"Food is fabulous but that is only part of the experience.  Part of it was my expectations when I entered. I was thinking that this was more of a chilis or outback sort of place given its locations (all of them are either in or by malls by me) but upon entering and looking at the menu it is obvious that this place is trying to be much more upscale than that. The prices reflect that too. I had a sandwich and my wife had a salad, my daughter had a kids meal, and we shared an appetizer and our bill was close to 100 dollars. Not that the food wasn't good, just felt it was slightly overpriced. Plus the service is slooooooow. Not a good place to take a 5 year old. Went back recently just to get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, and the service was even slower. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time if you're eating in or simply ordering something to go."
Brian L.,"Hoboken, NJ",65,713,8,4.0,11/18/2010,"Cheesecake Factory.  Yes, it is a chain.  Yes, you can have it basically anywhere.  But there is a reason why chains are chains...they're good! The prices are really good for entrees - especially for the amount of food that they give you.  $13 for the Chicken Bellagio?  That's legit.  Of course, the $8 22oz beers made up their margins, but whatever, I am always blinded by the cheapish entree prices! I am a fan of their entrees more than their cheesecake.  I'd rather get 2 entrees...piggy.  =o)"
Daniel B.,"Uniontown, OH",27,382,58,3.0,12/31/2012,Pretty standard fare for a chain. Consistent and reliable food at reasonable prices. Safe if you're traveling as you know what to expect. Not high end but good. Reasonable prices. I am not a cheesecake fan but theirs are good. A little expensive and very rich. My dessert lasted two days.
Peter V.,"Henderson, NV",9,68,4,3.0,1/4/2013,I have never heard anyone complain about their meal at this chain.  That said it is a safe place to go out because everyone can get something they like.  I have eaten at this one and one other in Nevada and it is consistent.  I have never seen anyone rave about their meal here though and I will leave it at that.
Justin N.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",100,39,12,3.0,9/11/2012,"Cheesecake is fun. Service is consistently friendly and attentive. Food is always good (well the adults food is), but while they are good for kids.. They just don't seem to be capable of mac & cheese. ""Confusing?"".. you say.. well it all really starts in the kitchen.. don't use the same spoon for salad that you would for mac & cheese!?! We continue to go and order it.. and I'm not sure why... funny right? But please Macaroni & Cheese isn't supposed to be a soupy mess with flecks of lettuce in it... and well, while we mention this at time of order.. it never fails.. out it comes, hot, delicious, soupy, and oh yeah, with our daily dose of vegetables... My wife looks at me, and I ask, waiter may I have a 22 ounce version of this beer please!"
David S.,"Middlesex, NJ",52,117,4,3.0,8/29/2010,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factories.  This one is the closest to where I live.  The calorie content of many of their meals, including salads, is enough for a full day, or the very least 2/3 of a day.  If you have an appetizer, meal and dessert, you've eaten enough calories to hold you over for 2 days.  Definitely not the place to go when you're trying to watch what you eat now that they post the calories on the menu. I've also visited this location with my wife for brunch, just to try it.  Personally, I'd rather go to a diner for a late breakfast than come here.  The only real reason to come here for brunch is for alcohol."
Kat M.,"Bridgewater, NJ",64,158,,4.0,6/7/2012,Cheesecake Factory - thank you for satisfying my Bang bang chicken and shrimp cravings. Your fried avocado eggrolls are awesome too. And so is your chocolate cake.
Scott S.,"Somerset, NJ",0,11,,3.0,1/5/2011,We went here last night for a birthday celebration. We ate in the bar area and it was pretty comfortable. The food was better than average and the portions were quite sizable. The value for the three people was expensive but like I said it was a celebration and we wanted to try something new.  The best part was really the cheesecake.
Carmen M.,"Newark, NJ",18,5,,2.0,8/5/2012,"We usually have brunch here before watching a movie. The place is ok I like the one in willow brook mall better. The server takes a long time to get ur order, they take a long time to refill water, there are always flies flying around. I always order the energy breakfast which is my favorite and also has less calories, only 320, not bad."
Damian C.,"New Paltz, NY",7,7,,2.0,8/9/2011,Floors are always greasy. Always some problem with order. Usually slow service. Food usually tastes good. Cheesecake is always A+.  This location is the worst I've been to but generally like their food.
moe M.,"Piscataway, NJ",13,43,,4.0,5/18/2011,not bad at all.. but not on the budget side. i have realized a long time ago that chain restaurants are different from branch to branch so my family tried this vs the one at edison. At CF i feel like you always get your bang for the buck because the regular dishes are always enough for two unless you're really hungry. the smaller lunch portions are perfect. the clam chowder was creamy and the dynamite shrimp was nothing short of delicious. but the FARMHOUSE burger took the trophy that night. .smoked pork belly and egg on a medium-well burger. are you salivating yet?
