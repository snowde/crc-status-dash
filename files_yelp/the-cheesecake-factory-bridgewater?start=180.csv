Cindi J.,"Bethlehem, NJ",0,7,7,5.0,3/2/2014,"I took my daughter, who is a total foodie, and her BF, who has a fairly limited diet.  No one was disappointed.  The menu is extensive and takes some time to go over.  The waitress was very helpful with suggestions when asked, which I appreciate.  We started with the nachos which were more than the 3 of us, very hungry, could finish.  The chips tasted homemade and the toppings were perfect in quantity and flavors.  We went on to try the chicken piccata (seemed like homemade angel hair or at least fresh along with), 4 cheese pasta and Caesar salad with individual margharitta  pizza.  We couldn't possibly eat all.  The salad was perfection as far as cold crisp fresh lettuce with just the right dressing & a few yummy croutons.  The chicken was tender and sauce delicious!  The pasta was so tasty but we only found 3 small pieces of chicken in the 'add chicken' option.  As my daughter said '$3 each piece' lol.  We brought home 2 slices of cheese cake but we all know that will be awesome.  The food was worth the trip alone!"
walter s.,"Bridgewater Township, NJ",0,12,,4.0,1/20/2014,"I've been to this location several times previously but yesterday was the first time I ever went for breakfast.  There were only 3-4 tables with customers when we arrived at 10:15am.  My party of 2 were quickly seated and placed our orders shortly afterwards.      After a while, it dawned on me that despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty empty our food was taking a long time to come.  Just as I was thinking that, the manager (Dan) came over and introduced himself.  He then apologized profusely because there was a mix-up in the kitchen and they prepared one of our dishes incorrectly.  He was very, very apologetic.        I appreciated the fact that he was proactive in informing us of the delay.  The couple of minutes extra we had to wait was no big deal.  The fact that management was aware of the situation and addressing is an indication of a well run restaurant.      Two thumbs up for the meals we had.  Both the Monte Cristo and Baja chicken hash were delicious."
Preeth D.,"Flemington, NJ",7,10,,5.0,11/12/2013,"Great food, great service. I asked for the Manager and complemented him. Dan good job!"
Katherine K.,"Somerville, NJ",0,9,,4.0,10/23/2013,"I've attended this restaurant's happy hour twice this month and I would highly recommend. Both times we went around 5:00, ordered some drink and appetizer specials, and then dinner a little later. No 1-2 hour wait, and the service is great!"
Shawn A.,"Manhattan, NY",10,47,,5.0,3/24/2012,"Yeah, its a chain, but probably the best one... This CF is great! I have never been disappointed by the staff and food."
Chong C.,"Martinsville, NJ",23,33,,2.0,9/2/2010,"they only recently opened this branch in bridgewater, and i hope they can get over the hiccups soon. we were seated very quickly, which was good.  however, once seated, it took a while for our server to come and take our order.  once he did, it was a while before we got our drinks. we ordered the buffalo blasts for our appetizer - it sat waiting on the table while we waited for some plates and new knives, after our server took our old plates and knives away.  once i got my plate, i found food stuck all over it - and that led to me waiting, waiting - until our neighbor seated next to us told her server that i may need a new plate!  still no knives. we were just starting our appetizer when our entrees came out - not the best timing.  i ordered the fish tacos, and they were good.  but the rice and beans were too salty for me to eat - and i love salt. after keeping us waiting for all other courses, our server came by to clean our table and give us our check with lightning speed - typical.  all in all, not horrible, but definitely no more than 2 stars."
Gregg N.,"Plainfield, NJ",10,19,,4.0,1/24/2011,"So I've eaten at different Cheesecake Factories all over, but had a good experience at this one.  It's pretty new, but it is equally tacky inside as others I have visited.  I had never tried the small plates before, but we had Stuffed Mushrooms, Mini Crabcakes, a fairly standard salad and a pretty amazing pizzette which had blue cheese, pears, pecans and arugala.  I was very impressed with all of it.  As usual, original cheesecake (with Strawberries!) was very good."
Light W.,"Randolph, NJ",0,14,,4.0,5/31/2013,Had a dinner last Saturday. Ordered kale salad and jambalaya and loved both of them. Execution varies in this chain. Will go back for sure.
Andy H.,"Bridgewater Township, NJ",0,14,,5.0,7/23/2011,"No food could possibly be better. The entrees are expensive, but it's a great place for a small celebration. I recommend looking at the ""Tappas"" section of the menu (smaller portioned appetizers). The wait sometimes is a pain, but at least you have the mall right there and can browse for a bit. Everyone working there is friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is very relaxed with it's muted lights and colours. Although there are some seats that are close to each other. If you are concerned about proximity ask for a booth. But whatever you do, don't leave without trying one of their many different cheesecake flavors! You will not be disappointed!"
Ma T.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,27,,3.0,10/12/2010,Food is ok but the drinks were TERRIBLE!  I highly doubt the bartender has a license or any knowledge whatsoever about how to make the most basic drink. Stick to bottled beer. And the experience would have been better if the off work waiters didn't hang out in the aisle next to our table screaming and cursing in a joking manner for a half hour while we were trying to enjoy our meal. Seems like the place needs better management.
Carl F.,"New York, NY",6,86,1,4.0,10/14/2010,"I always pass on this chain when I'm traveling because of the long lines, so it's been at least 15 years since my last visit to the original in LA. This new location in NJ just opened a few months ago and I went midweek after shopping at the mall. Service from the greeting to the byes was excellent. The very friendly and attentive waitress said weekends are very busy but weekdays offer little or no wait.The menu choices were great and I settled on a $9.99 lunch special that included delicious slightly spicy mexican chicken and rice soup, large salad, and half turkey sandwich on whole grain baguette. Everything was delicious, especially the soup which changes everyday. Also noted that the turkey was fresh turkey breast meat, not processed. Very full and satisfied, I couldn't leave without checking out the bakery and I will have definitely have to come back as I work my way through every dessert choice. They looked so incredible that I might even be willing to wait in line if the urge comes over me on a weekend."
