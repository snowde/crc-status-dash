Arianne D.,"Miami, FL",0,2,1,1.0,7/29/2017,"I was very disappointed with my experience. Firstly, I have dined at several Cheesecake Factories throughout the country and i am aware they are usually full and you have to wait until a table is available. Therefore I think more seating should be available. Secondly, the waiting staff seemed very frazzled and rushed, they need to be more organized so as not to project their anxiety onto patronizers. Lastly, I ordered 3 types of cheesecake all of which were unsatisfactory. The quality of cheesecakes the Cheesecake Factory now produced tastes artificial and unappetizing. Has the recipe changed?"
Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,656,3336,4.0,1/28/2015,"Finding something to eat around 10 PM in the Bridgewater/Somerville can be very difficult, especially if you what something decent. No McDonalds, Burger King greasy food. Well good thing The Cheesecake Factory is open until 12:30 PM.  There was a 50 minute waiting for a table, but it didn't take that long. It was only about 20-25 minute wait.  I liked where we were seated. Table of 3, we got seated where a table of 6-8 people would be seated in.  We ordered the Factory Nachos (Crisp Tortilla Chips Covered with Melted Cheeses, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Jalapeños and Salsa.) It's probably the best kind of Nachos I have had. To me it is all about the chips. The chips is different from any typical nachos. To me it is a lot more tastier. Works very well with the condiments.  Next came the Stuffed Mushrooms (Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce.) I love mushrooms. Good flavor. Cheesy and the sauce was excellent.  My entree was the Mushroom Burger (Lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, Covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese.) Definitely tons of mushroom. My burger was cooked nice and pink. A juicy and flavorful burger. Almost a bit messy.  My dessert was the Original Cheesecake. Mmmm... Love the cheesecake. Smooth, rich, creamy and light. Must save room for a cheesecake.  Our waiter Carlos M. was an excellent waiter. He was very accommodating, quick with service, conversational, friendly, and nice.  My friends and I kept talking about how the service was just spot on.  Fattening meal...yes it was. But you got to live a little..right."
Helen L.,"NJ, NJ",2,130,,5.0,2/18/2017,"We had a gift card and decided to use it for lunch.   Our favorite has always been the Chicken and Shrimp Bang Bang.  I actually prefer their version over the local Thai restaurant.  Then I became vegan.......  However upon looking at their menu prior to going there, I was surprised they actually have Vegan Cobb Salad.  I hate that my options are usually just salads but this salad was amazing!!  Now if they would only make a vegan cheesecake!"
Steve M.,"Lambertville, NJ",21,41,235,3.0,1/9/2016,I am here with my daughter getting some lunch  I ordered the ribeye grass feed medium rare! We were sat right away at lunch time! The ribeye was very grizzly I would not recommend this steak here to anyone since the manager said it is always this way here 1/3 of the steak was grizzle!
Kimberly R.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",2,56,48,4.0,12/23/2016,"So we went for a late lunch around 2:30. Shouldn't be crowded but on a Sat at the mall, it was busy. We're seated within 3 minutes of checking in. Great! Table contained remnants of the last diner's meal. Not so great. Asked the waiter to get someone to clean it up. He came back to take drink orders but didn't acknowledge the dirty table. When he brought the drinks we asked again. His answer was to grab my napkin and brush off the lettuce, crumbs etc off the table. Directly INTO MY LAP! Really? Not off to a good start. So we place an order for a few apps and a pizza. Pizza comes out. Really tasty. Hubby needs an iced tea refill. No one notices. First app comes out. Still no refill. Hubby asks a server passing by to refill for him which happens right away. Second app comes out. No one has bothered to check on us yet. Third app comes out. Need another refill but the server is STILL IGNORING US. He kept walking right by to help other people but NEVER BOTHERED to check on us or refill hubby's drink. NOT GOOD. HUBBY is MAAAAD. So we call over the manager who of course apologized. Profusely. Repeatedly. Such a nice man named Dan. Made things SO RIGHT and with such hospitality that I am giving them 4 stars instead of my original thought of 1. And I'll give them another chance and return another day.  All because of Dan's ability to turn the situation around."
Roger Z.,"Somerville, NJ",28,7,5,5.0,11/5/2016,"Amazing food and great service. There is a large variety on what to get as a meal, from fish tacos, chicken sandwiches to pastas and salads. The food has a great flavor. The service is ok, the only good thing is that they are not on top of you all the time. The dessert is good, obviously because the place is called cheese cake factory , but they have other things too."
Mon T.,"New Brunswick, NJ",81,104,78,4.0,8/11/2016,How can Cheesecake Factory have 3 stars on here?! It's the Cheesecake Factory!! Menu is too long but they do everything well. The cheesecake is always on point. Wait staff is decent. The only down side is the wait and crowds. Get past that and this place is deserving of 4 stars. Get the Thai lettuce wraps!!!!
S B.,"Somerville, NJ",50,56,26,4.0,9/21/2016,"Haven't been here in awhile, the menu has expanded!  Looking forward to trying their new cheesecake favors."
Maggie D.,"Glen Gardner, NJ",21,8,1,4.0,10/29/2017,"fantastic experience! friendly waiter, speedy service, and a delectable meal! always satisfied when i return to the bridgewater location, no matter how busy. would recommend for sure!"
Kerry A.,"Brooklyn, NY",274,19,93,5.0,8/31/2016,"My fav restaurant is definitely Cheesecake Factory. Menu consist of different cuisine from American, Vietnamese, and old southern comfort food. Something for everyone!!! There cheesecakes are to die for... Every bites so delicious!!! Luv coming here during happy hour and weekends with my family!!!"
Jacquelyn H.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,9,1,5.0,3/20/2017,"Don't listen to the bad reviews... Been here over a dozen times and it's always great. Food, service, drinks... Always perfect. On our most recent visit this past week our waiter, Max, was exceptional. I've never had such an amazing server in my life. Give that man a raise!!"
Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",151,217,981,4.0,8/13/2015,"I've always enjoyed the food at Cheesecake. I don't stray too far away from my favorite items, but every once and awhile I'll try something new. Quite rare though. I had the passion fruit margarita last night which was tasty! While waiting on a to-go order, I asked for the firecracker salmon rolls to be brought out. Oh those firecracker rolls are just the perfect appetizer to lift my mood. I also tried my friend's kale and quinoa salad which was pretty good. It came in a huge bowl. I didn't order any cheesecake; although the fresh banana cream cheesecake is another favorite. With new restaurants popping up all around, The Cheesecake Factory is still worth a visit every so often."
Kasia R.,"Bernards, NJ",34,4,,1.0,8/3/2017,"Whenever I come to the bridgewater Cheesecake Factory I have to wait... wait to be seated, wait for drinks, and wait to be served a meal. I waited so long ( 45 minutes) I asked to have my meal packaged up so that I can go home and put my kid to bed..... no worth it. Next time I'll go to Somerville."
Christopher R.,"Carteret, NJ",1,22,7,5.0,7/24/2016,We tried brunch for the first time here today. We came in at 1:30pm. The friendly hosts greeted and seated us promptly. Our server Miguel was cordial. We didn't have to wait long for the drinks or the food. Our dishes came out nice and hot but the kitchen forgot to put hollandaise on a dish. It was brought out immediately upon request. The outdoor area looks relaxing. We will have to come back and try that next time.
Todd K.,"Arlington, VA",18,1,,1.0,4/9/2017,"With a Toddler, on a weeknight, we waited 90 minutes for our food. And we didn't even get an apology from the waiter or management. It was the single worst restaurant experience I ever had. I'd be more inclined to donate money to see this branch close than go back."
Charles V.,"Raritan, NJ",36,41,,5.0,1/4/2017,"They're very good, the only problem is that they're often crowded on the weekend so that there's a wait.  Their food is good though, and the service is outstanding."
Reese T.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",5,48,1,3.0,11/5/2016,"If you have allergies PLEASE be careful eating here!  This is absolutely terrifying. I don't know if this is specific to this branch but this is the SECOND time I have found a menu error in regards to a nut ingredient at this place. As someone with nut allergies I'll reiterate that is extremely scary and as a chain restaurant I don't understand how they leave themselves so liable for a lawsuit. I don't know if it's the chef's not following the menu or if it's a chain-wide error.  Recently went here with my bf after having a sadly disappointing dinner at Shake Shack for some post-dinner drinks and dessert. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and decided to split a slice of the blackout cake a la mode. The menu states that this finished with almonds. Our cake definitely came with walnuts. Not okay. The slice was huge we couldn't finish it between the two of us and our drinks were good but that nut thing is crazy. Once is barely forgiveable, twice is...I have no words."
Jackie G.,"Bridgewater, NJ",199,5,,1.0,2/6/2016,"A terrible experience at Bridgewater location. We love the Cheesecake Factory, but can't seem to get a get a decent meal at this location. We waited about 45 minutes for our grilled chicken sandwiches to come out (which came out wrong). Manager tried to resolve the problem. They brought one our dishes out after about another 30 minutes, while the other dish came out 20 minutes later. The manager then avoided us all night after we were informed he wanted to speak with us. We also noticed that all the tables around us either had orders that came out wrong as well or had to wait a ridiculously long time for their food. This was All around 430 pm.  We will never be returning and would recommend if you want to go to cheesecake, go to a different location."
Sarah K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",61,5,,5.0,6/22/2017,"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants, especially the one at this location. The service is always amazing, and the food always tasted great. The only issue is that every time I've came here I've had to wait, but everything else about the restaurant overpowers that."
Bob P.,"Toms River, NJ",8,38,11,5.0,1/10/2017,The name says it all cheese cake factory has all the best cheese cakes so many to choose from always fresh and clean
