Harry S.,"Dover, NJ",5,10,1,4.0,12/28/2016,Great food. I come here for special occasions as it's a bit waistband expanding.
Chris L.,"Morristown, NJ",540,858,4658,3.0,11/29/2013,"The workers in this factory all wear white .. when we visited on black Friday evening it was like a Henry Ford assembly line humming at top speed and efficiency, no sarcasm they were cranking!  I think every table was full and yet our waiter was still friendly and helpful, and the kitchen made our food perfectly and quickly. You can only admire a machine that rakes in cash this smoothly because it ain't cheap to eat here. The (free!) bread basket that comes first has both white and dark baguettes, one loaf sorta had failed to rise (oops) but the next was perfect, served warm with butter, pretty hard to resist.  And the soda and water glasses here are easily 24 ounces, overwhelming! The menu is similarly overwhelming, it's a book that goes on for 20 some pages, but about half those pages are advertisements, super annoying.  A small house salad arrived perfectly tossed with bleu cheese dressing, it was generous with the fancy greens and actually had reasonably ripe tomato, lucky for November, yummy, not ridiculous at $4.50. Four-cheese pasta was small tubes of pasta in a mild tomato sauce and generously cheesed with mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and one more.  Totally kid friendly of course but I wouldn't call it bland, it was quite good just in a mild flavored kind of way.  But not cheap at $14.50. Big thumbs up for the Jamaican pepper shrimp entree, this was about a dozen small shrimp in a deeply spiced dark sauce obviously made with fresh peppers, plus a pile of mildly spicy black beans, brown rice, mango salsa and fried plantains.  I flat out never expected something so delicious from a chain that calls itself a factory LOL but it was a solid medium on my spice scale, very well done and enough food to share among two.  Pricey at $18 but it made the meal for me. A notable downside is that the Cheesecake Factory takes no reservations, they won't even put your name on a call-ahead list.  You hope, but mostly you wait. There's a big bar that doesn't seem to fill up, I guess because kids can't sit at the bar haha, but you might keep it in mind if you need to get away from the xma$ music in Bridgewater mall. Special offer Nov 2013 - buy a $25 gift card now, and get a free slice of cheesecake in January 2014.  Yeah I know, delayed gratification is tough :)"
Joanne K.,"Woodside, NY",324,434,862,4.0,4/9/2015,I always have a great time at this cheesecake factory location. The food is always good and so is the service. Overall definitely a great atmosphere and is worth coming to.
Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",465,419,4083,4.0,1/17/2015,"I've been a regular at the Cheesecake  Factory in Boca Raton, Fla. I wanted to try this one in Bridgewater . It was my friends birthday so a group of us decided to meet for an early lunch. I was happy because we were seated in 10 minutes which is a record for this place. No matter which Cheesecake Factory you choose there is always and I mean always a wait. They do not take reservations. Once seated my waitress came right over and took our drink order. I really love their unsweetened passion fruit ice tea. It reminds me of being in the tropics. I ordered the fish tacos which were made with fresh cod. They gave me four nice size tacos and black beans and rice .  I got mine the original way battered and fried . It was very tasty. One of my friends asked our waitress if she could get hers grilled b/c she has a gluten problem.  The Cheesecake Factory was happy to oblige. She too thought her tacos were delicious . One of my friends got the flatbread with pears and blue cheese topped with arugula, pecans, and caramelized onions. She loved it.  For dessert I split the Dutch Apple Carmel Streusel Cheesecake. It was amazing with layers of sliced apples and Carmel btw cheesecake. It was like eating an apple pie and cheesecake and streusel all in one. Of course it came with loads of whipped cream. My friend ordered the gluten free chocolate Godiva flour less cheesecake. It was her birthday so they decorated her plate and spelled out happy birthday. It was a lovely ending to a delicious lunch. I will say the food is very good but this place is very pricey. If u come bring lots of money. That being said I will definitely be returning ."
Debbie K.,"Flemington, NJ",149,177,2587,4.0,4/20/2015,"I am a regular here at this location. I love the food, I think it's always fresh. The service is overall good. I just hate always having to wait for a table when coming here.  I do wanna say that I've been coming here for years and I think there's a new chef for probably the past year now. I feel this way because the food here use to be better. I still think it's good but it was better before. The ahi tartare comes out now with more avocado then tuna, the luau salad comes with different ingredients sometimes, and some dishes are just messy. Again still all good, just not the same."
April L.,"Flemington, NJ",0,25,1,1.0,6/26/2016,I ordered prime rib and asked for a lean piece with little fat as sometimes you can get a piece that is more fat than meat. No problem there. Then when we ordered our dessert they put a piece of the fat from the meat inside the cheesecake. I wish I could say this was a joke. But not. I will never eat here again.
Gabe R.,"Manville, NJ",180,14,,4.0,5/29/2017,"Good food, but kind of expensive. It's not over the top expensive, just be prepared for a little ouch when you get the check. It's worth it though - friendly staff, well-made food, the place is busy for good reason and I'll definitely be back"
Yvonne D.,"Warren, NJ",43,28,22,3.0,9/1/2016,"Went with a friend last night. Shared the zucchini sticks. They were good.  Not as good or plentiful as Maggianos across the parking lot, but good.  Then we ordered the chopped salads with chicken. Citrus Honey dressing on the side (I find their house balsamic wayyy to oniony).  My salad was missing the tomatoes, both of our we're missing the avocado and we had to search for signs of chicken.  We also had to ask for more dressing because they brought out so little.   Service was great.  Once we got the salads together, they were great, albeit hardly any tiny chicken pieces, but a lot of greens.  We ordered dessert to go.  The Cheesecake Factory, how can you not? My friend had the Carrot Cake.  Only ate half.  Didn't think it was good.  I had the Fudgy Chocolate Cake w whipped cream on the side.  Fresh whipped cream was great.  The cake was moist, fresh, delicious.  BUT, a thin piece.  Thinnest slice of cake I've ever gotten anywhere.  I ate the whole thing.  LOL Worst response to a review ever.  Said. NOTHING! Wake up Cheesecake.  How's your stock?"
Steve K.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,4,5,4.0,10/22/2016,The menu is extensive.  The burgers are good and the small plates are quality.  The Buffalo Blasts are my favorite... Having Dogfish Head 60 minute on tap helps to wash down!
Sarah P.,"Monterey Park, CA",180,151,5914,5.0,10/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory makes me happy. I love coming here because it makes me feel like a kid again and I can get anything I desire because they have everything (dessert, salad, steak, finger foods, etc) I want! To start, we ordered the Crab Cake Bites. These are what Mini Crab Cakes are supposed to be like. They are basically a fried lump of crab meat, held together with a filler. Served and paired with Hollandaise Aioli. I like them cause it's better than eating a whole crab. It'll save your fingers and time. Then our Cuban Spring Rolls came to the table. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich rolled up in a crispy tortilla and deep fried for enhanced taste and texture. It's so meaty and so cheeeesy. So good! We also had the tantalizing Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer made from fresh ahi, tuna, avocado, cucumbers and fried wonton chips. So fresh and so good, and it will impress any seafood lover. Our last appetizer was the Corn Dog. They're a-okay. I don't understand why the dudes love this Corn Dog. I wonder what's the obsession about? Please do tell. Our entree was the Meatloaf with gravy. Not fancy, just comforting and fulfilling. Simply delicious! Main course was the Bacon Bacon Burger. Guilty guilty guilty. We ate like kings today. The food were AWESOME! We were debating which cheesecake is the best so we ordered two to try and yes it was difficult to make a choice... We agreed that the Blueberry was the best... sultry sweet and creamy... until the Godiva Cheesecake came along. Can someone tell me who invented that delicious Godiva Cheesecake? I don't know, and I don't care. All I do know is, it tasted so good! I'm addicted, absolutely, definitely and 100% in love with their cheesecakes. I can sit in the restaurant all day and finish the entire pie in a day. Coming here will always be an enjoyable experience for me!"
Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,172,28,4.0,8/11/2016,Super good food here-yes it is a chain but I've been a fan ever since the New Yorker did a story on them. Of course the cheesecake is wonderful! the mango key lime seems to have no lime flavor though it is good-yummy coconut crust. My daughter swears by the oreo cheesecake. I like the variety on the menu though it can be overwhelming. The skinneylicious and the antioxident salads (esp topped with salmon) are my faves and I like that I usually have enough leftover to take home. Only complaint about this locale is that they are a bit slow to bring the food!!
Andre H.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,7,,2.0,5/14/2016,"I been to a bunch of different Cheesecake Factories in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and this one in Bridgewater consistently is horrible. Customer service is terrible and they don't care about their customers at all. Also, the food at this location seems to be so different from all of the other Cheesecake Factories. Save yourself the bad experience and go eat somewhere else."
Dave F.,"Somerville, NJ",0,4,,2.0,10/1/2016,"We visited this establishment this evening in hopes of a nice night out. We knew there would be a wait and we understand that for a Saturday night. We checked in and went to the bar. As I ordered my beer the keg kicked; only getting a half a glass out. No problem. However it took 20 minutes for the keg to be replaced and when it was finally changed, the bar tender continued pouring the beer into my now warm glass with the warm bottom of the keg beer.  We then were told we had to wait another 20 to 30 minutes because the manager opened the outdoor patio. It has been cold, raining and misty all day. As the forecasters predicted, another round of showers came in and all those people had to be placed inside. Why was this patio even open tonight? The forecast haven't changed all week! Rain expected! Still waiting to be seated. Hopefully the meal will make up for it."
Ingrid K.,"Doylestown, PA",13,1,,5.0,4/1/2017,"I was here last night and ordered 16 slices of cheesecake to go using my free slices you get when you buy gift cards on Black Friday. There was a long line at the bakery register. It was the last day before the free slices expired and the bakery was slammed! You would think they would be slightly annoyed or frustrated when I showed them the free slices on my phone ( I hadn't printed them because I thought they could scan them) because even though there's a barcode, they have to be entered manually. Instead, Dominick Rossi, the bakery manager stepped in and took me to a different register to let the line continue. He was gracious, kind, patient and understanding. Instead of feeling like I'd created so much extra work, under pressure, he made me feel like my business was truly appreciated! I left feeling like I had made a friend. I wish every place treated you like that! Not only is the cheesecake the best anywhere, the staff is the best too! Thank you Dominick!!!"
Cheryl W.,"Linden, NJ",64,154,957,4.0,9/17/2015,"I always enjoy the food & service at the Cheesecake Factory. Tonight was just a snack, not a full meal as a means to sit & talk to a friend, but as usual the food was good. For those who have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, there's something on the menu for everyone & although I didn't hVe it tonight, the cheesecake is fantastic !"
Jennifer L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,4,2,3.0,11/21/2016,"This location is my least favorite location because the location is smaller (yes, they are -- because they don't have as much seating as other locations), and the staff seems to be less attentive than other places.  Food is pretty reliable Cheesecake Factory quality, so no complaint from me.  OK for standby if you're looking for good plentyful food, but expect long wait unless you get there early."
Aaron T.,"Easton, PA",359,503,120,3.0,10/9/2014,"I've been here a few times for business lunches. Cheesecake Factory is great for its large menu with broad appeal for whatever a person is in the mood for. In my case, their menu clearly marks items that can be made gluten free by request. This makes the dining experience much easier for me. For lunch, I've had their burgers with the gluten free buns and they weren't bad. For dessert, they have a gluten free cheesecake that is made with Godiva chocolate. With my dietary restrictions dessert opportunities are far and few between, so I typically have one when the option is available ""because I can."" The seating is comfortable, but the service was very slow - especially when I was hoping for a business lunch that was reasonably modest in time. No doubt, Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant with a lot of options, not to forget the cheesecake. I'd never go out of my way to dine at one, but I'd never turn down an offer to go either."
Jessica C.,"Markham, Canada",0,5,,3.0,8/17/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times before, and this time was the worst service I have ever received.  When we (party of 4) arrived on a Wednesday at 6pm, they told us it would be 10-15 minutes for a table and handed us a buzzer. So, we stood outside and waited. A couple of times when we came back inside to ask if our table was almost available or double check if the buzzer would reach to where we were standing outside, we received very rude answers. When our buzzer finally buzzed, we rushed inside and handed the buzzer to the hostess. We stood at the counter for another 10 minutes before we were finally seated by another ice-cold hostess.  When we were finally seated, we received no napkins. We politely pointed this out, and the waitress brought us our napkins. 20 minutes after we had ordered, we were the only table without bread. We asked for bread, upon which time the waitress apologized, and brought us our bread.  Surprisingly, all four of us ordered salads. 2 of us ordered off the Skinnylicious menus, but they were still very large salads. The salads were good, nothing overly exciting.  My colleague did note that his drink (California Whiskey Sour) was really good though."
Rich R.,"Belle Mead, Belle Mead, NJ",0,11,,5.0,1/28/2017,Excellent service and food.  Everything there was wonderful. My family enjoyed it. We will be going more often.  Kid friendly. Our server was so attentive to our children. A ++
Joseph P.,"Morristown, NJ",0,14,,5.0,3/4/2016,"This location does a really good job at living up to the Cheesecake Factory brand image. Always great service and great food. Mike at the bar is a class act! Hard to come by service this good, especially at a chain restaurant. I definitely give them props for this. One of my favorite restaurants in the area. They do it better than any of the other chain restaurants."
