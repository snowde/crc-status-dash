Pete F.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,39,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"Terrible chain restaurant - food is poor (they run out of food often especially during brunch), service is terrible, the restaurant is very loud, long waits - horrible"
Sharon H.,"Sun City West, AZ",2,62,21,3.0,5/20/2016,"Lunch outside is always fantastic this time of year.  Chicken fingers for kids were crispy and hot and grilled cheese sandwich was delicious.  Adults had small plates of lettuce wrapped chicken tacos ( one went Asian with sprouts, peanut sauce and tomatoes and the other Mexican with corn salsa, avocado and cheese) and a chicken Caesar salad.  All were delicious but in general, way to much food was served.  It is a shame to have so much food left.  The grilled cheese sandwiches were actually two each and the Caesar salad although described as small could serve four people.  Service was good but tables way to close together."
Dorette P.,"Tampa, FL",4,36,80,4.0,8/25/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails! Although it's large chain restaurant they do it well. The menu is extensive, if you can't find anything to your liking.....your the problem!  I had the fried catfish tender on the inside and crunchy crust on the outside, served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Our server was Melissa,  she's the best. Attentive without being intrusive.  The drinks are always good and of course so is the cheesecake."
Kimberly H.,"Glassboro, NJ",54,5,,5.0,6/19/2016,"Love this location! I come here quite frequently with my friends and it never disappoints. The wait never bothers us because the buzzers work while you're in the mall, so you're able to do some shopping instead of sitting around doing nothing. They will even wait for you to get back to the restaurant before giving up your table. The wait staff is always friendly and their drinks are delicious. Make sure you save room for dessert as the cheesecake is fantastic."
Bob M.,"Annandale, NJ",0,82,5,1.0,1/1/2016,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  Went here for dinner with friends.  Spent over $200 for microwaved food.  Friends picked up the tab for their first charge in months on her.  credit card.  Needless to say, fraudulent charge alerts started blowing up her phone overnight.  I called the restaurant to complain adjacent the GM Dan took no responsibility for the problem.  In fact, he told me that he took these matters seriously and that his server L. J. WOULD NEVER STEAL credit card info.  He didn't even offer a comp dinner to make it right. People wait for hours just to get a table, so it didn't matter to him that we'll never go back there."
Jen G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,6,,2.0,1/6/2016,"So I just was here tonight with my fiancé, I ordered the vegan salad and she ordered a hamburger. Everything was fine, till I got back home. I had gotten horrible food poisoning from my salad. I don't know why, because it was suposed to be gluten-free, but somehow I got very ill. I am still not feeling well at all from it. Funny thing is that we have been here before and I never really got this ill. I usually would have just gotten a bit of a stomach ache or something small. I order the same thing all the time. Just be careful what you order here, you might get sick like I did."
Adidev J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",8,2,,1.0,12/6/2015,"Never go to this restaurant. I am a vegetarian. Ordered fettuccini Alfredo without meat, they brought it with chicken. Told them to get without chicken - the kitchen staff, removed the chicken from the original and just brought it back. Good thing they were not very good at removing - they left a piece of chicken - hence able to figure out what they did.  The manager only offered to redo the dish."
Rachel B.,"New Brunswick, NJ",42,17,3,1.0,7/10/2016,"Horrible, borderline humiliating experience. They are not very accommodating if you bring a baby, and the hostess was so unhelpful and just giggled when she didn't know a response to a question or request for help. I was meeting a friend and had my toddler with me for lunch. I needed a highchair for him, but they WOULD NOT provide me with one if I wanted to bring the stroller (very compact in a restaurant that was 15% full max) in with me. The stroller has all his mealtime things and is also a place he likes to sit when he gets bored of a highchair after he finishes eating, as all toddlers do after eating quickly. But, even though I tried to explain this nicely, and there was plenty of room, nope!  At one point I said to the hostess, ""I don't know if you have kids or not, but here's why I think this would help...""  She giggled into her hand like a school girl and turned away. WTF?!  We made it through the meal, but I could hardly eat because I had to try to keep a toddler on an adult seat the whole time. And of course he dropped a few pieces of food on the floor, which of course I will pick up in addition to always tipping very generously when I bring the baby in case of any mess I couldn't manage to clean up myself. But I got the cold shoulder treatment. They simply didn't want young children in here. Would have been nice to know in advance. At one point when I was getting the side-eye from one of the staff due to my toddler touching the mirror placed behind his (adult!) seat and getting hand prints on it (highchair would have helped with this, guys!) I muttered to my friend, ""They hate me here, don't they?  I can never come back here.""  He replied, ""Yeah, not sure why, but definitely getting a frigid vibe in relation to your presence, LOL!""  Why did it have to be like this?  Worst and most humiliating lunch ever. Never going back, with or without my child, who, by the way, was very good for a toddler that day!  Unbelievable."
Erin C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2016,"Never have I had such a horrible experience with a take out order. I know that things happen and you really shouldn't judge a restruant based on this but it was plain ridiculous. Called and had them repeat the order 3 times, go there and it was competly wrong. So we waited on them to make the order again and we get it home and it was competly wrong AGAIN. There is no excuse for this and we had to eat what they gave us cause this whole ordeal was 2 hours long and we were not about to go back. I never had a bad experience in the restaurant it's self but this gave me such a sour taste not sure I'll be going back."
Ken K.,"San Jose, CA",0,324,172,2.0,6/5/2015,"Came here on a Friday night around 7.  One hour wait, really busy and even though our buzzer went off for our table, they made us wait another 15 minutes.  I thought they would comp us something but the management was nowhere in sight.  The menu has a big selection of dishes. The food and desserts were decent.   The server was very good."
Pete M.,"New York, NY",200,284,101,3.0,3/19/2015,After a rough start at a large team dinner (40 people) staff pulled off a good experience. Place was its usual hectic pace and then this 40 person dinner so understandable delay. Certain we would have ordered more wine and booze has waiters had time - management should have thought that thru given the reservation made well in advance - but we saved on the expense budget (to Cheesecakes loss).  Food being a chain has limited appeal but all in all ok.
Crimson M.,"Flemington, NJ",18,71,39,4.0,2/9/2015,"I've been here 4 times and ordered the same dessert the first 2 times--pineapple upside down cheesecake. So good! The last 2 times I had their lemon meringue cheesecake---wow! The Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake is amazing, too---my son's gotten it every time.    I've had their Factory Burrito Grande; it was huge and delicious.  It's not on the menu anymore, but their Chicken Katsu was amazing! (Slices of breaded chicken over rice with a miso sauce)  My husband and son loved their spaghetti & meatballs. The Cuban sandwich is great, too.  Saturday night is very, very crowded with a loooong wait time. Mid-afternoon is better."
Grisel A.,"Bound Brook, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2016,"I am so disappointed at the treatment me and my family received by 2 hostesses at this cheese cake factory restaurant. My family and I go there regularly and on June 7,2016 we arrived there a little past 7pm. I asked the hostess (short girl with black hair probably Hispanic), how long for a family of 5, she said about 25 mins. We sat to wait, but time went by and other people coming in after us were being seated. 1 hour passed by and a family of 4 came in and was seated immediately but we were still waiting for over 1 hour. I stood up to ask why we hadn't been seated and a few families similar to ours had been. There was now a 2nd hostess with curly black or brown hair which very rude told me a table for 4 is not the same as a table for 5. I understand that but there was no need for very rude attitude she gave me. When we were finally called to be seated she gave my daughter a kids menu, but being that in the past they'd give crayons and something for the child to color, after being seated I went to ask if there were any crayons. Both girls the short Hispanic one with straight hair and lot of make up and the other thin one with the curly hair they both looked at me with some anger in Their faces and just said ""we no longer give out crayons"". Even my 2 boys asked why did they talk to me with such attitude. After waiting for more than 1 hour to be seated when we finally were seated the table was wet and the check and cash from the previous guests were still on top of the table. I went to let them know that the payment for the previous meal was on our table and the short girl with straight hair again very rudely just said ""the server will take it"". There was no ""Thank you for letting us know"" there was never ""we apologize for the wait"", nothing! After 3 times of getting attitude and unprofessional treatment from the hostesses we just didn't feel welcome and stood up and left to another restaurant that welcomed us and didn't make us wait over an hour. These 2 girls were extremely rude and unprofessional. They must be trained on how to treat guests. It is a shame that a family of 5 that used to eat there regularly will not longer do so because the 2 people that should feel guests welcome have an unacceptable way of treating cheese cake factory's customers. HORRIBLE TREATMENT!"
Asish P.,"Jersey City, NJ",75,435,2075,2.0,1/25/2012,"Large variety of food, place looks great... but everytime we come here, we seem to always have an issue. Went there a couple of times when they first opened... and then stopped....  tried it again recently.. and we are still not impressed.  Food is ok... and the service is borderline."
Jas C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",39,42,1,5.0,5/10/2015,"Predictably great, friendly service, always be prepared to wait awhile at peak hour.  The cheesecakes are always a solid choice for dessert, favorites are the Tuxedo and the seasonal Peppermint flavored ones.  Love their Peach Bellini, and favorites are their generous, healthy, and fresh salads.  Thai appetizer is also very commonly ordered. Can get repetitive as the go-to, but as reliable as it gets especially as a chain restaurant, and priced well."
Jim F.,"Summit, NJ",0,2,,1.0,5/31/2016,"We were there about 2 weeks ago and the reason I didn't post anything sooner was I was hoping to distance myself a little from the experience before posting a review.  We went there for my daughter's birthday, not only did we ask for them to bring out ice cream and sing to her ( none of which happened) it took forever.... While she was in the bathroom the baby changing table fell on her head in the stall.  The place is a total nightmare.  We couldn't even get the check to pay and get out of there.  Going up to the host in the front we were finally able to get the check and pay.  We won't be going back to another one anywhere."
Lola T.,"Somerville, MA",0,100,1,3.0,1/10/2016,"The food is good and just what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory (fair price, decent food).  However The dessert staff behind the glass showcase on are rude and uncaring. You'll wait in line almost an hour to get served and then they take 13 minutes to get the cheesecake you asked for in a box. Ruins my experience.  Speed it up a little-- jeez Also, the cheesecake has gotten so small and is still expensive. Don't with dessert here."
Louise S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,3,1.0,6/2/2016,"Very disappointed. I called to try to make a reservation last night for my sisters birthday but was told that I need to call back the next day at 11am. I set the alarm on my phone to remind myself and called at 11am sharp, but was told that they don't accept reservations on Saturdays. But instead of apologizing for the miscommunication by the lady last night and making an exception for us this time, the manager said that I heard wrong and that its my fault for not understanding her! Really?!"
Ken K.,"White House Station, NJ",3,21,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Sunday Brunch - I'll start off by saying the food was good, no complaints there.  Service on the other hand, was so slow I thought everyone was on break!  Arrived @ 10:15am, they open @ 10:00am, wasn't to crowded yet.  The server took our full order immediately, and then vanished!   10:25am, one tomato juice arrived, the runner asked if we were waiting on anything else, (coffee, OJ, and 2 waters)  our server cruised by and said the coffee is brewing!!!  Brewing??? It's 10:25am, they should never be waiting on coffee to brew, especially on Sunday brunch!!!  10:30 ish coffee, OJ and the waters appeared.  And then, what I think was the manager finally showed up, and asked if everything was okay.  Well... I told her it was extremely slow... And I wanted to say more, but I had a lot of children in the area.  10:45am food arrived, omelette, crab hash with poached eggs took 30 min to complete (Gordon would not be happy with this level of service).  11:00am check came, and I gave her my Visa card at the same time she gave us the check.  I should've opened and checked first, but I didn't want to be there any longer.  Bottom line; $58.72 for breakfast for 2, decent food, with slow motion service.  And, it was breakfast folks, not a brunch, but breakfast... a true brunch, you wouldn't be ordering ala-carte off their menu.  So, if you are looking for a true brunch, with good service, great food, in a timely manner, the Cheesecake Factory @ the Bridgewater commons is NOT the place to go folks!"
Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,622,713,4.0,10/20/2013,"We've been to many Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. As far as Cheesecake Factories go, this was pretty typical. I would rate for food and originality a  three. But, our server was really wonderful, so I rated 4 stars. This was a reunion with an old friend and we had a great time. The turn over here is very high - this is part of the Bridgewater Mall. But, no one gave us a hard time or rushed us in any way. The food was good - way too much to actually have Cheesecake. The cake displays when you first come into the place looked magnificent. It was a shame no one left room."
