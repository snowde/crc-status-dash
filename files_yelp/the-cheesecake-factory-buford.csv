Hope T.,"Atlanta, GA",357,76,23,5.0,11/23/2017,"Really enjoyed eating at the Cheesecake at the Mall of Georgia. I like the atmosphere waaaaaaay better than the one in Lenox but of course I'm not driving out to Buford just for some fried cheese.  Anyways, I ended up getting the truffle Honey chicken. Huge pieces of fried chicken breasts. Like huge. Like crazy big pieces. If they would have given me one piece I would have been satisfied. But they gave me two! I was like okay Cheesecake Factory! Y'all better show out!!!  I couldn't even finish all of my food. Our appetizers were the buffalo blasts and everyone knows those things are so big they could be a meal on their own. I took home 3 To-go boxes because I definitely got cheesecake too. Banana Cream for the win!"
Aiman S.,"Duluth, GA",126,56,57,4.0,10/8/2017,"I've been to this cheesecake chain a number of times, and it's been pretty average, but this time 'round quite delightful! My mom and I stopped by for a spontaneous late lunch at around 3:15 PM  at this Cheesecake. It was still their lunch special hours until 5 (score)! The reason this time around I really enjoyed cheesecake, was because I really felt we got the bang for our buck. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad- delicious, tangy, sweet, with crispy onions- don't let the title of salad fool you into thinking it's healthy). My mom ordered the spicy Lousiana chicken pasta- farfalle sitting in spicy, tomato/hot sauce cheesy sauces topped with crispy chicken. The salad had good flavors, and the beans and corn tasted fresh; however, the salad leaves seemed to be wilting. The Lousiana pasta was also satisfying and savory! After eating 2/3 of our meal (Cheesecake's lunch portions are still the size of Alaska), we were STUFFED to stay the least. But...there's always room for dessert! We topped off the lunch with a banana cream cheesecake slice to share. It was decadent, but a bit too sweet the moment of.  The two lunch dishes and a dessert cost us $36 with tip, which I find to be more than decent for such big portions. I would say come to Cheesecake during lunch-  their dinner prices are hefty and not really worth it for the creativity and quality of the food. Service was also pretty good this time around, just slow at times."
Cristina M.,"Jefferson, GA",80,61,29,5.0,9/12/2017,"Our server was Chantel (I believe that is her name) and she was awesome! We had a party of 10 with 2 little ones and she accommodated everyone! We were there to celebrate a birthday and she was very helpful in the last minute prep work. She ensured food was ordered quickly, waters were filled and drinks were ordered and received quickly. We did have a delay on 1 drink but she got it fixed fast. We had a spill and a bus boy came quickly to clean it up. She even made sure my babies were taken care of.  All the food was really good and everyone ordered something totally different. Portions here are huge and the menu is even bigger. Come with an appetite! Most ordered dessert and we had a birthday dessert with candles and song as well! I never usually have an issue here - food was fresh, service was fast and everyone was happy."
Andrea B.,"Alpharetta, GA",177,47,46,4.0,10/5/2017,"This location at mall of ga is usually pretty good. I don't give them 5 stars because a couple times the food took too long, but still tasted great. They tend to be on a long wait friday and saturday nights between 6:30-8:00 pm since mall of ga is packed then anyway, so be prepared to wait around those times.  My favorite cheesecake there is the nutella hazelnut cheesecake! It has crunchy hazelnuts, graham cracker bottom, chocolate and cream on inside, and nutella on top, perfection!"
Ben L.,"Duluth, GA",1,30,12,5.0,1/7/2018,"The food is consistently good and so is the service. There is always a wait, but that's understandable considering the location. I'm really not sure what all the negative reviews are about. That has not been experience in the many times I've visited."
Gabrielle S.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,39,17,5.0,12/20/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory.First time actually dining in at the restaurant and had a great experiment.
Kia S.,"Conyers, GA",0,9,36,3.0,8/18/2017,"I have not been here in a while and I'm glad i tried it again. The food was ok. For starters my mom had a steak dinner she enjoyed the food but their quantity was small. All of the others was good, the problem with the food was that it wasn't hot and it was just barely warm. Also on the dish i had a lot of noodles that were uncooked i also asked no mushroom but i still had some in my plate. What if i was allergic to them.   Next time i will try another that gotta better reviews"
Jon P.,"Buford, GA",92,129,200,4.0,5/14/2017,"A Mother's Day dinner that went very smooth and it was delicious. The cheesecake factory is the only place that I can think of where you can get southern comfort food, Asian, and Italian at the same time.  It was busy as it was to be expected. Waited over an hour but best part was just shopping at the mall of GA so no biggy! We were seated outside the patio which was great~ There was a nice breeze so it felt good.  Service was great. I had no issues at all. The server came by to take out order and food came out fairly quickly. Of course we had our bread from the get go so our stomachs would be too mad at us. We had the shrimp scampi and Diane steak, Orange chicken with white rice, and finally my long time simple classic, spaghetti and meatballs. I have to give it hands-down to the spaghetti and meatballs. Tonight it was superb to me. Such a simple classic dish that turn the night incredible bringing back so many memories. The orange chicken was great too! The snow peas were so crunchy and tasty! I thought the shrimp and steak was just okay. Nothing to brag but will want to try something different next time.  By the end of the meal we were so for that we couldn't get dessert but we had to get red velvet cheesecake TO GO GO~ lol Thank you cheesecake factory for making our night full of flavor and fun! I'm sorry that the moms had to work tonight so happy Mother's Day and hope to see you guys soon!"
Sam K.,"Duluth, GA",159,19,42,4.0,9/16/2017,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I've been to in Georgia, but they get the chicken Madeira right every single time! I also love getting the chipotle pasta and the Santa Fe salad. They cover an array of foods from Asian, Italian, Mexican, and so forth. I have to admit this place is pricey, and the wait times can be ridiculous, but it's a solid place and I can't lie, the food is good. Of course I don't come here often, but when I want to treat myself or some friends, I know this is a go to place. Professional, Clean, Modernistic, and Delicious. I know this is a chain, but The Mall of Georgia's location has been a blessing to me, and I have no complaints about it. Will be coming back soon~"
Wen L.,"Atlanta, GA",64,188,141,5.0,4/25/2017,"I recently dined here for a family dinner to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday.  It was a surprisingly great dinner experience. I usually do not go to chain restaurant for special dinners, but this one was just in a good location and we were all wanting a place that offered Italian food.  We had 6 adults and a toddler. The ambience is as usual for Cheesecake Factory with medium noise level and all types of attire is acceptable for this place. All of this works perfectly when you have a toddler who like to screech randomly. It just all drowned out in the restaurant noise, so I didn't feel bad or embarrased.  Around 5pm, there was a 30 minute dinner wait, but were seated right when it was 30 minutes. Our food came out quickly and was all correct. My son devoured the brown bread and my carbonara pasta, so I was happy (if a picky toddler will eat it then it must be good!). My husband had a carnesada dish and it was so delicious! The corn that came with it was something special and my son ate so much of it that I was shocked. Everyone was really happy with their food and portions. We all had a bunch of food to take home too.  I am definitely going back to this location. Seems like they really have it together there.  And I just have to add that the cheesecakes were SO delicious! But cheesecake is also my most favorite food in the world!"
Jessica C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2017,"We waited 40 mins.. It is finally our turn. The tall guy worked at front desk told us wait for call my name after we returned back the small machine to him. We follow his order stood before him. We saw next 5 customers already went to inside, no one call my name. After 10mins ,we asked how long still need wait. Then the tall guy told me when he call me , no body answer. We stared at them for 10 mins since he told us stand over there. They did not call my name at all. We were angry because he lied. Not missed our turn.  He looks like right. Do not wanna come back again."
Nikki N.,"Atlanta, GA",12,45,25,4.0,8/31/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory offers sizable portions from a vast menu including signature cheesecakes. Always packed but plenty of seats and the service is good. This time I ordered the Grilled Chicked Tostada Salad $15.50 (takes 2/3 people to finish it) which comes with: Crisp Corn Tortillas Topped with Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast and Black Beans Piled High with Mixed Greens, Fresh Corn, Green Onions and Cilantro. All Tossed in their Vinaigrette and Garnished with Avocado Cream, Salsa and Sour Cream. Overall, huge portion which is worth the price your paying and you can't forget about the cheesecake."
Julia S.,"Suwanee, GA",0,3,2,2.0,12/1/2017,"This place serves really good pasta but I took 3 stars off because one time my pasta had burnt onions and chickens. I separated the burnt ones into another plate and showed them to the waitress, but she simply took it away and came back saying ""we appreciate for the feedback"". I asked her if that was it and she said they can't do anything about it. No refund or remake of the badly burnt meat and vegetables. I shouldn't have let her taken the burnt pieces that were piled up on the plate away, but I trusted the waitress so it's my own fault."
Michele W.,"Murphy, NC",0,7,9,3.0,12/1/2017,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory at the Mall of Georgia many many times since they opened at that location. Normally we leave very satisfied and extremely pleased with our meals. However, today we left a little disappointed. We were there mid afternoon, so they weren't very busy at all. It was difficult to get refills on our water. Our appetizers came out quick and were delicious. I ordered the Factory Nachos with chicken as my meal. I have had these nachos several times and have always thoroughly enjoyed them. Today they were terrible. I sent them back after eating a few. The cheese was gross, very chunky, just not normal. I got everyone at the table to try them because I thought it may have been just me. Our food took a while to get. I'm sure that we will come back to eat here just not the normal experience!"
Erica G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",47,86,187,3.0,5/9/2017,"I was not impressed by the food at this place, but the cheesecakes are absolutely phenomenal. So many flavors & varieties it's very difficult to choose! I would go again just for the cheesecake. The type of service you receive depends on the server."
Waylon H.,"Woodruff, SC",0,13,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Had to wait over an hour for a table of eight.   After a bit of time and seeing a bunch of people leave, we checked for an update from the host.  Asked how much longer.  Their response ""I told you an hour when you got here, its been 30 mintues, so 30 minutes.""  Just a rude person..  didn't matter how the food was after that.. doubt the manager will even care."
Jay A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",144,37,6,2.0,6/19/2017,"First, I want to say the food is amazing and this review is not about the quality of the foot because if it was I'd be giving 5 stars.  That being said, the service needs a lot of help.. the new people that I see here occasionally give better customer service than the waiters that been working for longer...  they act like they are not happy working and when you ask them for something it always makes us feel like it's a burden or a problem... not the way I want to feel when I'm eating out."
Jonathan C.,"Buford, GA",59,76,154,4.0,3/12/2017,"This place is hit and miss depending on what you order.  For example the majority of their ""Mexican"" style dishes are horrible lol.  I've branched out trying different things but my absolute favorite here is the simple Spaghetti and Meatballs...so flavorful.  Frankly this place makes it better than the majority of Italian restaurants in the area.  The mac and cheese burger is also very good, I've tried that in the past as well.  Service for us has always been really good, no complaints on that front.  Place is always packed so expect to wait cause they don't take reservations."
Alin R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",199,71,71,2.0,5/22/2017,"I always love coming to Cheesecake Factory because of their large selection of food and of course, their cheesecakes however service here isn't the greatest, especially this most recent visit I had Sunday night. My boyfriend and I arrived around 9PM on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately and greeted shortly after. Timing of our appetizers was perfect but the entrees and presence of our server was awful after that. We waited about 15-20 minutes after we were done picking at our appetizers for our entrees to arrive. After that, our server did check on us once about 2 minutes after we got our entree before disappearing. We had to flag down another server for some togo boxes and our check because we were starting to get rather impatient.  Another thing that was bothersome was that our server couldn't keep his eye-to-eye contact because his eyes obviously looked down at my boobs...EVERY SINGLE TIME he said anything to us.  P.S. I do not recommend the Korean Cauliflower (appetizer). It's over-breaded cauliflower covered with sauce that tasted basically like orange sesame chicken you would get at a Chinese restaurant at the mall. Ours was also fried too much. I could only eat it by taking all the breaking off."
Thomas A.,"Suwanee, GA",0,70,7,5.0,5/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well known restaurant with great food and great service. In addition, the menu is very extensive with a lot of dishes to choose from and at one time I use to think too many items too choose from which could be overwhelming. However, I have found that the meals on the menu are all made to perfection that keep their customers happy and coming back for more."
Ashleigh W.,"Norcross, GA",115,120,537,4.0,4/27/2016,"I'm not sure why The Cheesecake Factory gets so much hate. It's a decent restaurant that serves pretty much anything anyone would want to eat. Want tacos? They got it. Want a plate of fruit? Look no further. Interested in an elaborate salmon dish? Bet. Sure, TCF is the new Red Lobster or Olive Garden. Ya know, place where people who want to feel like they stepped out went somewhere ""nice"" but it is. The Mall of Georgia location is the same. The decor is very European lite, but you're there for the food. And the cheesecake, right? I don't care about cheesecake though. I digress.  Anywho, the options are endless here, the service is good but because this is the Mall of Georgia, there is a wait at times. Make a reservation for peak times or hang out for 30-45 minutes. Try the miso glazed salmon or the summer spring rolls. Enjoy!"
Lisa M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",3,39,89,2.0,4/11/2017,We came here because we thought we would be able to grab a quick dinner. We've been here several times so we kind of knew what to expect. Service was extremely slow. I'm mean horribly slow. They weren't even that busy. We were extremely disappointed and no one even apologized for the slow service. Don't think we will come back to this location!
Ching H.,"Atlanta, GA",93,235,1248,5.0,2/14/2017,"This is only a review for the cheesecake. They have really delicious variety of cheesecake from original, strawberry, tiramisu, mango key lime, Godiva chocolate, and many more. You can purchase them by slices or as a whole. Smallest whole cake is 7 inch cost around $40. I purchased the strawberry cheesecake. You purchase them frozen. It was beautiful and light. You can request to have the whipped cream and strawberries on the side. It was enough for 12 of us. Whipped cream was light and smooth. Overall, very good quality cheesecake. Service is awesome as well."
Barry H.,"Buford, GA",3,36,114,4.0,3/11/2017,The Korean Fried Cauliflower are soo good I had to give them 4 Stars.. . I hear folks come for the cheese cake if they keep the cauliflower on the menu that'll change. If you close ya eyes you think you were eating chicken. I'd recommend this dish for vegetarians or someone who's just looking for something different.
Ashleigh P.,"Lithonia, GA",19,39,17,5.0,2/1/2017,"I have not frequented this chain a lot just bc other locations  have been extremely crowded... Not this location though! Dined here tonight and there was NO wait to be seated!  Hostess was very nice as well as the waiter. The waiter was just the right amount of everything. He wasn't overbearing, checking on the table every 2min. Yet we never had to flag him down for anything we needed. He was very attentive! I ordered the Orange Chicken w/ rice (which I highly recommend). The food came out approximately 15min. Later and it was damn good!!!  The prices are very reasonable and there are a lot of menu options. If you're near/at the Mall of Georgia, make sure to check this place out."
Billy S.,"Buford, GA",0,13,15,1.0,1/6/2017,"Ordered takeout 25+ minutes ago and the lady who took our order told us 15 minutes. Still waiting, and I had to ask her to check on the order (Nachos and a burger. SMH) *updated* She went to the kitchen (with a slight attitude, like it was an inconvenience to her). Mind you, since it was takeout, I paid (and tipped $9 on a $39 order) when she took our order. Maybe that was the problem - she no longer had an incentive to provide good service. She came back immediately with our food - which means it had probably been ready a good amount of time. Who knows how long it was sitting back there. And, it's not like they were busy at the takeout/dessert counter, either."
Jen L.,"Atlanta, GA",208,326,620,2.0,1/6/2016,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory but this location didn't seem as good as the rest. We waited almost 2 complete hours for a table for party of 2. I understand it was a Saturday night but after seeing empty tables of two, open for 15 minutes at a time then filled, I had to assume the hostess was just going slow. We did get our food within 30 minutes which was impressive but we were there for almost 3 hours. That's just too long.   I ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps which came out in a beautiful presentation but the chicken was cooked so much that it was charred badly. I've ordered this particular plate for years and it's never been charred. I was a bit disappointed with this location."
Oscer M.,"Dacula, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/1/2017,"The atmosphere was great! But the people are very biased and stuck up and only care about the money not the customers or anyone's well-being.  Me and some friends were there and we had ordered all our food. but, we had one emergency and had to cancel an order,unfortunately. they said that would be fine then the manager came and said that it would be OK and everything will sort it out with a smile and a reassuring face. But later on waiter came back and said that they had canceled ALL our orders and told us to "" get up, and leave""."
Fidaa M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",2,40,17,5.0,2/18/2017,Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants. It has been my favorite for years. The customer service and the quality of food is wonderful at this location. One of the things that I like the most about cheese cake factory is that their menu is huge. There's always something for everybody there. The funny part is I usually do not get cheesecake when I go to cheesecake factory. I love the food so much that I don't even think about the cheesecake!
Kay B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,9,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"The night was off to a good start...until the waitress told me ""she forgot"" to put my order in but was sorry. She offered me a salad kindly enough but there was a long, blonde hair entangled in the romaine lettuce. A manager came by but all he had to say was ""sorry, we don't normally have this happen. Can I bring you another one?"" HELL NO! Will it be served with extra hair this time? I'll pass on every offer after today for Cheesecake Factory! My beer was the best part of the ""meal"""
Ramon M.,"Savannah, GA",0,3,,5.0,9/2/2017,"Great atmosphere, and service. Delicious food, which came to our table in a timely manor. Also, their chicken nuggets are unlike any I have ever had, so crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside. They really perfected their chicken nuggets, and I highly recommend them."
Local_Guy ..,"Dacula, GA",1,31,,2.0,9/1/2017,"If your a fan of The Big Bang Theory and think it's going to be like what it is on that show, well..it's a tv show, of course its not like that. I cannot for the life of me understand why so many people come here. The food is ok, but when you have to take out a second mortgage to feed a family of four, there are better options. The place is nicely decorated, but the wait to get in can rival the wait for Pirates of the Carribean at Disney World, and at least at the end of that you get a ride. You can choose to dine outside on the ""patio"" if you enjoy Mall of Ga patrons walking by to look over the wall at what you are eating. The cheesecake is very good, I will give them that, but hey, they are named cheesecake factory for a reason right. For the price through and the quality of the food, I just cannot recommend this place."
Alex B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",53,18,22,1.0,7/22/2017,"This place sucks. Everytime I come back I always ask myself why I do. The service here sucks. The waiter got the food wrong for one of the people we were eating with and when we asked them to correct it, they wouldn't even let us get a word in. I really wish I could give this place no stars but sadly I can't. Not to mention that the reason this place even deserves a star is for their mac and cheese balls, but that's about it. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you want overpriced cheescake and crap food."
Belinda G.,"Gainesville, GA",0,26,37,1.0,8/23/2017,"Went for lunch today. The hostess was very unfriendly. Not very busy, we were seated immediately but still waited a long time for our food. After eating, we sat and waited and waited and waited and had to hunt down our server for our check. Afterwards,  we went to the cheesecake counter before we left. Two employees finally show up there and they didn't even acknowledge us standing there. One proceeded to assemble a cake box while the other just stands doing nothing. We decided it wasn't worth the wait anymore and left. We won't be back. Service is horrible. To end on a positive note, the lunch portions are big."
Carmen L.,"Buford, GA",171,118,720,4.0,3/21/2017,"The ambience was great and on top of it we had an awesome server which made the whole experience even better. We order the chicken tortilla soup, kids alfredo pasta, Shepherd pie, and herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The food was excellent and for lunch portion I had leftovers as well. The complimentary bread was a great starter. I will be back here soon."
Alex S.,"Alpharetta, GA",68,88,79,3.0,6/22/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is a hit or miss?? Sometimes the food is really good and on other occasions, the food comes out cold and the staff is clueless. Sometimes the tables we sit at is clean and the next time we go they are filthy and we need to ask to be reseated ?? I personally like the Alpharetta location but this one is close to my home.Overall the food quality is top notch for the most part."
Briana E.,"Suwanee, GA",100,4,,1.0,6/15/2017,"First of all we went on a Wednesday evening and they were far from busy, had plenty of staff standing around doing nothing and plenty of open tables, yet several small groups of people waiting to be seated us included.  Our server was far from enthusiastic and pretty slow. After taking our drink and appetizer order we waited about 15 mins for him to come back to take our order. Throughout the evening he walked by several times empty handed and didn't even glance to see if we needed refills or anything (we did). All of that aside, I got a blood orange martini which was pretty good, just a bit too sweet for my liking. I got the spicy chipotle chicken pasta dish, chicken was chewy and some pieces were tough but the actual pasta was delicious. My hubby got the ""Famous"" Meatloaf which he said wasn't good at all (I have never heard him complain about food, that man will eat anything), but he still ate a little less than half. BIG mistake, he woke up in the middle of the night and was in the bathroom until the next afternoon. I called the Manager to warn of his sickness and let him know they needed to get rid of any Meatloaf they had left from the night before (they don't prepare these meals fresh or individually obviously). His response, ""well we haven't gotten that many calls on this particular dish"" uhmmmm, one call stating someone is sick from your food should be enough to act, and more than one call should be reason for GREAT concern!! This guy had obviously heard from at least one other sick patron regarding the meatloaf but apparently that wasn't enough for him to care or do anything about it. He offered no resolution or even concern for the situation but simply asked if I wanted him to take down my name and number. For what exactly? A get well soon card?  To summarize- We paid more that $100 for a mediocre meal (that made my hubby sick) and  mediocre service at a very poorly managed restaurant. We will NOT be coming back."
Alesia B.,"Riverview, FL",10,61,172,2.0,6/23/2017,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The Firecracker salmon was dry and missing the spinach. My daughter's soup had a piece of hair in it. It's staffed by kids and young adults. Some of them give decent service. I gave it 2 stars because Management comped our drinks and cheesecake. I won't be back
Sherrain W.,"Tampa, FL",26,6,5,5.0,3/19/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails to impress me! We arrived around 4:30pm on a Sunday and were seated within 5 minutes. Our server, Juanita, was super prompt and attentive. Had Buffalo Blasters (which are to die for!) as an appetizer, and I decided to try the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. The pasta was phenomenal! I think I may have found my new favorite dish!! The portions are always triple the size of what you could normally eat. Of course, no trip to The Cheesecake Factory is complete without a slice of heaven! I went with the classic original, to go! Over all, my experience was amazing! Highly recommended!"
Rana O.,"Buford, GA",15,40,55,1.0,4/9/2017,"I used to be a fan, until I took a bite into the vegetable burger and the uncooked taro almost broke my tooth. Overrated."
