Dr. J.,"Loganville, GA",1,8,,4.0,10/8/2015,"My husband and I visited for afternoon dessert after enjoying lunch and a movie in the area.  We both had the carrot cake cheesecake. The Mr. enjoyed his slice with coffee while I paired mine with a glass of wine.  The first cup of coffee my husband received was warm, not hot. The bar waiter quickly had a fresh pot brewed upon notification. My wine, Moscato of course, was delicious. Service was pretty prompt and the carrot cake cheesecake is always on point...although it seems the slices are getting smaller."
Karyn F.,"Berkeley Lake, GA",73,32,1,1.0,1/5/2017,It was a Wednesday around 730ish . We were told a 20 min wait . We had a party of two with a infant . We waited far past that .. and we watched other parties of two get seated before us .. we didn't get upset at this point because we thought they were being seated in small booths .. as we got called to be seated we walked past those parties and they were seated in a regular booth .. we were seated in a very large booth which would have seated a party of 6 . We were a little upset about this so we called for a manager. The manager came and was rude very unapologetic. She didn't smile or even try to resolve our issue .. sorry would of been a good start ....  our waitress she was wonderful ..!!! She was a saving grace!!! The food was mediocre .. the manager walked past the table a bunch of times never checked back she actually made us feel uncomfortable ...  this is not a kid friendly location and wouldn't bring my child back again .  I did contact the company page in regards to this ..
Venty L.,"Hoschton, GA",0,1,1,1.0,7/26/2016,"I never complain about food but today I have pasta cabonara is really awful I pay 16,90 for lunch is not worthy really disappointed ,drink ok cheese cake good the other thing zero I tell bartender because I sit down in bar ,she look like not care at all not good"
Tracy B.,"Sugar Hill, GA",29,8,,1.0,5/24/2016,"My family and I have  been here a few times for dinner and besides the wait our experience has been fine. We went last weekend for an early dinner, it was Friday at 4:30, so we could get in before the dinner crowd. The wait staff was horrible and rude. The food was awful, in fact my husband's chicken dish was raw chicken when it was brought to him. Won't be going back here for lunch or dinner.  This place is too expensive to have this kind of experience."
Anicia J.,"Suwanee, GA",6,15,12,4.0,1/20/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory was a nice atmosphere as usual. Crowded even though it was after 830, we waited for almost 30 minutes.  Our waiter was attentive and informative. The food was good. We ordered the Cuban egg rolls which were delicious and the spinach dip was ok. For dinner we had pasta which was good and a vegetarian burger which my daughter liked.  We'll definitely be back!"
Brandi H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,1,2.0,7/5/2016,I have had better food at other locations..at this one I never expect to have outstanding service or food.Staff needs better greeting skills and kitchen needs more ....umph... In the food. Hopefully it gets better....
Kelly G.,"Duluth, GA",21,9,2,5.0,6/26/2014,"Delicious!  We visited on a Thursday night - NO WAIT at 6 pm.  Fresh house made veggie burger is worth the price.  Our server at this visit, Matthew, was friendly, knowledgeable and spot on with his timing - everything was brought out quickly and correctly.  We also ordered the fire grilled artichoke app and loved it!  The skinny margarita is yummy too.  We'll definitely be back. A quick public service announcement:  If you have not actually eaten at a restaurant, you should not write a negative review for it on yelp.  It's just not a nice thing to do, and does not reflect a personal experience.  :)"
Selena T.,"Suwanee, GA",0,49,20,1.0,10/4/2015,The foods are tastes good when they are just open. Now the foods are tastes just so so.   It was one of my favorite restaurant to dine in before but now I don't go to go there again!   Don't waste your money to go there!
Davante D.,"Panama City Beach, FL",370,4,1,3.0,6/6/2016,"The food was really amazing, but the service could be a lot better. The waiter leaves for about 45 mins at time, and our tables had 3 forks and 2 knives under the table. The area just wasn't cleaned very well at all before we were sat."
Iesha J.,"Orlando, FL",2,1,,3.0,5/13/2015,"Dear Mall of Ga Cheesecake Factory, it would be great if the curbside 'To Go' number was a dedicated line. Having to sit on hold in the standard que AFTER already placing your order kinda defeats the purpose. Same thing goes for picking up orders: So you're telling me that after I call ahead I have to stand in line with ALL these people wanting only cheesecake?  But I'm looking at my food waiting for me slowly going down the path from crispy to mushy or just plain luke warm or cold! Please do better?!  Also, I've frequented other locations- Alpharetta as well as Chicago- why does my experience suffer in Buford GA? This is the only location I go to where food remains on tables after ppl seem to long gone- they're eager to place a party of two in a cramped space even when the restaurant isn't busy....I can do the small spaces but I will not be put into a small space when you have multiple booths or other options available clearly.   The food has been pretty much consistent although I'm here frequently only getting a salad, I've only had a few times where things were just off.  Please commit to a few changes so I can make a GOOD update after my next few visits....please?"
R Y.,"Buford, GA",4,8,,3.0,7/16/2016,No impressed with the food my girlfriend birthday dinner was ok we have to wait so long for our lunch about 2 hours .
Chris A.,"Atlanta, GA",29,102,101,4.0,8/7/2015,"The best features of this restaurant is their vast menu, full bar with signature drinks, and light atmosphere. We were celebrating a birthday and typical Friday had us waiting for a table at 8pm. The food was fantastic, personally I recommend the Seared tuna tataki salad with a Long Island Ice Tea.  The only reason for the four stars is services was delayed and slower than necessary. I understand that a full restaurant will cause delays but waiting 15 minutes for Cheesecake dessert when it's in your namesake and you pass a counter with full selection is a bit much. Maybe it was late and the girls were ready for bed, but in my opinion five star service would recognize that. Otherwise perfection!"
Christa H.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2017,"This is one of my favorite places to grab pasta but this locations customer service is horrible I'll start by saying I called in my order to pick it up and was asked whether I wanted the lunch or dinner portion I went with the lunch portion only to be informed upon my arrival that I would be charged the dinner portion bc the person that took my order made a mistake by offering me  the lunch portion bc it was no longer available fine! Then I get home to open my pasta to find not one but 2 strands of hair so I proceeded to call and explain the situation and was told to come back they were making me a new dish and would have a cheesecake of my choice awaiting me, when I arrived my meal still wasn't ready I had to wait for a manager (not the manager I spoke with when I called) to come out before I could even get my new dish  needless to say there was no cheesecake of my choice either just a horrible experience management definitely needs to get it together at this location"
Lina K.,"Marietta, GA",15,22,3,4.0,11/16/2015,As always cheesecake factory was good! The server was polite even though our party was a little bit picky that day :)
Anna N.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,7,,5.0,7/24/2016,"Food great! Cheesecake great! Staffs great! Waiting time, depends... I usually order the ahi tartare, chicken mushroom lettuce wrap, and some other dishes too.  Will definitely go back."
Cori L.,"Alpharetta, GA",271,4,,2.0,5/21/2016,"Had a horrible anniversary at this Cheesecake Factory. Usually, I love the Cheesecake Factory as I have been going to the one on north point for years. The only reason I am giving this restaurant two stars instead of one is because the server was decent. I ordered eggplant Parmesan and could taste the freezer burn on the eggplant. The pasta was clumped together and tasted reheated. My boyfriend ordered the fried shrimp sandwich and that was okay. When we were seated, the table was dirty and the sliver ware was all over the table, I could hear the staff arguing loudly next to me and could barely focus on the conversation I was trying to have with my boyfriend. I usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but this location SUCKS! Go somewhere else or drive to the north point location in Alpharetta!"
Kerry J.,"Lawrenceville, GA",35,15,4,1.0,10/7/2016,"Worse experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever! We were told that our wait time would be 1.5 hours so we told them we would go to the mall. After we waited 1.5 hours, they had the nerves to tell us we only had 5 minutes to get there or we would lose our seats.  We were served the most bland food possible and the manager had the gall to question my child when she sent her food back. I would never ever go back!"
James C.,"Braselton, GA",31,21,,5.0,6/3/2016,Absolutely wonderful food. The menu is almost too large and has endless variety while the desserts are some of the best cheesecake I've had. I have no idea how this is rated so low but I thought the service was great the food was great and the atmosphere was wonderful.
Sue E.,"Buford, GA",30,12,,3.0,6/24/2016,It was good... I like Linda's fudge cake. The service was a bit slow.. and the bill was LARGE... parking was difficult.. all in all it was okay... maybe will go again...
Sarah K.,"Hoschton, GA",0,14,,1.0,2/24/2017,"I have been extremely disappointed with this particular Cheesecake Factory since they opened. One would think they would have it more together, especially considering they were shut down once already for a low health score. After speaking with Meles, the Manager, I have figured out what the problem is at this location, poor management! I asked for him after the young girl at the takeout counter was very rude and unprofessional. I made a simple request regarding my order. They said they would do it. However, when I received my order, it was not as I requested. When Meles came up he said ""that is how we always do it"". Additionally, He was very proud and argued with me.  I explained to him that I have gone to other Cheesecake Factories in Atlanta and never had a problem. He refused to make it right and I had already paid. This whole process took 45 minutes for a to go order! I was completely infuriated when I left. I called another Cheesecake Factory (that is an hour away, but always accommodates my small requests). I spoke with the Manager there, She said it would have been no problem regarding my order, so basically Meles lied to me. How sad is it that someone in a Management position lies, and will not correct an order. Do not got to this location! The customer service is horrible. They will not make any accommodations or exceptions. The food is not as good as their other locations. Also, they are very stingy about the portions. It is well worth an hour drive to one of the other Cheesecake Factories in Atlanta, to not have to deal with constant aggravation from the Buford location!"
