Vicki N.,"Duluth, GA",40,195,133,4.0,2/7/2014,"With all the bad wait times and failing health inspections aside, I had a pleasant time at this location.  My waitress was extremely sweet and attentive. I ordered the buffalo blasts appetizer, samosas small plate, and the boyfriend ordered the Kobe beef burger. We went to the other location maybe two months ago and had the same items and both tasted the exact same.  I will definitely come back here, but on their off peak hours.  I'm taking a star off just because it's always overpriced for the food. Also, the cheesecake is way smaller than the other locations but the same price."
Sabena H.,"Buford, GA",0,17,,1.0,10/2/2016,I haven't ate here is over a year. I stop patronizing this location because service was bad and they always gave you the wrong order when you used curbside service. Well I was tired and in a hurry I ordered from them because its around the corner and I love their Asian salad.  I did curbside service and I ended up going in because no one came out. Then I get home and realized I was given the wrong salad it was the skinny Asian salad after I specified that wasn't the salad I wanted. Called the manager he did nothing sadly I have to leave this place alone for good.  My fellow Buford residents by pass this place and drive down to the perimeter.
Douglas D.,"Lawrenceville, GA",31,16,2,1.0,3/29/2016,This place  needs  some  serious help  one of the front door  is still locked  at 7 pm that should  have  told  us to go somewhere  else   cold food  server forgot to put in  the  appetizer  need a lot more  training
Allie W.,"Atlanta, GA",50,32,3,2.0,2/3/2015,"I've been to this location twice.  First time just for cheesecake. (Quick and easy)  Second time just for a meal. (not so much) Like other posters noticed, the service was slow and there were only 3 full tables in the entire restaurant.   Tons of staff members standing around and giggling and playing.  I forgot the name of what I ordered but it was a chicken dish with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The chicken breast tasted very weird processed and just spongy.    It didn't even look like a regular chicken breast.  My waitress was lost for a while but when she returned and I told her about it she just looked confused.  My friend had to ask her to take it off of the check and she seemed salty about that.  My friend ordered something else but  said her meal was just ""ok.""   I would go back to pick up a slice of cheesecake as a snack but I'd never have a meal there again."
Hunter U.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,150,4,2.0,1/9/2016,"The food is bad, but you get a lot of it and have to stand in line first. The lines at this place make me lose my faith in humanity"
Gui G.,"Atlanta, GA",56,191,79,3.0,7/3/2014,"I always loved Cheesecake Factory food when traveling to US as a tourist. Now, living here, I am starting to get another perspective of this restaurant chain. The food is still good, no matter where you go. The service is usually right and pleasant.  But now, knowing other american restaurants, I can see that the Cheesecake factory is only another regular place. At this time, we had a good Skinny Caesar Salad, some tasty sliders, decent beef kebabs and a bowl of edamame. Like I said, the food around here is good, but just not as good as it was when visiting. As a positive surprise, the espresso was remarkable"
R.D. W.,"Ochopee, FL",0,23,1,1.0,12/7/2014,"It made some headlines when this place first opened and their first inspection by the health department resulted in a grade of ""U"" for unsatisfactory, the worst grade you can get and remain in business. Their recheck earned them only a ""C"".   Since their current score is an ""A"" I thought I'd trust them with our lives. I noticed the one critical violation on their current inspection report was ""Proper cooking time and temperatures "". I thought hmm. That's weird because normally the infraction is over storage temperatures not cooking temperatures. I shrugged it off and said ""Bah, that won't be a problem. I'm sure they learned their lesson"" Fast forward 30 minutes when my chicken madeira is served and I'm looking down at a piece of chicken that is still moving. And clucking. Only it was covered in cheese and mushrooms. It looked up at me and said ""killlll me!"" I asked them to cook it first and they promptly made me a new one. So I give them one star for trying to poison me. Dine at your own risk."
roy a.,"Clarkesville, GA",107,1,2,5.0,9/12/2015,"So this morning in Buford, with my lady and son, hoping for a pleasant visit at Mall of Georgia, we had a hectic start with unexpected issues servicing our car that we left in care of a chain auto service establishment, that shall remain nameless until our car is complete. Needless to say, we were stressed, hungry and sticky from the heat.  We entered Cheesecake factory, and were put at ease by a very accommodating Mallori, who was attentive enough to notice as she offered outside seating that we preferred a booth. To anyone, we would probably have been met somewhat defensively, quickly mentioning to not be placed in the coldest spot in the restaurant. She was undaunted, chipper and confident, truly an asset to comforting Cheesecake factory guests. Mallori directed us to Daniel, who was gracious enough to get us seated and made sure we were copacetic, even got me the correct spelling of Mallori's name. (Stand up guy) Rameen, our charming server, was a very sincere gentleman, no trace of precocious or superficial surface there, pure professionalism, and was spot on timing with bringing out our somewhat neurotic and high maintenance requests, without flaw. All of these folks, made our visit much more uplifting, and I'm grateful to sing Cheesecake Factory's praises as a welcome prescription to an otherwise frazzled morning, into a lovely and satisfying afternoon. Great Ahi Carpaccio value at 13.50, very fresh, and our salads were also satisfying, and more than generous in portion. Rameen's familiarity of wine's will serve him well at this franchise. If in doubt, regarding pairing your taste, put your faith in this guy. Stellar service sets this place apart. Cheers!"
Rahila A.,"Atlanta, GA",103,75,24,4.0,9/17/2014,"I wanted cheesecake, and what better place to get it from then the cheesecake factory?! This location is located at the Mall of Georgia location. (wow that's a lot of locations in one sentence)  We were seated right away, which was such an amazing feeling! (we went on a Tuesday)  The bread and butter, seriously, its like drugs. So good! I would love butter for my bread hahaha ;) ....I seized the moment. I'm not sorry for making that joke lol   I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, it was okay. I've had better at other cheesecake factory. Tasted a little bland. Luckily my server was such a genius, she ordered more sauce on the side for me, I didn't even have to ask for it!  I always take the original cheesecake home. I don't know if it's my fatass, or the slices have gotten smaller. I don't know, maybe I'm greedy when it comes to cheese, who knows? The service was beyond amazing! We had a lovely server! :)"
Todd U.,"Lawrenceville, GA",5,6,1,1.0,3/9/2015,The waitress was great but the food was fair.  -Horribly overpriced -Don't buy the Shrimp Scampi (6 and I mean 6 shrimp with a 1/2 cup of slaw for $20. No Joke.  -Grande Burrito had no chicken in it so I returned it.  -Chicken Bellagio- 2 small pounded pieces of chicken over a large bed of pasta for $15.  I do not recommend going. Cheesecake used to be known for giving medium to large portions...not anymore.
T. M.,"Gray, GA",19,85,12,3.0,1/3/2015,"Merica!   This place represents everything I love about this wonderful country.  Larges plates, Large booths, Large Menu.  They should change the name to Freedom Factory! and serve up plates of liberty! This menu is massive.  Its like reading novel.  So many choices.  Asian, Italian, Mexican, Merican!  Its all over the place! I got the kale salad and the vietnamese spring rolls.  Nice big plates of food here.  Your definitely get your monies worth.   So on to the cheesecake. A place called CHEESECAKE factory should have amazing cheesecake right, well maybe.  I am a cheesecake purist.  Plain ole regular cheesecake is what I wanted, maybe a little sour cream topping.  It was just avg.  I have made better, and I have had better.  I am told if you enjoy cheesecakes jazzed up with Pumpkin, Berries, Peanut butter Oreo cups well then this is your place."
Madison P.,"Lilburn, GA",2,11,3,1.0,8/15/2015,"I am currently standing here waiting for a table and watching the bar tender who has on gloves handle money and the cash register while she then turns to cut the fresh fruit that will be going into some unlucky patrons very expensive drinks. She has not changed her gloves one time and has handled money which studies have shown to be filthy and sometimes containing fecal matter. Cheesecake Factory, you need to get it together. That's disgusting."
Dianna S.,"Westminster, SC",0,1,,1.0,6/3/2016,"Just stopped at the Cheesecake Factory at Mall of Ga. Restaurant. Had to give hostess name, she said someone would walk us to our table in a few minutes. Keep in mind the restaurant was crowded or full by any means. Finally the hostess took us to our table. The last one in the back next to a busing station next to the outside door. We left told the hostess we were leaving, worst seat in the house. She said that was the best available table. Never dined at the Cheesecake Factory and never will!"
Andre A.,"Buford, GA",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Dirty, Nasty and rude customer service! Floors, tables and restrooms disgusting! Rude employees as well! Worse Cheesecake Factory in my 45 years! Will not be returning!"
Ricky R.,"Mantachie, MS",2,9,,3.0,3/4/2016,"The restaurant was very nice, friendly atmosphere. Our waiter, Clifford  very professional. Our group ordered the fish and chips, meatloaf, and hamburger. Our food was ok but not like we would order it again. Fish had no seasoning, bread of burger tough, and meatloaf did not have a good taste. Cheesecake very good."
Randi S.,"St Helens, OR",0,9,,2.0,7/7/2016,"We were seated quickly, and that's about where the good service stopped.  What's frustrating is that it was not busy.  There were many employees standing around gossiping (overheard the conversation) and just chatting.  Our order was wrong and incomplete and the food was mediocre at best (manager did credit us a couple bucks for missing items!?) Super disappointed! Too over priced to risk that crappy service again."
Mohammad A.,"Lilburn, GA",3,29,26,1.0,3/15/2015,It was not good I have to wait for 30 minutes for my food and water bring my food wrong  I think way I want to eat to person I pay 52 $ for two dishes and your food wrong that's not good .
Rochelle O.,"Lawrenceville, GA",76,24,10,2.0,6/15/2014,"First time eating at the Mall of Ga Cheesecake Factory location...our server was wonderful & was very attentive. Other than that, food was not worth coming back for. My family started off with the crab & artichoke dip appetizer- it was oily and not very impressive. The bread chips that came with them tasted like they've been sitting out a while. I ordered the steak Diane & herb crusted salmon combo. The steak was alright, the salmon lacked a lot a flavor. Although crusted with herbs, a little salt (& when I mean a little, I mean A LOT) would of helped. The salmon was also over cooked. The only good part of the dish was the mashed potatoes.  My father ordered shrimp scampi & steak Diane combo and said the shrimp tasted very old. He was not impressed. My fiancé ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas...he took two bites and was highly disappointed. We ended up returning the dish.  The cheesecake was good as always...but other than that, we were disappointed with the food and do not plan on dining with them again."
M M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,11,1,4.0,2/24/2016,Service was good and so was the food! The prices seem a bit high but the food was definitely fresh and prepared the way described. The cheesecake slices were quite large but amazingly delicious!!! I would definitely go back.
Shaun H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,7,,1.0,6/28/2016,Don't call ahead to get an idea of the wait. It's against their policy to tell you over the phone. Absurd.  Customer service is clearly not a priority here.
