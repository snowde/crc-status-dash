Jessica I.,"Suwanee, GA",47,151,,3.0,1/2/2016,"So the first time I've been to one of these was my birthday with my church members since I've never been... We went to the Perimeter location. And I also came to this location with my friends recently for my 24th birthday. It always seems busy and packed here. There is always a wait here. The ambiance is very nice- looks sorta fancy.  The menu can get a bit overwhelming... It's pages and pages of different foods! You literally have everything in one place. Pasta, salads, burgers, so many drinks- from alcoholic to non. Different flavors of cheesecakes! So rich and flavorful. Each time the service here was wonderful! You get what you pay for! Literally. It can be pricey... But the portion size is HUGE! You definitely will have left overs for the next day! Their strawberry lemonade is really good! Very sweet! I also recommend their spicy chipotle chicken pasta! Lots of flavors! Also as an appetizer- the avocado egg rolls! So good!! Parking can be a pain in both locations... I guess because it's located right by the mall. Be prepared to wait... They also take reservations!"
Kerrie B.,"Buford, GA",10,7,,1.0,11/1/2015,"We went for brunch and the food was terrible.  I ordered an omelet and the eggs were thick, tough and cold.  My husband ordered the breakfast platter with eggs over medium, the eggs were very watery.  Way overpriced for the quality of food they are serving, we definitely won't be going back....."
Peppermint L.,"Shenandoah, VA",17,133,54,3.0,8/15/2015,"THIS PLACE IS HUGE. Beautiful lighting and gorgeous decor. It reminds me a bit of Vegas, everything in Vegas must be big, flashy, and beautiful. The staff here is very attentive and friendly, even when it's busy. There's a very large menu that includes multiple cuisines going from Asian, Italian, and American. The food is alright, but it can be a bit pricey depending on what you get and then if you want dessert (which who doesn't when the place has the word ""cheesecake"" in the title), it's going to double the price considering that a slice of their cheesecake is pretty pricey too. I've tried three of their cheesecakes now and I've been impressed with every single one. My advice? Just go straight to the cheesecake, don't even bother with the other food OR just order a whole cheesecake at the counter."
Andrew N.,"Escondido, CA",1101,437,76,1.0,6/26/2015,Not sure how this place makes it being in the mall. The food is not up to par with other cheesecakes I've been to. The only thing i'd come here for is drinks and cheesecake. I would not come back for their food. This place is not good for food.
Savannah S.,"Duluth, GA",6,76,144,4.0,12/29/2013,"Love love love The Cheesecake Factory. This place just opened up in the Mall of GA, so be warned that they are still working out the kinks of long lines and new staff.  The prices are a bit high, but the food portions are huge. The food quality is amazing!  You can't leave without a slice of cheesecake to go.  The decor is nice and elegant and seating is comfy.  Friendly staff, but again, they are new and overwhelmed right now so tension is high until the newness wears off.  I have been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants all across the US and this falls right in line with service and quality that they are known for."
David G.,"Buford, GA",7,3,,1.0,6/1/2015,We're usually big fans of the Cheesecake Factory but for some reason the Mall of Georgia Cheesecake Factory's service is horrible. We have eaten there several times and have experienced really bad to nonexistent service. Love the food but management at this location needs to get their act together.
Brandi W.,"Winder, GA",17,4,2,5.0,1/25/2015,"Thanks to Geneva (manager) and Destiny (Hostess) our evening was saved! They accommodated our party of 30. The waitstaff was fabulous, the food was yummy and the customer service was amazing. Thank you guys so much!"
Ashley F.,"Duluth, GA",0,9,,2.0,4/23/2016,Slow service and lesser quality food at this location. Seasoning is always off. Either too salty or not flavorfil enough.
Aundrea B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",50,7,1,1.0,9/12/2015,"If I could give the  Cheesecake Factory A half of a star I would. The wait time (57 minutes to be exact) was ridiculous! The food wasn't bad but not good either, our waitress was the ONLY pleasant experience we had. Big disappointment for the price. Won't be returning"
Savannah R.,"Buford, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/29/2015,"I would NOT recommend anyone waste there money or time going to this Cheesecake factory, service was terrible and the food was not much better. My family of 6 went for Sunday brunch, the waitress was rude,didn't get our food for 1/2 hour and when we did get it, it was cold. Needless to say we didn't stay for dessert."
Mike W.,"Buford, GA",6,8,,2.0,3/29/2014,"Food is usually good, but this has to be the poorest run restaurant in the world and I'm not even that picky which is why I had to make this post.  ""To go"" order took 45-60 minutes. Bar asked a server to check on our meal and server just shook her head and walked off. Management probably thinks it's not their fault.  Don't know why it was closed when it was opened by a horrible score of cleanliness so can't speak to that.  But I do love the food and the menu so conflicted about coming here."
Enrique G.,"Buford, GA",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2016,Terrible service will never dine here. Waited 15 mins waiting to be helped to get a cheesecake to go. Never once was I asked if I needed assistance. I talked to the manager who directed me back to the cheesecake bar. Waited another 5 mins while the workers talked about what they were going to do on the weekend. Ver y un profesional.
Nina S.,"Atlanta, GA",6,69,16,4.0,10/3/2014,"For a chain restaurant it's not bad, since (with my husband) we've had dined at this restaurant all over the country.  Their menu is huge with a lot of good choices.  We've never had any bad experience with the service.  What we enjoy of this location is the outdoors dining.  Their cheesecake is not one of my favorites even thought they do have a huge selection."
D.L. P.,"Houston, TX",3,62,40,2.0,1/4/2014,"Overpriced and too long of a wait for what you get  we've come twice and both times it was a 2-3hr wait. Third time was a charm, but also around 11pm! My mediocre rating reflects the food - the wait staff and ambience were fantastic. We had the Vietnamese chilled shrimp wraps to start, they were good but not very many shrimp in each roll. My husband had the ban bang shrimp, it was delicious. I had the fish tacos; no bueno. The tempura batter was too thick, and the tortillas were stiff and hard to eat. I expected a slaw bit got dry cabbage instead. The tomato I assume was supposed to be pico was more like a canned tomato topping. I wish the tomato and crema would have come on the side bc they made my fish soggy. Never ordering that dish again!"
Gina N.,"Suwanee, GA",38,96,45,2.0,1/4/2014,"I give them 2 stars because this location is not as great as the location on Ashford-Dunwoody road at Perimeter Mall. Let's just say our server wasn't very good and The food my boyfriend received was way undercooked so we asked if they could cook it a little more. Good customer service would have been to cook a whole new fish, but all they did was put the same piece of fish back onto the grill...unsanitary much???Also,their cheesecake portions are smaller than the ones you would get at perimeter mall. If I am going to pay $7-8 for a piece of cheesecake at least match the standards of other locations."
Gema R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,6,,2.0,6/25/2015,"I think the location of this Cheesecake Factory is bad. I've been to the one in Buckhead and it is way nicer and more formal. The service at Buckhead is way better. Last time we went we got sat next to a table that was dirty. There was a huge piece of cheesecake on the floor. No one bothered to pick it up. I've been a server before and if my managers saw that, they would make someone pick it up immediately. I always get the Chicken and Biscuits and it is amazing! Love it. But they changed the biscuit but it was still good. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but definitely not Mall of Georgia location."
Polar F.,"Dacula, GA",0,32,,2.0,3/26/2014,"To say we're disappointed in this location is putting it mildly. The decor is your typical cheesecake factory, as well as the menu, but the service and flavor is far from consistent. After they addressed the various health violations (publicly available via the county's restaurant inspection site) they still couldn't manage a marked improvement.  To start off, there's the service. If you go with a group the restaurant will be hard pressed to find a spot since it is unnecessarily narrow inside. The place seems bigger than it is, and can be misleading, so get ready for a wait. Hostesses are nice, they do try to seat people quickly, but do not make the best calls due to the large number of guests. I've lost count of the number of times we've been shuffled to tables near the bar and uncomfortably close to groups who should really avoid alcohol at all costs (ps, it doesn't make them as cool as they think). Thankfully, we don't have kids yet but I've seen families cringing because the large party crowd near them isn't behaving properly and don't care if a child is near. In short, this isn't a family place.  The waiters are, like any other restaurant, hit or miss. Our experience so far has been that the closer you're placed to the bar, which you can't avoid due to the previously mentioned items, the faster you'll be rushed out if you don't drink. I understand wanting to free up that space for those who will spend more money once you factor in alcoholic drinks but really, when the place is as slammed as it generally is (1-2 hour wait), the least they could do is treat you like a human being. Yes, there are nice ones  and we've had them, but overall not the majority; it's unfortunate.  The food is...bland; exceedingly so. It may be passable for someone who may have never tried some of their more exotic dishes but for those who have it's blatantly horrid. For example, any of the chicken dishes consist of pre cooked chicken (oven, fried, whatever) without any spices. Any beading follows suit and then that pile of bland food gets a ton of sauce dropped on top - and the sauce is ridiculously over seasoned to hide the bland meat beneath. The only items that so far have not shown this issue are the meatloaf and the appetizers, which taste a lot better than the entrées.  If you've never been here give it a shot, maybe you'll like it more at first but once you eventually try other locations with the same plates you may begin to notice that the flavor isn't worth the extra cost once everything else is factored in."
Meagan S.,"Buford, GA",1,21,,1.0,2/3/2015,I have been twice to this location and both times the service was slow even when the restaurant was not even busy. Food was not that bad but when you have pricey food it should amazing.
Abbi B.,"Suwanee, GA",38,106,21,2.0,9/15/2014,I loveeee the Cheesecake Factory but this location is not good :( I have eaten here several times and it doesn't compare at all to the other factories. I'm disappointed as I live so close to this one would have really enjoyed decent food.
Tony G.,"Alpharetta, GA",29,46,30,5.0,5/8/2014,Delicious food here. All of the service kinks have been worked out. Staff is attentive and service is great now. My wife & I come here 2 or more times a month and have never had a bad experience.  Outdoor serving area is really cozy & comfortable. Great spot.
