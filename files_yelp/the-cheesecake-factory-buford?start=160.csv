Kyle B.,"Cary, NC",21,120,15,2.0,2/22/2015,"Failure of popularity. Too long of a wait, food quality isnt anything to post about, even just going here for dessert and picking up some cheesecake isnt something to do any more."
Jessica H.,"Buford, GA",0,21,,2.0,3/7/2015,"Came on a Saturday night, it was so crowded it's hard to even move around.. Waited over an hour for a table, Once seated we had to ask our waitress for bread, ask twice for lemon for our waters, which we never got, drinks were never re filled, My fiance ordered a burger medium, it came out burnt to the crisp!! When we sent it back it took a good 20 min to get the new one..not very satisfied with the service here tonight."
Olivia B.,"Jefferson, GA",0,1,,5.0,4/2/2016,My first time was great bacon wrap shrimp was delicious . little crowed but overall great place to dine.
Alpana M.,"Atlanta, GA",183,107,171,1.0,10/29/2014,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory multiple times and had great experiences before. In the past I came on special occasions like birthdays and graduations. This time I came on my anniversary. I felt super rushed by the server Robert M. First my friends ordered water and one with no ice. He got upset when I asked for water with ice due to the confusing. Then our bread came out cold. Our food was cold and lacked flavor as well. We ordered chicken piccata, orange chicken, and crusted chicken Romano. All three were not at all good. Then we ordered cheesecake and they brought out half of the cheesecake. We asked them for a whole piece of cheesecake and they just added a piece to our existing cheesecake. We never got water refilled even after asking for it and the manager knew we were upset and never followed up even as he passed our table twice. The only thing I could say is what was left over from our cheesecake was good. We got the raspberry white chocolate truffle."
Darriane M.,"Duluth, GA",112,70,25,1.0,11/6/2015,"Overpriced and overhyped!!! Me and my boyfriend ate here on a Thursday night around 8pm(crowded as usual but surprisingly no wait). The first odd thing i noticed after the hostess sat us down was the utensils were laying on that table... Not on top of napkins or a plate.. Just on the table.. Next, as i was telling the server my order, (burger) i noticed she was barely writing anything down, and she kept trying to sway me to get another burger that i didn't want(which made me to believe that she was that reason my food wasn't right, but I'll get to that) i told her i wanted the lettuce bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions instead of the regular raw onions, well done. She said ok but didn't write anything down so i checked again. She said it already comes with grilled onions.. I said no that menu says it comes with regular onions.. She said ok it will be grilled.. ( i know i may seem picky but for how expensive this place can be i want my food done right!) and after waiting quite some time our food arrives.... My boyfriend was satisfied with his pasta.. My burger was almost RARE. Very pink in the middle.. And dripping pinkish liquid(yuck) with NO lettuce and..... RAW red onions.. It wasn't what i asked for.. Seems to me the server didn't place the order correctly. The manager took it off that bill and that was that. He offered to remake it but we had other places to be... I was very disappointed and the server came to me with a fake apology and when she went to the little computer i saw her make a face .. So. . i wont Be back at this location.. Complete waste of a night ."
Khuram D.,"Lawrenceville, GA",27,249,1,3.0,3/2/2014,"I have to agree with the other reviews in saying that the food is definitely overpriced. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but it isn't that over the top to justify the prices. That being said, the decor is really nice and the staff is super friendly. This is a great place to come to with family and it was a much needed addition to the Mall of GA.  What really stands out here isn't the food but the deserts. We had the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the godiva brownie sundae. Both were incredibly tasty. The burger, pizza, fries, macaroni balls, etc were pretty standard, nothing special."
Chris C.,"Gainesville, GA",26,21,14,3.0,4/22/2015,"Good food, OK service, Nice Atmosphere.  Feels like you are in a mall restaurant."
Sharon P.,"Buford, GA",14,78,5,4.0,12/1/2014,The food is delicious and the service wonderful! I don't understand why the low scores on this restaurant.  My husband and I frequent this place and we have not had a bad experience.  I'm a fan of their Santa Fe Salad and I loved their pumpkin cheesecake!!!
Billy M.,"Jefferson, GA",2,35,4,4.0,3/28/2015,My daughter wanted to come here. This was my first time eating here and we started off with about an hour wait to be seated. After being seated it got better. I ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger and it was huge. I'm a big guy and it filled me up. My wife and daughter were happy with their food and loved their cheesecake. The food is the reason I'm giving them 4 stars. They still need to work on the waiting arrangement. It's a tiny space and it was tight with just 10 people waiting.
Deuk L.,"Atlanta, GA",262,49,22,1.0,6/9/2014,"Possibly the worst Cheesecake Factory in the Metro Atlanta area. When they first opened, I was so excited that I didn't have to drive 30 minutes to the Perimeter Mall location for some of my favorite dishes. I've got to say, the food here is inconsistent. My pasta is sometimes too hard, and the flavors are just bland. Oh right, they also miserably failed their health inspection. I saw little improvements since opening month, but nowhere near good as the other locations in the metro Atlanta area."
Macy M.,"Berkeley Lake, GA",227,61,5,5.0,2/18/2015,Excellent service from Rhonda for my sons 11th birthday! Thanks. Great food as always!!!
Tricia M.,"Loganville, GA",58,3,,1.0,11/15/2015,"Well we went out for a birthday celebration. There was about 30 of us. I know large party but... It took 20 minutes to get a glass of wine and a beer. 30 min to get out appetizer. We finally ordered our meals from the servers that took our orders in a row. Seemed like a great idea. All of a sudden numerous servers came out shouting each plate and WE had to tell them who ordered what. Very unprofessional. Then some ordered cheesecake. The server came to me and said ok who still needs their check and I said we do. She said ok what all did you have on it? Really?? Shouldn't she know that. Half of the table was gone by now. The rest of us are standing in the freezing cold outside trying to stay warm by the heaters. After 40 minutes, literally, I went inside to the servers on the computer and said do you need help? They said yes. I sat there and looked at the checks to help them get each one right. The server looked at the manger and said well we have everything accounted for except 14.75 for a Tex Mex- not too bad. The manager had the nerve to look at me and say can you please call whoever ordered that so they can pay. I flipped. I said absolutely not. You should know who ordered what and had all of this straightened out prior to us getting our checks. The service was horrible. The manager did not have good customer service. I will admit he apologized but gave nothing for ALL of the inconveniences. Food was good. WE will be sure NOT to visit this restaurant ever again. Very disappointed customer!!!!!"
Arron G.,"Buford, GA",0,26,3,1.0,11/13/2015,"The food was terrible. Ordered pasta, which was very salty. The manager was rude and unhelpful. Lost an ítem, and she wouldn't give it back. We are regular customers that come there often and we will not return ever again."
Joanna Q.,"Suwanee, GA",65,66,11,2.0,5/29/2014,"Ahhh the Cheesecake Factory... infamous for its.. well cheesecake of course! When the mall of georgia open this up I thought it would be very popular due to the lack of higher end restaurants in the area. The place is beautiful... BUT this Cheesecake Factory is also infamous for its FAILING HEALTH GRADE, the lowest at a 50 which then improves only to a 76! GROSS! But in my last visit they have improved to a 91. Which I feel after the bad scores, they should really be redoing everything to reach to 100. What didn't really help my iffy disgust with the place was that my spoon was dirty with specks of food on it. So check your utensils before you use them. The food is pricey but of course its a fancy restaurant. Your meal will come with a basket of complimentary bread and butter which you can ask for more if you finish it all because you love bread and carbs like me. The brown bread? (don't know the name sorry) is DELICIOUS and I love it. The menu also features a ""skinnylicous menu"" which is kinda self explanatory. I had some chicken and pear salad? which was alright but knowing my chicken was cold I know my food wasn't fresh. Which is understandable? but you like to have the impression that it is? The pears were yummy with my salad when I had some. The pear to salad ration was really small. My boyfriend decide he would get the filet mignon which was cook well to his opinion. He decided to a side of onion rings but they were GROSS. Flavorless and very mushy. The onion really did not have any onion taste to it rather than a watery one instead so I would avoid those. All the times I've came my service was fine but nothing I was impressed with.  If you never eat the food I think it will be okay but try a cheesecake once in your life. You can take cheesecake to go and they will put it in a container with a side of whipped cream. Which is really just whipped cream because it has no taste to it really and I guess thats because the cheesecake is sweet itself? But you must know that all the cheesecakes are frozen and sent to them. I've asked and their terminology is ""deeply chilled"". My favorite is the red velvet cheesecake but I haven't tried many of them. They also have other cakes without cheesecake if you come and are looking for dessert. There are also some flavors you can buy a whole pie if you'd like. Comes in different sizes as well but only for some flavors! Cheesecake is pricey like everything else but I would try it just once if you like cheesecake!"
Ezza D.,"Duluth, GA",3,5,4,1.0,9/10/2015,"Coming here was one of the worst decisions I made in recent history with regards to dining. They made us wait an hour and forty minutes to be seated, ten minutes to get a server, and fifteen minutes to get some bread on the table. We had a party of eight, and we got our two entrees with the bread, then nothing for another twenty minutes. Management here is unapologetic. The food was alright, but certainly not worth the wait. If you're really wanting to eat at the Mall of Georgia, I suggest PF Changs instead."
Private P.,"Buford, GA",2,2,,1.0,5/21/2014,"The food was very disappointing. My husband had the Steak Diane which under normal circumstances is amazing. However, after waiting 45+ minutes for our food the Steak came out not seared but boiled.... yes.... simmered in liquid.... needless to say it was overdone and a grayish white color. Also tasted like salted meat instead of a good steak. The potatoes consisted of large chunks which were subsequently crunchy in the center. We have had a number of bad experiences at the Mall of GA location but this was the final straw. A $90.00 meal should never consist of chewy sub-par food. We will not make the mistake of visiting this location again."
Eric B.,"Anderson, SC",0,11,3,2.0,7/1/2014,Food was well prepared.  Wasn't prepared for a 2 and a half hour meal on a weeknight.  Service was slow all night.  Also surprised to find out they were out of Vanilla Ice cream.
Boz W.,"Buford, GA",0,11,,1.0,1/17/2014,"Very disappointing. Ordering somethng as simple as scrambled eggs and bacon (soft). I was delivered hard, rubbery eggs and a dry English Muffin. By the time I could get some butter for the muffin it was cold, hard and inedible. The bacon, which arrived at least 5 minutes after everythng else and was supposed to be soft was extra crisp, again inedible. The waitress was extremely inattentive but seemed shocked that we declined cheesecake. I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for many years and and have always enjoyed it, but this experience was easily outdone by the Waffle House I stopped at after so I could get something that was actually edible. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory."
Abbey H.,"Buford, GA",14,7,,4.0,2/6/2014,"We went when this location first opened. Yes -- it was busy, busy, busy! So are all Cheesecake Factory locations. Plus, you'll wait forever at any Mall of Georgia restaurant! It was worth the wait! I ordered my favorite - Chicken Madera, kind of like Chicken Marsala--- and it was really good. We also had the calamari appetizer. It was the first time I had tried it and it was also delicious. Our server went out of her way to meet all of our requests and it never seemed to take too long for her to check on us. Overall, it was a good experience."
Amanda V.,"Escondido, CA",5,37,25,1.0,8/24/2014,"This specific location is one of the worst experiences I've had here. I don't even know where to begin. We sat down rather quick which was nice, I believe it was a weekday so we didn't expect it to take very long anyways. We were able to order food and apps. I ordered the chicken carbonara which came out with no chicken. My boyfriend ordered the steak and chicken with mash potatoes and the steak came out bleeding. They had to take back the steak and cook it a little more. I thought the waiter was the saving grace considering food wasn't the best. Maybe it was an off day but I wanted more flavor. My water never got filled but my boyfriend got refills whenever his cup was half empty. I'm not sure how that worked out. We've been to a few of these since they're all over California and we've never had a bad experience. I don't know what happened to Georgia but they should step up their game. We won't be returning."
