Fabulous F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,37,,2.0,1/14/2016,"Haven't visited a Cheesecake Factory in a long time so thought we'd give it a try. We had eaten here when it first opened but didn't go back because of their low food score. They have since improved it greatly; however, was very disappointed in the overall experience except for the server who did a wonderful job. The iced tea is very overpriced at $3 a glass (free refills of course but still....). I ordered the meatloaf and it was overdosed in brown gravy. Not to mention the portion (which I know was ""lunch"") was very small. Had I been much hungrier I'd still be starving. Also tried 2 different types of cheesecakes and my oh my they are incredibly sweet and I love ""sweets"" but not that sweet. The server was kind enough to comp the first one we ordered.  We ended up not even eating the 2nd one she brought because it too was like way beyond sweet. For 2 of us the bill came to 40 something dollars and some change which I thought was very expensive for lunch. We both had iced tea, one entree was a ""lunch"" entree and the other was a salad. Would I go back? Probably not unless it (Cheesecake Factory) was in the front of my car and I couldn't get around it...."
Elina F.,"Buford, GA",52,12,,5.0,4/4/2014,Wonderful experience a few nights ago! We went in about 30 mins before they closed and were made to feel everyone had time for us! We ordered the Huevos Rancheros for dinner! They were absolutely wonderful!!!
Paul B.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,17,1,1.0,2/1/2014,May have given it a higher score if I actually ate here.  I decided to not eat here after the back to back health department scores of 50 and 76.  I expect a factory to be somewhat dirty but that was too much.
Todd M.,"Dacula, GA",2,69,17,2.0,1/11/2014,"Really bad experience at the Mall of GA Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to the Perimeter location and Buckhead location for several visits, and where it is not my favorite restaurant, it is fairly reliable in terms of what you do get.  I won't get into the overpriced mediocre quality food, because that is what you get here.  It is ""Nice Event"" food for people who do not know good food and do not mind dropping $100 on a meal for two.  If you cook for yourself, you cook better than this period! What I will get into is the management of this particular location.  At the particular time we were there the wait was about 2 hours for a table.  We got lucky and got a first come/first serve high top table by the bar after waiting for about 45 minutes.  At first the mass crowd waiting for a table was out by the entrance but soon, they started  making their way into the restaurant, past the hostess area, standing around in the aisles between tables, etc.  Anywhere someone could stand, they would.  Many stood in large groups just a foot from our table where myself, wife and children were trying to have a decent dinner.  We could not look up without staring some complete stranger in the face because they were just standing there next to the tables waiting for tables to be empty.  What type of restaurant manager thinks it is OK to let customers come in and loiter around the tables where your serving meals?  I mean, if I was at a bar or a pub, I wouldn't expect anything else, but a place where the average plate is $15-$20 each??  You really should try to make the environment more enjoyable.  Our food had just arrived and I had a family come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and ask, ""Can we have your table after you are done?"".  I was shocked that me, a son of a blue collar midwest family had more decency and manners than most everyone standing around me.  In what alternate universe is it OK to come up to complete strangers at a nice restaurant, right after their food arrives and start talking to them?   Yep..I told him there wasn't a chance in h*ll that I was giving my table to him or anyone else in his family because he didn't have the common decency to allow us to enjoy a dinner we were just served. So if you like beautiful surroundings crammed full of ignorant folks who think money buys them class, this place might be for you.  Truth is you can get the exact same quality food at most of the places around Buford.  I would suggest it is worth a visit only for desert.  Go to Rico's World Kitchen or some other small, but high end food establishment...they get what it means to treat customers right!"

Keisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",20,178,181,4.0,12/28/2013,"This CF has only been open for a week and has claimed the title of busiest restaurant in the area, to no surprise, holding its own against the likes of nearby P. F. Changs, Chow Baby, Tin Lizzy and a plethora of other offerings. Exemplary meals and absolutely fantastic desserts, but you will wait a VERY long time for its goodness. Our party of two wait time today (a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon) was 1.5 hours. By the time we left it was 2.5 hours. To expedite your time here, know what you want before you get to your table. The hostesses are supposed to give you a menu once you decide you're going to stay (ours didn't, and when we asked for one we were met with attitude, hence the 4 stars). As soon as we were seated we placed our entire order, drinks, appetizers, entree, dessert and all. By the time we finished the complimentary bread our meals were ready. The speedy service definitely made up for the long wait, it's always worth it in the end but you have to have lots of patience, especially in the always busy Mall of Ga area. I don't suppose there's anything the restaurant can do about this other than consider moving to reservations only. I've been to CF's nationwide and the long wait time is pretty much standard. Tip: pay for the valet parking if you're there on a weekend. You will be hard pressed to find a spot nearby on your own.  All in all, always worth the wait."
Cassandra C.,"Buford, GA",0,12,,4.0,12/31/2013,"So glad they opened one in Buford! They were busy when we went on a Monday 12/23 and was crowded during lunch time. I can only imagine how busy they are on a weekend night. The food was good, service was great, and the cheesecake was superb! Will be back!"
