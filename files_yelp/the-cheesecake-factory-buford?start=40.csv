Kennay N.,"Duluth, GA",0,5,1,5.0,7/31/2017,"Some great cheesecake! As far as food, the menu can be overwhelming but lots of choices and really good pasta options. And of course save room for their selection of over 20 different cheesecakes. And their strawberry lemonade is awesome!"
Maya C.,"Frisco, TX",0,6,6,1.0,11/18/2016,Took forever to seat a large party of 8.  Waited over 2 hours for my mothers 60th birthday.  Unacceptable!!! Manager was unapologetic.  Preferred to tell my party we waited 2 hours and 7 minutes than to have satisfied customers that would more than likely patronize that particular Cheesecake Factory often.   Two thumbs down    The waitress was very attentive and the best part of the dinner.
Amber H.,"Buford, GA",0,1,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Wouldn't recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone in the area. The wait times are long, but that can be expected during peak times. However, I have been here two different times and been told that I was paged for my table AND NEVER WAS! I was then pushed aside and told I would have to start my wait all over again. THEN once I am finally seated, it has taken the server 20 minutes to even come by. BAD SERVICE outweighs how good the food can be."
Timmy K.,"Lilburn, GA",127,40,43,2.0,5/25/2017,"My friends and I always come here as a ""get away"" after work away from all the crazy and stress. To start off, if you are starving and haven't made a reservation or not ready to wait, don't come here. If you are coming here, be prepared to wait as much as over an hour on a busy evening. Each time my friends I have come, we always wait at least a while to be seated. The inside is very nice and cozy, lights are very dim. Booths are very spacious as well and can fit a party of 6. The food is pretty decent, BUT not decent for the price. Dinner entrees range from $14.99-$21.99. Some dishes are pretty huge and some are actually very small and not worth it. The pasta both times were decent to me despite, getting two different ones. I think the restaurant focuses more on appearance than the do on taste. Service was decent. We didn't get any straws, and our waitress didn't give us straws til we decided to order cheesecake. The cheesecake there was just plain awful. I've heard everyone telling me about how great the cheesecakes are but the cheesecake is not reflected on the actually price. Cheesecake price ranges from $6.95-$8.95. The waitress recommended the Oreo cheesecake to me the most recent time I visited, and it was just not great. The oreos were beyond stale, and the ""cheese"" on the cheesecake tasted like melted whipcream. I was just very disappointed with the selections I chose and it has reflected on how I feel about the restaurant as a whole."
Sim N.,"Lawrenceville, GA",157,106,239,3.0,9/15/2015,"Came here Saturday right in the middle of a dinner rush, waited about 30 minutes to be sat for 2 but couldn't complain since we were waiting outside in such nice weather. Can't say what it's gonna be like in the winter, pretty sure won't go at a busy time since the wait can get pretty long.  Place is huge. Even when I thought I saw all of the restaurant, there's a whole left side filled with booths. We sat outside and our server was sweet and efficient. Started out with some bread and to be honest that was the best thing I had to eat the whole night. Was torn between the cabonara and the cajun jambalaya pasta but ended up getting the latter. The pasta was not tossed fully into the ""sauce"" so there was a big junk of dry noodles at the bottom of the plate. Although I tried to mix everything, it just didn't taste as good as the menu described. Not even parmesan cheese could save the poor thing. Ended up taking the rest home and got cheesecake to go. We got the white chocolate macadamia one and was just like any other cheesecake I ever tasted, still pretty satisfying. I'd still rather take the bread over it.  Seems like they have a wide range of dishes so maybe next time when I want to splurge on mediocre food but pleasant atmosphere I'll swing by."
Donna G.,"Buford, GA",1,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Great menu, too bad wait times are 3 hours and it takes forever to get your food!  We provided feedback to the manager and unfortunately didn't have much to say, but there's 11 parties ahead of you and wait times vary.  It's a big restaurant with outdoor seating, so if takes 3 hours to sit 11 parties there's something wrong with your service!"
Lauren H.,"Loganville, GA",43,69,7,1.0,2/20/2017,At first I would have given a good review but 7 hours later and my one year old throwing up chicken from lunch I would say her lunch gave her food poisoning. This location has had food rating issues in the past with failing scores which I though was fixed. Apparently this location is still not up to par. I expect more from this franchise. Go to the perimeter location or one downtown but steal clear of this one at the mall of Georgia.
Dwight F.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,,3.0,9/15/2017,"I typically enjoy The Cheesecake Factory, even with the typical wait times, but the service is starting to lag and getting the check to leave seems to be as long of a wait as getting in the door. The food is still great and the overall experience is alright, but don't go there if you have an event scheduled for afterwards....you probably won't make it."
Faydria G.,"Atlanta, GA",143,155,1843,5.0,2/21/2016,I'm giving Cheesecake Factory five stars only for their cheesecakes. I've never eaten anything else in the restaurant. So! Therefore I will do a update review whenever I decide to set down on the inside and try out there food. But! Right now the Cheesecakes of any flavor is the best.
Tony J.,"Duluth, GA",2,14,24,2.0,2/19/2017,Visited on a Sunday and after a 45 minute wait my waffle was cold and hard. The crab hash for one of my party was excellent and the side salad was good. The service was extremely slow and servers were all over the restaurant in an disorganized fashion. I guess we should have just come for the cheesecake.
S H.,"Clarkesville, GA",0,10,,2.0,9/30/2017,This was our worst experience at s Cheesecake Factory. My husband and I thought we would go in for a quick appetizer since we didn't eat lunch. We got the lettuce wraps and a buffalo chicken appetizer. It took close to 45 minutes to get our food. The food was not bad. I found a dead bug on my lettuce but someone that looked to be some sort of manager was near us and I showed him and he said he would have a new plate right out. He did- we had to ask someone other than our server twice to fill up our drinks. We are usually really good tippers but he did not deserve much. He came by once- but had the time to stand at the cash register right in front of us for 5 minutes talking to someone else. Won't be coming back to this location for sure.
ChauPha N.,"Clarkston, GA",265,326,407,2.0,8/8/2016,"Boyfriend and I were in the area so we decided to grab dinner at this location of the Cheesecake Factory. It was a big disappointment. The wait time weren't long, we were seated after 10 minutes of waiting. Our waitress was nice enough, but the real problems is the foods. I ordered the Cheesecake Factory's Famous Meatloaf and when it comes out, it was super salty. So I informed our waitress who then got the manager. When the manager comes over to my table and I told her the meatloaf was overly salty, she just say she couldn't do anything about it and if I want something else, in a thats that manner. No apologies for the inconvenience or the fact that we waited a long time for meal. My boyfriend's was finished with his dinner before the manager even comes over. Overall, my whole meal was a big waste of time. In general, I will take my business elsewhere. I rather take my money to somewhere else that value my business and try harder to keep my business. Thanks Cheesecake Factory Buford, but I won't be coming back. First time dining and will be last time at this location."
Rudi H.,"Buford, GA",414,11,3,5.0,11/10/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Mall of Georgia is always kept clean, no matter when I go there.  The atmosphere is great, music is never too loud, and the restaurant is always busy.   Their salads (especially their Barbeque Chicken Salad) are amazing.  They also have a Kale and Quinoa Salad that is smaller, but it is easily one of my favorite things on the menu.   The food just never disappoints, whether it be appetizers, entrees, or dessert.  Even their drinks are on point, with a variety of options to choose from.  Kind, friendly, and approachable staff that knows exactly what they are doing.   I would recommend coming to this location if you're in the area.  It is always my choice for a good sit down restaurant with friends, a loved one, or family."
Jim W.,"Peachtree City, GA",8,435,,4.0,1/30/2016,"I think we may have had dessert at the now-defunct Buckhead branch of this chain around 20 years ago.  Until this week, that was my only exposure. We got to this location around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday, which appeared to be just in advance of the wave of customers who descend on it around then.  They stop taking reservations for any timeslot after 5 p.m.  I guess we were fortunate to have no wait-time. The menu is fairly overwhelming.  Other than obviously cheesecakes, they don't really specialize in anything.  If you're a novice (like us), you'll likely need extra time just to plow through the entire menu and narrow down your choices.  Our party started with pot-stickers as an appetizer, which were fairly good.  We are used to home-made, and the C.F. versions were better than some Asian restaurants, so props for that.  As for the entrees, their burger was at least above average.  The fish tacos were also fine, and they gave you 4 of them.  The 3rd dish, some sort of pasta / scampi, elicited no complaints either.   The cheesecake (Tuxedo) we split for dessert was quite good.   Sure, it is a chain.  If you feel bad about that, look to your right as you enter and tell yourself that you aren't going to P.F. Chang's."
Chris R.,"Bellingham, WA",0,57,18,1.0,1/4/2017,"This location cares very little about customer service, just abysmal. A little busy, I get it. Waited 50 minutes for a table when they estimated 20-30 minutes. Not so bad, hard to estimate how long it takes to get people moving and clean up tables. But once we sat down we waited a while to see a waitress, then waited about 20 minutes to get bread and water. 65 minutes after we ordered we got some of our food. Two meals out of four were delivered and then it took another 10 minutes before we got our final two orders, and once of them was missing fries. They said they were short and would bring some separately. Then another waiter comes over and tells us they switched and he will be our waiter now. At least he smiled and had a decent attitude. All of the people we saw up until that point seemed like it was a big inconvenience that they even had to work that day.  Here's a suggestion, get another job where you don't have to deal with people! As for the food, it was mediocre. Jambalaya Pasta was a little rough looking, didn't have a lot of flavor and the chicken was dry and chewy. Skinny Asian Chicken Salad looked okay but we had a hard time finding chicken. Finally found some but it was really just a few threads, and I mean like sewing thread. Philly Cheese sandwich used some meat in it that was very hard to chew. Seemed like it was cut into small strips but it was still stringy and hard to chew. Overall, not a great experience, and we spent way too much time at this place for such a bad experience."
Jack F.,"White, GA",0,8,,1.0,4/8/2017,"They don't take reservations, then when I got there they told me 2-3 hour wait. If they can't manage their table turns any better than that, I will never go back!  There is no food worth a three hour wait, especially food from a chain restaurant."
Eric T.,"Suwanee, GA",107,214,2518,3.0,7/23/2015,"The food here is a fusion of Asian, American, and Italian. That's probably the best way to describe it. The interior design here is great by the way, reminded me of a Las Vegas hotel. The food was okay however. It was nothing I never had before and nothing blew me away in terms of taste. It wasn't bad but at the same time it could've been a lot better. I'll give this place another shot in the future, and I may update this review when that time comes, but for now I would say it was okay overall. My Recommendations; -Strawberry Cheesecake Menu:"
James T.,"Acworth, GA",1,156,21,4.0,8/15/2016,Lol. I thought they only had cheesecake! But sweet baby Jesus they have every thing. I mean seriously the menu is a book! Great tastes. A bit expensive. Super service.
Lauren H.,"Atlanta, GA",547,417,939,4.0,11/30/2014,"I dined here last night for my birthday. My family and I came here around 7pm and we were quoted a 40 minute wait for a party of 3 (2 adults and a toddler). I expected there to be a wait since it was a weekend evening and 40 minutes wasn't too bad considering I've been quoted longer wait times before at The Cheesecake Factory.  After entertaining our daughter for approximately 40 minutes, we were seated.  Shortly after we were seated, our waitress came out to take our drink orders. I had their strawberry martini and it was good. It was tasty and had a nice little kick to it. We tried the ahi tuna carpaccio for our appetizer and it was really good! My husband isn't a fan of fish but he also really loved the dish. For our entrees, I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, my husband had a cheeseburger with fries and our little girl had chicken fingers with fruit. I liked how the waitress had the chicken fingers come out at the same time as the appetizer so that our little girl didn't have to wait to start her dinner. The chicken fingers came out piping hot and were actually not too bad. They came with two different dipping sauces, honey mustard and ranch. Our little girl seemed to enjoy her chicken fingers.  I really liked my garlic noodles, I just wish it came with more than just 4 pieces of shrimp. The dish was really garlicky which I loved and all the flavors melded very well together. My husband said that his burger was a standard burger but since he was craving burgers it really hit the spot for him. I was too full for dessert so decided to order a slice of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a little hot chocolate sundae and sang happy birthday to me.  Even though they were super busy, service was still good and our food came out quick."
Aaron J.,"Atlanta, GA",39,26,,1.0,2/7/2017,This place is a disaster. Will never be back. I ordered 3 entrees plus a crab cake appetizer to go from the bar. They weren't even busy and the order took forever. Then I get home and they only included 2 entrees. This was after I tipped the bartender over 20 percent. I called the store and the manager wouldnt even speak to me and instead hid behind the bartender's back. He/she said they would adjust the bill. Pretty lame. And the food was mediocre at best.
