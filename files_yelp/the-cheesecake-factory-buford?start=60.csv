Jay C.,"Buford, GA",50,216,398,5.0,7/28/2016,Tonight was the best we've had here. It wasn't just great it was PERFECT! From the time we walked in until we were seated! I see a lot of improvements from our last visit. And we shall visit again soon. Had to give them space.
Ravi B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1427,538,1933,2.0,11/2/2014,"Summary: Go straight to the bar and order a drink and cheesecake to-go. Hm... I guess you need to have a bad experience in order to appreciate the good ones. I had been having a lot of great experiences until we came to the Cheesecake Factory at Mall of GA!  The lunch started off on the wrong foot when we ordered for my cousin who was on the phone some water without ice trying to be helpful. When she realized that we ordered it wrong we asked the server for water with ice and he got defensive, but went and got us some ice water. He brought us some bread after we ordered and it was cold. I got the parmesean-encrusted chicken romano. My cousin got the orange chicken and my brother-in-law got the chicken picatta which is one of his favorite dishes that he has gotten at other locations. When we got our food, my pasta lacked flavor. My brother in law's pasta and my pasta both needed some more sauce. The orange chicken was good, but the rice was gross.  We tried to look past these issues by ordering some raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. We're thinking, well they can't screw up cheesecake! Surprisingly, we were actually sort of wrong. The cheesecake came back looking half of it was cut off. We asked our server if it was possible for a different piece. I felt like I was ""tattle-taleing on my server"" and he had to bring someone to diffuse the situation. All we wanted was a proper piece of cheesecake! He brought the manager. When the manager arrived, we could have mentioned how we didn't enjoy our food and the server was a jerk, but we focused on the simple act of a new piece of cheesecake when we didn't touch the one we got. The manager said he would get us a new one. Well our server was the one who actually got us the new piece and it looked basically like the old one with a little extra whip cream.  Ok... at that point we needed to quickly get home anyway. After getting the piece, the server took forever to get us the forks, and then the check. Maybe his life would have been easier if he just brought all 3 at once instead of flusteredly bringing them all separately and realizing he forgot the next thing.  We were disappointed the manager didn't come ask us if our complaint was resolved nor did he feel that our complaint was worthy enough for him to personally bring us the cheesecake. I have had many experiences where the manager has made my experience from poor to amazing (Example - Red Robin in Snellville). This one didn't seem to care at all.  Either this Cheesecake factory is short-staffed and our server had too many tables or he honestly didn't seem to care if we had a good experience. I rarely write about bad experiences because I usually can see the bright side. Not this time! And I have been to many cheesecake factories."
Ian P.,"Buford, GA",3,35,5,4.0,4/29/2017,"Even though they have a bad reputation for their food, I was pleasantly surprised. Too many options on the menu first of all, but I really enjoyed my steak Diane. Old school food choice I know, but I like meat, and I like gravy and I definitely like them together. Cheesecake in my opinion still reigns supreme. Red velvet, Oreo, white chocolate, and tuxedo some of my favs."
Dale B.,"Buford, GA",0,6,1,1.0,4/14/2017,"Our visit on 4/13/2017 was soooo bad!  We were greeted indifferently by a hostess who wrote our name on a card and said 'Listen for your name"" We were seated by a guy who had no clue who our waiter was -- and didn't offer to find out.  Our waiter presented herself, Kassandra. We explained our drink preferences, including to please constantly keep our soft drink filled and our margarita NOT SWEET. The margarita arrived VERY sweet and this time she said 'That's the way they do it' like there could be no variation.  She failed on keeping soft drink glasses filled and needed to be reminded EVERY time.  To speak to her, I had to hold my arm out to flag her down, else she would walk by without checking on our needs.  The management apparently spreads waiters between areas so we saw about 5 waiters in our area and her rarely, a sign of bad management and there were PLENTY of those signs! We ordered a tamale appetizer.  That was very slow arriving. Someone else brought that eventually, loaded in sour cream, although we had requested it not be included.  Its replacement was very slow arriving.  Kassandra did come by and denied hearing our 'no sour cream' request.  I ordered a filet mignon well done and requested it be butterflied to ensure it actually would be.  She said they didn't do that but they could cut it into small pieces - she called those medallions.   I told her it was common practice to butterfly steaks and I did not want chopped steak just because they didn't know how to butterfly one. She argued some more and finally I told her to keep it whole and be sure it was well done.   The meals arrived.  The steak was rare - blood red! She left my wife's meal with us and we asked for the manager.   Mellis arrived and we explained our frustration and he assured us the chef DID know how to butterfly and he seemed puzzled that Kassandra had argued the point.  My wife finished her meal (we had to request a box, as none was offered).  After a long wait, the butterflied steak arrived, well done at last.  I ate what I wanted and asked for a box.  We asked for the bill. Imagine our surprise when it was for the full amount.  No discount offered, despite a very disrupted and frustrating meal.  We asked for another visit with Mellis.  We expressed our shock to Mellis. He agreed it should have been discounted. He brought us a new bill and he ONLY removed the appetizer!  We complained.  The bill was close to $100 and the appetizer was a not-worth-it $13.  We reluctantly paid and left, ending our very final trip to Cheesecake Factory. EVER!"
Christian E.,"Buford, GA",86,44,198,4.0,10/17/2016,"Excellent service, food & drinks. The wait was exactly what they predicted. I have noticed the ultimate red velvet cheesecake is a lot smaller than it used to be. The peach Bellini & calamari were excellent"
Bryan L.,"Lahaina, HI",52,5,1,5.0,4/28/2017,Our waiter tonight was Timothy H. and he was fantastic and took care of our group! He was prompt at serving us and getting us anything else we needed.
Lynn O.,"Buford, GA",2,7,4,3.0,1/17/2017,"Nothing really special about this place. There's always a long wait no matter what time of the day it is even when it's not busy, and customer service isn't the greatest either. Be prepared to wait for a while for the food orders also."
Joelyn G.,"Flowery Branch, GA",0,11,2,1.0,1/15/2017,DISGUSTING! The food main course was nasty. The noodles was over cooked like they should of just called it baby food. The shrimp had a fishy old taste to it. I took two bites and dropped my fork. The service was great that's the only reason it got one star out of me. I love the Lenox location. The food there is exceptional. The food here is garbage. FIRE THE KITCHEN STAFF! START OVER!
Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",529,1116,3663,2.0,9/21/2014,"Um. There are definitely mixed feelings about today's visit. My bro and I had an okay ordeal overall. My friend and her friend, well, it was on the opposite end of the spectrum. It was like she wasn't meant to eat here on this particular day nor did her friend.  As she stated, everything started with the waitress then went downhill from there. Our waitress wasn't terrible by any means, but she could have been more cordial since she had a slight tone and was forgetful. At one point she somewhat let the bread basket dropped onto the table making it slide to its final resting place. Not graceful at all. Oh. And she neglected to bring it out until later too.  My friend's medium rare burger was more like a rare burger. Even the manager agreed it was so. The sweet potato fries she ordered, well, it turned into regular fries. Even though her lemonade wasn't filled in a timely manner, it was eventually refilled, and she enjoyed that. It was pretty much the only thing she enjoyed and consumed the whole time we were here.  My friend's friend... Well, her toast came out a tad too toasted. It wasn't burnt, but it was too black. That's not all. Sadly. Her omelet tasted as if it was cooked in sugar versus salt. Everyone at the table agreed so as we all did a sample taste. The manager (another gentleman this time), said that this was the second complaint of the morning. :\ And then the new toast finally came out when this second manager stopped by our table. Yikes people.  The food my bro and I had was delish. The plate was huge, and we were glad we shared the chicken madeira. We ordered the mango key lime pie to go, but haven't had a chance to taste it. I think I'd give this place another try to see how service changes, but overall, NOT impressed by any means whatsoever."
Brian C.,"Suwanee, GA",2,3,,5.0,4/18/2017,Today was the second time coming here and the service has not disapointed yet! Very friendly servers and food came out pretty fast! Food was cooked perfectly! Had a great time!
Micah S.,"Norcross, GA",174,3,1,2.0,11/29/2016,Well Im sitting here now. There isnt a crowd at all. Ive waited 40 minutes just for bread and almost an hour for my meal which can out over cooked and not freshly cooked. I'm hungry so Im eating it. I'm very disappointed because I'm use to good service and hot food whenever I come. I'll go back to the Perimeter location.
Demi M.,"Atlanta, GA",108,102,730,4.0,4/13/2016,"Located at the Mall of Ga, directly across from PF Changs, is the relatively new Cheesecake Factory. You can expect it to have long wait times if you come Fri-Sun, like at any other CF location. They have ""happy hour"" from 4-6 Monday-Friday in the bar area where they have about 20 appetizers and flat breads to choose from for under $5.50 (about half price of what they would usually charge if not a little more) yet the portion size is the same. Drinks, however are NOT half priced during this time. They have an extensive menu and serve rather large portions. Both food and service, here and really at every location I've ever eaten at, have always been great.  Things I LOVE that I can remember at this present moment: BROWN BREAD BROWN BREAD BROWN BREAD- why do they even bother bringing the white one out? No one eats it!  :) Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes; this is a heavenly plate of you guessed it- sweet corn tamales. It's served with sour cream on top, diced avocado and tomato. Trust me, just get it.  Buffalo Blasts; why has it taken me 15 years to try this? I'm not a huge fan of buffalo anything mainly because I don't like spicy but our waitress told me it really wasn't spicy and the buffalo sauce came on the side, so we ordered this. OMG. I love this just as much as my regular Sweet Corn Tamales. It is deep fried triangles loaded with shredded chicken and comes with blue cheese on the side as well. It is a very generous serving.  Calamari; easily one of our all time favorite calamari's. Salty, not overly chewy, comes with a delicious sauce... yum. Just yum. Avocado Egg Rolls; exactly that. I don't believe there is any meat to this, which is nice. Comes with a green sweet sauce. This is a popular appetizer, yet I think there are so many other rolls that may be better. This is literally just avocado. Tuna Tartare; a bit small considering the sizes of most dishes here. But good, refreshing and presentable.  Stuffed Mushrooms; not much to it but they are good. Especially during Happy Hour. Jambalaya; AMAZING. Literally, any and every pasta are delicious and HUGE servings. You can easily share or if that's not your thing you will probably take some home. :) There has not been one cheesecake I haven't liked here. They are all delicious. My favorite is probably Chris's outrageous cheesecake. It has chocolate chips AND coconut. It's a perfect balance and not overly sweet. Salted Caramel cheesecake is high on my list as well. To drink- I love their Bourbon & Honey. Things neither here nor there but that I will note..... I didn't have time to tell the waitress or hostess that it was my fiancé's birthday but hoped when she asked to see his ID that she would notice. She didn't, and though I cant blame her for not knowing todays date; I was secretly disappointed.  Although I have frequented this location a lot, it took me a while to come for the first time.(THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID ;-) )  No, but really... it did. Because of the failed health scores and all.... But the last two times that I have remembered to check, they are displaying a 90.... I make it a point to look at this before asking to be seated.  It HURTS my heart and soul that drinks aren't half off for Happy Hour - I heard that there is some strange law here in GA that doesn't make that legal but my god does it bother me to pay more for a drink than an entrée..... and with the possibility that it may be weak or way to strong...  The Cheesecake Factory is a delicious, reliable restaurant. If you don't find something you like here, then you are the problem ;)"
Andy M.,"Athens, GA",1,15,1,3.0,3/17/2017,"Ordered a club sandwich. Had zero taste. And no cheese. Which the menu didn't say it did but in what universe is there no cheese on a club? And the lettuce was chopped up lettuce husks off some wilty romaine. That being said, they didn't charge me for it. And the Cheesecake was divine. These folks have a 30 page menu of food that sucks and the best Cheesecake on Earth? Why not just sell the cake? The 3rd star was for the cake."
Jewel B.,"Suwanee, GA",0,8,3,5.0,9/11/2016,"I'm glad I went instead of depending solely on the reviews. We went for my birthday. It was about 3 PM when we got there, so I thought there would be a long wait. It was not to our wonderful surprise. The waiter's name was Matt, and he was friendly and attentive. I got the sangria, and it was good. I ordered the shrimp scampi and my husband got the Steak Diana. The food was hot, tasty, and fresh. I went with my guard up, after reading all the reviews, expecting to have a bad experience. I must say, I had quite the opposite. Brought cheesecake home, and I can't wait to eat it."
Anthony T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,77,5,4.0,8/14/2016,"Never ever can go wrong with steak Diane. No surprises with this place. Always consistently good. Had vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert classic. Bloody Mary served kinda boring, just two olives. Wish they would enhance the presentation with few things in addition to olives."
Matt E.,"Jefferson, GA",20,15,1,2.0,3/4/2017,Customer service is terrible. Waiter would ask question and take off before we could complete our answer. Had to constantly wait on drinks. Cocktails way over priced. The food was the only saving grace. The food was actually really good. Definitely need more personable wait staff and to review pricing if they want to remain competitive in this area.
Ley S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,14,50,4.0,10/10/2015,"Cheesecake is nothing less than fantastic! Always delicious. I usually get either the mac & cheese burger or chicken carbonara pasta. Both are very good . This time, I got the pasta with extra sauce because it tends to be too dry for me without it.. Kind of salty , very greasy when reheating!  Came with a party of about 18, wait was long and staff wasn't very attentive and tried to rush us out and in as quickly as possible."
Michelle C.,"Dacula, GA",59,5,,5.0,1/31/2017,"Had the most wonderful birthday celebration here last night! Exceptional service, fantastic good, and a clean and beautifully maintained restaurant. Our waitress was so friendly and sweet and made our visit that much more enjoyable. Our table got burgers and tacos and they were delicious, perfectly cooked and brought to our table in a quick and timely manner. The cheesecake was of course delicious as well. We also had a short wait time and dealt with the most polite staff. Had a great time and will be visiting again soon!"
Natalie W.,"Alto, GA",9,155,160,5.0,7/7/2016,"Not a cheesecake fan so I've stayed away from this restaurant for as long as I could. My mom suggested it for lunch today since we were shopping at the mall and she had a gift card. Seriously, pleasantly surprised! Their menu is huge with healthy options that even included legit vegetarian and vegan options. As a struggling vegan, I was thrilled! I ordered the Vegan Cobb and it was phenomenal and huge! My mom got the chicken Cobb and we both had food to take home for tonight. No cheesecake ordered but great service and a lovely lunch for free, thanks to a gift card. I'll be back."
Anthony S.,"Spencer, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/29/2016,"This service is ass. Wide open tables and still had to wait. Waiters are awful, rude, and slow."
