Austin K.,"Atlanta, GA",94,99,471,2.0,4/19/2015,Would've be one star if the server or manager didn't fix the problem.... It was very slow... I am not sure which part went wrong but my food was up about 30 mins after all others got there's....and its over one hours after I place the order... And what I got is a under cook pasta and overcook with half side burned chicken... Lucky the manager end up didn't charge me anything on the pasta... Got to give them credit for that... Cheesecake is good... They shouldve just sell cheesecake....
Rachael I.,"Columbia, SC",199,83,20,4.0,3/18/2014,"So... This restaurant seems to have had a rough start, but it seems they've worked through all of that. I went with a friend around 6 in the evening and it was packed wall to wall. And it was everyone's birthday. The food was pretty good. We ordered the loaded baked potato bites to share. A really really heavy appetizer it turned out, but good and crispy. I ordered the buffalo wings, and my friend ordered the flatbread. We were both satisfied. Then we ordered a slice of cheesecake to share and were surprised as it is (or at least seemed) a lot smaller than cheesecake slices at other Factory locations. The price was the same too I think. Shrugs. Overall, I think Cheesecake Factories are good if you've got a lot of people to please (they're bound to like something from a menu with a 1000 items.) But for really good, fresh food, go elsewhere. I gave four stars because the service was fantastic. Melissa is a gem!!"
Esther R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,14,,5.0,1/29/2017,Great food! Seasoning on everything is perfect! Very friendly staff. ..I Love  chicken parmesa...Not sure the real name I just know that is pasta
Stephanie K.,"Duluth, GA",12,107,126,5.0,5/15/2015,We were hesitant about coming here after reading the reviews. Boy were they wrong. Our food was fantastic. Shantel was our server  and her knowledge of the menu was awesome. She described several menu items for us. We went with her recommendations and they were great. My chicken piccata was very flavorful and the portion size was large. Everything tasted very fresh. My friend had the bacon bacon burger and loved it. We followed it with the Oreo extreme cheesecake and it was incredible. We will be back soon.
TJ B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",229,5,,1.0,7/2/2017,The service here was awful. Our waitress was very inattentive. It took here a long to see us. When she brought out the bread she just slammed it on the table. I am not sure if Jessica was just having a bad day or what. I usually have great service and a great time here. But I definitely did not today.
Ashbeezy B.,"Suwanee, GA",1584,375,6404,4.0,4/2/2015,The staff here were wonderful! This was my first time at this location. It's a hidden treat at the mall of Ga! Lol. The food was on point! I decided to try something new. The ginger edamame was a delightful choice! I simply loved it! I usually get edamame when I go out but never like this. And I had to get my all time favorite the Jamaican black pepper shrimp! I get it once a year every year & it was cooked to perfection! I will most def be back!!!
Kim T.,"Suwanee, GA",39,38,39,4.0,3/13/2015,"One of my favorite places to go. The food is delicious, friendly staff, and love the cheesecake.  My husband and I been to this location, mall of GA, a couple times. I'm not sure if it happened to other locations as well, but the food portion seemed smaller than the other ones we've been to. But nothing dramatic that we will not come back.  Today, my husband got the Louisiana chicken pasta and I got chicken madeira (my favorite). Both were delicious and flavorful. The only thing we wished was better is the bread. We both like our bread to be hot and crunchy. This one was a bit cold and hard to chew.  We got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake today. (the wife loves cheesecake). It is chocolaty and fluffy from the cake. If you tried the Godiva cheesecake, it's kind of the opposite from it. It's not  as chocolaty, creamy, and cheesy like Godiva.  Other cheesecakes we've tried so far: Godiva - very chocolaty, creamy, and cheesy.  Chris' outrageous cheesecake - if you like chocolate and coconut, you'll like this one Tiramisu cheesecake - it's good but too sweet for us."
Jason H.,"Athens, GA",0,28,4,2.0,1/4/2016,"I'm not the biggest Cheesecake Factory fan (in fact, far from), but I've always considered the national restaurant chain to be an adequate place to get good quality food, as well as exceptional cheesecakes. Unfortunately, this particular location at the Mall of Georgia only manages to fulfill that latter criteria. Simply put, the food was mediocre here. I've never thought Cheesecake Factory served anything eye-poppingly delicious, but this particular restaurant was just bad. I personally ordered the Classic Burger. I know I shouldn't really be ordering burgers from a Cheesecake Factory, but I expected it to taste, well, good! It was a greasy blob. Though this may, admittedly, just be at odds with my personal taste buds. The Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta was the main issue. The shrimp smelled like tap water. Had they properly rinsed and prepared the shrimp, it would not have smelled like this. And I know this isn't how it's supposed to be made, since I've had this dish at other locations just fine. Do order cheesecakes for dessert, however. They're still as wonderful as ever here. Service was also perfectly adequate. Expect long waiting times during dinnertime. I suppose if you're nearby and need to get your Cheesecake Factory fix, then this location will do. But if you're planning on driving from afar just to get some Cheesecake Factory goodies, then I'd suggest the Alpharetta location over this one. On a side note: They placed our utensils on the table bare - unwrapped and directly on the table. Not sure if Cheesecake Factory changed their policies, but I found that to be quite off-putting."
Miss G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",45,95,186,4.0,2/21/2016,"went here on lunch for Saturday 2/20... pretty busy with 15-20mins long of waiting.  the waitress took care of us right away, we got seated, she brought our waters and complimentary bread. Service was great. Ordered Thai Lettuce Salad. My favorite and they never let me down. Superb, fresh and tasty as always.  Ordered Kobe Burger and asked for medium rare but ended up getting the burned burger. I don't know what's going on and didn't really want to send it back to the kitchen because was too hungry. -not sure if this is kitchen's fault or waitress's Overall, definitely will come back again and give another chance."
Linda M.,"Gainesville, GA",0,93,15,1.0,3/8/2017,Absolutely the worst service ever!! It took 30 minutes to get one drink because of a party of 85 and only one bartender! Poor management. I know they don't normally take reservations but for a party if 85 I'm sure they knew ahead of time. Seriously doubt I will ever go back just due to that.
Matthew A.,"Buford, GA",0,22,1,2.0,8/27/2016,"Already been waiting to seat our party of 8 for over 2 hours. Sweat rolling down my back, I can't wait to get inside and I feel sorry for the staff when I do."
Kent H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",43,5,25,4.0,3/29/2016,"Very relaxing on their out door patio, heaters are keeping the chill away.  Server is very attentive and knowledgeable with the menu. Drinks were very quick and strong.  Looking forward to the firecracker salmon appetizer.  2 filet mignons of course!"
Tina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,13,1.0,12/27/2015,"We had really bad service at the bar from Lauren P...first on 12/18, then on 12/24.  Each time we were sitting there first but got served after white patrons who just walked up, each time our appetizer was served to another party, each time we had to ask for plates and silverware when we finally did get our appetizer served to us, each time our entrees were served to another party, each time she stacked our not-finished entree plates on top of one another when we wanted to take our food home, and each time we did not tip.  Yes, black people do tip.  However, I cannot tip on excessively bad service."
Greg F.,"Columbus, GA",0,1,,2.0,6/11/2016,"My wife loves this place but getting seated on the weekend seems to be a joke and management hasn't gotten control of it. They told us an hour wait and it took way longer than that. We were there for a birthday celebration with 2 toddlers and an infant and two seniors, but they restaurant could careless."
Diana T.,"Suwanee, GA",424,308,366,3.0,1/30/2015,"If you buy a $25 gift card, you get a free cheesecake. I was like why not?  This was my first experience here. I came here with one of my girlfriends. The wait time is ridiculous. They gave us a buzzer and we walked around the mall until the buzzed us. It was a good 30 minutes. Our waitress was a sweet girl. She helped us narrow down our choices. This was a HUGE menu. They had anything and everything you could possibly think of. My friend and I am a very indecisive girls. I had ended up getting the miso salmon while my girlfriend got some BBQ pasta dish. Her BBQ pasta dish ended up being tastier than my miso salmon. My miso salmon was bland and I was just not impressed.  I wouldn't recommend majority of the cheesecakes here because they just do not compare to Cafe Intermezzo's cheesecakes. However, one of the girls, Arielle helped me choose a cheesecake that was delicious. Probably the best cheesecake I have had there, so this is why they get 3 stars. It was either the chocolate mousse cheesecake or the Kahlua Cocoa coffee cheesecake. Overall, the wait time and food is definitely not worth it."
Christianne L.,"Lawrenceville, GA",123,7,2,5.0,10/2/2016,"Every single time my husband and I have come to the Cheesecake Factory, we've had a great meal! We have explored the menu and always order something different, and it always tastes great. The service is top notch, the wait staff is always friendly and helpful, and the wait on food isn't long. We will for sure continue coming back!"
Vanesa V.,"Lawrenceville, GA",98,88,163,5.0,6/6/2016,"This was my 2nd time at this location and I am so impressed. My boyfriend and I came an hour before close and got a table outside. Our server, I can't remember his name, greeted us immediately in a friendly way. He was a greay server. We both knew what we were going to order before we even arrived so we didn't really look over the menu again. We both got the Mac & Cheese burger. My boyfriend has had it before and it was my first time trying it. My boyfriend got his Kobe styled and medium rare. I got mine well done. Literally, their mac & cheese burger is one of the best burgers you will ever have. I'm serious. I have dreams about that burger. I'm currently wishing I had one right now. We ended the night with some cheesecake to go. My boyfriend got strawberry and I got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut. Just like the burger, I have dreams about this cheesecake too. THE BEST cheesecake flavor I've ever had. It's not sweet either, it's perfect. Next time you go to the cheesecake factory I HIGHLY recommend the mac & cheese burger and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert if you haven't tried it yet. I will be back soon for this and to try their avocado egg rolls (I've heard great things about them.)"
Alana H.,"Buford, GA",0,10,,3.0,2/9/2017,"The food is standard...nothing special.  However, what turned me off was the super long wait time.  From standing in front of the hostess, to waiting for our waters, orders, food... took way longer than it should.  Not sure if it was the fault of the waitress or maybe the kitchen as backed up or maybe the restaurant was packed (though it didn't seem like that).. regardless, something needs to be changed"
Sikia D.,"Grovetown, GA",2,1,6,5.0,4/6/2016,Absolutely love this place. Great service! It is always packed but worth the wait. My favorite meal s the Parmesan Herb-Crusted Chicken. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. You will fall in love with it!
Sharon E.,"Dacula, GA",37,147,144,4.0,7/19/2014,"Decided to celebrate my wife's cousin's birthday over here...  It was a great experience. Not sure why this location never showed up since its located right in the center of Mall of Georgia in Buford..  Now I know why.. The address has 3333 instead of 333.. This places is huge.. They have lot of seating.. both indoors and outdoors.. The ambience was also great... For some reason I loved the chairs over there... They were so comfortable.. Now coming to our waiter... Ryan.. He was so nice.. Checked us most of the time.. Food arrived quickly too... Great service... Now to the food.. It was great too.. We ordered the crab cakes as appetizers.. They were so tasty.. Main course we ordered 3 dishes,... Shepherd's pie, Jamaican Pepper shrimp and Moroccan shrimp.. All of them tasted really good.. The portions were pretty good.. For desert we ordered the marsh mellow cheese cake.. That also tasted good as expected..    WIll be back again over here.."
