Jonathan P.,"Hanscom Air Force Base, MA",0,4,,5.0,12/31/2017,"Phenomenal! I have never sent food back but my steak was over cooked, not only did the waitress immediately and respectfully replace my meal she offered me a salad while I waited. Then the manager came over to personally apologize. This, mind you, was all during a lunch rush.  This has always been our go-to for snowy days, but now how could I go to another Cheesecake Factory?!? 5-stars!!!"
Alexandra C.,"Boston, MA",559,715,734,2.0,12/27/2017,"Using a Christmas gift card helped. If I had been paying for this meal out of my own pocket, I would have been disappointed.  Firstly, prepare to wait at all times of the day. We were quoted a twenty minute wait at 4 PM and there were plenty of empty tables. The hostesses are rude too. My buzzer went off and she grabbed it and said ""stand over there"" while flailing her arm to the left. Um where? I had to ask someone else because she avoided me after that. We were seated and then forgotten about for over ten minutes. The people next to us got drinks, bread, and made an appetizer order before we even met our waitress. Our bread came out five minutes before our food. Great. Then the waitress we never saw said goodbye and was swapped for another waitress we never saw. I was surprised to see that they have some breakfast all day selections, one of my favorite things in the whole world.  What we got: Farm Fresh Eggs ($7.95)- This was two eggs served with an English muffin and your choice of potatoes or tomatoes. I chose tomatoes. It was good and I didn't feel disgustingly full after I ate it. Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($17.95)- This was parmesan-encrusted chicken served over pasta, peppers, onions, and mushrooms with Spicy New Orleans Sauce. I tried the pasta and it was good, although they gave him five pieces of chicken and a tiny bit of pasta. He's a big guy and he said that was way too much chicken for him; he would have preferred more pasta than the little serving he got rather than wasting all that chicken. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ($8.95)- Ugh, I was expecting greatness and this missed the mark. This cheesecake was hard and the cookie dough layer in the middle was rock hard. I had my spoon and I was pushing down with all my might to go through the slice and get a bite and I couldn't do it. He had to take a knife and slice it in half so I could even try to get a bite. It was almost as if the slice had been in the freezer and it hadn't be able to thaw long enough. Huge disappointment. And for a piece of cake that was priced higher than my meal. Go figure. Forty dollars and some change for mediocre food and lackluster service. It was a typical chain restaurant experience. I won't be back."
Brenley S.,"Warwick, RI",205,6,,3.0,8/3/2017,"burlington mall is the halfway point for my best friend and i, who lives in maine. so clearly this isn't our usual location. i had a gift card and coincidentally, it was national cheesecake day or something. this review has nothing to do with the wait time for the cheesecake though as that is completely understandable. we had a SUPER friendly server. i don't want to drop her name in here and expose her for the world to see, but she was super friendly, and relatable, and quirky. she did help me with the menu and she was super nice.  i ordered the guac made-to-order app for myself as well as the taquito small plate... but i ended up only eating one of my taquitos and wanted to box the rest.  she didn't box the taquitos, salsa, or sour cream. just the guac. i was  shoooook.  i basically wasted my money lol"
Leena P.,"Lowell, MA",3,5,2,1.0,1/8/2018,"BUG IN MY DRINK  After receiving our appetizer, It took a whole 45 minutes until we received our food. By that time, our appetites were gone and the food was not hot. The best part was finding a FRUIT FLY inside my boyfriends strawberry lemonade. After informing the waitress she quickly brought it over to her manager without an apology. The manager, a middle aged Asian women came over to apologize and asked if we would like a cup to go..... I was SHOCKED. She said no more after I declined and never once came back to check up on us. The $3 drink was taken off the bill. Considering the fact that there was a bug with WINGS inside our drink and the only thing done was take It off the bill with a petty apology was beyond me. I will never come back to this establishment. Im afraid of what I might see in my food so PLEASE CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE CONSUMING."
Ellen Y.,"Boston, MA",187,178,39,3.0,1/5/2018,"We came in at 9pm on a Friday night and only ordered cheesecake to go. There was no line when ordering, but man this took forever. I don't understand how it takes more than 15 minutes to put cheesecake in a box. If the cheesecake wasn't so good I wouldn't come back, but the cheesecake is so damn good."
Luana F.,"Westminster, CA",573,72,169,5.0,12/19/2017,"Never have any issues when I come here. Of course it's usually a long wait especially on the weekends but I don't mind! The brunch menu and food are sooooo goood! I am still trying a lot of their menu options but it's hard since I sometimes want to get the same thing over and over again. My favorites are buffalo blast (app) (HUGE) Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Belagio, Thai lettuce wrap and the bacon bacon burger !! Those are some of my faves. And as if this visit I have two new favorites. Avocado Eggrolls and the herb crusted filet of salmon! So amazing. Our waitress was really nice I'm not sure why people complain about a big menu. Everything is so good you can't go wrong."
Domenico Domenic Chelmsford G.,"Chelmsford, MA",126,64,1,3.0,12/27/2017,I used to love this place.... They don't take reservations.  There is seating in bar area. You  are quoted a twenty minute wait but it can be an hour.  What perplexes me  is there are always plenty of empty tables. The staf f is average at best.  I often get their Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  They give you a lot of chicken.  It's actually a good meal to split with an extra side of pasta and some side salads. The cheesecake was good but took it to go.
Lauren H.,"Arlington, MA",0,42,4,2.0,10/7/2017,"I just got home from picking up take out from this location tonight and cannot believe I paid $17.95 for the steak medallions! Literally, three, very SMALL pieces of steak were in this meal. Definitely not enough food for a grown, male adult. My fiancé was still hungry after eating it. Initially when I called to place my order, I asked them if they had steak tips and told me this dish was the closet thing to it. So, I went with their recommendation and ordered it. Little did I know, I was going to get ripped off.  Additionally, they previously forgot to package our cheesecakes and I had to wait a week to be sent a gift card for reimbursement.   Becoming very disappointed with the quality and prices of this establishment."
Adam M.,"Nashua, NH",225,206,268,3.0,12/20/2017,"If you've been to one  Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  The menu is consistent and the preparation is formulaic.  Its always good and filling, but borderline on value.  The main issue is the seating.  The host desk can best be described as ""Town square in during hurricane with an earthquake thrown in for fun""  It's a mass of confusion and chaos.  I honestly think you could walk in and sit down and NOBODY would notice."
Cara M.,"Suffield, CT",67,71,50,3.0,5/25/2017,"Visited the Cheesecake factory with my mom and future sisters-in-law. It was a very busy lunchtime and took a while for our drink orders to come around.  I got the chipotle chicken pasta and was really disappointed with the three small diced pieces of chicken that were in the whole dish. What chicken was there was spicy and well-deserved, but for a 12.95 lunch order, I was disappointed!  Bathrooms were very clean. Decor is the same as the rest of the Cheesecake chain, which I don't really understand, but I guess I don't have to!  I'm sure I'll be back to another Cheesecake Factory, I just hope to have a better dish!"
Lila S.,"Hubbardston, MA",252,422,277,3.0,5/10/2017,"What hasn't been said about Cheesecake Factory: Slow Slow Slow Service - No matter what location, or what time of day, its either packed and understaffed or dead and grossly understaffed.  The menu is large., .. too large overwhelming and for newbies can be a challenge to pick one thing.  Some items are misleading and mediocre - Example - Cajun Pasta claims to have a rich sauce - its thin, and buttery/oily and not very spicy.  The Shepards pie is... just NOT shepherds pie..  Portions and sides used to be larger and more exciting.?( no more wasabi mashed potatoes )  Quality of the food- Good but has been better The best feature is a small take home, already frozen PLAIN cheesecake with strawberries. They get too melty to take home in slices or fresh. Frozen is just perfect and the smaller one ($50) is more densely loaded with crumb topping. The drinks are good but so lightly prepared its not worth the $12 for a mai tai or long island. ..  It looks beautiful but the decor is so all over the place in theme and texture it can be nauseating (though I do love the wicker chairs outside) and the lighting inside at night is so so so dim I have to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. Yes I'll be back I'm just in no rush. Better cheesecakes abound."
Rebecca A.,"Lisbon, ME",199,372,1193,5.0,9/28/2016,"This was an excellent experience. After beign greeted warmly, we waited for about 30 minutes. We were then seated and drink orders placed and fresh complimentary bread was served. The service was fabulous. He friendly, engaging and attentive  and answered allll the questiosn we asked. We order the buffalo chicken blasts as an app. These were tasty and slightly spicy, deep fried bites.  Then came the lousiana style chicken and pasta dish. parmesan crusted chicken, with crunchy exterioer and moist meat. The bow tie spicy has a spicy cream sauce that really hit the spot, a definate comfort food. And of course, the cheescake. The dutch apple pie cheescake was fantastic. It was sweet and soft and bursting with fresh apples and spices"
John T.,"Somerville, MA",161,275,714,3.0,2/12/2017,"Went for lunch. The place was really busy. We got the nachos for an app. They were really good. Next burgers, they were good. Just took a really long time for the food to come out. Whatever really busy I guess."
Rose R.,"Methuen, MA",21,29,28,4.0,8/2/2017,Got to the restaurant 55 minutes prior to closing and was still treated as if I got there during the day...never been to this location and it was pretty good. Waitress was nice and food was bomb! Although the only thing is the drinks here they barely put alcohol in it and wayyyyy to much ice.
Megan M.,"Charlestown, Boston, MA",98,3,,2.0,7/19/2017,"The menu is way too extensive and overwhelming, that the wait staff doesn't know how to describe dishes because they are unfamiliar with the products. When I asked for a new knife (it was smudged and sticky), it took them 20 minutes and two requests. These encounters happened throughout my meal.  About a quarter of their items on the menu aren't even in stock. I went to this location about 3 months ago and they didn't have the Tuna Tartare. I went again yesterday and they still didn't restock the item because ""fish prices went up"". If things aren't in stock, take it off your menu!!  The wait is usually about a half an hour, and the waiting area is very disorganized and dysfunctional. How hard is it to invest in some buzzers for patrons to hold while waiting? The food was average, and decently overpriced. If you're looking for a good place to have a quiet conversation and attentive wait staff, skip this location."
Sarika G.,"ROXBURY CROSSING, MA",2,7,72,4.0,6/26/2017,"This was my first ever visit to a Cheesecake Factory for a meal. The experience was quite great. They don't do reservations but we didn't have to wait to be seated. They have outdoor seating as well. Our server was polite and nice. We ordered Chicken Lettuce Wrap (Mexican), Eggplant Parmesan and White Chicken Chilli. All of the dishes were great and I really liked the White Chicken Chilli in particular. My first experience was great and I am glad that the dishes I chose turned out to be great. I am going there again..."
Geoff B.,"Waltham, MA",38,58,12,4.0,9/18/2017,"Pretty solid spot. This location is nothing out of the ordinary for cheesecake factory so by me reviewing this one I'm basically reviewing all of the locations I've been to. It's an middle to upper tier restaurant that delivers a pretty good experience. Obviously the cheesecake is great and I enjoy most of the flavors. This particular location is really busy all of the time and you may experience lengthy waits and they don't allow reservations. The drinks here are really good I would recommend that you try them all!! No seriously, work your way down the drink menu and you will not be disappointed. All in all I would recommend this to anyone but cannot give it 5 stars because that would mean it is perfect."
Max C.,"Burlington, MA",0,3,,4.0,10/29/2017,Great food. The service is awesome. The atmosphere there is great. It is connected to the Burlington mall.
Lisa Y.,"Clinton, MA",57,48,30,3.0,6/4/2017,"It's a chain type restaurant so I didn't really expect anything great. The waitress forgot us multiple times and it took forever to get drinks. The wait for food was even longer and then they ""forgot ""to make the spaghetti for my daughters chicken parm. Everything came out separately with no rhyme or reason and some of the dishes had stuff on them that was cold and clearly had been waiting for other things. I'd recommend getting to go or just finding someplace else that's comparable in price because it's not worth what you pay for mediocre service/food!"
Doug M.,"Billerica, MA",0,46,,3.0,10/24/2017,Not bad but also allot of hype about average food. The drinks are a bit small and over priced but the service is good. If you are at the mall and want a interesting menu with good service and want to drop $40 min per person this could be the place for you. To quote my generation yuppie crowd!
Addie M.,"North Chelmsford, MA",114,221,107,2.0,11/6/2016,"Came in at five, was told 20-30 minute wait. Got sat five minutes after six. Our server Shelly was neglectful the whole night. Forgot my water and my friends root beer. Our main course came in the middle of all of us eating our appetizers which was super annoying. Ordered a rare steak, it came medium well. We sat for over a half an hour while we waited for a dessert menu. But of course she was quick and prompt when we needed our bill. It's a bummer because normally this place is great."
Yang T.,"Burlington, MA",0,5,,3.0,12/15/2017,"I typically have good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory. Other than the wait time, the actual service was fairly quick and courteous. I always enjoy my meals here."
Molyda C.,"Lowell, MA",5,27,41,5.0,4/6/2017,"This was my first time at any Cheesecake Factory and I had a wonderful experience. The food was better than expected. I will order the same pasta again, because it was absolutely tasty. There's also a large variety of Cheesecake to choose from. Trying a new desert next time is a must! I also loved the friendliness among the staff. They were responsible and kind. The atmosphere was beautiful as well. I will most definitely come to this location again! Five stars!"
Alexia C.,"Medford, MA",14,7,,3.0,9/28/2017,"The menu is extensive but they really don't have much for those with allergies.  Nothing is worse than going to a major chain restaurant and having half the menu be off limits because they are frying French fries and chicken wings in the same oil as the fish and shrimp :-(.  I mean, they definitely make enough money to cook the seafood separately..."
J B.,"Nashua, NH",0,7,2,1.0,6/16/2017,"The Good:  Arrived at 4:30 for early dinner and were seated immediately.  The Food:  Three out of four dishes were reported as very good.  The fourth had obviously completed it's cooking process early and ""waited"" for the rest of the order as it had cooled to room temp when served - very disappointing.   The Bad:  Due to our early arrival, the place was very quiet. With that, our food took exceptionally long to reach the table after ordering.  Additionally, upon arrival, I had not entirely settled into my seat and noticed one of my Forks was coated with food debris.  My wife also noticed her knife was filthy dirty. The waitress was quick to replace our utensils with much apology.  Unfortunately this was not the last issue with silverware; with arrival of desert, my wife immediately dropped her spoon realizing it too was caked with leftover, hardened food - we grabbed a pic of it this time. A discussion with the Manager yielded a free piece of cheesecake.  Exiting the restaurant, we all wondered just how clean the rest of the silverware actually was - so far no illness but this drops my review to one-star without hesitation. Conclusion:  I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and they have been great experiences.  Late and cold food, coupled with highly suspect cleanliness makes me seriously question whether I'll revisit this location."
Amy K.,"Moretown, VT",43,221,604,1.0,5/25/2016,"Bistro Shrimp Pasta for take out was terrible. The dish was filled with oil that was pooling at the bottom of the takeout container. The shrimp was super dry - texture was not fresh shrimp, nor thawed frozen shrimp... Just super dehydrated tough shrimp. The menu mentioned artichoke, but there were not visible bits of artichoke. Skip this dish unless you are eating in and can send it back, if it's like this as well."
Jenni F.,"Arlington, MA",48,56,,1.0,11/2/2017,"Cheesecake Factory!! What a disappointment. Food was just awful! Steak needs to be removed off menu if your going to serve ""shoe leather"". Tap water needs to be cold not warm. Service with a smile goes a long way and clean utensils would be nice!! What happened to this place!!"
Cheryl D.,"Medford, MA",0,25,3,3.0,6/14/2017,This place always has a wait   It's always crazy busy.  Tip go to Cambridge so much better.   Food is consistent drinks are good  lemon meringue cheesecake is to die for.
Local L.,"Belmont, MA",0,17,11,5.0,8/25/2017,"Let me start by saying the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Having dined at the CCF over 100 times in my life experiencing various locations... the Burlington mall is the best in this state. You can expect wait times up towards 2 hours on the busiest of weekend times. Don't come around 6-7. Recommend the buffalo blasts, Caesar salad and mushroom burger. Orange chicken & steak Diane are other worthy choices."
Bharadwaj S.,"Chelmsford, MA",76,11,6,5.0,4/7/2017,Lengthy menu but perfect food- My fav. Picks 1.Chicken Romano 2. Pineapple chicken and shrimp 3. Jamaican meal 4. Bow tie pasta with chicken  5. Turkey burger 6. Obviously cheesecake--all the flavors
Mrs. C.,"Dracut, MA",0,62,,3.0,6/12/2017,"Took Beaver for lunch after hearing good things about this place from friends.  PRO-Got there early & the place was dead, so we got seated right away. Yes, the menu is giant. Beaver got the chicken parm sandwich, Ward got the pineapple chicken & shrimp & a glass of wine. Both liked their food. Beav & I stuck to Lemonade, which came with a nice sugar rim on the glass. Danny, our waiter was very nice & brought out good crusty bread. The boys packed up their extra food & each of them got a cheesecake piece for dessert later packed to go. CON-My shrimp scampi was unusual & not in a good way. Came with five decent sized but kinda mushy shrimp displayed on the sides of the giant plate with a scoop of angel hair pasta in the middle. There were whole roasted cloves of garlic scattered around & some (I think) candied pecans(?) in the sauce that gave a weirdly sweet taste to the whole dish. I had to ask for some lemon slices to give it any kind of lemon taste. I ate it, but wouldn't order it again. The place is decorated with that ""Old Italian Church Fresco Ceiling"" look, cheesy for sure. SO-I guess two outta three ain't bad, the boys liked it, but I won't be voting to go back anytime soon. Lunch was $93 before tip.Yikes! I totally don't get all the raves for this place. Mediocre sums it up for me in one word."
Corey L.,"Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA",57,753,8,3.0,7/7/2016,"We stopped in on a Saturday for lunch at the bar. Bar tender was great. The food was all solid, like always, though for the price would like more. We've had the bang bang chicken/shrimp, fresh country salad, and tuna tateki salad: all were solid.  Bread and butter that come complementary are always excellent - I think the butter is made of sugar love. The cheesecakes are so rich and luscious. LOVE THEM!"
Laryssa V.,"Waltham, MA",0,7,5,5.0,9/27/2017,"I have been to this restaurant many times in the past but last night was probably the best time I've gone. Went in around 7:30 pm and was seated right away. Our waiter Simos was extremely efficient and friendly! My boyfriend and I both had the Chicken Piccata which was delicious, but the chicken to pasta ratio was not what I had in the past. There was little pasta and three big pieces of chicken, it was still great though! Also, the Whiskey Smash drink was good, the second one was a bit sweeter that the first. Overall it was a great experience."
Justin L.,"Medford, MA",1,16,9,2.0,8/20/2017,"I'm writing this cause we are still waiting for a table . They said 30mins wait , it's been 55mins .  The manager came and then we were finally being seated ,and then we wait forever for the food too .We are starving with kids ,So bad ."
Paul S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,1.0,11/2/2017,"Why do you ask me to go to your Corporate page to put in my information so you can contact me??? When you have NEVER contacted me??? To me, Corporate is worse than the restaurant. Why ask for information when you have no intention of contacting the person???"
Mike M.,"Burlington, MA",28,13,,3.0,11/30/2016,"Almost had a coronary due to the high saturated fat content, I could feel my heart clenching, I broke out into a cold sweat and it felt like I had a stomach full if cement.  This was when I opened the menu, I had yet to try the food. Calorie counting and slim waistlines take a backseat to deep fried and over sauced selections from around the globe.  The voluminous menu makes certain there's a selection (usually multiple)  for every taste.  I made the mistake of checking nutritional data prior to my arrival and if i were to indulge I'd have to shame myself in the same manner you criticize someone who smokes while reading the box that's informing them they're killing themselves by using this product.  Remedial calculations for an app, average meal and the obvious need for a cheesecake slice to bookend my experience put my calories around 5500.   I'd assume I'd need the assistance of NASA to determine how many sit-ups I'd need to do to work off the calories in a bistro shrimp pasta.  I had a diet coke and split.  The soda was ice cold and satisfactory. No medicinal phenolic taste you generally get from some fountain beverages."
Julie R.,"Burlington, MA",0,22,6,5.0,1/24/2017,"Huge menu selection Great ""skinny"" menu Large portions I can ALWAYS count on a good meal from here...and of course excellent dessert."
Alex K.,"Arlington, MA",15,78,106,2.0,9/10/2017,"I believe the TCF can be yummy and have big portions and stuff.  However, this did not happen to me.  The menu was big, but not my food.  I went there with GF on a Friday night.  It was wicked packed and wait was like an hour so we looked around the mall.  We got seated -SUPER loud and chaotic in there -everything from toddlers to ""old people"" to white trash to intellectuals.  Waitress took a while (long time) to show up.  Nice gal -no worries.  I got the chicken enchilada plato -I am a real pig and was aching for this giant and tasty dish.  When this pathetic dish came out it was a teenie, inch-deep layer of canned black beans and rice with two squashed-down, janky enchiladas with dried up ""melted"" cheese.  The once salsa was all separated and soaked into the tortilla.  I am 100% sure this had to have been an unclaimed dish from God knows when.  It had been stuck in a fridge and covered and stuff piled on top -hence the squashedness. Sorry no picture!  But trust me.  It was sad.  I could tell it had been nuked -cold in some parts and luke warm in others. I do not doubt TCF might be real yummy and awesome stoner food but mine was awful... Sorry!"
Milia M.,"Boston, MA",3,41,6,1.0,12/6/2016,Problem with their phone lines and luck of professional stuff!! Ok so this is my 4 th time calling them for order to go. They couldn't connect the lines! At last I was transferred and woman when complained she couldn't hear me when all my reception was 5 bars. Then she could not understand when I asked her question about meat. What a waste of time. Please train the staff to know the phones and the menu!!
Magali M.,"Tampa, FL",6,4,1,1.0,9/29/2017,Service was terrible changed server and the original server was in other tables .. when the food finally arrived it was cold .. first cheesecake factory that we receive bad service .. and we travel quite frequently and its a chain that we usually trust but not this time
