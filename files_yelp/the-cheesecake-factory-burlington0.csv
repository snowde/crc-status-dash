michele h.,"Natick, MA",15,59,,4.0,2/22/2012,"Once again, I feel like I'm in a time warp.... I haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory since a company Christmas party in 2003.   Last Monday, after shopping in Nashua, New Hampshire all day, The Boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner.  We started the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip which I thought was good but not really my cup of tea.  The Boyfriend is a seafood-aholic so whenever we go out, he orders seafood and as much of it as he can eat. I thought the toast points that came with it where too buttery/greasy for the dip and their white bread in the bread basket was a better compliment to the dip. The Boyfriend had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo with Brown Rice.  He loved it and ate every drop of it.  I tasted it and it was really good, complex and spicy. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.  I know it might seem strange but I almost always order a meal size salad here or the Thai Chicken Pasta.  They make the best giant salads filled with tons of great ingredients and chopped lettuces.  I loved this one. It was filled with tons of chicken, great tasting black beans, wonderful corn, fresh avocado and fresh tomatoes. And I can never even finish half of their salads so I get a yummy lunch the next day (I actually love the wilted lettuce the next day). The Boyfriend is not a big cheesecake fan and I was stuffed so we got a piece of Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake to go.  It was perfect, heavenly and decadent. But I admit to being horrified that they charge $6.95 for a piece of cheesecake now! I could and can bake an entire cheesecake for probably the same cost!  Anyway, it was good to eat here again and I'm sure The Boyfriend and I will venture here again."
Rafaela S.,"San Francisco, CA",41,60,105,5.0,9/22/2011,"I love love love this place! Came here to celebrate my 18th birthday a couple years back.. I always get the same thing, this grilled chicken salad with cashews (I forget the name), but it's amazing. The only problem I have had here is that the wait can be very long, but it it is usually worth the wait! p.s. their red velvet cheesecake is the best!"
Jean B.,"Watertown, MA",4,13,,3.0,4/8/2014,"If you haven't been to the cheesecake factory it's worth a trip for the cheesecake alone.  The variety of cheesecakes available is unmatched anywhere I've ever been.  The menu is a bit of a bear to get thru, ads everywhere and It's the length of a novel, but the food is usually quite good.  The wait at this location is often rather long, so come prepared to wait.  The service is really quite variable dependant on your server.  Overall I'd say it's worth a visit if you're in the area, but I would not go out of my way to come to Cheesecake Factory."
Mike A.,"Pepperell, MA",5,43,1,4.0,12/7/2013,"This will always be one of my favorite restaurants, I have never had a bad meal or bad experience. Only reason I am give it four starts and not five is because you literally can't go to this place without waiting forever for a table. Booooo"
T S.,"Boston, MA",0,10,1,1.0,3/6/2014,"Worst brunch ever! Plates and glasses were dirty.  Tip to CF...clean your dishwasher filter. Despite arriving at 10:00am and the restaurant being nearly empty, our server was non-existent.  Each of the four brunch entrees arrived separately and several minutes apart.  One member of our party ordered pancakes and when they arrived was told ""the syrup will be out shortly, we have to heat it up because it was so cold"".  By the time the syrup was brought out ( nearly ten minutes later) the pancakes were cold.  The rest of the food was unimpressive.  The poached eggs were overcooked and cold.  I suspect they are pre-cooked and reheated.  The home fries were burnt.  By the time the waiter checked back with us we were almost done.  Then he disappeared and we waited and waited to get our check.   I have always loved Cheesecake Factory but I will stay away from this location.  Definitely not the place for brunch."

Michela M.,"Malden, MA",2,13,,2.0,7/17/2014,"Dined on 7/15/2014. I am a waitress myself so I am always cautious of myself and my family members to be ""Polite"" and not do things to other servers that would be irritating to myself :) . so when I tell you  this experience was ridiculous I mean it was RIDICULOUS. WE sat down in the lounge (did not ask for it, but was fine with it) I  was joined by my mother and my grandmother. We usually come every 2 weeks to catch up and have lunch. Waitress came over introduced hereself, took our drink order, brought bread fine. no complaints. She came back asked if we wanted an appitizer (I was at a Cheesecake Factory in Florida about a month ago and they did a 4-6 happy hour, so I asked) Do you guys do happy hour here? and her response was ""I dont know what time is it?"" I looked at her, and said ""I don't know the exact time?"" (WAS THAT THE QUESTION? my grandmother said 4:12, she said ""then I guess we do, but if you were sitting in the dining room we would not give it to you, only in the lounge."" OK GREAT THANKS? .. I said ""well since we are sitting in the lounge, do you think we could do it?"" She said ""Yup I'll get you the menu, did you know about our little secret?"" I said ""what secret?"" ""she said happy hour?"" I said ""Well apparently not since I just asked you about it"" she brought the menu told us she would give us a few minutes.  She came back, I was thinking of ordering the Tuna tempura rolls. She asked if we had any questions, I said yes, ""What is Nori?"" She said ""I don't know...."" I said ""Oh, Okay"" She said ""Why is it on the Menu? I have  worked her for 9 years and have never heard of it."" My grandmother said - it is the seaweed the Sushi is rolled in. Well the waitress HAD to make it known again, she's worked here 9 years and has never been asked and she knows EVERYTHING. OK great it's fine you didn't know it, it's a big menu relax. We order, buffalo blasts (amazing) Tuna tempura, 2 small salads, and said everything would be fine to come out together. 5 minutes later the two salads came up, she put them down and said ""well they were ready, is it okay if I put them down?"" - were we supposed to say no?. She puts them down, I did not get a salad so I had nothing, does not really bother me. couple minutes later, The Tuna roll comes up. Presentation was beautiful. Again she mentions the Nori and shows me where it is in the  roll, yup thank I get it. I should have read the menu, i know Tempura means fried, but I was expecting the Sushi to be a little more on the raw side then fully cooked and did not like it (Not anyone's fault, just was not for me!) She came over and i told her not to worry It just  wasn't for me, she says ""Oh yeah, you just must not know a lot about Sushi."" ........ NOPE, I do thanks, i just did not expect it to be cooked and do not like it. 15 minutes into the meal still no buffalo blasts, and we were not in a rush at all so we did not notice. The manager came over which was VERY nice apologized and said they would be right out and acknowledged they were taking a long time. 5 minutes later a food runner brings them out. we start eating them (mainly myself since I did not end up having a meal), waitress comes over tops 3 minutes later with the dessert menu and immedietly starts talking about cheesecake, and is staring at us. ""Is anyone interested?"" .. well probably not, since the last of our meal JUST came out. She says ""I'll leave the menu for you."" we continue eating, she comes back about 10 minutes later, which was fine, but asks us again- can we digest or? My grandmother gives her the food and says you can just wrap it. Wraps it brings it back, asks if we want Coffee, we order 2 cups. My mom was outside, we said she might want something shell be back in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she comes back with anothe waitress to let us know it's shift change and she will be taking over from there. IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, she asks the other waitress if she knows what Nori is, the waitress did. ARE YOU KDIDING ME, let it go lady we could have cared less if you know what it is, get over it. Was pretty obvious why she wanted to rush the cheesecake because it was time to go home. and noting to your customers that it is ""shift change"" is the tackiest of tacky. I love the cheesecake factory and have had too many good experiences to say I would not go back, but it baffles me how some people maintain a job for several years with this odd, rude, behavior."
Jennifer C.,"North Andover, MA",49,35,,2.0,9/29/2011,"My mom, 2 year old daughter and I were shopping a few weeks ago at the mall.  We were ready to have some lunch and decided to stop at the Cheesecake factory.   After entering the restaurant we were sat quickly and the gentleman who brought us to our table got my daughter a children's platter of bread and bananas.   We sat there for nearly 15 minutes with no one coming to take our order.  My daughter started to get restless and my mom asked another staff member who our server was and they didn't know.  As my daughter got more restless I needed to take her out of the restaurant and my mom went to the front desk to tell them we were leaving.   They manager was extremely apologetic and offered to have us served righ then, but it was too late.  We needed to go.  I will probably go there again, but I was really disappointed with the fact that they were so disorganized and that the server didn't know we were even seated"
Alex G.,"Stamford, CT",2,8,,4.0,11/10/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty typical of Cheesecake Factory's in terms of layout - it's a nice-looking layout, though a bit dark inside.  I used to come here on a weekly basis, because I would stop by after a mall trip. Though convenient to mall-goers, this can be a huge downfall to those who wish to just go out to dinner, because this particular location gets so crowded! They DO NOT take call ahead seating, which means that you just have to go there and wait... Additionally, by being attached to the mall, it attracts more young kids, crying babies in strollers, and other stragglers, if you will (I figured I'd mention, since some people care about this!) Their waitstaff is usually pretty good - obviously some are better than others, and the place is usually crazy busy, so you can't always expect the best. Generally attentive and friendly. When we were going there frequently, we had a set of waiters that we would request - they were exceptional! Now on to the food... I've had a number of dishes here (all great - huge - portion sizes and I generally do not order appetizers). Here are some of my favorites: 1) Crispy spicy beef: a yummy dish, medium spice level, and yes, it is crunchy, not soggy. I enjoy this entree, a lot. 2) Renee's special: though you have a couple choices for this one, I usually get the soup of the day, a Caesar salad - great dressing but VERY garlicky, so be careful if you're on a first date/care about your breath post meal, and a chicken salad sandwich. For the price, this meal is a great value and great for your taste buds, and definitely does not leave you hungry.  3) Another favorite of mine is (I forget the name) one of the pastas. It has farfalle (bow tie) pasta, sun dried tomatoes, chicken, peas, mushrooms... And it is amazing. When in doubt of what to order at this place, get a pasta!! Though this pasta is my go-to, I've had others and they're always very flavorful and chock-full of ingredients. Their pasta is not homemade, or at least it doesn't seem it, but this is the only downfall here. Again, portions are huge.  For dessert, I've only had cheesecake - it's good stuff, very rich. They offer a huge selection of flavors, so happy choosing!"
Katie S.,"Oakdale, PA",64,98,1,1.0,10/2/2012,"I went there with a huge group of people for a birthday dinner and we called ahead mutliple times to warn them that there was going to be ten people and she ensured we would only need to wait about a half hour which we were fine with. Get there and the lady has no idea what we are talking about and waited for almost two hours. Finally being sat and we ordered food. I was pretty excited and ready to eat anything on the menu because I was starving. Long story short, got food poisoning. Will never return, not just this one but any of them."
Julie B.,"Boston, MA",23,193,19,2.0,1/31/2011,"45 minute wait to sit in a super dark booth with Taio Cruz blasting. What do you think this is? Bungalow 8??? Despite hindering any dinner-time conversation, the music gave me a headache and is now making me sound like I'm 75. However, the noise really ruins the dinner mood. Wouldn't you say? Anyways, our appetizer came before our drinks (weird.) All in all everything came out quickly, but I really think the Cheesecake Factory is dropping in quality. It's becoming much more like Chilis than CF. The only difference is that the service was impeccable."
Maria V.,"Boston, MA",129,338,14,2.0,1/6/2011,"Note: For fun, take someone who has never been to America before--you know, a relative from another continent who basically just landed a few days ago.  When you bring them here, watch their eyes fall out of their head when they see how giant the portions are. Guaranteed hilarity."
Kristen K.,"Bedford, MA",16,18,,2.0,7/7/2011,"I like that this restaurant is open late, serves a wide variety of food, and their offerings are usually tasty (though overpriced). I didn't like biting into a piece of plastic in my food.  Certainly it was an accident, but I just haven't felt like going back since."
Jackie H.,"Franconia, NH",0,9,4,3.0,9/18/2013,"The drinks were very good as were the $5 nachos you can get in the bar section between five and seven I think. However, the dynamite shrimp was very underwhelming and my pretzel crusted chicken was burnt. Service was so so. Our waitress for the first half was kind of cold to us, but halfway through dinner she went on break and we got someone much nicer."
Lisa M.,"Arlington, MA",34,95,10,5.0,7/31/2010,"All right, people, I don't doubt that the wait at a regular mealtime is frustrating... however, there's a reason for that:  The food really is quite good.  Let me preface this by saying that if I still lived in the Central West End of St. Louis, I probably would have given 4 stars.  But the description of 5 stars (""as good as it gets"") is right on now that we live in Arlington, MA (sorry people, but this is a really white 'burb with hit-or-miss restaurants).  Their menu is gigantic - as in, over 200 menu items - and so there *are* things on it that are less than fabulous.  Usually though, those things are still good.  Here are a few of the greats: - Chicken Enchiladas.  This is a new item on the ""special menu.""  I just had it last night.  As someone who orders enchiladas pretty much everywhere, these were awesome.  And they were better than what I had at Zocalo (although admittedly Zocalo gave me beef and I had ordered chicken - and Zocalo's were still good).  They had a very nice tang, plenty of sauce and cheese, and the black beans and cilantro rice were perfect compliments.  I highly recommend and hope this will be a standard menu item in the future. - The endive salad with glazed pecans and blue cheese (under ""small plates"").  It sounds plain ... but it's awesome.  Try it.  You'll want to move to France or Belgium (for endives).  I've watched friends order and love their other salads as well (thai noodle, French country, factory chopped etc.). - The chicken madeira (their ""most popular chicken dish"") is excellent.  And yields plenty of leftovers. - The four cheese pasta is exactly what you want to order when you want a little marinara to break up a lot of awesome cheese. - The cheesecake.  Even the negative reviewers below don't attempt to deny that it's phenomenal.  Often I'll just order a plain, traditional slice, because I'm in the mood for pure, unadulterated cheesy sweet goodness.  If you're looking for greater adventure: - The new Reeses Peanut Butter and Chocolate is TO DIE FOR.  I thought in ordering it that it might be too much - too sweet, too much.  Uh, no.  This was perfection in my mouth.  I couldn't eat it all in one setting, but that wasn't because it was ""too"" anything other than maybe too big a slice.  If there are chocolate-peanut butter lovers out there who aren't trying this, that constitutes tragedy in my book. - If you're in a chocolate mood, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake (which is part flourless Godiva chocolate cake, part chocolate mousse, part chocolate cheesecake) is heavenly. - I've heard that the Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for, and it's next on my list to try. - The fresh banana cheesecake has been decent in the past. - I would try one of the above before straying, because although they're all awesome, the above are phenomenal. When I'm too full for cheesecake sometimes I order the Goblet of Fresh Strawberries (served with a dish of whipped cream)... but I still get a slice to go."
Ms. Review S.,"Salisbury, MA",23,294,16,3.0,2/13/2011,"You know the meal was good when you're still full four hours after the fact! My meal, the spinach, mushroom, bacon, and cheese omelet was a two.  Here's why - the dozen or so eggs used to make this thing took over.  There was a little bit of mushrooms, a dab of spinach, a sprinkle of bacon, and cheese... where was the cheese!?  I think there was a tablespoon of cheese in the gargantuan sized omelet.  I like my omelet to be stuffed, cheese, and memorable.  This was not.  Although, I will remember to never order it again. My sister, who was conveniently seated to my right, ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes.  The plate didn't have the most beautiful presentation (three pancakes stacked high with some mushy strawberries and powdered sugar).  But, those pancakes, ohhhh those pancakes, were AMAZING.  Every time she turned her head, I grabbed a bite of those most delicious pancakes.  I am determined to find the recipe for these things.  Service was OK.  We thought our server abandoned us after he went missing for 15 minutes.  He had actually spilled our drinks, oh well, shit happens. Mimosas were $7.50, seemed a little steep, and the midday drinking resulted in a mid-afternoon nap for me. I have the remainder of a chunk of chocolate coconut cheesecake to devour for dinner, if I get hungry.  I really hope I get hungry...."
A O.,"Wellesley, MA",4,35,7,2.0,7/24/2011,"Went to the Cheesecake factory for brunch today .  I was expecting a more varied menu .  The Brunch Menu is heavy on omlettes, breakfast sandwiches and no lunch items. Doesnt brunch usually include a little breakfast and a little lunch? They have two pancake choices,and a belgian waffle. That is it.  I ordered the belgian waffle which seemed very dry to me.  I opted OUT of the strawberrys, pecans and chantilly cream. They cost extra and I am not paying 3 additional dollars for fruit and nuts. So I ate my waffle with syrup and it was ok. Mimosas were decent, but small.  Really, I love the cheesecake at this place, and that is what I should have ordered.. The brunch would have been better with more selection."
John L.,"Lowell, MA",325,1172,86,2.0,7/15/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory is particularly bad with the wait (well, they all are).  Why are there so many frackin' people trying to get into this place?  Is it the cheesecake?  The fact that there aren't that many restaurants in the Burlington Mall?  That it's in the Burlington Mall? The menu at this one in particular kind of reminds me of Boston Magazine, except I'm paying a lot more and there isn't some remotely interesting article on some Boston society-type.  It's full of advertisements for stuff I neither can afford nor need, and also some food.  If I wanted to read lots of ads with my menu, I'd bring a magazine with me to the restaurant.  I don't need it in my menu. As for the food, do they think we need portions that size?  I mean, it's not terrible food, but there's way too much.  I never seem to be able to get to the aforementioned cheesecake.   And service, despite the ridiculously long wait times, isn't terrible.  So they have that going for them."
B H.,"Wilmington, MA",9,9,,5.0,12/18/2014,Yum! Is all I have to say! Chicken Cobb Salad is to die for. Highly recommend
Jack M.,"Boston, MA",121,1206,326,1.0,1/19/2010,"I give up on you, Cheesecake Factory. We went here last Saturday night.  The wait was about an hour which was fine - it's what you expect.   I HATE the seating.  If it's not a booth, you sit literally elbow-to-elbow with the people next to you.  Crying babies and all.  It's horrible. SO LOUD.  It's like eating in a canyon.  I can't hear a word my quiet girl is saying.  It's totally annoying. BOO!  Waitress sneaks up from behind you and talks to you from DIRECTLY BEHIND YOU!?  HUH?  What is going on?!  Try it right now - have someone stand RIGHT BEHIND YOU as you are sitting there reading this.  Doesn't it feel creepy?  It's even creepier when they can't hear you and hunch down so their breath is on your neck as you try to explain what you want. I've never had a bad meal here.  UNTIL LAST SATURDAY.  I got a special - chicken bellagio.  It sounded nice - breaded chicken on basil pasta with arugla.  Holy crap.  It was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten - and I once ate a big bowl of salt!  Geez it was so bad.  Our waitress disappeared so I had to eat it - I was starving.  I maybe had a third of it before I gave up.  My baby got a crab cake burger.  It was over cooked, way too oily and way too much dressing.  Who knew if there was crab in there?  We both barely ate our food and when I told the waitress (when she finally returned) she asked if she should get the manager.  Huh? You don't ASK the client that - way to make it more awkward.  ""Yes I would like to complain more about this in public to your manager in this loud hell hole"".  Forget it.  We left totally frustrated, and hungry.   Cheesecake Factory - F YOU."
