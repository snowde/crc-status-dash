Sam S.,"Waltham, MA",0,22,,5.0,1/5/2017,I've been going to this location for well over 8 years and yet the experience of having a meal at this location becomes even more enjoyable. Servers takes great care of their customers and food is always delicious !
Sean C.,"Groton, MA",1,28,2,3.0,1/10/2017,"The food is ok. The restaurant is practically one big room with everything in it. The food is average, a little costly. I, however, was not impressed with their signature item- the cheesecake. Mind you, I'm not a cheesecake junky and don't like 10 varieties, I went for the simple one with strawberries(the one it said put them on the map)...........um, what's so good about it. I could barely even taste it- it so bland, Joe's American Bar cheesecake is much better. So is Capital Grill's, and though it's 10 dollars I would have gotten it instead. Maybe they should start making it like theirs."
Shar B.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",2,4,,5.0,2/18/2016,I only give 5 stars for Thalia! I gotta say there isn't anything better than a great server when you go out. It just makes everything so much more pleasant. The food was good! We are very picky and she made everything happen without looking annoyed. She was awesome! She made sure everything was on point! We went back a 2 weeks later the calamari was burnt (so dry)! The waiter never came back to check on us so we couldn't let him know until our food came. We kept trying to flag him down but he kept running past us without looking our way. We weren't too happy about that. Our food came...one of the plates the mushrooms were so burnt and dried out. We just sucked it up and didn't say anything. We left very unhappy. And the drinks were watered down! Just upset because we know what to expect and our second visit was horrible.
Laura B.,"Londonderry, NH",0,34,2,5.0,2/10/2016,"A great restaurant for any taste pallet. Went here on MLK Day and it was packed. The wait wasn't too bad. Server and other staff seem well trained. The menu is very large but I ended up getting pizza and my husband had a burger. Both were delicious and cooked exactly as expected. The Reece's peanut butter and red velvet cheesecakes were huge, tastey, and well worth the price. If I'm in the area again I will definitely go back. It's well worth it."
Rebecca S.,"Andover, MA",22,34,10,4.0,6/12/2016,"Very loud, but comfortable environment.  The menu is ridiculously extensive.  The food is expensive, but the portions are large.  We had two super tasty apps, the fried zucchini and the tex mex egg rolls.  I have had the avocado egg rolls before and they are tasty too.  My boyfriend had a massive burrito he was quite happy with and I had fish tacos that were overstuffed and impractical to eat, but super tasty.  The cocktails are pricey but good.  The desserts are crave worthy."
Benjamin E.,"Brookline, MA",12,67,33,3.0,9/19/2014,"This location is the most convenient one for me  because it is so much easier to get to since it is right off of RT128.  Like all the other locations, it's got that nice decor with the high ceiling and very friendly and responsive staff in their white uniforms.  The food is good and the menu has a lot of options to chose from, but I have noticed that the portions have become much small than before and the prices are still the same.   The drinks are very good, the bartenders are knowledgeable and they have a very good selection of spirits.  They also have a seasonal on tap all the time. All in all a very nice place to come to for lunch or dinner."
C T.,"Tewksbury, MA",16,11,9,3.0,1/21/2016,"I have never been a huge fan of the cheesecake factory. The menu is huge, with endless options, and portion sizes to match! But I generally I found the food to be mediocre. Just recently realized they do breakfast all day, and I had a wonderful omelette! The drinks, although delicious, are very pricey considering the venue. Most recently I visited because I received a gift card, and was pleasantly surprised to have Fahid as our waiter. He was fantastic! Extremely attentive, polite, helpful, and a delight to talk to. It may be worth visiting just in case you're lucky enough to sit in Fahid's section!"
Joe L.,"Billerica, MA",1,59,,2.0,2/12/2016,"1st time at the Cheesecake Factory and i was not impressed. The restaurant is very loud, between the loud music playing over the speakers, and the  high ceilings which are terrible for acoustics. I'm also not a fan of the tables being side by side so you can reach out and taste your unknown neighbors food, seperate tables or all booths please. Now the food. We started with potstickers and Mac and cheese balls. Cheese balls were very good. I had the steak tacos, the shells for the tacos, terrible, but the steak was tasty. I also tried the monster burrito, not to bad. The cheesecake we had for dessert was ok. Would not attend this establishment again, just was not impressed for the $$ we spent. Oh one thing I do want to mention, our server, Thallia, was fantastic, very attentive, great personality and on top of everything. A plus to her."
Tanya B.,"Boston, MA",1,5,,2.0,11/29/2016,"The food is great here (pretty much the same at all Cheesecake's), but my god - the service. I came here on a Tuesday night for a celebratory dinner for a friend's anniversary. We were told the wait time was an hour - after an hour, that wait time was extended at least another 35 minutes.  Our waiter - I wish I caught his name, but very rude. As we were ordering, he kept on yelling that he could not hear a thing. How can we hear all of our orders, but you can't? Instead of leaning in closer, he made us practically yell out our orders to him. He did this every single time, when ordering both drinks & food. When my brother ordered his meal of Baja Tacos and a side of fries, the waiter said verbatim: ""Are you sure you want the fries as well? The Baja tacos are the biggest item on the menu."" When my sister asked for basil in her Farfalle w/ chicken and roasted garlic pasta, he said, ""Adding basil to the pasta won't make it taste good - some dishes aren't meant for it."" and insisted she should order something else. If someone wants basil, and you can do it, I wouldn't recommend arguing against it. An older lady at the table only ordered sweet potato fries - she received it at the very end after we asked for the check. The fries were taken off the bill, but still unacceptable.  If the service was better, this would have been an enjoyable experience."
David A.,"Chicago, IL",26,61,47,2.0,1/23/2015,"This was a tad disappointing.  I didn't get my usual burgers and southwest eggrolls, which are almost always 4 stars.  Instead I got a Chicken BLT and my wife got fish tacos. Her tacos were the tempura fried ones.  They weren't that good for a few reasons: 1. No seasoning/salt added 2. Bones still in fish 3. The accouterments were....just there, not particularly good My Chicken BLT was blah! 1. Absolutely no seasoning or salt added.  It was painful, very bleh. The good news is the service was good, we also got a cheesecake, which gets 4 stars, each, but you go there to eat a meal, and the meal was sub-standard"
Chi L.,"Woburn, MA",0,8,,5.0,1/27/2016,"I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and I'd heard all the hype, so I was quite excited. We'd made a reservation for 11:30 on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. We've attempted to go to the Cheesecake Factory on other occasions, but the lines always stretched to the entrance of the mall.  We were served warm bread and butter as we waited. All four of us got iced tea and lemonade because of the free refills. My boyfriend got 5 refills on his raspberry lemonade. The waiter was very attentive. We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders as an appetizer and they were so delicious and amazing! I liked it more than my actual meal. I ordered the California Cheese Steak and my boyfriend got the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. He raved about the thick cut, slow roasted bacon on his burger. I tried some and it really just melts in your mouth. None of us had room for dessert afterwards, which was sad 'cause we were at the Cheesecake Factory! When they boxed up our food, we each got a complimentary cup of iced tea or lemonade (depending on what we ordered) to go!  Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the service was fantastic! Now I understand the hype! Can't wait to go back and try some of their other meals and hopefully cheesecake."
Jacqueline J.,"Wilmington, MA",7,28,12,5.0,3/21/2016,"Every time we've visited it has been fantastic. My boyfriend and I frequent this location for our nights out. We love Lauren! She's the best server they have. Super friendly, awesome recommendations and always makes sure you're taken care of and satisfied with everything. Ask for her when you go! Went last night with a friend and we started with the buffalo blasts. If you like buffalo chicken you need these. The Georgia peach and frozen strawberry margarita are so yummy. Reasonably priced at just under $12 each. The blood orange margarita was delicious as well. Strong and beautifully decorated. For entrees I got my favorite pasta da vinci and she got a bbq burger. Their soups are so good too! They change everyday and I always get the clam chowder and baked potato soup when available. We really took our time drinking and eating as we were catching up, and Lauren never made us feel rushed once but knows just when to check in and see how you are :) for dessert we got vanilla bean and the coffee kahula. Obviously the best cheesecake ever! It can get really busy on the weekends but it's worth the wait!"
Alexis J.,"Medford, MA",65,212,10,5.0,12/9/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always great. Our waitress was awesome. My bf's sandwich was great, my orange chicken was burnt BUT when I mentioned it to the waitress, she brought a new plate in less than 5 minutes. Also, there's nothing really to say about the cheesecake other than it's fantastic."
Tom X.,"Malden, MA",7,30,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Have been many times and the food has always been great. But, this time the entire group was a bit let down. My brother got the wrong drink, my rum and coke was watery and weak. Next time I'll get beer. At least it will be worth the money. No ingredients to skimp on.  table, silverware, floor, and table were dirty. Then the food came, my sandwich was on a totally bricklike baguette. Could of used it to hammer in nails! Not much steak in the sandwich either. My wife ordered a salad that never came. Our side salads that did come, came very late and were drowning in dressing. The bread had some human hair  in it and was also late. Don't know what happened. Normally this place is great. I'll write it off as a busy Sunday and the staff couldn't get out of the weeds I guess. May be back at some point, but no rush!"
Eric H.,"Lexington, MA",3,76,18,4.0,5/24/2015,"About a 20 minute wait by the time we got there, but it was worth it. Large menu with lots of items to choose from.  Got a drink, it was great. Nice and strong and a great size as well. All the food my friends got was great. Large portions and priced well too. $91 for 4 people wasn't bad at all. Aside from the waiting, I was impressed and will be back, hopefully during a slower time where the table wait line is shorter."
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,5.0,9/7/2015,"It was an yet another excellent part of this wonderful chain. Their dishes never disappoint, and the location is convenient, being part of the large Burlington Mall."
Maria C.,"Woburn, MA",0,5,2,1.0,5/6/2016,Worst Experience Ever!!! Very Disappointed after being such loyal customers.. We would always come here very frequently... Now Never Again after last night's awful experience (5/5/16).   My daughter and I got Food Poisoning after our meal...ending up going to the doctors...Never Again are we stepping foot into this Unsanitary Establishment!!! Kitchen needs to pay attention on Food Safety regulations!!!!
Vallerie L.,"Lawrence, MA",46,4,5,4.0,2/28/2015,"Food was great at this location, the Key Lime Cheesecake is very tart but still great, and the Buffalo Blasts are AMAZING! I never get tired of them. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle penne pasta dish is really good."
Ana A.,"Norwich, VT",44,79,198,3.0,12/7/2014,"Great dishes with great atmosphere! Although this restaurant is a chain, the food is nicely prepared with attention to detail. You can have anything at the Cheese Cake Factory. Their menu is ridiculously extensive. For Brunch or for lunch, this place is great!"
Christine J.,"Mid-Cambridge, MA",147,392,125,2.0,8/13/2014,"not the best place to get a good meal.  or drinks.  i asked our waitress what the diff btwn 2 types of proseccos are.  her answer?  ""just the price"". LMAO.  are you serious?  i laughed so hard.   foodwise, packed with calories and salt.  def a feel good meal..   cheesecake?  used to be larger, now it's 1/2 the size and 2x the price.  you do the math."
