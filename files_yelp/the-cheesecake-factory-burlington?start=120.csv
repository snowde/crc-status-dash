J K.,"Concord, MA",0,32,,1.0,8/16/2015,"I'd brought guests on their last day of stay for lunch. The server made a mistake with the POS and messed up the order of one of the guest, and we had to wait for the food to be made again. The server, who most likely got a scolding from the manager, took it out on us and were very cold and rude to us. Shame indeed. She turned the entire lunch experience to a mess, and I felt very sorry for the guests. The manager and the server did nothing to improve the lunch, only making it worse thanks to the cold server. If I'd been the manager at the place, the server would be fired without question."
Phoebe T.,"伯靈頓, MA",0,2,15,4.0,8/2/2016,"This is my first time walking into Cheesecake Factory. Service's nice and the food's wonderful, especially the cheese cake. How can I live without it when I'm back to Taiwan!?"
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",158,857,3017,4.0,4/13/2011,"Will often take the drive to this CCF because the ones downtown are too crowded, and its decent for its location... There is Always a long line here, I work close also & even at 1130 when they open its packed...  The mall has somthing to do with it... The food is as you would get at any Cheesecake... The menu is big like a book & the selection is crazy, so be prepared to have a total bout of undecideness... Order Everything...  The corn tamale cakes are TO DIE FOR!"
Virginia D.,"Everett, MA",0,38,2,2.0,7/8/2016,"I was underwhelmed today at The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a Margherita pizza and asked for it to be cooked well done. After waiting quite some time, it came out with a mushy crust, especially the center of the pizza. The appetizer salad that I ordered did not seem fresh and crispy. The high point was the bread that was given to start the meal. I brought the leftover pizza home to my husband thinking he might eat it but by the time I got home the pizza seemed to disintegrate from the mushiness. Will not be going back!"
Nora S.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,,5.0,8/12/2016,"We went there today for lunch.  The food and the service were both EXCELLENT.  Some times there is a wait (not today) but it is totally worth it!!   I am amazed that with such an extensive menu, the food is still so good.  We have always had excellent service here too.  The waitress was great.  We will definitely go back and highly recommend!!"
Ricky K.,"Melrose, MA",129,7,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"Our waitress Jolene H gave very poor service. She  was blatantly ignoring our table on the patio. Very quick to drop the check. We didn't get any water refills during our 3 course meal. Appetizer, entree and dessert. I had to go to the server station and ask for my own togo box. Busy or not when I got the attention of the food runner he pointed his finger in the air basically signaling one minute and continued to walk away. That is completely unacceptable. Terrible service, terrible hospitality experience. I was watching how great of service the other waitresses were providing their guests. I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but the service was just so bad this time I had to write a negative Yelp review. The good doesn't outweigh the bad."
Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",85,630,150,3.0,2/16/2013,"Always okay and never great.  I really liked the clam chowder although it wouldn't pass as New England clam chowder. It was lighter and fresher than the typical one and probably deserves a different name.  The lunch cesar salad also was a little strange. It was just a hugh pile of lettuce with cesar sauce. Little flavor, but a rabbit might have happy with it.  In summary, without the gift card that needed to be used, I wouldn't get out of my way to go to Cheesecake Factory."
Matthew M.,"Lowell, MA",6,66,,4.0,9/7/2015,Went for dinner. The food was very good. Wait staff was very friendly. Even though it was busy the wait was only 5 min. It's a little pricey. Have dessert  and got some cheesecake to go.
Sanjay R.,"Burlington, MA",0,4,1,5.0,11/15/2014,"Some of the best food and service here. I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for some time and the food and service is always spectacular. We came on a Last Sunday evening at 11 pm It wasn't as bad till the night progressed. Anyways, the waiter introduced us as we sat down. I swear, the bread and water arrived in under a minute as we sat down looking at the menu.  Ordered the chargrilled steak. The food was promptly delivered. I have to applaud our waiter for always checking up on us. I had a glass of Coke and had it refilled many times without me asking. The waiter took initiative which I really liked.  And of course, after our main course was finished, we had some slices of their infamous cheesecakes. Overall, I would keep coming here!"
Ronica P.,"South Burlington, VT",48,41,,4.0,7/13/2014,Herb-Rubbed Salmon - good Nachos- Good Santa Fe Chicken Salad- Good although they sometimes gip you on the chicken and one time they put lettuce chunks into it. Overall - I'll still keep going back for more.
Erin H.,"Pelham, NH",0,3,,1.0,2/5/2016,"If you never want what you order go here. Not only is half the staff inattentive, but they always get your order wrong no matter what day or time it is. Only the few tenured waitresses, waitors, and bartenders are great. Management changes as often as underwear. Save your money and go to Besito down the hall in the same mall. You get way better service and receive what you ask for."
Joe B.,"Billerica, MA",1,24,,5.0,3/1/2014,"What's not to like about this place? Everything in the menu is good, service is usually great, beer always tastes good on tap, place is always hopping so you tell me if it's good. My fiancé is a veggy and she always finds things to eat, but she does eat fish. If you are a vegan and have complaints about the menu haha this is not your place sorry. Honestly if your vegan most places aren't your place that just comes with the territory no pun intended. Prices are right and the quality of food is always good. Anybody who would bash this place saying quality of food is not good maybe just expect too much out of any place. Bottom line customers show up in droves to eat here end that speaks volumes for the food and staff.  Keep up the good work Cheesecake Factory management and staff."
Aaron E.,"Dracut, MA",30,2,1,5.0,10/9/2015,"Absolutely fabulous. Triangle mozzarella are the bomb dot com. Cheesecake is alright. Enchiladas beans are hotter than Charmanders. Always a good time. They have slippery floors. Really long time to serve, but worth the wait."
Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",592,1476,267,3.0,7/20/2012,"If you're eating at a Cheesecake Factory, you probably already know what to expect - generally good quality food at somewhat above-average prices. That's what you get here, so I'll just fast forward to the peripherals. This restaurant is big. We were a party of 6 showing up at 12:30 for lunch on a Friday. We were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a table, and it was much less than that, so seating and turnover is good here. Service was generally prompt. It took us slightly longer to receive our meals than we thought it should, but just as we were commenting on that, our meals arrived, though 1 of the 6 orders took another 2 minutes to be served.   Our meals were a variety of burgers, chili, and specialty salads all between $12 and $17.  There was also a mishap clearing a nearby table, which involved broken glass and water on the floor. That was attended to immediately, as were the people sitting at adjacent tables.  The rest rooms, while adequate, do not seem large enough for a restaurant of this size, nor do I feel they are kid-friendly enough."
E. H.,"Lexington, MA",0,12,,1.0,10/6/2015,"Horrible experience.  We stop in on occasion to pick up some Linda's fudge cake and carrot cake for dessert on the way home from going out to eat.  This past Saturday was no different until we got home.  Unfortunately, I didn't check the cakes before they were put in the bag.  After driving home we found that the slice of carrot cake was about half the size of the fudge cake.  We drove back and were told that it was the last one and that was why it was so small.  I'm not sure why they sold it in the first place except they probably thought as it was to go order, they might be able to get away with it. The manager was spineless and never even came out to address the situation.  Very disappointed!"
Barry A.,"Tewksbury, MA",51,54,199,2.0,10/27/2013,"This restaurant gets a 5 for Decor but unfortunately I didn't go there to just look around. Please NOTE: This is NOT a ""Vegetarian Friendly"" restaurant! Most meals are meat oriented and all salads have meat and no discounts for taking the meat out. It is very clear that there #1 objective is PROFIT and not how to serve the customer better."
Yev B.,"Waltham, MA",18,44,4,1.0,12/22/2015,"Called to place a take-out order. Was placed on a ""short hold"" lasting 15 minutes, ended up ordering elsewhere. It's easier to cancel Comcast than order from this dump."
Greg L.,"Collegeville, PA",71,746,928,4.0,2/22/2015,"Always enjoy eating at a Cheesecake Factory as I like the large amount of menu items to pick from and the food is always delicious, although portion sizes are larger than I need. I do like the fact that they do have their Skinnylicioius menu, which offers many delicious items for under 600 calories. Came here with some coworkers one weekday evening and despite arriving around 7:30pm, there was still a 30 minute wait. Having eaten at a number of different Cheesecake Factory locations, this is pretty typical. This location hands out a beeper that only works in and around the restaurant. Considering this location resides at a mall, they should really move to a system that typically texts you 10 minutes before your table will be ready. That's what the Cheesecake Factory does in my home location, which is also located in a large mall. At any rate, wait time was pretty close to what was quoted. It can be a little noisy in the restaurant making it a little hard to have a  conversation. Our waiter was just OK...not rude but not overly friendly either. On this visit, I went with one of their flatbreads off their Skinnylicious menus, which was good and left room for me to have their lemon meringue cheesecake, which is one of my favorite cheesecakes here. As always, I enjoyed the complimentary white and wheat bread loafs that you are given. For a chain restaurant, I expect pretty much the same experience no matter which location I go to, and this location did not disappoint in that regard."
William G.,"Waltham, MA",1,42,15,5.0,5/13/2015,"Recently had a great dinner experience at the Burlington location. The food was fantastic, quick wait, clean table. A wonderful time with my family and without alcohol and dessert reasonably priced for the greater Burlington area. Our server Jessica C. was simply awesome and really added to the evening. We also got to meet ""Bubbles Sunshine""!"
J P.,"Beverly, MA",17,167,159,4.0,3/3/2015,Stopped with friends for drinks after work. Got the blueberry moijito and Thai lettuce wraps asian style they were both absolutely delicious. I was iffy about trying the wraps but glad I did. The service was ok the server was pretty slow and kept making excuses why our drinks were taking so long even though the restaurant was the quietest I've ever seen it. My friend ordered food to go but when she got home it wasnt the food she ordered. The service aside everything else was awesome.
