Kacie D.,"Boston, MA",23,153,19,5.0,2/18/2015,"I came in right after the recent Blizzard and mainly because it seemed to be the only open restaurant in town at lunchtime. I was suprised that there were a fair amount of people there, yet it was slow enough that we did not have to wait at all for a table. The service was excellent and our sever was extremely attentive and kind. The food was timed perfectly and our server always refreshed our drinks. We were in and out quickly and the food was delicious."
Tulan K.,"North Andover, MA",68,188,246,5.0,1/15/2014,Cheesegate is one of my fav... Great food and great quality. You are almost guaranteed to get something you like and i love so many things there that it is always hard to decide on which. Stuffed mushrooms and the egg rolls are the best. Though their drinks are not good i dont drink so doesnt cut into my reviews. the quality of service is good too and has always delivered consistency in the quality and taste of food. No complains
Lindsay D.,"Lynn, MA",79,181,42,4.0,12/22/2011,"Occasionally I go here but lately I have stopped by twice after work to get something to go when I was exhausted. I order the same thing each time with lots of details and it's always spot on. Thai chicken pasta, no chicken, extra sauce on the side, bread, utensils, no butter.  With the exception of melted butter at the bottom once it's always great and the pickup staff is awesome. I love the convenience of this and the quality. Huge fan just wish the sit down lines weren't always so long. Minus one point for that."
Pablo R.,"Belmont, MA",6,27,4,5.0,7/7/2014,"Summary: Delicious food. Must  have time to enjoy. Friendly service. Tad pricey. Tons of options. (If it applies, great gluten-free selection!) Tonight was my first time ever at the Cheese Cake Factory, and I was truly impressed. I've been to the mall many times, and parking is fickle (sometimes you get lucky, most of the time you have to walk a bit). Today  I was lucky and got a place right next to the restaurant. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The menu itself was expansive, and it took me a solid 10 minutes to skim through the whole thing. Deciding on a plate was its own beast, because so many of the options looked fantastic. The waitress was more than friendly, and continually assured us there was no rush. I decided on the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta - nothing but high praise, but we'll get there. The bread they served was great, and I probably ate more than I should  have as a result. The pasta was delicious. A bit spicy, but its clearly labelled as such so I'm not going to doc points for that. The portions are massive, so make sure you're hungry when you come in! I typically eat a lot, and I still had to take half of it home because I couldn't finish it all. In the end I also got a slice of desert, and it completely lives up to the standard its name sets. If you're looking for good food and a nice night out, you can't go wrong here. I should also mention that I went with somebody who has a gluten-sensitivity, and she was blown away with the vast selection they have on their gluten free menu, in contrast to  the sparse pickings which typically plague someone with those limitations. She chose a pasta dish (a chancey move for gluten-free), and had no complaints about her meal either.  The whole dinner for two came out to $50 dollars, which is far more expensive than I usually ever go. But they give you so much that we ended up taking about half of it home - so if you think about it as 2 meals, that  comes out to 25$ for great food, which is a more than reasonable price. Definitely a recommendation for families, friends, and couples."
Christopher E.,"Waltham, MA",0,14,9,2.0,6/28/2014,I always wondered what was all the hype surrounding this place and I got to say it's not worth it. My meal was lukewarm and tasteless for the most part. Service was non existent. I rate it 2 stars mostly because of the atmosphere and it's location. At least you don't have to go far to buy something else to eat. I'll give this place another try to see if it was just a bad night.
Warren C.,"Gardena, CA",458,1141,123,4.0,7/19/2011,"Ugh. I came all the way from Cali to Boston to eat at Cheesecake Factory? You gotta be joking me. But apparently there's only like 5 restaurants near Billerica, so this was a safe choice. I guess. I won't bore you with the details of TCF, but the one thing I did notice about this place different from the others ones I've been to is that they don't dim the lights very much. I remember the other TCFs I've been to in the past were dark like dungeons. Or maybe that's just me. I have a feeling I'll end up here again anyways."
Molly P.,"New York, NY",25,37,7,4.0,12/29/2013,"Weekend after Christmas and this place is packed. Typical Cheesecake Factory experience- but hey I love it!  First of all, you can't beat that crazy brown bread they bring out. So so so so good! Legitimately makes the whole trip worthwhile.  Entreewise- I had the lunch portion of the Davinci Pasta. Good but too salty for me. Also huge portions so I'll be eating it for a few days. Boyfriend got Fish and Chips, which was delightfully crispy and not too oily. Also the portion of cole slaw was appallingly large. Does anyone eat that much cole slaw?  Anyways after those portions there was not enough room for cheesecake but whatever. Like I said, that stupid bread makes it all worthwhile."
Kevin L.,"San Francisco, CA",628,254,334,4.0,11/21/2014,"I was pretty impressed with this chain...food-wise. The waitress was a little strange and her awkwardness made me a little uncomfortable. Anyway, I ordered the buffalo wings for apps and then the shrimp scampi. Both were really good!"
Jackyline K.,"Lexington, MA",110,22,40,5.0,7/31/2014,"""The Ultimate""- their three layered velvet cheesecake being a cloud to die for, it always draws me right back to the ""Cheesy Cake"" - So I love to call it. Their food is not only heavenly to look at but tasty.    Heavens! Who on this planet would resist going to a cheesecake heaven - trust me its a little piece of heaven.  When it comes to the customer service, its an Ultimate  cant beat that. With sweet man on a dinner night, things wouldn't have been better without a stop at the ""Cheesy cake factory"".  Of course I always start with dessert, which never leaves me room for the main meal - I end up dipping from my man's plate. This particular place is never to full and less waiting time as opposed to the ones I was used to in Los Angeles especially during the happy hour time. That being said, I don't like their busy hours - the waitress always seem to have a rush attitude as opposed to the waiters, this is my personal view - so I ask for a male server.  My huby's favorite was the ""Fresh Salmon with a Delicious Lemon Sauce, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes."" He skipped the mashed potatoes and got the Mac and Cheese - they were so cheesy for my own sake, I doubt he will order those again.  Me - Gosh! I really never get to the meal menu since I am always ready to dive in with the dessert.  Price wise: Gosh everything is reasonably price - both my man and me probably ran about $45 of a final bill but then again that was worth every nickel.  Bottom line we enjoyed our meal. -A Bonus- They have out side seating. *Parking* Its Free - Come on.. You a at the Burlington Mall  -disfrute de su comida-"
David M.,"Burlington, MA",27,24,44,1.0,3/19/2013,"My wife and I walked in, and the hostess sat us right away. The entire restaurant wasn't busy and plenty of servers were around. Our server was quick to arrive and get us our water and give us our menus... Twenty minutes later our server hasn't even walked by our table to take our order or check up on us.  So, we grabbed our coats and left. The only person that seemed to notice us leave was the hostess, the only person at the Cheese Cake Factory that deserves any sort of praise. If I was the manager of that place, I would fire most of my staff.  Just terrible, I will not be going back."
LoveYouToo L.,"Cambridge, MA",0,66,2,2.0,2/28/2015,"Hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in Burlington for several years. Dinner tonight was nothing like we used to remember this restaurant to be and food left so much to be desired. Not to speak of the prices --a 22 oz draft beer $8.50, and stringy thin regular fries that come in a little cone are $3.95 (same type that you probably buy at Burger King for $1). At least if you're going to sell fries at that price you should make them home made or better than just the fast food joints. All that said, and then we had to wait for 1 hr 45 minutes and I am not teasing about the timeframe. I don't get it.  What is all the rage about this place?  It doesn't make sense. My friend ordered the cobb salad and was also immensely disappointed since she used to remember it as being so much better. She said they have changed it completely now. We were both super disappointed. I don't plan to go back."
Dani R.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,5,,4.0,4/16/2015,Love it here great place food & service.  This is the best restaurant in area.  Burlington not my favorite place to visit but the Cheesecake there is by far the best.  I love all the food the menu is amazing & the staff is on the ball superb fast & very attentive.  I will go there when the spirit moves me for great night out.
Paul S.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",17,34,22,4.0,10/27/2013,Good food and great cheesecake. I had an issue with my food being late... Was due to kitchen burning part. The manager and Chris took very good care of me. Great customer service.  The wait on Saturday night was about an hour... Plan accordingly... And plan on hovering and searching for parking.
Heather F.,"New Gloucester, ME",0,13,,2.0,7/18/2015,"Really disappointed with our night here. We are from Maine and don't have a Cheesecake Factory in our state. There was a 30 minute wait for a table (not bad) and we enjoying some drinks while we waited (although we waiting for service at the bar for 20 minutes of that wait). Our server was very personable and seemed attentive. Then after our appetizer we didn't hear from him until we were half way through entrees (someone else delivered our food). It also took 45 minutes to get entrees. When we did hear from him we asked for some water, and he only came back with the check. We didn't even order dessert because we thought we might have to wait forever for it. For the price tag of $100 for 3 people, I expect better service."
Guido G.,"Wilmington, MA",0,6,3,3.0,4/5/2015,Huge menu. Almost overwhelming. I had a beef dish over rice. The beef was tasty but the rice very dry. Don't understand the long waits. P.s. The cheesecake is really good
Bernice R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,42,5,4.0,1/10/2015,"This is a very clean and efficient restaurant, with a varied menu, generous portions, served in a room with high ceilings and fun, if somewhat flamboyant, decor.  This is not haute cuisine, but for a tasty meal, and options to please most, this is a great bet.  I loved the ""skinny"" Tuscan chicken, someone else liked the fries, and there were lots of vegetarian options."
Laura B.,"Toronto, Canada",174,137,31,5.0,8/13/2013,"I love this place, it's one of my all time favorite restaurants. It has a wide variety of things on the menu, small plates to big plates. I love to come here for appetizers and a glass of sangria. The corn tamale cakes are awesome, chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps are great, and the Caeser salad here is my family's favorite. The Adam's Cheesecake is amazing, especially if you love Reese's and Butterfingers like I do. Great place to come if you want food, but you're not sure what you're in the mood for. They seriously have everything."
Susan B.,"Reading, MA",22,41,14,1.0,8/26/2014,"This place is def resting on it's laurels...it has really food and service wise gone way down hill...went here to celebrate my nephew going off to college.   Group of 7 people, our waiter was CLUELESS, he did not know pretty much ANY of the menu, he didn't clear ANY dirty dishes, bread basket sat empty the entire meal, never offered water refills unless we asked, the app we ordered was not how we asked for it (mac n cheese balls with sauce on side) and no cream sauce so they ""fired"" another, would have been been better to just take it off the bill!  Food was meh, to make matters worse, it was FREEZING, and I'm not talking oh Grandma is chilly (cause she usually is) she had on 2 sweaters, and a blanket, even my nephews were cold, my daughter went to the car and got her sweatpants, and sweatshirt, we mentioned to the hostess it was really cold, they said they would check it.  Not once did we see a manager, and we were not the only table freezing, the rest of the patrons were all cold too...the sun was setting and they turned the lights down so we were shivering in the dark...to the point we barely ate our desserts...ugh Hey CHEESECAKE FACTORY wake up...there are plenty of other restaurants people can go to...perhaps you need to revisit the customer service portion of the program eh?  Most likely won't be back to this chain that has decided that name alone is enough to bring in the customers."
Justin H.,"Sanford, ME",4,34,,5.0,12/22/2014,"This place is great! The menu is like a novel is so huge, and the food is amazing. And of course the cheesecake is good too. A huge selection of both. Pretty good mixed drinks as well ( the sangria is the best I've ever had). The price of course is really high, but totally with it. I'll be hitting this spot up again in the near future."
Amanda B.,"Andover, MA",8,3,,4.0,1/18/2015,"Amazing! The food was great as always and we really enjoyed our server. He wasn't up our butts like some waiters can be. He allowed us to enjoy our meal in peace only coming by at the most opportune times to refill our drinks or get us what we needed. It is a pricey place to eat so whenever we have some extra cash to spend, this is our top choice. We will definitely be returning to his location."
