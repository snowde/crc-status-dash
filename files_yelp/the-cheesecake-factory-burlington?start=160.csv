Cynthia A.,"Boston, MA",52,99,,2.0,7/8/2015,"I really love the Cheesecake Factory but this time it was really disappointing. The service was not what it usually is, yes they were busy but my friend asked for another glass of water and fifteen minutes goes by and she has to ask another waiter, not good. The food taste good but my food was cold. The steak diane was cold and very thin, the shrimp scampi was cold. The mashed potatoes were actually warm. I got cheesecake after and the lemon one but it looked nothing life its picture, it did not look appetizing. Although it tasted good. Usually I go to Natick but I met a friend there, not the typical Cheesecake Factory experience. One word describes is "" Disappointed"""
Brian W.,"Andover, MA",25,418,,2.0,11/25/2012,"I haven't actually eaten dinner at a Cheesecake Factory in several years, but we were given a gift card so we figured it was time to take the plunge. The place as big as other Factories I've been to and the wait would have been just as long, but thankfully we had reservations.  We were seated promptly, but it probably took about 12 minutes before a waiter came over and acknowledged our presence. I lost track of how long it took before we actually got the drinks we ordered and when we were able to put in our food order. When the waiter did appear, he was helpful about my wife's gluten allergy. We started off with the chicken lettuce wraps, which included the smallest piece of chicken you could possibly imagine. It didn't help that the chicken morsel tasted totally bizarre and nothing like chicken. Fortunately our meals were a little tastier, but the food was nothing special.  We won't be back and we'll plan on re-gifting any future gift cards we receive."
Poonam A.,"Lexington, MA",0,4,,2.0,12/4/2015,"I have been here a few times before and always had a good experience.  But last night was different.  We had gone to celebrate our son's birthday.  The server was indifferent and truly did not 'serve' us.  He came to take our order for drinks, appetizers and main course.  Never checked on us during the meal.  Did not pick up the appetizer plates when the main course was served.  Did not ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee and just came and placed the check on the table and left.  This is not what one expects - it was an expensive meal and we left feeling disheartened."
Tanya P.,"Billerica, MA",3,16,,5.0,10/20/2014,I just love that this place is adding more vegetarian options and the place is lovely.  I enjoy eating outside while the heater are going.
Taylor L.,"Merrimack, NH",62,238,107,4.0,6/6/2014,"The staff is exceptional. For a place that is always busy, with up to 90 minute waits just to be seated. They truly make the place a joy to visit. Prepare to wait is the best advise that I can give anyone coming here because they are generally packed Friday through Sunday. Their menu is also huge leaving no cuisine undiscovered so it's the perfect place for a large group that can't decide on one place. The cheesecake is exceptional and there are also a variety of choices for everyone!"
Dave M.,"Atlanta, GA",59,783,1866,4.0,3/23/2013,always love this place. wide diversity in their menu. the food is a little pricey for me (mid/high teens) but i only infrequently for that reason.  never really had problems with service with the exception of a couple of waiters but oeverall this location is solid. get there early or late. the place is large but it's so busy. we arrived at 5:15pm on a sat and it was already packed. weekend evenings are always busy.
M B.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,91,9,3.0,11/25/2013,"We are eating here every once and a while. Why 3 stars? Because when they have light traffic - they are fine. Easy 4-5 stars. Some employees there are not always top of the mark but ok.  However, when they have busy night - it all falls apart and the service lose control. At busy nights - they get 1 star. Once I honestly thought of giving a zero tip..."
Tina S.,"Burlington, MA",27,39,,4.0,10/8/2014,Love the food!! You dont need to order much because the portion is on the bigger side even for appetizer! ! Hmmm
Sandy C.,"New York, NY",367,544,1513,3.0,5/31/2010,"When I got to Boston it was pretty late in the evening and my aunt and uncle took me here to grab some late dinner. Honestly, I'm okay with Cheesecake Factory. I mean I don't hate it, but I feel it's a little over-hyped, perhaps. But there are some pretty good dishes. The server was always attentive and really friendly. For appetizer we had the Crab and Artichoke dip with sourdough bread, which was presented in a small little pan - it's so cute!   And the dip was pretty good. I had their special of the night, which was catfish with a crusted topping, with mashed potatoes and some mixed veggies. It was okay, the crusted topping buried the catfish filet and it just looks like a pile of crusted topping only.  For dessert, my aunt and I shared a piece of their apple crumble cheesecake with caramel.   It was pretty good. Next time when I return to another location, I want to try this mango cheesecake...woohoo for mangoes!"
Less H.,"Beverly, MA",127,231,8,3.0,5/13/2012,"The menu was a million pages long and had one of everything, including ads. *head desk* A safe bet for large chain restaurants that offer a little of everything is a burger. I ordered a ""wild"" mushroom and cheese burger, medium rare. I don't know why I bother to order anything medium rare in a chain restaurant. It's foolish to think that they will even consider making it medium rare, or be able to determine that my one burger is the medium rare burger. By the time my burger got to me it was medium well. The burger itself was tasty if HEAVILY salted. The best thing on my plate were my sweet potato fries. Perfectly cooked.  My partner got a BLT salad, which was interestingly presented- a head of lettuce was cut into giant slices, laid out on the plate and toppings added. It looked cool and was a unique way to present a salad. Our other friend ordered a BLT and it looked great. We sat outside so we didn't have to wait long for our seat, but we were seated in the sun with no umbrella and our waitress while attentive was mostly absent during our meal. Refills on water and iced teas were a long wait."
Ribblet N.,"Andover, MA",41,149,24,4.0,10/24/2014,"Had a gift card and went for brunch.  The server was top notch and the food came quick and hot.  Oh and had an appetizer, like a sweet Spanish corn cake (still don't know what its called, was recommended by a friend) very good!"
Andrew F.,"Westford, MA",11,35,20,4.0,2/12/2013,"Just had dinner here. This was very good. Our waitress was very nice and the food was out in very good time! The kids cheese pizza was too cheesy for kids but really, thats not a big deal. The burger was good and I have to say, the fries are outstanding. All the staff was freindly! This place tends to get busy, even during the week (I came on a Tuesday and there was 15 min wait) Overall, pretty good place to come eat!"
Travel S.,"Nashua, NH",0,30,3,4.0,8/7/2013,"Whats not to love about Cheesecake factory. They have such a big menu that gets me confused sometimes but everything I've tried there so far has been great. The portions are huge and its difficult to make room for dessert even after sharing an entree. I especially like the Avocado eggrolls and Tex-mex eggrolls. Their breakfast menu options are available all the time and the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito is yumm. be sure to order one to share though as its pretty big for one person. Although all of them are delicious, I Love their Tiramisu cheesecake."
Callie H.,"Nashua, NH",26,14,7,3.0,10/16/2015,"Planned a trip to the Burlington Mall and Cheesecake Factory with a friend a while ago. We were so excited to eat here since this was the place to be when in the Burlington Mall. The Cheesecakes are just amazing. The food was great...but the service was just absolutely dreadful. We received a buzzer that would go off in 20 minutes. When the buzzer did go off a little after 20 minutes we notified the hostess. Once we told them anther hostess said ok it will be just one moment and she went to a nearby table asking another couple to leave their table so we could eat there. I find this very rude to ask to leave your table especially if you have a lot of food left on your plate. The servers moved them and their food to another table. To who ever was at this table I am so sorry about that and I would have let you stayed and waited until the next table was done. Once we were seated there was no silverware so that came straight after. I did notice the silverware not very clean. Looked like they might have been taken out of washer and not dried with a cloth right away. We were given waters and bread, which was nice. When we were ready to order food my friend asked for a special request. She wanted the lettuce wraps but instead wanted the chicken greek salad in the wraps. ""May I please have the greek instead without the cucumber in the wraps?"" He asked why she didn't want cucmbers, and she doe not like them""Is this possible"" she asked. The waiter said ""no."" My friend asked, ""then what can you do?"" Thinking that he would be accommodating to a paying customer and making her happy he would have suggested something or given her what she wanted. But instead he said, ""Nothing."" I looked up at my friend and the two tables next to us could here what he said and both looked at us thinking, ""What did he just say?"" ""You will only be getting a little olive, arugula, and cheese if you get the chicken greek salad,"" he said. ""It is tiny and it will not be enough food."" They were going back and forth about the greek salad. If he did allow her to have what she wanted it would have costed more anyways. No waiter ever says ""No I cannot do anything for you. "" She could not get what she wanted and made my friend feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed. So she stuck with the regular lettuce wraps. The two tables next to us started talking to us like this is crazy. When he brought it out he said ""Look now doesn't that look better? The other dish would have been very little."" Kaazur, I believe that is how you spell it does not know how much she is able to eat and should not have said that. We could not believe the service we were experiencing. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado club, which was terrific which I would order again and make myself at home. She did not finish hers. When she saw the waiter again she pointed take-out box please. He looked at her and gave a hand gesture to the side of his legs that was stating, ""You couldn't finish that, it was so small.?"" UNBELIEVABLE. Yup... no tip and spoke to the Mike the manager which didn't help at all. All he said was, ""Im sorry."" Nothing about he would talk to his staff member. Just, Oh sorry, oh so very sorry."" Will be back again but no with that waiter again. This is really not his profession. I have been here in the past with a positive experience but this by far is the WORST service I have ever had when dining out, not just including this particular restaurant. No waiter should ever make a paying customer uncomfortable and embarrassed."
Vincent T.,"North Attleboro, MA",29,125,9,3.0,11/22/2012,"Let me just say this place is BIG.. and LOUD... definitely not the quiet intimate setting. Our party of three met for lunch here on a Thursday, and it was quite busy.  Service was prompt and good.  I had the Tuscan Chicken off their low-cal menu which was pretty good.  Three grilled chicken breasts topped with some interesting veggies in a balsamic sauce.  However, the artichoke hearts were very skimpy.   But overall, it was a good dish. I grabbed a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. Prices are on the higher side, with almost $6 for a single piece of cheesecake."
Teizue G.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",103,11,16,1.0,7/30/2014,"Ordered my god at 2:48 and don't receive it till 3:44. Stood in the curbside line for 15mins as the shift supervisor over looked me 8 times (yes I counted) and took other orders. Never once look my way or asked my (a) can I help you? (b) are you waiting for food? (c) do u have a question?  Then he told me "" ma'am I'm not a mind reader, you were on your phone. I didn't see you"". Really?!! Thanks"
Sally S.,"Boston, MA",2,26,,1.0,2/11/2012,Food is overpriced microwaved salt fest. I have been here two times and both times I wanted to throw up.  Why is it so hard to get fresh food and good service without needing to spend over $500 for a meal? Dinner is $100 or more for two people.  The wait is insane. A three hour wait for that? Are you kidding me? The only people that seem to go there are bourgeois losers who like to pretend that they are the nouveau riche. Everyone and I do mean everyone was wearing a north face jacket. It seemed that if you want good service you must wear this unofficial uniform if you don't management and the waitstaff treats you like dirt.  I rather eat at McDonald's (yuck).
Sha D.,"Medford, MA",0,149,,3.0,3/18/2014,"I really don't know how I felt about this place. I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon. This place was CRAZY packed so of course we were given a half hour wait so we proceeded to stand awkwardly in the lobby with the other hundred or so people waiting for tables. The wait actually wasn't too bad. Maybe like 15 minutes. We were seated in the bar area in this cramped half booth type of thing which was crammed between two other tables. Whenever the man at the table next to us got up, he would knock something off of our table.  Our waiter seemed really nice and they bring you really good bread. The menu is huge and has so much on it. I decided to get the old fashioned burger. It literally took an hour for the food to get there. The people who sat down after us got there food way before we did and our waiter vanished during that time. Finally we got our food. I'm not sure how they let my burger leave the kitchen in the condition it was in. I don't know how to describe it... it was just unedible. It was like four small pieces of hamburger being held together with a piece of cheese in a bun. It fell apart the second I took a bite. I wanted to complain but again the waiter disappeared.  Who knows. I'll probably be back at some point because the place does have potential..."
Rosie K.,"Medford, MA",0,14,,4.0,11/12/2014,"I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, especially this location. The food and drinks are amazing and worth the wait. Same goes for desserts.  Because this location does not take reservations, be prepared to wait for a table and even longer for a booth. Sometimes the wait staff are busy and it is hard to grab their attention, but as stated, the food and drinks are worth the wait. If you are impatient and looking for a quick meal, do not try this location at peak dinner/ lunch hours. I usually find there is no wait on weekday evenings.  My favorite cheesecake is the godiva chocolate or hershey chocolate. Try the sliders, buffalo blasts and surprisingly, their pasta dishes are amazing.  Portions can be large for dinner, perfect at lunch time.  The only reason this location is not getting a 5/5 is because I had an issue with my food at this specific location a few months ago. Found something questionable in my food while eating. I did not feel the waiter or management handled it correctly.  Other than that- cheesecake factory burlington is amazing"
Mike W.,"Belmont, MA",386,165,492,4.0,5/1/2012,"It might be a bit on the pricey side here, but I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal at a Cheesecake Factory location. One of the things I like about this place is the various options of atmosphere that they give.  They have a decent size bar with four TVs and high top seating for small groups.  A bunch of 5-6 person booths and 2-4 person tables in a open area.  Also if you want a more intimate setting some tables and booths have high backs that give you and your dinner dates a little more privacy.  If you're looking for a quiet dining experience I would suggest asking for one of the secluded tables.  Since the open area, I mentioned above, usually has a good number of families dining there and depending on the day and time those families can have loud kids. On my most recent visit I started with an order of Buffalo Blasts.  They're fried, spicy pouches stuffed with chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce.  They come served with celery sticks and blue cheese, and on the recommendation of our server we also had a side of ranch dressing for a slight change of flavor.  They're not quite as filling as normal boneless buffalo wings, but as a light starter they're not too bad. For dinner I went to the ""Glamburgers"" section of their rather lager menu, and selected the Memphis Burger.  In the words of Jules Whitfield as he bit into a Big Kahuna Burger, ""Mmmmmm this is a tasty burger!""  The burger itself is a thick, juicy and very flavorful patty which gets topped with slow roasted BBQ pulled pork, melted cheddar cheese, cole slaw, pickles and mayo.  It is quite the mouthful, and if you don't have big hands you'll probably end up cutting it in half just to make the handling of the burger a bit easier.  The Memphis Burger not only fills you up, it's an absolutely delicious meal. My girlfriend is a little less adventurous when we come here.  While I usually like to try something new each time I visit, she knows exactly what she's going to get without question.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps, which are actually an appetizer.  My assumption is they expect you to share it with the table, but if one person orders it they should be plenty satisfied with it as a meal. If there is a negative for me to point out, I guess it would be that the drinks could have been a tad bit stronger.  In other words, not much to complain about here."
