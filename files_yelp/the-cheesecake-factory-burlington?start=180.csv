J L.,"Boston, MA",8,191,16,2.0,7/11/2014,"Went for dinner, it was crowded & noisy as usual, Firecracker salmon was great but the fish and chips SUCKED! greasy! Overcooked pieces of white fish that smelled like ammonia, the fries were ice cold, coleslaw was good, and the greek salad was not fresh-looked and tested lil sit was from yesterday, just not consistent all around, not worth the money or the wait. I'll just do apps next time."
Michael C.,"Boston, MA",923,1346,1770,3.0,12/20/2011,"Not much to say here that hasn't been said, it's the Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for a relatively cheap restaurant meal at a convenient location this is the spot. Definitely one of the best locations of this franchise I have been to."
Paul C.,"Watertown, MA",11,102,,4.0,6/9/2014,"I find that their food is always good. We went at midnight and all enjoyed our meals (a salad).  The portions are always large, tasty and, while not cheap, it's appropriately priced.  Our waitress was extremely nice too."
Bryan W.,"Wilmington, MA",2,63,22,3.0,11/1/2014,Always an hour wait for average food. With so many choices in town this one is currently off my list.
Sam K.,"Plymouth, MA",2,119,7,4.0,10/13/2014,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my first time the other week and got the Grilled Chicken Sliders, Corn dogs and Meatloaf dinner.  Everything was fantastic.  The food did take awhile to get to the table though.  The Meatloaf had Mushrooms on top of it which im allergic to (It did not say it had mushrooms on the menu at all) but its apparently in the sauce gravy as well.....  So I ordered one without mushrooms which made the Meatloaf a little less appealing without any gravy whatsoever.  I was given a complementary Cheesecake piece.  All in all I thought the menu was great and so was the food.  The waiting times to get the food however was quite awhile."
Hrishikesh H.,"Nashua, NH",29,116,9,5.0,10/13/2012,"The meal at cheesecake factory can become expensive with three course meal you order. But I have never been disappointed by any meal. Their appetizers are good. I like avocado egg rolls, spice ahi tempura rolls.  The service we got was excellent even though the were very busy and out server was waiting 4 other tables."
Mustafa M.,"Burlington, MA",0,8,1,5.0,11/14/2015,Bloody brilliant cooks they have every thing here. I got the steak so well cooked meal I also got the mocha drink hot steamed milk with vanilla ice cream on top with a dap of whip cream amazing I would say always come here but for dinner there is a long wait but overall it's definitely 5 stars without a doubt.
Alex R.,"Woburn, MA",0,6,2,4.0,8/9/2014,Great food. Big quantity. If you order appetizer then share the main meal or you will  taking home the rest of the dish. Try the buffalo blast and fried calamari they are to die for.
Tish F.,"Middletown, NY",42,28,,3.0,7/6/2014,"OK - so in all seriousness, it's about the same as any other Cheesecake Factory I've been in.  Solid food, big portions, decent staff.  Our waiter was a *little* more chatty than most - and the conversation got a little weird.  That being said it was the night before the Boston Marathon this year and everything was a little surreal.."
Linda T.,"Lowell, MA",59,139,428,5.0,10/11/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory! Haven't been here in awhile, but recently came here for dinner and it was exactly what I've remembered; amazing! For appetizer, you must try the hot spinach and cheese dip, mmm! My friend and I ordered the 'Louisiana chicken pasta' which was deeeeelicious! My other friend ordered the Shepherd's pie, which was also good, but something I wouldn't order (I'm not a big fan of carrots in anything and the dish had shredded carrots in it. . . ) My other friend ordered the Caramel chicken, which is also good, but I don't think I would personally order it. We were way too stuffed to even go for dessert! I'm not crazy about cheesecake, but I sure didn't hesitate to take a bite when my brother use to buy them and bring it home. One of my friends went to the counter and ordered two slices to go which came out to be ~$15.  We came on a saturday night, so a wait was expected. We got there at 8pm, got seated by 9pm and served our dinner at 10pm. Btw, make sure you are near/ in the cheesecake factory close to your estimated wait time, the clicker isn't activated otherwise. The wait was well worth it, the food was satisfying! Writing this review is making me hungry.  *Must try the Louisiana Chicken Pasta*"
Tiff D.,"New Orleans, LA",355,631,380,4.0,7/20/2009,"I'm addicted to Cheesecake Factory.  Although overwhelming at times, their extensive menu offers SO many delicious choices. I can always find something no matter what I'm craving.  Reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is:  1. The prices are a bit steep but the portions are huge, so its like you are paying for 2 meals since I always have left overs.  2. There is always a rediculous wait (1 hr +) and they dont take reservations.  3. Every location I have been to has NO parking. Even the ones at the malls are difficult to park at.  I have tried too many items to list but some of my favorite are BUFFALO BLASTS and THAI LETTUCE WRAPS.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the THAI LETTUCE WRAPS. :)  The drinks are also EXCELLENT. I have tried several of their alcoholic drinks and have enjoyed everyone of them. My favorite is the Mojito. Cheesecake Factory makes the best Mojito I have ever had.  Although I dont get it, the decor is great. Vaulted ceilings, roman columns. Plenty of seating including outdoors.  4.5 stars for Cheesecake Factory.  DAMN GOOD."
Ramin S.,"Boston, MA",66,19,,5.0,6/21/2014,Great quality food and everything happened quick! We were there for Father's Day brunch and the service was excellent. Asked for no bacon on my order and they brought me extra potatoes instead. I would recommend this place if you are looking for high quality and not expensive!
Carolann S.,"Reading, MA",0,15,,4.0,8/2/2014,"Saturday afternoon at 3:00 the wait was only 10 minutes. The good news: The food was delicious as usual. My husband had the chicken Marsala and I had the Cuban sandwich and chose the Caesar salad instead of fries. Even those pieces of lettuce were perfectly seasoned! I asked that the sandwich only be lightly grilled instead of grilled and pressed into a brick. It was perfect. My husbands only complaint was that the pasta was oily but still certainly edible. Of course the vanilla bean cheesecake dessert was great too. The not-so good-news: Please! Don't call a couple (male and female) in ther fifties ""guys"". This is not appropriate.  And for the price we paid for drinks you'd think they would have alcohol in them.  I had a mohito for the first time and it was good albeit a little sweet. My husband had two Mai tais and questioned whether there was alcohol in it.  Three drinks, a dinner and a sandwich cost $75 for lunch."
Deb B.,"Waltham, MA",28,27,9,5.0,3/15/2014,"Great food...haven't been to this restaurant in years... The only thing that we dint like is that we were buzzed, but waited another 15 min to be seated.  There were people that got buzzed after us, who were seated first. Not a very good system. Also-the air was very cold throughout our dining experience!"
Alejandro S.,"Burlington, MA",0,6,1,5.0,11/27/2012,"This is a must place for anyone to have good food in large amounts.  We just had Marcy as our waitress near the bar area an she's just the best, she over performs as a waitress. PS spicy chipotle chicken an red velvet cheesecake, no way of going wrong with that!!!"
Amanda M.,"Wilmington, MA",0,29,21,3.0,6/8/2014,Only have eatin here twice since it has opened. Too pricey and not really great food. Plus evey time we come it is WAY to loud. It's like eating at a concert. Cheesecake is the only thing worth the money but still only for special occasions.
Audrey B.,"Pelham, NY",320,146,33,4.0,6/6/2013,"Yesterday my infant son and I met a friend for lunch at Cheesecake Factory.  First, I was shocked that we were able to get a table right away, even with a clunky stroller in tow.  Our server, Jesse, was awesome and suggested a highchair and we gave it a try and it worked!  (The baby is 9 months old so this is hit-or-miss and he said if it didn't work he'd be happy to take it away.)  They were also flexible about letting me stow my stroller nearby (not to be paranoid but it wasn't a cheap purchase and I don't like the idea of ""parking"" it too far from where we are).  My friend had a lunch pasta and I had a lunch pizza / salad, both of which were generously portioned and far better than we'd expected - really a terrific meal!  I haven't been to Cheesecake in a long time but was impressed at their ""skinny"" offerings and the top-notch service.  Unexpected hit!"
Kevin T.,"Groton, MA",104,178,124,2.0,3/30/2013,"Okay, chain restaurant fo sho! We're all familiar w CCF and their delicious cheesecake, but oh no, this place is destined to be nothing more than a giant cafeteria.  Ranked in order from good to bad.  1. Leia (server) 2. Drinks (draft beer) 3. Crab dip (not all that great).  Sums it up folks.  Salty Food, crowded seating, and piss poor food."
Amanda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,654,1357,3.0,10/26/2013,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, consistent and tasty, if not exactly thrilling. But sometimes consistency is key. Also, the waitstaff is well-trained."
Tom B.,"Warwick, RI",2,11,5,3.0,3/8/2014,I love this restaurant but I I think I like it better eating at a table instead of at the bar...the bartenders didn't want to be bothered by anything. I ordered a beer that never came and gave me such an attitude when I has asked for it again .. She didn't ask how my dinner  was the salmon tasted fishy but she pretty much ignored me after I mentioned my beer I would have sent it back but I just wanted to get out of the there because the service was just so bad.. Any other time there has been good .. Someone needs to let the bar staff from Friday nights to find a new job or get a better attitude and actually act like they want to be there.
