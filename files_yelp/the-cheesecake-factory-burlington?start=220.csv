Scott J.,"New York, NY",294,390,71,2.0,3/28/2010,"Can someone please explain the appeal of The Cheesecake Factory? I remember when the chain first came to New England in the 90s, you couldn't get in without a 3+ hour wait.  And, at the time, people were willing to hang around this long to experience this place.  Back then, it was a combination of the endless choices on the menu and the draw of its desserts -- after all, the name speaks volumes. So I get that the desserts are great, but is it still worth a long wait for sub-par food with standard service?  Nothing about this place screams special and every time I go back (usually at someone else's suggestion), I'm disappointed that I am not getting something more. Don't get me wrong, their cheesecake is amazing -- as well it should be.  You wouldn't call yourself a factory of something if it wasn't good.  There's nothing that keeps me going back, or craving this place, which is a shame -- but I guess if you still bring in the crowds after all of this time, there's no reason to change your business model, or your menu."
Pamela S.,"Andover, MA",3,51,6,4.0,2/20/2013,"It may be a chain, but I've always liked the food here. On my last visit I got two picks from the Skinny Menu: the arugula salad with beets and goat cheese and the ricotta and sausage flatbread pizza -- yum! The salad was generous and both were the perfect size to fill me up without making me feel like I had stuffed myself."
Jj B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,,2.0,1/9/2016,my mom and i went there on a fri night after shopping at nordstrom.   was packed to the hilt.   people watching was awesome.  why go to vegas when you can go to cheesecake factory.  it was a long wait but we made our way over to the bar and luckily got a seat there....bar high tops are 1st come 1st serve.   took awhile for any of the bar staff to notice us...which may be their style but came across as cheap.   but then our meal including tip was only $47.  if you don't go out much its the place for you.  if you travel and are accustomed to excellent customer service you wont be impressed.  but my mom and i dont get out much anymore so this was like going to the circus.   we'll be back for a good laugh!
Damien S.,"Boston, MA",2909,1678,3712,3.0,7/30/2007,"Another stop on the path to the ultimate Cuban (see Dave's Fresh Pasta.) It's a chain so one comes to expect consistency and quality, which the CF delivered. The advertisements in the menu are, um, groundbreaking. Yeah. I still can't believe the dentist in there has the website cheesecakedentist dot com. A little misleading and self-propagating, wouldn't you say? Service is hit or miss, as to be expected with any chain. The sandwich and fries were cooked perfectly, ample quantities of both and the price showed. When I realized there was no mustard on the Cuban, I asked the server for a side and she brought a small glass bottle of French's. I used my knife to spread the stuff and thought ""This is odd. Who else stuck their utensils in here?"" Ah well, I'm not the germaphobe but it left an impression. The place is enormous. A friend and I went during the heart of lunch hours and were met by a madhouse of shoppers, bizfolk and summer break teens. Remarkably, we were still sat in under 10 minutes proving once and for all, size matters."
Ycart S.,"Cambridge, MA",1,5,,5.0,9/3/2013,"This place is always busy, I've never not waited, but they seat you fairly quickly and can get you in and out especially if you go at lunchtime during the week and say so :)   I love their under 500 calorie menu I've eaten a number of items from here and never leave feeling deprived or hungry.  The food is tasteful and well portioned and presented.   I've also brought my younger kids here and the servers are always helpful with seating and menu suggestions.    Looking forward to my next visit!"
Lucy D.,"Nantucket, MA",41,682,41,5.0,1/6/2013,Great food- absolutely loved the Mexican salad. Fresh ingredients and the service was very good too. Come early since there is almost always a wait to get a seat. Will return.
Nam N.,"Woburn, MA",220,3,,2.0,5/26/2013,"Let me just say, I was so angry when I got there. I went on a friday night of memorial day weekend. BUT, I called at least 10 times throughout the week and the week before to make sure they had my reservation and they kept saying yes, they did. I got there and they have NO IDEA what I was talking about! My party and I had to wait an hour and a half for a table! The service from then on was great, I loved our waitresses. In all honesty, the appetizers are great. But the food itself was ehh. I've had much better and I don't think it was worth the price I paid, but the portions were great.  It's a really dimly lit place, so that was such a downer. I swear, I couldn't read the menu because it was so dark. I couldn't take pictures without flash either. It's pretty loud too, so you have to raise your voice if you want to speak to someone who isn't sitting within 2 seats of you. The cheesecake is pricey but delicious. I had the (I think) chocolate coconut cheesecake. Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this restaurant, but it's not horrible. The food is okay, the service is nice (with the exception of the reservations things), and the price is a bit much."
Sarah M.,"Boston, MA",3,57,1,4.0,4/8/2011,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake and several others dozens of times over the past 10 years.  If you want a table, be prepared to wait.  This place is usually mobbed at all the usual times.  I've had pretty good luck lurking in the bar area and mobbing anyone who looks like they might be paying their bill. Bar and bar-table service has always been good, usually much better at the bar itself.  I've never had a bad meal at any Cheesecake.  The food is always very tasty, portions are GIANT and the servers/bar tenders are always good about customizing my meal should I want to make a change or substitution.  And the accuracy is at least 95% in those few cases. Cheesecake is also to die for.  Drinks are large and strong and very pricey. And yes, it is LOUD as heck and busy busy busy.  They must be doing something right!"
Scott W.,"Lincoln, MA",0,14,,3.0,6/11/2013,"My kids love Cheesecake factory for the cheesecake at the end of the meal.  But that's about the only great thing about it. We always had to wait for a long time before we can get seated...you'd imagine they must be serving great food.   Food was OK, variety was great so you will always find something to eat and portions are large.   Overall, OK experience but good enough to bring kids for the Cheesecakes. :)"
Brian V.,"Burlington, MA",1,36,,4.0,6/6/2013,"Pretty good.  Known for big portions, but I like quality over quantity, so it doesn't get five stars.   Like the strawberry smoothie"
Anne W.,"Los Angeles, CA",566,1678,622,1.0,6/1/2008,"Why oh why does anybody EVER wait in line for this place?   This place has the longest line.. to get a table.. you need to wait AN HOUR.  Then you sit down and notice.. wow, the menu has all these ads.    And then you wonder how much they are making off of that.  As for the Cheesecake... good I suppose.  I try to avoid eating it after seeing the nutrition info on it. The food.. sucks.  I think out of the four of us.. I had the best dish (which was Shephard's Pie).  That's not a compliment.  And another thing that bugs me... why is food here lukewarm instead of hot?  Almost makes me think that the food is microwaved.  I guess that wouldn't surprise me. Never never again.  Maybe the hour wait is supposed to make the food taste better."
Wally C.,"Natick, MA",20,124,66,2.0,9/11/2010,"I keep visiting this chain with an open mind and hungry all the time, last time i ordered the wasabi crusted tuna, rare, what they brough out was an over cooked slab of fish with a green paste on top of it that resembled vomit, i taste it anyway, since i did not want to seem rude, and it tasted worse than it looked, DO NOT ORDER, Stick with the cheesecakes that are out of this world... very disappointed, service was dismal..."
Mike D.,"Medford, MA",31,239,,4.0,8/22/2012,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory location more than 10 times.  The food is always good, the service is on point, and its a good spot to get eats when you are shopping.  WIth a extensive menu for brunch, lunch, or dinner its pretty much great all the time.  It does get very busy so its best to try to come in off-times!!"
Barb M.,"Tewksbury, MA",7,99,25,3.0,7/23/2010,"Aside from the looong waits if you go at any normal dinner time, the food is quite good. I especially like their salads and my all-time favorite dinner dish is the chicken costoletta. The other thing I absolutely love is the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. They have a HUGE menu that is sure to have something you are in the mood for. Their Sunday brunches are good as well. Funny thing is, I rarely get their cheesecake, even though it is really good and they have tons of flavors. The other thing I don't like about the atmosphere (aside from the long waits) is that they stuff you into little tables that are right on top of each other. So unless you request a booth (and then you are in for an even longer wait), you have little to no privacy."
Marcy K.,"Chelmsford, MA",59,342,1,4.0,9/12/2009,"After doing some errands in the area, we put our name on the list at the Cheesecake Factory and then headed to the LL Bean store about 3 miles away. Got back in an hour, just in time to feel that pager shake. Great timing.  The place was hopping, and it wasn't really that late. This location is huge, and since they know the wait is usually long, management has designed benches into the decor, and there are also comfy seats right near Macy's entrance. I've never had a drink here, but there's a nice bar near the front, and of course, a huge take-out area packed with every type of cheesecake imaginable as well as bottles of the place's salad dressings and BBQ sauce for purchase. When we sat down, the waitress brought us fresh, warm, and yummy whole wheat bread. Our server was very pleasant and helpful and recommended the beef ribs, which turned out to be an excellent choice. I was hesitant about ordering pricey ribs here, but Mr. K said they were better than almost any others he has had (he only ate 1/2 his order and will finish the rest tomorrow). The sides were French fries and onion rings, both as crisp as my husband likes them to be. I ordered an omelette with cheese, avocado, peppers, and mushroom, with a side of so-so home fries; I took home 3/4 of my entree, but am not sure it will be good tomorrow.  You can't come to this place without ordering a slice of the establishment's namesake, so we brought home a slice of chocolate coconut cream cheesecake for later. Much later. I took a peek and then took a micro-forkful, and am happy to say we made a good choice: The bottom layer tastes like a Mounds candy bar. Wow!   I'm surprising myself with the number of stars I'm awarding, but I have to go with four: Nothing really bad. Wasn't even noisy, and no one was bumping into me. Edited 9/13: The omelette was just as good today as it was yesterday...and I STILL didn't finish it. Edited 9/14: Mr. K finished my omelette this morning and said it was delicious."
Daniel M.,"Boston, MA",15,17,,2.0,12/1/2011,"REDUCE YOUR MENU!!!! This thing is absolutely ridiculous, It's like the bible of food, way to long and leaves you utterly confused. There is no need to have over 100 food options to choose from especially when they're all mediocre dishes.  I went on a Wednesday night and waited 45 minutes only to be seated next to a bat shit crazy woman who was slamming martinis, while gracefully hammering her cowering and completely frightened partner with obscenities that wouldn't cross the lips of a homeless crackhead with tourettes syndrome. Thankfully, after the third martini she decided to bail on the bill, only to leave her punching bag completely pounded, deflated and about $70 in the hole. I've never seen such a display at a restaurant and honestly don't understand how management didn't remove her from the premises. So yeah, the seating is awful, it's like you're having a big family dinner with every looney tune that escaped the nut house.  Good thing I looked at the menu online or I would have never been able to order. I got the grilled wasabi crusted, Ahi tuna served on a bed of white rice with a veggie medley. The food was A-Ok, the Tuna was cooked really well and the rice and veggies were tasty (maybe a little too much butter on the rice). Needless to say, I got cheesecake to go.  Service was fine, nothing special.  Go here if you had a long day at the mall and don't mind paying a little extra for food that deserves to cost a little less."
Mitch F.,"East Bridgewater, MA",23,51,1,4.0,6/2/2010,"I want to give it 3 stars. SOO badly.  Let me give the bad before the good.  It's very loud, there were a ton of people there. It was actually very difficult for me to understand the waiter. I've got a slight hearing impairment, so it was very difficult to hear and everything wasn't clear. Good thing that I can read lips to a moderate extent. It was also very crowded, physically crowded. I was pretty close to the person next to me in the chairs that we were sitting in. It would have been better with a booth, especially because one opened up the second that we were seated. The wait wasn't terrible, maybe 5 minutes - but this was on a Tuesday night. Expect high waits on the weekends, I would recommend calling alead for a reservation. I'm not even sure they take reservations.  Now the good, or great. The food was really good, almost excellent.  The only thing that I got was the charbroiled steak, done medium.  The outside of the steak was just that, charbroiled - just the way that I like it. It wasn't seared to a crisp, the outside flavor of the steak was a perfect compliment to the inner meat. In addition, they put perhaps an herb butter on top of the a small section of the steak, which I thought would ruin it. In fact, it enhanced the flavor further and I only wished that the entire steak was covered in it. They left the fat in the plate, and must have done something - perhaps blended it with spices, because when I tried dipping a piece of steak into it, the flavor was excellent. I throughly enjoyed the steak, one of the bests that I've ever had.  It also came with french fries and onion rings (2 of them). The onion rings were nothing special and didn't particularly have much flavor. The french fries were excellent, perfectly seasoned with salt. They remind me of the ""diesel fries"" at Worcester D.C. at UMass Amherst, which are - surprisingly - some of the best french fries I've ever had. Top notch. Location is great, right off of 128 in Burlington at the Burlington Mall.  For that matter, even though it was very difficult to understand the waiter, he was a very competent waiter. He knew a ton about the menu and gave some terrific suggestions.  My friends all said that their meals were excellent and got: a BBQ chicken pizza, club sandwich and a garlic chicken pasta dinner. The portions were humungous, the club sandwich was outrageous - perhaps a foot long.  The BBQ chicken pizza was a little more reasonable in size, as was my steak.  This was my first time here, so maybe it was just a good experience. When I go back, I'll post an update. The prices were ok, my steak was $20 - but a generous portion of the steak as well as a nice helping of fries made the meal much more worth it.  The sodas were about $3, but that was for 3 of them - so I guess that's ok.  I didn't get any cheesecake, but how can you with such big portions?  Cactus Approved."
Adam B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",59,187,35,4.0,5/3/2012,"I met some friends here for dinner while I was in town on business. I ordered Fettucini Alfredo with peas (custom).  For your reference, peas are delicious in alfredo sauce.  They did what I asked, and the Alfredo sauce was nice and creamy. They even put fresh parm on it.   To drink I had strawberry lemonade, which was delightfully sugary.  I was only there once, but my visit was short and sweet.  Parking can be a bitch, as this is in a busy mall, but other than that .. it was a good dinner!"
Brian G.,"Charlestown, MA",4,12,1,4.0,12/21/2009,"Sunday morning at the Cheesecake Factory? I know - you don't think of the Cheesecake Factory as a breakfast joint but surprise, surprise, they actually serve breakfast all day, every day.  Since Sunday had a significant snow, there were no lines-no waiting at noon. After being seated quickly, it was right to checking out the menu for breakfast stuff. They had a limited assortment of breakfast food but the fact that they serve it all day is a plus in my book. If you like pancakes, you'll be out of luck. I ordered the french toast (which you can get plain or with strawberries) plain with 2 eggs over hard and very crispy bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly. The french toast (3 slices, halved) were heavenly - fluffy, almost fried dough-eske - cooked golden brown. After the eggs and bacon, I could only finish 3 half slices of the toast - almost a crime to not devour them all on the spot but they made a great dessert late the same night in the microwave with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. Overall, service was friendly and quick. The food was great and the atmosphere was good. If you're hungry for breakfast any time of the day, remember the Cheesecake Factory as an alternative to your favorite greasy spoon."
J M.,"Boston, MA",6,167,21,4.0,7/28/2012,"Great as all the rest-gets really busy in the supper hour, better give it some extra time."
