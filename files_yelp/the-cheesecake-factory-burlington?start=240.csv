Chaos M.,"Iowa City, IA",4,115,1,4.0,7/23/2012,Cheesecake Factory is definitely better than other American Food restaurants.
Chu C.,"Belmont, MA",9,112,42,4.0,9/17/2009,"This location is very much like all Cheesecake Factories: loud and crowded, kind of pricey but huge portions to make up for it. Don't go here during peak hours if you actually have important stuff to discuss, because you can't hear anything. Because it's attached to the Burlington Mall, it's even more busy than some locations, and parking is terrible on weekends and holiday season. To make up for the busyness of it, this location is REALLY BIG. Still, typical wait time during meal hours here is 30 to 90 minutes, though our party of 12 got seated in 15-20 on Sunday night. If you're shopping at the mall, put your name on the list, then go out and do your shopping. They do have take out parking spots where they can bring the food out to you, but even those can get filled up at times! Best stuff here is on the appetizer menu: Thai lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Luau salad is always great, and you can't really go too wrong with their big and eclectic menu. Only bad item I've ever had was the Cajun something pasta. Lots of comfort food in there. For dessert, if you're sick of the cheesecake, try the strawberry shortcake, which is really good too."
Francisca W.,"Boston, MA",128,470,1014,4.0,1/25/2010,"no matter what day or what time of day you go, there is always a line.  minimum wait time: 10 minutes.  but once seated, things are not bad.  food and service are pretty consistent.  managed to sneak in dessert in rare occasions; don't think i miss much not having it.  maybe just not my cup of tea. :)"
Janiye B.,"Winchester, MA",76,22,1,5.0,7/19/2013,"Taking a toddler out to eat can be a challenge at times, but cheesecake factory manged to do a wonderful job at making our son happy, and the food was great , so I have to give them 5 stars. We were greeted with a smile by the hostsses, and asked if we preferred outside or in. Though they were busy at the time, it wasnt longer than 15 min for our table to be ready. Our waitress ( so sorry cant remember her name) but she was wonderful. She brought over a palte of fruit and cut up bread for our son, which kept him happy until his meal arrived and we loved her for that. Our meals were great, We had a chicken sandwich and the farfalle with mushroom and cream sauce . As always the portions are HUGE so we took the rest to go. She even brought our son a scoop of ice cream and we enjoyed the tirimisu which was delicious. After this visit we have come back several times and always receive great service  :) Keep up the great work and thank you for the wonderful service."
Catherine N.,"Fairfield, CT",1,98,,2.0,8/25/2013,Went last nite.  Food not great and waitress completely messed up order (there were only 5 if us)
Al D.,"Boston, MA",39,19,8,1.0,11/26/2012,Food was OK service was lousy. We sat at the bar only to watch the bar staff eat while they gossiped about something. Of course while ignoring the patrons. For the average cost of a plate of food the service should match. If the Bar staff cares so little about people eating then they should opt to not serve food.
Mark T.,"Chandler, AZ",409,574,963,2.0,5/30/2011,"The food was fine; fairly standard experience there. The aspect of this visit that stood out the most was the incredibly slow service.  A friend in my party ordered Coke Zero and upon refill noticed it was Root Beer.  The waiter eventually showed up again and she told him it was the incorrect drink. She said she would keep it because she was thirsty (due to his slow response time). He acknowledged the error and said it was the second time he did that today. Other tables seemed to move more quickly. My friend and I said we were splitting a cheesecake. In most circles that means one cheese cake and two forks.  He brought us two plates each with a sliver of cheesecake. It would seem that it was one piece sliced in half, but in comparison to a third friend who ordered a piece unto herself, our halves seemed smaller. What if we wanted to do it Lady & the Tramp style? And he didn't bring new utensils with the cheesecake.  I also didn't like the way he snatched the menu from in front of me, showed it to the table beside me, then he put it back in front of me when we were deciding on cheesecake.  Other little things were annoying such as taking picking up the bill from in front of me and beside the friend on my right (who had a separate check) and when he returned he put them both on the opposite side of the table. Didn't your mama teach you to put things back where you found them? The waiter focused on other tables more than ours. The one next to us turned over twice. As busy as the restaurant was and as many people we waiting I would think he would move a little quicker. All in all it was a lackluster experience at an overpriced establishment. Certainly the bottom rung of my prior Cheesecake Factory experiences."
Kate G.,"Essex, MA",49,327,16,4.0,11/9/2009,"Cheesecake is a no fail as far as food and people. Where this location lacks though is a nice area to relax except on nice days when you can hang out on their patio while you wait for a table otherwise everyone is made to either wait outside in the busy, crowded mall or in a long dark hallway. Not the most pleasant way to start a meal especially if you have to wait.  Other than this the people here are awesome, the food is always top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful. And of course they have wonderful cheesecake in so many different varieties! yummo!"
Evan L.,"Reading, MA",3,25,2,3.0,2/25/2010,"Their food is not as expensive as people say it is. You get the 'tons of fun burger', or the Cuban sandwich, both meals are like 9-11 dollars. There are plenty of others like that, too. Sure, you can get some steak or something and it might cost a few dollars more than most places... but it's really not that outrageous. The first thing I always hear people say about this place is ""it's so expensive"". It really is not.  You pick whether you get an expensive meal or not, it's not like you order and then get some ridiculously high bill.... the menu says the prices right on it. I would not go there too drink -- that is a bit pricey. It is not Chilis or Applebee's or something. It is loud, always packed, and I don't really like the seating arrangements. Their food, however, is outstanding. Their portions are large, and for me, who is a big big eater who wants a lot of food, this eliminates needing an appetizer, especially with the bread they give you. You get a water or a soda and a 10 dollar meal and you can give the server a big 'ol tip for under 15 bucks! that is not expensive to me. Expect the food to take a bit when it is busy, which, is always."
Jay E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,549,6,4.0,11/29/2011,"A solid Cheesecake Factory location.  As always the staff is friendly, restaurant is clean and well maintained, and the food is always consistently tasty.  We ordered a cheese omelet and their chicken picatta.  Both were served piping hot and tasted delicious.  Only complaint is the service can be slow at times due to how busy this place gets.  Highly recommend."
Scott R.,"Hampton, NH",0,16,,3.0,6/11/2011,"I've been to a few Cheescake factories. There was nothing that really jumped out here. I had the chicken Thai noodle bowl. There was plenty of bowl, and noodles, but the chicken flew the coop just a few bites. The overall flavor was good, and as always, the cheesecake doesn't suck."
Victoria M.,"Raymond, NH",52,74,10,3.0,2/18/2009,"It pains me to write this review, it really does.  Why you ask... because out of all the times we have been to any Cheesecake Factory this was the worst experience thus far.  Who cares some may say, its a chain.  Yea but the food is always consistently good.   Back to this experience...  We show up for an anniversary lunch (9 years together, oh boy) around 12:30 expecting a wait.  They tell us it will be approximately 40 minutes.  Which was what I assumed given the large crowd in the foyer.   We decided we would walk the mall and come back in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes pass by, and we walk back.  Much to our delight the buzzer goes off.  We are thinking, 'excellent, a bit earlier than expected!'  Not so lucky.  We walk in, hand them the buzzer, and they tell us to stand over there, someone would seat us shortly.  What is that?  Don't beep me early if you aren't seating me right then and there.  Sorry but we have a 2 year old that has the attention span of a puppy.  So not cool. We wait another 15 minutes and are finally seated.  Our waitress (I forget her name) took our drink orders, and disappeared.  She came back about 20 minutes later with 2 cokes, and a milk.  It wasn't liquor, what took so long?!  I ask for a kid's menu, they don't have one.  So she starts to ramble on about what they offer for children.  I order the baby girl chicken fingers, and fries.  The man orders the soup de jour.   Another 20 minutes pass by, bread is brought out, along with the soup, and the baby girls meal.  Mind you at this time a woman and child is seated next to us (this will come up later).  She then takes our meal orders.  We both decided on dishes off of the Specials Menu.  And she leaves. Well we wait, and we wait, and we wait some more for our food.  It finally finds its way to our table.  At which point baby girl is in complete melt down mode.  She is tired, and cranky.  All she wants is a nap.  She never asks for a nap.  At this point we notice the people next to us (the woman and child) receive their meals!!!!  WTFFF????!!!!  We are both irritated at this point.  We waited almost an hour for our meals and they get theirs in 15 minutes.  Do you see something wrong with that?  I do. Needless to say our anniversary lunch was cut very short by the cranky 2 year old.  So we had our meals boxed up and we left.  I did have mine for dinner tonight while at work.  It was delicious (even when reheated).  It was spaghetti in a creamy pesto sauce with Parmesan encrusted chicken, prosciutto, and mixed greens.  Very yummy! Will we be back to this Cheesecake, probably not.  But we haven't ruled our Cheesecake all together.  Maybe the one in Providence will be better."
george k.,"Dracut, MA",18,81,,2.0,8/31/2010,"What a place. It reminds me of American cars from the eighties and nineties. Big boats with bad engineering and cheap plastic. American cars are much better today, especially Fords  but The Cheesecake Factory still is in a bad shape. Does anybody taste the dishes there when they create them?"
Fred S.,"Newton, MA",2,19,,2.0,5/18/2012,"I had lunch here the other day - not my first experience. The food is ok. The servers are very pleasant. The service could be a lot better. The place gets very crowded, but they know it will be crowded so the ought to be able to keep up. Or is it just a ploy to get us to buy appetizers. The food is always ample, so otherwise I would never consider an appetizer.  This time I ordered the meatloaf sandwich. It was tasty enough, but very greasy. The meatloaf was served between 2 slices of brioche. But the brioche was saturated with fat (maybe butter) - it wasn't brushed on, it was poured on. I didn't finish, and the thing still sat like a dead weight in my stomach. I actually skipped dinner that night."
Kevin B.,"Woburn, MA",2,49,2,3.0,11/21/2011,"In general, I am a fan of this chain. This weekend, I ventured beyond my regular orders, and tried a chipotle chicken pasta dish, which was slightly disappointing. Bread is good, service (Amanda? maybe) was very attentive -  Pet peeve --- plastic water glasses. Will try again, but may return to some of my favorites and the chipotle dish wasn't so ""hot"""
M R.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,5.0,3/7/2014,"Great food, very nice place. A lot of food for the price. Love it. The people is very good and animated.  It was a some what crowded,  but the food made up for it."
Steph A.,"Methuen, MA",2,36,59,4.0,2/3/2014,"I have been here a number of times and I have never had a bad experience. The food here is delicious, all the way from the drinks to the famous cheesecake. A lot of people complain about the prices but honestly go for lunch the prices are very reasonable. You pay for what you receive and it's worth the money. The menu is literally a book with so many different options, even the picky eaters should be able to find something to eat. The drinks are very delicious and they have a great selection from margaritas all the way to martinis. I love their small plates opposed to the apps because they are a little smaller but still very filling. They also have a menu that's less calories which is always a great option for people looking for a lighter dish. Of course to top it all off you have to get the cheesecake. They have a ton of different options but you really can't go wrong with any. You can also get them to go which is a great option. The only downside about this restaurant is the fact that almost every time I have been I have had to wait for a table. The wait staff is extremely well trained and can answer pretty much an question you might have. GO here, it's great."
David C.,"Lexington, MA",0,11,,1.0,10/14/2014,My experience at the chessecake factory was nothing short of terrible it started with having to wait one hour for a table I waited because I thought it would be good well the first knife in our back was after waiting a hour we got a table right next to the bathroom I could deal with that but then we had a halfwit for a waitress who knew shit about the menu my gf got a glass of wine and because the halfwit was do busy she was walking by and slid it on the table and fell on my gf's stomach and on her beautiful dress she gave us a other one for free but when my gf went to clean up in the bathroom there was no paper towels so she had to sit though dinner in a wine stained dress then we finally ordered dinner my gf got chicken parm and we got it and there was no chesse on it so we had to track down the halfwit waitress to sprinkle some chesse on it then i got a hamburger and they gave me lobster roll so I had to wait another 20 minutes for that shit to come out so it has been two hours and all I got was hard bread and a wine stained gf so my hamburger finally came out it was grainy I stuffed it down cause I was so dam hungry so this nice manager came over after eating and took one of our meals off which was nice and gave us a free desert So we got a pumpkin pie chessecake it tasted like processed market basket shit for 2.99 it was free but still terrible so finally got the bill gave the halfwit two wrinkled dollars I found in my pocket and walking out she stepped on my toe bring food to somebody else just a careless bitch and a terrible place to eat
Busy L.,"Methuen, MA",3,332,1,2.0,9/6/2011,This location seems to have gone downhill.  I've also noticed the portion sizes have been greatly reduced and consistency of food and service below average. Our server was not very good at all.  Asked for coffee refill and just brings one rather than bringing refills for the rest of the tables.  Had to ask and then he brings.  The other tables were also annoyed with his lack of common sense... Food was average at best.  Rice on the dishes were lukewarm and tasted as if it was cooked in the morning and continue to serve after hours in the warmer.  Someone in the party ordered pancakes and syrup wasn't served.  Had to ask and by the time syrup arrived the pancakes were cold.
Eric B.,"Charles Town, WV",244,150,33,2.0,10/7/2011,"Had dinner yesterday with some friends. I was sorely disappointed!  I've eaten at this location before and it was pretty good. Yesterday started ok, the apps were good, but once the main course came the tides turned!  The food was not so good to say the least!  It did finish on a high note, the cheesecake was good."
