Leo F.,"Arlington, MA",39,628,381,3.0,10/14/2011,"I thought this place was decent.  The atmosphere was dark and sort of romantic.  The wait for a table tended to be long (20 - 40 minutes) but that's because this place was always so crowded when we visited.  The food seemed pretty standard and quite filling.  Of course, the specialty of this place should be the cheesecake and that has yet to disappoint."
Jim S.,"Arlington, MA",1,100,1,2.0,9/25/2008,"This place is the quintessential corporate-run chain restaurant.  It is loud, impersonal (everything the waitstaff says has clearly been preprogrammed), crowded, and mediocre. Don't get me wrong. I don't avoid chain restaurants per-se.  Many provide an important function of OK food for a reasonable price at a reasonable distance.   But  what in this place is attracting people willing to wait OVER 2 HOURS in some cases for a table?   The menu is the size of a small town telephone book, containing literally hundreds of items from every cuisine on the planet - italian, chinese, american, mexican, thai, etc.  How can an unskilled kitchen produce all these dishes quickly unless they are pre-packaged and/or microwaved?    It's just not possible, there would have to be dozens of highly-trained chef in a kitchen 5 times larger than the one they have.   It just can't be at under $20 prices. The signature cheesecake desserts come in about 200 varieties.  You think these are all lovingly prepared from scratch using different recipes for each one?  Wrong.  They all taste the same, and very, very ordinary at that. For this people wait TWO HOURS????"
Ruben B.,"Hudson, MA",96,23,,3.0,11/6/2009,"We ended up waiting for 45 minutes until we got a table.  They didn't have a decent waiting area for the 20 or so customers that waited for a table.  This company needs to sign up with Open Table. On the positive side, the Kobe burger I ordered was outstanding and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had at a restaurant."
Dave Y.,"Norwood, MA",0,26,1,3.0,2/11/2010,"Its good, but not great.  Like every other reviewer said - waay to loud and crowded. I think if you have a large group this is the place to go. But for a more intimate experience, try something else.  The menu is huge and there is a lot to choose from, but then the food all tastes the same. Wait staff is generally good.  Try the chicken madeira or the grilled salmon. They are the best choices. And for dessert- the apple crisp or any other cheesecake is worth its while."
Ken M.,"Boston, MA",0,19,,1.0,3/2/2014,"1 Major Deduction....the wait.  I don't feel good about taking away 1 star because of the wait time as I feel like I'm holding the popularity, the price, and the quality of the food and service against The Cheesecake Factory. The wait time was colossal (75-90 minutes on a Sat. at 5pm sharp) and I really wanted to hate the place, but....I ordered the Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   Not dry and stringy.  Not too undercooked, raw or greasy.  Not prefrozen, but fresh. The spaghettini was perfectly done, not too hard, not mushy. The portion was good, although I'm being greedy when I wish I had an extra piece of chicken.   It was 17 bucks, but they could have charged a buck or two more for the quality....might also discourage some of the troglodytes and mallrats if they jacked up the price a little. The only thing that hurts this place are the patrons.   I'm not above everyone that eats there, but when the wait times creep up to 3 hours and you have people fighting over a bench in the waiting area because they've been standing for so long, it takes away from the pleasantness of dining out, and the ambiance of a 'nice' night out at a 'fancy' restaurant. Update - I'll never go here again.  ""It takes years to gain a customer, seconds to lose one.""  The hostess actually made an effort to upset our party.  We went on an off-peak time for dinner, and asked if we needed one of the beepers.  The response from the Hostess was that the wait will be less than 5 minutes and to just wait to the side and she'll get us a table almost immediately.  From there, things quickly went south; I would have been ok with a 5, 10, 15, even a 20 minute wait, but, after nearly 30 minutes later, and party after party after party getting seated ahead of us, I decided to speak up.  I wasn't impolite, but received a reaction like I had just insulted a dignitary.  She told us that ""those people were waiting outside and were here before [us].""  Liar liar pants on fire!  Would it have been that hard to admit that you forgot us by mistake? That's not the end of it, though.  As if to punish me for having the audacity to question her, she then proceeded to let in several other parties that came in (like most of the others that were let in ahead of us that came in after us) from the parking lot. After close to 10 more minutes, another member of my party spoke up, and was given the same line and this time they were challenged.  I intervened, told them to forget about it, that we were leaving. Went to Buffalo Wild Wings (haven't reviewed them yet....TL;DR - Food was pretty bad, but the service was lovely!).  I wrote a letter to the corporate office about that particular staff member, and as of several weeks after this incident, no response from them. You guys win.  I won't go back."
Mel L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",127,190,525,3.0,4/29/2011,"A chain restaurant that surprises me with great tasting, large portioned meals. The prices are a little on the high side, but most of the salads and entrees are big enough for two (sometimes three) people! My favorite dishes are the Chicken and Biscuits (chicken breasts and country biscuits smothered in gravy and mashed potatoes, mushrooms, peas, and carrots) and the French Country Salad (mixed greens with grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, pecans, and Vinaigrette). They're both so filling that I never have room for the cheesecake! I would have rated it 4 stars instead of 3, but they don't take call-ahead names or reservations! The wait can be 1-2 hours -plus driving time- on busy nights and weekends. I've actually seen guests sitting on the floor while waiting for a table because the lobby was too overcrowded. Also, the service is painfully slow and I've heard stories about waitstaff being rude to customers for sharing food."
Spanky G.,"Malden, MA",0,20,,3.0,1/8/2012,"Usually very crowed. My wife loves the chicken madeira and daughter loves to go here as well. I have had many menu items, meatloaf is pretty good, but a caesar salad alone (no chicken etc) was 12.00.  Split a piece of the 700 calorie cheesecake which is worth going off diet once in a while. way too many options when I go there I cant decide what to get, but always something different."
Leachim S.,"Nashua, NH",125,137,33,5.0,3/19/2013,"It is unconfirmed but I Believe they also have this Restaurant in Heaven!  Just might be my favorite restaurant on the planet Earth!  This place is really great.... The menu is by far the most extensive menu of any restaurant that I have ever been to.  If you can't find something on their menu that you truly enjoy, you need to put on your glasses.  They have everything from healthy options to hearty options to even breakfast options all day long.  Steak, Seafood, Chicken- Everything!  Needless to say... Their Cheesecake is Amazing!  If this was just a ""Cheesecake"" Factory, they would deserve 5 Stars- But they are so much more.  The only couple of negatives that I can think of would be... Very noisy at times (But when something is as good as this place, it's understandable that their would be a lot of excitement!).  There seems to be an extensive wait at certain times (Again- Understandable- Given the Amazing Food!).  For the amount of money you pay at the Cheesecake Factory relative to other restaurants, you get waaayyy more for your money.  I have never left here hungry!  I recommend the Factory Nachos for an appetizer- Basically the best Nachos in the world.... Huge portion that will easily satisfy up to 5 people... loaded with Spicy Chicken!  Then a great dinner option would be the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta... AMAZING! The flavor will make your mouth do jumping jacks!  Loaded with Shrimp and Chicken over a bed of Linguine with sauteed vegetables.  Just sit back and enjoy!  For Dessert... You really can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes.  Take your time and read all the ingredients and you will find one you fall in love with.  They will even split a piece on 2 dishes if you are too full to finish an entire slice.  Really great food and really great service... You will not be disappointed!- I Promise!"
Young K.,"Middlesex County, MA",47,83,5,1.0,12/24/2011,Yuck !  Everything was so salty. Menu needs to be reduced as reviewer Mr. Daniel M said. Bigger is not always better.
Cameron W.,"Merrimack, NH",9,92,2,3.0,7/5/2011,"I've been to a few other Cheesecake Factories besides this one, and this one is consistent to the others.  As other reviewers said, parking is a challenge because of the limited mall parking.  And it usually is a long wait for a table.  The menu is more like a book (a little too big in my opinion).  So whatever you're in the mood for, they probably have it.  The portions are ridiculously big.  I dare you to finish your meal if you're ordering anything other than an appetizer.  I believe I ordered the chicken marsala once and the Mahi Mahi mediterranean.  Both weren't bad.  The drinks were a little watered down, though, on both occasions."
Matthew E.,"Washington, DC",4,11,,3.0,9/14/2008,"Went here this evening after training class with 7 coworkers (4 international).  Arrived and was greeted nicely by the staff.  Quoted a 2 hour wait for 8 people, but we were able to get seated at 2 adjacent tables in less than 5 minutes by splitting our group into 2 groups of 4. The waitress arrived and was very pleasant and bubbly but not annoying.  Got our beer and took orders in a timely fashion.  Was patient with the international guys as they asked questions and jovial with reproducing their accents. Beer came. Cold. Delicious and unfortunately not in the bottomless cup format. I ordered the thai lettuce wraps and some asparagus on the side.  Lettuce wraps were a little better than average, asparagus was undercooked and cut at the ends instead of snapped resulting in some stalky pieces.  After dinner we all ordered different types of cheesecake and the international guys loved it, it was average for me.  Also ordered a capacino instead of another beer (mistake), arrived luke warm, asked them to warm it up, instead of steaming it they microwaved it, cup and drink came back scalding hot, too hot to drink, by the time it cooled down we were leaving. Overall food was decent, service was great.  There are much better places to eat around here, but worth a shot if you'd like to go out and never been to a cheesecake factory before."
Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,3.0,7/13/2008,"Solid CF. If I'm in the Burlington neighborhood and craving the grilled shrimp and bacon club, I'll definitely drop by. Went there once and left a flirtatious note on the receipt for our waiter. He didn't bite, but he still got a decent tip. Didn't notice til later that he didn't include my salsa and guac in my quesadilla's doggie bag! Now, I think this is standard across all Cheesecake's, so I won't judge too harshly, but come on! For 15 bucks, I wanted those toppings! Bummer."
Julie A.,"Arlington, MA",61,456,5,3.0,7/15/2008,"this one is liek all the other cheesecake factories. the one good thing you can say aboutthe company is they have their consistancey down pat! The people watching is a little more dull here as it's mostly suburban families....b-o-r-i-n-g!  (oh no, now, I am one of them) yes, I come here because if my baby cries (though hasn't happened yes, nock on wood) no one hears her over the noise, there is a stroller parking lot, the food is decent and is almost cheap if you consider it will last you 1-2 more meals in left overs. as always their steak isn't half bad, fish tacos get a little soggy but are good besides that. the brunch is pretty good too. mind you this is all over a chain restaurant that is not fine dining, specialty foods, or anything super interesting."
pattie f.,"Woburn, MA",0,8,,5.0,1/12/2014,I normally don't order burgers as I am not a big beef eater. However I ordered the Kobe burger and I have to say that it was by far the best burger that I have ever had. Try it...you won't be disappointed!
Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",108,494,38,4.0,11/13/2008,"Wowzzzer... When isn't this place busy? You're an exception if you only had to wait half an hour for a table for two. Originally I was not a fan of the idea of overly simplified all-in-one American ""cuisine"" under one roof, but lately I have come around. It might be because I am a complete suburbanite and/or I go out with workmates often enough to realize how difficult it is to decide on a lunch locale everyone can enjoy. Last time I went, my husband had the marsala-like chicken with its 3 heaping piles of mashed potatoes and some asparagus while I dined on my soup du jour, salad and half sandwich that could have fed a village in Vietnam for the day. Surprisingly we finished our plates. Not quite sure if that was a good or bad thing. Let's say most people leave with a doggie bag. We were little piglets that evening. Overall, the atmosphere was interesting and a step above Chili's. The food was decent for a dinner out of the house. And of course, cheesecake is their specialty."
Dee L.,"Andover, MA",3,95,,5.0,6/12/2011,"Always a perfect end to a day of shopping. Service is always excellent, food is good (menu is like 5437 pages), and they have something for everyone! I've never seen a menu with so many different options and styles of food (American, Italian, Thai, Mexican, Mediteranean, etc). And there aren't many places who offer freshly squeezed lemonade and iced green tea...Mmmm!"
Adrianna V.,"London, United Kingdom",16,50,21,3.0,3/8/2013,My friend was visiting a USA and she couldn't buy a drink because she didn't have American ID ... Food was ok
Sameer P.,"Burlington, MA",2,28,,4.0,9/20/2008,"The food here is solid, so the current 2.5 stars that Yelpers have given the restaurant is unfair but then again Yelpers don't like giving good reviews to chains. As everyone knows, you get a large menu and large quantities at the factory. And of course the cheesecake is great. Note that the wait time at this location is crazy even by cheesecake factory standards."
Di B.,"Boston, MA",1,22,,4.0,5/28/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, so it seems. Be it the food, dessert or service. This location is no different, and I have been several times now..so consistency has been key."
Mark W.,"Boston, MA",481,394,232,4.0,1/5/2011,I like the super extensive menu and great service and the cheese cakes rock!
