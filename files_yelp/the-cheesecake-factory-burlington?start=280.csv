Double D D.,"Boston, MA",16,45,,2.0,7/7/2011,"I don't get what the big hype about this place is. I'm still trying to figure it out after every visit, which is 3 BTW.  The novelty has not worn out yet and I don't get what people think good food is. Cocktails are great, i'd go there just for that.  Can't understand why people would wait 2 hours + to eat dinner.  It's crowded, loud, full of screaming kids (school break or not) it's always full of kids (???). Waitstaff is rushing you, food is just gross. Menu is very overwhelming. Big disgusting portions, shall I continue??????  As I'm getting older i've noticed that I prefer small, intimate, quiet eateries.  Families of 10 can keep this place................"
Tim C.,"Wakefield, MA",0,24,4,2.0,9/19/2008,"Went for lunch today with my wife.  I had a Cuban Sandwich, decent but not great.  My wife's sandwich was OK as well. Unfortunately I ordered a ""Strawberry Lemonade"" which was almost undrinkable.  It was so sweet I could have washed it down with a huge glass of Kool-Aid."
Nikki L.,"Bedford, MA",0,7,,3.0,10/1/2011,I like this restaurant and have been here many times.  I wish the wait was not always so long.  Went here for lunch today and the food was amazing.  Our waitress seemed like she was in a bad mood but oh well.  I would return.
Tori G.,"Lawrence, MA",97,51,52,1.0,5/7/2007,"I WANT to love the Cheesecake Factory and I just CAN'T.  Whenever I go, and wherever I go to (Burlington Mall, the Pru, Chestnut Hill) there is always a ridiculously long wait.  And for what?? The food at all three of these locations has been ehhh, but nothing special. This is if you can finally decide on what to order. I think the menu is about 15 pages long, including advertisements. Have they ever heard of there being TOO many options? I'm a pretty decisive person, but get that Cheesecake Factory menu in front of me and I'm lost among all of the choices. From meatloaf to fish tacos, tri-colored pasta with spicy Thai peanut sauce to pizza, they have something for everyone, but sometimes that's not a good thing.... The decor is always beautiful, gorgeous light fixtures, high ceilings, lots of plants, I can't complain there. But the backbone of any restaurant is the food, and the Cheesecake Factory just doesn't deliver. I think their motto is ""quantity, not quality.""  And the cheesecake, it's fine. Nothing to write home about. Sorry if people don't agree, but that's just been my experience with this restaurant."
jen s.,"Boston, MA",0,17,,2.0,9/25/2011,"I would like to first throw it out there that this was a Saturday night, just around dinner time.  I realize that it was going to be crowded, and planned on that.   The food was fine, the waitstaff helpful, but it was such a mad house that it was almost to the point of ridiculousness.  Like I said, it was a fine meal, but I feel like we had to fight to get to that point of the evening- because we did.  When you have to wait 75-90 minutes for a table, you obviously will go to the bar or wait for high tops.  The issue is that it's a frenzy trying to get a high top and literally, you have to hover over people waiting for them to finish.  If you don't, forget it, you will never get one because someone else will slide right in.  You resort to asking people to give you their seat when they are done-in the hopes they finish at a reasonable pace.   I would really like to see some sort of organization in that area if the wait is that long.  Someone to be able to stand there and say ""you're next"" when a seat opens up at the bar or hightop.   Additionally, do they know the temperature in there is enough to make you shiver?  I understand the idea of keeping it cool.. but it was downright COLD.. and we had sweaters!  I was literally shivering. So, would I go back?  Yes, but NEVER ever on a Friday or Saturday night.  No reservations?  Come on!!"
Jane B.,"Stoneham, MA",70,200,16,3.0,10/20/2006,"Went here for a business lunch with a small group. We arrived around 11.30 or noon and waited only about 10-15 minutes for a table on the patio (the weather was nice). The patio provides a beautiful panorama of the Burlington Mall parking lot. Still it's nice enough to be able to enjoy the weather. Our server was nice although she disappeared for a while...refill? Guess not. Food is average. I don't get all the raves that this chain gets for its food. It's not bad but I would never wait hours for it...which I see people doing (at other locations) quite frequently. I got a sandwich and it was good, but no where near out-of-this-world.  They do have a massive menu, which is good if you've got people who want different types of food."
Brian G.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,265,20,3.0,3/6/2008,"One second you are in a suburban Massachusetts mall where you intended to be and you get a little hungry... Suddenly!, you're pulled into a portal-like hallway and sucked into a hollow world of prefabrication. The soft music, the dimmed lights, the pillars. I felt like I was in Orlando or Las Vegas.  Well anyway to make a long story short, I had some decent pasta, read my Time magazine, and had some damn good decaf lemon tea with honey while waiting for my boyfriend, so I was satisfied. The waitresses were really nice too."
Kat H.,"Beverly, MA",22,172,27,4.0,3/2/2007,"I went here for dinner on a Sunday night. The hostess said the wait was SIX HOURS. Needless to say, we did _not_ sit amongst the crying hungry children/PDA-ing couples that lined the long hallway.  What we have done then--and ever since--is grab some cheesecake from their to-go counter. After clawing our way to the waitresses and giving our order at rapid speed, we then steal away with our booty to the food court where we eat in peace. And the cheesecake? Delectable. The Best. Worth all the inconvenience in the world for one bite."
Ian C.,"Wakefield, MA",1,22,,2.0,7/31/2008,"I really hate this place.  Not because the food is bad - it's okay - but because I never get to try the cheesecake.  The portions are insultingly large and the food is engineered to clog your arteries - and that's BEFORE dessert.  Whenever I've finished my main course I always feel that adding cheesecake to the mix will take years off my life - especially since I know the portions of cheesecake are also abominably large.  I reckon a family of four could last for a week on one meal at The Cheesecake Factory, if it was spread out over seven days. Sometimes so-called 'healthy' portions are nothing of the kind, and for me, they just make me resent the whole experience.  Heck, even the appetizers are more than what I'd consider to be a full meal for two or three people.  It's just obscene. I think The Cheesecake Factory needs to embrace the concept of 'less is more'."
Charlie L.,"Tyngsboro, MA",0,34,,1.0,6/3/2007,"Nada, zip, nil, zero, nothing on their (too) huge menu is worth the wait and abuse by the management. The wait staff is generally very pleasant, perhaps because they know what you just went through to finally get to a table. Somebody needs to seriously take this place in hand and manage it!"
Meredith K.,"Somerville, MA",71,434,24,3.0,6/25/2008,"Ok it's like the Disney world of restaurants. I mean what other restaurant has a 20 page menu filled with advertisements? The menu drives me crazy. So much that I basically order the same 3 things any time I've gone here so I don't have to actually look through it. There's too much! And seriously the ads are just annoying.  But I suppose the good thing is - when you have a menu this obscenely large there's something for everyone - even if it is rather average. And when you work in the area and you friend meets you for lunch with a baby - there aren't a whole lot of choices that don't suck.  Why people wait 2 hours to come here I will never know. I mean the food is fine, but it's not amazing. Now the cheesecake on the other hand I do really love, because really how can you not love cheesecake and there's like 25 different kinds and really they are all pretty tasty. Sure you are eating your monthly caloric intake in one meal, but how often does one come here and eat cheesecake? For me it's like 2-4 times a year. What is great about this place - almost any time I've been here the wait staff is super friendly - today was no exception. In fact our waitress brought over a little plate of fresh sliced banana and sliced bread for the baby! I guess they bring that for all babies, but it was still really nice and kept him happy and occupied while we gossiped about girly stuff and ate our lunches."
CM C.,"Boston, MA",0,10,,1.0,6/6/2012,"I have never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.....mainly because their menu is so large.  There is no way their food can be fresh when you have that many selections on your meny.  I had to go to group parties at the Cheesecake over the years, various locations, and have yet to have a good meal.  It's mass production. The main reason I am writing this is because I had to plan a birthday dinner for a group of 12 and there are a lot of picky eaters and they also didn't want to spend a lot of money.   I reluctantly called Cheesecake since I knew it would have something everyone would like, even though it pained me to call to make a reservation for a Friday night.  I was told they don't take reservations or call aheads on the weekends and left it at that.  I tried to work with the host to figure out how we could make this work but she basically told me we could show up and we would probably wait and hour to an hour and a half.  Ok thanks for trying to gain my business, you just reminded me why I hate the Cheesecake Factory.  You could give a $hit if I bring my business to your restaurant. Normally I wouldn't even bother writing a review for a chain restaurant but I just felt like I need to vent after my frustrating phone call!"
Jen L.,"Nashua, NH",32,2,,2.0,8/13/2013,"Food was certainly decent,prices are a bit high, but the service on this particular visit was atrocious. My family is not high maintenance but 3 servers in one visit is a bit much. Over 10 minutes before we saw anyone and that was after we had to ask the hostess for someone. Three server changes with no visit from a manager to explain. my daughter is a server at a very nice restaurant in Boston and she was appalled that no manager ever came over.They are not allowed even one switch without a a manager visit. the last server was ok but the other two were not even the least bit interested in waiting on us. it was really disappointing."
Nausheen M.,"Boston, MA",11,44,,4.0,10/24/2006,I went there yesterday with some of my friends who also have kids.   We went there for brunch and didn't even have to wait a minute to be seated which was nice.  Our server was really cool...we were a group of about 5 adults and 3 kids but she handled our frequent needs pretty well.  The food was good...although the portions were really big so you might consider sharing.  The cakes looked so delicious but we  just didn't have any space to fit it anywhere.
Rob C.,"Boston, MA",66,443,2,3.0,6/30/2007,"For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory is decidedly odd.  Before having ever gone to one, a while ago, I kinda expected to see something that looked, well, more like a factory.  Maybe with a machine like the Krispy Kreme donut machine that made cheesecake instead.  However, I'd probably have been the only one who thought that would be cool.  I was definitely surprised by it, though.  These places look like their designer went to Vegas and decided to pick through the surplus of Caesar's, the Bellagio, and the Venetian.  Huge columns, marble, impressive lighting, and more textured-looking paint than you can shake a stick at.  It's all very nice looking, but at the same time, the artifice of it is very noticeable.   The other weird thing is their menus.  I've never seen anywhere else that has advertisements in their menus.  It's not as if it's a greasy diner with local businesses on a placemat.  surely i'd be willing to pay another quarter to not have to deal with that.  It's not a cheap place, by any means.  It's just strange that they felt that was necessary. That said, the food is usually very decent.  Decent to really good, even.  I had a really good, huge bacon cheeseburger last night.  The only downside was that they put mayonnaise on it.  I never understood why, on a sandwich that is specified to include one condiment, say, barbecue, another is added, left unmentioned.  bah.  i'm ordinarily not a fussy person, but i despise mayo.  it scraped off, though.  their menu is vast and strange, there's everything from comfort food to asian stuff, and that's kind of a broad spectrum. they also tend to have really good coke.  some restaurants have much better soda than others, and this is one of them; bonus points for prompt refills, too.   as for cheesecake, well, i don't even eat it usually.  but i hear it's all right."
JAMES S.,"Madison, ME",0,23,,5.0,9/1/2011,I love this place! Ive been 5 times this year and always had a good experiance. I would recommend this place to anyone. I go late at night so there is no wait. Lunch time is good to go too.
Vanilla P.,"Castro Valley, CA",154,1022,32,4.0,6/25/2007,"Why oh why did I think it would be a great idea to consult Weight Watchers on how many points a slice of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake would be? Now I'll never be able to order a slice of it again without feeling massive guilt attacks. An average person gets about 20 to 28 points a day, right? Well, one lovely, sweet, creamy, chocolate-y (or whatever flavor you choose) piece of cheesecake rings in at about 65 points. Now, I'm not a math genius, and I very rarely am able to figure out shit logically, but that tells me that I wouldn't be able to eat for three days after one slice of cheesecake. THat just doesn't seem right.  Other than that, their salads are great and huge, and they have a crap load of yummy appetizers to choose from. I LOVE the avocado egg rolls and southwest egg rolls so much, if they were human, I would marry them.  Great place to go when you want to commit everyone's favorite sin... Gluttony, people, GLUTTONY."
Suzanne T.,"Boston, MA",1,15,,2.0,4/24/2008,"I went here recently for a friend's birthday and it made her day worse! After ordering our meals, the waitress spills an entire mojito on my friend's dress and sweater. I understand that happens but she never took it off the bill! She also added a 22 oz beer that none of my friends had - we stuck to ritas and mojitos. When we told the waitress she sort of laughed and said ""Oh yeah, that's for the other table"".  We went on a Tuesday night and it took about 30 mins to get the check corrected and paid for! By the end, we were all exhausted and wanted to go home. The service really spoiled the night."
Kathleen M.,"Lowell, MA",18,89,3,1.0,2/25/2010,"If I could give you no stars I would! I have not had one meal that was great. The only reason I returned was because we kept getting stupid gift certificates. Thank God that has stopped. We once had to wait over an hour for a pizza because they burned it not one, not twice, but three times! Seriously?? Do I need to go back there and make the pizza myself?  They offered us free desert for the ridiculous wait and then tried to charge us for it. Ugh, this place is so overrated!  Even the free cheescake sucked!"
Lauren C.,"Lowell, MA",2,40,1,3.0,6/30/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a solid 3-star restaurant for me. The food is consistently good, though there are not many healthy options.  Portions are huge for the prices.  Drinks are tasty but overpriced.  Service has always been great when I have been there. The cheesecake is to-die-for (don't skip out on dessert when coming here!)  The menu is never-ending! It is at least 8 pages...I always look it up online first because it's overwhelming when you are there with a group. One other word of wisdom: expect to wait a while for  a table on weekend nights..."
