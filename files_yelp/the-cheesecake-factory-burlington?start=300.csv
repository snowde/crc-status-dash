Eling H.,"Fremont, CA",153,81,,4.0,6/3/2010,"If I can remember correctly, I think this is the one we went to. Wait staff totally needs improvement. Waitress took so long, omg. It was 20 minutes and we still didn't have the waitress. At this point, one of the bus guys was nice enough to help the girl out and take our orders. I ordered the chicken marsala (west coast) but it was called something else in Boston. Standard good. Nothing spectular. Had also the vanilla bean cheesecake. Really good. Anyways, when we left, we decided to tip the bus boy well because he did a great job. He catered to our need and was super nice!"
Christina S.,"Boston, MA",6,51,,3.0,3/13/2007,"With the HUGE crowds and sometimes deafening noise levels, I have to constantly ask myself... Is it worth it? Unfortunately 8 out of 10 times I have turned back due to hour or more wait times. The 2 times I actually got to eat here, it was good. The portions tend to be quite large but don't let that stop you from ordering one of their yummy desserts TO GO, like I do. It's definitely worth getting it to go while you are there, and enjoying it later when you're not so full.  The menu has so much variety that there is something for everyone in your party, but it might take you awhile to decide since it's about 10 times thicker than your average menu. If you can go during the day Monday through Friday, preferably at an off hour, then you may actually be able to have a conversation without yelling and actually enjoy the lovely ambience and a good meal. If you don't want to wait, maybe at least get one of those yummy desserts to go!  **Regarding TO GO orders:  I have NEVER picked up a to go order that wasn't screwed up.  Even the simplest of orders (2 burgers well done, 1 w/ cheese, 1 w/out, all dressing on the side) is totally screwed up.  I'm actually getting to the point where its not worth it.  Seriously, how can you screw up something so simple.... EVERY SINGLE TIME?! Minus 2 stars for huge noisy crowds, long waits, and screwing up ALL to go orders!"
Alison R.,"Londonderry, NH",0,1,,3.0,1/6/2011,"I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the location. I don't know what the managers of Burlington mall are thinking, but with the parking arrangement they set up, it took me 30 minutes just to get OUT of the parking lot at 4:00 on a Thursday. It looked like only one mall exit was open and it was total gridlock. I love CF but I will probably never go back to this one."
Carlos C.,"North Andover, MA",5,8,6,3.0,2/13/2011,"Took family there for the 1st time.  It was a Friday night and it was a 90 minute wait to get in which wasn't so bad as we had things to shop for in the mall.  The atmosphere within the restaurant was great and the service was exceptional.  Despite how hectic it was, it appeared as everyone within the establishment worked as a team to keep things moving efficiently.  That being said, we never felt rushed and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  As far as the food was concerned, we all felt that it was ""ok"" but certainly not fantastic (which was what we were all expecting).  No bad by any means but not great either.  I will say the cheesecake was out of this world and it was certainly their forte, thus the name."
Changun S.,"Methuen, MA",7,197,27,3.0,2/25/2012,food is worth it... but the wait is awful....avg: 2 hours!!!!! (and they don't take call aheads/reservations)
Kimberly B.,"San Jose, CA",104,428,25,2.0,8/18/2009,They forgot the onion strings that went on top of my Santa Fe Chicken Salad. That's like forgetting the bun for a sandwich!!!
Linda S.,"Miami, FL",0,47,,3.0,4/26/2010,"My husband and I get down this way every so often, and we recently decided to try the Cheescake Factory. We went on a Saturday night, and we were told the wait would be an hour. That was no big deal as we grabbed our beeper and went shopping! When we got our seating, we could not have been happier. The service was perfect, the food outstanding, and best of all, the bill did not break the bank. It is such a treat to have a really great dining experience in this day and age of fast food and poor customer service. Keep it up Cheescake Factory, I think I'm in love!!!!!"
David S.,"Boston, MA",38,67,17,4.0,11/12/2009,"I went for lunch two days ago with family. It wasn't really planned, it just happened to be the only area in which we could find parking at the mall (you'd never know the economy is bad by looking at the parking lot of this mall).  The first thing to catch the eye is the amazing desserts for sale at the front counter. That alone is good reason to go here.  I had a Thai chicken pasta and the rest of my party had their Evelyn's Pasta, Chicken Marsala, soup/sandwich combo, and a pasta Alfredo. All lunch-sized but the portions were so huge that we all took at least half of our meals home.  No one really NEEDED dessert but we couldn't resist splitting a Godiva choc cheesecake and a GINORMOUS carrot cake chunk that had caught our eye at the counter when we walked in.  A good looking place. Huge (I think the max occupancy sign said 472 people)."
Dee H.,"Boston, MA",37,380,1,4.0,8/24/2009,"I was so delighted to have come here for brunch on Sunday, and did not have to wait!  They have a huge menu, and also now a new children's menu for my little boy.  My Joe's breakfast was pretty good, and the belgium waffle with the strawberries, pecans and lovely whipped cream was even better.  The service was very good, in fact we've never had poor service here.  I would never wait more than 20 minutes to dine here, though.  There are way too many other good dinner options elsewhere.  Oh, of course we ordered cheesecake, but as usual took it to go.  (I would be happy to just take their whipped cream to go and just have that for dessert!)"
Adam S.,"Seattle, WA",2,15,2,4.0,12/26/2008,I go here pretty often for dinner out and I've always been really happy with the food.  I like the huge menu because I'd rather not order the same thing on consecutive visits to a place.  Definitely plan to take part of the meal and the cheesecake to go.  I've regretted over-stuffing myself more than once here.
Hari V.,"Danvers, MA",4,16,1,4.0,4/2/2010,I did not any meal. I ate a white choclate raspberry truffle cake. The cake was awesome. I went to the place on a Sunday evening. The place was crowded. It took 15 minutes for me get the cake.
Jen B.,"Portland, OR",65,92,12,2.0,7/9/2008,"This place really doesn't do food so well. Every time I've eaten a meal here I feel like I was just served a really large frozen dinner that's fresh out of the microwave. They get one star for the good service and one star for they're above and beyond fantastic cheesecake. They should just stick to dessert because really, I can have a TV dinner at home for about three bucks."
Martin R.,"Lowell, MA",0,9,,2.0,11/17/2011,"Stopped by on a Rainy Friday Night , the wait was an Hour, my daughter and I were seated in the middle of the restaurant at a table for TWO, this was the worst experience I have had as the patrons at the next table are right on top of you, and any type of conversation is impossible..and I really don't want to listen to a rude guy trying to impress a Girl.. The Menu is too big too many pages. Wait staff was pleasant, we had orange chicken , and Salmon..the food was okk. came out in a timely manner...I f you want to eves-drop on conversation ..this is the place to Goo.."
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,4.0,2/4/2010,"This is a very solid CF location.   Parking is always difficult to find at this mall it seems, but once you score a spot the wait is not too bad (at least on a Thursday night at 6 pm, which is typically at least a little busy).   A lot of people seem to hate on the food at Cheesecake just because it's a chain, but I think most of the meals are actually really good.  The portions are huge and it's a little pricey, but you either get two meals out of it, or if you have issues with portion control, share an entree and have a nice cheap meal.  The bread was warm and fresh, which I've found it's regularly not at the Chestnut Hill location.   We shared the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was a little different than at the CH location - spicier and the chicken was a little crispier.   My boyfriend really loved the extra spice.   If you manage to save room for desserts, the cheesecakes are almost all excellent.   Service was friendly and very prompt, despite how busy they were, and they accommodated my request for water without lemon very pleasantly.  This is definitely me & the bf's new go-to Cheesecake Factory location for our remaining three months in Boston."
Molyna S.,"Lexington, MA",0,5,10,4.0,10/2/2011,"The Buffalo blast are amazing. The service I recieved this particular time was great. The lady was nice, responsive and the food came out promptly!"
Tan T.,"Manchester, MA",0,8,,4.0,10/2/2011,"Well, I just went here this afternoon with my mom, sister and aunt when I got in there my mom went to put in are name. And in the mean time my aunt was telling me about the phone she just caught. My mom came back and said thirty minutes so I'm like ummmm not bad and plus the place was really packed. when they called are name it was really only a 25 minute wait and so we sat down and for a drink i got the white zinfandel my mom got a diet coke and my aunt got a glass of red wine (not sure what brand). My sister got the fish and chips and the batter was so thick she tore it off with her knife i got the pasta and it was very good. and than came to dessert i got the Cheesecake and it was very good and i love oreos so i got the oreo verison. Overall i think you should come here.   HAVE A GREAT TIME!"
Sheena L.,"Nashua, NH",0,22,,4.0,8/29/2011,"I don't know why people hate on The Cheesecake Factory! It's one of my favorite chain restaurants! The food is always great! The cheesecake is delicious! Sometimes the service can be eh, but overall I love it!! I tend to get the Chicken Parm sandwich when we go. It's so good!"
Laura M.,"North Waltham, MA",2,48,,5.0,12/12/2006,"At prime eating hours this location can get packed! I usually grab a buzzer and go shopping. The buzzer does not work past the escalators (or whatever they tell you), but if you keep track of time everything works out great. I love the cheesecake factory. Great salads and the avocado egg rolls are so yummy! They give you huge portions so bring an empty belly."
J B.,"Bedford, MA",0,2,,1.0,10/16/2011,Very dis-organized. Management needs some training. Custom service below par when compared to similar restaurants. Would rather go to some other high end restaurant than this cheap one.
m a.,"Tyngsboro, MA",0,15,,4.0,5/16/2011,"first, i left off one star for the noise and the claustrophobic table arrangements other than that..... place is clean,only one time i had to request another utensils, had some food stuck to it.nasty.never happened again the background noise is loud. and the arrangement of seats n half booths/half chairs can be a pain, particularly if you dont want to hear someones conversation or someone to hear yours, and just a feeling of uncomfortable boundaries. the wait is usually   advice to people, and take heed, they open at 11am, i would be the first person there, so there is no waiting and if you want to go for dinner, get there around 330-400, yeah, its too early by some standards, buts it either that or complaing and a tasty tid bit, please when your little buzzer thing beeps, please seat us right away. food, menu-little large, but i am a picky eater, so i have at least 5-10 things i can choose from when i come here. portions are HUGE.i get the renees special.or the thai pasta yum! and the cheesecake, the best, definately worth the money."
