Linda S.,"Cambridge, MA",5,81,,3.0,6/19/2008,"I have been to this CCF for lunch as a working gatherings only.  Otherwise who can take a three hour lunch to wait in the ridiculously long waiting list and peruse the ridiculously long menu?!?!?!  Working lunch are the only time I can get away with it -- that's when my boss is also there to experience the waiting and waiting.  Their extensive menu lists sandwiches, burgers, salads, pasta dishes and seafood ( and probably lots more than I can recall).  The best thing on the menu is the cheesecake, of course.  Put a slice of the Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake in front of me and I'm a happy little worker or not overly sugared by the time I get back to work."
Garry C.,"Groveland, MA",3,37,1,2.0,6/13/2008,"The good ol' Cheesecake Factory....the restaurant with the menu that is pages long, takes hours to order, and the waitresses don't care about you. We did not have to wait today considering the fact that we were at the restaurant by 11:30 am. It is a beautiful day so we ate outside hoping to enjoy a nice meal. The wait staff had an alterior motive though....to see how sunburned they could get the patrons. Our waitress made no attempt to try to accomodate use with the unbrellas....not to meantion the fact that no one was there so no one was using them. Stupid bitch. After 20 minutes of complaining she made what could be considered an ""attempt"" at moving the unmbrella, only to fail miserably. The food was ok as well. The bread is usually very good but it came out harder than normal as well as quite dry. Disappointing. The meals however were quite good considering the price. For $10 I got a massive salad (without tomatoes because of salmonella) and a personal veggie pizza with goat cheese. Other than good prices (for lunch), a massive menu and massive portions this location did not seem to have too much going for it. OVER RATED!!!!!!"
Jules B.,"Salem, NH",3,27,,4.0,3/5/2008,"This restaurant is high on my list of favorites!  I tend to go during 'off peak' times like between 2-4 and after 7 and have rarely had to wait.  The menu is fantastic and I have never ordered a dish that I didn't enjoy.  My favorite is the chicken madeira which I tend to order most times because it is so mouth watering good.  And yes, the cheesecake is smooth and melts in your mouth!  The service here is not the best.  They are not as attentive and intuitive (fill water glass, etc) as I would like but the food keeps me going back."
Michael K.,"Boston, MA",0,42,1,2.0,4/3/2012,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory several times since they opened.  Recently, I have had a number of bad experiences which have led me to believe that they really don't care about their customers.  On the most recent occasion, I dined with a friend and our waitress was quite good until a problem arose; specifically, the pasta dish that I ordered contained pasta that was undercooked. She brought the issue to a manager's attention and the female manager on duty came over to our table.  She offered to make me a new dish.  It was a little awkward because the person I was with didn't want to eat her meal until my new dish was brought to the table.  By the time mine arrived, her food was cold but she didn't want to complain.  The manager never returned to see how everything was.  The waitress only returned after we were done eating to see whether we wanted dessert.  Surpisingly our bill arrived and we were charged full price for everything.  I won't be returning."
Mitch E.,"Belmont, MA",1,87,,2.0,9/13/2009,"i like this place , but had bad experiance last time !!! We (girl and I ) ordered the THAI ROLLS appetizer, the chicken. was raw, thown on grill for seconds. we complained and got it taken off- im concerned for our food safety from them now."
m o.,"Boston, MA",0,36,2,1.0,11/22/2009,Look If you name yourself taco factory I would think you would make a least a half decent taco. So why does the Cheesecake Factory cheesecake suck? I do not know exactly but we can try not very rich not very flavorful. You can not make up for it by giving a larger piece. As for the food I can't say but if I can buy better cheesecake at the supermarket then I'm not gonna eat here. PS: your carrot cake sucks too. FAIL.
Riem K.,"Melrose, MA",10,72,6,3.0,11/17/2007,"3 Stars and no more. It's a chain restaurant, so you kinda expect food that is a little above average and you just go there for convenience. It's like Dunkin Donuts, you know you can make it at home, but you rather just go to the chain for the sake of laziness. Usually, it's not bad, not spectacular, but not horrid either. plus the fact that you will have leftovers for days to come doesn't hurt either. However today's visit was below average. I was craving late last night one of their cheesecakes, so we decided to lunch there. First, it's just 12pm in a mall. The mall is PACKED and it's not even after Thanksgiving yet, and there's a 45 minute wait at the Factory. When we are seated, it's in the two seats that are right behind the wall where people would wait to get their names called. Not only did I have to deal with people constantly looking down at me to see what I was reading on the menu, what every single item was on my table and what I had ordered for drinks, appetizers and entree. But I had a nice lady (sarcastically) flipping her hair with my food right underneath her. So after conveniently banging on the wall, she stopped. Appetizers came, and it a greasy mess of calamari. Never has it been that greasy. I asked the waitress for a straw, she came back with my unwrapped straw in hand. Not to be paranoid, but I know those suckers come wrap, keep em wrap till you get to my table. Entrees came and I had ordered the combo steak diane and shrimp scampi. Scampi was drowned in lemon butter and the steak was drowned in some oversalted sauce. We asked for the check and took our cheesecake home. Usually, my experience is not this bad, so I gave it a three star instead of one. But if I had to base my review on this experience alone, it def. would of been a one star."
John T.,"Beverly, MA",1,46,,3.0,7/6/2007,"Jimmy's On the Mall (here before) was MUCH better. 7 bucks for a slice of Cheesecake? C'mon, ITS A CHAIN! You can grow old waiting. Italian bakery Cheesecake is MUCH better at half of the price. The Factory is on the expensive side. If your in the area, you can give it a shot. If not, it isn't work the drive since there are LONG waits."
Tracey M.,"North Waltham, MA",0,12,,2.0,2/18/2009,"Arrived at Cheesecake Factory at 10:00PM, which is an hour and a half before the kitchen closes as well as the only time that you can go and not wait over 7 hours for a table. This is my 58 year old mothers' 2nd time here, and she was a bit overwhelmed by the 74034 page menu. Totally fine, as I know what she eats and made suggestions.  The waitress came over to get our drink order and we had been too busy talking food. So, my mom orders a ""grape martini"", which is what she usually is able to get when going to local places.  Now, instead of saying, ""Sorry ma'am we dont have the ingredients for this martini,  but here is the drink menu to pick something that you like""...She looked at my poor mother like she had 5 heads and disgustedly said said ""Grape martini? No, we dont have those."" Like she was a 3 year old. And then I suggested that mom look at the drink menu. I am sorry, there is just no reason to be that condescending to someone. Thankfully, after someone else had delivered our drinks, we had a new waitress come over. Apparently, mean girl had been cut. Our new server  was VERY nice. I knew that I needed a take-out at the beginning of my meal and was afraid to ask for the lunch portion from the original waitress, but gave it a shot with the new one. She said no, but at least I wasnt afraid to ask!!  Meal was excellent, mom LOVED her pear martini, and she left happy. We don't get to spend time together often and we had a great time. Did not really feel rushed out of there either. I work in the industry and know how tough it is at the end of the night, but our server did a great job."
