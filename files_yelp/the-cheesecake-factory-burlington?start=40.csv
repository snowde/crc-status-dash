Patrick S.,"Stoneham, MA",3,6,,5.0,10/4/2016,"I've been to this particular location for many years and haven't had a problem, ever. The food is consistent: in terms of portion size, quality and taste. I would definitely recommend this location!"
Kim S.,"Lowell, MA",184,272,3892,4.0,4/25/2015,"I've always been a fan of the huge menu selection at the Cheesecake factory! Food is plentiful and well presented. My only complaints is that parking is tough and waiting for a table is even tougher.  My friend had a gift certificate so we headed there for lunch on a Friday afternoon.   We got there at noon and there was already a wait for tables so we sat at the bar.  The bartender was really nice and got us drinks right away.  I love the small plates menu and got the corn dogs and sausage & ricotta flat bread. They were both great!  My coworker got the gigantic turkey club and fries, it was way too big for him to finish.  Our other friend got the chicken lettuce wraps with the beautiful display of greens and purple lettuce.  The peanut dipping sauce was delicious! Some people say that the Cheesecake factory is over rated but I still enjoy going there ever so often."
Alex S.,"Peru, NY",129,2,,4.0,7/12/2017,"Very good experience and the food is absolutely amazing. The only thing I would recommend is having a little bit more courtesy when telling guests their table is ready, especially those who patiently waited over an hour without asking about their wait time once."
Kendra W.,"Miami, FL",49,25,4,1.0,9/14/2017,The food was great but the server was terrible. He got an attitude when I asked to split and my other guest asked for a cheesecake. He gave me the incorrect change and just threw it on the table. I chose not to tip for horrible service. First time in Boston and very disappointed.
Wendell E.,"Milford, NH",2,3,,4.0,7/7/2017,"Great food, absolutely fantastic desserts in a loud and crowded environment. Expect to wait 20 to 40 minutes along with a hefty tab."
Gail R.,"Methuen, MA",0,6,2,2.0,1/1/2017,"I'm not sure what the hype is here. Any restaurant with a ridiculous amount of offerings on the menu can't be doing them all justice! It's like a supermarket! Also, be prepared to feel like you're dining with the tables on either side of you as you are packed in tighter than sardines a can  That said, you certainly can't go wrong with the cheesecake"
Hassan S.,"Tyngsborough, MA",31,16,6,5.0,11/17/2016,"I love Cheesecake. Having said that, I have been to many many different locations all over the US. This location is definitely one of my top 5. The food is always fresh and delicious and I have had nice and friendly staff wait on me every time I have been there. Always a safe option if you want some good food and don't want to break the bank! Good for families as well as parties!"
Bob C.,"Townsend, MA",42,136,9,3.0,11/4/2016,"We went here for my son's birthday and made a reservation which they do take before 5PM.  Parking is at the mall, at this time of day it wasn't too bad finding a spot but by the time we left the lot was completely full.  Very clean, stylish, romantic, A+++ service, very yummy cheese cake!  They bring out bread and butter which is very good.  I had my usual Sam Adams lager which was $8.25 (a little bit more in price than I'm used to paying).  The menu can be a little bit daunting as it is very expansive.  The one thing that I can't put my finger on is that I don't have a favorite meal or every-time I come out of there say wow that was wonderful.  Maybe I haven't found it yet.  My daughter agrees with me too!     I had the Factory Burrito Grande!   It was served with yummy guacamole, sour cream and beans.  The problem with the burrito was WHERE's THE BEEF (or chicken rather).  It was all rice... very very disappointing.   Everyone else enjoy their meal or at least didn't say anything bad about it.   The waiter was excellent... took our orders for the six of us by memory and never got it wrong.  I think this review is consistent with my other visits... nice place, great service, but the food isn't memorable and that makes me hesitant to go back."
Osh K.,"Lawrence, MA",109,239,1623,3.0,3/25/2016,"I haven't been here in years but decided to meet my brother and his wife there. 30 min wait but we were sat in 15 not bad at all. The menu is always large and full variety. I got the miso salmon served with rice. The fish was good but the rice was not fresh at all, some of it was hard and I hate that. Apps was the avocado rolls fried not bad at all. The Buffalo chicken blast way to greasy and just couldn't eat it. Overall service was good. I don't think I will be back anytime soon."
Nancy H.,"San Diego, CA",214,493,1045,5.0,3/15/2015,"apparently the last time we came was just an off day. Everything we had tonight, including the service was great. We came late (around 930 on a Sunday) and the server seemed more than happy to see us. That is important.  We had a bunch of appetizers including Thai chicken lettuce wraps, veggie fries, crab cake bites, avocado egg rolls and all of them were really good. The Thai wraps were the best!  Oreo dream extreme & chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecakes were so so so yummy."
Alexa F.,"Stoneham, MA",95,100,204,5.0,3/28/2016,"I've always had great experiences here! - Portions are ENORMOUS. Including the desserts, so it justifies $8.  - Consistent good servers.  - Good bread before the meal.  - Pretty design & decor Only downside is they don't take reservations or call ahead seating, so peak dinner times and weekends get busy!"
Tammy N.,"Salem, NH",0,27,23,2.0,5/9/2017,"Party of 9 waiting for over an hour. Called ahead they said the wait would only be 30 minutes. At least 15 tables were seated before us. Food is frozen and everything about this place is over rated. The wait should not be an hour and a half for a chain. However, our waitress Kayleigh was amazing. The only good part about here"
John Y.,"Cambridge, MA",3,51,346,4.0,1/6/2016,We didn't have to wait long for a table.  We arrived around 5:30 on a Wednesday night and had to only wait around 5-10 minutes for a table for 5.  Server came and greeted us right away. We got fresh bread while we waited. Food was great. We seem to always order the same dishes when we come to The Cheesecake Factory. The only complaint we have was no one came by to check on us so we couldn't get any refills on our waters.
John P.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",54,72,133,3.0,8/23/2016,"Egg roll sampler is the bomb!  Chicken Marsala w/ mushrooms was ok, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, this place is good.  Cheesecake of course is the whole reason to visit this place but not if you're on a diet.  :-)"
Shengnan L.,"Burlington, MA",0,2,,2.0,9/13/2017,"The food is very good,but the waiter was very unfriendly. I didn't have to check out, but she gave me the bill and we still wanted to talk. It was rude of her to come and ask for a bill and a tip. I hate the service! I am not happy."
Christy R.,"Billerica, MA",1,5,,5.0,5/14/2017,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night for a Mother's Day dinner. We had a perfect dinner. The wait was a bit long but that was expected and it was worth the wait. Service was great. We put dirty dishes at the end of the table and when our waitress wasn't available, other waiters took the plates and cleaned up for us so that our table was always clear. The food came out fast and hot. The food was excellent we ordered fried Mac and cheese, chicken dumplings, chicken quesadilla, and Louisiana chicken pasta dish. Everything was delicious I would recommend those items on the menu."
Cortny G.,"Tewksbury, MA",219,9,,4.0,10/19/2016,"Depending on the day/time the wait can be a bit ridiculous but helps that it's attached to the mall in that aspect.  Lunch and dinner menus are both HUGE so you'd never be limited on what to choose from. Their patio is nice during the summer and inside seating is good too except some tables are very close to others.  ALWAYS get the cheesecake even if you don't have room for it, it isn't called the Cheesecake Factory for nothing!"
Rachel W.,"Malden, MA",4,89,9,4.0,2/26/2017,Nice pork chop and tiramisu cake! Only thing is that it's a little bit expensive... But that's what it is... All in all I like this place!
Jakki E.,"Boston, MA",38,20,4,3.0,2/19/2017,"Okay, I know this is a chain, which I never love, but we got a gift card, so we thought we'd give it another try.  First, there was an hour and half wait at 8:00 pm. That's nuts. Not to worry, though, my husband snagged a high top in the bar where we could order food.  We first ordered drinks, which were fair, and apps. Mozzarella sticks were good (can you go wrong w that?), but we had an issue with the artichoke dip. We ordered the artichoke dip and clarified that we did NOT want the spinach dip. What did we get?  The spinach dip. So, we sent it back given that warm spinach activates the hub's gag reflex. The waitress came back and said the artichoke dip was seasonal and wasn't being offered. Okay, but it was still on the menu, so..... No artichoke dip for us. Fine. On to the meal. I got samosas off the skinny menu. I liked them. Hubby got the jambalaya pasta (it was huge, but at $22- at the CCF- it should be). Kids both got Mac n cheese. This was very good- creamy with large pasta. We finished the meal with cheesecake. Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. It was delicious.  Ultimately, it wasn't necessarily the food we didn't love, it was the service.  Slow, lacking knowledge, not worth the $130 we paid for dinner.  Bottom line, we would rather go to Boston Beerworks and spend $130 than spend it here."
Wei W.,"Lexington, MA",131,275,1183,3.0,9/6/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is the common denominator when you have a large group of people to entertain with vastly different tastes. As the chain is billed to have the usual American-style food with twists on various cultural dishes, it's broadly got something for everyone. Our latest visit was just after a morning of shopping, so it was righteous to treat ourselves to a decent meal to refuel before the next round. The bf and I arrived just after 2pm, and were seated promptly despite a bustling floor. We were assigned a waitress named Cassandra, and found that the menus we were given were all new. It's been awhile since I've seen clean menus and new items here. So we sat and ordered our rounds of water. We promised Cassandra we would be ready within five minutes to place our order. She returned to our table after 15 minutes; had we not had bread on the table, we probably would have keeled over from low blood sugar. Her lack of enthusiasm for the job really set the tone for the rest of the meal; the expectation bar fell pretty low. I ended up ordering the lunch portion of the chicken piccata, while the bf ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich. Another 20 minutes later, our food arrives. At least Cassandra checked on us within 10 minutes of our eating. The food was good, and as usual, very large in quantity. By the time we were close to done, the bf asked her for the check so we could escape, especially since we had already been seated for over an hour for what we thought would be a brief lunch. Another 10 minutes pass us by. I keep holding onto the hope that speedy service exists here, only to have them repeatedly dashed. Now I remember why I don't come here as often."
