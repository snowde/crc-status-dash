Allison M.,"Chelmsford, MA",0,5,,5.0,6/9/2017,Our waiter Jensen was an absolute treat! He was such a pleasure. We had 5 people in our party and he was very attentive and made sure to use our names. He was so friendly and we could tell he really cared about giving us the best possible service. He really did make our experience so much more fun and pleasurable. Thank you Jensen!!!!!!!
Sajjad P.,"Burlington, MA",0,12,,1.0,12/14/2016,Food sucked on my last visit. Manager came to apologize but damage was done  What can I say! Gave all info yet no response!
Priyanka N.,"Cambridge, MA",218,229,229,4.0,11/29/2014,I am a little torn because in reality the food is  3 star quality and the cheesecake is 5 star quality. I suppose that averages out to 4 stars. A friend and I came to this location yesterday. We were seated in under 15 minutes even though it was Black Friday and the mall was packed. (Granted there was only two of us and we didn't show up until around 2:30 pm). Overall the service was prompt and friendly. We got some fresh bread to start which was pretty average for free starter bread (though the pumpernickel was definitely the better of the two). The lunch special chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes I ordered was good (not bad or great) though I will say that despite being a lunch portion I could only finish half of it - very heavy! Good thing too since even as a lunch special it was still $12.50. We didn't end up getting any cheesecake this time (except for the free raspberry white chocolate sample which was delicious!) but I've gotten cheesecake here several times and every time it's been delicious! My favorite is definitely the dulce de leche although the Tiramisu is quite good too! I would only eat here if I was at the mall for another reason or if I was craving some really good cheesecake!
Larry C.,"Merrimack, NH",0,10,,3.0,3/14/2017,My wife and I went at 6:30 on a Thursday night for dinner...about a 20 minute wait..not bad. Restaurant dark and loud. Seating does not lend itself to privacy or conversation. It's a bit of a cattle farm. Service was slow..ordered soup for appetizer ..had to remind waiter . It came just a few minutes before our dinner. Very hot...ended up taking it home. Dinners came and mine really wasn't hot. Some of vegetables had that out of a can taste and appearance. Couple next to us also complained about the speed of service with their waiter. Rating more like a 2.5.
Joel P.,"Nashua, NH",1,9,2,4.0,5/28/2017,"Had a really good meal, with good service. Value to meal ratio was off, and would probably give a 3.5 star if I could.  Service- I think this REALLY depends on when you dine here and people's perception after waiting for 2hrs. There was a lot of negative reviews on service but we had a good experience. Sunday at 4pm, was seated in 15 minutes just as told. Waitress was good (not great). Food was brought out within 15 minutes of ordering. Food- Really good- this is not boston north end dining... but with that in mind the food was great. Five in our party and everyone enjoyed their food. Servings we generous. Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken - delicious, cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes and green beans were good. The sauce was slightly oily but very tasty.  Carne steak medallions - very good, cooked as asked with a great flavor Mac and Cheese app- 14 and 16 Y/O got this as meal, son was able to finish but not daughter. Both loved it. Pork Chops- very good Drinks - small wine list, got one drink and it was below average Value to Food - We averaged $40 a head with three teenagers and two adults. One wine glass and one drink... two of the kids got only an app and a cheesecake.  The prices are so high that if I had to wait more than half hour I could see the stars start to come down.... Overall, good for lunch or other down times. Good atmosphere and easy to talk (not to loud)."
Elyse K.,"Litchfield, NH",1,14,11,3.0,2/27/2017,"Tables and silverware are always dirty. I stopped in because I needed a few things from the mall. Food is decent, but for whatever reason they just don't wash the tables thoroughly enough. This is not a place I would good to on a regular basis. It's nice enough if you happen to already be at the mall."
Guy S.,"Charlestown, MA",0,285,44,2.0,2/15/2017,"Can you please get my orders right. Same kid 2 orders in a row can't complete correctly a 3 order meal and a order of dessert. My eggplant was hard and cold the past that came with it was a lump stuck together, the other kid ordered a turkey club and got a chicken sandwich with terrible spices on it, I can say my friends chicken alfredo was good he didn't complain. The staff can do a way better job at making sure mistakes are minimized. I should have known when a lady was complaining about her salmon being cold and odd tasting. And before all this I was always satisfied with the food."
Monica L.,"Walpole, MA",0,11,,4.0,2/14/2017,"I was having dinner with my family recently and was very happy with the service. The waiter was very warm And accommodating and the food was delicious.  The restaurant was also very very clean, which is extremely important. M. Lannan"
Raymond Y.,"Brighton, MA",126,162,211,3.0,8/16/2015,Cheesecake Factory is my go-to default restaurant. (Don't judge...it's affordable and large portions!) Got the Salmon Genovese this time and it was pretty good. The couscous could have been a bit more tender and cooked through. But everything tastes great. Fish was well cooked.
Paul P.,"Manchester, NH",22,4,2,1.0,10/21/2016,"Just went here this past weekend. Someone stole my credit card info. This was my first visit to MA in months and my only transaction there, and now someone in Cambridge area is using my card. It's too coincidental. The food sucked too but has been good before."
Neil C.,"Natick, MA",2,22,48,2.0,6/24/2017,"Menu is huge so there is something for everyone. They have skinny menu with lower calories foods as well as small plate which are good. The calories in a lot of the dishes are very high but appreciate a restaurant that lists them! Food is pretty consistent and overall good but I think prices are on the high side. Restaurant is nice, clean and a good size. The reason for the 2 stars is on the way out I decided to get a single slice of cheesecake from the take out counter, well that single piece of cheesecake took 12 minutes from the time I paid to the time I got it. Outrageous. There were about 5 or 6 ppl behind the counter but there didn't seem to be a rush. A lot of desserts getting prepped for tables and it seems the take out customers are neglected. This wasn't an oversight either, seemed like standard practice, no apology or a heads up it would take longer and I wasn't the only one that had to wait this long. Doesn't matter how good the cheesecake is I don't want to wait 12 minutes for a pre sliced piece of cheesecake to be dropped into a box."
Laura D.,"Brighton, MA",162,305,318,2.0,3/27/2015,"Went here recently with my girlfriend and her family on a weekend afternoon and it was incredibly busy. The wait wasn't too bad, though. Probably 10-15 minutes. As always, I was overwhelmed by their menu, which seems like it's 50 pages and I'm sure most of those items never get ordered.  Our server was very patient with our large group and provided excellent service throughout. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club with no bacon (chicken, avocado, tomato, swiss, mayo). It was fine. Tasty and a bit messy. Probably not worth the price, but not bad. One of the people in the group was dissatisfied with her Cobb Salad, so I offered her the other half of my sandwich, and she really enjoyed it. The fries were good as well. For dessert, we got the Oreo dream Extreme Cheesecake, which was really disappointing. It's a base layer of fudge cake, then a middle layer of their original cheesecake with Oreos baked in, then a layer of Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing. I'm an Oreo fan, but nothing about it stood out to me. The cake was pretty cold (must have just come out of the fridge), so it wasn't very moist. The original cheesecake layer wasn't anything special to me, either. The best layer seemed to be the Oreo mousse, but I got sick of that quickly because it was so sweet. Wouldn't order again. Overall, not worth the price."
Kasey C.,"Schuylerville, NY",64,4,,1.0,9/25/2016,Yuck not a fan of their food except the desserts... Next time I'll just order dessert
Idy T.,"Boston, MA",403,375,2139,4.0,2/6/2015,"I usually don't write reviews for big chain restaurants. However, I was thoroughly impressed by my recent dining experience at Cheesecake Factory because of the wonderful service! I went on a weekday night and it was not too busy. I ordered chicken scampi and chicken lettuce wrap for appetizers. The food was delicious! The lettuce wrap was refreshing. It was served with grilled chicken, pickled cucumbers, julienned carrots, cold noodles, and comes with 3 sauces. Each sauce was very tasty. The chicken scampi was also very good. The pasta was al dente! I hate when my pasta is overcooked. The scampi sauce was garlicky and delicious. It had the perfect balance of acidity and savory mixed together.  The service was absolutely wonderful! The waitress who served our table was a lovely lady. She was very attentive and served us right away, even though she was juggling with several other tables. She made sure our drinks were filled. Because the table for 2 was too small for all of our dishes, she even went to the extent to push the table next to us over, so we had more space. It is service like this that brings people back! Unfortunately, I forgot her name, otherwise I would give her a special shoutout!"
Kim T.,"Plano, TX",13,239,374,4.0,7/1/2015,"Great food, friendly staff, convenient location, and excellent value. No complaints here. My friend and I came here for lunch right when they opened so there was no wait. They have a large menu with so many tasty sounding options.  I opted for the macaroni and cheese burger which is basically a huge burger cooked to order, topped with one of their fried mac n cheese balls, sitting under more melted cheese. If you haven't guessed it already, it's one heck of diet bomb but it's so amazing. The mac n cheese ball comes out fresh from the fryer with a nice crunchy crust so when you put the top bun on top and press down, there's an audible cracking sound before the ooey gooey mac n cheese starts oozing out all over the burger.  I ordered a salad on the side instead of fries (though I held no illusions that this was an even remotely healthy meal) and ended up only eating half of my burger. Their portions are almost comically large so it's not always easy to save room for dessert. I managed to save a little bit of room and ordered a slice of the reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. It was amazing though it was a similarly huge portion size so I took half of it home with me.  In the end, I had another meal's worth of leftovers, all for a very reasonable price."
Bob S.,"Bedford, NH",0,6,,2.0,12/9/2016,"I'm usually very pleased with the Cheesecake Factory meals, however yesterday was my second not so great meal at this location, a couple of years ago I had fish and chips lthat was horrible, wet fried fish?. Yesterday I had the Cobb salad, a tasteless plate of wilted soggy lettuce, no bacon or tomato that I could detect, very little egg, tastless blue cheese.  Maybe it's just this location, as I said I usually have goood with them, just not in Burlington."
Holly C.,"Boston, MA",120,32,154,4.0,2/27/2016,"Aside from the typical ginormous portion sizes and delectable cheesecake, this location is well run. The weekend can get very busy with every table occupied, and the staff remains friendly and at ease with the crowd. Impressive considering the clientele that a mall can bring in. I've also been here after work for drinks and apps in the past, and the outdoor seating is pleasant on warmer days.  The drinks are good. Look out for the mango margarita! You will see an array of salads and 'healthy' type apps and entrees on the menu, but if you are like me, you and your dining compadres will order all the things that will make you feel absolutely disgusted with yourself when you leave. For instance, the fried mac and cheese balls drenched in marinara sauce, or the avocado egg rolls... or the sweet corn tamale cakes! Delicious. Sure that Chinese chicken salad may look a little safer, but then you see that egg roll sampler drift by your table, and your mind is back to the fried Mac and cheese balls! If you don't have room for cheesecake, order it to go. You know... after you go for that run later... or after a nap! ;)  Lastly, the bathrooms are clean and I like that the music is turned up in the bathroom to void out other sounds..."
Shelby G.,"Bentonville, AR",26,201,187,5.0,3/7/2016,"I love this location. The service is always great, food is always hot, and cheesecake is delectable."
Susan M.,"Medford, MA",0,32,12,5.0,5/23/2016,"Ate a fabulous lunch at Cheesecake Factory (Burlington Mall) yesterday consisting of the Monte Christo, the Spicy Chicken Tacos, and Fettuccine Alfredo. Of course, following that came the desserts: one slice of the Original Cheesecake and another of the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake. The service was great. We left very happy and rolled ourselves out to the car..."
M J.,"Stoneham, MA",1,10,1,1.0,10/9/2016,"Easily without a doubt the worst meal I have ever had at a ""Restaurant"". Both of our meals had portions that were either over cooked or undercooked. Neither one of us finished our meals. We should have listened to our instincts and went into Boston. It's Cheesecake Factory so I wasn't expecting much but even with my expectations being low they failed. $120 later and I'm still regretting it the next day. For $120 I could have had an extremely pleasing meal some where else. Keep up the terrible work Cheesecake Factory."
