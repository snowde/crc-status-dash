Whitney S.,"Melrose, MA",117,136,83,4.0,2/22/2015,Love this place for a reliable meal.  You can count on the fact that there is something that everyone will enjoy and the food is delish.  I especially enjoy the skinnylicious asian chicken salad...and the brown bread they give you for FREE!   This location does tend to get super busy because of the mall so plan accordingly.
Kirk T.,"Methuen, MA",45,14,2,2.0,4/2/2017,"Now in my 30s I remember that The Cheesecake Factory stood out as my first experience with exceptional customer service and attention to detail. I suspect those two things now get lost somewhere between the front of the house and the kitchen. Two of us dined there Friday night as I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to relive my teens again. Our server was funny, attentive, and super considerate. Our bread, drinks, and appetizers were awesome and arrived one time. The problem was that one of our entrees, a Chicken Marsala, appeared to have been cooked at some earlier point in the day, sat around for a while, and was reheated before service to us. The pasta was dry, the chicken had the rubbery reheated feel to it, and was just disappointing. My fiancé is rather shy and waited a bit before saying anything, but it was obvious that the pasta was dry and the kitchen should have never put the plate out. We were offered something else but declined as we just decided to share my entree."
Raphael A.,"Washingtonville, NY",0,76,45,3.0,3/12/2016,Went there for brunch this past Sunday. There's not much to say about Cheesecake Factory...This location is at the Burlington Mall so it gets crowded really easy. Can't never get a table on Friday night or weekends most of the time and waiting is usually from 45 minutes to one and a half hours. Place was packed (as usual on Sunday morning)...hostess are not that friendly (they usually looked stressed with 500 people around them looking for tables or complaining about something else) but the food and the service is average ok. Nothing that great but nothing that bad either. Good size portions and they have a giant menu and with hundreds of options. Their cheesecake is unbeatable and that's one of the reasons we keep coming back. Is a easy $150 bucks for dinner and desert for two.
Brian L.,"Concord, MA",1,46,3,2.0,10/17/2015,"So I've been hearing about the Cheesecake Factory for years and tried one at the International Mall in Tampa ... not bad. Yesterday, I ran into a high school friend at the Burlington Mall and we went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a quick dinner.  One of my worst dinner experience of the past year. I was told the wait was going to be about 50 minutes and the ""beeper"" wouldn't work in the Mall.  Thinking we had at least 30 minutes to roam the mall before we had to be in ""beeper range"", we ran over to the Apple Store for 15 minutes ... not good.  We got back to Cheesecake Factory 20 minutes after we left there and we had ""beeped"" in the meantime. We solved that issue and were seated.  Fenway Park is somewhat quieter, but OK ... we're hungry.  The Server showed up, failed to identify himself and disappeared for 10 minutes.  Not very welcoming or professional, but we're here for the food, not to find quality staff. I ordered the Chick Piccata, one of their ""specialties"", according to their menu.  Fairly simple, right?  Apparently not. The pasta was stone cold.   It wouldn't have been a big deal to send it back, but it took over 10 minutes for our ""server"" to show up and ask ""how's everything"".   When he finally did show up, I sent the Chicken Picatta back.  Within 10 minutes, I was served another dish of Chicken Piccata, by someone I presume to be a ""manager"".   No comment from the manager, she just delivered the meal. It was hot this time, except the Pasta was under-done by a lot ... it wasn't edible. The Chicken Picatta was in a word, disgusting.  The chicken was boiled, not pan cooked.   The sauce was an awful concoction of I'm not sure what.  Traditional Chicken Piccata should have a lemon/butter/caper/mushroom sauce.  This had some weird, white sauce, that tasted and looked like it was made with milk or some such liquid.  I had 3 bites of the chicken and gave up. Starving, I figured I need a dessert to fill me up.  The chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was great, but I wanted to have a cup of coffee to help wash it down.  Coffee is about the most basic beverage to serve and Cheesecake Factory couldn't even deliver the goods when it came to a cup of coffee. The decaf coffee I was served was cold and must have been at least 4 hours old.  My spoon would almost stand up by itself, when I put in the cup.  I asked for ""cream & sugar"" and I was served a small aluminum pitcher of what I suspect, was either milk or some reconstituted coffee lightener.  I took one sip of the coffee and nearly spit it across the table.  I hope after I left, they saved the coffee to use as a solvent to clean their floors, rather than waste it. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake was excellent. In retrospect, the next time I'm hungry at the Burlington Mall, perhaps I'll just go to the Food Court, spent $5 there for some fast food and then go to Cheesecake Factory to get a dessert ""to go"".    I'd save $50 and not have to go home hungry. How this restaurant chain is so successful, baffles me.  I guess it proves that most diners will eat dirt on a shingle and like it, as long as they're served a decent size portion."
Kate L.,"Framingham, MA",112,354,37,5.0,10/1/2015,"Never had a bad meal here. LOVE how consistent the food is every time. Despite an issue with my meal at my last visit, management was AMAZINGLY nice and comped our entire meal! Unnecessary but greatly appreciated.  One handy tip: do not be scared by high calories count from dishes w/ dressings and sauces. Simply ask for a side dish and water down the dressing - a little goes a long way and it tastes exactly the same with some water added! Easy way to shave 2-400 calories off your meal!"
Jeff K.,"Boston, MA",187,539,27,1.0,12/27/2014,"The only redeeming quality is this place, this thing they call a sit down customer service restaurant is that it's open late. We left AMC movies across the street and it was late.  We opted for the only thing we found open and this did not disappoint. We got ALL the filth, booth filled of bread crumbs, sticky table (not resin like the table cleaning boy said) and crappy customer service you would expect and need for up to a year! But something has drastically changed in this place and I've figured it out from past recent reviewers. The management no longer cares. The inmates are running the asylum. I asked our waiter ""Pete"" for a manager and he laughed.. walked away and a manager NEVER came.  I wish I could like this location. I like the CF on huntington Ave but this falls really short of a go to location for anything."
Wayne S.,"Chelmsford, MA",34,163,212,4.0,1/24/2016,Came in here for dessert on a Sunday. No wait took a table in bar area.  Had Godiva Cheesecake which was amazing as usual. Server was very attentive and very nice.  Never had a bad place here.  Dinner time usually this place is packed and has a wait. Best Cheesecake hands down!
Lauren B.,"Lowell, MA",16,9,3,5.0,8/20/2016,"Never had a bad meal. The menu accommodates everybodies tastebuds. The cheesecake is to die for, but that's a given!"
Kelli B.,"Philadelphia, PA",152,89,249,4.0,9/6/2015,Great spot for lunch at the mall. Nice atmosphere. Food was as expected. Good lunch specials. Cheesecake was delish LOL
Kellie W.,"Newton, MA",12,58,106,5.0,7/29/2016,The plain cheesecake with strawberries is the best I've ever had. I've driven pretty far just to pick it up!
Michelle M.,"Medford, MA",25,7,6,2.0,9/10/2016,So we went for dinner. There were 9 of us. It took over a hour to get our food.  Then when tow people got their pasta dish thepasta was over cooked and gummy. I got orange chicken. The chicken was so over cooked it was like eating plastic.  One person didn't even get her meal. They forgot to cook it. Most sent their food back and it took another hour for the food to come out. The person waiting for their food STILL didn't get hers.  I had to argue with the manager to take my orange chicken off the bill since I sent it back and didn't get a new dish.  We sat there for over 3 hours.  When we all got up our legs were like rubber for sitting so long. I contacted the cheesecake factory via email twice and twice they ignored it.  I will never come back to this place again. They apparently don't care about their customers.
Jackie D.,"Lowell, MA",0,11,4,4.0,9/15/2015,"Great cheesecake! Huge variety, all delicious. Food was good, service was good. A little pricey but the cheesecake at the end of your meal is worth it. Expect to wait for a table though. Waited over 45 min at 4:30 on a Sunday."
Ipek K.,"Burlington, MA",0,5,,5.0,3/4/2017,I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal. The service is usually fantastic and the waiters are always so nice. They have a huge variety of foods for anyone and everyone. This restaurant is perfect for all groups. Not to mention that the prices aren't too bad for the quality of food. I'm not a big cheesecake lover but I can always go for a slice from here. The bread is also out of this world. Five stars no brainer!
Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",519,83,153,4.0,12/23/2014,"My best friend and I really love this place but don't come here as often as we would like because it's really pricey. We always love coming here because the food is delicious and the quality is always consistent. We got the avocado rolls as appetizers and as usual, they're yummy and filling. With those on top of the bread basket though, it's really easy to get full so you might want to skip on the appetizer if you want to make room for your entree and dessert. I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta as my entree, my usual, and only ate half because I wanted to save room for dessert. I took out the other half for leftovers since leftovers from Cheesecake Factory are still good. Since it was an early dinner and since we ate so much, we didn't get dessert which we both ended up regretting! Make room for dessert!  Our waiter was Jack P, if I recall correctly, and his service was pretty standard. We weren't sure if he was a little down because it was so busy or if it was because we ordered water (waiters assume you won't tip generously because you ordered water). We honestly ordered water because we already had a sugary drink right before. Since it was the holiday season and because my best friend is a waiter, we tipped Jack P more than we normally would. Cheer up Jack P!  We'll definitely be back again."
Kareem Q.,"Windsor, CT",52,25,15,5.0,5/19/2016,"Went there for dinner today we ordered the fresh guacamole , fried mac & cheese bites , Santa fee salad & 4 cheese pasta. The fresh guac was out of this world amazing , fresh and delicious the fried Mac and cheese bites was spot on & Santa fee salad was really good on the other hand the 4 cheese pasta wasn't what we expected but our waitress was so amazing that she kindly took it back and took it off the bill, I wish I got her name because her service & attitude was better than I have received in 5 star establishments specifically this cheese cake factory topped all cheese cake factory's I have been too !!! We will definitely be back !!!!!!"
Paige A.,"Concord, MA",0,34,7,4.0,2/19/2016,"This was my first time at Cheesecake Factory, and it for sure lived up to the hype! The portions are huge so if you want an appetizer, get one to share. Soft drink refills are complementary which is a nice plus! Their menu is very big and varied, so you don't need to worry about them not having anything you like. The cheesecake is amazing with so many flavors to choose from. Super filling but delicious!"
Reth K.,"Lowell, MA",0,11,1,5.0,1/9/2017,"Delicous cheesecake, food and drinks!!! Could be more spacious but overall great place!!"
Thomas S.,"Dracut, MA",0,10,,1.0,11/10/2016,I walked in with my family at 5:30 pm and encountered a dimly lit restaurant with incredibly loud music blasting away. The music was so loud that you could barely communicate. We turned around and walked out. The atmosphere was not one that I could enjoy a meal in.
Court S.,"East Bay, CA",929,871,1775,2.0,7/20/2012,"Tuesday night. 7:50pm. I'm bolting for the bathroom feeling nauseas.  Wait. Let me rewind...... My mom was treating me to dinner for being such a great daughter. We ordered delicious strawberry lemonades, warm crab & artichoke dip and BBQ salmon. Everything was good-except for the salmon. About 1/2 way through it(at 7:50pm) I started feeling light headed, hot, and nauseas. Not knowing why, I wrapped the rest of the food to go. The next day my mom ate the leftover salmon & had the same symptoms. I always order the bbq salmon & have never experienced this reaction before. Now I'm scared to ever order it again!!! P.S-Our waiter Jensen was great."
Susan S.,"Tyngsborough, MA",0,4,1,5.0,6/13/2016,"We had my grandfathers 85th birthday dinner here yesterday. The food was delicious as usual (chicken Madeira, hibachi steak, salted caramel cheesecake) but what really made our experience so wonderful was our awesome server Jessica!! She was so attentive and so genuinely kind to my family, she really made us feel taken care of! It was crazy busy but she never made us feel rushed, it meant so much to me, she made my grandfather feel really special.  Thanks Jessica C!!!"
