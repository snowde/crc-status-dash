Frida O.,"Braybrook, Australia",0,2,4,5.0,7/7/2017,"Would recommend the chocolate mousse cheesecake! We asked for the ingredients list for some of the cheesecakes, staff were very polite/friendly & accommodating with all our requests. Will definetly be back (for the amazing service)!!"
Sam C.,"Charlestown, MA",253,149,609,1.0,12/2/2017,"I used to love going to Cheesecake Factory but took a short break...now I see why I did. This time we only went for the cheesecake pick up (after calling in) - easy enough...you would think.  SO disappointed. Anybody who knows me knows I rarely give one star and (TRY) to be patient, but service was too bad this time. I called at exactly 5:30pm for a 6inch strawberry cheesecake and mentioned I will be there in 20 minutes. I ALSO double checked and made sure the cake can be ready for me to just grab and go - OK GREAT. (I know it's Saturday night and it gets super busy and I don't know what it takes to make a cheesecake. Mostly because I don't eat them and this was for a bday.)  We get there just past 6pm (so more than the 20 minute warning) and they say it's not ready and is being decorated, which will take 5-10 minutes. Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (""it's not ready yet"")...and wait. We then proceeded  to watch one of the ""bakers"" take a finished frozen cake out of the fridge to put on strawberries and frosting.... Please note that during this time, I was able to re-download Yelp (new phone! Yay), check in, and write this review. Yes, disappointed.  As Mama would say: If you can't estimate the timing, don't estimate. When you set the expectation, meet it. Please and thank you.  Having said that, this is a not as nice rant and I am sure I'll eventually try another Cheesecake Factory again...maybe."
Diane H.,"Boston, MA",434,684,720,2.0,11/13/2017,"Meh. Meh. Meh. You would think for dropping $67 before tip for a lunch for two, this experience would be at least delightful. We came hungry, it was 2pm on a Sunday not lunch rush or dinner but everything was just slow. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip which took 20 mins to come- it was good but the bread it came with was hard as a rock. Is cheesecake factory going to pay for my dentist appointment if my teeth somehow breaks trying to chew on this? The boy got an alcoholic drink which he enjoyed and I got a strawberry fruit smoothie which I will advise you to stay away because it's seeds city in there.  The worst part of this was that the boy ordered one of the ""specials"" which happen to be pineapple chicken and shrimp (rice dish). No where did it say it contained cilantro and when it came.......40 mins later it was the biggest part of the meal. HE DESPISES cilantro but did not want to wait for them to remake since it already took so long in the first place so he didn't say anything and attempted to eat it. Oh- to top if off they did not include ANY shrimp but they decided to add in an extra ingredient which he also hates- MUSHROOMS. Wow, just wow. I'm impressed that the chef decided to just alter the dish to his own liking instead of ours. The food runner even said this is the pineapple chicken and shrimp dish. LOL My pasta was fine, I got the FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC."
Chris H.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",109,267,766,3.0,5/26/2017,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain restaurant. You should know what to expect.  Our experience started with us sitting at a table without seeing any server for about 20 minutes. We had to finally go and ask someone to come help us. We sat near the bar and asked for the Red Sox game to be put on the TV a couple times...it never happened. Once we had our server she was really nice and helpful. It just took awhile to get to that point. I had the vegan Cobb salad and it was wicked good. Definitely surpassed my expectations. My mom got the original Cobb salad and ""wished"" she had gone with the vegan Cobb! My wife had a ziti vegetable dish and it was so-so. It was an average dish. The vegan Cobb definitely stole the show. My mom loves this place, so we always come here when family is in town. I'll be back by next summer."
Wai W.,"Quincy, MA",7,98,160,1.0,4/16/2017,"I called at 1pm today and reserved a birthday cake for my sister. picked up at 6pm and it was not ready.  why would a manager work at the register in first place.  then he make excuses after trying to find my order.  then I had to wait for it when I ordered ahead for them to prep a damn cake.  reason why I called ahead to avoid knowing problem, but they still failed.   cake finally came from back.  I asked if it was defrosted, they answer um..yep...it was in fridge.  and where was my birthday sign???  how can they failed someone's birthday.  I am beyond mad and will never visit them again.  and a line for top tip on the receipt...lol..are you kidding me...understand service to earn it!!    when we are ready to cut cake...after car sat in car...through dinner...and still some frozen in center...i thawed it myself for 3hrs. just read other reviews and I agree...service is horrible.."
Connor P.,"Boston, MA",22,234,50,2.0,3/30/2017,"I'm not sure what the overall hype is for this place. They do have an incredibly massive menu, but that's really the only good part.  Maybe it was the certain location I went to. We sat down fairly quick and got our drinks and bread, then ordered a meal and an appetizer for a table of 4. 45 minutes passed and the waitress kept saying our food was coming. She brought out the app with the food which took 45 minutes and they were ice cold hamburger sliders (good taste though). My 3 colleagues received their food and must have waited 5-10 minutes for them to bring me mine. I'm under the impression they forgot my order and thought the app was mine even though I didn't order the app. Anyways, chicken tacos were cold, not much flavor, weak tortilla to hold all the soggy ingredients. Everyone else seemed to like their meal but we were all amazed at the lack of attentive service. I'll try another location but this one was not good. Don't expect the meal to take less than 2 hours at the rate they move."
Michael B.,"Peabody, MA",78,1,2,1.0,11/27/2017,Have had good experiences at all of the locations besides this one. I ordered a salad for $13 and all of the vegetables were all wilty and soaking wet. I politely asked for a new one to go with the dressing on the side and the manager obliged. Took it home and it was the same disgusting wilty vegetables. Nice people there but terrible food.
Tom B.,"Portland, CT",6,71,23,3.0,3/31/2017,"Yup, it's a cheesecake factory. However, with the Sonesta and Marlowe right there, it's location makes it useful for larger customer/group dinners during the convention that are often held there. Everyone knows what to expect, no one is really disappointed."
Emily S.,"Norwood, MA",163,312,136,3.0,10/16/2017,"It is a Cheesecake Factory - just like other reviews have stated. I am walking in knowing what I am getting, not expecting a 5 Michelin Star experience. I met some friends here before an event and we did not need to wait for a table, which was a huge plus! Our server was attentive but did not hover, and really understood that we wanted to take our time and not be rushed along, that is a big deal since in high traffic places like this, servers want to understandably flip tables for more money. She was great! Our drinks from the bar came in a decent amount of time and were tasty as well. Our food also came out pretty fast, I was impressed, but we may have made it in before the mad rush. The food we ordered was good and we all were satisfied. Again, this is a Cheesecake Factory - it is what it is. The food and drinks were good, service was good and it served it's purpose, there were no complaints and no shining moments, just decent food, decent service and good location for what we needed it for."
Rodyl B.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,2.0,11/12/2017,"Came in with my sister and her friends to plan her baby shower. We were pretty successful but our service was not. Our server was sweet but it took so long to get so many things. It took forever to get greeted, it took forever to get a straw for one of us, it took forever to get drinks, food, bread, and I never got a refill on my water. And horrifyingly enough, I found a hair in my leftovers. We will definitely not be returning to this location."
Jennifer C.,"Cambridge, MA",12,11,,1.0,8/28/2017,"First of all my boyfriend ordered a burger and got food poisoning.  Our waitress was nice, but the service was really slow. We ordered edamame as an app and it was cooked far too long with no salt or soy sauce. We ordered our entrees the same time as the app and waited over 35 minutes. I ordered a friggin salad and it came out a few minutes after she brought over the burger. Like, really? And the whole place was pretty much empty and they sat us across from the bathroom. I'd give a zero if I could."
Naureen R.,"San Jose, CA",110,170,10,3.0,12/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is exactly what you think of it.  We had the Margherita Flatbread, Fire-roasted Artichoke, Kung Pao Shrimp, and a couple of cheesecakes.  Everything was okay, but the artichokes would've been absolutely delicious if CF had served it in a way that'd allow a person to eat it couthly, we literally got 4 charred artichokes that were just sliced in the middle but with no heart, we got to a point where we were looking around us as we sucked on the leaves because there wasn't another way to eat it. I got the Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake which was delicious.  For those that are vegetarian or keep halal, as you may know, many of CF's cheesecakes have gelatin in them. We asked our waiter who was kind enough to bring us a list of the few that do, so that we could make our selection accordingly."
Augie A.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,2,1.0,1/9/2017,"In from Atlanta, staying at a nearby hotel (where I should have stuck to vending machine snacks for dinner, v. Eating here).  Called in my order.  Asked what sides come with what I was ordering (which was a combo of grilled salmon and shrimp scampi), I was told by the girl on the phone, ""mashed potatoes... and whatever comes with the salmon and whatever comes with the scampi"". Ha! I could have guessed two thirds of that response. I call the number from the curbside parking (as instructed on their website), no answer. Okay. I go in, pick it up and pay, including a 10% tip (it's take out), and I ask for utensils.  Get to my room (two minutes away), EVERY THING is swimming in some kind of cream sauce. Wrong order. There is shrimp and there is salmon, but clearly not what I ordered (check out the pic after I choked it down). And cold to boot. And I got two plastic forks. That's it.  Don't patronize this place.  I'm not hard to please, but this was a joke, if not a slap in the face. I guess $35.00 for take out dinner for one, doesn't warrant a little attention to detail.  Horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. UPDATE: Just spoke to the manager. He told me they get a lot of complaints about the combos and I should write a letter to corporate.  How about instead, I just never eat at ANY Cheesecake Factory, ever.  I hope potential investors read reviews... save your money folks!"
Erika R.,"Chantilly, VA",196,9,4,2.0,4/30/2017,"I'm in the middle of dining at the restaurant right now and it's not looking very good from how everything is presenting itself. I was surprised to see no host at the front for minutes and was amazed to find that there wasn't a wait time when I came in with my family to the restaurant and we were seated fairly quickly.  As we sat down the waitress told us the specials and took down our drinks, appetizers, and a request that we have only the honey wheat bread before she left.  The drinks were simple: iced tea, coke, water with lemon, strawberry lemonade, and buffalo wings. When the waitress returned several minutes later, she forgot we ordered all honey wheat; as well as my mother's lemon for her water. Then it turned out that they ran out of iced tea? So my father opted to order a strawberry lemonade as well after placing our main entrees and my brother realized his coke was flat. Right now, my father is still waiting on his soup; I re-ordered the lemon for my mother that has yet to arrive; and a table next to ours had gotten all honey wheat bread as well as their meal when we had gotten in 15 minutes before them (maybe that's me also being a bit bitter). Sitting in the dining area, I'm trying to remain optimistic that maybe there are hiccups within the kitchen and the rest of the dining staff, but it doesn't make much sense to me seeing as though there are also several open tables and that more than 30 minutes have already elapsed where I'm not presented with a meal and that there are still appetizer plates and an empty bread bowl that hadn't been taken away. Maybe about ~5-7 minutes after I finished writing my last statement the food came out and the waitress had a surprised look on her face when my father asked about his soup and she ran back to get it saying it was on its way. When she came back, we asked for a third time about the lemon, but said it was for the entree of a pan seared salmon and the Asian taco lettuce wraps. I ordered farfalle where bacon bits were burnt and it seemed as though the tomatoes were raw and simply cut and thrown into the dish. Then my brother's jambalaya pasta was drenched with a watery sauce. After ordering dessert, service improved, but by that point, I've already made my opinion on this location of the establishment. This is my typical go-to restaurant in an area I'm not familiar with and the result of this was very disappointing."
Kelly A.,"Everett, MA",0,1,,3.0,10/22/2017,Went in earlier today and got seated right away. Our food took almost an hour to come out and they forgot the fries to my burger... the service however was good.
Charlie C.,"Charlottesville County, VA",0,5,,1.0,9/16/2017,"I will be calling the the corporate Cheesecake Factory offices on Monday morning.  The food at the Boston location in the mall was Terrible with a capital T.   We ordered 2 shrimp platters, 2 burger plates, a cheese pizza and guacamole with chips.  Here were the issues, the server had very bad attitude and was rude and inattentive to the issues.  And to add insult to injury the all of the platters were cold and old....not fresh at all what I don't understand is how can you not serve hot fries and fresh shrimp, wilted lettuce and half cooked burgers!!! Cheesecake Factory quality of food and service is seriously declining to the level of Red Robbin!!! Terrible!!!!!!!"
Stephanie D.,"Alexandria, VA",11,16,30,4.0,7/6/2017,I ordered lettuce wrap chicken fajita and mozzarella  and tomato flatbread. Both from the skinnylicious menu.l (480 calories for both). Great taste - very satisfied !! Returned the next day and ordered the skinnylicious Cobb salad which was also very good !
Kris H.,"Central Manchester, CT",6,159,150,4.0,5/26/2017,"This location has fast, friendly service.  We loved the cocktails with fresh, yummy juices!  Loved the lo-calorie option menu and we always split a tiramisu cheesecake slice.  Perfect portion for two people and lighter than the regular cheesecake slices (but the snickers, peanut butter and pumpkin ones are worth the occasional splurge!)"
Matt B.,"West Roxbury, MA",8,29,,1.0,8/3/2017,"This was by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to accommodating customers. We have a reservation for 15 people, which include 2 under the age of 3 and 1 over the age of 85 with a walker. As the party began to arrive, we were told there was a policy not to seat a party until 80% (12 people) were there. As we asked and spoke with the manager, we were told they would not seat us even though the table was friendly. When asked if they would rather make a 85 year old with a walker and 2 crying/hungry kids wait then sit, we were told yes and there's nothing they would do. After finally getting sat, the drinks were extremely slow and not made correctly. I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone with a large group. By far the worst cheese cake factory I have ever been too and quite honestly the worst restaurant I have been to with my kids."
Tori R.,"Haverhill, MA",0,5,1,1.0,9/30/2017,"Was staying at the Marlowe. Ordered dinner to go. Went and they said they didn't have my order *after they had given me a price and an estimate of 25mins and asked for a name for the order* waited 25 mins, went downstairs to pick up, said they didn't have the order and blamed us. We even showed the hostess the number she called and she said ""no"" When we got back to the room, we verified it was the right number and location. It was. We had to wait another 25 minutes for the food to be made. When asked for a manager, they disappeared for 10 mins. Never saw a manager. Bread was burnt. Get your sh** together. Should have ordered room service."
Holly W.,"Lincoln, RI",7,202,95,2.0,4/10/2017,"So the cheesecake factory isn't my favorite place to eat but we were at the Museum of Science and its a short walk to the factory.  I always wonder why they don't turn the lights up a little?  I understand ambiance but it was really dark!  Turn it up a little!  So they have a kids menu but don't offer coloring or anything.  On top of that, my 5 year old's food was the last to arrive. The three adult meals had arrived and we waited 7 minutes for her pizza to arrive!  That's hard for a kid and there were no apologies from the staff. I had a cheeseburger on sourdough.  The burger didn't fit, made it messy and the burger was burnt! It wasn't really tasty and after waiting the 7 minutes for my daughters food, my fries were cold.  I have to say their desserts are AMAZING but I am not a fan of their food. (plus there are too many options on the menu!)"
Nikita G.,"Toronto, Canada",152,27,34,3.0,5/23/2017,"I've been to the Cheescake Factory in multiple states and cities before but this was location definitely had the worst service I've ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. Usually the servers are very helpful in telling you what's in the food, suggestions on what to order, substitutions for vegetarian/vegan/gluten, etc. Our server here looked completely disinterested and didn't help at all. The food was good as usual (we ordered mac & cheese balls, sweet corn tamale, and thai lettuce wraps). Would definitely recommend the sweet corn tamale to anyone! Can't give it more than 3 stars though because of the horrible service we received."
David K.,"New Hyde Park, NY",90,302,59,4.0,8/22/2016,"We've always enjoy having brunch at the Cheesecake Factory and this Cambridge location doesn't disappoint. Though alot smaller than our usual Westbury, LI location, it does have a cozy feeling. At the time we went for brunch, we were seated promptly, our orders arrived within a short wait and the service was attentive. If we're ever in the Cambridge area again, we'll definitely make a return visit."
Abdurahman B.,"Chelsea, MA",1,10,2,3.0,5/22/2017,"Went here multiple times, some were great while others were not so great. We had some nice waiters that would help up and we didn't have some nice waiters at other times. Chicken fingers were over cooked and buffalo blasts were undercooked(they claimed that they were cooked right but we knew it was wrong). I give this place at least 5/10"
Catherine R.,"Everett, MA",58,146,852,4.0,2/7/2017,"The food is always good here, expensive. It worth it & must have room for cheesecake they give you big piece. I dont remember cheese cake cost $8 & it was $6. Should stay that price. I like their tea & servers are excellent server & so very nice people."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",480,1448,1175,3.0,6/26/2016,"I've never been ignored for 20 min by a waiter before. We were seated and then ignored. I was on the verge of walking out. Not only was I infuriated (what kind of service is this?), I don't have time to waste.  Luckily, a waiter who was not in charge of our section noticed that our waitress was MIA, and came over and apologized and offered to help. I was pleasantly surprised and decided not to walk out.  He immediately brought us water, some beer, and a basket of bread. Mmm I love the bread basket in the cheesecake factory. After that, he took our orders. There is the normal menu as well as a skinny menu. I had one of the lunch options from the normal menu, the lunch portions are smaller and cheaper than the regular options. I had the miso salmon, which came on a bed of brown rice. The rice was a little too packed together, the salmon was ok. After we had finished our meal, our waiter said that we could each get 2 slices of cheese cake for free. How awesome is that! We were in a rush to leave, so he packed up the cheesecakes for us, and made sure to include forks, knives etc. I was very thankful for his excellent service.  Thank you to the wonderful waiter who stepped up and made our visit pleasant! Sti"
An D.,"Boston, MA",33,29,5,5.0,4/9/2017,"Sat in the bar  Kendi is amazing, not sure if thats her name i just based on the receipt. came here just 20mins ago and shes amazing. The ultimate margarita is mind blowing, it did made me relax .. thats prolly why i am making this review. Came here to relax and i did get it plus i am happy to leave with my cheesecake. Bdw the wheat bread is not good, the food runner gave me a stone wheat breadBut everything else is amazing"
Alexandra M.,"Boston, MA",455,1359,2040,3.0,1/29/2016,"Service was a bit slow, on a Wednesday where it was not packed. Multiple times we wondered where she went as we were ready to order or needed more water.  Appetizers were great--calamari, fried mac n cheese, and avocado spring rolls. Entrees on the other hand...mine was quite bland. It could have used more salt, pepper and spice. It was a shrimp and tomato angel hair dish. My cheesecake (white chocolate raspberry truffle) was great. I had a pretty terrible margarita as well."
Matt W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,149,12,1.0,2/5/2017,"I was here for SuperBowl lunch ate by myself at the bar. A couple of advices for this restaurant manager... People that eat at the bar are usually single persons or small groups therefore is important to have a social bar tender.  The lady behind the bar was all but social and friendly, she seemed in pain or pissed every time I had for order or ask for a refill. I know it's not obvious when you are at the bar to spot empty glasses. It took 20 minutes to get my appetizer (salad) and didn't get bread... maybe because I was alone? Anyway not my best experience to say the least."
Shortcake R.,"Boston, MA",8,84,106,1.0,12/19/2016,"Order from cheese cake factory through Door Dash.. Cheese cake factory forgot the most important items . My two cheese cake. I called the store & Yelitza had me on hold for 15 minutes REALLY?  I often order take-out at the cheese cake bakery counter. So I'm pretty sure the name on the receipt is whom confirmed the order. Yes Yelitza ! You indeed forgot to pack my two cheese cakes :( Thanks for the response! Door dash was not at any fault for packaging my order. Door dash was to deliver my food . The point was I contacted the store & nothing was done . the item could of been re-deliver to me but it wasn't an option when asked , I could have picked up my cheesecakes on my way home from work. I even had the door dash delivery guy contact the store & even he told me the girl left him on hold. Poor customer service. Yes! I got my refund thanks to them ! Their excellent customer service to make customer happy. I think you guys forgot the point ! She never packaged my CHEESECAKEs"
Liu Chen J.,"Cambridge, MA",119,4,,2.0,5/29/2017,"It took them 30min to serve our pasta, we figured they must've made the pasta from scratch. Really poor experience there"

Michelle C.,"Wayland, MA",78,437,3672,2.0,10/12/2015,"I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory but ended up here against my will with a very large group. Our waitress was great but the food was lacking.  Fried zucchini was okay but I made the mistake of ordering breakfast which came out burned to a crisp potatoes and toast and  underdone eggs, argh!  I got cheesecake to go (original strawberry) and it was very good. So light and fluffy!"
Viola J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,4,4.0,7/31/2017,This place is definitely match the price with dishes's size. Everything I ordered is almost twice size as other restaurants.
Lina S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",33,99,199,5.0,7/4/2015,"My sir and I came here on a hunt for steak and potatoes and did not expect much in the meat department, assuming that Cheesecake Factory is only good for cheesecake. We came around 2pm on a holiday (Independence Day), so it was relatively busy. Luckily, we were seated quickly at a cozy little booth for two. I got the coulotte steak (common name ""sirloin"", my childhood favorite!) and it was served on its own plate, while my mash practically came on its own palanquin. At first I wondered why my steak had its own giant plate, and then I saw ALL THE WONDERFUL STEAK JUICES.  The steak alone was very lean and tender, BUT THOSE JUICES!! Oh gosh, it was just the cherry on top of my entrée.  For dessert, the sir and I shared a toasted marshmallow smores cheesecake. I'm a lover of smores in its pure form, so I don't feel like the particular flavor belongs on cheesecake. Still, for a cheesy variation, it was very rich and toasty. The glazing marshmallow was beautifully browned and the cheesecake itself is incredibly rich. Cheesecake Factory quality, definitely. The only thing that was ""off"" about this visit was that my sir's fork had dried spinach or something stuck on the back of it, likely due to rushed dish washing."
Danielle M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",726,144,123,1.0,2/13/2017,"Don't waste your time on this location! We placed a takeout order last night... They messed up the order, told us it would take 15 minutes... 40 minutes later, it still wasn't ready. We talked to a manager, and he didn't have any explanation to why it took so long and why our order was incorrect! Worst customer service ever from the manager and the girl working the takeout area by all the cheesecakes. Pass on this location! There was no one here last night at almost 9, and they still screwed up!"
Aaron P.,"Fayetteville, NC",13,53,17,5.0,6/24/2017,"Pretty standard but good experience. Service was fast, Hugo was a friendly and attentive server. Appetizer came out quick, steak was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were delicious. Green beans were very plain though."
Corin B.,"Everett, MA",49,12,4,2.0,2/16/2017,"I came in last night with my boyfriend at around 8:30ish. It wasn't too busy and we were sat towards the back which I didn't mind at all. The food was good and the atmosphere is quiet, however the service wasn't great at all.  I was a waitress for years and normally try not to complain about service but it really made our time unpleasant. We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn't catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn't want us there either. Everything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn't getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine. As we were nearing the end of the meal she came over and my boyfriend asked to have his food wrapped up. I didn't even have a chance to ask for mine wrapped as she grabbed his plate and whipped around and walked off so fast. She came back with his food and again immediately walked away so quickly I couldn't ask for my food to be wrapped up. When she finally did come back I was able to get my food wrapped up and we asked for a dessert menu. My guess is she probably wasn't going to offer one because she certainly didn't want us there any longer. We ordered one piece of cheesecake to split and she brought it over with our check but insisted there was ""no rush"". After we finished up dessert she asked if we were all set with the check, which we hadn't even touched it yet as we were still eating but we put the cash in anyways. She came over and asked if it was all set again. We said yes and she asked ""do you need change?"" My boyfriend said no and that was the end. No ""thank you"", ""have a nice night"", nothing. To spend over $80 on dinner and feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed the entire time was just not worth it whatsoever. We were checked on maybe 2-3 times the entire night and never once asked/offered refills for our drinks. We would've asked ourselves but barely got to speak as she spun around and ran from our table the few times she did come over. I've been in the industry myself so I really try not to nitpick or even complain at all but it really did ruin our night out."
susie k.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,3.0,6/11/2017,"People often complain about the quality control of chain restaurants, but this cheesecake Factory is my go to place when I'm hungry, don't have reservations, and want a place that will satisfy all picky eaters in a large group.  The wait at this place can sometimes be long and service can be slow, but I've rarely left here feeling disappointed.   Reading through the menu is like reading a novel. and deciding what to eat feels overwhelming, but I like this place because the food is good, it's a great place to take kids because it's loud, a good place to get a drink with a meal, and a reliable place for large groups.  Also, it's large enough place that I don't feel guilty if I stay longer than my meal.  Will be back again."
