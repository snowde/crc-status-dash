John L.,"Lowell, MA",325,1172,86,2.0,5/21/2009,"This particular Cheesecake Factory was part of the infamous ""Cheesecake Day '08"" insanity that's detailed by oodles of my friends somewhere in here.  I was lucky not to be a part of that. I've personally grown to not like Cheesecake Factory.  Is it the lack of nutritional information on their website, and the oversized portions that they give out (to remedy both of these, go here:   ) .  Probably.  It's next to impossible to get something healthy unless you plan ahead. As for the food, it's not terrible, but as I mentioned before, the portions are ridiculous.  I mean, people don't need that much food.  Even something as relatively healthy and innocuous as salmon is huge.  But if you are going to go, go during the week, and expect to wait, because people eat this stuff up (literally)."
Abir H.,"Boston, MA",7,94,,5.0,3/8/2014,"Love this place!!! the line of people to be seated is never short but the nice thing about the cheesecake factory is that there is something for everyone here. The menu is like a magazine its so long. the portions are big and chances are you'll wind up taking home your food. love their buffalo wings, buffalo wraps, buffalo everything! you'll find great salads as well. i recently tried a curry shrimp dish that was really good as well. if you're ever in the mood for huge portion meals here's your place. Lets not forget the cheesecakes!!! OMG!! Banana is my favorite but I love so many of them."
Fred C.,"Southborough, MA",0,9,,2.0,6/25/2015,Chicken Grande Burrito should be renamed to Rice Grande Burrito with Chicken flavor.  Tons of rice and almost no chicken in the burrito.  We ordered coffee at the end and it was lukewarm at best.  Sent it back and waiter reported that the coffee maker was broken - really?  Pretty marginal......
Mike J.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",7,238,12,3.0,3/5/2014,Second time at a Cheesecake Factory. Food was good along with the service. This one was not as crowded as San Diego which was nice. I enjoy the food I ordered both times but man this place is not healthy at all! Both of my meals were over 2600 calories each time! Still good to indulge every now and then!
Kristen F.,"Boston, MA",0,30,2,3.0,7/17/2014,"I thought this place was okay. I ordered the chicken zit broccoli alfredo, it was average in my opinion.  And had a slice of cheesecake. Which wasn't anything more than just cheescake. There wasn't anything that stood out about the place. The food took a long time to come , but our server was nice. I wouldn't be against going again. It was just okay for me."
Icaro C.,"Boston, MA",3,1,,1.0,5/1/2014,"Service either makes or breaks a company. I have for the first time in my life, experienced the worst customer service you can humanly and possibly imagine tonight."
Tanvi D.,"Sudbury, MA",27,80,2,2.0,3/10/2011,"I believe I can say, I think I'm done with Cheesecake Factory. They have a HUGE menu, but almost all the veg dishes are fried. There is usually a long wait no matter when you go. Fortunately that wasn't the case last night. We went because we thought we'd have lots of options. Not true, because even the veggie things are cooked in chicken broth. :-(. We ended up ordering fried zuccini, artichoke hearts, avocado egg rolls, pizzette and huevos rancheros. The food was all OK quality and greasy. For drinks we got coke and raspberry lemonade (which was VERY tart). The only saving grace for the dinner was their bread.  Don't feel like going back there again."
AJ J.,"New York, NY",10,41,4,1.0,9/5/2013,Sloppy bitchy slow takeout pickup. What's the point of calling if I could have just eaten at a table faster? And now I find out they left out part of our order. In effin believable. Hire someone with a GED at least.
J H.,"Middletown, OH",0,12,,5.0,4/27/2014,"Great breakfast, fast friendly service and real orange juice made for a great morning.  Would strongly recommend it for breakfast."
Cara L.,"Boston, MA",1,53,,5.0,9/20/2013,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria.  I mean, besides the fact that one slice of cheesecake has enough calories for a whole entire day, but I digress.  I never order the cheesecake anyway.  This last time, my friend and I split two items from the Skinnylicious menu: Thai lettuce wraps and the Ahi Tartare.  Honestly, I think I could eat this everyday for lunch.  Every. Day.  It's just THAT GOOD.   AND!  They have the most delicious freshly-brewed flavored iced tea with free refills.  Finally, our waiter was really fantastic.  I wish I knew his name, because he was so super efficient, anticipated our needing tea refills and generally kept us in his vision without hovering.  Anyway, in case you're reading this dear waiter, you were a tall, well-coiffed blonde gentleman with a gentle manner.  We sat in the bar in a short booth for two.  Who are you?  Is there skinnylicious cheesecake?  Hmmmmm..."
Will R.,"Brighton, MA",25,56,60,3.0,9/5/2013,"Brought my daughter here for her graduation dinner, and this is her favorite place to eat. I like this restaurant, the decor is really nice, but the food is standard at best. The service is great, and of course the cheesecake is awesome. It does seem a bit pricey since the food is standard chain food."
D N.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",0,38,27,1.0,2/5/2014,"Cheesecake restaurant wasn't even busy tonight.  I ordered cheesecake tonight was put on hold for ten mins, then drove 25 mins to pick up my food, they forgot to pack my cheesecake. I had to drive back twice to fully receive my full togo order.  I'd recommend anyone ordering to check your order before you pick up and pay them.  So disappointed at their bad service and training, and a waste of my time."
susan d.,"Littleton, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/18/2015,"We went  here today for lunch between business meetings. Arrived a few minutes before noon. The restaurant was not super busy. We ordered as we sat down, a little while later our appetizer arrived.  At 12:54 our lunches had not arrived. So not only did we waste an hour sitting waiting for lunch, we had attitude from our sever about our food not showing up.  I suggest if you have anything to do in your day find another place to go eat. And one that cares about their customers. Sorry Cheesecake Factory lost another customer to apathy.... And oh by the way, had the server pack my unaeatten salad so I could have it after my business meetings... No utensils! In the bag! Way to go....  And everyone in my meeting that commented on my stomach growling works within 2 blocks of your location. Next meeting we have catered... Not by Cheesecake Factory."
Julie B.,"Boston, MA",274,416,705,3.0,11/17/2010,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory, except that there is even a wait at 3:30 in the afternoon - thank you Cambridgeside Galleria.  I'm not too risky in my food ordering at Cheesecake and usually go with some greasy choice like the grilled cheese and fries. My friends liked their mojitos but they seemed a little weak and not worth their $10 price tag (no prices on the drink menu by the way). Our server was nice enough but took hella long in the bill-paying process. My friend wanted to wrap up her leftovers but our waiter disappeared so it was left there. Not too much to say...I like any place that gives free refills."
Ladyjane S.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",7,330,7,4.0,7/15/2011,"You know what? I like the Cheesecake Factory. I've pretty much enjoyed every one I've been to.  What I love:  The bread. I love it! I love that you can ask for as much as you want and no one bats an eye. I feel like a huge fatty afterwards of course but really, you're not going to come here and NOT feel like a fatty afterwards, so do it up. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice. The only dish I ever order. It is so damn good! What I don't love:  All other food including cheesecake. They just never taste very fresh. Occasionally I'll have a good classic one with strawberries but all the weird flavored ones are...weird.  Except the pumpkin, which is phenomenal. The service stinks and takes forever. The staff is usually friendly though. The fact that they're trying to make America even fatter. Seriously. It's like they're going for a Guinness record for the fattiest meal. And the salads are at the top of the list!!  Eh, whatever. I know I'll keep coming back for that coconutty deliciousness."
Anna W.,"Chelsea, MA",48,274,2,3.0,2/2/2011,"I must have come to this Cheesecake Factory location at least 50 times already. I don't know why it took me so long to review it! I used to work in this mall for a good 4+ years, and my co-workers and I would go down every Friday night after closing and have drinks and food. The best thing I can say is that though inconsistent, it is pretty solid. I mean, if we really didn't like it, would we continue to go there week after week? If you've ever been to a CF before, you know the deal -- HUGE portions, fast service, friendly waitstaff.  One thing that I feel is often overlooked is their mixed drink menu. Awesome selection! Some really great and unique cocktails (especially if you're a girly-girl like me and like sweeter, fruit-infused drinks), all of which are delicious.  The cheesecake is, for the most part, to die for. Some of the flavors don't really fancy me, and I've come across a few that fall into the ""too"" category -- too sweet, too cheesy, too fruity, too chocolatey, etc. But, I've found a few that I consistently love -- the pumpkin pie cheesecake (this is seasonal), the banana cream cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and red velvet cheesecake. You can never go wrong with any of those. Some other dishes that I like and have been consistently good -- the sliders, chicken taquitos, chicken madeira, steak diane, hibachi steak, and one of my all-time favorites, pasta da vinci.  Even now, years after I've stopped working at the mall, I still pop by for the occasional lunch or dinner. You really can't go wrong with CF, ever."
Dan C.,"Cambridge, MA",602,303,23,3.0,1/17/2013,"Confession time, I've been here twice in the last two weeks.  Once with my Dad as it is his favorite restaurant, and once with friends because up until a week ago many of us hadn't been here in years. This is one of those places that people probably aren't using yelp for unless they've been frozen in carbonite for the last 20 years because these days kids come out of the womb knowing what the Cheesecake Factory is.  Why this place is packed all the time is beyond me...well it probably has something to do with the massive portions, infinitely long menu, and saccharine drinks. Would I bring a date here? Hell no--it has about as much personality as a boiled ham.  Would I go here if a bunch of people all wanted to get dinner but were each insistent on pizza, pasta, Chinese, classic American, Southern, etc and all want it to taste exactly the same? Yes, I would.  The menu is like a compendium of food that has existed around the world and throughout time.  Its 21 pages of random things that people may or may not have thrown together after getting stoned. Food: 21 pages of chicken.  Goddamn people must eat a lot of chicken.  When I went here with my Dad he got a cajun pasta and I got what they told me was ""their take"" on chicken parm.  How someone has a take on chicken parm is beyond me, if you make chicken parm, its chicken parm, end of story.  Anyways, both of your dishes tasted exactly the same, but you should expect that from a place which is loved by soccer moms the world over.  When I went with friends I had a burger (doesn't matter which one since they all taste the same) and an order of the guacamole...which the waiter said we could get extra spicy, so we did.  The guac was quite possibly the least spicy thing ever conceived by man.  The burger was huge and cooked to order so I can't complain about that, though it's probably more food than should be in a person at a time.  I had the pineapple upside-down cheesecake, which turned out to be one of the worse decisions I've made as of late (and trust me, I've made some bad decisions lately).  Their super dense cheesecake sandwiched between two cold blocks of cake with the density of diamonds.  Oh, if you're curious, look up the calories for the dishes...you won't be that surprised. Drinks: I asked the waitress if I could get a Gimlet and she gave me a look like I told her the ending to Titanic.  So I decided to stick to the menu.  The Firefly, long island, and the mojitos are incredibly sweet, so if you actually like the taste of your liquor, then hold off. Service: Amazing service.  Way to go 20 year old girl and guy with awesome hair who's been there for 7 years, you're what made this place awesome for me.  The waiters can take you front to back then front again through the menu while blindfolded and lit on fire. Bottom Line: You really don't want to go here because there are so many great little places in this city we call Boston, but if you're at the mall and your options are this place or PF Changs, good God, go here."
Alex C.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2016,"I will never step foot in a Cheesecake Factory again. I created a Yelp account just so that I could comment on the service of this business. My boyfriend and I decided to have brunch at the Cambridgeside Cheesecake Factory. When my food was brought out my syrup was essentially water with butter mixed into it. I simply asked for a new syrup which by the time I received it, my food was already cold. Again the syrup was essentially water and our waitress responded that it's all they have and it's made early in the morning. So I sent my food back and was not offered another option. At this point my boyfriend still hadn't eaten his food, which was also cold. The manager DENISE approached our table and was incredibly rude telling me that I was wrong that it was syrup. Again didn't offer me anything else. I asked for the check, which was brought back with my boyfriend's meal still on it (which was not eaten). I politely explained that we shouldn't be charged as he was not intending on eating. The manager Denise started yelling and then stormed off without letting us get a word in edgewise. My boyfriend simply under his breath said ""what the fuck"" and the manager happened to hear in passing. She told us to get out, and don't come back, proceeding to call MALL SECURITY on us. Other employees were laughing at us. The whole experience was humiliating. I often go to the Cheesecake Factory but I will never return. I am so appalled by this experience and sincerely embarrassed."
Shalynn H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",32,53,9,4.0,1/27/2011,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factorys in my life and I'd say overall they've always been pretty reliable. I've only been here once to get something to go and the staff behind the counter were helpful and friendly. Our entree came out in a timely fashion and was just as delicious as the same entree we would order in the Californian locations. Glad the quality and service is consistent even in Boston! AHI TUNA SALAD - Just so yummy. Sesame crusted seared ahi tuna (cooked on the outside but rare/raw on the inside) on a bed of spring mix that comes with a side of the sauce/dressing. It's really the sauce/dressing that sets it apart, some kind of soy sauce, citrus, gingery mix? Don't know how to describe it. Definitely my favorite when I'm craving a healthier selection at Cheesecake, otherwise I'd get the Chicken Madeira. :)"
John B.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,5.0,2/22/2015,U guys suck wow never again dude. Just kidding !!! Food was delish thanks for the good time
