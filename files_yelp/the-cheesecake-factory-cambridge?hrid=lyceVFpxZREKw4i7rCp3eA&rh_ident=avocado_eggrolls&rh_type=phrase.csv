Vivian C.,"Boston, United States",126,1439,14550,4.0,15/4/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a new long and skinny menu insert listing their new SkinnyLicious® Menu.  As a lover of variety, I decided to order two of those to make up my evening's meal. We were then asked if we'd like bread and butter - and miss their yummy honey wheat?  Silly question!  But plates were MIA so I ate mine on top of a napkin. WARM ASPARAGUS SALAD $6.95 Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon and Parmesan Cheese, Topped with a Sunny Side Up Egg ROASTED PEAR AND BLUE CHEESE FLATBREAD $6.50 Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions Sound good?  Yup, sounds good.  And they were pretty good, yet petite, though reasonable for the price.  I ate it all though, so a heavier eater would need something more. I also picked up some dessert for later.  A tiramisu cheescake that was light and not too sweet, and their Lemoncello layer cake $7.95.  If you like lemon, and you like your sweets not toooooooo sweet, you just might like this one. 3 stars *** 1/2016 *** We were seated in the bar area shortly after 5:30pm, and lucky us, we discovered that they have a bar menu now!  From 4pm - 6pm on Monday - Fridays, they offer 18 items for $5.50 apiece. The three of us picked a number of dishes to share and had ourselves a good time and meal. .   served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce $10.95 (regular menu price) . Fried Macaroni and Cheese crispy crumb coated Macaroni and Cheese balls, served over creamy marinara sauce $10.95 . Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke served with a spicy vinaigrette and garlic dip . Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes topped with sour cream, salsa, cilantro, avocado and salsa verde $10.95 . Southern Fried Chicken Sliders crispy fried chicken breast on mini-buns, served with lettuce, tomato and pickles $9.95 . Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip a delicious blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread $11.95 We particularly enjoyed the sweet and savory of the tamale cakes, while finding the fire roasted artichokes a rather messy experience as water dripped down our arms. Five probably would have fit our appetites a bit better along with a loaf or two of their wonderful honey-wheat.  Four if we had planned to save room for a slice or two of their delicious creamy cheesecakes. 4 stars"

Jess K.,"Pelham, United States",165,1240,162,5.0,22/2/2006,"""This place can have QUITE the wait so be prepared. The food is delicious but try to save room for the dessert, clearly. Order the   and you won't be disappointed. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich lives up to its name. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is mine too. The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is too scrumptous for words. Can you tell I go here a lot? I always assumed this place would have so-so food and amazing cheesecake but everything about it is good. That's probably why the line is out the door!"""
Sarah L.,"Binghamton, United States",28,227,,4.0,20/3/2007,"What can I say, I love the cheesecake factory.  It is factually correct to describe cheesecake factory as a chain with a fairly whack design philosophy, but I'm a total sucker for fried macaroni and cheese,  , milkshake cocktails, not being able to decide what to eat, and having to take home 3/4 of what I ordered if I want to have any hope of making it any signifcantly nonzero portion of the way through a cheesecake. The only problem this particular one has above and beyond what other cheesecake factories have is its mall internal-ness:  I don't know if I've ever been here on the weekend and had less than an hour long wait for a table for dinner."
