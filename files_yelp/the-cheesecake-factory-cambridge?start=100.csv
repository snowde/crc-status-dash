Tammy T.,"Boston, MA",264,61,65,1.0,3/10/2015,"I honestly don't see anything great about this place. People hype this place too much. The service sucks and the food is unpleasant to consume. So quick to get the check but never quick to give people your service. I would get the chicken belagio every time I went but the quality continued to disappoint me, leaving me unsatisfied. That is all."
Mozy Y.,"Somerville, MA",40,23,130,4.0,6/29/2015,"Awesome...  I ordered a meal to go and by the time I arrived on my short lunch break , I only had to wait a few minutes. They have outside seating now that the weather is nice and not to mention it being in the Galleria Mall . The wait staff was prompt speedy polite and precise on the time I would have to wait. I had the bacon bacon cheeseburger & my friend had a Mac & cheeseburger.  The burgers were cooked throughly and delicious. Overall great service!"
Ant W.,"Brighton, MA",55,2,2,5.0,4/16/2016,Absolutely wonderful experience dining in this establishment my fav is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp
Lee T.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",92,114,48,2.0,5/10/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory because you always know what you're going to get. Well, not at this one. Our Thai lettuce wrap takeout was missing sauces and utensils; they also forgot our food, so it just sat in the kitchen. Since the food selection is limited in the area, I highly recommend Yelpers who come here to be on top of the servers and the staff--make sure that you get what you deserve!"
Laura S.,"Uncasville, CT",0,43,2,1.0,10/1/2016,This was my first time here at this location.  I usually go to the one in Natick which is closer to where I live.  I did takeout and had ordered two entrees and an appetizer.  I was very disappointed with the overall taste of the food.  I had a cheesesteak sandwich which tasted gross with No flavor and was very greasy.  My friend had the teriyaki chicken and he too didn't think his food tasted very good.   The fried mac and cheese was just ok.  This is what we usually order at the Natick location and its phenomenal.  I won't be coming back to this location.
Ren T.,"Macon, GA",1,19,10,2.0,12/23/2015,"2 stars because of my waiter.. If not I wouldn't even bother with 1 star. My waiter was very attentive and professional but that was the only decent this tonight. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my first bite there was a bread bag wire in my sandwich that cut my lip. I informed the manager and she asked me if I wanted to keep the sandwich. I declined and she asked me if I wanted to replace it with something else. She left the menu for me to look at and said she would be back to check on me in a few minutes. I waited and she never came. My waiter did return shortly after and took care of my order. We waited an additional 45 minutes for my food so I just asked them to pack it up. ( understandable it is 2 days before Christmas but I was opening they would expedite it for me since I cut my lip due to a wire .. )  So we are in the restaurant for about 2.5 hours now and finally ready to go. I didn't bother eating my meal since my friend was already finished with hers. Our waiter came with our check and guess what? The sandwich was still on my bill including my new order! I asked for a manager and another gentleman came out. He said he would fix this for me right away. I asked him for some sort of discount since I didn't even get to eat my meal and we waited for so long. At first he seemed like he did not want to offer anything but suggested I take a cheese cake home. When I refuse he gave me a look and took my check and said ""I'll see what I can do.""  He ended up removing the sandwich which I returned and removing an appetizer we had ordered previously. He removed the cheapest item instead of removing my replacement meal which I could not even eat. I know it was a busy night but both managers on staff were less then pleasing to deal with.  It's really unfortunate because I do like going to the Cheesecake Factory but I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."
John B.,"Phoenix, AZ",339,419,506,4.0,11/17/2013,"OK, let's face it. We come in here for the CHEESECAKE. Yep, but also we had to have some food.  Only a 25 minute wait on a Friday for a group of six. We tried the Prudential Center Cheesecake Factory first, but that was a 2 1/2 hour wait. Hopped on the T and zipped out here.  Both my wife and I ordered off the SkinnyLicious menu: one veggie burger, which was perfectly edible and one turkey and avocado sandwich, which was actually very good. It was very difficult deciding on the actual cheesecake to order (because we couldn't really justify eating one each). One of us desperately wanted a graham cracker crust, and the other one didn't want too much chocolate. We both love Key Lime pie, but we were not sure if a cheesecake would give us the same flavor. However, we were pleasantly surprised. KEY LIME it is from now on."
Giovana C.,"Ithaca, NY",22,51,50,2.0,8/16/2015,"The cheesecakes are good. There are so many options in the food menu that is hard to choose. I was quite disappointed with the service... waiting to get the menu, food and bill..."
JR G.,"Boston, MA",0,76,23,1.0,3/21/2016,"I came back here after more than a year in the hopes that service had gotten better. Spoiler alert: it hasn't. I was there with a group of 4 and with all the waiting time between appetizers/main course/dessert, we were there for (no joke) almost 3 hours. At one point, our waitress disappeared to get the dessert menus. She didn't return for more than 15 minutes. This is on top of the fact that we had already been done with our food for about a half hour and had to flag her down to let her know we were done, since she didn't once come to check on our table during that time period."
Shrish B.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,9/28/2016,Been waiting more than 45 minutes for our food. Excuse is that the salad was taking long to prepare and there were no salad bowels!
Ahnauncia S.,"Everett, MA",6,30,14,3.0,3/18/2015,Yesterday was my sisters birthday so I made reservations for 10. At 6:30pm I gave the lady everything she needed for my reservation including my number and went about my day. When I got there in time for my 6:30pm reservation the host informs me that I was the reservation that the new girl took by accident because they don't take reservations. Ok no problem the new girl made a mistake. But then I kindly asked if they knew about this mistake why didn't they contact me seeing as I left them my number. The girl then gave me an attitude telling me she just heard about it. Like seriously? . After waiting over 20 minutes my family and I were finally seated. My salmon wasn't bad but my moms orange chicken was rubbery and gross.  Bottom line FOH staff sucks. If it wasn't for our waitress they could've gotten less stars but she was nice and on point.
Jessica C.,"Medford, MA",36,15,2,5.0,4/13/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always on the restaurant of choice list! The food is always fresh.  My favorite is the Lousiana Chicken Pasta!  Yummy. We always try to ask for out favorite waiter, Josh Sousa.  He's so very knowledgable and always makes sure he recommends something new to us!  When Josh is not in the service is still very delightful!"
Victoria B.,"Somerville, MA",177,35,33,3.0,3/16/2016,"I have never been a huge fan of CCF... Expect when I was 12 years old. My biggest problem is the size of their portions, it's simply insane. How the heck do they expect us to order a cheesecake after being on the verge of death after eating less than half of your meal. Also, the food has never blown my mind either. I've gotten nauseous from the 4 cheese pasta... However, it is a chain and the service tends to be decent whichever CCF I go to. If you're not a fan of the menu, give the almond crusted salmon salad, it's one of the best items I've had on the menu. (One of my friends lives by this place and so does my 8 year old brother so I've been dragged there over 20 times)"
Kristine A.,"Boston, MA",223,434,10,2.0,7/25/2013,"I came here w/ a friend of mine & we shared an appetizer-avocado spring rolls which were pretty tasty although overcooked a bit. We each got a meal since we knew dessert wasn't in the picture. Their portions are enormous which is so unnecessary. They must waste tons of food daily. I ordered the vegetable salad which ended up being teeny tiny pieces of vegetables in the lettuce. I couldn't tell if the asparagus was scallions or actually asparagus. It didn't make sense to me to have a salad w/ such tiny pieces of vegetables that they were barely noticeable. My friend got an omelette which on the other hand was basically like an egg pocket. Instead of her items being incorporated into the eggs it was placed in the middle of the omelette like a hot pocket or something. So we ended up being confused at why her food items (not cut up) were wrapped in egg & mine were all chopped up. We were both disappointed, but ate since we were hungry & were on a schedule."
Sonia D.,"Boston, MA",151,162,176,4.0,7/31/2013,"You can never go wrong with this place.  Not sure its the healthiest but they offer a ""skinny"" menu and the food on it is not bad.  They eliminate most of the sauces which can be a lot of calories.   They also have a patio which is nice in the summer! Check this place out if you are at the Cambridgeside Galleria Mall or just in the mood for some good chain restaurant food."
Cesar G.,"Boston, MA",1,2,6,5.0,3/30/2015,Very nice restaurant! Avocado eggrolls are delicious!! And the salmón genovese is the best! We had a very good time here!!
Tanya S.,"Cambridge, MA",17,245,162,4.0,11/27/2013,"The Cheesecake Factor has a gluten free menu! Much shorter (you no longer have to read 15 pages!). They have a decent selection of burgers (with gluten free bun), steaks, salads, some seafood (limited, mostly salmon), shepperd's pie and the like. Ahi tuna salad is delicious. They also have a flourless Godiva chocolate cheesecake that's delicious. Although there's never any room after the huge plates they serve you!"
Jane S.,"Belmont, MA",0,64,26,5.0,8/3/2014,"My husband suggested we eat at The Cheesecake Factory last night.  I had not been there in years and even though I remembered good food, I more remembered loooong waits, a book size menu, and lots of noise.   Our wait on a Saturday night at 6:00 was about 15 minutes.  Not bad at all.  There were a lot of families/strollers. The menu was extensive, but somehow it didn't seem as overwhelming this time around.  There were so many things that sounded good, it was difficult to pick one thing for dinner.   I settled on the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was fantastic.  My son had the fish tacos and he polished them off quickly.  My husband enjoyed the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I ended the meal with a yummy chocolate cake and my son had the strawberry shortcake.   Our waitress was very good.  She was upbeat, and attentive without being annoying.  The restaurant is noisy, but we were seated in a booth near the kitchen and it felt like we were sort of in an insulated area. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory far exceeded my expectations.  I now need to go back to try something else on their voluminous, but awesome menu!  I guess there is a reason why this restaurant has been successful for over 40 years!!"
