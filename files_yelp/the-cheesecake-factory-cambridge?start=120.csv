Beckster B.,"Boston, MA",56,80,69,5.0,12/3/2014,"This franchise is probably where you'll probably get the best of everything. Whether its American, Italian, Caribbean, Mexican its there! My favorite dish is their Shrimp Scampi!"
Daniel T.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",1,22,,3.0,8/5/2016,"Service was bad. The server was very rude and not welcoming. the server would roll his eyes and scoff when we asked for another minute to look over the menu. He took our order and was never to be seen after. Only food runners. When I was finally able to ask for a refill only because he was helping the table next to us, he brought over the wrong beverage and at this point we never saw him again to ask him to correct it. Once the bill came he circled the total and the ""tip amount"" for us to be clear. Which what I found to be really rude."
Jennifer R.,"Danvers, MA",56,325,25,4.0,11/8/2015,"I frequent this restaurant pretty often, never disappointed. Huge menu! Plenty of options no matter what you feel like. My favorite is the luau salad and chicane chicken salad both are absolutely delicious and huge! Very filling! My husband loves the orange chicken which comes with a large portion of white rice. We also go to the Sunday brunch frequently which is fabulous -- very fresh ingredients all for a decent price."
Jaclyn S.,"Everett, MA",3,75,263,3.0,12/10/2013,"The cheesecakes would get a 5 out of 5 and it is the reason why I've come to cheesecake factory many time over the years.  It's impossible to list a favorite cheesecake but the seasonal cheesecakes are always a great option (pumpkin, pumpkin pecan and peppermint mocha).  The carrot cake, tiramisu, adam's peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia nut are all so good.   In terms of the actual meals, the portions are huge. You will definitely get your moneys worth.  I'd recommend the bang bang chicken and shrimp, chicken Bellagio, miso salmon, bbq salmon and Chinese chicken salad as the best entrees.  Recently, I went and they had a lemon caper salmon special which was very good.  So much so, that I asked the waiter if  this would be added to the menu.  He advised that it is something that they can make, even if they don't list it as a special.  If you love salmon, then I'd recommend this dish.  In fact, all of their salmon dishes are real good. The avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts are also great appetizers.    The alcohol drinks always seem watered down so I don't even bother ordering a drink here anymore.  This place is really not for a fine dining experience.  It is a family friendly and casual restaurant.  If you want a relatively inexpensive meal, huge portions and great dessert (cheesecake) then this is a good place."
Krishna R.,"Malden, MA",0,8,,3.0,1/25/2016,"The food here is truly one of my favourites!! love it ! however there is some serious problem with the service. Everytime I visit the place and if its a different server they say different things about the dishes they serve which is really weird!  Especially for ppl with allergies, this could be terrible. One really needs to see all their servers give out the same information and sometimes some servers also have acted rude and disrespectful. Really need to pull up the sleeves on service and they would be perfect 5!"
Tina V.,"Methuen, MA",0,24,69,5.0,11/20/2015,"Cheesecake is always a good option. My boyfriend and I stopped by for Sunday breakfast that turned into Sunday brunch. Cafe Luna was a full house within 5 minutes that they were open so we decided to give Cheesecake a shot, I had the chorizo omelette and my boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros, he is Spanish himself and said his plate was cooked right. The best part was the French Toast we ordered, it was HEAVENLY!!! Plate came out with two thick slices of bread so sweet yet plain. Definitely don't underestimate the Cheesecake!"
Andrew C.,"Cambridge, MA",0,10,2,2.0,6/1/2015,"I was flabbergasted when my party of 5 was seated without any wait on a Saturday night at this Cambridgeside Galleria location.  Other CF locations in the Boston area have long waits on a Saturday night.  But based on our experience I can see why so many of the tables in this location were empty on what should have been a busy Saturday night.   Like some of the other unfavorable reviews here have noted,  service was a big problem.  From the outset, our waiter ignored us.  We had to ask for everything that really should have been reflexive (e.g., placing a drink order, getting bread).   When the meals came, one of the entrees had a mangled piece of dirty plastic in it.  We tried for more than 20 minutes to get our waiter to come back to the table, but he kept ignoring our requests.  We finally asked another server to go get him, and he agreed to take the meal away and get a new one.  The manager came over and took the meal off the bill, which was a nice gesture, but really couldn't make up for the fact that everyone else had already finished their meals and one person was left to awkwardly eat her dinner without anyone else still eating. If you're a fan of Cheesecake Factory, try their location in Chestnut Hill or at the Prudential Center -- the food and service are much better."
C M.,"Boston, MA",2,41,,2.0,11/9/2015,"We came here and ordered a couple of salads and appetizers.  Our waiter was wonderful, fast, friendly and attentive.  My lettuce in my salad was brown and wilted.  I felt bad sending it back and just ate around it Bc we needed to be somewhere after.  His meal was fine.  It's not that difficult for the people in the kitchen to see that the salad is bad-just throw it away!  I don't think I would return to this location."
James J.,"Boston, MA",3,5,,5.0,3/6/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant. I love their Skinnylicious menu. Everything is under 540 calories. I was there the other day with a friend and I had the Chicken Chili. It was fantastic. So was the carrot cake. Run don't walk to this great place. Oh, lunch for 2 was under $50."
Kam H.,"Dorchester Center, MA",0,3,1,1.0,5/31/2014,"If I could give it less stars I would. My experience was absolutely AWFUL.  First of all, my servers name I think was Pablo.  His attitude and sass was beyond me. He barely said anything, and sort of just stared at us making things awkward. He looked impatient like he was in a rush to get somewhere else. I felt rushed by him, and he had no response to any of the things I asked him.  Before we could even get our order he left and we were given a new waitress (thank goodness). Luckily she was nice.  For an appetizer I got the fried mac and cheese - there was PLASTIC in my food!!! The manager tried her best to excuse the food and took it off the order, but even she was rude. Point is, I'm never going there again and I would never recommend it ."
James L.,"Potomac, MD",0,28,,1.0,8/5/2015,"Have been here occassionally when in town on business. This last visit was my last. Sat at bar as I was dining solo. Ordered a cheeseburger and fries. 30min later, still no food. Flagged the bartender/waitress down who then asked one of her colleagues to check on where my order was. Her colleague ignored her. After another few minuites, my waitress asked another colleague to go back to kitchen, which he did. 5min later (it's now approximately 40min after my order was sent to kitchen) he brings out my food. It was *rock hard* and *dried to a crisp*.  Clearly had been sitting under the heat lamps for probably most of the 40-45min. Asked the waiter, ""What happened? What took so long?"" Waiter responds, ""It's dinner rush."" Tell him that the food was clearly ready awhile ago and sat under the heat lamps since the food is rock hard. He said he'd get the manager. Manager shows up. Apologizes and says they can remake a new order.  Uh, no thanks. Asked to pay for my soda and leave.  Manager said don't worry about the soda and apologized. I know it can get busy in restaurants, but, wouldn't you think *someone* would notice a plate of food sitting under the heat lamps and not being picked up?"
Amarys A.,"Brighton, MA",3,17,3,4.0,1/8/2015,"Well i like this place very much, use to go tehre with friends and we always have a great  time. I like the deserts and Aple Martinis.  When i have time I stop an di buy a chesecake for home and alwasy fres and delicius."
Natalin B.,"Cambridge, MA",45,2,,1.0,12/29/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory multiple times. This is my first time at this location. HORRIBLE service.  Receptionist told us 15 minutes, 15 minutes turned into 30. we asked her 3  times to check and she said 5 more minutes each time. About for  people that checked in after us got seated before us. Extremely disrespectful staff ignored me as a tried to ask to speak to manager. The manager did nothing about this."
Mary Q.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Dirty silverware and bread plates, sticky table, sarcastic remark from the waiter all made me realize why the place was so empty.  The noise level from the kitchen was interfering with our conversations.  Never again!"
Olivia H.,"Auburndale, MA",0,3,,5.0,12/1/2015,"I have always loved the food at the Cheesecake Factory. Recently, I ordered a salad for take-out and, after driving all the way to work, I realized they had forgot my dressing. I didn't have time to drive back and I was disappointed. I called to complain. Today, I received a letter of apology and a gift card! I went from annoyed to impressed very quickly. This is my new favorite Cheesecake Factory! They really take care of their customers."
Nicole B.,"Boston, MA",254,286,288,3.0,3/19/2014,"I have dined at this Cheesecake Factory multiple times and have found that sometimes there are inconsistencies, but overall its the best option at Cambridge Galleria. One time we ordered the guacamole appetizer and the avocado was  hard and not fully ripened, yet other times the guac appetizer was smooth and well done. Service is quick and friendly and I have never had to wait too long for a table."
Frinny P.,"Boston, MA",21,18,9,4.0,5/14/2016,We came here for dinner after going to the mall on a Saturday night around 9 pm. Our party waited 10 minutes to be seated after they said it was going to be quick and only needed to clean a table. It was about 9:10 pm. We ordered appetizers with water and they offered bread and butter which we had all our food at once because we read the service was not great on other reviewers. We ordered drinks and got them in about 15 minutes. Our food arrived at 9:48! They forgot to bring our appetizers which end it up working well because the servings were large and we were so full. We ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wrap. This was our favorite dish. The chicken was seasoned with a lot of flavor. Our second favorite was the eggplant Parmesan with pasta. Some of the pasta had pesto. The eggplant was delicious but the pasta needed more flavor. I ordered the combo salmon and shrimp scampi. The shrimp was tasty but the dish was just ok. The daiquiri and piña colada were also very good. My mother thought she got a virgin daiquiri because she couldn't feel the alcohol. Overall we had a good experience. Our waitress Andrea was nice. She seemed busy but understandably so on a Saturday night.
Jenne S.,"Malden, MA",7,53,12,3.0,8/1/2015,"We were seated immediately, but didn't like where we sat. A long booth with multiple single tables near the bar area seating. I could hear the people's conversation next to me too easily, and it was very loud in general. I really liked the wheat bread. The wait for food was long, and the manager came by to apologize, not that we had complained. I ordered the Rene special, a chicken salad sandwich with salad and a tortilla soup. The soup was great, the salad was huge but unappealing as it was mostly mixed greens drowning in dressing with a few tomatoes. The chicken salad sandwich was not really like chicken salad, it was large chunks of chicken in a mayo sauce with lettuce and tomato. It tasted better later when I ate the second half open faced (I fed the bread to some geese) because I could taste the almonds much better. I got the salted caramel cheesecake and it was fantastic! I would recommend only ordering dessert here because the food is over priced, the wait is long, but the dessert is excellent."
Eric M.,"South End, Boston, MA",0,3,,1.0,9/7/2015,"The cooks at this location are TERRIBLE. The last 3 times I went to this location in the last 2 months, all of our meals were missing  sauces and cooked wrong. Also, everything has been undersalted. Not coming back here."
Todd P.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,18,,3.0,10/10/2015,"If you've seen one.. I ordered Renee's Special. It was a good chicken salad sandwich with a so-so Mexican Vegetable soup (they had to switch my order last second -  out of Mushroom soup). The Caesar Salad was ok but ridiculously large. I tremble at the thought of how large the regular sized salad must be. The lemonade wasn't cloyingly sweet and didn't taste natural. On the plus side: good service, good sandwich, good bread basket & butter (maybe my favorite part of lunch?) And the bad: so-so soup & salad, bad lemonade I hear they have cheesecake too...maybe next time."
