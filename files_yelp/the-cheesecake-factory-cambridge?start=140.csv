Rosetta L.,"Seattle, WA",34,5,,2.0,12/29/2013,"I am familiar with the Cheesecake Factory chain.  I actually enjoy chains because there are familiar elements you could rely on to have a similar taste or quality when that's what you want.  This was a poor representation of the chain.   Slow service and menu items sold out by 7 pm was just the start.  The tea selection box with 12 compartments contained 2 types of teas.  The martini came out a good 7 minutes after the tea.  The skinnylicious soft tacos were good.  The shrimp scampi and chicken Madeira combo was barely passable (who serves scampi without angel hair pasta?).  The edamame appetizer was ridiculous.  It looked like they picked out all the green large plump pods for some other presentable dish and boiled up the broken, yellowed, teeny pods to serve as the appetizer.  I'm surprised anyone felt okay serving this to customers. Thankfully, the cheesecake was predictably awesome, turning this one star experience into a squeaking by two star rating."
Heidi J.,"Saugus, MA",0,8,,3.0,8/15/2015,"Came here w/my teenage son on a BTS shopping break. Seated promptly by a polite hostess. My son got the ribeye steak, I got a burger & my brother got the Caesar salad. Our waiter was ""meh"". Seemed like he was ending his shift & had a rough day. He never asked what sides my son wanted & he got a bunch of fries w/an onion ring. Would expect mashed potatoes or a vegetable. So that was left untouched. The steak he said was fantastic & that's what matters. My cheese on the burger looked like an after thought & not melted the roll was hard and crispy. The Caesar salad was good.  We got the chocolate cheesecake and lemon meringue cheesecake. Both as expected were yummy."
Sue S.,"Tewksbury, MA",2,79,24,1.0,1/26/2014,Did not enjoy their food at all.  It was heavy & drinks were weak.  I wouldn't go back there after asking others opinions & finding similar experiences. Food was not fresh at all.  Server was excellent though!
Claudia P.,"Boston, MA",27,246,4,5.0,1/21/2015,"Love this cheesecake factory always quick seating ,very friendly and helpful staff and the food is always cooked perfectly how I want it ,unlike the one in Boston . I take the trip to Cambridge just for this cheesecake factory"
Oriana G.,"New York, NY",376,16,9,1.0,7/20/2015,"Went here for lunch with my mom. I ordered a shrimp salad, she got a sandwich and salad (not exactly a complex order) it took nearly 40 minutes. The waiter was kind and did his best to compensate for the most part. At one point (good 30 Mins in) he told us he would get his manager. She came over and proceeded to explain to us exactly the same thing he said; ""the kitchen overcooked the shrimp and was redoing it"" and it would be out shortly - not helpful. That was it... Shrimp take like  a redo shrimp takes about 5 mins and a salad shouldnt take any longer either. Regardless of the issue i would have expected more of a fluid and sympathetic communication from the manager. Not saying we wanted the meal comped but a simple ""mistakes happen i am sorry for your wait"" would have made us feel better. Iv worked in the restaurant  industry for 5 years, i get it, shit happens. But 40 mins for shrimp deserve more then a ""they overcooked it"""
Michelle A.,"Boston, MA",384,476,186,4.0,11/27/2013,"Who doesn't like cheesecake? Maybe Leonard for Big Bang Theory due to his deficiency  of lactose digestibility. Well I love it but coincidentally split a piece of carrot cake from a nice man who is a regular at this particular establishment. We had a nice conversation about sports and touched base on the Keto diet I have been doing for awhile. His persuasiveness to try the carrot cake made me falter unwillingly (wink wink). It was yummy! Oh and did I mention I had a lovely mixed green salad, medium rare rib eye with sauteed spinach and a adult beverage the size of my head? All and all a pleasant evening after getting in some pre holiday shopping. Thumbs up!"
Iman S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,5.0,6/7/2015,The food is high quality. The menu is diverse and most importantly the staff are very nice. I have been to this location countless times and don't remember a single time leaving without a big smile.
Courtney C.,"Malden, MA",0,1,,1.0,7/10/2016,Went here to eat with my boyfriend and 6yr old. Food took long and when it finally did come they told us our kids pizza would be right out. After waiting another 5 minutes a manager came over to inform us that they burnt our sons pizza and another one would be right out. We waited another 15 minutes and no one played attention to us because they new we were pissed. Not even a crayon was given to us to distract a child from the fact that he was hungry and now tired. I understand a lot if things being in the industry especially screwing things up from time to time but as a server you should know that kids eat first and as a manager you deliver the kids food yourself and either take the thing off the bill since you know it's been an hour for a kids pizza to come out and since you know your service is bad. I made an amazing chocolate cake just for customers who had a bad experience for some reason and we want to show that we know we screwed up and we are sorry. That's for making us wait an hour with a crying kid making all the other tables think we are a bad table....
Becky M.,"Providence, RI",68,435,57,3.0,2/20/2012,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you'be been to them all.  That's the beauty and the drawback of a chain.   The food is always pleasing.  Today was there for lunch -- mixed greens dressed nicely with balsamic vinegar and a pizza with tomato, basil and cheese.  Hit the spot.   You know what you are going to get when visiting.  Depending on what you are in the mood for -- this might be just the thing.   Our server was great.  It wasn't overly busy since we were there for an early weekday lunch.   Nice part of this spot is that it's attached a mall.  Can nosh and shop all at once."
Shawn F.,"Marblehead, MA",52,8,,5.0,7/1/2015,"food and service was excellent. There is a good ambience  here ,we had a perfect dining experience. Best five star even 6 stars if you had that # thanks to the great service, great food, and desert ."
Michael W.,"Somerville, MA",121,189,3,3.0,4/9/2013,"I'm just not sure what all the hate is about.  Wife and I don't really hit up mega chains like this, but my sister in law loves this place, so we end up here from time to time. Honestly, for the price and based on our expectations, we were impressed. There is something on the menu for everyone.   The menu has dozens of offerings from tapas style small plates to entrees for 2. Wife has a severe gluten allergy, and the staff was knowledgable and attentive to this situation.  Everything we ordered was above expectations (admittedly set low), and service was prompt and professional. I hate to say this, but we'd probably return of our own volition.  As much as I can't believe the words I am typing, there's just not much fault to find here.  CF is kind of good."
Melissa M.,"Medford, MA",833,1030,8,5.0,1/1/2011,"I am fuzzy, tired, weary, and my mouth feels like a dry sponge.  I am nursing a hangover from drinking lots of delicious gin from the night before. I need to go The Factory of Cheesecake because I am craving burgers and when I say burgers, I mean sliders. Yes, I really am giving this chain restaurant five big ones! I really am giving 5 stars to The Cheesecake Factory because their sliders are unbelievably delicious and simple and probably will kill me. I only will get them when extremely hungry and/or hungover.  I get it with the fries ""deluxe"" and a couple cokes.  DIET, that is.  The service here is fast and they are friendly to me. The sliders are my go to hangover and hunger cure. That is all. PS sidle up to the bar area and enjoy."
Lana A.,"Kapaa, HI",8,332,1,2.0,10/21/2014,"During a recent lunch here at 11 on a weekday (the place was nearly deserted), our party of three experienced okay service but mediocre food. Definitely not worth the price or the wait time for our meals. If we ever go here again it will be just for an overpriced dessert."
Dean G.,"Epping, NH",0,28,,1.0,11/11/2014,"Out of the multiple Cheese Cake factories I have visited across Massachusetts this one is not up to par at all.  Examples include: Bartender said espresso martinis were more than 20$ and not something they make yet we have had them at every other location. Waitor was laughing at us... Used a birthday gift card here and ordered the most expensive steak on my special day. Cut into it (asked for medium rare) and it was beyond rare basically dark red. I politely told them that it was not cooked. Much later it came back, but they overcooked it and threw it into a box that I left at the table....Thanks guys!"
Gonen M.,"Cambridge, MA",148,47,25,2.0,8/18/2015,"I go to the Cheesecake Factory only for cheesecakes, because I don't like the food that much. And every time, staff seem so disappointed that I am there ""just for a dessert"", and I never get good service."
DeliLama D.,"Hamilton, Canada",0,30,,1.0,8/31/2013,"My wife is gluten free and has a shell fish alergy.  We arrived at the Cheesecake Factory as we were from out of town visiting Boston and Cambridge for a few days.   My wife approached the staff at the front and indicated she has a gluten and shell fish alergy.    The indicated that they could completely accomodate both alergies without any problems and indicated a number of choices.     When we sat down, the waitress indicated that none of the choices previously mentioned were available.    This basically left my wife with a very basic salad and a grilled chicken and very little other choice.    At this point my wife rightfully asked why they would recommend a series of chocies at the front desk and then tell their customer they were not available.    We asked for the manager.   At this point we waited for at least a half hour before he came out.  He assured us the Cheesecake Factory was a scratch kitchen (I find that really hard to believe given such as wide selection) and that they could accomodate my wife.   At this point my wife had been waiting quite some time and we needed to order.  The waitress was completely and utterly useless.  She had no clue what a gluten alergy is and what recommendations one can make.   She indicated even bread!!! duh!   The other complaint I have is that its really dark in the Cheesecake factory.  I actually had a hard time seeing my food.      I'd like to see my food please!  turn on the lights a litte wont kill you ...unless of course you have something to hide. We also sat beside another couple and their kids.  They were equally disappointed with this place.      I four going to eat somewhere there are many other areas in Boston especially along Hanover in Little Italy that can satisfy most of cravings."
Teresa S.,"Phoenix, AZ",289,811,408,2.0,9/18/2012,"I have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in years. Why?? Because it is over priced, and not that good. However, it has been awhile so I thought I would give them another chance. Sorry I did! I won't make that mistake again. The restaurant was freezing cold to start with.  But, lucky I had a jacket with me. As it is late September in Mass. The staff was nice, hostesses and my server Paco.  Though other than my server Paco, no one said anything about my horrible experience. Never saw a manager. I ordered the Ahi Tartar , it was really good. less than 400 calories as well. Then I Ordered a mushroom burger,with sweet potato fries. ( you pay extra for sweet potato fries.) Paco asked me how I wanted the burger cooked, I always get it well done, because, as we all know E coli lurks in ground beef. Especially at a chain that probably gets its' meat from CON AGRA.    When it came out, my 10 fries were over cooked and very dry, but that was not my complaint. My issue was the burger.  First it was laden with mayo. After I scrapped all thought off, I cut the burger in half only to see the meat was raw inside. Not even rare!  It really scared me.    Thank You Jesus that I had not bitten into it. I showed Paco my burger, He offered 2xs to send it back. I declined because, you never send food back to the Kitchen. Not if you want to eat it. Any way, I just thought I would take it with me and cook it later .    Paco did give me a dessert of my choice for my inconvenience. I got a blueberry cheesecake.  It too was horrible. They are not like real cheesecake , it is all processed ingredients you can taste it.  Whipped cream is also processed. I would think for nearly $8.00 a slice, it should be real.   By the way I did ask if they had gluten free rolls for the Burger, they did not . No gluten free products at all. The place is busy and I don't get it. It is just not good.  Prices are high as well. I never mind spending $$ if it is good.   Sorry , but Cheesecake factory is not. I would not go back for any reason. Of course I tipped my server well. Because, it was not his fault. He did everything he could."
Helen C.,"New York, NY",37,66,13,4.0,12/20/2014,Their asian chicken salad keeps me coming back :-)   Friendly and quick service.  I am a happy camper.  Great post-shopping eatery compared to all the other restaurant options in the mall.
Megan M.,"Woburn, MA",92,181,62,2.0,9/18/2013,"Wow, I never thought The Cheesecake Factory could ever make a bad dish. I understand that they're a chain, but The Cheesecake Factory holds a standard of some kind. I think it's my duty to warn you about the Fish Tacos. Don't get them. I would at least have expected for them to be mediocre at best. But, it wishes that it could even be a mediocre-level. Dry and flavorless cod fish tacos for $15. I was overwhelmed by the presentation of my plate. It looked full and delicious. One bite, and I was immediately regretful. The taco shells were half warm/half cold. Cabbage was used as the lettuce, but they used the hard white part of it. It felt like eating cold cow hide. The beans were gritty and hard and the rice boasts of zero flavor. Bad choice on the menu. I should have just stuck with a burger. Our server Christopher was a really cool guy. He took our requests (extra bread, lemons, sour cream) seriously and delivered promptly. I ordered the crab cake bites, and he accidentally ordered the full priced ones. With a sight hesitation of wanting to speak up, I decided to call it to his attention, anyway. He whisked away the check and comped what I hadn't ordered. He put up no fuss. Props to this guy. I thank him dearly. Until next time... *shrug*"
Baris C.,"New York, NY",2,24,2,1.0,12/18/2014,Don't come here! Our filet mignon was burned and the chef or the manager came and argued with us to make a new one. I have eaten filet mignon before they do not know how to cook it without burning the meat. Also our second dish was a burger it was fine when I looked at it but They flipped the burger so we would not see the burned side. horrible experience.
