Sarah E.,"Warwick, RI",154,311,8,3.0,8/10/2011,I am not a fan of chain restaurants. But my experience here was great. We had a large party and were short on time. The service and food was excellent! I tried a new dish recommended by the waitress - the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It was delicious!
Miguel G.,"Boston, MA",23,14,,3.0,10/17/2012,"As far as I'm concerned, The Cheesecake Factory is not overpriced when compared to the Chili's, the Ruby Tuesday's, and the 99's- OK, so it's a tad overpriced.  It might average a dollar or two more per plate, but it really is much better than the aforementioned chains.  Not only is the food better, and clearly the options (we all know the menu is too large), the service is amazing, especially at this location.  I've waited until I've had 5 lunches here to write this review just so I didn't jump the gun. I can only speak for lunch, which is a nice place if you want to sit comfortably and eat an above average meal. Fish tacos, all day."
Mike L.,"Fredericton, Canada",0,6,2,5.0,2/23/2015,"We visited this location while on vacation.  The food was great, our server was very friendly and helpful.  The cheesecake was awesome.  Great experience and we will go back next time we are in Boston."
Jassim F.,"West Hartford, CT",0,5,1,2.0,2/11/2015,Everything was good but unfortunately my fries of the shrimp platter were cold and tasted stale.  The shrimp was great though!
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,4.0,6/27/2013,The black out cake is the best dessert EVER if you're a chocolate lover.
John G.,"Boston, MA",293,26,,1.0,7/9/2012,"My friend and I went to The Cambridge Side Galleria Cheesecake Factory for lunch on her birthday.  Our drinks took 20 minutes to receive and we were the ONLY two sitting in the bar area and the restaurant was dead. The server was a tall gay guy who spend most of his time gossiping with the bar tender about how much he loves to give head. I am gay, so I don't mind that he is gay,  but I did not need to hear about how this Mary gives head. The thought of his lip-gloss anyway near me makes me want to vomit. Again I am a gay man and it still creeps me out that he was like this. My chicken came to the table 45 minutes later and it was completely RAW.  The waiter waited 15 minutes before he sent a manager over to the table. I sent an email to the company and a week later a manager called me. The SAME manager that talked to my friend and I about my meal. She said she was sending me a gift card to make up for the horrible experience. She lied, I have received nothing.  This place is the worst in the company."
s m.,"San Francisco, CA",12,62,28,1.0,5/7/2014,"FOOD POISONING from the bistro shrimp pasta.  Now, I actually wasn't even going to write a review, but after talking with management about the food poisoning my friend and I experienced, I'm livid.  They said that no one else complained that night, so she was doubting we got food poisoning. That is NOT the right response.  Distrusting your customers is not good customer service.  We'll be eating elsewhere from now on."
Jason B.,"Sandwich, MA",286,560,36,3.0,1/17/2013,"I ate here of my own free will, and it was not bad.   I remain appalled by the size of the menu.  21 pages (interspersed with fashion and makeup ads) is ridick. As (hopefully) many people know by now, the calorie/fat/sodium count of many of the dishes remain high enough to exceed the recommended daily allowance for a single human. The ""Kobe burger"" is a straight-up scam.  That being said, if you get past all these annoyances, The Cheesecake Factory really isn't TERRIBLE.  The service we (oh yes, there were 5 yelpers present) received there was exceptional. The burger they served was good, the wines by the glass were not exorbitant, and there were a few very good labels.  At least being there gave us something to talk about."
Lana J.,"Montreal, Canada",1,12,,4.0,8/12/2013,"Thinking about a guilty pleasure? I have your answer: Cheesecake!... If you want a real cheesecake, come here !!! I just love the Fresh Strawberry one. I would travel to the States just for that! (We don't have Cheesecake factory in Montreal :( ) I also have tried the Lemon Raspberry, it was great if you're looking for something a little more tart.  As for the meals, this restaurant offers big portions, and always has a fun atmosphere. Definitely great on a casual Thursday or Friday night when you feel like having a beer, and you're in the mood for a big variety of food (they have a huge varied menu!). Quality of the food is average, however, but for the atmosphere and for the cakes, I give it a 4 star!"
Rachel C.,"Portland, ME",12,17,2,2.0,6/20/2013,"Our server payed no attention to us. When he finally came to take our order we told him what drinks we wanted, then IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SENTENCE of ordering food...... he looked at his other table and walked away right to them. I can't remember the last time that happened to me except when I was at a Dennys. Completely denied and wrote off without a care in the world. He came with our drinks fifteen minutes later oh and then he allowed us to order our food. A family complained to him about how cold it was in the restaurant and he walked away laughing and didn't do anything for them. To top it all off....MY MOJITO WAS GARNISHED WITH A BROWN DROOPY NASTY DEAD STALK OF MINT LEAVES!!!!! They gain one star because the manager was extremely nice and apologetic about everything."
Andrea B.,"Arlington, MA",666,520,457,3.0,5/16/2012,"The menu is literally a book.  My eyeballs felt like they were going to explode after reading through it. Got a pasta dish for 16 dollars that was worth probably about half that in terms of how it tasted but double that in terms of how much of it was piled on my plate. The cheesecake selection is ginormous too.  Best flavor of those I've tried is the white chocolate raspberry.  If cheesecake's not your thing, you could always get a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert - That'll be six dollars, please."
Joy J.,"Boston, MA",18,54,17,3.0,6/28/2014,"The service is better than the food, which is bland. The server messed up my order (omitted an ingredient) and then ended up overcharging me. The food took almost an hour to come out.  The drinks are good, I guess."
Lynn C.,"Paris, France",125,1056,611,4.0,9/12/2010,"Everything you would expect from a Cheesecake factory. Large proportions, friendly service, yummy food. Admittedly, sometimes their quality is inconsistent. My favourite dish here, the steak diane, has been made very dry with a lot less flavour, one or two times. The main problem here is parking. They do validate here, but not the full amount--not that anyone would especially drive to Cambridgeside *just* for the Cheesecake factory right? I don't know. Best way to get here though, is T to Lechmere or Kendall, and then walk. We used to come here often and personally never had to wait very long to get a table here.  It's always a great place for a casual date night with the S.O."
Stuart H.,"Oakland, CA",0,10,1,2.0,10/27/2014,Nothing special here. The enchilada was cold the wings lacked taste and crab cakes were burnt. Guess I should have come for cheesecake however after mains pointless thinking I'd get anything special. There's great afghan and Thai just round the corner in third st.
Kid M.,"Cambridge, MA",6,10,12,4.0,10/4/2014,"The Ultimate Velvet Cheesecake was delicious, but the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake was to die for!"
Xin Z.,"Manhattan, NY",35,35,,3.0,6/23/2014,My favorites are the skinny-cious menu and the huge size plates..always left full and satisfied!
Samantha K.,"Boston, MA",0,7,,1.0,12/21/2014,Food was disgusting. Told manager and was told chicken salad. I.e bread with mayo with extra mayo was how the food is always prepared. Never been so disgusted in my life. Never will I eat at this overpriced food factory again. Do not recommend.
Nicholas P.,"Manhattan, NY",17,35,2,3.0,1/7/2013,"The vibe was not as good as it was 5 years ago (my last visit there), however the food is up to the standards it used too. I do not like the huge menu and the ads in it - gets a bit confusing. The good thing is that this one has parking attached to it and they validate ($1.99 for up to 3 hrs), you can get a table easily and its next to the shops, so always good to get some bite and rest."
Gita N.,"Austin, TX",487,91,19,5.0,8/7/2014,"Good service, good food, lots of options. I had the Mac and cheese burger with a veggie burger patty and a side salad. It was all delicious! Also, ask the waitress to validate your parking at the restaurant! (Good for three hours)"
Adriana T.,"Boston, MA",156,275,44,4.0,11/5/2012,"My BF and I had brunch there on Sunday. I loved the Mimosa- it was sooo sweet- it was perfect!! I got an omelette w spinach, mushroom and beacon - it was average but my BF got the energy breakfast and the waffle. I LOVED the waffle!! The restaurant was very busy. The server came to the table to greet us right away - he was nice and very responsive but his shoes were very dirty!! I think Cheese Cake Factory should provide its employees with clothes and shoes!!!  Other than that no complains. We are going to return 100%."
