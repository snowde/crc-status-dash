Andrea O.,"Lowell, MA",6,8,1,3.0,9/19/2014,"The food is pretty good, same quality as the others. There is never a wait longer then 25 mins. The servers have been less friendly then desired. All else is ok. Tex mex eggrolls aee the best and you can never go wrong wih the ckn avacado club."
Kailey M.,"Beacon Falls, CT",47,18,4,4.0,7/30/2014,"Well, my guy and I unintentionally decided to come to The Cheesecake Factory on National Cheesecake Day (didn't know that was a thing!). Started out as kind of a bummer, there was a log wait for a table on a Wednesday night, and the hostess was less than pleasant. Maybe it was a rough night for her but she pretty much seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. But anyway, once we were silently lead to our seats by one very annoyed hostess the rest of the night was golden! The service was relatively quick for such a busy night, the pastas we ordered were amazing, and our cheesecake was half off because of the day! Couldn't be happier, it was delicious! Nice work for such a busy, crazy night."
Jonny C.,"Cambridge, MA",336,461,15,2.0,2/10/2010,"Like any other Cheesecake factory: mediocre, stomach ache inducing and boring. However, I love their Thai lettuce wraps (yes, I know there is nothing even close to authentic about them, doesnt mean i cant stuff my gorge hole with them) and sometimes you just happen to go to places like this when you have a kid, despite your best efforts to the contrary.  An upside, it usually hasnt taken me long to be seated"
Emily F.,"Waltham, MA",4,225,9,4.0,10/18/2010,"I haven't ever had too bad an experience here. I love the food, the bar staff is nice, and hey! They validate parking.  Often busy, I usually just go for the bar. Love the tall beers!"
David C.,"Brookline, MA",537,465,166,4.0,5/15/2012,"Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory: They even have lots of tasty, healthier options as well now; you know, if you're in to that sort of thing."
Judy P.,"Mountain View, CA",32,107,39,4.0,10/28/2012,"I would have given 3 stars if it wasn't for their excellent customer service. One of my favorite dishes at Cheesecake  Factory is Evelyn's Favorite pasta. I was in mood for pasta and wanted to share it with my little boy.  My hubby got a hamburger which he seemed to like it okay. My pasta on the other hand wasn't very good and my son spat it out just after the first bite.  I still ate some thinking that I am paying for it anyway.  Our waiter came by to check on us and noticed that I hadn't eaten much so I mentioned that the pasta had unusually bitter lasting taste. He was really apologetic for the food. We asked for a check and waited for our waiter to return.  One of the managers came by to apologize for the food and I must say that customer service was super impressive!  A great customer service, IMHO, comes from a great management and this Cheesecake factory is doing something right!  Kudos to our waiter too!"
Daniel A.,"San Diego, CA",4971,184,434,4.0,9/1/2011,"Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Yes I actually ate Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner on Sunday at the Cheesecake Factory!  I was stuck during the ""hurricane"" in Boston (which was on Sunday), and the only place open was...you guessed it, The Cheesecake Factory!  I had the choice of sitting in my hotel across the street all day or having each of my meals at one of my favorite chain restaurants. I chose my favorite. With a menu that is 15 pages long, and food items that all range from 4-5 stars, why not!  Breakfast was an delicious Chicken Hash, YUM. Lunch was my usual Crusted Chicken Romano, and Dinner was an amazing Shepherds Pie.  Needless to say, I was stuffed on Sunday, and needless to say, I will probably wait to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for a while.  No, I wont wait until the next hurricane, but I wont be eating three meals in a day there either."
Michael C.,"Boston, MA",923,1346,1770,3.0,7/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory's makes a ton of different dishes, it is sure to please a large group with differing tastes. Although I can't say anything I have ever had here was extremely memorable or so delicious I couldn't wait to try it again, everything is more than decent. Let me tell you the perfect meal at the Cheescake Factory. Get as much of their great warmed bread (the dark bread is my fave) as you want and finish it off a slce of cheesecake."
Moises F.,"Boston, MA",135,23,15,3.0,3/2/2013,"Quality of food here is just as good as it is at other locations. We had the Chicken Piccata and the Steak Diane - which were cooked exactly as we ordered and delicious. The cheesecakes we had for dessert were also pretty good - as expected. Service on the other hand is much better at other locations like  Natick and Prudential in Boston. The hostess was quite depressed or something and didn't seem happy at all when we wanted to sit at a table other than the one she chose for us...Moreover, the food was a few minutes later than usual, which was weird because it was 4:30pm and the place was less than half full on a Friday."
Sun J.,"Medford, MA",31,18,,4.0,5/15/2013,"The other day, I was driving into work when I saw a huge billboard for Cheesecake Factory. Instant drool. I immediately put into motion the plan for after work.  I grabbed my coworker, who believe me did not resist the idea, and we got at the Cambridge location around 4:30. We figured: let's be good, have a lunch salad and then cheesecake. I got the Cobb salad, she got the Santa Fe. Lunch size! Both were freaking huge! They were ok, but way overdressed. Then we got our reward for eating 3 loaves of bread and 5 pounds of salad. Oversized Cheesecake! The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for. So rich, so decadent, 2 layers of cake in between 2 layers of cheesecake, white chocolate shavings on the back. Next time, I will just have cheesecake, but then again I don't want to wait in line for an hour and a half. Maybe I will just get it to go. Yeah, that's the ticket! The service was very attentive and friendly, the only reason this gets 4 stars is because of those huge ""lunch salads"" swimming in dressing."
Eric W.,"Tallahassee, FL",23,49,269,4.0,2/8/2012,"I can't help it, I love this joint. Aside from the occasional misfire the food and desserts are usually excellent. it's a little overpriced but most places are in this city."
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",158,857,3017,3.0,8/15/2012,its Cheesecake you know what to expect... Dont go on a Friday/Sat night unless you want to wait hours... but the pull up pick up is the best ever!
Kamille W.,"Somerville, MA",62,115,133,3.0,8/9/2012,"Confession: I like the Cheesecake Factory. I know, I know. It's a huge chain with the kind of crazy-huge portions that make people hate America. There's nothing inventive or unique about the food. I understand that I probably shouldn't like this restaurant as much as I do. All the same, there is one inescapable truth about the food at the Cheesecake Factory. ...it's freaking delicious. I have been to this restaurant countless times and have never been disappointed. The service is good and the prices are perfectly reasonable. Plus, that eight-pound tome they call a menu makes the Cheesecake Factory the perfect destination for a group with highly variable tastes.  From first bite to last bite, everything is always tasty. On more than one occasion, I've requested refills of just that honey wheat bread (what do they put in it to make it taste so good? crack?). Their new, horribly-named Skinnylicious Menu has great options for people who want something lighter than the restaurant's standard fare. I'm a big fan of both the tuscan chicken and the BLT. Want a fattylicious meal instead? No problem -- get yourself a trough of cajun pasta or a burger roughly the size of your face. The dessert choices are plentiful and coma-inducingly good. Honestly, if you're in Cambridgeside, you could do a lot worse. Three and a half stars."
Miguel R.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,8,2,4.0,8/19/2014,"Note: If this review was based solely on food, it would be a three star review. I was a bit skeptical to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in CambridgeSide  after my first (and I thought it would be the last) experience, at The Cheesecake Factory, in Rancho Mirage, California. A friend wanted to change my view on it, since she loved the place. I gave in and hoped that the food and service were better this time. I was content with the experience. We were seated right away. The waitress was very nice and brought our drinks quickly. It was, again, a hassle deciding on something given that the menu is tremendously long. After about 15-20 minutes of deliberation we all decided what we were to eat. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish contained shrimp and chicken sauteed with tomato, onions and peppers in a ""very spicy cajun sauce;"" it wasn't spicy, there was a hint of pepper in the dish, but not enough to make your tongue burn. The food was brought relatively fast given the amount of people in the restaurant. The dish was a colorful mixture of reds and oranges that expelled a delicious odor accented with spices and roasted tomatoes. I was hoping the dish didn't disappoint, like my previous experience. I dove in. The pasta in combination with the meats and the vegetables resulted in a mouthwatering experience. The flavor was there, no doubt about it. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The tomatoes were bright and complemented the meats well. Both, the shrimp and chicken went very well together, despite how weird the combination may seem. As we ate, the waitress would stop by and ask how the dishes were and was constantly refilling our drinks. My only complaint was that the dish was a bit too greasy, I understand that the sauté everything on the same pan and put everything on the plate; however, the food would have been much easier to eat if I hadn't had to carefully take the pasta from my plate up to my mouth as I was afraid the dripping grease would stain my clothes.  Overall it was a fantastic 4-star dining experience with good food, great atmosphere, and fantastic service."
Chelle C.,"Cambridge, MA",16,48,33,4.0,8/1/2012,"I have always been a fan of The Factory, I even used to work there (long after my love affair began).  I definitely prefer sitting at the dinner table to eat over serving... hands down! I don't know if my love for this place brings me good karma when it comes to getting good food and service but I have never had a problem here. Even though my taste in food continues to grow, this place never disappoints me.  There really is something for everyone... you just need to find the right dish- ...though, the menu can sometimes be overwhelming and it would be helpful if they had pics on the menu...  Now a days I get the Grilled Salmon with Spinach and depending on my needs either nutritional or comfort I will either get broccoli or mashed potatoes... this week, I needed some comfort, so mashed potatoes it was ... and they were actually creamier than usual (but still thick) which made it even better...!!!  So kudos to the chef too.  They also gave a good portion of spinach.  Sometimes that have skimped on that in the passed... but not Monday night!   They also agreed to give my friend the lunch portion instead of the full sized meal at the lunch price...  I forgot how much they try to please. anyway... And when I have a good server, I definitely have to Yelp about it!! Marissa... you rock!  You were polite, personable, knowledgeable and fun! And even recommended the New Oreo Cheesecake... which I got because it was National Cheesecake Day and it was half off... it was fabulous!  Thanks for the suggestion. If anyone needs suggestions of meal ideas I am happy to help you choose something that fits your desire... I am not kidding when I say I love this place. LOL... the only think I missed about working there was 50% off on meals and free meals on a double shift!  :) Anyway, go and enjoy... even if only for cheesecake and coffee, they have a good strong coffee for coffee lovers!!"
Brenda Lisette F.,"Lynn, MA",65,15,,2.0,3/5/2013,"I walked in once with a group of ten people, checked in and waited for a table which was said to take about 30 minutes or so. About 40 minutes go by and my husband approaches the front desk to ask how much longer just to find out we were NEVER put on the list and needed to wait another 30 minutes! No apologies or sympathy from anyone there! As we all stood there confused and upset all the employees continued having their personal side conversations as for no efforts were made.  EXTREMELY unprofessional and I will NEVER return to this place again.  I understand mistakes happen, but have some type of sympathy and make some type of EFFORT!!!!  We eneded up having dinner next door which was great all around."
Chloe S.,"Somerville, MA",0,41,4,4.0,7/31/2015,"Went last night for the first time in awhile and it was just a good as I remembered. Walked in and saw a ton of people waiting for tables but we were seated right away...Our waiter was very attentive and eager to please. Such as refilling our waters and making sure the food was good. I went with on of my friends and we both came away with more than full stomachs. Plus it was ""national cheesecake day"" and any slice of cheesecake was 1/2 off; it was a nice little perk that we weren't aware of before going in last night. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado club with a side salad. The sandwich was delicious, a little large so I had trouble fitting it in my mouth...there were large pieces of grilled chicken, plenty of avocado and bacon! The side salad was delicious but there was a little too much dressing for my liking. I still finished it all though (: My friend got a HUGE salad, that could have easily fed 4 people. According to her it was delicious and she brought the rest home for at least two more meals. After eating we did have to wait a little bit maybe 10 mins for our waiter to come back around so we could ask for the dessert menus. It was a very crowded Thursday night so it was understandable. My friend ordered the classic strawberry cheesecake and I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake....both were amazing. I couldn't finish mine even though I wanted to. The mousse was so smooth as was the cheesecake and the whipped cream was a nice contrast to the thick/rich cake. I would definitely go back!"
Brita F.,"Fargo, ND",120,284,14,3.0,5/27/2012,This place is a chain It's average like all the rest What else can I say? -Haiku review
J M.,"Boston, MA",6,167,21,4.0,7/28/2012,"Awesome food, love the appletini's! Ever notice how the special is always salmon."
K G.,"Boston, MA",8,237,53,3.0,7/14/2012,"Average for a Cheesecake Factory.  At times it's so overrun I can't imagine what the wait if (I don't stop and ask on those days).   For lunch during the week it's pretty decent though, albeit half the menu is tough to order with a good conscious with these calorie counts. If you have never tried one before, its certainly worth the experience as the dessert menu alone is obviously going to please anyone."
